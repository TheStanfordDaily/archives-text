## Michael Selmi Institute free market draw system 
### 
How much would you be will
ing to pay to live in Lambda Nu?
On the other hand, how much
would you be willing to accept to
live in Stern? $10. $100. $500.
$1000?
No, this is not an offer to buy
my way on campus, but the
chances are that you have never
thought about these vital eco
nomic questions I stress the
word "vital" because the an
swers to these questions might
reveal a considerable amount
about our character. They
might also serve to further our
understanding ot the so-called
"real world."
It is precisely for these two
reasons that I propose the
"Free Market Draw," a system
that would closely mirror the
world that surrounds us. I'm not
saying that is necessarily good;
perhaps realistic is the proper
word.
In essence, the tree market
system would be much like the
present system with one signifi
cant change. After drawing a
number the individual would b'e
able to keep the number for a
few days and have the option of
selling, trading or keeping it.
For those wishing to sell or
buy a number, or for those seek
ing a better understanding of ec
onomics, an auction would be
set up on the Saturday following
the draw. A common meeting
place would be essential to best
coordinate the buyers' and
sellers However, the auction
would resemble the New York
Stock Exchange rather than a
cattle market, in that the sellers
would auction their numbers si
multaneously
At this point, it is already pos
sible to perceive the potential
economic illumination that
could be derived from such a
system. Kcon. 51 and 52 would
come alive in White Plaza
For instance, the following
economic behavioral insights
would be achieved: should one
sell the number? How much
would one be willing to accept
for it? On the other side, how
much would one be willing to
spend? What number might it
take to live in the desired resi

dence? And if one sells a
number how will another
number be attained so that per
son can still get housing?
Means ot exchange need not
be limited to money. For in
stance. those majoring in
biology or engineering would
have additional buying power. A
communication major better
hope to be good-looking, rich or
both.
The rationale for the free
market system is two-fold: cur
rently. many people are denied
good housing solely because of
bad luck and there is no re
course to a bad number. Second
ly. many people draw better
than they need to live in their
preferred residence. So if the
two groups were brought togeth
er Abe Lincoln might be defied
once again.
But this only sketches the im
mediate benefits. However,
many social insights might also
be accrued. Rampant crime and
a black market would surely
arise. Those unwilling or unable
to work within the system would
inevitably devise brilliant
schemes to steal good numbers.
The true nature of roommates
would finally emerge. And more
sophisticated criminals would
begin to produce counter!it
draw numbers in a black mar
ket.
This would lead to a need for
laws and controls, and perhaps
an active "Draw Police Force."
The carefree atmosphere of the
campus would soon fade, and
students would finally g£t a
taste of what it is like "out
there." t
Nonetheless, the system is
still imperfect. One of the major
criticisms of such a scheme is
that the rich would have an ob
vious advantage The answer is
yes and no. Yes, they would
have a buying advantage, but
the actual advantage would re
main the same in that those who
draw well would have the true
advantage. No one would be
forced to sell one's number al
though coercive pressure may
be applied.
To rectify the wealthy stu
dents' buying power a financial
aid grant could be developed. A
draw stipend could be added to

current financial aid packages,
thus leading to a pseudo but
progressive welfare state.
The benefits of the free mar
ket system are innumerable.
Not only would it give sociology
professors something to do. but
it would also teach students
about the world that they will
someday have to face — maybe.
So a philosophy major who has
never taken an economics
course but was applying for a
job with Chase Manhattan could
confidently explain, "Don't
worry, I'm ready. I learned
about all that through the
draw."
Furthermore, financially dis
advantaged students would
have an instant means to pick up

some tax-free money. One
might be able to pay tor next
year's tuition by selling a draw
number.
This is obviously a system in
which no one loses and everyone
learns. However, it is also a sys
tem that has received very little
attention at Stanford, and in
deed throughout the country. If
it was good enough for Adam
Smith and his followers, why
isn't it good enough for Stan
ford?
If this all sounds a bit ridicu
lous to you. is it anymore ridicu
lous than the present system?

would you be willing to accept to
live in Stern? $10. $100. $500.
$1000?
No, this is not an offer to buy
my way on campus, but the
chances are that you have never
thought about these vital eco
nomic questions I stress the
word "vital" because the an
swers to these questions might
reveal a considerable amount
about our character. They
might also serve to further our
understanding ot the so-called
"real world."
It is precisely for these two
reasons that I propose the
"Free Market Draw," a system
that would closely mirror the
world that surrounds us. I'm not
saying that is necessarily good;
perhaps realistic is the proper
word.
In essence, the tree market
system would be much like the
present system with one signifi
cant change. After drawing a
number the individual would b'e
able to keep the number for a
few days and have the option of
selling, trading or keeping it.
For those wishing to sell or
buy a number, or for those seek
ing a better understanding of ec
onomics, an auction would be
set up on the Saturday following
the draw. A common meeting
place would be essential to best
coordinate the buyers' and
sellers However, the auction
would resemble the New York
Stock Exchange rather than a
cattle market, in that the sellers
would auction their numbers si
multaneously
At this point, it is already pos
sible to perceive the potential
economic illumination that
could be derived from such a
system. Kcon. 51 and 52 would
come alive in White Plaza
For instance, the following
economic behavioral insights
would be achieved: should one
sell the number? How much
would one be willing to accept
for it? On the other side, how
much would one be willing to
spend? What number might it
take to live in the desired resi

dence? And if one sells a
number how will another
number be attained so that per
son can still get housing?
Means ot exchange need not
be limited to money. For in
stance. those majoring in
biology or engineering would
have additional buying power. A
communication major better
hope to be good-looking, rich or
both.
The rationale for the free
market system is two-fold: cur
rently. many people are denied
good housing solely because of
bad luck and there is no re
course to a bad number. Second
ly. many people draw better
than they need to live in their
preferred residence. So if the
two groups were brought togeth
er Abe Lincoln might be defied
once again.
But this only sketches the im
mediate benefits. However,
many social insights might also
be accrued. Rampant crime and
a black market would surely
arise. Those unwilling or unable
to work within the system would
inevitably devise brilliant
schemes to steal good numbers.
The true nature of roommates
would finally emerge. And more
sophisticated criminals would
begin to produce counter!it
draw numbers in a black mar
ket.
This would lead to a need for
laws and controls, and perhaps
an active "Draw Police Force."
The carefree atmosphere of the
campus would soon fade, and
students would finally g£t a
taste of what it is like "out
there." t
Nonetheless, the system is
still imperfect. One of the major
criticisms of such a scheme is
that the rich would have an ob
vious advantage The answer is
yes and no. Yes, they would
have a buying advantage, but
the actual advantage would re
main the same in that those who
draw well would have the true
advantage. No one would be
forced to sell one's number al
though coercive pressure may
be applied.
To rectify the wealthy stu
dents' buying power a financial
aid grant could be developed. A
draw stipend could be added to

current financial aid packages,
thus leading to a pseudo but
progressive welfare state.
The benefits of the free mar
ket system are innumerable.
Not only would it give sociology
professors something to do. but
it would also teach students
about the world that they will
someday have to face — maybe.
So a philosophy major who has
never taken an economics
course but was applying for a
job with Chase Manhattan could
confidently explain, "Don't
worry, I'm ready. I learned
about all that through the
draw."
Furthermore, financially dis
advantaged students would
have an instant means to pick up

some tax-free money. One
might be able to pay tor next
year's tuition by selling a draw
number.
This is obviously a system in
which no one loses and everyone
learns. However, it is also a sys
tem that has received very little
attention at Stanford, and in
deed throughout the country. If
it was good enough for Adam
Smith and his followers, why
isn't it good enough for Stan
ford?
If this all sounds a bit ridicu
lous to you. is it anymore ridicu
lous than the present system?
