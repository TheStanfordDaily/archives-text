## Critic issues awards to University movies 
### 
I know you have all perused
many top 10 movie lists this
year, and another may be the
last thing that you want to read.
However, since I am considered
the best critic on campus — if
you do not believe me, ask my
mother — it is only proper that I
enrich you with my opinions on
the best Metro-Stantordyn-
Meyer motion picture produc
tions of the year. Here they are:
The Rnokhunter — intense
drama about what happens to a
cocky young UCLA basketball
player when he comes to Stan
ford for a game. At Stanford, the
player discovers more than sim
ply a bunch of tall Cardinals.
Rather, he discovers love . . .
that is, love of chemistry, eco
nomics, and English.
Somehow, at Stanford the boy
becomes infatuated with study
ing. He soon realizes that he can
never return to the relatively
simple life of a star basketball
player. During the Cards-Bruin
game, he disguises himself as a
Stanford student and slips into

the crowd at half-time.
The real drama of the movie
begins when one of the other
Bruins realize that his team
mate has detected. He resolves
to go back to Stanford with his
triend.
Best scene: the Bruin finally
finds his old teammate after
three weeks of difficult search
in treacherous Stanfordian ter
ritory. I shall never forget the
expression of horror exhibited
on this boy's face when he saw
his friend in a lab coat with a
test tube in one hand and a four
colored in the other.
Xfx Fair Stanford Woman —
wonderful comedy about two
psychology students who take a
fun-loving, good-time, Paly
High chick, Susan Bendover,
and try to transform her into a
Stanford Woman. It is fascinat
ing to watch the change that
takes place in the girl as the
boys handcuff her to a desk in
Meyer Library; force her to
stay in a room by herself on a
Friday night; and subject her to
plastic surgery in order to im
prove her facial structure.
Through these actions, the girl
becomes a nurd, a prude, and a
pretty young lady. In other
words, she becomes a true Stan
ford girl.
One of the most puzzling yet
thought-inspiring aspects of the
film is the way these three char
acteristics come together. Dur
ing the movie, one constantly
asks oneself, "How can such a
pretty girl be so involved with
books and so uninvolved with
boys?"
I suppose one must simply as
sume that this is a fact of Stan
ford life. As long as the sun con
tinues to rise in the morning,
and as long as plants continue to
bloom in the spring, a Stanford
woman will be unlike the aver
age good-looking California
girl.
Best scene: Susan's first ap
pearance in Stanford society af
ter the transformation has
taken place. The two psych stu
dents tell her to run the dish in
tight red and white shorts and a
Stanford tank top. While she is
running, Susan is pursued by
two guys who ask her to come to
their frat party that night.
Susan responded, "If, gen

tlemen, I find myself in a situ
ation in which I am able to
direct myself toward your wor
thy festival, then, with some
luck, you may see me there. Re
alism predicts, however, that it
will be necessary for me to in
dulge in an excessive amount of
studying tonight, as I have three
midterms next week.
The Classroom — well-made
horror film about the day a
crazy Stanford psychology pro
fessor locked 500 Econ. One stu
dents in Dinklespiel Auditorium
in order to conduct an experi
ment. The students change from
nice little boys and girls into
savage primitives, who use
their pens and notebooks as
weapons against each other.
They are unable to stay calm,
knowing that they are losing
valuable study time.
Best scene: the teacher is
first trying to calm the students.
Shivers ran down my spine when
a freshman, in response to the
teacher's cries for order,
yelled, "Order! You want or
der? Order, when I have a calcu
lus test tomorrow, and an Eng
lish paper due the next day? Lis
ten, Prof. Baby, there can be no
order — at least not until I get
back to the red section of Green
Library where I can study.
Stanford Side Story — re
make of the great show by
Arthur Sonheim and Steven
Laurents about the rivalry be
tween the Chems, a rough gang
of Chemistry majors, and the
Reads, a rough bunch of English
majors. Exceptional acting in
the movie by Kathy Stan
tordchickovich, who played the
role ot an English major who
falls in love with a Chem, de
spite the tact that the Chem can
neither read, nor write, nor say
more than three words without
inserting a formula into his
speech.
The choreography of the film
is great, especially, during the
opening scene when the Chems
sing their famous song, "When
you're a Chem, you're a Chem
all the way, from your first
three-colored pen, to your last
Chem lab A. . .
Another noteworthy aspect of
the film is the huge amount of
extras that were used 112 or the big
library dance scenes. I cannot

begin to fathom the amount of
money that was paid to all the
actors who were pretending to
study during these scenes. Un
less, of course, they were really
students that were at the library
to study. But that's impossible,
especially because the film was
made during late spring, when
all college students are obvious
ly frollicking outside.
Hint in Bio 43 — disaster
movie about the day a left
handed guest lecturer came to
Bio 43. Because ot the prof.'s
lefthandedness, some of the pre
meds were unable to see some of
the blackboard. Consequently, a
violent riot ensued.
Best scene: At the end, a sur
viving student looks around at
all the maimed bodies, bloody
notebooks, and crushed pens,
and said pitifully, "If only there
had been ASSU lecture notes."
Ordinary Stanford People —
This movie, which was my fa
vorite of the year, concerns the
conflicts that arose in a Stan
ford dorm when one of the male
inhabitants. Bill Defroshell, is
seen leaving the room of one of
the female inhabitants, De
borah Fairhairedhead, early on
a Sunday morning.
While the flick is extremely
enjoyable, a major flaw lies in
its credibility. As anyone with
the slightest bit of intelligence
knows, intra-dorm sex at Staf
ford is not only unlikely — i't is
non-existent.
Best scene: When Deborah's
friend. Linda Beblondevis, asks
Deborah what she and Bill were
doing all night, Deborah says
naively, "We were just having
an all-night study session, only
without the books."
That's my list of the best
films of the year. If you agree,
great. If not, simply write me a
letter about your complaints.
Just write to: Michael, U.S.A.
Not only will I read your let
ter, I will also give you a re
sponse.
Now I better go call my moth
er so she can tell me again that I
really am the best movie critic
on campus. I have a feeling I am
going to be receiving many com
plaints.

begins when one of the other
Bruins realize that his team

Xfx Fair Stanford Woman —
wonderful comedy about two
psychology students who take a
fun-loving, good-time, Paly
High chick, Susan Bendover,
and try to transform her into a
Stanford Woman. It is fascinat
ing to watch the change that
takes place in the girl as the
boys handcuff her to a desk in
Meyer Library; force her to
stay in a room by herself on a
Friday night; and subject her to
plastic surgery in order to im
prove her facial structure.
Through these actions, the girl
becomes a nurd, a prude, and a
pretty young lady. In other
words, she becomes a true Stan
ford girl.
One of the most puzzling yet
thought-inspiring aspects of the
film is the way these three char
acteristics come together. Dur
ing the movie, one constantly
asks oneself, "How can such a
pretty girl be so involved with
books and so uninvolved with
boys?"
I suppose one must simply as
sume that this is a fact of Stan
ford life. As long as the sun con
tinues to rise in the morning,
and as long as plants continue to
bloom in the spring, a Stanford
woman will be unlike the aver
age good-looking California
girl.
Best scene: Susan's first ap
pearance in Stanford society af
ter the transformation has
taken place. The two psych stu
dents tell her to run the dish in
tight red and white shorts and a
Stanford tank top. While she is
running, Susan is pursued by
two guys who ask her to come to
their frat party that night.
Susan responded, "If, gen

tlemen, I find myself in a situ
ation in which I am able to
direct myself toward your wor
thy festival, then, with some
luck, you may see me there. Re
alism predicts, however, that it
will be necessary for me to in
dulge in an excessive amount of
studying tonight, as I have three
midterms next week.
The Classroom — well-made
horror film about the day a
crazy Stanford psychology pro
fessor locked 500 Econ. One stu
dents in Dinklespiel Auditorium
in order to conduct an experi
ment. The students change from
nice little boys and girls into
savage primitives, who use
their pens and notebooks as
weapons against each other.
They are unable to stay calm,
knowing that they are losing
valuable study time.
Best scene: the teacher is
first trying to calm the students.
Shivers ran down my spine when
a freshman, in response to the
teacher's cries for order,
yelled, "Order! You want or
der? Order, when I have a calcu
lus test tomorrow, and an Eng
lish paper due the next day? Lis
ten, Prof. Baby, there can be no
order — at least not until I get
back to the red section of Green
Library where I can study.
Stanford Side Story — re
make of the great show by
Arthur Sonheim and Steven
Laurents about the rivalry be
tween the Chems, a rough gang
of Chemistry majors, and the
Reads, a rough bunch of English
majors. Exceptional acting in
the movie by Kathy Stan
tordchickovich, who played the
role ot an English major who
falls in love with a Chem, de
spite the tact that the Chem can
neither read, nor write, nor say
more than three words without
inserting a formula into his
speech.
The choreography of the film
is great, especially, during the
opening scene when the Chems
sing their famous song, "When
you're a Chem, you're a Chem
all the way, from your first
three-colored pen, to your last
Chem lab A. . .
Another noteworthy aspect of
the film is the huge amount of
extras that were used 112 or the big
library dance scenes. I cannot

begin to fathom the amount of
money that was paid to all the
actors who were pretending to
study during these scenes. Un
less, of course, they were really
students that were at the library
to study. But that's impossible,
especially because the film was
made during late spring, when
all college students are obvious
ly frollicking outside.
Hint in Bio 43 — disaster
movie about the day a left
handed guest lecturer came to
Bio 43. Because ot the prof.'s
lefthandedness, some of the pre
meds were unable to see some of
the blackboard. Consequently, a
violent riot ensued.
Best scene: At the end, a sur
viving student looks around at
all the maimed bodies, bloody
notebooks, and crushed pens,
and said pitifully, "If only there
had been ASSU lecture notes."
Ordinary Stanford People —
This movie, which was my fa
vorite of the year, concerns the
conflicts that arose in a Stan
ford dorm when one of the male
inhabitants. Bill Defroshell, is
seen leaving the room of one of
the female inhabitants, De
borah Fairhairedhead, early on
a Sunday morning.
While the flick is extremely
enjoyable, a major flaw lies in
its credibility. As anyone with
the slightest bit of intelligence
knows, intra-dorm sex at Staf
ford is not only unlikely — i't is
non-existent.
Best scene: When Deborah's
friend. Linda Beblondevis, asks
Deborah what she and Bill were
doing all night, Deborah says
naively, "We were just having
an all-night study session, only
without the books."
That's my list of the best

great. If not, simply write me a

However, since I am considered
the best critic on campus — if
you do not believe me, ask my

enrich you with my opinions on
the best Metro-Stantordyn-

The Rnokhunter — intense
drama about what happens to a
cocky young UCLA basketball
player when he comes to Stan
ford for a game. At Stanford, the
player discovers more than sim
ply a bunch of tall Cardinals.
Rather, he discovers love . . .
that is, love of chemistry, eco
nomics, and English.
Somehow, at Stanford the boy
becomes infatuated with study
ing. He soon realizes that he can
never return to the relatively
simple life of a star basketball
player. During the Cards-Bruin
game, he disguises himself as a
Stanford student and slips into

the crowd at half-time.
The real drama of the movie

becomes a nurd, a prude, and a
pretty young lady. In other
words, she becomes a true Stan
ford girl.
One of the most puzzling yet
thought-inspiring aspects of the
film is the way these three char
acteristics come together. Dur
ing the movie, one constantly
asks oneself, "How can such a
pretty girl be so involved with
books and so uninvolved with
boys?"
I suppose one must simply as
sume that this is a fact of Stan
ford life. As long as the sun con
tinues to rise in the morning,
and as long as plants continue to
bloom in the spring, a Stanford
woman will be unlike the aver
age good-looking California
girl.
Best scene: Susan's first ap
pearance in Stanford society af
ter the transformation has
taken place. The two psych stu
dents tell her to run the dish in
tight red and white shorts and a
Stanford tank top. While she is
running, Susan is pursued by
two guys who ask her to come to
their frat party that night.
Susan responded, "If, gen

tlemen, I find myself in a situ
ation in which I am able to
direct myself toward your wor
thy festival, then, with some
luck, you may see me there. Re
alism predicts, however, that it
will be necessary for me to in
dulge in an excessive amount of
studying tonight, as I have three
midterms next week.
The Classroom — well-made
horror film about the day a
crazy Stanford psychology pro
fessor locked 500 Econ. One stu
dents in Dinklespiel Auditorium
in order to conduct an experi
ment. The students change from
nice little boys and girls into
savage primitives, who use
their pens and notebooks as
weapons against each other.
They are unable to stay calm,
knowing that they are losing
valuable study time.
Best scene: the teacher is
first trying to calm the students.
Shivers ran down my spine when
a freshman, in response to the
teacher's cries for order,
yelled, "Order! You want or
der? Order, when I have a calcu
lus test tomorrow, and an Eng
lish paper due the next day? Lis
ten, Prof. Baby, there can be no
order — at least not until I get
back to the red section of Green
Library where I can study.
Stanford Side Story — re
make of the great show by
Arthur Sonheim and Steven
Laurents about the rivalry be
tween the Chems, a rough gang
of Chemistry majors, and the
Reads, a rough bunch of English
majors. Exceptional acting in
the movie by Kathy Stan
tordchickovich, who played the
role ot an English major who
falls in love with a Chem, de
spite the tact that the Chem can
neither read, nor write, nor say
more than three words without
inserting a formula into his
speech.
The choreography of the film
is great, especially, during the
opening scene when the Chems
sing their famous song, "When
you're a Chem, you're a Chem
all the way, from your first
three-colored pen, to your last
Chem lab A. . .
Another noteworthy aspect of
the film is the huge amount of
extras that were used 112 or the big
library dance scenes. I cannot

begin to fathom the amount of
money that was paid to all the
actors who were pretending to
study during these scenes. Un
less, of course, they were really
students that were at the library
to study. But that's impossible,
especially because the film was
made during late spring, when
all college students are obvious
ly frollicking outside.
Hint in Bio 43 — disaster
movie about the day a left
handed guest lecturer came to
Bio 43. Because ot the prof.'s
lefthandedness, some of the pre
meds were unable to see some of
the blackboard. Consequently, a
violent riot ensued.
Best scene: At the end, a sur
viving student looks around at
all the maimed bodies, bloody
notebooks, and crushed pens,
and said pitifully, "If only there
had been ASSU lecture notes."
Ordinary Stanford People —
This movie, which was my fa
vorite of the year, concerns the
conflicts that arose in a Stan
ford dorm when one of the male
inhabitants. Bill Defroshell, is
seen leaving the room of one of
the female inhabitants, De
borah Fairhairedhead, early on
a Sunday morning.
While the flick is extremely
enjoyable, a major flaw lies in
its credibility. As anyone with
the slightest bit of intelligence
knows, intra-dorm sex at Staf
ford is not only unlikely — i't is
non-existent.
Best scene: When Deborah's
friend. Linda Beblondevis, asks
Deborah what she and Bill were
doing all night, Deborah says
naively, "We were just having
an all-night study session, only
without the books."
That's my list of the best
films of the year. If you agree,
great. If not, simply write me a
letter about your complaints.
Just write to: Michael, U.S.A.
Not only will I read your let
ter, I will also give you a re
sponse.
Now I better go call my moth
er so she can tell me again that I
really am the best movie critic
on campus. I have a feeling I am
going to be receiving many com
plaints.
