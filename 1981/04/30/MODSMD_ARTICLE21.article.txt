Gun rebuttal
In David Miller's column on
handguns (Daily, Apr. 27) he
claims that, to prove the effec
tiveness of gun control, I com
pared the murdef rates in Wash
ington. D C., and in Texas. This
is simply a lie. At no point in my
column nor in my rebuttal to his
column did I ever make any
such comparison.
What I did say was that the
handgun ban in Washington,
D C., reduced violent crime by
25 percent according to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors' govern
ment report. In a separate para
graph, I went on to say that the
conference found that the drop
in violent crime in the Capitol
would have been even more dra
matic if handguns could not be
brought in from the rest of the
country. As an example, I cited
that the gun used to shoot Presi
dent Ronald Reagan was legally
purchased in Texas and was
brought into Washington by
John Hinckley. The only cross
comparison made of the crime
rates in Washington, D C., and
in Texas was made by Miller
himself.
After comparing the crime
rates in these two areas, David
Miller then spends the majority
of his column showing why this
comparison is not valid. Setting
up a straw man and then knock
ing it down has never been con
sidered admirable journalism,
but for Miller to claim that I was
the builder of this decrepit
straw man is nothing short of

dishonest journalism. If you
cannot write responsibly, do not
write at all.

Nuclear drill?
Since the recent earthquake
drill was performed with con
summate skill and finesse and
also received excellent public
ity, I would suggest that an
equally impressive, well-at
tended and well-publicized nu
clear war drill take place on this
campus.
All participants should keep
in mind that at the present time
34 Russian nuclear warheads
are aimed at the Bay Area. A
one-megaton nuclear warhead
would have about 70 times the
explosive force of the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima in Japan,
August 6, 1945. The resulting
firestorm would cover several
hundred square miles. There
would be no hospitals; very few
professional medical people
would be around to help sur

vivors. Most burns would be
third degree, and there would be
widespread radiation sickness.
I wonder what sort of drill we
would have here at Stanford. I
know that an alert would occur
as briefly as five minutes before
the arrival of missiles from the
USSR. Perhaps the best drill
would be a campus-wide demon
stration of everyone in our com
munity — everyone with signs
and banners demanding a freeze
now on all nuclear weap
ons/delivery systems research.
No profits, however
enormous, are worth the lives of
my children. Let us release
from the fear of death in nuclear
war all the children of this beau
tiful and mysterious planet —
the kids whom we adults now
hold hostage, whose lives we en
danger with the mad escalation
of the arms race. Let us declare
the lives of those children sa
cred and renounce the nuclear
war scenarios of Haig and his
gang of murderers. Let us say
Yes to lite.
