# Community energy planning, production, urged by speaker

Future power plants may be built on small
streams and creeks, providing electricity tor
just a tew families or small businesses, said
David Morris, ot the Institute for Local Self
Reliance last Tuesday. Decentralization ot
energy production was the topic ot his lecture
given here as the first in a series of presenta
tions to be held on the dynamics of community
energy planning.
Speaking to a group of civil engineering stu
dents and interested community members,
Morris said, "It is now technologically and ec
onomically feasible to construct and maintain
neighborhood power plants." He claimed that
this type of decentralization wil be the most ef
fective method of meeting present and future
energy needs, once the political obstacles of
government-supported electrical monopolies
are overcome.
Morris traced the historical development of
power production from small local sources in
the late 19th century to the massive plants of
today. He suggested that the centralization ot
electrical energy suppliers was feasible as
long as fuel costs remained relatively low.
With the unprecedented rise ot petroleum
prices in the 19705, however, the
tion and construction costs of building a huge
plant became economically unsound.
The process of building such a plant takes
from 10 to 12 years — within that time the sys

tem may become technologically obsolete, as
well as cost-ineffective. Morris also em
phasized the superior ability of smaller sys
tems to effectively "cogenerate," or produce
usable energy from the heat waste of manufac
turing electrical power. Not only is cogenera
tion economically desirable, it can be an
ecologically-sound method of maintaining the
highest possible efficiency from an increasing
ly-limited supply of natural resources.
Morris stressed the principle of integrating
all kinds of separate systems into a "closed
loop"; tor example, human waste trom Palo
Alto could be used to fertilize enough vegeta
bles to maintain the entire community. Morris
said that it is also possible {(/"mine" cities'
mineral wastes — such as copper and zinc —
for a soundly profitable enterprise
According to Morris, the regulation ot de
centralized power sources is probably best
maintained on the municipal level. Although
apartment-sized electrical plants have already
proven to be economically feasible in provid
ing for as few as three households, cities have
the resources for going into collective public
bond debt tor initial construction financing.
The Community Erfergy Planning lecture
series at Stanford will continue for the next
five weeks, and will include such topics as fed
eral energy policy and a case study of current
Santa Clara County programs.
