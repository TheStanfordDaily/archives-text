## 'Excal' hits the heart 
### Steve Vineberg 
John Boorman is a paradox.
He is an extraordinarily tal
ented director who has made
very few good movies; the best
sequences in his most memo
rable films (Point Blank and
Deliverance) demonstrate such
a strong instinct for composi
tion and editing that they seem
to be the work of a wizard, and
yet his most fatuous pictures —
the science-fiction tale Zardoz
and the occult thriller The Ex
orcist II The Heretic — contain
subject matter that by its na
ture demands magic tricks.
This division in Boorman may
go a long way toward explaining
his new Excalibur, a strange
fantasy about the reign of King
Arthur that is by turns magnif
icent and preposterous, lumi
nous and opaque.
The Arthurian legend is a fa
vorite among writers (Ex
calibur's screenplay, by
Boorman and Rospo Pallen
berg, is derived from the
earliest published version, Sir
Thomas Malory's Le Morte
d'Arthur) but despite its ob
vious filmworthiness, few mov
iemakers have attempted it.
Besides some threadbare cos
tume epics, the only movie fash
ioned from this material that I
can think of is the 1967 Camelot,
Joshua Logan's unfortunate
screen adaptation of the Broad
way musical, which had nothing
to recommend it except the lyr
ical Guinnevere of Vanessa
Redgrave. (Even the Lerner
and Loewe songs didn't help,
since no one in the cast could
sing them.) Boorman's film is
extremely ambitious: it encom
passes the entire £tory — from
Arthur's conception in an
adulterous affair between King
Uther and Ygerne, the 'wife of
his enemy, through the destruc
tion of the Round Table — in 2 x /z
hours. Indeed, that is one of the
basic problems with the movie:
it feels compressed, and nar
rative shifts are often so abrupt
that unless one has boned up on
the particulars of the myth
before seeing the film, one is
likely to be contused about
where battles take place and
who is fighting whom over what
issue. The bold boy wHo at
taches himself to Launcelot
grows up so quickly that one
may not realize that he is the
same Sir Percival who seeks the
Holy Grail.
However, Excalibur is not
just the whim of a fool who is
rushing in where wiser direc
tors have hesitated to tread.
There are scenes in it so
glorious that, Respite its
awkward structure "and muddy
transitions, the great myth sud
denly shines forth. The Holy
Grail sequence has clarity and
power: when Percival (feeling
ly played by Paul Geoffrey),
crosses the drawbridge and the
blessed chalice stands revealed
to him at last, the faith of the
questing knights is justified to
us because this image is so over
poweringly beautiful. Even
more successful is the passage
that shows us the final rallying
of Arthur's knights after the
wine of the Grail has revived
him. As the remaining repre
sentatives of Arthur's chivalric
dream ride through the coun

tryside, trees burst into flower;
the metaphor — which owes
much to Alex Thompson's
cinematography — conveys
what the resurgence of the
Arthurian ideal, however brief,
means to England.
Boorman charts the dissipa
tion of Arthur's rule more im
aginativly and evocatively than
he does its growth. The moment
when young Arthur (Nigel
Terry) extracts the sword Ex
calibur from the rock in which
Uther lodged it before his death
is disappointingly lacking in res
onance, and we aren't per
mitted to see how this youthful
dreamer monarch conducts the
search for knights who can as
sist him in building the noble
England he desires. Jhere is a
majestic shot of the assembled
knights, arms raised against a
star-showered sky, and our first
glimpse of the Round Table —
looking immense and glassy —
is awesome, but how we arrived
at this triumphant note is not
clear.
The weakest section of the
film is the initial one: the Uther-
Ygerne romance. The writing is
so ridiculous, and the acting, ex
cept for Nicol Williamson's
Merlin, so histrionic that there
is an awful moment when the
viewer asks himself if what he is
watching is intentionally bad —
high camp. When Ygerne
dances for Uther and his sol
diers, he hisses, "I must have
her!" and one of his companions
(never identified), eyes
flashing, reorts, "Are you mad?
The Alliance!" — while we wait
for Tony Curtis to ride in on a
white steed and render the lines
in Brooklynese. Only the prorq
ise of more imagery like that of
the opening battle scene, in
which horses exhale an other
worldly mist that might be the
breath of dragons, keeps us
watching, fortunately; and
there is a great deal of it later,
catching us up in the romantic
whirl of the legend.

The classical, painterly bat
tle tableaux (which sometimes
suggest Kurosawa I, Anthony
Pratt's exquisite designs, and
the scenes in which the film is
suddenly swept into a fairy tale
grandeur that matches our
childhood fantasies compensate
for many of the flaws in Ex
calibur. What is not easy to for
give, however, is the inade
quacy of the acting. Williamson
is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin, Geoffrey is excellent,
and Helen Mirren, as the rival
sorceress Morgana, has some
high witchy moments — she
works her beautifully trained
mouth around the most de
licious-sounding charm I've
heard in any movie since The
Court -Jester. But most of the
other principals are dwarfed by
the stature of the characters
they are playing. Nigel Terry
reads his lines well — even mov
ingly — but he is not a star, and
the role of England's most pas
sionate king certainly needs a
star to till it. Cherie Lunghi
(Guinnevere) and Nicholas Clay
(Launcelot) don't even speak
well; when they make love, the
only reverberation they cause is
a general restlessness in the au
dience.
It used to be fashionable to
jeer at large-scale movies with
something of the ridiculous
about them, even if, like Hawaii
and The Bible, they also at
tained moments of sublimity.
Excalibur could be another such
film. It's easy to giggle so much
at its cockeyed, melodramatic
low points — like Uther's seduc
tion of Ygerne — that you aren't
prepared for some of
Boorman's stunning effects —
like Merlin's imprisonment in
ice. Boorman should be given
his due: he's freakishly gifted.
And bizarre as it is. Excalibur
is, in the final analysis, not only
a visual treat but emotionally
satisfying: in his unpredictable
way. Boorman has reached the
heart of the Arthurian legend.

when young Arthur (Nigel
Terry) extracts the sword Ex
calibur from the rock in which
Uther lodged it before his death
is disappointingly lacking in res
onance, and we aren't per
mitted to see how this youthful
dreamer monarch conducts the
search for knights who can as
sist him in building the noble
England he desires. Jhere is a
majestic shot of the assembled
knights, arms raised against a
star-showered sky, and our first
glimpse of the Round Table —
looking immense and glassy —
is awesome, but how we arrived
at this triumphant note is not
clear.
The weakest section of the
film is the initial one: the Uther-
Ygerne romance. The writing is
so ridiculous, and the acting, ex
cept for Nicol Williamson's
Merlin, so histrionic that there
is an awful moment when the
viewer asks himself if what he is
watching is intentionally bad —
high camp. When Ygerne
dances for Uther and his sol
diers, he hisses, "I must have
her!" and one of his companions
(never identified), eyes
flashing, reorts, "Are you mad?
The Alliance!" — while we wait
for Tony Curtis to ride in on a
white steed and render the lines
in Brooklynese. Only the prorq
ise of more imagery like that of
the opening battle scene, in
which horses exhale an other
worldly mist that might be the
breath of dragons, keeps us
watching, fortunately; and
there is a great deal of it later,
catching us up in the romantic
whirl of the legend.

The classical, painterly bat
tle tableaux (which sometimes
suggest Kurosawa I, Anthony
Pratt's exquisite designs, and
the scenes in which the film is
suddenly swept into a fairy tale
grandeur that matches our
childhood fantasies compensate
for many of the flaws in Ex
calibur. What is not easy to for
give, however, is the inade
quacy of the acting. Williamson
is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin, Geoffrey is excellent,
and Helen Mirren, as the rival
sorceress Morgana, has some
high witchy moments — she
works her beautifully trained
mouth around the most de
licious-sounding charm I've
heard in any movie since The
Court -Jester. But most of the
other principals are dwarfed by
the stature of the characters
they are playing. Nigel Terry
reads his lines well — even mov
ingly — but he is not a star, and
the role of England's most pas
sionate king certainly needs a
star to till it. Cherie Lunghi
(Guinnevere) and Nicholas Clay
(Launcelot) don't even speak
well; when they make love, the
only reverberation they cause is
a general restlessness in the au
dience.
It used to be fashionable to
jeer at large-scale movies with
something of the ridiculous
about them, even if, like Hawaii
and The Bible, they also at
tained moments of sublimity.
Excalibur could be another such
film. It's easy to giggle so much
at its cockeyed, melodramatic
low points — like Uther's seduc
tion of Ygerne — that you aren't
prepared for some of
Boorman's stunning effects —
like Merlin's imprisonment in
ice. Boorman should be given
his due: he's freakishly gifted.
And bizarre as it is. Excalibur
is, in the final analysis, not only
a visual treat but emotionally
satisfying: in his unpredictable
way. Boorman has reached the
heart of the Arthurian legend.
John Boorman is a paradox.
He is an extraordinarily tal
ented director who has made
very few good movies; the best
sequences in his most memo
rable films (Point Blank and
Deliverance) demonstrate such
a strong instinct for composi
tion and editing that they seem
to be the work of a wizard, and
yet his most fatuous pictures —
the science-fiction tale Zardoz
and the occult thriller The Ex
orcist II The Heretic — contain
subject matter that by its na
ture demands magic tricks.
This division in Boorman may
go a long way toward explaining
his new Excalibur, a strange
fantasy about the reign of King
Arthur that is by turns magnif
icent and preposterous, lumi
nous and opaque.
The Arthurian legend is a fa
vorite among writers (Ex
calibur's screenplay, by
Boorman and Rospo Pallen
berg, is derived from the
earliest published version, Sir
Thomas Malory's Le Morte
d'Arthur) but despite its ob
vious filmworthiness, few mov
iemakers have attempted it.
Besides some threadbare cos
tume epics, the only movie fash
ioned from this material that I
can think of is the 1967 Camelot,
Joshua Logan's unfortunate
screen adaptation of the Broad
way musical, which had nothing
to recommend it except the lyr
ical Guinnevere of Vanessa
Redgrave. (Even the Lerner
and Loewe songs didn't help,
since no one in the cast could
sing them.) Boorman's film is
extremely ambitious: it encom
passes the entire £tory — from
Arthur's conception in an
adulterous affair between King
Uther and Ygerne, the 'wife of
his enemy, through the destruc
tion of the Round Table — in 2 x /z
hours. Indeed, that is one of the
basic problems with the movie:
it feels compressed, and nar
rative shifts are often so abrupt
that unless one has boned up on
the particulars of the myth
before seeing the film, one is
likely to be contused about
where battles take place and
who is fighting whom over what
issue. The bold boy wHo at
taches himself to Launcelot
grows up so quickly that one
may not realize that he is the
same Sir Percival who seeks the
Holy Grail.
However, Excalibur is not
just the whim of a fool who is
rushing in where wiser direc
tors have hesitated to tread.
There are scenes in it so
glorious that, Respite its
awkward structure "and muddy
transitions, the great myth sud
denly shines forth. The Holy
Grail sequence has clarity and
power: when Percival (feeling
ly played by Paul Geoffrey),
crosses the drawbridge and the
blessed chalice stands revealed
to him at last, the faith of the
questing knights is justified to
us because this image is so over
poweringly beautiful. Even
more successful is the passage
that shows us the final rallying
of Arthur's knights after the
wine of the Grail has revived
him. As the remaining repre
sentatives of Arthur's chivalric
dream ride through the coun

tryside, trees burst into flower;
the metaphor — which owes
much to Alex Thompson's
cinematography — conveys
what the resurgence of the
Arthurian ideal, however brief,
means to England.
