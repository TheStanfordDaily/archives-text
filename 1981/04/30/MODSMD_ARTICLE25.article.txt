In his recent Rolling Stone
interview, Ringo Starr called
Caveman the "first silent
talkie." It's done in a fifteen
word grunted language
which the audience learns as
the movie goes on (at one
point the grunting cavemen
run into another tribe which
improbably speaks English,
so all the words get trans
lated tor the dumber
viewers). Nice concept.
Caveman is a family mov
ie, with some harmless sex
jokes to keep the parents
happy, a slight parody (on
everything) to keep the half;
intelligent happy, and a little
morality to keep the kids in
line.
Scrawny Ringo Starr
caveman lusts after Barbara
Bach cavewoman, but
Barbara only has eyes for big
John Matuszak caveman.
Poor Ringo caveman! He
gets thrown out of the cave
for trying to rape Barbara
cavewoman. but then'uses
his wits to become head of a
rival tribe. Sweet but flat
chested Shelley Long
cavewoman loves Ringo
caveman, but Ringo
caveman only wants stacked
Barbara cavewoman. Little
Ringo caveman beats up big
Matuszak caveman, and
Barbara cavewoman hugs
Ringo caveman, but Ringo
caveman now knows what
true love is and throws
Barbara cavewoman in a pile
of dinosaur shit.
Ringo caveman goes off to
cave with Shelley
cavewoman. Nice object les
son for the kids.
Ringo actor and Barbara
actress tell in love making
this flick, and they got mar
ried last weekend. Nice.pro
motion, even if it doesn't

quite equal Liz and Dick.
Would Dick ever throw Liz
in a pile of dinosaur shit?
Would you or your kids pay
to see cavemen step in
dinosaur shit?
Actually, parts of
Caveman are rather charm
ing. The credits tell us that it
was "written" by Carl Got
tlieb (who also directed) and
Rudy de Luca; "costumes"
were by Robert Fletcher
(the costumes turn out to be
animal skins). It was filmed
near Puerto Vallarta, and it
looks like most of the budget
was spent getting the cast
drunk enough to mug its way
through. The movie's at its
most likeable when it's de
liberately tacky: the fun
niest scenes are of a cheap
dinosaur cut-out crowing at

an even cheaper-looking cut
out of the moon.
There are a lot of good
jokes and interesting ideas:
the cavemen invent music,
learn how to hunt, and dis
cover some marvelous giant
weeds which get even
Matuszak stoned. A tried
pterodactyl egg is meal
enough for the whole tribe.
The music (cribbing themes
from 10, 2001, Bridge Over
the River Kwai, and The
I.one Ranker) is clever. The
cast obviously had a great
time putting this one togeth
er.
Unfortunately, the movie
gets wrapped up in de
liberate vulgarity. Mel
Brooks did the fart jokes bet
ter, Cheech and Chong did

the looks-like-shit-tastes
like-shit routines better, and
no earlier comic was stupid
enough to depict graphically
what happens when a giant
cave mosquito gets squashed
on Dennis Quaid's face. Not
nice.
Not funny, either. One
hopes Ringo Starr and John
Matuszak. both of whom ap
pear to be inspired comic ac
tors. can get in some better
movies. (Barbara Bach is
only slightly better silent
than talking; she should stay
back at Ringo's California
cave.) It's a shame, because
Caveman has an unusual and
sometimes winning concept.
Unfortunately, the movie
only makes it halfway out of
the Gross Age.
