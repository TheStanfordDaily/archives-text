If Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Sul
livan were alive today, and
found themselves strolling
along Broadway in New York
City, they might be rather sur
prised, and even a bit scandal
ized, to see Linda Ronstadt and
Rex Smith in a modern produc
tion of The Pirates of Penzance,
complete with electronic music
and policemen who act like key
stone cops. But it the two
bewhiskered old gentlemen
were reincarnated on the Stan
ford campus, they would un
doubtedly find the Stanford
Savoyards' production ot
Pirates more to their liking.
The Savoyards have wisely
decided to ignore the slam-bang
slapstick and physical shtick of
the Broadway production in fa
vor of a quieter, more under
stated irony. Although we think
of Mssrs. Gilbert and Sullivan
as the very embodiment of Vic
torian England, and expect
their characters to strut about
like stuffy prigs and self-satis
fied imperialists, it's important
to remember that the humor in

their operettas is intentional,
and when Pirates premiered in
New York in 1897, it was proba
bly received in the same spirit
of fun and greeted with as much
good-natured laughter as it was
Sunday night at Dinkelspiel.
The premise is so ridiculous,
it doesn't need to be propped up
by physical comedy or a jazzy
score. Frederic, the delightfully
straight-laced son of a
nobleman who has been inden
tured to a band of pirates (his
father really specified "pilots,"
and the mistake is that of
Frederic's hard-of-hearing
nurse), has reached his 21st
birthday. He is deposited on the
rocky coast of Cornwall, where
the pirates encounter a bevy of
20 young lovelies who are the
wards ot a "modern Major-Gen
eral." The pirates, of course,
see a golden opportunity for
marriage — there is no mention
of a fate worse than death, since
these pirates are of a very ethi
cal sort: they never attack
vessels weaker than their own.
and they never harm orphans.
To their dismay, the Major-

General reveals himself to be an
orphan. "Oh. drat it!" the
pirates cry in unison. Mean
while, Frederic has met and
fallen in love with Mabel, one of
the Major-General's daughters
who has an eye for male beauty.
Suffice it to say that by the sec
ond act, there are 10 pirates. 10
policemen and 20 nubile maid
ens on stage, and everything
works out just tine in the end.
The plot is so silly, and the in
congruity between the larce
nous pirate band and the score
of pinafored daughters so ludi
crous (particularly when the
whole group bursts into one of
Gilbert & Sullivan's clever little
ditties), that the show would be
tunny with a bare minimum ot
staging.
Nevertheless, the Stanford
Savoyards have provided a
splendid background for an
equally fine cast: Kevin Skiles
(Frederic) and Carolene Winter
(Mabel) overact delightfully,
and Curtis Loer. as the Major-
General, is the very archetype
of the mad Englishman. Both
Skiles and Winter have loud, lus

ty voices, and if Loer is some
times hard-pressed to fill
Dinkelspiel with his voice, it's
understandable,given therapid
tire lyrics he must deliver.
The choreography and stag
ing are clever throughout, and
help to gloss over lulls in the
plot; one inspired moment oc
curs when the daughters, pre
paring to bathe their feet in the
sea. hop about the stage in sur
prise when confronted by
Frederic.
The effective sets by Wendell
Cole look like enormous rendi
tions of vegetables; the one mis
hap occurred when the rear
projected clouds took a sudden
nosedive into the blue Atlantic.
Costumes, particularly the
girls' frilly creations, are befit
ting ot Victorian prudery, al
though the Pirates are just a
wee bit too well-dressed — a red
sash around a silk Pierre Cardin
shirt does not a pirate make.
All in all. Gilbert and Sullivan
would approve of the Savoyards'
production, and the lack ot a
Linda Ronstadt wouldn't have
tazed them a bit.
