# 'Heaven's Gate': 2 hrs. now, but that doesn't make it good
## 
### Jim Mattson 
After all the negative publicity that
>aven's Gate has received, it would be
nice to report that the doomsayers of
tour months ago wouldn't know a great
movie from a hole in the ground It would
be nice to report a lot of things But they
get angry at me here when I make things
up, so I teel bound to tell the truth
Heaven's Gate stinks.
Extensive editing has produced a mov
ie that runs a little over two hours It
seems much longer. Michael Cimino,
who directed, has proved that Einstein
was right — time slows down on the sur
face of a swiftly tailing object
There's so much wrong with Heaven *
Gate that maybe the best place to begin
is by discussing what's good about it So.
in descending order:
The photography, by Vilmos Zsigmond
(who photographed Close Encounters).
is striking, though a little too heavily in
fluenced by the dust and diffusion school
of pretty image-making. Zsigmond gives
the movie a consistency, and a level of
quality, which it needs quite badly
Isabelle Huppert, as Ella Watson, a
small-time madame in a small-time
town, takes a stereotyped character and
does something very nice with her Hup
pert is the only actor who seems com
fortable in her surroundings. She moves
as if she's spent a lot of time in log
whorehouses, which is exactly what's re
quired of her. Her lines, however, aren't
too good; maybe Cimino figured that
since she has an accent she could get
away with lines like "Do vou reallv think

I'm pretty" 1 " (Repeated later on the
soundtrack in case the audience forgot )
Cimino seems to have read all the re
views ot The Deer Hunter that described
him as a genius with crowd scenes. There
are so many crowds in Heaven's Gate
that even Wyoming begins to look a little
cramped But before the movie gets to
Wyoming there's a prologue — with hun
dreds of people in it, of course — set at a
Harvard commencement exercise After
the ceremony, the students participate
in an afternoon dance in a sunny court
yard The dance is wonderfully athletic,
and the dancers spin about a huge oak
tree as if they were being chased by their
own educations The scene goes on about
three times too long, but it reveals a di
rectorial tightness that the rest ot the
movie lacks For the last time in the
movie, we know who the characters are.
what they are doing, and why they are
doing it
The last bit which 1 can commend
wholeheartedly (there are probably oth
ers. but I don't intend to go back and find
out > takes place at the prairie town skat
ing rink, called the • Heaven's Gate."
It's never clear why anyone would call a
skating rink "Heaven's Gate." but it
sure makes a neat title for a movie.
Betore the skating begins, a fiddler goes
out and makes a few passes around the
floor while the crowd watches. The mo
ment is almost magical — the teenaged
fiddle player radiates a cockiness, and a
good nature, that makes him a perfect
complement tor the scene's fluid camera

work Cimino is once again in control of
his tale.
Control, or lack thereot. is Heaven's
Gat, s main problem The movie's a
mess Scene after scene starts nowhere
and goes nowhere. Characters have sud
den shifts in personality. People are
murdered tor no comprehensible rea
son Ella Watson, for example, is killed
in an ambush two minutes betore the end
of the movie I can t think of anv reason,
on any narrative or thematic level, that
this character should be wiped out (If
you have any suggestions, please write,
care of the Daily.)
At the center of the movie is the Kris
Kristofferson character. James Averill.
The first thing we find out about him is
that he's a Harvard graduate Then, we
tind out that 20 years later he is the sher
iff of Johnson County. Wyoming. We
never find out how he got to Wyoming, or
what a rich man is doing riding around on
the mudflats.
We never find out about a lot of things.
The solution to the darkest mystery of all
lies not in the movie but in Cimino's
head: Why was this movie made in the
tirst place 0 What is he trying to tell us°
Why should we care 0 In the course of two
hours. Heaven's Gate moves from funny,
pretty pointlessness to ugly, violent
pointlessness
Heaven 's Gate might be the world's
most elaborate rhetorical question. If
Cimino knows the answer to it, he's not
telling anyone. In his effort to make
more than a western, he's created less
than a movie.
