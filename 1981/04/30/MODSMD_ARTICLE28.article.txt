# Leave James alone
## 
### Tom Casciato 
I used to love James Taylor
cause he had had a nervous
breakdown, and had been a drug
addict, and he wrote all those
haunting songs. It was fun being
haunted.
Sweet Hab\ Amies and Mud
Slide Slim and the Hlue
Hori;on (1970 and 1971, respec
tively! were great records —
smart lyrics, sharp, it under
stated, playing, and some great
melodies. Pretty arttul. actual
ly.
But James gave up on art
somewhere around (iorilla. He
started doing songs like "How
Sweet It Is," and I thought he
was a sell-out. He began making
the kind of pop records critics
call "finely crafted," when they
mean "finely crafted and that's
about it." He also got married,
had a couple kids, and settled
down You could hear him settl
ing down right there on the rec
ords.
Gone was the quiet tragedy of
"Fire and Rain." the wist
fulness of "Riding On A Rail
road." the downright sadness
that made "You Can Close Your
Eyes" so much more than just a
pretty song
These were replaced with
gentle domesticity ("Sarah
Maria"), harmless pop ("Show
er the People," "Your Smiling
Face,") and lots of remakes
("How Sweet It Is," "Handy
Man," "Day Tripper") — in
short, about a decade of pleas
antly dull music.
On record anyway. In con
cert, Taylor has always played

with the kind of bluesy drive
that's missing on his records.
He sings hard, gives his ace
backup players lots of chances
to stretch out. and generally
gives like there's no tomorrow.
His new album. Dad Loves His
Work, and his concert last Sun
day at Berkeley's Greek
Theatre, make the dichotomy
between his recorded and his
live work more apparent than
ever.
I hid Loves His Work might as
well have been pronounced
D O.A. as soon as it got to your
local record store. "Her Town
Too," a duet with John David
Souther, is pretty enough, but
it's just a little too cool. While
Souther has one of the best
voices in the business, he uses it
in that ludicroulsy angst-ridden.
Eagles-like manner that makes
you want to set his hair on fire so
at least he might be awake while
he sings.
"Stand and Fight," a song
that begs to be rocked hard, is
held together by acoustic guitar
and congas — this version would
have been better titled "Sit and
Stare."
But wait a minute. I had all
kinds of cute things to say about
how bad this record is, but why
waste time critiquing a pop
album as it it were the Sistine
Chapel? Why expect tragedy
and pathos? The poor guy
sounds a lot happier than he was
on Street Habx ■James — why
complain that he isn't suffering
enough any more? Why should
he suffer tor me?
Rock fans, and especially
rock critics, are too often
middle class, armchair thrill
seekers who expect their heroes
to fight their spiritual battles
for them. We spend our nights
on the street with Bruce Spring
steen. We love so hard and hurt
so bad right along with Jackson
Browne.
But the thrills are not only vi
carious, they're ironic. When
was the last time Springsteen
walked down a dark alley or
drove one of those old Chevies?
And has Jackson Browne, for all
his talk of death and apocalypse,
ever graduated from emotional
ninth grade?
So I'm going to leave James
Taylor's record alone. It's not
art — it's not even great pop mu
sic — but, like all the records of
his "dull" period, it's re
markably free of pretension,
and that's not a minor point. Put
it on while you're having dinner
with a friend, and enjoy your
meal. If you want thrills, listen
to Born to Run, or better yet, go
find your own.
As for Sunday afternoon's
concert, Taylor put on a good

performance, under the circum
stances. Noticeably pale, he ad
mitted to having the flu. Not
only that. Saturday night's show
had been cancelled due to bad
weather, so a Sunday night show
was added; thus he played a
complete two and a halt hour
concert knowing full well he'd
have to do the same thing that
evening.
It was the first show of a new
tour, and the band wasn't quite
hot yet. Noted volume
freak/treble head Waddy
Wachtel played way too loud,
and his guitar-stud posturing
made him look ridiculous stand
ing next to Taylor, who has the
same tall, handsome, and only
slightly geekv look that proba
bly made Abe Lincoln president.
Wachtel did give the music
some life, though ("Stand and
Fight" rocked hard), and Billy
Payne (late of Little Feat) is the
best keyboardist Taylor has
ever worked with. Actually, the
whole band reads like a list of
the top session players in L.A.:
Wachtel. Payne, Dan Dugmore
(guitar, banjo, steel), Lee Sklar
(bass) Rick Marotta (drums)
and even producer Peter Asher,
who shook the odd tambourine
and beat the occasional conga.
Playing solo and with various
combinations of the above (plus
two backup singers), Taylor
worked through material that
spanned his ten-album career,
including, besides all his
hits."Something In the Way She
Moves," "Sweet Baby James,"
"Riding On A Railroad," and"I
Will Not Lie for You." There
were also tributes to Woody
Guthrie ("Pretty Boy Floyd")
and Hank Williams ("Hey Good
Lookin"), along with a surprise
appearance by Souther, who
sang with James on "Her Town
Too," and performed his own
"Only Lonely."
It was a good show. Taylor
looked happy, everybody who
wasn't fair-skinned got a tan,
and the traffic moved surpris
ingly quickly back towards the
freeway.
Nothing haunting about that.

was a sell-out. He began making
the kind of pop records critics
call "finely crafted," when they
mean "finely crafted and that's
about it." He also got married,
had a couple kids, and settled
down You could hear him settl
ing down right there on the rec
ords.
Gone was the quiet tragedy of
"Fire and Rain." the wist
fulness of "Riding On A Rail
road." the downright sadness
that made "You Can Close Your
Eyes" so much more than just a
pretty song
These were replaced with
gentle domesticity ("Sarah
Maria"), harmless pop ("Show
er the People," "Your Smiling
Face,") and lots of remakes
("How Sweet It Is," "Handy
Man," "Day Tripper") — in
short, about a decade of pleas
antly dull music.
On record anyway. In con
cert, Taylor has always played

with the kind of bluesy drive
that's missing on his records.
He sings hard, gives his ace
backup players lots of chances
to stretch out. and generally
gives like there's no tomorrow.
His new album. Dad Loves His
Work, and his concert last Sun
day at Berkeley's Greek
Theatre, make the dichotomy
between his recorded and his
live work more apparent than
ever.
I hid Loves His Work might as
well have been pronounced
D O.A. as soon as it got to your
local record store. "Her Town
Too," a duet with John David
Souther, is pretty enough, but
it's just a little too cool. While
Souther has one of the best
voices in the business, he uses it
in that ludicroulsy angst-ridden.
Eagles-like manner that makes
you want to set his hair on fire so
at least he might be awake while
he sings.
"Stand and Fight," a song
that begs to be rocked hard, is
held together by acoustic guitar
and congas — this version would
have been better titled "Sit and
Stare."
But wait a minute. I had all
kinds of cute things to say about
how bad this record is, but why
waste time critiquing a pop
album as it it were the Sistine
Chapel? Why expect tragedy
and pathos? The poor guy
sounds a lot happier than he was
on Street Habx ■James — why
complain that he isn't suffering
enough any more? Why should
he suffer tor me?
Rock fans, and especially
rock critics, are too often
middle class, armchair thrill
seekers who expect their heroes
to fight their spiritual battles
for them. We spend our nights
on the street with Bruce Spring
steen. We love so hard and hurt
so bad right along with Jackson
Browne.
But the thrills are not only vi
carious, they're ironic. When
was the last time Springsteen
walked down a dark alley or
drove one of those old Chevies?
And has Jackson Browne, for all
his talk of death and apocalypse,
ever graduated from emotional
ninth grade?
So I'm going to leave James
Taylor's record alone. It's not
art — it's not even great pop mu
sic — but, like all the records of
his "dull" period, it's re
markably free of pretension,
and that's not a minor point. Put
it on while you're having dinner
with a friend, and enjoy your
meal. If you want thrills, listen
to Born to Run, or better yet, go
find your own.
As for Sunday afternoon's
concert, Taylor put on a good

performance, under the circum
stances. Noticeably pale, he ad
mitted to having the flu. Not
only that. Saturday night's show
had been cancelled due to bad
weather, so a Sunday night show
was added; thus he played a
complete two and a halt hour
concert knowing full well he'd
have to do the same thing that
evening.
It was the first show of a new
tour, and the band wasn't quite
hot yet. Noted volume
freak/treble head Waddy
Wachtel played way too loud,
and his guitar-stud posturing
made him look ridiculous stand
ing next to Taylor, who has the
same tall, handsome, and only
slightly geekv look that proba
bly made Abe Lincoln president.
Wachtel did give the music
some life, though ("Stand and
Fight" rocked hard), and Billy
Payne (late of Little Feat) is the
best keyboardist Taylor has
ever worked with. Actually, the
whole band reads like a list of
the top session players in L.A.:
Wachtel. Payne, Dan Dugmore
(guitar, banjo, steel), Lee Sklar
(bass) Rick Marotta (drums)
and even producer Peter Asher,
who shook the odd tambourine
and beat the occasional conga.
Playing solo and with various
combinations of the above (plus
two backup singers), Taylor
worked through material that
spanned his ten-album career,
including, besides all his
hits."Something In the Way She
Moves," "Sweet Baby James,"
"Riding On A Railroad," and"I
Will Not Lie for You." There
were also tributes to Woody
Guthrie ("Pretty Boy Floyd")
and Hank Williams ("Hey Good
Lookin"), along with a surprise
appearance by Souther, who
sang with James on "Her Town
Too," and performed his own
"Only Lonely."
It was a good show. Taylor
looked happy, everybody who
wasn't fair-skinned got a tan,
and the traffic moved surpris
ingly quickly back towards the
freeway.
Nothing haunting about that.
Nothing wrong, either

I used to love James Taylor
cause he had had a nervous
breakdown, and had been a drug
addict, and he wrote all those
haunting songs. It was fun being
haunted.
Sweet Hab\ Amies and Mud
Slide Slim and the Hlue
Hori;on (1970 and 1971, respec

smart lyrics, sharp, it under

melodies. Pretty arttul. actual

somewhere around (iorilla. He

Sweet It Is," and I thought he
