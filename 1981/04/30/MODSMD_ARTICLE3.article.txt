# House committee threatens a ban on El Salvador an aid
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The House Foreign
Affairs Committee voted yesterday
26-7 to place a ban all U.S. military ad
visors and assistance to El Salvador
unless President Ronald Reagan
certifies that the government there
has met six conditions intended to pre
vent human rights abuses and pro
mote democratic reform.
Although the committee bill is a
long way from law, it was a clear sig
nal that doubts about Reagan's sup
port for the Salvadoran junta still are
very much alive on Capitol Hill.
The amendment to the pending for
eign aid bill Was Supported by ail 18 of
the 21 Democratic members present
and eight of the 15 Republicans, in
cluding the ranking minority member,
Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan.
The amendment was sponsored by
two New York Democrats, Stephen
Solarz and Jonathan Bingham. Solarz,
who predicted that the amendment
will be adopted by the full House, said:
"This vote represents a decisive re
pudiation of the blank-check military
policy of the Reagan administration in
El Salvador and constitutes a signifi
cant victory for those who believe we
should not provide unconditional mili
tary aid to the government of El
Salvador."
To become law, the amendment
must be approved by both the House
and Senate; and its chances of passage
would seem slim in the Republican
controlled Senate. Even there, how
ever, several Republicans have ex
pressed poncern that the dispatch of
American military personnel to train
the Salvadoran forces fighting leftist
guerrillas could lead the United States
into another Vietnam-like situation.
Administration officials, while
saying that they oppose adoption of the
Solarz-Bingham amendment on the
grounds that it could hinder the presi
dent's ability to conduct foreign poli
cy, contended last night that nothing in
the amendment conflicts with the ad
ministration's own goals.
Specifically, the amendment would
require Reagan to certify that the
Salvadoran government is "not en

gaged in a consistent pattern of gross
violations of human rights;" is
achieving "substantial control" over
its own security forces, which have
been charged with widespread torture
and murder, and is committed to con
tinuing economic and social reform
and to holding free elections "at an
early date."
It also requires a presidential
certification that the junta is willing
to negotiate "an equitable political
solution" to the Salvadoran civil war
with opposition factions and is making
"good faith progress" in investigating
the murders of tour American Roman
Catholic women missionaries and two
American advisers on agrarian re
form.
When the administration originally
decided to increase military aid, it
charged that the guerrillas were sup-

plied and controlled by the communist
bloc and said that stopping them was a
test of U.S. willingness to block com
munist-inspired terrorism. More re
cently, as the policy has come under
attack from critics charging the junta
with dictatorial excesses, the admin
istration has put more stress on argu
ing that it-opposes terrorism from the
right as well as the left.
In testimony before a House Ap
propriations subcommittee yester
day, the accusations against the junta
were repeated by several Salvadoran
exiles including a former army of
ficer, Capt. Ricardo Alejandro
Fiallos. He contended that the armed
torces senior command — including
Col. Jaime Abdel Gutierrez, who is the
military power on the junta — had
planned and ordered "political as
sasinations, kidnappings and in
discriminate murders."
