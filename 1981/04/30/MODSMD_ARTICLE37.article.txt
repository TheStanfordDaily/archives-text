Reagan's budget gains more support
Washington — More conservative Democrats swung
into line behind President Ronald Reagan's budget
slashing bill yesterday, despite renewed efforts by Demo
cratic leaders to halt defections and win votes for an alter
native measure providing more funds for social programs
The jockeying for votes came as the House Rules Com
mittee set the stage for the debate, opening today, and a
roll call showdown next week on the rival economic plans
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) who had almost
thrown in the towel on Monday, returned to the attack the
morning after Reagan's dramatic Tuesday night appeal to
Congress to pass his program of unprecedented spending
cuts now.
"I think the performance was great. - ' O'Neill told re
porters. "It was the script I had problems with The script
he read calls for some brutal cuts that are going to hurt
people in ways they don't even know yet It calls for bigger
deficits than the Democratic program, deficits that will
drive up interest rates and recharge inflation."
At the same time, House Democratic Leader Jim
Wright (D-Texas) challenged the president's assertions
that the rival measure approved by the Democratic-con
trolled House Budget Committee would trigger more
spending, raise taxes or cut defense spending Such con
tentions, Wright said, are "thoroughly inaccurate."
In the contest for votes, however, the president's ap
pearance Tuesday night appeared to help his campaign to
win House passage of the $689.2 billion spending plan he
has endorsed.
Envoy cannot stop hunger strike
London — Despite long meetings in the Maze prison near
Belfast, a papal envoy has apparently failed to persuade
Bobby Sands and three other convicted Irish terrorists to
end their hunger strike. The prospect of Sands' death, af
ter 60 days of fasting, has stirred fears of a major upsurge
of sectarian violence in British-ruled Northern Ireland
While not disclosing details of the private meetings that
the Rev. John Magee, an Ulster-born private secretary to
Pope John Paul 11, had with the prisoners Tuesday night
and again yesterday afternoon and evening, British of
ficials said the hunger strike continues.
Sands, 27. a former leader of Provisional Irish Re
publican Army convicts in the Maze who recently was
elected a member of the British Parliament from a pre
dominantly Catholic rural constituency in Northern Ire
land, has refused to eat since March 1. He was reported
yesterday to be very weak and emaciated, though still con
scious. He is attended around the clock by prison doctors,
lies on a special bed and can absorb only bottled spring wa
ter.
After first talking to Sands at the Maze Tuesday night.
Magee met yesterday with Britain's Northern Ireland sec
retary, Humphrey Atkins, who explained the British re
fusal to meet the hunger-strikers' demands for changes in
prison rules that would give them special political-pris
oner status. The papal envoy then returned to the heavily
guarded prison 10 miles south of Belfast to speak to the
four men in separate meetings.
After spending more than tour hours in the prison.
Magee, looking grim, left yesterday night without speak
ing to reporters. It was not known whether he would meet
again with the prisoners or with British officials.

Court upholds landowner voting
Washington — Nearly two decades ago. the Supreme
Court made "one-man. one-vote" its byword, establishing
the principle that each member of a legislature should rep
resent roughly the same number of people.
Yesterday, a changed Supreme Court decided to allow a
sizable exception to this principle. The justices voted 5 to 4
to uphold an election system for a huge Arizona water dis
trict under which balloting is confined to property owners
and each participant gets voting power in proportion to the
amount of land he owns.
The tour dissenting justices bitterly complained that
this amounted to a "one-acre, one-vote" scheme They
said the election system in the water district effectively
stripped thousands of Arizona citizens of a chance to take
part in important public decisions concerning water,
energy and even possible use of nuclear power.
But the majority, in a decision by Justice Potter Stew
art. decided that the large water district had only limited,
specialized government powers. Therefore, the court said,
the "strict demands" of the one-person, one-vote rule
don't apply to the district.
Aid to public schools may drop
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday
sent Congress its proposal for a major shift in national
education policy that would lump together 44 programs
and most likely mean less money for poor students in large
inner-city schools.
The administration bill would reduce federal aid to
education by $1 billion next year. It would continue to
earmark the bulk of federal assistance for poor and handi
capped children, but give states and local school districts
far more spending latitude. It would, for example, do away
with longstanding rules that bar school districts from sub
stituting federal aid tor local spending on these children,
thus freeing up the local tunds.
The bill also would reduce by one-fourth the amount of
federal money currently directed at poor and handicapped
children, and permit states to ignore groups of these chil
dren if they choose.
Speaking on behalf of what he called "a states-rights ad
ministration." Education Secretary Terrel Bell said the
federal school programs have shifted "too much of the
money and the control" of education policy to Washington
during the last 15 years.
' The 50 states must regain control of education and hold
on to it," Bell said. "This is their big chance."
Bell also said a state would be free to reduce the amount
of money it spends on the poor. "They could do it, but they
would have to take the political heat, and I don't think
they'll do it,"he said.
Brady suffers new complication
Washington — White Hoilse press secretary James
Brady has suffered a new complication that could mean
more brain surgery and what one doctor yesterday called
"a long, hard future course. "
Brady's doctors said they are "still optimistic," if also
still guarded, because "most patients in his condition will
recover."
Brady's new problem seems to be a sometimes open,
sometimes shut, air passage from the sinuses or air-filled
cavities in his skull to his brain. This creates a new danger
of harmful air pressure and, worse, infection in his healing

brain cells
He has been restricted tc his bed at George Washington
University Hospital, where his most strenuous activity
since being shot March 30 has been sitting in a chair tor
two hours. His bed will be tilted at a 20-degree angle for i0
days to two weeks to keep his head high and minimize the
