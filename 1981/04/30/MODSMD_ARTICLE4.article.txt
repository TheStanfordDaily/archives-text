# Carson criticizes F.B.I. action
## 
### Louise Solomon 
"Embarrassment is the only real
limit on FBI activity; the only limita
tion on police action is public out
rage," said History Professor Clay
Carson yesterday in Ujaama lounge.
"In the late 1960s and early 1970s no
ohe really gave a damn about
murders, arrests, exiles and other il
legal tactics used against militants."
Carson, wtfio was a civil rights and
anti-war activist in the '60s, said "If
the Democratic leaders who were out
raged about Watergate had been out
raged about what had happened
earlier, Watergate would not have
taken place."
Speaking to a group of twenty stu
dents, Carson addressed the issue of
covert FBI activities "against black
militancy.
"Most of the criticism was directed
narrowly against Watergate, but not
against the basic violations of rights
which existed prior to Watergate. If
you believe in civil rights, use them;
don't be intimidated by government of
else they've won," he said.
Carson said that he tries to avoid

paranoid tendencies. "Right now we
have a little freedom which can be
used to gain more, so don't withdraw.
Either the government has decided to
use better methods, or they have
changed them. Moje likely they just
don't feel as threatened by militant
groups (as they have in the past)." he
added.
Carson warned, however, that Con
gress is in the process of reconsidering
whether or not the CIA and FBI should
be exempt from the Freedom of In
formation Act of 1974.
' 'There may be a return to old meth
ods," he said. "In the fifties it was
'communism,' in the sixties it was
'militancy.' the new buzzword in Con
gress is 'terrorism.' All it takes is one
crazy group or one sophisticated
group of FBI 'terrorists' to make it
happen,"
Although Carson briefly mentioned
several tactics used by the FBI, he
focused primarily on their attempts to
exaggerate the discord within the
black nationalist movement during
the 1960s and early 19705. Quoting ex

amples of letters which were made
public because of the Freedom of In
formation Act, Carson showed how the
FBI had sent letter after letter to sev
eral national groups and prominant
civil rights activists.
Most of the letters he read were
anonymous, but they seemed to be
from a black nationalist group. Most
of them were threatening and full of
innuendo about the possibility of
blackmail and the disclosure of per
sonal information.
For example, in November 1964 the
FBI sent Martin Luther King a letter,
supposedly from a black person, in
which King was called a "fraud and
an "evil, abnormal beast." Carson
said.
"(J. Edgar) Hoover wanted to neu
tralize' King," Carson said. He was
careful to note that although some
groups interpret neutralize as kill, he
sees it as "discredit" or "make less
effective."
"Hoover's vendetta agains King
was due to the fact that King was a
powerful black leader and he didn't
want a powerful black leader." said
Carson.
Carson said that before 1967 the FBI
was only interested in black na
tionalist groups because of their pos
sible infiltration by communists
However, after the burnings of ghet
tos in 1967, the FBI began to feel
threatened by black nationalism,
Carson said. In particular they feared
the rise of a "messiah" figure and the
subsequent unification of the black na
tionalist movement, he added.
Carson also said that the FBI was
aware of the differences within the
movement and did their utmost to cap
italize on them by simultaneously
sending false and menacing letters to
the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee and the Black Panthers.
The distress which the FBl's actions
caused lead to a shut-out between the
Black Panthers and other groups.
Carson said. However, he added that
there was "no way of saying that the
FBI is responsible for the killings, but
they created the climate that made
them possible."
Other techniques which the FBI
used included/ discrediting the black
nationalist movement in the eyes of
the responsible black community, the
responsible white community, and the
liberal white community," Carson
said, quoting Hoover.
"Whatever the FBI does it kind of
makes the situation worse," Carson
said
