# Brown sues to halt drilling
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Los Angeles — Accusing Interior
Secretary James Watt of "un
balanced" and "illegal" actions. Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr. filed suit in federal
district court yesterday to attempt to
block the Reagan administration's
plan to issue offshore oil drilling
leases - off the Northern California
coast.
Browr's 35-page suit alleged among
other things that Watt had illegally ig
nored Brown's recommendations and
that the drilling was a threat to the
southern sea otter and gray whale.
Brown said in the suit, filed on hi?
behalf by Republican Attorney Gener
al George Deukmejian that Watt "has
taken an unbalanced and unsupported
view" of the national interest in re
versing former President Jimmy
Carter's decision to exclude the
Northern California waters from oil
drilling leases.
Furthermore, the suit said. Watt
"violated the Endangered Species Act

by (his) failure to secure adequate
biological opinions.'' which will result
"in an illegal taking under the En
dangered Species Act."
The federal government announced
Monday it will take bids on 515 tracts
of undersea land, covering 600.000
acres about three to 27 miles off the
coast in the Santa Maria Basin, on
May 28 in Anaheim.
Brown had wanted 34 of those
tracts, which are mff San Luis Obispo
and Santa Barbara counties, removed
from the sale because he contends the
risks of damage to the coast and wild
life outweigh the amount of oil that
can be produced.
Watt maintains that "our offshore
oil and gas provide perhaps the best
near-term opportunity to increase our
domestic supply of energy in an en
vironmentally sound manner."
He told a House subcommittee on
Tuesday in Washington that "local
and state concerns do not always re
flect the overriding national need or
perspective."
The suits will also try to head off
any drilling in four Northern Califor
nia basins — Point Arena, Eel, Bodega
Bay and Santa Cruz. These are being
dealt with separately.

The National Resources Defense
Council says the Santa Maria Basin
tracts include breeding^grounds for
the southern sea otter, an endangered
species.
The separate environmentalists'
suit was filed yesterday in U.S. Dis
trict Court in Los Angeles by the Na
tional Resources Defense Council, the
Sierra Club. Friends of the Earth,
Friends of the Sea Otter and the En
vironmental Coalition on Lease Sale
53.
The NRDC lawsuit seeks to halt the
sale of the basin's northern sections on
the grounds that the environmental
impact statement prepared on the
lease sale used outdated and er
roneous evidence in determining the
hazards from oil drilling.
The suit said that current estimates
of the obtainable oil and gas are twice
as high as those used in the impact
statement, but the increased environ
mental risks were not considered.
The NRDC suit also alleges that
Watt illegally refused to defer to
Brown's recommendations that the
northern Santa Maria tracts be de
leted from the sale and that Watt's ac
tions violate federal laws that protect
epdangered species.
