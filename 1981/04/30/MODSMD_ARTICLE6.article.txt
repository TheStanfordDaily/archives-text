# Fighting in Lebanon draws U.S. concern
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Reagan adminis
tration. expressing increased concern
over fighting in Lebanon that has
brought Israel and Syria to the brink of
a major clash, warned Israel yester
day that it has no "green light" from
the United States to "undertake any
military actions in Lebanon. "
Secretary of State Alexander Haig
described the situation as "very wor
risome." He said the United States
has embarked on intense diplomatic
efforts to restore stability in Lebanon,
where Syrian attacks on Christian
militia units in the past month have in
creased the threat of a major Israeli
intervention. The Israelis have sup
ported some of the Christian units in
Lebanon for several years.
A statement issued by Haig's
spokesman, Dean Fischer, called on
"all governments in the world — in
cluding the Soviets — to do their best
to calm the situation."
The statement amounted to the first
public rebuke from the Reagan admin
istration over stepped-up intervention
bv the Israeli air force in the Lebanese
fighting. U.S. concern increased
sharply on Tuesday, when Israelis
flying U.S.-built Fl5 and F-4 fighter
aircraft shot down two Soviet-supplied
Syrian helicopters deep in Lebanese
territory.
Asked during a brief exchange with
reporters why the Soviet Union had
been singled out in the U.S. statement,
Haig explained that "Moscow has spe
cial influence in one of the capitals"
involved in the fighting, namely the
Syrian capital. Damascus
Fischer said that Soviet am
bassador Anatoly Dobrynin was called
to the State Department Monday af
ternoon to confer with Under
secretary of State Walter Stoessel,
and Lebanon was among the subjects
discussed
A report broadcast over the clan
destine Voi(je of Palestine said that
the Soviet ambassador in Beirut,
Alexander Soldatov, had declared that
Lebanon's central Beqaa Valley, the
site of Tuesday's air battle, is part of
Syria's "security zone." Soldatov was
reported to have warned that further

Israeli attacks there would be cause
lor invoking the Syrian-Soviet friend
ship treaty. Officials in Washington
were unable yesterday to verify this
report.
State Department officials were un
der instructions not to discuss whether
the Israeli government of Premier
Menachem Begin had been queried
over the use of U.S. planes to shoot
down Syrian helicopters far inside
Lebanese territory. But it was under
stood such inquiries were being made.
Under U.S. law, Israel and other
purchasers of American military
equipment are permitted to use it only
for self-defense. In the past, the Amer
ican government has overlooked inci
dents in which U.S. equipment was
used by Israeli troops who were in hot
pursuit of guerillas from Lebanon
When the Syrian army in Lebanon
early this month began shelling Chris
tian positions in Beirut and Zahle,
Haig publicly branded the Syrian ac
tions as "brutal." He did so in Jerusa
lem with Begin at his side, and the Is
raelis may have interpreted this as
tacit approval of a stepped-up Israeli
military effort on behalf of the embat
tled Christian forces.
Last Monday, spokesman Fischer
described the seizure by Syrian forces
of strategic points in the Lebanon
mountains as a "major change in the
status quo in Lebanon," and this too
may have encouraged the Israelis to
believe they had U.S. approval to in
tervene.
ambassador Ephraim Evron
conferred at the State Department
Monday on the Lebanon situation. Ac :
cording to Israeli sources. Evron gave
the designated assistant secretary of
State for the Near East. Nicholas
Veliotes, a warning to be conveyed to

ate Syrian air action against the Chris
tians.

yesterday to discuss these exchanges,

States has delivered several stiff dip
lomatic warnings to Syria the
past few weeks

Syrian capital. Damascus
Fischer said that Soviet am
bassador Anatoly Dobrynin was called
to the State Department Monday af
ternoon to confer with Under
secretary of State Walter Stoessel,
and Lebanon was among the subjects
discussed
A report broadcast over the clan
destine Voi(je of Palestine said that
the Soviet ambassador in Beirut,
Alexander Soldatov, had declared that
Lebanon's central Beqaa Valley, the
site of Tuesday's air battle, is part of
Syria's "security zone." Soldatov was
reported to have warned that further

Israeli attacks there would be cause
lor invoking the Syrian-Soviet friend
ship treaty. Officials in Washington
were unable yesterday to verify this
report.
State Department officials were un
der instructions not to discuss whether
the Israeli government of Premier
Menachem Begin had been queried
over the use of U.S. planes to shoot
down Syrian helicopters far inside
Lebanese territory. But it was under
stood such inquiries were being made.
Under U.S. law, Israel and other
purchasers of American military
equipment are permitted to use it only
for self-defense. In the past, the Amer
ican government has overlooked inci
dents in which U.S. equipment was
used by Israeli troops who were in hot
pursuit of guerillas from Lebanon
When the Syrian army in Lebanon
early this month began shelling Chris
tian positions in Beirut and Zahle,
Haig publicly branded the Syrian ac
tions as "brutal." He did so in Jerusa
lem with Begin at his side, and the Is
raelis may have interpreted this as
tacit approval of a stepped-up Israeli
military effort on behalf of the embat
tled Christian forces.
Last Monday, spokesman Fischer
described the seizure by Syrian forces
of strategic points in the Lebanon
mountains as a "major change in the
status quo in Lebanon," and this too
may have encouraged the Israelis to
believe they had U.S. approval to in
tervene.
ambassador Ephraim Evron
conferred at the State Department
Monday on the Lebanon situation. Ac :
cording to Israeli sources. Evron gave
the designated assistant secretary of
State for the Near East. Nicholas
Veliotes, a warning to be conveyed to
Damascus that Israel would not toler
ate Syrian air action against the Chris
tians.
State Department officials refused
yesterday to discuss these exchanges,
'but they confirmed that the United
States has delivered several stiff dip
lomatic warnings to Syria the
past few weeks
