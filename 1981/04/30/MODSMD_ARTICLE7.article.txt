## Schmidt nixes sale 
### Los Angeles Times 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia â€” West
German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, in an apparent at
tempt to avoid triggering a po
litical storm back home, told
Saudi Arabian leaders Tuesday
that his country could not supply
Saudi Arabia with weapons at
this time.
According to government
spokesman Kurt Becker,
Schmidt told the Saudis that
such a sale was not feasible
now, because of opposition in
West Germany. Schmidt said
the forming of a consensus both
io parliament and in his ruling
Social Democratic Party for a
new weapons export policy
might allow arms sales in the
future.
* At present, there is no agree
ment on whether to sell arms,
including an estimated 300
Leopard Roman II battle tanks,
tp Saudi Arabia, which is West
Germany's biggest non-Europe
an trading partner after the
United States. The Saudis sup
ply West Germany with more
than a quarter of its total oil
needs.
Consensus strategy
Schmidt's decision to refuse
weapons sales at this time fits in
with his political strategy of
seeking a broad consensus on
controversial domestic issues.
Schmidt and Saudi officials
discussed the sensitive arms is
sue on the second day of the
chancellor's visit to Saudi Ara
bia. He left yesterday tor Abu
Dhabi, another West German oil
supplier, before heading home
today.
He spoke Tuesday with Crown
Prince Fahid, who is in day-to
day charge of running the gov
ernment under ailing King
Khaled, who is also prime min
ister.
Schmidt, according to spokes
man Becker, emphasized the
"extraordinarily difficult"
problem of supplying weapons
to countries outside the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
because ot domestic concern
about the nation's militarist his
tory. Sales of weapons to ene
mies of Israel are considered es
pecially sensitive.
Adverse domestic reaction
Schmidt noted. Becker said,
that adverse domestic reaction
to the possible weapon sales to
the Saudis, especially by mem
bers of his own political party,
had forced him to withdraw the
question from active considera
tion last December.
The chancellor explained,
however, that a review of the
policy prohibiting sale of weap
ons to nations in areas ot tension
was continuing. Saudi Arabia is
considered to be in such an area.
The federal Security Council,
which includes Schmidt and five
senior ministers, can amend or
abolish the list of such areas or
exempt certain countries trom
restrictions.
