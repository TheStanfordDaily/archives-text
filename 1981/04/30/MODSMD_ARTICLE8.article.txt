# China develops new unification strategy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Having abandoned its old
slogan of "liberating" Taiwan from the Chi
nese Nationalists. Beijing is developing a
new push-pull strategy for the island prov
ince's reunification with mainland China.
The expectation here is that reunification
will become more likely as the current Na
tionalist leaders yield to a younger gener
ation.
A classic carrot-and-stick formula, the
Communists' strategy consists of what of
ficials here believe are three mutually rein
forcing elements:
—An offer to Taiwan's businessmen, who
tend to be apolitical, ot economic coopera
tion that would give the island its greatest
export market and unlimited access to the
mainland's huge resources of raw materials
and low-cost labor.
Straight business
"We are ready to make the offer they
can't refuse," a senior Chinese government
official said. "Suaight business now, leav
ing politics to later."
—An appeal to Chinese patriotism, with
sworn promises that the old hatreds will be
forgotten, that Taiwan upon reunification
can keep its present political, economic and
social system, its current leadership, even
its own army — if it hauls down the Na
tionist flag and acknowledges Peking's sov
ereignty.
—Strong pressure to negotiate as
Taiwan's military strength deteriorates.
China will object firmly to any American
sale of new weapons systems to Taiwan, not
because of its effect on the military balance
between the two but because such a sale
would ease what Beijing sees as mounting

political-psychological pressure on Taiwan
to conclude the best deal it can as its arsenal
grows obsolete and is not replaced.
Economic development
According to a Taiwan-born leader of the
move toward unification, the first step
toward reunification must t.e the main
land's economic development — "how fast
we progress, how well the modernization
program is materialized."
Such development, it is hoped, would al
lay tears among Taiwan's 17 million people
that reunification — a "Communist
takeover" in the view of most on the island
— would mean a lower standard of living.
"We recognize that the relatively poorer
conditions on the mainland cause concern
on Taiwan." a senior government official
here said, "and we believe that the most
convincing answer is to improve our own
Jiving conditions."
Beijing also believes that Taiwan's ex
port-oriented economy can be drawn into
the mainland's modernization effort, start
ing with Fujian province, just 125 miles
across the Taiwan Strait from the island.
Patriotism
The second stage of Taiwan's reunifica
tion. according to unification leaders, would
be "raising the level of patriotism" of
Taiwanese, the majority of the island's pop
ulation, encouraging them to reunite
Taiwan with the mainland rather than
pursue independence.
Although officials will not be pinned down
on timing, their assertion that reunification
must have broad support means that Bei
jing is looking toward the next generation of
leaders on Taiwan to relax the "no, never"
stand that President Chiang Ching-kuo has

taken not just toward reunification but also
toward talks with the Communists.
Beijing is counting on its multiplying con
tacts with former Nationalists in the United
States, Japan and elsewhere plus the
network of family ties that is being slowly
re-established with those on Taiwan to build
up this "patriotism" on which it is counting
so heavily.
Beijing also sees Taiwanese accepting re
unification to solve developing political, ec
onomic and social problems on the island.
Despite Taiwan's prosperity, recent press
reports here .have portrayed the nation as
ridden with corruption, poverty and ex
ploitation.
U.S. nudge
However. Beijing is counting on the Unit
ed States to nudge Taiwan toward reun
ification. "How quickly reunification comes
depends in part on the American govern
ment," said one official. "If the United
States upgrades its relations with Taiwan, if
it continues to sell modern weapons, the
solution to this question will be postponed."
Beijing assumes the Reagan adminis
tration will sell arms to Taiwan, but strong
ly opposes inclusion of new weapons sys
tems such as advanced warplanes, prefer
ring that sales remain limited to spare
parts, ordnance and equipment for present
weapons systems.
Beijing contends that each new weapons
system will have the effect of postponing for
a generation even the possibility of re
unification. The Communists here are coun
ting on the deterioration of Taiwan's mili
tary strength to force it to seek a political
solution to the prolonged conflict.

Beijing — Having abandoned its old
slogan of "liberating" Taiwan from the Chi
nese Nationalists. Beijing is developing a
new push-pull strategy for the island prov
ince's reunification with mainland China.
The expectation here is that reunification
will become more likely as the current Na
tionalist leaders yield to a younger gener
ation.
A classic carrot-and-stick formula, the
Communists' strategy consists of what of
ficials here believe are three mutually rein
forcing elements:
—An offer to Taiwan's businessmen, who
tend to be apolitical, ot economic coopera
tion that would give the island its greatest
export market and unlimited access to the
mainland's huge resources of raw materials
and low-cost labor.
Straight business
"We are ready to make the offer they
can't refuse," a senior Chinese government
official said. "Suaight business now, leav
ing politics to later."
—An appeal to Chinese patriotism, with
sworn promises that the old hatreds will be
forgotten, that Taiwan upon reunification
can keep its present political, economic and
social system, its current leadership, even
its own army — if it hauls down the Na
tionist flag and acknowledges Peking's sov
ereignty.
—Strong pressure to negotiate as
Taiwan's military strength deteriorates.
China will object firmly to any American
sale of new weapons systems to Taiwan, not
because of its effect on the military balance
between the two but because such a sale
would ease what Beijing sees as mounting

political-psychological pressure on Taiwan
to conclude the best deal it can as its arsenal
grows obsolete and is not replaced.
Economic development
According to a Taiwan-born leader of the
move toward unification, the first step
toward reunification must t.e the main
land's economic development — "how fast
we progress, how well the modernization
program is materialized."
Such development, it is hoped, would al
lay tears among Taiwan's 17 million people
that reunification — a "Communist
takeover" in the view of most on the island
— would mean a lower standard of living.
"We recognize that the relatively poorer
conditions on the mainland cause concern
on Taiwan." a senior government official
here said, "and we believe that the most
convincing answer is to improve our own
Jiving conditions."
Beijing also believes that Taiwan's ex
port-oriented economy can be drawn into
the mainland's modernization effort, start
ing with Fujian province, just 125 miles
across the Taiwan Strait from the island.
Patriotism
The second stage of Taiwan's reunifica
tion. according to unification leaders, would
be "raising the level of patriotism" of
Taiwanese, the majority of the island's pop
ulation, encouraging them to reunite
Taiwan with the mainland rather than
pursue independence.
Although officials will not be pinned down
on timing, their assertion that reunification
must have broad support means that Bei
jing is looking toward the next generation of
leaders on Taiwan to relax the "no, never"
stand that President Chiang Ching-kuo has

taken not just toward reunification but also
toward talks with the Communists.
Beijing is counting on its multiplying con
tacts with former Nationalists in the United
States, Japan and elsewhere plus the
network of family ties that is being slowly
re-established with those on Taiwan to build
up this "patriotism" on which it is counting
so heavily.
Beijing also sees Taiwanese accepting re
unification to solve developing political, ec
onomic and social problems on the island.
Despite Taiwan's prosperity, recent press
reports here .have portrayed the nation as
ridden with corruption, poverty and ex
ploitation.
U.S. nudge
However. Beijing is counting on the Unit
ed States to nudge Taiwan toward reun
ification. "How quickly reunification comes
depends in part on the American govern
ment," said one official. "If the United
States upgrades its relations with Taiwan, if
it continues to sell modern weapons, the
solution to this question will be postponed."
Beijing assumes the Reagan adminis
tration will sell arms to Taiwan, but strong
ly opposes inclusion of new weapons sys
tems such as advanced warplanes, prefer
ring that sales remain limited to spare
parts, ordnance and equipment for present
weapons systems.
Beijing contends that each new weapons
system will have the effect of postponing for
a generation even the possibility of re
unification. The Communists here are coun
ting on the deterioration of Taiwan's mili
tary strength to force it to seek a political
solution to the prolonged conflict.
