# IRA terrorist tours U.S. for Bobby Sands support

### Washington Post 
Washington — Charlie
Crumley, 22. describes his life's
work as fighting a " war of liber
ation against the British Army"
in Northern Ireland. It is, he
says, a "people's war."
Its major cost to him so far
has been nearly three years ot
almost-solitary confinement in
a small cell during which he
wore only a blanket or a towel
and refused to use prison toilet
and washing facilities
British authorities, who he
says had arrested him numer
ous times previously, did so
again in December 1976 when he
was charged with membership
ot the Provisional wing of the
Irish Republican Army, a
banned organization that uses
terror tactics to try to torce the
British out ot the province and
reunite it with the predominant
ly Catholic Republic ot Ireland
to the south
Maze prison inmates
He was convicted 11 months
later by a special court set up to
deal with terrorist offenses in
the strife-torn province and, a
day later, joined 100 other "re
publican" inmates at the Maze
prison near Belfast in what has
become known as the "blanket
protest." Another prisoner "on
the blanket" was Bobby Sands,

the 27-year-old IRA "overall
commander," who currently is
reported near death from his es
calated protest, a hunger strike
in its 61st day.
Crumley, released from pris
on last August, is visiting this
country — illegally — in an at
tempt to generate support for
Sands as well as American pres
sure on Britain to concede the
issue. He was escorted to an in
terview Friday by two members
of the Irish Northern Aid Com
mittee, a militant nationalist
group based in New York that
says it collects tunds "for the
dependents of Irish political
prisoners." It is widely reported
to be a conduit of funds to the
IRA.
Clandestine visit
He is one of several former
"blanket men" who had entered
the United States clandestinely
— without a visa, withheld be
cause of their criminal convic
tions or IRA membership.
Their protest is against Brit
ish refusal to grant political sta
tus to republican and "loyalist"
prisoners rather than treat
them as common criminals.
From 1972 to 1976, Britain put
convicted terrorists sentenced
to more than nine months into
special camps as "special-cate
gory" prisoners.
Separate accommodation in
compounds was provided, pris
oners were not required to work
and had extra privileges such as
food parcels and visits.
Sands' life in danger
Their cause has cost Sands
and Crumley dearly and may
yet cost Sands his life.
For both men, for the three
beside Sands on hunger strike,
and tor about 400 others who re
main on the so-called "dirty
protest," the notion of what
they call "criminalization" of
inmates' status is as un
thinkable as it is attractive to
the British authorities who in
troduced it.
At stake is not only an easier
life in prison. More important to
the IRA is its image in the halt
million-strong Catholic com
munity that has been riddled
with sectarian violence, in the
current stage of "the Trou
bles," since 1968. Catholics in
Northern Ireland are outnum
bered 2 to 1 by Protestants.
Catholic discrimination
Catholic grievances over dis
crimination by the Protestant
government in Belfast erupted
in that year and Britain sent
troops in 1969. At the height of
sectarian clashes in 1972, Brit
ain assumed direct rule ot the
province to forestall civil war.
More than 2000 people have died
in the continued violence.
The advantage of political
status is that it confers legit
imacy ; criminal status erases it
and erodes popular backing. "If
(our) war is portrayed as a

criminal war, the IRA as ter
rorists," people "will turn
against" the IRA.
The present Conservative
government in London, follow
ing the policy of the preceding
Labor Party government, in
sists that political status for
those convicted of criminal of
fenses is out of the question.
Human Rights commission
Last summer the European
Commission ot Human Rights,
in a case brought by four in
mates at the Maze prison, found
that they were not entitled to the
status of political prisoners. It
also found that the unhygienic
conditions "are self-imposed by
the applicants as part of their
protest" and that there is noth
ing "inherently degrading or ob
jectionable" about require
ments to wear prison uniform or
to work.
The blanket protest escalated
to the "dirty" level because of
harassment and abuse from
what he described as bigoted
prison warders, who, he noted,
were likely acting on their own
rather than carrying out official
policy. In the cells, which he
said had no toilets, he described
prison aides kicking over
chamber pots they were meant
to empty. Inmates' use ot show
er facilities was timed, he said,
otten resulting in not enough
time to remove soap from their
bodies.
Constant scrutiny
Cyril Gray, information sec
retary at the British Embassy in
Washington, said Saturday that
"all systems are open to cons
tant scrutiny" in British prisons
and that the situation there "has
been several times reviewed."
In those instances where "any
fault or cause tor concern was
established, steps have im
mediately been taken to remedy
the situation."
The inmates, who Crumley
said felt progressively more hu
miliated, felt they had "no al
ternative" but to decline to use
sanitary and washing facilities.
"If you take a decision you
have to stand by your princi
ple," he explained. "Never back
down."
The British, he professes con
fidently, will do so.
Compromise
Last December, a 53-day hun
ger strike by seven jailed ter
rorists ended in a face-saving
compromise.
Subsequently, Crumley said,
Sands came to feel that he had
been "personally deceived"
over the alleged failure to im
plement the settlement and
began the current strike March
1.
Britain's dilemma is that the
same threat of violence, from
Protestant militants, would ap
ply in the event of a softening in
London.
