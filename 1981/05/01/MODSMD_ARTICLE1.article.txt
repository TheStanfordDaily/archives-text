# Fac Senate to probe semester calendar

### Kathy Bodovitz 
The Faculty Senate decided to reex
amine the feasibility of a semester
system at Stanford despite the objec
tions of several engineering pro
fessors.
The Faculty Senate yesterday
adopted English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz's resolution to "establish an
ad hoc committee to study the ques
tion of the length of the terms of aca
demic instruction."
Rebholz, a strong proponent of the
semester system, presented his argu
ment in favor of switching to semes
ters. He proposed a system in which
the first semester would run from just
about Labor Day to just before Christ
mas, and the second 112 rom January to
late May.
This would make a total of 30 weeks
of instruction, the same as now given.
Rebholz said he figures that the aver
age load of three courses per quarter
would be increased to four courses per
semester.
He pointed out that this would mean
a substantial decrease in the number
of courses a student takes in his four
years here. The average now, he said,
is 40 quarter classes in four years. A
semester system would reduce that to
approximately 32 classes in a stu
dent's undergraduate career.
Rebholz further explained that he
believed faculty would not substan
tially increase the amount of material
covered in a course, and courses
would continue to meet the same
number of hours as they do in the quar
ter system.
"This should increase the quality of
study of the same material and make
students better trained in the method
of study," Rebholz said.
The principal advocates of the se
mester system are humanities and so
cial science professors who complain
that the quarter system makes ex
tensive writing and research very dif
ficult.
"Writing in the quarter system is an
educational luxury not to be af
forded." Rebholz said. He said gradu
ate students hate quarters for this rea
son.
Semesters would also make pos
sible a genuine dead week during
which students would have time to re
flect on the entire course. Rebholz
called the present dead week "a
sham."
Rebholz added that reduction of
final exams from three times a vear to

two would allow professors to com
ment more extensively on the exams
because they would not have the time
pressure to turn in grades.
Also, the semester system would re
sult it) fewer incompletes and would
force faculty to rethink their subjects
in order to restructure courses to the
system, Rebholz said.
"Opponents of the semester system
were represented by Associate Dean
of Engineering James Adams. He said
that the School of Engineering favors
quarters for both logistical and educa
tional reasons.
Logistically, a switch to semesters
would require a great effort and a re
orientation of math and physical sci
ence classes, Adams said.
He also explained that in a switch to
semesters, few teaching loads would
come out even. "It would round out to
less teaching by prestigious pro
fessors whom we would want to teach
more. We would end up losing under
graduate teaching," Adams said.
"With semesters," he said, "we
can't fit students as individually as we
can with smaller blocs, and we can't
cover as much as is expected of engi
neering schools. In addition, we can't
serve as many students."
"Without quarters," Adams said,
"the engineering department would
have to go to more internally taught
math and science classes."
Adams said, "It's possible to teach
engineering in the semester system,
but it would force students to spend
more time in engineering, would allow
less flexibility, and would make the
operation more boring."
English Prof. Herbert Linden
berger expressed his support for«se
mesters. "From my experience, ev
erything Ron (Rebholz) says is true
for humanities and related fields. I
had to restructure my courses from
semesters to quarters when I came
here, and it was a loss."
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow
said the difference between the two
systems cannot be all that large be
cause classes are measured in units
corresponding to hours in class. He
said, "We can have big chunks of work
— large unit classes — in either sys
tem. Time elapsed is what seems to
matter."
And Music Prof. Albert Cohen
added, "I'm of the school that says if
it's not badly broken, don't fix it."

mester system are humanities and so
cial science professors who complain
that the quarter system makes ex
tensive writing and research very dif
ficult.
"Writing in the quarter system is an
educational luxury not to be af
forded." Rebholz said. He said gradu
ate students hate quarters for this rea
son.
Semesters would also make pos
sible a genuine dead week during
which students would have time to re
flect on the entire course. Rebholz
called the present dead week "a
sham."
Rebholz added that reduction of
final exams from three times a vear to

two would allow professors to com
ment more extensively on the exams
because they would not have the time
pressure to turn in grades.
Also, the semester system would re
sult it) fewer incompletes and would
force faculty to rethink their subjects
in order to restructure courses to the
system, Rebholz said.
"Opponents of the semester system
were represented by Associate Dean
of Engineering James Adams. He said
that the School of Engineering favors
quarters for both logistical and educa
tional reasons.
Logistically, a switch to semesters
would require a great effort and a re
orientation of math and physical sci
ence classes, Adams said.
He also explained that in a switch to
semesters, few teaching loads would
come out even. "It would round out to
less teaching by prestigious pro
fessors whom we would want to teach
more. We would end up losing under
graduate teaching," Adams said.
"With semesters," he said, "we
can't fit students as individually as we
can with smaller blocs, and we can't
cover as much as is expected of engi
neering schools. In addition, we can't
serve as many students."
"Without quarters," Adams said,
"the engineering department would
have to go to more internally taught
math and science classes."
Adams said, "It's possible to teach
engineering in the semester system,
but it would force students to spend
more time in engineering, would allow
less flexibility, and would make the
operation more boring."
English Prof. Herbert Linden
berger expressed his support for«se
mesters. "From my experience, ev
erything Ron (Rebholz) says is true
for humanities and related fields. I
had to restructure my courses from
semesters to quarters when I came
here, and it was a loss."
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow
said the difference between the two
systems cannot be all that large be
cause classes are measured in units
corresponding to hours in class. He
said, "We can have big chunks of work
— large unit classes — in either sys
tem. Time elapsed is what seems to
matter."
And Music Prof. Albert Cohen
added, "I'm of the school that says if
it's not badly broken, don't fix it."
