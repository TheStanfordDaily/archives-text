When Bella Mody talks,
she minces no words on
where she stands on the issue
of underdevelopment. Pow
erful Western countries, she
claims, seek to acquire de
pendent nations who will pro
vide them with raw materi
als, cheap labor, and a mass
market for the products of
what she refers to as "trans
national" companies.
And when she talks about
the uses of mass media in un
derdeveloped countries, she
is equally firm in her convic
tion that: "Mass media has
been used too often to carry
ads for trans-national com
panies."
Bella Mody is an assistant
professor in the Department
of Communication and the
coordinator of the Master's
program in Applied Com
munications Research. The
program, which has been of
fered for the last seven
years, enables its students to
specialize in communication
and development in Third
World countries.
Mody's interest in the
problem of communication
and development has led her
into such exotic places as
North Yemen, where she
worked on satellite tele
phoning, and Thailand and
Liberia, where she worked to
develop educational radio

stations. Her most recent
project was in Jamaica,
where she served as an ad
viser to the national broad
casting corporation, which is
trying to start a system of
public service education.
In a speech delivered at
the Bechtel I-Center Tues
day. Mody spoke on the top
ic: "When not to use mass
media in Third World coun
tries." Before a lunchtime
audience of about 60 people,
Mody delivered a warning to
those Third World countries
who look to radio and tele
vision as "saviors" in the
struggle to deliver high-qual
ity, low-cost education to re
mote and backward areas.
In the : 9505, a team of re
searchers from the Depart
ment of Political Science at
M.I.T. went to Egypt and
conducted a study on the ef
fects of mass media on the
rural population. The study
showed that once a person
was exposed to mass media,
his thirst tor information
grew ever greater. Mass me
dia was seen as the solution
to reach the rural areas.
But, Mody said, Third
World countries should "be a
little wary" before adopting
these new communications
systems.
In the first place, mass
media hardware — TVs, ra
dios and satellites — has to

be imported from Western
countries, and contains fea
tures which respond to the
needs of affluent Western so
cieties, not underdeveloped
ones. For example, Mody
said that most Third World
countries can do without
privately owned radios, TV
transmission 24 hours a day,
and other features of mass
media which are highly
prized in Western countries
Secondly, systems of own
ership and financing bor
rowed from the West stress a
more commercial aspect of
the communications system,
rather than the locally based,
participatory form of mass
media that Mody envisaged
tor developing countries.
The U.S. model for mass me
dia systems, which has been
copied by countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean,
is based on advertising, and
therefore the goal is tor the
system "to make a profit."
The goal of making a profit
is just one of the values im
ported from the West. There
is another set of imported
values, which Mody called
"production values," that
stress smooth editing and
other aspects of "slick pro
ductions" much more than
the educational values which
are so vital to the people of a
developing country. She
cited the example of her

former colleagues in the In
dian Space Agency, whom
she described as very ideal
istic" in their goal to bring
instructional TV to villages
in India. "Everyone wanted
to be Truffaut or Godard,"
she said. "Teaching grade
school kids was second-rate
work."
She also attacked the wide
spread practice of importing
TV programs from the West.
"When you export programs,
you bring in alien behavior
models," she says. For this
reason, she would much pre
fer to see developing coun
tries put their money into ra
dio. "TV costs five times as
much as radio," she said,
"and you can teach anything
on radio that you can teach
on TV." Mody went on to ex
plain that: "When you buy a
TV, you find that you're also
buying Western production
values "Judged according to
these values, the local pro
ductions simply do not meas
ure up, and the demand tor
imported programs grows.
Mody said that the price tor a
show like I Love Lucy can
start as low as $20 an hour,
but as more people see the
show, the demand for the
show on the local market
grows, and the price tor it
just keeps going higher and
higher. Finally, Mody said,
"you find that the program

has become merely a buffer
between commercials."
What kind of things can
possibly be advertised in a
country where 50 percent of
the population lives below
the poverty line? Mody said
that the products advertised
on TV are luxury items
aimed at the people who own
the TV sets. Thus, TV be
comes an elite, and not a
mass, media.
Mody pointed out the bene
ficial uses ot mass media in

countries like Nicaragua and
Thailand, where radio was
used as an educational tool.
In Nicaragua, a program en
listing the aid of village
teachers was begun to teach
mathematics over the radio.
Unfortunately, the program,
which was funded by U.S.
aid. was discontinued when
foreign advisers were
withdrawn from that coun
try.
Thailand, however, has
just received a World Bank

loan of $34 million which will
enable it to start a network of
nine educational radio sta
tions, she said
In summary. Mody said
that local producers "must
try to make their programs
reflect the national in
terest." She urged a greater
emphasis on public service
education, a wider use ot ra
dio for educational purposes,
and local production rather
than international program
ming.
