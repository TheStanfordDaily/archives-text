# Largest, most powerful of IBM computers installed at SLAC
## 
### Stephan Wassmann 
On March 5, following a 30-
day test period, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) accepted IBM's newest
and most powerful computer,
the IBM 3081. It is the first to be
delivered by IBM to any cus
tomer.
Charles Dickens, the director
of SLAC'S Central Computing
Facility claimed that the 3081
"more than doubles the comput
ing power of SLAC."
The new technological base of
tl\e 3081 consists of 27 sealed,
helium filled, water cooled
Thermal Conduction Modules
(TCMs). Each module is a mul
ti-layered ceramic substrate
packed into a Field Replaceable
Unit only six inches square and
contains on the average 45,000
high performance circuits and
nearly 600 feet of printed circuit
wiring.
These 27 TCMs make up the

processing unit yielding approx
imately two times the comput
ing speed of IBM's previously
largest uniprocessor, the 3033,
located on campus. Each mod
ule contains the computing
power that once filled half the
basement of Encina Hall.
The 308 : is packed in three
large cabinets. It will signifi
cantly reduce the power, space
and cooling requirements, along
with reducing the maintenance
cost of the system. "The 3081 is
roughly tour times as cost-effi
cient as our other computers,"
said Dickens.
Part of the computer's new
basic technology are large-scale
integrated logic circuits. Ac
cording to Joe Wells, the cen
ter's Assistant Director, these
increase the 3081 s reliability
because they "reduce the
amount ot wiring that can break
or turn bad."
Completion, in the spring of

1980, of the Positron Electron
Project (PEP), a large collid
ing beam facility at SLAC, has
necessitated additional comput
ing power, according to Wells.
"By our estimations, to com
pensate for the PEP expansion,
'we had to roughly double our
computing," he said
Wells estimated the cost of
the 3081 to be approximately $4
million. SLAC's other two main
computers, the IBM 370/ : 68s
were purchased in : 973 for
roughly the same price each.
"The capacity of the 308 : , how
ever. is about four times that of
a 370/168." said Wells.
The new computer is the ma
jor processing power with
which SLAC can do its ex
perimenting. "The business
SLAC is in, is creating events
through experiments, putting
those events on tape, bringing
them to the computer center.

to any customer and will more than double the facility's computing
power.

The IBM 3081 IBM's newest and most powerful computer — was
recently accepted by SLAC. It is the first IBM 3081 to be delivered
then analyzing and determining
what the nature of basic matter
is," explained Wells.
Experimental data is col
lected by Vax 11/780 computers
at the experimental apparatus.
This electronic data is recorded
on indicators at various points
by using a magnetic field and
this information is then re
constructed at the central com
puting facility to form a picture
of particle trajectories.
Wells said that once the type
of event has been reconstructed,
a physics analysis will de
termine from the track
curvatures what type and size ot
particles were produced.
"There can be a thousand or a
million of these events," said
Wells. From all these ex
perimental instances a
statistical population study then
has to sort and plot any ir
regular phenomena that seem to
arise from other than sheer ran
dom events and compare them
with the theoretical model.
The computer does occasion
ally run using full capacity. "W.e

are tending to catch up. having
gotten behind some, prior to the
computer's arrival We are run
ning full out and we expect that
the computer in its current size
will meet our computing needs
in about 2 to 2 1 2 years and then
we will need some kind of an up
grade," said Wells.
When asked to comment on
the 3081's performance.
Dickens expressed great satis
faction over recent achieve
ments and said he was very con
fident tor the tuture He said
that within two months the com
puter had become significantly
more reliable than the old sys
tem ot 370 '68s even when ac
counting for the fair number ot
changes that were made on the
system
"Early in the lifetime of a
computer it tends to fail more
often until all the problems are
solved. When a new version of
operating systems comes out it
always has programming er
rors, that is a fact ot the in
dustry," said Dickens
The 3081 has been plugged
into a growing computer

network at SLAC that enables
scientists to use desk-top com
puters or remote terminals
scattered throughout the cen
ter Terminals in research cen
ters all over the world can also
be plugged in.
A scientific advisory board
decides who is entitled to make
experiments and what kinds of
experiments can be run Cur
rently 300 to 400 physicists who
are not on site at SLAC are run
ning and developing experi
ments on the computer Some
are programming from as far
away as Japan and the People's
Republic of China
When the Central Computing
Facility decided to increase its
computing capacity it went on a
competitive procurement to
find the most cost efficient com
puter.
"We are in the process ot
trying to convert people over
from the old system Right now
a lot of people are familiar with
the old one and we don't want to
interrupt their work pattern."
said Dickens.

installation, these should be eliminated with experience, and the
system should eventually fail only once in every six months.
