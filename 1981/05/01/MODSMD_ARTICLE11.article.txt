# Largest, most powerful of IBM computers installed at SLAC
## 
### Stephan Wassmann 
On March 5, following a 30-
day test period, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) accepted IBM's newest
and most powerful computer,
the IBM 3081. It is the first to be
delivered by IBM to any cus
tomer.
Charles Dickens, the director
of SLAC'S Central Computing
Facility claimed that the 3081
"more than doubles the comput
ing power of SLAC."
The new technological base of
tl\e 3081 consists of 27 sealed,
helium filled, water cooled
Thermal Conduction Modules
(TCMs). Each module is a mul
ti-layered ceramic substrate
packed into a Field Replaceable
Unit only six inches square and
contains on the average 45,000
high performance circuits and
nearly 600 feet of printed circuit
wiring.
These 27 TCMs make up the

processing unit yielding approx
imately two times the comput
ing speed of IBM's previously
largest uniprocessor, the 3033,
located on campus. Each mod
ule contains the computing
power that once filled half the
basement of Encina Hall.
The 308 : is packed in three
large cabinets. It will signifi
cantly reduce the power, space
and cooling requirements, along
with reducing the maintenance
cost of the system. "The 3081 is
roughly tour times as cost-effi
cient as our other computers,"
said Dickens.
Part of the computer's new
basic technology are large-scale
integrated logic circuits. Ac
cording to Joe Wells, the cen
ter's Assistant Director, these
increase the 3081 s reliability
because they "reduce the
amount ot wiring that can break
or turn bad."
Completion, in the spring of

1980, of the Positron Electron
Project (PEP), a large collid
ing beam facility at SLAC, has
necessitated additional comput
ing power, according to Wells.
"By our estimations, to com
pensate for the PEP expansion,
'we had to roughly double our
computing," he said
Wells estimated the cost of
the 3081 to be approximately $4
million. SLAC's other two main
computers, the IBM 370/ : 68s
were purchased in : 973 for
roughly the same price each.
"The capacity of the 308 : , how
ever. is about four times that of
a 370/168." said Wells.
The new computer is the ma
jor processing power with
which SLAC can do its ex
perimenting. "The business
SLAC is in, is creating events
through experiments, putting
those events on tape, bringing
them to the computer center.
