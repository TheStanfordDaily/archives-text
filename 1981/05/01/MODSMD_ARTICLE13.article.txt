## Policy as plain as black and white 
### 
To all the members of the
,Grand Assembly, to all the
citizens ot the Kingdom of Uz. I
am proud and filled with joy to
deliver the State of the Kingdom
address to you tonight. Yet I am
also filled with concern, for our
kingdom today faces one of the
most critical periods of its his
tory.
Around the world, the forces
ot good, the forces of white mag
ic. are being threatened by the
forces of evil. Everywhere we
look, peaceful kingdoms, good
kingdoms led by white wizards,
are being threatened by the in
ternational black magic of those
arch-fiends, the Kingdom of.
Uzzr. And I am here to say to
you tonight that now is the time
to stop the black magicians;
now. before it is to late.
There is no part of the world
that is sate from the evil plot of
the Uzzrians.'They are giving
their black magic spells and evil
potions to those who wish to ov
erthrow the just white wizards
who rule them. They are even
training black magicians to go
into these peaceful lands and
cause unrest among the
peasants. And I say to you, this
cannot be!
Right here in this hemi
sphere, practically in our own
back-yard, the Uzzrians are
trying to overthrow the wizards
of the peaceful little kingdom of
Excelsior. Excelsior is a poor
kingdom, and its peasants do
have many complaints. And its
wizards are not lily white. But
rather than work with these

wizards tor peaceful change,
the people ot this country have
been tricked into following a
group of black magicians who
are pawns of the Uzzrians
Now. I say to you. there can
be no peaceful change, until the
last of the black magicians have
been wiped out This means that
we must supply the wizards of
Excelsior with all the spells and
potions they need to be able to
combat the forces of evil that
threaten their kingdom. If the
peasants of Excelsior are too
blind to be able to tell black
from white, we must force them
to be able.
And this is not the only place
in the world where we must con
front the black magic of the Uz
zrians. Half-way around the
world, in a land called the
Eidelmist. the Uzzrians are
again a great danger to us. Be
cause from the land ot the
Eidelmist. we import many ot
the holy fluids that are vital to
our magic spells and potions.
Since we. the forces of white
magic, represent all that is
hateful to the evil Uzzrians. how
can we doubt that they will want
to deprive us of these precious
holy fluids? For this reason, we
must be prepared to defend at
all costs or vital interests in the
Eidelmist. We are organizing
for this purpose a Rapid Magic
Force, or RMF, to enable us to
counter quickly and effectively
any black magic the Uzzrians or
their evil allies perpetrate in
this area.
There are those who say that

this Rapid Magic Force is un
necessary There are those who
say that if it were not for the
magic potion guilds, we could
easily cut down our use of holy
fluids, so that we would no long
er depend on the Eidelmist But
I warn you — do not listen to
these heathens! For they have
come under the spell of the
black magicians
These same heathens would
have us believe that we should
stop trading with the kingdom of
Seth-Raffia. They say that the
wizards of Seth-Raffia have
used their white magic to
enslave many of their own peo
ple. And while there is some
truth to this, there are several
things we must keep in mind.
First, not all people are ready to
be free, and to obey the rules of
white magic. Second, we also
import many of the materials
for our magic spells from Seth-
Raffia, and it the people of the
Seth-Raffia were set free, the
ensuing chaos would endanger
those supplies. But most impor
tant ot all. we must remember
that white magic is white mag
ic. and must everywhere and in
every form be preferred to the
evil black magic of the Uzzrians
and their allies.
I cannot emphasize this last
point too strongly. Do not doubt
for a moment that it is the evil of
the black wizards and their fol
lowers that are the cause of the
problems and injustices ot this
world. Whenever someone
would try to convince you of the
evil of a white wizard, turn your

back on him, for he is himself a
servant of evil.
In conclusion, I ask of you all
that you be willing to sacrifice.
We must all tighten our belts, so
that our magic will once again
be the mightiest in the world.
And we must even be willing to
give up our lives to combat the
evil black magicians. There will
be a long and furious struggle,
but there can only be one out
come — victory for good, vic
tory for white magic, victory for
Uz!
