False resumes
In recent weeks I have been
struck by the disturbing op
portunism of students seeking a
better shot at the future. One be
gins to wonder how many people
are taking credit for jobs poorly
done or not done at all. Is the
next job or political office so im
portant that stretching the truth
beyond recognition is in order?
We've all run into examples
of the false resume syndrome.
There is the case of the beefy re
sume which mistitles jobs and
responsibilities beyond recogni
tion. We've seen the political
person taking excessive credit
for popular projects. And
there's that heart wrenching
case of seeing a fellow worker's
resume which claims wild suc
cess and sole responsibility for
an only marginally successful
project to which the individual
is only a partial contributor.
Of course Stanford and others
pressure us to move successful
ly into the "real world." At
Stanford, building a resume is a
process many of us are con
cerned with. Our advisors stress
creativity and the ability to sell
oneself on that single, magic
piece of paper It is fine to work
hard to embellish a resume and
make accomplishments seem
as important as they really are.
Reworking a resume to stress a
particular career objective is a
tough project worth praise. But
we all know when embellish
ments are on the edge . . .

bordering on unreality. At what
point does one take the fatal
leap into fabrication and mis
representation? At what point
does one take credit for the job
poorly done, mistitle the job. or
excessively misrepresent job
responsibilities 9
Careerism has many of us
hooked in one way or another.
We live in a competitive en
vironment. We camp out at the
CPPC to sign up tor interviews.
And it is extremely difficult tor
an individual to overcome the
collective irrationality of stand
ing on tippy toes to get ahead.
But, standing on tippy toes to
get ahead is both tiring and pre
carious.
Stanford is one of America's
leading academic institutions.
The University was founded on
the principles of open and rigor
ous intellectual inquiry.
Throughout history, univer
sities have maintained high eth
ical standards even during
times of societal upheaval It is
up to us to reassert and reaffirm
this commitment to honesty as
we seek out a profession. Who
was it who said, "A life unex
amined is not worth living'' or
"To thine own self be true?"

As an ill-bred Irish-American
youth who comes from New
York's Lower East Side, I too

musi protest the Ram's Head
production of "West Side
Story." The musical is clearly
making a socio-political
statement against non-Hispanic
youths. The Jets are portrayed
as violent, obsessed with their
own masculinity, and totally
lacking in pride in America — in
short, worse than the Puerto Ri
cans!
"A Boy Like That" is a
blatantly racist song in which a
Puerto Rican character vividly
stereotypes the principal non-
Hispanic male character as
cruel and insane. Meanwhile,
the song "Maria" is a trans
parent attempt to convince the
audience that all Puerto Rican
women are lovely and kind The
message of the production is un
avoidable: Puerto Ricans are
noble and the rest of us are
loathsome
Even though the propagan
dizing nature of the show is in
credibly obvious, and even
though Stanford students are for
the most part intelligent, I do
not think that the play should
have been allowed to continue.
After all, everybody assumes
that a musical is a totally re
alistic representation of life,
and if a single person comes
away from the theater thinking
that Puerto Ricans are far supe
rior to other Americans, the
damage has been done.
Composer Leonard Bernstein
and lyricist Stephen Sondheim
have tried to cover their tracks
by creating subsequent musical

events that do not touch upon the
theme of "West Side Story," but
their obvious Puerto Rican al
legiance has not escaped me (or
the other members of the Non-
Puerto Rican Association of
Stanford). We are also trying to
call the public's attention to the
anti-Midwestern bias of "Okla
homa," the anti-Semitism ot
"Fiddler on the Roof," and the
anti-haircut message of
"Sweeney Todd."
I'd like to thank the Daily for
printing this letter, since it
enables us to fit into the college
mold by making a public gesture
about social reform. It is very
difficult to summon up right
eous anger over something like
a musical play, but it's the only
way my organization could
think of to assert publicly that
we are being discriminated
against and thus appear to be
working towards social change
without ever leaving our dorms.
If the Daily were not to print
this letter, we might actually
have to go out and fight bigotry
where it really does appear in

order to gain the approval of our
peers — so thanks again.

Fake elections
Already enough articles dealt
with the poor voter turnout. But
none describe the real failures
ot the system.
Not one of the fees got 20 per
cent or more of the students to
vote YES. If everybody who
voted NO had not voted on that
tee, no one would have been ap
proved. By voting NO, I, poor in
formed student and so many
others helped approve several
of the fee assessments.
This system cheats the vot
ers. How can one expect that it
will attract people to vote? I
won't do it anymore unless
changes in the regulations make
it worth while. Sorry this sounds
negative. I hope I have some
thing positive to say nexj year.
