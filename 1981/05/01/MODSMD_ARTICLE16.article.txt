## Matthew O'Connor Don't exhaust resources 
### 
Tom Friedberg's column "Applaud Watt's
Domestic Policies" (Daily, Apr. 29), bears testa
ment to the narrow vision and short-sightedness
of James Watt and people like him. Friedberg is
correct in pointing out that the dependence the
United States has on foreign resources is a threat
to peace.
The solution espoused by Friedberg (and the
Reagan administration) is to pursue maximum
development of domestic resources. Meeting
domestic demand through an accelerated rate of
resource extraction. While this would serve to re
duce our dependence on foreign resources (as well
as pumping up the economy), the solution is a
temporary one.
Although significant amounts of fossil fuels and
mineral resources remain is the United States,
the amount is nevertheless finite. To accelerate
•the extraction of them will serve to exhaust them
that much taster. In the coming decades, we will
be faced with the dilemma of resource scarcity.
Perhaps Friedberg believes such a problem does
not lie in the forseeable future. Perhaps if he had
read the Global 2000 Report to the President, he
would understand that resource scarcity is the is
sue of the forseeable future.
It is astounding that Friedberg could argue so
passionately that those who oppose the develop
ment of domestic resources . .are unwilling to
pay the blood tax necessary to defend the liberty
they enjoy and economic benefits which are resul
tant. . when he has failed even to mention con
versation.
Obviously, our dependence on foreign re
sources could be reduced by reducing our con
sumption of resources. In fact, we scarcely need
sacrifice our lifestyle to conserve resources; all
that is required is to curtail waste and increase
the efficiency of our economy. (The per capita
consumption of energy in West Germany is but
one-half that in the United States, yet West Ger
mans are in no way impoverished as a result.)
What rational person would prefer to risk his
life to foreign resources rather than sacrifice one
mile automobile trips or install solar energy tech
nologies in his home? I don't know about you,

Tom, but I'd rather switch than fight. I'd rather
sacrifice some of my consumptive luxuries and
save some unspoiled lands and some of the re
sources they contain for my future and for my
children's futures.
Friedberg claims that Watt's development poli
cies are beneficial to the economies of regions
where resources may be extracted. The people in
these areas . are saddled with burgeoning
welfare roles as they are forced to sustain an un
,stable cyclical tourist economy as their only
means of support." He goes on to cite that the
curtailment of logging by the Department of Agri
culture in Northern California has put loggers out
of work.
Friedberg has the issue reversed. Tourism
forms a much more stable economic base than
logging or mining. Such resource extraction ac
tivities do provide work while the resource lasts
— but what happens when the trees all have been
cut? Forests do regenerate, but in order to main
tain a stable work-force, the trees must be cut at a
rate that matches the rate of regrowth. This has
not been done in the redwood forests of Northern
California. It is the logging companies and the De
partment of Agriculture which failed to adequate
ly restrain them that will (if not now, a few years
hence) put loggers out of work. Extractive eco
nomic activity is much more prone to boom and
bust than tourism or sustained-yield harvesting.
The problem of logging and unemployment in
Northern California is representative of our re
source problems in general; we consume re
sources at rates which far exceed their rate of re
placement. When the resources we have squan
dered dry up, those whose livelihood depend on
their extraction or processing are displaced. This
is the problem we face on a much larger scale.
The productive capacity of the United States is
outstripping its resource base, and the economic
upheaval that this will eventually cause will dis
place our society, not just a few segments of the
work force.
