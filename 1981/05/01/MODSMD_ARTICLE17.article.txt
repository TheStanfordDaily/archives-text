## The 						death of poetry in American writing 
### 
Ah, for a beaker full of the
warm south. The broken wall,
the burning roof and tower. The
maidens taste and stray im
passioned in the littering
le.ai'es.
It can be nice to read poetry
with a friend late at night if the
movies on channel five aren't
any good. But the work of a few
dozen dead geniuses hardly ex
plains or justifies the prolifera
tion of poets in American uni
versities today. Poets are a
source of amusement to the fic
tion writers who meet them at
wine and cheese parties. Amus
ing, because everybody loves a
good story while hardly anybody
except ppets-reads poetry any
more. Amusing, because fiction
writers, by nature, are stylish
and combative, while contem
porary poets are usually
messed-up and marginal.
Amusing, because ma
jority ot younger papts see their
marginality as license to write
gibberish.
It's difficult to establish the
exact causal relation between
the current insignificance of
poets and the meaningless verse
that poets are currently writing.
It's possible, though, to identif*

three socio-historical factors
that have figured in the sorry,
overpopulated state that poetry
is in today.
I. The Cult of the Individual
Great numbers of Americans
aren't so crazy about their rela
tives and prefer, instead, to
have one lover and a few
friends, or else choose to be
"free" (i.e. entirely lonesome,
promiscuous, and unreliable).
Art made by these people tends
to be very self-involved and self
involvement in poetry doesn't
jtfork. The Bell Jar, Sylvia
Plath's novel about committing
suicide, was a best seller but her
book of poems about commit
ting suicide, Aerial, is cherished
only by suicidal poets and a few
morbid academics.
If a fiction writer has talent,
it doesn't matter how lonesome
and loathsome he is. He can
always write books about
himself and lonesome and
loathsome people will buy
them and. be interested in what
happens next while they read.
Very few people, however, no
matter how miserable they are,
want to meditate on poems
about particularly miserable

moments in miserable lives.
People who rationalize their
loneliness, promiscuity and un
dependability by imagining
themselves as unappreciated
gifts to humanity are ev
erywhere persisting in their il
lusions as poets.
11. Stupid Politics
American radicals are
almost all college students, col
lege teachers, or people who
hang around colleges in jobs for
which they are too educated.
Some of them are also poets.
Male Marxists are usually
lost in fantasies of being either
Geronimo or Jesus, ideals they
can't possibly live up to while
bothering other students who
are trying to eat lunch. Their
poetry reflects this same con
tusion between saving mankind
and beirfg a nuisance. Radical
feminists have written dozens of
pointed and provocative novels,
but if you've read one poem
about menstruation you've read
them all.
111. Alchohol and Other Drugs
Many poets, of all stripes,
write poetry because it's fun,
and easy, and compatible with
alcoholism and drug abuse.
Most serious fiction writer
look forward to cocktail hour*
and go on' occasional binges
while between books and lov
ers; but it just isn't possible to

write effective prose, four and
six hours a day, while deeply in
toxicated. On the other hand,
anyone can get smashed and
write thirty incomprehensible
lines about rubbing his face
against a eucalyptus tree, espe
cially if he has tenure.
Because poets are no
expected to make sense, they
can also afford to dabble in hal
lucinogens, a tendency reflect
ed in garbled syntax, absence of
punctuation, and an awestruck
attention to very boring and or
dinary natural phenomena:
moss, skunk cabbage,'stones,
woodchucks, eel grass, beavers,
etc.
Fiction writers, who must
muster all their powers of con
centration in order to bring de
light and instruction to millions,
can't afford drug habits that
make all experience equally in
tense and ineffable. Instead
they must restrict themselves
to mild stimulants and
sedatives. "A little cognac
before bed, perhaps, and what
shall we read tonight? Shelley?
John Donne?"
"Save it for tomorrow.
They're showing Tarzan and
the White Rhinocerous on chan
nel five."

Stexuer fellow in creative writ
ing.)

attention to very boring and or
dinary natural phenomena:
moss, skunk cabbage,'stones,
woodchucks, eel grass, beavers,
etc.
Fiction writers, who must
muster all their powers of con
centration in order to bring de
light and instruction to millions,
can't afford drug habits that
make all experience equally in
tense and ineffable. Instead
they must restrict themselves
to mild stimulants and
sedatives. "A little cognac
before bed, perhaps, and what
shall we read tonight? Shelley?
John Donne?"
"Save it for tomorrow.

Ah, for a beaker full of the
warm south. The broken wall,
the burning roof and tower. The
maidens taste and stray im
passioned in the littering
le.ai'es.
It can be nice to read poetry
with a friend late at night if the
movies on channel five aren't
any good. But the work of a few
dozen dead geniuses hardly ex
plains or justifies the prolifera
tion of poets in American uni
versities today. Poets are a
source of amusement to the fic
tion writers who meet them at
wine and cheese parties. Amus
ing, because everybody loves a
good story while hardly anybody
except ppets-reads poetry any
more. Amusing, because fiction
writers, by nature, are stylish
and combative, while contem
porary poets are usually
messed-up and marginal.
Amusing, because ma
jority ot younger papts see their
marginality as license to write
gibberish.
It's difficult to establish the
exact causal relation between
the current insignificance of
poets and the meaningless verse
that poets are currently writing.
It's possible, though, to identif*

three socio-historical factors
that have figured in the sorry,
overpopulated state that poetry
is in today.
I. The Cult of the Individual
Great numbers of Americans
aren't so crazy about their rela
tives and prefer, instead, to
have one lover and a few
friends, or else choose to be
"free" (i.e. entirely lonesome,
promiscuous, and unreliable).
Art made by these people tends
to be very self-involved and self
involvement in poetry doesn't
jtfork. The Bell Jar, Sylvia
Plath's novel about committing
suicide, was a best seller but her
book of poems about commit
ting suicide, Aerial, is cherished
only by suicidal poets and a few
morbid academics.
If a fiction writer has talent,
it doesn't matter how lonesome
and loathsome he is. He can
always write books about
himself and lonesome and
loathsome people will buy
them and. be interested in what
happens next while they read.
Very few people, however, no
matter how miserable they are,
want to meditate on poems
about particularly miserable

moments in miserable lives.
People who rationalize their
loneliness, promiscuity and un
dependability by imagining
themselves as unappreciated
gifts to humanity are ev
erywhere persisting in their il
lusions as poets.
11. Stupid Politics
American radicals are
almost all college students, col
lege teachers, or people who
hang around colleges in jobs for
which they are too educated.
Some of them are also poets.
Male Marxists are usually
lost in fantasies of being either
Geronimo or Jesus, ideals they
can't possibly live up to while
bothering other students who
are trying to eat lunch. Their
poetry reflects this same con
tusion between saving mankind
and beirfg a nuisance. Radical
feminists have written dozens of
pointed and provocative novels,
but if you've read one poem
about menstruation you've read
them all.
111. Alchohol and Other Drugs
Many poets, of all stripes,
write poetry because it's fun,
and easy, and compatible with
alcoholism and drug abuse.
Most serious fiction writer
look forward to cocktail hour*
and go on' occasional binges
while between books and lov
ers; but it just isn't possible to

write effective prose, four and
six hours a day, while deeply in
toxicated. On the other hand,
anyone can get smashed and
write thirty incomprehensible
lines about rubbing his face
against a eucalyptus tree, espe
cially if he has tenure.
Because poets are no
expected to make sense, they
can also afford to dabble in hal
lucinogens, a tendency reflect
ed in garbled syntax, absence of
punctuation, and an awestruck
attention to very boring and or
dinary natural phenomena:
moss, skunk cabbage,'stones,
woodchucks, eel grass, beavers,
etc.
Fiction writers, who must
muster all their powers of con
centration in order to bring de
light and instruction to millions,
can't afford drug habits that
make all experience equally in
tense and ineffable. Instead
they must restrict themselves
to mild stimulants and
sedatives. "A little cognac
before bed, perhaps, and what
shall we read tonight? Shelley?
John Donne?"
"Save it for tomorrow.

the White Rhinocerous on chan
nel five."
