## Boston in turmoil over cash crisis 
### 
Boston (AP) — As the mayor
warned that financial woes are
changing this city "from
Camelot to Cleveland," the
state Supreme Court was hear
ing arguments today on whether
Boston's penniless school sys
tem would stay open tor the rest
of the academic year.
Meanwhile, citizens angry
over the city's recent layoffs of
police officers and firefighters
blocked some roads into the city
tor the second straight day to

day.
About two dozen people pa
raded in front of the East Boston
entrance to Sumner Tunnel un
der Boston Harbor, one of the
major routes into the city from
the north.
In the suburb of Brookline,
parents and schoolchildren
blocked Route 9 to protest the
layoffs of school crossing
guards.
The schools exhausted their
$210 million budget Tuesday.

The full bench of the Supreme
Court scheduled a hearing today
to decide whether a lower court
acted properly when it ordered
the city to keep the schools open
even though they are broke.
Mayor Kevin White met
Wednesday with two City Coun
cil members to try to break a
deadlock blocking agreement on
a school bailout plan.
He and the full council were to
meet late yesterday in an effort
to conclude a compromise that
would provide money to keep
schools open for the rest of the
year, cover tax abatement
payments the city must make
and reopen some recently
closed police and fire stations.
Unresolved issue
But the issue of rehiring 400
laid-off police officers and fire
fighters still was unresolved.
Council member John Sears,
who was in touch with the nego
tiators, said the group agreed
the city should authorize a $75
million bond issue to pay court

ordered tax refunds to busi
nesses. That would free money
already in the city treasury tor
the schools.
At the heart of the city's prob
lems is Proposition a law
passed by voters last November
that limits the amount of money
communities can collect
through property taxes.
Because this means a drop in
tax income, White had refused
to let the school system over
spend its budget, as it has rou
tinely done.
Warns of bankruptcy
White warns that Boston may
go bankrupt by July 1.
On Wednesday, hundreds of
sign-carrying demonstrators —
including off-duty and laid-off
firefighters — blocked major
highways, bridges and tunnels
into the city for about 90
minutes during morning rush
hour to protest the layoffs.
No arrests were made, police
said.
