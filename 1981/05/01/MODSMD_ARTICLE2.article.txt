# Reagan toughens on human rights
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan said yesterday the United
States should not negotiate with any
nation persecuting its people for
"whatever reason" if the country re
fuses to make such human rights vio
lation a topic of the talks.
The president placed a new em
phasis on human rights as he partici
pated in a ceremony commemorating
the Holocaust — the death of 6 million
Jews under Nazi oppression.
Reagan's words seemed to go
further than any of his earlier
statements that any U.S.-Soviet arms
negotiations must take into considera
tion all Soviet activity rather than con
centrate on arms control alone, but
the president and senior White House
officials moved quickly to counter
that impression
The regular daily White House
press briefing was delayed 30 minutes
as officials considered how to present
their case that Reagan had not broken
new ground.
Deputy press secretary Larry
Speakes then told reporters, "I would
not read this as a new policy, but as a
reiteration of policy." He emphasized

that he was speaking for the president.
Speakes said Reagan did not intend
to say an agreement to discuss re
ligious.or other persecution must be a
precondition tor any negotiations and
added the president's words did not
apply to any particular talks coming
up.
"Finger of shame'
Reagan concluded his eight-minute
talk to an East Room audience that in
cluded seven survivors of the Holo
caust, which took 6 million Jewish
lives in Nazi-controlled Europe, by
saying he intends to use the bully
pulpit of the presidency "to point a fin
ger of shame" at persecution wher
ever it takes place.
"Even at the negotiating table, nev
er shall it be forgotten for a moment
that wherever it is taking place in the
world, the persecution of people, for
whatever reason — persecution of
people for their religious belief — that
is a matter to be on that negotiating
table or the United States does not
belong at that table," he said.
White House officials said the presi
dent had been emotionally wound up
by the Holocaust ceremony and had
meant only to reiterate that he be

lieves in linkage.
"I happen to believe also that you
can't sit down at a table and just nego
tiate (arms limitations) unless you
take into account and consideration at
that table all the other things that are
going on. In other words, I believe in
linkage," Reagan told his first presi
dential press conference since Jan. 29.
The president, still convalescing
from a, bullet wound in the chest, ap
peared in good health as he walked
briskly into the room and mounted the
podium, smiling and shaking hands
with other speakers.
The ceremony marked the first an
nual Day of Remembrance sponsored
by the United States Holocaust Memo
rial Council, which was established by
Congress in 1980. "The hope of a cere
mony such as this is that even a tor
tured past holds promise if we learn
its lessons," Reagan said.
Elie Wiesel, council chairman, de
livered an emotional appeal for people
to remember the Holocaust and learn
from it.
"For the first time in history, being
became a crime," Wiesel said ol the
campaign against Jews. "We must
tell the tale. We must bear witness."
