# Democratic House is budget hurdle
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Rea
gan administration's economic
program is heading for its first
showdown in the full House with
outnumbered Republicans op
timistic they can deliver a
crucial victory for the presi
dent. The Democrats' top vote
counter figures they could
either win by six or lose by 60.
Less than 40 hours after Pres
ident Ronald Reagan personally
appealed to a joint session of
Congress to act quickly on his
package of spending and tax
cuts, the House was beginning
debate yesterday on whether to
endorse a budget resolution
backed by the president or a
still-developing alternate plan
being pushed by the Democratic
leadership.
The House is the big hurdle
for Reagan. His program is vir
tually assured of passing the
Senate, where Republicans hold
a majority.
Rep. Delbert Latta of Ohio,
the ranking Republican on the
House Budget Committee, said
Reagan will "absolutely" pre
vail when the votes are counted
in the House.
House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill (D-Mass.) predicted
Wednesday: "We'll either win
this thing by five or six votes or
lose it by 60, because if you start
to lose it, the swing will come."
Meanwhile, one congressman
said as many as 35 of a group of
47 conservative Democrats
probably will support the presi
dent's proposal over an alter

native budget plan still being
pieced together by the Demo
cratic leadership.
Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-
Texas) predicted that six to 10
Democrats who are not mem
bers of the Conservative Demo
cratic Forum also will go along
with Reagan.
If those shifts occur and Re
publicans sustain only two or
three defections, as GOP lead
ers claim, it would assure Rea
gan of victory whpn a final vote
in the House occurs next week,,
probably Tuesday. Democrats
hold a 52-vote majority in the
House and a net switch of 27
Democrats would enable the
president to prevail if all the Re
publicans vote together.
However, Republican Whip
Trent Lott of Mississippi re
mained cautious, saying,
"We've still got a few days to
go."
O'Neill on Wednesday dis
counted the impact of Reagan's
speech, saying it had not gener
ated additional support for the
president, as Republicans had
predicted. He also assailed the
administration's plans for
"brutal (spending) cuts that are
going to hurt people in ways
they don't even know yet,"
large budget deficits and "big
tax cuts for the rich."
Referring to Democrats who
plan to support the president's
recommendations, O'Neill said,
"We have members trying to
reason with them."
