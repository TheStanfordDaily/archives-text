# Atlanta police crack down on street crime
## 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — Authorities were
cracking down on prostitutes and petty
criminals in an effort to extract informa
tion about the slayings of 26 young Atlan
ta blacks, officials said.
During police sweeps last weekend, 74
people were arrested on charges ranging
from sodomy to the possession of drugs
and firearms, officials said Wednesday.
The people rounded up in the sweeps
were then questioned about the rash of
slayings since July 1979, officials said.
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson told
reporters police "have sent the word
through the criminal element" to till in
police on any information in "the under
world grapevine" about the slayings.
Although the criminals "don't like the
heat we're giving them," Jackson said,
so tar informants have not given any use
ful information to the special police task
force.
Atlanta Public Safety Commissioner
Lee Brown said police officers were told

bet ore the raids to "never overlook what
our No. 1 priority is. And the priority at
this time is to bring closure to the un
solved cases of our children and our
young adults."
Meanwhile, missing persons in
vestigators canceled a search for a 13-
year-old black youth reported missing
late Wednesday afternoon after the
youth was found asleep in the basement
of his home.
Sean Collier, 13, last was seen about
4:30 p.m. in southwest Atlanta where he
lived, but police spokesman Bill Todd
said Collier was found asleep and un
harmed early today. t
Collier had been "reported missing by a
friend of the family, who told police that
Collier's mother was too upset to call.
Todd said the alert was canceled about
2:50 a.m. EDT.
The task force generally has not taken
over investigations of missing youths un
til 72 hours after disappearance is re

ported.
Meanwhile, fear and a strict curfew
are keeping lone children off the streets
ot this city where 26 young blacks have
been slain. And that may be why four of
the most recent victims have been
adults, Brown said Wednesday.
"We find there are indeed less chil
dren on our streets by virtue of the
curfew and by virtue of the educational
process," he said at a news conference.
"We also see the police officers who
are patrolling the streets 24 hours a day.
They're saying children are walking in
groups, not in ones as often was the case
before," Brown said.
City Councilwoman Carolyn Banks,
who proposed the dusk-to-dawn curfew
for children 14 and younger, said, "I
think that because of the non-availability
of children on the streets, the killer or
killers are moving on to child-like adults.
I would hope they take heed at the way

the trend is turning and would be extra
caretul."
Brown said adult victims posed an ad
ditional headache for investigators be
cause it was more difficult to verify if
they had been abducted.
Brown said investigators are checking
reports that some of the tour adult vic
tims knew some of the younger victims,
but so far police have not verified those
reports.
The most recent victim, Jimmy Hay
Payne, 21. his body clad only in under
shorts. was pulled from the Chat
tahoochee River on Monday. Medical ex
aminers ruled Tuesday that he probably
died of asphyxiation, the same cause of
death as 14 other victims.
Besides the tour adults, all of them
small in stature, 22 black children have
been slain in the past 21 months and one
child, 10-year-old Darron Glass, remains
missing.
