# Gould gets 250th career win against Sparts
## Cardinals plunge through Waves 
### Ivan Maisel 
Pepperdine was playing like they had a
plane to catch, which they did Stanford de
cided to lend the Waves a helping hand,
which they did — sort of
The Cards expedited their guests' de
parture by beating Pepperdine 6-3 in men's
tennis yesterday. Coupled with a 9-0
whitewash of San Jose State Wednesday,
Stanford is now 15-0 going into today 's show
down against Cal (1:30 p.m., Tennis Stadi
um).
The Waves (now 16-3) are en route to the
West Coast Athletic Conference tour
nament which begins tomorrow in Portland.
Thus the starting time was moved up to
noon. As far as Pepperdine was concerned,
however, maybe it never should have been
set at all.
"They played the heck out of the game.
What can I say?" Pepperdine coach Allen
Fox said. "We were beaten by a damn good
team. I hope we meet again at the nationals
— fn the finals." .
Stanford to6k five of six singles matches,
clinching the match in about two hours.
Only one of those wins needed three sets,
and that was the clincher, Tim Mayotte's
6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over Glenn Michibata.

Mayotte won on both ends of the service
game. His serves were blistering, and his
service returns were sharp and accurate
The junior acknowledged he is progressing
exactly as he wishes in his attempt to peak
at the NCAA tournament.
'' My first good match was against Gordon
(Arizona's Andy, who Mayotte beat 6-2, 6-L
April 18). I got my rhythm, shots started
falling and 1 was serving better," Mayotte
said. "I played well at Ojai < winning the Pa
cific-iO Conference singles title). That gave
me a lot of confidence."
But he's not there yet. "I feel like I can
get in better shape. I can polish things more.
What do we have, 10 days until we leave for
Athens (Georgia, the site of the nationals)?
I'm happy with the way things are going.
The whole team is going well."
Stanford coach Dick Gould agreed with
Mayotte — but not before praising him.
"The last three weeks Tim has played just
superb tennis, and he'll get better," Gould
said. "Everybody has been coming on
strong in the last three weeks. The big thing
now is to stay healthy."
The only Cardinal currently ailing is Scott
Bondurant, out with a sore neck. His de
parture precipitated the entrance of John

Corse in the lineup. The junior from Atlanta
responded with two easy wins in two days,
losing.a total of seven games in four s' s.
It's been somewhat ot a redemption tor
Corse, who came into Stanford witji much
ballyhoo after an amazing career in junior
tennis. Gould — who gives out scholarships
like David Stockman gives out government
grants — thought so highly of Corse that he
gave him a full free ride.
Yet the amazing tennis stopped when he
got here. It was this year before Corse got
the chance to show what he could do. An 8-i.
record has.proven he can do it well.
"I played at No. 7 when I was a freshman.
I was playing pretty good when I came in,
but Jim Hodges and I were about the same
and he was a junior. That year I didn't really
play much," Corse said. "Last year I was
just out of it most of the year.
But Siegler stopped out to play the pro
circuit — and Cprse was at No 7, the first
line of defense against injuries. "All of a
sudden I had a great chance. Things have
been going pretty good."
NOTES — Stanford went through San
Jose State without losing a set, a nice touch
on a win that was Gould's 250 th as the Stan
ford coach.
