## No. 1 ASU invades Farm 
### Ralph Walker 
There has been little, if anything, that has been
able to stop thfe Arizona State baseball team this
year. Judging from the Sun Devils' 44-9 record
(23:1 in the SixPac), it appears that maybe the
only thing that could stop them from adding Stan
ford to their hit list this weekend at Sunken
Diamond would be for the Oakland A s to suddenly
enroll en masse at the Farm.
The Sun Devils are synonomous with power.
Not the ordinary kind of power, but the kind that
can break open games and overcome large defi
cits in late innings. ASU averages 10.5 runs per
game.
ASU coach Jim Brock also has a tew hurlers
who combine to boast the lowest ERA in the
league, 4.36. Of the starting three, only Randy
Neumon (7-2, 3.46) is dependable. But the Rolaids
duoot Kendall Carter (14-1,2.18) and Kevin Dukes
(4-2, 4.50) have spelled nothing but relief for
Brock this year.
And trouble for Stanford. This weekend is
crucial tor the Cards (32-19, 11-13) because they
are struggling for a playoff berth in the Western
Regionals and will have to win two or three games
to keep their hopes alive.
A pipe dream? Perhaps â€” ASU has lost only one

conference game all year, but Stanford coach
Mark Marquess remains objective. "I'm not
going to worry myself on how they play," said
Marquess. "If we pitch well and play good de
fense. we'll beat them."
On the brighter side, the Cards are continuing to
pummel the ball, and are second to only ASU with
a .330 team batting average and 70 home runs.
(The Devils are hitting .364 coming into the series
and have blasted 87 balls out of the park.)
But the series will still come down to pitching.
Stanford will be relying heavily on reliever Mike
Sullivan (4-1, 7.52), who has been the most consis
tent hurler in recent weeks.
Why has ASU been able to win 23 out of 24 games
in unquestionably the strongest conference in the
nation? "They've always been a good hitting
team," said Marquess. "The difference this year
is in their pitching and defense."
Brock was more specific. "There is something
about this team that makes it different from any
other team I've coached. When it's almost ex
cusable to play with little or no intensity, these
guys keep coming at you. They just flat out don't
like to lose."
Stanford, of course, will be hoping for a change
of heart this weekend.
