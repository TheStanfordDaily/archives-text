## Pro sports turn in rough draft 
### Sally Jenkins Steve Odell 
The pro draft, that wonderful institution through which a
fairly talented and street-smart young man can completely
avoid an education, has come and gone once again amidst
cheers and tickertape.
Listen. You can hear the cattle groaning and snorting as
they are herded through the airways of America.
You can hear NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle whistling
and singing softly to the doggies as he guides them to their
new homes.
You can also hear the snickers of coaches as they pore over
their lists of newly aquired, perfectly marbled, prime-cut
American youth.
Freedom of choice is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Fact: there will be no tickertape for all the poor young
souls who have to play football in Green Bay, Wisconsin next
fall. They can choose not to play there of course. They have
the alternative of playing in lovely downtown Ottawa, Cana
da. Then there's always Montreal, but it's probably just as
cold.
This is just personal opinion you understand, but frankly, I
would not say that a choice between Ottawa and Green Bay is
in keeping with the spirit of the Declaration of Independence.
You know, that part about "the pursuit of happiness." Happi
ness is not Ottawa.
It an athlete has a choice of what college he wants to be ex
ploited by, why can't he choose what professional team owner
he wants to make a lot of money for? At least that way he can
choose what town he would like to live and work in.
It should be up to the team management to develop a
pleasant working atmosphere. Without the draft players
would simply have to apply for a job with the team they favor,
just as a prospective student applies to a school.
Or Rozelle could move all the teams to places like Hawaii
and Florida.

Call it slavery. Call it exploitation. Call it whatever adverse word
you can think of, but one thing holds true The present draft system
is the only way that makes sense to incorporate collegiate athletes
into professional sport.
The draft has met its predetermined purpose — it has maintained
order and established parity. The balance in our professional sports
owes itself to the beauty of the natural evolution that allows a team
like Tampa Bay to make it to the NFC championship game two
years after going 0-14.
The draft makes for a system where intelligence is involved, in
stead of just money. George Steinbrenner is a prime example here.
He won two World Series with mega of the latter, but few, if any of
the first.
If a player is disgruntled with where he is dratted, then he always
has the option to sit out tor awhil£ and gain tree agent status.
A point to be made here, though, is that players usually will not
choose this option, because, again, money is the prime force in their
decision, and to sit out would be to jeopardize their bank account.
Dave Winfield had a choice. He played out his option to gain free
agent status so he could play somewhere whece he could be active in
pharities — well, Dave, I guess you made the right choice if, as the
saying goes, charity starts at home. Pretty nice home, too, for 24
million, I bet.
It is very likely if we were to abandon our draft, there would be a
few teams of superstars making billions. Sounds great? Try to re
member the last exciting Pro Bowl you saw. Besides that, this
wouldn't be All-Stars against All-Stars — this would be George
Brett against Johnny LeMaster. Earl Campbell against Boobie
Clark. Kareem Jabbar against Clifford Ray. Every night. Urp.
There would probably be three or four of these super teams, lo
cated in the metropolises that could afford to roll out Fort Knox tor
their players.
No wait, ya know, maybe I am wrong. Maybe it would be exciting
to have all of the pennant races over with by June. Right, Clyde.
