### 
Louisville, Ky. (AP) — An undersized colt
named Proud Appeal has emerged as the
lukewarm favorite for Saturday's 107 th Kentucky
Derby, which shapes up as a cavalry charge in
volving 20 three-year-olds.
"I'm sure nobody can steal this race," Stanley
Hough, trainer of the Blue Grass and Gotham
stakes winner, said Wednesday in the barn area at
Churchill Downs. "It will be either the horse with
a lot of speed or no speed, but the horse with
middle speed would seem to be in a lot of trouble
because of the large field."
By speed horses, he means front-runners and by
no speed he means stretch runners. They've come
from coast to coast with varied running styles and
pedigrees for this iV4-mile first leg of thor
oughbred racing's Triple Crown.
Among other leading contenders are Wood Me
morial winner Pleasant Colony; Bold Ego, the Ar
kansas Derby winner; Santa Anita Derby victor
Splendid Spruce; Flamingo winner Tap Shoes;
Gotham runner-up Cure The Blues, and Flamingo
runner-up Well Decorated.
Other probables expected to be entered today
are Classic Go Go, Habano, Top Avenger, Pass

the Tab, Double Sonic, Hoedown's Day, Wood
chopper, Noble Nashua, Partez, Television Stu
dio. Beau Rit, Golden Derby and Flying Nashua
Law Me and Mythical Ruler also want to go. but
Churchill Down probably will be forced to invoke
the 20-horse limit — based on earnings — for the
tirst time. The rule went into effect after the '974
Derby, which drew a field of 23.
Proud Appeal has won eight of nine career
starts, including all five starts this year, and is re
garded as the horse to beat.
Some critics were not impressed by Proud Ap
peal's three-length victory in the slop at
Keeneland April 23 and, since Hough has not done
much with the colt here, there were rumors he
wasn't in top shape.
The colt galloped IVa miles Wednesday.
Proud Appeal is a Florida-bred horse owned by
Hough, Malcolm Wintield, John Gaines and Rob
ert Entenann. Hough and Winfield purchased him
for $37,000 in an auction for unraced two-year-olds
at Hialeah The son of Valid Appeal-Proud n' Hap
py was sidelined for about six months after injur
ing his shins in the running of the Tyro at Mon
mouth Park in July. He finished fourth for his only
loss.
