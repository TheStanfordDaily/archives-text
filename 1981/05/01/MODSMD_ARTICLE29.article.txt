# A's get ready for Yankees
## 
### 
Oakland (AP) â€” If the Oak
land A's were playing today,
they'd have the opportunity to
establish a major league record
for April victories.
But they'll have to settle for
an 18-3 month and a share of the
record. They have the day off,
and Manager Billy Martin
couldn't be happier.
"We need the break. It's
perfect timing, coming after a
big win and with the Yankees
coming in next," Martin said as
he iced down a sore foot, bruised
in the brawling which took place
during and after Wednesday's
6-4 victory over the California
Angels.
The New York Yankees
aren't getting the day oft, noted
Martin, their former manager.
"I understand they're work
ing out here in the morning, un
der orders from (team owner)
George Steinbrenner," he said.
Sellout crowds are expected
for the three-day, four-game
series which opens tonight be
tween the A's and Yankees, cur
rent division leaders.
Right-hander Mike Norris,

whose 5-0 record is best in the
American League, tossed a five
hitter against' the s Angels
Wednesday and his hitting sup
port included homers by Tony
Armas and Tim Hosley as the
A's broke a two-game losing
streak.
"We had to end that streak,
and it was my job to be the
stopper," said Norris, who got
his second decision ol the season
over the Angels and Geolf Zahn,
3-2.
Two of the Angels' hits were
homers, by John Harris in the
second and by Dan Ford in the
eighth. As Ford crossed the
plate, he grabbed his bat away
from A's catcher Mike Heath,
who had asked home plate um
pire John Shulock to inspect it
for a possible cork insert.
"The bat isn't corked, and
Heath had no right to pick it
up," said Ford.
"He grabbed me, and nobody
likes to be grabbed. I had to
react," said Heath, whose con
frontation with Ford was the
start of a major on-field brawl.
The hard feelings lingered,
obviously, because players,
coaches and managers tangled

immediately alter the game.
"I got stepped on and have
three holes in my shoe, and I
didn't even get to throw a
punch," added Martin.
He said he was ready to punch
Angels pitching coach Tom
Morgan before California Man
ager Jim Fregosi pulled him
away in the post-game fight
near the entrances to the team
locker rooms.
