# Victims from earthquake drill fall ill
## 
### Sally Newman 
Volunteers in last Tuesday's mock
earthquake have had the unique if un
enviable opportunity to be "victims"
twice over — once the hapless suf
ferers "injured" during the quake,
and again the following day, as vic
tims of a painfully real "aftershock "
A 'flu bug presumably carried by
one or more infected and contagious
volunteers was transmitted through
out the group, according to Director of
the Row Diana Conklin, who coordi
nated the day's activities.
An estimated 15 to 40 or more of the
drill's 120 volunteers were affected,
reporting similar symptoms: nausea,
loss of appetite, vomiting and low
grade temperatures. "When all six of
the Twain volunteers got sick," re
called Twain R A. Kirk Luetkehans,
"we started trying to piece together
what happened "
While some victims feared their ill
ness might have been caused by food

poisoning, this is a doubtful possi
bility. Sack lunches made by the
Dietetics department of the Stanford
University Hospital contained turkey
and roast beef sandwiches prepared
with mayonnaise — which could con
ceivably have spoiled if left un
refrigerated too long — but hospital
officials called the idea highly im
probable.
"I don't have either the authority or
ability to rule it out entirely," said
Stanford Hospital infection control
nurse Carle Oakes, but "it is very un
likely that the students got sick from
food ingested at the drill." She ex
plained that "food-borne illnesses"'
are usually caused by staph organisms
which normally take only two to six
hours to strike. That does not tally
with the victims' symptoms: though a
few were ill by dinner on Tuesday,
most victims were not affected until
30 to 36 hours after eating the lunches
The chances of food poisoning were

further reduced by the tact that lef
tover sandwiches were consumed both
in the hospital's employee cafeteria
and by Row Office staffers — none of
whom subsequently became ill Also,
at least one victim became ill without
even eating a sandwich.
Whether or not an incontestable
reason is ever found, so many volun
teers met the same fate that the mat
ter could not be dismissed as purely
coincidental. Cowell records did show
a "heavy clustering"' of cases on
Wednesday night, according to Con
klin. Nearly a dozen reported their
symptoms there in the space of a few
hours. At least one student, senior
Robin Daus, spent the night there be
cause of illness probably contracted at
the drill, according to Groswald.
Though the illnesses were of very
short duration, according to Larkin
resident Jim de la Hunt, those af
flicted, not unexpectedly, experienced
