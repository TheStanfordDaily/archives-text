founders, Olympic swimmers

served up along with the vol
leyballs Sunday afternoon, so
come up to the lovely shores of
Lake Lagunita and enjoy a re
laxing time. The men's crew
team battled USC and UCLA

ond place in the frosh-8, nov
ice-4, junior varsity-8 and varsi
ty-8 events.
UCLA dominated the waters,
while USC played the polite
host, coming in last in all races.
