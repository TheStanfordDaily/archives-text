### Andy Nuss 
If Stanford pitcher Doug Gwaltney could have taken back just one
pitch that he threw at St. Mary's on Tuesday, he and the Cards prob
ably would have come home with a win under their respective belts.
As it was. with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning and the
Cards ahead by a score of 2-0, Gwaltney served one up that was
promptly ripped tor a double by the St. Mary's designated cleanup
hitter to drive in the Gaels' only runs of the afternoon, giving them
the victory over Stanford, 3-2.
A close call by the home plate umpire and the bat of Bill Worden
helped avert another late inning misfortune tor Stanford when they
triumphed over Santa Clara, 10-9, at Sunken Diamond on Wednes
day afternoon.
With one out and the sacks full. Stanford coach Mark Marquess
decided to try to torce the issue with a little "Billy Ball'' of his own,
calling lor a squeeze play. With Toothman breaking for home on the
pitch. Bob Hausladen laid down a bunt to the mound. Santa Clara's
losing pitcher, Pat Larkin. fielded the bunt and whipped it back to
home plate, but Toothman was called safe to give Stanford the win.
