# Economist warns of crisis in U.S. capitalism

"We're in a crisis, or very
close to one," said Marxist
economist Paul Sweezy during a
speech last Wednesday in
Meyer Forum Room Speaking
on "The Contemporary Crisis of
U.S. Capitalism," Sweezy
claimed that this crisis faces
the entire world and threatens
to cause grave damage to all
economies — from the strong in
dustrialized countries, to the de
veloping Third World, to the so
cialist countries. He said danger
points occur in the U.S. econo
my approximately every 10
years in a cyclical fashion which
is characterized by an upswing,
a peak, a crisis, a downswing,
and a gradual recovery leading
full circle to another upswing.
The U.S. economy has ex
hibited a long, gradual upswing
since the bottom point ot the
early 1970s recession. As this
country wavers atop its present
plateau, one can only wonder
which way the economy will go.
According to Sweezy, Washing
ton claims the revitalization ot
the industrial sector will send
the economy back on the upsw
ing. This is,"irrelevant," and
entirely the wrong focus for the
government effort since the
problems do not center in the in
dustrial sector, he said.
Despite the existence ot an in
dustrial base, Sweezy pointed
out that the U.S. economy has
transformed into a "service and
retail" economy.
In fact, added Sweezy, the
biggest area of growth in the
last decade has occurred in the
proliferation of drinking and
eating establishments. "And,"
said Sweezy, "it Mr. Reagan
wants to industrialize America,
and create jobs that way, then
he's barking up the wrong tree."
One of the main danger areas
in the U.S. economy doesn't,

however, lie in this growth of
the service and retail sector, but
in the rapidly swelling debt. In
the last six years, the seri
ousness ot the debt has reached
shocking proportions. "Now, on
the average, consumers are
paying 28 percent of their in
come for debt services such as
paying interest on outstanding
debt." Sweezy noted that since
one-fifth of the upper income
households remain debt tree,
the burden of the debt is concen
trated on 80 percent of house
holds. "Nobody knows how far
that can go, but it clearly can't
reach 100," he said.
A second danger which
threatens both the U.S. and
world economies is the seem
ingly endless debt of the non-oil
producing Third World coun
tries. The poorest of these coun
tries need petroleum, but pro
duce only a small fraction, if
any, of their requirement. This
leads to increasing borrowing.
Sweezy emphasized the in
stability of the dollar as a final
problem facing the U.S. econo
my. In October of 1979, the
Carter administration rescued
the shaky dollar from a tumble

on the international exchange
markets. The U.S. govern
ment's policy ot raising the in
terest rate to protect the dollar
may work in the short run, but.
added Sweezy, this manipu
lation of the interest rate "is a
high ransom to pay to keep for
eign traders from exchanging
their dollars tor a more stable
currency."
"Nobody is panicking and
dumping dollars now, but if the
situation changes, then foreign
dealers will try to get out, too,"
he said. This would cause a
dollar crisis resulting in the dis
truction of the financial super
structure of the country.
Does the Reagan adminis
tration plan to solve these prob
lems? "If so, it certainly hasn't
leaked out," said Sweezy. There
is a "strange fairyland at
mosphere" in Washington with
the proposed balanced budget,
tax cuts, and at the same time, a
huge boost in the military ex
penditure, he added. "We're sit
ting on a domestic and interna
tional volcano which may ex
plode anytime."
