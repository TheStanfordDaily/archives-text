In 1978, Peter Matthiessen s
The Snow Leopard, a mystical
account of a trek into the Hima
layas, received the National
Book Award for nonfiction. The
Snow Leopard proved very pop

Its Zen philosophy and environ

mental awareness apparently
made it a must for campfire
reading Matthiessen's new
book. Sand Rivers, continues to
mine this same literary vein

probably be popular with the V'i

wilderness." the enormous and
little-known Selous Game Re

The Selous is an area larger
than Maryland that shelters
some of the last major popu
lations of rhinoceros, elephant,
buffalo, hippo, crocodile, lion,
and leopard on the African con
tinent The areas around the
Selous are almost devoid of hu
man population, so the reserve
doesn't suffer trom the
poaching which has depleted the
animal populations of the fa

and northern Tanzania In addi

Selous. on the other hand, con
tains three separate zones
within its boundaries, giving
biologists and other scientists
an unequalled opportunity to
study the native habitat of
Africa as it existed before the

Sand Rieyrs is intended to raise
the reader's consciousness re
garding the decimation of
African wildlife by poaching,
encroaching civilization, and
other nefarious forces. Instead,
for the most part, it bores.
The major problem is Mat
thiessen's writing style or. rath
er. lack ot style. Sand Rivers
should move the reader. It
should make you want to tramp
through the bush, or at the very
least write a check to your local
environmental group, but the
prose is so convoluted that you
eqd up apathetic. Matthiessen
works very hard at painting lyr
ical portraits of the animals and
their environment, most ot
which come off like high school
nature essays. Even his best
passages seem faintly pompous
and forced:
"There is a silence in the im
minence of animals and also in

the echo of their noise, but the
dread silence is the one that
rises from a wilderness from
which all the wild animals have
gone. "
At its worst, on the other
hand, the book is nearly un
readable. You're put otf even
from the opening sentences
"Between two thoughts, in
the month of August 1979, I dis
covered m\self with mild sur
prise on the evening flight from
London south to Dar-es-

I had made this journey which
in an airplane, at night espe

You get the feeling that Mat
thiessen is parading his con

and eight African porters should
be — and was intended to be —
the book's climax.
But Matthiessen's narration
continues to be overblown and
pretentious here. Nicholson, on
the other hand, is frequently
quoted, and this gruff, os
tensibly colonialistic, and fre
quently taciturn warden speaks
eloquently for the land. Beside
Nicholson, Matthiessen appears
a mere dilletante.
Thank God, then, for Hugo
van Lawick's photographs.
They convey the beauty and
grandeur, as well as the harsh
ness, of the Selous and its
animals in ways Matthiessen
can't hope to match. In fact, his
photographs are the only justifi
cation I can think of for shelling
out $20 for Sand Rivers.
It's doubtful that .Sand Rivers
will match the popularity
among backpackers of The
Snow Leopard. It is too depen
dent upon the photographs,
which would be far too small
and blurred in a paperback ver
sion; and no backpacker in his
right might is going to tote
around the hardback. Perhaps
the most comforting thing about
Sand Rivers is that it gives all

The Selous is an area larger
than Maryland that shelters
some of the last major popu
lations of rhinoceros, elephant,
buffalo, hippo, crocodile, lion,

tinent The areas around the
Selous are almost devoid of hu

Sand Rieyrs is intended to raise
the reader's consciousness re
garding the decimation of
African wildlife by poaching,
encroaching civilization, and
other nefarious forces. Instead,
for the most part, it bores.
The major problem is Mat
thiessen's writing style or. rath
er. lack ot style. Sand Rivers
should move the reader. It
should make you want to tramp
through the bush, or at the very
least write a check to your local
environmental group, but the
prose is so convoluted that you
eqd up apathetic. Matthiessen
works very hard at painting lyr
ical portraits of the animals and
their environment, most ot
which come off like high school
nature essays. Even his best
passages seem faintly pompous
and forced:
"There is a silence in the im
minence of animals and also in

the echo of their noise, but the
dread silence is the one that
rises from a wilderness from
which all the wild animals have
gone. "
At its worst, on the other
hand, the book is nearly un
readable. You're put otf even
from the opening sentences
"Between two thoughts, in
the month of August 1979, I dis
covered m\self with mild sur
prise on the evening flight from
London south to Dar-es-
Salaam, in Tanzania: how often
I had made this journey which
in an airplane, at night espe
cially. seemed as mysterious as
a rite of passage. Imperceptibly
during the night, in the silver
time capsule of the long flight
between continents, crossing
the moon shadows of the Old

Now that's not exactly the
sort of stutf to blow off
midterms for. is it?
You get the feeling that Mat
thiessen is parading his con
siderable knowledge of the vari

Selous. He's obviously a bird
lover. but one wonders whether
passages like the following
aren't simply meant to display
his familiarity with our feath

Selous by Matthiessen, the
safari's guide, a legendary
former game warden of the re
serve named Brian Nicholson,
and eight African porters should
be — and was intended to be —
the book's climax.
But Matthiessen's narration
continues to be overblown and
pretentious here. Nicholson, on
the other hand, is frequently
quoted, and this gruff, os
tensibly colonialistic, and fre
quently taciturn warden speaks
eloquently for the land. Beside
Nicholson, Matthiessen appears
a mere dilletante.
Thank God, then, for Hugo
van Lawick's photographs.
They convey the beauty and
grandeur, as well as the harsh
ness, of the Selous and its
animals in ways Matthiessen
can't hope to match. In fact, his
photographs are the only justifi
cation I can think of for shelling
out $20 for Sand Rivers.
It's doubtful that .Sand Rivers
will match the popularity
among backpackers of The
Snow Leopard. It is too depen
dent upon the photographs,
which would be far too small
and blurred in a paperback ver
sion; and no backpacker in his
right might is going to tote
around the hardback. Perhaps
the most comforting thing about
Sand Rivers is that it gives all
struggling writers hope: find a
good photographer and you can
publish almost anything.
