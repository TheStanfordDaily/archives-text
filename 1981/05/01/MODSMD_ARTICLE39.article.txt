The "best boy" is Philly Wohl, a 52-year-old Queens resident who
lives with his parents, likes to wash dishes, jumps up and down when
he is happy, and has trouble counting from one to 10. The in
terpenetration of "real" life and the "reality" captured on film in

this documentary is almost total. The movie is the account of
director Ira Wohl's three-year effort to give his cousin

Philly, who has been retarded from birth, the train-

ing he needs to be able to move into a supervised
residential community before his parents *

can no longer take care of him. The ac
tion flows around and behind the

camera and back again, and we
see none of the false perfor
mances that usually make this
kind of documentary so hard to
bear. The film doesn't chastise
the viewer; it is, in its own art
less way, exhilarating. Plays

Monday night only at

the New Varsity
Palo Alto.

Best Boy

Melvin and llouard
Mountain View Theater
The so-called "Mormon will"
story is the inspiration for
Jonathan Demme's Melvin and
Howard, an imaginative re
construction of the meeting be
tween Melvin Dummar (Paul Le
Mat) and Howard Hughes (Jason
Robards). '
There aren't any stock charac
ters in this movie; everyone has
idiosyncracies, f>ut Demme and
scriptwriter Bo Goldman don't
condescend to any of them The
major characters have been won
derfully drawn — and Demme and
Goldman have been fortunate in
their cast. As Lynda. Dummar's
first wife, Mary Steenburgen has
the perfect outlet tor her spacy
sexiness. Jason Robards towers
over the movie, even though he ap
pears only briefly at the beginning
and (in a flashback) at the end. No
actor has ever managed to look so
eccentric and so tragic at the same
time.
Double-billed with Coal Miner's

Hread and Chocolate***
Redwood City
A bittersweet, funny comedy
about an Italian immigrant who is
battered by the system when he
tries to find his dreams in Switzer
land's promised land The movie
has a compassion and warmth to it
that makes it eminently watch
able. Nino Mantredi. as the immi
grant, has one of those faces that
can make anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
tine as an immigrant from
Greece. Franco Brusati directed.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Come Have Coffee With Us.

Hardly Working *
Old Mill, Mountain View
Jerry Lewis doesn't smile much
in Hardly Working, his first movie
in about 10 years. There are fewer
jokes, and less schtick, here than
in any other Lewis movie I can
think of. He's no longer a likeable
klutz who gets swept into chaos by
the strength of his own good inten
tions. he's merely a klutz. When he
does something stupid, we don't

laugh, we politely avert our eyes.
It's not nice to laugh at people who
can't help themselves.
The movie is not without its mo
ments. In a simple, marvelous
scene, Lewis has a telephone con
versation with an answering ma
chine that chastises him for his
rudeness Offended, he wraps the
cord around his hand until the
voice chokes on its own words. If
Lewis had been as free, and as
tierce, with the rest of the movie
as he was with this scene, he might
have had a comeback on his hands.
Instead, he prepared something
that seems a lot more like a wake.

The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less as it"
does in the book, but the soul of the
work is gone.
Tess' centerpiece is Nastassia
Kinski. She is lovely. Looking at
her. one can almost believe that

she could, without in the least in
tending to, drive men to do terrible
deeds. But, and this is a big but,
she has an accent, and it's not just
a Cornish one It is difficult to con
centrate on her character's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum
mers on the banks of the Rhine.
The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation of
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo
ments." What he forgot to do, or
what he was atraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
and rereading the book.

Old Mill, Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a take feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending Lily
Tomlin. Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.

This interpretation of The
Who's 1973 album may or may not
be what you expected, but there's
a live-wire energy here that surely
does the world's greatest rock
band proud Music is of fundamen
tal importance to the kids popu
lating this gritty, realistic look at
the British Mods-Rockers clash of
the mid '60s. If anything else, this
movie makes the recent punk and
new wave movements much more
understandable.
Late show this weekend.

Saturday, Cubberley
Colin Higgins' prefab comedy
tries very hard to update
Hitchcock's comedy thrillers; it
ends up turning the droll
Hitchcock wit into the stuff of TV
sitcoms. The Goldie H a wn-Chevy
Chase pairing has its moments
(and Goldie is worth watching in
almost anything), but Chase's two
bit Cary Grant send-up wears thin
before the end is reached. Set in
San Francisco, the obligatory car
chase may make your head hurt.
Also starring Dudley Moore.

Excalibur * * *
Park, Menlo Park
By turns magnificent and pre
posterous, luminous and opaque,
this film of the Arthurian legend is
a tribute to director John
Boorman's freakish talent. Bad
writing wars with classical, pain
terly tableau battles and scenes in
which the fairy-tale grandeur of
the movie catches us up in the ro
mantic whirl of the story. The act
ing is highly variable: Nicol Wil
liamson is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin; Paul Geoffrey plays Sir
Percival feelingly; Helen Mirren,
as Morgana, has some high witchy
moments; and most of the other
principals are dwarfed by the stat
ure of the characters they are
playing, though Nigel Terry reads
Arthur's lines well — even mov
ingly.

Murder on the Orient Express
hit
Fox, Redwood City
Sidney Lumet directed this
stylish elegantly decorated, and
painfully slow-moving adaptation
of the Agatha Christie whodunit
Albert Finney makes a fine, self
parodying Hercule Poirot His sus
pects include Ingrid Bergman
(who, somewhat surprisingly, won
an Academy Award for her per
formance), Sean Connery, and
Lauren Bacall. As you might ex
pect, everything works out in the
end
Plays Sunday through Monday

New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is one of the few movies
that provides a good role for the
great French actor Gerard De
pardieu Playing a shaggy ex-con
in a chocolate-colored leather
jacket, he gives a sexy, funny per
formance Maurice Pialat's film
seems intended to be about empty
people who lead empty lives; how
ever. Depardieu is so life-embrac
ing that the signals get crossed
Cast opposite him is that gorgeous
cipher. Isabelle Huppert. Though
it shows signs of talent, l.ou Lou is
glum and amorphous.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with S'ta\ as You Are. an Italian
film which stars Marcello
Mastroianni and Natassia (Tess)
Kinski.

The Stunt Man * * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
It's the old theme of reality vs.
illusion, but in an astonishingly
witty new setting The director,
Richard Rush, reverses every au
dience expectation in this
audacious, kinetic comedy about
making movies. Peter O'Toole
gives an imaginative, self-de
lighted performance as Eli Cross,
a filmmaker who revels in risks,
and Steve Railsback plays the
stunt man. The cast also includes
Allen Goorwitz (who used to be
called Allen Garfield) in another
good performance (as a
screenwriter) and Barbara
Hershey (who used to be called
Barbara Hershey Seagull).

C.oal Miner's Daughter ★★★★
Mountain View Theater
A pretty terrific movie, made
that way by some great per
formances and by director
Michael Apted's eye for telling de
tail Country star Loretta Lynn's
rags-to-riches story is brought to
the screen with warmth and fine
humor. Even when, two-thirds of
the way through, the inevitable
heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and
comes out with its good nature in
tact.
Sissy Spacek portrays the
singer as if she and Lynn had been
best friends: her performance
suggests shared secrets and late-

night soul searching Tommy Lee I;
Jones and Beverly D'Angelo (as '<
Patsy Cline) turn in superb sup- :■
porting performances :•

Dr. Strangelove ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The greatest comedy ever made i
about the end of the world by nu- •
clear holocaust (it's even funnier •
than Panic in the Year Zero, and ;
that's funn\).
This is a saga of a nuclear war |
started by a madman (Rip Torn) •
and finished by high government:
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers We watch man
kind's hopes tor survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee Dr.
Stranueloue is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.
Starts next Thursday with
Heinu There.

Heaven's I*nteojf
Old Mill, Mountain View
After all the negative publicity
that Heaven's date has received,
it would be nice to report that the
doomsayers of four months ago
wouldn't know a great movie from
a hole in the ground It would be
nice to report a lot ot things But
they get angry at me here when I
make things up. so I feel bound to
tell the truth. Heaven's (late
stinks. Extensive editing has pro
duced a movie that runs a little
over two hours It seems much
longer. Michael Cimino, who
directed, has proved that Einstein
was right — time slows down on
the surface of a swiftly falling ob
ject The movie's darkest mystery
lies not on the screen but in
Cimino's head: Why was this mov
ie made in the first place? If he
knows the answer to it, he's not
telling anyone. In his effort to
make more than a western.
Cimino has created less than a
movie
