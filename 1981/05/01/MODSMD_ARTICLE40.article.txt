House modifies El Salvador policy
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Committee,
rebelling at a "blank-check' policy on El Salvador, wants
a ban on U.S. military aid and advisers unless President
Ronald Reagan certifies that the ruling junta is promoting
democracy and not abusing human rights
The stand, set forth in an amendment to the pending for
eign aid bill, was approved 26-6 Wednesday with support
from 18 Democrats and eight Republicans.
Administration officials said the amendment, which
sets six conditions for U.S. aid to the embattled Central
American republic, could tie the president's hands in for
eign affairs. Nevertheless, they added that nothing in the
measure conflicts with administration goals
To become effective, the amendment must be approved
by the full House and Senate. Congress then would have to
determine what conditions, if any. have not been met and
enact separate legislation to withdraw aid and advisers.
Japanese will not meet US car quota
Tokyo — A Japanese government plan to curb automo
bile exports tails short of what is needed to stop the U.S.
Congress from passing a mandatory quota bill. U.S. trade
officials said yesterday night.
In a generally negative assessment of the Japanese
plan, the US officials said they expected more proposals
to be made today when U.S. special trade representative
William Brock meets with Japanese officials.
The plan was spelled out to Brock yesterday night over
dinner, and although his precise response was not known,
it was clear trom comments of those present that he telt
the offer would not restrain car exports to levels desired
by Congress.
The U.S. sources said Brock did not reject the Japanese
plan because he is not here in the role of negotiator But he
was prepared to advise the Japanese on how Congress
would respond to the plan and it appeared that his advice
was in the negative.
The Congress is preparing to pass a quota that would re
strict annual import of Japanese cars to about 16 million
for three years.
The Japanese plan, sources said, would limit exports
roughly in the neighborhood of 1.7 million cars, a cut of
about 7 percent from last year's level. That meant a dif
ference of 100.000 cars between the Japanese and con
gressional plans.

deployed in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley after Is
raeli warplanes shot down two Syrian helicopters Tues
