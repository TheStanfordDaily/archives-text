## 
### Cynthia Moses 
In a recent letter sent to several
Cabinet members. President Donald
Kennedy and tour other university
presidents expressed concern about
federal attempts to apply export con
trols to academic teaching and re
search
The letter, sent to Secretary of State
Alexander Haig, Secretary of Com
merce Malcolm Baldridge, and Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger,
asked for clarification of Interna
tional Traffic in Arms Regulations
ilTAßi.and Export Administration
Regulations (EAR)
ITAR limits the export to any coun
try of technology, including technical
know-how, of military value. EAR
adds to this by limiting the export of
specified technology of commercial
value to certain countries
Presidents Marvin Goldberger of
California Institute of Technology,
Frank Rhodes of Cornell, Paul Gray of
Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy. David Saxon of the University of
California and Kennedy decided to
write the letter after the Department

of Commerce attempted to bar cer
tain scholars trom sponsored research
projects because they were foreign
nationals.
The president s were also reacting to
a memo, sent out by the director of the
Very High Speed Integrated Circuit
Program Office, which said the regu
lations were aimed at limiting "publi
cation ot unclassified university re
search results arising from Defense
Department sponsored projects,"
It has been Stanford's policy since
1969 not to take on classified research,
according to John Richey. associate
director of sponsored programs But
Kennedy joined the others in objecting
to what they see as a new emphasis on
all academic research, not just classi
fied research.
The letter says that ITAR «md EAR
"are not intended to limit academic
exchange arising from unclassified
research and teaching."
According to the presidents. "In the
broad scientific and technical areas
defined in the regulations,, faculty
could not conduct classroom lectures
when foreign students were present.

engage in the exchange of information
with torein visitors, present papers or
participate in discussions at symposia
and conferences where foreign na
tionals were present, employ foreign
nationals to work in their labora
tories, or publish research findings in
the open literature.
"Nor could universities, in effect,
admit foreign nationals to graduate
studies" in scientific or technical
areas. The regulations would be espe
cially difficult for foreign students in
those areas since publication is often a
prerequisite to graduation, according
to Richey.
With regards to unclassified ac
tivities, the presidents said that a pos
sible conflict with the First Amend
ment right guaranteeing free speech
must be resolved.
The University received acknowl
edgement of the letter, but has not re
ceived a response, according to Patri
cia Devaney, associate dean of gradu
ate studies and research.
The letter was made public April 9,
after a copy was obtained by Nature, a
British scientific magazine.
