# House nears decision on Reagan budget
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — The Democratic-con
trolled House raised the curtain on its
budget debate yesterday with Re
publican Leader Bob Michel declaring
that — "The way I've got it figured" —
President Ronald Reagan has the bat
tle won.
Less than 40 hours after the presi
dent personally appealed to a joint
session of Congress to act quickly on
his package of spending and tax cuts,
the House began deliberations that
will lead to a vote on whether to en
dorse a budget resolution backed bv
the president or a still-developing al
ternate plan being pushed by the Dem
ocratic leadership.
At the White House, Reagan

launched an Oval Office lobbying cam
paign. setting aside an hour for
private, one-on-one chats with four
Republicans believed to be wavering
An aide said Reagan would meet
with up to two dozen Republicans and
Democrats before the showdown vote
expected next Tuesday or Wednesday.
Despite growing Republican con
fidence. Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) insisted the progno
sis "looks a lot better" tor supporters
of a Democratic alternative budget
blueprint than it did earlier in the
week.
O'Neill said many Democrats are
beginning to have second thoughts
about backing the president's plan be
cause they realize the impact the ad
ministration's huge budget cuts would
have on their constituencies.
"It's suddenly hitting home out
there," he said.
But Michel (R-Ill.) replied, "The
speaker's whistling — whistling in the
darH."
O'Neill, told reporters that he was
"pounding it to" Democrats to make
them understand the impact ot voting
with Republicans on the budget cuts.
Michel said about 35 conservative
Democrats already have signed-on to
support the budget plan the president
backs. He expressed confidence that
GOP defections could be held to one or
two.
Asked if Reagan would have, the
votes to win, Michel replied that he
would.
In the Senate, GOP Leader Howard

Baker said Reagan is "building
momentum'' and will win passage of
his tax-cut plan this year. "And all the
major elements in it will be enacted,"
he said.
Reagan wants a three-year, across
the-board cut in personal income tax
es ot 30 percent, as well as iaster
write-ofts for business.
The Republicans control the Senate,
but in the House, the Democrats have
a 242-190 majority. As a result, Rea
gan would need a net gain ot 27 Demo
cratic votes to triumph on the budget
vote assuming all Republicans stood
firm with the administration.
Michel virtually dismissed the pos
sibility that a group of more than a
dozen restless Republicans from the
Northeast and Midwest will abandon
the president when the roll is called
He said the group wanted an op
portunity to "express concerns they
have" about some parts of the presi
dent's plan. "So we're giving them
that opportunity," he said, apparently
referring to the private sessions
scheduled with Reagan at the White
House.
The Democratic alternative calls
for more spending on social programs,
and leaves room for a one-year tax
cut. That would produce a balanced
budget in 1983, a year ahead of the
president's target.
The Democratic proposal originally
called for less defense spending than
Reagan requested. But Rep. W.G.
Hefner (D-N.C.) is sponsoring an
amendment to raise the defense

budget to the administration's own
level, a proposal with support among
conservative Democrats.
In the fight over the 982 budget, the
principal choices are a slightly re
vised version of Reagan s plan calling
for spending ot $688.8 billion and a def
icit of $31 billion, and a "Democratic
alternative" drafted by the Budget
Committee that, with amendments
blessed by the party leadership, calls
for spending ot $713.6 billion and a def
icit of $24.7 billion. But they are based
on different economic assumptions,
distorting numerical comparisons.
The main differences are that the
Reagan budget makes deeper cuts in
social programs than the Democratic
alternative and allows for Reagan's
across-the-board tax cut ot 30 percent
over three years, while the Demo
crats' version accommodates a
smaller one-year tax cut. The Demo
crats decided Wednesday to match
Reagan on defense spending in hopes
of attracting conservative support but
dropped a plan to outflank him on the
right by offering a budget that was bal
anced by deferring the personal tax
cut for a year.
The budget sets spending targets
only. Later votes will be taken on ac
tual money bills, although the budget'
mandates some cuts and requires that
money bills that exceed categorical
targets be laid aside until a final
budget is adopted. In the past. Con
gress always has spent more than it in
itially budgeted.
