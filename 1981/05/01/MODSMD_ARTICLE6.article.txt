# Linguistics offerings restructured
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
The Department of Linguistics is
restructuring its curriculum, with a
new graduate program started this ac
ademic year and a new undergraduate
linguistics major to replace the old
Human Language major next year.
Currently there are only half a
dozen Human Language majors, ac
cording to Elizabeth Traugott, who
chairs the department.
Until now, the department concen
trated on graduate research and
education. "Frankly, until now we had
not put a very large effort into theun
dergraduate program." Traugott
said. But that attitude changed.
The new major is different in that it
requires a specialization in one of
eight areas including, among others,
formal linguistics, the development of
mathematical models of linguistic
structure, speech production and per
ception, and the behavioral and physi
ological aspects of human com
munication.
Until now Human Language majors
had to select a program from four dif
ferent areas. "In the old major you got
a spread rather then depth," Traugott
said.
Assistant Prof. Lan Sag, the under
graduate adviser in the department
who has been developing the new ma
jor for the past year, said Human Lan
guage "was intended to be a general
interdisciplinary major that explored
linguistics as it related to other dis
ciplines."
Giving the program more structure

is an improvement, according to Leo
Cunningham, a junior here majoring
in the Human Language program.
"You could have completed the 45
units of the Human Language major
without taking many linguistics
courses," Cunningham said.
Another change is an increased
number of "hard core" linguistics
courses that have been taught only
sporadically on the undergraduate
level in the past, according to Cun
ningham.
One course, taught by Terry Wino
grad, an expert in computational
linguistics, focuses on the analysis of
natural language syntax and seman
tics — the information that may
enable computers to talk in the near
future. This subject was taught pre
viously only on a graduate level.
The department hired a new faculty
member recently to be able to com
plete the changes. He is John
Rickford, a linguist from Antigua who
is an expert on pidgin and Creole.
Cunningham is excited about the
changes. "I don't have to switch (from
the old to the new major) but I will,"
he said.
Cunningham said he picked the
Linguistics Department because of
his interests in anthropology,
cognitive psychology, philosophy and
lingustics. He said he hoped more peo
ple with similar interests would pick
the major.
"Lots of people have no clue as to
what linguists do," Cunningham said;
an opinion that both Traugott and Sag

echoed in saying, "most think that
they have to learn lots of languages."
Traugott would like to change those
misconceptions. Many of the new
courses are intended tor the non-ma
jor and will satisfy the distribution re
quirement.
The Linguistics Department
started as a committee of faculty and
graduate students from several dis
ciplines about 15 years ago. The em
phasis was on research but during the
1975-76 academic year the committee
became a department with an under
graduate major.
Linguistics does not necessarily
mean learning languages or esoteric
theories of grammar, according to
Traugott.
In the '50s there was a great deal of
excitement and research in mechani
cal translation. Everyone thought that
translation with computers was just
around the corner But it soon became
clear that this wasn't possible and the
problem was no longer considered im
portant. The problem still hasn't been
solved but it is back in fashion. Several
faculty members, including Winograd
are working on it.
"The department is going in many
directions, " Traugott said, "there is a
great deal more research into the rela
tion of language and the mind . . . how
we acquire language, how to teach it."
Overall the program is developing
into a more integrated one, according
to Traugott, and the major is good for
anyone interested in law, communica
tion or computer science.
