The Liberation Front is
headed by Son Sann. 70. a re
spected former Cambodian
prime minister who is currently
in Washington seeking U.S. sup

Diplomatic sources here said
that Son Sann was to meet with
Secretary ot State Alexander
Haig this week
Anti-Vietnamese coalition
Sihanouk was reported as
ready to join in an anti-Viet
namese coalition He had pre
viously insisted on a leadership
role in a broad armed coalition
The coalition would reach
from the Chinese-supported
Khmer Rouge, whose ultra-lef
tist regime was ousted from
Phnom Penh by the Vietnamese
invaders and now commands
the largest guerrilla force oper
ating inside Cambodia, to Son
Sann's anti-communist Free
Khmers.
Moreover, as Sihanouk had
been telling reporters in the
week since he arrived in Beijing
•from Pyongyang, he expects the

Reagan administration to be
more sympathetic to Cam
bodia's plight than its predeces
sor
Son Sann. who has political
respectability but few arms, has
up to now refused to join a coali
tion with the Khmer Rouge un
less it was stripped of its pres
ent leadership, including
former Premier Pol Pot. who is
widely regarded as a butcher by
his countrymen
The Chinese decision to supp
y Son Sann's men with arms
was regarded as a signal that a
political breakthrough had been
made enabling the Liberation
Front leader to join forces with
the Khmer Rouge
Khmer Rouge
Although widely feared and
hated bv the Cambodians, the

Khmer Rouge is regarded as the
only effective fighting force op
posing the Vietnamese
That is why Sihanouk insisted
on establishing his own military
force as part of the united front
"If I have no army, the people
will prefer to be protected by
the Vietnamese against the
Khmer Rouge because the peo
ple in Cambodia fear the Khmer
Rouge." he said
Unless China invades Viet
nam. said Sihanouk, "nobody
can threaten the life of the new
regime established by the Sovi
ets and the Vietnamese in Vien
Tune (Laos' and Phnom Penh
Since they have so good a base
tor their army, for their
hegemonism. how can you im
agine that the Russians could
give up°"
