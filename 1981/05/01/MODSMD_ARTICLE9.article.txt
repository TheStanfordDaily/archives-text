### Los Angeles Times 
Johannesburg, South Africa
— Prime Minister Pieter Botha
said yesterday that the mild set
back he and his party suffered in
Wednesday's national elections
would not deter him from conti
nuing to reduce racial dis
crimination.
Botha s National Party,
which introduced legalized dis
crimination against the coun
try's black majority shortly af
ter it came to power 33 years
ago. saw its sizable parlia
mentary majority reduced by
six seats in nationwide white
only voting Its popular support
declined by about 10 percent
from 1977 when the previous
parliamentary elections were
held
"We* will continue with the
direction we have taken and we
will not be pushed from our
course." Botha said He re
ferred to his promised reforms
in apartheid, the "separate de
velopment" of the country's 18
million blacks without anv

meaningful contact with whites
except as a labor force
Progressive Federal Party
The psychological winner in
Wednesday's elections was the
relatively liberal Progressive
Federal Party, which retained
all its 17 seats in the previous
Parliament and picked up nine
more. However. Botha's Na
tional Party will have 131 seats
in the new Parliament and can
easily override the PFP, headed
by 41-year-old Frederik Van Zyl
Slabbert
Nevertheless. Slabbert said,
the increased strength of his
party is a "clear message" to
the government that it must ac
celerate racial change.
In semi-official final returns
compiled Thursday. Botha s
National Party won its 131 seats
— a net loss of 6, with a popular
vote of 768,000.
Slabbert's Progressive Fed
eral Party won its 26 seats with
a popular vote of 262.000.
The middle-of-the-road New-
Republic Party won 8 seats, a

net loss of 2. with 104.000
The arch-conservative
Herstigte Nasionale Party
failed to win any seats, but piled
up a popular vote, of nearly
200,000 compared with 34,000
votes in the '977 general elec
tions It contested about half the
seats in Wednesday's elections
The newcomer National Con
servative Party also tailed to
put any candidates into Par
liament The party's leader
former Cabinet Minister Cor
nelius Mulder, thus tailed to
make a political comeback
Mulder was forced out of
Botha's government after a
scandal involving spending in
Mulder's Information Ministry
67 percent
The turnout across the nation
of white voters averaged about
67 percent of those eligible,
which was the same as in 1977
Under present South African
law, blacks have no vote except
in local contests in their tribal
areas
Mixed-race people or Asians
< mainly from India»also cannot
vote, even though they are South
African citizens and have no his
toric tribal areas as blacks do
However, in one of Botha's pros
pective reforms, mixed-race
persons, and Asians may soon
have some political rights.
But Botha, during recent
electioneering, told his white
constituents that he would never
relax apartheid to the point
where urban blacks would have
voting rights.
Slabbert's party, on the other
hand, advocates a meeting of
leaders of all races within South
Africa to formulate a means of
political power-sharing But
even Slabbbert shies away from
publicly commiting himself to
one-person, one-vote for blacks.
Slabbert's party won its most
stunning election victory in a
Cape Town area where a Botha
Cabinet minister. Dawie de Vil
liers was defeated by a young
provincial politician. Ken An
