# Hot-hitting Stanford sweeps top-ranked Sun Devils
## 
### Ralph Walker 
They say you don't always get
what you want, but this weekend
the Stanford men's baseball team
got more than even they had
bargained for.
By sweeping the No.l ranked Ari
zona State Sun Devils (18-3, 9-4.
16-4) at Sunken Diamond, the Cards
gained the inside track for second
place in the Southern Division of
the Pacitic-10 Conference.
Coming into the series, the Sun
Devils had lost only once in 24 pre
vious conference games. A single
Card victory seemed feasible —
two, bordering on the unlikely —
three, almost impossible.
"We never dreamed we'd sweep
them,'' said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess after the series had be
come history. "I wouldn't have im
agined it. How could you? I would
have taken two out of three
(beforehand) and not played the
series."
Stanford, now tied tor second
place with Arizona, can harness a
sure playoff berth with a sweep of
Cal next weekend. "We can control
our own destiny," said Marquess.
"We don't have to worry about oth
er teams."
"If two teams are going from the
SixPac, I'd like to see Stanford be
the second," said ASH third

baseman Mike Sodders after the
series, obviously impressed with
the Cards' performance.
Sun Devil coach Jim Brock was
more adamant. "I personally feel
that Stanford is the second best
team in the league. They're coming
into the own. It would be sad if they
just tell short."
The young Cardinals have cer
tainly appeared to put it together.
Throughout conference play, Stan
ford has generally suffered from
inconsistent pitching and defense,
but their success this weekend was
in large part due to a reverse in this
trend.
All five Stanford hurlers, de
livered stellar performances and
were backed by some key defensive
plays. "We finally took command
and didn't hurt ourselves with
bases on balls," said pitching
coach Tom Dunton. "They (the
Card hurlers) went right after
them."
Exemplary of the improvement
on the mound were Brian Myers
and Paul Grame. When Myers last
faced the Sun Devils, he rendered
nine runs on 15 hits in seven in
nings. In contrast, this weekend he
allowed only one earned run on five
hits in eight innings.
