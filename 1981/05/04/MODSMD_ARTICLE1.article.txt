# Hot-hitting Stanford sweeps top-ranked Sun Devils
## 
### Ralph Walker 
They say you don't always get
what you want, but this weekend
the Stanford men's baseball team
got more than even they had
bargained for.
By sweeping the No.l ranked Ari
zona State Sun Devils (18-3, 9-4.
16-4) at Sunken Diamond, the Cards
gained the inside track for second
place in the Southern Division of
the Pacitic-10 Conference.
Coming into the series, the Sun
Devils had lost only once in 24 pre
vious conference games. A single
Card victory seemed feasible —
two, bordering on the unlikely —
three, almost impossible.
"We never dreamed we'd sweep
them,'' said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess after the series had be
come history. "I wouldn't have im
agined it. How could you? I would
have taken two out of three
(beforehand) and not played the
series."
Stanford, now tied tor second
place with Arizona, can harness a
sure playoff berth with a sweep of
Cal next weekend. "We can control
our own destiny," said Marquess.
"We don't have to worry about oth
er teams."
"If two teams are going from the
SixPac, I'd like to see Stanford be
the second," said ASH third

baseman Mike Sodders after the
series, obviously impressed with
the Cards' performance.
Sun Devil coach Jim Brock was
more adamant. "I personally feel
that Stanford is the second best
team in the league. They're coming
into the own. It would be sad if they
just tell short."
The young Cardinals have cer
tainly appeared to put it together.
Throughout conference play, Stan
ford has generally suffered from
inconsistent pitching and defense,
but their success this weekend was
in large part due to a reverse in this
trend.
All five Stanford hurlers, de
livered stellar performances and
were backed by some key defensive
plays. "We finally took command
and didn't hurt ourselves with
bases on balls," said pitching
coach Tom Dunton. "They (the
Card hurlers) went right after
them."
Exemplary of the improvement
on the mound were Brian Myers
and Paul Grame. When Myers last
faced the Sun Devils, he rendered
nine runs on 15 hits in seven in
nings. In contrast, this weekend he
allowed only one earned run on five
hits in eight innings.

Stanford's big hitters in the sweep of No. 1 Arizona State this weekend in
cluded (left) catcher Bill Worden (15), who went 5-for-12 with a homer, and
shortstop Dave Meier (10), who had 10 RBI in the series. Leading the im
proved Cardinal pitching staff was righthander Paul Grame, (right) who
raised his record to 8-4 Saturday.
It was the same story for
Grame. who allowed seven runs
in one and two-thirds innings in
Tempe, compared to just two
earned runs in eight innings in
the second game on Saturday.
"It was the best stuff I've had
all year," said Grame. "I got all
four pitches over the plate to
day. When I pitched against
them in Tempe, I could only con
trol my fastball "
Grame had a good deal of help
from the defense, who came up
with a sparkling play in the very
first inning. With one out and
runners at the corners, ASU's
Ricky Nelson broke from first
on an apparent hit-and-run play
and was caught in a rundown af
ter catcher Bill Worden threw to
shorstop Dave Meier.
As Meier was tagging out
Nelson, Sun Devil Donnie Hill
broke for home from third, but
was met by a perfect throw
from Meier to complete the
double play. "When they made
that play," commented Grame,
"I said to myself, Hey, things
are going right today.' "
It is almost a given that the
Cards' offense will produce in
any series and this weekend was
no exception. "We hit the piss
out of the ball in Arizona," said
Meier, "and we just continued it
here."

Stanford's Mike Dotterer went seven-for-13 and stole two bases, one of which is shown above, in aiding
the Cardinals' three-game sweep of No.l ranked Arizona State this weekend at Sunken Diamond. Dot-;
terer set the Stanford reeord for hits in a season last week.
