# Classroom competition: playing for keeps
## Bio Prof. Ward Watt warns pressures for grades inhibit learning

The standard image of a sci
entist is someone who locks
himself in his laboratory, mixes
strange potions behind closed
doors, and emerges months lat
er with a discovery that shatters
the world
In appearance he is some
what dishevelled, has watery
blue eyes behind thick glasses
and walks with an ambling gait.
In appearance, he is the prov
erbial absent-minded professor.
Ward Watt, associate pro
fessor of Biology at Stanford, is
as far removed from this stere
otype as anyone could be. He is
vital, enthusiastic and cares
passionately about his students.
Having received three
degrees from Yale University
(8.5., M.S., and Ph.D. in
biology), Watt came to Stanford
12 years ago to teach. He has be
come increasingly disturbed
over the years with what he sees
to be destructive forces at work
in undergraduate education.
Because competition to get
into graduate school is becom
ing more and more severe, Watt
says, students these days find
themselves being pressured into
competing against each other
for better grades and recogni
tion from the start of their
freshman year.
"What we are seeing is a con
sistent pressure for com
petitiveness — against your fel
lows instead of your own pre
vious best efforts, for all kinds
of things which are not favor
able to creative mental activi
ty," says Watt.
Watt feels that judging stu
dents' ability in their freshman
year is a mistake, because they
have not yet had the chance to
develop their capabilities. He
feels that freshmen need to de
velop the capacity to study at
the intense level required at a
university and that this is some
thing that is not usually taught
at the high school level. Yet
before freshmen have the op
portunity to develop these abili
ties, they are faced with the
need to compete. As a result
many students never develop
their full potential. Sadder still,
many get destroyed in the proc
ess.

Watt suggests that one of the
ways to get around this problem
would be to make the freshman
year a uniform pass no credit
year, where people could take
introductory courses without
having to worry about getting
A s This type of system, which
has worked at other univer
sities, would allow students to
experiment with courses. All
too often, Watt says, students
make career choices based on
how they did in an introductory
course and these choices may
often be the wrong ones. He
feels that performance in an in
troductory course is not an ac
curate gauge by which to judge
someone's abilities. Many peo-

ple get discouraged when they
don't get high grades and this
often leads to them giving up the
subject completely, whereas in
fact, given a little more time,
they might have found that they
could have been good at it.
This is not entirely the stu
dent's fault. Watt advises that
certain departments and pro
fessors stipulate that an A'
must be obtained in an introduc
tory course if the student is to
continue with the subject. He
feels this is unfair, and quotes
the motto of the New York State
University system, "Let each
become all he is capable of
being." Watt says that Stanford
students aren't given the op-

portunity to do that
He feels that undergraduate
education has gotten away from
the idea of education and be
come more of a filter, a system
to weed out those who, for what
ever reasons, are not 100 per
cent capable of reaching the top,
or at least don't appear to be in
their freshman year
"What we are doing, not very
subtly, is setting up under
graduate education not as a de
veloper of ability, not as an
education at all, but as a filter,"
says Watt.
All these pressures are taking
their toll on students. Watt says
that he sees students suffering
from depression all the time,
and he has had this confirmed by
members of the Bridge counsel
ing service, who have told him
that more people than ever are
coming in suffering from de
pression as a result of the pres
sures of academic life.
Watt would like to see other
members of the staff and facul
ty becoming more concerned
about these issues. At the mo
ment he appears to be leading a
one-man crusade. "If more peo
ple become aware ot the prob
lem, then maybe something will
be done about it."
One thing is for sure. The days
when a majority of. students
went for what Watt calls "a gen
tleman's 'C'" are gone forever.
In their place we have an era of
students striving to outdo each
other. Many people get broken
in the process. University
should be a broadening and
learning experience. Instead, it
has turned into a rat race.
