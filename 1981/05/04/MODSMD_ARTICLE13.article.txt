## 
### Terry Butzerin 
University cyclists won their first West
Coast Championship on home turf yester
day, as Stanford hosted the West Coast In
tercollegiate Cycling Championships.
In spite of a second place performance in
yesterday's Stanford Criterium, the climax
of the championship meet, Stanford had
high enough total point standing in the over
all competition to beat out reigning UC-San
ta Barbara.
More than 150 cyclists from colleges
throughout the West thronged Escondido
Road yesterday afternoon to take part in the
Criterium. The Criterium, held here annual
ly, was the last event in the two-day cham
pionship competition.
Liz Newberry, co-president of the Stan
ford Cycling club, won first place overall in
the women's division, taking second place in
the time trials, second in the road race, and
first in the Criterium.
Time trials were held Saturday morning
in Woodside for both individual and four
man teams in the expert, women and novice

categories.
Novice Stanford rider Terry Keockle
placed third in the time trials, while Margi
Bethky, the other co-president of Stanford's
Cycling Club, tied for second in the women's
time trials. Bethky also received an hon
orary, "most aggressive rider" recogni
tion. Dawn Hirsch and Dave H U ntly also
gave notable perfomances.
Stanford's four-man team riding in the
expert category, Paul Mittlestadt, Richard
Swent, David Huntly and George Herm
mon, took second in the time trials.
The road race, a 28-mile loop over twisty
terrain in La Honda, was held Saturday af
ternoon. The course was covered twice by
experts, and once by novices and women.
Top places were taken by Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo men, while a San Fran
cisco state woman beat Stanford Liz New
berry tor first in the women's road race.
The Stanford Criterium course, which
covers a .7 mile loop around Wilbur and
Stern dormitories, is flat, but considered
challenging because of the number of turns

and the bicycle manuevers required.
The course must be covered 20 times (15
miles), for women, 40 times (28 miles) tor
men, and 28 times (20 miles) tor novices.
This is the second time Stanford has
hosted the Intercollegiate championships.
Last year the University team came in sec
ond, both in the championship race and ov
erall.
About 25 cyclists from Stanford's Cycling
Club have raced tor Stanford this season.
Bicyc\e season \asts from March to May,
and the six best scores trom 12 possible
races count toward team total points. The
championship race counts double toward
the team total score.
Stanford has only missed two races this
season, with three first place victories. San
ta Barbara scored the highest in yesterday's
competition, but had missed enough races
to frustrate its bid tor the title. Santa
Barbara has won three of the last six years,
since the Intercollegiate Championship was
organized.
