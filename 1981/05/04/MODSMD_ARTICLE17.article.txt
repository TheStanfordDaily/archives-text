## Another information bulletin, very slightly revised 
### 
Some clerical workers who have been
putting in a 40-hour week here at Stan
ford for years — and doing so without the
eager attentions of the outside world —
have suddenly found themselves the
benefactors of an amazing assortment ot
soliciting groups, organizations, institu
tions and individuals. First came union
organizers, then union officialdoms, then
management and its minions, and then —
last but not least — a number of self-ap
pointed spokespersons airing their
thoughtful views from the remotest
aeries of sympathetic understanding,
benign charity and — yes — even shining
altruism.
You remember how it all was for Stan
ford clerical workers before this great
commotion began. They were treated
just about like the waitress in your aver
age restaurant — essential but unseen.
Now I admit that that comparison could
be construed as a bit of egregious sex
stereotyping (there are male waitresses,
called "waiters," I believe, and even
male clerical workers — although you
would never know it from most of the lit
erature circulating around the campus),
but I am just going to leave it in here any
way, just as a lesson to myself to be more
judicious in my choice of words in the
future.
In any event, incredible as it may
seem in this enlightened day and age.
even some union organizations, leaders
and friendly partisans have for years ap
parently been capable of treating
"waitresses" in this dehumanizing
manner — and even of fairly well ignor
ing clerical workers as candidates for
their ministrations! Until just recently,
that is, now that union membership in
other occupations is on the decline and
dues are down along with the value of the
dollar. Now, as we all know, that has all
changed and the clerical workers are
being courted by them, and in fact, from
all sides with solicitous attentions.
There are, for example, those OSOC
fliers — so conspicuous for their scholar
ly erudition, lofty impartiality and un
deviating devotion to the straight
forward and unadorned presentation of
objective facts and related phenomena.
There are, too, those notorious Stanford
"Information Bulletins, Slightly Re
vised," (Daily, Apr. 22). Surely in the
boundless benevolence of Providence
some good, In the end, will come out of
all this.
A particularly promising harbinger of
this happy expectation is, I think, this

latter "Information Bulletin, Slightly
Revised" itself. Many readers were so
wonderfully uplifted by the nobility of its
attempt to avoid the dangerous reef of
sticking to the central issues, its brave
disdain for mere petty fact, and its
purposeful commitment to sail off in
stead for the deeper and more energizing
waters ot diatribe, irony, sarcasm and —
yes — even to utter obfuscation itself!
And it was all done so well and brilliant
ly. The use of the question-and-answer
form, for example, to so devastatingly
lampoon the insultingly degrading "lie
detector" format used by an evil and
malevolent official of Stanford Univer
sity in some "fact" sheet or other. "In
formation Bulletin, Slightly Revised" —
by definition cannot emanate from
sources such as that. That was proved
beyond a shadow of a doubt by the cogent
reasoning of its author.
So since, in the case of the "informa
tion Bulletin, Slightly Revised" the "lie
detector" format was so successfully
used as a means of communicating real
information and facts to the reader, I
thought it would be interesting to extend
it yet a little further in the form of a few
more "addenda." Here then, if you can
stand no more, are mine:
Q. How is a union like U.S.E. run?
A. By a benevolent and profoundly car
ing group of leaders magnanimously
elected by union members on behalf not
only of those who voted the union in, but
also those who voted against the union in
the first place and those who subsequent
ly choose not to join it.
Q. How do they govern?
A. By establishing a quorum of 15
members (out of a total membership of
many hundreds) who can then vote on
such trivial matters as (1) changes in the
organizational bylaws, (2) internal elec
tion rules, (3) setting of union dues (do
dues of any kind ever get lower?!), (4)
calls for special assessments, etc., etc.
Q. How do they cherish democracy?
A. By punishing (as secretly as pos
sible) those members who in their inno
cent veneration of the constitutional con
cept of free speech have the im
pertinence to voice dissident views, or
seek to have the union leadership
changed, or even — God forbid — talk
about decertification as a constitutional
possibility.
Q. But how can this be called "de
mocracy?"
A. Because the Union says that it is!
All sustainable doubts on this score were

irreversibly nullified by the definitive
pronouncement of one of U.S.E.'s lead
ers — M. Baratz — that "Unions are the
most democratic institutions on earth."
Q. But how can it be called democratic
to punish mere dissent?
A. Because in a true democracy the
leadership is always so outstanding that
it by definition knows what is best for the
people. This is sometimes called"'demo
cratic centralism" or "democracy from
above" in some of those evil foreign gov
ernments.
Q. But if any organization is led astray
by its leadership shouldn't it be possible
to replace the leadership or to at least
hold it accountable for its acts through
open debate?
A. Questioning the rules of the leader
ship is dissidence and dissidence is a pun
ishable offense in the Union. Dissidence
is not in the best interests of the Union.
Besides, the Union is not something sep
arate from you. It is you! Therefore by
definition it cannot act except in the best
interests of its membership!
Q. Are there any ontological implica
tions here? Theological analogies also
come to mind. Transubstantiation or the
doctrine of the Trinity — the mystical
paradox of those entities at once discrete
and One. Or, to be ecumenical about it
perhaps the mystical precepts of
Mahayana Buddhism.
A. The Union is not interested in
onotological implications, let alone the
ology.
Q. Well, if the Union is you, then what
about all of those people who have been
fired for not paying their dues, or who
have been fined for paying then late, or
who have been disciplined for "anti
union" activities? Is the Union "them,"
too?
A. They are simply ideologically im
mature at best and chronic malcontents
at worst/
Q. I wonder whatever happened to
some of those, though, who were fired at
the Union's request.
A. There are always some "human
istic" institutions around who will hire
unemployed malcontents for such jobs as
sweeping lawns, raising petunia plant
ings, building self-circulating, energy
saving fountains, providing them with a
loose dress code, very competitive
wages and working conditions, the free
dom to exercise their rights to dissent, as
well as the right to choose those or
ganizations with which they desire to be
affiliated.

Q. What is your definition ot a good
union organizer?
A. Someone who consistently instructs
all would-be union members to never
speak to their worst enemy on earth —
their supervisor — about the union.
Q. How much support does U.S.E. re
ceive from outside organizations?
A. There are broad bases of outside
support and they represent powerful na
tional unions.
Q. Does the Union then have lawyers
and funds tor legal actions against its ad
versaries and does it act on the advice of
hired lawyers to protect its interests?
A. That would seem like the natural
thing to do, wouldn't it?
Q. But then why do we read in the "In
formation Bulletin, Slightly Revised"
that money paid by Stanford University
to legal counsel to protect its interests is
"money . . . going down the drain?
Shouldn't then the Union release all of its
legal counsel and lower its dues for the
benefit of its membership?
A. As has been said before, the Union
is by definition Good and Management is
by definition Bad. Acts which — when
committed by the University are bad —
are — when committed by the Union —
rational and good!
Q. That is certainly a forceful
statement. I think, too, that it stands for
a lot of what you've been telling me so
far. I've learned an awful lot of interest
ing things and you can be sure they will
weigh heavily on my mind as I analyze
the issues in this campaign. Thanks for
the opportunity to learn!
And you, dear reader of the "Another
Information Bulletin, Slightly Revised,"
have you, too, learned a lot about the is
sues in this campaign? It is my sincere
hope that I have made that possible for
you, because as was so saliently the case
with the previous "Information Bulletin,
Slightly Revised," the firm intention be
hind this one has been to shun the facile
path of arguments raised in the heat of
misguided emotion and to rise above
mere rhetorical flourishes and personal
spite to the clear air of reason and logic.
In this the previous bulletin was a prime
inspiration. For when the dust which set
tled — and then turned to mud — has
turned to dust again — Union or not — we
will all still be here together and will
have to somehow make a go of it togeth
er.

more "addenda." Here then, if you can
stand no more, are mine:
Q. How is a union like U.S.E. run?
A. By a benevolent and profoundly car
ing group of leaders magnanimously
elected by union members on behalf not
only of those who voted the union in, but
also those who voted against the union in
the first place and those who subsequent
ly choose not to join it.
Q. How do they govern?
A. By establishing a quorum of 15
members (out of a total membership of
many hundreds) who can then vote on
such trivial matters as (1) changes in the
organizational bylaws, (2) internal elec
tion rules, (3) setting of union dues (do
dues of any kind ever get lower?!), (4)
calls for special assessments, etc., etc.
Q. How do they cherish democracy?
A. By punishing (as secretly as pos
sible) those members who in their inno
cent veneration of the constitutional con
cept of free speech have the im
pertinence to voice dissident views, or
seek to have the union leadership
changed, or even — God forbid — talk
about decertification as a constitutional
possibility.
Q. But how can this be called "de
mocracy?"
A. Because the Union says that it is!
All sustainable doubts on this score were

irreversibly nullified by the definitive
pronouncement of one of U.S.E.'s lead
ers — M. Baratz — that "Unions are the
most democratic institutions on earth."
Q. But how can it be called democratic
to punish mere dissent?
A. Because in a true democracy the
leadership is always so outstanding that
it by definition knows what is best for the
people. This is sometimes called"'demo
cratic centralism" or "democracy from
above" in some of those evil foreign gov
ernments.
Q. But if any organization is led astray
by its leadership shouldn't it be possible
to replace the leadership or to at least
hold it accountable for its acts through
open debate?
A. Questioning the rules of the leader
ship is dissidence and dissidence is a pun
ishable offense in the Union. Dissidence
is not in the best interests of the Union.
Besides, the Union is not something sep
arate from you. It is you! Therefore by
definition it cannot act except in the best
interests of its membership!
Q. Are there any ontological implica
tions here? Theological analogies also
come to mind. Transubstantiation or the
doctrine of the Trinity — the mystical
paradox of those entities at once discrete
and One. Or, to be ecumenical about it
perhaps the mystical precepts of
Mahayana Buddhism.
A. The Union is not interested in
onotological implications, let alone the
ology.
Q. Well, if the Union is you, then what
about all of those people who have been
fired for not paying their dues, or who
have been fined for paying then late, or
who have been disciplined for "anti
union" activities? Is the Union "them,"
too?
A. They are simply ideologically im
mature at best and chronic malcontents
at worst/
Q. I wonder whatever happened to
some of those, though, who were fired at
the Union's request.
A. There are always some "human
istic" institutions around who will hire
unemployed malcontents for such jobs as
sweeping lawns, raising petunia plant
ings, building self-circulating, energy
saving fountains, providing them with a
loose dress code, very competitive
wages and working conditions, the free
dom to exercise their rights to dissent, as
well as the right to choose those or
ganizations with which they desire to be
affiliated.

Q. What is your definition ot a good
union organizer?
A. Someone who consistently instructs
all would-be union members to never
speak to their worst enemy on earth —
their supervisor — about the union.
Q. How much support does U.S.E. re
ceive from outside organizations?
A. There are broad bases of outside
support and they represent powerful na
tional unions.
Q. Does the Union then have lawyers
and funds tor legal actions against its ad
versaries and does it act on the advice of
hired lawyers to protect its interests?
A. That would seem like the natural
thing to do, wouldn't it?
Q. But then why do we read in the "In
formation Bulletin, Slightly Revised"
that money paid by Stanford University
to legal counsel to protect its interests is
"money . . . going down the drain?
Shouldn't then the Union release all of its
legal counsel and lower its dues for the
benefit of its membership?
A. As has been said before, the Union
is by definition Good and Management is
by definition Bad. Acts which — when
committed by the University are bad —
are — when committed by the Union —
rational and good!
Q. That is certainly a forceful
statement. I think, too, that it stands for
a lot of what you've been telling me so
far. I've learned an awful lot of interest
ing things and you can be sure they will
weigh heavily on my mind as I analyze
the issues in this campaign. Thanks for
the opportunity to learn!
And you, dear reader of the "Another
Information Bulletin, Slightly Revised,"
have you, too, learned a lot about the is
sues in this campaign? It is my sincere
hope that I have made that possible for
you, because as was so saliently the case
with the previous "Information Bulletin,
Slightly Revised," the firm intention be
hind this one has been to shun the facile
path of arguments raised in the heat of
misguided emotion and to rise above
mere rhetorical flourishes and personal
spite to the clear air of reason and logic.
In this the previous bulletin was a prime
inspiration. For when the dust which set
tled — and then turned to mud — has
turned to dust again — Union or not — we
will all still be here together and will
have to somehow make a go of it togeth
er.
(Robert Mayer is a librarian at the Jack
son Library.)
Some clerical workers who have been
putting in a 40-hour week here at Stan
ford for years — and doing so without the
eager attentions of the outside world —
have suddenly found themselves the
benefactors of an amazing assortment ot
soliciting groups, organizations, institu
tions and individuals. First came union
organizers, then union officialdoms, then
management and its minions, and then —
last but not least — a number of self-ap
pointed spokespersons airing their
thoughtful views from the remotest
aeries of sympathetic understanding,
benign charity and — yes — even shining
altruism.
You remember how it all was for Stan
ford clerical workers before this great
commotion began. They were treated
just about like the waitress in your aver
age restaurant — essential but unseen.
Now I admit that that comparison could
be construed as a bit of egregious sex
stereotyping (there are male waitresses,
called "waiters," I believe, and even
male clerical workers — although you
would never know it from most of the lit
erature circulating around the campus),
but I am just going to leave it in here any
way, just as a lesson to myself to be more
judicious in my choice of words in the
future.
In any event, incredible as it may
seem in this enlightened day and age.
even some union organizations, leaders
and friendly partisans have for years ap
parently been capable of treating
"waitresses" in this dehumanizing
manner — and even of fairly well ignor
ing clerical workers as candidates for
their ministrations! Until just recently,
that is, now that union membership in
other occupations is on the decline and
dues are down along with the value of the
dollar. Now, as we all know, that has all
changed and the clerical workers are
being courted by them, and in fact, from
all sides with solicitous attentions.
There are, for example, those OSOC
fliers — so conspicuous for their scholar
ly erudition, lofty impartiality and un
deviating devotion to the straight
forward and unadorned presentation of
objective facts and related phenomena.
There are, too, those notorious Stanford
"Information Bulletins, Slightly Re
vised," (Daily, Apr. 22). Surely in the
boundless benevolence of Providence
some good, In the end, will come out of
all this.
A particularly promising harbinger of
this happy expectation is, I think, this

latter "Information Bulletin, Slightly
Revised" itself. Many readers were so
wonderfully uplifted by the nobility of its
attempt to avoid the dangerous reef of
sticking to the central issues, its brave
disdain for mere petty fact, and its
purposeful commitment to sail off in
stead for the deeper and more energizing
waters ot diatribe, irony, sarcasm and —
yes — even to utter obfuscation itself!
And it was all done so well and brilliant
ly. The use of the question-and-answer
form, for example, to so devastatingly
lampoon the insultingly degrading "lie
detector" format used by an evil and
malevolent official of Stanford Univer
sity in some "fact" sheet or other. "In
formation Bulletin, Slightly Revised" —
by definition cannot emanate from
sources such as that. That was proved
beyond a shadow of a doubt by the cogent
reasoning of its author.
So since, in the case of the "informa
tion Bulletin, Slightly Revised" the "lie
detector" format was so successfully
used as a means of communicating real
information and facts to the reader, I
thought it would be interesting to extend
it yet a little further in the form of a few

loose dress code, very competitive
wages and working conditions, the free
dom to exercise their rights to dissent, as
well as the right to choose those or
ganizations with which they desire to be
affiliated.

Q. What is your definition ot a good
union organizer?
A. Someone who consistently instructs
all would-be union members to never
speak to their worst enemy on earth —
their supervisor — about the union.
Q. How much support does U.S.E. re
ceive from outside organizations?
A. There are broad bases of outside
support and they represent powerful na
tional unions.
Q. Does the Union then have lawyers
and funds tor legal actions against its ad
versaries and does it act on the advice of
hired lawyers to protect its interests?
A. That would seem like the natural
thing to do, wouldn't it?
Q. But then why do we read in the "In
formation Bulletin, Slightly Revised"
that money paid by Stanford University
to legal counsel to protect its interests is
"money . . . going down the drain?
Shouldn't then the Union release all of its
legal counsel and lower its dues for the
benefit of its membership?
A. As has been said before, the Union
is by definition Good and Management is
by definition Bad. Acts which — when
committed by the University are bad —
are — when committed by the Union —
rational and good!
Q. That is certainly a forceful
statement. I think, too, that it stands for
a lot of what you've been telling me so
far. I've learned an awful lot of interest
ing things and you can be sure they will
weigh heavily on my mind as I analyze
the issues in this campaign. Thanks for
the opportunity to learn!
And you, dear reader of the "Another
Information Bulletin, Slightly Revised,"
have you, too, learned a lot about the is
sues in this campaign? It is my sincere
hope that I have made that possible for
you, because as was so saliently the case
with the previous "Information Bulletin,
Slightly Revised," the firm intention be
hind this one has been to shun the facile
path of arguments raised in the heat of
misguided emotion and to rise above
mere rhetorical flourishes and personal
spite to the clear air of reason and logic.
In this the previous bulletin was a prime
inspiration. For when the dust which set
tled — and then turned to mud — has
turned to dust again — Union or not — we
will all still be here together and will
have to somehow make a go of it togeth
er.

Some clerical workers who have been
putting in a 40-hour week here at Stan
ford for years — and doing so without the
eager attentions of the outside world —
have suddenly found themselves the
benefactors of an amazing assortment ot
soliciting groups, organizations, institu
tions and individuals. First came union
organizers, then union officialdoms, then
management and its minions, and then —
last but not least — a number of self-ap
pointed spokespersons airing their
thoughtful views from the remotest
aeries of sympathetic understanding,
benign charity and — yes — even shining
altruism.
You remember how it all was for Stan
ford clerical workers before this great
commotion began. They were treated
just about like the waitress in your aver
age restaurant — essential but unseen.
Now I admit that that comparison could
be construed as a bit of egregious sex
stereotyping (there are male waitresses,
called "waiters," I believe, and even
male clerical workers — although you
would never know it from most of the lit
erature circulating around the campus),
but I am just going to leave it in here any
way, just as a lesson to myself to be more
judicious in my choice of words in the
future.
In any event, incredible as it may
seem in this enlightened day and age.
even some union organizations, leaders
and friendly partisans have for years ap
parently been capable of treating
"waitresses" in this dehumanizing
manner — and even of fairly well ignor
ing clerical workers as candidates for
their ministrations! Until just recently,
that is, now that union membership in
other occupations is on the decline and
dues are down along with the value of the
dollar. Now, as we all know, that has all
changed and the clerical workers are
being courted by them, and in fact, from
all sides with solicitous attentions.
There are, for example, those OSOC
fliers — so conspicuous for their scholar
ly erudition, lofty impartiality and un
deviating devotion to the straight
forward and unadorned presentation of
objective facts and related phenomena.
There are, too, those notorious Stanford
"Information Bulletins, Slightly Re
vised," (Daily, Apr. 22). Surely in the
boundless benevolence of Providence
some good, In the end, will come out of
all this.
A particularly promising harbinger of
this happy expectation is, I think, this

latter "Information Bulletin, Slightly
Revised" itself. Many readers were so
wonderfully uplifted by the nobility of its
attempt to avoid the dangerous reef of
sticking to the central issues, its brave
disdain for mere petty fact, and its
purposeful commitment to sail off in
stead for the deeper and more energizing
waters ot diatribe, irony, sarcasm and —
yes — even to utter obfuscation itself!
And it was all done so well and brilliant
ly. The use of the question-and-answer
form, for example, to so devastatingly
lampoon the insultingly degrading "lie
detector" format used by an evil and
malevolent official of Stanford Univer
sity in some "fact" sheet or other. "In
formation Bulletin, Slightly Revised" —
by definition cannot emanate from
sources such as that. That was proved
beyond a shadow of a doubt by the cogent
reasoning of its author.
So since, in the case of the "informa
tion Bulletin, Slightly Revised" the "lie
detector" format was so successfully
used as a means of communicating real
information and facts to the reader, I
thought it would be interesting to extend
it yet a little further in the form of a few
more "addenda." Here then, if you can
stand no more, are mine:
Q. How is a union like U.S.E. run?
A. By a benevolent and profoundly car
ing group of leaders magnanimously
elected by union members on behalf not
only of those who voted the union in, but
also those who voted against the union in
the first place and those who subsequent
ly choose not to join it.
Q. How do they govern?
A. By establishing a quorum of 15
members (out of a total membership of
many hundreds) who can then vote on
such trivial matters as (1) changes in the
organizational bylaws, (2) internal elec
tion rules, (3) setting of union dues (do
dues of any kind ever get lower?!), (4)
calls for special assessments, etc., etc.
Q. How do they cherish democracy?
A. By punishing (as secretly as pos
sible) those members who in their inno
cent veneration of the constitutional con
cept of free speech have the im
pertinence to voice dissident views, or
seek to have the union leadership
changed, or even — God forbid — talk
about decertification as a constitutional
possibility.
Q. But how can this be called "de
mocracy?"
A. Because the Union says that it is!
All sustainable doubts on this score were

irreversibly nullified by the definitive
pronouncement of one of U.S.E.'s lead
ers — M. Baratz — that "Unions are the
most democratic institutions on earth."
Q. But how can it be called democratic
to punish mere dissent?
A. Because in a true democracy the
leadership is always so outstanding that
it by definition knows what is best for the
people. This is sometimes called"'demo
cratic centralism" or "democracy from
above" in some of those evil foreign gov
ernments.
Q. But if any organization is led astray
by its leadership shouldn't it be possible
to replace the leadership or to at least
hold it accountable for its acts through
open debate?
A. Questioning the rules of the leader
ship is dissidence and dissidence is a pun
ishable offense in the Union. Dissidence
is not in the best interests of the Union.
Besides, the Union is not something sep
arate from you. It is you! Therefore by
definition it cannot act except in the best
interests of its membership!
Q. Are there any ontological implica
tions here? Theological analogies also
come to mind. Transubstantiation or the
doctrine of the Trinity — the mystical
paradox of those entities at once discrete
and One. Or, to be ecumenical about it
perhaps the mystical precepts of
Mahayana Buddhism.
A. The Union is not interested in
onotological implications, let alone the
ology.
Q. Well, if the Union is you, then what
about all of those people who have been
fired for not paying their dues, or who
have been fined for paying then late, or
who have been disciplined for "anti
union" activities? Is the Union "them,"
too?
A. They are simply ideologically im
mature at best and chronic malcontents
at worst/
Q. I wonder whatever happened to
some of those, though, who were fired at
the Union's request.
A. There are always some "human
istic" institutions around who will hire
unemployed malcontents for such jobs as
sweeping lawns, raising petunia plant
ings, building self-circulating, energy
saving fountains, providing them with a
loose dress code, very competitive
wages and working conditions, the free
dom to exercise their rights to dissent, as
well as the right to choose those or
ganizations with which they desire to be
affiliated.

Q. What is your definition ot a good
union organizer?
A. Someone who consistently instructs
all would-be union members to never
speak to their worst enemy on earth —

is by definition Good and Management is
by definition Bad. Acts which — when
committed by the University are bad —
are — when committed by the Union —
rational and good!
