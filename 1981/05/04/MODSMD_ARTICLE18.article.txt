ring. When you turn off the
lights, I've got to hand it to me,
Looks lihe its me and you again

Did you see this article in The
New Republic?
What article?
It's called "Stanford
Diarist." The author seems to
think that the sexual outlet used
by most Stanford students is
masturbation. Listen to this:
"At Stanford, the number who
enjoy sexual relations with the
kind of regularity that adults
take for granted is miniscule.
The prevailing sexual outlet to
day, as it was a decade ago, is
masturbation."
That's ridiculous.
Don't think it's true?
It depends how you define
"sexual outlet." I mean, there
may be more individual acts of
masturbation. . .
Okay, I see the point.
Anyway, what about that sur
vey in Innidi- Stanford? Didn't it
show that most people at Stan
ford had active sex lives?
Oh, come on. Inside Stanford
had a table set up in White
Plaza, and only the people who
came over and filled out their
questionnaire got included in
the final results. I just don't
think very many people went up

to the table and said that they
spent most of their time
masturbating. There's no way
you can do an accurate sex sur
vey — people lie about sex all
the time.
Well, how does the guy who
wrote the article know?
He says that he talked to his
students.
Let me see that. Wait a sec
ond, I know this guy — he's my
advisor! I can't believe this.
Why?
Are you kidding? The only
students this guy talks to are
men. He doesn't even know the
names of his female advisees.
So? Is that unusual?
No, but still ... if he's going
to write an article on sex at
Stanford, at least he should talk
to a /cm- women.
Maybe he should have found
out what kind of masturbation
they do.
Come on, that's disgusting.
I'm serious. What do people
think about while doing it? Do
pre-med students think about
their grade point average?
I used to have a fantasy
about. ..
Yes?
Never mind.
Oh, come on, please tell me.
Well, I used to have this fan
tasy about making love on all
my "A" papers.
Yes! While the other person
shouts the best comments —

"excellent! penetrating
analysis!" Or how about mak
ing love on your business school
acceptance letters? "If I'm
good enough to get into
Harvard, I'm good enough to get
into you!"
You're so foul. A woman
would never have that kind of
fantasy.
I was just reading an article
in Time about S & M, and it said
that S & M, necrophilia, that
"Lolita" complex. . .
You mean a woman would
never do any of those things?
Are you kidding? Pay to be
beaten by a man in a black
leather outfit? Seduce little
boys?
What about women who don't
have sex at all? Anatole France
said that of all sexual aberra
tions, chastity is the strangest.
Well, at least women don't
write about their sexual aberra
tions in The New Republic. And
chastity's not as bad as some of
the perverted attitudes that
men have. Remember that sex
issue of Chappie?
You mean with Hoover Tow
er. . .?
Yes!
I still think he's got a point.
For all the interest in sex at
Stanford, I wonder how much
actually goes on.
Don't ask me. I don't live in a
dorm.
Rut that's just the point. He

says that even with co-ed dorms
and fewer barriers between the
sexes, people still haven't
changed. They still think that
premarital sex is wrong. Listen
— "Students find themselves in
the ironic position of being
thought libertines by their
elders, while leading from those
of the previous generation."
Do you agree with that?
I agree with Joe Namath
when he said that if you're not
going all the way, why go at all.
What?
I mean, there may be less cas
ual sex at Stanford than most

people think, but this guy under
estimates the number of serious
relationships. Making love isn't
just a "sexual outlet," an alter
native to masturbation, and if
he tried talking to a wider group
of students, he might realize
that.
Let's stop talking about this,
alright?
Okay. How about going to
Trocadero?
Sounds good to me. Got your
teddy bear?
