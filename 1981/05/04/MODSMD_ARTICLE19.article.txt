## Gay still separate and unequal 
### 
In the past dozen years, gay
liberation has made huge ad
vances. On campus, as well as
throughout the nation, gay peo
ple have ceased to be an in
visible minority. We are re
establishing our history, and de
veloping our own culture — the
tirst steps toward establishing
a sense ot community. How
ever, comparable advances
have not been made in the area
of civil rights for gay people. We
are very often living on the edge
of legality, relying on liberal in
terpretation ot laws for our ex
istence.
The Gay People's Union has

existed in one form or another
since the early : 970's. It is now
just one of a halt-a-dozen gay
groups on campus, and its Gay
Awareness Week (starting to
day with a noon rally in White
Plaza) has become an annual
event. In that time, the visibility
of lesbians and gay men has
greatly increased, to the point
that "coming out" is now more
likely to be met by yawns than
by gasps.
Although the feeling is not
universal, tolerance of gay peo
ple is commonplace. This op
timistic attitude is not based
solely on day-to-day encounters.
There are many instances
where our viewpoint has been
valued as distinctive and signifi
cant: GPU was represented on
the presidential search commit
tee which chose Donald Ken
nedy to head the University; the
Gay Speaker's Bureau is regu
larly asked to make a presenta
tion at Herant Katchadourian's
Human Sexuality; RA's in the
dorms are questioned on their
attitudes towards gay people
before being hired, and are
trained to deal with gay people
in the dorms; Hillel sought out
gay people to participate in its
liberation Seder last year and in
its commemoration of the Holo
caust last week.
There are still those on cam
pus who would rather that we
did not exist. There are even
more who are made uncom
fortable by our sex lives, and
who would rather that we kept
"being gay" to the bedroom. I
do not know how widespread
these attitudes are. I do know
that I am able to behave almost
as freely as any straight student
on campus.
The generally tolerant at
titudes towards gay people have
deceived many into thinking
that gay liberation is no longer
an issue here. It is difficult to
document cases of overt dis
crimination. Because gay peo
ple typically choose to keep
their homosexuality secret, it is
often easier to find another job
or apartment than to face the
strains of coming out during the
complaint process. This has
caused administrators and law
makers to argue that there is no
need tor legislation and policy
which protect gay people.
The gay faculty and staff have
been protected for several years
by their employment contract.
There is no similar protection
for gay students. This is not
widely known; in fact, last year
former University president
Richard Lyman wrote a letter to
the Daily denying it.
Openly gay people can be re
fused admission to Stanford
solely for being gay. The admin
istration has repeatedly denied
that this has ever happened, or
that anything except academic
related information would ever
be taken into account during the
admissions process. In an era
when members of the Moral
Majority are publicly calling for
our imprisonment and execu
tion, such verbal promises offer
little comfort.
The refusal to go on record as
protecting the civil rights of gay

people is not unique to this uni
versity. The Carter adminis
tration behaved in much the
same way. Although I am grate
ful tor the advances gay people
made nationally under Carter,
civil rights that are dependent
on the whims of political expe
diency are not civil rights.
A typical example is the
treatment ot gay foreigners. Be
cause the Immigration Depart
ment continues to use an out-of
date document trom the Ameri
can Psychiatric Association
that labels homosexuality as a
"sexual perversion," gay peo
ple are not allowed to visit this
country. Although the law was
embarassing internationally, it
was considered politically dan
gerous to change it during the
election campaign. Instead, pol
icy was modified so that only
those people who explicitly
stated that they were gay would
be stopped.
Such behavior was marginal
ly acceptable under an adminis
tration that was tolerant of gay
people. We may not have been
legally protected, but we could
behave as if we were. However,
that was before the rise of the
Christian right. Under the ban
ner of "pro-family," gay people
are being blamed for many of
the problems facing America
today. In the past we were fight
ing for legislation to protect us;
now we must also fight against
legislation which openly dis
criminates against us.
We have already lost some of
these battles. Last fall, the
House of Representatives voted
overwhelmingly to cut off gay
organizations from the Legal
Services Corporation. Far more
seriously, the Family Protec
tion Act will soon be introduced
in the Senate. It states that "no
federal funds may be made
available ... to any public or
private individual, group, foun
dation, commission, corpo
ration, association, or other en
tity which presents homosex
uality, male or female, as an al
ternative lifestyle or suggests
that it can be an acceptable life
style."
Living near San Francisco
has made many gay people com
placent. We have certainly
made a mark on the area. We
have our own neighborhoods,
politicians, performing groups,
churches, and community cen
ters. There are so many of us
here, that it is difficult to im
agine how anti-gay backlash in
other parts of the country could
ever make real inroads in the
Bay Area.
In truth, though, we have no
protection. Our present situ
ation, wonderful as it can be, is
dependent on the goodwill (or
political savvy) of those admin
istering the laws. After the ex
treme oppression of the fifties
and sixties, the last decade has
seemed like freedom. It wasn't.
We were only out on parole.

existed in one form or another
since the early : 970's. It is now
just one of a halt-a-dozen gay
groups on campus, and its Gay
Awareness Week (starting to
day with a noon rally in White
Plaza) has become an annual
event. In that time, the visibility
of lesbians and gay men has
greatly increased, to the point
that "coming out" is now more
likely to be met by yawns than
by gasps.
Although the feeling is not
universal, tolerance of gay peo
ple is commonplace. This op
timistic attitude is not based
solely on day-to-day encounters.
There are many instances
where our viewpoint has been
valued as distinctive and signifi
cant: GPU was represented on
the presidential search commit
tee which chose Donald Ken
nedy to head the University; the
Gay Speaker's Bureau is regu
larly asked to make a presenta
tion at Herant Katchadourian's
Human Sexuality; RA's in the
dorms are questioned on their
attitudes towards gay people
before being hired, and are
trained to deal with gay people
in the dorms; Hillel sought out
gay people to participate in its
liberation Seder last year and in
its commemoration of the Holo
caust last week.
There are still those on cam
pus who would rather that we
did not exist. There are even
more who are made uncom
fortable by our sex lives, and
who would rather that we kept
"being gay" to the bedroom. I
do not know how widespread
these attitudes are. I do know
that I am able to behave almost
as freely as any straight student
on campus.
The generally tolerant at
titudes towards gay people have
deceived many into thinking
that gay liberation is no longer
an issue here. It is difficult to
document cases of overt dis
crimination. Because gay peo
ple typically choose to keep
their homosexuality secret, it is
often easier to find another job
or apartment than to face the
strains of coming out during the
complaint process. This has
caused administrators and law
makers to argue that there is no
need tor legislation and policy
which protect gay people.
The gay faculty and staff have
been protected for several years
by their employment contract.
There is no similar protection
for gay students. This is not
widely known; in fact, last year
former University president
Richard Lyman wrote a letter to
the Daily denying it.
Openly gay people can be re
fused admission to Stanford
solely for being gay. The admin
istration has repeatedly denied
that this has ever happened, or
that anything except academic
related information would ever
be taken into account during the
admissions process. In an era
when members of the Moral
Majority are publicly calling for
our imprisonment and execu
tion, such verbal promises offer
little comfort.
The refusal to go on record as
protecting the civil rights of gay

people is not unique to this uni
versity. The Carter adminis
tration behaved in much the
same way. Although I am grate
ful tor the advances gay people
made nationally under Carter,
civil rights that are dependent
on the whims of political expe
diency are not civil rights.
A typical example is the
treatment ot gay foreigners. Be
cause the Immigration Depart
ment continues to use an out-of
date document trom the Ameri
can Psychiatric Association
that labels homosexuality as a
"sexual perversion," gay peo
ple are not allowed to visit this
country. Although the law was
embarassing internationally, it
was considered politically dan
gerous to change it during the
election campaign. Instead, pol
icy was modified so that only
those people who explicitly
stated that they were gay would
be stopped.
Such behavior was marginal
ly acceptable under an adminis
tration that was tolerant of gay
people. We may not have been
legally protected, but we could
behave as if we were. However,
that was before the rise of the
Christian right. Under the ban
ner of "pro-family," gay people
are being blamed for many of
the problems facing America
today. In the past we were fight
ing for legislation to protect us;
now we must also fight against
legislation which openly dis
criminates against us.
We have already lost some of
these battles. Last fall, the
House of Representatives voted
overwhelmingly to cut off gay
organizations from the Legal
Services Corporation. Far more
seriously, the Family Protec
tion Act will soon be introduced
in the Senate. It states that "no
federal funds may be made
available ... to any public or
private individual, group, foun
dation, commission, corpo
ration, association, or other en
tity which presents homosex
uality, male or female, as an al
ternative lifestyle or suggests
that it can be an acceptable life
style."
Living near San Francisco
has made many gay people com
placent. We have certainly
made a mark on the area. We
have our own neighborhoods,
politicians, performing groups,
churches, and community cen
ters. There are so many of us
here, that it is difficult to im
agine how anti-gay backlash in
other parts of the country could
ever make real inroads in the
Bay Area.
In truth, though, we have no
protection. Our present situ
ation, wonderful as it can be, is
dependent on the goodwill (or
political savvy) of those admin
istering the laws. After the ex
treme oppression of the fifties
and sixties, the last decade has
seemed like freedom. It wasn't.
We were only out on parole.

In the past dozen years, gay
liberation has made huge ad
vances. On campus, as well as
throughout the nation, gay peo
ple have ceased to be an in
visible minority. We are re
establishing our history, and de
veloping our own culture — the
tirst steps toward establishing
a sense ot community. How
ever, comparable advances
have not been made in the area
of civil rights for gay people. We
are very often living on the edge
of legality, relying on liberal in
terpretation ot laws for our ex
istence.
