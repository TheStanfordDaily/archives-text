### Washington Post 
Washington — About 25,000 demon
strators, brought together in a loose
coalition of special interest groups
trom around the country whose causes
ranged from gay rights to Palestinian
autonomy, marched on the Pentagon
yesterday to protest U.S. military in
volvement in El Salvador and Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's proposed cuts
in domestic social programs.
Massing early yesterday in the Con
stitution Gardens just north of the Lin
coln Memorial, the orderly and youth
ful crowd formed a colorful river of
jeans and T-shirts as they set out past
the State Department and over Memo
rial Bridge to the Pentagon.
As they marched, carrying banners
for their causes, they chanted along to
slogans broadcast from speakers
mounted on the roof of a rented yellow
Ryder truck:
"Money for jobs, not for war, U.S.
out of El Salvador."
"Stop Atlanta murders, down with
the Junta."
"Gay-straight, black-white, same
struggle, same fight."
"No cuts, no way, make the bankers
pay"
Traffic was tied up for several hours
along the march route. U.S. Park Po
lice and D.C. Police estimated the
crowd at about 25,000.
The demonstration was reminiscent
of the Vietnam anti-war rallies a dec
ade ago. The crowd that gathered on
the Pentagon's mall side included rep
resentatives of labor, religious, anti
draft and anti-war groups, as well as
homosexual, black, Indian and His
panic rights groups.
But the demonstration differed
markedly from those of the '60s, which
resulted in pitched battles between
demonstrators and police. Yester
day's minions carried a tew placards
and repeated a tew chants, but some
also took time to eat picnic lunches,
smoke marijuana, drink beer and
work on their tans.
In San Francisco, thousands of
chanting, sign-carrying demonstrat
ors marched through the streets yes
terday to protest everything from U.S.
intervention in El Salvador to cuts in
the federal domestic budget.
The march, which snaked for more
than a mile as it moved from the Fed
eral Building to a rally scheduled at

Dolores Park, represented groups in
cluding the Gray Panthers, the Social
ist Labor Party, Christians For Peace
and Women For Peace.
The marchers, chanting, "The
workers united will never be de
feated," slowed traffic on Market
Street as they walked through the city,
stopping occasionally to ofter pam
phlets to spectators.
The protesters, mainly young and
white, carried colorful signs and ban
ners reading "Reagan: Our Hitler"
and "Cut Military Spending, Not So
cial Programs," and asked for an end
to draft registration, the nuclear arms
race and proposals to cut the domestic
budget.
At the Washington demonstration,
only one arrest was made. A youth
threw a red substance on one of the
Pentagon's columns, Federal Protec
tion Service police reported. No seri
ous injuries were reported.
By 5:30 p.m. (EDT) the crowd
began to disperse, some on foot, oth
ers reloading some of the 300 to 500
buses that brought them from New
England, the Midwest and South.
The well-orchestrated or
ganized by the People's Anti-War
Mobilization and the Ad Hoc May 3
Unity Committee, went off smoothly,
with only a minor confrontation be
tween the marchers and some demon
strators from the Collegiate Associa
tion for Research of Principles
(CARP), a body associated with Rev.
Moon's Unification Church which is
calling for U.S. intervention in El
Salvador to rid it of Russian and Cuban
communist influence.
Many of those interviewed yester
day — from long-haired hippie hold
outs with painted faces and L.L. Bean
clad outdoorsmen to health-conscious
joggers who had stopped by to witness
the spectacle — said they had come,
not so much to protest U.S. interven
tion in EL Salvador as to voice their
dissaproval with the state of the na
tion under Reagan and the state of the
world in general.
The demonstration took on a flea
market atmosphere, with college stu
dents sitting next to Hispanic migrant
farm workers, sitting next to leftist
feminists, sitting next to government
workers from the American Feder
ation of Government Employees.
