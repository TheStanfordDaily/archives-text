## Atlanta victims suffered poverty 
### Washington Post 
Atlanta — The tragedy of the
children ot Atlanta has focused
the nation's attention on some
thing many would rather not
think about: the pathology of
poverty and the ugly things it
does to children.
Now there are 27 victims,
missing or murdered by a mys
terious killer or killers preying
only on poor young blacks, most
ly boys. Police have made no ar
rests in 21 months.
The pathetic nature of some
of these children's stories rivals
the horror ot their murders.
Consider Terry Pue, 15, one of 10
children whose family once
spent two nights in a hospital
emergency room because it had
no place else to go.
Finally, his father toli him
he'd just have to fend for
himself. So he tried, alone on the
streets, hustling to make it,
sleeping with friends, or some
times in vacant houses.
Urban Tom Sawyer
Aaron Jackson, 9, an inner
city Tom Sawyer, was on his
own at all hours of the day or
night, often barefoot and dirty.
Once a neighbor found him
curled up on her couch. He'd
gotten hungry, broken into her
house, raided her refrigerator,
and fallen asleep.
"Ghetto children are usually
left alone with an overburdened
mother, or an absentee mother
who has the dual job of raising a
family and earning a living, so
they try to make their own fami
ly units among peers outside the
home, on the street," said
Charles King, director of Atlan
ta's Urban Crisis Center.
Many of the victims lived by
their wits on ghetto chutzpah,
vying for the attention of too few
parents among too many
brothers and sisters.
Tough guys
No killer would ever get
them, they were too "bad."
Some, like Timothy Hill, 13,
brandished pipes and knives and
bragged that they would catch
the killer — him, or it, or them

— and reap the $100,000 reward
that goes begging. Each child
was pursuing his own American
Dream. And he figured the only
way to get it was with money.
"Money is the ticket in the
ghetto, like everywhere else,"
King said.
So many of the victims took to
the streets to make their own
way, running errands for elder
ly neighbors, carrying grocer
ies, scrubbing whitewalls at the
car wash, hustling to earn their
own spending money and to aug
ment their families' meager in
comes. Curtis Walker, 13, gave
half of what he made to his
mother.
Children too independent
Under normal circum
stances, the hard-knocks path
would have made these children
survivors. But these are not nor
mal times in Atlanta, and the
children's early independence
and ambition made them vul
nerable to a calculating killer
who was able to penetrate their
defenses. Their yearning to es
cape poverty drove them onto
the streets and made them
available.
"What surprises me," said
King, "is that these children,
who understood the name of the
game, could be victimized by
someone who could lure them
into a situation without any sign
of combat. They weren't car
ried away. They wanted to go."
Calculating predator?
Everyone has a theory. "In
my view," one FBI agent said,
offering his own, "the (prima
ry) killer is not a raving lunatic
but a calculating predator. If he
doesn't get what he wants to
night, he waits until tomorrow
night. He's careful. If he needed
to satiate some need and
couldn't wait, he'd act anytime
the need arose, and would have
made a mistake by now. He
hasn't made a mistake."
Police have been left with lit
tle to go on — no crime scene, no
witnesses, no weapon — just
bodies: 22 black children be
tween the ages ot 9 and 16, all

boys except two, and four young
black men small enough to look
like children, two of them men
tally retarded. One child, Dar
ron Glass, 10, remains missing.
Ten have turned up dead since
January.
The FBI said it believes it
knows who killed as many as
four of the children. Those
cases, however, are not be
lieved to be connected with at
least a dozen "pattern killings,"
presumed committed by the
same killer or killers.
All black, all poor
These, and perhaps more, are
tied together by circumstantial
evidence, ranging from curious
fibers found on the bodies, cause
of death, the location where the
bodies were discovered and si
miliarities in the victim's
street-wise profiles. The one
thread weaving all the victims
together is that they were all
black, all poor.
Two children were so hungry
for money that they became in
volved with homosexuals, po
lice sources said.
The bodies have been found in
woods, oft deserted country
roads and, lately, in rivers.
Eight victims have been found
in or near rivers, leading au
thorities to speculate that the
killer has been following news
accounts about evidence being
found on some bodies and wants
to wash away any clues. Others
believe bridges just offer the
fastest means of disposal.
Seven victims have turned up
wearing only undershorts, fuel
ing police speculation about a
sexual motive.
Curfew working
The fact that four recent vic
tims were adults leads some of
ficials to believe that the city's
curfew for children under 16 and
increased parental vigilance
may be depriving the killer or
killers of available children.
"The kids were taken because
they were available and vulner
able, and the vulnerability was
made possible by the poverty in
which they lived," said Joseph

Lowery, president of the South
ern Christian Leadership Con
ference.
"As long as homes are over
crowded and children feel they
have to get out to make ends
meet and expose themselves
and become street-wise, then
society has to bear part of the
blame," he said
When the killings began in
July 1979, few beyond the vic
tims' families paid attention.
Only after angry mothers pro
tested months later did officials
take a closer look at the
murders. The establishment of
a special police task force took a
year, after a dozen children had
died.
Camille Bell and some other
mothers say they believe some
thing would have been done
sooner it the children had been
white, or from families of
middle-class blacks who run
city government.
