# Mother must pay restitution after daughter found guilty
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — In an unprecedented case,
the mother of a 15-year-old girl found respon
sible tor the murder and robbery of a cab
driver here has agreed to pay restitution to the
victim's family.
Under terms of an order issued by Superior
Court Judge Anthony Kline, the mother,
Carolyn Wright, will pay a total of $85 in
monthly installments — an amount equal to the
funeral expenses incurred by the mother ot the
murdered driver, Albert Hohl.
The agreement to pay restitution, although
voluntary, came after Judge Kline had ruled
that he had the authority to require the
payments under the law and had indicated he
might well do so.
Kline addressed the young girl, Sharon
Wright, at the conclusion of a lengthy hearing
on Friday. As she wiped tears from her cheeks,
the judge said:
"I am pleased that you and your mother vol
unteered willingly to make this payment. . . .
That indicates a start towards rehabilitation.
It is important that you see restitution not as a
penalty, but as an opportunity to express to a
woman whose son you have taken the guilt you
teel." •
Restitution has been ordered by judges
before, mainly as a condition to probation tor
an adult offender who has stolen or destroyed

property. But. according to lawyers in the
case, this is the first time restitution has been
imposed on the parent ot a juvenile involved in
a murder.
The restitution order was issued under pro
visions of the California Welfare and Institu
tions code granting Juvenile Court judges au
thority to issue orders involving parents of de
linquent children "as the court deems neces
sary and proper for the best interests of or the
rehabilitation ot the minor."
The order was hailed by Assistant District
Attorney James Lassart, who had urged
restitution as a means ot forcing parents to ex
ercise more control over their children and in
ducing children to accept greater responsi
bility for their acts.
"This is unprecedented," Lassart said fol
lowing the hearing. "In this instance, it will be
the first step in the rehabilitative effort and in
the best interests of the child. "
Sharon Wright was believed to be the
youngest female ever charged with murder in
San Francisco. Hers was the first case tried
here publicly under a new law authorizing open
hearings tor minors charged with serious
crimes.
Her attorney had strongly opposed restitu
tion, protesting it on the grounds that Judge
Kline had no constitutional right to impose it.
