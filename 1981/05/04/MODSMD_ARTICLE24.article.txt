# Administration modifies optimism

### Washington Post 
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
shifted gears just a little when he delivered
his pitch to Congress for passage ot his
budget cuts and his three years' worth ot
business and personal tax reductions.
He distinctly toned down claims for what
the program would produce.

News analysis

Gone from Tuesday's speech were the ad
ministration's earlier assertions that near
instant changes in "expectations" would
quickly produce miracles of lower inflation
and interest rates, and thereby spur eco
nomic growth.
"Because ot the extent of our economy's
sickness," Reagan said instead, "we know
that the cure will not come quickly, and that
even with our package, progress will come
in inches and feet, not miles."
Administration officials are in fact
puzzled and worried that their rapid
progress toward cutting federal spending
has had so little impact in financial markets

where long-term interest rates are climbing
swiftly rather than falling as the president's
advisers said they would.
However, no specific spending cuts were
outlined, and more than half that amount
will be needed just to offset higher-than-an
ticipated costs ot existing programs,
sources said.
As part of his Tuesday night sales speech,
the president also stressed the bad econom
ic news of the six months since the election.
In that half-year, he said, the nation has ex
perienced continued double-digit inflation,
mortgage interest rates averaging almost
15 percent, unemployment of almost 8 mil
lion people, a drop in the average worker's
hourly earnings (alter adjusting tor infla
tion), and more than 6000 business failures.
He cited these figures to increase the
pressure on Congress to act. He told Con
gress that, to turn the economy around, it
had to start with the budget. But here, too,
the real world does not appear to be behav
ing quite as predicted; the federal budget is
only one of many factors affecting the econ

omy, and not necessarily the most impor
tant.
Reagan, ticking off statistics, chose to ig
nore some very real signs that the short
term outlook for both unemployment and in
flation has already improved.
While the economy apparently has been
on a plateau since January, there is little ev
idence of declines, except in housing con
struction and auto sales. And even in autos,
the manufacturers were able to wipe out
their overhang of unsold cars with their ex
tensive program of rebates during the first
quarter ot the year.
Unemployment, at 7.3 percent of the work
force in March, was as much as one-half a
percentage point lower than many fore
casters thought it would be at that point.
Moreover, there are indications from week
ly claims tor unemployment benefits that it
did not rise significantly in April.
In short, the recession predicted for this
spring and summer by economists both in
and out ot government has not arrived on
schedule, and a growing number of are
doubtful it will come at all.
