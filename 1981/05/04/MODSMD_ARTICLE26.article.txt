## Golfers nab 10th By Sally Jenkins

How much heartbreak can a
poor coach take? The Sun Devil
Classic was going to be it for
men's golf coach David Yates,
the tournament when the Cards
broke into the big time, one of
the top five finishers, right up
there with USC. The self-de
scribed "eternal optimist" is
not so happy-go-lucky anymore,
describing the Stanford per
formance this weekend in Arizo
na as "dismal," and "lack
luster," among other things.
The Cardinals shot an 1137 in
the three-day tournament, held
at Phoenix, Arizona, a respect
able enough score, placing them
10th in the field. The per
formance was characteristic of
the Cardinals play so tar this
season, with one or two players
shooting scores decent or bet
ter, the rest mediocre.
Yates has taken the results in
stride thus far, with incredible
resiliency in fact, always look
ing for the breakthrough that
would push his team into the top
five on the leader board. Before
that breakthrough can happen,
however, all six of the Cardinals
competing in a tournament have
to play well at the same time.
The ideal conditions for just
such a breakthrough can be
found at the Stanford Golf

Course, beginning this after
noon. Stanford hosts the Pacif
ic-10 championships through
Wednesday afternoon and ac
cording to Yates, his team could
have a very real shot at the title.
"We are back on our own home
course this weekend, and it may
relax us. We are comfortable
here, so we have a chance if a
couple of the kids get hot."
Yates said.
Freshman Tim Robinson has
consistently been hot for the
Cardinals, to the extent that he
is now emerging as a favorite to
win the individual Pac-iO title.
He shot 220 to place eighth in a
field of 100 goiters at the Sun
Devil, and was actually on his
way to second place, what could
have been his best finish of the
year, on the back nine of the
final round. Instead, he bogied
two of the last three holes when
he found a trap on 16, and three
putted the 18th green.
San Jose State won the team
overall with UOO. USC was one
shot back, followed by ASU
(1108), Brigham Young (1109),
and San Diego State (1112).
Yates expects USC and ASU to
take the lead in the Pac-10's, but
also points to Stanford, Oregon
State, and UCLA as teams
capable of surprising per
formances.
