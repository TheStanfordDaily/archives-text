If you are one of those folks who thrive on short
explanations, Friday's match at Stanford Tennis
Stadium can be explained such: the Cardinals
won the big points and Cal didn't. That reason
alone explains the rather large 8-1 final margin.
One match went to the last possible point before
it went Stanford's way. Another stretched to the
end of the second set before going to the Cards. A
third lasted to 7-5 in the third set before Stanford
took it.
When the results were in, however, the hosts
were 16-0,8-0 in the Pacific-10 Conference and the
national front-runner going into the regular sea
son's final week. The Bears fell to 21-8 and 5-3 in
league play, and now find themselves in a must
win situation this weekend against USC in order to
get to the NCAA championship tournament.
"We could have so easily been 3-3 or even 2-4
going into the doubles," said a relieved Stanford
coach Dick Gould. "If we're lucky it's 3-3 and who
knows what happens in doubles?"
Gould worried about doubles because of his
team's lackadaisical performance against Pep
perdine Thursday. With the team match clinched
after singles, the Cards dropped two of three
doubles matches.
But that didn't happen Friday, even after Mike
Bauer and Yair Wertheimer blitzed Jetf Arons
and Mike Falberg 6-0 in the first set in No. 1
doubles. The Stanford duo came back on the upper
end of two 7-5 scores, while the other two teams
won in straight sets.
That Falberg and Arons were ahead of Tim
Mayotte and Jim Gurfein was a surprise. Both
teams rank behind Scott Bondurant and Scott
Davis, but with the former out with a neck injury,
Mayotte and Gurfein had played No. 1 doubles
against Pepperdine. Now, after starting the sea
son at No. 1, they may find themselves playing
third.
Gould was evasive, saying "We (the team) will
talk about it next week." But he added, "I felt our
strongest lineup was out there today."
Falberg was more straightforward. When

asked it he thought he and Arons should be playing
No. 2 he replied, "Yes I do. Our record (10-0,
Pac-10 champions) shows it." Arons was a bit
more diplomatic.
"Either team could win at No. 2. It's not that
clear-cut who should play two. We're really
even," he said. "They've gotten a couple of bad
breaks and we've gotten some good ones."
Arons knows about breaks — he's had a lack of
them all year in singles. But he received one Fri
day when he ran into a guy who's in an even deeper
slump than he is. Cal's Phil Lehnhoff was the heir
apparent to the No. 1 spot in his lineup this year.
He, like Arons, is struggling at the bottom of the
lineup because of physical as well as non-physical
(confidence) problems.
Arons gutsily took the Slump Bowl 4-6, 6-2, 7-6
(5-4). The junior fought off tour match points on
Lehnhoff s serve in the ninth game of the final set
before his service game held up in the tiebreaker.
His racket flew in celebration when he won the 4-
all tiebreak point, perhaps the first time it wasn't
thrown in disgust in 16 matches. It was his first
ever win against Cal.
"It's about time I won one. I didn't feel like I
was hitting it very well but I concentrated harder.
He's the best player I've played this year," Arons
said.
In the battle of best players, Bauer defeated
Mayotte for the second time this season, 5-7, 6-2,
6-3. Both players agreed that it was not their best
tennis. They are both hard hitters, yet they played
defensively, trying to make the other player make
the mistake. Mayotte made more.
"Instead of passing shots I would just hit one
more shot," Bauer said. "Maybe the day will
come when we both play well and we'll see who's
better."
