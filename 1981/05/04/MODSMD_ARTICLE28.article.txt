# Track team splits against Cal
## 
### Paul Brewer 
Saturday's running of the "Big Meet" with
California brought mixed results for the
Stanford track teams. The Cardinal women
provided most of the excitement at Stanford
Stadium, as they gave a superb performance in
downing the Bears, 70-58. In the other half of
the meet, the Bears scored a predictably one
sided victory over the Stanford men, 95-58.
The Cardinal men have not beaten the Bears
since 1971. After the Big Meet of that year
Stanford actually led the series with 41 wins, 35
losses, and two ties. The Cards have gone a full
decade since then without topping the Bears,
and the series now stands at 45-41-2 in Cal's fa
vor.
The relatively low point differential of Sat
urday's meet was due in part to several no
shows from Cal, with several athletes ex
perimenting in new events. Nevertheless,
much of the excitement of the day was gener
ated by fine Cardinal performances.
Star thrower Dave Thomson had his best day
of the season against a tough Cal weight squad,
scoring personal bests in both the hammer
throw (213-2) and the discus (184-7). The ham
mer throw ranks him as the second-best Amer
ican collegiate thrower of the season.
John Schaer, who hasn't lost a 1500-meter

race all year, kept his record intact by winning
the metric mile in 3:51.2, just ahead of team
mate Dennis Arriola, who stopped the clock at
the Darrin Nelson broke up Cal's
strong sprinting corps by finishing in a dead
heat tor first place in the 100 meters with Baer
runner Derek Robinson.
The perennially tough Cal women actually
outscored the Cardinals on the track, but the
field eventers carried the home team to vic
tory by dominating all but one of the jumping
and throwing events. Three freshmen, Carol
Cady, Ellen Lyons, and Pam Donald, proved to
be the backbone of the Card squad as they com
bined to score almost half of the team's win
ning point total.
Cady won the shot put and placed third in the
javelin, before hurling the discus 172-6, which
was a school record, national caliber throw,
and easily good enough to win the event.
Distance runner Lyons set a Stadium record
of 9:37.3 in leading a Stanford sweep of the 3000
meters, and later clinched the Stanford team
victory by winning the 1500.
A usual solid all-around performance was
delivered by sprinter-jumper Donald as she
won the long jump, took second in the two short
dashes, and ran a strong leg on the winning 400-
meter relay team.
