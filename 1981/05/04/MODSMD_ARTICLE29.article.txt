Two ot Pleasant Colony's
probable opponents from the
Derby field are runnerup Wood
chopper, who went off at 30-1,
and third place finisher Partez.
Two who will not be in the
Preakness field are Proud Ap
peal, who coupled in the betting
with Golden Derby, went off as
the tavorite and Cure the Blues,
the third choice after Pleasant
Colony.
Proud Appeal finished 18th
and Cure the Blues was 15th.
Tap Shoes, another leading con
tender, finished 14th, and he is
not expected to go to the Preak

"My horse ran for fun today.
He won easy," said Campo after
Pleasant Colony, racing in the
blue and white"silks of Thomas
Mellon Evans' Buckland Farm,
won by three-quarters of a
length in the time of 2:02 for the
IV4 miles.
In bringing Campo and top
jockey Jorge Velasquez their
first Derby victories, Pleasant
Colony charged from eighth
with a quarter-mile remaining
into a L Vfe-length lead with one
eighth mile to go.
Sandy Hawley was second on
Partez with an eighth-mile left,
then he briefly stood in the irons
at the sixteenth pole.
Boston (AP) — The Boston
Celtics, led by Larry Bird's 23
points, completed their re
markable playoff comeback
Sunday by wiping out an J l-point
second-half deficit and beating
the Philadelphia 76ers 91-90 to
move into the National Basket
ball Association's cham-

Bionship series against the
ouston Rockets.
The 76ers led 67-56 during the
third quarter and still clung to
an 89-82 advantage with 5:23 left
in the intensely physical sev
enth game of the Eastern Con
ference finals. But Boston
scored nine straight points, the
last four by Bird, while holding
Philadelphia scoreless for 4:54.
Cedric Maxwell sank one free
throw and Nate Archibald sank
two, center Robert Parish made
a turnaround jumper and Bird
converted two free throws to tie
the score 89-89 with 2:51 to go.
Bird, the 1980 Rookie of the
Year, then came back with a 15-
toot bank shot from the left side
for a 91-89 lead with 1:03 to play.
Following a pair of turnovers,
Philadelphia had a 3-on-l
tastbreak, and Maurice Cheeks
was fouled by Gerald Henderson
with 2t seconds on the clock. He
made just one of two free
throws to leave Philadelphia

trailing by one.
M.L. Carr missed a 20-footer
for Boston, and Philadelphia's
Bobby Jones gathered in the re
bound and called time out with
one second left. Jones' inbounds
pass bounced oft the top ot the
backboard, and the Celtics had
the emotion-charged victory.

Boston (AP) — The Boston
Celtics, led by Larry Bird's 23
points, completed their re
markable playoff comeback
Sunday by wiping out an J l-point
second-half deficit and beating
the Philadelphia 76ers 91-90 to
move into the National Basket
ball Association's cham-

Bionship series against the
ouston Rockets.
The 76ers led 67-56 during the
third quarter and still clung to
an 89-82 advantage with 5:23 left
in the intensely physical sev
enth game of the Eastern Con
ference finals. But Boston
scored nine straight points, the
last four by Bird, while holding
Philadelphia scoreless for 4:54.
Cedric Maxwell sank one free
throw and Nate Archibald sank
two, center Robert Parish made
a turnaround jumper and Bird
converted two free throws to tie
the score 89-89 with 2:51 to go.
Bird, the 1980 Rookie of the
Year, then came back with a 15-
toot bank shot from the left side
for a 91-89 lead with 1:03 to play.
Following a pair of turnovers,
Philadelphia had a 3-on-l
tastbreak, and Maurice Cheeks
was fouled by Gerald Henderson
with 2t seconds on the clock. He
made just one of two free
throws to leave Philadelphia

trailing by one.
M.L. Carr missed a 20-footer
for Boston, and Philadelphia's
Bobby Jones gathered in the re
bound and called time out with
one second left. Jones' inbounds
pass bounced oft the top ot the
backboard, and the Celtics had
the emotion-charged victory.
