# 'Curricular Choice' study expanded via donation

The Metropolitan Life Foundation has donated
$5000 to the Undergraduate Studies program here to
fund an off-shoot of the existing "Patterns of Cur
ricular Choice" study.
That study, which Herant Katchadourian, dean of
undergraduate studies, initiated five years ago, was
created to determine what patterns exist between
student's backgrounds and their choice of and per
formance in different courses.
Previously, a student's background data in
cluded : major, race, social background, SAT scores
and a number of other factors. The new grant
funded study will apply a student's sex as well to the
academic records and try to incorporate that into
the wider "Curricular Choice" program.
The curriculum study has been taking the aca
demic information for each of the graduating
classes since 1976 when Katchadourian decided Un
dergraduate Studies had to do a lot more research.
With that data and the background information,
Katchadourian. Registrar Sally Mahoney and Re

search Coordinator John Boli have been trying to
find out who is taking classes in the different depart
ments and where students from those departments
are taking their non-major courses. The study is
geared towards determining what kind of people
there are in the various classes here.
"Take the psychology department for example,''
said Boli. "We want to know where the various psy
chology majors are taking their outside units. We
also want to know what other types of students are
taking psychology courses. We do that for all the de
partments to find out if backgrounds are different in
different areas of study (here)."
The new emphasis on a student's sex as a de
termination of choice will look at differences in how
men and women choose their courses. The concen
tration will be on how grade performances in vari
ous classes affect men versus women when choosing
a major, changing one or taking non-major courses.
"We want to see, in the pre-med program, for ex
ample, how women perform as compared to men

and how any differences in performance could re
late to their respective decisions to stick with it or
take different courses," Boli said. "This will not be
a complicated study about the differences between
the sexes," he added. "We will just be dealing with
selective, academic criteria."
The original curriculum study program is essen
tially completed at this point, and it is hoped that the
new study will be finished in about six months.
Katchadourian and Mahoney will work together to
document the program in a book which they expect
to complete by the end of the year. It has not yet been
determined whether the new study will be finished
in time to be included, but those involved believe it
will.
The "Curriculum Report," academic data which
the registrar's office has produced each year tor the
curriculum study, will continue in the years ahead
"The program is on the computer now and we expect
that there will be related studies in the future," Boli
said.
