Soviets break up Holocaust Day gathering
Moscow — Soviet security police prevented several hundred
Jews from Vneeting in a forest outside Moscow yesterday to com
memorate victims of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews per
ished during World War 11.
Witnesses said that uniformed and plainclothes police Saturday
sealed off a forested recreational area about 25 miles east of Mos
cow where the gathering was to be held and posted signs at the
nearby Ovrazhki railroad station, declaring the zone closed for
"sanitary cleaning."
Yesterday morning, police agents surrounded the Moscow
apartment buildings of at least 11 Jewish families, some of whom
helped plan the gathering, and prevented them from leaving their
apartments for much of the day.
Yesterday's action was seen as fresh evidence of escalating re
pression against all kinds of organized but unsanctioned activity
by Soviet Jews. In a campaign that began last November with the
arrest of Jewish activist Viktor Brailovsky, police have sup
pressed a wide variety of informal seminars on science, religon.
Jewish culture and history, jnusic and theater. For many Jews —
especially the refuseniks, those people denied permission to leave
but who have also lost their jobs — the seminars were a way to
stay in touch with their professions and remain intellectually
alive.
NATO ministers prepare to pressure U.S.
Rome — Foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization gathered here yesterday, prepared to put heavy pres
sure on the United States to fix a timetable for opening arms-con

trol discussions with the Soviet Union
NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns said that he "hoped that
a date for talks would be fixed here" bv Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig. who is attending his first NATO council meeting in
his new civilian role. But. Luns continued, if the date is not fixed
here then he "would expect it to be fixed" at a meeting of NATO
defense ministers scheduled in Brussels on May 12, which will be
attended by U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
The NATO secretary-general struck a raw nerve of the Reagan
administration, which is clearly having trouble making up its own
mind about the timing of arms-control talks.
The Dutch would like some move on arms control out of this
meeting in order to help stem the tide of a strong anti-nuclear po
litical movement in Holland in advance of general elections for a
new Parliament, which will take place on May 26
Israel: Get Syrian missiles out of Lebanon
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and op
position leader Shimon Peres joined forces yesterday in demand
ing that Syria remove its anti-aircraft missiles from Lebanon.
Peres said he "wouldn't exclude" military action to neutralize
the rockets if the Syrians tail to respond to diplomatic pressure.
Begin described the Syrian deployment of SAM-6 missiles in the
Bekaa Valley of Lebanon as "a very grave development." Hesaid
he hopes the crisis can be resolved peacefully but admitted that
diplomatic efforts have been unsuccessful so far.
Begin briefed Peres on the crisis following a daylong Cabinet
meeting devoted to the Israeli-Syrian confrontation. Public opin
ion polls show that Peres' Labor Party is favored to win the June
30 election over Begin s Likud bloc.
But Peres offered Begin his full support in the government's ef
forts to pressure Syria into removing the 100 or so Soviet-made
SAM-6 missiles that were deployed in Lebanon last weetf after Is
raeli warplanes shot down two Syrian helicopters.
Israel is understood to have demanded that Syria avoid the use
of air power against Christian militias in Lebanon, remove the
SAM-6 missiles and keep its forces north of the Litani River and
thus well away from the Israeli border.

ing a lunch meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis. which had in advance been described in Athens as

yesterday's meeting to carry those negotiations a step further,
with the next round of talks to begin within a few days.
Fischer said the United States is committed to military sales

credits to Greece at a rate oi $280 million a year for the next five
years, subject to congressional approval. He stressed that there
is no agreement to a set tormula to maintain Greek military
strength in balance with Turkey in the Aegean Sea.
Mitsotakis had declared publicly in Athens last week that he
would present Haig with an ultimatum calling for a fixed 7-to- : 0
