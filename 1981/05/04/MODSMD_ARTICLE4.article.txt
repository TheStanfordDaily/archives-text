# Holocaust remembered in service here

### Louise Solomon 
In recognition of International Day
for Commemorating the Holocaust
(April 29-30), University students,
members of the community and facul
ty gathered last week for a memorial
service to honor those who perished in
the Holocaust.
More than 40 people participated in
the interfaith service which included a
candlelit march through the campus,
presentation of the film Night and
Fog, and readings from materials
written by survivors of the Holocaust.
According to Audrey Levine, who co
chaired the program, more than 90
persons saw the film. She said that the

mood was quiet and that the audience,
composed primarily of students,
seemed to have been quite affected by
the film.
Levine and two other students,
Shara Kronmal and Larry Molton,
have been organizing the program
since last fall. According to Levine,
their decision was prompted by
statements made by a group which at
tempted to deny that the Holocaust
ever happened.
She said that the service followed
the general outline of a Jewish eve
ning service, but that the readings
were chosen to express the suffering
experienced not only by Jews, but that

of other groups persecuted in the Holo
caust.
The introduction to the service
read, "Any liturgy of the Holocaust
should avoid total affirmation or reso
lution. This tragedy is too devastating
to be overcome lightly or swiftly. It
poses radical questions to all of hu
manity and to all views. Neither
should the mood be one of total defeat
and despair. That would not do justice
to those who remained faithful and hu
man even in moments of greatest
agony, or to the incredible model of re
newal of life and of faith which sur
vivors exemplified alter the war."
Rabbi Mark Cartun, director of Hillel,
said that the service was designed
with this statement in mind.
Among the readings was an excerpt
from The Men with the Pink Tri
angle. a book which provides a first
hand account of the life and death of
homosexual prisoners in the Nazi con
centration camps
Arthur Slepian, president of the Gay
Peoples Union, read an excerpt from
the book which concluded,
scarcely a word has been written on
the fact that along with the millions
whom Hitler had butchered on grouds
of race,' hundreds of thousands of
people were sadistically tortured to
death simply tor having homosexual
feelings."
Other readings included poetry and
Erose dealing with the meaning of the
iolocaust for Christians, the nature of
man. and individual faith in the ex
istence of God.
One of the participants in the ser
vice read an excerpt from "A Plea for
the Dead", from the book Legends of
Our Time by Elie Weisel: "At the risk
of offending, it must be emphasized

that the victims suffered more, and
more profoundly, from the indif
ference of the on-lookers than from
the brutality ot the executioner. The
cruelty of the enemy would have been
incapable of breaking the prisoner; it
was the silence of those he believed to
be his friends — cruelty more coward
ly, more subtle — which broke his
heart."
"The Holocaust isn't a Jewish prob
lem, it isn't a German problem, it is a
problem of humanity," Cartun said
the next day in an interview. "Re
membering the Holocaust is not just
pointing a finger at the guilty, it is re
membering the beast in us all," he
said.
Cartun also addressed a question
often raised in discussions of the Holo
caust: "Why should people concen
trate on the wrongs of the past when
they could spend the same time con
centrating on what's happening
now?" Cartun said that the two are not
related, and that it is equally impor
tant to remember past murders
Quoting the last lines of the film
Niuhf ami Fog. Cartun said that peo
ple look at the ruins of concentration
camps "as il the rtionster lay dead and
buried beneath the ruins." Cartun said
that he looks at it as a threat ever
present in human nature.
Referring to a recent U.S. law
which declares the week of April 26 to
May 3 "Days of Remembrance for the
Victims of the Holocaust," Cartun
said, "The reason we have the Holo
caust Memorial Law is that Jews are
politically active in America But if
you happen to belong to a less publi
cized minority — such as the black
Christians in Sudan — you can get ex
terminated in days and no one cares."
