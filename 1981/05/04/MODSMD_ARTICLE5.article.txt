# University assails union flyer for 'misleading, false claims'
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
The conflict between the University
and union organizers over who repre
sents the best interests of the clerical
workers continues in this final week of
the unionization drive.
Attacking the Office Staff Organiz
ing Committee (OSOC) newsletter of
April 13, the University published a
broadsheet pointing out some of the
"misleading and totally false claims"
they said were contained in the union's
flyer.
The flyer quotes some of the con
tract clauses at Boston and Brandeis
Universities negotiated by the Service
Employees International Unibn
(SEIU) â€” the parent union of Local
715, the group OSOC would join should
its campaign be successful.
The flyer says that at both univer
sities. under Local 925 of SEIU, "of
fice workers and professional librar
ians have won in their first contract
ALL the pre-existing benefits and
much more."
The University, in its broadsheet,
points out that SEIU does not repre
sent office workers at either Boston or
Brandeis University, that in fact at
Brandeis they "represent pro
fessional librarians and library sup
port staff" and at Boston "only pro
fessional librarians."
In all, the University claims there
are at least 10 inaccuracies in OSOC's
newsletter. F or example, the news
letter says there are "90 days sick

leave per year" at Boston whereas
Stanford says "Actual sick leave ac
crual for office workers at Boston Uni
versity is one day per month. (Up to a
maximum of 90 days may be accrued
over the years.)"
Priscilla Wheeler, labor specialist
in the University Counsel's otfice, said
the University printed the broadsheet
because they were "concerned about
the accuracy of the information put
out by the union in the past couple of
weeks."
"The University's claims are not
true. We never lied or tried to dis
tort." said Joyce Tipps-Coats, spokes
person and chief organizer for OSOC.
Coats said the main purpose of the
flyer was to give "examples of con
tract language." She admitted that of
fice workers were not included in the
Boston and Brandeis contracts, but
said they were mentioned on the tlyer
because office workers might win
similar contract provisions here,
should the union be successful.
Coats said the University's flyer is
"an attempt to divert us from the is
sues," another "smokescreen."
"We should be talking about the is
sues. not this nitpicky stuff," Coats
said was the sentiment among many
office workers,
One issue raised at a recent union
meeting was the effect the union
might have on student employment.
Tipps-Coats said that the union would
not discourage student employment
"as long as a student is a student and
just doing part-time work." Once stu
dents are no longer registered or
working more than part-time "they
should be included in the bargaining
unit," she said.
Tipps-Coats said although students
were exempted in the initial agree
ment between the University and the
union over who could vote in the elec
tion. she said she thought "students
working would want to be included in
order to receive some of the benefits. "
The Local 715 provision now in ef
fect for unionized technical and main
tenance workers allows the Univer
sity to employ students for 20 hours
per week or less without restriction. If
a student or other part-time worker
works for more than 20 hours, after
four months they must join the union
Wheeler said there is a "natural
tension" over this issue because the
union "doesn't want anyone not in the
unit doing bargaining-unit work."
