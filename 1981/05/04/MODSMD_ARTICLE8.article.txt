# Elections scheduled for March
## El Salvador secret talks fail for rebels, government 
### Los Angeles Times 
Mexico City — Efforts involving Mexico, Venezuela
and a West German socialist to promote negotiations
between the government and rebels in El Salvador have
ended without success, sources familiar with the at
tempt said last week.
Over the past few days, military leaders in El
Salvador have rejected the secret peace moves and the
efforts now appear to be dead.
The result will be at least several more months of
fighting in El Salvador and further deterioration of the
country's economy, according to leaders of the Politi
cal Diplomatic Commission, which represents the
Salvadoran political opposition and insurgent move
ment here.
The key statements on the part of the Salvadoran
government were made a tew days ago by Col. .lose
Guillermo Garcia, the minister of defense, and Col. M.
Jaime Abdul Gutierrez, the vice president of the ruling
junta and commander of the armed forces.
Foreign mediation ruled out
Gutierrez ruled out the participation of foreign medi
ators, an important element of a proposal put forward
by the insurgents, and insisted that the only thing to
talk about is the ground rules for the elections sched
uled tor next March.
Similarly, Garcia emphasized that the government
had proposed negotiations late last year — before the
rebels launched an all-out offensive in January — and
had been rejected.
A U.S. diplomat involved with Salvadoran affairs in
sisted that the door is still open "just a crack - ' for talks
concerning how all parties can participate in the
planned elections.
But, he added, "what they are ruling out is any nego
tiation in which you sit down and decide on the actual
sharing of power — who gets this ministry, who gets
that one, that sort of thing."
This attitude, according to a member of the rebel
group, represents, at least for the time being, an end to

the attempt to open negotiations that the insurgents
launched at the end of February alter their "final of
fensive" had failed.
The rebel source, who asked not to be named, gave
the following account:
Secret meeting
On Feb. 28, members of the Political Diplomatic
Commission met secretly and decided to accept an of
fer of mediation by the Socialist International, which
represents the Social Democratic parties of Europe
and Latin America.
The commission is composed of seven members
drawn both from the opposition political parties of El
Salvador and from the various guerrilla factions.
It is headed by Guillermo Ungo, the head of El
Salvador's small Social Democratic Party, but much of
the power lies in the hands of more hard-line elements
within the organization.
As part of this effort, Hans-Jurgen Wischnewski,
deputy chairman of the Social Democratic party of
West Germany, met in El Salvador with Garcia, junta
President Jose Napoleon Duarte, and Foreign Minister
Fidel Chavez Mena.
Tactical maneuver
Garcia, according to the rebel source, said the gov
ernment believed that the initiative was simply a tac
tical maneuver designed to affect public opinion.
At that point, the rebels said they offered a series of
specific suggestions about the talks, including a pro
posal for a "mediation panel" to be composed of four
prominent people: a Christian Democrat and a Social
Democrat, both probably European, a Latin American
and a North American.
Among the names mentioned as the North American
representative was U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.).
In a telephone interview from Washington, a mem
ber of Hatfield's staff. Rick Rolf, confirmed that Hat
field had been contacted.
"He said he would be willing to help in anyway he
could," Rolf stated, "but he in no way endorsed any

specific effort. . . nor did he say it was a bad idea."
Access to public communication
According to the Salvadoran rebel source,the only
precondition for the talks was that the insurgents be
guaranteed access to the means of public communica
tion in El Salvador. "We wanted space in the news
papers and time on the radio and television," he said.
Wischnewski relayed the concrete proposals to Chavez
Mena,
"All of these are under absolute government control
and if we don't have some access to the public media,
they would continue to put out only one version of
what's taking place — the government version.
"They would say that the only reason we want to talk
is because we've been beaten militarily, and that is de
monstrably untrue," he continued. "That is the only
thing we asked for."
Chavez Mena was asked to reply to Wischnewski by
April 30, according to the insurgent account, but he did
not do so. Instead, the talks were rejected publicly by
Garcia, Gutierrez and Duarte.
Foreign participation denounced
Gutierrez denounced the proposed foreign partici
pation as "a maneuver of international communism
which seeks to deceive worldwide public opinion."
The most conciliatory statement was made by
Duarte, who nevertheless ruled out talks because of re
bel preconditions.
According to Mexican and Salvadoran sources, Vene
zuelan President Luis Herrera Campins, who is also a
Christian Democrat, was personally involved in the un
successful effort to persuade Duarte to accept nego
tiations.
Last week, Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge
Castaneda met secretly in the Mexican Caribbean re
sort of Cancun with Chavez Mena, to discuss the peace
moves.
According to several sources, however, the meeting
did not produce a step forward in the negotiation proc
ess, which Mexican sources consider to be stalled.

had proposed negotiations late last year — before the
rebels launched an all-out offensive in January — and
had been rejected.
A U.S. diplomat involved with Salvadoran affairs in
sisted that the door is still open "just a crack - ' for talks
concerning how all parties can participate in the
planned elections.
But, he added, "what they are ruling out is any nego
tiation in which you sit down and decide on the actual
sharing of power — who gets this ministry, who gets
that one, that sort of thing."
This attitude, according to a member of the rebel
group, represents, at least for the time being, an end to

the attempt to open negotiations that the insurgents
launched at the end of February alter their "final of
fensive" had failed.
The rebel source, who asked not to be named, gave
the following account:
Secret meeting
On Feb. 28, members of the Political Diplomatic
Commission met secretly and decided to accept an of
fer of mediation by the Socialist International, which
represents the Social Democratic parties of Europe
and Latin America.
The commission is composed of seven members
drawn both from the opposition political parties of El
Salvador and from the various guerrilla factions.
It is headed by Guillermo Ungo, the head of El
Salvador's small Social Democratic Party, but much of
the power lies in the hands of more hard-line elements
within the organization.
As part of this effort, Hans-Jurgen Wischnewski,
deputy chairman of the Social Democratic party of
West Germany, met in El Salvador with Garcia, junta
President Jose Napoleon Duarte, and Foreign Minister
Fidel Chavez Mena.
Tactical maneuver
Garcia, according to the rebel source, said the gov
ernment believed that the initiative was simply a tac
tical maneuver designed to affect public opinion.
At that point, the rebels said they offered a series of
specific suggestions about the talks, including a pro
posal for a "mediation panel" to be composed of four
prominent people: a Christian Democrat and a Social
Democrat, both probably European, a Latin American
and a North American.
Among the names mentioned as the North American
representative was U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.).
In a telephone interview from Washington, a mem
ber of Hatfield's staff. Rick Rolf, confirmed that Hat
field had been contacted.
"He said he would be willing to help in anyway he
could," Rolf stated, "but he in no way endorsed any

specific effort. . . nor did he say it was a bad idea."
Access to public communication
According to the Salvadoran rebel source,the only
precondition for the talks was that the insurgents be
guaranteed access to the means of public communica
tion in El Salvador. "We wanted space in the news
papers and time on the radio and television," he said.
Wischnewski relayed the concrete proposals to Chavez
Mena,
"All of these are under absolute government control
and if we don't have some access to the public media,
they would continue to put out only one version of
what's taking place — the government version.
"They would say that the only reason we want to talk
is because we've been beaten militarily, and that is de
monstrably untrue," he continued. "That is the only
thing we asked for."
Chavez Mena was asked to reply to Wischnewski by
April 30, according to the insurgent account, but he did
not do so. Instead, the talks were rejected publicly by
Garcia, Gutierrez and Duarte.
Foreign participation denounced
Gutierrez denounced the proposed foreign partici
pation as "a maneuver of international communism
which seeks to deceive worldwide public opinion."
The most conciliatory statement was made by
Duarte, who nevertheless ruled out talks because of re
bel preconditions.
According to Mexican and Salvadoran sources, Vene
zuelan President Luis Herrera Campins, who is also a
Christian Democrat, was personally involved in the un
successful effort to persuade Duarte to accept nego
tiations.
Last week, Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge
Castaneda met secretly in the Mexican Caribbean re
sort of Cancun with Chavez Mena, to discuss the peace
moves.
According to several sources, however, the meeting
did not produce a step forward in the negotiation proc
ess, which Mexican sources consider to be stalled.
Mexico City — Efforts involving Mexico, Venezuela
and a West German socialist to promote negotiations
between the government and rebels in El Salvador have
ended without success, sources familiar with the at
tempt said last week.
Over the past few days, military leaders in El
Salvador have rejected the secret peace moves and the
efforts now appear to be dead.
The result will be at least several more months of
fighting in El Salvador and further deterioration of the
country's economy, according to leaders of the Politi
cal Diplomatic Commission, which represents the
Salvadoran political opposition and insurgent move
ment here.
The key statements on the part of the Salvadoran
government were made a tew days ago by Col. .lose
Guillermo Garcia, the minister of defense, and Col. M.
Jaime Abdul Gutierrez, the vice president of the ruling
junta and commander of the armed forces.
Foreign mediation ruled out
Gutierrez ruled out the participation of foreign medi
ators, an important element of a proposal put forward
by the insurgents, and insisted that the only thing to
talk about is the ground rules for the elections sched
uled tor next March.

had proposed negotiations late last year — before the
