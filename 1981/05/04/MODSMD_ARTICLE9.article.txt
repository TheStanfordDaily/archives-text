# Europe watches Haig for signal on nuclear plans
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — West
German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in a
stepped-up effort to persuade
the United States to resume
arms talks with the Soviet
Union on European-based nucle
ar missiles, last week was said
to be ready to press U.S. Secre
tary of State Alexander H a ig for
a timetable on when such talks
might begin.
According to a Bonn Foreign
Ministry source, the West Ger
man minister wants to be given
"a clear signal for a time
frame" tor the negotiations at a
meeting of foreign ministers of
Atlantic Alliance countries be
ginning today in Rome. Haig is
attending the meeting.
The West German statement
is significant, for while a
number of West European of
ficials have already made
known their interest in seeing
arms control talks resumed,
they have refrained from pub
licly pressing the Reagan ad
ministration on dates, voicing
understanding for the new gov
ernment's need first to review

U.S. policy.
Bonn's decision to seek a
more specific commitment
from Washington is a sign of the
growing concern here over
deepening pacifist sentiment in
West Germany and several oth
er West European countries, re
sulting in broadened opposition
to plans by the Western Alliance
to station U.S.-made medium
range nuclear missiles in Eu
rope beginning late in T 983.
Troubled by the nuances
which have emerged between
members of the new U.S. ad
ministration over how soon
arms limitations talks might ac
tually begin and under what, if
any, international conditions,
Genscher reportedly sees the
Rome meeting as a main op
portunity to squelch doubt and
encourage consistency in U.S.
policy in this area.
Up to now, the Reagan admin
istration has committed itself
simply to resuming negotiations
at some time. Haig has prom
ised an "early" resumption,
while U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, who was in
Bonn several weeks ago for a
meeting with other Allied de
tense ministers, sought to link
the prospects of talks with the
continued threat of Soviet in
tervention in Poland.
The Bonn foreign ministry
source, who asked not to be

named, said Thursday it is the
West German government's
position that no "unrealistic
linkages" be attached to the re
sumption of talks and that nego
tiations be conducted on the
basis of mutual U.S.-Soviet con
fidence.
U.S. officials have indicated
the Reagan administration may
be prepared to begin a series of
meetings with Soviet officials
preliminary to resuming full
scale arms limitation talks.
This could include a meeting be
tween Haig and Soviet Foreign
Minister Andre Gromyko in the
autumn.
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
European-based nuclear weap
ons began formally last autumn
in Geneva, at which time the
Americans and Soviets outlined
initial positions to each other.
Talks adjourned after one
month.
Overall SALT framework
On other East-West matters
expected to be taken up at the
two-day NATO conference, the
Bonn source said Genscher fa
vors a cautious Alliance position
toward developments in Poland,
preferring no change in the
Western stance of recent
months which has gone so far as
to warn the Soviet Union that an
intervention in Poland would
mean the end of detente.
