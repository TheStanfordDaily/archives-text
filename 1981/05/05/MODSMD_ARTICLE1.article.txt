# IRA martyr dies in hunger strike

### Los Angeles Times 
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Irish
Republican Army prisoner Bobby
Sands died early this morning at the
Maze Prison here in the 66th day of his
hunger strike protesting the status of
prisoners in Northern Ireland.
Sands, 27. had fallen into a coma
Sunday morning and remained un
conscious until he expired at 1:17 a.m.
local time this morning. He died in the
prison hospital, with his parents, other
members of his family, and a priest
and doctors in attendance.
In this morning's early hours, Bel
fast and the other cities in Northern
Ireland braced for what might come
once the news of Sands' death spread.
Security forces, with 11,000 British
troops and thousands of local police,
were on all-night duty.
Observers feared his death might
set up widespread violence in Ulster,
although in recent days, both the Cath
olic militants of the IRA and the Prot
estant loyalists had called on mem
bers of their own communities to be
calm. They urged an avoidance of re
newed violence that led to bloodshed
in some of the most bitter sectarian vi
olence of the last 12 years.
Some young men put on face masks
and hurled missiles at the police, early
this morning, but there was no sizable
outpouring before dawn.
The IRA's current position is that

the protest should remain peaceful in
order to continue to focus world press
attention on the death of Sands and the
possible death of Francis Hughes, an
other hunger striker, within a week or
so.
"The position of the republican
movement is to bury Bobby Sand£
with dignity," a senior IRA official,
Joe Austin, said.
"We hope that there will be only
peaceful demonstrations and we are
calling on everyone to fly black flags
as a sign of mourning tor Bobby
Sands," Austin went on. "The British
government ultimately will have to
meet the demands of the other hunger
strikers."
At the Republican headquarters on
Lower Falls Road early today, of
ficials told The Los Angeles Times
that Sands' funeral would probably
take place Thursday.
The great fear all along has been
that the young people armed with
their soda bottles full of gasoline and
their heavy paving stones would not
listen to the advice of the leaders.
Sands' hunger strike had become a
focus of worldwide attention, mainly
from those elements of the press, pub
lic, and special interests who view the
Irish Republican cause as justified,
and see continuing British rule in Ul
ster as unjustified.
