# New M.A. program joins computers and education
## School of Ed. trains grads in 'software'

Next fall there will be a new
Master of Arts degree at the
School of Education. The new
program in interactive educa
tional technology will combine
courses in the fields of educa
tional psychology, computer
science and curriculum theory
and design. Students will be
taught to develop com
prehensive computer software

to be used in in education, in
dustry and in the home.
The program was developed
because despite the recent revo
lution in the computer industry
in the production of hardware
(the actual machines), there is
a tremendous demand for
creative, clearly understood
computer programs, or "soft
ware." The software is in de
mand as today's computer
learning systems are being in
troduced into increasing num
bers of school districts around
the country. It is essential that
software designers be able to
adapt their programming skills
to educational situations. Stu
dents in the Stanford program
will, for instance, discover how
children learn a particular sub
ject irom graphic representa
tions as opposed to verbal and
numerical representations.
They will then be trained to de
sign software which will suc
cessfully coordinate all of these
techniques into a concise, in
formative, computer lesson.
Many jobs will be available to
graduates with a degree in this
new major. Prof. Robert Hess
of the School of Education be
lieves that in the near future,
"the demand tor programmers
of this kind will be very, very
strong." According to Com
puter World magazine, compe
tent graduates can earn as much
as $24,000 to $25,000 the first
year after completing their
degree.
But software design positions
in industrial and commercial
firms will not be the only type of

employment opportunity avail
able to these majors. Graduates
will be able to advise and make
policy recommendations for
businesses incorporating com
puter systems into their offices.
They can also direct training,
programs for teachers who will;
be using computer-assisted in
struction in their classrooms.
The program itself is a one-,
year co-terminal degree. This
means students can elect to take
their B. A. and M.A. at the same
time, by entering in their senior
year. Prerequisites include
some background in psychology
and at least one course in com
puter programming. During the
year, students will take general
courses in educational psy
chology, computer science and
curriculum, but will also meet
regularly in a special seminar to
integrate the concepts learned
in the various disciplines. In ad
dition, all students are required
to design their own workable
software project.
Hess is optimistic about the
new degree, and says, "interest
from the community has been
kind." The school has received
several letters of inquiry from
people in local industries desir
ing to participate in the pro
gram on a part-time basis.
Some firms have expressed in
terest in hiring future gradu
ates. Although enrollment is
small at present (about 15), and
may continue to be limited, the
future of Stanford's new in
teractive educational technolo
gy looks promising.
