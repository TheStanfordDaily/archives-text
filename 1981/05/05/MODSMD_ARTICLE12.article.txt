# Unionization of University clericals: the pros and cons
## Support OSOC victory May 7 
### 
Poor criteria
Throughout our two years of or
ganizing the office and library support
staff at the University, we. the mem
bers ot OSOC, have been scrupulous
about not making any promises ot
what the union will give us in benefits
and salaries, but only stating what oth
er workers have in their contracts and
to suggesting ideas for our own con
tract; behaving in a dignified manner,
and this includes avoidance of "mud
slinging"; and being careful not to
mislead people. The University's
campaign literature evidently was
prepared in accordance with a dif
ferent set ot criteria.
Our literature has attempted to sup
ply information about unions. In
speaking and writing ot issues, we
have asked the question: what do we
>have now, and what is it possible to
have instead (based on what others
have done elsewhere)? This is also
what we tried to do in our April 13
' OSOC newsletter. Every item of con
tract language referred to was taken
from SEIU union contracts at Boston
and Brandeis universities. These con
tracts cover library workers — nonex
empt support staff and professional li
brarians. We chose Boston and Bran
deis because, like Stanford, these are
private universities, and we thought
our readers would be interested in
•being introduced to contract pro
visions from such sources.
What we did in this newsletter is
sue, as we stated, was present pro
visions from two contracts to give ex
amples ot what other workers have ne
gotiated successfully for. Every item
exists in one or the other contract and
we have copies of the relevant pages of
these contracts to prove it. To see
copies of these documents, ask your
or call the USE otfice
.<497-1465). The only thing wrong with
the newsletter article is the use ot the
general term "office workers" when
referring to the nonexempt library
, support staff. This is like saying "the
clericals" to describe our own
.bargaining unit of many "clerical"
classifications, including library spe
cialists and data aides, who may not
, think of themselves as "clericals" at
all. If you substitute the words "li
brary support staff" tor "otfice work
ers," the article is clearer as to what
,it says. Now, briefly, here is where to
find the contract language for some of
the provisions which the University
flyer says do not exist or differ from
what we stated.
Temperature and health; Boston
University, Local 925. SEIU, contract
dated 1979-80, page 14, Article XVIII.
Communication: Brandeis, Local
■925, SEIU, contract dated 1980-82,
page 28, Article XXIX, Sections 1 and
3.
Vacation: Brandeis contract, p. 15,
Article XIV.
Sick leave: Boston contract, p. 19,
Article XXIII. (It is an incredible
amount of sick leave and that is why
we checked it carefully before print
ing this information.)
Also, please note those provisions
not challenged by the University in its
flyer (i.e., not circled tor our atten
tion). For example:
- Flexible ' hours: "Office workers
can determine their own starting and
quitting times as long as they are at
work during certain 'core' hours."
I am quite certain that people who
take the trouble to actually read
through some union contracts (some
>are short and easy to read) would find
that many of the "bugaboos" we were
{•told to expect from unions are not sub
stantiated, but phantoms.

iNeed representative
May 7 will be a historic day tor of
fice staff at Stanford University. You
will vote on a question of major signif
icance — whether you wish to have a
collective bargaining representative
't or wish to remain unrepresented.
We have been asked by Local 715
. SEIU to provide a perspective, as
elected ofticials and spokespersons
from management, on the quality of
representation provided by Local 715.
As you are probably aware, the job
of running government has become
more complex over the years. With
tax revenues declining, but the de
mand tor services increasing, de
cision-making becomes more difficult
each day. In this context, it has been
especially helptul for us to have a
Union like Local 715 as the represent
ative for 5900 out of the 9800 employees
' working for Santa Clara County Gov
ernment.
Local 715 has exhibited an open and
constructive approach to the never
ending problems of managing local
u government. Our perception of 715 has
-•been that the Union consistently acts
pin a democratic fashion: it is an ag
gressive, responsible, and articulate
representative of its members.
We are pro-labor and strongly feel
that all workers need to have a repre
sentative to speak for their needs as
employees. In that regard, we recog
nize that management also needs to be
open and responsive to worker's con
cerns. Most important, we understand
that employees can only truly earn the
respect and dignity they deserve with
the support of an effective represent
ative of their choice.
Our experience leads us to believe

that such an effective representative
is uniquely available in Local 715. A
wise choice on May 7 would be a vote
tor a verv special Union, U S E., Local
715, SEIU.

Union power
As an individual, who has witnessed
the power of the A.M.A. and recog
nizes that there is indeed strength in
numbers; as a Democrat, who prefers
collective bargaining to corporate
decree; and as a worker, who knows
that organized labor is rewarded an
average of 30 percent more in wages
and benefits than unorganized labor, I
endorse a yes vote for Local 715 this
May 7.

Divide, conquer
The University tactics divide
clericals from U.S.E.
Obviously because U.S.E. will be
much stronger with combined TMS
and clerical units. The University
would prefer, if it must deal with a
union, to have it as weak as possible.
The question is not whether the Uni
versity or OSOC may have slanted fig
ures or given misinformation — unin
tentionally, of course. The question is
not whether U.S.E. or the University
has faults. We know they both do. Cer
tainly there would be no thought ot a
union if the clericals felt the Univer
sity dealt adequately with its employ
ees.
The issue — and let no one be side
tracked by nitpicking — is whether the
clericals will be better oft with or
without a union. This is what they
must decide. They might keep in mind
that every Stanford employee — ex
empt and non-exempt has benefitted
from U.S.E. either in a higher salary,
increased medical benetits and/or ad
ditional holidays.
In union there is strength.

USE helped
I need to respond to President
Donald Kennedy's letter about
USE/Local 715. USE is here to help us
when we need help with our work prob
lems When I was tired unjustly,
USE/Local 715 got my job back «md all
the back pay I lost. That was over
$7500.
USE was not ineffective or coun
terproductive. USE helped me and has
helped a lot ot other workers. I am
glad USE is here, and the clerical
workers will be glad to have USE rep
resent them. too.

Worker's union
I have been a University Food Ser
vice worker since 1958. For several
years, I experienced what it is like to
work without a labor union and a con
tract.
Since USE organized at Stanford,
under our contract, employees have
not only succeeded in improving work
ing conditions, but also at times have
enforced recognition and respect to
our tjuman dignity. Therefore, I dis
agree with President Donald Ken
nedy's statement that our u/iion has
been counterproductive and hostile.
Perhaps what he is trying to tell the
people is that only a "company-run"
type of union, rather than a worker's
own union, is acceptable by the Stan
ford University administrators.
I most sincerely hope that clerical
workers consider the need of true rep
resentation in their labor disputes and
that on May 7 they choose USE Local
715 as their bargaining agent.

Collective action
I have been following the debate be
tween the University administration
and OSOC with considerable interest,
particularly because President
Donald Kennedy, a liberal Democrat
on most issues, has had to present
himself as not anti-union, but only
anti- this particular union (Local 715
of the SEIU).
I have to suppose, therefore, that
Kennedy supports farm workers in
their efforts to unionize, as well as ef
forts to unionize southern textile mills
(like J.P. Stevens), and so forth. But
not at Stanford; not in the one place
where he, as a progressive adminis
trator, could take a direct hand in pro
moting workers' organizing for gener
ally higher salaries and better work
ing conditions.
The administration rationalizes this
anti-union position on the grounds that
the Stanford office staff could do and
have done better without a union. In
deed, the administration argues, Lo
cal 715 is even harmful (coun
terproductive) to its present member
ship. As "proof of these charges, of
fice staff have been bombarded by a
series of booklets which purport to
show that collective bargaining at
Stanford would actually leave office
staff financially worse off in the next
few years than if they reject union rep
resentation.

The figures and text ot the various
booklets actually contend that SEIU
representation would save the Univer
sity money at a time when tunds are
scarce — in fact, the contention is that
the present agreement with the al
ready unionized technicians, main
tenance and service workers did save
the University money because it was
such a poor contract. If that is so. why
is the University so opposed to
unionization?
1 am not going to argue that the Uni
versity's figures are misleading
(which they are, to some extent). For
the administration, wages in any giv
en year are not really the issue. The
main issue is control. With
unionization, control over the work
process and wage setting passes in
part to the collective body of office
staff. Bargaining is no longer on an in
dividual basis. Each office worker —
in individual grievances, in work con
ditions, in relations with superiors,
and in wage setting — has the weight
of all the oftice workers behind him or
her.
The issue is not money, but power
and control, and in those terms, the
University's position is very logical
and clear , it prefers to do its own
wage-setting, its own grievance pro
cedures, its own work conditions. It
makes perfect sense for Kennedy to be
pro-union elsewhere, but not where it
impinges on his own organizational
perogatives and flexibility. It makes
just as much sense for each and every
office staff member to vote for his or
her own increase in possibilities
through collective union action.

Management wrong
I am responding to Donald Ken
nedy's attitude toward USE/Local 715
(the TMS bargaining unit). I want to
say that I am glad the Union is around.
When I needed help, the union has been
there to help me. When I was fired for
being sick, it was the union that helped
me get my job back. The union is not
counterproductive. The union helps to
balance the difference in power be
tween the workers and University
management.
Lee Thompson
Food Service
I am responding to President
Donald Kennedy's letter (Campus Re
port, April 22). Kennedy said that
USE/Local 715 is and has been coun
terproductive. That has certainly not
been my experience with USE/Local
715.
It was University management who
refused to classify me properly. When
I filed a grievance through the union, I
was represented on that grievance all
the way to arbitration by USE/Local
715. The arbitrator awarded me over
$6000 in back pay because University
management was wrong.
