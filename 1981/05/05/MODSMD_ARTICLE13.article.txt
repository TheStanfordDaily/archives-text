# Oppose USE/Local 715 win

Bulletin misleading
I take umbrage with the April 27 bul
letin in which the Office Staff Organiz
ing Committee states that in 1969, the
University reduced tuition benefits
trom tull to half payment; and that in
1977, the University took away one
week of vacation trom the otfice statf.
With regard to the alleged reduced
tuition, until 1969 Stanford qualified
employees were offered tull tuition at
Stanford tor their dependents, but that
otfer was good only for those students
eligible for entrance into and who
wished to matriculate at Stanford Uni
versity.
When the benefits were changed in
1969, they were expanded rather than
reduced. The administration offered
its qualified employees financial as
sistance with payment of tuition and
recurring tees charged by accredited
colleges and universities up to an
amount equalling one-half of the cur
rent Stanford tuition. Clearly, that of
fered more individuals an opportunity
to enter colleges of their choice, so it
was of greater benefit to more people
since subsequently employees have
been able to provide their children
with a multitudinous choice of schools
which charged less than Stanford's
full tuition and thus their expenses in
this area have been adequately cov
ered.
With regard to the deprivation of
vacation claim, this, too, is an in
complete and inaccurate statement.
The entire vacation structure was
changed to provide more vacation to
all employees over a shorter period of
time. When I questioned some of my
fellqw employees who worked at the
University at that time, they advised
me that they had no knowledge of hav
ing had any vacation taken away,
rather that they had been given more
time in the long run.
When the University moved to
change these two items, there was
also a grandfather clause to protect
the status quo of the current employ
ees, and any new employees who ar
rived on the scene after the change
were given ample information as to
the benetits which they could expect to
receive.
In all fairness, we are entitled to
complete and accurate statements.
This is no time for semantics-dabbl
ing. With distortions of the truth set
before us, it is high time to take a real
ly good look at what the union is going
to offer us. Who stands to benefit trom
their half truths? Who stands to bene
fit from such apparent hostility as the
current situation indicates? Can we
move forward to progressive and ben
eficial talks under such a hateful at
mosphere?
I would like to see a well-organized
association of employees join together
for mutual professional benefit and in
terest on this campus, but I have seri
ous doubts that Local 715 will serve
that purpose with its obvious animosi
ty toward the administration. I sug

gest we take a good long look at the
state of such unions and search
elsewhere while we still have that
freedom ot choice.

Proposals illusive
I am going to vote no at the USE
election tomorrow, and I urge others
to also do so, for the following rea
sons:
I do not want to lose my freedom of
choice â€” to have to obey union rules
and regulations that are not in my best
interests.
I enjoy working at Stanford for every
day is a challenge, with such diversity
and intelligence needed to cover all
facets of my position (also the case
with many secretaries), that union ef
forts to put all clerical workers into an
assembly-line of service workers is
contemptible.
There have been no concrete USE
proposals to better our wages, bene
tits, or working conditions, and a mere
.5 percent of proposed union dues will
actually assist any of us with legal
fees, arbitration expenses, or a strike
fund.
The USE union proposals are an il
lusion of all ot us having a voice in
what we want in the way of salaries,
benefits, promotions and working con
ditions. In reality it is a snare and de
lusion because we, the workers, will
lose our freedom to USE-SEIU of
ficials who may order us to obey union
rules, go out on strike, fine us for in
fractions of union rules, and even
threaten us with a loss of our jobs. It is
not "our" union. It will be controlled
by union ofticials who will tell us who
we can vote for, what we can do. We
are intelligent and wise to vote no on
May 7.

Facts vs. promises
We are a group of clerical workers
at the University. We are single, mar
ried, divorced, some with children,
some without. We are all ages and
races. Some of us have signed blue
union cards, some have not. We are
united in one common bond to urge
each and every clerical and library
support staff person who is eligible to
vote May 7 to do so.
Because we have the same issues at
stake, as you our co-workers in the
University, we feel compelled to state
some facts many of you may be un
aware of.
It is a fact that the University an
nually adjusts the pay range and pay
scale according to their budget and
analysis ot the previous year. The re
view which resulted in the current
salary range plan that would go into
effect on Sept. 1, has been in planning
since 1978. The announced salary in-

creases are guaranteed increases that
trill be etfectiveon Sept. 1, if Local 715
is not elected to represent us.
It is a fact that if Local 715 repre
sents us, and it you are a member of
the union when a strike is voted in, you
will have to strike or be subjected to
disciplinary actions by the union.
It is a fact that our salaries are com
parable with many other organiza
tions. It is a fact that Stanford offers a
comparable benefits package. It is a
fact that we do have a grievance pro
cedure and a choice whether or not to
begin a grievance and if we do, to stop
at any time we wish.
It is a fact that there are many ex
isting problems at Stanford Univer
sity. Over the past months,
USE/Local 715 has been telling us all
they can do for us as our represent
atives. The fact is that these are only
promises; the union can guarantee
nothing.
The University is a non-profit in
stitution; it does not have unlimited
resources. The question we pose is: in
order to address any of these issues,
where do the trade-offs begin? Can
USE/Local 715 honestly tell us there
are the funds available to deal effec
tively with these costly issues?
It is a fact that in order to imple
ment higher wages, better benefits,
longer leaves of absences, etc., the
money has to come from somewhere.
Where?
A few of us attended a meeting with
three members of USE/Local 715
SEIU and were told that it Stanford
employees were dissatisfied, it would
not be difficult to remove the union.
The facts are as follows: In order to
remove the union, they must be voted
out. In order to have an election, 30
percent of the members of the union
would have to file a petition with the
NLRB (National Labor Relations
Board). No petition may even be con
sidered except between the 60 and 90
days prior to the expiration of this
agreement. It is a fact that any union
member who joins in this process can
be fined and disciplined for doing so.
A question we would like you to ask
yourself is: If you are a dissatisfied
union member and want out, are you
willing to risk signing a petition and
subjecting yourself to these fines and
disciplinary actions?
We the undersigned, have decided to
vote NO to USE/Local 715 on May 7.
