## Effects, complexities of union election 
### 
I am a little dismayed at the nature
of the debate concerning the upcoming
union certification election. It could
be carried out at a more serious level,
where a thorough and many-sided ex
amination of the issues was the prima
ry focus of discussion. Unfortunately
the usual problems have prominently
tilled the debate: figures and charts
are used carelessly and in misleading
ways, propaganda is generated solely
to win the election rather than to in
form the eligible voters, stereotyped
images of the opposition are bandied
about without regard tor their inac
curacy. Both the University and the
OSOC could do better.
But the real issue of the union elec
tion is: will certifying U.S.E. of Local
715, SEIU, as the bargaining agent for
Stanford's clerical and library statf
be, on balance, positive or negative for
the workers involved?
I stress that unionization is likely to
affect many aspects of their jobs both
for better and for worse. In no way is it
reasonable to expect that the union
would bring only a multitude of bene
fits to workers; nor is it likely that all
of the changes brought about by the
union would be negative. Rather,
unionization wil entail an enormous
number of changes, some of tjiem de
veloping only over a long period. Some
of them will be clearly all to the good,
other clearly not so, ahd many of them
are practically impossible to foresee.
In assessing the impact of
unionization, it is of greatest im
portance to attempt to sift out the like
ly results that will come from the
hopes and ideals we may have for the
union. Yes, it would be great if the
union turned out to be a highly demo
cratic, responsive, member-con
trolled organization whose sole
purpose was improving the lot of
clerical staff at Stanford; but no, it
will not be a perfect structure that
meets all of the high expectations peo
ple have for it.
The same judgment can be made of
the University, of course — we have an
idealistic picture of what the Univer
sity should be, and in many respects it
does not live up to that image. In con
sidering the union, then, it is far better
to disillusion ourselves about what the

union can be and do before it is ac
cepted than to be disillusioned after
wards as the realities of this very im
perfect human organization dealing
with a very imperfect employer be
come clear.
I would like, then, to discuss what I
see as three of the most important
dilemmas raised in the election cam
paign. Certification of the union would
involve trade-offs in each of these
problem areas;
Flexibility of policies and practices
vs. favoritism and resulting injustices
to particular workers. Believe it or
not, Stanford is relatively flexible in
its administrative policies. The bu
reaucratic mentality is not terribly
highly developed here (although I am
told it is very highly developed in cer
tain offices) and the organization in
general has a fairly relaxed teeling to
it.
This means that supervisors have a
measdre of discretion to set otfice
practices, recommend salary in
creases, be friendly or hostile, and so
on. It also means that they can be un
fair for reasons totally unrelated to a
person's performance or competence.
This situation is likely to change if the
union is accepted. Supervisor discre
tion will be reduced , office practices,
salary increases, and job classi
fications are likely to be written into
the union contract, and some of the un
justifiable inequities suffered by em
ployees are likely to be eliminated.
But bureaucratic rigidity is likely to
increase at the same time. Individuals
ot exceptional competence are likely
to be even less able to gain additional
salary increases because seniority
will become more important as the
basis for salary changes. Disputes
over job descriptions are likely to be
come more prevalent, as are more
careful efforts on the part of both the
union and the University to see to it
that rules and regulations written into
the contract are followed to the letter.
If you are unaware of the costs —
both psychological and material — in
volved in a highly bureaucratic uni
versity, visit your counterparts at a
place like San Jose State University.
Less flexible policies and less super

visorial discretion may end some in
justices; the resulting bureau
cratization can be very unpleasant.
Paternalism vs. more adversarial
relationship between supervisors and
employees. While I have not person
ally witnessed much paternalism in
supervisors' attitudes toward employ
ees, it is clear that many clerical
workers feel that the University takes
such an attitude toward them and they
quite rightly resent it.
In the present relationship all power
lies on the University's side and prac
tically no power lies with the employ
ees. The best to be hoped for in this sit
uation is a benign and enlightened des
pot, and in many respects the Univer
sity sees itself as just that.
Unionization is likely to greatly
diminish the paternalism of the Uni
versity, for the University will no
longer be in the position of deciding
more or iess unilaterally what its poli
cies will be.
But as we have already seen to some
extent in the two years during which
the OSOC has worked to have the elec
tion held, unionization tends to make
the employer/employee relationship
much more adversarial than it other
wise would be. Having a union tends to
drive supervisors more toward identi
fying with "management" and to in
crease the distance between super
visors and staff.
Also, more frequent disputes over
rules and regulations tend to increase
the general level of opposition be
tween supervisors and workers. In the
best case this opposition and distance
may be beneficial in heightening su
pervisors' awareness of employee
problems and their commitment to
solving them; in the worst case it qan
mean a poisoned atmosphere for ev
eryone concerned.
Collective power and protection for
workers vs. union concern for its own
success. It seems indisputable that
that major benefit to be gained from
unionization is the collective power
that employees gain to press for im
provements in their working situ
ation. Even if the union is not particu
larly successful in making immediate
improvements, many union members
may feel a heightened sense of self-re

spect and self-worth because they are
part of the effort to make those im
provements.
Unions are subject to the same ten
dency as all other organizations: they
are likely to become ends in them
selves, to some extent, pursuing goals
that are ot benefit to the union but not
necessarily of benefit to the employ
ees it represents.
Here lies the basis for most of the
University's expressed opposition to
U.S.E./Local 715: the University feels
that U.S.E. has been more concerned
about struggling against the Univer
sity than it has about helping to solve
the problems encountered by the or
ganized employees.
And it is here that the greatest prob
lem facing the clerical staff lies if the
union should be certified: making sure
that the union structure remains re
sponsive to individual workers and
their problems rather than dealing
solely with large categories of work
ers and ignoring the special circum
stances and capacities that make one
person different from another.
The dilemmas discussed here are by
no means the only ones that need to be
examined and debated before the elec
tion — in particular, I have omitted
any consideration of the possible ef
fects of unionization on salary levels.
What I hope to have contributed is a
suggestion of the complexities ot the
issues involved, and I hope that the
discussions that take place in these
last days of the campaign will try to
deal with the complexities as fully as
possible. I want also to emphasize to
the clerical and library workers that
the real work of gaining the benefits of
unionizaton has not yet even begun.
That will come if the union is certified,
and, as the plan now stands, the
clerical workers become part of
U.S.E. in Local 715. You will have to
work even more diligently and
energetically to build a truly demo
cratic, responsive, and progressive
union organization than you have so
far in trying to win collective bargain
ing. My hopes are with you if that
process is set in motion on May 7.

examined and debated before the elec

any consideration of the possible ef

What I hope to have contributed is a
suggestion of the complexities ot the
issues involved, and I hope that the
discussions that take place in these
last days of the campaign will try to
deal with the complexities as fully as
possible. I want also to emphasize to
the clerical and library workers that
the real work of gaining the benefits of
unionizaton has not yet even begun.
That will come if the union is certified,
and, as the plan now stands, the
clerical workers become part of
U.S.E. in Local 715. You will have to
work even more diligently and
energetically to build a truly demo
cratic, responsive, and progressive
union organization than you have so

process is set in motion on May 7.

I am a little dismayed at the nature
of the debate concerning the upcoming
union certification election. It could
be carried out at a more serious level,
where a thorough and many-sided ex
amination of the issues was the prima
ry focus of discussion. Unfortunately
the usual problems have prominently
tilled the debate: figures and charts
are used carelessly and in misleading
ways, propaganda is generated solely
to win the election rather than to in
form the eligible voters, stereotyped
images of the opposition are bandied
about without regard tor their inac
curacy. Both the University and the
OSOC could do better.
But the real issue of the union elec
tion is: will certifying U.S.E. of Local
715, SEIU, as the bargaining agent for
Stanford's clerical and library statf
be, on balance, positive or negative for
the workers involved?
I stress that unionization is likely to
affect many aspects of their jobs both
for better and for worse. In no way is it
reasonable to expect that the union
would bring only a multitude of bene
fits to workers; nor is it likely that all
of the changes brought about by the
union would be negative. Rather,
unionization wil entail an enormous
number of changes, some of tjiem de
veloping only over a long period. Some
of them will be clearly all to the good,
other clearly not so, ahd many of them
are practically impossible to foresee.
In assessing the impact of
unionization, it is of greatest im
portance to attempt to sift out the like
ly results that will come from the
hopes and ideals we may have for the
union. Yes, it would be great if the
union turned out to be a highly demo
cratic, responsive, member-con
trolled organization whose sole
purpose was improving the lot of
clerical staff at Stanford; but no, it
will not be a perfect structure that
meets all of the high expectations peo
ple have for it.
The same judgment can be made of
the University, of course — we have an
idealistic picture of what the Univer
sity should be, and in many respects it
does not live up to that image. In con
sidering the union, then, it is far better
to disillusion ourselves about what the

union can be and do before it is ac
cepted than to be disillusioned after
wards as the realities of this very im
perfect human organization dealing
with a very imperfect employer be
come clear.
I would like, then, to discuss what I
see as three of the most important
dilemmas raised in the election cam
paign. Certification of the union would
involve trade-offs in each of these
problem areas;
Flexibility of policies and practices
vs. favoritism and resulting injustices
to particular workers. Believe it or
not, Stanford is relatively flexible in
its administrative policies. The bu
reaucratic mentality is not terribly
highly developed here (although I am
told it is very highly developed in cer
tain offices) and the organization in
general has a fairly relaxed teeling to
it.
This means that supervisors have a
measdre of discretion to set otfice
practices, recommend salary in
creases, be friendly or hostile, and so
on. It also means that they can be un
fair for reasons totally unrelated to a
person's performance or competence.
This situation is likely to change if the
union is accepted. Supervisor discre
tion will be reduced , office practices,
salary increases, and job classi
fications are likely to be written into
the union contract, and some of the un
justifiable inequities suffered by em
ployees are likely to be eliminated.
But bureaucratic rigidity is likely to
increase at the same time. Individuals
ot exceptional competence are likely
to be even less able to gain additional
salary increases because seniority
will become more important as the
basis for salary changes. Disputes
over job descriptions are likely to be
come more prevalent, as are more
careful efforts on the part of both the
union and the University to see to it
that rules and regulations written into
the contract are followed to the letter.
If you are unaware of the costs —
both psychological and material — in
volved in a highly bureaucratic uni
versity, visit your counterparts at a
place like San Jose State University.
Less flexible policies and less super

visorial discretion may end some in
justices; the resulting bureau
cratization can be very unpleasant.
Paternalism vs. more adversarial
relationship between supervisors and
employees. While I have not person
ally witnessed much paternalism in
supervisors' attitudes toward employ
ees, it is clear that many clerical
workers feel that the University takes
such an attitude toward them and they
quite rightly resent it.
In the present relationship all power
lies on the University's side and prac
tically no power lies with the employ
ees. The best to be hoped for in this sit
uation is a benign and enlightened des
pot, and in many respects the Univer
sity sees itself as just that.
Unionization is likely to greatly
diminish the paternalism of the Uni
versity, for the University will no
longer be in the position of deciding
more or iess unilaterally what its poli
cies will be.
But as we have already seen to some
extent in the two years during which
the OSOC has worked to have the elec
tion held, unionization tends to make
the employer/employee relationship
much more adversarial than it other
wise would be. Having a union tends to
drive supervisors more toward identi
fying with "management" and to in
crease the distance between super
visors and staff.
Also, more frequent disputes over
rules and regulations tend to increase
the general level of opposition be
tween supervisors and workers. In the
best case this opposition and distance
may be beneficial in heightening su
pervisors' awareness of employee
problems and their commitment to
solving them; in the worst case it qan
mean a poisoned atmosphere for ev
eryone concerned.
Collective power and protection for
workers vs. union concern for its own
success. It seems indisputable that
that major benefit to be gained from
unionization is the collective power
that employees gain to press for im
provements in their working situ
ation. Even if the union is not particu
larly successful in making immediate
improvements, many union members
may feel a heightened sense of self-re

spect and self-worth because they are
part of the effort to make those im
provements.
Unions are subject to the same ten
dency as all other organizations: they
are likely to become ends in them
selves, to some extent, pursuing goals
that are ot benefit to the union but not
necessarily of benefit to the employ
ees it represents.
Here lies the basis for most of the
University's expressed opposition to
U.S.E./Local 715: the University feels
that U.S.E. has been more concerned
about struggling against the Univer
sity than it has about helping to solve
the problems encountered by the or
ganized employees.
And it is here that the greatest prob
lem facing the clerical staff lies if the
union should be certified: making sure
that the union structure remains re
sponsive to individual workers and
their problems rather than dealing
solely with large categories of work
ers and ignoring the special circum
stances and capacities that make one
person different from another.
The dilemmas discussed here are by
no means the only ones that need to be
examined and debated before the elec
tion — in particular, I have omitted
any consideration of the possible ef
fects of unionization on salary levels.

part of the effort to make those im
provements.
Unions are subject to the same ten
dency as all other organizations: they
are likely to become ends in them
selves, to some extent, pursuing goals
that are ot benefit to the union but not
necessarily of benefit to the employ
ees it represents.
Here lies the basis for most of the
University's expressed opposition to
U.S.E./Local 715: the University feels
that U.S.E. has been more concerned
about struggling against the Univer
sity than it has about helping to solve
the problems encountered by the or
ganized employees.
And it is here that the greatest prob
lem facing the clerical staff lies if the
union should be certified: making sure
that the union structure remains re
sponsive to individual workers and
their problems rather than dealing
solely with large categories of work
ers and ignoring the special circum
stances and capacities that make one
person different from another.
The dilemmas discussed here are by
no means the only ones that need to be
examined and debated before the elec
tion — in particular, I have omitted
any consideration of the possible ef
fects of unionization on salary levels.
What I hope to have contributed is a
suggestion of the complexities ot the
issues involved, and I hope that the
discussions that take place in these
last days of the campaign will try to
deal with the complexities as fully as
possible. I want also to emphasize to
the clerical and library workers that
the real work of gaining the benefits of
unionizaton has not yet even begun.
That will come if the union is certified,
and, as the plan now stands, the
clerical workers become part of
U.S.E. in Local 715. You will have to
work even more diligently and
energetically to build a truly demo
cratic, responsive, and progressive
union organization than you have so
far in trying to win collective bargain
ing. My hopes are with you if that
process is set in motion on May 7.
