## Money: ephemeral, accessible 
### 
Many thanks to Aleen Zim
berotf tor her excellent column,
"Students strive for Midas
touch" (Daily, Apr. 30). She
makes two very important
points about money which de
serve more careful attention.
The first is that money is
ephemeral. "It's not attractive
(green?); it talis apart in the
wash," she said. Money has not
always been like this. An old $20
gold piece is a beautiful piece of
jewelry in its own right, valu
able to the tune of about 600 pa
per dollars in 1981. As recently
as ' 965, money had intrinsic val
ue: you could not melt down a
silver quarter to make photo
graphic film. Today, that silver
quarter is worth almost three
dollars.
The old system was some
what irrational. It involved dig
ging a lot of gold out of the
ground at tremendous expense,
only to bury it again in bank
vaults. But at least the dollar
had some tangible relation to re
ality.
Today, most of the money in
the world is not even green pa
per. It is simply the orientation
of a few molecules of magnetic
iron in a computer's memory
bank. All this money is backed
only by "the full faith and credit
of the United States govern
ment." In other words: in the
age of Watergate, the secret
Cambodia bombings, "WIN"
and "MEOW" campaigns, and
now President Ronald Reagan's
pardon of FBI criminals, the
government is saying "trust

me" about the value of money.
Zimberoft's other observa
tion is that more and more peo
ple see their careers in terms of
making money rather than
doing useful work. Many law
yers are concerned with making
money, not making justice.
Bankers and bureaucrats spend
all their time trying to impress
the right people, so that the
magical substance will accrue
to their own bank accounts.
People don't realize how easy
it is for someone in the right
place to "make money.'' When
Reagan talks about running a 40
billion dollar deficit, he means
that the Federal Reserve Bank
is going to make 40 billion
dollars out of thin air. Others
can effectively participate in
this process of credit growth:
bank loans, municipal and cor
porate bonds, and Third World
economic aid are all forms of
funny-money creation.
Even you can make some
easy money on a Saturday after
noon. Just use your credit card,
and money that did not exist
before will be created, and ap
pear in the merchant's bank ac
count. If you are unskilled at
avoiding the collection agent,
you might have to pay the mon
ey back.
No such constraint applies to
many "money-makers." Big
borrowers, just "roll over"
their debts when they are due.
When they are in trouble, they
can even borrow their interest
payments, as New York has
done, and most of the third

world is doing. The only real
limit on credit expansion (that
is, money creation) is "fiscal
prudence," a concept which is
ballooning faster than inflation
itself.
In this environment, it is no
wonder people think that the
surest way to riches is not to
produce goods and services, but
to somehow get hold of the
crank that turns the funny-mon
ey machine. In a very real
sense, our monetary system is
corrupting the value system of
an entire generation.
Aleen Zimberoft gives good
advice. Think hard about mon
ey, what it is, and what it says
about society. Think hard about
making money, and whether
you are really doing anything to
earn the money you are making.
We are a very industrious and
clever generation. If making
money is what we really want to
do, we will probably succeed
beyond our wildest expecta
tions. If we succeed well
enough, perhaps even bank
tellers and auto workers will be
millionaires. After all, money is
easy to print, and the govern
ment may ultimately supply
enough of it to meet the demand.
But when we are all to busy
making money to waste any
time baking bread, please tell
me: how much is a loaf of bread
going to cost?
