## David Miller Welfare state serves conservatives, defrauds poor 
### 
In the ongoing debate over the budget proposals, both
President Ronald Reagan and his opponents accept the
premise that the primary function of the bulk of non
military government spending is to provide a "safety
net" to protect the poor and less fortunate.
Reagan has promised to leave this "safety net" in
place, and, in fact, his proposals do leave the basic
structure of the welfare state intact. Indeed, as he re
minded us in his recent speech to Congress, his pro
posed tax and budget "cuts" will not actually reduce
government taxation and spending at all: the Reagan
"cuts" will allow a continuing increase in the federal
budget. Only the rate of increase will be somewhat
slowed.
When even conservatives such as Reagan are swear
ing allegiance to the welfare state, one begins to won
der whether the welfare state really is the progressive,
humane, and liberal institution that it is widely per
ceived to be. Does the welfare state really serve the
needs and interests of the poor and less fortunate mem
bers of our society?
During the height of the Great Society, the Institute
for Policy Studies, a left-liberal think tank based in
Washington, D.C., investigated the flow of government
funds into and out of a low-income black ghetto (Shaw-
Cardoza) in the nation's capital. The study concluded
that government extracted substantially more money
in taxes from the depressed district than it returned in
total government spending directed to the district (for
welfare, public education, etc.).
Broader-based studies in the same period found that,
when all taxes are taken into account, the lower-in
come classes pay a much higher fraction of their in
come in taxes than do middle-income taxpayers: ex
amples of particularly regressive taxes include the
sales tax and the Social Security tax.
Even at the apogee of liberalism during the Great So

ciety years, government seems to have done more
harm than good to the poor. The same pattern prevails
in the present more conservative period.
Milton and Rose Friedman nicely summed up the
current situation in their recent book Free to Choose: in
1978, "expenditures on welfare programs amounted to
about $3500 per person below the poverty level or about
$14,000 per family of four â€” roughly twice the poverty
level itself. If these funds were all going to the 'poor,'
there would be no poor left..."
The unpleasant fact is that the massive government
spending on social and welfare programs largely does
not go to benefit the poor. Where then does all the mon
ey go?
Much of it is siphoned off to pay the salaries of
middle-class social workers, administrators, clerks,
and bureaucrats. And what money is left over after
such expenses often goes not to the poor but to affluent
middle-class recipients.
Similarly, middle-class retirees receive Social Se
curity benefits paid for out of working-class wages.
Children of affluent families eat federally-subsidized
lunches in tax-supported schools. Federal subsidies,
supposedly to aid struggling family farms, fill the cof
fers of large-scale agribusiness.
While the welfare state does not relieve the poverty
of the less fortunate, it does therefore fulfill
marvelously another function: it funnels money into
the hands of certain privileged members of the middle
and upper classes, and, simultaneously, assuages
middle-class guilt by presenting the appearance of aid
ing the poor.
The welfare state allows the affluent to tell them
selves that they "gave at the office," that they have al
ready fulfilled their obligations to the poor by paying
their taxes. By creating the illusion that the poor are
already adequately being taken care of, the welfare

state discourages the natural impulse to charity; the
care and giving which would normally flow to the less
tortunate dry up as the result ot the welfare state.
The welfare state is, on the basis of the evidence, an
enormous con game which politicians and some meih
bers ot the affluent classes play to mutual advantage
but at the expense of the poor.
The special privileges for the affluent, the corruption
of charity, and the disregard tor the poor which the wel
fare state embodies under both liberals and conserva
tives are neither political accidents to be cured by some
conscientious reforms nor the results of some con
scious conspiracy which can be ended by installing a
new group ot political leaders.
Rather, the tragedies of the welfare state are the in
evitable result of turning over the responsibility for
cnarity to the state.
Neither the liberal and leftist goal of expanding the
weltare state nor the conservative goal of .making it
more etficient can aUer two basic po\itica\ tacts , tirst,
that inevitably government is primarily responsive to
those classes which are affluent and articulate and
which possess social and economic power; second, that
if weltare continues to be a function of government, it
will therefore continue to serve the interests of the af
fluent classes at the expense ot the poor.
Any informed person who honestly cares about the
poor therefore has no choice but to endorse the pro
gram advocated by radical libertarians: a complete
dismantling of the welfare state and a strict separation
between charitable activities and the state. That is the
only course which can end the massive fraud which the
welfare state perpetrates against the poor.
