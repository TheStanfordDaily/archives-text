## Grain embargo prompted USSR agricultural change 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — The grain em
bargo President Ronald Reagan
halted last month aggravated
chronic meat and dairy short
ages for Soviet consumers, but
it also may have spurred some
agricultural policy changes in
tended to reduce reliance on
U.S. grain imports.
While evidence of a direct link
to the embargo is inconclusive,
the Kremlin recently has taken
steps to increase farm efficien
cy, including a January decree
removing tight restrictions on
peasants' private livestock. If
collective and state farm work
ers respond and the leadership
does not reverse itself — as it
has with similar reforms in
years past — Soviet beef and
dairy herds could grow substan
tially and at much lower cost to
the state because private hus
bandry is much more efficient.
Debate emerging on embargo
At the same time, although
official propaganda claims the
United States was hurt by the
embargo and this country was
ffl)t, a debate is emerging here
about the lessons to be learned
firom President Carter's meth
od of retaliation against the So
viets in the wake of the invasion
of Afghanistan.
In a characteristic comment,
a senior agro-economist wrote
recently in the party news
paper, Pravda, "Although the
embargo has failed, it does
make us have second thoughts
about the advisability of large
scale wheat purchases. "
But as interviews with well
informed Western diplomats
and unofficial Soviet sources
who closely follow economic
matters show, there are no
quick fixes tor Moscow in the
embargo's aftermath tor what
has always been the Achilles
heel of the communist economy.
Agricultural results during the
Brezhnev era have lagged far
behind hopes despite billions of
rubles spent to set up integrated
agro-industries, reclaim land,
increase fertilizers and mecha
nization, improve crop species
and raise pay and living stan
dards for the nation's 25 million
agricultural workers.
Chronic inefficiencies
Saddled with chronic ineffi
ciencies that, for example, re
sult in officially estimated crop
losses of 20 percent even under
ideal conditions, the Soviet
Union was hard hit by President
Carter's ban 16 months ago on 17
million extra tons of grain. ,
Quick Soviet deals allowed
Moscow to make up almost all
of the 35 million tons of teed they
needed tor 1980-8! to maintain

the herds.
Reduced fodder reserves af
ter two poor harvests in a row
and four sub-par years in six,
compounded the problem. While
Western predictions of major
distress slaughters proved
wrong, Soviet cattle are thinner
and milk output is falling.
Milk and meat rationing
The cumulative effect for a
nation with a growing popu
lation is to make fresh meat and
milk either scarce or a luxury
item. Soviets and foreigners
throughout the past year have
brought back reports of milk ra
tioning or a complete absence of
meat in state stores in such ma
jor provincial cities as Kazan,
Kharkov and Vologda.
The political quotient of un
fulfilled promises of more meat
on Soviet dinner tables has been
raised enormously by the Polish
crisis. Analysts here point out
the jamming of Western radio
stations continues, while of
ficial media have said little
about Moscow's food aid to Po
land, where meat and other
shortages sparked demonstra
tions that have been trans
formed into one of the
Kremlin's gravest postwar
crises.
Special food program
Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev h&s admitted that
problems still exist in supplying
meat and produce to the na
tion's cities, and he announced a
special food program in Febru
ary as a possible remedy. Mean
while, freakish spring weather
has dimmed prospects for this
year's harvest.
Several foreign and Soviet an
alysts who believe the embargo
has triggered reform point to
several party decrees back to
March 1980, and to the raising of
Mikhail Gorbachov, 50-year-old
Stavropol agricultural chief, to
the Politburo last year as signs
of this. Gorbachov, whose home
area is a consistent top farm
performer, is thought to favor
reform and to be youthful and
clever enough to both push
change and avoid confrontation
with the elderly ideologues
around Brezhnev.
Private livestock ownership
The Jan. 17 decree apparently
removes 11-year old restric
tions on private livestock own
ership. The previous limits al
lowed a collective farmer one
cow with calves of up to a year,
a calf of up to two years, a sow
with piglets no older than three
months, two hogs for fattening
and 10 sheep or goats. No new
limit has been set, and the press
now is running articles of the
successes and efficiencies of

raising livestock under long
term contract with state farms
and enterprises, which the
decree allows.
The decree also orders the
farms to provide young stock*
feed, pasture and tools as part of
the "creation of a public
climate" for individual en
terprise. Better credit and ad
vances also are called for. Simi
lar cash incentives have been
decreed since the embargo, to
raise fodder reserves, and to es
tablish incentives for higher
production.
All these measures point to
further long-term changes, but
no fundamental or sweeping re
form of the troubled Soviet agri
cultural system. Meanwhile,
several foreign diplomats have
speculated that the Soviets, to
eliminate the threat of yet an
other embargo if a Warsaw Pact
intervention in Poland occurs
later this year, may attempt to
quickly buy and ship as much
higher-quality U.S. grain as it
can now.
