# Gay Awareness Week begins with rally
## 
### Cynthia Moses 
A crowd of about 50 people gathered
in White Plaza yestefday to kick off
Gay Awareness Week.
The rally, sponsored by the Gay
People's Union, featured speakers
Cleve Jones, a consultant for the Dem
ocratic Party majority in the Califor
nia Assembly, and Diana Egly, a
member of the steering committee ot
Palo Altans for Human Rights.
Jones, introduced as an aide and
confidant ot Harvey Milk, the super
visor who was gunned down along with
San Francisco Mayor George
Moscone in 1978, told the crowd, "We
are becoming a family. We are form
ing social networks that give us the
strength to confront the world with its
outside hostility." It is important for
gays to build up strength to combat
such groups as the Moral Majority,
Jones added.
In his speech, Jones assailed the
controversial CBS documentary, Gay
Rights, Gay Power, for which he was
interviewed. He said CBS showed
homosexuals as obsessed with sado
masochism and erotica after assuring
those who took part in the film that
they were making a documentary
about the politics of homosexuality.
Jones said the film was "foolish and a
waste of time. "
"Sex has everything to do with poli
tics — our politics," Jones said. "But
homosexuality is not the same as non
loving "

According to Jones, "Most people,
like those at CBS, focus their attention
on the bizarre. I'm not interested in
the opinions of straight people," said
Jones who praised the of
gay ghettos."
"When we discuss sex as homosex
ual, our existence places us in a state
of personal crisis. We have been
lorceci to consider isolation as protec
tion."
Jones said, "Gay ghettos offer so
cial cohesiveness, self-growth and dis
covery that can benefit the move
ment."
He called on all gays to find their
niche in the movement and do some
thing to help it.
Egly said that the Palo Alto City
Council is turning a decision to pass a
Gay Rights Ordinance over to the vot
ers next November. The ordinance
would form a framework for a philoso
phy and environment to create protec
tions for gay people, as well as non
gays.
People who are not gay are often
discriminated against in housing and
employment for reasons of homosex
uality, according to Egly. She told of a
man who was evicted from his apart
ment when the landlord saw him hug
ging another man. The other man was
the evicted man's brother, Egly said.
Steve Kaye, a graduate student in
physics, who organized the rally, told
the Daily that the crowd was expected
to be small. "A lot of closets (gays)

won't show up," Kaye said. He said
that many Stanford students prefer to
keep their sexual preferences quiet.
Ray Baxter, a student in com
munication, brought a videos tape crew
to the rally. Baxter is making a film
modeled after Word is Out, a film pro
duced by Peter Adair. The film, a

compilation of interviews with gay
Stanford students, will be more rela
tive to campus gay people than
Adair's film, according to Baxter.
Baxter's film will become a part of
the Residential Education library and
will be used to spur discussions about
homosexuality.

Can Stanford be saved?
A man who identified himself as "a sinner saved by the grace of God"
set the unofficial Stanford record for non-stop preaching in White Plaza
yesterday. Wearing a sandwich placard denouncing "queers, pot
smokers, fornicators, communists, thieves, Mormons, ' and others as
"sinners," the man spoke for more than four hours quoting the Bible con
tinually. His voice remained strong throughout, and his remarks were
met by cheers and boos by a constant crowd of at least 150 throughout the
afternoon.
