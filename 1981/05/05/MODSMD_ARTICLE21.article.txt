# South Asia diplomats form regional bloc
## 
### Washington Post 
Colombo, Sri Lanka — The seven nations
of southern Asia, which account for one
fifth of the world's population, took the first
halting steps last week toward overcoming
decades ot hostilities and achieving re
gional cooperation.
While internal tensions in a far-off corner
of the world ordinarily would be ot little con
cern elsewhere, southern Asia has found
itself in recent years swept into the East-;
West superpower rivalry, with the Soviet in
vasion ot Afghanistan and moves by both
sides to expand militarily into the Indian
Ocean.
Bury mutual suspicions
The effort here last week to bury mutual
suspicions enough to lorm a cooperative
front to deal with major regional issues was
only partly successful. The differences are
still so great that the foreign secretaries of
the seven countries could not agree to move
the talks up to the next level of officialdom,
the foreign ministers, and instead decided
simply to meet again within six months.
The foreign secretaries picked five sub
jects for possible regional cooperation: ag
riculture, rural development, communica
tions, weather, health and population ac
tivities.
While these are far less than Bangladesh
President Ziaur Rahman had in mind when
he proposed a meeting on regional coopera
tion, diplomatic observers here. said they
appear to be a good starting point for na
tions that are so close geographically but so
far apart in mutual confidence.
India and Pakistan
The meeting was held, in fact, because
neither ot the two most powerful countries
in the area — India and Pakistan — wanted
to bear the onus of refusing to come even

though they both had serious, although dif
ferent, reservations about a regional group
ing.
India, the major x power of the region,
feared that the other nations would use a re
gional grouping to gang up on it and break
its hold on such vital matters as trade with
its neighbors, control of Ganges River wa
ters that flow through Bangladesh and the
development of hydroelectric power with
Nepal.
Pakistan, the most hesitant of the seven,
feared the opposite: that the creation of a
regional organization would allow India to
increase its domination over the area. Paki
stan long has resented the "big brother" at
titude it feels India takes toward it and the
rest of the area.
Complicating the scene, the Sri Lankan
government, while playing host to the meet
ing, has begun looking eastward toward the
developing Asian countries such as Singa
pore rather than northwest toward the
southern Asian subcontinent.
East-West confrontation
A common concern of the seven countries
is that they sit in the middle of a major area
of East-West confrontation.
The region is bordered by Afghanistan,
now occupied by 85,000 Soviet troops, and
the Indian Ocean, which the United States
considers vital for the protection of key oil
lanes from the Persian Gulf to Western Eu
rope and Japan. U.S. and Western European
naval vessels patrolling the ocean have
drawn a corresponding fleet from the Soviet
Union, which is establishing bases on the
ocean's northern fringes.
The new position of prominence in world
power politics and the Soviet invasion of a
neighboring state have aroused fears
among nations of southern Asia but the ef

feet has been to worsen tensions among
them rather than pulling the region closer
together.
Front-line Pakistan
Pakistan, for instance, appears likely to
become a Western-armed front line state
against further Soviet advances from Af
ghanistan — a move opposed by India,
which is Moscow's best friend in the non-
Communist world and the only country in
the region not to condemn its invasion of Af
ghanistan in December 1979.
Even the little island-chain nation of the
Maldives has been drawn into the East-West
conflict. According to reliable reports here,
the Soviets are trying to get hold of a former
British military air base on the island of
Gans, the southernmost in the chain, which
is just 240 miles from the vast U.S. air and
naval installation on the British-owned is
land of Diego Garcia.
Even without those external under
currents, the differences between southern
Asian nations run deep.
India's predominant position
The key forces revolve around India's
predominant place in the region as the larg
est, most heavily armed and technically
proficient nation in southern Asia, and the
continuing tensions between it and Paki
stan. The two nations have fought three
wars since they were carved from British
India almost 34 years ago and they now ap
pear headed for a nuclear arms race.
There also are many differences between
India and her smaller neighbors. They
range from India's desire to control
Bhutan's foreign policy and an attempt to
keep Nepali-made Coca Cola from India to
the knotty problem with Bangladesh over
water rights.

wars since they were carved from British
India almost 34 years ago and they now ap
pear headed for a nuclear arms race.

Colombo, Sri Lanka — The seven nations
of southern Asia, which account for one
fifth of the world's population, took the first
halting steps last week toward overcoming
decades ot hostilities and achieving re
gional cooperation.
While internal tensions in a far-off corner
of the world ordinarily would be ot little con
cern elsewhere, southern Asia has found
itself in recent years swept into the East-;
West superpower rivalry, with the Soviet in
vasion ot Afghanistan and moves by both
sides to expand militarily into the Indian
Ocean.
Bury mutual suspicions
The effort here last week to bury mutual
suspicions enough to lorm a cooperative
front to deal with major regional issues was
only partly successful. The differences are
still so great that the foreign secretaries of
the seven countries could not agree to move
the talks up to the next level of officialdom,
the foreign ministers, and instead decided
simply to meet again within six months.
The foreign secretaries picked five sub
jects for possible regional cooperation: ag
riculture, rural development, communica
tions, weather, health and population ac
tivities.
While these are far less than Bangladesh
President Ziaur Rahman had in mind when
he proposed a meeting on regional coopera
tion, diplomatic observers here. said they
appear to be a good starting point for na
tions that are so close geographically but so
far apart in mutual confidence.
India and Pakistan
The meeting was held, in fact, because
neither ot the two most powerful countries
in the area — India and Pakistan — wanted
to bear the onus of refusing to come even

though they both had serious, although dif
ferent, reservations about a regional group
ing.
India, the major x power of the region,
feared that the other nations would use a re
gional grouping to gang up on it and break
its hold on such vital matters as trade with
its neighbors, control of Ganges River wa
ters that flow through Bangladesh and the
development of hydroelectric power with
Nepal.
Pakistan, the most hesitant of the seven,
feared the opposite: that the creation of a
regional organization would allow India to
increase its domination over the area. Paki
stan long has resented the "big brother" at
titude it feels India takes toward it and the
rest of the area.
Complicating the scene, the Sri Lankan
government, while playing host to the meet
ing, has begun looking eastward toward the
developing Asian countries such as Singa
pore rather than northwest toward the
southern Asian subcontinent.
East-West confrontation
A common concern of the seven countries
is that they sit in the middle of a major area
of East-West confrontation.
The region is bordered by Afghanistan,
now occupied by 85,000 Soviet troops, and
the Indian Ocean, which the United States
considers vital for the protection of key oil
lanes from the Persian Gulf to Western Eu
rope and Japan. U.S. and Western European
naval vessels patrolling the ocean have
drawn a corresponding fleet from the Soviet
Union, which is establishing bases on the
ocean's northern fringes.
The new position of prominence in world
power politics and the Soviet invasion of a
neighboring state have aroused fears
among nations of southern Asia but the ef

feet has been to worsen tensions among
them rather than pulling the region closer
together.
Front-line Pakistan
Pakistan, for instance, appears likely to
become a Western-armed front line state
against further Soviet advances from Af
ghanistan — a move opposed by India,
which is Moscow's best friend in the non-
Communist world and the only country in
the region not to condemn its invasion of Af
ghanistan in December 1979.
Even the little island-chain nation of the
Maldives has been drawn into the East-West
conflict. According to reliable reports here,
the Soviets are trying to get hold of a former
British military air base on the island of
Gans, the southernmost in the chain, which
is just 240 miles from the vast U.S. air and
naval installation on the British-owned is
land of Diego Garcia.
Even without those external under
currents, the differences between southern
Asian nations run deep.
India's predominant position
The key forces revolve around India's
predominant place in the region as the larg
est, most heavily armed and technically
proficient nation in southern Asia, and the
continuing tensions between it and Paki
stan. The two nations have fought three
wars since they were carved from British
India almost 34 years ago and they now ap
pear headed for a nuclear arms race.
There also are many differences between
India and her smaller neighbors. They
range from India's desire to control
Bhutan's foreign policy and an attempt to
keep Nepali-made Coca Cola from India to
the knotty problem with Bangladesh over
water rights.
