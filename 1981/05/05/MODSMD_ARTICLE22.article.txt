From the Daily wire services
Rome â€” The debate over
abortion in Italy, which has al
ready led to a deterioration in
the delicate relationship be
tween church and state, is now
threatening the cohesion of the
country's four-party coalition
government.
Two weeks before a referen
dum on the issue, the mobiliza
tion ot Italy's secular political
parties against what they call
the pope's crusade is creating
tensions inside the adminis
tration of Prime Minister
Arnaldo Forlani.
"Christian Democracy does
not intend to remain neutral/'
said Party General Secretary
Flamino Piccoli, describing ail
"sinister and worrying" the
campaign "aimed at preventing
the pope from exercising hi&
right and duty."
Socialist Party leader Bettino
Craxi has said that "serious dif
ficulties" would arise if the 1978
law permitting deliberate ter
mination ot pregnancies is
"abolished" and parliament is
"humiliated."
'Modify political relations'
In a veiled threat to the Chris
tian Democrat Party, the So
cialist leader said that "th^'de
bate on abortion may modify po
litical relations."
The Socialists have been shar
ing power with the Christian
Democrats, the Republican
Party and the Social Democrat
ic Party for the past year.
Meanwhile, according to an
opinion poll by the Demoskopea
Institute, 60 percent of voters in
Italy would approve the May 17
referendum promoted by the
"movement for life" which al
lows for a change in the present
law permitting abortions. Thir
ty-three percent would say "no"
to a change, it said.
According to the same poll, 63
percent of women and 57 per
cent of men would vote for the
change, being promoted by the
Catholic establishment, which
would restrict abortions to
cases of women requiring them
for therapeutic reasons.
A total 113,000 legal abortions
were performed in Italy in the
first six months of last year. Ac
cording to the World Health Or
ganization, some 800,000 illegal
abortions were carried out an
nually in Italy before the 1978
law became effective.
