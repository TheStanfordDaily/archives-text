## Fripp's ego comes close to wrecking his new album 
### Tony Kelly 
If Brian Eno is the Captain Kangaroo of avant-garde
nusic. then Robert Fripp is Mr. Greenjeans. Mr.
'ireenjeans, for those of you who lived in caves between
ihe ages of three and 10, is the guy on the children's TV
show who always brings in the animals to show the Cap
lain. Never mind that the Captain has already seen
ihem betore.
"And today I brought along two weasels, Captain."
"They're very nice, Mr. Greenjeans. But didn't I
show all the children these same weasels last week?"
"Well yes you did, Captain. But now they're my
weasels, and I named them. This one's Billy and this
one's Joel. Aren't they cute?"
Robert Fripp is the same way. A superbly talented
guitarist since his days in King Crimson, Fripp has
spent most of his career experimenting with new ideas
in music, collaborating with musician/technician Eno
on the albums No Pussyfooting and Evening Star, and
working with art rockers David Bowie and Peter
Gabriel. However, the newness ot his ideas exists
mainly in his own mind. For instance, Eno invented a
new system ot producing music via irregularly repeat
ing tape loops and experimented with the concept on a
couple of "ambient music" albums, Music for Films
and Music for Airports. Fripp took the same system,
christened it "Frippertronics," and spent a few albums
of his own indulging himself with the sound. The word
"ego" comes to mind.
'jSince then, Eno has been experimenting in different
ways, using complex rhythms and voices taped off ra
dio broadcasts to make a new sound for his latest effort,
V£\ Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Surprisingly enough,

Fripp discovered rhythm at roughly the same time,
forming a dance band called the League of Gentlemen
and touring Europe and the eastern U.S. for six months
in 1980 The group has since disbanded, with Fripp pro
ducing a record of the association titled The League of
(ientlemen. With a brief history of the group on the
back (including a complete list of all its tour dates), the
LP seems to be intended as a sort of dance rec
ord/historical document. And indeed, The League of
(ientlemen does stand as a document, highlighting the
contrasting abilities ot Robert Fripp.
The ever-shifting modes of the record are shown
from the beginning. The League of (ientlemen begins
with "Indiscreet I," a collection of taped voices spout
ing all kinds of rhetoric about music, including the in
stantly classic phrase, "Rock and roll is about fuck
ing." Where Fripp found this discussion, I'll never want
to know. Some of the snippets are funny — once. Then
they sound indulgent, especially the statements like
"It's not a record that's out to showcase a guitar
player." When Robert Fripp is playing well, he should
be showcased — he displays an amazing talent for ex
tracting chords that don't follow any logical
progression, but still sound just right. Such is the case
on the first musical track, "Inductive Resonance." The
song is incredibly infectious — Barry Andrews, for
merly the only creative member of XTC, plays key
boards like Booker T. on speed, and the rhythm section
of Sara Lee on (simplistic) bass and Kevin Wilkinson
drumming never tails to provide a great dance beat.
After this stunner, though, comes "Minor Man," a
perfectly agreeable tune that is perfectly ruined by
Danielle Dax's screeching vocals. The song becomes an

atonal mess, its only purpose being a setup tor the
fruity, spare instrumental that follows, "Hep
taparapashinokh" (Don't ask what it means). Already,
the pattern is clear; wildly creative, pulsing dance
tunes take turns with experimental tracks. Guess
which ones sound better.
As expected, the remainder of League is much like
the beginning Along with "Indiscreet" s II and 111,
there are two tracks titled "Pareto Optimum," about
which I can only warn not to listen to with headphones
unless you want to convert your brains to Alpo.
That adds up to six songs I can't stand, yet I still find
the album immensely enjoyable. The reason is that the
League ot Gentlemen are (or were) the most in
telligent, creative dance band around. On the rest of the
14 songs, the swirling rhythms are like a command
ment from On High: Thou Shalt Move Thy Feet and
Dance. And with Andrews' Fartisa madness and
Fripp's best playing since his work on Bowie's Heroes
in 1977, you can't help but enjoy it.
Robert Fripp, still looking like a computer lizard but
partially free from his pit of pretentiousness, tackles
dance music with a vengeance on The League of Gen
tlemen. The occasional dives into self-indulgence,
always a danger with Fripp, are still present, and the
results of the experiments are simply grating. How
ever, side by side with these failures, Fripp cuts into
the music with the unfailing fervor of a biology teacher
dissecting his 10,000 th frog — you know his style, and he
offers no surprises, but his skill and talent are still ex
emplary. The only possible complaint after listening to
The League of (ientlemen is that Fripp, for all his in
telligence and talent, should just shut up and play.

show all the children these same weasels last week?"
"Well yes you did, Captain. But now they're my
weasels, and I named them. This one's Billy and this
one's Joel. Aren't they cute?"
Robert Fripp is the same way. A superbly talented
guitarist since his days in King Crimson, Fripp has
spent most of his career experimenting with new ideas
in music, collaborating with musician/technician Eno
on the albums No Pussyfooting and Evening Star, and
working with art rockers David Bowie and Peter
Gabriel. However, the newness ot his ideas exists
mainly in his own mind. For instance, Eno invented a
new system ot producing music via irregularly repeat
ing tape loops and experimented with the concept on a
couple of "ambient music" albums, Music for Films
and Music for Airports. Fripp took the same system,
christened it "Frippertronics," and spent a few albums
of his own indulging himself with the sound. The word
"ego" comes to mind.
'jSince then, Eno has been experimenting in different
ways, using complex rhythms and voices taped off ra
dio broadcasts to make a new sound for his latest effort,
V£\ Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Surprisingly enough,

Fripp discovered rhythm at roughly the same time,
forming a dance band called the League of Gentlemen
and touring Europe and the eastern U.S. for six months
in 1980 The group has since disbanded, with Fripp pro
ducing a record of the association titled The League of
(ientlemen. With a brief history of the group on the
back (including a complete list of all its tour dates), the
LP seems to be intended as a sort of dance rec
ord/historical document. And indeed, The League of
(ientlemen does stand as a document, highlighting the
contrasting abilities ot Robert Fripp.
The ever-shifting modes of the record are shown
from the beginning. The League of (ientlemen begins
with "Indiscreet I," a collection of taped voices spout
ing all kinds of rhetoric about music, including the in
stantly classic phrase, "Rock and roll is about fuck
ing." Where Fripp found this discussion, I'll never want
to know. Some of the snippets are funny — once. Then
they sound indulgent, especially the statements like
"It's not a record that's out to showcase a guitar
player." When Robert Fripp is playing well, he should
be showcased — he displays an amazing talent for ex
tracting chords that don't follow any logical
progression, but still sound just right. Such is the case
on the first musical track, "Inductive Resonance." The
song is incredibly infectious — Barry Andrews, for
merly the only creative member of XTC, plays key
boards like Booker T. on speed, and the rhythm section
of Sara Lee on (simplistic) bass and Kevin Wilkinson
drumming never tails to provide a great dance beat.
After this stunner, though, comes "Minor Man," a
perfectly agreeable tune that is perfectly ruined by
Danielle Dax's screeching vocals. The song becomes an

atonal mess, its only purpose being a setup tor the
fruity, spare instrumental that follows, "Hep
taparapashinokh" (Don't ask what it means). Already,
the pattern is clear; wildly creative, pulsing dance
tunes take turns with experimental tracks. Guess
which ones sound better.
As expected, the remainder of League is much like
the beginning Along with "Indiscreet" s II and 111,
there are two tracks titled "Pareto Optimum," about
which I can only warn not to listen to with headphones
unless you want to convert your brains to Alpo.
That adds up to six songs I can't stand, yet I still find
the album immensely enjoyable. The reason is that the
League ot Gentlemen are (or were) the most in
telligent, creative dance band around. On the rest of the
14 songs, the swirling rhythms are like a command
ment from On High: Thou Shalt Move Thy Feet and
Dance. And with Andrews' Fartisa madness and
Fripp's best playing since his work on Bowie's Heroes
in 1977, you can't help but enjoy it.
Robert Fripp, still looking like a computer lizard but
partially free from his pit of pretentiousness, tackles
dance music with a vengeance on The League of Gen
tlemen. The occasional dives into self-indulgence,
always a danger with Fripp, are still present, and the
results of the experiments are simply grating. How
ever, side by side with these failures, Fripp cuts into
the music with the unfailing fervor of a biology teacher
dissecting his 10,000 th frog — you know his style, and he
offers no surprises, but his skill and talent are still ex
emplary. The only possible complaint after listening to
The League of (ientlemen is that Fripp, for all his in
telligence and talent, should just shut up and play.

If Brian Eno is the Captain Kangaroo of avant-garde
nusic. then Robert Fripp is Mr. Greenjeans. Mr.
'ireenjeans, for those of you who lived in caves between
ihe ages of three and 10, is the guy on the children's TV
show who always brings in the animals to show the Cap
lain. Never mind that the Captain has already seen
ihem betore.
