# Who's afraid of this wolf?

### Steve Vineberg 
;*; John Sayles' name in the
credits drew me to The Howl
ing: Sayles, who wrote and
directed Return of the Secaucus
Hi'cen, has an original comic
temperament, and I hoped to
see signs of it in this werewolf
tale, one of the exploitation pic
tures he worked on in order to
supplement his earnings as a
novelist and short story writer.
Tjfjc Howling is certainly a send
up, but the script, which Sayles
and Terence Winkless (surely a
pseudonym) cut from a novel by
Gary Bnjndner, is a bit flat. A
few of the last scenes reveal
gleeful parodists at work,
tfcough the funniest touches are
visual — a copy of Allen
Ginsberg's Howl on a desk, a re
production of Edvard Munch s
.'The Howl" on a wall — and
iflay have been the thoughts of
the director, Joe Dante.
Dante sustains the tone he
wants — jokey creepiness —
through the film. He seems to
care more about tone than sus

pense, and this attitude lends
The Howling an unusual clas
siness, though some of the con
ventional horror movie values
get sacrificed as a result. How
ever, Dante and Rob Bottin,
who prepared the special make
up effects, offer the audience a
real treat: a transformation
scene that should become a clas
sic. A man metamorphoses into
a werewolf in startling close-up,
and so slowly that no detail of
the technical wizardry eludes
us: we take in the shaping of the
skull into a death's head, the
growing and gnarling of the
nails, the thrusting forward of
the neck. Dante's leisurely, ap
preciative unfolding of the proc
ess seems almost clinical, and
it's true that we watch with such
distanced fascination that we
don't become frightened — just
as we don't always laugh at
Buster Keaton's comic routines
— but we are awed by the in
tricacy of the structure and the
clockwork perfection of the tim
ing. It's a different sort of ex

perience altogether.
A movie of this type is bound
to be full of allusions to other
movies — an audience would ex
pect as much, and in fact, the
opportunity to pick out what we
recognize is part of the pleasure
of horror films. So we note with
amusement that the 1932 Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with
Fredric March clearly inspired
the transformation sequence,
and that the conspiratorial na
ture of the plot, which involves a
psychiatrist (Patrick McNee)
and a resort full of patients, is
closely related to the 1978 re
make of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers. John Carradine
shows up as an old weirdo, and
he brings with him traces of the
dozens of roles he's played in
junky Hollywood horror pic
tures. The best acting, however,
is done by a bony young man in
the role ot a morgue attendant;
of course, he also has the best
lines. His name, if I caught it
correctly, is John Sayles.
