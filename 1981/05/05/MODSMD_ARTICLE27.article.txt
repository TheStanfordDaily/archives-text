# 'Atlantic City': a new life emerges
## 
### Vince Waldman 
In revitalized Atlantic City, the dizzy
burst of gambling fever has shuffled the
new and old together like two different
decks of cards. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older buildings —
remnants of a past grandeur and a more
recent decay — tumble to the ground be
neath the wrecker's ball. The remaining
slums sit pointedly in the shadows of
opulent skyscrapers
In the vision of Louis Malle's Atlantic
City (now showing at Palo Alto Square)
the environmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change which has
seized the lives of the people of the city.
The established social order is losing its
purpose, and long-time residents are los
ing theirs.
Lou (Burt Lancaster) is an aging,
small-time crook who now earns his keep
as a housekeeper (and sometime lover)
for Grace (Kate Reid), the eccentric
widow of a murdered Atlantic City
mobster. Lou adds to his income by run
ning numbers, but the legalization of
gambling has cut deeply into this busi
ness. Only old-time res' ients still play
the numbers, and many of them are tak
ing their gambling money to the casinos.
Lou can't stand the casinos because
they're "too goddamn legal" and too
clean.
They're also eroding his life. His
apartment building will soon be de
molished, and his last roots in the town
are fading away. Nostalgically, he looks
back and sees his past as a time of gran
deur; now, he thinks even the Atlantic
ocean has become less vast, less noble.
Across the hall in Lou's building lives
Sally (Susan Sarandon), who has come
from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan to be
come a casino dealer. She listens to clas
sical music and dreams of going to Monte
Carlo, but for now she works in an oyster
bar. Each night Lou watches her through
her window as she washes her body with
lemon juice to get rid ot the fish smell.
Sally's husband ran off with her sister;
now they return, the sister pregnant,
hoping to peddle drugs they stole from
the Philadelphia mob. By chance, Lou
becomes the middle-man for the sales,
and he finally meets Sally.
The success of this convoluted tale de
pends on the strength of the character
izations, because Atlantic City is about
the juxtaposition and transformation of
people surrounded by an uncontrollably
changing world, people who are trying to
bring some sort of coherence to their

lives.
Thus Sally finds in Lou a father-figure,
a replacement for the Saskatchewan
roots to which she is determined never to
return. Sarandon's performance is per
haps her best; she projects a frightened
warmth which yearns for protection but
still dreams of adventure. For her Lou is
guardian, lover, and (most of all) teach
er.
Kate Reid's Grace, the other woman
in Lou's life, is obsessed by her roots. She
lost a Betty Grable look-alike contest but
stayed in Atlantic City to marry; she
spends most of her time in bed sur
rounded by an outrageous collection of
kitschy memorablia; she is afraid to
leave her room or to let anyone but Lou
in, as if her fragile world will crumble if
she confronts the reality outside. She de
velops an unlikely symbiosis with Sally's
sister Chrissie (Hollis McLaren), who is
as blissful in her detachment from reali
ty as Grace is ieafiu\ in hers. Chrissie is
a spaced-out flower child who practices
Korean toot-massage, retreats into man
tra when threatened, and says things like
"I never use seat belts; I don't believe in
gravity." She seems to be the only char
acter who is not disturbed by the changes
around her, probably because she is ob
livious to them. Grace and Chrissie
spend most of the movie together, se
questered in Grace's otherworldly
bedroom. Both Reid, as the '40s recluse,
and McLaren, as the Love Generation
throwback, giVe vitality and sensitivity
to parts that could have degenerated into
cartoon stereotypes. Their interaction is
fascinating to watch, especially the way
Reid slowly begins to crawl out of her
shell in response to Chrissie's cosmic
philosophizing.
Robert Joy plays Dave, Sally's hus
band and Chrissie's lover. H e wears a
perpetual mask of ingratiating subser
vience. From behind it peer eyes which
dart around, looking for a corner in
which to hide. He combines an obsession
with self-preservation and a pathetic,
doomed will to be liked in a manner rem
iniscent ot Peter Lorre.
All these performances are re
markable, but Burt Lancaster's Lou ov
ershadows them all. Lancaster is nearly
seventy, and when we first see him in A t
lantic City he is a fat old man in a t-shirt,
ironing ties and hopelessly spying on
Sarandon from afar. But events trans
form him as they transform the city: as
the film progresses, the audience slowly
becomes aware that Lancaster is an ex
tremely handsome man, still dashing,
still magnetic. Wrinkles around his eyes

have softened the intensity of Lan
caster's expression, but he can still
pierce the screen with the absorbing
gaze of J.J. Hunsecker, and the
apocalyptic voice of Elmer Gantry.
John Guare's screenplay reinforces
the film's striking juxtaposition of dis
parate elements. Guare's dialogue is
often made up of non sequiturs which
don't further the plot so much as they
convey a sense of disorder in his charac
ter's lives. Lou stands on the Boardwalk
breathing in the sea air and remembers
that Atlantic City used to be called "The
Lungs of Philadelphia"; almost sotto
voce, his cocaine-dealing partner retorts
that his ambition is to be "The Nose of
Philadelphia."
Director Louis Malle's other Ameri
can film, Pretty Baby, also dealt with an
urban environment undergoing change
— in this case, the Storyville district of
New Orleans. But in Pretty Babv Malle
strived (not always with success) to
evoke a unified mood of languid
hedonism. In Atlantic City the at
mosphere is deliberately incoherent in
order to further underscore the con
fusion in and around the characters'
lives.
Many of the sets are jarringly chaotic.
As Lou walks through unpaved streets
taking bets on the numbers, we see a tall
building in the background and a couple
dancing to a car radio in a vacant lot.
Grace's plush pink apartment is a dizzy
ing array of astonishingly tacky knick
knacks, of all styles and shapes. In per
haps the film's best scene, Sally must try
to call Saskatchewan with bad news
while Robert Goulet leans against her
phone booth singing an absurd paean to
Atlantic City.
Such scenes don't exactly make sense,
but they are believable within the con
text of the film. Malle and Guare create
a world in which old and new ways are
thrown together and transformed by one
another. Changes leave the characters
adrift, unable to make coherent sense of
their surroundings.
The people of Atlantic City try with
varying success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly, Malle
ends on an optimistic note. It is possible,
we see, for at least some people to adjust
to new conditions, to make a com
prehensible life out of the confusion
around them. Likewise, from a mass of
discordant elements the film itself
emerges to form a new, vital tapestry of
lives.

changing world, people who are trying to
bring some sort of coherence to their

lives.
Thus Sally finds in Lou a father-figure,
a replacement for the Saskatchewan
roots to which she is determined never to
return. Sarandon's performance is per
haps her best; she projects a frightened
warmth which yearns for protection but
still dreams of adventure. For her Lou is
guardian, lover, and (most of all) teach
er.
Kate Reid's Grace, the other woman
in Lou's life, is obsessed by her roots. She
lost a Betty Grable look-alike contest but
stayed in Atlantic City to marry; she
spends most of her time in bed sur
rounded by an outrageous collection of
kitschy memorablia; she is afraid to
leave her room or to let anyone but Lou
in, as if her fragile world will crumble if
she confronts the reality outside. She de
velops an unlikely symbiosis with Sally's
sister Chrissie (Hollis McLaren), who is
as blissful in her detachment from reali
ty as Grace is ieafiu\ in hers. Chrissie is
a spaced-out flower child who practices
Korean toot-massage, retreats into man
tra when threatened, and says things like
"I never use seat belts; I don't believe in
gravity." She seems to be the only char
acter who is not disturbed by the changes
around her, probably because she is ob
livious to them. Grace and Chrissie
spend most of the movie together, se
questered in Grace's otherworldly
bedroom. Both Reid, as the '40s recluse,
and McLaren, as the Love Generation
throwback, giVe vitality and sensitivity
to parts that could have degenerated into
cartoon stereotypes. Their interaction is
fascinating to watch, especially the way
Reid slowly begins to crawl out of her
shell in response to Chrissie's cosmic
philosophizing.
Robert Joy plays Dave, Sally's hus
band and Chrissie's lover. H e wears a
perpetual mask of ingratiating subser
vience. From behind it peer eyes which
dart around, looking for a corner in
which to hide. He combines an obsession
with self-preservation and a pathetic,
doomed will to be liked in a manner rem
iniscent ot Peter Lorre.
All these performances are re
markable, but Burt Lancaster's Lou ov
ershadows them all. Lancaster is nearly
seventy, and when we first see him in A t
lantic City he is a fat old man in a t-shirt,
ironing ties and hopelessly spying on
Sarandon from afar. But events trans
form him as they transform the city: as
the film progresses, the audience slowly
becomes aware that Lancaster is an ex
tremely handsome man, still dashing,
still magnetic. Wrinkles around his eyes

have softened the intensity of Lan
caster's expression, but he can still
pierce the screen with the absorbing
gaze of J.J. Hunsecker, and the
apocalyptic voice of Elmer Gantry.
John Guare's screenplay reinforces
the film's striking juxtaposition of dis
parate elements. Guare's dialogue is
often made up of non sequiturs which
don't further the plot so much as they
convey a sense of disorder in his charac
ter's lives. Lou stands on the Boardwalk
breathing in the sea air and remembers
that Atlantic City used to be called "The
Lungs of Philadelphia"; almost sotto
voce, his cocaine-dealing partner retorts
that his ambition is to be "The Nose of
Philadelphia."
Director Louis Malle's other Ameri
can film, Pretty Baby, also dealt with an
urban environment undergoing change
— in this case, the Storyville district of
New Orleans. But in Pretty Babv Malle
strived (not always with success) to
evoke a unified mood of languid
hedonism. In Atlantic City the at
mosphere is deliberately incoherent in
order to further underscore the con
fusion in and around the characters'
lives.
Many of the sets are jarringly chaotic.
As Lou walks through unpaved streets
taking bets on the numbers, we see a tall
building in the background and a couple
dancing to a car radio in a vacant lot.
Grace's plush pink apartment is a dizzy
ing array of astonishingly tacky knick
knacks, of all styles and shapes. In per
haps the film's best scene, Sally must try
to call Saskatchewan with bad news
while Robert Goulet leans against her
phone booth singing an absurd paean to
Atlantic City.
Such scenes don't exactly make sense,
but they are believable within the con
text of the film. Malle and Guare create
a world in which old and new ways are
thrown together and transformed by one
another. Changes leave the characters
adrift, unable to make coherent sense of
their surroundings.
The people of Atlantic City try with
varying success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly, Malle
ends on an optimistic note. It is possible,
we see, for at least some people to adjust
to new conditions, to make a com
prehensible life out of the confusion
around them. Likewise, from a mass of
discordant elements the film itself
emerges to form a new, vital tapestry of
lives.
In revitalized Atlantic City, the dizzy
burst of gambling fever has shuffled the
new and old together like two different
decks of cards. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older buildings —
remnants of a past grandeur and a more
recent decay — tumble to the ground be
neath the wrecker's ball. The remaining
slums sit pointedly in the shadows of
opulent skyscrapers
In the vision of Louis Malle's Atlantic
City (now showing at Palo Alto Square)
the environmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change which has
seized the lives of the people of the city.
The established social order is losing its
purpose, and long-time residents are los
ing theirs.
Lou (Burt Lancaster) is an aging,
small-time crook who now earns his keep
as a housekeeper (and sometime lover)
for Grace (Kate Reid), the eccentric
widow of a murdered Atlantic City
mobster. Lou adds to his income by run
ning numbers, but the legalization of
gambling has cut deeply into this busi
ness. Only old-time res' ients still play
the numbers, and many of them are tak
ing their gambling money to the casinos.
Lou can't stand the casinos because
they're "too goddamn legal" and too
clean.
They're also eroding his life. His
apartment building will soon be de
molished, and his last roots in the town
are fading away. Nostalgically, he looks
back and sees his past as a time of gran
deur; now, he thinks even the Atlantic
ocean has become less vast, less noble.
Across the hall in Lou's building lives
Sally (Susan Sarandon), who has come
from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan to be
come a casino dealer. She listens to clas
sical music and dreams of going to Monte
Carlo, but for now she works in an oyster
bar. Each night Lou watches her through
her window as she washes her body with
lemon juice to get rid ot the fish smell.
Sally's husband ran off with her sister;
now they return, the sister pregnant,
hoping to peddle drugs they stole from
the Philadelphia mob. By chance, Lou
becomes the middle-man for the sales,
and he finally meets Sally.
The success of this convoluted tale de
pends on the strength of the character
izations, because Atlantic City is about
the juxtaposition and transformation of
people surrounded by an uncontrollably
changing world, people who are trying to
bring some sort of coherence to their

lives.
