# Christensen tops uneven eve at SF Ballet
## 
### Mary Walp 
Last Tuesday evening the San
Francisco Ballet performed a
program of four varied ballets,
beginning shakily with Tomm
Ruud's Introduction and Alle
gro. and ending with Lew Chris
tensen's wonderful revival of
Balanchine's Variations de
Ballet.
Placing Ruud's work hrst
may have been calculated to get
the weakest ballet over with
first; although it was pretty, it
failed to "mirror the expansive
ness of the music" as the pro
gram notes claim, because it
never progressed from the
opening level. A ballet that fails
to move anywhere can hardly be
called "expansive."
Michael Smuin's fiohquet fol
lowed. It began with a beautiful
modern pas de deux danced by
Tracy-Kai Maier and Vane
Vest, which was followed by a
more classical pas de quatre in

which Madeline Bouchard was
supported by three men.
Smuin's choreography handled
this unusual contrast extremely
well, as did the performances of
the dancers, especially the vari
ation performed by the three
men in the second half of the
ballet. The only bothersome mo
ments of the ballet were a tew
lifts and turns which were too
obviously anticipated by the
dancers.
The other Smuin work on the
program was his A Sonft for
Dead Warriors, a statement
about the problem of the Ameri
can Indian in this country today.
As Smuin traces one native
American's life (Antonio
Lopez), the audience is given an
insight into the conflict between
American culture and the tradi
tions of the Indian.
Antonio Lopez dances this
role with a powerful insight into

the frustrations of a repressed,
yet strong, man, and his ties to
his heritage are represented by
the strong performances of five
ancestral chiefs. Evelyn Cis
neros dances the role of Lopez's
girlfriend with extreme sensi
tivity, and the police, led by
Vane Vest, provide an irritating
yet properly arrogant image
with which Lopez is in constant
struggle. Notable was Vest's
and Lopez's final pas de deux, in
which each are finally de
stroyed.
The unusual sets for the ballet
effectively reflected its theme.
The entire work was danced be
hind a transparent screen onto
which slides of various aspects
of Indian life were flashed be
tween each stage of Lopez's life.
However, during the vision se
quence, the huge figures of buf
faloes and police which loom
from the darkness upstage are
almost comical rather than

ominous figures.
The shining finish to the eve
ning was Lew Christensen's re
vival ot Variations de Pallet.
Based on Act 111 ot Raymonda,
it is a consistently fresh and in
teresting ballet. The dancers all
came alive, bringing an en
thusiasm to the work Even th 6
corps seemed brilliant, holding
a spirited energy throughout the
ballet. Although the five men of
the second variation did appear
bored at times, they revived
themselves when the 10 women
joined them during the waltz.
Tracy-Kai Maier executed a
series of exceptionally quick but
still neat passes during the
Coda, which rivaled the more
difficult chainees and
pirouettes of Betsey Erickson'i
solo. Overall, this ballet was full
of impressive dancing which acr
centuated the choreography;
providing a refreshing end to an
evening which appeared
doubtful at the outset.
