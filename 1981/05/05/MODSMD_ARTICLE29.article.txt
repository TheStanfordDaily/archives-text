Reagan's budget expected to pass
Washington — The House appears certain to hand Presi
dent Ronald Reagan the budget blueprint he wants this
week, with enough Democrats lined up to help Re
publicans pass it.
An Associated Press survey found 29 House Democrats
definitely supporting the president's plan instead of their
own party's alternative and others leaning that way. One
Democratic aide said more defections are possible as the
vote nears.
The House, where the Reagan program had been ex
pected to face its stiftest test, was resuming debate and
moving toward a likely vote today.
The outcome in the Senate, which may not vote until
next week, is almost a foregone conclusion. Reagan's fel
low Republicans are in the majority, and Democratic
leader Robert Byrd announced over the weekend that he is
resigned to supporting the president despite doubts his
plan will work.
The conflict arises because Democrats and Republicans
have been using different sets of revenue and expense
projections, based on differing forecasts about the future
course ot the economy, to support their arguments and to
compare the administration-backed plan with the Demo
cratic alternative, which would spend more on social pro
grams than Reagan wants.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill has emphasized that the
budget vote is only "the first skirmish," noting the budget
resolution under consideration merely sets guidelines for
Congress to follow. The actual cuts in spending and taxes
will be voted separately later in the year.
Haig announces arms limitation talks
Rome— Secretary of State Alexander Haig assured
members ot NATO yesterday that the United States in
tends to begin talks by the end of this year with the Soviet
Union on limiting nuclear missiles in Europe.
In making the first formal commitment of the Reagan
administration to an arms control negotiation with the So
viets, however, Haig stopped short of giving the allies the
speedy timetable for such talks that they had been press
ing for.
Speaking at a closed session of the North Atlantic Coun
cil, Haig reportedly told NATO members that he would
raise the question of timing and procedures for talks on
limiting European-base missiles when he meets with Sovi
et Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at the United Na
tions next September.
Haig also added that a Soviet invasion of Poland would

be grounds for postponing the U.S. commitment to begin
talks, or for breaking off the talks if they had already
begun.
The Europeans had been pressing the Reagari adminis
tration since inauguration day to forge ahead quickly with
these arms control talks in order to give the European gov
ernments the political leverage that they say they need to
fulfill their own commitment to modernize existing tac
tical nuclear missiles in Europe
The Europeans in recent months have been disturbed by
the administration's harsh anti-Soviet rhetoric, and espe
cially by statements trom Pentagon officials that seemed
to make the arms talks hostage to Soviet restraint regard
ing the crisis in Poland and Soviet behavior elsewhere in
the world.
Smith posts restrictions on FIA
Washington — The government's new restrictive policy
on opening its files to citizens is a further hint the Reagan
administration is more inclined than its predecessor to
press tor broad changes in the Freedom of Information
Act.
Attorney General William Smith sent a memo to the
heads of all federal agencies yesterday rescinding a policy
established by the Carter administration's first attorney
general. Griffin Bell.
Four years ago, Bell told agencies not to use technical
exemptions to disclosure in the act and to release re
quested documents unless that would be "demonstrably
harmful" to the government.
In the new policy. Smith reminded agencies that the
guiding principle of the act is to disclose documents but
only "subject to the specific exemptions provided by Con
gress."
Smith also said the Justice Department would develop
proposed amendments to remedy what he said were prob
lems with the act, which he said many people are using in
ways Congress did not intend.
"As a consequence, informants are more reluctant to
share information with enforcement agencies, foreign in
telligence services are more reluctant to share informa
tion with U.S. intelligence agencies, companies are reluc
tant to provide reliable information to the government,"
Smith said.
Syrian missile crisis 'serious 7
Jerusalem— President Ronald Reagan asked Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin yesterday tor more time
to resolve the Syrian missile crisis in Lebanon through dip-

lomatic efforts before Israel intervenes militarily.
Members of the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs and
defense committee, after meeting for three hours with Be
gin in an extraordinary fourth emergency session in a
week, described the situation as "very serious" and
warned that it third-party diplomatic efforts failed, Israel
would have to eliminate the Syrian SAM-6 surface-to-a"ir
missile batterfes by military action.
The missiles were deployed in the strategic Bekaa val
ley east of Beirut last week after Israeli warplanes shot
down two Syrian helicopters that the army command here
said were used to attack Lebanese Christian forces in the
mountains overlooking Zahle.
Since then, the United States and the Soviet Union have
been trying to defuse the crisis through contacts with the
Syrian government, but Israeli officials, including Begin,
have said there has been no significant progress.
Court to rule on illegal aliens
Washington— In a civil rights case of fundamental con
stitutional importance, the Supreme Court agreed yester
day to decide whether the 14th Amendment's guarantee of
the equal protection of the laws applies to illegal aliens.
The justices voted to hear Texas appeal trom a lower
court ruling requiring the state to provide a free public
education to undocumented children, just as the state does
tor citizens and aliens admitted legally to the United

States.
Texas passed a law in 1975 that denied state funds for the
education of the children of illegal aliens. When the Mexi
can-American Legal Defense and Education Fund
challenged the law in court, Texas responded by arguing
that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection sim
ply does not apply to illegal aliens.
In an 1886 case involving Chinese laundry owners in San
Francisco, the Supreme Court held that the 14th Amend
ment's equal-protection clause applies to lawfully ad
mitted aliens just as it does to U.S. citizens The court has
never decided whether or not the same constitutional pro
tection applies to illegal aliens.
