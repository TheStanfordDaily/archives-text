# University tactics seem 'textbook'
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
The University's campaign
strategy — conveying its position to
the clerical workers through the su
pervisors — is typical of tactics often
used by management in trying to de
feat a unionization effort.
The supervisors, as in most union
elections, are the central means by
which the University transmits to the
office workers its opposition to Local
715, the union chapter the clericals
would join should they win Thursday's
election.

News analysis

Each of the six authors of the Uni
versity's election bulletins meets
weekly with small groups of super
visors to pass on information Univer
sity management believes they should
have in order to help the employees
make an informed choice.
However, at least one possible ques
tionable labor practice has become
public — one in which a supervisor
mistakenly told his employees that
they would lose their First Amend
ment rights if they joined the union.
The supervisor made this mistake af
ter a management meeting at which
he was told this "might" be the out
come.
In most anti-union campaigns, it is
typical for the employer to emphasize
aspects of the union's bylaws which
seem to make particularly stringent
demands on the employees, according
to testimony on pressures in the work
place that an AFL-CIO administrator
gave to the House Subcommittee on
Labor-Management Relations.
The testimony was corroborated
with examples of tactics described in
pamphlets distributed by union-bust
ing consultants.
Information detailing problems in
the bylaws is ted to the employees
through the supervisors, the basic
group used by employers because
their direct contact and tamiliarity

with the employees is usually the key
to breaking union influence, the testi
mony says
In weekly meetings, management,
or consultants hired by them for the
purpose, emphasize the importance of
one-on-one individual meetings be
tween supervisors and employees as
the best means of distributing anti
union information, according to the
testimony.
Such information is designed to
identify the problems of the workers
as parallel to those of the employer
and to alienate the workers from the
union, which management portrays as
an outside influence. Usually, super
visors are required to attend the week
ly meetings and must report back to
the management or the consultants.
Stanford has continually affirmed
that there are no outside consultants
helping them combat the union. Their
tactics, however, are similar to those
employed by employers interested in
keeping unions out of their shop.
Priscilla Wheeler, labor specialist
in the University said
the supervisors were the main "com
munication channel to the employ
ees," and there have been weekly
meetings with most of them tor the
past five weeks. The supervisors were
asked, according to Wheeler, to dis
seminate the information and to make
sure the employees received the elec
tion bulletins.
The University furnished the super
visors with copies of the union bylaws,
said Wheeler, and they "emphasized
certain points," such as the right of
the union to "discipline workers" who
joined the union. Wheeler said the
most important points were em
phasized in the election bulletins,
which were thoroughly explained and
expanded upon in the meetings with
supervisors so they could answer em
ployee questions about the bulletins.
Felix Barthelemy, manager of em
ployee relations, said the weekly
meetings did not necessarily have an
anti-union tone, but the discussions
held with the supervisors centered
around "questioning the need for a
union, or this union, for the support
staff."
The meetings, according to
Barthelemy, were designed to inform
the supervisors what they could and
could not do under the rules of the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
and to give them the information
needed to answer employee's ques
tions. Barthelemy said that in the
meetings he conducted, he "en
couraged supervisors to talk to em
ployees, to respond to their ques
tions."
Unlike most anti-union campaigns
in private firms, supervisors here had
the choice whether or not to attend the
meetings and distribute the Univer
sity's information, Wheeler said. Both
Wheeler and Barthelemy said they
had not met with outside consultants
or attended any seminars on how to
keep out unions. Both said they had
read a number of professional jour
nals on the subject, and Barthelemy
called Stanford's anti-union campaign
"an approach that is recommended."
One supervisor, Paul Kim in the Se
rial Records Department, recently
told the employees under him that em
ployees joining the union and taking
the union's loyalty oath automatically
give up their First Amendment rights,
that a union would make job classi
fications "rigid" and that under
unionization he would be forced to ad
minister a test to job applicants and
only consider hiring the top five

finalists.
None of this information is correct,
and since making specific claims
about the results of unionization drive
is against NLRB rules, the University
held a meeting for those employees
who heard Kim in order to correct the
mistakes. A letter from library spe
cialist Adrienne DeAngelis, asking
Barthelemy if the information was ac
curate, in part prompted the meeting.
Kim said the misinformation con
cerning classification and testing
came from a talk he had with another
supervisor concerning union elections
at a New York university. Kim said he
mistakenly believed that the rigidity
andtesting procedure followed at a
state institution would go into effect
here if the unionization drive is suc
cessful.
His mistake concerning First
Amendment rights came from a meet
ing of 10 to 15 supervisors with
Barthelemy, one of the authors of the

election bulletins.
At one meeting, Barthelemy said he
read a union loyalty oath and told the
supervisors present that it "might"
entail loss of First Amendment rights,
and that the issue ot joining the union
and taking the oath were points the su
pervisors should be familiar with, as
there would be employee questions in
this area.
Kim then reported to the employees
in his department that joining the
union would entail loss of their rights.
Barthelemy said although the union's
rules could be interpreted as a curtail
ment of free speech, he was only
trying to emphasize the "impact" a
union might have on employees after
they joined, when they could be
chastised for criticizing the union.
Raising doubts about worker's
rights after they join a union is one of
the typical tactics mentioned in the
congressional testimony.

strategy — conveying its position to
the clerical workers through the su
pervisors — is typical of tactics often
used by management in trying to de
feat a unionization effort.
The supervisors, as in most union
elections, are the central means by
which the University transmits to the
office workers its opposition to Local
715, the union chapter the clericals
would join should they win Thursday's
election.

News analysis

Each of the six authors of the Uni
versity's election bulletins meets
weekly with small groups of super
visors to pass on information Univer
sity management believes they should
have in order to help the employees
make an informed choice.
However, at least one possible ques
tionable labor practice has become
public — one in which a supervisor
mistakenly told his employees that
they would lose their First Amend
ment rights if they joined the union.
The supervisor made this mistake af
ter a management meeting at which
he was told this "might" be the out
come.
In most anti-union campaigns, it is
typical for the employer to emphasize
aspects of the union's bylaws which
seem to make particularly stringent
demands on the employees, according
to testimony on pressures in the work
place that an AFL-CIO administrator
gave to the House Subcommittee on
Labor-Management Relations.
The testimony was corroborated
with examples of tactics described in
pamphlets distributed by union-bust
ing consultants.
Information detailing problems in
the bylaws is ted to the employees
through the supervisors, the basic
group used by employers because
their direct contact and tamiliarity

with the employees is usually the key
to breaking union influence, the testi
mony says
In weekly meetings, management,
or consultants hired by them for the
purpose, emphasize the importance of
one-on-one individual meetings be
tween supervisors and employees as
the best means of distributing anti
union information, according to the
testimony.
Such information is designed to
identify the problems of the workers
as parallel to those of the employer
and to alienate the workers from the
union, which management portrays as
an outside influence. Usually, super
visors are required to attend the week
ly meetings and must report back to
the management or the consultants.
Stanford has continually affirmed
that there are no outside consultants
helping them combat the union. Their
tactics, however, are similar to those
employed by employers interested in
keeping unions out of their shop.
Priscilla Wheeler, labor specialist
in the University said
the supervisors were the main "com
munication channel to the employ
ees," and there have been weekly
meetings with most of them tor the
past five weeks. The supervisors were
asked, according to Wheeler, to dis
seminate the information and to make
sure the employees received the elec
tion bulletins.
The University furnished the super
visors with copies of the union bylaws,
said Wheeler, and they "emphasized
certain points," such as the right of
the union to "discipline workers" who
joined the union. Wheeler said the
most important points were em
phasized in the election bulletins,
which were thoroughly explained and
expanded upon in the meetings with
supervisors so they could answer em
ployee questions about the bulletins.
Felix Barthelemy, manager of em
ployee relations, said the weekly
meetings did not necessarily have an
anti-union tone, but the discussions
held with the supervisors centered
around "questioning the need for a
union, or this union, for the support
staff."
The meetings, according to
Barthelemy, were designed to inform
the supervisors what they could and
could not do under the rules of the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
and to give them the information
needed to answer employee's ques
tions. Barthelemy said that in the
meetings he conducted, he "en
couraged supervisors to talk to em
ployees, to respond to their ques
tions."
Unlike most anti-union campaigns
in private firms, supervisors here had
the choice whether or not to attend the
meetings and distribute the Univer
sity's information, Wheeler said. Both
Wheeler and Barthelemy said they
had not met with outside consultants
or attended any seminars on how to
keep out unions. Both said they had
read a number of professional jour
nals on the subject, and Barthelemy
called Stanford's anti-union campaign
"an approach that is recommended."
One supervisor, Paul Kim in the Se
rial Records Department, recently
told the employees under him that em
ployees joining the union and taking
the union's loyalty oath automatically
give up their First Amendment rights,
that a union would make job classi
fications "rigid" and that under
unionization he would be forced to ad
minister a test to job applicants and
only consider hiring the top five

finalists.
None of this information is correct,
and since making specific claims
about the results of unionization drive
is against NLRB rules, the University
held a meeting for those employees
who heard Kim in order to correct the
mistakes. A letter from library spe
cialist Adrienne DeAngelis, asking
Barthelemy if the information was ac
curate, in part prompted the meeting.
Kim said the misinformation con
cerning classification and testing
came from a talk he had with another
supervisor concerning union elections
at a New York university. Kim said he
mistakenly believed that the rigidity
andtesting procedure followed at a
state institution would go into effect
here if the unionization drive is suc
cessful.
His mistake concerning First
Amendment rights came from a meet
ing of 10 to 15 supervisors with
Barthelemy, one of the authors of the

election bulletins.
At one meeting, Barthelemy said he
read a union loyalty oath and told the
supervisors present that it "might"
entail loss of First Amendment rights,
and that the issue ot joining the union
and taking the oath were points the su
pervisors should be familiar with, as
there would be employee questions in
this area.
Kim then reported to the employees
in his department that joining the
union would entail loss of their rights.
Barthelemy said although the union's
rules could be interpreted as a curtail
ment of free speech, he was only
trying to emphasize the "impact" a
union might have on employees after
they joined, when they could be
chastised for criticizing the union.
Raising doubts about worker's
rights after they join a union is one of
the typical tactics mentioned in the
congressional testimony.
