# University tactics seem 'textbook'
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
The University's campaign
strategy — conveying its position to
the clerical workers through the su
pervisors — is typical of tactics often
used by management in trying to de
feat a unionization effort.
The supervisors, as in most union
elections, are the central means by
which the University transmits to the
office workers its opposition to Local
715, the union chapter the clericals
would join should they win Thursday's
election.

News analysis

Each of the six authors of the Uni
versity's election bulletins meets
weekly with small groups of super
visors to pass on information Univer
sity management believes they should
have in order to help the employees
make an informed choice.
However, at least one possible ques
tionable labor practice has become
public — one in which a supervisor
mistakenly told his employees that
they would lose their First Amend
ment rights if they joined the union.
The supervisor made this mistake af
ter a management meeting at which
he was told this "might" be the out
come.
In most anti-union campaigns, it is
typical for the employer to emphasize
aspects of the union's bylaws which
seem to make particularly stringent
demands on the employees, according
to testimony on pressures in the work
place that an AFL-CIO administrator
gave to the House Subcommittee on
Labor-Management Relations.
The testimony was corroborated
with examples of tactics described in
pamphlets distributed by union-bust
ing consultants.
Information detailing problems in
the bylaws is ted to the employees
through the supervisors, the basic
group used by employers because
their direct contact and tamiliarity

with the employees is usually the key
to breaking union influence, the testi
mony says
In weekly meetings, management,
or consultants hired by them for the
purpose, emphasize the importance of
one-on-one individual meetings be
tween supervisors and employees as
the best means of distributing anti
union information, according to the
testimony.
Such information is designed to
identify the problems of the workers
as parallel to those of the employer
and to alienate the workers from the
union, which management portrays as
an outside influence. Usually, super
visors are required to attend the week
ly meetings and must report back to
the management or the consultants.
Stanford has continually affirmed
that there are no outside consultants
helping them combat the union. Their
tactics, however, are similar to those
employed by employers interested in
keeping unions out of their shop.
Priscilla Wheeler, labor specialist
in the University said
the supervisors were the main "com
munication channel to the employ
ees," and there have been weekly
meetings with most of them tor the
past five weeks. The supervisors were
asked, according to Wheeler, to dis
seminate the information and to make
sure the employees received the elec
tion bulletins.
The University furnished the super
visors with copies of the union bylaws,
said Wheeler, and they "emphasized
certain points," such as the right of
the union to "discipline workers" who
joined the union. Wheeler said the
most important points were em
phasized in the election bulletins,
which were thoroughly explained and
expanded upon in the meetings with
supervisors so they could answer em
ployee questions about the bulletins.
Felix Barthelemy, manager of em
ployee relations, said the weekly
