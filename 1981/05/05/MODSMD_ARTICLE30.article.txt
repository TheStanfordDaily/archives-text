# IRA member Sands dies in protest
##

In fact, there had been sporadic ri
oting on behalf of Sands — as well as
many overtures made by interna
tional agencies on his behalf.
Perhaps the most notable interven
tion was by Pope John Paul 11. who
sent his personal secretary, the Rev.
John Magee, to Belfast. Father Magee
visited the Maze and attempted to con
vince Sands to call off his hunger
striWe.
But Sands remained'adamant and
insisted that he would fast until death.
He also rejected overtures by the
European Commission on Human
Rights, two of whose members came
to Belfast to see him and refused to
push his case, which his sister had
asked to be investigated.
The first official statement on

Sands' death was issued by the
Northern Ireland Office, the British
government's administrative arm
dealing with Ulster. It said:
"Mr. Robert Sands, a prisoner in
the Maze Prison, died today at 1:17
a.m. He took his own life by refusing
food and medical intervention for 66
days."
Those sympathetic to his cause had
seen him as an exemplar of a national
Überation movement against a repres
sive majority.
However, the British government
and the Protestant political leaders in
Ulster claimed that Sands was
basically a criminal who had been con
victed on charges that involved carry
ing arms in order to launch terrorist
attacks against civilian population in
Northern Ireland.

Earlier on. efforts by his family and
friends were suggested as com
promise moves to keep him from
dying, but Sands insisted that he would
not halt his hunger strike until the
British government acceeded to the
"five points" that were the aim of the
prolonged fast.
He went to the Maze Prison in what
was then called the "special category
status" and was released in 1976. Six
months later, he was arrested again
and sentenced to 14 years imprison
ment on possession of arms charges.
However, since the spec; ' category
status had been abolished for incom
ing prisoners, Sands went on the so
called "blanket protest," refusing to
wear prison garb or do any prison
work.
