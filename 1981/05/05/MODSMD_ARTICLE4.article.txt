# Stanford Hotel debated for commission
## 
### Alan Crystal 
Building contractors presented their proposal for
a live-story Stanford Hotel before the Menlo Park
Planning Commission last night and were met most
ly negative reactions trom community residents.
The proposed '80-room hotel, which would occupy
4.7 acres on the east side of El Camino Real along
San Francisquito Creek, would be "an opportunity
for Menlo Park to have a first class lodging facil
ity," said William Crowell, a representative of both
the Flume and Western Lodging corporations which
have been contracted by Stanford to build the hotel
complex.
The hotel, to be privately owned, would generate
about $240,000 in tax revenues for Menlo Park, ac
cording to Crowell. "The facilities are desperately
needed," he asserted, because Menlo Park cannot
accommodate nearly as many guests as can Palo
Alto.
However, community residents, led by former
Menlo Park Mayor James Calloway, protested de
velopment of the hotel.
Downwind
Calloway said he criticizes the plans because they
call for construction of a temporary holding tank to

store sewage during peak treatment hours. "I'm
downwind of the thing, and I'm very much opposed
to it,"he said.
Calloway also voiced concern that the hotel would
be built only 15 feet from the San Francisquito
Creek. "You wouldn't let me build my house that
close," he said.
However, other community residents said they
approved the of project, calling the hotel a positive
development of the land. When Woodside High
School student Chris Karow announced his approval
of the hotel, a number of the 70-person audience ap
plauded. "The hotel is centrally located and doesn't
pose any major traffic problems," Karow said.
Some residents were concerned, however, that
the hotel would add traffic to already congested El
Camino Real. But a report submitted by the En
vironmental Impact Planning Corporation (EIPC)
claimed that the hotel would not make congestion
significantly worse.
Project's impact
Doug Donaldson, a representative of the EIPC,
presented a study of the potential impact which the
business would have on the surrounding area. The

report discussed the effects of the proposed project
on sewage capacity, traffic and vegetation around
the creek. Donaldson also pointed out that the hotel
might be subject to noise pollution from the South
ern Pacific railroad.
Donaldson's said his main reason tor attending
the meeting, though, was to hear opinions from the
public. "My purpose here is to listen," he said.
The meeting was called to hear reactions to
Donaldson's report, according to commission chair
man Ivan Odum. He said Donaldson needed com
munity input before he could submit a final version
of the EIPC report.
Next hearing
The commission voted to continue discussion of
the EIPC report at the next public hearing on May 18
at the Menlo Park Civic Center.
At a future meeting, the commission will decide
whether to approve Stanford's request to develop
the land. The University presented its case before
the commission at an earlier meeting. Even though
the land is owned by Stanford approval is needed for
rezoning before the land can be developed com
mercially.
