# Second dual transplant patient breathing without aid
## 
### James Bouqin 
A team of Medical Center surgeons
performed the second successful
heart-lung transplant in 57 days fol
lowing a 4V2-hour operation last Fri
day on 30-year-old Charles Walker.
Walker has since been "weaned"
oft an artificial respirator and is
breathing on his own. His condition is
officially listed as ' guarded" and his
vital signs remain stable as he con
tinues to make progress. Latest re
ports say Walkc r was able to sit up and
eat breakfast yesterday and is receiv
ing regular visits from his family.
Drs. Bruce Reitz and Norman
Shumway headed the surgical team.
Reitz and Shumway performed the
first heart-lung transplant April 9 on
Arizona newspaper,executive, Mary

Gohlke. She remains in "satisfac
tory" condition currently in the in
tensive care unit. It had been hoped
that she would be able to move into a
general hospital ward by last week.
While Gohlke suffered from
pulminary hypertension, a disease
which destroyed her lungs and severe
ly damaged her heart, Walker was
born with a congenital heart detect,
which caused irreparable damage to
his lungs. He became seriously ill
more than 2Vfe years ago and
has been living in the Stanford area
since April 3 while waiting for his new
heart and lungs, which came from an
anonymous donor.
Complications ahead?
Besides a mild rejection of the new
heart and lungs 10 days after surgery,

Gohlke has not experienced serious
post-operative complications. She is
"just too weak to leave intensive care
yet," according to the Med Center
News Bureau.
Golilke is undergoing physical ther
apy to rebuild her strength and
stamina, but doctors are issuing no
current predictions of a change in her
intensive-care status.
The greatest potential risks for
heart-lung transplant patients are
adequate healing of the windpipe and
the danger of infection. Reitz said that
the absence of these problems for
Gohlke thus far is due to the specific
action of Cyclosporin A, an im
munosuppressant discovered in 1972.
Survival chances
Although 70 percent of heart trans
plant patients now survive the first
year alter surgery, the replacement of
lungs has been, so far. relatively un
successful. In 38 lung transplant at
tempts up to 1977, only two patients
lived longer than three months, and
none survived longer than 10 months
after surgery. Before Gohlke's opera
tion, there were only three attempted
heart-lung transplants, all performed
between 1968 and 1971. None of these
previous patients survived longer than
23 days.
Corticosteroids, administered to
prevent the body 's rejection of new or
gans, have been largely responsible
for the success of heart transplants in
recent years. However, these drugs
hamper the healing process. For lung
transplant patients, the windpipe has
particular difficulty in mending com
pletely, primarily because of its lim

ited blood supply.
Cyclosporin A enables doctors to de
crease the dose of corticosteroids giv
en to a patient, and the new drug ap
parently does not interfere with heal
ing of the windpipe.
It is not known exactly how
Cyclosporin A works, but it seems to
inhibit the action of T-cells, which are
responsible for rejecting foreign tis
sue. However, Cyclosporin A does not
interfere with the immune system re
sponsible for fighting bacteria, which
may cause infection. This is a critical
advantage over the corticosteroids, as
infection has caused a third of all

deaths in heart transplant patients. In
fection is even more common in the
lung cells.
Cyclosporin A, a fungus metabolite
composed of U amino acids in a ring
structure, was discovered by Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals of Basel, Switzer
land. The drug was made available for
clinical trials during the last three
years, and it has been used in kidney,
liver, pancreas and heart transplants.
Along with Reitz, Drs. Nelson
Burton and John Pennock used
Cyclosporin A in preliminary heart
lung transplants on monkeys. Of seven

monkey patients, two are still living â€”
more than 15 months after their opera
tions.
As performed by the Stanford team,
replacement of the heart and lungs in
volves only three major cuts: the
ascending aorta (or main artery), the
right upper chamber of the heart and
the windpipe (or trachea).
Major complications typically oc
cur after surgery. In addition to heal
ing difficulties of the windpipe, the
body's immune system must be sup
pressed enough to avoid rejection of
the new organs, but not so suppressed
that it cannot tight infections
Best drug yet
Although Cyclosporin A is the best
drug yet found for effectively manipu
lating immunosuppression, it is not
without undesirable side effects, such
as malignant lvmphona. a form of
cancer. Other side effects include
mild cases of hair growth on the face
and limbs, tremors and toxicity to the
kidney.
Yet, according to Reitz,
Cyclosporin A may give a patient with
a failing heart and lungs, who other
wise faces a sure and near death, the
possibility of a successful transplant.
Gohlke added, "We would still be in
the trees eating bananas if we didn't
try things. We've got to try, not just sit
on our hands. If I die, I want to leave
my family, my sons the thought that at
least Mom tried."
The middle son of five. Walker grew
up in Newark Valley, New York and
resides in Binghampton. He was ac
companied to Stanford for the opera
tion by his mother. Judy Spangenberg.
