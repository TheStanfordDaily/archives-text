# Campus shoplifters rip- off Store
## 
### Diane Johnson 
A 21-year-old male enters the
Stanford Store, located at the
rear side of Tresidder Union.
The counter clerk notices his
scantly-filled backpack upon en
trance but continues with the
line-up of customers awaiting
her. A tew minutes later, the
clerk eyes the gentleman,
backpack zipped and bursting at
the seams, scurrying out the
door. She closes the register and
rushes to the door, but the shop
lifter is already last away.
This scene is all too common,
according to Greg Larson, as
sistant director of Tresidder
Union. More than $8000 is lost
every three months from the
Store — "An amazing amount to
lose from a place this size," said
Larson. "An acceptable loss
runs about 2.5 percent and the
Store experiences a 13.2 percent
descrepancy between costs and
profit. This means that 13 cents
of every dollar taken in by the
Store goes to cover the costs of
shoplifting."
According to Bruce Coe, as
sistant manager of the Store,
losses amount to over $100 a
day."The biggest problem,"
Coe said, "is that the Store gets
so busy during the afternoons
that it's impossible to watch ev
ery person. The two to four
workers per shift can't possibly
keep an eye on each of the vast
number of people just milling
around."
One of the most common
forms ot shoplifting is com
mitted by people buying candy,
snacks or other small edible
goods. "They eat their goods to
be purchased while standing in
line and 112 inish it before reaching
the cash register. They then
simply throw away the wrapper
or stuff it in a magazine and
walk out the door. Our problem
doesn't stem from professional
thieves. It involves the petty
shoplifters, who don't consider
themselves thieves at all," Coe
said.
Coe said he believes that
shoplifting is a result of general
consumer attitudes. As prices
rise and salaries remain the

same, people justify their steal
ing by saying they're being
"ripped off" by outrageous
prices, according to Coe.
Coe stressed that the Store is
University-run and isn't out to
make a profit by "cheating"
consumers. "Students just don't
realize that shoplifting is taking
money out of their own pockets.
"The losses incurred by the
Store go to cutbacks in other
University events." Larson
pointed out two important con
sequences of Store theft — in
creased Store prices and the
possibility that students will
have to be inconvenienced by
new restrictions. For example,
backpacks may have to be
banned from the Store if the
problem continues at its present
rate, Larson said.
In order to combat the grow
ing problem (the last two inven
tories have showed the worst
losses yet), two University stu
dents have been hired as plain
clothes security guards.
(Their names will be changed
to protect their identities.) Joe
and Ken work daily at irregular
hours, keeping their eye out for
shoplifters. Coe said that ob

servable evidence of theft (such
as empty packages on the
shelves) have been found some
what less frequently during the
six weeks they have worked, but
no definite conclusions may be
drawn until the three-month in
ventory is taken.
The job of the two security
guards involves general store
surveillance, expanding public
and employee awareness of the
problem, and offering possible
re-designing ideas for the store.
"One of the biggest problems
with the Store lies in its layout
... it is very conducive to shop
lifting," Joe said. "The whole
Tresidder building has been re
keyed to prevent theft and now
we're working on similar meas
ures for the Store."
This is the first time security
guards have ever been em
ployed at the Store. Larson ex
plained why he chose students
for the job instead of pro
fessional security personnel.
"We're trying to convert the
majority ot Tresidder jobs over
to student positions. By doing
so, the students obtain an ex
cellent learning experience and
it puts us in more direct contact

with general student needs,"
Larson said.
The two guards had a difficult
time deciding whether or not to
accept the position. "It took us a
week to decide," Ken said. ' The
biggest consideration was
whether or not we could actual
ly walk up and place our friends
under arrest. We finally decided
that it was something which
needed to be done and we would
be the people to do it. We don't
want to bust anybody, but we
feel justified in arresting a
shoplifter to teach him or her a
lesson."
As guards, Joe and Ken have
the right to place all University
student shoplifters and/or those
over 18 under citizen's arrest.
The suspect is then turned over
to the police. "The police have
been extraordinarily helpful in
working with us," Ken said.
"They're as anxious to alleviate
the problem as we are."
Coe stressed the fact that "al
though we're trying new devices
to help combat the problem, it's
a tough one to fight because
shoplifting is such a difficult
thing to detect and prove."

thing to detect and prove."
A 21-year-old male enters the
Stanford Store, located at the
rear side of Tresidder Union.
The counter clerk notices his
scantly-filled backpack upon en
trance but continues with the
line-up of customers awaiting
her. A tew minutes later, the
clerk eyes the gentleman,
backpack zipped and bursting at
the seams, scurrying out the
door. She closes the register and
rushes to the door, but the shop
lifter is already last away.
This scene is all too common,
according to Greg Larson, as
sistant director of Tresidder
Union. More than $8000 is lost
every three months from the
Store — "An amazing amount to
lose from a place this size," said
Larson. "An acceptable loss
runs about 2.5 percent and the
Store experiences a 13.2 percent
descrepancy between costs and
profit. This means that 13 cents
of every dollar taken in by the
Store goes to cover the costs of
shoplifting."
According to Bruce Coe, as
sistant manager of the Store,
losses amount to over $100 a
day."The biggest problem,"
Coe said, "is that the Store gets
so busy during the afternoons
that it's impossible to watch ev
ery person. The two to four
workers per shift can't possibly
keep an eye on each of the vast
number of people just milling
around."
One of the most common
forms ot shoplifting is com
mitted by people buying candy,
snacks or other small edible
goods. "They eat their goods to
be purchased while standing in
line and 112 inish it before reaching
the cash register. They then
simply throw away the wrapper
or stuff it in a magazine and
walk out the door. Our problem
doesn't stem from professional
thieves. It involves the petty
shoplifters, who don't consider
themselves thieves at all," Coe
said.
Coe said he believes that
shoplifting is a result of general
consumer attitudes. As prices
rise and salaries remain the

same, people justify their steal
ing by saying they're being
"ripped off" by outrageous
prices, according to Coe.
Coe stressed that the Store is
University-run and isn't out to
make a profit by "cheating"
consumers. "Students just don't
realize that shoplifting is taking
money out of their own pockets.
"The losses incurred by the
Store go to cutbacks in other
University events." Larson
pointed out two important con
sequences of Store theft — in
creased Store prices and the
possibility that students will
have to be inconvenienced by
new restrictions. For example,
backpacks may have to be
banned from the Store if the
problem continues at its present
rate, Larson said.
In order to combat the grow
ing problem (the last two inven
tories have showed the worst
losses yet), two University stu
dents have been hired as plain
clothes security guards.
(Their names will be changed
to protect their identities.) Joe
and Ken work daily at irregular
hours, keeping their eye out for
shoplifters. Coe said that ob

servable evidence of theft (such
as empty packages on the
shelves) have been found some
what less frequently during the
six weeks they have worked, but
no definite conclusions may be
drawn until the three-month in
ventory is taken.
The job of the two security
guards involves general store
surveillance, expanding public
and employee awareness of the
problem, and offering possible
re-designing ideas for the store.
"One of the biggest problems
with the Store lies in its layout
... it is very conducive to shop
lifting," Joe said. "The whole
Tresidder building has been re
keyed to prevent theft and now
we're working on similar meas
ures for the Store."
This is the first time security
guards have ever been em
ployed at the Store. Larson ex
plained why he chose students
for the job instead of pro
fessional security personnel.
"We're trying to convert the
majority ot Tresidder jobs over
to student positions. By doing
so, the students obtain an ex
cellent learning experience and
it puts us in more direct contact

with general student needs,"
Larson said.
The two guards had a difficult
time deciding whether or not to
accept the position. "It took us a
week to decide," Ken said. ' The
biggest consideration was
whether or not we could actual
ly walk up and place our friends
under arrest. We finally decided
that it was something which
needed to be done and we would
be the people to do it. We don't
want to bust anybody, but we
feel justified in arresting a
shoplifter to teach him or her a
lesson."
As guards, Joe and Ken have
the right to place all University
student shoplifters and/or those
over 18 under citizen's arrest.
The suspect is then turned over
to the police. "The police have
been extraordinarily helpful in
working with us," Ken said.
"They're as anxious to alleviate
the problem as we are."
Coe stressed the fact that "al
though we're trying new devices
to help combat the problem, it's
a tough one to fight because
shoplifting is such a difficult
