# Sands' death arouses violent reactions
## 
### Associated Press 
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The
body of hunger striker Bobby Sands
was carried home from the Maze Pris
on yesterday in a black hearse that
moved slowly through the riot-torn
streets of Belfast's Roman Catholic
strongholds. Grieving residents
draped black flags from their windows
to mourn the latest IRA martyr:
Thousands of neighbors and sup
porters tiled past the open coffin last
night. A man standing guard outside
the Sands home said, "He looks like an
infant, very small and very frail. It's
really heartbreaking. .
Firebomb-hurling rioters clashed
with British troops and police in the
worst riots in the last two weeks of
trouble surrounding Sands' hunger
strike for prisoners' rights. At least 22
people were injured, three critically.
Belfast police said one officer was
hit in the shoulder in a volley of high
velocity bullets fired at a police vehi
cle in a Catholic district of West Bel
fast. where an army patrol also was
also tired on.
In County Tyrone, a supermarket
was bombed in Cabra, vehicles were
hijacked and set ablaze in nearby
Dungannon and police and rioters
fought with firebombs and crowd-dis
persing plastic bullets in Coalisland.

A quiet rally by about 1000 Sands
supporters in Dublin, capital of the
neighboring Irish republic, ended with
youths breaking away to set cars on
tire and smash shoptronts in Grafton
Street, a luxury shopping area. Rocks
were thrown at the exclusive Royal
Hibernian Hotel.
But the level of violence fell short of
that predicted by those who said
Sands' death would bring on civil war.
At midnight the Royal Ulster Con
stabulary said, "Things have now qui
eted down."
The body was taken from the prison
hospital by authorities shortly after
his death early yesterday, the 66th day
ot his fast demanding political status
for IRA prisoners. After an autopsy
was performed, it was released to
Sands' family in the early afternoon.
From the prison, the hearse made
its slow, 12-mile journey to Sands'
family home in Belfast's Twinbrook
district to await an IRA burial tomor
row with full military honors — as the
IRA guerrilla had requested.
Pallbearers, including Sands'
father and brother, draped the wooden
coffin with the Irish flag of green, or
ange and white before carrying it in
side. Black flags flew from windows
throughout the neighborhood.
Seventy more ot the 440 convicted

Irish Republican Army prisoners at
the prison threatened to join three of
Sands' surviving comrades — one of
them reported witlyn days of death —
in a hunger strike.
In London, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher declared Britain
would njever grant political status to
the IRA prisoners, "no matter how
much hunger strike there may be."
"Mr. Sands was a convicted crimi
nal. He chose to take his own life. It
was a chdice his organization did not
allow any of their victims," she told a
somber House of Commons. Sands
was elected to the British Parlian. '
on April 9 during his hunger strike.
Sands, 27, is the newest martyr to
the cause ot the IRA and its supporters
— unification of the Protestant-domi
nated British province of Northern
Ireland with the predominantly Catho
lic Irish Republic. His death touched
off a wave of rioting, hijacking and
burning in Roman Catholic areas of
Belfast and Londonderry.
He died in support of demands that

convicted Irish nationalist guerrillas
wear their own clothes, do no prison
work and freely associate — widely re
garded as amounting to political sta
tus.
Disturbances eased in mid-after
noon, but tension was high despite dra
matic appeals for calm from Catholic
and Protestant church leaders, Brit
ish officials and Sands' family. Secur
ity forces prepared for more violence.
Cardinal Tomas O'Fiaich, Catholic
Primate of All Ireland, appealed to
the surviving hunger strikers to call
off their fast and to Britain "to aban
don its inflexible attitude regarding
prison dress and work."
Archbishop John Armstrong, head
of the Protestant church throughout
Ireland, said: "Carry on your normal
lives as best you can and pray, pray as
never before for mercy and truth,
righteousness and peace."
Armstrong described the circum
stances ot Sands' last as "one of the
most catalogued pieces ot moral
blackmail in recent times."
