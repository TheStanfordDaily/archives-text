What do Sandra Dee. Danny
Zuko, Frenchy, Marty, summer
nights, Branner Hall, free ad
mission and May 7, 8 and 9 at 8
p.m. have in common? That's
right, Grease Anne Palmer will
star as Sandra Dee Dumbrowski
and Chris Hamilton will play
Danny Zuko when Grease opens
this weekend in the Branner
Dining Hall
The all-freshman musical is
directed by John McDonough,
director ot one of the Winter
One Acts this year. "It will be
an excellent show,"
McDonough said, "because it
will entertain the audience. It's
not a dramatic tour-de-force,
it's a musical comedy. It's an
entertainment piece, and we
want people to leave the show
saying, 'Wow, I was enter
tained!' "
Grease was first suggested as
the dorm play by cast member
David Schmelzer, and it was
chosen for it's familiarity and
popularity. The play is similar
to the movie, except tor a tew
musical numbers and scenes.
Directing Grease is very dif
ferent from directing a regular
play, according to McDonough,
because a musical involves the
coordination of acting, singing,
dancing, the band and the tech
nical crew.
Producer Ellen Germain,
who was instrumental in or
ganizing the show, is impressed
by the show's progress. "I think
these talented people are doing
a wonderful job, and are putting
in an extraordinary amount of
time and effort to make the
show work."
Choreographers Linda John
son and Jennifer Carrell are
also optimistic about the play's
success. "The show is full of

energy, and the characters suit
their parts very well," Johnson
said. One of the problems the
choreographers had to over
come. Carrell said, was the lim
ited space they had with which
to work.
"Getting everyone in one of
the more elaborate dance num
bers coordinated in the contines
of the dining hall was not an
easy task, but everyone's re
sponded very well," Carrell
said.
Vocal Director Jennifer
Morgenthaler feels that Grease
is a special production because
Branner Hall is "the largest
conglomeration of treshmen on
campus. It might be an in
dicator ot Stanford's dramatic
future."
McDonough added that the
"talent in this dorm is
phenojnenal, and the level of
emotions is unbelievable." A lot
of talent "came out of the wood
work," according to
McDonough, "and they've been
just tremendous."
Many cast members had nev
er been in a production before,
and this added difficulty to the
production staffs job — but af
ter a few months of rehearsal,
the production staff agreed it
has paid off.
Casting is an important part
of any show, and the Bran
nerites picked fit their parts
very well, according to
McDonough. "We looked at
their singing, dancing and act
ing, and our choices have
worked out very well."
On New York's Broadway,
Grease was the longest running
show. Though Branner's pro
duction may not be as ex
travagant, according to
McDonough, "it certainly is en
tertaining."
