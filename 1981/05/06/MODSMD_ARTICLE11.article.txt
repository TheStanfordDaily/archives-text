## Clericals: Vote tomorrow 
### 
Tomorrow, clerical workers and
library support staff at the Univer
sity will decide whether to be rep
resented in a union.
Debate about the issue has in
tensified in recent weeks. The Uni
versity administration and the Of
fice Staff Organizing Committee
have disagreed about the benefits
that clerical employees could gain
by joining United Stanford Em
ployees, Local 715 of the Service
Employees International Union.
Charges and counter-charges have
been leveled, and tacts have been
argued about clerical unions across
the country.
Now, some 1800 workers here
must weigh all the claims, and
each must make his or her own de
cision.
All eligible voters should keep in
mind that the result of the vote will
be binding, no matter how tew or
how many go to the polls.
Moreover, the vote will have a pro
found impact on the state of man
agement-employee relations
within the University for many

years to come.
Employees must now decide for
themselves, based on all the evi
dence presented to them in the
weeks and months before the elec
tion, whether the proposed
bargaining unit is likely to improve
job satisfaction, working condi
tions and their pay, and whether it
is likely to bring them more dignity
in the working place.
Regardless of the results, a
strong turnout will provide solid
evidence that clericals and others
voting have thought about their
jobs here and have made an active
decision about the course ot their
relations with the University — and
that they care enough to express
their views.
The credibility of the election
will increase in proportion to the
turnout. We urge all clerical work
ers and library support staff to vote
at one of the three polling places —
in Memorial Auditorium, at the
Medical Center, or at SLAC. Polls
will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
