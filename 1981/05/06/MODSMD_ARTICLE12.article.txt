Watt criticized
Tom Friedberg's support ot
Interior Secretary James Watt
(Daily, Apr. 29) is based upon vi
olently militaristic arguments.
Friedberg's basic thesis is that
it the United States cannot supp
ly itselt with sufficient petrole
um and mineral resources, then
we shall be forced into extorting
or stealing them from foreign
countries. He demands of en
vironmentalists a "blood tax"
as the price tor ill-defined and
dubious "economic benefits." It
appears that in Friedberg's
mind, killing for Exxon is re
quired for appreciation of the
natural world. Should combat
medals replace the Golden
Eagle as a way to gain ad
mission to National Parks?
Friedberg's writing betrays a
willingness to do violence to
both to the environment and hu

man beings, the latter through
proxy, ot course; he calls
himself "a peace-loving mem
ber ot this society.'' The essence
of the environmentalist view
point, in stark contrast, is non
violent. man is properly seen as
part of a living community and
conducts himself within the
bounds imposed by that com
munity.
One of those bounds is the
tiniteness of mineral resources.
Extracting whatever we can as
quickly as possible, as Fried
berg and Watt would appear to
be urging, does not change this
reality. The only rational long
term solution is conservation
and resource recycling.
Friedberg asserts that en
vironmentalists have pro
mulgated "domestic economic
imperialism." with the result
that ". . those in the areas af
fected by. . environmental-ec

onomic decisions cannot pick up
and go. . ." There is economic
imperialism, both domestic and
international, but not through
the complicity of the
"backpackers ot the Sierra
Club"he attacks.
This imperialism is the prod
uct of corporations which arbi
trarily close tactories, throwing
thousands out ot work; of min
ing companies which strip the
land for its mineral wealth, yet
disdain reclamation efforts; of
the nuclear industry and gov
ernment, which poison our en
vironment, yet maintain there
are no health hazards. This na
tion will never rise out of its
quagmire of environmental des
ecration until Friedberg, Watt
and other pseudo-patriots rec
ognize that the value of life ex
ceeds that of the dollar.
