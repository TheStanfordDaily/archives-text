## Atmosphere fosters racial violence 
### 
A worsening economic crisis
coupled with the display of in
sensitivity to the needs of poor
minorities by public officials
are two factors lending to a na
tional atmosphere conducive to
the increase in racial violence
occurring in every region of the
United States.
An overwhelming majority ot
this violence is being directed
toward the nation's black popu
lation. Six blacks have been
murdered in the Buffalo area in
a three month period. Four
were shot with the same .22
caliber gun. apparently by the
same white man. Two others
were stabbed and had their
hearts removed. Five black
youths from Newark, New Jer
sey are missing. A young black
was lynched in Mobile, Ala
bama. Two bHck joggers were
gunned down by a white sniper
who claimed to be outraged that
they were jogging with white
women. A 34-year-old white res
ident of Pinole, California
strangled a five-year-old black
boy because she abhored blacks.
Perhaps the most horrendous ot
these attacks on blacks is the
slaying ot 26 black youths in At
lanta.
Racial violence of this sort is
not a new phenomenon in Amer
ican society. Blacks have been
the subject ot racial violence
since the first slave was brought
to this nation from Africa. Many
were killed and thrown over
board on their journey to Ameri
ca. Thousands of slaves died as
a result of brutal beatings by
their overseers. Many died from
lack of nutritional and medical
care.
Lynchings of black slaves and
freedmen were rampant. The
recent lynching in Alabama in
dicates it is still seen as a viable
means of racial genocide.
Surely America has not for
gotten the history of atrocious
acts ot violence directed at the
nation's black population. It
must be kept in perspective that
the acts of violence in Buffalo
and Atlanta are only vestiges of
attitudes that have always ex
isted. Blacks remain
scapegoats for those who think
high taxes supposedly spent on
social programs designed to
support the "poor and lazy nig
ger" cause U.S. problems
Gose observers of national
policy trends know that the gov
ernment revenues finance the
insatiable military budget sup
porting U.S. capitalist im
perialist endeavors and that so
called compensatory programs

are a thing of the past. Such a
display of insensitivity toward
the nation's blacks by public of
ficials justifies, in the minds of
those harboring latent racial
prejudices, their own display of
hatred manifested by em
ployment and housing dis
crimination and acts of vio
lence.
The killing of 26 black youths
over a two-year period in Atlan
ta and the deficient investiga
tion into those deaths epitomize
the national insensitivity and
racism directed towards black
Americans. The Atlanta police
department, only at the behest
of the black community and af
ter seven children had been
slain, established a special task
force to investigate the
murders. To this date they have
been unable to solve the
murders or gather any signifi
cant leads. Meanwhile the
murders occur more
frequently.
President Ronald Reagan re
fuses to heed the plea of the At

lanta city government to grant
federal aid to step up the in
vestigation. City resources are
being depleted rapidly. The
city refuses help from certain
outside concerned groups with
investigative expertise. The na
tions press insists that a major
cause for these slayings are to
be attributed to the lifestyles of
the youth. They refuse to recog
nize the racist, violence-ori
ented nature of American socie
ty as the sole cause of the deaths
in Atlanta.
Atlanta weeps for its youth.
Two Atlanta mothers are living
in constant fear that their miss
ing children will join the list of
the 26 already murdered. The
children, faced with the pros
pect of being the next victim of
the murderer they now refer to
as "The Man," are experiencing
psychological trauma.
Blacks in Atlanta and
throughout the nation have been
holding demonstrations in sym
pathy with the families of the

children. The Stanford Black
American Law Student's As
sociation, in conjunction with
the Black Student Union, will
hold a forum on Thursday at
noon in Tresidder room 271 in
support ot the Atlanta com
munity and those struggling
against racial violence the
world over. The forum will cul
minate the sale of green ribbons
which represent positive life
forces struggling against racial
violence committed by individ
uals, groups, institutions and
nations. The proceeds of the rib
bon sale will go to several Atlan
ta-based organizations attempt
ing to bring an end to the ongo
ing tragedy.
