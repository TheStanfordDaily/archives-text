## President only represents administration 
### 
During an April meeting of
the Faculty Senate, Professor
Bernard Roth commented on
clerical unionization at Stan
ford. He pointedly told Presi
dent Donald Kennedy that no
University-wide consensus ex
ists on the issue. For the presi
dent to claim he represents the
faculty, students and particu
larly the staff is misleading and
incorrect, said Roth. We whole
heartedly concur.
At stake in the clerical elec
tion tomorrow is not the health
of the University as defined by
its chief administrator. The is

sue is rather how the clericals
and library support staff can
most effectively pursue their in
terests with the administration.
Kennedy, in letters to the of
fice staff and during a recent in
terview, has spoken of the needs
of the University as a whole.
This notion, however, denies the
different interests and per
spectives which distinguish fac
ulty, students, and staff from
the administration.
Furthermore, Kennedy's con
cept of the University reveals a
more subtle image of worker
management relations: for
him, they have a paternal char
acter. Instead of describing a
community with distinct kinds
of members, the term "univer
sity" lumps people into a happy
mass of folks, under the care of
Dad Kennedy and our Dean un
cles. Unionization drives often
threaten this kind of paternal
environment which many man
agers seek to create.
In fact, as Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC) or
ganizer Joyce Tipps-Coats
points out, clericals do not need
to be taken care of. Office and li
brary staffers have their own
needs, financial and otherwise,
which distinguish them from
other members of the Univer
sity. At the same time, clericals
have the ability and collective
strength to disregard anyone's
attempt to "protect" them. A
union would be the office staf
fers' own organization helping
them to define and pursue their
own interests.
Without a union, office staff
workers have no such organiza

tion. Unlike the faculty who
may belong to a union and who
elect a representative body, or
the maintenance employees
who have a union, or even stu
dents who choose represent
atives to the ASSU, the clericals
have no one who represents
them. Each individual office
and library worker must nego
tiate with the administration
alone and without peer support.
Not only do office staffers
lack an organization to repre
sent them; they are fundamen
tally subordinate to the man
agers who control their jobs.
The University, as employer,
expects clericals to contribute
to the production needs of the in
stitution. Office workers fulfill
their role by being efficient em
ployees. Yet that role is com
pletely defined by the employer.
Those who hire and fire de
termine not only the wage but
also the duties of the work rou
tine and the character of the
work experience.
The administration's use of
its own grievance procedure for
clericals reflects the illusion of
representation which office
workers experience. This il
lusion is a contradiction in two
ways.
First, the administration's
primary function is to represent
the needs and interests of the
Board of Trustees. The Univ.
president, Kennedy, must as
sure that the University re
mains an efficient and financial
ly secure institution. Like
shareholders, the trustees ex
pect their institution to prosper
and enlarge its capabilities.

Stanford's president and his ad
ministrators interact with em
ployees, faculty, and students
with this goal in mind. Given
this perspective, it is clear that
the administration cannot hon
estly represent the interests of
the office staff.
A second contradiction exists
within the grievance process
itself: those employers whose
actions stimulate the grievance
are of the same constituency
who determine the merits of the
grievance. Not only does the ad
ministration represent itself, it
attempts to act on behalf of the
clericals who complain about its
actions and policies. The frank
paternalism and strong con
tradiction of the grievance pro
cedure exemplified the ine
quality of power which office
workers currently experience.
We see Stanford as an institu
tion dedicated to the education
ot young people and to the re
search of problems. Yet under
neath this legitimate com
monality of interest which fac
ulty, students and staff share
with the administration, a dis
parity ot power and purpose sep
arates the managers from the
managed. As students we use
the organizations designated by
us to act on our behalf. Tomor
row we encourage office staff
workers to take this opportunity
to assert their interests and es
tablish an organization on their
own behalf.
