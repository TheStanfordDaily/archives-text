## Philippine group opposes intervention 
### 
More than a hundred people
gathered at the International
Center Apr. 25 to celebrate an
evening in solidarity with the
Filipino people. "Bangon," a
Filipino word meaning arise,
was the title of the event. It in
cluded a slide presentation, pop
ular songs of the national-demo
cratic opposition in the Philip
pines, and a talk by Prof.
Walden Bello, a Filipino soci
ologist at U.C.-Berkeley.
The slide show addressed the
historical and economic trans
formation of the Philippines in
the past century. It was a lively
and varied collection of slides of
the countryside, urban slums,
expensive villas, historical
paintings and documents, stu
dent and popular demonstra
tions, and guerrillas fighting in
the countryside. It also included
pictures of the American mili
tary bases and the branches of
American multinational corpo
rations in the Philippines.
The American involvement in
the Philippines began when the
U.S. took the Philippines from
Spain in ' 898 as a consequence of
the Spanish-American War. The
struggle ot the Fillipino people
against the Spanish colonialists
then turned against the new
American colonizers. The U.S.
directly ruled the Philippines
for the first half of the 20th cen
tury.
Since the Philippines was
granted independence in 1946,
the U.S. has been the domi
nating foreign power in its in
ternal affairs. The U.S. military

bases in the Philippines serve as
outposts in Asia that could be
used in military adventures in
Southeast Asia, East Africa, or
the Middle East. The U.S. multi
national corporations dominate
the Philippine economy by their
direct investment in cash crops
and export-oriented manufac
turing industries.
The slide show also discussed
the ways in which martial law
has affected the lives of the
Filipino people. President
Ferdinand Marcos disbanded
the elected Congress and de
clared martial law in 1972. The
Filipino people have been suf
fering from the lack of political
freedom, suspension of civil lib
erties, and systematic violation
of the most basic human rights.
This atmosphere of repression
has alienated most segments ot
the Filipino society, including
some of the liberal elite. Income
inequality has widened, and
malnutrition and disease are
widespread in the poor areas.
Lacking in popular support
and facing continued na
tionalist-democratic opposition
and worsening economic condi
tions, the Marcos dictatorship is
finding itself increasingly de
pendent on the military and eco
nomic aid of the U.S. govern
ment. The U.S. government is
currently giving the Marcos re
gime $100 million in annual aid
in return tor the use ot military
bases in the Philippines. The
World Bank and the IMF are
also increasingly involved in
helping the Marcos government

in its economic programs. The
country's debt currently ex
ceeds $12 billion.
Bello linked the Philippine
struggle for democracy and in
dependence to the struggle ot
peoples in Central America,
Africa, Asia, and the Middle
East. In particular, the struggle
of the Filipino people is similar
to that of the Salvadorean peo
ple in fighting domestic dic
tatorship and U.S. domination.
Bello stated that the Reagan
foreign policy of supporting
"moderately repressive" re
gimes was counter to the in
terest of both the American peo
ple and the peoples of the Third
World.
"Bangon" was organized by
the South Bay chapter ot the

Philippine Solidarity Network
(PSN). The purpose of the PSN
is to oppose any form of domi
nation and intervention by the
U.S. in the Philippines. It par
ticularly opposes the U.S. mili
tary and economic aid to the
Marcos dictatorship and the
presence of U.S. bases in the
Philippines. The PSN supports
the struggle of the Filipino peo
ple for economic freedom and
political democracy. The PSN is
currently conducting educa
tional work in different com
munities and is willing to show
the slide presentation to in
terested groups. The PSN local
chapter is located in the ASSU
Office.
