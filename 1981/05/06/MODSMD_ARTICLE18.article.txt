## Administration suggests financial incentives to help desegregation 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Reagan
administration, taking its first
school desegregation action,
proposed Monday to give tui
tion-free college educations to
public school students who vol
untarily transfer between
schools to advance desegrea
tion.
Attorney General William
Smith, who announced the plan
here, said it was presented to
U.S. District Judge William
Hungate, who has asked for vol
untary plans to desegregate in
ner-city and suburban schools in
the St. Louis area.
Under the financial incentive
part of the plan, a half year of
tuition-free education at any
Missouri state institution of
higher education would oe given
for each year completed in the
school integration program.
Recipients would be white
students in suburban districts
who agree to attend pre
dominantly black schools in St.
Louis and black city students

who agree to attend white sub
urban schools.
The plan is significant be
cause it indicates the kinds of
steps the Reagan adminis
tration hopes to implement as a
substitute for mandatory school
busing, which the adminis
tration opposes.
State to pay costs
All costs of the plan would be
borne by the state rather than
local school districts, the De
partment of Justice said. An
nual costs, including transpor
tation, were estimated at about
$6 million.
There was no indication in
Smith's announcement that the
state of Missouri had agreed to
spread the costs among all of its
taxpayers.
The financial incentive por
tion of the plan was devised by
Justice Dept. attorneys, but
Smith said the overall plan
"was prepared by local author
ities in full cooperation with the
department."
Smith said the plan "is de

signed to lead to an educational
ly sound and relatively ex
peditious means of promoting
racial desegregation of the pub
lic schools throughout the St.
Louis metropolitan area.
Alternative to busing?
In an apparent reference to
busing, Smith said the plan "is
designed and intended to ob
viate the necessity of any inter
district 'mandatory' phase of
this case. It will work, and work
now, given the active support
and cooperation of the school
districts of the St. Louis metro
politan area."
The plan also proposes estab
lishing four additional "magnet
schools" in the city to attract
city and country students want
ing to participate in a special
ized instruction program.
The St. Louis desegregation
case began in 1972 when black
parents filed suit alleging il
legal segregation. St. Louis city
schools began court-ordered de

segregation last September that
included busing and magnet
schools. The school board has
contended that the solution
should cross district lines be
tween the black inner-city
schools and the outlying white
suburban schools.
St. Louis city schools have
about 63,000 students, ot whom
78.5 percent are black. The 23
suburban districts have a com
bined enrollment ot about
150,000 students, of whom 20
percent are black.
"No student would be re
quired to attend any school but
that to which he or she would
normally be assigned," Smith
said. "Every decision concern
ing the choice of schools and dis
tricts other than students' home
schools and districts would be
made by students and their pa
rents."
