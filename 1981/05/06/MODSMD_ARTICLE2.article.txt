# University, union fight over misinformation

### Neil MacFarquhar 
The skirmishes between the Univer
sity and the union continue as each ac
cuses the other of deliberately mis
leading Stanford's clerical workers.
The broadsheet printed by the Uni
versity claimed that Local 715 was
misleading the staff workers here in
promising them "almost anything to
win votes."
"We never promised anything,"
said Terri Owen, spokesperson for the
Office Staff Organizing Committee
(OSOC). The information in the news
letter was "not promises, but a laun
dry list of contract ideas that people
might want to think about: it was a
summary of items that are found in
contracts," she said.
Joyce Tipps-Coats, chief organizer
and spokesperson for OSOC, called the
broadsheet an attempt "to discredit
the union as a whole."
Susan Eaton, the research special
ist for the Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) who excerpted
the information, said she "was not
trying to quote exact contract lan
guage," but that it may sound like it
because some was used. In all, the
University pointed out ten examples
of what they believe to be "misleading
or totally false" information.
The main arguments seem to be
over semantics. Examples:
— The newsletter says "seniority
and sometimes health coverage car be
maintained in some instances during
leaves."
The University says: "only it the
employee pays 100 % of the cost."
The Boston University contract
says health coverage will be main
tained for the employee without
charge tor absences of less than two
weeks, but for absences of more than
two weeks the employee "pays the to
tal monthly cost ot the coverage."
— The newsletter says: after a
grievance over sexual harassment,
"the employee has the right to
transfer without loss of pay or senior

ity if he/she feels uncomfortable after
the grievance has been processed."
The University says: "There is no
such guaranteed right to transfer at
either Brandeis or Boston."
The Boston contract states: "If af
ter the grievance is resolved in favor
of the employee the employee feels un
able to return to his/her job, the em
ployee shall be entitled to transfer to
an equivalent position at the same
salary and grade if a vacancy then ex
ists for which he/she is qualified."
— The newsletter states: "The Uni
versity agrees to fill vacancies within
30 days, avoiding heavy workloads on
the other employees."
The University says: "No such pro
vision appears in any S.E.I.U. con
tract at Brandeis or Boston."
The Boston contract states: "The
University will make every effort to
fill posted vacant postions within a
reasonable amount of time. If a vacan
cy is not filled within thfrty (30) days,
the Union, upon its request, shall be in
formed as the the reasons."
In each case neither the claims of
the University nor the union match ex
actly what is stated in the contract;
each side is emphasizing what they
view as important.
"The University has taken advan
tage of a problem in semantics to imp
ly that we are lying,"said Owen.
"Some of things concerned the
semantics, but there were some that
were quite misleading,"said Priscilla
Wheeler, from the University Legal
Office. It is not semantics to leave off
important qualifiers, she said.
The implication made by the Uni
versity is that we "have to lie about
contract points because they don't ex
ist in reality," said Owen.
Wheeler said the point of the broad
sheet was not to attack the credibility
of the union but to show that "Local
715 is anxious to represent the 1800 em
ployees here, anxious enough that they
would be misleading."
