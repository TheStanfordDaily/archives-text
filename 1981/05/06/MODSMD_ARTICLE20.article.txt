# Fed Board raises lending rate, questions Reagan budget cuts
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board,
acting to slow the growth ot the money supply
and of credit as part of its battle against infla
tion, raised its basic lending rate Monday to a
record-high 14 percent.
It also increased from 16 percent to 18 per
cent the interest rate it charges big banks that
borrow frequently, raising a special surcharge
from 3 percentage points to 4.
"These actions, effective Tuesday, were
taken in light of current levels in short-term
market interest rates and the need to maintain
restraint in the monetary and credit ag
gregates," the Federal Reserve sijid in a
statement.
First increase since December
It was the first increase in the discount rate,
a major benchmark for interest charges, since
last Dec. 5, when it was raised to 13 percent.
Also, according to Federal Reserve Gov.
Lyle Gramley, The Federal Reserve Board
prefers a smaller tax cut and a lower deficit
than President Ronald Reagan has recom
mended.
Gramley also said Reagan's program of
spending and tax cuts would add $25 billion ot
stimulus to the economy in the next fiscal year,
adding to inflationary pressures in a "wor
risome" way.
He spoke on the eve of a major showdown in
the House between a Reagan-backed plan and a
Democratic alternative that provides for a

smaller tax cut and also a lower deficit than
the president has projected.
While he said he could not formally speak for
the seven-member board, he could provide the
outlook from "20th Street and Constitution Av
enue," the address of the Federal Reserve
Building.
Chairman Paul Volcker has hinted in con
gressional testimony and interviews that he
would prefer a smaller tax cut and Volcker has
advocated even larger spending cuts than Rea
gan proposed.
Outspoken viewpoint
But Gramley was more outspoken, saying:
"We would prefer to see a smaller tax reduc
tion and delayed tax reduction or one that is
made conditional on economic conditions down
the road. . . the first priority should be a lower
deficit."
Reagan has proposed a three-year tax cut ot
nearly 30 percent, or 0 percent cuts in each of
the next three years in marginal tax rates. It
would cost an estimated $54 billion in the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1, accounting for all ot the
$45 billion deficit Reagan envisions.
The House Budget Committee has approved
a Democratic alternative plan that would cut
taxes by $38 billion in the next fiscal year and
project a deficit ot $25.6 billion. The House is
expected to vote on the rival measures Tues
day.
