# ASU leads, Cards fifth in Pac-10 golf
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
Monday was the dream,
1 uesday the nightmare, as
the Stanford men's golf team
went a full circle, concluding
the third round of the Pacif
ic- 0 championships yester
day afternoon with 125
strokes, giving Arizona State
a 16 stroke lead in first place.
The Cardinals had slipped
from third to fifth place, and
everyone sighed with some
thing like relief because it
was, after all, inevitable.
It seems that a Cardinal
named David Games, a dark
horse to everyone but Stan
ford coach David Yates, was
winning the tournament at
the end of Monday's play. He
had put together a pair of
back-to-back rounds of 68 in
the finest 36 holes of golf any
Cardinal has seen in the sea
son thus far, maybe in many
seasons. And maybe the
strain from hoping so hard
was starting to show, be
cause he went out Tuesday
and shot 78.
ASU had the lead with 729
after 36 holes Monday after
noon, but Junior Games was,
unbelievably, the individual
leader in the clubhouse. Stan
ford was 14 strokes back, not
all that much in team golf,
and only two strokes out of
second place, which Oregon
held on to with 741.
Stanford alumni were
scattered along the course in
fold-up chairs and Vuarnets.
They were smiling and re
calling that joyful time when
golf was a game to watch
around these parts, thinking
that just maybe this kid
Games could bring bring it
all back, and which Stanford
great he reminded them of.
A couple of holes were dif

terent, but other than that it
could have been 1942, and it
would have been a guy
named Frank Tatum Jr. in
the limelight instead of
Games, the one who went on
to win the NCAA Cham
pionship that year, and to
head the U.S.Golf Associa
tion much later. Tatum was
the only Cardinal goiter to
win individual honors,

though they have won six
team championships
It was all so nice. But the
only thing needed to com
plete the overwhelming
sense of foreboding was a
shadow spreading slowly
over the course.
Yesterday was, as Yates
kept repeating, "a tough day
for all of us, just a tough

day. Neil Robinson posted
the low score tor the
Cardinals, a one-over-par 72

shooting 79 in his third round.

Tim Robinson, everyone's
favorite to shoot the low
Stanford rounds, was tied for
sth after 36 holes with a total
of 147 He shot a six-over-par
77 yesterday afternoon
amidst the deluge of
Cardinal bogies, to drop to
9th.
"We were very confident
off the first tee. through sev
en or eight holes." Yates
said, describing the
Cardinals' collapse. "Then
we had a couple of bad holes,
and lost it. The round just got
away from us. We've ueen
doing it all year, and I don't
know what it is, maybe a lack
of mental toughness. But no
body gave up. everybody was
trying until their last putt."
As for Games, trouble
with his putting gradually
wore away at his lead. Usual
ly one of the more composed
members of the team, he
couldn't seem to recover,
and began "spinning his
wheels," according to Yates.
"When you play as well as he
did Monday you have a ten
dency to let one or two
strokes seem like a lot." he
said. "He struggled with his
putter, then started to press
it. You can hit one bad shot,
and all that confidence you
built up shatters," he said.
ASU is virtually un
assailable in first place, but
second is not out of the
Cardinals' reach; they would
have to combine for 350.
More likely, they will tinsh
the round with 380, possibly
good enough for third place,
but in which case they would
have to overcome Oregon
(1110), and USC (1118), the
two teams now holding those
positions.
