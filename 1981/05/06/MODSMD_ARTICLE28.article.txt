## 
### Karen Springen 
The Mendicants, the Claude Monet band, street
theater and an open house buffet helped celebrate
the first anniversary of the student-run Coftee
House last Friday.
Coftee House, Inc., ASSU's subsidiary organiza
tion which won the bid for the operation of the Tres
idder eatery, took control last May '. According to
COP member Dick Butterfield, president of the Cot
tee House board of directors, efforts this past year
have included lowering prices, offering more stu
dent entertainment and providing a new, lighter de
cor.
History
In July, 1979, TDS, the company contracted in 973
to run the business, fired the entire staff. Employees
picketed, organized a boycott of the establishment
and opened the temporary "True Coffee House Al
ternative."
That same month, the True Coftee House filed a
charge with the National Labor Relations Board
.(NLRB) to protest the discharge of 36 employees
without notice. Employees interpreted the firings as
an attempt to keep them from joining or forming a
labor organization.
The act led to a settlement in January 1980 be

tween Guckenheimer Enterprises, ihe operator ot
the Cotfee House, and the fired employees. Settle
ment included a $15,32 cash compensation to the
employees. STARTS mediated between the parties.
The student-run Coffee House began four months
later under a new manager, Steve Weiss, who had
extensive food service experience with several Uni
versity of Wisconsin eateries.
Graduate student Doug Arnstein of STARTS said
that student operation of programming and business
organization gives the Cotfee House a "closer link to
the people it is supposed to serve."
According to senior Derek Proudian, program co
ordinator, a group which includes publicity chair
man Todd Harris and Weiss meets each week.
Celebration
Proudian said the idea for the celebration began
about a month ago. "It's been a first year for a lot of
things, " he said.
Coffee House attendance was larger than usual al
though many claimed to have stumbled upon the fes
tival. Graduate student Paul Preckle said, "I just
walked in and here it is!"
Live entertainment, co-sponsored by Student Arts
at Stanford (STARTS), ran from noon to 2 a.m.
"Calliope" provided jazz on the back patio at noon.

Later acts, such as the country group, "The Texas
Flyer," played inside the Cotfee House.
"The Texas Flyer" teatured economics instruc
tor Larry Goulder and economics teaching assistant
Ed Sherry. Patrons taced the stage during the acts
rather than merely eating and talking.
Junior Judy Deutsch, a sell-described Coffee
House regular who was listening to "The Texas
Flyer," cited the noticeable change in the at
mosphere this past year. "I hardly ever came when I
was a freshman and sophomore." She attributed
this to the former dark lighting and the impression
of an "old chess-playing crowd. "
The first Coffee House committee was formed at
the beginning of tall quarter 1966. The purpose of
that coffee house was to provide a facility for com
munication among members of the Stanford com
munity Initially, it was designed to operate Thurs
day and Friday from 0 p.m. to ' 30 a.m. after Tres
idder closed. (The Coftee House currently operates
Monday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 a.m.. Saturday from 1 a.m.
to 1 a.m. and Sunday from ' 1 a.m. to midnight.) Ad
mission was to be limited to University students,
staff and guests. A student policeman was to check
for IDs.
