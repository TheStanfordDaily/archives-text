Reagan lobbies for '82 budget
Washington— President Ronald Reagan lobbied down to
the wire yesterday, leaving nothing to chance as the House
neared a vote on a 982 budget blueprint likely to wind up
much to his liking.
"You know me. I run scared all the time," Reagan said
at the White House.
By most counts, however, conservative Democrats
stood ready to join with the Republican minority to hand
Reagan a stunning victory in the House — a budget plan
tailor-made for his deep spending cuts and three-year. 30
percent income tax rate reduction.
Despite pessimism from Democratic leaders fighting
the Reagan plan. White House deputy press secretary
Larry Speakes predicted the final vote, expected today or
tomorrow, will be close.
Democrats met privately before the House went into
session yesterday, and Speaker Thomas O'Neill, an oppo
nent of the Reagan budget plan, said afterwards, "I only
can hope and pray and trust we changed some minds."
The plan Reagan is backing calls for spending $688.8
billion and anticipates a deficit of $31 billion in 1982 and a
balanced budget in 1984. It instructs the committees of
Congress to slash $36.6 billion in spending for next year.
An alternative backed by the Democratic leadership
calls for spending $714.5 billion, including more than Rea
gan would on social programs, and leaves a deficit of $25.6
billion. It has room for only a one-vear tax cut, smaller
than the first year of the administration's three-year plan.
Reagan, who ushered more than two dozen Republicans
and Democrats into the Oval Office for soft-sell lobbying
in the last week, invited several more as the time neared
tor the House to begin voting.
Speaking with reporters before a private luncheon, the
president declined to acknowledge that he appeard to be on
the brink of a victory. "I'm going to wait tor the count," he
said.
Debate holds election balance
Paris— A televised debate late last night between
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Socialist
challenger Francois Mitterrand may tip the balance in
their close presidential race.
Fighting tooth-and-nail tor re-election, Giscard
d'Estaing hopes the debate will be a turning point in his
battle tor the vote? of 36 million Frenchmen. Mitterrand
was considered the loser in their last debate seven years
ago and Giscard d'Estaing went on to victory in the elec
tion.
Both candidates prepared by watching videotapes of
last fall's U.S. presidential debate, which was adopted as a
model for the French forum on the insistence of the 64-
year-old Mitterrand.
The 10-minute confrontation was to be carried live on
every state-owned radio and television network.
The Paris Stock Exchange continued to climb yesterday
with reports the 55-year-old Giscard d'Estaing would pick
up desperately needed votes during the debate. The gains
almost wiped out the market losses suffered last week af

ter a poll forecast the winner as Mitterrand, who wants to
nationalize selected industries.
The president won his first seven-year term with a slim
1.6 percent margin, or by 420.000 votes. Political observers
contend Giscard d'Estaing was able to entice thousands of
French voters into his camp in the final days because of his
debate performance.
With the polls showing a very real chance France will
get its first leftist government in 23 years. Giscard
d'Estaing eagerly sought the debate. So anxious was he for
the confrontation, that his campaign staff gave in Monday
to all of Mitterrand's demands tor debate conditions.
NATO rejects Soviet compromise
Rome— Encouraged by U.S. willingness to open talks
this year with the Soviet Union on limiting nuclear mis
siles in Europe, the NATO allies yesterday confirmed that
they will modernize their own missile force and formally
rejected a Soviet proposal to freeze the missiles at existing
levels.
In a communique issued after a two-day meeting of
NATO foreign ministers, the alliance expressed sharp
criticism of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and re
peated its warning of last December that an invasion of
Poland would have the "gravest consequences" tor East-
West relations.
In short, the first NATO conference for the Reagan ad
ministration thus concluded in what some hardliners in the
administration might consider an unequal tradeoff: U.S.
action on the arms control issue in return for European
words criticizing the Soviets — but not too harshly.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig expressed satisfac
tion with the alliance's ability to pull together and reassert
its intention to modernize its missile force with 572 Ameri
can-made Pershing II ballistic missiles and ground-based
cruise missiles.
Other U.S. officials expressed their belief that the com
munique's strong language criticizing Soviet actions in
parts of the world not formally included in the NATO de
fense area — especially Soviet activity in the Third World
— marked an important step by NATO toward the foreign
policy views held by the Reagan administration.
An official in Haig's party, who declined to be identified,
also took comfort in the fact that the NATO members went
on record pledging to "make available all the resources
needed" to meet the continuing expansion of Soviet con
ventional military power.
Mormons object to Utah missiles
Salt Lake City — Saying that Mormon pioneers came
West to spread "the gospel of peace," Mormon Church
President Spencer Kimball issued an unusual plea to Pres
ident Ronald Reagan yesterday not to put the MX mobile
missile system in Utah and Nevada.
The 86-year-old Kimball, considered a prophet by the 4.7
million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
day Saints, was joined by his two counselors, Eldon Tan
ner and Marion Romney, in urging that an alternative be
found to concentrating the missiles in any one area of the

nation
The White House and the Pentagon had no immediate
comment.
The Air Force wants to spread 4600 bomb-proof missile
bunkers over millions of acres of land in eastern Nevada
and western Utah Two-hundred MX missiles, each carry
ing 0 nuclear warheads, as well as several hundred look
alike dummy rockets, would be shuttled among the
bunkers on heavy-duty roads in what has been described as
an elaborate "shell game" to confuse the Soviet Union
"Our fathers came to the Western area to establish a
base from which to carry the gospel of peace to the peoples
of the earth." Kimball's statement said. "It is ironic, and
a denial of the very essence of that gospel, that in this
same general area there should be constructed a mam
moth weapons system potentially capable of destroying
much of civilization."
"With the most serious concern over the pressing moral
question of possible nuclear conflict, we plead with our na
tional leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find
viable alternatives which will secure at an earlier date and
with fewer hazards the protection from possible enemy
agression which is our common concern," the statement
said.
Vietnam memorial contest nears end
Washington— A design contest described as the biggest
in U.S. history ends tonight with the selection of the win
ning idea for a memorial to the nation's most unpopular
war, the Vietnam conflict.
Jan Scruggs, the Vietnam veteran who singlehandedly
opened a tight for a memorial in the capital, ignored the
politics of the situation and based his campaign solely on
his conviction that the 57,692 Americans killed in the war
deserve to be remembered.
Scruggs, then 29, started in April '979 with $2500 of his
own money, and raised enough more initially to launch a
national effort. Last year, he proudly witnessed the unani-

mous passage ot a joint Senate-House resolution dedi
cating a two-acre tract of park land near the Lincoln Me
morial as the site tor the new monument.
Reflecting on the unanimous Congressional action,
Scruggs commented to an interviewer: "I think it had
something to do with the tact that we weren't asking for
money."
Like everything else in, Washington, the prospective
cost of the project has ballooned from an early estimate of
$1.5 to $7 million, even with no outlay for land, despite
Scruggs's insistence trom the beginning that the mon
ument be low-key. The one essential, he said, is that it rec
ord the name of every one of the dead.
"I also wanted anybody to be able to compete in the de
sign contest," he said. "Even if you didn't know anything
about drafting or construction, you should be able to sub
mit a sketch and we would supply professional help to
translate the idea into a model."
The winner of the $20,000 first prize will be announced
today at a news conference at the headquarters of the
American Institute of Architects, and the winning design
will be displayed.
Interest rates depress market again
New York— The stock market's week-long retreat con
tinued yesterday amid signs that interest rates may spurt
higher and won't fall soon.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which
plunged 16.48 points Monday, shed another 6.67 points to
close at 972.44.
Big Board volume totaled 49 million shares, up from
40.43 million in the previous session.

Poland would have the "gravest consequences" tor East-
West relations.
In short, the first NATO conference for the Reagan ad
ministration thus concluded in what some hardliners in the
administration might consider an unequal tradeoff: U.S.
action on the arms control issue in return for European
words criticizing the Soviets — but not too harshly.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig expressed satisfac
tion with the alliance's ability to pull together and reassert
its intention to modernize its missile force with 572 Ameri
can-made Pershing II ballistic missiles and ground-based
cruise missiles.
Other U.S. officials expressed their belief that the com
munique's strong language criticizing Soviet actions in
parts of the world not formally included in the NATO de
fense area — especially Soviet activity in the Third World
— marked an important step by NATO toward the foreign
policy views held by the Reagan administration.
An official in Haig's party, who declined to be identified,
also took comfort in the fact that the NATO members went
on record pledging to "make available all the resources
needed" to meet the continuing expansion of Soviet con
ventional military power.
Mormons object to Utah missiles
Salt Lake City — Saying that Mormon pioneers came
West to spread "the gospel of peace," Mormon Church
President Spencer Kimball issued an unusual plea to Pres
ident Ronald Reagan yesterday not to put the MX mobile
missile system in Utah and Nevada.
The 86-year-old Kimball, considered a prophet by the 4.7
million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
day Saints, was joined by his two counselors, Eldon Tan
ner and Marion Romney, in urging that an alternative be
found to concentrating the missiles in any one area of the

nation
The White House and the Pentagon had no immediate
comment.
The Air Force wants to spread 4600 bomb-proof missile
bunkers over millions of acres of land in eastern Nevada
and western Utah Two-hundred MX missiles, each carry
ing 0 nuclear warheads, as well as several hundred look
alike dummy rockets, would be shuttled among the
bunkers on heavy-duty roads in what has been described as
an elaborate "shell game" to confuse the Soviet Union
"Our fathers came to the Western area to establish a
base from which to carry the gospel of peace to the peoples
of the earth." Kimball's statement said. "It is ironic, and
a denial of the very essence of that gospel, that in this
same general area there should be constructed a mam
moth weapons system potentially capable of destroying
much of civilization."
"With the most serious concern over the pressing moral
question of possible nuclear conflict, we plead with our na
tional leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find
viable alternatives which will secure at an earlier date and
with fewer hazards the protection from possible enemy
agression which is our common concern," the statement
said.
Vietnam memorial contest nears end
Washington— A design contest described as the biggest
in U.S. history ends tonight with the selection of the win
ning idea for a memorial to the nation's most unpopular
war, the Vietnam conflict.
Jan Scruggs, the Vietnam veteran who singlehandedly
opened a tight for a memorial in the capital, ignored the
politics of the situation and based his campaign solely on
his conviction that the 57,692 Americans killed in the war
deserve to be remembered.
Scruggs, then 29, started in April '979 with $2500 of his
own money, and raised enough more initially to launch a
national effort. Last year, he proudly witnessed the unani-

mous passage ot a joint Senate-House resolution dedi
cating a two-acre tract of park land near the Lincoln Me
morial as the site tor the new monument.
Reflecting on the unanimous Congressional action,
Scruggs commented to an interviewer: "I think it had
something to do with the tact that we weren't asking for
money."
Like everything else in, Washington, the prospective
cost of the project has ballooned from an early estimate of
$1.5 to $7 million, even with no outlay for land, despite
Scruggs's insistence trom the beginning that the mon
ument be low-key. The one essential, he said, is that it rec
ord the name of every one of the dead.
"I also wanted anybody to be able to compete in the de
sign contest," he said. "Even if you didn't know anything
about drafting or construction, you should be able to sub
mit a sketch and we would supply professional help to
translate the idea into a model."
The winner of the $20,000 first prize will be announced
today at a news conference at the headquarters of the
American Institute of Architects, and the winning design
will be displayed.

Reagan lobbies for '82 budget
Washington— President Ronald Reagan lobbied down to
the wire yesterday, leaving nothing to chance as the House
neared a vote on a 982 budget blueprint likely to wind up
much to his liking.
"You know me. I run scared all the time," Reagan said
at the White House.
By most counts, however, conservative Democrats
stood ready to join with the Republican minority to hand
Reagan a stunning victory in the House — a budget plan
tailor-made for his deep spending cuts and three-year. 30
percent income tax rate reduction.
Despite pessimism from Democratic leaders fighting
the Reagan plan. White House deputy press secretary
Larry Speakes predicted the final vote, expected today or
tomorrow, will be close.
Democrats met privately before the House went into
session yesterday, and Speaker Thomas O'Neill, an oppo
nent of the Reagan budget plan, said afterwards, "I only
can hope and pray and trust we changed some minds."
The plan Reagan is backing calls for spending $688.8
billion and anticipates a deficit of $31 billion in 1982 and a
balanced budget in 1984. It instructs the committees of
Congress to slash $36.6 billion in spending for next year.
An alternative backed by the Democratic leadership
calls for spending $714.5 billion, including more than Rea
gan would on social programs, and leaves a deficit of $25.6
billion. It has room for only a one-vear tax cut, smaller
than the first year of the administration's three-year plan.
Reagan, who ushered more than two dozen Republicans
and Democrats into the Oval Office for soft-sell lobbying
in the last week, invited several more as the time neared
tor the House to begin voting.
Speaking with reporters before a private luncheon, the
president declined to acknowledge that he appeard to be on
the brink of a victory. "I'm going to wait tor the count," he
said.
Debate holds election balance
Paris— A televised debate late last night between
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Socialist
challenger Francois Mitterrand may tip the balance in
their close presidential race.
Fighting tooth-and-nail tor re-election, Giscard
d'Estaing hopes the debate will be a turning point in his
battle tor the vote? of 36 million Frenchmen. Mitterrand
was considered the loser in their last debate seven years
ago and Giscard d'Estaing went on to victory in the elec
tion.
Both candidates prepared by watching videotapes of
last fall's U.S. presidential debate, which was adopted as a
model for the French forum on the insistence of the 64-
year-old Mitterrand.
The 10-minute confrontation was to be carried live on
every state-owned radio and television network.
The Paris Stock Exchange continued to climb yesterday
with reports the 55-year-old Giscard d'Estaing would pick
up desperately needed votes during the debate. The gains
almost wiped out the market losses suffered last week af

ter a poll forecast the winner as Mitterrand, who wants to
nationalize selected industries.
The president won his first seven-year term with a slim
1.6 percent margin, or by 420.000 votes. Political observers
contend Giscard d'Estaing was able to entice thousands of
French voters into his camp in the final days because of his
debate performance.
With the polls showing a very real chance France will
get its first leftist government in 23 years. Giscard
d'Estaing eagerly sought the debate. So anxious was he for
the confrontation, that his campaign staff gave in Monday
to all of Mitterrand's demands tor debate conditions.
NATO rejects Soviet compromise
Rome— Encouraged by U.S. willingness to open talks
this year with the Soviet Union on limiting nuclear mis
siles in Europe, the NATO allies yesterday confirmed that
they will modernize their own missile force and formally
rejected a Soviet proposal to freeze the missiles at existing
levels.
In a communique issued after a two-day meeting of
NATO foreign ministers, the alliance expressed sharp
criticism of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and re
peated its warning of last December that an invasion of
Poland would have the "gravest consequences" tor East-

Reagan lobbies for '82 budget
Washington— President Ronald Reagan lobbied down to
the wire yesterday, leaving nothing to chance as the House
neared a vote on a 982 budget blueprint likely to wind up
much to his liking.
"You know me. I run scared all the time," Reagan said
at the White House.
By most counts, however, conservative Democrats
stood ready to join with the Republican minority to hand
Reagan a stunning victory in the House — a budget plan
tailor-made for his deep spending cuts and three-year. 30
percent income tax rate reduction.
Despite pessimism from Democratic leaders fighting
the Reagan plan. White House deputy press secretary
Larry Speakes predicted the final vote, expected today or
tomorrow, will be close.
Democrats met privately before the House went into
session yesterday, and Speaker Thomas O'Neill, an oppo
nent of the Reagan budget plan, said afterwards, "I only
can hope and pray and trust we changed some minds."
The plan Reagan is backing calls for spending $688.8
billion and anticipates a deficit of $31 billion in 1982 and a
balanced budget in 1984. It instructs the committees of
Congress to slash $36.6 billion in spending for next year.
An alternative backed by the Democratic leadership
calls for spending $714.5 billion, including more than Rea
gan would on social programs, and leaves a deficit of $25.6
billion. It has room for only a one-vear tax cut, smaller
than the first year of the administration's three-year plan.
Reagan, who ushered more than two dozen Republicans
and Democrats into the Oval Office for soft-sell lobbying
in the last week, invited several more as the time neared
tor the House to begin voting.
Speaking with reporters before a private luncheon, the
president declined to acknowledge that he appeard to be on
the brink of a victory. "I'm going to wait tor the count," he
said.
Debate holds election balance
Paris— A televised debate late last night between
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Socialist
challenger Francois Mitterrand may tip the balance in
their close presidential race.
Fighting tooth-and-nail tor re-election, Giscard
d'Estaing hopes the debate will be a turning point in his
battle tor the vote? of 36 million Frenchmen. Mitterrand
was considered the loser in their last debate seven years
ago and Giscard d'Estaing went on to victory in the elec
tion.
Both candidates prepared by watching videotapes of
last fall's U.S. presidential debate, which was adopted as a
model for the French forum on the insistence of the 64-
year-old Mitterrand.
The 10-minute confrontation was to be carried live on
every state-owned radio and television network.
The Paris Stock Exchange continued to climb yesterday
with reports the 55-year-old Giscard d'Estaing would pick
up desperately needed votes during the debate. The gains
almost wiped out the market losses suffered last week af

ter a poll forecast the winner as Mitterrand, who wants to
nationalize selected industries.
The president won his first seven-year term with a slim
1.6 percent margin, or by 420.000 votes. Political observers
contend Giscard d'Estaing was able to entice thousands of
French voters into his camp in the final days because of his
debate performance.
With the polls showing a very real chance France will
get its first leftist government in 23 years. Giscard
d'Estaing eagerly sought the debate. So anxious was he for
the confrontation, that his campaign staff gave in Monday
to all of Mitterrand's demands tor debate conditions.
NATO rejects Soviet compromise
Rome— Encouraged by U.S. willingness to open talks
this year with the Soviet Union on limiting nuclear mis
siles in Europe, the NATO allies yesterday confirmed that
they will modernize their own missile force and formally
rejected a Soviet proposal to freeze the missiles at existing
levels.
In a communique issued after a two-day meeting of
NATO foreign ministers, the alliance expressed sharp
criticism of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and re
peated its warning of last December that an invasion of
Poland would have the "gravest consequences" tor East-
West relations.
In short, the first NATO conference for the Reagan ad
ministration thus concluded in what some hardliners in the
administration might consider an unequal tradeoff: U.S.
action on the arms control issue in return for European
words criticizing the Soviets — but not too harshly.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig expressed satisfac
tion with the alliance's ability to pull together and reassert
its intention to modernize its missile force with 572 Ameri
can-made Pershing II ballistic missiles and ground-based
cruise missiles.
Other U.S. officials expressed their belief that the com
munique's strong language criticizing Soviet actions in
parts of the world not formally included in the NATO de
fense area — especially Soviet activity in the Third World
— marked an important step by NATO toward the foreign
policy views held by the Reagan administration.
An official in Haig's party, who declined to be identified,
also took comfort in the fact that the NATO members went
on record pledging to "make available all the resources
needed" to meet the continuing expansion of Soviet con
ventional military power.
Mormons object to Utah missiles
Salt Lake City — Saying that Mormon pioneers came
West to spread "the gospel of peace," Mormon Church
President Spencer Kimball issued an unusual plea to Pres
ident Ronald Reagan yesterday not to put the MX mobile
missile system in Utah and Nevada.
The 86-year-old Kimball, considered a prophet by the 4.7
million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
day Saints, was joined by his two counselors, Eldon Tan
ner and Marion Romney, in urging that an alternative be
found to concentrating the missiles in any one area of the

nation
The White House and the Pentagon had no immediate
comment.
The Air Force wants to spread 4600 bomb-proof missile
bunkers over millions of acres of land in eastern Nevada
and western Utah Two-hundred MX missiles, each carry
ing 0 nuclear warheads, as well as several hundred look
alike dummy rockets, would be shuttled among the
bunkers on heavy-duty roads in what has been described as
an elaborate "shell game" to confuse the Soviet Union
"Our fathers came to the Western area to establish a
base from which to carry the gospel of peace to the peoples
of the earth." Kimball's statement said. "It is ironic, and
a denial of the very essence of that gospel, that in this
same general area there should be constructed a mam
moth weapons system potentially capable of destroying
much of civilization."
"With the most serious concern over the pressing moral
question of possible nuclear conflict, we plead with our na
tional leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find
viable alternatives which will secure at an earlier date and
with fewer hazards the protection from possible enemy
agression which is our common concern," the statement
said.
Vietnam memorial contest nears end
Washington— A design contest described as the biggest
in U.S. history ends tonight with the selection of the win
ning idea for a memorial to the nation's most unpopular
war, the Vietnam conflict.
Jan Scruggs, the Vietnam veteran who singlehandedly
opened a tight for a memorial in the capital, ignored the
politics of the situation and based his campaign solely on
his conviction that the 57,692 Americans killed in the war
deserve to be remembered.
Scruggs, then 29, started in April '979 with $2500 of his
own money, and raised enough more initially to launch a
national effort. Last year, he proudly witnessed the unani-

mous passage ot a joint Senate-House resolution dedi
cating a two-acre tract of park land near the Lincoln Me
morial as the site tor the new monument.
Reflecting on the unanimous Congressional action,
Scruggs commented to an interviewer: "I think it had
something to do with the tact that we weren't asking for
money."
Like everything else in, Washington, the prospective
cost of the project has ballooned from an early estimate of
$1.5 to $7 million, even with no outlay for land, despite
Scruggs's insistence trom the beginning that the mon
ument be low-key. The one essential, he said, is that it rec
ord the name of every one of the dead.
"I also wanted anybody to be able to compete in the de
sign contest," he said. "Even if you didn't know anything
about drafting or construction, you should be able to sub
mit a sketch and we would supply professional help to
translate the idea into a model."
The winner of the $20,000 first prize will be announced
today at a news conference at the headquarters of the
American Institute of Architects, and the winning design
will be displayed.
