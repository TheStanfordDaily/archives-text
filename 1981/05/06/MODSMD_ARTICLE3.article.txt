# Hoover fellow to become Reagan envoy
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services and local reports
President Ronald Reagan is sending
Hoover Institution fellow Philip Habib
to the Mideast in an attempt to ease
rising tensions between Israel and
Syria that are being stirred by the ap
pearance of Soviet-built missiles in
Lebanon.
Deputy White House press secre
tary Larry Speakes said yesterday
that Habib, who served under four
presidents before returning to the
Hoover last November as a senior re
search fellow, will consult with and
seek the views of the leaders of the
three countries.
The 6' year-old Habib served as a
consultant to the State Dept. with spe
cial emphasis on the Middle East dur
ing 1980. His immediate concern, ac
cording to Speakes, is the recent in
troduction by Syria of Soviet-built
ground-to-air missiles into central
Lebanon.
A career Foreign Service officer,
Habib served as undersecretary of
state for political affairs from 976 to
1978, and was also Stanford's
diplomat-in-residence during 1978-79.
State Dept. spokesman David Pas
sage said that Habib "will be most in
terested in hearing what the leaders
have to say rather than in advancing
any views of the United States. The
United States in general has resisted

saying what we thought ought to be
done by any of the parties."
The United States believes, Pas
sage said, that all parties concerned
have shown a considerable amount of
restraint. He added. "This situation
has not yet deteriorated into open
lighting, and in the hope of preventing
it trom breaking into open fighting, we
are continuing to do everything we
can."
Leaders trom both nations said that
such restraint would continue until
Habib begins negotiations.
Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Hal
im Khaddam said in Beirut yesterday
that his country's deployment ot sur
face-to-air missiles in Lebanon is an
"unquestionable" right of self-de
fense but added that Syria will receive
Habib.
In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Men
achem Begin yesterday indicated that
Israel will delay any military in
tervention in central Lebanon over the
missile crisis while Habib travels to
the Middle East. Begin also said he
welcomed Habib's visit, calling Habib
a "wonderful and experienced
diplomat."
However, Begin doubted that Habib
could help matters. After meeting
with senior Cabinet ministers, Begin
said Israel is willing to explore all dip
lomatic avenues to resolve the crisis,

but stressed that etforts by the United
States to convince the Syrians to
withdraw the anti-aircraft batteries
have so far yielded no results.
"Only a miracle would influence the
Syrians to remove their missiles in
Lebanon," Begin told reporters alter
the Cabinet session.
In Damascus, Syrian officials said
Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister
Georgy Korniyenko would arrive from
Moscow for consultations today.
There was no immediate confirmation
from the Kremlin.
The White House released no details
on when Habib will depart or what his

itinerary will be in the Mideast. Other
sources said that he is not expected to
leave until he confers with Secretary
ot State Alexander Haig. who is ex
pected to return to Washington early
Wednesday from a meeting ot North
Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign
ministers in Rome.
The announcement of Habib's mis
sion came the day after Samuel Lewis,
the U.S. ambassador to Israel, de
livered a letter from Reagan to Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
cautioning Begin against taking mili
tary action to neutralize the missiles.
Israeli sources said that Reagan
asked for more time to reduce ten
sions through diplomatic efforts.
At the State Dept., Passage said
that U.S. Undersecretary for Political
Affairs Walter Stoessel had discussed
the tensions over the Syrian missile in
stallation Monday with Soviet Am
bassador Anatoly Dobrynin.
The current crisis results from ap
parent violations by both sides of a
tacit agreement reached in 1976 under
which Syria was allowed to police
north central Lebanon while Israel
dealt with Palestinians in the south.
