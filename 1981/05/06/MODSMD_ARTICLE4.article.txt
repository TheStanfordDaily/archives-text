A mariachi band kicked off the an
nua' Cinco de Mayo rally at noon in
White Plaza yesterday. About 20) peo
ple attended the event sponsored by El
Centro Chicano.
Cinco de Mayo traditionally com
memorates the Mexican victory over
the French in 1862. The battle was the
first in a protracted struggle in which
the endurance of a few Mexicans
served as an inspiration for the fight
ing which followed. The purpose of the
celebration is two-fold: it reminds the
Chicanos of the many struggles in
their history and recognizes the conti
nuing battle for social justice.
According to Margaret Govea, an
active member of El Centro Chicano.
"It is an opportunity for all members
of the University and larger com
munities to recognize the presence of
Chicanos at Stanford, and also to ap
preciate and understand our cultural
and artistic heritage as well as our
past and present socio-cultural reali
ty."
Speeches centered on the plight of
Chicanos and particularly emphasized
labor here.
Arturo Islas, professor of English,
emphasized the origins of the first Cin
co de Mayo in the courage and bravery
of a small number of people who
wanted independence and self-de
termination.
Islas stressed the need to "live up to
the spirit of Cinco de Mayo." The cele
bration gives the Chicano community
here an opportunity to communicate

its uniqueness to "those who are less
privileged."
Maria Leal, a representative from
the El Salvador Solidarity Committee,
referred to the need to keep the memo
ry of 50 years of genocide alive. "Let
us refuse to forget," she said.
The history of repression in El
Salvador goes back more than 00
years, she said. She called the planta
tions the initial source of much of the
present inequality.
Graduate student Hector Montes
emphasized, "The vast majority of
Chicanos are working class people."
Pointing to the unequal distribution of
wealth in the U.S., Montes said the av
erage yearly income of Chicanos is
$12,000 while the national mean is
$17,000. And Chicano unemployment is
two to three times greater than the na
tional average, he added.
According to senior Mary Beth
Pinon, coordinator of the rally, the
celebration has been a tradition here
tor more than 10 years. She added that
more than 400 Chicano students cur
rently attend the University. Chicano
enrollment began increasing around
1969, she said.
The staff at El Centro Chicano has
spent the past year preparing for this
and other special events in May. To
contribute to the gala of the day, bur
ritos and drinks were sold to the
gathering in front of Old Union.
Further festivities were held on
Wilbur Field at 4 p.m. This included
music by "Los Peludos," sports, fruit
and refreshments.
