Africanists from throughout northern Califor
nia met at Berkeley Saturday for the second an
nual Stanford-Berkeley Joint Center Conference.
The conference, held at Stanford last year, also
attracted faculty from UC-Davis, Sacramento,
Stanislaus and Chico State universities and Cor
nell University.
Participants delivered approximately 30 pa
pers on a wide variety of topics, including the
condition of women in Africa, the accommoda
tion of ethnic claims by African states, policy is
sues in Africa, the political economy of under
development, the social history of Africa and
African cinematography, art and music.
Opening remarks were presented by Prof. Carl
Rosberg of Berkeley and Joint Center directors
Prof. Joseph Greenberg of Stanford and Prof.
Michael Watts of Berkeley. Participants then
chose one of four morning sessions and, after a
lunch break and a keynote address, one of four af
ternoon sessions to attend.
The keynote address was delivered before an
audience of 110 by Stanford's St. Clair Drake,
professor emeritus in the Anthropology Dept.
Drake gave a critical overview of developments
in Africa and in the field of African studies over
the last quarter century.
The early years of African studies involved
more anthropology than political science, Drake
said. The "initiators" and first "sustainers" of
the field were African missionaries and early
black universities such as Howard University.

Drake called the years 1952 to 1960 the period of
"secularization and depoliticization" in African
studies. "America was discovering Africa for the
first time since Leopold's Congo," he said. Amer
ica's renewed interest stemmed primarily from
wanting to "keep the rebels out" of Africa.
President John Kennedy's administration pro
vided the years of "realpolitik and roman
ticism," Drake said. The Peace Corps program
contributed to improved relations between the
U.S. and African governments.
While at Berkeley, Drake helped train the first
team of Peace Corps volunteers to go to Africa.
That team was sent to Ghana, the first colonized
African state to achieve independence. Kwame
Nkrumah, who led Ghana to independence in 1957
and who was an early associate of Drake's, was
"very proud of that team," Drake said.
The Kennedy administration elevated both po
litical and cultural links with Africa. Drake de
scribed a "literary tea'' hosted by Jackie Ken
nedy at the White House and attended by several
noted African literary figures, including Leopold
Senghor.
The late '60s were the "aftermath and after
glow" years when many African states reflected
on their recently won independence.
Drake described the 70s as a "totally different
period" that represented the "repoliticization"
of Africa. African studies were cloaked in ethical
and moral rather than intellectual terms. Docu
ments made available by the Freedom of In

formation Act revealed heavy previous involve
ment in Africa by the Central Intelligence Agen
cy.
Drake concluded his review of the past 25 years
of "high drama" in Africa by mentioning "some
important unfinished business" in Namibia and
South Africa. "One wonders about the nature of
the ceremony when something finally happens,
when power finally shifts in the Republic of South
Africa. Let us hope that time is longer than rope
in South Africa," he said.
The fundamental task of the Africanist, ac
cording to Drake, is to "continue to do research,
to tell the truth when we see it.and to educate the
American public. Let Africans get on with the
job, and resist dabbling in their affairs unless
specifically asked, and even then say no some
times."
Founded in 1979, the Joint Center tor African
Studies exists to promote cooperation between
the Stanford and Berkeley African centers and
improve the caliber of research. The two cam
puses share material sources and faculty.
In addition to the annual Joint Center Con
ference, a Joint Faculty Colloquium is held every
quarter to bring together Africanists from Stan
ford and Berkeley.
The Joint Center is funded by a grant from the
Office of Education.
Lunch was provided by the Stanford East
African Relief Organization Proceeds will go
toward famine relief in the Horn of Africa.
