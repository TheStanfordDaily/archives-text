## Nonaddictive pain-killer developed 
### Jessie Travis 
new pain-killer found to
Jr\ be more potent than
A morphine but having no
addictive effects is illiciting
cautious excitement among
doctors.
Zomepirac sodium promises
to be the long-sought nonaddic
tive alternative to morphine in
relieving post-operative pain.
Biochemists say that its per
ipheral. rather than central, ac
tivity makes it logically free of
dependency-forming proper
ties, and clinicians report that
tests agree.
Moreover, the drug can be
orally administered like aspirin
and codiene, and causes rela
tively minor side effects. It has
been described as a non
steroidal. anti-inflammatory
prostaglandin inhibitor which
works by blocking pain impulses
mediated by prostaglandins.
"Here is a drug that has the
potential of opening a new
door," Dr. William Forrest, a
Stanford anesthesiologist, re
marked after testing it in No-

vember. But. as Dorsev Woods
on, a medical journalist said.
"Nobody has mentioned mira
cle drug' or breakthrough "
Awareness of past disappoint
ments encourages caution. The
medical community has not for
gotten that heroine was in
troduced as a nonaddicting al
ternative to morphine, only to
prove more addictive than
morphine. Also, the great early
expectations of enkaphalins and
edorphins - "the brain's own
morphine" - are proving il
lusory.
Forrest reported the results
of his study in the Nov. 21 issue
of the -Journal of the American
Medical -4ssociation.
In his conclusion he stated,
"Existing habits and attitudes
of nurses and physicians regard
ing the usefulness of oral
analgesics will seriously
hamper the acceptance of this
or any potent oral analgesic."
Forrest was referring to phy
sicians' traditional practice of
administering an injected post
operative painkiller and then

switching to an oral analgesic
two or three days later when the
patient is definitely tolerating
oral intake.
His data showed that oral
analgesics are absorbed and
work effectively when given as
soon as oral fluids are tolerated.
"Interestingly, only one patient
out ot 109 vomited the oral medi
cation. even though we gave the
drugs as early as four hours af
ter surgery and on the average
2' .5 hours after surgery," he re
ported.
Whether or not zomepirac so
dium has begun to replace post
operative morphine since its in
troduction in November re
mains to be seen. Besides being
non-addictive, orally adminis
tered and causing fewer side-ef
fects. the new drug has an addi
tional advantage over morphine
in that it would save doctors the
paperwork required by narcotic
regulations for the use of
morphine.
Sales of the oral analgesic re
flect wide acceptance â€” in five
months more than a million peo

ple have been treated with
zomepirac sodium. But it is not
clear it the drug is being used in
place of morphine or in other
treatment of pain.
Forrest, who sees in
zomepirac sodium a con
siderable improvement over
morphine, remains cautious. In
reply to tears ot the new drug
going the way ot heroine.' e said,
"I wouldn't have believed hero
ine to be nonaddictive simply
because it belonged to an addic
tive class of drugs. Zomepirac
sodium belongs to a class of
drugs which has never been in
criminated for addiction. It is
more on the level of Tylenol
than heroine."
But he is careful to point out
that the possibility ot zomepirac
sodium being discovered to be
addictive still exists. "We must
be extremely conservative with
regard to any innovation. In this
case, we must recognize that we
are extrapolating from small
test populations to the general
population, and alter our expec
tations accordingly."
