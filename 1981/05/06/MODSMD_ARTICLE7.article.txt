# New X-ray machines to increase accuracy

Xray pictures in the future
may uncover the 30 per
cent of lung tumors now
missed, tell if the coronary ar
teries in the heart are clogging,
and detect lipid build-up in the
carotid artery that could lead to
a stroke. They may also be able
to replace some exploratory
surgeries and diagnostic cather
izations.
Medical researchers at Stan
ford and elsewhere are develop
ing ways to select what will be
in an X-ray picture, pictures
that tell more by containing
less.
In a standard X-ray picture, a
lung tumor, if shadowed by ribs,
can be missed, or a gall bladder,
covered by a lobe of the liver,
overlooked, because conven
tional X-ray pictures include too
much anatomy. What's most
important can go unnoticed.
But Drs. William Brody, di
rector of Stanford's Advanced
Imaging Techniques Labora
tory, and Albert Macovski, pro
fessor of electrical engineering
and of radiology, are developing
an X-ray machine that sub
tracts those extra elements, and
produces a stark, clear picture
for examination.
This machine, built by Gener
al Electric, is like no other ex
isting at present. It employs
"dual-energy imaging." which
is two beams of X-rays, one ot
high energy, one ot low energy,
to form the image.
This new method is more sen
sitive than the old. It allows doc
tors to gather the same amount
of information using a lower
dose of X-rays, or concentration
ot iodine, or both, than the old
conventional film does. (lodine
is used as a label to locate the
structure ot interest.) And for a
comparable dose of X-rays or
iodine, the dual energy imaging
method reveals more than the

standard method.
Macovski says this work
could bring great improvement
in the diagnosis of two types of
diseases: those at present that
can't be reliably diagnosed with
X-rays such as bone and lung
tumors and those that can only
be detected with invasive tech
niques. such as exploratory
surgerj
Brody is striving to refine the
technique to where the coronary
arteries will be able to be vis
ualized, something which is im
possible today and which would
be a quantum leap in the detec
tion of heart disease.
Dual energy imaging exploits
a phenomenon of physics: when
X-ray beams pass through a ma
terial, they lose some of their
energy to that material. How
much energy is \ost and in what
form depends upon the materi
al: it is different for the iodine
tag. for the body's soft tissues
and for bones.
As a patient is slowly trans
ported by table through the
dual-energy imaging machine,
razor-thin X-ray pictures are
taken of the part of the body
being examined. The informa
tion from each slice is fed into a
computer automatically, where
the difference between how the
high and low energy beams have
fared is rapidly calculated. The
differences between the change
in each beam is used to create
the final picture.
As the beams pass through
the body's soft tissues, the loss
of energy by either beam is
slight, so the shadows from all
the soft tissue regions are near
ly cancelled in the computer im
age. In the iodine-tagged tissue,
however, because of the nature
of iodine, one beam loses much
more energy than the other, so
the difference calculated by the
computer is large.
