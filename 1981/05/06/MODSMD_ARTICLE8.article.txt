new method of producing
j*\ growth hormone, de-
A veloped by the San Fran
cisco firm Genentech Inc. and
undergoing clinical tests at
Stanford, may make shortness
obsolete.
Presently, growth hormones
must be extracted from the
pituitaries of human donor
cadavers. But the new method
will make it possible to mass
produce the hormone in a labo
ratory.
Extraction and distribution of
growth hormones is currently
controlled by the National
Pituitary Association (NPA)
which provides the growth
hormone cost-free. However,
one child in one year needs the
pituitaries of 50 cadavers, with
average treatment lasting five
to ' 0 years, but because of short
supply, the NPA allows each pa
tient only enough hormone to
reach the height of five feet.
Doctors are presently unable
to help children who have nor
mal levels of growth hormone
but are abnormally short. Gen
entech hopes that if large
amounts of their genetically en
gineered hormone can be pro
duced, these children will also
be able to reach normal heights.
Initial tests of the hormone
were made by Genentech on
animals. Then in February, 11

institutions including Stanford
made the first clinical tests on
adults.
Drs. Raymond Hintz. Ronald
Rosenfeld, Daryl Wilson and
Ann Bennett at Stanford's de
partment of pediatric en
docrinology conducted the
three-week trial on 7 adult vol
unteers.

The group received physical
examinations to verify the safe
ty ot the manufactured
hormone. Tests were'*made on
heart and liver functions as well
as metabolical effects — such as
increased glucose levels and re
lease of a protein called
somatomedin.
The study was intended to test
only the growth hormone's safe
ty. Adults can no longer grow
because their bones are totally
calcified, and thus tests for ef
ficacy of the hormone must be
made on children. Nonetheless,
researchers can predict the
hormone's effectiveness by
measuring the levels of the pro
tein somatomedin in adult sub
jects' blood.
Although there is debate as to
the way growth hormones work,
it is believed that the growth
hormone causes the liver to pro
duce somatomedin, which in
turn causes cells to multiply. In
creased levels of somatomedin
in adult subjects' bipod ipay in
dicate that the manufactured
hormone will'cause children to
grow.
Because of Federal Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) regu
lations, the results of Febru
ary's tests cannot be divulged
.until the tests have been ap
proved. Rosenfeld was only able
to say that "minor side-effects
will need to be resolved."
As soon as the test results re
ceive approval from the FDA,
further tests will be made on
children who suffer from ab
normally small levels of growth
hormone. Genentech hopes to
conduct these tests this summer
at the same 11 institutions.
The medical community is
enthusiastic about the possi
bilities ot manufacturing
growth hormone. Natural
hormone is so rare now that not
all short children can receive
treatment. It is also difficult to

get enough hormone for re
search.
The natural hormone is rare
because it is species-specific,
meaning that it cannot be ex
tracted from anirtials. And un
like sex hormones, the growth
hormone protein is too complex
to be synthesized.
But engineering techniques,

if successful in producing
growth hormones, will allow re
searchers to overcome both
these hurdles, ahd success
seems likely. In fact, studies in
dicate that children will grow
taller with new hormone treat
ments than they do with current
methods: researchers at Emory
University in Atlanta recently
tound that in short children with
seemingly normal levels ot
growth hormone, about 40 per
cent grew when given extra
hormone.
Genentech Inc., which is also
working on engineering insulin
and interferon, produces the
growth hormone in its labora
tories. Technicians reconstruct
the gene which codes for growth
hormone protein, which is then
inserted into E. coli bacteria
cells. The bacteria are thus
tricked into producing the hu
man hormone.
The E. coli are kept in large
fermentation vats from which
the hormone is extracted and
sent to doctors as a treeze-dried
powder.
The growth hormone is ex
pensive to produce, but Gen
entech hopes to lower the cost
through mass-production. Ac
cording to Robert Swift, a Gen
entech researcher involved in
the testing, "We have had the
technology to produce growth
hormones for six years and have
been testing on the commercial
level for the last four. If testing
goes as planned, the hormone
will be on the market by 1983.''
Dr. Rosenteld is hopeful
about the manufactured
hormone. Stanford's pediatric
endocrinology department has
about 24 patients who currently
receive natural hormones.
The new method of producing
hormones offers the possibility
for almost all children to reach
normal height.

one child in one year needs the
pituitaries of 50 cadavers, with
average treatment lasting five
to ' 0 years, but because of short
supply, the NPA allows each pa
tient only enough hormone to
reach the height of five feet.
Doctors are presently unable
to help children who have nor
mal levels of growth hormone
but are abnormally short. Gen
entech hopes that if large
amounts of their genetically en
gineered hormone can be pro
duced, these children will also
be able to reach normal heights.
Initial tests of the hormone
were made by Genentech on
animals. Then in February, 11

institutions including Stanford
made the first clinical tests on
adults.
Drs. Raymond Hintz. Ronald
Rosenfeld, Daryl Wilson and
Ann Bennett at Stanford's de
partment of pediatric en
docrinology conducted the
three-week trial on 7 adult vol
unteers.

The group received physical
examinations to verify the safe
ty ot the manufactured
hormone. Tests were'*made on
heart and liver functions as well
as metabolical effects — such as
increased glucose levels and re
lease of a protein called
somatomedin.
The study was intended to test
only the growth hormone's safe
ty. Adults can no longer grow
because their bones are totally
calcified, and thus tests for ef
ficacy of the hormone must be
made on children. Nonetheless,
researchers can predict the
hormone's effectiveness by
measuring the levels of the pro
tein somatomedin in adult sub
jects' blood.
Although there is debate as to
the way growth hormones work,
it is believed that the growth
hormone causes the liver to pro
duce somatomedin, which in
turn causes cells to multiply. In
creased levels of somatomedin
in adult subjects' bipod ipay in
dicate that the manufactured
hormone will'cause children to
grow.
Because of Federal Drug Ad
ministration (FDA) regu
lations, the results of Febru
ary's tests cannot be divulged
.until the tests have been ap
proved. Rosenfeld was only able
to say that "minor side-effects
will need to be resolved."
As soon as the test results re
ceive approval from the FDA,
further tests will be made on
children who suffer from ab
normally small levels of growth
hormone. Genentech hopes to
conduct these tests this summer
at the same 11 institutions.
The medical community is
enthusiastic about the possi
bilities ot manufacturing
growth hormone. Natural
hormone is so rare now that not
all short children can receive
treatment. It is also difficult to

get enough hormone for re
search.
The natural hormone is rare
because it is species-specific,
meaning that it cannot be ex
tracted from anirtials. And un
like sex hormones, the growth
hormone protein is too complex
to be synthesized.
But engineering techniques,

if successful in producing
growth hormones, will allow re
searchers to overcome both
these hurdles, ahd success
seems likely. In fact, studies in
dicate that children will grow
taller with new hormone treat
ments than they do with current
methods: researchers at Emory
University in Atlanta recently
tound that in short children with
seemingly normal levels ot
growth hormone, about 40 per
cent grew when given extra
hormone.
Genentech Inc., which is also
working on engineering insulin
and interferon, produces the
growth hormone in its labora
tories. Technicians reconstruct
the gene which codes for growth
hormone protein, which is then
inserted into E. coli bacteria
cells. The bacteria are thus
tricked into producing the hu
man hormone.
The E. coli are kept in large
fermentation vats from which
the hormone is extracted and
sent to doctors as a treeze-dried
powder.
The growth hormone is ex
pensive to produce, but Gen
entech hopes to lower the cost
through mass-production. Ac
cording to Robert Swift, a Gen
entech researcher involved in
the testing, "We have had the
technology to produce growth
hormones for six years and have
been testing on the commercial
level for the last four. If testing
goes as planned, the hormone
will be on the market by 1983.''
Dr. Rosenteld is hopeful
about the manufactured
hormone. Stanford's pediatric
endocrinology department has
about 24 patients who currently
receive natural hormones.
The new method of producing
hormones offers the possibility
for almost all children to reach
normal height.

Presently, growth hormones
