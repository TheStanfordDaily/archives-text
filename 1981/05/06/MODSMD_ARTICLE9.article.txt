# Researchers develop artificial ear

invention and refinement of auto
jj matic computers and associated ad-
J vances in integrated circuits have es
corted human-kind into the age ot bionics: It is
now possible to implant tiny electronics in the
human body which can provide electrical stim
ulation normally supplied by nervous tissue.
One such device is the familiar heart
pacemaker which faithfully sustains the elec
trical signals that cause the heart muscles to
contract rhythmically. It is a relatively simple
device, providing only a stream of electrical
pulses at a regular rate.
In contrast, the artificial ear developed by
Stanford's Department of Electronic Engi
neering Laboratories contains three tiny proc
essors, each with the computing power of a
small computer. These can process complex
signals.thereby converting speech sounds into
electrical signals that the human brain can un
derstand. The process essentially allows one to
hear by computer.
Dr. Robert White, head of the Department ot
Electrical Engineering, and Dr. Blair Sim
mons, professor of surgery at Stanford Medi
cal School, are directing the activities of nu
merous graduate students in the design and de
velopment of this 'bionic' ear.
The most recent model of the artificial ear
consists of an implantable circuit package the
size ot a small coin, a tiny array of eight elec
trodes which make contact with the auditory
nerve, an external circuit package to deliver

information and power to the buried elec
tronics, and a brietcase-sized signal processor.
As the speech processing computer program
is perfected, the briefcase containing the mi
croprocessors will be replaced by a package
the size of a pack of cigarettes, which the user
can carry discreetly.
The entire device has been built using exist
ing technology, but some interesting innova
tions have been made, according to Dr. White.
One of these is the development of a flexible
electrode array which can be inserted into the
cochlea, the pea-sized organ that converts
acoustic signals into electrical signals which
brain 'hears.'
The biggest obstacle to the perfection of the
new hearing device stems from our lack of
knowledge about how the brain interprets the
signals it receives via the auditory nerve.
Both the frequency of pulses the brain hears
and which of the 30,000 nerve fibers sends this
pulse affect the brain's interpretation of pitch
and loudness.
Progress in the development of a speech
processing program which perfectly mimics
these pulse patterns — and hence progress for
the artificial ear itself — hinges on the avail
ability of suitable implant patients, according
to Dr. Simmons.
Such persons, who previously had full hear
ing capabilities and have since been rendered
deaf by some injury or disease which left the
auditory nerve intact, are crucial to the even
tual availability of fully functional 'bionic'
ears. By studying them, the relationship be
tween ear pulses and brain translations can be
evaluated more accurately.
White added that "99 percent of the work is
being done by graduate students."
Indeed, these students are responsible for
the design and manufacture of all components
of the artificial ear.
Both White and Simmons see increasing in
teraction of microelectronics with the human
body in the future.
