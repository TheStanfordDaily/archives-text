More than 100 members of the Stan
ford community gathered in Kresge
auditorium last night for a panel dis
cussion titled "Financing Political
Campaigns: Who Can Afford to Run?"
Sponsored by the League of Women
Voters and Common Cause, the panel
included Visiting Prof. John An
derson, Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset
of the Hoover Institution and Common
Cause Board Member Susan Rouder.
The three panelists expressed unan
imous support for the federal decision
in 1974 to institute public funding of
presidential campaigns and to limit
private contributions in order to pre
vent candidates from being "bought"
by special interest groups.
"This quiet revolution produced an
election free of the kind of scandal
that took place in 1972," Anderson
said. "In 1976 we proved there was a
better way to elect a president. Public
financing should now be extended to
House and Senate races as well."
Anderson said that as a con
gressman, he urged the passage of
measures which would have extended
equal public funding to Congressional
candidates. He said the proposal nev
er got as far as the House floor.
"The incumbents were fearful of
equal funds going to their opponents,"
Anderson said. "Statistics show that,
in general, incumbents raise four
dollars for every one dollar raised by
their challengers. This may in turn by
a factor that explains why 92 percent
of incumbent congressmen are reel
ected. Something is obviously wrong
with the system."
Lipset, while maintaining that
private wealth should not be allowed
to dominate politics, outlined several
problems that have arisen as a result
of the new method of government
campaign financing.
"One of the consequences has been
the centralization of campaigns at the
expense of local organizations,"
Lipset said. "There's less activity and
participation on the local level be
cause the national campaign must
now account for every expense and
contribution. It must discourage local
spending which might go beyond cam

paign limits."
Lipset added that current regu
lations on the sizes of contributions do
not include any regulation on the
amount that a candidate can con
tribute to his own campaign. He
pointed to the Libertarian selection of
a candidate who came from a very
wealthy family and could thus draw on
a large source of unlimited funding.
"I am not opposed to government fi
nancing," Lipset said,"but it is a com
plicated issue and cannot be remedied
simply with the current system."
Rouder expressed the fear that de
spite the federal attempt to control
private campaign contributions, legis

lators are still vulnerable to influence
in the form of dollars.
"There are two culprits," Rouder
said. "Political action committees
and independent campaign commit
tees. Neither are restricted undercur
rent federal regulations."
Rouder said the political action
committees are formed with the ex
press purpose of influencing legisla
tion. Their financial support goes to
those who will support and protect
their interests, he maintained.
"In 1974 there were 608 political ac
tion committees," Rouder said. In
1980 there were 2300. And the greatest
