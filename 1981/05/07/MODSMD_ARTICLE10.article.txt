# Cowell gynecologist testing treatments of yeast infection
## 
### James Bouquin 
A recent publication de
scribed yeast infections as a
"mild but annoying teminine
problem." For most women,
the accent is on "annoying."
Dr. John Wachtell, a
gynecologist at Cowell Health
Center, is presently testing a
new treatment which may be a
future prescription for the ir
ritating effects of vaginal yeast
infections.
Wachtell s study is sponsored
by Syntex, a major pharma
ceutical company, as "the final
step in gaining FDA approval
for general use of butoconazole
nitrate," a drug which has al
ready proven effective in ex
perimental use on animals.
Here and at the Palo Alto Medi
cal Center, Wachtell is recruit
ing women with yeast infections
tor participations in the study.
Some 600 women nation-wide
will be involved as subject;
Wachtell hopes to see 50 trom
this area by October.
Butoconazole nitrate is simi
lar to miconazole nitrate, popu
larly know as "Monistat,"
which is currently a routine
treatment for yeast infections.

According to Dr. Wachtell, the
major significance of his study
is to provide an alternative med
ication for the inevitable future
resistance to Monistat and other
commonly-used treatments. In
addition, different concen
trates and application periods
of the experimental drug are
being studies for their effective
ness. Wachtell claims that ex
tensive research of vaginal in
fections has only taken place in
the last 10 years.
Yeast infections are the most
common of all vaginal infec
tions. Also known as candidiasis
and moniliasis, it is a result of
an "overgrowth'' of the monilia
fungus, a normal resident of the
mouth, digestive tract and
vagina. This is thought to be
caused by a variety of condi
tions. including antibiotics, hot
and irritation from
tight or nylon clothes. Psy
chological factors have also
been identified and some folks
even claim sexual intercourse is
the culprit.
There is essentially no chance
of a yeast infection developing
into a more serius condition and
it is generally self-confined —
according to Wachtell, "100 per

cent of an earlier patient group
that was given placebos (i.e.', no
medication) were cured within
two weeks." Meanwhile,
though, the itching, burning and
discharge associated with such
vaginal infections can cause ex
treme discomfort. The develop
ment ot medication more able
to effectively alleviate these
symptoms is awaited by many
women.
Women who presently have a
yeast infection, or who believe
that one may be developing, are
encouraged to contact Dr.
Wachtell at Cowell tor partici
pation in the butoconazole
nitrate study. Even non-stu
dents will receive a free Pap
smear, blood pregnancy test
and a variety of other cultures
and tests (as well as medica
tion ) if they are eligible for par
ticipation. Those unlucky
enough to receive a placebo or
who are unsatisfied with the re
sults may drop out of the study,
according to Wachtell. The oth
ers will hopefully gain some
personal relief and perhaps
some gratification in helping to
make life a bit less "annoying"
for women in the future.
