## Editorial Change ASSU election process 
### 
The ASSU elections are three weeks
past, but there is still confusion over elec
tion events, procedures, and results. This
year's spectacle has raised important
questions concerning the election process
itself- questions the Daily hopes will be
fully and effectively addressed by the new
Senate.
Senate elections were conducted in a
manner which minimized student eval
uation of candidates. With only a week be
tween the deadline for filing candidacy
petitions and the election, there was little
chance for any 4 ' campaign" in the sense of
informing the students about campus is
sues and presenting them with perceived
and meaningful choices.
In addition, the snafu over the mis
printed, late election pamphlet hindered
the voters' ability to evaluate the issues.
Instead, the election was reduced to a pop
ularity contest, with votes cast on the
basis of which candidates had the clev
erest posters rather than which would best
be able to effectively steer the ASSU.
Faced with limited time constraints,
the Daily editorial, board was unable to
consider the questions and candidates pre
sented as fully as either we or many can
didates would have liked.
Nonetheless, part of our responsibility
as the only news medium covering the
election was to take positions on individ
ual candidates. Non-endorsement was not
an attack on the personality or character
of unendorsed candidates: rather, en
dorsements were given only to those can
didates who presented themselves as the
most qualified and committed of those in
the field. The endorsements were the
product of candidate interviews by nine
people (a panel) in everyday contact with
campus issues and events. However short
the interviews may have been, no other
group of students spent that much time

with each and every one of the candidates,
and it is doubtful that many spent that
much time with any candidate. It does not
take long to determine that a candidate is
not articulate or informed enough to func
tion well in the senate.
A more intelligent election process
would make sense for fee assessments as
well. Currently, if 20 percent of the stu
dents vote on a proposed assessment and
more than half vote yes, the assessment is
approved. "No" votes are counted with
"yes" votes in reaching the 20 percent fig
ure. Thus, if a voter is against a particular
assessment but feels that most students
voting on it will vote to approve, the ra
tional decision is to abstain from voting
and hope that vote totals do not reach the
magic 20 percent figure. Voting no actual
ly helps those who voted yes.
The present fee assessment situation
means that dozens of student organiza
tions will be without funds tor at least part
of next year. Since the ASSU's poor han
dling of the pre-election period is at least
partly to blame for the low voter turnout,
the ASSU should fund a new set of elec
tions for those assessment proposals
which failed to receive 20 percent the first
time around.
The ASSU feels no compunction in tell
ing students to wait months while it stud
ies plans for a campus concert series. The
senate constantly speaks of the need to
gather more information for considered
decision-making. Why, then, when it
comes to the selection of its own members
and the funding of its own activities does
the ASSU want to deny students the time
and opportunity to make considered
judgments? Perhaps the new senate will
see fit to uphold its obligation to the stu
dents and rectify the current irresponsible
and unrepresentative process.
