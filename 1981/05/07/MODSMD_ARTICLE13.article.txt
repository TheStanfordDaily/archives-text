# Condition aid to El Salvador
## 
### 
Last Wednesday, the House Foreign Af
fairs committee voted 26-7 in favor of a
resolution-which would ban all U.S. mili
tary aid to the junta in El Salvador and re
move American military advisers until
certain human rights conditions are met.
For aid to continue, the Reagan adminis
tration would have to provide Congress
with proof that the Duarte government
has not in a consistent pattern of
gross violations ct human rights," intends
ttf schedule free elections "at an early
date," and also fulfill a number of other
conditions relating to the investigation of
recent political assassinations believed to
have been committed by government
forces.
The resolution, which will be voted on as
an amendment to an upcoming foreign aid
bill, must be approved by both the House
and Senate before it can become law. In
the Foreign Relations committee, 18 of 21
Democratic members supported the
amendment as did 8 of 15 Republicans.
The prospects for the amendment's pas
sage in the House seem good, but remain
uncertain in the Republican-dominated
Senate.
The Daily strongly endorses the Solarz-
Bingham amendment (named for the two
New York congressmen who sponsored it)
as a means of making the dubious U.S. Pol

icy in El Salvador more accountable to the
American people, specifically, through
the Congress.
Because of its human rights violations,
none of our Western European allies sup
port the Duarte government. The Solarz-
Bingham amendment will force the Rea
gan administration to examine specific
junta policies and substantiate the junta's
claim of innocence in the past and on
going assassinations and atrocities with
which it has been charged.
Strong evidence has been presented that
implicates the. ruling junta, and Con
gressional voices are now speaking out
against continued U.S. military aid sup
port. The investigative requirements of
the Solarz-Bingham amendment would in
stitutionalize greater responsibility and
attention to human rights in U.S. policy in
El Salvador.
The United States cannot maintain a
credible image abroad, with either our al
lies or the Soviet Union, as long as we con
tinue to ignore the human rights violations
of governments receiving U.S. aid, partic
ularly those receiving military aid. By
passing the Solarz-Bingham amendment,
Congress will force a reworking of the El
Salvador policy that has been sealed up in
the executive office for too long.
