Sell AWACS
The Daily recently published
a cartoon on its editorial page
which intimidated that Saudi
Arabia is going to use U.S. built
AWACS to "hunt Jews." As usu
al, the racism inherent in depic
ting Arabs as hooked-nosed and
mustachioed fiends escaped the
daily editors. In any event, the
cartoon in question was not
drawn by anyone with a particu
larly perceptive grasp on reali
ty.
How can America scream
about a Soviet threat to our
Middle Eastern oil supplies
when it fails to provide Saudi
Arabia, our single biggest oil
trading partner, with adequate
means to defend itself against
the threat? It is argued that
such aircarft endanger Israeli
air-security. That would be true
only if Arab airforces were as
strong as Israel's. This is not
and probably never will be the
case. Further, it is going to be a
cold day in hell before the Arab
world is ever sufficiently uni
fied to launch an invincible mili
tary attack on Israel.
It is claimed, nevertheless,
that the mere presence of
AWACS on the Saudi peninsula
is a destabilizing influence. Is
raeli military activity in Leba
non is a much bigger threat to
Middle Eastern peace than air

craft whose purpose is an essen
tially defensive one. The Saudis
need those aircraft to protect
themselves against their own
Arab enemies, not to attack Is
raeli adversaries.

Bomb force
Constance Kuruppu was in
correct in stating that "a one
megaton nuclear warhead
would have about 70 times the
explosive force of the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima" (Daily,
April 30). In terms of equivalent
megatonnage, a one-megaton
warhead would actually have
only about 17 times the ex
plosive force of the 14-kiloton
Hiroshima bomb.
