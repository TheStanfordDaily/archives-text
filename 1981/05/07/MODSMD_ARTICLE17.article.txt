## Give engineering students a break 
### 
One of the more popular
forms of discimination in
modern college society is
directed against students of en
gineering and science. The ster
eotype is one of an unhealthy ec
to'morph with palely luminous
green eyes (developed from ov
erexposure to computer termi
nals). On the belt is the übi
quitous calculator; in the pocket
an array of multicolored pens
and a pair of black plastic
glasses, and in the arms several
volumes of textbooks dealing
with subjects in which no nor
mal human could take an in
terest. This strange being lurks
eternally in the bowels of Term
an Engineering Center and
possesses a narrowly focused IQ
of 187 and a social value of
absolute zero (for you poets,
absolute zero is that theoretical
temperature at which
molecular motion ceases to ex
ist: -237 degrees Centigrade).
This unflattering stereotype
is a grossly unfair general
ization which should be applied
only, to electrical engineers and
computer scientists. Why are
engineers in general subject to
such scorn?
Every other field of study has
some image in which its stu
dents can take pride. English
majors have their tattered
tweeds and worn volumes of
Shakespeare.
Economists and political sci
entists can tell you why the hell
the world is in trouble (but not
how to correct it).
Philosophers can justify any
type of lifestyle by claiming it
as homework (Nihilism 101 is a
favorite course: no books, no
classes, no work, and three
hours credit).
Pre-meds, MBA's, and law
students are respected for their
academic diligence, personal
aloofness, and vast earning
potential.
Not the poor engineer. At
some point in nearly every par
ty, some mention will be made
ot art, literature, politics, or
sex. None of the first three sub
jects are covered in any engi
neering course at Stanford, and
if one's only contribution to a so
cial conversation is a detailed
description of the graphics soft
ware in a "Space Invaders"
game, the prospects tor the
fourth are very bleak. Speaking

trom a male's point of view (let
me qualify that — a heter
osexual male's point of view — I
forgot that this is Gay Aware
ness Week), it is much more
useful to be able to murmur
sweet nothings in iambic pen
tameter into the ear of an at
tractive female than it is to
whisper a description of a
Laplace transformation, no
matter how seductively the lat
ter is rendered. A French major
can try a little "Voulez
vous. . and an English major
"Shall I compare thee to a sum
mer's day?" — but no Fortran
statement, even if exquisitely
phrased by the hapless engi
neer, has ever won the heart and
soul of a romantic interest or
even gotten a date for lunch.
One of the less publicized
aspects ot the growing influx of
women into engineering fields
has been the dramatic improve
ment in the social life of the
male engineer. No longer must
he gaze alone at the night sky

and try to remember the in
nocence of youth, the long-dead
glow of idealistic passion, and
Avogadro's number. Now, to
gether. he and his loved one can
explore the mysteries of eternal
varieties such as faith, hope,
love, and differential equations.
It also makes those all-night
projects that much more fun to
work on.
There are no Pulitzer Prizes
or Academy Awards or such for
the typical engineer. Sure, there
are the Nobels for scientists
who clone frogs and take
snapshots of DNA, and Carl
Sagan had a hit TV show, and
some people watched the space
shuttle. But think of your sewers
— your showers — are you
grateful? Probably not — you
get mad when they don't work,
and that's the only time you no
tice them. Have you ever won
dered who figures out how to set
the timing on a traffic light? It's
someone's father or mother or
cousin, and all you do is scream

obscenities when it turns red
and you're late.
Admittedly, engineering is
not the most glamorous of pro
fessions, but all we ask is a
chance to fit in. The next time
you are at Tressider and you
meet some people and ask them
their majors and some say "Hu
man Relatedness" and others
say "Musical Truth"and then
one mumbles "Nuclear Power
Structures," give that last per
son a break even if he is wearing
three-day old socks, a "Con
struction Engineers Have Per
manent Erections" T-shirt, and
hasn't washed his hair since
before exams last quarter.
That's all we ask — give us a
break or we"ll turn off your
showers and TV sets and sewer
systems and stereos and high
ways and gas stations and ski
lifts and airplanes and. . .

dents can take pride. English
majors have their tattered
tweeds and worn volumes of
Shakespeare.
Economists and political sci
entists can tell you why the hell
the world is in trouble (but not
how to correct it).
Philosophers can justify any
type of lifestyle by claiming it
as homework (Nihilism 101 is a
favorite course: no books, no
classes, no work, and three
hours credit).
Pre-meds, MBA's, and law
students are respected for their
academic diligence, personal
aloofness, and vast earning
potential.
Not the poor engineer. At
some point in nearly every par
ty, some mention will be made
ot art, literature, politics, or
sex. None of the first three sub
jects are covered in any engi
neering course at Stanford, and
if one's only contribution to a so
cial conversation is a detailed
description of the graphics soft
ware in a "Space Invaders"
game, the prospects tor the
fourth are very bleak. Speaking

trom a male's point of view (let
me qualify that — a heter
osexual male's point of view — I
forgot that this is Gay Aware
ness Week), it is much more
useful to be able to murmur
sweet nothings in iambic pen
tameter into the ear of an at
tractive female than it is to
whisper a description of a
Laplace transformation, no
matter how seductively the lat
ter is rendered. A French major
can try a little "Voulez
vous. . and an English major
"Shall I compare thee to a sum
mer's day?" — but no Fortran
statement, even if exquisitely
phrased by the hapless engi
neer, has ever won the heart and
soul of a romantic interest or
even gotten a date for lunch.
One of the less publicized
aspects ot the growing influx of
women into engineering fields
has been the dramatic improve
ment in the social life of the
male engineer. No longer must
he gaze alone at the night sky

and try to remember the in
nocence of youth, the long-dead
glow of idealistic passion, and
Avogadro's number. Now, to
gether. he and his loved one can
explore the mysteries of eternal
varieties such as faith, hope,
love, and differential equations.
It also makes those all-night
projects that much more fun to
work on.
There are no Pulitzer Prizes
or Academy Awards or such for
the typical engineer. Sure, there
are the Nobels for scientists
who clone frogs and take
snapshots of DNA, and Carl
Sagan had a hit TV show, and
some people watched the space
shuttle. But think of your sewers
— your showers — are you
grateful? Probably not — you
get mad when they don't work,
and that's the only time you no
tice them. Have you ever won
dered who figures out how to set
the timing on a traffic light? It's
someone's father or mother or
cousin, and all you do is scream

obscenities when it turns red
and you're late.
Admittedly, engineering is
not the most glamorous of pro
fessions, but all we ask is a
chance to fit in. The next time
you are at Tressider and you
meet some people and ask them
their majors and some say "Hu
man Relatedness" and others
say "Musical Truth"and then
one mumbles "Nuclear Power
Structures," give that last per
son a break even if he is wearing
three-day old socks, a "Con
struction Engineers Have Per
manent Erections" T-shirt, and
hasn't washed his hair since
before exams last quarter.
That's all we ask — give us a
break or we"ll turn off your
showers and TV sets and sewer
systems and stereos and high
ways and gas stations and ski
lifts and airplanes and. . .

One of the more popular
forms of discimination in
modern college society is
directed against students of en
gineering and science. The ster
eotype is one of an unhealthy ec
to'morph with palely luminous
green eyes (developed from ov
erexposure to computer termi
nals). On the belt is the übi
quitous calculator; in the pocket
an array of multicolored pens
and a pair of black plastic
glasses, and in the arms several
volumes of textbooks dealing
with subjects in which no nor
mal human could take an in
terest. This strange being lurks
eternally in the bowels of Term
an Engineering Center and
possesses a narrowly focused IQ
of 187 and a social value of
absolute zero (for you poets,
absolute zero is that theoretical
temperature at which
molecular motion ceases to ex
ist: -237 degrees Centigrade).
This unflattering stereotype
is a grossly unfair general
ization which should be applied
only, to electrical engineers and
computer scientists. Why are
engineers in general subject to
such scorn?
Every other field of study has
some image in which its stu
dents can take pride. English
majors have their tattered
tweeds and worn volumes of
Shakespeare.
