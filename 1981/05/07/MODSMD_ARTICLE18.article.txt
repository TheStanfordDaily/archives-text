## Polyester beats dieting 
### 
Recently, I have become in
creasingly alarmed by my ten
dency, when viewed from be
hind, to resemble a giant pear. I
realized I was afflicted by "fat
phobia." I had suffered from
this disease in the past, but this
was my first really severe at
tack. So I decided to join the
scores of young American
females who, in their quest for a
thin body, voluntarily engage in
that wonderful pursuit known as
dieting. That was two weeks
ago. The other morning I woke
up dreaming of cottage cheese
and melba toast.
There are various types of
diets; some are actually even
sane. However, for the more in
tense dieter (the one who has to
fit into a particular pair of pants
by the weekend) there is the
crash diet, or, more ap
propriately, starvation. Women
following this plan can easily be
identified as they walk through
the dining room with celery
sticks on their plates. For the
big meal of the day they add an
olive or two. Caloric intakes of
500 per day are common, as is
the tendency for the dieter to
keel over and faint.
In addition to being unac
quainted with the concept of
moderation, I am somewhat of a
masochist, so I decided to go for
the starvation approach. My
new fear of resembling a Good-
Year Blimp was a more than
adequate incentive. I even re
solved not to "cheat," a process
where the dieter waits until the
coast is clear (i.e. there are no
witnesses) and rapidly engulfs
columns of Oreos or entire
cheesecakes.
Our society places 'an in
credible emphasis on weight.
Thin and thighless is the most
acceptable body type. Women
like myself aren't in danger of
being mistaken as pup tents, but
it's the fear of getting to that
stage that causes our panic.
Once we start gaining weight we

may never be able to stop. And
we all know what happens when
someone's really enormous —
"social misfit city."
We recall grade school,
where those of the heavier set
(commonly known as "fat
ties"), were excluded from
playground games. And as the
fatties got older and bigger, the
situation got worse. Doomed to
a life of polyester, as nothing
else comes in their size, they are
forced by clothing manufac
turers to emphasize their sepa
ration frqm the rest of society.
Fashion conscious high-school
and college students are well
aware of the limited selection of
"fal clothes." But women want
to be thin, not merely non-obese.
The desire to be too small to
donate blood motivates many a
female.
Aside from the obvious conse
quences of getting fewer party
invitations and dates, there are
more serious effects. Studies
have shown that people are
more disgusted by extremely
obese individuals than by those
unfortunates without arms or
legs. The tendency is to see the
fat person at fault. She became
heavy because she was too stu
pid to stop eating. People tend to
forget that under mounds of
flesh lie human beings with feel
ings. In our society, people as
sociate good qualities with
good-looking people, and the fat
person is immediately placed at
a disadvantage in social and
business situations.
The adults of society can
often trace their negative as
sociations with flesh abundance
to their upbringing. My moth
er's pointing at fat women and
whispering, "Keep eating and
one day you'll end up like that,"
as I ate an ice cream cone, or
commenting, "Just remember,
she was once your weight," did
much to instill a fear of being
heavy. I was taught to feel guil

ty when eating.
Even now when I eat a cookie
I hear a voice say, "Why bother
swallowing it, you might as well
just paste it directly onto your
thighs, that's where it's going
anyway." I've gradually grown
to hate those select few that eat
vast quantities without blowing
up like a balloon. But as one with
a normal metabolism I resigned
myself to life as a nqn-fat, but
also non-thin, person.
Suddenly, — I think it may
have been related to having to
put on a bikini to go sit in the
sun — I became obsessed with
becoming that reflection of
modern starvation and super
ficiality — a thin person. I still
knew that weight was super
ficial, and that it bore no rela
tion to my value as a human
being, but boy did I want to wear
a size five. So I succumbed to
my irrational instincts and
stopped eating. I didn't eat less,
I just didn't eat. A couple of car
rot sticks for lunch, a grapefruit
for dinner. With amazement I
found myself saying I was full
after eating two olives, and not
lying. I actually found myself
liking dry lettuce; I had an
authentic dieter's mentality. I
ignored the hunger pains, re
solved to win the battle against
fat. I was extremely proud of
my new will-power. After two
weeks, I weighed myself — I had
gained three pounds.
I looked incredulously at the
scale. It was physiologically im
possible for me to have gained
weight, but scales don't lie. It
was absolutely devastating.
Then and there I got fed up with
society's absurd obssession
with weight, and resolved my
self to life as a non-dieter.
Polyester here I come.

one day you'll end up like that,"
as I ate an ice cream cone, or
commenting, "Just remember,
she was once your weight," did
much to instill a fear of being
heavy. I was taught to feel guil

ty when eating.
Even now when I eat a cookie
I hear a voice say, "Why bother
swallowing it, you might as well
just paste it directly onto your
thighs, that's where it's going
anyway." I've gradually grown
to hate those select few that eat
vast quantities without blowing
up like a balloon. But as one with
a normal metabolism I resigned
myself to life as a nqn-fat, but
also non-thin, person.
Suddenly, — I think it may
have been related to having to
put on a bikini to go sit in the
sun — I became obsessed with
becoming that reflection of
modern starvation and super
ficiality — a thin person. I still
knew that weight was super
ficial, and that it bore no rela
tion to my value as a human
being, but boy did I want to wear
a size five. So I succumbed to
my irrational instincts and
stopped eating. I didn't eat less,
I just didn't eat. A couple of car
rot sticks for lunch, a grapefruit
for dinner. With amazement I
found myself saying I was full
after eating two olives, and not
lying. I actually found myself
liking dry lettuce; I had an
authentic dieter's mentality. I
ignored the hunger pains, re
solved to win the battle against
fat. I was extremely proud of
my new will-power. After two
weeks, I weighed myself — I had
gained three pounds.
I looked incredulously at the
scale. It was physiologically im
possible for me to have gained
weight, but scales don't lie. It
was absolutely devastating.
Then and there I got fed up with
society's absurd obssession
with weight, and resolved my
self to life as a non-dieter.
Polyester here I come.

Recently, I have become in
creasingly alarmed by my ten
dency, when viewed from be
hind, to resemble a giant pear. I
realized I was afflicted by "fat
phobia." I had suffered from
this disease in the past, but this
was my first really severe at
tack. So I decided to join the
scores of young American
females who, in their quest for a
thin body, voluntarily engage in
that wonderful pursuit known as
dieting. That was two weeks
ago. The other morning I woke
up dreaming of cottage cheese
and melba toast.
There are various types of
diets; some are actually even
sane. However, for the more in
tense dieter (the one who has to
fit into a particular pair of pants
by the weekend) there is the
crash diet, or, more ap
propriately, starvation. Women
following this plan can easily be
identified as they walk through
the dining room with celery
sticks on their plates. For the
big meal of the day they add an
olive or two. Caloric intakes of
500 per day are common, as is
the tendency for the dieter to
keel over and faint.
In addition to being unac
quainted with the concept of
moderation, I am somewhat of a
masochist, so I decided to go for
the starvation approach. My
new fear of resembling a Good-
Year Blimp was a more than
adequate incentive. I even re
solved not to "cheat," a process
where the dieter waits until the
coast is clear (i.e. there are no
witnesses) and rapidly engulfs
columns of Oreos or entire
cheesecakes.
Our society places 'an in
credible emphasis on weight.
Thin and thighless is the most
acceptable body type. Women
like myself aren't in danger of
being mistaken as pup tents, but
it's the fear of getting to that
stage that causes our panic.
Once we start gaining weight we

may never be able to stop. And
we all know what happens when
someone's really enormous —
"social misfit city."
We recall grade school,
where those of the heavier set
(commonly known as "fat
ties"), were excluded from
playground games. And as the
fatties got older and bigger, the
situation got worse. Doomed to
a life of polyester, as nothing
else comes in their size, they are
forced by clothing manufac
turers to emphasize their sepa
ration frqm the rest of society.
Fashion conscious high-school
and college students are well
aware of the limited selection of
"fal clothes." But women want
to be thin, not merely non-obese.
The desire to be too small to
donate blood motivates many a
female.
Aside from the obvious conse
quences of getting fewer party
invitations and dates, there are
more serious effects. Studies
have shown that people are
more disgusted by extremely
obese individuals than by those
unfortunates without arms or
legs. The tendency is to see the
fat person at fault. She became
heavy because she was too stu
pid to stop eating. People tend to
forget that under mounds of
flesh lie human beings with feel
ings. In our society, people as
sociate good qualities with
good-looking people, and the fat
person is immediately placed at
a disadvantage in social and
business situations.
The adults of society can
often trace their negative as
sociations with flesh abundance
to their upbringing. My moth
er's pointing at fat women and
