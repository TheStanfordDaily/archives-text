## Enriched-uranium cutoff will end plutonium controls for India plant 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi, India â€” India's Foreign Min
ister P.V Narasimha Rao last week in
dicated that his country was ready to accept
a Reagan administration suggestion to ter
minate the controversial enriched-uranium
supply agreement with the United States.
The move could lead to an end of any pos
sibility of U.S. control over spent nuclear
fuel sent to India over the last '8 years.
Department of State officials reportedly
suggested "an amicable termination"
earlier this month to the 30-year agreement
covering the supply of fuel to the American
built nuclear plant at Tarapur during India-
U.S. talks last month in Washington.
Speaking in Parliament about the Wash
ington talks, Rao said that only changes in
the .978 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act that
block continuation of the nuclear fuel could
save the agreement.
U.S. prohibiton
Under terms of the agreement, the U.S. is
prohibited from supplying nuclear fuel to
nations that have not signed the nuclear non
proliteration treaty and agreed to full in
ternational inspection of all nuclear facil
ities.
India, which is virtually self-sufficient in
nuclear technology, has consistently re
fused to accept such international inspec
tion.
Since the Nuclear Non-proliferatioji Act
was passed Tarapur fuel shipments have
been sporadic. Uncertainty of those sup
plies has been a constant irritant in Indo-
U.S. relations.

Last tall, the Senate voted narrowly to
permit shipment ot two 19.6-ton consign
ments of fuel for which India had formally
applied before the act went into torce.
Only one of those shipments has been re
ceived and Indian officials have expressed
doubt the second will come. "I am not sure
it is going to come," Rao told Parliament.
While countries appear to have ac
cepted early termination of the agreement
as the best alternative to end what one
American diplomat referred to as a "run
ning sore," there are sharp differences con
cerning control over the spent fuel already
supplied.
The U.S. contends the 1963 agreement
calls for joint Indo-U.S. determination on
handling the spent fuel. However, India
views the end of enriched-uranium
shipments as a de facto abrogation of the
agreement, which releases it from honoring
the joint determination commitment.
In the Parliament, Rao said that India's
intention to retain control over the spent
fuel was not negotiable.
Delicate Indo-American relations
Despite his hard line on Indian control of
the fuel, Rao expressed a desire that if the
agreement is ended, it should be done with
as little damage as possible to Indo-Ameri
can relations.
The next round of talks on the Tarapur
agreement, which will most likely focus on
terms of disengagement, is scheduled to be
held here sometime later this month.
Retaining at least partial control over the
spent fuel was a key argument in swaying

last tail's Senate vote that released the two
additional shipments to Tarapur.
During that debate, Sen. Charles Percy
(R-Ill.) said the spent fuel, currently stored
at Tarapur, gave India the potential to ac
quire 1000 kilograms of of plutonium if it de
cided to reprocess the fuel unilaterally.
An Indian nuclear tuel reprocessing
plant, also at Tarapur is technically capable
of extracting the plutonium trom the spent
tuel.
The plutonium, enough for 200 Hiroshima
type bombs, could conceivably be used in a
weapons development program.
The apparent decision to end the Tarapur
agreement and the possibility ot freeing
such a large supply of plutonium to India
coincides with growing speculation that In
dia may be preparing to explode its second
nuclear device in the Rajasthan desert.
Last month Minister ot State for Science
and Technology C.P.N. Singh told Par
liament the government would go ahead
with a peaceful nuclear explosion "it neces
sary."
A number ot recent reports purport ac
tivity around the Pokaran test site where In
dia exploded its first nuclear device in May
1974.
Following that explosion, India renunced
a weapons development program and has
publicly stood by that policy ever since.
However, regional instability plus fears
that neighboring Pakistan is preparing to
explode its own nuclear device sometime in
the next 18 months have triggered pressures
to alter that policy.
