# Commission joins ASSU in study of honor code
## 
### Richard Klingler 
During the next to last meeting of
the current ASSU Senate, the Senators
discussed the honor code with mem
bers of the Honor Code Commission
(HCC) and worked to conclude'this
year's business.
The HCC is designed to educate the
Stanford Community about the honor
code and its obligations. Mark Conroe,
a-member of the HCC, said the com
mission was "trying to find out what
students see as problems rather than
trying to legislate" in its appearance
before the Senate.
Sally Cole, Director of Research for
the Dean of Students and a member of
the HCC, completed a random poll of
students to determine the extent of
adherence to the honor code and said,
"as far as we can tell, ... the extent
of cheating has not changed in the last
fifteen years."
Some senators expressed concern
that neither students nor faculty
members understand the honor code.
Senator Clay Smith said, "perhaps
professors should read the honor code
aloud on the first day of class."
Other senators questioned fun
damental provisions of the code. Al
ternate Senator Jeff Bradach

challenged the section of the honor
code preventing faculty proctoring of
examinations. "If proctoring prevents
cheating, I see no reason tests
shouldn't be proctored."
Conroe responded by calling proc
toring "an insult" to students that
would indicate faculty distrust of stu
dents.
The senate also worked to finalize
this quarter's election. The senate is
establishing the basis for a special fall
election for students to reconsider un
successful fee assessments, according
to Senate Chair Doug Mitchell.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Marc Ventresca said, "one focus
of these last weeks should be to get
elections underway."
The senate deferred until next
week's meeting the approval of elec
tion results and the determination of
which of nine graduate students who
tied for alternate Senator positions
will fill the six remaining vacant
spots.
In addition. COP member Dick But
terfield and Financial Manager Steve
Davis outlined the progress of final re
views of the ASSU. Davis said a
