# S. Africa produces homemade fuel in nuclear breakthrough
## 
### Washington Post 
Johannesburg, South Africa
— South Africa has begun using
locally enriched uranium fuel in
its Safari I nuclear research re
actor following a refusal by the
United States to resupply it with
the required fuel.
Minister of Mineral and
Energy Affairs F.W. de Klerk
announced last week that South
Africa's U.S.-made research re
actor is now operating on South
African-made fuel elements of
45 percent enriched uranium.
The disclosure draws back
slightly the veil of secrecy South
Africa has put over its uranium
enrichment program.
The chairman of South
Africa's Atomic Energy Board,
Wynand de Villiers, said 45 per
cent enriched uranium could be
used to make a bomb but "ifr
would be a clumsy bomb."
Weapons-grade uranium is usu
ally above 90 percent. Having
reached the current level of en
richment, the South Africans
could, at great expense, go on to
higher levels.
The 45 percent enriched ura
nium is the lowest possible
grade on which the research re
actor can operate. Highly re
fined uranium is needed in re
search reactors to produce
isotopes for medical and other
investigations. The U.S.-sup
plied fuel was enriched to about
93 percent.
The U.S.-built reactor comes
under international safeguards

but South Africa has refused to
allow inspection of its pilot en
richment plant at Valindaba be
cause it claims to have de
veloped a unique process of en
richment and tears it will be dis
covered by other nations.
South Africa's revelation that
it has made enriched uranium
into fuel elements, a process
that requires considerable ef
fort and financial investment,
signals its determination not to
allow its atomic energy pro
gram to be jeopardized by in
ternational nuclear sanctions.
Public disclosure of the in
formation, which was made
known to representatives of the
International Atomic Energy
Agency on a visit here a few
weeks ago, comes as the United
States and South Africa are en
gaged in high-level diplomatic
exchanges to break an impasse
over supply of enriched uranium
for two nuclear power plants un
der construction here.
South Africa's refusal to sign
the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty or to allow inspection of
its enrichment facilities is hold
ing up plans for U.S. supply of
nuclear fuel for the power
plants at Koeberg near
Capetown. The topic is likely to
be on the agenda of South
African Foreign Minister
Roelof Botha when he meets
U.S. Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig in Washington May
14.
South Africa's announcement
that home-made fuel is being

used to run Safari I is out of
character with its usual reti
cence about disclosing develop
ments in its atomic energy pro
gram until forced by news leaks
to do so. It may be an attempt to
strengthen its bargaining posi
tion in the nuclear talks.
One South African said this
latest development might make
it "abundantly clear that this
pressure is counterproductive
as far as non-proliferation is
concerned. One should not deny
fuel or technology, because it is
counterproductive.'.'
Prodded by suspicions that
South Africa was developing
atomic weapons, the U.S. gov
ernment told Pretoria in late
1976 that unless it signed the Nu
clear Non-proliferation Treaty
and accepted inspection of its
pilot enrichment plant at Valin
daba it would not get any more
uranium for Safari I.
Since then, the South Africans
slowed down their atomic re
search program, which they say
is mainly aimed at medical
problems, in an effort to make
the remaining fuel for Safari I
last as long as possible. Over 18
months ago, Atomic Energy
Board Chairman De Villiers ad
mitted the reactor was operat
ing well below capacity. He said
last Wednesday that in recent
weeks it had operated only three
days every three weeks.
De Klerk said earlier that the
reactor will still only operate at
a quarter of its full capacity of
five megawatts.
