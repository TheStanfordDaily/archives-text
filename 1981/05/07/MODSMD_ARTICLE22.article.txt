# Anti-nuke group tackles European missile strategy

### Washington Post 
Groningen, The Netherlands
— A poster-sized portrait of a
Polaris nuclear missile, seen
from the bottom up so as to tow
er in silhouette against the sky,
hung on the wall ot a university
hall here last week as a back
drop for a conterence opposing
the spread of nuclear weapons.
The caption read: v Eax?h
Polaris submarine contains as
much firepower as was used
during World War II."
Stretched across the front of
the room were black and white
charts starkly depicting with
stick human figures (each fig
ure represented 2Q0.000 people)
the number who died in two
world wars and the enormously
many more who could die in a
nuclear conflict: approximately
140 million in the United States,
00 million in Europe and 113
million in the Soviet Union.
"We do think war is a stupid
way to settle international dif
ferences, and nuclear war
borders on insanity," said re
tired U.S. Rear Adm. Gene
Laßocque in an opening
statement to about 150 U.S. and
European anti-nuclear-war ex
perts and activists.
Laßocque is director of the
Washington-based Center tor
Defense Information, which,
along with the Dutch University
ot Groningen, sponsored the
conterence to highlight the pos
sibility of a nuclear war in Eu
rope — where Europeans in
creasingly tear the first nuclear
bombs may fall.

Heightened concern for the
likelihood ot nuclear war,
spurred by the continued
buildup of nuclear forces and
the stagnation of East-West
arms-control talks, has con
tributed to the revival of grass
roots campaigns for nuclear dis
armament in Western Europe
and, to a lesser extent, in the
United States. The meeting here
represented a first attempt to
ally U.S. and European efforts.
Block nuclear missiles
The immediate aim of the
campaign is to block Atlantic
Alliance plans to station new
U.S.-made medium-range Per
shing II and cruise nuclear mis
siles in Europe beginning late in
983 — a move deemed neces
sary by Western officials to off
set a buildup of Soviet SS-20 mis
siles.
Opposition to the mod
ernization plan is keenest in The
Netherlands. The Dutch Labor
Party, the country's largest po
litical party, is trying to get

disarmament in Western Europe.

back into government in na
tional elections this month by
running on a platform that re
jects a Western request that The
Netherlands take 48 of the 572
planned new missiles.
Conference organizers said
the meeting's timing and its lo
cation in The -Netherlands had
not been intended to influence
the election outcome. But U.S.
and NATO officials declined in
vitations to attend, possibly to
avoid the appearance of official
sanction.
Information
Several panels of military and
scientific experts offered what
amounted to an information
base tor a movement that is
often regarded by Western gov
ernment officials as being unin
formed and overly emotional in
its arguments. The two-day
meeting was billed as the first
authoritative public discussion
in Europe of the chances and ef
fects of a nuclear war.
Yet while all were in agree
ment on the need for action, the
conferees disagreed on how to
try to reverse what was general
ly seen as a world drift toward
nuclear war.
The argument outlined he,re is
this: The traditional strategy of
nuclear deterrence has led to a
sustained arms race. Arms-lim
itation talks have tailed.
Moreover, Western govern
ments have come to accept the
notion that a nuclear war could
be limited to certain targets or
regions. To this end. they are de
veloping more accurate weap
ons across a more flexible range
of options.
But such developments, say
the antinuclear campaigners,
only increase the risk of the fir
ing of an atomic weapon. In
fact, they say, a nuclear war
could not be contained or con
trolled once it broke out and
would inevitably result in im
mense destruction.
Western officials argue that
deterrence strategy and a

mutual East-West arms buildup
has at least had the advantage of
providing 35 years ot relative
world peace. Rejecting this,
Groningen Professor Hylke
Tromp quipped, "If you have
jumped from the Empire State
Building and are passing the
35th floor, you can't say you are
flying."
The explosive and radioactive
effects of nuclear explosions
were described in gruesome de
tail — an exercise in what
Herbert Scoville, former deputy
director ot the Central In
telligence Agency, termed
"consciousness-raising."
Doomsday imagery
But the doomsday imagery
seemed only to deepen what one
after another who rose from the
audience described variously as
despair, helplessness and
pessimism about the nuclear
threat. Bernhard Benson, a
writer who lives in Paris, said
the world today is divided be
tween "the 4 billion who don't

want to fry and the 200 playing
international chess" with nucle
ar weapons, though these 200,
Benson added, may not be happy
with the situation either.
Although the Soviets' recent
ly gained nuclear superiority in
Europe was noted, Western
plans to station new nuclear
missiles in Europe were seen as
another dangerous step in the
arms race. The problem for the
peace movement was presented
as how to block NATO deploy
ment without doing political
damage to the alliance.
Differences
This drew differences. The
major campaign groups — the
Interchurch Peace Council in
the Netherlands, the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament in
Britain, the environmental
"Green Party" and Campaign
for Atonement and Peace in
West Germany — favor unilat
eral renunciation of nuclear
weapons by smaller European
countries in hopes this will in
fluence the major powers to ne
gotiate limitations on their
weapons. They also are pressing
for the declaration of nuclear
free zones in Scandinavia or
southeast Europe and talk
vaguely about developing some
form of exchange between
Western Europe's peace move
ment and the movements for
civil, intellectual and trade
union rights in communist
Eastern Europe.
But unilateral moves are seen
by a minority within the peace
movement as upsetting alliance
solidarity and particularly en
dangering the pivotal but deli
cately balanced leadership of
West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt. This group
would rather stay with a multi
lateral approach and would urge
NATO to reconsider its missile
modernization decision in light
of growing opposition — a possi
bility recognized here as slim
given the current outlook of the
Reagan administration.

Tromp quipped, "If you have
jumped from the Empire State
Building and are passing the

The explosive and radioactive
effects of nuclear explosions
were described in gruesome de
tail — an exercise in what
Herbert Scoville, former deputy
director ot the Central In

"consciousness-raising."
Doomsday imagery
But the doomsday imagery
seemed only to deepen what one
after another who rose from the
audience described variously as
despair, helplessness and
pessimism about the nuclear
threat. Bernhard Benson, a
writer who lives in Paris, said
the world today is divided be
tween "the 4 billion who don't

want to fry and the 200 playing
international chess" with nucle
ar weapons, though these 200,
Benson added, may not be happy
with the situation either.
Although the Soviets' recent
ly gained nuclear superiority in
Europe was noted, Western
plans to station new nuclear
missiles in Europe were seen as
another dangerous step in the
arms race. The problem for the
peace movement was presented
as how to block NATO deploy
ment without doing political
damage to the alliance.
Differences
This drew differences. The
major campaign groups — the
Interchurch Peace Council in
the Netherlands, the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament in
Britain, the environmental
"Green Party" and Campaign
for Atonement and Peace in
West Germany — favor unilat
eral renunciation of nuclear
weapons by smaller European
countries in hopes this will in
fluence the major powers to ne
gotiate limitations on their
weapons. They also are pressing
for the declaration of nuclear
free zones in Scandinavia or
southeast Europe and talk
vaguely about developing some
form of exchange between
Western Europe's peace move
ment and the movements for
civil, intellectual and trade
union rights in communist
Eastern Europe.
But unilateral moves are seen
by a minority within the peace
movement as upsetting alliance
solidarity and particularly en
dangering the pivotal but deli
cately balanced leadership of
West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt. This group
would rather stay with a multi
lateral approach and would urge
NATO to reconsider its missile
modernization decision in light
of growing opposition — a possi
bility recognized here as slim
given the current outlook of the
Reagan administration.

Stretched across the front of
the room were black and white
charts starkly depicting with
stick human figures (each fig

the number who died in two
world wars and the enormously

nuclear conflict: approximately
140 million in the United States,
00 million in Europe and 113
million in the Soviet Union.
"We do think war is a stupid
way to settle international dif
ferences, and nuclear war
borders on insanity," said re
tired U.S. Rear Adm. Gene
Laßocque in an opening
statement to about 150 U.S. and
European anti-nuclear-war ex
perts and activists.
Laßocque is director of the
Washington-based Center tor
Defense Information, which,
along with the Dutch University
ot Groningen, sponsored the
conterence to highlight the pos
sibility of a nuclear war in Eu
rope — where Europeans in
creasingly tear the first nuclear
bombs may fall.

Heightened concern for the
likelihood ot nuclear war,
spurred by the continued
buildup of nuclear forces and
the stagnation of East-West
arms-control talks, has con
tributed to the revival of grass
roots campaigns for nuclear dis
armament in Western Europe
and, to a lesser extent, in the
United States. The meeting here
represented a first attempt to
ally U.S. and European efforts.
Block nuclear missiles
The immediate aim of the
campaign is to block Atlantic
Alliance plans to station new
U.S.-made medium-range Per
shing II and cruise nuclear mis
siles in Europe beginning late in
983 — a move deemed neces
sary by Western officials to off
set a buildup of Soviet SS-20 mis

back into government in na
tional elections this month by
running on a platform that re
jects a Western request that The
Netherlands take 48 of the 572
planned new missiles.
Conference organizers said
the meeting's timing and its lo
cation in The -Netherlands had
not been intended to influence
the election outcome. But U.S.
and NATO officials declined in
vitations to attend, possibly to
avoid the appearance of official
sanction.
Information
Several panels of military and
scientific experts offered what
amounted to an information
base tor a movement that is
often regarded by Western gov
ernment officials as being unin
formed and overly emotional in
its arguments. The two-day
meeting was billed as the first
authoritative public discussion
in Europe of the chances and ef
fects of a nuclear war.
Yet while all were in agree
ment on the need for action, the
conferees disagreed on how to
try to reverse what was general
ly seen as a world drift toward
nuclear war.
The argument outlined he,re is
this: The traditional strategy of
nuclear deterrence has led to a
sustained arms race. Arms-lim
itation talks have tailed.
Moreover, Western govern
ments have come to accept the
notion that a nuclear war could
be limited to certain targets or
regions. To this end. they are de
veloping more accurate weap
ons across a more flexible range
of options.
But such developments, say
the antinuclear campaigners,
only increase the risk of the fir
ing of an atomic weapon. In
fact, they say, a nuclear war
could not be contained or con
trolled once it broke out and
would inevitably result in im
mense destruction.
Western officials argue that
deterrence strategy and a

mutual East-West arms buildup
has at least had the advantage of
providing 35 years ot relative
world peace. Rejecting this,
Groningen Professor Hylke
Tromp quipped, "If you have
