## Heart, sex, and intelligence: Eye Protection plays what lasts 
### Don Willenburg 
There's nothin' wrong with
being an average guy. We won
the Second World War, didn't
we?
— Andy Prieboy
There is definitely nothing av
erage about Eye Protection.
The combination of five outstan
ding musicians (plus an occa
sional horn section), a reper
toire of complex, clever, and
highly creative songs, and the
manic energy of lead singer and
songwriter Andy Prieboy is
proof that inventiveness can be
fun. Bay Area audiences no
longer need settle for either the
aural pablum of bands that
sound all too much like Pablo

Cruise or the tired, angst-ridden
ravings of most local new
wavers. Eye Protection on
stage is enough to confirm any
one's faith that rock and roll can
be entertaining without being
simplistic, and accessible
without being formulaic.
This is hardly a standard en
terprise in an age when most
bands are looking for the safety
of a packaged, easily recog
nizable "sound" designed to
make it easy to identify the ar
tist without ever before having
heard the song. The Cars and
Boston are prime it different ex
amples of this formulaic ap
proach. Bands usually do not
dare to experiment or diversify

until they have already reached
some measure of acceptance
and success.
"Yes, but where are the Cars
going to be in five years?" asks
Prieboy. He believes the band's
diversity will be a positive asset
among both audiences and nor
mally conservative record com
panies. Further, their more con
sidered and perfectionist ap
proach will lend the musical
product and the band itself more
longevity than trendier but
more limited efforts. "We don't
want to make music just for
people to French kiss in the back
seat to. We want to make music
people can eventually fuck to,
fall in love listening to."

Prieboy believes that success
at this level demands a more
and Sophisticated approach
than commercial formula al
lows. "You don't have to sell
out, you just have to be smart. If
you look at successful acts like
the Who or the Sex Pistols, they
manage to put intelligence,
heart, sex, all three into their
music. Some guys are content
remaining at the,genital level.
We're looking to play in
telligent, clever songs with lots
of changes that still hit at a tes
ticle rock and roll level."
Eye Protection's refusal to
eviscerate their material by
making each song sound alike
goes clearly against the grain of

the conventional wisdom and
experience of postpunk New
Wave. The collapse of punk rock
left few barriers or guidelines
for a postpunk generation of lis
teners and musicians who feel
that there are valid musical re
sponses to society other than en
nui or spite. There remained
only a perfervid defiance of
form and convention in music
and in art as a business en
terprise. New Wave trans
formed this defiance into a
wholesale exploitation of tradi
tional musical idioms, not with
a spirit of revivalism but almost
ex nihilo, reconstituting the
drive and energy afresh after
the rebellious, inchoate ex
pressionism of the punk assault
on form and sensibility.
More often than not, the idi
oms exploited by New Wave
bands have been those familiar
to the adolescence of the New
Waver's older siblings, whether
taking the form of rockabilly
turned rock and roll a la Buddy
Holly or the lavish, wall of
sound production techniques of
Phil Spector. The result has be
come a smooth sound as attuned
to the dreams and disappoint
ments of teenagers in love as it
is ignorant of the social and cul
tural holocaust treasured by
punks.
All too often, spirit and in
novation gave way to sentiment
and formula. When the new mu
sic lost its anger, it lost its ex
perimentation.
While Eye Protection accepts
the postpunk convention of bas
ing many of their songs on pre
established patterns, the pat
terns they exploit are not the
stock-in-trade New Wave
throwbacks to days when fock
was young and Vietnam written
not as one word but two.
Instead, an Eye Protection
performance is rock in the
cabaret. What bands like Yes,
Genesis, and Emerson, Lake &

Palmer did tor the introduction
of classical feeling, composi
tion, and nuance to rock, Eye
Protection does for Broadway
and New Wave.
This isn't to say they can't
rock out at will. They led off a
recent show at the Old Waldorf
with 'the saxophone intro to
"Rhapsody in Blue," passed
into an "In Crowd" sung by
Prieboy with all the petulant
nastiness of a newly-popular 14-
year-old in a clique-ridden jun
ior high, and proceeded into
some of the tightest rock and
roll the Waldorf has heard. This,
in the first song of the set?
Through competent and judi
cious arranging, the band seems
able to grasp an idiom for effect
and discard it at will. Rockers
like 'Annalena" and "Average
Guy" spund like album cuts
from the Band and the Who. At
the same time, the audience is
made well aware that this- is
done not from adulation but a
wry iconoclasm, and that
Prieboy and the band are using
the sounds they create for theat
ric as well as musical effect.
On a large stage like that at
the Old WaldoH, Prieboy is pure
energy, constantly running
from one side of the stage to the
other and, not infrequently, into
other band members. Not con
tent to merely sing, he acts out
the lyrics — whether playing a
21st century spy in "Elroy Jet
son" or donning a Chicago
gangster hat and demeanor dur
ing the opening, "Un
touchables" — sounding strains
of "Honeymooning Honeys (Hi
De Ho)."
On smaller stages, Prieboy
concentrates this energy and ex
pressiveness, making use of the
available space the way a mime
uses the imagination of the au
dience. He uses his voice and
body — especially his face and
hands — to tell the story by pull
ing it out of the audience. We

needn't fret about being aver
age guys, he tells us, and he
hardly needs to convince the
predominantly young crowds
that there's no difference be
tween the KGB at the Berlin
Wall and the bouncers at the
door when they demand your
"ID."
Prieboy s antic posturing is
not so much backed as made
possible by the band's con
siderable musical ability. John
Maxwell on guitar, Terry Gahan
on bass, and Steve Siegrist on
keyboards and arranging some
how manage to handle the
changes within and between
songs while keeping a con
sistently high level of energy
and intensity. The sure, steady,
and superlative drumming of
Ed Berman, formerly with No
Sisters, gives the band a secure
rhythmic base that allows them
freedom to experiment and play
games.
There are special advantages
and challenges to playing out
side San Francisco, where a
regular schedule has exposed
many audiences to Eye Protec
tion's style and character.
"They expect longer sets, so we
get to play longer as a band,"
says Berman. "That's more fun
for us."
Prieboy agrees, and relishes
the opportunity to confront new
audiences. "When we're in the
city, audiences are more famil
iar with our act. Here, we have
to reach out and try to connect
with audiences who haven't
seen us before."
Playing before the uninitiated
helps the band hone their abili
ties and keeps them in touch
with the central challenge of ar
tistic endeavor. "Everyone —
religious leaders, politicians,
etc. — all have to find a way to
reach people, and that's what
we're trying to do. There's a
lock, and all you have to do is
find the key."
