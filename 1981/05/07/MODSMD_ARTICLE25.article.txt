# Everything you ever wanted to know about the Roches... they won't tell

Who are The Roches?
Let them explain:
We are, Maggie an d Terre and
Suzzy,
Maggie and Terre and Suzzy
Roche
We don't give out our ages,
and we don't give out our
phone numbers
Sometimes our voices give
out,
But not our ages or our phone
numbers.
yet to see their
voices give put. Their ages, on
the other hand, are in the 20s,
and their phone numbers all be
gin with the 212 area code.
But let them explain:
We come from DEEP-est
New Jersey (deedle-deedle
dee)
But now we live in New
Yooork City.
We better get out of there
Before the shit hits the tan
Shi-it hits the ta-an.
Only three sisters from New
Jersey could come up with that.
Three very weird and talented
sisters. Not a Zeppo in the
bunch.
They aren't punk. They aren't
exactly folk either. They're just

The Roches, and that defies con
ventional labels. They have
some of the startling originality
that people must have recog
nized in Bob Dylan when he first
emerged, but, thank God, none
of his apocalyptic self-seri
ousness.
The Roches can (and do)
write beautifully serious and re
flective songs. They can also
display a wonderfully quirky
sense of humor by writing about
the little ridiculous incidents
that fill in between our lives'
Big Moments: laundromats,
commuter trains, and straw
berry-apricot pie. They have
both the perception and ir
resistability of precocious chil
dren : whether tunny or serious,
they haven't forgotten what re
ally counts.
The crowd at the Boarding
House last night was composed
of several hundred very in
dulgent parents. Every joke and
every clever lyric was roundly
applauded. Appropriately, The
Roches seemed to have gotten
into Mummy's clothing closet.
All three sides of the Roche per
sonality were clearly repre
sented: there was Maggie in a
tolky outfit and flat shoes, Terre"
playing the vamp in a pink satin
low-cut dress (undercut by
shocking bright green stock
ings), and Suzzy, who is, well,
Suzzy — in feathers and gym
shorts, which she, as the
youngest, informed us were ac
tually diapers. ("I'm very

wet," she confided innocently at
one moment.) Their penchant
for one-of-a-kind outfits ex
presses one of the central ax
ioms of the Roches: although
sisters, they exhibit an individ
ualism that carries over to ev
erything — their singing styles
and ranges, their guitar
playing, and most of all their
lyrics.
Maggie — the oldest, the best
songwriter, and the backbone of
the group — is shy and retiring
to the point of saying nothing on
stage (Suzzy claimed she was an
Ellen Jamesian, nearly, but not
quite provoking her to reply).
Her voice is low and solid. Suzzy
is outrageous: she keeps time
by drumming on a paperback
Jack Kerouac book and
scratches herself in places
young ladies aren't supposed to.
Her voice is high — she sings
most of the leads — and at turns
clear or whiny, depending on
what she's singing. Terre, de
spite her taste for baseball out
fits, is perhaps the most normal
of the three. Her voice has the
huskiness of a 9 to 5 recep
tionist. Three sisters, three indi
viduals: they make the perfect
ensemble.
The Roches' music is essen
tially folk-based: there's a lot of
acoustic guitar strumming, but
a smattering of jazz phrasings
make it much more interesting
than the trite stuff churned out
by most dyed-in-the-wool folk

ies. If you know your music,
you'll realize that they make
great use of 3/4 rhythms and
syncopation; if you don't, you'll
recognize that they really know
how to phrase things like
'' before the shit hits the fan" tor
maximal expressiveness.
The entire stage appearance
ot The Roches is disarming. The
costumes, though I suspect that
they wear the same clothes to
the grocery store and the laun
dromat, the posing, and the
comments like "I hope you're
all happy with what you wore to
night," are a set up for the col
lectively petulant and direct
Roche personality. Their lyrics
cover a whole range of day-to
day problems: coping with the
laundromat, wondering about
the fat man sharing the seat in
the commuter train, and fearing
for baggage at the airport. In
"Mr. Sellack" Suzzy begged to
be given her old job back, even
promising to scrub behind the
steam tables. Terre was con
vinced that the clarinet player
in "Bobby's Song" had eyes only
tor her. and Maggie refused a
prospective lover in one of the
new songs. There are no self-im
portant pronouncements a la
Dylan, here, just quiet revel
ations. This is what lite is all
about, afterall; everybody is
trying to cope with the same in
anities, and that a sense of hu
mor is essential if we're to stay
sane. The Roches present music
and lyrics you can think about.

The meanings aren't obscure
and mystical, they're clear af
ter the first listening or two, but
what they say seems so sen
sible, so in tune with the com
plications involved in trying to
get by, that you find yourself lis
tening again and again, and en
joying them more each time.
The real secret of The
Roches, however, is to be found
in their classic acappella ver
sion of Handel's "Hallelujah

Chorus." They camp through
the excerpt, vamping at the
mikes, snapping their fingers in
time, and generally cutting up.
But if you shut your eyes, you'll
hear that the vocals are pure,
clear, and in amazing three-part
harmonies. It's in numbers like
this that you realize just how
good The Roches are. In their
less serious songs their stage
personas reflect what a typical
dinner in the Roche household in

1958 must have been like (snig
gers, look-at-me stunts, and
wide-eyed stares), but what
they create and the way in
which they create it is
astonishing — so astonishing
that they can aftord to make fun
ot their talent and their materi
al and still overwhelm you. So
when you see The Roches, pause
amid the flying Gerber's, shut
your eyes, listen and reflect:
these little brats can sing.


Suzzy, Maggie and Terre Roche.
