# Reality: T.V. grapples with a new concept
## 
### Geoffrey Mandel 
Since the invention of television in
1946, our planet has been a bright beacon
in the cosmos, broadcasting noisily at
frequencies which any self-respecting al
ien civilization should be able to receive
and decode. Episodes of Starsky and
Hutch are now whizzing past Alpha Cen
tauri at the speed of light. I Dream of
■Jrannie will soon reach Sirius. and I
Ixwe Lucy may already be disappearing
down some distant black hole If anyone
out there is listing to what we've been
broadcasting on commercial television
(I'm assuming that Masterpiece
Theatre and ,\'nva would be received
with quiet applause anywhere in the
universe i. they have long since decided
that our culture is one based on medi
ocrity. and alien viewers who have been
monitoring our transmissions may al
ready have flicked off their receivers in
disgust, angrily muttering that you count
the number of decent Earth programs on
the fingers of one tentacle Even if they
had entertained some fleeting hope for
Earth after tuning in on episodes of Star
Trek, MASH or All In the Family, there

was always one more rerun of Hogan's
limn* or (Oilman's Island to contend
with
The sad truth is that most good shows
soon crumble under the pressure of a
weekly production schedule, and rare in
deed is the show that can maintain good
scripts, good acting, and good production
values tor more than a season or two.
Even Hod Serling. much loved for Tui
liuht / me freely admitted that a third
ot the shows were only mediocre, and a
third were real dogs.
But if our extraterrestrial audience
has managed to sit through Hello. I.arry
and That's Incredible, they may now be
getting a pleasant surprise on Tuesday
evenings at 9 p m for the first time in re
cent history, there is a dramatic prime
time show with a conventional format
and subject matter that is actually worth
watching.
Hill Street Blue- is a police show.
That's already one strike against it. as
the only police show that's been even
moderately entertaining since the unin
tentionally hilarious Dragnet has been
Police Stnry. an anthology series with no

continuing characters. Hill Street does
have a regular cast, and the first big sur
prise is that none of them are recog
nizable from other shows: the series has
a cast ot 10 or 12 new taces. and you won't
find an Erik Estrada or a Kate Jackson
in the bunch Second big surprise: there
are no "central'' characters Almost ev
eryone gets equal time on the screen,
with the possible exception ot Frank
Furillo (Daniel J Travanti), the soft
spoken captain of the Hill Street Pre
cinct The other characters include
Frank's ex-wife Fay (Barbara Bosson),
his current main squeeze (Veronica
Hamel). a sergeant Micahel Conrad who
is fond of quoting pop psychology and
saying "be careful out there." and sever
al teams of patrolmen There is also a
constant stream ot grungy-looking guest
stars, who t third big surprise > re-appear
from .week to week In fact, everything
re-appears from week to week, just like
in real life Two officers are shot in one
episode, and slowly recover over the next
three or four episodes. Wonder of won
ders it takes time for them to lick their
wounds, overcome their fear of the
street, and to hunt down the gunman.
Finally, after seven episodes and a mis
taken suspect, they track down the right
guy. Time elapsed on the show: eight
weeks. Although you keep waiting for the
loose endings to neatly tie together,
things just never work out that way: a
prisoner commits suicide for no reason,
a juvenile delinquent can't be trans
ferred to a foster home after all, and Of
ficer Laßue never does overcome his
drinking problem. These are real people,
dammit, and they get drunk, goof off.

ters who look like thev've been hired off

the streets of New York rather than in a
Hollywood casting call
The atmosphere of Hill Street Station
is exactly right, a dingy army-barracks
type of place where nothing works the
way it's supposed to Hill Street itself is a
rotten neighborhood in qn unspecified
Northeastern city, and the streets ot
the hill" are shockingly realistic: the
show doesn't shy away from such un
pleasantries as junkies, prostitution,
bums freezing to death in the night, or vi
cious racial slurs exchanged between ri
val gangs.
It's not a terribly pleasant world, but
it's relentlessly fascinating, and the
scripts, by the magical team of Steven
Bocho and Michael Kozell, rank with the
best grittv police movies you've seen So
many little things ring true — in
terchanges between Frank and his ex
wife. Officer Belker's problems with his
new girlfriend — that you find yourself
helplessly identifying with these police
men. who are a basically good sort if not
particularly intelligent or imaginative,
and who are somehow devoted to police
work despite the crazy paradox of pro
tecting a public that resents their pres
ence.
This show is not only a pleasant sur
prise, it's extraordinary — something
this good can't stay on the air for long,
and although NBC renewed it for next
season, the show will sooner or later fall
victim to corporate paranoia unless the
ratings improve. Although Stanford stu
dents are not supposed to watch tele
vision (for one thing, it's free), do your
self, and Hill Street Blues, a favor —
turn on your set at nine o'clock this Tues
day night. You won't regret it.
