# Pure Prairie League bucks country for a.m. innocuousness
## 
### David Schmelzer 
A name like Pure Prairie
League labels a group from the
start. A band by that name could
never sing a hard rock number
like "Satisfaction." An au

dience wouldn't accept them it
they ran out with orange hair
and did new-wave music. And
yet after ten years of trying to
make it, Pure Prairie League
has chosen to break from their

country style. Those ten years
produced only one hit single.
"Amy." and even that was a
success only after they re-re
leased it three years after the
original. RCA dropped them for
awhile; band members were
more like boarders as they
came and lett. and none of their
albums sold overly well. The
three band members that stuck
it out — Michael Rielly. Billy
Hinds, and Michael Connor —
were no fools; they saw a trend
developing. So began phase
two of Pure Prairie League.
This brought in new members
Vince Gill and Jeff Wilson, and
gave them almost total artistic
control. On the last two Pure
Praire League albums, they
wrote every song but three
i which were composed -by peo
ple outside the group ) and Gill
sung every lead vocal. With
them came a new style and em
phasis for the band. On Firin'
I'p, their last album and the
first with both of these new
comers contributing, the
League went from being a coun
try group to being a pop group
that threw in an occasional
country number. And on their
new one, Something in the
Sight, they drop the country
facade almost entirely, keeping
its flavor on only a few numbers
and eliminating all straight
country songs.
This move has helped the
group in a lot of ways. Both Gill
and Wilson .have an ear for boun

cy, commercial tunes and
they've brought the group more
popular success than it has ever
had. Last year's "Let Me Love
You Tonight" was their first hit
since "Amy" and their current
"Still Right Here In My Heart"
is moving up the charts. But the
nature ot their new style
ensures that they will never be
more than an agreeable. unex
ceptional band. An issue of
HAM magazine ot a tew months
ago devoted itself to rock
critics, one of whom said that he
broke artists into two catego
ries: those that were active and
those that were passive. The
first types, the Elvis Presleys
and such, did something to ad
vance music, and the second,
the Pat Boones. did not. The new
Pure Prairie League is a quin
tessentially passive group of the
eighties.
Something in the Night
doesn't have any obviously bad
songs. Its spectrum ranges not
from "terrible" to "in
credible," but from "not bad"
to "pretty good," which makes
it a difficult album to comment
on. Among the pretty good songs
are "Do You Love Me Truly,
Julie?" and "Feel the Fire,"
which are at least slightly dif
ferent in style from the rest of
the numbers. The first is a 50s
stvle rocker that, like most
songs from that time, is an up
beat, "fun" song. Gill wrote it to
include some jamming piano
and guitar, so, while a very
simple song, it has enough spirit

to make it stand out.
"Feel the Fire" is noticeable
for the opposite reason. It's still
bouncy, but it's about as dark
and mysterious as Pure Praire
League will ever get.
The rest of the songs on the
album, particularly "Still Right

Here in my Heart." "You're
Mine Tonight," and "Hold On to
Our Hearts," are very much
children from a conservative
family. They differ as individ
uals but are still similar in ost
general senses: They all have
gently rolling beats, messages

about keeping a love, and solo
vocals from Gill.
The League is no longer a
struggling country band, but it
hasn't made a particularly dar
ing step to anything else. It's
good in a professional sense, but
not good in an original sense.
