# Seniors' survey evaluates academia
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
Relatively few of last year's seniors
believed that their ability to write
English improved much during their
years at Stanford, according to the re
sults of last year's annual Senior Sur
vey.
The survey, conducted by the dean
of undergraduate studies, is dis

tributed every spring to graduating
seniors. The seniors rate their under
graduate program, interactions with
faculty and staff, and current ability
in various academic areas on an
absolute scale and on a scale of im
portance to the student. They are also
asked to evaluate the degree of im
provement they felt they had gained in

certain academic areas while at Stan
ford.
Last year's seniors gave the faculty
high marks as scholars and re
searchers, with 95 percent of the re
sponses at the high end of the scale.
But faculty teaching was rated much
lower: only 56 percent of the re
sponses were "good" or "excellent"
while 11 percent were "poor" or "very
poor". Many students (44 percent)
said that the teaching ability of the
faculty was "worse" or "much
worse" than their ofrignial expecta
tions had anticipated.
Seniors also indicated dissatisfac
tion with their freshman advisers, as
46 percent rated them "poor" or
"very poor" and 58 percent said these
advisers were "worse" or "much
worse" than they had expected. But
ratings for major advisors was con
siderably more positive.
School groupings
The survey grouped the majors into
five "schools"; engineering, human
ities, social sciences, natural sci
ences, and interdepartmental pro
grams.
Students majoring in humanities
departments gave the highest overall
ratings to various aspects of their
coursework and to their experiences
within their major departments.
Nearly all of them (85 percent) rated
the courses in their major as "good"
or "excellent" and most (69 percent)
rated the faculty highly as teachers.
Natural science majors gave the
lowest overall ratings, with only 59
percent of the students giving their
major department high ratings and
only 43 percent giving the faculty in
these departments high ratings as
teachers.
Engineering majors rated their de
partment courses and advisers rela
tively highly; but gave the lowest over
all ratings to the faculty as teachers
(39 percent ,as "good" or "ex
cellent").
Mixed evaluations
Social science and interdepartmen
tal majors gave mixed evaluations,
with high ratings given to their major
courses and general faculty teaching
quality, but low evaluations given to
their major advisers.
Humanities, social science, and in
terdepartmental major gave relative
ly low ratings to the adequacy of their
training for graduate or professional
school (59 percent in the top two cate
gories), while natural science and en
gineering majors gave the higfrtest re
sponses (79 percent and 80 percent).
But Humanities and social science
majors felt they received the most
well rounded liberal education (71 per
cent and 79 percent in the top catego
ries), while engineering and natural
trend toward working full-time as op
posed to studying full-time after grad
uation. In r 975 , 28 percent of the sen
iors surveyed said they planned to
work full-time immediately alter
graduation. Last year that number
had risen to 52 percent.
Long-term goals
It is also notable that women were
more likely to work full-time after
graduation than were men (57 to 47
percent). But students have not low
ered their long-term educational
goals: 85 percent of the 1980 senior
class said they eventually planned to
attend graduate or professional
school.
Surveys are mailed to all seniors
and this year's class should have al
ready received theirs, according to
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian. He said sen
iors should return them in the stamped
envelope enclosed in the survey.
The results of last year's survey is
published every spring in Campus Re
ports.
Dean Katchadourian said the sur
vey "is a way of taking the tem
perature of each graduating class and
alerting us to the strengths and weak
nesses ol our programs and faculty. It
has been very useful in bringing under
graduate education to people's atten
tion."

science majors felt much less satis
fied in this area (40 percent and 53 per
cent).
When the results of these surveys
are compared with results from the
past two years, there is a definite

Relatively few of last year's seniors
believed that their ability to write
English improved much during their
years at Stanford, according to the re
sults of last year's annual Senior Sur
vey.
The survey, conducted by the dean
of undergraduate studies, is dis

tributed every spring to graduating
seniors. The seniors rate their under
graduate program, interactions with
faculty and staff, and current ability
in various academic areas on an
absolute scale and on a scale of im
portance to the student. They are also
asked to evaluate the degree of im
provement they felt they had gained in

certain academic areas while at Stan
ford.
Last year's seniors gave the faculty
high marks as scholars and re
searchers, with 95 percent of the re
sponses at the high end of the scale.
But faculty teaching was rated much
lower: only 56 percent of the re
sponses were "good" or "excellent"
while 11 percent were "poor" or "very
poor". Many students (44 percent)
said that the teaching ability of the
faculty was "worse" or "much
worse" than their ofrignial expecta
tions had anticipated.
Seniors also indicated dissatisfac
tion with their freshman advisers, as
46 percent rated them "poor" or
"very poor" and 58 percent said these
advisers were "worse" or "much
worse" than they had expected. But
ratings for major advisors was con
siderably more positive.
School groupings
The survey grouped the majors into
five "schools"; engineering, human
ities, social sciences, natural sci
ences, and interdepartmental pro
grams.
Students majoring in humanities
departments gave the highest overall
ratings to various aspects of their
coursework and to their experiences
within their major departments.
Nearly all of them (85 percent) rated
the courses in their major as "good"
or "excellent" and most (69 percent)
rated the faculty highly as teachers.
Natural science majors gave the
lowest overall ratings, with only 59
percent of the students giving their
major department high ratings and
only 43 percent giving the faculty in
these departments high ratings as
teachers.
Engineering majors rated their de
partment courses and advisers rela
tively highly; but gave the lowest over
all ratings to the faculty as teachers
(39 percent ,as "good" or "ex
cellent").
Mixed evaluations
Social science and interdepartmen
tal majors gave mixed evaluations,
with high ratings given to their major
courses and general faculty teaching
quality, but low evaluations given to
their major advisers.
Humanities, social science, and in
terdepartmental major gave relative
ly low ratings to the adequacy of their
training for graduate or professional
school (59 percent in the top two cate
gories), while natural science and en
gineering majors gave the higfrtest re
sponses (79 percent and 80 percent).
But Humanities and social science
majors felt they received the most
well rounded liberal education (71 per
cent and 79 percent in the top catego
ries), while engineering and natural
trend toward working full-time as op
posed to studying full-time after grad
uation. In r 975 , 28 percent of the sen
iors surveyed said they planned to
work full-time immediately alter
graduation. Last year that number
had risen to 52 percent.
Long-term goals
It is also notable that women were
more likely to work full-time after
graduation than were men (57 to 47
percent). But students have not low
ered their long-term educational
goals: 85 percent of the 1980 senior
class said they eventually planned to
attend graduate or professional
school.
Surveys are mailed to all seniors
and this year's class should have al
ready received theirs, according to
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian. He said sen
iors should return them in the stamped
envelope enclosed in the survey.
The results of last year's survey is
published every spring in Campus Re
ports.
Dean Katchadourian said the sur
vey "is a way of taking the tem
perature of each graduating class and
alerting us to the strengths and weak
nesses ol our programs and faculty. It
has been very useful in bringing under
graduate education to people's atten
tion."

science majors felt much less satis
fied in this area (40 percent and 53 per
cent).
When the results of these surveys
are compared with results from the
past two years, there is a definite
