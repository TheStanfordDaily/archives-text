Reagan scraps commission
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has
abolished the judicial nominating commissions de
signed by former president Jimmy Carter to
broaden the base for picking appointments to the na
tion's courts of appeals.
Reagan rescinded the executive orders establish
ing the panels on Tuesday without any official an
nouncement. Thomas DeCair, a Justice Department
spokesman, said yesterday that administration of
ficials telt the commissions weren't needed to fill
the nine vacancies now existing in the federal ap
pellate courts. A long-term selection mechanism
hasn't been agreed on yet, he added
When President Carter and Attorney General
Griffin Bell set up the commissions for the 1'
circuits in : 978. it was seen as an effort to take the
patronage plum away from members of the Senate
who traditionally recommended political sup
porters for the prestigious posts. During his term.
Carter named 56 of the 132 federal appellate judges.
Bell got Sen. James Eastland (D-Miss.) then
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to
agree to have senators use the presidentially ap
pointed commissions to find appeals court judges.
Senators kept their powerful voice in selecting Dis
trict Court judge nominees from their states.
Ann Macrory, a Washington attorney who
monitored the Carter process tor the Judicial Selec
tion Project, said yesterday she was disappointed
but not surprised by the Reagan administration's
action. "It looks like we're right back to square one.
to total Senate control, with all the progress out the
window." she said.
Critics of the Carter program noted that the selec
tion commissions were often packed with Carter
convention delegates or friends, and that 99 percent
of those recommended were Democrats.
House Democrats support cuts
Washington — House Speaker Thomas O'Neill,
taced with almost certain defeat in efforts to cut off
an administration-backed budget blueprint, is
pleading with divided Democrats not to "run into
the woods" simply because they fear President
Ronald Reagan's popularity.
Reagan, taking no chances on a last-minute slip in
support, was putting his popularity to work right up
to the vote, now expected today. Fifty-one House
members have been brought to the White House for
face-to-face chats with the president, with another
dozen due today.
An Associated Press survey late last week and
private counts by both parties showed dozens of
Democrats ready to join minority Republicans and
give Reagan a budget plan tailored to his deep cuts
in social programs and a three-year, 30 percent tax

reduction
Nevertheless, Reagan said Tuesday, "You know
me I run scared all the time."
While the White House was practicing a soft sell,
O'Neill used an impassioned speech to step up pres
sure on Democrats to resist the Reagan tide.
"Listen, you have got to have courage along the
line and courage is thinking of Americans first."
O'Neill told Democrats during a private caucus
Tuesday. His office released a transcript of his re
marks.
O'Neill described himself as a life-long liberal
and pleaded with his colleagues to reject Reagan's
budget, which he said would cut "off the services for
health, education and senior services," and support
a less-austere Democratic plan.
An alternative backed by the Democratic leader
ship calls for spending $714.5 billion, including more
than Reagan would on social programs, and leaves a
deficit of $25 6 billion. It has room for only a one
year tax cut. smaller than the first year of the ad
ministration's three-year plan.
The Democrats' alternative isn't ideal. O'Neill
acknowledged. But he said "it cuts you oft at the
knees so you will use a prosthesis, rather than cut
ting you off at the hip where you have to walk along
with a crutch the rest of your life. "
French president endorsed
Paris — French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing's re-election campaign got new momen
tum yesterday with a lull-fledged endorsement from
Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac going far beyond the
lukewarm support he gave immediately after first
round presidential voting 10 days ago.
Chirac's first statement was that, as party leader,
he had no choice but to vote for Giscard but that his
followers should let their own consciences guide
them. A number ot left-wing Gaullists then an
nounced their support for Socialist candidate Fran
cois Mitterrand.
Yesterday Chirac called on his electorate to re
flect on "the risks that the election of Mitterrand
would create for France . . Mitterrand persists in
taking inspiration from economic principles that
have tailed everywhere they were put into practice.
Moreover, his alliance with the Communist Party
bears risks that I have already denounced."
Chirac got nearly a fifth of the vote in the first
round of the election, and Giscard needs most of
those votes plus a portion of the relatively large
stay-at-home vote to be elected on Sunday. Detailed
polls have shown that only about 70 percent of
Chirac's voters were inclined to vote for Giscard,
with the rest split between abstaining and voting for
the Socialists.
In contrast. 85 percent of the Communist voters
were shown to be ready to vote for Mitterrand •
