Weenies wimp out
As we were going to press last night, the Daily Cal
Softball team, under pressure from worried publi

"we couldn't get a field so we can't play you guys"
routine. However, we quickly shamed the sorry
squad into coming here for the contest. Are we not
Daily staffers? "Verily," quoth we ... in any event,
practice is still on for today at 4 p.m., Roble Field.
Correction
Yesterday's Daily incorrectly identified two stu
dents in a photograph ot Branner Hall's production
