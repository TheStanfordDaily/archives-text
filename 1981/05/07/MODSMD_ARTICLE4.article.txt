# Sands' burial may bring more violence
## 
### Washington Post 
Belfast, Northern Ireland â€” British
authorities are prepared for a feared
upsurge of violence in Northern
Irleand and possibly elsewhere in
Britain following this morning's fu
neral for Bobby Sands, the Irish na
tionalist terrorist who died earlier this
week after a 66-day hunger strike.
Terrorist snipers have already
killed a policeman and wounded a po
licewoman and a small child in Bel
fast. Snipers also wounded two sol
diers in the town of Crossmaglen near
the border with the Republic of Ire
land. Sporadic rioting and the hijack
ing and burning of vehicles continued
yesterday. Meanwhile demonstrators,
many of them small children, banged
garbage can covers on heavily for
tified police stations in some Catholic
neighborhoods.
A reserve battallion of 600 British
soldiers is being flown here overnight
to help back up Ulster police who have
faced violent disturbances since
Sands' death early Tuesday. Revers
ing what had been a steady reduction
in the number of British soldiers here
from a peak of nearly 21,000 at the
height of sectarian violence in 1972,
the arriving first battalion of the
Royal Regiment of Wales will in
crease British military strength here
to nearly 11,700 troops.
Security also was tightened for gov
ernment offices and public figures in
London and elsewhere in Britain, ac
cording to officials, to protect against
a "spectacular" terrorist act by the
provisional Irish Republican Army.
In a preview of today's funeral and
three mile procession through mostly
Catholic neighborhoods in west Bel
fast to a cemetery where other IRA
members are buried, Sands' body was
moved last night from his parents'
home to the nearby Catholic church in
a housing project of recently built
stucco and brick rowhouses on the
western edge of Belfast.
A bagpipe played and six men in
paramilitary uniforms with masks

and black berets followed as the coffin
was carried several hundred yards in
a cold drizzle through a crowd of sev
eral hundred relativegloves symbol
izing his commitment to the terrorist
organization that seeks to force Brit
ain to give up rule over Northern Ire
land.
Among the spectators who then
filled the church to overflowing for a
short service were many families with
small children who had walked from
other nearby Catholic housing
projects. Some could be heard arguing
about what happens to young men
drawn into the IRA, but they answered
reporters' questions by castigating
the British government for allowing
Sands to starve himself to death by re
fusing to meet his demands.
Across a vast open field serving as a
dividing no man's land, Protestants in
another housing project stood sullenly
outside their homes and watched the
distant procession. A winding road
linking the two projects was bar
ricaded by overturned, burned-out
cars. Armored police and army vehi
cles stood by.
Earlier, mourners in small groups
filed through the Sands home to view
the casket, which was then opened, ex
posing Sands' sunken face. Many of
them wore black armbands and black
flags hung from many of the surround
ing houses, j
But during the relative normality of
daylight hours in the west Belfast
Catholic ghettos today, few people
could be seen wearing the black
armbands requested by hunger strike
leaders. The streets were littered with
broken glass, bricks and stones and
debris from street barricades. Teen
agers and small children pelted pass
ing patrols with missiles.
As night fell, these attacks became
more intense, despite an appeal from
Gerry Adams, leader of provisional
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the pro
visional IRA, to avoid violence during
mourning for Sands.
