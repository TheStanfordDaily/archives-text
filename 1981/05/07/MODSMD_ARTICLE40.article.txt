## 
### 
Mrs. Mary Gohlke, the 45-year-old
woman who received a heart-lung
transplant at Stanford Hospital in
March, was moved from the hospital's
intensive care unit to a general ward
yesterday, and doctors suggested that
she may be released from the hospital
in three weeks.
Gohllce remains in satisfactory con
dition, according to her doctor Bruce
Reitz. She had spent the 59 days since
her operation in the intensive care unit
of the hospital regaining strength and
stamina.
Gohlke received the first human

heart-lung transplant in ten years. Ten
days after surgery she was beset by a
mild rejection of the new heart and
lungs, but that was completely con
trolled within a week, and her re
covery has been steady ever since.
Gohlke, advertising director of the
Mesa (Arizona) Tribune, has sur
vived the operation longer than any
previous recipients. Reitz, a cardio
vascular surgeon in charge of the
heart-lung transplant program, said
the operation is still an experimental
one.
