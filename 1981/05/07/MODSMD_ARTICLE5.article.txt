# U.S. ousts Libyan diplomats
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — All Libyan diplomats
must leave the United States within
five days, the Department of State or
dered yesterday, charging the regime
of Col. Moammar Kadafi with a wide
range of "provocations and miscon
duct, including support for interna
tional terrorism."
The order effectively suspended
diplomatic relations between the two
countries, although the U.S. action
stopped a step short of formally break
ing all ties.
Dean Fischer, a State Department
spokesman, made the announcement
at the same time that the order was
being given to Libya's ranking
diplomat by Undersecretary of State
Walter Stoessel.
"From the first days of the adminis
tration," the U.S. announcement said,
"both the president and Secretary (of
State Alexander) Haig have made
known their very real concern about a
wide range of Libyan provocations
and misconduct, including support for
international terrorism."
"We have also been concerned by a
general pattern of unacceptable con
duct by the People's Bureau (em
bassy) in Washington, which is con
trary to internationally accepted stan
dards of diplomatic behavior."
Libya is a substantial supplier of oil
to the United States, but spokesmen at
both the Department of State and the
White Hou?e said that the action an
nounced yesterday should have no ef
fect on the "oil relationship" between

the two countries. At present, the
United States is getting about 10 per
cent (some 640,000 barrels per day) of
its imported oil from Libya.
Dr. Ali Ahmed Elhouderi, the Lib
yan diplomat who accepted the State
Department order, told reporters
upon his return to the "People's Bu
reau," which Libya calls all of its em
bassies, that he was surprised at the
action.
"We don't regret a minute we spent
in this country," he said. "We still
seek a better understanding with
Americans. We're proud to be going
home and only regret we did not finish
the job we came to finish."
The Department of State refused to
cite specifics of the behavior it char
acterized as provocative, or to discuss
details of Libya's involvement in in
ternational terrorism.
Fischer said that the Libyans were
told that they would be welcome to es
tablish a diplomatic interests section
in another country's embassy in Wash
ington whenever the United States is
permitted to do the same in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli.
The United States has had no diplo
matic representation in Tripoli since
May 1980. Six months ago the Depart
ment of State issued a travel advisory
warning American citizens against
"any travel to or residence in Libya."
"Travelers should also be in
formed," the department said, "that
the U.S. embassy in Tripoli is closed
and the U.S. government is not in a

position to provide consular protec
tion and assistance to Americans pres
ently in Libya."
Fischer said that American com
panies had been advised earlier to
"draw down their personnel there"
and that the advice had been re
iterated. "We hope it will be heeded."
he said.
While officials at the Department of
State would not publicly discuss the
specifics of complaints against Libya,
the Reagan administration has been
especially concerned about the stock
piling of Soviet-built arms by the
Kadafi regime and about Libya's in
tervention in neighboring Chad.
The reference to unacceptable be
havior by the People's Bureau in
Washington apparently referred to an
episode last year when four Libyan
representatives were expelled after
an alleged campaign of intimidation
against exiled opponents of Kadafi.
The four were finally recalled by their
government after a tense standoff
with U.S. authorities at the Libyan
diplomatic mission in Washington.
They were characterized as "stu
dents" by the ranking Libyan envoy,
but President Jimmy Carter at the
time branded them "would-be-as
assms, the Kadafi regime expressed
its desire to normalize relations with
Washington during a meeting between
Libyan officials and executives of ma
jor U.S. oil companies that do business
in the North African country
Those U.S. oil companies have
about 2000 employees in Libya.
