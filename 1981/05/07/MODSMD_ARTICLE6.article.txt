# Education program may be cut
## 
### Cathy Janus 
An independent state program,
which brought more than seventy chil
dren of migrant farm workers to Stan
ford for a month last summer, is in
danger of having its funding drastical
ly reduced as a result of federal
budget cuts. The "Yo Puedo" pro
gram is designed to encourage stu
dents to continue their education
beyond high school.
"The attempt is to put these stu
dents in an atmosphere that is college
oriented," said Jesse Fajardo, acting
regional director, "so they could have
that goal for themselves. I believe
there is motivation on part of some of
the youngsters to pursue a career in
college."
Although Yo Puedo is a state pro
gram, it is funded entirely by federal
grants. Fajardo said the funds were
cut back 50 percent this year, which
could jeopardize the program. Yo
Puedo sends students to California
State College at Northridge as well as
to Stanford.
Fajardo also said that the program
may not come back to Stanford this
year because it is too expensive. The
Yo Puedo group pays room and board
to the University for the students that
attend, but classes are taught by
teachers within the program.
'Great program'
Jaime Silva, a senior in high school,
said he felt the program was great. He
said that when he'd attended Stanford,
"many people couldn't believe it, es
pecially my high school counselor."
"Stanford has a lot of clafts," said
Silva.
Students in seventh through twelfth
grades are chosen on the basis of a
written application and an interview,
said Becky Maldonado, one of the co
ordinators of the program in San Jose.

All students must have a grade point
average of at least "B" or "C".
Seventy students attended Stanford
for a month last summer. They lived
in Roble Hall, and according to some
of the participants in the program,
this facilitated talking with students
around campus and at meals.
Fajardo said that some University
staff worked with the program, and
took the Yo Puedo students to visit
regular University classes in math
and science.
'Helps everyone'
Esther Fierros, a high school
sophomore who attended the program
last summer, said "it is important
that Yo Puedo continues."
"It helps everyone," she said. "You
get to know people better, and even
the teachers learn a lot."
Fierros said she felt the strength of
the program is that "everyone learns
by doing. There is supervision, but we
made our own decisions. We made
mistakes, but we learned from the ex
perience."
The program included basic skills

such as reading, writing and leader
ship training, according to Fajardo.
The students developed a model city
and elected city representatives to op
erate the city.
"The whole thing was rewarding,"
said Dagoberto Nunez, a freshman in
high school. "It helped me out in being
more interested in school, partici
pating in school projects. It helped me
communicate with other people, espe
cially teachers," he said.
Challenging
"Yo Puedo is something that can
help, and not just in school," said
Fierros. "I learned to open up to peo
ple, how to make it in the world. It was
challenging."
"They all benefited, some more
than others," said Maldoriado. She
said most of the students work in the
fields during the sumrqer, and that it
was hard for some of the parents to let
their children go because of the loss of
income.
Fierros said that she probably
wouldn't have a chance to go to Stan
ford.
