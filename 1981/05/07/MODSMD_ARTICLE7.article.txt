# American and British system compares television 'designed to lower intelligence'
## 
### Sarah Hotchkis 
Unlike most civilized countries, America
has "the most peculiar and deviant system
ot television in the world . . systematically
designed to lower the intelligence level of
the country." In this respect, said Martin
Esslin speaking at the Bechtel Lunch
eon/Lecture Series last Tuesday, "America
is to be classed among the underdeveloped
countries of the world."
Esslin, Professor ot Drama at Stanford
and former Director of Radio Drama for the
British Broadcasting System (BBC), em
phasized that his remarks shouldn t be con
sidered anti-American. They originate from
his "sometimes paintul" experiences in
front ot television screens, especially the
unfortunate occasions when he has found
himself stranded in a Holiday Inn, and "con
demned to watch television."
According to Esslin. Americans never
cease to ask him why the programs that
come from Britain are so much more in
teresting than programs in this country.
The answer, he noted, lies in our twisted
system of commercial television in which
T.V. strives to reflect the will of a twelve
billion dollar advertising budget industry,
not the fundamental goals reflected in Brit
ish television: information, education, and
entertainment.
American television strives to sell goods,
and occasionally show a few programs.
This, said Esslin, is exemplified in an aver
age hour of daytime television program
ming, 16 minutes of which is devoted to con
vincing the audience, both consciously and
subconsciously, of need for a particu
lar product. Television has the potential to
entertain, educate, and provide culture in
the widest sense. But how can American tel
evision do all that?
"This seems to me to be an American ax
iom that there is no other system of tele
vision," said Esslin. "Americans suffer
from a case of parochialism," he added. A

simple glance across the border at the Cana
dian system reveals "a better method,'' al
though, he said, their flaw is allowing Amer
ican broadcasting. A government controlled
system though, is not the answer.
But what else remains? The BBC, said
Esslin, provides an efficient, democratic al
ternative in which the British government
has no control; only the Corporation's
Board ot Governors may formulate the op
erating policy of the BBC's two channels.
Esslin emphasized the democratic ap
proach of a dual channel broadcast; while
one channel shows entertainment, the other
airs a documentary or other type ot educa
tional program.
On American television, the same type of
program may crop up on 13 stations simul
taneously, he said. Frequently, there exists
a disenfranchised segment of the viewing
public who would like to watch "high brow"
programs which aren't available.
Public television, PBS, doesn't fill the
gap since it struggles under a severe lack of
funds. This problem has worsened since the
Reagan budget cuts to public T V.and the
National Endowment for the Arts. PBS,
said Esslin, "has to go begging all the time
with auctions and subscriptions, which
makes it as enervating as commercial tele
vision."
"On top of that," he added, "you have a
disguised form ot advertising in the cons-
ot Exfcon and others who
have provided the funding." This "quality
advertising" is tine, he said, if the program
mers don't consistently ask themselves
"Well, will that please Exxon?" This "rath
er horrifying," covert form of censorship
doesn't exist in Britain, according to Esslin.
On British commercial television, com
mercials may occupy no more than seven
minutes per prime time hour, and are shown
during natural breaks at the end of the pro

gram. Esslin added emphatically that there
is an absolute ban on sponsored progam
ming in Britain. "No firm can say, i want to
have my advertisement in this program';
they have to take potluck," he added. In a
past experience with American T.V., Esslin
was told to rewrite a scene in his script in
which the husband, who planned to murder
his wife, would get drunk on beer since
Budweiser sponsored the program.
Without government or sponsor control,
the Board of Governors of the BBC acts au
tonomously. The Board members are ap
pointed by the Queen to serve alternate
three to six year terms And, according to
Esslin, the BBC charter requires the Board
include representatives from Northern Ire
land, Wales Scotland, and must also include
a conservative, liberal, one or two women,
and members from the academic communi
ty.
But what about funding for the BBC?
Since 1925, everyone in England who oper
ates a television set or radio must pay an an
nual registration tee. This money, collected
by the post office, goes directly to the BBC
for broadcasting. Esslin estimated that five
per cent of the British cheat and don't pay
the tee, but most people pay to avoid the
tines levied on people caught without a
license.
"They have very impressive looking vans
with radar which can supposedly detect tel
evision sets, but. I personally think it's a
great bluff," he said. And, added Esslin, the
day after one of those vans rolls through a
suburb, people flock to take out licenses.
This method of funding works well for the
BBC, but hasn't a bright future in the United
States. "The commercial system simply
can't be dislodged from American tele
vision," said Esslin. But in a democracy, he
added, if enough people want a change in the
system, as they have in this country for civil
rights and protection of the environment,
they will find their solution.
