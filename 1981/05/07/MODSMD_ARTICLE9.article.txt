# Test-takers given 'prep-course' options
## 
### Jay MacIver 
Each year, college students
spend thousands of dollars on
test preparatory courses which
they hope will result in better
scores on LSATs, GMATs,
MCATs and GREs. Senior Patty
Pichon's reason for taking such
a course is typical: "It was the
extra pressure. I needed to
make myself study."
Students also sign up for the
courses to familiarize them
selves with the test formats and
gain confidence. Asked what
benefits she got from the
course, Pichon said, "I was a lot
more confident, a lot less shaky,
and I knew what sections would
be where."
Courses offered range from
the more well-known Kaplan
classes to the smaller, less ex
pensive courses like law student
Peter Stern's.
Kaplan's $290 to $340 tuition
(depending on the test being
studied for) includes approx
imately 32 to 40 hours of class
time and unlimited use of the
tape library (recordings of class
and supplementary lectures).
According to Administrative
Assistant Jeff Argentos, "What
students pay for is access to ma
terials."
Class time is divided between
lecture, tests on lecture materi
al and analysis of the tests, said
Argentos. A student taking the
Kaplan course may also expect
to put in from 50 to 70 hours of
home study.
While declining to cite any
"success statistics," Argentos
said that students are quite sat
isfied with the course.
An increasingly popular pro
gram for Stanford students is
the LSAT-GMAT program of
fered through San Jose State

University by the Educational
Test Preparation Service
(ETPS). These courses cost $80
and involve approximately 20
hours of class time.
Again, class time is divided
between lecture and practice.
Most instructors for the
ETPS courses are high school or
university level educators, each
teaching inJiis own field. (For
example, English sections are
taught by English teachers, and
math sections are taught by
math teachers.)
While warning that such
statistics could be misleading
and are probably skewed, Coor
dinator Howard Horowitz said
that, of those students reporting
scores, the majority were at or
above the 95th percentile. In ad
dition, the ETPS guarantees its
class: if a student is not satis
fied with his results, he may re
take the course at no charge un
til he is satisfied. Horowitz said
that very few students have
taken advantage of this option.
Law student Peter Stern of
fers a smaller, more individ
ually-oriented course for stu
dents taking the LSAT or
GMAT. His classes average
about eight to 12 students and
about 24 to 32 hours of class
time, though this is flexible, de
pending on students' needs. The
cost is $150.
Stern makes use of com
mercial manuals, exercises he
makes up himself, and actual
exams from previous test dates.
Stern, formerly an instructor
in the history and under
graduate studies departments
here and now a visiting pro
fessor of history at Santa Clara,
has 11 years of teaching ex
perience.
Of the 22 graduates of Stern's
course since October, he was
able to obtain scores for 18 of

them. Assuming that the four
unreported scores were low, 14
students got scores of 600 or
more, and eight scored above
700.
Stern cited students who had
taken the exam before taking
his course and had gotten poor
to fair scores. After the course,

many of them raised their
scores by up to 250 points. He
also cited one student whose
score stayed basically the
same. According to Stern. "The
course helps to bring a person to
his or her potential. If the ability
is not present, I cannot put it
there."
