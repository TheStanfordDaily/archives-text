University President Donald Ken
nedy said, "I'm pleased with the large
voter turnout, which indicates the im

message that we must work to in
crease the rewards and satisfactions
associated with some very important
jobs at Stanford."
Joyce Tipps-Coats, organizer and
spokesperson for the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC), said,
"I'm very disappointed. Overall, the
ballots show that clerical workers
here at Stanford are not ready to ac
cept responsibility for their own lives,
their own livelihood.
"But the 12 to 22 percent raises are a
direct result of our organizing and we
just have to keep working to raise
women's consciousness. People want
to form some sort of coalition and to
stop our work would be, like trying to

stop a strong Mow of water," Tipps-
Coats said
The authors of the University's
election bulletins said they were hap

educational process. We can now
make improvements where improve
ments are needed."
Bob Anderson, spokesperson for the
Service Employees International
Union, the parent organization of Lo

process in a union election. "You're
breaking ground here Whenever you
do something that hasn't been done

here yesterday.
Only 67 ballots were challenged in

this was a very small number for an
election of this size. Oftep, as many as
10 percent of the votes may be con

ballots, both sides agreed to return
nine to the overall pool of countable
ballots, to eliminate eight altogether.

outcome could be determined by those

wanted to make comments on how the

with clericals showed strong opinions
on both sides of the issue.
"I don't think a union would change
anything, collective action is not war
ranted here," said one secretary who
voted against the union.
A library specialist, unsatisfied
with his supervisor, said he voted for
the union as he hoped it would "im
prove the quality of the supervisors

political appointments." He said he
feared that the secretaries, who gen

supervisors, might swing the vote for
the University.

A secretary, giving the thumbs

because, "I like the way it is here.
When you've worked in industry you
realize that there it's uglier and it has
a less-relaxed atmosphere. As for in

we're getting plenty of benefits for
that."
Should either side raise objections
and contest the outcome of the elec

unless it is appealed by either party, in

their own livelihood.
"But the 12 to 22 percent raises are a
direct result of our organizing and we
just have to keep working to raise
women's consciousness. People want
