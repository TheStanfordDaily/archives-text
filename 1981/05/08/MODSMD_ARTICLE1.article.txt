message that we must work to in
crease the rewards and satisfactions
associated with some very important
jobs at Stanford."

spokesperson for the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC), said,

their own livelihood.

direct result of our organizing and we
just have to keep working to raise
women's consciousness. People want
to form some sort of coalition and to
stop our work would be, like trying to

stop a strong Mow of water," Tipps-
