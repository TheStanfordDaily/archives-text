# Patricia Graham of Harvard lectures:
## 'On Women in Higher Education' 
### Louise Solomon 
The recent changes in at
titudes toWard women have
done little to grant women more
power or money in academia,
according to Patricia Graham
ot Harvard University.
Speaking Wednesday night in
CERAS on "Women in Higher
Education," Graham covered
the history of women in the aca
demic world, their current sta
tus in the university system, and
the challenges that women will
face in the future.
"The decade of the '70s began
with a selt-consciousness by
women themselves about the
discrimination they faced in
higher education and was the
beginning of organizational ef
forts to counter it. To do so suc
cessfully, required power and
money. Academic women have
not been particularly successful
in gaining either," said
Graham.
Graham said this was be
cause of the decline of small lib
eral arts colleges, where wom
en faculty were often located,
and because of the rise to pre
eminence ot research univer
sities, where women faculty and
administrators were usually
absent.
This change of prestige within
the higher education system had

the unintended consequence of
suppressing opportunities for
women, she said
"Until quite recently, within
the last decade the most presti
gious o( these universities, the
Ivies and possibly Stanford, Chi
cago, and Berkeley generally
admitted women on quota or not
at all. And they have had either

Until quite recently, within the last decade
most prestigious universities, the Ivys and
possibly Stanford, Chicago, and Berkeley,
generally admitted women on quota or not
at all. . .

no women faculty, or at best
very small numbers of them.
Most of these women partici
pated in the junior and less pres
tigious positions, home econom
ics and education, whether or
not they had training in other
fields," Graham said.
Since World War 11, pro
fessors have not been con
sidered an eccentric group ex
empt from the rest of society,
rather they are sought after tor
public service and private con
sulting, said Graham.
"As long as professors were
outside the American dream
there was more room for wom-

'en than there is today, when pro
fessors attempt to present
themselves as within the Ameri
can dream: as competent, valu
able experts on important prob
lems of national significance,''
she added
Graham described the pro
fessor ot the late 20th century as
an "alert, hard-driving, prag-

matic specialist who 6an assist
private enterprise or govern
ment." She went on to say that
the transition from the isolated
academician to the influential
policy-maker has been difficult
tor men and nearly impossible
for women.
She ascribed the difference in
difficulty to the fact that women
had to overcome two stere
otypes — that of professors and
that of women. "Men professors
became what was expected tor
successful men in the society.
For women, even the pro
fessoriate has not been consis
tent with societal expectations
tor their success. And yet it was

more consistant with their role
than that ot the successful en
trepreneur,'' Graham said
Another explanation for the
drop in the number of women in
positions of authority between
World War II and the birth of the
feminist movement in the 1960s
is that while study has been con
sistent with expectations tor
women, professional eminence
has not, Graham said. She
called the typically admired vir
tues of 20th cent jiy women
"youth, appearance, ac
quiescence, and domesticity."
Graham said that the 9th
century woman who attended
college exempted herselt from
societal values and thus became
highly individualistic, un
orthodox, and in some cases
toughened enough to fulfill posi
tions of authority; whereas the
20th century feminine model is
not necessarily opposed to wom
an's education, and thus there is
no longer any "exemptive ef
fect."
"Rather," Graham said,
"youth, appearance, even ac
quiesence, are enhanced by col
lege attendance; and even more
advantageous possibilities for
that last trait, domesticity, may
be realized."
However, the recent institu
tion of affirmative action pro
grams has been beneficial for
women's attempts to gain
tenure and even some junior
positions of responsibility,
Graham said. "A beginning has
been made, although the num
bers are still few and the rate of
growth slow," she said.
"Tenured faculty at some of the
best known institutions now in
clude the following percentages
of women:
Princeton 3.4%
Yale 4.5%
Harvard 3.6%
Columbia 5.0%
UC-Berkeley 7.8%
Stanford 6.0%
In a brief question and answer
period, Graham said, "the
challenge ot the 1980s is to find a
balance between a professional
life and a personal life, and to
define the proper social rela
tionships between men and
women." She said that she had
no answer, but that these are
questions we must begin to think
about and to deal with, rather
than ignore.

Graham said this was be
cause of the decline of small lib
eral arts colleges, where wom
en faculty were often located,
and because of the rise to pre
eminence ot research univer
sities, where women faculty and
administrators were usually
absent.
This change of prestige within
the higher education system had

the unintended consequence of
suppressing opportunities for
women, she said
"Until quite recently, within
the last decade the most presti
gious o( these universities, the
Ivies and possibly Stanford, Chi
cago, and Berkeley generally
admitted women on quota or not
at all. And they have had either

no women faculty, or at best
very small numbers of them.
Most of these women partici
pated in the junior and less pres
tigious positions, home econom
ics and education, whether or
not they had training in other
fields," Graham said.
Since World War 11, pro
fessors have not been con
sidered an eccentric group ex
empt from the rest of society,
rather they are sought after tor
public service and private con
sulting, said Graham.
"As long as professors were
outside the American dream
there was more room for wom-

'en than there is today, when pro
fessors attempt to present
themselves as within the Ameri
can dream: as competent, valu
able experts on important prob
lems of national significance,''
she added
Graham described the pro
fessor ot the late 20th century as
an "alert, hard-driving, prag-

matic specialist who 6an assist
private enterprise or govern
ment." She went on to say that
the transition from the isolated
academician to the influential
policy-maker has been difficult
tor men and nearly impossible
for women.
She ascribed the difference in
difficulty to the fact that women
had to overcome two stere
otypes — that of professors and
that of women. "Men professors
became what was expected tor
successful men in the society.
For women, even the pro
fessoriate has not been consis
tent with societal expectations
tor their success. And yet it was

more consistant with their role
than that ot the successful en
trepreneur,'' Graham said
Another explanation for the
drop in the number of women in
positions of authority between
World War II and the birth of the
feminist movement in the 1960s
is that while study has been con
sistent with expectations tor
women, professional eminence
has not, Graham said. She
called the typically admired vir
tues of 20th cent jiy women
"youth, appearance, ac
quiescence, and domesticity."
Graham said that the 9th
century woman who attended
college exempted herselt from
societal values and thus became
highly individualistic, un
orthodox, and in some cases
toughened enough to fulfill posi
tions of authority; whereas the
20th century feminine model is
not necessarily opposed to wom
an's education, and thus there is
no longer any "exemptive ef
fect."
"Rather," Graham said,
"youth, appearance, even ac
quiesence, are enhanced by col
lege attendance; and even more
advantageous possibilities for
that last trait, domesticity, may
be realized."
However, the recent institu
tion of affirmative action pro
grams has been beneficial for
women's attempts to gain
tenure and even some junior
positions of responsibility,
Graham said. "A beginning has
been made, although the num
bers are still few and the rate of
growth slow," she said.
"Tenured faculty at some of the
best known institutions now in
clude the following percentages
of women:
Princeton 3.4%
Yale 4.5%
Harvard 3.6%
Columbia 5.0%
UC-Berkeley 7.8%
Stanford 6.0%
In a brief question and answer
period, Graham said, "the
challenge ot the 1980s is to find a
balance between a professional
life and a personal life, and to
define the proper social rela
tionships between men and
women." She said that she had
no answer, but that these are
questions we must begin to think
about and to deal with, rather
than ignore.
The recent changes in at
titudes toWard women have
done little to grant women more
power or money in academia,
according to Patricia Graham
ot Harvard University.
Speaking Wednesday night in
CERAS on "Women in Higher
Education," Graham covered
the history of women in the aca
demic world, their current sta
tus in the university system, and
the challenges that women will
face in the future.
"The decade of the '70s began
with a selt-consciousness by
women themselves about the
discrimination they faced in
higher education and was the
beginning of organizational ef
forts to counter it. To do so suc
cessfully, required power and
money. Academic women have
not been particularly successful
in gaining either," said
Graham.
Graham said this was be
cause of the decline of small lib
eral arts colleges, where wom
en faculty were often located,
and because of the rise to pre
eminence ot research univer
sities, where women faculty and
