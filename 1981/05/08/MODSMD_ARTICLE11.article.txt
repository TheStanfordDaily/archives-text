# Annual 'Bay to Breakers' race hits streets of San Francisco
## 
### Marianne Villanueva 
On May 17, runners of every conceivable
type and cultural variety — from serious run
ning enthusiasts to unabashed exhibitionists —
will descend upon the streets of San Francisco
tor the Breaker s race once again. The
7.63 mile run from the San Francisco Bay to the
Pacific Ocean, is an annual event sponsored by
the San Francisco Examiner. Compared to the
26-mile Boston Marathon, the Bay to Breakers
race is for amateurs, but over the years
thousands have come to look upon it as one of
San Francisco's annual rites of spring. Among
the more eyebrow-raising participants this
year will be University President Donald Ken
nedy, who will be running along with his daugh
ter, Page.
The starting time for this year's race is 8
a.m. The starting point will be the intersection
of Spear and Howard, a tew blocks away from
the Oakland Bay Bridge: The runners will
move up to 9th Street, turn left at Hayes, and
proceed past such San Francisco landmarks as
City Hall, the Opera House, and the Davies
Symphony Hall before turning left again at
Divisadero. The runners follow Divisadero for
about a block and turn right into Fell. Fell will
take the runners into the Golden Gate Park via
the Northern Panhandle. Once in the park,
runners will take the John F. Kennedy Drive
all the way to the finish line at the Great High
way, which is at the far end of the park, border
ing the Pacific Ocean.
Last year's winner, Craig Virgin — who, in
cidentally, holds the American record for the
10 kilometer run — clocked in which a record
breaking 35:11.8, averaging 4:37 per mile. The
first woman over the finish line, Laurie
Binder, also broke the women's record with a
time of 42:20.
According to the Examiner, this year's first
place finishers will receive free plane fare and
an all-expense paid trip to the Honolulu Mara
thon on December 13. Free T-shirts will be giv
en to all those who cross the finish line.
Aside from awards for the first-place fin
ishers, there will be special awards tor the
first California residents — man and woman —
to cross the finish line, and awards for best cos
tume design.
An interesting adjunct of the race will be the
"World Centipede Championships." Entries in
this category are groups of 13 people or more
running tied together at the waist. According
to the Examiner, they "are supposed to be in
fright costumes and are supposed to look like
tentipedes." Since this is a race, and not a
look-alike contest, prizes go to the fastest cen
tipedes. not necessarily to the most authentic
look-alikes.
Stanford participants range from individ-

uals like Andrew Cutler of Hammarksjold
House who merely wants to "run a fair run," to
serious racers like Toshi Oyama, a Ph.D. stu
dent in the Department of Materials Science
and Engineering who has run in several mara
thons and many 10-kilometer races. Others,
like the group of 20 or so from Roble, are plan
ning to make the race an occasion for a day in
the city, following it up with a Beach Boys con
cert in the afternoon. Still others, like the
freshmen from Wilbur Okada, are going to pa
rade standard routines that have proved useful
in previous occasions. In the freshmen's case,
it is their 30-foot Chinese dragon, an intricate
contraption whose head alone weighs 50 to 60
pounds, according to Okada's Resident Ad
visor, Clete Kushida.
Toshi, who ran in last year's race, has this
advice for prospective participants: "Don't
expect serious running," because there are
just "too many people."
According to the Examiner, 27,500 people
have been listed as official entries, but hun
dreds more will undoubtedly run along, "just
for fun." Top-seeded runners will start first.
The rest will fall in at the back. Last year, the
crowd at the starting line reportedly stretched
three of four blocks down the street.
"Just enjoy the race," Toshi says.
Andrew Cutler, too, is not running com
petitively. But, he says, "It's nice to be part of
a big event. It should be a lot of fun." He says
he likes running, and that this is "a nice excuse
to run." It is also, he says, "a good chance to
see how fast I can run."
George Schmidt, resident adviser for Roble,
gives the impression that his group is looking
forward to the Beach Boys concert just as
much as it is to the race, but will be running
just "for the fun of it." He notes that getting up
for the race may be a problem. "It used to be at
10 a.m.," he says of the starting time.
Schmidt guesses that the Angell Field An
cients, a group of faculty and students whom
he says are "serious runners" wil probably be
running competitively, if they do join. He
points out that the Ancients usually sweep the
Intramural races as they did last fall.
Unlike the serious Angell Field Ancients,
Schmidt says that 60 percent of the people who
run the Bay to Breakers "wear weird stuff and
are just goofing around."
This observation was echoed by Toshi, who
reported that among the highlights of last
year's race was a man who ran in a wedding
dress and a group of six men who ran together
disguised as a huge six-pack of beer. There
were also the usual number of nude runners al
though, Toshi notes regretfully, "no girls this
time."
