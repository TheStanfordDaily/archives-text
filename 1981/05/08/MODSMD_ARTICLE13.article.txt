## 
### Adam Goodman 
The new Stanford Rubik's
Cube and Puzzles Club will
make its debut Saturday, May 9
at the Games Extravaganza in
Fairchild Auditorium, Stan
ford Medical Center. The club
was originally called the Stan
ford Rubik's Cube Club but be
cause of public demand has
since expanded to include all
kinds of puzzles.
At the. Extravaganza, the
group's booth will feature
"speed puzzling," a contest to
see who can solve the Rubik's
Cube the fastest. The Ex
travaganza will also include
video games, computer sim
ulations, puzzles, and other new
games, designed by people in
the Bay Area.
The goal of the new club is "to
bring together people interested
in puzzles in general," said Dan
Pehoushek, a club represent
ative. The group is interested in
solving, simulating, and creat
ing a wide variety of puzzles, he
said.
The original Rubik's Cube
Club was formed in January,
and its members have already
taught dozens ot people how to
solve the Cube during their
Thursday evening meetings.
"You have to build up an entire

science," Pehoushek said.
"Once you know how to do it, it
takes two to three minutes."
The Rubik's Cube, which was
invented and patented by an
Hungarian architectural de
signer Ernoe.Rubik in '975 1( c0n-

Ihe trick to solving the Cube is in learning
moves which alter only ft few of the sub
cubes without messing up the rest. A
frustrated Cube owner can either come to
the meeting and learn solutions to the Cube
or can purchase a solution booklet written
by the club's founder.

sists of 26 sub-cubes arranged in
3-dimensional, movable layers.
When bought, the Cube's six
faces each show a different col
or. The purchaser mixes up the
subcubes and then attempts to
rebuild the cube into its orginal
design or some other pattern.
Pehoushek said that the trick
to solving the Cube is in learning

moves which alter only a few of
the sub-cubes without messing
up the rest. A frustrated Cube
owner can either come to the
meeting and learn solutions to
the Cube or can purchase a solu
tion booklet written by the

club's founder Kersten Meirer
with the aid of several trans
lators from the club. The
booklet sells for live dollars.
Meier has kept a large collec
tion of solutions and other liter
ature from around the world for
the club's use. He has also been
busy designing his own versions
of the Cube, a Magic

Tetrahedron (a 4-sided
polyhedron) as well as a
dodecahedron (12 sides).
Meier's Magic Tetrahedron
won fourth place in the recent
Mattel, Inc. competition, and he
is currently seeking a manufac
turer for it. He came up with the
idea last summer and finished a
working model in February. He
completed the drawings is now
making the parts for it.
Another project the club is
working on, it to make an elec
tronic version of Rubik's Cube.
By changing the color of the
graphic display, puzzle solvers
can "turn" the sides very fast,
Pehoushek said.
According to Pehoushek,
there are many diverse pro
fessions in which the study and
creation ot puzzles may be ap
plied. Aspects of engineering,
psychology, mathematics, and
computer science are involved
in the creation of a new puzzle,
he said.
