## Sign anti-Watt petition 
### 
When President Ronald Reagan an
nounced his appointment of James Watt
as secretary of the interior last Decem
ber, many groups, including the Daily,
protested vociferously. For Reagan to ap
point Watt — an attorney who had spent
the last three years battling environmen
talists over land and water use issues — to
direct the office which administers
thousands of acres of federal land, we
said, was like letting a fox guard the hen
house. Despite widespread protest, the
Senate confirmed Watt's appointment.
Environmentalists and others hoped
that their tears would be allayed, and that
under Watt, the Interior Department
could continue to be an effective counter
balance to forces like the Department ot
Commerce and the Department of Energy
in the administration.
It hasn't. In just a tew months. Watt has
proven that his conception of his job as
secretary of the interior is remarkably
different from what the job has become.
The federal government says that in the
131 years of its existence, the Department
ot Interior's responsibilities have been
transferred from "that ot general house
keeper for the federal government to
custodian of the nation's natural re
sources." Custodian Watt has left his
work station in a dreadful mess. Since he
has been in office. Watt has:
• Opened to oil and gas leasing offshore

areas that the Carter administration had
previously excluded from consideration;
• Ordered the Office of Endangered Spec
ies to suspend some proposed endangered
species listings;
• Stated his intent to allow oil and gas pro
duction on wildlife refuges and wilderness
areas;
• Fired about 30 Interior Department at
torneys who were working to protect fed
eral lands and resources;
• Advocated turning urban national recre
ation areas over to the states.
Critical of these actions and others, the
Sierra Club is distributing a petition to be
submitted to Congress calling for Secre
tary Watt's dismissal. It accuses him of
advocating policies which defy conserva
tion goals supported by a vast majority of
the American people. Although Congress
does not have the power to recall Watt, it,
as the branch most directly responsible to
the electorate, should be made known of
public teeling. To express this through a
petition is an effective use of the demo
cratic process.
Secretary Watt has abdicated his role as
custodian of our natural resources. By
signing the Sierra Club petition, voters
can let Congress and Reagan know that
they object to Watt's misuse ot these un
renewable resources and his consequent
disregard for the future. The Daily urges
voters to do so.
