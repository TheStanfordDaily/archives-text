## Gays previously invisible 
### 
Not long ago. I saw an image which summed up
for me my ideal of gay life. I was at the Devil's
Herd, a western bar up in the city. It was a Thurs
day night, not all that busy, and the band was in
the middle of the set. When they started playing
the "Tennessee Waltz," the leatherman sitting
next to me went over and asked one of the urban
cowboys to dance. Two tough sexual fantasies
linked in a gentle romantic dance — an unusual
but very pretty image. I was immediately in
trigued, but it took several weeks for me to fully
understand why.
More than most people, gay people grow up
feeling different and alone. I consider this almost
as fundamental as our sexuality in defining who
we are. Many of us grew up in very average fami
lies, with an implicit set of values thrown in: mar
riage, monogamy, heterosexuality. but also kind
ness, honesty, respect, and so on. It would be sui
cidal to hang on to all of these values — any seri
ous relationship would be equally crazy to throw
art of them out. Some decisions have to be made
about what is of value in our upbringing.
So far, this is really no different than the ex
perience of any teenager rebeling against the
older generation. But that is only a superficial ob
servation.
Most teenagers — through sex education, con
versations with their friends and siblings, TV, etc.
— have mtiny places to turn for advice about shap
ing their life, and rarely have to make fundamen
tal breaks with their family and their society. Gay
children, though, have nowhere to turn. As far as
they can tell, .their parents are straight, their
teachers are'straight (or pretend to be), their
friends are straight, and (it they have any sense at
all) they've realized that society speaks about
homosexuality in less than glowing terms if it
even mentions it at all.
The result is that gay people must, on their own,
in secret, and without the ability to experiment,
develop a personal code of ethics and an inte
grated sense of self. This is no easy task, and
many of us. such as those who blame alcohol tor
their sex lives, do not succeed. Even after we
come out, there is no historically tested gay cul
ture to join. The strongest gay communities are

less than a decade old. The only difference that
coming out makes is that we can now try out ideas
collectively, and with the knowledge and con
fidence that we are not alone. It makes us free, but
the many possibilities that freedom offers can
still leave us feeling very confused.
There is a tendency to pity or condemn those'
who take part in the less "middle-class" aspects
of gay life. Many people — gay or straight — look
down on the leather world, the baths, drag, S/M,
man boy love, casual sex; in short, anything ex
cept a parody of monogamous marriage. Regard
less of their consequences, I see these parts of lite
as powerful expressions of what it means to be
gay. They are instances where gay ppople have
honestly and bravely worked out personal ethics
tor themselves — based on their own experience
rather than on the second-hand advice of outsiders
who know nothing of these experiences.
Back to the couple dancing to the "Tennessee
Waltz." The two of them by their clothing and ap
pearance ishort hair and beards), were indicating
openly the sexual images they found attractive.
Such macho appearances usually go along with
stiff poses, sullen looks, hard music, heavy sex,
and no dancing. Yet here they were dancing to a
very nostalgic song. They were both going strong
ly against the norms of their images, and trusting
in their own tastes, rather than going along with
the imposed tastes of a sub-culture.
The two of them may have given up many
aspects ot average American life — such as mar
riage and children — but they hadn't been forced
to give up everything. They can still enjoy neigh
borliness, the warmth of nostalgia, and the "Ten
nessee Waltz."
America is our country, too. Until recently, gay
people were invisible — illegal, suppressed,
closeted, and afraid. Thanks to the bravery of a
few drag queens rioting in New York in : 969, all
that has changed. As a community, we are just
learning how to express ourselves. In our own
ways, we are just beginning to make our own ori
ginal and personal voice part of the collective
voice of this country.
