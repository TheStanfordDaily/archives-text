## Stop beating around the bush, by George 
### 
Vice President George Bush
was awakened by the knocking
on his office door. "Come on
in," he said drowsily. "The door
is always open."
"The Duke of Ingenby at your
service," announced the in
disputably-English gentleman
who opened the door. "I'm the
P R. man you requested."
"Do sit down," said Vice
President. "I understand you
have considerable experience in
these affairs."
"Yes," replied the English
man. "But that is of no im
portance now. What is impor
tant is the case at hand."
"Yes, good. Let us begin."
"I have done some thinking
about your case and have come
to the conclusion that your post
deserves to receive much more
dignity than it is given by the
media and the population at
large. In order to remedy this
deficiency, I have several rec
ommendations to make for you,
based upon my experience in
England."
"Do go on,"
"First of all, you need a title
befitting your position as heir to
the throne, pardon me, the pres
idency of the United States.
"Won't 'Vice President Bush'
do?"
"No, no. my dear chap The
duke shook his head. "It doesn t
demand respect What you need
is a title over some principality,
preferably over some useless
appendage of a province — the

equivalent of our Wales."
"Texas?"
"Jolly good idea. But. . ."
The duke paused. "Aren't you
from Texas?"
"Why yes."
Well, it just won't do, then —
we can t have you exercising
sovereignty over the place of
your birth."
"Why not?"
"Oh, it just isn't done — how
gauche." The duke shuddered.
"Have you ever lived in North
Dakota?"
"No, I've never even been
there."
"It's perfect then. 'George
Bush, Prince of Dakota.' I like
the sound of it,"the duke said as
he jotted it down in his
notebook. "Now you need an ap
propriate wife."
"But I already have a wife."
"She can be taken care of."
The duke paused. "You need a
wife people will stand up and
take notice of — like Prince
Chartfes' Lady Diana."
"Brooke Shields?"
"No, too young. In addition,
you need someone with a fash
ion-setting hairstyle — again,
like our Lady Diana." The duke
thought a moment. "How about
Bo Derek?"
"Well, I don't know," replied
the now-Prince of Dakota. "But
out of sense of duty to my coun
try, I'm willing to make the sac
rifice."
"Jolly good — that's the spir
it." The Englishman smiled

"Now you need a regiment."
"A regiment?"
"Or a brigade, or several bat
talions, it doesn't really matter
— it's the thought that counts.
Does the United States have any
worthy military unit with a
long, dignified tradition?"
"There was a movie about the
Green Berets once," replied Bo
Derek's new husband. "But
their tradition is neither long
nor especially dignified.''
"Can you think of any better
unit?"
"No."
"Then the Green Berets it
is." The Englishman scribbled
in his book. "The next thing you
need is a moderately dangerous
hobby, preferably one popular
throughout the country."
"Jaywalking?"
"No, no," replied the Eng
lishman. shaking his head.
"More along the lines of horse
manship, as is enjoyed by our
Prince Charles."
"Well, the President has al
ready claimed riding. " The new
commander of the Green Berets
paused thoughtfully. "How
about skiing?"
"There's a fine idea — it
served your Jerry Ford quite
well indeed. " He wrote it down
in his tyook and then reread his
list so far. "George Bush.
Prince of Dakota, Executive
Commander of the Green
Berets. Married to Bo Derek.
Favorite pasttime skiing. It

lack something."
"Royal Blood?"
"Well, yes — but it's some
thing more than that, something
much more profound."
"Gee, I can't think. . ."
"Ceremony, milord, ceremo
ny!" The duke clasped his hands
in glee. "In England, our heir to
the throne makes hundreds of
ceremonial public appearances
a year."
"Gee, I don't know. . ."
"Rowing regattas, bank
openings, Kiwanis luncheons.
You'll be the life of every party!
Say, my dear chap, have you an
appropriate ceremonial uni
form?"
"I bought a new suit yester
day."
"Do you have any military
decorations you could put on
it?"
"No," said the Vice Presi
dent. "But maybe I can borrow
some of Secretary of State A 1
Haig's."
"Yes. that would be fine. Oh,
I can see it all now — your image
is going to improve rather dra
matically, I dare say."
"I don't know how to thank
you."
"Don't worry about thanking
me now — wait until you receive
my bill."
