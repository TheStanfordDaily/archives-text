## Why doves should back the draft 
### 
Last week on this page, Hoo
ver Institute fellow Thomas
Gale Moore opposed reinstating
the military draft. Employing
rhetoric reminiscent of the Rea
gan campaign, the Hoover sen
ior fellow shot down the reasons
usually given for bringing back
the draft. Surprised? Don't be.
He forgot at least one. A fair,
universal draft by lottery may
be our best insurance against
war.
Bring back the draft to pre
vent a war? That was an argu
ment I intuitively rejected until
I read a very honest and pro
vocative essay written by
Fallows, former chief
speech writer to President
Carter and currently Washing
ton editor of the Atlantic
Monthly, where the article ap
peared a year ago. Now I am
riddled with doubts worth shar
ing.
To see the point requires a
painful reassessment of the
motives behind much of the
mass opposition to the Vietnam
War that built up by *970. Dur
ing the five years of heaviest
calls for Vietnam, there was the
starkest class division in the
military since the Civil War,
when the privileged could
purchase draft deferments. The
primary reason was that a
grossly unfair selective service
system separated the privileged
class from the "suckers" and
the "patriotic."
Until ' 968 the college-student
deferment, the "hardship" ex
emptions, health disability

loopholes and Secretary of De
tense MacNamara's plan to give
"disadvantaged" kids a chance
to better themselves in the mili
tary all were designed to deploy
American talent in the most
productive manner. The effect,
however, was to put the poor,
the black, and the less educated
in the trenches — and later in
the burlap bags and rehabilita
tion wards.
Fallows admits how he and
his classmates at Harvard ex
ploited the loopholes in the phys
ical qualifications standards to
obtain "unfit for service" ex-

emptions. While a third of the
young men their age were
drafted, only 2 out of Fallow's
1200 Harvard classmates failed
to dodge induction. Stanford
was the same. Religion was nev
er so popular here as when the
local judge — a good liberal —
began certifying conscientious
objectors like a missionary bap
tizing converts. For every one of
them who dodged the draft, an
other Taxi Driver from the in
ner city or Deer Hunter from
the rural hills marched off to the
apocalypse in Southeast Asia.
The graduate deferment
ended in 1968, however, marking
the moment the previously
small anti-war movement
would begin closing campuses
and burning ROTC buildings.
Until the draft's expansion im
pacted on the society at large,
Gallup polls actually showed the
strongest and most consistent
support for the Vietnam war
came from thdse under 30. The
protest against the war soon
grew broad-based and respect
able as the student's parents
woke up to the threat. Johnson
was dumped and Nixon beat
Humphrey with the most con
vincing promise of "peace with
honor."
Although the war dragged on
well past the worst of the stu
dent protests in 1969 and 1970,
the Nixon administration came
up with new policies which
helped defuse the domestic dis
sent. As Fallows writes:
"Recall how fast protest
ebbed with the coming of the
volunteer Army and "Vietnam
ization" (shitting the direct
combat roles to the South Viet
namese soldiers) in the early
19705. For this reason, the likes
of Nixon and Kissinger might
regard a return to the draft as a
step in the wrong direction, for
it would sap the resolve neces
sary for a strong foreign policy
and introduce the weakening
element of domestic dissent."
The practical effect of a fair
draft by lottery is to hold the
public hostage to the conse
quences of its leaders' de
cisions. Undoubtedly, General
Haig and President Reagan are

also aware ot this.
"If citizens are willing to
countenance a decision that
means someone's child may die,
they may contemplate more
deeply if there is a possibility
that child will be theirs,"
Fallows suggests. "A bellicose
columnist or Congressman
should have to contemplate the
possibility that his son (or
daughter?) would be there, in
the trench or tank."
President Ronald Reagan's
opposition to the draft as
"slavery" and his further op
position to the drafting of wom
en actually would give him
greater flexibility to assert
American military muscle. If
the administration really be
lieved the next war will be a pro
tracted land battle against the
Russians, we'd have had a uni
versal draft yesterday. But the
next military incursion, like the
last several, is likely to be a re
source war, fought to protect
multinational economic in
terests somewhere in the Third
World.
But how long would a Presi
dent or party stay in office while
shipping home from El Salvador
or Iran the shattered bodies of
18-year-old girls or the sons of
Stanford or Harvard?
Meanwhile, today's army is
nearly 40 percent black. That's
MacNamara's affirmative ac
tion with a vengeance — a black
and brown army defending a
white society. The Pentagon
itself projects that in two years
the Army will be 42 percent
black — and for the first time in
our history the majority of com
bat troops will be racial minor
ities.
White or non-white, even
more disproportionate is the
number from lower-income
backgrounds. Libertarians may
couch their arguments in terms

ot free choice; but the reality is
that we already have a draft —
it's called "economic conscrip
tion."
The Soviets may have their
proxies in the Cubans, but so
does America have proxies in its
underclass. One in ten high
school graduates enter the "vol
unteer" Army each year. But
ask yourself how many of your
high school chums are currently
assigned combat units or chew
ing dust in Marine boot camps?
The critical question —
"Whose sons will serve and"
die?" — should be faced up to
openly. Despite the selfish hy
pocrisy that a revisionist his
tory of the anti-war movement
can expose, the attitude among
today's youth may be iar more
useful to the men in the Pen
tagon. As Fallows notes, at least
the '60s demonstrators' lip ser
vice to Kant's categorical im
perative — "their point was that
no one should go to war, starting
with them."
Lately the student posilion is
too easily summed up as "Not
me," while across campus anti-
Iranian uprisings scream for
blood and in the dining hall
sophomores applaud tough talk
in Time and Newsweek about
the need for show ot strength.
It's easy to agitate or be
apathetic about war when it
won't affect you or your chil
dren.
For those who dbn't buy
Fallow's strategy, to hold the
politicians hostage with an
equitable draft, then at least the
anti-draft elite should consider
reorienting its rhetoric to de
mand. "No more war any
where," and not simply, Hell
no, we won't go."
