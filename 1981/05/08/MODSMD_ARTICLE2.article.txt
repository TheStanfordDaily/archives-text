# OSOC organizers determined to keep up unionization effort
## 
### J. Raymond Mills 
It was not a tearful scene last night
at the Women's Center, site of the Of
fice Staff Organizing Committee's
when the announcement
was made that a majority ot clerical
and library workers had voted against
union representation.
The festive and hopeful atmosphere
that characterized the gathering- of
about 30 union advocates throughout
the voting and ballot counting process
carried over into OSOC's would-be
victory party.
Spirit not broken
"Everyone is asking what we're
going to do now." said Steve Prem
inger,president of United Stanford
Employees Local 715, "We're going to
find out what the workers want to do. I
can see by the attitudes of everyone
here that the vote has not doused the
spirit ot the people. The campaign will
continue till the fight is won."
Tipps-Coats embraced
OSOC president Joyce Tipps-Coats
was greeted with applause and warm
embraces when she arrived at the par
ty after the ballot tabulating at Memo
rial Auditorium was completed. 930
clericals voted for the union, while 554
voted against it.
"I think we've done a lot of good
work," Tipps-Coats said, "We did

manage to raise some consciousness
on campus, now we are aware ot the
progress that still has to be made. We
won't stop here."
Tipps-Coats was recently elected to
a one-year term on the West Bay
Health Systems Agency governing
board, a federally funded group that
helps to plan and approve the building
and renovation of health facilities in
the West Bay.
She will also return to her position
as a Secretary II at Stanford Linear
Accelerater (SLAC) on Monday after
a 40-day personal leave of absence to
work full-time on the union election in
itiative.
There were few bitter words
directed toward the University ad
ministration, which was the main op
position to OSOC's unionization effort.
However, Preminger did express con
cern over what he viewed as a Univer
sity attempt to discredit the work ot
USE Local 715.
'Pernicious' campaign
"The University conducted a per
nicious and intimidating campaign
and distorted what Local 715 is," Pre
minger said
(In sharp contrast, a labor expert
for the University counsel, however,
called the University's campaign
"straightforward, clean") "They

used the old 'stereotype' tactic. I know
trom my experience that we're one oi
the best unions around, the member
ship calls the shots and they will
assess where we are now and what
direction we'll take in the future," he
added.
Union struggle to continue
Most union hopefuls were satisfied
to think of the long campaign as "only
a beginning" to their struggle.
"Because of collective organizing
efforts such as this, working women
are on the agenda today," said Julia
Harvey, a retired Stanford employee
and union worker, "We've got to keep
going, this defeat is an obstacle, but
we must keep moving ahead."
New song
After a period of reading telegrams
from organizations and individuals
across the country who supported
OSOC's unionization drive, workers
joined in singing the hymn "I Shall Not
Be Moved," with lyrics adjusted to
convey a slightly different message:
"We're not afraid of Wheeler, we
shall not be moved./ We'll pay no heed
to Donald, we shall not be moved."
"Our goals are clear," said union
worker Gloria Allen. "We came here
tonight to either celebrate a victory or
to launch a new campaign. This is only
a beginning and we'll soon be back."
