## House considers voting act renewal 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Debate on ex
tension of the Voting Rights Act
of 965 began Wednesday with a
poignant and emotional journey
into the nation's embarrassing
past — to the Selma march, the
burning of black churches in
Georgia and the murders ot civil
rights workers.
One of the guides was Vernon
Jordan, a black raised in the
South who saw some of its worst
days as a young civil rights
worker in the 1960s and now is
president of the National Urban
League.
"As I sit here, I am reminded
of the many black and white
men and women who are not
here today, who were killed in
the thick of battle between 1962
and 1967, Jordan told a House
Judiciary subcommittee.
"As I sit here, I think of
Medgar Evers, Clifton Walker,
Michael Schwerner, James
Chaney, Andrew Goodman,
Jimmie Lee Jackson, James

Reeb, Viola Liuzzo, Sam Young,
Jonathan Daniels. Freddie Lee
Thomas and Vernon Dahmer."
Emotional moment
Each was a fallen civil rights
worker and, as Jordan read
their names, his voice cracked
with emotion.
Jordan told how the Mt. Olive
Baptist Church in Terrell Coun
ty, Ga., was burned to the
ground "with a picture ot Jesus
and the president of the United
States on the wall" several days
after a civil rights meeting
there.
He told how a black man, 9'
years old, explained why he had
never bothered trying to reg
ister to vote. "I never believed
in putting myself in the way of
trouble a-comin'," he quoted
the old man.
Huge increase in voters
In 1964, the year before the
Voting Rights Act became law,
2.8 million blacks in 1 Southern
states were registered to vote.
Today, there are 4.2 million, an

increase that civil rights lead
ers attribute to that act, which
required state and local of
ficials in the South to demon
strate that election laws did not
discriminate against minor
ities.
Aug. 6 of next year is the date
ot expiration of a provision that
requires Southern states with a
history of discrimination to
have approval in advance from
the Justice Department or a fed
eral court for any election rules
change.
Wednesday's hearing opened
what is expected to be a long and
hard-fought battle over extend
ing the act that Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.) and others
have said they want to rewrite.
Distinguished proponents
It was clearly a day for propo
nents of extension, as some of
the civil rights movement's
oldest and best friends testified.
Among them were Jordan;
Benjamin Hooks, executive di
rector of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People; Lane Kirkland,
president of the AFL-CIO; Wil
liam>.Velasquez, executive di
rector of the Southwest Voter
Education Project; and Joseph
Rauh of the Leadership Con
ference on Civil Rights.
Each noted the act's symbolic
importance to black and
Spanish-speaking Americans
and urged a 10-year extension.
"In the midst of all the con
servatism, the heat and the
doubt, and the resurgence of the
Ku Kluxjtlan," it is important

for Congress to "send a
message "of continued concern
to minorities, Hooks said.
Brutal, mean-spirited
"What happened in the South
wasn't happenstance," said
Hooks, who grew up in southern
Tennessee. "It was brutal. It
was intentional It was mean
spirited. It deprived people of
their rights. I have been in situ
ations where I was frightened
out of my wits. And I don't want
to take the chance of having to
go back."
The sharpest questioning
came from Rep Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.) sponsor of a com
promise proposal for an'£nd to
federal clearance in advance of
changes in local and state voting
laws.
'In the penalty box'
"... A handful ot Southern
states have been in the penalty
box tor nearly years," said
Hyde, a member of the constitu
tional rights subcommittee.
"They have improved their vot
ing rights record."
"I believe in equality. God
knows I do!" Jordan replied. '*1
do not trust these people in the
South with my rights."
Hyde's proposal would re
quire groups with voting-rights
complaints to seek relief in fed
eral courts. Rauh charged that
Hyde was "anti-historical."
For 95 years, between the rat
ification of the : sth Amendment
to the Constitution and the Vot
ing Rights Act, "court action
was a complete failure, and I
have no reason to think it would
be successful now," Rauh said.

Education Project; and Joseph
Rauh of the Leadership Con

Each noted the act's symbolic
importance to black and
Spanish-speaking Americans
and urged a 10-year extension.
"In the midst of all the con
servatism, the heat and the
doubt, and the resurgence of the
Ku Kluxjtlan," it is important

for Congress to "send a
message "of continued concern
to minorities, Hooks said.
Brutal, mean-spirited
"What happened in the South
wasn't happenstance," said
Hooks, who grew up in southern
Tennessee. "It was brutal. It
was intentional It was mean
spirited. It deprived people of
their rights. I have been in situ
ations where I was frightened
out of my wits. And I don't want
to take the chance of having to
go back."
The sharpest questioning
came from Rep Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.) sponsor of a com
promise proposal for an'£nd to
federal clearance in advance of
changes in local and state voting
laws.
'In the penalty box'
"... A handful ot Southern
states have been in the penalty
box tor nearly years," said
Hyde, a member of the constitu
tional rights subcommittee.
"They have improved their vot
ing rights record."
"I believe in equality. God
knows I do!" Jordan replied. '*1
do not trust these people in the
South with my rights."
Hyde's proposal would re
quire groups with voting-rights
complaints to seek relief in fed
eral courts. Rauh charged that
Hyde was "anti-historical."
For 95 years, between the rat
ification of the : sth Amendment
to the Constitution and the Vot
ing Rights Act, "court action
was a complete failure, and I
have no reason to think it would
be successful now," Rauh said.
Washington — Debate on ex
tension of the Voting Rights Act
of 965 began Wednesday with a
poignant and emotional journey
into the nation's embarrassing
past — to the Selma march, the
burning of black churches in
Georgia and the murders ot civil
rights workers.
One of the guides was Vernon
Jordan, a black raised in the
South who saw some of its worst
days as a young civil rights
worker in the 1960s and now is
president of the National Urban
League.
"As I sit here, I am reminded
of the many black and white
men and women who are not
here today, who were killed in
the thick of battle between 1962
and 1967, Jordan told a House
Judiciary subcommittee.
"As I sit here, I think of
Medgar Evers, Clifton Walker,
Michael Schwerner, James
Chaney, Andrew Goodman,
Jimmie Lee Jackson, James

Reeb, Viola Liuzzo, Sam Young,
Jonathan Daniels. Freddie Lee
Thomas and Vernon Dahmer."
Emotional moment
Each was a fallen civil rights
worker and, as Jordan read
their names, his voice cracked
with emotion.
Jordan told how the Mt. Olive
Baptist Church in Terrell Coun
ty, Ga., was burned to the
ground "with a picture ot Jesus
and the president of the United
States on the wall" several days
after a civil rights meeting
there.
He told how a black man, 9'
years old, explained why he had
never bothered trying to reg
ister to vote. "I never believed
in putting myself in the way of
trouble a-comin'," he quoted
the old man.
Huge increase in voters
In 1964, the year before the
Voting Rights Act became law,
2.8 million blacks in 1 Southern
states were registered to vote.
Today, there are 4.2 million, an

increase that civil rights lead
ers attribute to that act, which
required state and local of
ficials in the South to demon
strate that election laws did not
discriminate against minor
ities.
Aug. 6 of next year is the date
ot expiration of a provision that
requires Southern states with a
history of discrimination to
have approval in advance from
the Justice Department or a fed
eral court for any election rules
change.
Wednesday's hearing opened
what is expected to be a long and
hard-fought battle over extend
ing the act that Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.) and others
have said they want to rewrite.
Distinguished proponents
It was clearly a day for propo
nents of extension, as some of
the civil rights movement's
oldest and best friends testified.
Among them were Jordan;
Benjamin Hooks, executive di
rector of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Col
ored People; Lane Kirkland,
president of the AFL-CIO; Wil
liam>.Velasquez, executive di
rector of the Southwest Voter
Education Project; and Joseph
