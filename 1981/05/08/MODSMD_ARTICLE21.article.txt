# Investigators can't prove that Hinckley stalked presidents
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — In
vestigators have "no hard evi
dence" that accused presiden
tial assailant John Hinckley had
been stalking President Ronald
Reagan or other political fig
ures, federal law enforcement
sources said Wednesday.
These sources, who declined
to be identified, said that feder
al investigators have estab
lished that Hinckley was in
three cities last October at
roughly the same time as Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, and that he
had visited Washington three
times in the months before his
arrest March 30 on charges of
attempting to assassinate Pres
ident Reagan.
The sources said that
Hinckley had been in Nashville,
Chicago and Dayton, Ohio, at
times that Carter was there dur
ing the presidential campaign
last fall, and that he had visited
Washington, D.C., in late Sep
tember, mid-October and early
February.
But: "There is no hard evi
dence that he planned a de
liberate strategy of stalking any
public figure," one source said.
"The evidence at this time fits a
theory that those instances
were coincidental."
The sources noted that during
the Chicago visit, Carter simply
landed and took off without
making a campaign tour of the
city. Nevertheless, the sources
said the possibility of stalking

has not been ruled out entirely.
They said investigators had
found nothing relating to
Hinckley's visits to Washington
"to indicate any plan at that
time to carry out an assassina
tion."
According to these sources,
the investigative findings thus
far are contained in a roughly
'.200-page summary of the
probe. The sources said that the
summary, based on an in
vestigation conducted by the
FBI, Secret Service and the Dis
trict of Columbia police, was
forwarded last Friday to At
torney General William French
Smith, FBI Director William
Webster and the U.S. attorney
tor the District of Columbia,
Charles Ruff, the prosecutor in
the case.
The investigation, which has
already entailed more than 1000
interviews, is still continuing in
an effort to avoid the kinds of af
ter-the-fact questions and con
spiracy theories which have
arisen in other assassination at
tempts in the United States, the
sources said.
They said the summary con
tains forensic science data, the
analysis of the crime scene out
side the Washington Hilton Ho
tel where Reagan and three oth
ers were wounded, information
on Hinckley's travels, funding
and character, and data about
the weapons allegedly used in
the attack.
