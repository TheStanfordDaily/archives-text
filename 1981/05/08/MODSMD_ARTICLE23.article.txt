# Reagan economic program has Wall Street worried
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Even as President
Ronald Reagan is winning the battle in
Congress over the first phase of his "eco
nomic recovery program," he is losing a
struggle that his own senior aides con
sider at least as important: the struggle
for hearts and minds on Wall Street.
The Reagan economic plan may be
boffo in Washington, but in the financial
markets of New York interest rates have
soared and other signs of uneasiness
abound. The long-term bond market is all
but moribund, and the principal
architect of the Reagan plan, budget di
rector David Stockman, acknowledges
that his earlier, rosy predictions for low
er interest rates and revived bond mar
kets have proven premature.

News analysis

The new administration's failure to
make the impression on Wall Street it
had hoped for is causing strain inside the
White House and among some conserva
tive Republican backers of "supply
side" economics on Capitol Hill.
One of those. Rep. Jack Kemp (R-
N.Y.), blames much of what has gone
wrong in the financial markets on the
Federal Reserve Board. "One has to

question whether or not they know what
they're doing," Kemp said of the Fed's
governors. Unexpected growth in the
money supply — which the adminis
tration and the Fed both agree publicly
should be controlled — is one factor that
has alarmed the financial markets,
pushing down the bond market and pro
pelling the prime rate to 19 percent.
Blame the Fed
Some administration officials also
blame the Fed for mismanaging the
money supply in a way that brought on
the new interest-rate crunch. But on the
record the White House has supported
the Fed, and privately senior officials
say that if the Fed did make a mistake, it
was inadvertent and temporary.
" If we can't turn the 112 inancial markets
around, then we can't succeed," Stock
man said in an interview this week.
"There's a much deeper skepticism in
the markets than anyone expected," he
added, speaking of Wall Street's attitude
toward the Reagan economic program.
As Stockman admitted, this is a sub
stantial change in his own tune. Just a
few months ago he was confident that
when Wall Street realized how de
termined the administration was to cut
the budget and taxes too, improvements

in the investment markets would be dra
matic, and interest rates would tall.
Bond market mirrors future
The bond market is crucial for the
Reagan theorists because it mirrors
what sophisticated investors think the
long-term future will bring. For several
years, those investors have signaled
their belief that high inflation will con
tinue. So far, nothing the Reagan admin
istration has done has changed their
minds. Without a change in outlook and a
corresponding reduction in Jong-term in
terest rates, companies will continue to
have trouble raising the capital for ex
pansion — the economic growth Presi
dent Reagan promises.
In the interview Stockman said em
phatically that the markets still will im
prove, but that this will take longer than
he originally hoped. Now, he said. Wall
Street will be waiting tor irrefutable evi
dence that Congress will go beyond the
budget resolutions that outline cuts in
many spending programs to the final leg
islative action that will secure the
budget reductions.
But on Wall Street many money men
say they are waiting for more than that.
An influential school of Wall Street econ
omists typified by Henry Kaufman of
Salomon Brothers and Albert Wo

jnilower of the First Boston Corp. has en
couraged deep skepticism about the Rea
gan plan's prospects.
Kaufman — who also predicted the re
cent rise in interest rates — and Wo
jnilower both regard the Reagan-Stock
man budget proposals as essentially ex
pansionary and thus inflationary. The
economists say the administration's pro
posed reductions in domestic spending
will be more than offset by its program
tor expanding defense spending and its
tax-cutting plans. On balance, they say.
the federal budget will continue to stimu
late the national economy. If the Federal
Reserve Board is simultaneously re
stricting growth of the money supply, de
mand tor money will outpace supply and
interest rates will rise, according to both
economists.
Has the administration already lost its
fight to win over Wall Street? Stockman
and other officials refused to accept that
proposition.
The administration hopes it can revive
confidence by demonstrating its seri
ousness about cutting the budget and by
emphasizing how significantly its pro
gram would reduce the burden of federal
taxes and the proportion of gross na
tional product eaten up by government
activity.

soared and other signs of uneasiness
abound. The long-term bond market is all
but moribund, and the principal
architect of the Reagan plan, budget di
rector David Stockman, acknowledges
that his earlier, rosy predictions for low
er interest rates and revived bond mar
kets have proven premature.

News analysis

The new administration's failure to
make the impression on Wall Street it
had hoped for is causing strain inside the
White House and among some conserva
tive Republican backers of "supply
side" economics on Capitol Hill.
One of those. Rep. Jack Kemp (R-
N.Y.), blames much of what has gone
wrong in the financial markets on the
Federal Reserve Board. "One has to

question whether or not they know what
they're doing," Kemp said of the Fed's
governors. Unexpected growth in the
money supply — which the adminis
tration and the Fed both agree publicly
should be controlled — is one factor that
has alarmed the financial markets,
pushing down the bond market and pro
pelling the prime rate to 19 percent.
Blame the Fed
Some administration officials also
blame the Fed for mismanaging the
money supply in a way that brought on
the new interest-rate crunch. But on the
record the White House has supported
the Fed, and privately senior officials
say that if the Fed did make a mistake, it
was inadvertent and temporary.
" If we can't turn the 112 inancial markets
around, then we can't succeed," Stock
man said in an interview this week.
"There's a much deeper skepticism in
the markets than anyone expected," he
added, speaking of Wall Street's attitude
toward the Reagan economic program.
As Stockman admitted, this is a sub
stantial change in his own tune. Just a
few months ago he was confident that
when Wall Street realized how de
termined the administration was to cut
the budget and taxes too, improvements

in the investment markets would be dra
matic, and interest rates would tall.
Bond market mirrors future
The bond market is crucial for the
Reagan theorists because it mirrors
what sophisticated investors think the
long-term future will bring. For several
years, those investors have signaled
their belief that high inflation will con
tinue. So far, nothing the Reagan admin
istration has done has changed their
minds. Without a change in outlook and a
corresponding reduction in Jong-term in
terest rates, companies will continue to
have trouble raising the capital for ex
pansion — the economic growth Presi
dent Reagan promises.
In the interview Stockman said em
phatically that the markets still will im
prove, but that this will take longer than
he originally hoped. Now, he said. Wall
Street will be waiting tor irrefutable evi
dence that Congress will go beyond the
budget resolutions that outline cuts in
many spending programs to the final leg
islative action that will secure the
budget reductions.
But on Wall Street many money men
say they are waiting for more than that.
An influential school of Wall Street econ
omists typified by Henry Kaufman of
Salomon Brothers and Albert Wo

jnilower of the First Boston Corp. has en
couraged deep skepticism about the Rea
gan plan's prospects.
Kaufman — who also predicted the re
cent rise in interest rates — and Wo
jnilower both regard the Reagan-Stock
man budget proposals as essentially ex
pansionary and thus inflationary. The
economists say the administration's pro
posed reductions in domestic spending
will be more than offset by its program
tor expanding defense spending and its
tax-cutting plans. On balance, they say.
the federal budget will continue to stimu
late the national economy. If the Federal
Reserve Board is simultaneously re
stricting growth of the money supply, de
mand tor money will outpace supply and
interest rates will rise, according to both
economists.
Has the administration already lost its
fight to win over Wall Street? Stockman
and other officials refused to accept that
proposition.
The administration hopes it can revive
confidence by demonstrating its seri
ousness about cutting the budget and by
emphasizing how significantly its pro
gram would reduce the burden of federal
taxes and the proportion of gross na
tional product eaten up by government
activity.
