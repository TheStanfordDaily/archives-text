# Women netters to battle BYU, No. 1 Trojans
## 
### Steve Odell 
Like a jigsaw puzzle miss
ing a coupie of its key pieces,
the Stanford women's tennis
team will nevertheless try to
'' put it together'' against two
top-ranked and undefeated
teams at Stanford Tennis
Stadium this weekend. The
Cards host the No.l ranked
USC Trojans (27-0) today at 1
p.m. and entertain the No. 4
ranked BYU Wildcats (6-0,
'8-0) tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Missing from the Cardinal
P line-up this weekend will be
ISusy Jaeger, who continues
to be hampered by sore teet;
I'and Michelle Weiss, who, af
ter coming back from a
sprained ankle on Tuesday,
contracted a case ot pneu
nionia on Wednesday.
The Cards will probably
try to fill those vacant spots
with junior Sue Rasmussen,
who had been playing six up
until the Los Angeles trip
three weeks ago. and Gayle
Chan, who saw action at
number six last year, and
who will most likely be back
in that position again.
"Gayle has been playing
hard and doing very well,"
Stanford coach Frank Bren
nan said. Indeed. Chan's ac
tions as-of-late back up her
coach's words. Last week,
she breezed through quali
fying of the Cal State Invita
tional Tournament and in the
first round played last year's
no. 1 Trojan and current pro
Trey Lewis, losing onlv 6-4.
7-6.
The Cards are not the only
ones with their troops a bit
depleted, however. USC's
number one player, Anne
White, turned professional
almost a month ago. Still, the
Trojans, who have been atop
the collegiate tennis throne
for the last two years, have
not been knocked off yet.
They bring a 62-match win

ning streak to the Farm, and
have beaten No. 3 UCLA
twice and Stanford once
since White started wielding
her racket for money.
"They're still very
tough," admitted Brennan.
"They're easier (without
White), but they're not easy
by any means. We still have a
good shot."
USC coach Dave Borelli
spoke likewise "It's going to
be a tough match. Stanford's
a very good team. But I feel
that it's in our own hands. If
we play well. I really teel
we'll win no matter what
anybody else does. However,
if we don't play well, we'll
lose. It's as simple as that."
With two ot the top six
Cards missing from the
deck. Stanford's strength
will lie primarily in the top of
the line-up. On top for the
Cards is Alvcia Moulton. who
is playing "exceptionally
well" according to Brennan.
"She's playing her best ten
nis ot the year."
Also somewhere near the
top will be senior and team
captain Donna Rubin and
freshman Elise Burgin. Both
telt the Cards had what it
takes to upset the Trojans.
"We have the capability,"
Burgin said "Whether we do
it or not remains to be seen,
but the capability is there. I
honestly think we have a
chance to beat them. "
Rubin agreed with her
rookie teammate. "It's a sit
uation we haven't been in
before," she said. "But we
have to accept it, and call
within ourselves for more
strength. It makes you a
tougher competitor. I think
we can still win this match.
Everything is within our
range."
Stanford has played USC
twice before this year, with
varying results. The 'first

time the two teams met, the
Trojans smothered the
Cards, clinching the match
early by winning all six sin
gles matches in straight sets.
When Stanford traveled
down to Los Angeles, how
ever, it was a different story
altogether. Fighting to a 3-3
tie after the singles, the
Cards lost the match and a
chance to stop USC's then 55-
match winning streak by
dropping two of three
doubles.
And the doubles, it is safe
to assume, will be where the
victor is determined this

time around also That could
present a problem tor Bren
nan. who was considering
switching his pairs around
earlier this week to make up
for the absence of Weiss and
Jaeger
For BYU, it is their first
trip ever to the Bay Area and
their first time they have
met Stanford this year
The Wildcats are led by
senior Tracy Tanner, who
won the Region-7 singles
championship last week.
BYU's other top player,
Heather Ludloff, has been
hampered by a sore ankle

and has not played the last
three matches

The match will be a testing
ground for the 'Cats, as they
have not taced any of the
"Big Three" (Stanford,
USC, UCLA) yet this year.
Still, they are highly touted
and will present a challenge
for the Cards.
"This is a big. big weekend
tor us," said Brennan. "I'm
hoping tor a good crowd.
We're going to need it. It's
always a little different with
some good tan support."

Team captain Donna Rubin will play a big hand in determining the Stanford women's tennis
team's fortunes this weekend. The Cards will face top-ranked USC today and fourth-ranked
BYU tomorrow at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Like a jigsaw puzzle miss
ing a coupie of its key pieces,
the Stanford women's tennis
team will nevertheless try to
'' put it together'' against two
top-ranked and undefeated
teams at Stanford Tennis
Stadium this weekend. The
Cards host the No.l ranked
USC Trojans (27-0) today at 1
p.m. and entertain the No. 4
ranked BYU Wildcats (6-0,
'8-0) tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Missing from the Cardinal
P line-up this weekend will be
ISusy Jaeger, who continues
to be hampered by sore teet;
I'and Michelle Weiss, who, af
ter coming back from a
sprained ankle on Tuesday,
contracted a case ot pneu
nionia on Wednesday.
The Cards will probably
try to fill those vacant spots
with junior Sue Rasmussen,
who had been playing six up
until the Los Angeles trip
three weeks ago. and Gayle
Chan, who saw action at
number six last year, and
who will most likely be back
in that position again.
"Gayle has been playing
hard and doing very well,"
Stanford coach Frank Bren
nan said. Indeed. Chan's ac
tions as-of-late back up her
coach's words. Last week,
she breezed through quali
fying of the Cal State Invita
tional Tournament and in the
first round played last year's
no. 1 Trojan and current pro
Trey Lewis, losing onlv 6-4.
7-6.
The Cards are not the only
ones with their troops a bit
depleted, however. USC's
number one player, Anne
White, turned professional
almost a month ago. Still, the
Trojans, who have been atop
the collegiate tennis throne
for the last two years, have
not been knocked off yet.
They bring a 62-match win

ning streak to the Farm, and
have beaten No. 3 UCLA
twice and Stanford once
since White started wielding
her racket for money.
"They're still very
tough," admitted Brennan.
"They're easier (without
White), but they're not easy
by any means. We still have a
good shot."
USC coach Dave Borelli
spoke likewise "It's going to
be a tough match. Stanford's
a very good team. But I feel
that it's in our own hands. If
we play well. I really teel
we'll win no matter what
anybody else does. However,
if we don't play well, we'll
lose. It's as simple as that."
With two ot the top six
Cards missing from the
deck. Stanford's strength
will lie primarily in the top of
the line-up. On top for the
Cards is Alvcia Moulton. who
is playing "exceptionally
well" according to Brennan.
"She's playing her best ten
nis ot the year."
Also somewhere near the
top will be senior and team
captain Donna Rubin and
freshman Elise Burgin. Both
telt the Cards had what it
takes to upset the Trojans.
"We have the capability,"
Burgin said "Whether we do
it or not remains to be seen,
but the capability is there. I
honestly think we have a
chance to beat them. "
Rubin agreed with her
rookie teammate. "It's a sit
uation we haven't been in
before," she said. "But we
have to accept it, and call
within ourselves for more
strength. It makes you a
tougher competitor. I think
we can still win this match.
Everything is within our
range."
Stanford has played USC
twice before this year, with
varying results. The 'first

time the two teams met, the
Trojans smothered the
Cards, clinching the match
early by winning all six sin
gles matches in straight sets.
When Stanford traveled
down to Los Angeles, how
ever, it was a different story
altogether. Fighting to a 3-3
tie after the singles, the
Cards lost the match and a
chance to stop USC's then 55-
match winning streak by
dropping two of three
doubles.
And the doubles, it is safe
to assume, will be where the
victor is determined this
