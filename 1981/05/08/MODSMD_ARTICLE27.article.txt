Many people are aware that
deGuerre Pool is the home of

championship swimming and
men's water polo teams, but
tew are aware ot another Stan
ford team there that is rapidly
moving up the ranks, the wom
en's water polo team.
Last year, the team placed
titth at the AAU National Cham
pionships held in Bloomington,
Indiana. This year the team ex
pects to improve upon last
year's finish. The results of the
last three tournaments show
that this may be possible.
On April It, the team traveled
to Anaheim to compete in their
first tourney ot the year. The
Cards started oft well by claim
ing third place. The competition
was very close with each of the
top three teams losing only
once. The final places had to be
determined by goal per
centages.
Two weeks ago, Stanford was
on the road again, this time
sending three teams to compete
in ChiCo. The "A" and "B"

teams were undefeated in the
tournament and returned home
with the "A" and"B" cham
pionship trophies. Stanford's
third team, "B prime" lost a
close game and therefore had to
settle tor a consolation finish in
the "B" tournament.
This past weekend, the "B"
team was undefeated in a tour
ney held in Berkeley, with their
best win coming over San Luis-
Obispo, 18-0. The Cards came
home with a third place finish
because there were several ties.
The team's next games are
this Saturday at 12:30 at de-
Guerre, against Cal-Berkley
and UC-Davis. These contests
will serve as a warm-up for next
week's nationals, being held in
Los Angeles.

198' season in the Northern Cali
fornia Cricket League by com
fortable margins.

Their first game was against
the Cavaliers "B" Cricket Club,
and Stanford bowled out the
Cavs for a paltry 47 runs, mainly
due to the fine bowling per
formances of Urmi Mody, who
took three wickets, and Arshad

Stanford promptly hit up the
necessary runs tor victory and
lost only three wickets in Â£he k
process, thus winning by a total
ot seven wickets. John Pierce
was the high scorer with 19 runs.
The following week, the
Cards took first strike against
the San Jose Cricket Club and in
the mandatory 45 overs, scored
157 runs for the loss of seven
wickets. Indian International
'Test' player, Abid Ali, hit 39
runs and was ably supported by
Aruna Amirthanayagam who
scored 30 and Raiyomand, who

against Fresno Cricket Club, at
Fresno State, and the Cards

thrashed their hosts by 111 runs.
