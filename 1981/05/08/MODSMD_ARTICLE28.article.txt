# Cards travel south to face UCLA, USC

Los Angeles — Every year there is no more important midseason
milestone tor the Stanford men's tennis team than the annual trek
south to play perennial powers UCLA and USC. Momentum being
the coveted intangible that it is. the matches loom even larger with
the start of the NCAA tournament only eight days away.
Stanford meets UCLA (19-2, 7-1 in the Pacific-'0 Conference) to
day at 1 p.m. before going cross-town to face the Trojans (24-8, 3-5)
tomorrow at : p.m.
The Cards are 16-0 (8-0 in league play) this season, and haven't
really been challenged. As a matter of fact, there hasn't been a
match as close as 5-4 — yet. "I've never had a team do that," coach
Dick Gould said. "Of course, we haven't played UCLA and USC
down there either."
The matches here are unquestionably Stanford's toughest road
trip every year. In 4 previous trips south, Gould's teams have only
swept both matches twice — in ' 978 and last season.
Since both of those teams won the NCAA title, a sweep here would
be agood sign for the superstitious. For the logical, however, a bet
ter sign would be a healthy Scott Bondurant.
The junior sat out all three matches last week with neck prob
lems. He has been working out this week "at three-quarter speed, "
according to Gould, but his status won't be known until just before
today's match.
The rest of the starting lineup has been decided, but Gould
wouldn't divulge his secrets. The top three — Tim Mayotte, Scott
Davis and Jim Gurfein — will remain the same, but the rest hinges
on Bondurant. If he doesn't play, then no decision will have to be
made between juniors Jeff Arons and John Corse atthe bottom of
the lineup.
However, with Bondurant in the singles lineup and Mike Falberg
right behind him, someone will have to watch from the stands. Odds
are Corse will play, both because of his 9-1 record (Arons is 7-7) and
his ability dn slow courts like those at UCLA.
In preparation for the slower pace Gould had the team practicing
at the courts behind Encina Gym instead of the Tennis Stadium
twice this week. pretty well in Ojai (Pac-tO championships
two weeks ago) on the slower courts," Gould said. "They are a little
slower than UCLA's."
The Bruins are at home on slower courts whether they are in
Westwood, Ojai or Forest Hills. Robbie Venter, who lost to Gurfein
at No. 3 singles in UCLA's 6-3 loss to Stanford last month, had a
match point against llth-seeded Victor Pecci before losing 6-7, 6-3,
7-6 in the second round of the Tournament of Champions in New
York.
Nonetheless, Venter will remain at No. 3 behind Marcel Freeman
and Blaine Willenborg. The rest of the lineup will be Dan Saltz, who
dealt Bondurant his only loss this season, talented freshman John
Davis and Bruce Brescia.
That USC coach Dick Leach is worried more about Cal than Stan
ford comes as a surprise until one realizes the importance of today's
match between the schools. The NCAA demands that the national
tournament have teams from across the country. Even though both
teams are clearly among the nation's-top '.6, the loser between Cal
and USC might not get an invitation.
A win over Stanford would carry a great deal of weight — it might
carry the Trojans all the way to the tournament site in Georgia. But
even with a possible let down after the UCLA match, Stanford is
simply too strong, Leach said.
"They probably will (let down) but they are so much better than
us it won't matter. They are the best team in the country I've seen so
far," Leach said.
USC has a lot of good players this year but a dearth of very good
ones. Leach jumped Roger Knapp from No. 3 to No. 1 over Billy
Nealon and Sean Brawley after the duo won only one match between
them in the Trojans' first seven Pac-10 matches.
But Knapp has been devastated by both Scott Davis and Freeman
since the change. Thus Leach is re-instituting Nealon in the top spot.

That USC coach Dick Leach is worried more about Cal than Stan
ford comes as a surprise until one realizes the importance of today's
match between the schools. The NCAA demands that the national
tournament have teams from across the country. Even though both
teams are clearly among the nation's-top '.6, the loser between Cal
and USC might not get an invitation.
A win over Stanford would carry a great deal of weight — it might
carry the Trojans all the way to the tournament site in Georgia. But
even with a possible let down after the UCLA match, Stanford is
simply too strong, Leach said.
"They probably will (let down) but they are so much better than
us it won't matter. They are the best team in the country I've seen so
far," Leach said.
USC has a lot of good players this year but a dearth of very good
ones. Leach jumped Roger Knapp from No. 3 to No. 1 over Billy
Nealon and Sean Brawley after the duo won only one match between
them in the Trojans' first seven Pac-10 matches.
But Knapp has been devastated by both Scott Davis and Freeman
since the change. Thus Leach is re-instituting Nealon in the top spot.
