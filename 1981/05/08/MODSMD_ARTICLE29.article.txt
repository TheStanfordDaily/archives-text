# Card golfers finish fifth in Pac-10
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
A crowd sat under the tree at the back of
the 18th green of Stanford golf course yes
terday, whispering even though there were
no goiters around. They whispered because
it telt like a tension-filled golf tournament,
and qne whispers at those kinds of things.
Down the 18th fairway another crowd was
barely visible through a cluster of trees,
where Ron Commans of Southern California
and Tony Grimes of Arizona State were
creating most of the excitement.
As of that moment, Commans was relin
quishing all chances of first place in the
final round of the Pacific-10 championships,
as he double bogied the par-three • 7th hole.
Arizona State, the one time home of pro
tessional goiter Tom Weiskopf, had only one
hole to go and two pars to make before not
just running away with the tournament, but
tying two golfers for first place.
Grimes came from four strokes back with
a 68, overcoming Commans and catching
teammate Dan Forsman who was one-over
for the day, and previously the single lead
er. Commans was on his way to a 74 and sec
ond or third place, depending on how you
counted the standings.
David Games of Stanford was part of the
crowd on 18, after finishing a half hour
before with 73, good enough for fourth at the
time. Cardinal coach David Yates also
whispered even though the foursome was
half down the fairway, "Games is third if
Commans bogies 18."
Which Commans did, slicing a five-iron
approach shot into a trap at the right-front
ot the green. He left his sand-shot 0 feet
short, his putt a toot long, and Games had
put together a remarkable performance to
put him in a tie with the second lowest
scores of the tournament.
Meanwhile Grimes and Forsman were
looking at a tace-off. Grimes put his ap
proach on the left fringe, pin high, but
across the green. Forsman found a dirt
patch beneath a tree behind Grimes. Both
chipped within eight feet of the cup, and
sank their putts to salvage par.
Forsman, originally from Mountain
View, played the most consistent golf of the
three-day, 72-hole tournament, turning in
two 71's for the 36 holes played Monday, 69

on Tuesday, and 72 yesterday Grimes had a
mediocre first round of 75, but made up for
on it on the second 18 Monday when he shot
67. He turned in 73-68 Tuesday and yester
day, respectively.
Commans was only one shot back of For
sman after 54 holes, with 212, 70-75-67, his
third round the low of the tournament. His
75 of yesterday was almost predictable,
similar to Games' performance in the early
rounds.
Games was a five-stroke after Monday's
rounds, shooting 68-68, 136 to Grimes' and
Forsman s 142. He shot 78 the third round
however, slipping to third place, tour
strokes back.
His performance put the Cardinals third
after the first day, while ASU were already
uncatchable in first place. (JSC and the Uni
versity of Oregon followed the Sun Devils in
second and fourth place. Games' third
round indicated the Cardinals performance
in general Tuesday, as they slipped to fifth
place and stayed there for the remainder of
the tournament.
ASU finished the tournament with 1456 to
USC's 1488. Oregon finished with 1490, while
UCLA took fourth place with 1499. The
Cardinals barely hung on to fifth with 1502,
as the University of Arizona finished only
four strokes back with '506.
The tournament was indicative of Stan
ford's play all season. The Cards have put
together one or two good rounds per tour
nament, but averaged 75 strokes per player
on the whole. One might have expected that
they would feel confident enough on their
home course to drop some of those strokes,
but Yates maintains that instead they began
to doubt themselves.
"They would get in spots where they had
been hitting seven irons all year, but instead
of hitting the seven iron, they would pick up
the book." Yates explained. The book said
168 yards, and they thought 'well that's a six
iron,' and then not know what club to use.
Once you start doubting yourself like that,
it's all over."
Games agrees with Yates, but described
his own breakdown in the third round a little
differently. "I went out and missed a tew
short putts at the beginning, and then
started doing mental gymnastics. Instead of

being patient I pressed it
As for the fourth round, trouble with his
putting once again seemed to affect his ov
erall game "I wasn't thinking confidently.
Even though I knew that the course was
going to be tougher and I wouldn't be able to
play agressively I was still too tentative,
hitting twitch-strokes. I was wishing the
ball in."
Part of the Cardinals' problem in general
could have been the course itself, which was
tougher than they have seen it in awhile. The
reason is that Yates has been getting it
ready for the NCAA championships, to be
played here May 27-30. Stanford has not
qualified for that tournament, but may be
allowed to compete as a home team exemp
tion.
With his play in the Pac-10, Games has
emerged as a possible contender for the in
dividual title. The Cardinals have won six
team championships in all, 1938 and '39,194".
and '42, and twice more, in 1946 and '953.
They are tied at fourth on the list of all-time
owners ot that title, but have taken first in
the individual standings only once, in '942
when Frank Tatum led the Cardinals to the
team championship as well
Games was not happy with his play after
the final round, regardless of the results, in
dicating that he might be just hungry
enough to do something wonderful in the
NCAA's. "Second or third, any ot that stuff
doesn't matter it you didn't win," he said,
shrugging.
As Games mulled over his performance
at the tournament, a foursome of middle
aged ladies pulled up to the 18th green in a
golf cart and got out. One of them chipped a
ball from the fringe, and watched it roll.
"Very nice," another said.
Meanwhile, Grimes sat in a cart, his
teammates on the hood or on the grass with
golf bags strewn around them. Forsman
was in the clubhouse talking to his fiance
long distance. They laughed and talked,
chewing on peanuts while they waited tor
their coach. Down a small slope, Games
stood looking at the leaderboard.
It was a fitting end to the day, as the
award table was folded up and the ladies
played the last green.
