# Reagan's budget passed by a large majority in the House
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — The House yesterday passed a $689 billion
budget plan drafted to President Ronald Reagan's pre
scription for economic recovery through massive cuts in
spending and taxes. Scores of Democrats jofned a unani
mous Republican minority to seal the lopsided decision.
It was the 112 inest legislative hour to date for Reagan, who
called it "a resounding victory, not only tor our economy
but tor a spirit of bipartisanship that we can build upon in
the months and years ahead."
'Historic moment'
"Today," he declared, "the people have been heard . . .
let us never forget this historic moment of commitment."
Reagan prevailed by 77 votes in the final tally. He re
aped the backing of all 90 Republican and 63 of the 241
Democrats for a margin of 253 to 176.
The chief executive had lobbied intensively to get his
measure through the one chamber where Democrats have
numerical control. Reagan successfully wooed conserva
tive Democrats to his side, and encouraged Republicans to
hold their ranks via private chats at the Oval Office, gifts
of presidential cufflinks and invitations to state dinrfers.
After the vote which made Reagan's blueprint the order
of business, the measure was passed — then a mere for
mality —■'by a margin of 270 to 154
On the key roll call, substituting the Reagan-endorsed
budget for the one drafted by the Democrats on the House
Budget Committee* 63 Democrats detected to give Reagan
his 77-vote victory.
Opponents of the president's proposal assailed it to the
end.
O'Neill aghast
"Do you want to meat-ax the programs that made
America great, or do you want to go slow in correcting er
rors of the past?" said Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass ), as he concluded debate in a chamber where hun
dreds ot congressmen listened silently and a packed gal
lery watched intently.
Although the Democrats hold a majority ot 241-190. it
was clear in days leading up to the vote that the House was
ready to back a president whose popularity, already high,
soared in the days following a March 30 assassination at
tempt.
"He's a winner and he's a hero," said House Majority
Whip Thomas Foley (D-Wash ), "and the American peo
ple like both. The feeling is that his program deserves a

chance." Ray Denison. chief lobbyist for the AFL-CIO.
which led the lobbying efforts against Reagan's budget
cuts, said of the congressmen, "It's almost a
metaphysical thing that's gripped these people — a feeling
they should do something even if it's wrong."
O'Neil made it clear the Democrats would try to hold
the Republicans responsible if the president's economic
plan goes sour.
"I guess the monkey is off the Democrats' back. The
federal program cuts, as brutal as they are. are the Rea
gan cuts," he said. "The deficits are the Reagan deficits."
The non-binding budget plan actually sets guidelines for
Congress to follow as it passes legislation later in the year,
and the precise nature of the cuts and size and shape ot the
tax plan won't be known for months.
Budget plan guidelines
The plan does require cuts of $36.6 billion in federal pro
grams, with the bulk of reductions ordered in social areas
such as food stamps, public service jobs, health care and
education. The plan calls for a $31 billion deficit, coupling
the deep cuts in social programs with an accelerated,
$188.8 billion defense budget.
On taxes, the plan leaves room for the three-year
across-the-board reductions the president favors as well
as cuts for businesses. The administration says its plan
will produce a balanced budget in 1984, the target Reagan
set when he ran for president last year.
The Democratic plan, by contrast, called for a slightly
smaller deficit in 1982, $25 6 billion, and envisioned a bal
anced budget in 1983.
The defeated Democratic alternative was carefully
crafted by the new Budget Committee chairman, Rep.
James Jones ot Oklahoma. It was skillfully enough bal
anced to win initial support from all but one of the Demo
crats on Jones' committee. It had the full backing of the
party's House leadership and of what purported to be a
powerful coalition of labor and liberal interest groups. But
when Reagan and Co went to work, they rolled the Demo
crats with surprising ease
The result, interviews with Democratic leaders and
rank-and-file members indicate, is likely to be heightened
criticism ot the Democratic leadership, greater
recriminations between liberal and conservative wings of
the party and a fraying of political ties between elected
Democrats and the interest-groups that have supported
them

From the Daily wire services
Washington — The House yesterday passed a $689 billion
budget plan drafted to President Ronald Reagan's pre
scription for economic recovery through massive cuts in
spending and taxes. Scores of Democrats jofned a unani
mous Republican minority to seal the lopsided decision.
It was the 112 inest legislative hour to date for Reagan, who
called it "a resounding victory, not only tor our economy
but tor a spirit of bipartisanship that we can build upon in
the months and years ahead."
'Historic moment'
"Today," he declared, "the people have been heard . . .
let us never forget this historic moment of commitment."
Reagan prevailed by 77 votes in the final tally. He re
aped the backing of all 90 Republican and 63 of the 241
Democrats for a margin of 253 to 176.
The chief executive had lobbied intensively to get his
measure through the one chamber where Democrats have
numerical control. Reagan successfully wooed conserva
tive Democrats to his side, and encouraged Republicans to
hold their ranks via private chats at the Oval Office, gifts
of presidential cufflinks and invitations to state dinrfers.
After the vote which made Reagan's blueprint the order
of business, the measure was passed — then a mere for
mality —■'by a margin of 270 to 154
On the key roll call, substituting the Reagan-endorsed
budget for the one drafted by the Democrats on the House
Budget Committee* 63 Democrats detected to give Reagan
his 77-vote victory.
Opponents of the president's proposal assailed it to the
end.
O'Neill aghast
"Do you want to meat-ax the programs that made
America great, or do you want to go slow in correcting er
rors of the past?" said Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass ), as he concluded debate in a chamber where hun
dreds ot congressmen listened silently and a packed gal
lery watched intently.
Although the Democrats hold a majority ot 241-190. it
was clear in days leading up to the vote that the House was
ready to back a president whose popularity, already high,
soared in the days following a March 30 assassination at
tempt.
"He's a winner and he's a hero," said House Majority
Whip Thomas Foley (D-Wash ), "and the American peo
ple like both. The feeling is that his program deserves a

chance." Ray Denison. chief lobbyist for the AFL-CIO.
which led the lobbying efforts against Reagan's budget
cuts, said of the congressmen, "It's almost a
metaphysical thing that's gripped these people — a feeling
they should do something even if it's wrong."
O'Neil made it clear the Democrats would try to hold
the Republicans responsible if the president's economic
plan goes sour.
"I guess the monkey is off the Democrats' back. The
federal program cuts, as brutal as they are. are the Rea
gan cuts," he said. "The deficits are the Reagan deficits."
The non-binding budget plan actually sets guidelines for
Congress to follow as it passes legislation later in the year,
and the precise nature of the cuts and size and shape ot the
tax plan won't be known for months.
Budget plan guidelines
The plan does require cuts of $36.6 billion in federal pro
grams, with the bulk of reductions ordered in social areas
such as food stamps, public service jobs, health care and
education. The plan calls for a $31 billion deficit, coupling
the deep cuts in social programs with an accelerated,
$188.8 billion defense budget.
On taxes, the plan leaves room for the three-year
across-the-board reductions the president favors as well
as cuts for businesses. The administration says its plan
will produce a balanced budget in 1984, the target Reagan
set when he ran for president last year.
