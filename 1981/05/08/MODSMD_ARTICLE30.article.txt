# Cardinal nine to play Cal
## 
### Chris Haft 
What usually takes place in huge metropolitan
stadiums will be occurring in rustic collegiate
ballparks. Action will unfold not in front of
thQupands of screaming tans, but before only a
tew hundred devotees
Nevertheless, all the other characteristics ot a
baseball pennant race will be present in this week
end's three-game series between Stanford and
California, beginning today at Berkeley's Evans
Field at 2:30 p.m. Rival teams are battling The
regular season is ending. And the chance for post
season play is at stake.
For the first time since *971, the Cardinals are
finishing the season'in truly climactic fashion —
contending for a playoft spot.
"This is the first time in my three years here
that I've ever been close., (to making the
playoffs)," shortstop Dave Meier said. "Usually
at this juncture we're 12-' 5."
The Southern Division's second-place team will
advance to the conference playoffs against the
Northern Division's first-place team, which will
likely be Washington State, though Oregon State
and Washington are only '.Va and 2 games behind,
respectively.
Stanford, 36-19 overall, owns a 14- : 3 record in
the Pacitic- : 0 Conference's Southern Division and
a second-place tie with Arizona. Both teams are
one game ahead of USC (13-14).
Even Cal (30-29-*, 11-16) is mathematically
alive. However, the Bears' hopes rest on an un
likely combination ot events: a sweep of Stanford,
an Arizona State sweep of Arizona and UCLA tak
ing at least two ot three trom USC.
The series continues tomorrow with a 1 p.m.
game here at Sunken Diamond and concludes Sun
day at 1 p.m. in Berkeley.
Trying to figure out who could capture second
place and the playoff spot would tax a computer.
Two-way ties could result between Stanford and
Arizona, Stanford and USC or Arizona and USC.
In that event, the team with the advantage dur
ing the regular season would advance. The Cards
would get the nod over Arizona (they beat the
Wildcats tour out ot six) but would lose out to USC
(which defeated Stanford four out of six). If Arizo
na and USC tie, the Wildcats advance.
A series ot coin flips at the Pac- : 0 offices in
Walnut Creek yesterday determined how a three
or even a four-way tie would be untangled.
Should Stanford, Arizona and USC tie, Arizona
must play at USC early next week for the right to
face Stanford. If Stanford, Arizona and Cal dead
lock each other, the Cards and Bears would meet

again at Berkeley next Monday or Tuesday, with
the winner playing Arizona
And if the inconceivable but remotely possible
tour-way tie transpires. Stanford-Cal and Arizo
na-USC playoffs would be held The winners
would play at the "southern" (Arizona or USC)
site.
ASU (23-4), which has already clinched the
Southern Division title, will gain an automatic
berth in the NCAA tournament if the South's
runner-up defeats the North champion Other
wise, the North winner plays at ASU tor the con
ference title.
The Cards, of course, can render all this mum
bo-jumbo useless by sweeping Cal Even winning
two out of three games would probably be enough
for Stanford. Arizona will be lucky to escape with
just a single victory over ASU, and USC would
have to sweep UCLA.
"If we take two out of three, we're in there,"
Meier affirmed.
The Cards can make getting in there a lot easier
by winning today's initial confrontation. "The big
one is tomorrow," catcher Bill Worden said yes
terday.
Last weekend, when Stanford pulled off its sur
prising sweep ot ASU, was full of big ones. And the
tact that the Cards dominated the nation's No. 1-
ranked team ought to give them extra emotional
incentive this weekend.
"It helps our attitude having swept A-State,"
Meier said. "If we had just swept UCLA (the hap
less Bruins are 6-21) it might have been dif
ferent."
The Cards hope matters will be different from
the last time they played Cal. The Bears took two
of three games from Stanford, their victories
coming on 11-10 and 12-* 1 scores.
"We didn't play well," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess recalled. "We walked a lot of peo
ple and gave them a lot of things."
Now, however, Marquess feels optimistic.
"We're playing as well as we've played all year,"
he said. Indeed, this year's club is probably the
most offensively potent one in Card history, hav
ing broken school single-season records for bat
ting average, runs scored, hits, doubles and home
runs.
Notes — Today's starting pitchers will be Brian
Myers (4-3) tor Stanford and Dave Granger (4-4)
tor Cal. Tomorrow, Stanford's Paul Grame (8-4)
opposes Chuck Cary (4-6), Cal's alternative to
Card Steve Cottrell (6-2) Sunday has not yet been
determined.

The series continues tomorrow with a 1 p.m.
game here at Sunken Diamond and concludes Sun
day at 1 p.m. in Berkeley.
Trying to figure out who could capture second
place and the playoff spot would tax a computer.
Two-way ties could result between Stanford and
Arizona, Stanford and USC or Arizona and USC.
In that event, the team with the advantage dur
ing the regular season would advance. The Cards
would get the nod over Arizona (they beat the
Wildcats tour out ot six) but would lose out to USC
(which defeated Stanford four out of six). If Arizo
na and USC tie, the Wildcats advance.
A series ot coin flips at the Pac- : 0 offices in
Walnut Creek yesterday determined how a three
or even a four-way tie would be untangled.
Should Stanford, Arizona and USC tie, Arizona
must play at USC early next week for the right to
face Stanford. If Stanford, Arizona and Cal dead
lock each other, the Cards and Bears would meet

again at Berkeley next Monday or Tuesday, with
the winner playing Arizona
And if the inconceivable but remotely possible
tour-way tie transpires. Stanford-Cal and Arizo
na-USC playoffs would be held The winners
would play at the "southern" (Arizona or USC)
site.
ASU (23-4), which has already clinched the
Southern Division title, will gain an automatic
berth in the NCAA tournament if the South's
runner-up defeats the North champion Other
wise, the North winner plays at ASU tor the con
ference title.
The Cards, of course, can render all this mum
bo-jumbo useless by sweeping Cal Even winning
two out of three games would probably be enough
for Stanford. Arizona will be lucky to escape with
just a single victory over ASU, and USC would
have to sweep UCLA.
"If we take two out of three, we're in there,"
Meier affirmed.
The Cards can make getting in there a lot easier
by winning today's initial confrontation. "The big
one is tomorrow," catcher Bill Worden said yes
terday.
Last weekend, when Stanford pulled off its sur
prising sweep ot ASU, was full of big ones. And the
tact that the Cards dominated the nation's No. 1-
ranked team ought to give them extra emotional
incentive this weekend.
"It helps our attitude having swept A-State,"
Meier said. "If we had just swept UCLA (the hap
less Bruins are 6-21) it might have been dif
ferent."
The Cards hope matters will be different from
the last time they played Cal. The Bears took two
of three games from Stanford, their victories
coming on 11-10 and 12-* 1 scores.
"We didn't play well," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess recalled. "We walked a lot of peo
ple and gave them a lot of things."
Now, however, Marquess feels optimistic.
"We're playing as well as we've played all year,"
he said. Indeed, this year's club is probably the
most offensively potent one in Card history, hav
ing broken school single-season records for bat
ting average, runs scored, hits, doubles and home
runs.
Notes — Today's starting pitchers will be Brian
Myers (4-3) tor Stanford and Dave Granger (4-4)
tor Cal. Tomorrow, Stanford's Paul Grame (8-4)
opposes Chuck Cary (4-6), Cal's alternative to
Card Steve Cottrell (6-2) Sunday has not yet been
determined.
What usually takes place in huge metropolitan
stadiums will be occurring in rustic collegiate
ballparks. Action will unfold not in front of
thQupands of screaming tans, but before only a
tew hundred devotees
Nevertheless, all the other characteristics ot a
baseball pennant race will be present in this week
end's three-game series between Stanford and
California, beginning today at Berkeley's Evans
Field at 2:30 p.m. Rival teams are battling The
regular season is ending. And the chance for post
season play is at stake.
For the first time since *971, the Cardinals are
finishing the season'in truly climactic fashion —
contending for a playoft spot.
"This is the first time in my three years here
that I've ever been close., (to making the
playoffs)," shortstop Dave Meier said. "Usually
at this juncture we're 12-' 5."
The Southern Division's second-place team will
advance to the conference playoffs against the
Northern Division's first-place team, which will
likely be Washington State, though Oregon State
and Washington are only '.Va and 2 games behind,
respectively.
Stanford, 36-19 overall, owns a 14- : 3 record in
the Pacitic- : 0 Conference's Southern Division and
a second-place tie with Arizona. Both teams are
one game ahead of USC (13-14).
Even Cal (30-29-*, 11-16) is mathematically
alive. However, the Bears' hopes rest on an un
likely combination ot events: a sweep of Stanford,
an Arizona State sweep of Arizona and UCLA tak
ing at least two ot three trom USC.
