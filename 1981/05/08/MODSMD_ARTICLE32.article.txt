# Card laxmen split pair of games
## 
### Gray Maxwell 
The men's lacrosse team
split a pair of games this
week, losing narrowly to the
San Francisco Club 9-6, and
trouncing Santa Clara, 12-2.
The Cards are now *0-4 with
two games left to play.
Stanford, one of the top
college teams on the coast,
battled San Francisco, one of
the top club teams, Saturday
at DeGuerre Field. Smart
sticks prevailed over strong
legs as the Cardinals were

unable to establish a running
game and gain any sort of
edge.
San Francisco's defense
was impenetrable, shutting
out the Cardinals for the first
sixteen minutes of the game.
Frosh middie Tim Romer
scored the first Stanford goal
early in the second period to
tie the score at 1-1, but San
Francisco scored a minute
later, and led throughout the
rest of the game.
The Cards bounced back

Wednesday to crush Santa
Clara, 12-2. Frosh attack
Kelly Bulkley and middie
Mont Lunde each registered
hat tricks, and Steve Socolof
added a pair of goals. Taylor
registered five assists.
Though starting goalie
"Thai" Hongladarum has
been lost for the season be
cause of a neck injury and al
ternate goalie Denny Childs
was forced to miss the SC
game because of a field trip,
Stanford was able to limit the

Santa Clara attack to five
shots.
Stand-in goalies Chuck
Renner and Kelly Williams
shut out Santa Clara for near
ly three quarters, and only
allowed two goals. The Card
defense of Guy Nohra, Rich
Kyleberg, and Brian Arthur
played almost flawlessly.
The Cards will host a phys
ical UC-Davis squad tomor
row at DeGuerre Field. The
game is scheduled to begin at
11 a.m.
