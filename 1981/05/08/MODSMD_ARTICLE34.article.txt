## On culinary safari: voyages among the food museums 
### Vince Waldman 
There's a museum on In
' terstate 44 in Tulsa wj)ere the
[ visitor can see artifacts from
over 100 countries, all without
i straying off the road fcrom New
York to Los Angeles. Six Flags
tover Texas stems from the
! same idea: you can go to
'France, Mexico, or Spain, just
by driving down the Dallas-Fort
Worth Turnpike.
j Tulsa's "World Museum" and
Six Flags symbolize and com
bine two contradictory Ameri
can desires: Americans love to
Ihink they're adventuresome
but they don't want to take any
real risks. Even if he could af
ford to go to Africa, the average
American would probably rath
er see exotic animals from the
car at Lion Country Safari.
Americans seem to feel the
same way about food. We love
foreign cuisine. — indeed it's
arguable whether there is an
American cuisine independent
ol foreign influences — but we
anesthetize it for mass con
sumption. You never see
menudn at Taco Bueno or
thousand-year-eggs at the Chi
nese carry-out. You can find
these foods, of course, but most
people won't look: they're un
willing to take the risks, or it's
too much effort.
Thus the phenomenon of the
multiple-cuisine fast-food res
taurant. Palo Alto has three
such establishments, culinary
pinball machines where you can
bounce from Chinese to Italian
to French without even having
to get in your car. These three
establishments have certain
basic similarities: all are large
common eating areas which
provide space to a variety of
fast-food operations. We might
call them food museums, since
they enshrine comestible diver
sity as if the various cuisines
were objects to be stared at
(rather than actually lived).
But there are fundamental
and illuminating differences in
the way the local food museums
approach the contradictory ele-
in the American ap
petite: the quest for exploration
and the fear of challenge. These

places tend as a general rule to
be sterile and uninvolving. But
there's at least one place where
the variety of food is mirrored
in a more diverse, lively at
mosphere.
At the bottom of the barrel is
The Menu Tree, in the San An
tonio Shopping Center. Just the
basics here: a supermarket-size
common area with a number of
sales counters liriing the walls.
These places have individ
ualized names like "Ye Beet
Bun" and "Barnaby's Fish and
Chips" but all the food seems to
come out of the same kitchen. It
all tastes the same, at any rate.
It isn't much better than the last
tood on El Camino* and it isn't
even cheap: $3 is about the min
imum. even for sandwiches.
The Menu Tree actually does a
pretty good business, which just
goes to show how important lo
cation can be
If you do find yourself at San
Antonio Center, try Busch's
Gourmet Foods instead. For
only 70 cents you can have a bor
rek, a tube ot wondrously flaky
pastry filled with pork and beef.
This delightful German - food
store also sells fresh loaves of
French and rye bread, as well as
a surprising variety of imported
goods. In contrast to the dead
ening fakery of The Menu Tree,
Busch's fairly sparkles with
genuineness.
The concept is quite similar,
but The French Quarter at the
Old Mill is a lot more attractive
than The Menu Tree. It's done
up like a Disneyland version of a
Parisian square — it's clean, of
course, and there are no begging
foreign students. The food is all
"European" in theme, although
this is stretched to include a
"French Quarter-Pounder" tor
the especially unadventurous.
The prices are generally in the
same range as The Menu Tree;
the food is somewhat better.
But it's still essentially unin
teresting. The diner in search of
new experiences will probably
be drawn to the Ukranian coun
ter; the $4.95 combination in
cludes three types ot varenyky
(dumplings), a holupche (cab
bage roll), a kibasa (sausage),

and salad. The sausage and the
salad were served with horse
radish sauces Unfortunately,
the horseradish was diluted and
the sauce was as bland as Good
Seasons. The fillings of the
varenyky all tasted the same —
indeed, the fillings were barely
distinguishable from the dump
lings themselves.
The French Quarter is all
looks and little substance. Few
risks are taken anywhere: the
iood is nominally "foreign"' but
there's almost nothing the
D.A.R wouldn't feel com
fortable serving on Founders'
Day. The dessert counter ("Le
Moulin Rouge") offerings are
better observed than con
sumed; they're beautiful but
taste artificial. I ordered an ap
petizing-looking piece of poppy
seed struedel; it was forthwith
popped into the microwave, so
that it came out hot but soggy
and tasteless.
You'd be better otf venturing
into the mall for dessert: to
Mrs. Field's Cookies (they sell
them by weight, so you pay less
tor smaller cookies — why can't
the Bookstore do this?) or to
Candy-Licious, a terrific store
which sells good chocolates and
more than a dozen flavors of Jel
ly-Bellies.
An exception to the suburban
reticence ot The French Quar
ter is the Greek counter (archly
called "Zorba le Grec"). It
seems out of place: while the
other counters look like
plasticized models of village
food stands, this one looks real.
Paper pennants hang from the
awning and posters announcing
daily specials clutter the walls.
It is no coincidence that the food
is best here: a good falafel sand
wich can be had for $2.50 (half
size. $1.50, makes a good
snack); an eggplant sandwich is
$2; nothing runs over $3.50. A
singular win for substance over
form.
Then there's Liddicoat's. Lo
cated in a coverted grocery
store in downtown Palo Alto.
Liddicoat's is a very different
place from its shopping-center
competition. A long, narrow al

ley separates the noisy, inde
pendent counter operations.
Chairs, stools, and empty trays
are scattered everywhere No
space is wasted, and most
diners have to climb upstairs
where more tables have been
stashed. Food is served on
styrofoam and you're supposed
to bus your own tray
But the highest prices at Lid
dicoat's are around $3 ; and the
food has tar more taste than one
would expect from such a place.
Not gourmet by any means. Lid
dicoat's nevertheless offers the
widest choice to the salivating
explorer: everything trom
Filipino food to Persian, includ
ing a counter that serves both
burritos and talafel, and a pizza
parlor that doubles as a juice
bar. (Zorba the Greek, minus
the frenchification, can be
found here as well as at the Old
Mill.)
Though they're mainly ac
cumulations ot traditional fa
vorites, the menus at Lid
dicoat's do offer some unusual
items. A sometime special at
the Japanese counter is an
avocado-sushi roll, a successful
mixture of Californian and trad
itional Japanese influences. The
sushi is neither plentiful nor ot
the highest quality, but for $1.50
it makes a nice light lunch.
For dessert there's a
cheesecake and candy shop (ov
erpriced. especially compared
with the rest of the estab
lishments); Rick's Ice Cream;
and more Mrs. Field's cookies.
(Does Mrs. F.have a daughter?)
Like the rest of downtown
Palo Alto, Liddicoat's pretty
much shuts down in the evening.
At lunch, however, it's one of
the few places in downtown Palo
Alto where you can sit outside in
the sun, eating a Filipino com
bination plate or a deli sandwich
while the crowds pass by. Of
course, University Avenue isn't
the most diverse place on earth
— or even in Santa Clara County
— but Liddicoat's still has much
more of the spirit"ot adventure
than its staid subtirban competi
tion.

Like the rest of downtown

There's a museum on In

[ visitor can see artifacts from
over 100 countries, all without

'France, Mexico, or Spain, just
by driving down the Dallas-Fort

j Tulsa's "World Museum" and
Six Flags symbolize and com

Ihink they're adventuresome
but they don't want to take any
real risks. Even if he could af
ford to go to Africa, the average
American would probably rath

Americans seem to feel the

foreign cuisine. — indeed it's
arguable whether there is an

nese carry-out. You can find
these foods, of course, but most
people won't look: they're un
willing to take the risks, or it's
too much effort.
Thus the phenomenon of the
multiple-cuisine fast-food res
taurant. Palo Alto has three
such establishments, culinary
pinball machines where you can
bounce from Chinese to Italian
to French without even having
to get in your car. These three
establishments have certain
basic similarities: all are large
common eating areas which
provide space to a variety of
fast-food operations. We might
call them food museums, since
they enshrine comestible diver
sity as if the various cuisines
were objects to be stared at
(rather than actually lived).
But there are fundamental
and illuminating differences in
the way the local food museums
approach the contradictory ele-
in the American ap

and the fear of challenge. These

places tend as a general rule to
be sterile and uninvolving. But
there's at least one place where
the variety of food is mirrored
in a more diverse, lively at
mosphere.
At the bottom of the barrel is
The Menu Tree, in the San An
tonio Shopping Center. Just the
basics here: a supermarket-size
common area with a number of
sales counters liriing the walls.
These places have individ
ualized names like "Ye Beet
Bun" and "Barnaby's Fish and
Chips" but all the food seems to
come out of the same kitchen. It
all tastes the same, at any rate.
It isn't much better than the last
tood on El Camino* and it isn't
even cheap: $3 is about the min
imum. even for sandwiches.
The Menu Tree actually does a

The concept is quite similar,
but The French Quarter at the
Old Mill is a lot more attractive
than The Menu Tree. It's done
up like a Disneyland version of a
Parisian square — it's clean, of

"European" in theme, although
this is stretched to include a

the especially unadventurous.
The prices are generally in the

radish sauces Unfortunately,
the horseradish was diluted and
the sauce was as bland as Good
Seasons. The fillings of the
varenyky all tasted the same —
indeed, the fillings were barely
distinguishable from the dump
lings themselves.
The French Quarter is all
looks and little substance. Few
risks are taken anywhere: the
iood is nominally "foreign"' but
there's almost nothing the
D.A.R wouldn't feel com
fortable serving on Founders'
Day. The dessert counter ("Le
Moulin Rouge") offerings are
better observed than con
sumed; they're beautiful but
taste artificial. I ordered an ap
petizing-looking piece of poppy
seed struedel; it was forthwith
popped into the microwave, so
that it came out hot but soggy
and tasteless.
You'd be better otf venturing
into the mall for dessert: to
Mrs. Field's Cookies (they sell
them by weight, so you pay less
tor smaller cookies — why can't
the Bookstore do this?) or to
Candy-Licious, a terrific store
which sells good chocolates and
more than a dozen flavors of Jel
ly-Bellies.
An exception to the suburban
reticence ot The French Quar
ter is the Greek counter (archly
called "Zorba le Grec"). It
seems out of place: while the
other counters look like
plasticized models of village
food stands, this one looks real.
Paper pennants hang from the
awning and posters announcing
daily specials clutter the walls.
It is no coincidence that the food
is best here: a good falafel sand
wich can be had for $2.50 (half
size. $1.50, makes a good
snack); an eggplant sandwich is
$2; nothing runs over $3.50. A
singular win for substance over
form.
Then there's Liddicoat's. Lo

Liddicoat's is a very different

indeed, the fillings were barely
distinguishable from the dump
lings themselves.
The French Quarter is all
looks and little substance. Few
risks are taken anywhere: the
iood is nominally "foreign"' but
there's almost nothing the
D.A.R wouldn't feel com
fortable serving on Founders'
Day. The dessert counter ("Le
Moulin Rouge") offerings are
better observed than con
sumed; they're beautiful but
taste artificial. I ordered an ap
petizing-looking piece of poppy
seed struedel; it was forthwith
popped into the microwave, so
that it came out hot but soggy
and tasteless.
You'd be better otf venturing
into the mall for dessert: to
Mrs. Field's Cookies (they sell
them by weight, so you pay less
tor smaller cookies — why can't
the Bookstore do this?) or to
Candy-Licious, a terrific store
which sells good chocolates and
more than a dozen flavors of Jel
ly-Bellies.
An exception to the suburban
reticence ot The French Quar
ter is the Greek counter (archly
called "Zorba le Grec"). It
seems out of place: while the
other counters look like
plasticized models of village
food stands, this one looks real.
Paper pennants hang from the
awning and posters announcing
daily specials clutter the walls.
It is no coincidence that the food
is best here: a good falafel sand
wich can be had for $2.50 (half
size. $1.50, makes a good
snack); an eggplant sandwich is
$2; nothing runs over $3.50. A
singular win for substance over
form.
Then there's Liddicoat's. Lo
cated in a coverted grocery
store in downtown Palo Alto.
Liddicoat's is a very different
place from its shopping-center
competition. A long, narrow al

ley separates the noisy, inde
pendent counter operations.
Chairs, stools, and empty trays
are scattered everywhere No
space is wasted, and most
diners have to climb upstairs
where more tables have been
stashed. Food is served on
styrofoam and you're supposed
to bus your own tray
But the highest prices at Lid
dicoat's are around $3 ; and the
food has tar more taste than one
would expect from such a place.
Not gourmet by any means. Lid
dicoat's nevertheless offers the
widest choice to the salivating
explorer: everything trom
Filipino food to Persian, includ
ing a counter that serves both
burritos and talafel, and a pizza
parlor that doubles as a juice
bar. (Zorba the Greek, minus
the frenchification, can be
found here as well as at the Old
Mill.)
Though they're mainly ac
cumulations ot traditional fa
vorites, the menus at Lid
dicoat's do offer some unusual
items. A sometime special at
the Japanese counter is an
avocado-sushi roll, a successful
mixture of Californian and trad
itional Japanese influences. The
sushi is neither plentiful nor ot
the highest quality, but for $1.50
it makes a nice light lunch.
For dessert there's a
cheesecake and candy shop (ov
erpriced. especially compared
with the rest of the estab
lishments); Rick's Ice Cream;
and more Mrs. Field's cookies.
(Does Mrs. F.have a daughter?)
Like the rest of downtown
Palo Alto, Liddicoat's pretty
much shuts down in the evening.
At lunch, however, it's one of
the few places in downtown Palo
Alto where you can sit outside in
the sun, eating a Filipino com
bination plate or a deli sandwich
while the crowds pass by. Of
course, University Avenue isn't
the most diverse place on earth
— or even in Santa Clara County
— but Liddicoat's still has much
more of the spirit"ot adventure
than its staid subtirban competi
tion.
