# An ordinary oceanfront dinner

If an adventurous peek down a
forgotten alley to tind Epicurus
in a mouthful of clams isn't your
idea of dining out, then The
Chart House is your kind of
place. There is nothing particu
larly subtle about The Chart
-House. It is a standard fare,
standard priced restaurant good
tor the post-beach appetite.
A few miles north of Halt
Moon Bay, The Chart House ov
erlooks the beach at Montara.
The dining area's copper-tinted
glass root slopes towards the
water. The evening light fills
the restaurant with a warm
glow and a sense of intimacy
with the rolling surf.
For a restaurant perched
above the Pacific, and one with
so seaworthy a name, The Chart
House is remarkably unfishy.
(This can be good or bad depend
ing on your feelings about fish.)
Part of a chain, the restaurant
offers a straightforward steak
and seafood menu with 15 en
trees ranging from Hawaiian
chicken ($7.95) to lobster
($16.95), as well as a lavish
salad bar (all you can eat for
$6.95).
Cocktails are available while
you contemplate the menu, and
fresh bread is placed steaming
on your table. We started with

an excellent, thick New Eng
land clam chowder. For our
main course, we chose fresh red
snapper baked with bread
crumbs (the special ot the day,
$8.95), and Alaskan king crab
($13.95).
The snapper, as it often is,
was bland and unimaginatively
prepared. It would have bene
fited from more than just tartar
sauce and one lemon. The crab
Was good, but neither local nor
washed. Salad and potato are in
cluded, but a tew vegetables
would have enhanced the meal.
Although we did not sample
the beef, diners around us said it
was to their taste. Most species,
from New York cut to prime rib,
are available. Sauteed
mushrooms (well-cooked, firm
and not greasy) and steamed
artichokes are possible addi
tions to the meal, as appetizers
or side orders.
The wine list is good for a
chain restaurant. It boasts a
passing assortment of "Chateau
Napa Valley" wines and a smat
tering of imports. For a place as
harried as The Chart House on a
weekend evening, the service
("Hi, I'm Dee, I'll be your
waitress this evening. Please
as"k me for anything you need.")
is exceptionally even-paced.
Turning over tables as rapidly
as possible doesn't seem to be a

great concern of the man
agement.
There are two especially en
•joyable aspects of a Chart
House meal. One is the towering
mud pie — six vertical inches of
coffee ice cream topped with
fudge and whipped cream. It is
the only dessert offered, and one
is plenty tor two people. The
second memorable aspect is the
salad bar, highlighted by the
blue cheese dressing (home
made as are all the dressings.)
The Chart House does not
take reservations, and you can
expect an hour and a half wait
on the weekends if you arrive
much after 7:30. However, a
cozy cocktail lounge overlooks
the beach and it is softened after
dark with the flickering light
from a gas fire.
A similar light embraces the
innumerable couples in the din
ing room. When the happy birth
day song rang out for the third
time we became a little sus
picious, and by the time the
waiters and waitresses sang it
for the fifth twosome we were
convinced: The Chart House is a
relaxed restaurant where you
go to celebrate a special occa
sion or to have a simple meal af
ter a day on the beach.
The Chart House is located at
8150 Cabrillo Highway in Mon
tara; phone 728-7366.


Liddicoat's offers the widest choice to the salivating explorer.
