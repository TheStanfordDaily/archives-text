I he Magic Flute ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman, in a sum
mertime mood, directed this
brilliant film version of the Mozart
opera. His Manic Flute is un
abashedly stagey — we see the
curtain go up at the beginning and
down at the end, and the action
takes place amid cardboard
scenery — but this movie conveys
all of the fantasy the title suggests.
This film could be used as a model
for intelligently transferring stage
works to the screen.
Mozart seems to have been in a
summertime mood, too, and I'd
hazard a guess that some of the
film's success is his doing. His mu
sic is sung in Swedish, with sub
titles added for those who don't
speak it.

This movie puts its tasteful, icy

the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — the' re

in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul

Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the lite
right out of this picture. Redford is

Palo Alto Square
In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and old together.
As new casinos go up on the
Boardwalk, the older buildings —
remnants of a past grandeur and a
more recent decay — tumble to the
ground. In the vision of director
Louis Malle and scriptwriter John
Guare, the environmental trans
formation reflects the disorienting
change which has seized the lives
of the people of the city. The peo
ple of Atlantic City try with vary
ing success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for at least
some people to adjust to new con
ditions. to make a new life out of
the contusion around them. Like
wise. the film itself emerges from
a mass of discordant elements to
form a new. vital tapestry of lives.

directed, has proved that Einstein
was right — time slows down on
the surface of a swiftly falling ob

lies not on the screen but in
Cimino's head: Why was this mov

I he Magic Flute ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman, in a sum
mertime mood, directed this
brilliant film version of the Mozart
opera. His Manic Flute is un
abashedly stagey — we see the
curtain go up at the beginning and
down at the end, and the action
takes place amid cardboard
scenery — but this movie conveys
all of the fantasy the title suggests.
This film could be used as a model
for intelligently transferring stage
works to the screen.
Mozart seems to have been in a
summertime mood, too, and I'd
hazard a guess that some of the
film's success is his doing. His mu
sic is sung in Swedish, with sub
titles added for those who don't
speak it.

Atlantic (ity
Palo Alto Square
In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and old together.
As new casinos go up on the
Boardwalk, the older buildings —
remnants of a past grandeur and a
more recent decay — tumble to the
ground. In the vision of director
Louis Malle and scriptwriter John
Guare, the environmental trans
formation reflects the disorienting
change which has seized the lives
of the people of the city. The peo
ple of Atlantic City try with vary
ing success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for at least
some people to adjust to new con
ditions. to make a new life out of
the contusion around them. Like
wise. the film itself emerges from
a mass of discordant elements to
form a new. vital tapestry of lives.
Features tine performances by
