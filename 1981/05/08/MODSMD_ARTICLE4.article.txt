Phnom Penh, Cambodia (AP)

ening its military influence and
technical presence in Cam
bodia.
Some Western analysts and
unofficial Cambodian sources
say the Soviet moves are irritat
ing their Vietnamese allies, who
also are here in large numbers.

Xeivs analysis

A year ago. only a handful of
Soviet diplomats were seen in
Phnom Penh, the capital. To
day, there are an estimated 200
to 300 advisers. They occupy a
large apartment complex and
several villas are being renovat
ed to house more.
According to one Soviet of
f : cial here, the Soviet Union has
embarked on an ambitious pro
gram to rebuild Cambodia from
the ravages of war and starva
tion that followed the com
munist takeover in '975 at the
end ot the Indochina War.
"Today we are beginning to
think about the long term when
emergency aid is over and the
international agencies leave."
said Soviet Embassy spokes
man Vladimir Golovkine, refer
ring to a mostly-Western food
relief effort that began two
years ago. "We are now prepar
ing the base. It is the begin
ning."
James Grant ot UNICEF, the
chief United Nations aid agency
here, said recently it would take
billions of dollars to renovate
Cambodia's crippled infrastruc
ture.
Between 1970 and 1979, Cam
bodia was devastated by war
and the regime of Premier Pol
Pot, who was ousted after an in
vasion in late 1978 by the Viet
namese. whose forces stiff re
main.
The Soviet Union already
wields considerable influence in
Laos, with Vietnam the other
communist nation in Indochina.
Moscow is the prime prop of
Vietnam's badly ailing economy
and chief supplier for its mili
tary, which includes an esti
mated 200,000 military per
sonnel in Cambodia.
The Soviet Embassy recently
issued an information bulletin
detailing plans to rebuild fac
tories, power plants, hospitals,
grain silos, roads, bridges, and
colleges and vocational schools.
The Soviet Union said it poured
about $250 million in emergency
aid into Cambodia in the last
two years.
But while the Soviets appear
eager to publicize their econom
ic assistance, little information
is released on military aid.
Western diplomatic sources
in Bangkok, Thailand, say the
Soviets have shipped arms in
through the port ot Kompong
Som and by air via Vietnam to
Siem Reap in the northwest.
The Vietnamese and the Cam
bodian regime's armies are con
centrated in the northwest,
where remnants of the Chinese
backed Pol Pot regime are still
fighting.
