Sands buried; priest calls for peace
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The Catholics of Belfast
buried Bobby Sands in a graveyard of Irish nationalist he
roes yesterday, to a bagpipe's lament and a parish priest's
plea for "love . . . peace ... an end of violence."
But new violence flared in this bloodstained land even as
Sands, who starved himself to death to become the latest
IRA martyr, was taken to his resting place, escorted by
masked Irish Republican Army guerrillas and attended by
20,000 mourners.
The 27-year-old Sands' death Tuesday, the 66th day of his
hunger strike at Belfast's Maze prison, brought a new peak
of tension to the 11-year-old sectarian conflict here. The
latest round of "troubles'' threatens to worsen — three
other IRA men imprisoned at Maze are hunger-striking to
the death, like Sands to demand that jailed guerrillas be
treated as political prisoners
The guerrillas of the largely Roman Catholic IRA are
fighting to end British control of this Protestant-domi
nated province and unite it with the Catholic Irish republic
to the south. Almost 2 00 people have been killed since
1969.
Yesterday's new violence was reported in Londonderry.
60 miles to the west, where rioting erupted after a mourn
ing march. At least a dozen automobiles, including one
belonging to a CBS television crew, were hijacked, and
youths stoned security force patrols.
There were no immediate reports on injuries
Syrian troops enter southern Lebanon
Beirut — *About 4000 Syrian troops and tanks were re
ported to have crossed the Israeli-set "red line" in south
ern Lebanon yesterday in defiance of the Jewish state's re
peated warnings that Syria risked war if it violated the
boundary.
The action, if confirmed, would present Reagan admin
istration with a major escalation of the Mideast crisis.
Lebanese government sources said the Syrians deployed
in Sehmor and Yehmor on the western flank of Lebanon's
eastern Bekaa Valley and in southern Lebanon's Kfar Tib
nit. just eight miles north of Israel's northernmost border
town of Metulla.
The reported advance pushed Syria's forwardmost posi
tion in southern Lebanon 12 miles beyond the 25-mile "red
line" along the Zaharani River that Israel said Syria
agreed to five years ago. Israel has warned Syria it risks
war with the Jewish state if Svrian forces cross the line.

Charges made in DC-10 crash suit
Washington — A lawyers' committee representing rela
tives of most the victims in the DC- 0 crash in Chicago two
years ago said yesterday that some American Airlines in
spectors apparently had advance knowledge that the fatal
aircraft bore a detective crack
But the crack in the underwing engine assembly was not
immediately repaired, the committee said, because air
line supervisors determined the plane could fly for another
year and the cost of repair could be delayed
The lawyers' contentions, contained in federal court pa
pers. marked the first time that such a charge had been
made during all the protracted government and legal in
quiries into the May 25. 1979, crash in which 273 persons
died. Attorneys for the relatives also filed an airline memo
that they said supported their charge.
Mine worker negotiations resume
Washington — Negotiations between the United Mine
Workers and the soft-coal industry resumed yesterday af
ter a three-week break, but there was no indication the
talks Would bring a quick end to the 42-dav-old nationwide
strike.
UMW President Sam Church said just prior to the
bargaining session that the union is not ready to com
promise on its demands and union spokesman Eldon
Callen said a quick settlement is not likely.
B.R. Brown, chief negotiator for the industry's
Bituminous Coal Operators Association, refused to an
swer reporters' questions as he walked into the nego
tiations at a Washington hotel.
Brown had called oft the talks at the last session April
17. saying then that the union was not ready to "bargain
realistically."
Probably the major issue tying up the talks is a pro
vision that would require coal, companies covered under
the contract to pay royalties to UMW pension funds tor
non-union coal they buy.
That provision, in the prior contract, was dropped from
the March 23 proposal turned down by the UMW's 160,000
rank and tile members and Church wants it put back in.
Reagan, Prime Minister Suzuki meet
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, declaring that
"Japan and America will go forward together," began
White House talks yesterday with Japanese Prime Min
ister Zenko Suzuki designed to pave the way for increased

strategic and military cooperation.
"We in America are grateful for the strong measures
that you have taken to penalize the Soviet Union tor its vi
olent aggression in Afghanistan," Reagan declared in his
welcoming remarks, without commenting on public hints
that Japan may relax some of its anti-Soviet sanctions now
that the U.S. partial grain embargo has been lifted.
The initial discussions were described "by officials on
both sides as friendly in tone and very general in sub
stance After a 45-minute talk through interpreters, Suzuki
said he and Reagan were "real buddies" and had laid "an
unshakeable basis for mutual trust," according to a White
House briefer
Polish Cardinal has long-term illness
Warsaw — Poland s spiritual leader, Cardinal Stefan
Wvszynski, is suffering a prolonged illness, giving rise to
deepening concern in the country about his eventual re
covery
Attention to the health of the primate, who turns 80 in
August, is especially keen as a result of the Roman Catho
lic Church's critically important role in keeping the peace
here Wyszynski, who has been primate for 31 years, has
personally served as a key mediator between the workers'
movement and communist authorities during the past nine
months of social upheaval.
Staggered poll-closing bills called for
Washington — On the ground that the West was "disen
franchised" last Nov. 4 by early television projections
before all balloting ended, Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.)
argued yesterday for tour bills designed to close the polls
simultaneously across the nation in national elections.
But Hayakawa and California Secretary of State March
Fong Eu conceded at a Senate Rules Committee hearing
that little could be done to prevent the early media
projections, unless the television networks and wire ser
vices voluntarily abandon the practice.
"The biggest loser Nov. 4 was not any single candidate,
but the American political system," Hayakawa said. "We
have been told that hundreds of thousands of Calitornians
did not vote as a result of early media projections of a pres
idential winner. It is not the numbers that are important
. . . (It) is that voters in the Western states believed that
voting was a useless exercise."
One of Hayakawa's proposals would require all states to
open their polls tor 12 hours ending simultaneously at 9
p.m. EST. Thus, polls could close at 9 p.m., 8 p.m., 7 p.m.
and 6 p.m. from east to west across the 48 contiguous
states. Alaska and Hawaii would be permitted to vote on
the Monday before the general election, so they would not

have to open their polling places before 6 a.m.
U.S charged with oil theft
Mexcico City — The United States is plotting to seize
valuable offshore oil lands in Mexican waters, a member
of the Mexican Senate, quoting "secret documents,"
charged yesterday.
Sen. Fausto Zapata Loredo, a member of the Senate's
powerful Energy Committee, made {he charges in an in
terview with the prestigious Mexico City daily Excelsior.
His were the latest — and most specific — in a series of
recent Mexican complaints about U.S. designs on the Gulf
of Mexico.
Zapata that he had found evidence that the United
States had financed oil explorations in an area given to
Mexico by the 1978 U.S.-Mexico maritime boundaries trea
ty.
The treaty has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate and
action on it has been postponed amid charges by some U.S.
senators that it is a "giveaway" of valuable offshore oil
areas to Mexico.
The Mexican government has simply stated that'it is
awaiting ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate But
the delays in ratification have inspired anti-U.S outbursts
by many Mexican politicians.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here said that the
United States has not been exploring for oil and gas in the
areas affected by the treaty and that, pending ratification,
all the conditions in the treaty remain in effect.
