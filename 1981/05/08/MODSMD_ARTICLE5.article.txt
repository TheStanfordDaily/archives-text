# March for missing 6000
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires, Argentina —
More than 1000 demonstrators,
many ot them weeping and cl
inging to each other for com
fort, marched last week in front
of the Argentine presidential
palace, demanding information
about the 6000 people estimated
to have disappeared at the
hands ot government agents.
Most oi the marchers were
parents and other relatives of
disappeared people, called de
saparecidos here, and members
of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo,
named for the site ot the demon
stration.
The protest began in an at
mosphere of tension and fear be
cause there had been threats
that the government would forc
ibly break up the demonstra
tion.
But it was clear from the
start that Argentine officials
had decided against any con
frontation or repeat of an inci
dent a week ago when live for
eign journalists were arrested
while covering a smaller
march.
It was learned from govern

ment sources that a decision to
break up the demonstration was
overturned in a long meeting
before the march after Foreign
Ministry officials argued that
mass arrests or violence would
seriously harm Argentina's in
ternational image.
The demonstration lasted
about 45 minutes, as the rela
tives walked quietly in a large
circle around the park that
stands in front of the Casa
Rosada, or Pink House, the
presidential palace.
Amnesty International and
other human rights groups esti
mate that at least 6000 people
were kidnapped by government
agents between March 1976 and
early 1979 in a drive to destroy
leftist terrorist groups and oth
er alleged opponents ot the mili
tary regime.
The government, first under
former President Jorge Rafael
Videla and now under President
Roberto Viola, has refused to
provide any news about what
happened to the missing people
or who was responsible tor their
disappearances.
