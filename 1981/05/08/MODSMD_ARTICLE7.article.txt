# American military 'trains' Salvador troops
## 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador. EJ Salvador — The well-fed
coffee planters and bespectacled busi
nessmen lunching at the outdoor restaurant
hardly bothered to look up as a lone, UH-1H
Huey helicopter came throbbing over their
thatch-umbrellaed tables.
It was as if just another tropical insect
were flitting by.
But the Huey in the sky, ignored as it was
by the lunchtime gentry, was an in
escapable sign of the U.S. stamp that is be
ginning to emerge on this dismal and ugly
little Central American war.
Compared to Vietnam and Cambodia,
those last tropical wars on which the United
States left its imprint, the U.S. involvement
in El Salvador is still small potatoes: some
$35 million in military aid, 10 Hueys,
thousands of M-'6 assault rifles and M-79
grenade launchers, tons of ammunition, ra
dios, trucks and 54 U.S. military trainers to
show El Salvador's 18.000-man armed
forces what to do with them.
Limited as the commitment here still is.
it cannot escape some comparisons in
American public opinion with those past
wars — even if the comparisons grate on an
administration determined to purge the
public conscience of past disasters.
Commitment growing
Like it or not, the U.S. imprint on this
struggle between leftist guerrillas, many ot
them Communists, and the civilian-military
junta that rules the cities, is growing by the
day.
At the general staff headquarters, local
noncoms are busily building large-scale,
plaster-of-paris mockups of the
rugged volcanic terrain so the 10-man U.S.
team helping to raise the general staff's
planning and operations consciousness can
use their standaid-issue telescopic pointers

to demonstrate the tine points of anti
guerilla tactics. '
These signs of U.S. influence are cropping
up in spite of all efforts to keep the U.S. mili
tary profile in El Salvador studiously low, if
not underground. Everything that could be
done to sanitize the U.S. presence has been
done.
U.S. trainers
Members ot the U.S. military teams here
insist on being called trainers to differen
tiate their rigidly prescribed tunctions ot
martial pedagogy from that ot the Vietnam
advisers who were allowed, indeed under
orders, to accompany their charges on com
bat operations.
The '5 U.S. Special Forces officers from
the U.S. Army School of the Americas in
Panama are not supposed to be called Green
Berets because — as one U.S. official here
insists — they were under orders not to
bring their traditional berets in their duf
fles.
For reasons of security, as well as to
avoid unwanted publicity, all U.S. officers
have been kept on a very tight leash, strictly
confined to the bases where they teach or
work except in special cases where limited
R-and-R has been allowed on well-protected
Pacific beaches or at one ot the capital's
most secure luxury hotels.
Officers grounded
That has meant that the '4 officers
teaching Salvadoran pilots and mechanics
the ways of the Hueys are pretty much
grounded at the military airfield at ll
opango. The five-man naval group trying to
make shipshape the nation's fleet of tour
leaky patrol boats is based at naval head
quarters at La Union on the Gulf of Fonseca.
And the 15-man Special Forces contingent
training a new '000-man heliborne im

mediate-reaction force are hunkered down
ar a new base being built around a former
terchers' college about 29 miles west ot the
capital.
The 20 officers assigned to San Salvador
— 10 in the U.S. Embassy's military group
handling liaison and logistics, the others at
the general staff headquarters — live in
well-guarded villas and a luxury hotel annex
sheltered behind high walls from which they
only emerge in armored bullet-proof
Cherokee vans.
The U.S. Special Forces contingent is
divided into three five-man teams, each of
which takes on a Salvadoran infantry com
pany, normally about T 5O men, for a two
week basic course in small-unit infantry
tactics.
More training, more aid
Being military men, the two officers nat
urally enough said that El Salvador's forces
could use more training than has now been
arranged and more military aid.
The Hueys. some of which Salvadoran pi
lots trained at Ilopango are already flying in
medical evacuation and supply missions in
the field, will improve the Salvadoran
forces' mobility — something that leaders
of the guerrilla movement abroad admit
they worry about. But the improvement will
be marginal at best.
The two U.S. Special Forces officers, like
their fellow officers here, are on strictly
limited six-month tours of duty that will ex
pire this summer. Will others come to re
place them?
The administration and Congress will
have to determine that. But whether or not
more advisers come and more aid is
granted, the growing "Made in USA" char
acter of the Salvadoran armed forces seems
bound to endure tor a long time to come.

escapable sign of the U.S. stamp that is be
ginning to emerge on this dismal and ugly
little Central American war.
Compared to Vietnam and Cambodia,
those last tropical wars on which the United
States left its imprint, the U.S. involvement
in El Salvador is still small potatoes: some
$35 million in military aid, 10 Hueys,
thousands of M-'6 assault rifles and M-79
grenade launchers, tons of ammunition, ra
dios, trucks and 54 U.S. military trainers to
show El Salvador's 18.000-man armed
forces what to do with them.
Limited as the commitment here still is.
it cannot escape some comparisons in
American public opinion with those past
wars — even if the comparisons grate on an
administration determined to purge the
public conscience of past disasters.
Commitment growing
Like it or not, the U.S. imprint on this
struggle between leftist guerrillas, many ot
them Communists, and the civilian-military
junta that rules the cities, is growing by the
day.
At the general staff headquarters, local
noncoms are busily building large-scale,
plaster-of-paris mockups of the
rugged volcanic terrain so the 10-man U.S.
team helping to raise the general staff's
planning and operations consciousness can
use their standaid-issue telescopic pointers

to demonstrate the tine points of anti
guerilla tactics. '
These signs of U.S. influence are cropping
up in spite of all efforts to keep the U.S. mili
tary profile in El Salvador studiously low, if
not underground. Everything that could be
done to sanitize the U.S. presence has been
done.
U.S. trainers
Members ot the U.S. military teams here
insist on being called trainers to differen
tiate their rigidly prescribed tunctions ot
martial pedagogy from that ot the Vietnam
advisers who were allowed, indeed under
orders, to accompany their charges on com
bat operations.
The '5 U.S. Special Forces officers from
the U.S. Army School of the Americas in
Panama are not supposed to be called Green
Berets because — as one U.S. official here
insists — they were under orders not to
bring their traditional berets in their duf
fles.
For reasons of security, as well as to
avoid unwanted publicity, all U.S. officers
have been kept on a very tight leash, strictly
confined to the bases where they teach or
work except in special cases where limited
R-and-R has been allowed on well-protected
Pacific beaches or at one ot the capital's
most secure luxury hotels.
Officers grounded
That has meant that the '4 officers
teaching Salvadoran pilots and mechanics
the ways of the Hueys are pretty much
grounded at the military airfield at ll
opango. The five-man naval group trying to
make shipshape the nation's fleet of tour
leaky patrol boats is based at naval head
quarters at La Union on the Gulf of Fonseca.
And the 15-man Special Forces contingent
training a new '000-man heliborne im

mediate-reaction force are hunkered down
ar a new base being built around a former
terchers' college about 29 miles west ot the
capital.
The 20 officers assigned to San Salvador
— 10 in the U.S. Embassy's military group
handling liaison and logistics, the others at
the general staff headquarters — live in
well-guarded villas and a luxury hotel annex
sheltered behind high walls from which they
only emerge in armored bullet-proof
Cherokee vans.
The U.S. Special Forces contingent is
divided into three five-man teams, each of
which takes on a Salvadoran infantry com
pany, normally about T 5O men, for a two
week basic course in small-unit infantry
tactics.
More training, more aid
Being military men, the two officers nat
urally enough said that El Salvador's forces
could use more training than has now been
arranged and more military aid.
The Hueys. some of which Salvadoran pi
lots trained at Ilopango are already flying in
medical evacuation and supply missions in
the field, will improve the Salvadoran
forces' mobility — something that leaders
of the guerrilla movement abroad admit
they worry about. But the improvement will
be marginal at best.
The two U.S. Special Forces officers, like
their fellow officers here, are on strictly
limited six-month tours of duty that will ex
pire this summer. Will others come to re
place them?
The administration and Congress will
have to determine that. But whether or not
more advisers come and more aid is
granted, the growing "Made in USA" char
acter of the Salvadoran armed forces seems
bound to endure tor a long time to come.

San Salvador. EJ Salvador — The well-fed
coffee planters and bespectacled busi
nessmen lunching at the outdoor restaurant
hardly bothered to look up as a lone, UH-1H
Huey helicopter came throbbing over their
thatch-umbrellaed tables.
It was as if just another tropical insect
were flitting by.
