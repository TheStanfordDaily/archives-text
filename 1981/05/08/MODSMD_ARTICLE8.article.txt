# U.N. seeks assistance for drought, famine in China
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Hit by both a pro
longed drought and extensive
flooding in different parts of the
country, China is asking for in
ternational assistance to feed
and clothe 20 million of it§ peo
ple, but the request is proving to
be one of the most controversial
decisions the post-Mao leader
ship has made in foreign affairs.
The $700 million request for
grain, milk powder, food supple
ments and clothing is causing
chagrin among Chinese at all
levels as an abandonment of the
late Chairman Mao Zedong's
policy of national self-reliance,
according to a number of well
placed Chinese, who warn
it could become a major politi
cal issue.
"Normalizing relations with
the United States or going to
war with Vietnam two years ago
did not upset as many people as
this decision," one Chinese of
ficial said, adding that he sup
ports the request but under
stands the discontent it has
caused.
Opposition
"Those decisions had their
critics, but the opposition to this
goes much deeper," the official
went on. "For 30 years, we took
pride in standing on our own
feet, braving all sorts of dif
ficulties and calamities but nev
er asking for help. We probably
overdid it, but most people felt,
and still feel, that self-reliance
was important, particularly for
our national dignity. Now they
are asking why we have gone
begging for help from the capi
talists."
China is not, in fact, begging
lor food. For nearly eight
months, it has been feeding the
peasants in the drought- and
tlood-stricken regions with its
own grain reserves and could, if

necessary, afford to import the
1.6 million tons of rice, wheat,
corn and soybeans that con
stitute the bulk of the aid re
quest. China has actually con
tinued to export rice and milk
powder, two of the requested
commodities.
UN relief
What the U.N. Disaster Re
lief Office wanted to do in draw
ing up and circulating the aid re
quest was to raise about 20 mil
lion of the most seriously af
fected peasants — a population
nearly that of Canada — above
the subsistence level of govern
ment rations and to speed re
covery with new wells in
drought-hit Hebei province and
with reinforced dikes along the
Yangtze River in Hubei prov
ince.
So far, China has received
about $20 million in assistance,
mostly milk powder, vegetable
oil and vitamin tablets, and Bei
jing's expectations are modest,
though more than 25 countries
have said they would try to help.
The controversy over the aid
request, the first international
appeal China has made since the
Communists came to power in
'949, centers on the policy of
self-reliance: No one says it
should be scrapped, but the de
bate is growing on what it
means and how it should be ef
fected.
Self-reliance
Until recently, self-reliance
was a major facet ot China's
foreign and economic policies.
Emphasis on it grew out of the
vivid memory of foreign ex
ploitation in the past and the
Communists' determination to
restore the nation's dignity and
to prove the superiority of so
cialism by basing all develop
ment on the country's ability to
deal with all problems.
Nearly 20 million people died
in the famine ot 1960-62 — the
toll was reported only last
month — but China did not ask
for international assistance.
When 242,000 were killed in a
1976 earthquake that destroyed
the city of Tangshan, northeast
of Beijing China turned away of
fers ot help.
Researchers at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences
concluded in a study tor the top
leadership that this attitude was
"shortsighted."
Allow UN to ask for assistance
Accepting this assessment,
the Chinese leadership under
Deng Xiaoping, the Communist
Party's powerful vice chair
man. decided to ask — actually,
to allow the United Nations to
ask on China's behalf — for as
sistance tor the peasants in
Hebei and Hubei, the two prov
inces most affected by the

drought and flood.
"Deng argued that absolute
self-reliance was another of
Mao's major mistakes,'' a Chi
nese source tamiliar with the in
ternal debate said. "It was
foolish, misplaced pride. Mao
could not distinguish the old im
perialist domination, which he
wanted to end. from modern in
ternational relations where
mutual assistance is common.
Besides, how can natural dis
asters and the problems they
bring reflect on socialism or the
Chinese Communist Party?"
This argument carried the
majority ot the leadership, the
source said, and it decided "as a
matter of principle, you might
say" — to ask for international
assistance.
Foreign aid relationship
The Chinese press has not
dealt directly with the sensitive
question of foreign relief as
sistance but included it in a pro
longed debate over what sort of
relationship China should de
velop with foreign countries — a
major issue that has influenced
and sometimes blocked past
modernization efforts. An addi
tional effort is now under way to
play down the aid request and
its implications, usually assert
ing that such assistance is more
or less China's by right.
The question of China's share
of the limited amount of foreign
assistance generally available
to developing countries today is
an issue that donor nations, in
cluding the United States, have
wanted to postpone, knowing
that it will be difficult to satisfy
Beijing's expectations without
cutting aid to other major reci
pients, such as India.
World Bank experts
The World Bank, which sent
25 experts to assess China's aid
needs, concluded that it would
need at least $10 billion over the
next five years from the bank
and its affiliated organizations.
The bank's "beneficiary popu
lation" has grown 45 percent
with China's inclusion, the ex
perts noted. >
Less than three years ago,
China made news by saying it
would seek commercial credits
to expand its foreign trade and.
in a major policy reversal,
would establish a variety of
joint ventures with foreign part
ners, some ot them operating
under conditions that China had
earlier characterized as "ex
ploitation" in other countries.
A meager response to the re
quest for aid to China, especial
ly it major countries such as the
United States do not contribute
substantially, would be a worse
humiliation for China, as Chi
nese officials and foreign
diplomats alike assess that
eventuality.

Beijing — Hit by both a pro
longed drought and extensive
flooding in different parts of the
country, China is asking for in
ternational assistance to feed
and clothe 20 million of it§ peo
ple, but the request is proving to
be one of the most controversial
decisions the post-Mao leader
ship has made in foreign affairs.
The $700 million request for
grain, milk powder, food supple
ments and clothing is causing
chagrin among Chinese at all
levels as an abandonment of the
late Chairman Mao Zedong's
policy of national self-reliance,
according to a number of well
placed Chinese, who warn
it could become a major politi
cal issue.
"Normalizing relations with
the United States or going to
war with Vietnam two years ago
did not upset as many people as
this decision," one Chinese of
ficial said, adding that he sup
ports the request but under
stands the discontent it has
caused.
Opposition
"Those decisions had their
critics, but the opposition to this
goes much deeper," the official
went on. "For 30 years, we took
pride in standing on our own
feet, braving all sorts of dif
ficulties and calamities but nev
er asking for help. We probably
overdid it, but most people felt,
and still feel, that self-reliance
was important, particularly for
our national dignity. Now they
are asking why we have gone
begging for help from the capi
talists."
China is not, in fact, begging
lor food. For nearly eight
months, it has been feeding the
peasants in the drought- and
tlood-stricken regions with its
own grain reserves and could, if

necessary, afford to import the
1.6 million tons of rice, wheat,
corn and soybeans that con
stitute the bulk of the aid re
quest. China has actually con
tinued to export rice and milk
powder, two of the requested
commodities.
UN relief
What the U.N. Disaster Re
lief Office wanted to do in draw
ing up and circulating the aid re
quest was to raise about 20 mil
lion of the most seriously af
fected peasants — a population
nearly that of Canada — above
the subsistence level of govern
ment rations and to speed re
covery with new wells in
drought-hit Hebei province and
with reinforced dikes along the
Yangtze River in Hubei prov
ince.
So far, China has received
about $20 million in assistance,
mostly milk powder, vegetable
oil and vitamin tablets, and Bei
jing's expectations are modest,
though more than 25 countries
have said they would try to help.
The controversy over the aid
request, the first international
appeal China has made since the
Communists came to power in
'949, centers on the policy of
self-reliance: No one says it
should be scrapped, but the de
bate is growing on what it
means and how it should be ef
fected.
Self-reliance
Until recently, self-reliance
was a major facet ot China's
foreign and economic policies.
Emphasis on it grew out of the
vivid memory of foreign ex
ploitation in the past and the
Communists' determination to
restore the nation's dignity and
to prove the superiority of so
cialism by basing all develop
ment on the country's ability to
deal with all problems.
Nearly 20 million people died
in the famine ot 1960-62 — the
toll was reported only last
month — but China did not ask
for international assistance.
When 242,000 were killed in a
1976 earthquake that destroyed
the city of Tangshan, northeast
of Beijing China turned away of
fers ot help.
Researchers at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences
concluded in a study tor the top
leadership that this attitude was
"shortsighted."
Allow UN to ask for assistance
Accepting this assessment,
the Chinese leadership under
Deng Xiaoping, the Communist
Party's powerful vice chair
man. decided to ask — actually,
to allow the United Nations to
ask on China's behalf — for as
sistance tor the peasants in
Hebei and Hubei, the two prov
inces most affected by the

drought and flood.
"Deng argued that absolute
self-reliance was another of
Mao's major mistakes,'' a Chi
nese source tamiliar with the in
ternal debate said. "It was
foolish, misplaced pride. Mao
could not distinguish the old im
perialist domination, which he
wanted to end. from modern in
ternational relations where
mutual assistance is common.
Besides, how can natural dis
asters and the problems they
bring reflect on socialism or the
Chinese Communist Party?"
This argument carried the
majority ot the leadership, the
source said, and it decided "as a
matter of principle, you might
say" — to ask for international
assistance.
Foreign aid relationship
The Chinese press has not
dealt directly with the sensitive
question of foreign relief as
sistance but included it in a pro
longed debate over what sort of
relationship China should de
velop with foreign countries — a
major issue that has influenced
and sometimes blocked past
modernization efforts. An addi
