# Uganda violence up as Tanzania leaves
## 
### 
Nairobi, Kenya — Tanzania
has begun to withdraw its troops
from strife-torn Uganda, a
move bound to increase in
stability in a country that has
endured a decade of bloodletting
and chaos under dictator Idi
Amin and his tour successors.
The scheduled withdrawal of
the 10,000 troops by the end of
June will leave security in the
East African country in the
hands of Uganda's ragtag 5000-
man army. In the two years
since the Tanzanian-led over
throw of Amin, the Ugandan
army has been responsible for
more killings of civilians than
any of the burgeoning guerrilla
groups seeking to overthrow the
government.
The Tanzanian troops have
been providing security in much
of the countryside. Their de
parture is expected to lead to an
increase in antigovernment
guerrilla activity, which has es
calated since PresidentjMilton
Obote won disputed elections
last December.
Nyerere
Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere has experienced noth
ing but trouble from his Ugan
dan venture, which started as
retaliation for an invasion by
Amin's forces. Nyerere recent
ly told reporters that somebody
had to invade Uganda to rid the
country of Amin and "we were
the chosen victims."
Nyerere has smarted at
African criticism of his vio
lation of the Ugandan border
and has said he resented the con
tinuing occupation being equat
ed with the Soviet invasion of

Afghanistan.
The war is estimated to have
cost Tanzania about $500 mil
lion, including about $5 million a
month to keep its troops in
Uganda, and the Obote govern
ment has failed to pay for the
troops' upkeep as promised.
Nyerere apparently decided
that his country, strapped by
massive economic problems,
could no longer afford the ex
pense. He turned down a last
minute plea by Ugandan Vice
President Paulo Muwanga to
keep, a troop presence in the
country.

Anti-Obote violence
Most of the disturbances
around Kampala during the last
two months have been carried
out by two anti-Obote groups.
Attacks lately have been car

tary installations and ambushed
