Tradition dictates that champagne ought to accom
pany any celebration, so it wasn't unusual that Stan
ford's baseball team gathered in Sunken Diamond's
right lield Saturday after clinching a spot in the Pacif
ic- 0 Conference playoffs to drink and squirt the bubbly
stuff What a r/s unusual, though, was that head coach
Mark Marquess, an alleged teetotaler who generally
resembles the Man From Glad in baseball clothes, in
dulged in the revelry and emerged from it with a cold
duck-splattered jersey.
Shoot, I don't drink, but I'll have some anyway,"
Marquess said when a bottle was thrusted at him
Indeed, the Cardinals' performance this past week
end was nothing short of intoxicating. In their 12-8
triumph Friday at Berkeley's Evans Diamond and
their 8-7 clincher Saturday, the Cards proved to be
more overwhelming and overpowering than 151-proof
rum. The Bears won yesterday's anticlimactic regular
season finale, 12-6.
Stanford, which finished '6-14 in the Pac-10's South
ern Division (37-20 overall) behind only Arizona State
' 26-4). needed the two victories to dispel the challenges
of Arizona (14-16) and USC (15-15).
Arizona ruined its chances for second place by losing
three games to ASU. But the Trojans, who trailed Stan
tord by one game before the weekend and would have
gone to the playotfs ahead of Stanford had the teams
finished in a tie, took two out of three from UCLA, forc
ing Stanford to at least do likewise against Cal.
Thus, the Cards will face the still-undetermined

Northern Division champion in a best-of-three series
later this week.
Any of three teams — Washington. Washington State
or Oregon State — could still win the North Today
Washington visits last-place Oregon to play a make-up
doubleheader If the Huskies sweep they capture the
title Should the Huskies lose both. WSU takes the
crown. If the Huskies split, a three-way tie for first
place will exist, forcing a coin tlip and a three-way
playoff.
The North-South series, then, will begin Wednesday
at the earliest and next weekend at the latest. Should
the Cards win the series, they would continue to either
the Mideast or East Regionals ot the NCAA tour
nament. Yet simply competing in the post-season is
novel enough for the Cards, who haven't participated in
a league playoff since 971
"It's a new experience, that's for damned sure.'"
first baseman Loring Davies said. "It's going to be
tough on the schoolwork. but it's more than worth it.'
Third baseman Phil Wilson, a senior, felt satisfied at
regaining the winning habit.
"When you come here, nobody's a loser It's kind of
hard not going to the playotfs," Wilson said

weekend, the Cardinals cNnched a national playoff
spot.

This celebration occurred after Saturday's win over
UC-Berkeley. With their two victories against Cal this
pitches.
112 Bill Worden sacrificed Wilson to second Bob
SbeCosta, the next batter, singled sharply to left
field — too sharply to score Wilson, who had to re
nain at third.
i Dan Deaver replaced Price to face dangerous
dike Dotterer. On an 0-1 pitch, Dotterer lifted a
ly ball to medium-deep center field. Had the ball
raveled any shorter, Wilson probably wouldn't
lave tried to score.
Michael Buggs made the catch and threw to the
jlate on one hop, but WUson, doing his best to irri
tate Houston McTear, churned home for the de
cisive tally.
,"I was thinking, 'Just get there and get
down,' " Wilson said. "Actually, it (the fly ball)
I as probably too shallow. I just went for it."
Another wise choice was going for reliever
ike Sullivan. The senior side-armer picked up
s fifth victory in six decisions, allowing only one
ip in 3V3 innings.
Replacing starter Paul Grame in the midst of
il's three-unearned-run uprising in the sixth in
ng, Sullivan yielded a home run to Buggs with
ue out in'the seventh that tied the score at 7-7. But
(llivan recovered, retiring eight of the final nine
batters and climaxing his effort with a three-up
l three-down ninth inning.
; ?He was a little inconsistent tor us early in the
season, but lately he's been really effective,"
'Marquess said of Sullivan. "He's picked us up
; when we've needed it."
Big innings
' The Card bats did the picking up Friday. Having
amassed only tour hits over six innings and trail
ing 3-2, Stanford struck for four runs in the sev
enth and six more in the eighth to stagger the
Bears.
Dotterer dealt the biggest blow in the seventh,
greeting ace reliever Mitch Hawley with a two
run triple to the right-field corner that snapped a
3-3 tie.

The Bears retaliated with five runs in their half
of the seventh, regaining the lead at 8-6.
On most days, a two-run lead plus Hawley on
the mound equals victory for Cal. The fact that
Hawley was making his '00th career appearance
added to his air of invincibility. However Jiis per
formance more closely resembled that of -a '00-
year-old man than a 00-game veteran.
Hawley opened the eighth by walking Darryl
Stephens, hitting pinch-batter Bob Hausladen and
walking Worden to load the bases. DeCosta made
the score 8-7 with his third single, a fly ball to right
field that Cal's Darrel Varrelmann couldn't
reach.
Bill Hawkins replaced Hawley and almost
saved the Bears from their subsequent doom, dis
patching John Elway on a pop-up and Dotterer on
a called third strike.
The next batter, left-handed-hitting Mike
Aldrete, should have been an easy mark for
Hawkins, also a southpaw.
But Aldrete defied both the percentages and the
pressure, slicing one of Hawkins' sliders for a sin
gle to left field that scored Hausladen and Worden
and gave Stanford a 9-8 lead.
"I was looking for a fastball all the way, but I
was ready for the slider," Aldrete said. "And in
the back of my mind, I was kind of looking for the
slider."
Though Aldrete's hit proved to be all Stanford
needed, Toothman followed with an infield single
that drove in DeCosta. Shortstop Dave Meier, who
unofficially finished with a .425 batting average,
smashed a two-run double to left-center field that
ended the scoring.
Freshman reliever Gregg Lomnicky sealed
Stanford's triumph, blanking Cal over the last two
innings and improving his record to 6-1.
In yesterday's game, which had about as much
meaning tor Stanford as a first-grade primer, the
Bears gained a modicum of revenge by lashing 16
hits and doing all their scoring in the first five in
nings.
