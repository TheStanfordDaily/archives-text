Tradition dictates that champagne ought to accom
pany any celebration, so it wasn't unusual that Stan
ford's baseball team gathered in Sunken Diamond's
right lield Saturday after clinching a spot in the Pacif
ic- 0 Conference playoffs to drink and squirt the bubbly
stuff What a r/s unusual, though, was that head coach
Mark Marquess, an alleged teetotaler who generally
resembles the Man From Glad in baseball clothes, in
dulged in the revelry and emerged from it with a cold
duck-splattered jersey.
Shoot, I don't drink, but I'll have some anyway,"
Marquess said when a bottle was thrusted at him
Indeed, the Cardinals' performance this past week
end was nothing short of intoxicating. In their 12-8
triumph Friday at Berkeley's Evans Diamond and
their 8-7 clincher Saturday, the Cards proved to be
more overwhelming and overpowering than 151-proof
rum. The Bears won yesterday's anticlimactic regular
season finale, 12-6.
Stanford, which finished '6-14 in the Pac-10's South
ern Division (37-20 overall) behind only Arizona State
' 26-4). needed the two victories to dispel the challenges
of Arizona (14-16) and USC (15-15).
Arizona ruined its chances for second place by losing
three games to ASU. But the Trojans, who trailed Stan
tord by one game before the weekend and would have
gone to the playotfs ahead of Stanford had the teams
finished in a tie, took two out of three from UCLA, forc
ing Stanford to at least do likewise against Cal.
Thus, the Cards will face the still-undetermined

Northern Division champion in a best-of-three series
later this week.
Any of three teams — Washington. Washington State
or Oregon State — could still win the North Today
Washington visits last-place Oregon to play a make-up
doubleheader If the Huskies sweep they capture the
title Should the Huskies lose both. WSU takes the
crown. If the Huskies split, a three-way tie for first
place will exist, forcing a coin tlip and a three-way
playoff.
The North-South series, then, will begin Wednesday
at the earliest and next weekend at the latest. Should
the Cards win the series, they would continue to either
the Mideast or East Regionals ot the NCAA tour
nament. Yet simply competing in the post-season is
novel enough for the Cards, who haven't participated in
a league playoff since 971
"It's a new experience, that's for damned sure.'"
first baseman Loring Davies said. "It's going to be
tough on the schoolwork. but it's more than worth it.'
Third baseman Phil Wilson, a senior, felt satisfied at
regaining the winning habit.
"When you come here, nobody's a loser It's kind of
hard not going to the playotfs," Wilson said
Decisive run
With the game tied 7-7 in Saturday's eighth inning.
Wilson himself scored the run propelling Stanford into
post-season competition
While several Card substitutes attempted to rattle
Cal pitcher Bryan Price by waving white towels and
screaming from the dugout, Wilson walked on four
