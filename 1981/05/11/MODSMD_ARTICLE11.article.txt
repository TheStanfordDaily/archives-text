# Troublemakers congregate at lake
## 
### Diane Johnson 
The annual problem at Lake Lagunita is
in full-swing again - that of non-Stanford
students congregating, partying, leaving
trash, and generally causing disruption on
the beach, according to Garth Everhart. a
senior economics and political science ma
jor and manager ot the boathouse.
Since the lake is Stanford private proper
ty, Everhart and the lifeguards reserve the
right to kick out any trespasser who creates
a public nuisance. Everhart pointed out the
two common troublesome groups: "The
Paly High students and the 24-25 year old
low-lifes in the area. Sometimes they drive
up in as many as twenty four-wheel drives,
park their cars on the hill overlooking the
beach, and party with loud music."
The congregating in general isn't the ma
jor factor contributing to expulsion accord
ing to Everhart. "The main reason they are
asked to leave is that many Stanford stu
dents don't utilize the beach and lake as they

should because they get hassled by these
non-Stanford partiers. Since Stanford stu
dents finance the property, they should have
every right to use the beach and lake
without interference from outsiders." Ev
erhart added that the boathouse receives
more money than any other ASSU project.
Another big problem with the non-Univer
sity beachcombers is that they are destroy
ing the natural surroundings according to
Everhart. "Two weeks ago there was no
trash around and the area was clean and en
joyable. Now the grass and trees have been
damaged and there is garbage ev
erywhere."
The police watch the area very carefully,
warding against fights and other such
abusive actions. Everhart said. "The prob
lem isn't quite as bad as in previous years —
at least I haven't gotten beat up yet this
year! We began right away keeping the
gates locked up and making sure the police
could get here quickly. This has made the

job a bit easier."
"Weekends tend to be the most trouble
some times." according to Kverhart, "as
well as during high school hours when Paly
High students come here to skip classes We
usually have to kick out as many as four-five
people a day."
Everhart said it's not too hard to tell
who's not a Stanford student. "We don't
have to ask for I.D.s. We can tell by the
trucks, lack of books, open stereos, etc. Af
ter working here for four years, we see the
same chronic abusers over and over The
police even know many of them by name."
Although there are joggers at the lake
year-round, the problem only arises come
Spring according to Everhart. "The beach
happens to be an ideal situation and people
just get carried away. It's our job to watch
out for these troublemakers and preserve
the beach for Stanford students as best we
can."
