# Otero reverses sandwich this year

### Cathy Janus 
Rinconada and Otero
treshmen have mixed feelings
about Residential Education's
sister house experiment this
year.
The experiment was to re
verse the traditional order of
the men's and women's floors in
Otero, and to designate Otero
and Rinc as sister houses. For
the first time, Otero has women
on the first and third floors and
men on the second. Rinconada is
the reverse. In both cases the
"minority sex" is "sand
wiched" between the other two,
with men from one house and
women from the other on the
same level, separated by only a
walkway.
The two Wilbur houses were
chosen for what JRinconada resi
dent fellow Stephen Ferruolo
called "a cooperating to enrich
the educational and social ex
perience" of the residents.
The residents of the two
houses are brought together by
joint activities, dorm-based sec
tions of History and Great
Works of Western Culture, and a
shared dining hall.
"I think what these freshmen
have is something special that
they'll never have again," said
Corby Kessler. an Otero RA. He
said he thinks the arrangement
is better. "People aren't afraid
to go to the other dorm." he
said. Kessler said when he lived
in Donner, his dorm and Larkin
were not as comfortable. He
said he and the other RAs were
surprised at the "ease with
which the barriers were broken
down." Kessler said no two
houses have made the attempt
to mix like Rinconada and
Otero. "There is not a separate
dining hall for each residence,
as most dorms have," he said.
"Everyone sits on whatever
side they want. Before, the con
diments table was a barrier that
separated the houses."
One student disagreed, how
ever. "If they (Otero) weren't
our sister dorm, it would be no
different. We are basically sep
arated. As an example, half the
dining room is Rinc, and the oth
er half is Otero.
"Neither house cared enough
to really try and combine in a
way to create a feeling of to
getherness. We could have had a
combined dorm council to en
courage interaction," said one
Rinc resident.
Suzi Weersing, Otero, said,

"We're not as close as I ex
pected. There could be more in
teraction between the girls of
the two dorms. We know the
guys, but not the girls. We've
never gotten together." She said
her Otero floor had several
study breaks with the third floor
Rinc men so they got to know
each other "pretty well."Suzi
said that inside Otero everyone
is really close, but "I'd have
preferred the reverse ratio."
.Joanne van Erp. second year
Rinc RA said, "Many of the
freshmen take this situation for
granted. When they came here
they'd never lived in Stanford
dorms before, so they didn't re
alize that there usually isn't that
much interaction with houses
right next door to each other.
Last year we didn't do anything
at all with Otero. "
Joanne said that from her ob
servatons this year and last
year, the reverse sandwich "is a
much healthier atmosphere.
You have to see what some
thing was like before, to ap
preciate what you've got."
Some students find the situ
ation favorable. 'I like it be
cause I've gotten to know a
bunch of people over there and
I've made more friends that I
think I would have otherwise,"

said Cindi Wheeler. Rinconada
She said the double dorm is the
best situation because "it's
even, which is nice at parties."
Kessler said the RFs and RAs
were "extremely cautious"
about pushing the two together.
They took a "hands-off ap
proach" to avoid making the sit
uation forced. "We encouraged
interaction. We acted like
catalysts" he said. "The
freshmen took it over from us
faster than we expected."
Joint activities began during
orientation with a Rinc-Otero
scavenger hunt and party. More
combined parties followed,
along with joint study breaks —
including one where the Mendi
cants sang (Steve Erikson, Rinc
RA is a Mendicant) — a beach
trip, and they cooperated in pro
ducing fi\r- Svp fiirdie.
Walter Kingson. Otero, said,
"The sister house arrangement
worked out pretty well. When
Rinc had parties we went over
and when we have parties they
come here. " He said he thinks it
should be expanded to other
dorms.
Rinc RA Aleen Zimberoff
said "I think having Western
Culture sections in the lounges
really stimulate an atmosphere
of camraderie and then with the

added social complement I
think it's been a real en
hancement tor both living en
vironments."
One resident said the dorm
play was good but there was
"some tension between Rinc
and Otero people." Another said
"The only thing that connects
Rinc and Otero is the dumpster
in between the floors."
The common complaint is
that the sister house experiment
did not work as well as it might
have because there were not
enough combined activities.
Mark Meyers. Rinconada. com
plained. "When we have wanted
to do things with them this quar
ter they have said no."
Zimberoft. however felt dif
ferently. "I doubt one could find
two adjacent dorms on campus
that mix us much. People
wander in and out of the halls,
study together, and eat togeth
er. I think the atmosphere is un
usually cohesive."
"I love it!" said Kalon
Goodrich. Otero. He said he
"likes having so many girls
around."
A Rinconada girl added,
"Rinconada is more fun be
cause it's got more guys. . . but
then again Otero's got some
nice guys too."

Rinconada and Otero
treshmen have mixed feelings
about Residential Education's
sister house experiment this
year.
The experiment was to re
verse the traditional order of
the men's and women's floors in
Otero, and to designate Otero
and Rinc as sister houses. For
the first time, Otero has women
on the first and third floors and
men on the second. Rinconada is
the reverse. In both cases the
"minority sex" is "sand
wiched" between the other two,
with men from one house and
women from the other on the
same level, separated by only a
walkway.
The two Wilbur houses were
chosen for what JRinconada resi
dent fellow Stephen Ferruolo
called "a cooperating to enrich
the educational and social ex
perience" of the residents.
The residents of the two
houses are brought together by
joint activities, dorm-based sec
tions of History and Great
Works of Western Culture, and a
shared dining hall.
"I think what these freshmen
have is something special that
they'll never have again," said
Corby Kessler. an Otero RA. He
said he thinks the arrangement
is better. "People aren't afraid
to go to the other dorm." he
said. Kessler said when he lived
in Donner, his dorm and Larkin
were not as comfortable. He
said he and the other RAs were
surprised at the "ease with
which the barriers were broken
down." Kessler said no two
houses have made the attempt
to mix like Rinconada and
Otero. "There is not a separate
dining hall for each residence,
as most dorms have," he said.
"Everyone sits on whatever
side they want. Before, the con
diments table was a barrier that
separated the houses."
One student disagreed, how
ever. "If they (Otero) weren't
our sister dorm, it would be no
different. We are basically sep
arated. As an example, half the
dining room is Rinc, and the oth
er half is Otero.
"Neither house cared enough
to really try and combine in a
way to create a feeling of to
getherness. We could have had a
combined dorm council to en
courage interaction," said one
Rinc resident.
Suzi Weersing, Otero, said,

"We're not as close as I ex
pected. There could be more in
teraction between the girls of
the two dorms. We know the
guys, but not the girls. We've
never gotten together." She said
her Otero floor had several
study breaks with the third floor
Rinc men so they got to know
each other "pretty well."Suzi
said that inside Otero everyone
is really close, but "I'd have
preferred the reverse ratio."
.Joanne van Erp. second year
Rinc RA said, "Many of the
freshmen take this situation for
granted. When they came here
they'd never lived in Stanford
dorms before, so they didn't re
alize that there usually isn't that
much interaction with houses
right next door to each other.
Last year we didn't do anything
at all with Otero. "
Joanne said that from her ob
servatons this year and last
year, the reverse sandwich "is a
much healthier atmosphere.
You have to see what some
thing was like before, to ap
preciate what you've got."
Some students find the situ
ation favorable. 'I like it be
cause I've gotten to know a
bunch of people over there and
I've made more friends that I
think I would have otherwise,"

said Cindi Wheeler. Rinconada
She said the double dorm is the
best situation because "it's
even, which is nice at parties."
Kessler said the RFs and RAs
were "extremely cautious"
about pushing the two together.
They took a "hands-off ap
proach" to avoid making the sit
uation forced. "We encouraged
interaction. We acted like
catalysts" he said. "The
freshmen took it over from us
faster than we expected."
Joint activities began during
orientation with a Rinc-Otero
scavenger hunt and party. More
combined parties followed,
along with joint study breaks —
including one where the Mendi
cants sang (Steve Erikson, Rinc
RA is a Mendicant) — a beach
trip, and they cooperated in pro
ducing fi\r- Svp fiirdie.
Walter Kingson. Otero, said,
"The sister house arrangement
worked out pretty well. When
Rinc had parties we went over
and when we have parties they
come here. " He said he thinks it
should be expanded to other
dorms.
Rinc RA Aleen Zimberoff
said "I think having Western
Culture sections in the lounges
really stimulate an atmosphere
of camraderie and then with the

added social complement I
think it's been a real en
hancement tor both living en
vironments."
One resident said the dorm
play was good but there was
"some tension between Rinc
and Otero people." Another said
"The only thing that connects
Rinc and Otero is the dumpster
in between the floors."
The common complaint is
that the sister house experiment
did not work as well as it might
have because there were not
enough combined activities.
Mark Meyers. Rinconada. com
plained. "When we have wanted
to do things with them this quar
ter they have said no."
Zimberoft. however felt dif
ferently. "I doubt one could find
two adjacent dorms on campus
that mix us much. People
wander in and out of the halls,
study together, and eat togeth
er. I think the atmosphere is un
usually cohesive."
"I love it!" said Kalon
Goodrich. Otero. He said he
"likes having so many girls
around."
A Rinconada girl added,
"Rinconada is more fun be
cause it's got more guys. . . but
then again Otero's got some
nice guys too."
