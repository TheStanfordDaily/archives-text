terest of present and future gen
erations. the Stanford Daily re
quested and was granted an in
terview with King Oil himself.
James Megawatt. Following is
a transcript of the conservation.
Daily: Mr Megawatt, what do
you see as the future of Ameri
ca?
Megawatt: I'm definitely for
conservation of all our valuable
land. And all the valuable land
now sprawled across the great
plains, the Appalachian high
lands.and the tundra of Alaska
is now being bled dry. That's
right All that land is being
stripped ot its valuable min
erals. salts, and nutrients by in
satiable. ravenous weeds and
plants. It's a blessed shame. It's
a crime. I have the solution.
First, we rid those defenseless
lands of their green parasites
and then we cover them with a
protective shell ot concrete.
Have you ever noticed how well
cities protect valuable nutrients
in the soil? No God-fearing plant
would try to grow through six in
ches of concrete, no sire.
Daily: Utterly brilliant! I
never knew that destruction and
-construction could preserve our
natural resources so effective
ly. But how do you plan to get rid
ot the greenery?
Megawatt: Just strip mine it
off. Why. the other day, I was
looking at an Escher drawing
and thought how beautiful all
those rolling hills would look if
they were uniformly tiered.
Just think, all of America could
become an abstract art form.
Now there's utility and con
servation of Our Precious

Earthly Nutrients.
Daily: And what about our in
nerspace environment under
the sea?
Megawatt: Have I got an idea
for you' Have you ever noticed
that black oily stuff on tele
phone poles' 1 Well, it's creosol
and it's just like crude oil. Have
you ever stopped to think what
would happen it telephone poles
weren't covered with it 0 Why,
they'd rot. Their lifetime wouid
be a traction of what it is today
Anyway, back to the sea. All
these species they tell me are
becoming extinct — it's because
their lives are too short The
snail darter, the great blue her
on. the whooping crane. Well, if
you consider what oily black
stuff does tor telephone poles,
just think of what it'll do tor the
lives of endangered species It 'll
triple their life expectancy.
With that black protective coat
ing. we'll soon be up to our knees
in today's endangered species!
Daily: And just how do you
plan to accomplish this "coat
ing?"
Megawatt: Easy, take all of
those silly little regulations
about oil drilling safety, cargo
ing and exploring and shred
em! The plan will be known in
every corner of the earth and I'll
be the brain child. Oil is our
friend.
Daily: But what about the
marine plants which need to re
ceive light through the black
coating?
Megawatt: Simple. Once
they're coated, we remove
them. Just think of the advan
tages. No longer will we have all
that undersea clutter keeping
our sewage inflow from flowing
naturally where it should: all
over the world and especially to
the Russians instead of around
our great country. Then, we can
cut up the walls of blackened

kelp and sell them to univer
sities as great works of art. My
plans will bring a future to ail
the world and protect Our Pre
cious Earthly Nutrients. Best ot
all we'll sleep better without all
those brooks babbling through
the night.
Daily: You said "a brighter
future.' Doesn't that imply
more energy consumption?
Megawatt: When I said
brighter future, I meant
brighter. Have you ever ex
perienced the beauty ot a re
finery waste gas torch lighting
up the skyline? I had my honey
moon at the East Detroit Exxon
plant — it was glorious! Well,
imagine the power of putting a
refinery torch on every block, in
every city, in every country.
We'll eliminate the need for
light bulbs all over the country.
I love the odor of waste gas in
the morning. . .it smells like
victory.
Daily: Every lightbulb? What
about those secluded places

where lights won't reach?
Megawatt: Not to worry, I've
got that covered. Have you ever
felt the Mom's apple pie
warmth of a nuclear reactor
core 0 Well. 1 have, and it's given
me abrighteroutlook on life. Let
me hit this light switch.
Daily: That's amazing.
You're at least 100 watts in the
dark. So that's why they call you
James Megawatt.
Megawatt: Yup. Mom gave it
to me back when I lived in Love
Canal. There's no place like
home. Anyway, now you know
why Megawatt's got a brighter
idea and all the answers for to
day's quickly decaying world.
Daily: I'm surprised all the
radiation exposure didn't lead
to radical brain damage.
Megawatt: Well, some of us
have it and some of us don't.
Daily: Thank you Mr. Mega
watt, I am proud to share a
country with you.

sities as great works of art. My
plans will bring a future to ail
the world and protect Our Pre
cious Earthly Nutrients. Best ot
all we'll sleep better without all
those brooks babbling through
the night.
Daily: You said "a brighter
future.' Doesn't that imply
more energy consumption?
Megawatt: When I said
brighter future, I meant
brighter. Have you ever ex
perienced the beauty ot a re
finery waste gas torch lighting
up the skyline? I had my honey
moon at the East Detroit Exxon
plant — it was glorious! Well,
imagine the power of putting a
refinery torch on every block, in
every city, in every country.
We'll eliminate the need for
light bulbs all over the country.
I love the odor of waste gas in
the morning. . .it smells like
victory.
Daily: Every lightbulb? What
about those secluded places

where lights won't reach?
Megawatt: Not to worry, I've
got that covered. Have you ever
felt the Mom's apple pie
warmth of a nuclear reactor
core 0 Well. 1 have, and it's given
me abrighteroutlook on life. Let
me hit this light switch.
Daily: That's amazing.
You're at least 100 watts in the
dark. So that's why they call you
James Megawatt.
Megawatt: Yup. Mom gave it
to me back when I lived in Love
Canal. There's no place like
home. Anyway, now you know
why Megawatt's got a brighter
idea and all the answers for to
day's quickly decaying world.
Daily: I'm surprised all the
radiation exposure didn't lead
to radical brain damage.
Megawatt: Well, some of us
have it and some of us don't.
Daily: Thank you Mr. Mega
watt, I am proud to share a
country with you.

terview with King Oil himself.
James Megawatt. Following is
a transcript of the conservation.
Daily: Mr Megawatt, what do
you see as the future of Ameri
ca?
Megawatt: I'm definitely for
conservation of all our valuable
land. And all the valuable land
now sprawled across the great
plains, the Appalachian high
lands.and the tundra of Alaska
is now being bled dry. That's
right All that land is being
stripped ot its valuable min
erals. salts, and nutrients by in
satiable. ravenous weeds and
plants. It's a blessed shame. It's
a crime. I have the solution.
First, we rid those defenseless
lands of their green parasites
and then we cover them with a
protective shell ot concrete.
Have you ever noticed how well
cities protect valuable nutrients
in the soil? No God-fearing plant
would try to grow through six in
ches of concrete, no sire.
Daily: Utterly brilliant! I
never knew that destruction and
-construction could preserve our
natural resources so effective
ly. But how do you plan to get rid
ot the greenery?
Megawatt: Just strip mine it
off. Why. the other day, I was
looking at an Escher drawing
and thought how beautiful all
those rolling hills would look if
they were uniformly tiered.
Just think, all of America could
become an abstract art form.
Now there's utility and con
servation of Our Precious

Earthly Nutrients.
Daily: And what about our in
nerspace environment under
the sea?
Megawatt: Have I got an idea
for you' Have you ever noticed
that black oily stuff on tele
phone poles' 1 Well, it's creosol
and it's just like crude oil. Have
you ever stopped to think what
would happen it telephone poles
weren't covered with it 0 Why,
they'd rot. Their lifetime wouid
be a traction of what it is today
Anyway, back to the sea. All
these species they tell me are
becoming extinct — it's because
their lives are too short The
snail darter, the great blue her
on. the whooping crane. Well, if
you consider what oily black
stuff does tor telephone poles,
just think of what it'll do tor the
lives of endangered species It 'll
triple their life expectancy.
With that black protective coat
ing. we'll soon be up to our knees
in today's endangered species!
Daily: And just how do you
plan to accomplish this "coat
ing?"
Megawatt: Easy, take all of
those silly little regulations
about oil drilling safety, cargo
ing and exploring and shred
em! The plan will be known in
every corner of the earth and I'll
be the brain child. Oil is our
friend.
Daily: But what about the
marine plants which need to re
ceive light through the black
coating?
Megawatt: Simple. Once
they're coated, we remove
them. Just think of the advan
tages. No longer will we have all
that undersea clutter keeping
our sewage inflow from flowing
naturally where it should: all
over the world and especially to
the Russians instead of around
our great country. Then, we can
cut up the walls of blackened

kelp and sell them to univer
sities as great works of art. My
plans will bring a future to ail
the world and protect Our Pre
cious Earthly Nutrients. Best ot
