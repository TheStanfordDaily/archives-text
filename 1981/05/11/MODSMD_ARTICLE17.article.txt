Racist cartoon
I strongly protest the printing
of the McNelly cartoon showing
an Arab naming an AWACS air
plane the "Jew Hunter," (Daily
, May 4). The cartoonist's lack
ot understanding of the Middle
East conflicts is appalling, and
his cartoon is blatantly racist
and insulting to my feelings
First, the Middle East con
flict cannot be looked at as an
anti-Semitic drive waged
against the Jews of Israel. This
is too simplistic and quite
wrong. The Lebanese civil war,
food riots in Egypt, the Iranian
Revolution, the civil war in
Yemen are examples of on
going conflicts that can hardly
be explained by the Arabs
against-Jews theory. The sale of
AWACS airplanes to Saudi Ara
bia is motivated by the lack of
stability in the region resulting
from these conflicts. How
ever,the military buildup by the
Saudi (or Israeli or Egyptian)
government can only be used to
oppress the peoples of the area
in their request for political and
economic freedoms. That is
why I oppose the sale of AWACS
airplanes to Saudi Arabia.
Second, the Israeli-Palesti
nian conflict is too complex to
be reduced incorrectly to a
"Jew-hunting" campaign.
Prior to the Zionist enterprise of
colonizing Palestine, Jews were
treated quite well in the Arab
countries.especially when com
pared to the inhumane and mi
serable conditions they were
facing in Eastern Europe. In a
sense, European anti-Semitism
has been the major cause ot suf
fering ot both the Jews and the
Palestinians. The Jews who es
caped the European pogroms
and Holocaust have engaged in

land and demographic trans
formation of Palestine, and thus
oppressing the Palestinians in
their own land.
Third, even if we allow the
cartoonist his "right" of misun
derstanding the Middle East,
we should ndt allow him to prop
agate blatant and tasteless ra
cism. Showing the Arab people
as inhumane Jew-hunters is an
insult to the Arabs, the Jews,
and the human race. This car
toon is not much different from
the medieval stereotype of Jews
killing Christian children to use
their blood in the Passover cele
bration.
Fourth, racism should be
fought wherever it exists and re
gardless of the nature ot its vic
tims. If racism is allowed to
thrive, it may lead to horrible
human and moral losses. The
commemoration of the Holo
caust last weekend should have
reminded us of this simple tact.
Currently, racist stereotypes of
the Arab people are acceptable
among the American public.
The FBI operation ABSCAM
(for Arab Scam) attests to this
tact.
Finally, I think that the editor
of the Daily should have ex
ercised his power by not allow
ing a tasteless and blatantly ra
cist cartoon to appear in the
newspaper By allowing such a
cartoon to be printed, the editor
helps propagate distorting and
insulting images ot the Arab
people.

I agree with Simon Bending's
response (Daily, Apr 24) to Bet

ty Eldon 'Dnilv, Apr. 17) and
would like to further dispel the
notion that graduate students do
not work.
Perhaps it would help the Bet
ty Eldons of this society to think
of a graduate student in a Ph. D.
program as an apprentice in an
intellectual trade. Why? Be
cause the graduate student is in
training to assume the role of a
teacher/scholar. In order to
prepare for this profession, he
or she takes on the following un
abating responsibilities;
massive amounts of reading in
three to four subjects per quar
ter; library research; prepara
tion of oral and written reports;
attendance at guest lectures and
local conferences; learning on
to three foreign languages;
serving on committees and/or
as a student representative; ad
ditional preparation ot an ex
tensive reading list for the oral
examination; and, increasingly,
preparation ot articles and/or
translations for publication in
the hopes of gaining a further
competitive edge in a tight aca
demic job market.
For roughly a thousand
dollars more per year and three
units less per quarter, add the
duties of the teaching fellow:
four to five hours of instruction
per week; preparation ot a daily
lesson plan; office hours; grad
ing of exams and papers; and
staff meetings on curriculum.
Why do graduate students
work so hard for so little? The
apprentice accepts low status
and minimal wages for a
number of years in order to
learn the skills of the trade.

Racist cartoon
I strongly protest the printing
of the McNelly cartoon showing
an Arab naming an AWACS air
plane the "Jew Hunter," (Daily
, May 4). The cartoonist's lack
ot understanding of the Middle
East conflicts is appalling, and
his cartoon is blatantly racist
and insulting to my feelings
First, the Middle East con
flict cannot be looked at as an
anti-Semitic drive waged
against the Jews of Israel. This
is too simplistic and quite
wrong. The Lebanese civil war,
food riots in Egypt, the Iranian
Revolution, the civil war in
Yemen are examples of on
going conflicts that can hardly
be explained by the Arabs
against-Jews theory. The sale of
AWACS airplanes to Saudi Ara
bia is motivated by the lack of
stability in the region resulting
from these conflicts. How
ever,the military buildup by the
Saudi (or Israeli or Egyptian)
government can only be used to
oppress the peoples of the area
in their request for political and
economic freedoms. That is
why I oppose the sale of AWACS
airplanes to Saudi Arabia.
Second, the Israeli-Palesti
nian conflict is too complex to
be reduced incorrectly to a
"Jew-hunting" campaign.
Prior to the Zionist enterprise of
colonizing Palestine, Jews were
treated quite well in the Arab
countries.especially when com
pared to the inhumane and mi
serable conditions they were
facing in Eastern Europe. In a
sense, European anti-Semitism
has been the major cause ot suf
fering ot both the Jews and the
Palestinians. The Jews who es
caped the European pogroms
and Holocaust have engaged in

land and demographic trans
formation of Palestine, and thus
oppressing the Palestinians in
their own land.
Third, even if we allow the
cartoonist his "right" of misun
derstanding the Middle East,
we should ndt allow him to prop
agate blatant and tasteless ra
cism. Showing the Arab people
as inhumane Jew-hunters is an
insult to the Arabs, the Jews,
and the human race. This car
toon is not much different from
the medieval stereotype of Jews
killing Christian children to use
their blood in the Passover cele
bration.
Fourth, racism should be
fought wherever it exists and re
gardless of the nature ot its vic
tims. If racism is allowed to
thrive, it may lead to horrible
human and moral losses. The
commemoration of the Holo
caust last weekend should have
reminded us of this simple tact.
Currently, racist stereotypes of
the Arab people are acceptable
among the American public.
The FBI operation ABSCAM
(for Arab Scam) attests to this
tact.
Finally, I think that the editor
of the Daily should have ex
ercised his power by not allow
ing a tasteless and blatantly ra
cist cartoon to appear in the
newspaper By allowing such a
cartoon to be printed, the editor
helps propagate distorting and
insulting images ot the Arab
people.

I agree with Simon Bending's
response (Daily, Apr 24) to Bet

ty Eldon 'Dnilv, Apr. 17) and
would like to further dispel the
notion that graduate students do
not work.
Perhaps it would help the Bet
ty Eldons of this society to think
of a graduate student in a Ph. D.
program as an apprentice in an
intellectual trade. Why? Be
cause the graduate student is in
training to assume the role of a
teacher/scholar. In order to
prepare for this profession, he
or she takes on the following un
abating responsibilities;
massive amounts of reading in
three to four subjects per quar
ter; library research; prepara
tion of oral and written reports;
attendance at guest lectures and
local conferences; learning on
to three foreign languages;
serving on committees and/or
as a student representative; ad
ditional preparation ot an ex
tensive reading list for the oral
examination; and, increasingly,
preparation ot articles and/or
translations for publication in
the hopes of gaining a further
