## Issues live on after Sands 
### 
They icho do riot know how to live must make a
merit of dying.
— George Bernard Shaw
I)o \ou know what it's like to fall in the mud
and he kicked in the face by an iron boot? Of
course you don 't .Wo one does. It doesn't happen.
It's stupid to think about it.
— Rex Kramer, Airplane
Bobby Sands was a terrorist, a criminal, a killer
of innocent bystanders in a holy war. He took his
own life last week in a British prison by refusing
to eat for 66 days. Now he's a martyr tor the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), and it all hell doesn't
break loose in Ireland because of his death, we can
only call it providence or luck.
Sands' death, much like the situation in
Northern Ireland, is indeed a tale of sound, fury,
and frustration, full of passion but signifying noth
ing Sands was a militant force in the IRA, theo
retically devoted to unifying Ireland and Northern
Ireland and bridging the violent Catho
lic/Protestant schism that is splitting the nations.
Yet. anyone who has heard of the IRA's guerrilla
activities should wonder what sort of unification
could be achieved through terrorism.
Across the Irish Sea, the British government
sees no reason even to consider the issue of Prot
estant/Catholic disputes, and so their only meas
ure toward peace is to send troops over — some
2,000 at last count. These soldiers, though, have
disturbing habits of kicking the stuffing out of
jailed IRA members and shooting folks in the
streets of Belfast. Thus, the conflict expands to in
clude England, and the brutality increases. In
evitably, unification is all but forgotten.
What remains is hatred, with people fighting
more out of habit than necessity. What would hap
pen. for example, if the IRA was to succeed in
reaching its professed goal of unification? It
would have no reason to exist. All the urban war
riors would have to put their toys away and coex
ist with their former enemies — which, given the
constantly escalating hatred on both sides will be
difficult.
In this way, groups like the IRA destroy their
own goals. It's easier ,o identify with a cause than
to be an individual aligned with a cause, and so not
knowing how to live, the militants immortalize
dying. Bobby Sands' martyrdom only raises the
stakes of the battle in Ireland, and as more
players jump into the game, the whole mess gets
harder to stop.
But what meaning does this carry on this side of
the Atlantic? We can't fully understand the emo
tions of the Sands tragedy, for we aren't directly
involved. That's good, in a way — I certainly don't

look forward to having a lot of experience with
civil war But in terms of the future, we need to
learn the lesson before we take the class. If we
truly understood the trouble in Ireland that pro
duced the Bobby Sands impasse, our foreign poli
cy makers wouldn't be so eager to exploit other
nations' hostilities.
This country's foreign policy is like a struggling
spiritualist slipping her card into a passing coffin
Not content with listing to the apocalyptic rumbl
ings ot our washer/dryers, we look for trouble
elsewhere — in the Middle East, in Central Amer
ica, in Asia. Simply put, we're a nation ot interna
tional ambulance chasers, staking out all the hot
corners of diplomacy, rushing in where smaller
nations fear to tread. Policeman ot the World. De
fender ot Democracy, the Mary Worth of Interna
tional Relations.
Of course, the government has reasons to think
this way The United States has a legend of invin
cibility that allows us to gamble in overseas ad
ventures. We have one of the two largest military
stockpiles in the history of mankind — who would
dare think about excluding us from their affairs 0
And it'll be a dark everting in Meyer before enemv
troops invade.the United States. So there's noth
ing to fear. Onward, Christian soldiers.
Onward, indeed — as if the world was a red
carpet. What we're really doing is using a divining
rod to walk through a mining field. Here is where
the death of Bobby Sands carries some direct
meaning for us. We're not just gambling in in
ternational relations, where we can lose and bit
and then go home. Violent rivalries like the one in
Northern Ireland are for real, with real people
dying, and just because we took Vietnam P/NC
doesn't mean we should forget until next time.
The real tragedy of Bobby Sands is not the sheer
senselessness ot his death — that is just one more
addition to the list of senseless acts in Ireland re
cently. Sands is gone — he doesn't have to find a
solution. But the rest of us do. Those who simply
look and say "What a shame" and go about their
business implicitly condone what happened. Even
worse, they tacitly approve of our insensitivity as
a nation and favor our exploitation of similar situ
ations. If we get caught with our hand in the
cookie jar though, we can't look anywhere tor
help. No wonder starvation seemed such a good
idea tor Bobby Sands. We're almost begging for
the same fate by sitting at the gates ot hell, wait
ing for hell to begin. All in all, I'd rather be in the
bleachers.
