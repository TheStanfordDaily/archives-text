## Shell-game or no, MX doesn't warrant risks 
### 
It seems as if people have be
come immune to the threat of
nuclear war. Yet many of the
decisions being made now by
our government directly or in
directly affect the likelihood of
catastrophe, and require and
public which is conscious ot the
tremendous dangers involved.
The MX missile system is one of
the most crucial matters of this
type.
I wish I could say "proposed
MX missile system." But it is
not just a proposal anymore; it
is under tull-scale engineering
development. Over two billion
dollars have been appropriated
already; total cost estimates

run from the conservative Air
Force figure of $33 billion, to
over $100 billion. And this for a
system with a number of fatal
flaws.
There are two ways of argu
ing against the MX. One is that
the MX should not be built at
all; the other that if it is going to
be built, it should not be
deployed in the shell-game
manner that is currently the
most favored option. But before
going into either argument, I
must describe the planned bas
ing system.
Under the current plan, a to
tal of two hundred missiles,
each carrying ten warheads,
would be deployed within 460)
shelters spread over the Great
Basin region of Nevada and
Utah. The missiles would be
moved periodically between the
shelters on huge trucks, so that
their exact location at any time
would supposedly remain un
detectable. The resemblance to
the old shell-game is obvious.
It is difficult to handle both
arguments at once, because the
"no MX" argument seems to
render the "no shell-game argu
ment irrelevant. But re
alistically, the basing mode is
something over which the public
currently has much more con
trol. Alternative basing modes
are currently being investigated
by a panel appointed by Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger; its recommendation
will likely come before Con
gress later this year. There are
several reasons why the pro
posed deplovment method
would be disastrous
The multiple shelter deploy
ment system will occupy be
tween 12,0)0 and 40,000 square
miles, of which an as yet un
determined area will be either
completely ruined or per
manently off limits. In com
parison, national parklands cov
er about 25,000 square miles.
This is about the size ot the state
ot West Virginia. Within the
deployment region the 4600
shelters will be constructed, in
addition to over 9000 miles of
special roadway strng enough to
carry a 500-ton vehicle, and all
other necessary operations and
command centers. The environ
mental, social, and economic
risks posed by a project ot this
scope are tremendous.
Among the environmental
consequences are the endanger
ing of a number of plant and
animal species, the destruction
of rangeland. and the damage ot
lands and vegetation important

or even sacred to regional Indi
an tribes. But the greatest en
vironmental danger stems from
the huge water requirements of
the project. Estimates of water
needs run from 300,000 acre-feet
to 600.000 acre-feet over the life
ot the project (the city of Las
Vagas, by comparison used
about 72,00) acre-feet in 1979).
Meanwhile, the local econo
my will suffer all the effects of
the classical boom and bust as
sociated with projects of this
type. The population will be in
creased to several times its cur
rent level, and strain on the
states tor provision of services
will be immense. The demand
tor resources will be huge, and
the competition for labor, along
with the loss ot grazing land and
water, may destroy the live
stock industry in the area.
There are two other draw
backs to the proposed mode of
deployment. One is the ethical
consideration of making a par
ticular region into what Air

Force General Lew Allen called
a "nuclear sponge." The other
is a practical, if rather fright
ening consideration — if the MX
did provoke a first strike, re
gardless of how many missiles
survived, the winds would carry
the fallout eastward across the
heart of the nation, both de
stroying both a large part ot the
population and the food produc
ing capability of the nation for
years to come.
While the reasons not to
deploy the MX in Nevada-Utah
are considerable, the argu
ments against the MX as a
whole are greater still. The
common supposition that more
weapons equals more security
simply doesn't hold in this case.
One of the premises upon
which the multiple shelter bas
ing system relies is that the So
viets will be unable to ascertain
the exact location of the mis
siles. This, while not im
possible, seems highly doubtful.
A huge missile on a trailer gives

off a great many signals — heat,
noise, tire depressions, seismic
signals, etc. The Air Force
plans to build a "missile sim
ulator" as a decoy. But to as
sume that the two will be indist
inguishable, and what is more,
will remain so in the face of in
creasingly sophisticated satel
lite spying technology, is wish
ful thinking.
Another premise is that the
Soviets will be unable to build
enough warheads to overwhelm
the targets. Yet with no arms
limitations 'treaty, a situation
which likely will continue well
into the future, there is no limit
to the number of warheads the
Soviets can deploy.
Perhaps the most dangerous
aspect of the MX is the effect it
will have on the Soviets, be
cause in spite of its justification
as a response to Soviet first
strike capability, the MX is
itself a first-strike weapon. It
will be the most accurate mis
sile to date, and its 350 kiloton
warheads are more than twice
as large as those on our current
"top-of-the-line" Minuteman
111 missiles.
Then consider this: About one
fourth of our warheads are land
based missiles; yet the per
ceived vulnerability of these
missiles is the motivation be
hind the MX. The Soviets, on the
other hand, have almost three
quarters of their warheads on
land-based missiles.
And regardless of whether we
would ever launch a first strike,
acknowledging the possibility
decreases our security. First of
all, it makes the "launch on
warning" system more tempt
ing, a system which greatly in
creases the risk of an accidental
nuclear exchange. And second,
a nation that feels vulnerable to
a first strike is tempted, in time
of crisis, to shoot first — either
use em or lose 'em." Thus, we
actually bring nuclear war
closer than it is now.
We are not as safe with the
MX as we would be without; and
what's more, it renders arms
control talks, which in the long
run are our only real hope, that
much more difficult. Because of
the long term nature of the
project, it does not seem to mer
it concern right now. But now is
the best chance we have of stop
ping it. Every day that passes is
momentum behind the system,
momentum that is increasingly
hard to stop.
