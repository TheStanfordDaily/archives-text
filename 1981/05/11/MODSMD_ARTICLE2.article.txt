# ASSU to examine fee assessment system
## 
### Mike Resnick 
A special election autumn quarter
may help solve the financial problems
of the 1 0 student organizations that did
not receive the fee assessments they
requested in last month's election.
However, according to COP member
Marc Ventresca, these problems sig
nal a need to "really look at the pres
ent system and see if it is viable."
On behalf of concerned ASSU of
ficials, Ventresca initiated last Tues
day's meeting of representatives of
the groups whose fee assessments
were not validated. "It was a way to
bring people together to talk about a
common problem," said Ventresca.
The consensus of the groups present
was to wait until autumn quarter to
call for a special election to be paid for
by the participating groups collective
ly-
If a sufficient number of students
vote in their favor in the special elec
tion, the organizations would be able
to receive their assessments as early
as winter,enabling them to operate for
the rest of the year. But Ventresca
stressed that even this would be tem
porary solution. "Instead ot just
patching up the system, we're going to
have to go back to basics. The nature
and number ot student organiztations
have changed since the fee
assessment procedures were first im
plemented," he said.
Ventresca indicated that the failure
ot so many groups to secure the
assessments clearly shows that fee
assessments are no longer an auto
matic give-away of money. "A new
student group has to prove it does a
valuable enough service to the com
munity."
Ventresca also mentioned that an
ad hoc committee will be formed "by

whoever will be around this summer"
to try to tormulate changes in the tee
assessment: proccoc. Additionally.
several ASSU Senators-elect will ex
amine how student groups at colleges
in their home towns obtain funds.
Among those who plan to share their
ideas with the ASSU are several repre
sentatives of groups that will partici
pate in a future special fee assessment
election.
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) Associate
Director Sukie Jackson said, "I'd
rather be spending my time with VIA
than working on fee assessment poli
cy." Jackson will, however, partici
pate in the ad hoc committee this sum
mer.
While a majority ot those who voted
approved the VIA assessment in the
election, it failed because less than 20
percent of the entire student body
voted on it. Jackson felt that the ASSU
did not adequately explain the tee
assessments. She added that students
don't realize how unique the Stanford
fee assessment program is. "At other
schools it is mandatory, while here
students can even get their money
back if an assessment passes," she
said.
Jackson suggested a more effective
way of handling fee assessments. "In
clude objective statements about fee
assessments and the individual or
ganizations asking for assessments
with the registration materials," she
said, "and have students check boxes
and pay for specific assessments at
that time." This would eliminate vot
ing and fee assessment refunds while
leaving the choice to each student.
Rob Holbrook ot the Publications
Board — which provides between one
and two dozen Stanford publications
with some ot their tunds — said that

the Pub Board would also participate
in a special election. Holbrook said he
favored .Mi.'injjinc the tlt'dions to fall
quarter, "when organizations are
more prone to advertise and before
students are tired of everything and
want to go home and sunbathe. "
Holbrook said the 20 percent rule
was unfair. According to Holbrook.
"If 20 percent vote in the election,
then the whole election should be vali
dated; validity shouldn't be de
termined on a measure by measure
basis."
Despite these problems with the
system, most ot the groups will be able
to continue functioning "with little in
terruption in service," according to

Ventresca, provided they receive fee
assessments by winter quarter.
HoJbrook said that the Pub Board
"has enough money to make it through
autumn quarter, but after that, we
may have some problems."
VlA's policy is to not accept money
trom either the government or busi
nesses with vested interests in Asia
and the East. Jackson explained, "We
don't want to go over there with
strings attached." She added that the
assessment "wasn't a make or break
thing, but it sure would have been nice
to have the money."
The Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education (SCOPE) also did not
receive the requested funds.

day's meeting of representatives of
the groups whose fee assessments
were not validated. "It was a way to
bring people together to talk about a
common problem," said Ventresca.
The consensus of the groups present
was to wait until autumn quarter to
call for a special election to be paid for
by the participating groups collective
ly-
If a sufficient number of students
vote in their favor in the special elec
tion, the organizations would be able
to receive their assessments as early
as winter,enabling them to operate for
the rest of the year. But Ventresca
stressed that even this would be tem
porary solution. "Instead ot just
patching up the system, we're going to
have to go back to basics. The nature
and number ot student organiztations
have changed since the fee
assessment procedures were first im
plemented," he said.
Ventresca indicated that the failure
ot so many groups to secure the
assessments clearly shows that fee
assessments are no longer an auto
matic give-away of money. "A new
student group has to prove it does a
valuable enough service to the com
munity."
Ventresca also mentioned that an
ad hoc committee will be formed "by

whoever will be around this summer"
to try to tormulate changes in the tee
assessment: proccoc. Additionally.
several ASSU Senators-elect will ex
amine how student groups at colleges
in their home towns obtain funds.
Among those who plan to share their
ideas with the ASSU are several repre
sentatives of groups that will partici
pate in a future special fee assessment
election.
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) Associate
Director Sukie Jackson said, "I'd
rather be spending my time with VIA
than working on fee assessment poli
cy." Jackson will, however, partici
pate in the ad hoc committee this sum
mer.
While a majority ot those who voted
approved the VIA assessment in the
election, it failed because less than 20
percent of the entire student body
voted on it. Jackson felt that the ASSU
did not adequately explain the tee
assessments. She added that students
don't realize how unique the Stanford
fee assessment program is. "At other
schools it is mandatory, while here
students can even get their money
back if an assessment passes," she
said.
Jackson suggested a more effective
way of handling fee assessments. "In
clude objective statements about fee
assessments and the individual or
ganizations asking for assessments
with the registration materials," she
said, "and have students check boxes
and pay for specific assessments at
that time." This would eliminate vot
ing and fee assessment refunds while
leaving the choice to each student.
Rob Holbrook ot the Publications
Board — which provides between one
and two dozen Stanford publications
with some ot their tunds — said that

the Pub Board would also participate
in a special election. Holbrook said he
favored .Mi.'injjinc the tlt'dions to fall
quarter, "when organizations are
more prone to advertise and before
students are tired of everything and
want to go home and sunbathe. "
Holbrook said the 20 percent rule
was unfair. According to Holbrook.
"If 20 percent vote in the election,
then the whole election should be vali
dated; validity shouldn't be de
termined on a measure by measure
basis."
Despite these problems with the
system, most ot the groups will be able
to continue functioning "with little in
terruption in service," according to

Ventresca, provided they receive fee
assessments by winter quarter.
HoJbrook said that the Pub Board
"has enough money to make it through
autumn quarter, but after that, we
may have some problems."
VlA's policy is to not accept money
trom either the government or busi
nesses with vested interests in Asia
and the East. Jackson explained, "We
don't want to go over there with
strings attached." She added that the
assessment "wasn't a make or break
thing, but it sure would have been nice
to have the money."
The Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education (SCOPE) also did not
receive the requested funds.
A special election autumn quarter
may help solve the financial problems
of the 1 0 student organizations that did
not receive the fee assessments they
requested in last month's election.
However, according to COP member
Marc Ventresca, these problems sig
nal a need to "really look at the pres
ent system and see if it is viable."
On behalf of concerned ASSU of
ficials, Ventresca initiated last Tues
day's meeting of representatives of
the groups whose fee assessments
were not validated. "It was a way to
bring people together to talk about a
common problem," said Ventresca.
