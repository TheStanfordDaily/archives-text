This weekend. Stanford stu
dents and community members
flocked to White Plaza for the
ninth annual Stanford Spring
Spring Fair Sponsored by The
Bridge, the three day lair
boasted over '00 craftsmen sell
ing everything from stuffed
mooseheads to carrot-shaped
slippers, a 15 international food
stands, student and non-student

bands, bellydancers. pup
peteers, and other forms of live
entertainment.
Planning for the fair began in
early February when the Bridge
sent out 400 applications to local
craftsmen The 230 that were re
turned, along with descriptions
and photographs of the artist's
work, were carefully screened,
and 10 craftsmen were
selected. According to Susan

Larson, coordinator of the
event, the chief criterion in
choosing was originality — all
items were to be hand-crafted
and unique "Many crafts fairs
have become mass flea mar
kets," Larson explained
"Through our selective screen
ing process we're assured an
event that is an artistic as well
as a commercial venture." Jew
elry, quilts, hand-made paper,

pottery, leatherwork, graphics,
and stained glass all with a wide
range of prices, were chosen
The funds raised by the Bridge
are vital to its operation The
Bridge was started in 1971 as a
drug counseling center As the
drug problem decreased, the
Bridge turned toward the prob
lems ot personal growth, rela
tionships, family situations, and
schoolwork, and today deals
with both student and communi
ty members
Much of the money raised by
the fair is used to pay phone
bills.Because a great deal of the
counseling is done over the
phone, a sophisticated — and
costly — system is needed
Funds are also allocated for
workshops, which are designed
to make the particpants more
aware of their problems.
