Los Angeles —Though the
sign said David Marks Tennis
Stadium, the • Stanford-USC
men's tennis match Saturday
took place on the set of the mov
ie "How Brown Was My Val
ley."
Truth be told, the San Fernan
do Valley wss miles away, be
hind what \ivere rumored to be
mountains in the background.
With visibility the quality ot
week-old dishwater, you
couldn't be sure. Brown de
scribed not only the color of the
air but the play ot the Cards,
who wilted like week-old lettuce
in the poor excuse tor air here.
They came, they saw, they
coughed. And coughed.
Upon leaving, Stanford (16-2)
had lost not only to both UCLA
and USC by 5-4 scores, but -a
share of the Pacitic->0 Con
ference Southern Division title
and an almost certain No. 1
seeding in this week's NCAA
tournament as well.
What became clear in the
mystery oxygen to coach Dick
Gould and his players was this:
without a healthy Scott Bond
urant, Stanford is just another
team in the pack.
It was no coincidence that
before this weekend, Stanford
had won at least tour of six sin
gles matches in every dual
match. The Cards simply had
one more better player than any
of their opponents. Without him,
they split singles 3-3 in both
matches, then lost two ot three
doubles matches both days.
The loss of Bondurant to neck
and shoulder miseries, when
combined with the hosts' home
court advantages and the smog,
proved too much to overcome.
Bondurant travelled here
hoping he would be able to play.
By Friday, it became clear sin
gles was out of the question. He
worked out in the morning, then
didn't decide to sit out doubles
against UCLA until right betore
they began. "It wasn't worth
risking injury," he said.
The junior felt good enough
Saturday to play doubles, and he
and partner Scott Davis won
Stanford's only doubles victory,'
6-0, 7-6 (5-4) over Trojans Billy
Nealon and Roger Knapp. But
his absence in the singles lineup

was the difference.
Gould refused Friday to ad
mit that losing Bondurant was a
factor, cutting off a question to
say "That had nothing to do with
it. We just got beat." By Satur
day, he admitted "it hurts to
have him out of there."
What also hurt Stanford was
their doubles play. As Gould did
acknowledge, "we've got to win
two out of three doubles if we're
going to win the nationals." But
the Cards were shut out at No. 2
doubles, home of Pac-10 champs
Mike Falberg and Jetf Arons.
The duo had been undefeated
before this weekend, which ac
counted for their promotion to
the second spot. Though they
went to three sets both days, in
cluding a remarkable comeback
Saturday against USC's Sean
Brawley and Hugo Scott,
Falberg and Arons still came up
empty.
"They played a little
streaky," Gould said Saturday.
"Yesterday they started the
tirst set well and let down. It
was the third set today."
Falberg and Arons were down
two service breaks in the final
set against Brawley and Scott
and fought back to force a
tiebreaker before succumbing
6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (5-2).
There was considerable pres
sure on them Friday once Bond
urant benched himself. John
Corse substituted as Davis'
partner, and the results were
predictable, a 6-3, 6-3 rout at the
hands of Blaine Willenborg and
John Davis, putting Stanford in
a 4-3 hole.
That it had been 3-all before
doubles was no surprise. South
ern Division champion UCLA's
(21-2, 9-1) depth is equalled only
by Stanford. But the manner in
which the teams tied was some
what of a shock.
Tim Mayotte continued his
mastery of Freeman at No. 1
singles 6-2, 6-3. No. 3 Jim Gur
fein was steamrolled 6-2, 6-4 by
South African left-hander Rob
bie Venter, who he defeated
here last month.
Another shocker came at No.
4, where Falberg snapped Dan
Saltz' dual match unbeaten
string at 16 with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3
victory. To say it was Falberg's
last gasp would not be exag
gerating a great deal.

Saturday's smog devastated
the Santa Barbara treshman,
who almost had to retire before
the 6-4, 6-' loss to USC's Scott
was finished. "I couldn't even
run," Falberg managed to say
between post-match coughs.
The chorus of coughs was
sung by both teams, but Stan
ford seemed to be harder-hit.
Corse broke Jim Agate early in
the first set then slowly became
incapacitated by the conditions.
At one point he was hanging onto
the court's fence trying to catch
his breath. He lost 7-6 (5-4), 6-3.
Gurfein, who lost again Satur
day, this time to a red-hot
Brawley 7-6 (5-1), 7-6 (5-3), de
scribed the quality ot the air
most succinctly: "You bleepin'
die."
NOTES: — USC coach Leach
thought Stanford would wipe up
the courts with his team (26-8,
5-5). To say he was stunned by
the results is an under
statement. "I really didn't think
we had a chance, but I didn't tell
the kids that," Leach
said . . .Invitations and seed
ings tor the NCAA tournament
will be announced today. The 16-
team championship begins Sat
urday and goes through Tues
day. The players take Wednes
day oft before beginning tour
days of individual play Thurs
day.
