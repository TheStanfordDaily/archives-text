# Women beat BYU, lose to USC
## 
### Steve Odell 
Special to the first-year staffers issue
It is said the more things
change, the more they stay
the same.
Nothing could have been
truer in describing the re
sults of the Stanford wom
en's tennis team's matches
this weekend at Stanford
Tennis Stadium, as they lost
a heartbreaking 5-4 decision
to top-ranked USCN now 29-0)
Friday — reaffirming the
Trojans' claim to the No. 1
team in the nation — and took
apart fourth-ranked BYU
(now 8-2), 7-2 on Saturday —
reaffirming the Cardinals'
status as one of the top three
teams in women's collegiate
tennis. Indeed, the Cards
showed that they are one of
the two little engines that
could knock oft the Trojans
(along with UCLA) to end
their two-year dynasty in the
sport, but haven't so far.
But oh, how close Stanford
came, despite the tact that
they were sporting a re
vamped line-up because of
the absence ot two of their
top six players Susy Jaeger,
who usually plays in the
middle of the line-up, was out
because of sore feet, and
Michelle Weiss, who usually
plays at number six tor the
Cards, spent the weekend in
Cowell with pneumonia.
Stanford coach Frank
Brennan was pleased with
how his team responded de
spite the absence ot Weiss
and Jaeger. "I thought we
did pretty good," Brennan
said. "We certainly got their
attention, playing without
two of our starters and fin
ishing 5-4. Our problem is
that we're too streaky. We go
in good streaks, and then we
hit a bad streak. The dif
ference is, a good team
knows when to cut it off. We
don't do that."
The changes in this week
end's matches were most ap
parent in Stanford's doubles
line-up where Brennan split
up his usual number one
doubles team ot Caryn
Copeland and Alycia
Moulton, and moved
Jaeger's usual partner at No.
2, Elise Burgin up to the top
team with Moulton.
Copeland played at two,
along with Donna Rubin, her
last year's doubles partner
who normally sees action at
No. 3 with Weiss.
"It hurt us a bit psy
chologically when we saw
they had changed around
their line-up," admitted USC
coach Dave Borelli. "But I
really don't think it's going to
matter that much who plays
or where they play, as long as
we're playing well. I think
we could have played better,
however, and I think Stan
ford could have played bet
ter, also, but things kind of
fell our way. We were lucky
today, and I'm very happy to
come out with a win."
And well he should have
been as the match came
down to the wire as expected.
And the wire was plugged
into court two, where Rubin
and Copeland lost a hard
fought 7-6, 6-2 doubles match

to USC's Anna Maria
Fernandez and Nina Voydat
The Cardinal duo began by
streaking to a 5-0 lead in the
first set. breaking their oppo
nents' serve twice.
However. Voydat and
Fernandez came right back
in true Trojan fashion, dupli
cating Stanford's effort with
five straight games of their
own to knot the set.
Rubin stopped the streak,
holding in the eleventh and
acing Voydat for the game
winner The Cards had the
set within their grasp once
again, but blew their chance
as they lost two set and break
points on Voydat's serve in
the twelfth, pushing the set
into a tiebreaker.
Again the Cards had their
Trojan opponents on the
ropes, gaining a 6-4 lead in
the breaker, only to sur
render two more set points
when Fernandez sent a
backhand through for a win
ner and when Voydat hit a su
perb angle volley to make it
6-all.
The teams exchanged
points until it was 9-9, when
the Trojans pulled out the
last two points to take the
marathon set. Riding on the
momentum of the first set,
the Trojans easily took the
second to clinch the team
match with their fifth win of
the afternoon and extend
their match winning streak
to 63 straight.
The Cardinals split the oth
er two doubles matches with
Moulton and Burgin outlast
ing Linda Siegel and Kelly
Henry, 6-'., 3-6, 6-2, and Gayle
Chan and Alison Hardey los
ing to Paola Sessarego and
Anna Lucia Fernandez
(Anna Maria's twin) 6-3, 6-3.
The way the Cards came
out of the gate, it looked as
though one doubles victory
would be enough. Stanford's
number one, Alycia Moulton,
embarassed A.M. Fernandez
in the first set of their duel,
6-0, losing only ten points in
the process, and literally ov
erpowering her opponent
with a combination of pass
ing shots, good returns and
strong service.
After a letdown in the sec
ond set, losing 6-2, Moulton
came back and forged her
way to a 6-5 lead in the third,
breaking Fernandez in the
twelfth game tor the match.
At number two, Rubin
started out likewise, hitting
pinpoint winners and forcing
Troy's Kelly Henry into a lot
ot errors, sweeping to a 6-0
first set victory. Henry
turned the tables on Rubin in
the second, as she started to
connect and tied the match
with a 6-0 set of her own.
Henry dominated in the third
also, winning 6-2, to beat
Rubin for the third straight
time this season.
Against BYU on Saturday,
the Cards were the ones pull
ing out the close matches,
and as a result, ended up tak
ing five of six singles and the
match before the doubles
even began.
At number four against the
Wildcats, Stanford's
Copeland fell behind early
against the BYU's Susan

Pendo. getting broken twice
in digging herself a 5-2 de
fecit. After a conference
with interim assistant coach
Greg Hing, Copeland
stormed back to take seven
straight games, getting her
serve-and-volley together
for a 7-5, 6-3 win
At number six. Gayle Chan
responded to the call of duty
by coming off of the bench to
win for the second straight
day. Chan was beaten sound
ly by Tina Holding in the first
set 6-2, before bouncing back
to trounce her opponent in
the next two sets. 6-0. 6-2.
Moulton and Burgin won
big matches against BYU.
also, as they also picked up
two singles victories over the
weekend Moulton, after fall
ing behind 3-2 in both sets,
came on to beat Tracy Tan
ner at number one, 6-4, 6-3.
And Burgin. the treshman
torm Baltimore, galloped
over Lindley Tanner
(Tracy's sister) 6-0. 6-4.
"I was very pleased to
take it (the match) in sin
gles," said Brennan of his
team's performance against
BYU. "Sue (Rasmussen)
came back nicely today.
Alycia (Moulton) is playing
her best tennis ot the year,
and so is Elise < Burgin)."
The Cards are now 12-4 on
the year, with three losses
against the Trojans and one
against UCLA, Tuesday's
visitor to the Farm. The
Bruins boast a lot of depth all
down the line, and are ranked

third in the nation, behind
Stanford The UCLAns
soundly defeated Stanford
6-2 down in Los Angeles last
month, but the Cards also
own a 5-4 win over the
Bruins, at the NIKE Invita
tional Tournament in March
"They're playing very
good tennis right now.'' ap
praised Brennan of his
team s next opponent "They
are an extremely deep team,
and that might hurt us with
two of our starters out.
They're strong where we're
strong It's going to be tight
It'll probably go 5-4."
Brennan. who was fairly
pleased with the crowd turn
out from the weekend
matches, is hoping for simi
lar fan support Tuesday.
"There will be lots of action.
The fans are getting their
money's worth For a buck,
it's the best show in town."
Action at Stanford Tennis
Stadium will start at 1:30
p.m. tomorrow against the
Bruins.

hit a bad streak. The dif
ference is, a good team
knows when to cut it off. We
don't do that."
The changes in this week
end's matches were most ap
parent in Stanford's doubles
line-up where Brennan split
up his usual number one
doubles team ot Caryn
Copeland and Alycia
Moulton, and moved
Jaeger's usual partner at No.
2, Elise Burgin up to the top
team with Moulton.
Copeland played at two,
along with Donna Rubin, her
last year's doubles partner
who normally sees action at
No. 3 with Weiss.
"It hurt us a bit psy
chologically when we saw
they had changed around
their line-up," admitted USC
coach Dave Borelli. "But I
really don't think it's going to
matter that much who plays
or where they play, as long as
we're playing well. I think
we could have played better,
however, and I think Stan
ford could have played bet
ter, also, but things kind of
fell our way. We were lucky
today, and I'm very happy to
come out with a win."
And well he should have
been as the match came
down to the wire as expected.
And the wire was plugged
into court two, where Rubin
and Copeland lost a hard
fought 7-6, 6-2 doubles match

to USC's Anna Maria
Fernandez and Nina Voydat
The Cardinal duo began by
streaking to a 5-0 lead in the
first set. breaking their oppo
nents' serve twice.
However. Voydat and
Fernandez came right back
in true Trojan fashion, dupli
cating Stanford's effort with
five straight games of their
own to knot the set.
Rubin stopped the streak,
holding in the eleventh and
acing Voydat for the game
winner The Cards had the
set within their grasp once
again, but blew their chance
as they lost two set and break
points on Voydat's serve in
the twelfth, pushing the set
into a tiebreaker.
Again the Cards had their
Trojan opponents on the
ropes, gaining a 6-4 lead in
the breaker, only to sur
render two more set points
when Fernandez sent a
backhand through for a win
ner and when Voydat hit a su
perb angle volley to make it
6-all.
The teams exchanged
points until it was 9-9, when
the Trojans pulled out the
last two points to take the
marathon set. Riding on the
momentum of the first set,
the Trojans easily took the
second to clinch the team
match with their fifth win of
the afternoon and extend
their match winning streak
to 63 straight.
The Cardinals split the oth
er two doubles matches with
Moulton and Burgin outlast
ing Linda Siegel and Kelly
Henry, 6-'., 3-6, 6-2, and Gayle
Chan and Alison Hardey los
ing to Paola Sessarego and
Anna Lucia Fernandez
(Anna Maria's twin) 6-3, 6-3.
The way the Cards came
out of the gate, it looked as
though one doubles victory
would be enough. Stanford's
number one, Alycia Moulton,
embarassed A.M. Fernandez
in the first set of their duel,
6-0, losing only ten points in
the process, and literally ov
erpowering her opponent
with a combination of pass
ing shots, good returns and
strong service.
After a letdown in the sec
ond set, losing 6-2, Moulton
came back and forged her
way to a 6-5 lead in the third,
breaking Fernandez in the
twelfth game tor the match.
At number two, Rubin
started out likewise, hitting
pinpoint winners and forcing
Troy's Kelly Henry into a lot
ot errors, sweeping to a 6-0
first set victory. Henry
turned the tables on Rubin in
the second, as she started to
connect and tied the match
with a 6-0 set of her own.
Henry dominated in the third
also, winning 6-2, to beat
Rubin for the third straight
time this season.
Against BYU on Saturday,
the Cards were the ones pull
ing out the close matches,
and as a result, ended up tak
ing five of six singles and the
match before the doubles
even began.
At number four against the
Wildcats, Stanford's
Copeland fell behind early
against the BYU's Susan

Pendo. getting broken twice
in digging herself a 5-2 de
fecit. After a conference
with interim assistant coach
Greg Hing, Copeland
stormed back to take seven
straight games, getting her
serve-and-volley together
for a 7-5, 6-3 win
At number six. Gayle Chan
responded to the call of duty
by coming off of the bench to
win for the second straight
day. Chan was beaten sound
ly by Tina Holding in the first
set 6-2, before bouncing back
to trounce her opponent in
the next two sets. 6-0. 6-2.
Moulton and Burgin won
big matches against BYU.
also, as they also picked up
two singles victories over the
weekend Moulton, after fall
ing behind 3-2 in both sets,
came on to beat Tracy Tan
ner at number one, 6-4, 6-3.
And Burgin. the treshman
torm Baltimore, galloped
over Lindley Tanner
(Tracy's sister) 6-0. 6-4.
"I was very pleased to
take it (the match) in sin
gles," said Brennan of his
team's performance against
BYU. "Sue (Rasmussen)
came back nicely today.
Alycia (Moulton) is playing
her best tennis ot the year,
and so is Elise < Burgin)."
The Cards are now 12-4 on
the year, with three losses
against the Trojans and one
against UCLA, Tuesday's
visitor to the Farm. The
Bruins boast a lot of depth all
down the line, and are ranked

third in the nation, behind
Stanford The UCLAns
soundly defeated Stanford
6-2 down in Los Angeles last
month, but the Cards also
own a 5-4 win over the
Bruins, at the NIKE Invita
tional Tournament in March
"They're playing very
good tennis right now.'' ap
praised Brennan of his
team s next opponent "They
are an extremely deep team,
and that might hurt us with
two of our starters out.
They're strong where we're
strong It's going to be tight
It'll probably go 5-4."
Brennan. who was fairly
pleased with the crowd turn
out from the weekend
matches, is hoping for simi
lar fan support Tuesday.
"There will be lots of action.
The fans are getting their
money's worth For a buck,
it's the best show in town."
Action at Stanford Tennis
Stadium will start at 1:30
p.m. tomorrow against the
Bruins.

Special to the first-year staffers issue
It is said the more things
change, the more they stay
the same.
Nothing could have been
truer in describing the re

this weekend at Stanford
Tennis Stadium, as they lost
a heartbreaking 5-4 decision
to top-ranked USCN now 29-0)
Friday — reaffirming the
Trojans' claim to the No. 1
team in the nation — and took
apart fourth-ranked BYU
(now 8-2), 7-2 on Saturday —
reaffirming the Cardinals'
status as one of the top three
teams in women's collegiate
tennis. Indeed, the Cards
showed that they are one of
the two little engines that
could knock oft the Trojans
(along with UCLA) to end
their two-year dynasty in the
sport, but haven't so far.
But oh, how close Stanford
came, despite the tact that
they were sporting a re
vamped line-up because of
the absence ot two of their
top six players Susy Jaeger,
who usually plays in the
middle of the line-up, was out
because of sore feet, and
Michelle Weiss, who usually
plays at number six tor the
Cards, spent the weekend in
Cowell with pneumonia.
Stanford coach Frank
Brennan was pleased with
how his team responded de
spite the absence ot Weiss
and Jaeger. "I thought we
did pretty good," Brennan
said. "We certainly got their

two of our starters and fin

cating Stanford's effort with
five straight games of their
own to knot the set.
Rubin stopped the streak,
holding in the eleventh and
acing Voydat for the game
winner The Cards had the
set within their grasp once
again, but blew their chance
as they lost two set and break
points on Voydat's serve in
the twelfth, pushing the set
into a tiebreaker.
Again the Cards had their
Trojan opponents on the
ropes, gaining a 6-4 lead in
the breaker, only to sur
render two more set points
when Fernandez sent a
backhand through for a win
ner and when Voydat hit a su
perb angle volley to make it
6-all.
The teams exchanged
points until it was 9-9, when
the Trojans pulled out the
last two points to take the
marathon set. Riding on the
momentum of the first set,
the Trojans easily took the
second to clinch the team
match with their fifth win of
the afternoon and extend
their match winning streak
to 63 straight.
The Cardinals split the oth
er two doubles matches with
Moulton and Burgin outlast
ing Linda Siegel and Kelly
Henry, 6-'., 3-6, 6-2, and Gayle
Chan and Alison Hardey los
ing to Paola Sessarego and
Anna Lucia Fernandez
(Anna Maria's twin) 6-3, 6-3.
The way the Cards came
out of the gate, it looked as
though one doubles victory
would be enough. Stanford's
number one, Alycia Moulton,
embarassed A.M. Fernandez
in the first set of their duel,
6-0, losing only ten points in
the process, and literally ov
erpowering her opponent
with a combination of pass
ing shots, good returns and
strong service.
After a letdown in the sec
ond set, losing 6-2, Moulton
came back and forged her
way to a 6-5 lead in the third,
breaking Fernandez in the
twelfth game tor the match.
At number two, Rubin
started out likewise, hitting
pinpoint winners and forcing
Troy's Kelly Henry into a lot
ot errors, sweeping to a 6-0
first set victory. Henry
turned the tables on Rubin in
the second, as she started to
connect and tied the match
with a 6-0 set of her own.
Henry dominated in the third
also, winning 6-2, to beat
Rubin for the third straight
time this season.
Against BYU on Saturday,
the Cards were the ones pull
ing out the close matches,
and as a result, ended up tak
ing five of six singles and the
match before the doubles
even began.
At number four against the
Wildcats, Stanford's
Copeland fell behind early
against the BYU's Susan

Pendo. getting broken twice
in digging herself a 5-2 de
fecit. After a conference
with interim assistant coach
Greg Hing, Copeland
stormed back to take seven
straight games, getting her
serve-and-volley together
for a 7-5, 6-3 win
At number six. Gayle Chan
responded to the call of duty
by coming off of the bench to
win for the second straight
day. Chan was beaten sound
ly by Tina Holding in the first
set 6-2, before bouncing back
to trounce her opponent in
the next two sets. 6-0. 6-2.
Moulton and Burgin won
big matches against BYU.
also, as they also picked up
two singles victories over the
weekend Moulton, after fall
ing behind 3-2 in both sets,
came on to beat Tracy Tan
ner at number one, 6-4, 6-3.
And Burgin. the treshman
torm Baltimore, galloped
over Lindley Tanner
(Tracy's sister) 6-0. 6-4.
"I was very pleased to
take it (the match) in sin
gles," said Brennan of his
team's performance against
BYU. "Sue (Rasmussen)
came back nicely today.
Alycia (Moulton) is playing
her best tennis ot the year,
and so is Elise < Burgin)."
The Cards are now 12-4 on
the year, with three losses
against the Trojans and one
against UCLA, Tuesday's
visitor to the Farm. The
Bruins boast a lot of depth all
down the line, and are ranked

third in the nation, behind
Stanford The UCLAns
soundly defeated Stanford
6-2 down in Los Angeles last
month, but the Cards also
own a 5-4 win over the
Bruins, at the NIKE Invita
tional Tournament in March
"They're playing very
good tennis right now.'' ap
praised Brennan of his
team s next opponent "They
are an extremely deep team,
and that might hurt us with
two of our starters out.
They're strong where we're
strong It's going to be tight
It'll probably go 5-4."
Brennan. who was fairly
pleased with the crowd turn
out from the weekend
matches, is hoping for simi
lar fan support Tuesday.
"There will be lots of action.
The fans are getting their
money's worth For a buck,
it's the best show in town."
Action at Stanford Tennis

Special to the first-year staffers issue
It is said the more things
change, the more they stay
the same.
Nothing could have been
truer in describing the re
sults of the Stanford wom
en's tennis team's matches
this weekend at Stanford
Tennis Stadium, as they lost
a heartbreaking 5-4 decision
to top-ranked USCN now 29-0)
Friday — reaffirming the
Trojans' claim to the No. 1
team in the nation — and took
apart fourth-ranked BYU
(now 8-2), 7-2 on Saturday —
reaffirming the Cardinals'
status as one of the top three
teams in women's collegiate
tennis. Indeed, the Cards
showed that they are one of
the two little engines that
could knock oft the Trojans
(along with UCLA) to end
their two-year dynasty in the
sport, but haven't so far.
But oh, how close Stanford
came, despite the tact that
they were sporting a re
vamped line-up because of
the absence ot two of their
top six players Susy Jaeger,
who usually plays in the
middle of the line-up, was out
because of sore feet, and
Michelle Weiss, who usually
plays at number six tor the
Cards, spent the weekend in
Cowell with pneumonia.
Stanford coach Frank
Brennan was pleased with
how his team responded de
spite the absence ot Weiss
and Jaeger. "I thought we
did pretty good," Brennan
said. "We certainly got their
attention, playing without
two of our starters and fin
ishing 5-4. Our problem is
that we're too streaky. We go
in good streaks, and then we
hit a bad streak. The dif
ference is, a good team
knows when to cut it off. We
don't do that."
The changes in this week
end's matches were most ap
parent in Stanford's doubles
line-up where Brennan split
up his usual number one
doubles team ot Caryn
Copeland and Alycia
Moulton, and moved
Jaeger's usual partner at No.
2, Elise Burgin up to the top
team with Moulton.
Copeland played at two,
along with Donna Rubin, her
last year's doubles partner
who normally sees action at
No. 3 with Weiss.
"It hurt us a bit psy
chologically when we saw
they had changed around
their line-up," admitted USC
coach Dave Borelli. "But I
really don't think it's going to
matter that much who plays
or where they play, as long as
we're playing well. I think
we could have played better,
however, and I think Stan
ford could have played bet
ter, also, but things kind of
fell our way. We were lucky
today, and I'm very happy to
come out with a win."
And well he should have
been as the match came
down to the wire as expected.
And the wire was plugged
into court two, where Rubin
and Copeland lost a hard
fought 7-6, 6-2 doubles match

to USC's Anna Maria
Fernandez and Nina Voydat
The Cardinal duo began by
streaking to a 5-0 lead in the
first set. breaking their oppo
nents' serve twice.
