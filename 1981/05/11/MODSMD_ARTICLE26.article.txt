# Davis has the 'potential to be one of the greatest'

When Scott Davis winds up for his
serve he gives the impression that he
hasn't quite grown into all those arms
and legs. He also has a tendency to tling
himself lengthwise across a court after a
ball, which would explain why he has lost
only one set in dual matches this year.
Freshman Davis, the newest in the
line of Stanford greats, has established
himself as one ot the tew people capable
ot upsetting Tim Mayotte in the NCAA
individual championship tournament.
His game is a little reminiscent of John
McEnroe's, with the same kind of wide
variety of shots, and the same disdain for
his opponent.
"Scott has the potential to be one of the
greatest players ever to play at Stan
ford," said tennis coach Dick Gould, at

the start of the season. "He's really that
good. He's worked hard on his serve and
volley game, and attacks you much like
McEnroe does. He can hit shots that
often can't be hit by other players.
He doesn't spend a whole lot of time
chatting with or even looking at his oppo
nent, and gets a certain set to his jaw
when things aren't going as well as he
would like them to, regardless of the usu
ally ridiculously one-sided score.
On the court he exhibits an economy of
motion that is particularly reminiscent
of McEnroe. He is slow to pick up a ball
after a court, and almost meanders back
to the service line.
He is not big on small talk in general,
for that matter. His manner off the court
is much like it is on, terse and to the
point; and, like McEnroe, he is bound to
invite some criticism because of that.

Some might even call him "cocky," as
USC's No. 2 singles player Roger Knapp
did after their match this weekend.
That wouldn't be surprising, consider
ing that he has spent most of his time
being No. 1 â€” twice in the national '6-
year-old division, twice in the 18-year
old. He won 24 junior national titles,
breaking the record of 20 set by pro Dick
Stockton. He was also the youngest
member of the 980 Davis Cup team.
From Santa Monica, Davis grew up a
die-hard USC Trojans fan. That might be
all over now. He and the Trojans didn't
get along so well this past weekend. No. 2
singles player Roger Knapp gave him a
difficult time Saturday afternoon, both
in play and in line disputes.
The two faced each other for the first
time two weeks ago in the Pacitic-'O In
dividual Championships at Ojai. Davis

blew past him two sets, 6-2, 6-0, so the
two didn't have a chance to get to know
each other. Saturday, a series ot line dis
putes turned the match into the
equivalent of a tennis brawl.
Knapp discussed Davis and the situ
ation only moments after the Trojans
won the overall match, but there was
still a hint of a pucker around his mouth.
"He's just cocky," said Knapp. "He's
going to have to get over that, or some
one is going to take the nose off his face."
Davis emerges as one of those players
who goes onto the court for one reason
only: to get oft as quickly as possible. He
has no patience with the smallest ot mis
takes, and a questionable call on the
most unimportant ot points is nothing to
be tolerated. That seems to spell "win
ner," rather than "cocky."
