Habib mission flounders in Syria
Damascus, Syria — American presidential envoy
Philip Habib ended marathon talks with Syrian of
ficials, including President Hatez Assad yesterday,
with no discernible break in the Lebanon missile
crisis that has brought Syria and Israel to the brink
of war
Neither Habib nor Syrian officials would com
ment on the substance ot the American special en
voy's three hour and forty-five minute conversation
with Assad yesterday or his earlier talks with Syrian
Foreign Ministry officials on Saturday. Habib cut
off questions afterward and would only characterize
the meetings with the diplomatic description ot a
"full exchange of views."
However, the hardline Syrian position was re
peated for the second straight day in an editorial in
the government newspaper Tishrin. Like an official
Damascus radio commentary the night before, it
made clear that there has been no change in Syria's
adamant refusal to bow to Israeli demands that Syr
ian SAM-6 missiles be removed from Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley, where Syrian-Israeli air clashes trig
gered the crisis 11 days ago.
The editorial repeated a familiar theme common
not only to Syria but to most of the Arab world that
U.S. policy in support ot Israel "throughout three
decades of conflict in the Middle East is part of the
problem, and that unless the U.S. alters that policy,
it cannot expect to become part of the solution
This theme was strengthened even as Habib and
Assad talked. N when Syria's Prime Minister Abdul
Rauf Kasm and Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas
emerged from a Cabinet meeting with further tough
remarks about "reinforcing the controntation with
the enemy" and counting on Soviet support through
the crisis, according to the official news agency
Sana
The Syrian message appeared to be directed at
pressuring Habib to convince Reagan that it is up to
Washington to restrain Israel and force some con
cessions from Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
Sinkhole swallows land in Florida
Winter Park, Fla. — A giant sinkhole slowly ex
panded and filled with water yesterday as officials
stood vigil over the land cave-in — already a yawn
ing crater that has swallowed a house and several
cars, wrecked a swimming pool and damaged sever
al buildings.
The sinkhole, which developed Friday night and
opened rapidly Saturday, was estimated yesterday
to be more than 1,000 feet in diameter and 170 feet
deep.
"It's still caving in around the edges. The geolo
gist said it would until the sides reach a 45-degree
angle," said Fire Capt. Janu ._ Whitaker. "It's fill
ing up with water and they say that's a good sign."
Earlier, the sinkhole gulped down a three
bedroom home, a camper, and six expensive foreign
cars on a car lot. It wrecked the city 's $150,000 mu

nicipal swimming pool and collapsed the back parts
of several commercial buildings There were no in
juries.
"It's still progressing," a police spokeswoman
said yesterday, adding that tive officers were at the
scene. "At last report, it had grown about 10 feet
trom last night," she said
Residents and owners ot nearby homes and busi
nesses were warned Saturday to leave until the sink
hole stopped growing. Some people rented trucks
and began moving turniture and other property.
Whitaker said no more buildings were in im
mediate danger of tailing victim to the sinkhole, and
that officials in this central Florida city of 22.000
were waiting for the situation to stabilize. City of
ficials said they probably would request federal dis
aster aid.
Sinkholes often result when underground water
tables are lowered and the ground above becomes
too weak to support itself.
Protesters rail Reagan budget
Demonstrators gathered in more than a half
dozen cities Saturday to protest proposed cuts in fed
eral spending on social welfare programs, urging
the Reagan administration to "help the needy, not
the greedy."
The rallies and marches in Pittsburgh. Cleveland,
Detroit, Boston, Kansas City, Kan., Charleston,
W.Va., Richmond. Va., and Mashalltown, lowa,
were aimed at drawing attention to budget pro
posals that cut deeply into social programs and
boost military spending.
As passed last Thursday by the House of Repesen
tatives. the 1982 budget, at $689 billion, is smaller
than President Reagan requested. It goes next to the
Senate, where passage is expected.
Haig made $1.2 million last year
Hartford, Conn. — In the 13 months previous to be
coming sectretary of state. Alexander Haig re
ceived $1.2'9.187 for his '3 months as president of
United Technologies Corporation, including an esti
mated $468,437 from stock options, the company's
records disclosed.
Documents of the large aerospace and defense
corporation, which is based here, also show that the
company had credited Haig with a total ot $3,3' 5,304
in compensation up to Dec. 31, 1980, much of it pay
able in UTC stock rights, and other forms ot com
pensation in future years, which he would have re
ceived had he stayed with the company.
When leaving UTC to become secretary of state —
a job that pays $69,630 per year — Haig surrendered
potential income estimated at $1,641,063 at the time
he resigned. Most ot that was in stock rights.
Haig. who was White House chief of staff in the
waning months of the Nixon administration and lat
er the supreme commander of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, was president of UTC trom
December 1979 to January 198", when he became

secretary of state
Nurses' strike continues in Ohio
Astabula, Ohio — 100 nurses who are on the na
tion's longest strike — 43 weeks — have voted to turn
down a '2 percent raise and vow to continue the
walkout until they win a union shop and get their old
jobs back.
"They did not give us job security, and that's
more important than money," said Debra
Bernardo, one of the strikers. "We went out togeth
er and we stayed together."
The nurses, who walked out from Ashtabula Gen
eral Hospital last July 21. voted 79-13 Saturday to re
ject a contract that would have raised base pay from
$7.25 per hour to $8. 0. Besides a salary increase,
their demands include a union shop, in which all
nurses would have to join the union. They also are
asking that their new contract include the code of
ethics, or written guideline of professional stan
dards, that has been dratted by the American
Nurses Association.

Habib mission flounders in Syria
Damascus, Syria — American presidential envoy
Philip Habib ended marathon talks with Syrian of
ficials, including President Hatez Assad yesterday,
with no discernible break in the Lebanon missile
crisis that has brought Syria and Israel to the brink
of war
Neither Habib nor Syrian officials would com
ment on the substance ot the American special en
voy's three hour and forty-five minute conversation
with Assad yesterday or his earlier talks with Syrian
Foreign Ministry officials on Saturday. Habib cut
off questions afterward and would only characterize
the meetings with the diplomatic description ot a
"full exchange of views."
However, the hardline Syrian position was re
peated for the second straight day in an editorial in
the government newspaper Tishrin. Like an official
Damascus radio commentary the night before, it
made clear that there has been no change in Syria's
adamant refusal to bow to Israeli demands that Syr
ian SAM-6 missiles be removed from Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley, where Syrian-Israeli air clashes trig
gered the crisis 11 days ago.
The editorial repeated a familiar theme common
not only to Syria but to most of the Arab world that
U.S. policy in support ot Israel "throughout three
decades of conflict in the Middle East is part of the
problem, and that unless the U.S. alters that policy,
it cannot expect to become part of the solution
This theme was strengthened even as Habib and
Assad talked. N when Syria's Prime Minister Abdul
Rauf Kasm and Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas
emerged from a Cabinet meeting with further tough
remarks about "reinforcing the controntation with
the enemy" and counting on Soviet support through
the crisis, according to the official news agency
Sana
The Syrian message appeared to be directed at
pressuring Habib to convince Reagan that it is up to
Washington to restrain Israel and force some con
cessions from Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
Sinkhole swallows land in Florida
Winter Park, Fla. — A giant sinkhole slowly ex
panded and filled with water yesterday as officials
stood vigil over the land cave-in — already a yawn
ing crater that has swallowed a house and several
cars, wrecked a swimming pool and damaged sever
al buildings.
The sinkhole, which developed Friday night and
opened rapidly Saturday, was estimated yesterday
to be more than 1,000 feet in diameter and 170 feet
deep.
"It's still caving in around the edges. The geolo
gist said it would until the sides reach a 45-degree
angle," said Fire Capt. Janu ._ Whitaker. "It's fill
ing up with water and they say that's a good sign."
Earlier, the sinkhole gulped down a three
bedroom home, a camper, and six expensive foreign
cars on a car lot. It wrecked the city 's $150,000 mu

nicipal swimming pool and collapsed the back parts
of several commercial buildings There were no in
juries.
"It's still progressing," a police spokeswoman
said yesterday, adding that tive officers were at the
scene. "At last report, it had grown about 10 feet
trom last night," she said
Residents and owners ot nearby homes and busi
nesses were warned Saturday to leave until the sink
hole stopped growing. Some people rented trucks
and began moving turniture and other property.
Whitaker said no more buildings were in im
mediate danger of tailing victim to the sinkhole, and
that officials in this central Florida city of 22.000
were waiting for the situation to stabilize. City of
ficials said they probably would request federal dis
aster aid.
Sinkholes often result when underground water
tables are lowered and the ground above becomes
too weak to support itself.
Protesters rail Reagan budget
Demonstrators gathered in more than a half
dozen cities Saturday to protest proposed cuts in fed
eral spending on social welfare programs, urging
the Reagan administration to "help the needy, not
the greedy."
The rallies and marches in Pittsburgh. Cleveland,
Detroit, Boston, Kansas City, Kan., Charleston,
W.Va., Richmond. Va., and Mashalltown, lowa,
were aimed at drawing attention to budget pro
posals that cut deeply into social programs and
boost military spending.
As passed last Thursday by the House of Repesen
tatives. the 1982 budget, at $689 billion, is smaller
than President Reagan requested. It goes next to the
Senate, where passage is expected.

in compensation up to Dec. 31, 1980, much of it pay
able in UTC stock rights, and other forms ot com
pensation in future years, which he would have re
ceived had he stayed with the company.
