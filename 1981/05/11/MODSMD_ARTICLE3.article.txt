# Cuts endanger quality education
## 
### Louise Solomon 
Faced with federal budget cuts, de
mands for salary increases, double
digit inflation and rapidly escalating
utility costs, the Stanford adminis
trators must decide how to fund the
University's commitment to quality
education.
The University could ease its finan
cial pressures by increasing the ratios
of students to faculty members, of fac
ulty members to administrative and
clerical staff, and of para-faculty to
regular faculty members, said Wil
liam Massy, vice president for busi
ness and finance. He added that al
though these strategies may be attrac
tive in the short run, they do not solve
the fundamental economic problems.
According to Kent Peterson, as
sociate vice-president for business
and finance, admitting more students
without increasing the size ot the fac
ulty was ruled out in the 1970s during
an intensive period of budget review.
The lower birth rate in the 1960s re
duced the number of this decade's pos
sible applicants, and, to ensure the
quality of the student body, the Uni
versity decided against admitting

more students, said Peterson.
Peterson said that most cuts made
in the late 60s and early 70s were ad
ministrative rather than academic.
Because these cuts were made, the
University no longer has much fat to
trim, said Ray Bacchetti, vice provost
ot management and budget."The
time will tome when the fat is gone
and the cuts will be made into the mus
cle and bone, or when the time
\ purchased by one-shot measures has
been exhausted," said Massy.
Cuts made so far have not curtailed
academic expansion but have slowed
its growth rate, agreed both Peterson
and Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost
and dean of undergraduate studies.
Peterson said the University might
meet financial demands by increasing
tuition costs and through increased
fund-raising. General tuition is in
creasing 13.6 percent in 1981-82 and is
expected to rise at least that much in
1982-83. And because of the unpromis
ing national economic outlook, the
University will be looking toward the
private sector rather than toward the
government for funding, said Peter
son.

Seventy to eighty percent of the Uni
versity's expenditures are devoted to
faculty and staff salaries, and to a
large degree the pay-scale is de
termined by outside influences, ac
cording to Peterson. The salary scale
is set to the mid-market level of com
peting schools and also influenced by
private industry salaries, he said
Peterson said, "The industries
tend to set salaries in terms of prod
uctivity. What Stanford does in scien
tific and technical research tends to
increase the productivity of private
corporations and thus their staff
salaries go up. In turn, the salaries of
our faculty and staff must reflect that
increase. But since we don't get a
share of the increased profits, we have
to scramble around trying to fill the
deficiency."
The Reagan budget cuts will be a
source of added pressure on the gener
al funds, said Lieberman. Programs
such as social science research, stu
dent financial aid, and the National
Science Federal fellowship program,
affected by federal cuts, will be look
ing toward the University to continue
their funding, said Lieberman.
Lieberman said that cuts in reseach
can be expected unless the slack can
be picked up in funding from private
corporations. However, he warned
that this new source of income may
also be a new source of problems:
"We understand the terms and our
position with the government, but

dealing with research is a new game.
We have to be careful that our stan
dards aren't compromised," he
warned.
Stanford values its financial aid pro
gram highly, said Bacchetti: "The
University has a very strong commit
ment to keep this institution ac
cessible to students of various eco
nomic backgrounds."

quality of the student body, the Uni
versity decided against admitting

more students, said Peterson.
Peterson said that most cuts made
in the late 60s and early 70s were ad
ministrative rather than academic.
Because these cuts were made, the
University no longer has much fat to
trim, said Ray Bacchetti, vice provost
ot management and budget."The
time will tome when the fat is gone
and the cuts will be made into the mus
cle and bone, or when the time
\ purchased by one-shot measures has
been exhausted," said Massy.
Cuts made so far have not curtailed
academic expansion but have slowed
its growth rate, agreed both Peterson
and Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost
and dean of undergraduate studies.
Peterson said the University might
meet financial demands by increasing
tuition costs and through increased
fund-raising. General tuition is in
creasing 13.6 percent in 1981-82 and is
expected to rise at least that much in
1982-83. And because of the unpromis
ing national economic outlook, the
University will be looking toward the
private sector rather than toward the
government for funding, said Peter
son.

Seventy to eighty percent of the Uni
versity's expenditures are devoted to
faculty and staff salaries, and to a
large degree the pay-scale is de
termined by outside influences, ac
cording to Peterson. The salary scale
is set to the mid-market level of com
peting schools and also influenced by
private industry salaries, he said
Peterson said, "The industries
tend to set salaries in terms of prod
uctivity. What Stanford does in scien
tific and technical research tends to
increase the productivity of private
corporations and thus their staff
salaries go up. In turn, the salaries of
our faculty and staff must reflect that
increase. But since we don't get a
share of the increased profits, we have
to scramble around trying to fill the
deficiency."
The Reagan budget cuts will be a
source of added pressure on the gener
al funds, said Lieberman. Programs
such as social science research, stu
dent financial aid, and the National
Science Federal fellowship program,
affected by federal cuts, will be look
ing toward the University to continue
their funding, said Lieberman.
Lieberman said that cuts in reseach
can be expected unless the slack can
be picked up in funding from private
corporations. However, he warned
that this new source of income may
also be a new source of problems:
"We understand the terms and our
position with the government, but

dealing with research is a new game.
We have to be careful that our stan
dards aren't compromised," he
warned.
Stanford values its financial aid pro
gram highly, said Bacchetti: "The
University has a very strong commit
ment to keep this institution ac
cessible to students of various eco
nomic backgrounds."
