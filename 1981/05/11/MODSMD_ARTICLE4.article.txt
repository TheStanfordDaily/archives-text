# Mitterrand takes French vote

From the Daily wire services and cub staff writer
Paris — Socialist Francois Mitter
rand — combining Communist support
with votes from moderates tired of in
cumbent Valery Giscard d'Estaing —
ended an era ot center-right govern
ment in France and won a seven-year
term as president.
In a statement Sunday night at
Chateau Chinon, Mitterrand said his
triumph meant the country had ac
cepted the changes he proposed — job
creation programs, nationalization ot
several large industries and higher
corporate taxes — and said he had "no
other ambition than to justify the con
fidence" of the French people.
Early today, with almost 98 percent
of the votes counted, Mitterrand had
15,639,673 or 52.06 percent and Giscard
d'Estaing had 4,396,439 or 47.93 per
cent.
Mitterrand's victory opened the
way tor legislative elections he has
pledged to call within two months to

seek a parliamentary majority in ac
cord with his Socialist principles. If
his victory in the presidential election
is backed up in the legislative voting,
it will upset the delicate balance be
tween conservative and Socialist-ori
ented governments within Western
Europe's 10-nation Common Market.
If it is rejected — bringing back a ma
jority hostile to his program — the
stage will be set tor a severe test of the
Fifth Republic institutions tailor
made for the unusual dimensions of
Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1958.
A leftist on the record tor na
tionalization ot key French private in
dustries, Mitterrand nevertheless is a
firm supporter of Western defense ef
forts and favors an even firmer stand
against the Soviet Union than Giscard,
who has been accused by many mod
erates of being too accommodating to
Moscow.

Mitterrand waged a low-profile
campaign designed to reassure voters
that there would be no social up
heavals under his rule. He apparently
managed to persuade the voters that
his program ot nationalizing 1* in
dustries — including insurance, arma
ments, pharmaceuticals and
chemicals — is moderate in a country
where a large part ot industry was na
tionalized after World War 11.
Mitterrand's victory was a major
personal vindication for the 64-year

old veteran politician, who was run
ning for president for the third and
clearly final time. His first attempt
was in 1965 against de Gaulle, a na
tional hero and then the incumbent
president.
The prestigious Champs Elvsees
was the scene of wild celebrations,
with cars full of youths speeding up
and down the broad avenue honking
their horns. Groups ot youths chanted.
"Giscard into the closet."
David Combs, a junior physics ma
jor, described the general reaction of
the French House as "surprise" after
the election last night. "I returned
from France just a month ago. While I
was there, it seemed that Giscard d
Estaing was going to win hands down.
