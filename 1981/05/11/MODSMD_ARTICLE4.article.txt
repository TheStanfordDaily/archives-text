# Mitterrand takes French vote
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services and cub staff writer
Paris — Socialist Francois Mitter
rand — combining Communist support
with votes from moderates tired of in
cumbent Valery Giscard d'Estaing —
ended an era ot center-right govern
ment in France and won a seven-year
term as president.
In a statement Sunday night at
Chateau Chinon, Mitterrand said his
triumph meant the country had ac
cepted the changes he proposed — job
creation programs, nationalization ot
several large industries and higher
corporate taxes — and said he had "no
other ambition than to justify the con
fidence" of the French people.
Early today, with almost 98 percent
of the votes counted, Mitterrand had
15,639,673 or 52.06 percent and Giscard
d'Estaing had 4,396,439 or 47.93 per
cent.
Mitterrand's victory opened the
way tor legislative elections he has
pledged to call within two months to

seek a parliamentary majority in ac
cord with his Socialist principles. If
his victory in the presidential election
is backed up in the legislative voting,
it will upset the delicate balance be
tween conservative and Socialist-ori
ented governments within Western
Europe's 10-nation Common Market.
If it is rejected — bringing back a ma
jority hostile to his program — the
stage will be set tor a severe test of the
Fifth Republic institutions tailor
made for the unusual dimensions of
Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1958.
A leftist on the record tor na
tionalization ot key French private in
dustries, Mitterrand nevertheless is a
firm supporter of Western defense ef
forts and favors an even firmer stand
against the Soviet Union than Giscard,
who has been accused by many mod
erates of being too accommodating to
Moscow.

Mitterrand waged a low-profile
campaign designed to reassure voters
that there would be no social up
heavals under his rule. He apparently
managed to persuade the voters that
his program ot nationalizing 1* in
dustries — including insurance, arma
ments, pharmaceuticals and
chemicals — is moderate in a country
where a large part ot industry was na
tionalized after World War 11.
Mitterrand's victory was a major
personal vindication for the 64-year

old veteran politician, who was run
ning for president for the third and
clearly final time. His first attempt
was in 1965 against de Gaulle, a na
tional hero and then the incumbent
president.
The prestigious Champs Elvsees
was the scene of wild celebrations,
with cars full of youths speeding up
and down the broad avenue honking
their horns. Groups ot youths chanted.
"Giscard into the closet."
David Combs, a junior physics ma
jor, described the general reaction of
the French House as "surprise" after
the election last night. "I returned
from France just a month ago. While I
was there, it seemed that Giscard d
Estaing was going to win hands down.

Combs thought the parliamentary
majority Mitterrand hopes for will be
the key to implementing his pro
grams He added, "It's also interest
ing that in England, they've elected
Thatcher who's about as anti-Socialist
as you can get. I wonder it they chose
Mitterrand after seeing how painful
Thatcher's solution to the economic
problem has been."

moderate
Election jockeying
Jockeying began immediately for
the national legislative elections that
Mitterrand will have the power to pre
cipitate by dissolving the National As
sembly two years before the end ot its
present mandate as soon as he takes

otfice at the end of this month
Mitterrand has indicated the elec
tions will take place in the latter half
ot June.
Giscard conceded by telegram a
few minutes after the polls closed,
saying, "I will, of course, continue to
defend the essential interests of our
country."
As a former president, Giscard is
barred from seeking a parliamentary
seat. He is automatically a member
for life of the Constitutional Council
that passes on the constitutionality of
laws.
In his reply to Giscard. Mitterrand
said, "I address my best wishes to the
man who led France tor seven years.
Beyond the political struggles and our
disagreements it is now for history to
judge each of our acts."

Early today, with almost 98 percent
of the votes counted, Mitterrand had
15,639,673 or 52.06 percent and Giscard
d'Estaing had 4,396,439 or 47.93 per
cent.
Mitterrand's victory opened the
way tor legislative elections he has
pledged to call within two months to

seek a parliamentary majority in ac
cord with his Socialist principles. If
his victory in the presidential election
is backed up in the legislative voting,
it will upset the delicate balance be
tween conservative and Socialist-ori
ented governments within Western
Europe's 10-nation Common Market.
If it is rejected — bringing back a ma
jority hostile to his program — the
stage will be set tor a severe test of the
Fifth Republic institutions tailor
made for the unusual dimensions of
Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1958.
A leftist on the record tor na
tionalization ot key French private in
dustries, Mitterrand nevertheless is a
firm supporter of Western defense ef
forts and favors an even firmer stand
against the Soviet Union than Giscard,
who has been accused by many mod
erates of being too accommodating to
Moscow.

Mitterrand waged a low-profile
campaign designed to reassure voters
that there would be no social up
heavals under his rule. He apparently
managed to persuade the voters that
his program ot nationalizing 1* in
dustries — including insurance, arma
ments, pharmaceuticals and
chemicals — is moderate in a country
where a large part ot industry was na
tionalized after World War 11.
Mitterrand's victory was a major
personal vindication for the 64-year

old veteran politician, who was run
ning for president for the third and
clearly final time. His first attempt
was in 1965 against de Gaulle, a na
tional hero and then the incumbent
president.
The prestigious Champs Elvsees
was the scene of wild celebrations,
with cars full of youths speeding up
and down the broad avenue honking
their horns. Groups ot youths chanted.
"Giscard into the closet."
David Combs, a junior physics ma

the French House as "surprise" after
the election last night. "I returned

From the Daily wire services and cub staff writer
Paris — Socialist Francois Mitter
rand — combining Communist support
with votes from moderates tired of in
cumbent Valery Giscard d'Estaing —
ended an era ot center-right govern
ment in France and won a seven-year
term as president.
In a statement Sunday night at
Chateau Chinon, Mitterrand said his
triumph meant the country had ac
cepted the changes he proposed — job
creation programs, nationalization ot
several large industries and higher
corporate taxes — and said he had "no
other ambition than to justify the con
fidence" of the French people.
Early today, with almost 98 percent
of the votes counted, Mitterrand had
15,639,673 or 52.06 percent and Giscard
d'Estaing had 4,396,439 or 47.93 per
