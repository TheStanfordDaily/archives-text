### Eric Cornell 
Over two hundred protesters, including a hundred
medical students, marched Friday to protest budget
cuts in health-related programs.
The demonstrators, some wearing white lab
coats, marched trom the medical school to a rally by
the Old Union. A poster with the message "We need
MDs, not MXs" underscored the rally's theme.
Dr. Count Gibson, chairman of the Department ot
Family, Community and Preventive Medicine
warned of the consequences to low-income families
of cutting aid to local health programs.
"The Public Health Center in San Francisco will
have to close by December," Gibson said. "In the
neighborhood it serves, there are many people who
have no way to atford a doctor."
Gibson continued , "We always hear about the
government 'safety net'. The thing is, the people
holding the safety net decide who to catch and who to
let slip through."
According to Arturo Molina, president of the Stan
ford Medical Student Association, President Ronald

Reagan's budget will close eight Public Health Ser
vice Hospitals and 29 clinics.
Reagan's budget will consolidate approximately
40 health and social service programs, Molina said.
He explained that funding for these programs will be
cut 25 percent. At the current rate of inflation, that
translates to a 40 percent cut in real dollars.
The consolidated programs facing cuts include:
— Community Health Centers.
— Child health programs.
— Black lung research.
— Sudden Infant Death research.
— Rat contol.
— Fluoridation.
— Drug abuse and alcoholism programs.
In addition to reducing funding for these pro
grams, the new budget consolidates the funding into
a single grant to the state government. The individ
ual state governments will now have the responsi
bility tor administering the various programs.
Gibson called for a letter writing campaign to the
state legislature to preserve health and social pro

grams in California, particularly the low-income
and minority programs.
"The cuts affect mostly citizens living at or below
poverty levels," Molina said.
Andre Burnett, minority education lobbyist and
ASSU guest professor, spoke against another aspect
of Reagan's budget — drastic reductions in health
student loans. With new student loans available only
at rates above the'prime rate, meaning as high as 19
percent, low- and middle-income and minority stu
dents may be unable to pursue medical professions
According to Molina, at least half of the medical
student body attended the rally. Molinr
aknowledged the incongruity of med school student
marching in a rally.
"It's so frustrating. Medical students have no out
let for expression. I think the rally was thera
peutic," he said.
Friday's rally was one of several that went on na
tionwide in recognition of National Day of Concei
for Student Health.
