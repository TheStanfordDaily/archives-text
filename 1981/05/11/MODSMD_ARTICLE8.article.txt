# Trailers will not close before 1990

"There is nothing so permanent as 'tem
porary' housing." This is the motto Man
zanita residents used tor their T-shirt this
year..
The Manzanita Trailer Park, which
houses over 450 undergraduates, was ori
ginally planned in 1970 to last four years at
most, according to Director Jan Van
Houten. "We never expected them to be
here for 1 years. Now we are looking to
close the trailers in 1990."
However, by 1984. undergraduates will
probably have the chance to move out of
Manzanita because of the new dorm com
plex planned by the University. The new
dorms will open 800 spaces in the housing
system.
As undergrads move out. Residential
Education at Stanford is considering turn
ing Manzanita into graduate housing. "Man
zanita would be wonderful for graduates."
Van Houten said, "because of the cooking
facilities." Also, Stanford is grossly defi
cient in graduate housing, she said. About '8
percent of graduates get on-campus hous
ing.
However, many trailer residents say un
dergraduates should have access to Man
zanita even after the new dorm complex
opens, according to Van Houten. "A lot of
people who come here want to be here." she
said.
Almost 75 percent of trailer residents
listed Manzanita as their first or second
preference in (he draw, according to a sur
vey Van Houten conducted last year. And
among the students who listed Manzanita as
a lower preference, "most people are pleas
antly surprised." she said.
Residents themselves have varied opin
ions of the trailers. "I'm glad we got in

here." said sophomore Geoft Sears. "It's
kind of like having your own apartment on
campus," he said. He mentioned another
advantage of living in a trailer: "In the
spring you can lie out on the roof naked,
even though you're not supposed to."
Other advantages they find in the trailers
include having a lounge, a dining room and a
kitchen.
However, they agreed there are many
disadvantages to living in a trailer. "It's
nice to have some privacy." Treisman said,
"but privacy within a trailer is a laugh. The
walls are paper-thin."

"It's nice to have some
privacy, but privacy

laugh. The ivalls are
paper thin."

Another problem Manzanita residents
find is meeting people. "I loved my
freshman dorm," said sophomore Susan
Zaroff. "and I miss having a group of people
right there. We don't even know our neigh
bors in the next cluster."
The biggest problem Van Houten sees is
trailermates that do not get along well with
each other. Trailermates are "the single
most important determinant of whether you
have a good year in the trailers." she said.
"If you do have bad trailermates, it's mi

serable."
To avoid mismatching trailermates.
Manzanita holds an independent draw. In
that draw, residents list their preferences
for trailermates and for friends they would
like to be nearby. Last year, Manzanita was
able to accomodate 95 percent of the re
quests. according to Van Houten.
When mismatches occur, "we make ev
ery effort to move people," Van Houten
said. The Resident Advisors often help ar
range inter-trailer moves, she said.
Residents agreed the worst problem
would be trailermates who did not get along.
"I could see how it could work out terribly,"
said junior Bonnie Messenger, who drew
into Manzanita alone. "I was sure I was
going to end up with three drug-outs, but it's
really worked out great."
Another drawback with the trailers is
their shabby physical appearance, accord
ing to Van Houten. "I don't like the dents
and the discoloration on the outside," she
said, "but when students see the inside they
often say 'this isn't so bad.' "
Another physical problem with the
trailers is that they are somewhat of a fire
hazard, according to Van Houten. "They are
as dangerous as all mobile homes are," she
said. Last year a trailer burned down in less
then ten minutes. Because of the hazard.
each trailer has a fire extinguisher and a
smoke alarm, which are checked at least
once a quarter. In case of fire," said
Treisman, jokingly "one of my friends told
me the quickest way out is to run through
the wall."
Despite the physical drawbacks, many
Manzanita residents find they like the life
style. Sophomore Becky Rolfe said "the
trailers are the worst place physically, but
I've had the most fun."
