# Dedicated rowers build crew team

### Kathy Bodovitz 
They're up at 5:00 a m. six
days a week, on the water by
6 00 and rowing until about 8:00
This is" how the members of the
Stanford Crew Team start their
day.
Once everyone is out of bed,
the team members carpool to
Redwood City Harbor where
they practice. Usually, the team
returns to campus about 8:15, in
time, as men's varsity oarsman
Willie Seavey said, to "wolt
down breakfast, jump in the
shower and ride to class. "
While everyone makes it to
practice on time, getting up at
5:00 is easier for some than tor
others. Seavey said, "Usually
the guys on the team have to
wake me up " And Jan Boyer,
captain of the freshman boat,
said. "They've literally
dragged me out of bed several
times." Even the coach is not
immune. Men's coach Bob Whit
ford said, "One guy calls me ev
ery morning to make sure I'm
up."
Men's crew at Stanford dates
back to 1902, but women's crew
is only in its tilth year. The
men's team races ope varsity,
one junior varsity and one
freshman boat, and the women

have one varsity and two novice
boats.
For both men and women,
this year has been one of re
building Whittord, describing
his first year coaching at Stan
ford. said, "The purpose of this
year was to let other schools
know Stanford exists again."
With only 12 returning rowers
this year, the men's team has
just one varsity boat, in addi
tion. to the junior varsity and
freshman boats.
Whittord said, "We have
made a lot of headway this year.
We're in the race again and peo
ple know it."
Stanford competes against
the Pac-'O schools (actually
Pac-8 because neither Arizona
school has a crew team) plus
other state and private schools
on the West coast.
The men's varsity has won
three meets and lost tive this
season. According to Whittord.
"We've been in every race ex
cept UCLA." But UCLA, along
with Washington and Cal (the
national champion last year)
are the top three teams in the
Pac-10 this year.
The women's team has,under
gone a similar season ot im
provement. Women's varsity
rower Margi Fetter said, "Our
coach (John Davis) is amazing,
really good. In two years he's
developed a horrendous team
into a national caliber team."
The women's varsity has only
been defeated once and is
seeded third for the Pac-10 meet
coming up this weekend here at

Stanford's course.
The high caliber of Stanford's
crew teams is especially im
pressive because crew here is a
club sport, not a varsity sport as
it is at almost all ot the other
Pac- 0 schools.
Thi§ means that tunding
comes mainly from alumni
donations. Stanford Club Sports
and an annual row-a-thon also
contribute. And Whitford said
he is grateful for the support
crew receives from the athletic
department.
But its club sport standing,
and thus lower budget than most
of its competitors, presents
some problems for the Stanford
team. Fetter said the women's
varsity is afraid of losing their
coach to a school that could of
fer him a higher salary.
And the coaches are not the
only expense. Crew is a very ex
pensive sport to begin with.
Each boat costs from $6000 to
$12,000, and each oar -- there are
eight per boat - costs $200.
Crew requires not only ex
treme dedication because of the
practice time, but excellent
physical condition as well. Get
ting up at 5:00 a.m. is only the
beginning. In addition to two
hour workouts on the water six
days a week, the men run to the
dish on Mondays and Fridays,
weightlift Tuesdays and
Thursdays, and run stadiums
Wednesday afternoons.
The race itself (the men's
course is 1.25 miles and the
women's is shorter) is another
test of endurance. Marty John

son. men s varsity, said, "I've
never been in a race where it
feels so good to win and feels so
bad to lose When you lose, you
give your opponent your shirt
It's really humiliating to have to
walk up and hand a guy your
shirt."
The real test of the team
members' physical endurance
came during Spring Break. The
team stayed at school and prac
ticed all week. According to
women's novice Angle Vickers,
"It's nicknamed hell week.' We
worked out two or three times
every day. About all we did was
row, eat and sleep. "
But the strenuous workout did
have its rewards. Vickers said.
"It's amazing to learn what
your body can do. It was hard,
but everyone was doing it to
gether. If they could stick it out,
I could too."
Aside from pushing their
physical endurance to the limit,
spring break helped unity the
men's and women's teams. The
two groups share a special com
raderie created in part by the
nature of crew. Boyer said,
"The eight men in the boat have
to move and think together. It
takes eight bodies moving to
gether. It's hard to achieve, but
it brings people close together."
Along with total dedication,
perseverence and camaraderie,
the crew team shares a sense of
optimism. Boyer said, "If we
believe hard enough that we can
win,then we can. We can beat
anybody."

The women's varsity has only
been defeated once and is
seeded third for the Pac-10 meet
coming up this weekend here at

Stanford's course.
The high caliber of Stanford's
crew teams is especially im
pressive because crew here is a
club sport, not a varsity sport as
it is at almost all ot the other
Pac- 0 schools.
Thi§ means that tunding
comes mainly from alumni
donations. Stanford Club Sports
and an annual row-a-thon also
contribute. And Whitford said
he is grateful for the support
crew receives from the athletic
department.
But its club sport standing,
and thus lower budget than most
of its competitors, presents
some problems for the Stanford
team. Fetter said the women's
varsity is afraid of losing their
coach to a school that could of
fer him a higher salary.
And the coaches are not the
only expense. Crew is a very ex
pensive sport to begin with.
Each boat costs from $6000 to
$12,000, and each oar -- there are
eight per boat - costs $200.
Crew requires not only ex
treme dedication because of the
practice time, but excellent
physical condition as well. Get
ting up at 5:00 a.m. is only the
beginning. In addition to two
hour workouts on the water six
days a week, the men run to the
dish on Mondays and Fridays,
weightlift Tuesdays and
Thursdays, and run stadiums
Wednesday afternoons.
The race itself (the men's
course is 1.25 miles and the
women's is shorter) is another
test of endurance. Marty John

son. men s varsity, said, "I've
never been in a race where it
feels so good to win and feels so
bad to lose When you lose, you
give your opponent your shirt
It's really humiliating to have to
walk up and hand a guy your
shirt."
The real test of the team
members' physical endurance
came during Spring Break. The
team stayed at school and prac
ticed all week. According to
women's novice Angle Vickers,
"It's nicknamed hell week.' We
worked out two or three times
every day. About all we did was
row, eat and sleep. "
But the strenuous workout did
have its rewards. Vickers said.
"It's amazing to learn what
your body can do. It was hard,
but everyone was doing it to
gether. If they could stick it out,
I could too."
Aside from pushing their
physical endurance to the limit,
spring break helped unity the
men's and women's teams. The
two groups share a special com
raderie created in part by the
nature of crew. Boyer said,
"The eight men in the boat have
to move and think together. It
takes eight bodies moving to
gether. It's hard to achieve, but
it brings people close together."
Along with total dedication,
perseverence and camaraderie,
the crew team shares a sense of
optimism. Boyer said, "If we
believe hard enough that we can
win,then we can. We can beat
anybody."
They're up at 5:00 a m. six
days a week, on the water by
6 00 and rowing until about 8:00
This is" how the members of the
Stanford Crew Team start their
day.
Once everyone is out of bed,
the team members carpool to
Redwood City Harbor where
they practice. Usually, the team
returns to campus about 8:15, in
time, as men's varsity oarsman
Willie Seavey said, to "wolt
down breakfast, jump in the
shower and ride to class. "
While everyone makes it to
practice on time, getting up at
5:00 is easier for some than tor
others. Seavey said, "Usually
the guys on the team have to
wake me up " And Jan Boyer,
captain of the freshman boat,
said. "They've literally
dragged me out of bed several
times." Even the coach is not
immune. Men's coach Bob Whit
ford said, "One guy calls me ev
ery morning to make sure I'm
up."
Men's crew at Stanford dates
back to 1902, but women's crew
is only in its tilth year. The
men's team races ope varsity,
one junior varsity and one
freshman boat, and the women

have one varsity and two novice
boats.
For both men and women,
this year has been one of re
building Whittord, describing
his first year coaching at Stan
ford. said, "The purpose of this
year was to let other schools
know Stanford exists again."
With only 12 returning rowers
this year, the men's team has
just one varsity boat, in addi
tion. to the junior varsity and
freshman boats.
Whittord said, "We have
made a lot of headway this year.
We're in the race again and peo
ple know it."
Stanford competes against
the Pac-'O schools (actually
Pac-8 because neither Arizona
school has a crew team) plus
other state and private schools
on the West coast.
The men's varsity has won
three meets and lost tive this
season. According to Whittord.
"We've been in every race ex
cept UCLA." But UCLA, along
with Washington and Cal (the
national champion last year)
are the top three teams in the
Pac-10 this year.
The women's team has,under
gone a similar season ot im
provement. Women's varsity
rower Margi Fetter said, "Our
coach (John Davis) is amazing,
really good. In two years he's
developed a horrendous team
into a national caliber team."
The women's varsity has only
been defeated once and is
seeded third for the Pac-10 meet
