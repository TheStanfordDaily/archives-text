Three Part Harmony
The Diamond Trio
Gleim Jewelers has specialized in fine engagement rings
for 50 years. This very special diamond trio
is one of Glenn's exclusive creations. It features a lovely
diamond with hand-crafted hand, plus two ring guards.
Wear them three different ways—the ring guards, the
ring, or all three together. A most engaging idea from
Gleim's. For those moments to remember,
remember Gleim jewelers.
