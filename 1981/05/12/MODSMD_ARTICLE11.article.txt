# Women in design — creating alternatives

Dolores Hayden Associate
Professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles,
argues that the American
drearrt home is at the center of
women's problems today, and
maintains that it is our culture's
attempt to extend the Victorian
patriarchal home into the twen
tieth century.
Hayden gave a talk last
Thursday night in the Forum
Room of Meyer Library entitled
"A Grand Domestic Revolu
tion: A History of Feminist De
sign for American Homes,
Neighborhoods and Cities."
She admits that the idea of
home ownership is the Ameri
can Dream, and that to attack
this symbol of success often pro
vokes heated responses from
listeners.
The lecture, the first in a
series of four sponsored by the
Urban Studies Program at Stan
ford and grouped under the um
brella heading "Women in
Cities," was attended by an en
thusiastic group of about 40 peo
ple.
Contrary to popular beliefs,
however, Hayden's idea that the
American home is the source of
a lot of women's problems is not
an idea that came into being in
the 1980 s. Women as far back as
the 1860 s were thinking of alter

nate approaches to the tradi
tional home
According to Hayden. there
had been a major feminist cam
paign in architecture and urban
planning in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth century that
was an integral part of the
feminist movement. She calls
this part of the movement'' the
lost feminine alternative" and
the women who participated in
it "material feminists."

The first American feminists
to organize around domestic
work as a feminist issue aimed
to overcome the split between
domestic life and public life.
They wanted to remove house
work and childcare from the
private home and place it in a
communal setting where, in
stead of the women as individ-

uals being responsible for it.the
community as a whole would be
Many of their ideas came
from the communitarian social
ism movement that was going
on in Europe at the time, headed
by people like Owen in England
and Fournier in France
Hayden divides the history of
this feminist struggle into two
stages. The first stage was pri
marily concerned with the role
of the housewife and the second
stage dealt mainly with the

problems of employed women
The pioneer of the first stage
of the struggle was a woman
called Melocina Peirce, a mem
ber of the elite society ot Cam
bridge, Massachusetts. In 868
she persuaded many of the
women in the town to form the
Cambridge Cooperative House
keepers Society. These women
came together and rented a
building where they performed
all their cooking, sewing and
ironing and then sent the fin
ished products to their homes
where their husbands had to pay
cash on delivery. The experi
ment lasted about ten years.
It was from Melocina Peirce
that we first hear about the idea
of kitchenless houses, an idea
that was to run through the rest
ot the movement. Peirce be

enless houses formed into
blocks around a cooperative
housekeeping center.
Marie Howland, a feminist in
Vineland, New Jersey, took the
idea a step further in the 1870's.
She got together with an
architect and actually designed
a whole city based on the kitch
enless house idea. Needless to
say, the city was never built.
Mary Livermore, an activist
in the suffrage movement from
the 1870 s to the 1890 s, felt that
a better idea would be a con
sumers' cooperative, instead of
the producers' cooperative pre
viously outlined. In a con
sumers' cooperative there

would be a neighborhood dining
club where all the families could
eat at relatively cheap prices
This experiment was carried
out in a few communities.
The second stage of the move
ment started with Elizabeth
Swallow Richards, who was the
first woman to graduate from
MIT She was the founder of the
iield of home economics, an
idea which she conceived of as
an applied science to educate
people in nutrition and sani
tation in the kitchen
She was primarily concerned
with women living in tenements
who had to work and who would
never be able to produce
nutritious and sanitary food in
that environment She decided
that America needed public
kitchens which would provide
excellent and nutritious tood at
low prices for these women.
This idea was taken up by Jane
Addams at Hull House, where it
worked quite successfully.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a
leading intellectual feminist at
the turn of the century, came up
with the novel idea of a feminist
apartment hotel for employed
women, which would provide 24-
hours-a-dav childcare, so that
women could lead a fuller life.
Hayden ended her lecture
about the material feminists
with the words, "these women
dared to dream about trans
forming everyday life." With 50
percent ot women with children
under the age of six in the paid
labor force today, the trans
formation is still going on.
Ms. Hayden, who obtained
her masters degree in architec

American Utopias," and the

The first American feminists
to organize around domestic
work as a feminist issue aimed
to overcome the split between
domestic life and public life.
They wanted to remove house
work and childcare from the
private home and place it in a
communal setting where, in
stead of the women as individ-

uals being responsible for it.the
community as a whole would be
Many of their ideas came
from the communitarian social
ism movement that was going
on in Europe at the time, headed
by people like Owen in England
and Fournier in France
Hayden divides the history of
this feminist struggle into two
stages. The first stage was pri
marily concerned with the role
of the housewife and the second
stage dealt mainly with the

problems of employed women
The pioneer of the first stage
of the struggle was a woman
called Melocina Peirce, a mem
ber of the elite society ot Cam
bridge, Massachusetts. In 868
she persuaded many of the
women in the town to form the
Cambridge Cooperative House
keepers Society. These women
came together and rented a
building where they performed
all their cooking, sewing and
ironing and then sent the fin
ished products to their homes
where their husbands had to pay
cash on delivery. The experi
ment lasted about ten years.
It was from Melocina Peirce
that we first hear about the idea
of kitchenless houses, an idea
that was to run through the rest
ot the movement. Peirce be

should be redesigned with kitch-

the finished products to their homes where
their husbands had to pay cash on delivery.

enless houses formed into
blocks around a cooperative
housekeeping center.
Marie Howland, a feminist in
Vineland, New Jersey, took the
idea a step further in the 1870's.
She got together with an
architect and actually designed
a whole city based on the kitch
enless house idea. Needless to
say, the city was never built.
Mary Livermore, an activist
in the suffrage movement from
the 1870 s to the 1890 s, felt that
a better idea would be a con
sumers' cooperative, instead of
the producers' cooperative pre
viously outlined. In a con
sumers' cooperative there

would be a neighborhood dining
club where all the families could
eat at relatively cheap prices
This experiment was carried
out in a few communities.
The second stage of the move
ment started with Elizabeth
Swallow Richards, who was the
first woman to graduate from
MIT She was the founder of the
iield of home economics, an
idea which she conceived of as
an applied science to educate
people in nutrition and sani
tation in the kitchen
She was primarily concerned
with women living in tenements
who had to work and who would
never be able to produce
nutritious and sanitary food in
that environment She decided
that America needed public
kitchens which would provide
excellent and nutritious tood at
low prices for these women.
This idea was taken up by Jane
Addams at Hull House, where it
worked quite successfully.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a
leading intellectual feminist at
the turn of the century, came up
with the novel idea of a feminist
apartment hotel for employed
women, which would provide 24-
hours-a-dav childcare, so that
women could lead a fuller life.
Hayden ended her lecture
about the material feminists
with the words, "these women
dared to dream about trans
forming everyday life." With 50
percent ot women with children
under the age of six in the paid
labor force today, the trans
formation is still going on.
Ms. Hayden, who obtained
her masters degree in architec

Dolores Hayden Associate
