## Watt it takes to unseat Sec'y James 
### 
Conservatives are chuckling
over a new joke: "How much
power does it take to get rid of
10,000 environmentalists 0 " The
answer: one Watt.
But environmentalists may
have the last laugh. "What's
wrong? Watt's wrong!" says
the Sierra Club's recent petition
to drive U.S. Interior Secretary
James Watt out ot office.
The Sierra Club's statement
of concern over Secretary
Watt's qualifications and per
formance deserves attention
and support.
The Secretary of the Interior
is responsible for overseeing 700
million acres ot public lands.
His mandate is to pursue ration
al development of the country's
resources while protecting and
preserving the natural environ
ment.
The smooth-talking Watt says
his only quarrel is with "en
vironmental extremists" who
woujd deny economic develop
ment on public lands. He claims
to support a "balanced" use ot
public lands. But his public and
private records show Watt has
been a consistent enemy of pres
ervation.
As president of the Mountain
States Legal Foundation. Watt
spent much of the last three
years attempting to thwart the
goals of the agency he now
heads. Watt's 10-attomey firm
opposed the Interior Depart
ment in 25 out of 28 cases con
cerning the environment.
The foundation, which was es
tablished to support the rights of
businessmen and developers.

has quickly established a repu
tation of being anticonsumer.
antifeminist, antigovernment.
antiblack. and. above all. anti
environment
Watt's short record as In
terior Secretary already re
flects his antienvironrnental
bias and inability to "balance"
when evidence stacks up against
developers. His April 10 de
cision permitting oil companies
to explore the Santa Maria
Basin otf the coast of Santa
Barbara is one example of the
conflict ot interest that Watt la
bors under.
Watt is determined to lease
the Santa Maria Basin and tour
other areas otf the California
coast to the oil companies for
development. He claims this ac
tion will enhance national se
curity and promote energy inde
pendence.
The oil potential of Lease Sale
53 — the five basins Watt is
eyeing for development — is 982
million barrels of oil. In terms
of U.S. oil consumption, these
numbers are insignificant.
America would gobble up those
millions of barrels in 30-60 days.
Prolonging America's "pe
troleum habit" 30 or even 60
days does everyone but the oil
companies a disservice. Such
action detracts from any move
ment toward energy independ
ence by fostering dependence on
a disappearing resource.
It also jeopardizes our na
tional security by putting otf the
day when we begin to ag
gressively pursue technologies
which make use of renewable

resources.
The decision to promote drill
ing for oil off the Calitornia
coast does not represent a poli
cy of "balance." Instead, it con
firms fears of Watt's fundamen
tal conflict of interest.
A recent study by the Rand
Corporation for the U.S. Geolog
ical Survey affirms that Ameri
ca's petroleum industry is sim
ply running out of geologically
promising places to look for oil.
If Watt was truly interested in
energy independence instead of
stroking the oil companies, he
would be concentrating on the

development of renewable re
sources.
Narrow vision and short
sightedness in environmental
policy planning are among the
greatest threats to America to
day. Watt has exhibited both
these characteristics, his sell
serving policies endanger a deli
cate environment. The petition
to replace him deserves support
as the embodiment of Ameri
ca's vital spirit of self-preserva
tion.

wrong? Watt's wrong!" says
the Sierra Club's recent petition
to drive U.S. Interior Secretary
James Watt out ot office.
The Sierra Club's statement
of concern over Secretary
Watt's qualifications and per
formance deserves attention
and support.
The Secretary of the Interior
is responsible for overseeing 700
million acres ot public lands.
His mandate is to pursue ration
al development of the country's
resources while protecting and
preserving the natural environ
ment.
The smooth-talking Watt says
his only quarrel is with "en
vironmental extremists" who
woujd deny economic develop
ment on public lands. He claims
to support a "balanced" use ot
public lands. But his public and
private records show Watt has
been a consistent enemy of pres
ervation.
As president of the Mountain
States Legal Foundation. Watt
spent much of the last three
years attempting to thwart the
goals of the agency he now
heads. Watt's 10-attomey firm
opposed the Interior Depart
ment in 25 out of 28 cases con
cerning the environment.
The foundation, which was es
tablished to support the rights of
businessmen and developers.

has quickly established a repu
tation of being anticonsumer.
antifeminist, antigovernment.
antiblack. and. above all. anti
environment
Watt's short record as In
terior Secretary already re
flects his antienvironrnental
bias and inability to "balance"
when evidence stacks up against
developers. His April 10 de
cision permitting oil companies
to explore the Santa Maria
Basin otf the coast of Santa
Barbara is one example of the
conflict ot interest that Watt la
bors under.
Watt is determined to lease
the Santa Maria Basin and tour
other areas otf the California
coast to the oil companies for
development. He claims this ac
tion will enhance national se
curity and promote energy inde
pendence.
The oil potential of Lease Sale
53 — the five basins Watt is
eyeing for development — is 982
million barrels of oil. In terms
of U.S. oil consumption, these
numbers are insignificant.
America would gobble up those
millions of barrels in 30-60 days.
Prolonging America's "pe
troleum habit" 30 or even 60
days does everyone but the oil
companies a disservice. Such
action detracts from any move
ment toward energy independ
ence by fostering dependence on
a disappearing resource.
It also jeopardizes our na
tional security by putting otf the
day when we begin to ag
gressively pursue technologies
which make use of renewable

resources.
The decision to promote drill
ing for oil off the Calitornia
coast does not represent a poli
cy of "balance." Instead, it con
firms fears of Watt's fundamen
tal conflict of interest.
A recent study by the Rand
Corporation for the U.S. Geolog
ical Survey affirms that Ameri
ca's petroleum industry is sim
ply running out of geologically
promising places to look for oil.
If Watt was truly interested in
energy independence instead of
stroking the oil companies, he
would be concentrating on the

development of renewable re
sources.
Narrow vision and short
sightedness in environmental
policy planning are among the
greatest threats to America to
day. Watt has exhibited both
these characteristics, his sell
serving policies endanger a deli
cate environment. The petition
to replace him deserves support
as the embodiment of Ameri
ca's vital spirit of self-preserva
tion.
