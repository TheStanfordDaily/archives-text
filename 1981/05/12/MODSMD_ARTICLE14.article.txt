Handicapped vote
I was horrified to find when I
went to vote in the clerical elec
tion that my "section's" voting
booths were in the lobby of Me
morial Auditorium. What
callousness to the needs of the
handicapped! What was a per
son in a wheelchair to do. . . or a
person with a heart problem . . .
or a person with knees which
collapse?
I thought that this election
was designed by people who
were concerned with the wel
fare of individuals and individ
ual rights. This insensitivity is
symptomatic of bureaucracy
and can be expected, but I
thought that federal regulations
(and is not the Labor Relations
Board a federal organization?)
were designed to prevent this;
and is not the union supposed to
take care of the needs of the em

ployee and be sensitive to spe
cial needs? . . . and I hoped the
University has been sensitized
to the fact that many of its build
ings of general usage are inac
cessible to a percentage of the
population (especially since
they get 50 percent of some Palo
Alto Grant funds tor University
access programs). How naive I
must still be.
I am angry about this. In this
"International Year of the
Handicapped" I resent the im
plication that we with problems
are still to be ignored by those
with options and responsi
bilities to evaluate and make
sure that our rights are to be
protected.
If there is a way for handi
cappers to enter MemAud, it is a
well-kept secret.
