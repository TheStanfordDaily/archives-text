## The 						tragedy of Ireland and Bobby Sands 
### 
The British army does not
belong in the north ot Ireland.
The British had no business in
Ireland 800 years ago under
Henry II and they have no busi
ness there today under
Margaret Thatcher. 800 years of
exploitation and murderous op
pression is quite enough. The
death of Bobby Sands last Tues
day only makes that need more
crystal clear.
With his tace blackened and
bones protruding from his skin,
Bobby Sands dies last Tuesday
in the Maze prison in Belfast.
Tuesday was to be the 66th day
ot a hunger strike undertaken to
force the British government
into recognizing Irish Re
publican Army (IRA) prisoners
as prisoners of war. Sands had
demanded IRA prisoners be re
turned to political status, which
entailed five basic demands:
they would not be forced to wear
a British prison uniform or do
prison work; they would have
access to educational facilities
and be able to associate treely
among themselves; they would
be entitled to a weekly visit and
they would be able to receive a
weekly parcel and letter.
In 1976. Britain took away the
political status it had once con
ferred on IRA prisoners. Pris
ons overflowing with political
prisoners turned out to be quite
an embarrassment to Britain in
the eyes of the world. What bet
ter way to makes those Irish
prisoners disappear than by
classifying them now as com
mon criminals long with the
shoplifters and car thieves 9
Criminalization of those who
resist their colonialism has
been a British tactic ot control
throughout history. They used it
against the guerrilla fighters of
Makarios in Cyprus and used it

against Americans fighting for
freedom during the American
Revolution. Criminalization is
an attempt to both legitimize
foreign occupation of another
people's country by making the
colonial power the adjudicator
of right and wrong, and. if the
propaganda is successful
enough, is an attempt to dis
credit those who resist the oc
cupation by branding them as
criminals. Finally, if the crimi
nalization policy is successtul,
then the freedom fighters be
come demoralized and the colo
nial (or is it imperialist i grip on
the country is strengthened.
Last December, Margaret
Thatcher ended the hunger
strike of seven other IRA pris
oners by conceding to their de
mands for political status in ef
fect, if not in name. Two months
after that hunger strike had
ended, if not in name. Two
months after that hunger strike
had ended, Bobby Sands
watched as the British govern
ment reneged on all its prom
ises His fast begun last March
Ist was designed to make those
promises of political status be
made in public â€” or he would be
come the 13th Irishman this cen
tury to starve to death in British
prisons on Irish soil.
To understand why Bobby
Sands fought so hard for politi
cal status, it is so important to
realize that he would not have
been in prison were his country
not occupied by the British
army By the use of the repres
sive Emergency Provisions Act
and Prevention of Terrorism
Act (both of which South
Africa s Pieter Botha marvels
at as ideal instruments ot con
trol ) Irishmen suspected of Re
publican' offenses can be
dragged off the streets and de

tained for seven days without
charge. Some are picked up just
to be harassed and released,
perhaps to be picked up in anoth
er week or two.
More likely, they are thrown
before special non-jury Diplock
courts. Here, the sole basis tor
their conviction' is their own
testimony. Both Amnesty In
ternational and the European
Court of Human Rights have
condemned Britain for use ot
torture in the special IRA pris
ons. The next time the media
mentions something about a
convicted' IRA gunman, think
about a conviction obtained
through torture.
Bobby Sands was striking out
at the British government in the
only way left to him, starvation
in one of their own torture
chambers, hoping to tocus
world opinion once more on
Northern Ireland and the des
peration most Irishmen. Catho
lic and Protestant, feel. Study
ing history carefully is the only
way to understand the tragedy
ot Northern Ireland, an
artificial state created by Brit
ain and of Ireland, herself. For
800 years Britain has used every
conceivable device to extract
the economic wealth of Ireland
and subdue the Irish people. It
has instigated Catholic-only
laws, denied Catholics the right
to own land, committed gen
ocide when it suited British
purposes, persevered in de
stroying the Irish culture, in
stigated policies which resulted
in the starvation of a million
Irishmen and the emigration of
a million more, during the 1846
Potato famine. The British
finally allowed the Catholics the
vote just before dissolving the
Irish parliament, partitioning
the country and ruling from

Britain.
Britain's most hateful tech
nique for maintaining control
over Ireland is not only the
oldest in history, but one at
which the British become most
adept. It is Caesar's maxim of
"divide and conquer." What
better way to control a country
than by whipping up sec
tarianism among those with
most to lose by her continued
rule?
Two hundred years ago, Prot
estants and Catholics toughi
side by side under Wolfe Jone, a
Protestant, to throw off the
British chains. Today, to Brit
ain's credit, poor Catholic tights
poor Protestant because it has
been profitable to the British tor
them to do so.
While Bobby Sands fasted 66
days for political status, he was
saying that there could be no
peace in the north of Ireland un
til the British and all their evil
left his country . . . left it to de
termine its own future, some
thing it has never been allowed
to do.
The British make familiar
arguments about being in
Northern Ireland to preserve
democracy and to keep the
peace. Aren't those aruments as
old colonialist exploitation and
imperialism themselves?
Where have you heard them re
cently? To explain Vietnam or
El Salvador? Look at history
carefully.
In the late 9605, Catholics in
Derry and Belfast took to the
streets to protest the lack ot
equal rights afforded them by
the artificial and sectarian state
of Northern Ireland. They de
manded not unity with the south
of Ireland but equal access to
housing and jobs, access con
trolled by the Protestant
Unionist Councils. When Prot

estant paramilitaries rampaged
through the Catholic ghettoes in
a wave of sectarian reaction,
the British army stood by and
watched the pogroms. To pre
serve peace?
In January of 1972, Bloody
Sunday, the British army
murdered 13 civilians as they
were peacefully assembled. To
preserve peace?
In 1974, the British stood by as
a violent strike by the Ulster
Worker's Council (led by the fa
miliar racist, lan Paisley)
brought down a reform govern
ment that might have been the
beginning of equal rights for
Catholics and a more equitable
Northern Ireland. To preserve
democracy?
Bobby Sands knew that the
poor Protestants and Catholics
are not enemies in Northern Ire
land. Not in the vast unemploy
ment lines or anywhere else.
While Catholic unemployment
hits 70 percent in the areas of
Belfast, Derry, Newry and
Strabane, there are many,
many poor Protestants. Bobby
Sands knew the only enemy was
the British army and the eco
nomic exploitation its presence
had guaranteed throughout his
tory.
Almost 60 years ago to the day
my grandfather was murdered
by the Black and Tans, a para
military British goon squad sent
to Ireland to crush the na
tionalist fervor that had sprung
up when Britain had publicly ex
ecuted the sixteen leaders of the
Easter Uprising of 96. Last
Tuesday, Bobby Sands died like
an animal in a cage.
Mother England, don't you
have enough blood on your
hands? Get out of Ireland.

Tuesday was to be the 66th day
ot a hunger strike undertaken to
force the British government
into recognizing Irish Re

demanded IRA prisoners be re

entailed five basic demands:
they would not be forced to wear
a British prison uniform or do
prison work; they would have
access to educational facilities
and be able to associate treely
among themselves; they would
be entitled to a weekly visit and
they would be able to receive a

Criminalization of those who
resist their colonialism has
been a British tactic ot control
throughout history. They used it
against the guerrilla fighters of
Makarios in Cyprus and used it

against Americans fighting for
freedom during the American
Revolution. Criminalization is
an attempt to both legitimize
foreign occupation of another
people's country by making the
colonial power the adjudicator
of right and wrong, and. if the
propaganda is successful
enough, is an attempt to dis
credit those who resist the oc
cupation by branding them as
criminals. Finally, if the crimi
nalization policy is successtul,
then the freedom fighters be

Last December, Margaret

Bobby Sands was striking out

Mother England, don't you

The British army does not
belong in the north ot Ireland.
The British had no business in
Ireland 800 years ago under
Henry II and they have no busi
ness there today under
Margaret Thatcher. 800 years of
exploitation and murderous op
pression is quite enough. The
death of Bobby Sands last Tues
day only makes that need more
crystal clear.
With his tace blackened and
bones protruding from his skin,
Bobby Sands dies last Tuesday
in the Maze prison in Belfast.
Tuesday was to be the 66th day
ot a hunger strike undertaken to
force the British government
into recognizing Irish Re
publican Army (IRA) prisoners
as prisoners of war. Sands had
demanded IRA prisoners be re
turned to political status, which
entailed five basic demands:
they would not be forced to wear
a British prison uniform or do
prison work; they would have
access to educational facilities
and be able to associate treely
among themselves; they would
be entitled to a weekly visit and
they would be able to receive a
weekly parcel and letter.
In 1976. Britain took away the
political status it had once con
ferred on IRA prisoners. Pris
ons overflowing with political
prisoners turned out to be quite
an embarrassment to Britain in
the eyes of the world. What bet
ter way to makes those Irish
prisoners disappear than by
classifying them now as com
mon criminals long with the
shoplifters and car thieves 9
Criminalization of those who
resist their colonialism has
been a British tactic ot control
throughout history. They used it
against the guerrilla fighters of
Makarios in Cyprus and used it

against Americans fighting for
freedom during the American
Revolution. Criminalization is
an attempt to both legitimize
foreign occupation of another
people's country by making the
colonial power the adjudicator
of right and wrong, and. if the
propaganda is successful
enough, is an attempt to dis
credit those who resist the oc
cupation by branding them as
criminals. Finally, if the crimi
nalization policy is successtul,
then the freedom fighters be
come demoralized and the colo
nial (or is it imperialist i grip on
the country is strengthened.
Last December, Margaret
Thatcher ended the hunger
strike of seven other IRA pris
oners by conceding to their de
mands for political status in ef
fect, if not in name. Two months
after that hunger strike had
ended, if not in name. Two
months after that hunger strike
had ended, Bobby Sands
watched as the British govern
ment reneged on all its prom
ises His fast begun last March
Ist was designed to make those
promises of political status be
made in public â€” or he would be
come the 13th Irishman this cen
tury to starve to death in British
prisons on Irish soil.
To understand why Bobby
Sands fought so hard for politi
cal status, it is so important to
realize that he would not have
been in prison were his country
not occupied by the British
army By the use of the repres
sive Emergency Provisions Act
and Prevention of Terrorism
Act (both of which South
Africa s Pieter Botha marvels
at as ideal instruments ot con
trol ) Irishmen suspected of Re
publican' offenses can be
dragged off the streets and de

tained for seven days without
charge. Some are picked up just
to be harassed and released,
perhaps to be picked up in anoth
er week or two.
More likely, they are thrown
before special non-jury Diplock
courts. Here, the sole basis tor
their conviction' is their own
testimony. Both Amnesty In
ternational and the European
Court of Human Rights have
condemned Britain for use ot
torture in the special IRA pris
ons. The next time the media
mentions something about a
convicted' IRA gunman, think
about a conviction obtained
through torture.
Bobby Sands was striking out
at the British government in the
only way left to him, starvation
in one of their own torture
chambers, hoping to tocus
world opinion once more on
Northern Ireland and the des
peration most Irishmen. Catho
lic and Protestant, feel. Study
ing history carefully is the only
way to understand the tragedy
ot Northern Ireland, an
artificial state created by Brit
ain and of Ireland, herself. For
800 years Britain has used every
conceivable device to extract
the economic wealth of Ireland
and subdue the Irish people. It
has instigated Catholic-only
laws, denied Catholics the right
to own land, committed gen
ocide when it suited British
purposes, persevered in de
stroying the Irish culture, in
stigated policies which resulted
in the starvation of a million
Irishmen and the emigration of
a million more, during the 1846
Potato famine. The British
finally allowed the Catholics the
vote just before dissolving the
Irish parliament, partitioning
the country and ruling from

Britain.
Britain's most hateful tech
nique for maintaining control
over Ireland is not only the
oldest in history, but one at
which the British become most
adept. It is Caesar's maxim of
"divide and conquer." What
better way to control a country
than by whipping up sec
tarianism among those with
most to lose by her continued
rule?
Two hundred years ago, Prot
estants and Catholics toughi
side by side under Wolfe Jone, a
Protestant, to throw off the
British chains. Today, to Brit
ain's credit, poor Catholic tights
poor Protestant because it has
been profitable to the British tor
them to do so.
While Bobby Sands fasted 66
days for political status, he was
saying that there could be no
peace in the north of Ireland un
til the British and all their evil
left his country . . . left it to de
termine its own future, some
thing it has never been allowed
to do.
The British make familiar
arguments about being in
Northern Ireland to preserve
democracy and to keep the
peace. Aren't those aruments as
old colonialist exploitation and
imperialism themselves?
Where have you heard them re
cently? To explain Vietnam or
El Salvador? Look at history
carefully.
In the late 9605, Catholics in
Derry and Belfast took to the
streets to protest the lack ot
equal rights afforded them by
the artificial and sectarian state
of Northern Ireland. They de
manded not unity with the south
of Ireland but equal access to
housing and jobs, access con
trolled by the Protestant
Unionist Councils. When Prot

estant paramilitaries rampaged
through the Catholic ghettoes in
a wave of sectarian reaction,
the British army stood by and
watched the pogroms. To pre
serve peace?
