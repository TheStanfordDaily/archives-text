## Aydin Koc No Armenian extermination 
### 
In the April 24 issue ot the
l)ml\. a commentary was pub
lished on this page calling for
recognition ot the Armenian
genocide by the Turks. The
.views in that article have been
repeatedly expounded in recent
years by Armenian extremists
and their spokesman, claiming
that Armenians have suffered
terrible misrule at the hands of
the Ottoman Empire, cul
minating in a wide scale gen
ocide in 915.
It seems most appropriate to
present several facts regarding
this matter that have not been
corrupted by prejudice and that
do not depend on fictitious evi
dence. The Ottoman Empire,
which lasted for more than sev
en centuries (1299-1918), had a
ruling Turkish dynasty, but was
composed of scores of different
ethnic populations. Alone
among the great empires of the
time, the Ottomans did not per
secute their subjects, and al
lowed them complete autonomy
within self-governing religious
communities (called millets) as
well as economic and social
guilds.
During these centuries, the
discontent andâ€ž suffering of
these millets was more from the
misrule ot their own religious
oligarchies than the Ottomans.
In this long period ot mutual
peaceful coexistence, non-
Muslim citizens (Armenians,
Jews, Greeks, Bulgars, Serbs)
occupied a multitude of govern
ment posts, freely conducted
trade, were influential in for
eign policy and accumulated
substantial wealth.
Beginning in the 19th century,
rising feelings of nationalism
resulted in the formation of in
dependence movements, each
claiming the widest possible
territory ever inhabited by its
nationality over history. Among
these, only the Armenians
failed, since through the cen
turies they had scattered widely
across the Russian and Ottoman
empires and did not constitute a
majority anywhere. This demo
graphic reality forced Arme
nians to resort to large scale
propaganda and terror.
It requires quite a stretch of
imagination to conjure that the
Ottomans had some grand ex
termination plan for the Arme
nians when no comparable ac
tion had ever occured to any oth
er minority, including those
with whom the empire was at
war for centuries. What lies be
hind the claims of an Armenian
genocide?
With the formation of
Hinchak and Tashnak commit

tees around 1886. the Armenians
became an exploitable issue in
the "Oriental Problem." which
had as its main aim the destruc
tion and dismemberment of the
Ottoman Empire. Russia and
England each set to provoke the
Armenians into revolt, in order
to set up a nation in Eastern
Anatolia loyal to their own
global ambitions that would
check the progress ot the other
Rapidly armed Armenian ter
rorists not only operated in the
provinces, wiping out Muslim
villages and burning residents
alive in mosques, but also in
Istanbul where bombs were
placed in government offices,
schools and libraries. Local re
bellions were ignited in Adana
and Van. The strategy, re
peatedly declared by militants,
was to evoke a strong response
fr9m Ottoman authorities in or
der to generate an excuse tor
foreign intervention.
This policy reached its peak
during World War I, when
Armenian guerilla groups de
veloped a plan for an empire
wide revolt for the purpose of
undermining the Ottoman war
effort and enabling Russia to oc
cupy the lands claimed by the
Armenians. Starting in 9 4,
arms and ammunition were
spread to secret Armenian
bands and were concealed in the
basements of houses and
churches. Large volunteer
forces were formed to tight on
the sides ot the Russians on the
Caucasian front and with the Al
lied forces in the Middle East.
Soon after the war started,
even before Russian armies
temporarily invaded Anatolia,
Armenians revolted in Van,
massacring all Muslims in the
vicinity and declaring their own
state. The excesses of the Arme
nians accompanying the Rus
sians toward the Turkish popu
lation were so severe that even
Russia felt a need to send them
back to rear lines. Upon these
acts of treason and unwarranted
murders, and in order to pre
vent the Ottoman army from
being stabbed in the back and to
preserve the existence ot the
state, the Ottoman government
felt compelled to transport the
Armenians to Syria and
Palestine, away from combat
zones. The United States took
similar action against its
Japanese citizens during World
War II without like provocation.
During this deportation,
caravans were attacked by
Kurdish and Armenian bands.
Casualties also resulted due to
war conditions, creating severe
shortages of food, shelter and
clothing. As a result, up to 20
percent ot the deportees, or
about 100,0)0, may have died be
tween 1915 and '9'B. This is no
greater a percentage than that
for the Turkish community in
the same place at the same
time.
Incessant efforts have been
made to find proof of pre
meditated genocide against the
Armenians in Ottoman docu
ments. Upon the Allied occupa
tion of Istanbul in 1918, all par
liament deputies and govern
ment officials were imprisoned
in Malta and an exhaustive in

vestigation of government docu
ments were carried out for evi
dence. Nothing was found When
British, French and American
foreign service files provided no
credible evidence, the detainees
were released.
In a similar vein. General
James Harbord headed an in
vestigative commission in 9 9
on behalf of the American peo
ple. concluding that the inci
dents were initiated by Arme
nian atrocities. He added that
even if all deported Armenians
were to return to their original
abodes, they would be unable to
form a majority even in one sin
gle locality.
There was no genocide com
mitted against the Armenians in
the Ottoman Empire before or
during World War I. No gen
ocide was planned or ordered by
the Ottomans and none was car
ried out. However, through
Armenian societies in Western
countries and similar contacts,
a misrepresentation has been
fostered, building on a Western
disposition ot easily accusing
non-Christians as guilty in inter
religious conflicts.

The Daily will run a tinancial
aid forum Tuesday, May '9
Graduate stipends are not being
increased, work study is being
cut in half, and the future of
guaranteed student loans is un
certain. All reactions are wel
come. Deadline tor submissions
is next Friday. Letters must be
typed double-spaced on a 57-
space character line.

A more blatant misrepresen
tation is presently being pro
moted that draws parallels be
tween the Jews in World War II
and Armenians in World War I.
The episodes are uncomparable
for several reaons. First, the
Armenians were in armed re
volt, while the Jews were not.
There was no government prop
aganda against the Armenians.
Moreover, no evidence similar
to Nazi documents have been
found. That anyone had to die is
regrettable, but history is full of
such examples from the Ameri
can Indians to the Palestinians.
The responsibility for the Turk
ish and Armenian victims of the
Armenian issue evidently lies
with the Armenian revolu
tionary organizations.
It is reprehensible and sad
that misrepresentation about
events that occured even before
the Turkish Republic was
formed is now being used as the
justification tor murdering 18
innocent and defenseless
diplomats of that Republic since
1973. One wonders in which
Western country the Armemian
society enjoys the same un
bridled economic, religious and
civic liberties as those provided
by the Turkish Republic to its
Armenian citizens as of today.
