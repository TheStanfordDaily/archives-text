# Budget slashes access program for handicapped
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Another small
bureaucratic hamlet, the U.S.
Architectural and Transporta
tion Barriers Compliance
Board, has joined the sporadic
guerrilla resistance to the Rea
gan administration's budget
cutting policy.
The board, formed by Con
gress in '973 to help make feder
al buildings accessible to the
handicapped, has been told to
put itself out of business by
Sept. 30, when the current fiscal
year ends.
The board is "an unnecessary
regulatory layer" in the govern
ment, says the Office of Man
agement and Budget, which
wants to save the $2.4 million
the board would have received
for the next fiscal year.
But the board's public mem
bers are fighting back, led by
chairman Mason Rose, a Los
Angeles lawyer who is confined
to a wheelchair.
At a turbulent meeting Rose
and his allies fended off a coor
dinated attack by the federal of
ficials on the board aimed at one
ot the board's significant and
controversial regulations — a
set of guidelines on architec
tural barriers approved in the
final weeks of the Carter admin
istration.

Although the parliamentary
wrestling had its comic mo
ments, according to some of
those present, there is nothing
comical about the issue dividing
the board — how far the federal
government should go in assur
ing that handicapped people
have easy access to public build
ings and other facilities such as
buses, subways, public tele
phones and restrooms.
The Reagan administration is
not about to be tripped by such
scattered protests within the
government. Most federal de
partments and agencies have
cooperated with the OMB's
budget-control campaign; some
even have volunteered, deeper
cuts.
One exception is the National
Consumer Cooperative 'Bank,
whose president legally, but qui
etly, transferred $60 million in
Treasury funds to the bank after
the administration disclosed
plans to cut off funding for the
bank, a lending institution joint
ly owned by the federal govern
ment and consumer cooperative
stores. Treasury officials have
said they will try to get the mon
ey back.
Another exception is the
transportation barriers board —
or at least its members repre
senting the public.
