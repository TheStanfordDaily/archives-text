The high costs to the Soviet
Union of invading Poland make
it unlikely that such a move will
occur, according to History and
Political Science Professor
Alexander Dallin
Dallin made his comments at
a bag lunch sponsored by the
History Undergraduates As
sociation (HUGSA) Tuesday.
Despite many people's con
viction that recent labor strikes
in Poland would result in Soviet
intervention, Dallin said he was
"more surprised by the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan than by
their failure to invade Poland "
In his discussion, Dallin listed
several reasons the Soviets
would want to stay out of Po
land.
First, the Poles would resist
an occupation attempt. Dallin
estimated that such a takeover
would take two to three weeks
and "could very well exact
'.00,000 casualties. The Poles
are not unprepared."
There is also an economic fac
tor involved. Poland is already
an economic drain on the Soviet
Union; a Soviet occupation
would quite possibly result in
Western banks' calling due their
loans to Poland, according to

Dallin
Third, a Soviet attempt to
stop the labor protests would
"spoil the myth that the Soviet
Union is the protector ot the pro
letariat."
Finally, an invasion by the So
viets would tend to pull together
the United States and Western
Europe, who have been drifting
apart since World War II In ad
dition. arms limitation talks
would certainly end
An invasion by the Soviet
Union, therefore, seems unlike
ly. However, "there is a dis
tinct limit to this Soviet toler
ance." Dallin cited three events
that could precipitate Soviet
military intervention
Overt defiance of Moscow,
lite instituting a multi-party
system or pulling out of the War
saw pact, would almost surely
result in an invasion by the Sovi
et Union.
A loss ot control by author
ities. such as rioting if the food
situation gets worse, could also
cause the Soviets to "help re
store order."
Lastly, a v replacement ot
Polish leadership by people
Moscow does not approve of
could result in some interven
tion.
