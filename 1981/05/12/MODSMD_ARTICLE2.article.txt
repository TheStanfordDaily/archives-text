# Corporate pullout recommended
## Committee backs proxy moves 
### Mike Oneal 
A trustee committee has endorsed
two proxy resolutions that would de
crease American corporate involve
ment in South Africa.
One resolution asks U.S. Steel to sell
its interests in any South African af
filiates which fail to comply by the end
of 982 with the Sullivan Principles —
guidelines for managerial responsi
bility in the racially segregated coun
try.
The University owns 122,200 shares
in U.S. Steel and supported a similar
proxy resolution last year. The com
pany has seven affiliates in South
Africa.
The trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIRi
made these decisions upon recom
mendation by its advisory Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The CIR report concluded:
"We believe that U.S. Steel's posi
tions in its affiliates are strong enough
to successfully press for adherence to
the Sullivan Principles. U.S. Steel has
apparently chosen to avoid man
agement responsibility in South
Africa."
The other resolution asks Mobil Cor
poration to end all sales to the South
African police and military and to
"monitor all bulk sales and large
scale service operations to ensure that
the South African police and military
are not the end-destination of
purchases made through in
termediaries."
A similar resolution was brought
last year against Mobil but went un
recognized.
About this year's Mobil resolution
the CIR wrote:
"We need not labor the critical role
of the police and military in support
ing apartheid (racial segregation) in
South Africa, and we are united in our
belief that U.S. businesses should not
provide goods or services to these
forces either directly or indirectly."

The committee has supported four
other South Africa resolutions this
year
The SCIR called on the Interna
tional Harvester Co. to halt expansion
in South Africa until that government
abolishes apartheid. The Carnation
Co was asked to give a report on its
condensed milk marketing and promo
tion practices. In addition. Citicorp
was asked to establish a South African
loans review committee, while IBM
was asked to stop sales to South
Africa.
Chile resolutions rejected
The CIR and SCIR both.voted to abs
tain on three resolutions concerning
corporate expansion in Chile.
Atlantic Richfield Co.. Exxon Corp
and the J.P. Morgan Corp. were called
upon to halt any further investments
or expansion in Chile until democratic
rule and guaranteed civil and political
rights are restored.
The CIR aired the same argument
for abstaining on all three resolutions,
saying, "We cannot accept as realistic
the condition the resolutions place on
the Chilean government for access to
future credit (or U.S. investment),
namely the restoration of full partici
pation in the democratic process for
all Chileans."
Energy resolutions
Of seven resolutions proposed this
year concerning nuclear energy or
weapons, the CIR voted for only one —
against the management of Virginia
Electric and Power Corp. — that pro
posed an impact study on alternative
energy. The SCIR supported none.
Finding resolutions unrealistic, ide
alistic or rhetorical accounted tor the
majority oi the no votes, according to
a number of CIR and the SCIR mem
bers.
"A number of resolutions came
through on nuclear weapon production
and nuclear energy plants that were
unrealistic and unreasonable." said
SCIR chairman Nelson Dong.

"Many of them don't give man
agement enough credit and we
couldn't, in good faith, vote for them
The same is true for many of the con
servative issues such as those calling
for the halt of sales to the Soviet
Union." he added.

guidelines for managerial responsi
bility in the racially segregated coun
try.
The University owns 122,200 shares
in U.S. Steel and supported a similar
proxy resolution last year. The com
pany has seven affiliates in South
Africa.
The trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIRi
made these decisions upon recom
mendation by its advisory Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The CIR report concluded:
"We believe that U.S. Steel's posi
tions in its affiliates are strong enough
to successfully press for adherence to
the Sullivan Principles. U.S. Steel has
apparently chosen to avoid man
agement responsibility in South
Africa."
The other resolution asks Mobil Cor
poration to end all sales to the South
African police and military and to
"monitor all bulk sales and large
scale service operations to ensure that
the South African police and military
are not the end-destination of
purchases made through in
termediaries."
A similar resolution was brought
last year against Mobil but went un
recognized.
About this year's Mobil resolution
the CIR wrote:
"We need not labor the critical role
of the police and military in support
ing apartheid (racial segregation) in
South Africa, and we are united in our
belief that U.S. businesses should not
provide goods or services to these
forces either directly or indirectly."

The committee has supported four
other South Africa resolutions this
year
The SCIR called on the Interna
tional Harvester Co. to halt expansion
in South Africa until that government
abolishes apartheid. The Carnation
Co was asked to give a report on its
condensed milk marketing and promo
tion practices. In addition. Citicorp
was asked to establish a South African
loans review committee, while IBM
was asked to stop sales to South
Africa.
Chile resolutions rejected
The CIR and SCIR both.voted to abs
tain on three resolutions concerning
corporate expansion in Chile.
Atlantic Richfield Co.. Exxon Corp
and the J.P. Morgan Corp. were called
upon to halt any further investments
or expansion in Chile until democratic
rule and guaranteed civil and political
rights are restored.
The CIR aired the same argument
for abstaining on all three resolutions,
saying, "We cannot accept as realistic
the condition the resolutions place on
the Chilean government for access to
future credit (or U.S. investment),
namely the restoration of full partici
pation in the democratic process for
all Chileans."
Energy resolutions
Of seven resolutions proposed this
year concerning nuclear energy or
weapons, the CIR voted for only one —
against the management of Virginia
Electric and Power Corp. — that pro
posed an impact study on alternative
energy. The SCIR supported none.
Finding resolutions unrealistic, ide
alistic or rhetorical accounted tor the
majority oi the no votes, according to
a number of CIR and the SCIR mem
bers.
"A number of resolutions came
through on nuclear weapon production
and nuclear energy plants that were
unrealistic and unreasonable." said
SCIR chairman Nelson Dong.

"Many of them don't give man
agement enough credit and we
couldn't, in good faith, vote for them
The same is true for many of the con
servative issues such as those calling
for the halt of sales to the Soviet
Union." he added.
Rodney Adams. Stanford's director
of finance and a member of the CIR.
elaborated
"There are some fairly new issues
on the agenda this year such as Soviet
sales and nuclear energy," Adams
said. "There is an evolutionary proc
ess which these issues go through
Usually in the tirst couple of years the
resolutions are extreme, but as the is
sue matures, it becomes more refined
and less rhetorical."
