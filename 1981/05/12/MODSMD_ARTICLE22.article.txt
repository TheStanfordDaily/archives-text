Paul McCartney assumes the
George Harrison muse and pro

pop commercialism as the mu

The array of talent Mc-
Cartney has assembled proves
able to overcome the various
technical and commercial bar
riers to a good album However,
while the music has a concert
sound, it has little concert feel

ing the echoes off the walls of
London's Hammersmith Odeon
are reproduced in lull, but the
album lacks the excitement and
consistency of a live per
tormance.
Perhaps this is partly due to
the tact that the songs them
selves are arranged in an order
that makes commercial sense,
but doesn't follow the order in
which the concerts were played
at all
The album starts with one full

have done well enough on their

The album is filled with good,
if poorly recorded, tracks. The

Is the album worth the cover
price? Yes. if your collection
doesn't include a sampling of
these bands. Yes. if you believe
that the money will go to feed

the album is probably most val
uable as a museum piece — the
last good rock cause of the Sev
