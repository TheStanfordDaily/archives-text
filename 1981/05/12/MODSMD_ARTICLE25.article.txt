# Great lighting and questionable values mark 'A Chorus Line'

If considered solely as enter
tainment, "A Chorus Line" is
frequently a shining example of
what a Broadway musical, and
only a Broadway musical, can
do. It might even be considered
the essential Broadway rfiusi
cal, since it is concerned with
the foundation of the form — the
chorus line. But, like so much
that emerges from 42nd street,
its main goal is keeping the au
dience happy — an ideal which
can be as insidious as it is ir

responsible.
"A Chorus Line" is a two
hour, uninterrupted audition.
Zach, the director, must choose
eight dancers — four men and
tour women — from among
twenty-five semi-finalists for
the chorus of a Broadway musi
cal. Since the chorus must also
play a few small roles, Zach asks
each of them to talk about their
lives. This motivates a series of
monologues and song-and-dance
numbers. One of the dancers is
Cassie, Zach's former lover,

who has failed to achieve
stardom in Hollywood, and who
is now trying to return to her
former career as a chorus girl.
"A Chorus Line" opened at
New York's Public Theatre in
1975, and later moved uptown to
the Shubert Theatre on Broad
way. This latest series of per
formances at the Curran
Theatre is the fourth time the
touring company has visited San
Francisco. "A Chorus Line" is
generally considered to be the

show which revived Broadway
in the mid-seventies This, de
spite a generally forgettable
score (by Marvin Hamlisch)
and lack-lustre choreography
(by director Michael Bennett
with Bob Avian). There are
many utterly stunning moments
in it, but these are more a result
of the lighting (by Thomas
Musser) and the set (by Robin
Wagner).
For most of the play, the
stage is completely empty. The
only relief comes trom the rear
panels, which are sometimes
rotated to become a bank of tall
mirrors These mirrors not only
multiply the images of the
dancer un-stage, they also allow
the audience to see itselt from
the point of view of the actors —
very much confusing the issue
ot who is performer and who is
audience. (A similar effect is
obtained by sitting in the Ter
race section at Davies Hall).
Equally fascinating are the
flurry of images which appear
as the mirrors are rotated in and
out ot view; too bad this doesn't
happen more often.
Because the stage is so bare,
lighting must be used to delimit
scenes and control mood. In "A
Chorus Line," lighting is not
subservient to other ideas — it is
used expressively, and is re
sponsible for the most startling
effect of the entire show. At the

end ot " At the Ballet." the three
singers are lit by soft purple
spots on an otherwise dark
stage. As they merge with the
line of dancers standing down
stage. the stage is suddenly
brightly lit with harsh white
light. The result is an ag
gressive change of mood —
trom a soft, poignant ballad to a
hostile police line-up.
There are other effective mo
ments elsewhere, but they tend
to be diminished by weaknesses
in the score and the chnrp"
graphy. A good example is
Cassie's solo in "The Music and
the Mirror." For her dance, a
curved backdrop of mirrors is
lowered onto the stage, and the
brightly colored footlights are
turned on — creating umpteen
static and kinetic flashes of col
or. But her dance — even though
tull of virtuoso techniques —
lacks any purpose. It is neither
icily classical like Balanchine
nor unabashedly erotic like
Fosse. It's just bland.
From a technical viewpoint,
"A Chorus Line " works beau
tifully, which can probably be
taken for granted, given this
show's pedigree. The costumes
(by Theoni Aldredge) are in
teresting as well as appropriate
for the rehearsal setting. Also,
the actors are quite im
aginative, creating distinctive
personalities out of their tiny

roles, and dancing with energy
and excitement throughout the
performance.
There is a serious problem
with this show, however, and
that is its set of values. A group
of highly talented individuals,
leading generally lousy lives,
having trained for years, are
being put through a ruthless
audition so that a handful of
them can be part of a kick-line
— a role better suited to a team
ot robots. One might comment
that the creator of the show
(Michael Bennett> had this iro
ny in mind when he started the
project, but the sensation dur
ing the closing number — that
the thrilling finale justifies all
that has gone before — belies
this interpretation.
Put simply, this showsays ">at
self-expression < pa r ucuiar .y
sexual self-expression' • t be
punished, in this case ex
clusion from the chorus line. In
a small but omnipresent way.
this is shown by calling the dan
cers boys and girls, even though
they are all men and women in
their twenties and thirties.
However, it is better demon
strate by what hapens to the
character Paul Towards the
end ot the audition, he gives a
lengt'r \ pathetic monologue dur
ing which he comes out v le
scribing his initial experiences
of gay life. Moments later, he is

injured while dancing, and is
forced out of the show The sub
conscious message is quite
clear.
In isolation, this comment
might be considered over-sensi
tive ; after all, the symbolic pun
ishment of gay characters has
become a formula for the popu
lar treatment of homosexuality.
However, in the final selection
of the chorus, not only both gay
characters, but all the married
and most overtly sexual charac
ters are excluded as well. The
one exception is Cassie; but in
the original plans for the show,
she too was omitted from the
chorus. Throughout, coy sex
uality is strongly encouraged
(with risque lyrics and reveal
ing costumes), but overt sex
uality is suppressed.
Many people will consider
such comments irrelevant or in
poor taste. After all, most ot us
go to the theatre to be thrilled,
and this is frequently a thrilling
show. But people are also
thrilled by bull fights, fires, car
accidents, and murders. Au
dience response is no excuse.
