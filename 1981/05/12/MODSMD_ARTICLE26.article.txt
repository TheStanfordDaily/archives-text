# Ted Nugent concert: just what you would have expected
## 
### Don Willenburg 
Signs were posted all around
the entrance warning that no
one who had already passed out
would be allowed in to see the
show. The first overdose came
before the first band had taken
the stage. The victim was car
ried from the front of the press
box by burly in green
helmets as four % teenage girls in

matching white jerseys with
black sleeves giggled their way
into more Quaaludes from a
biker who looked like he would
be the security guard's next
charge.
A call from the promoters for
the ground floor mass of human
ity to take three steps
backwards to keep from pushing
those in front through a wooden
restraining wall was greeted
with a mass of boos, extended
middle fingers, and a rush to the
stage that necessitated two at
tempts at repair.
In short, the Ted Nugent con
cert last Friday at the Cow Pal
ace was just what you'd expect.
Like his new double live album,
Intensities in Ten Cities, a Ter
rible Ted show is a violent in
dulgence of the rock and roll id
stripped of conscience, com
promise, or any ot "that sweet
shit."
Ted approaches his Fender'
not as an instrument but as a
weapon: it is easy to see why he

was pictured on the cover of his
"Weekend Warrors" LP
playing a guitar with double
shotgun barrels where the tun
ing pegs should have been. His
rapid-fire style of play lends
credence to his assertion that
"this guitar can blow the balls
off a charging rhino at 30
paces."
The show featured Ted
playing all the songs that earned
him airplay and his reputation
for what can only be termed
"symbarbarism"- rock and roll
hedonism with a Visigoth ap
preciation of the subtle and re
fined. The songs were played to
sound as much like the old ver
sions as possible. Ted considers
himself a purist: any deviation
from the one true standard ot jet
engine level amplification of
power chords and lightning
leads is heresy of the highest or
der.
Nugent glares at his audience
from behind the microphone
like some poacher stalking

young and innocent game. His
expression abruptly changes
from time to time to a wide,
clean-shaven smile, and you can
almost hear the mothers who es
corted their junior high school
daughters to the show saying,
"he'd be so good looking if he'd
just cut that hair."
It's easy for Ted to smile.
Who wouldn't be happy to have
screaming fans swaying to each
line ot songs like "Jailbait,"
"My Love is Like a Tire Iron,
and "Wang Dang Sweet Poon
tang'.' " He's got his audience in a
Stranglehold," and that's just
where they want to be.
It wasn't until the second en
core that Ted swung across
stage on a rope while wearing
his Indian and a fringe
leather jockstrap, bjit he'd re
vealed, everything he had to
show by then anyway. Though
there were three other
guitarists in the band, the entire
performance was Nugent's na
ked flamboyance: they could

have connected one guitar to all
the speakers and saved union
wages three times over.
But maybe Ted figured he had
already saved enough money by
putting out another live album.
Intensities in I en ( ities is ap

parently an attempt to repro
duce the commercial success of
Double Lire Clomo. an ap
propriately-titled effort which
presented unadulterated Ted
noise and banter to a larger au
dience than ever before. Un

fortunately, the new LP doesn't
live up to the old Where Gonzo
was kicking and screaming, In
tensities is just screaming,
which, it you saw Friday's
show, is about what you would
expect.
