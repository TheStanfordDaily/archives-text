A University committee has recom
mended the creation of a campus-wide
biosatety program to monitor the use
ot chemicals in laboratories here
Established last autumn, the
Biosatety Advisory Group recently
circulated a survey to University de
partments. The survey listed about 20)
suspected carcinogens that require
special handling.
Scientists working with the
chemicals are expected to return the
surveys May 15. According to Errol
Friedberg. associate professor of
pathology and bio fety advisory
group chairman, pasi attempts to de
sign a biosafety program have met
with little success.
"It's a good thing to do. but it needs
to be done in such a way that it's not
viewed simply as another bureau
cratic facility," friedberg said
The committee has also recom
mended that two more committees be
established to consult federal and
stale guidelines while developing
rules and policies for labs and stock
rooms containing suspected
carcinogens.
No invasion of privacy
"A campus-wide program would be
useful as a mechanism to help scien
tists," said Friedberg. ; Any time a
compound is found to be carcinogenic,
we could notify investigators of the re
quired safety steps We don't want it
to be considered an invasion of scien
tific privacy," he added
Though Friedberg stressed that the
University does not have any serious
problems handling chemicals, he
noted student concern over chemicals
used during lab problems.
TA criticizes University
In at least one instance, chemicals
used in certain lab assignments were
changed when they were found to be
dangerous, according to chemistry
teaching assistant Kelly Moran. Nev
ertheless. Moran said the University
needs to look at the biosatety problem
"a lot more."
