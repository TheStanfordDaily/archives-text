# Safeguards imposed on chemicals

A University committee has recom
mended the creation of a campus-wide
biosatety program to monitor the use
ot chemicals in laboratories here
Established last autumn, the
Biosatety Advisory Group recently
circulated a survey to University de
partments. The survey listed about 20)
suspected carcinogens that require
special handling.
Scientists working with the
chemicals are expected to return the
surveys May 15. According to Errol
Friedberg. associate professor of
pathology and bio fety advisory
group chairman, pasi attempts to de
sign a biosafety program have met
with little success.
"It's a good thing to do. but it needs
to be done in such a way that it's not
viewed simply as another bureau
cratic facility," friedberg said
The committee has also recom
mended that two more committees be
established to consult federal and
stale guidelines while developing
rules and policies for labs and stock
rooms containing suspected
carcinogens.
No invasion of privacy
"A campus-wide program would be
useful as a mechanism to help scien
tists," said Friedberg. ; Any time a
compound is found to be carcinogenic,
we could notify investigators of the re
quired safety steps We don't want it
to be considered an invasion of scien
tific privacy," he added
Though Friedberg stressed that the
University does not have any serious
problems handling chemicals, he
noted student concern over chemicals
used during lab problems.
TA criticizes University
In at least one instance, chemicals
used in certain lab assignments were
changed when they were found to be
dangerous, according to chemistry
teaching assistant Kelly Moran. Nev
ertheless. Moran said the University
needs to look at the biosatety problem
"a lot more."
Moran said that class sizes and fa
cilities make it difficult to keep track
of all students and proper handling of
all chemicals. According to Moran.
teaching assistants stress safety
measures, but lab assignments often
require moving the chemicals away
from the protective hoods that are
used to collect possibly harmful
fumes. The fumes then can spread
throughout the room.
Friedberg said students have little
to worry about concerning classroom
exposure to chemicals. "What we're
really concerned about are the long
term effects of the use of suspected
carcinogens. Students don't spend
enough time with carcinogenics in
concentrated amounts to be in anv

real danger." he added.
Chemistry Prot. .John Brauman re
iterated Friedberg's statement,
saying. There is no indication that
chemists are suffering from exposure
to dangerous chemicals.
When we do find a questionable
chemical, we try to find some alter
native." Brauman said. ''We don't
knowingly take any risks," he added,
noting that fires and broken glass are
more likely laboratory safety risks.
Brauman and Friedberg said they
both see the University moving to de
velop a biosafety program more as a
move to comply with government reg
ulations than to upgrade current prac
tices. "We .know how to be careful."
said Brauman "We're trying to make
sure adequate information is provided

so scientists can know how to handle
long-term-acting carcinogens," he
added.
Recently, the University has been
fined twice for biosafety hazards.
In September 1979, the state Depart
ment of Industrial Relations fined the
University $3500 tor violating safety
regulations. Three months earlier, the
department tined Stanford Hospital
$1800 for similar violations.
According to Brauman, one of the
scientists who was fined didn't realize
that one of the suspected carcinogens
was present in the laboratory.
"We haven't worked with that
chemical in ages." Brauman said,
adding, "If we had known it was there
we could have taken proper steps. It
was a sin of omission."
