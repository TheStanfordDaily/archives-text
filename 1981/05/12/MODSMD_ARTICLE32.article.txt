# Third match in as many days
## Racketeers face Bears in 'Big Match' 
### Ivan Maisel 
With three seniors leaving his
1980 NCAA runner-up team, Cal
men's tennis coach Bill Wright
had reason to write 1981 off as a
rebuilding year. His No. 5
player, Mike Bauer, would go to
No. 1, and freshmen would be
counted upon to pick up the
slack left by Scott McCain. Mar
ty Davis and Chris Dunk.
That's why it has come as a
surprise to see the Bears in the
thick of the race toward the
NCAA championships later this
month. Wright has slowly
brought the Bears along to the
point that they are a viable can
didate for the national title.
Cal's quest continues today
when the Bears visit the Farm
to meet undefeated Stanford at
1 30 p.m at the Tennis Stadium
($2, $1 tor students with ID).
Though Pepperdine whipped
them 7-2 Wednesday, the Bears
have steadily improved in com
piling a 21-7 season record (5-2
in the Pacific-10 Conference).
"I thought we were on our way,
but we got a little sidetracked
We played well at Pepperdine a
week ago (Cal won 5-4). We
were just flat," said Wright,
who is still impressed with his
team's progress.
The first two weeks of May
are crucial for co/legiate tennis
teams The players have to tune
themselves up mentally and
physically for the grueling na
tionals Wright said his team
will be ready
"I think we are gearing up.
We've got a tough schedule
ahead There are going to'be flat
times. They're going to have to
pull things together against
Stanford "
The Cards beat Cal frb in
Berkeley April' 3. The Big Match
doesn't quite engender the in
tensity of the Big Game, but the
motive for revenge is still there.
"I think it's special," Wright
said. All the Pac-10 matches are

special. Stanford is even more
so because of the Big Game and
Stanford's success. But we play
so darn many matches," Wright
said. "You try to treat them all
the same. Maybe it's not as big
as it once was when we didn't
play as many matches. It kind of
dilutes things."
Leading the Bears will be
Bauer, a 6-3 junior who owes his
rapid rise in the Cal lineup to the
Berkeley hills. His average
sized legs of a year ago have be
come massive because of a
steady diet of running the hilly
country. The result has been in
creased power and more im
portantly, increased stamina.
Playing behind Bauer is
freshman Mark Wooldridge,
with the build — and the power
— of a fullback. He gave Stan
ford's undefeated Scott Davis
one of his closest matches this
season, taking him to 6-4 in the
third set
If Stanford has an edge, it
would be its depth. The Cards
outshine Cal at the bottom of the
lineup Cal's brightest hopes
will be at Nos. 4 and 5, Randy
Nixon and Phil Lehnhoff. Nixon,
a sophomore, always seems to
play well against Stanford. He's
lost only one match in the last
four meetings between the two
schools.
Lehnhoff was the heir ap
parent to the top of the lineup
this season, but injuries and a
slump have dropped him to one
spot below his No. 4 position ot a
year ago. Cal needs a good per
formance from him if they are
to win.
A win today would be quite an
upset for the Bears. Wright is
hoping for any kind of advan
tage. "If Stanford didn't play to
day (Thursday) they'd probably
have more emotional energy. I
think it could be a little tiring."
Maybe even tiring enough to
lose.
