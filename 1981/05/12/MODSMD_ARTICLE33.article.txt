# Stanford coach now in 15th year
## Good as gold is Gould for Card tennis

When you meet Stanford tennis coach
Dick Gould you get the distinct impression that he
just changed out of his cape and into his sweats on
his way from the nearest phone booth. And you
have serious doubts as to whether the "S" on his t
shirt stands for more than just Stanford.
He is the only person that you'll ever meet
whose smile is so wide and so instantaneous that it
literally cracks. He is at one moment, smiling and
jovial, and at the next, full of intensity and sincer
ity when talking about the game and the program
that he has developed into the best in the nation.
And he is the best college tennis coach in the na
tion. Period. His list of accomplishments can only
be termed phenomenal. He has piloted the men's
team to five national titles — in 1973, '74, '77, '78.
and '80. Thirty-three of his players have earned
All-America honors. Stanford has placed in the
NCAA's top 10 in each of the last 11 years.
But Gould remembers back to when it wasn't
always that way. His first year on the Farm, 1967,
the team dropped to 16th in the nation, after not
being out of the top 10 since "World War II." The
next year, they fell to 33rd. And Gould's third year
at Stanford, the team plummeted out of the rank
ings and finished with a dismal nine-and-twelve
record. "People take it for granted now that Stan
ford has always been at the top, but it wasn't
always the case," said Gould, sipping on a post
match beer and obviously reflecting on harder
times. But since 1970. the team has not been out of
the top five.
Gould has not sat back on his laurels and rested,
however. Innovation and progress are synon
omous with the man. who first brought indoor
matches to college tennis back in 1974. The new
scoreboard that adorns the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um is the only one ot its kind in the world. "The
thing I've always enjoyed about Stanford is that
no one has ever put limits on ideas." he said. "The
(athletic) department is great in that respect,
they listen and let us try things."
Now in his fifteenth year at the Stanford helm,
Gould has his goals outlined tor the future as well.
"My basic goal now is to make the entire Stanford
tennis program self-sufficient, and I really think
it's possible. I want to make it so that we will

always have a program — and a high class pro
gram — here at Stanford."
Towards these ends, Gould is working on get
ting endowed scholarships, ones that accrue in
terest and are therefore terminal. In 1.971, Gould
initiated the Stanford Tennis School, with the pro
ceeds every year going to the Stanford Buck Club
for tennis scholarships.
Through all of this. Gould finds the most satis
fying part ot his job to be working with his
players. "Just working with kids one-on-one," he
explained. "This is a very important period in
their life, and I try to have a positive influence on
their development. This is an age group which I
just love."
And he feels that is especially blessed in that re
gard this year. "Of all the years I've coached, this
team in particular, has the character of a winner.
They are tremendous competitors and are very
class individuals. They're kind of a coach's
dream. For their sake, I hope it materializes into
what it should, and that of course, would be a na
tional championship."
Now 42, Gould looks like he could be 22. and he
hasn't slowed down a bit. What is the force that
drives him? "At first it was probably an ego trip
more than anything else — to just prove it (be
coming number one) could be done. I really be
lieved in what could be done with Stanford tennis.
I wanted to make it the best in the nation. I was so
obsessed with that idea, that it hurt my life and
my coaching."
But Gould says his first national title in 1973
changed all that. "That got the monkeys off my
back. I learned that you don't have to prove any
thing. We had already proved it. You just do your
best, and if the rest comes, fine. I hope I'm a bet
ter coach now."
Gould is a master recruiter, having snagged the
number one junior in the United States for the last
three years in Tim Mayotte. Dave Siegler, and
last year, Scott Davis.
Gould's enthusiasm for his job here on the
Farm is tremendous, and a great deal of his suc
cess can be attributed to it. "First of all. I feel
very fortunate to be at Stanford. It's a job I think
that I will never get tired of, and with a little bit of
luck, I'll be here until I die. I 'm as excited now as I
was the first day I started.''
