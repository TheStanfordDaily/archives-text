# Arches hinder performance
## Jaeger plagued by injury 
### Sally Jenkins 
If Susy Jaeger were a ballet
dancer rather than a tennis
player she would be all the rage
right now. She has a pair of
arches high enough to march un
der. The only problem is, they
are making it awfully hard to
keep a tennis shoe on for more
than thirty minutes without se
vere pain So instead of a sea of
glory, she finds herself in a sea
of ultra-violet, as in treatments.
After winning her first four
matches tor the Stanford wom
en's tennis team, Jaeger was on
her way to becoming the next
Stanford sensation. Then she
came down with something un
pronounceable in her feet, and it
has plagued her ever since.
"It has something to do with
the tendons, they get really tight
and sore if I am on my teet tor
too long." she said "I don't re
ally understand it.and I don't
think the doctors really know
what to do about it either. It's
not something medication
helps."
The only thing that does help
is complete rest, apparently.
Jaeger thought she was ready to

go last week when the men and
women's teams went to Ojai tor
the Pacitic-10 Individual Cham
pionships. She won two of her
three matches there, only to be
hit with the pain once again.
The injury could eliminate
her from competition for the re
mainder of the season. "It
would have healed by now if I
had been oft ot it for awhile, but
then I didn't know five months
ago I would still be having
pain," she said.
The problem seems to run in
the family. Her younger sister,
professional Andrea Jaeger, has
been having her own tendon
troubles as well. Their parents
moved to Florida recently so
that Andrea could play on softer
courts, in hopes that it would
ease some ot the foot problems.
However, as Susy said, "It's a
little late for me. Andrea does
seem to be playing better lately
though."
The family is originally from
Lincolnshire, Illinois, where the
girls tirst started playing under
the tutelage of their father, a
teaching pro. Susy is one of
those unshakeable baseline

players, a style she adopted
from Chris Evert-Lloyd.
"When I started playing Chris
was making a mark on tennis.
Dad saw her playing from the
baseline, and with the two
handed backhand," Jaeger said.
"It was working, that was the
trend in tennis then, so that's
what we patterned my game af
ter."
"My sister started playing a
year later and she was volleying
off the bat," she continued. "I
played much longer from the
baseline before I ever even
thought of using a volley."
Jaeger is slightly revamping
her game to include more ag
gressive play. "It's a different
way of thinking. I want to be
more assertive, be able to take
the upperhand in a point," she
remarked.
The foot problem is hindering
her development, however. She
asserts that she has grown
somewhat as a player in col
legiate tennis simply because
she has had to face more diverse
opponents, which her record
thus tar reflects: 8-1 overall, 2-f.
in tournament play.
