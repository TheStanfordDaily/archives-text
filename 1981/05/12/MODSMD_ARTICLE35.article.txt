# King to lead new team
## Breakers to hit Bay Area 
### Sally Jenkins 
Team tennis is making a
comeback, particularly in Cali
fornia, and .particularly in the
Bay Area. Last month a pro ten
nis draft was held and the Oak
land Breakers nabbed Billie
Jean King.
The 1981 Team Tennis season
is due to get underway in July.
Competing with King will be ex-
Stanford tennis ace Peter Ren
nert, who graduated last June
after leading the Cardinals to an
NCAA Championship title, and
taking second in the individual
NCAA tournament.
Rennert and Fritz Buehning
will make up the male half of the
team. Both will be making their
team tennis debuts. liana Kloss,
a South African doubles special
ist and former Golden Gater,
will be the fourth member of the
squad; she is the only member
besides King who has played
team tennis before.
Veteran King is a needed ad
dition to the team if only for her
leadership qualities. She holds
20 Wimbledon titles, more than
any other player in history. She
has five years of World Team
Tennis experience to back her
up,

She holds several single-sea
son and career WTT records,
and was named that organiza
tion's Most Valuable Player in
1974. She was a member of the
1976 WTT Champion New York
Apples.
â€¢ She became the first woman
to ever coach a co-ed pro
fessional team when she guided
the Philadelphia Freedoms to a
39-5 record in 1974, the same
year she was awarded MVP .
King's off-court accomplish
ments are no less impressive.
An author, television commen
tator, and businesswoman, she
once founded a national sports
magazine. In 1975 she estab
lished the Women's Sports
Foundation, to encourage and
support women's involvement
in athletics.
In 1977 she was named one of
the Ten Most Powerful Women
in America by Harpers Bazaar
Magazine.
The Breakers may be sorely
in need of King's know-how and
experience this summer, as
they will be lacing formidable
competition. Aside from the
Breakers, three other teams
will compete in California: the
Los Angeles Strings, the San Di

ego Friars, and the Orange
County Oranges.
You might recognize some ot
the names from the rosters of
those teams, names like
Martina Navratilova, Marty
Riessen, Butch Walts, and Vijay
Amritraj.
The 1981 Team Tennis rosters
are as follows, in order of draft
selection by each team:

Jean King, (2) Fritz Buehning,
