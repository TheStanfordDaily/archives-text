# ABC executive calls glamour 'short-lived’
## 
### Cynthia Moses 
ABC Vice President Robert
Trachinger told students at a brown
bag lunch last Friday, "the glamour
ot television is short-lived. After a
while it's tyke the garment industry."
Trachinger. 57, gave his packed au
dience the full advantage of his 3'
years at ABC, sharing both the person-,
aland business problems a career in
network television entails.
Speaking ot his work with ABC
Sports, Trachinger said, "I can truly
tell you that at one time in my life I
held the single most exciting job in the
world — for a single man. Un
fortunately, I was married."
ABC began to cover sports events in
the 19505, after an antitrust suit forced
RCA to sell the American Broad
casting Company, leaving it with vir
tually no affiliates to supply income.
In those days, football games were
covered with just two cameras. Now,
the Masters PGA tournament, for ex
ample. is covered with 24, according
to Trachinger
Trachinger. who claims responsi

bility for slow motion on video tape,
the use of the Goodyear Blimp in
sports coverage, and the utilization of
the hand-held camera, said, when
ABC started "I never remember hav
ing a single budget on a show."
But, along with building a vast au
dience and acquiring affiliates,
Trachinger said, "the point came
when every show was clearly defined
and budgeted above and below the
line."
Above the line costs are talent ex
penses. Below the line costs include
the technical services needed to pro
duce a show.
Above the line costs are fixed, and,
Trachinger pointed out, talent is well
paid. Howard Cosell gets a salary of $1
million and Keith Jackson $450,000.
Frank Sinatra and John Denver both
get $750,000 per show.
Below the line figures, however,
"breathe," Trachinger said. It is often
possible to cut and save money on a
show.
Currently, Trachinger is respon
sible for supplying technical services

for shows like the Academy Awards.
He said, "The (title of) vice president
allows me to travel first class and my
salary." His position as General Man
ager of Television and Services, and
Broadcast Operations and Engineer
ing, a title he must check on his busi
ness card for accuracy, allows the
time to make "my third marriage
work and let my daughter know who
her father is."
Trachinger said none of the
networks has been successful in cost
control. All three networks have failed
with management of craft people, ac
cording to Trachinger.
"The industry needed creative peo
ple to make an idea happen and man
aging was left somewhat behind."
Trachinger said. But now, man
agement needs to acquire new skills in
dealing with people. The days of tyran
nical producers are over, according to
Trachinger. He said. "In the com
munication business we communicate
poorly with our people."
The average salary in network man
agement is about $43,000 a year.

"Yet," Trachinger said, "people are
not very happy. The dollars don't give
them what they want out of lite. If you
succeed (in television management)
you will have a great deal of responsi
bility, accountability, and work long
hours. You will control the lives of a
number of people who work for you. It
took me many years and a lot of pain to
figure it out," he said.
Trachinger said many new changes
are coming. Although the networks
have a long life ahead of them, the new
delivery systems like cable and video
discs are going to slowly erode the
network profits. He said, "The $l-out
and $5-in-return kind of profits won't
happen much longer."
Besides his work in sports.
Trachinger won two Emmy Awards in
documentary work: one for .4 De
cision to Die, about suicide among
teenagers, and another tor The Com
in,i< of the Roads, about t ie environ
ment.

Trachinger. He said. "In the com

The average salary in network man

not very happy. The dollars don't give

figure it out," he said.
Trachinger said many new changes
are coming. Although the networks
have a long life ahead of them, the new
delivery systems like cable and video
discs are going to slowly erode the
network profits. He said, "The $l-out

ABC Vice President Robert
Trachinger told students at a brown
bag lunch last Friday, "the glamour
ot television is short-lived. After a
while it's tyke the garment industry."
Trachinger. 57, gave his packed au
dience the full advantage of his 3'
years at ABC, sharing both the person-,
aland business problems a career in
network television entails.
Speaking ot his work with ABC
Sports, Trachinger said, "I can truly
tell you that at one time in my life I
held the single most exciting job in the
world — for a single man. Un
fortunately, I was married."
ABC began to cover sports events in
the 19505, after an antitrust suit forced
RCA to sell the American Broad
casting Company, leaving it with vir
tually no affiliates to supply income.
In those days, football games were
covered with just two cameras. Now,
the Masters PGA tournament, for ex
ample. is covered with 24, according
to Trachinger
Trachinger. who claims responsi

bility for slow motion on video tape,
the use of the Goodyear Blimp in
sports coverage, and the utilization of
the hand-held camera, said, when
ABC started "I never remember hav
ing a single budget on a show."
But, along with building a vast au
dience and acquiring affiliates,
Trachinger said, "the point came
when every show was clearly defined
and budgeted above and below the
line."
Above the line costs are talent ex
penses. Below the line costs include
the technical services needed to pro
duce a show.
Above the line costs are fixed, and,
Trachinger pointed out, talent is well
paid. Howard Cosell gets a salary of $1
million and Keith Jackson $450,000.
Frank Sinatra and John Denver both
get $750,000 per show.
Below the line figures, however,
"breathe," Trachinger said. It is often
possible to cut and save money on a
show.
Currently, Trachinger is respon
sible for supplying technical services

for shows like the Academy Awards.
He said, "The (title of) vice president
allows me to travel first class and my
salary." His position as General Man
ager of Television and Services, and
Broadcast Operations and Engineer
ing, a title he must check on his busi
ness card for accuracy, allows the
time to make "my third marriage
work and let my daughter know who
her father is."
