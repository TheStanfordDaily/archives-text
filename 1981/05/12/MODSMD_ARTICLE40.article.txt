Los Angeles (AP) — A hair
dresser who says she lived with
Billie Jean King in the early
: 970s has sued the tennis star for
an interest in a Malibu house
and half the property she ac
quired during the alleged les
bian relationship.
Mrs. King said today the al
legations were "untrue and un
founded."
Marilyn Barnett, 32, said she
began living with Mrs. King in
•972 and that she promised to
take care of her financial needs
in return for her services as a
companion and business as
sociate.
The Superior Court suit filed
Tuesday by attorney Joel F.
Ladin contends: "On or about
May 1972 in Los Angeles, Calif..
(Ms. Barnett) and (Mrs.) King
met and began dating on a regu
lar basis. Sexual intimacy be
tween (Ms. Barnett) and (Mrs.)
King commenced approximate
ly six months after their first
date."
Ms. Barnett. now a para
plegic, says she gave up her job
as hairdresser to become secre
tary, confidante, companion,
cook, cleaning person and "all
other things necessary so that
(Mrs.) King's energy could be
totally directed toward playing
tennis."
Mrs. King issued a statement
today through her publicist de
nying the allegation and saying
she was "shocked." The
statement added that Mrs. King
and her husband Larry had been
"sympathetic" to Ms. Barnett's
"plight" in recent years.
The Barnett suit is based on
California's so-called
"palimony" precedent under
which former singer Michelle
Triola was allowed to sue actor
Lee Marvin for half of his earn
ings during the period they lived
together as an unmarried cou
ple. Ms. Marvin was awarded
$104,00°, although she had
sought $1.8 million.
Ms. Barnett's suit says Mrs.
King and her husband have de
cided to sell a Malibu house that
Ms. Barnett says is in her name
jointly with Mrs. King's.
She said in the suit that in 1974
Mrs. King had told her, "Go buy
yourself a house," and she has
asked the Los Angeles Superior
Court to rule that the house can
not be sold without her per
mission
"Marilyn Barnett is a woman
who worked as my secretary in
the early to mid '705," said Mrs.
King's statement, which was re
leased by publicist Pat Kingsley
and the Women's Tennis As
sociation.
Ms. Barnett said injuries suf
fered in a fall left her a para
plegic.
WTA spokeswoman Ana
Leaird said in Orlando, Fla.,
that the Kings have a sound
marriage.
