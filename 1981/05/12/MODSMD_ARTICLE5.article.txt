# Hoover fellow Thomas Sowell leads right-wing black group
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Iconoclastic may be the only description that
fits Thomas Sowell.
He was a Harlem ghetto black who dropped out
ot high school and left home at 17 — only to gradu
ate magna cum laude from Harvard University
in 1958. A Marxist when he completed college, he
is now head of a small group ot right-wing blacks
who oppose busing to integrate schools, think af
firmative action is a failure and call minimum
wage laws counterproductive.
A former professor of economics at UCLA.
Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion. Since last month he has been in seclusion,
refusing to give interviews or make any public
appearances.
Sowell had been organizing a conservative
group to counter the NAACP last month, but, ac
cording to a source at the Hoover Institution,
high blood pressure temporarily sidelined the-50-
year-old economist.
The Black Alternatives conference Sowell was
organizing would have been the second meeting
of black conservatives since December. In a let
ter dated March '6. Sowell wrote to his col
leagues saying that the "sheer volume of tele
phone calls from the public and the press vir
tually paralyzed my office" and that the organiz
ing tasks "far exceeded what I could take on and
still continue to research and write. "
Although Sowell is staying out of the public
view for the moment, his ideas are not His ex
tensive writings on economics and ethnicity in
clude eight books — among them. Knowledge
and Decisions, published last year.
In his writings, Sowell expresses black conser
vative thinking, which, he says, consists of a firm
belief in the tree market and that "blacks have
more to gain through the economic system than
the political system."

Sowell points to figures showing the widening
gap between white and black family incomes
since the establishment of affirmative action
programs. Census Bureau figures do in tact give
his views ammunition. The gap closed steadily in
the '60s; in 1969, blacks' income averaged 61 per
cent ot whites' income. But after that, af
firmative action programs started and by 1979,
that percentage fell to 57 percent. Critics point
out. however, that the drop may be due to the
sharp increase in the number of black families
headed by women with no husbands.
Sowell also sees the mid-'7os recession as part
ly responsible. But Sowell argues that the real
harm from affirmative action is the stigma it
needlessly attaches to blacks who made it on
their own.
Sowell is even more disparaging of court-or
dered busing which he claims most blacks now
oppose. Forcing schools to integrate only serves
to anger white parents and does not produce
positive results for black children, he said He
sees no problem in maintaining segregated
schools. "All-black Dunbar High School in Wash
ington had an average I.Q. of 111 in 1939, com
pared with the national average of 00 — and this
15 years before sociological stereotypes were
enshrined as the 'law of the land,' " he wrote in
an article for The New York Times.
To give his arguments more power, Sowell re
cently analyzed 70,000 I.Q. records for 2 dif
ferent ethnic groups and schools across the coun
try He found no evidence to show that racial sep
arateness affects achievement. Also. Sowell re
ported that role models — teachers with the
same racial origins as their studenf* — and
middle class homes with many magazines, are
simply not necessary for educational success.
While these views have ruffled the feathers of

the liberal NAACP leaders and the liberal estab
lishment in general, the most bitter arguments
developed over who really speaks for America's
black population.
After Sowell was named to President Ronald
Reagan's new Economic Policy Advisory Board
— a distinction he shares with Nobel laureate
Milton Friedman, a former teacher of his at the
University ot Chicago and a colleague at the Hoo
ver Institution — one NAACP leader said he
might become the administration's "house nig
ger." Sowell, known for his sharp wit and
brusque manner, responded in kind, charging
that his critics rest their claim to black leader
ship on the false virtue of being "blacker than
thou." Sowell singled out black Democrats An
drew Young and Patricia Roberts Harris as light
skinned elitists. This, in turn, provoked a charge
that Sowell was using "pigment politics."
Sowell continues to claim that his views are
more in line with the attitudes of black Ameri
cans and points to Gallup polls and other surveys
which show just that. One Gallup poll found that
most blacks would like the courts to deal more
harshly with criminals. Another survey com
pared the views of blacks with those of college
students and found the former group consistently
more "conservative" in outlook.
Critics respond by pointing to other polls, like a
Roper Organization poll which recently found
that 68 percent of blacks favor continued help
from the government.
Nevertheless, Sowell and other conservatives
place great faith in the ability of blacks to use
their own resources to succeed — as other ethnic
minorities and immigrants succeeded.
Sowell, who taught at Rutgers, Howard. Cor
nell and Brandeis universities, settled in East
Palo Alto. He is currently wui kiiit,
