## Mideast crisis heightens; theories abound 
### Washington Post 
' Jerusalem — With Israel and Syria risk
fhg military controntation over Syrian anti
aircraft missiles in Lebanon, theories
purporting to explain the crisis are nearly
aS abundant as the mutual condemnations
jiouring daily out of Damascus and Jerusa
lem.
1 Not since the 967 war has a showdown be
tween Israel and an Arab neighbor unfolded
in full public view so dramatically and man
ifestly — so much so that the potential
pauses ot war have emerged almost in slow
'motion, as it inviting leisurely scrutiny by
Israeli and world opinion before the pro
tagonists move onto the next plateau of bel
ligerency.
While the dimensions of alleged provoca
tions in the current crisis are smaller than
in 967, they are no less clearly defined: re
acting to an attempt to gain improved posi
tions by Israeli-supported Lebanese Chris
tian forces in the strategic Bekaa Valley.
Syrian Army troops launched a major at
tack last month. The Israeli Air Force re
sponded by shooting down two Syrian heli
copters on April 28 and the Syrians im
mediately deployed SA6 ground-to-air mis
sile batteries in an unmistakable challenge
to Israel's freedom of movement in Leba
nese skies.
Word followed deed, with threats by both
•sides. Prime Minister Menachem Begin
,yvarned that Israel'.would forcibly remove
:the missiles before it reduced the scope of
Israeli air operations over Lebanon and Syr
ian President Hafez Assad warned that he
iwould not be intimidated by Israeli threats.
The question why Israel and Syria have
allowed the crisis to reach this stage — and
what motivated the brinksmanship — has
'been the object ot much speculation here.
Some of the prevailing theories in Jerusa
lem are:

The Soviet connection. According to
this version, the Soviet Union is directing
the crisis through its client state ot Syria to
enhance chances of a Soviet involvement in
future Middle East peace negotiations
Once the U S mediation efforts fail and a
Syrian-Israeli clash seems imminent, the
Soviet Union would prevail on the Syrians at
the last moment and claim a dramatic dip
lomatic success, thereby advancing its can
didacy tor a role in a European or United
Nations peace initiative after the Camp
David process is finally abandoned,
A corollary holds that the Soviet Union is
merely trying to keep the pot boiling in the
Middle East to block U.S. diplomatic
achievements in the region, or to distract
world attention from unrest in Poland and
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
Critics of this theory maintain that the So
viet Union does not exert that much control
over Syria They argue that the Soviets op
posed deployment ot the missiles in Leba
non in the first place, but that this did not
stop the Syrians.
Syrian domestic crisis
♦ The Syrian domestic crisis theory: Buf
feted by increasing challenges to his author
ity by Moslem Brotherhood guerrillas, As
sad is seen eager to rally his country behind
a contlict with the perennial external toe,
while at the same time improving his
isolated position in the Arab world. A con
flict over the missiles would allow the Syr
ian president to boast that while Iraq, with
the support of Jordan and other Arab states,
is waging war on Moslem Iran, only Syria
was willing to challenge the Zionist enemy
once again.
Critics of this theory argue that a possible
two-front conflict with Israel in Lebanon
and on the Golan Heights could not be won
by Syria in any case and would actually be a
liability to its political stability.
♦ The reelection war theory: Only one

thing could guarantee Begin s reelection in
the June 30 Israeli election, according to
some of the prime ministers's more radical
opponents, and that is a successtul war just
before the balloting The missile crisis pro
vides a neat pretext not only for coming to
the rescue of the Lebanese Christians, but
also for wiping out Palestinian guerrilla
strongholds in Lebanon that were re
established soon after Israel's "cleanup"
invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978
An apparent flaw in this theory is that
substantial Israeli losses would be highly
unpopular with the war-weary electorate
and would give the opposition Labor Party
grist for its claim that Begin has mis
handled the crisis from the start
Syrian-Israeli compromise
♦ The Syrian-Israeli compromise theory:
Its exponents hold that the Syrians are at
tempting to avert a future linkup of the
Christian forces in northern Lebanon with
those in the southern enclave along Israel's
border. To do this, Assad wants to force Is
rael into a compromise in which Syria
would give Israel freedom of movement in
Lebanese skies to attack Palestinian bases,
while Israel would stop supplying Christian
forces through the Mediterranean port of
Jounieh.
This theory does not take into account Be
gin's often-declared moral commitment to
the Lebanese Christians or their strategic
s value to Israel's security. If the Syrians de
feat the Christians and take over Lebanon,
Begin argues, they could attack Israel from
the north and the east.
Out of the array of theories offered to ex
plain the causes of the escalation, one fact
seems unarguable. Israel remains adamant
in its refusal to tolerate the Syrian missiles
in Lebanon and Syria remains equally ada
mant in its determination to keep them
there.
