# Soviets rediscover Iraqi friends as war progresses
## 
### Washington Post 
Baghdad. Iraq — Despite its stance of official
neutrality in the Iranian-Iraqi war. the Soviet
Union has taken steps to aid Iraq in the apparent
hope of preserving a leading role here after the
war and keeping intact the friendship treaty be
tween the two countries.
While the Iraqis say they have not received a
single cartridge" from the Soviets since the war
began in September, Western diplomatic sources
here say Iraq has been receiving weapons from
other Soviet Bloc countries and is obtaining valu
able assistance from Moscow to help it repair
quickly a war-damaged, Soviet-built power plant
providing electricity for the capital.
It is highly unlikely that the Soviet Union's al
lies would be providing these arms, which include
100 tanks believed to have come from Poland,
without Soviet approval, according to these
sources.
Continue treaty
Iraq, for its part, has just signaled its desire to
continue the treaty, largely because it was able to
obtain Soviet-made munitions in Eastern Europe
and elsewhere, according to Tariq Aziz, a leading
member of the ruhng Revolutionary Command
Council. Despite the Soviet refusal to provide
arms directly, Aziz said in an interview that rela
tions between the two nations were "normal."
Continuing access to Iraqi oil, particularly for
its Eastern European allies, is believed to be a
major reason for the Soviet decision to do some
thing about its deteriorating relations with Bagh
dad.
Another is the Soviets' hope to avoid being shut
out of Iraq altogether while trying to woo Iran and
straddle the dispute between the two neighboring
Persian Gulf powers with its stance of official
neutrality. The Soviet attempt to carry out a simi
lar policy with two warring neighbors in the Horn
of Africa four years ago resulted in Moscow losing
one old ally, Somalia, but gaining another in Ethi
opia.
Policy analysis
Analysts of Soviet policy here and in Washing
ton believe Moscow decided late last year to re
pair its badly frayed relations with Baghdad after

it failed to make much headway in establishing
closer ties with the Iranian government headed by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The Polish tanks were sent to Iraq in January -
the main item known to have been shipped to Iraq
thus tar from any Eastern European nation — al
though Saddam Hussein said he has signed con
tracts with both Eastern and Western Europeans
for billions of dollars worth of new weapons since
the onset of the war.
Since the signing of a commercial and transit
accord with Iran in April 1980. analysts said they
do not believe that Moscow has made much head
way in improving its relations with the Khomein;
government. The transit agreement created a
"land bridge" helping Iran overcome the Western
economic boycott imposed at Washington's
behest to pressure Tehran to release the 52 Ameri
cans being held hostage at the time
There has been an increase in Soviet exports to
Iran as a result of the accord but "no payoft
elsewhere," as one U.S. analyst put it.
Invasion, aggression, renegotiation
Among the outstanding issues between the two
countries has been the Soviet invasion of Afghan
istan, which Tehran has vehemently opposed.
Moscow's failure to condemn what the Iranians
call the "flagrant Iraqi aggression against Iran."
>and the Iranian demand for renegotiation of the
price of its natural gas being sold to the Soviets
The flow of Iranian gas to the Soviet Union was cut
shortly after Khomeini took power.
In February, Iranian Prime Minister
Mohammed Ali Rajai told the Soviet ambassador
to Tehran, Vladimir Vinogradov, that Iran saw no
difference between the policies of the Soviet
Union and the United States. Iraq, on the other
hand, has made it clear that it does see a dif
ference, still refusing to renew diplomatic ties
with Washington 14 years after they were severed
during the 967 Arab-Israeli war.
Although the Soviet Union has refused to pro
vide Iraq directly with either arms, ammunition
or spare parts since the outbreak of the war with
Iran, it never totally stopped its military as
sistance to the Iraqi armed forces.
