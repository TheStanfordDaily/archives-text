# Berlin election bruises Schmidt's coalition
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — The Social Dem
ocratic Party of West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt suffered a major loss Sun
day in a West Berlin municipal election that
could seriously strain his federal coalition
government.
Balloting in West Germany's largest city
ended in a stalemate among four parties,
with none winning an absolute majority.
The opposition Christian Democrats won a
plurality but the future leadership of the
city was in doubt.
The result represented a blow to Schmidt,
whose party had controlled Berlin almost
without interruption since World War 11. It
comes at a time of multiple troubles tor the
"West German leader.
Party Chairman Willy Brandt, a former
Berlin mayor, called the loss "bitter" but
refused to take it as a comment on Bonn
government policy.

The Christian Democrats heralded the
vote as a political watershed. Party Chair
man Helmut Kohl said it was a defeat for
Schmidt as well as the acting mayor and So
cial Democratic candidate, Hans-Jochen
Vogel.
The Berlin impasse, which had been fore
cast by pre-election surveys, is due in large
part to the success of the so-called Alter
native List — a collection of many auton
omous, environmental and largely left-wing
activist groups which for the first time have
gained representation.
The steep drop in votes for the Social
Democrats reflected at the least a wide
spread disaffection with the party's pro
grams and character in Berlin. The election
had been moved forward two years follow
ing the collapse in January of the govern
ment of mayor Dietrich Stobbe in connec
tion with a major financial scandal.
The campaign focused on such local prob

lems as the occupation of vacant city houses
by squatters, with its law-and-order con
cerns. The housing protest, meant to dra
matize a severe shortage of apartments,
was accompanied by often violent street
demonstrations by rebel youths.
With the shadow of scandal, the party's
policies appeared discredited to many vot
ers. Party leaders engaged in considerable
self-criticism during the campaign, press
ing the theme of party renewal.
The strong showing of the Alternative
List was seen as a product ot voter dis
satist action with the three parties that had
made up the Berlin Senate. The party draws
mostly young members from educational,
cultural and protest circles. Its symbol is a
green hedgehog that, probably not by acci
dent, faces left on posters that describe the
party's chief purpose as "fundamental op
position."
