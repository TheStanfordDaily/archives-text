# Student's car stolen â€“ used in bank robbery

Scott Fraser, a Stanford sen
ior, walked outside one day to
find that his car had been stolen.
Fraser's car was stolen Janu
ary 5 or 6, sometime in the eve
ning. The car, a Mustang, had
special locks on the doors to pre
vent entrance, it was locked at
the time, and was parked under
a street light, said Jackie
Fraser, Scott's mother.
Fraser, an Arroyo resident,
said he and a friend walked out

side to the parking lot, and he
couldn't find his car. He said he
thought he'd forgotten where he
had parked it."It was hard to
believe that it had actually been
stolen,'' said Fraser. Then, "I
thought some friends of mine
had pulled a joke on me and
moved the car," he said. He bor
rowed a car and drove around
looking for it, but soon realized
that it was gone. He reported
the theft to the police, who said
they thought the car had been

taken by some Palo Alto youth
for joy riding, said Fraser.
A couple of days later,
Fraser's parents saw the car in
the paper, said Mrs. Fraser.
"It was a strange feeling to
see the car on the front page of
the morning paper," said Jack
ing Fraser. She said the sheriff
called about fifteen minutes lat
er from Salinas to inform them
that the car had been found.
Scott's parents called him,
and he was later subpoenaed

and had to go to court in Salinas
to testify that he hadn't let the
thieves take the car, said Mrs.
Fraser. He arrived, but didn't
have to testify because the men
took the guilty plea, said Mrs.
Fraser.
The car was involved in what
police told Mrs. Fraser was
"the biggest coup in Salinas in
long time."
She explained that four men
attempted to rob the Wells
Fargo Bank in Castroville, but
one of the thieves who had re
mained in the Mustang heard on
his police band radio scanner
that the police were coming. A
chase ensued, Fraser's car was
driven over 100 miles an hour.
She wonders why on earth
these kind of men had chosen to
steal a car from Stanford. The
men were ex-felons: the ring
leader was employed by the gov
ernment finding jobs for ex-fel
ons, said Mrs. Fraser, and he
"found them a job all right."
"When you first think about
your car being stolen you're up
set. I couldn't believe it when I
heard about the attempted rob
bery and the chase. I thought it
was very funny, said Scott. "I
tried to convince my parents to
keep the bullet holes in the car ."
Fraser said that it later oc
cured to him how scary it is that
these people hang around the
campus. He said that one had
been a member of the SLA (with
which Patty Hearst was also as
sociated) and another was an
ex-Black Panther.

Mrs. Fraser said. "It's not
something that happens to one
every day. It was incredible and
frightening, as well as inconve
nient." She said they drove on
the highway from Castroville to
Moss Landing where the gun
battle and chase has been. "We
drove down and re-traced the
whole thing, and saw the bank."
She said they gave Scott the
family station wagon, as she
had heard that Mustangs are
easy to hotwire.
According to the Stanford Po
lice Department, 37 cars and
mopeds were stolen in 1980,39 in
1979. Raoul Miemeyer, Captain
ot Investigations said there are
more and more auto thefts be
cause of the inclusion of mopeds
in the number.
Niemeyer also said.
Mustangs aren't any easier to
hotwire. "Once you're under the
hood, it is easy to hotwire any
car." He said that steering
wheel locks and gear shift locks
help make attempted thefts
more difficult. Niemeyer said
there aren't many thefts ot vehi
cles at Stanford, which is sur
prising considering the number
of good cars there are on cam
pus.
