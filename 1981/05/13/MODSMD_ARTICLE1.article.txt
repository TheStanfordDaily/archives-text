# Athletics Dept. and the Band to confer on football programs
## 
### Peter Finch 
Over the course of the past tew
years, many members of the Stanford
community have become increasingly
offended bv the on-field behavior of
the LS.JUMB
Next year, it looks as if things may
be slightly different.
This spring, in a first-ever move,
University officials have created a
panel to "advise" the entirely student
run band The panel, an ad hoc group
comprised mainly of representatives
from the Athletic Dept.. the Alumni
Association, the President's Office
and the Public Affairs Office, will
meet with members ot the Band
before each football game next fall to
review the upcoming pre-game and
half-time shows
The decision appears to have come
on the heels ot similar actions taken
by several Ivy League schools this
spring. Associate Athletic Director
Gary Cavalli, however, denied that
anything happening outside Stanford
prompted the University's decision
"Actually, our decision pre-dated
that ot the Ivy League schools',"
Cavalli said "Besides. I believe their
actions will be stronger, a real
clampdown. Ours is more ot an 'ad
visory group,' while theirs is more of a
'control group ' "
According to Cavalli, the real rea
son behind the panel is to give the
Band an insight into how non-mem
bers view LSJUMB performances.
"All of us (with the University) feel
that people in an organization are
sometimes too close to the situation to
see it objectively." he said
Cavalli stressed that the panel is not

intended to "stifle the Band's creativi
ty." and noted that "subtle sexual ref
erences" are still likely to be part of
the LS.JUMB repertoire. "It's the bla
tant. gross stuff we don't want to see
them do," he said.
According to Asst Band Manager
Disco Hay Gruenewald. most band
members are not at all worried about
the prospects for next fall In fact, he
said, the panel "could actually benefit
the Band, believe it or not."
"I don't think it's as big of a deal as
most people are assuming." he ex
plained. "It was kind of inevitable It
imposes a little challenge for us, but
it's one we can take gracefully."
According to Gruenewald. the Band
was planning on making some serious
changes in its format anyway.
"We have explored the limits ot out
rageousness." he said. "We're work
ing on a new format for next year, and
no, I don't care to elaborate on what it
is."
'Nevertheless, he elaborated.
"We've got some ideas. Like, we
may do some running jokes," he said.
"Every game we wodld build on it to
keep the audience on its toes. And
we've got some other ideas, but I hon
estly don't think we'll do anything the
Athletic Dept. would object to."
Senior Bill Hunter, a veteran band
member, was equally unflustered by
the prospects of an advisory group.
I think a committee which can
make recommendations to the Band is
a good idea." he said. "I've heard
rumors that the Band needs to change
for a while. But the problem is finding
a new direction to go in. and thtft has
not come up as of yet."
Still, Hunter was careful to point otit

the benefits of keeping the Band a
strictly student-run operation.
"Having it be student-run is a good
idea and I think we've done a good
job." he said. "You'd be surprised, but
the band director will often say 'you
gotta be careful here . . .' and I think
we usually make the right choice."
Drum major Patti Rose was more
wary of the University, however. Al
though she attributes her sensitivity
on the issue to a "paranoia along the
lines of 19X1." she did mention that
some band members, herself in
cluded. were very opposed to the idea
of the panel.
"I don't think we'll present our
shows (to the panel) before we do
them." she claimed "It's up in the
air, but it's our decision. Theo
retically. we could say no. we won't
do it' and then there would be a con
frontation. I don't know."
According to Rose, an employee of
the Athletic Dept. informed her that if
the Band didn't comply, they might be
"barricaded from the stadium."
'' 1 told that to some guys in the Band
and they said great! Let them try
it.' " she said
But then, after thinking it over.
Rose added: "I don't think there'll be
any problem I think they < the Univer
sity I are glad to have us but nobody is
allowed to say it."
Cavalli. who will serve as chairman
of the informal panel, readily admits
to being "all for the band." however.
"I spent the good part ot the last
seven years defending the Band, he
said. "The other people on the com
mittee are definitely Band advocates,
too. We would never forceably re
strain them."


The incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band adds music and fun at a football game. The
band is thinking of planning their programs in new diree-

fall to help give feedback and input into some of their pro
gram ideas.
