# Rhodes, Marshall scholar selection begins
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
Football player Pat Haden,
singer Kris Kristofferson and
Asst. History Prot. Stephen
Ferruolo have more in common
than meets the eye.
All three were Rhodes Schol
ars: individuals who have dem
onstrated "literary and scholas
tic attainments; truthfulness,
courage, devotion to duty, ex
hibition of moral force of char
acter and of instincts to lead;
and physical vigor, as shown by
fondness for and success in
sports." Among other things.
Each year, 32 candidates are
chosen in the United States to
spend two years of study at Ox
ford University in England. The
scholarship is made possible
through the stipends willed by
philanthropist Cecil Rhodes.
A similar and equally com
petitive honor is the Marshall
Scholarship which is awarded to
30 U.S. citizens and provides
two years of study in any British
university.
Last year, Stanford boasted
two winners, Peter Stamos and
Ann Thrupp, who received the
Rhodes and Marshall respec
tively.
Ferruolo, a scholar in '71, is
currently chairing the Stanford

Rhodes/Marshall panel, a com
mittee interviewing all Stanford
applicants for either scholar
ship.
"The committee interviews
and evaluates prospective
Rhodes/Marshall candidates
from Stanford to provide people
with an institutional endorse
ment. We try to mimic the in
terview they will receive in the
Fall," explained Ferruolo.
"The real question is why
more Stanford students don't
apply," said Ferruolo citing dis
interest or lack of confidence as
two probable reasons. He em
phasized that an outstanding
candidate in some area, be it
leadership or athletics or aca
demics, ought to apply.
Every applicant auto
matically receives a review
from the Stanford committee in
early October. Students here
face an unusual deadline pres
sure because the quarter starts
later than most colleges and the
state and regional committees
expect completed applications
by October 3 st. Both Ferruolo
and Marcia Makino, fellowships
advisor at the Overseas Re
source Center at Bechtel, men
tioned that interested students
should begin their application

now. Makino encouraged can
didates to attend an informa
tional meeting at Bechtel
tomorrow to learn more about
the process.
"We don't provide a blanket
letter of endorsement. We send
a critical evaluation to the state
or regional committee," she
added.
Students from states other
than Calitornia attending the
University can apply either
through their own state or
through Stanford. In fact, resi
dents from smaller states have
a "slight edge" over Californi
ans who apply through Stanford
as each state can only nominate
two finalists.
Makino and Ferruolo men
tioned that though athletic dis
tinction is a factor in the Rhodes
selection process, it certainly is
not a crucial determinant.
Makino called it an "asset" but
"definitely not required."
Recognizing the pre
professional orientation of
many students here, Ferruolo
commented on the value of the
scholarship. "It's not like going
directly to law or biz school but I
don't see why people should be
so anxious to rush right up the
ladder. It's a chance for two

years of completely paid for
graduate study. And, the
stipend is more than adequate,"
he assured potential candidates.
Ninety-nine percent of the
students applying submit ap
plications to both Rhodes and
Marshall committees. "If
you're interested in a British
program and have a strong rea
son to go, don't undersell your
self." advised Makino.
