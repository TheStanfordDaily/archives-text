### Karen Halbo With reports trom the Daily wire services 
"I think a third party will
have to build a platform based
on new values." said John An
derson Monday night at Kresge
Auditorium. Anderson spoke
with Hoover Fellow Seymour
Martin Lipset and Political Sci
ence Prof. Nelson Paulsby ot
U.C.-Berkeley on the possibility
ot adding a third party to the
American political system.
Anderson prefaced his re
marks by stating he gave "no
comment" to the question he
was asked earlier in the day as
to whether he would be forming
a third party to run in the 1984
presidential race
Reporters questioned An
derson about the fund-raising
letters that he has mailed to the
50,000 supporters of his '980
presidential campaign,
The letter is a preliminary ef
fort by Anderson to see if there
is enough interest in a serious
challenge to the two major
parties in both the 1982 local,
state and congressional elec
tions and the 1984 presidential
campaign, according to the As
sociated Press.
The letter said Anderson's in
dependent candidacy last year
raised issues ignored by the two
major parties. After the first
mailing May 18, a second one is
planned to an additional 250,000
potential contributors.
The money will be spent to
send Anderson to meet with sup
porters around the country, to
publish a newsletter and to pay
the salaries of a Washington
staff, including speech writers
and schedulers.
During the forum, Anderson
discussed the possibility of

torming a third party, and
stated his belief in the need for a
third party. Anderson said the
need is especially evident when
examined alongside the issue of
the possibility of winning a tac
tical nuclear war.
Anderson said "the probabili
ty of winning a nuclear war is
the kind of issue to bring to the
people to create a peace party, a
third party."
"The two parties (the Demo
crats and the Republicans)
grow closer and closer together
on the issue of nuclear war."
said Anderson
Anderson cited an effort
made by Democrats in Congress
last week to add money to the

Reagan defense budget as an ex
ample of the convergence of
views ot the two main parties
Characterizing the present
mood of the country. Anderson
said there is "a wave of materi
alism that I find shocking "
He concluded his remarks by
saying that a third party is
needed to "build a new spirit of
community in this country."
Lipset and Paulsby also ad
dressed the issue of the creation
of a third party in the American
political system
Lipset. who cited the unsuc
cessful history ot third party
movements in the United
States, gave a pessimistic out
look of the possibility of forming

a third party, saying, "change
in the electoral svstem is unlike
ly "
Paulsby spoke on party or
ganizations in the United States
and he said there were several
levels within the two-party sys
tem that should be examined
Paulsby also spoke of the
parties as an economizing force,
a simple way for people to think
about and summarize their own
political views.
In explaining l' S. politics,
"you join a party it you want to
get elected cither the in'
party or the out party." said
Paulsbv.
