# Churchman sees 'immoral values' guiding U.S. policy in El Salvador
## 
### Leah Halper 
Shifts in values are "creating a new immoral
basis for foreign policy," said William Wiptler of
the National Council of Churches on Monday.
Wipfler warned that the implications tor El
Salvador and Central America are especially seri
ous.
"I call it immoral because it is characterized
by a lack of concern for the poor, no support tor
self-determination, an increased tolerance tor vi
olence, sanction of military means for solving so
cial and political problems, the use ol peoples'
fear of communism to build a support base, and a
testing of America's tolerance tor racism by de
eming it less important to kill others of another
race."
Wiptler, head of the NCC's Human Rights Of
fice. told a small group ot listeners at the Meyer
Forum Room workshop that Americans can "con
cretize" the situation by imagining that reports of
kidnappings, torture, and a climbing death-toll is
sue from Boston rather than El Salvador. In addi
tion, he called for an understanding of historical
and geographical circumstances which are "dis
torted and misinformed" in the U.S. press.
His own work with church groups, citizens, and
the martyred Archbishop Oscar Romero in El
Salvador has given him an understanding of the
100 year struggle for agrarian reform and human
rights, Wiptler said. Despite prohibitions and re
pression after the 1932 army massacres of more
than 30,i30*3 peasants, Wiptler learned, urban la
borers, peasants, students, professors, and
church groups have been organizing for years in
El Salvador in mass groups crossing class lines.
U.S. policy has only undercut these efforts, he be
lieves.
"Salvadorans believe in democratic processes.
We forget the number ot democratic governments
that appeared in Latin America at the beginning
ot the 19605. There were elected governments in a

number of countries but the U S chose not to put
its cards in the fragile democratic leadership ap
pearing even in El Salvador at the time, where
there was an elected government for four
months.' Instead, he said, the U.S. invested in po
lice and military training
Quoting a U.S. general's speech to corporate
leaders. Wipfler pointed out that "a small amount
of money in military assistance is a very modest
insurance policy protecting our vast investments
in Central America. That the U.S. has dropped
important human rights provisions and the entire
second plan of the proposed three-tier agrarian
reform effort indicates that the Reagan adminis
tration is willing to leave power in El Salvador in
the hands of the military elite, he added, despite
vocal support for moderate civilian figureheads.
"Last year under Carter's human rights policy.
30,000 people died in El Salvador. How many will
die under Reagan's anti-terrorist policy? The
ante has been upped now that we've increased aid
from a total of $17 million in the years 1950 to 977
to $35 million in military assistance this year." In
the first quarter of 198 alone, he said, 6000 people
died in El Salvador, often by torture, repeat bom
bings or massacre.
Though U.S. churches have responded to the sit
uation "heartwarjriingly," Wipfler warned that
many Americans are basing their judgments of
the situation on incomplete or inaccurate in
formation from reporters who never leave the
U.S. Embassy or their holels.
Wipfler spoke at the invitation of the Latin
American Studies Department and the El
Salvador Solidarity Committee as part of the Na
tional Week of Solidarity with El Salvador. The
on-campus observation of the week will include a
number of dorm-based workshops and will cul
minate Saturday in a symposium on Central
America to be held in Kresge.

lice and military training
Quoting a U.S. general's speech to corporate
leaders. Wipfler pointed out that "a small amount
of money in military assistance is a very modest
insurance policy protecting our vast investments
in Central America. That the U.S. has dropped
important human rights provisions and the entire
second plan of the proposed three-tier agrarian
reform effort indicates that the Reagan adminis
tration is willing to leave power in El Salvador in
the hands of the military elite, he added, despite
vocal support for moderate civilian figureheads.
"Last year under Carter's human rights policy.
30,000 people died in El Salvador. How many will
die under Reagan's anti-terrorist policy? The
ante has been upped now that we've increased aid
from a total of $17 million in the years 1950 to 977
to $35 million in military assistance this year." In
the first quarter of 198 alone, he said, 6000 people
died in El Salvador, often by torture, repeat bom
bings or massacre.
Though U.S. churches have responded to the sit
uation "heartwarjriingly," Wipfler warned that
many Americans are basing their judgments of
the situation on incomplete or inaccurate in
formation from reporters who never leave the
U.S. Embassy or their holels.
Wipfler spoke at the invitation of the Latin
American Studies Department and the El
Salvador Solidarity Committee as part of the Na
tional Week of Solidarity with El Salvador. The
on-campus observation of the week will include a
number of dorm-based workshops and will cul
minate Saturday in a symposium on Central
America to be held in Kresge.
