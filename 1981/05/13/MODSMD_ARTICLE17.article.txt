## Fighting for our survival in the nuclear age 
### 
A New York journalist
writes:
"The increasing possibility of
nuclear catastrophe is the fun
damental premise ot opposition
to the administration in the age
ot Reagan. Specific instances of
protest — from El Salvador to
cuts in social spending — are ul
timately contained in resistance
to the most terminal menace of
all. . . Nuclear power in its mil
itary and subsequent civilian
guise is the ultimate threat to
society and remains the most
compelling, the most moral
motive tor protest."
For those who are emotional
ly convinced of the possibility of
nuclear catastrophe, like my
self, statements like the above
seem self-evident. Yet, some
how. opposition to nuclear
weapons — the most compelling
and most moral ot protest — has
not yet materialized in this
country on a level com
mensurate with the threat. Al
though opposition has been
growing in recent months, there
still exists a general lack of con
cern orv the part of a vast ma
jority ot Americans with regard
to the dangers ot the nuclear
arms race.
. Complacency and indif
ference to nuclear power on the

part of the general public have
fostered a propitious environ
ment tor the emergence ot vari
ous theories advocating "lim
ited" nuclear wars, or the possi
bility of "winning" a nuclear
war.
One even hears nowadays
from hawks in the executive and
nuclear strategists in the Pen
tagon that a general nuclear
war will only constitute a set
back to civilization but will not
profoundly change it. Alexander
Haig even goes so far to say
"there are worse things than nu
clear war."
But are there really? Accord
ing to an estimate made by the
first Congress ot International
Phvisicians for the Prevention
of Nuclear War:
"... 50 percent of the nucle
ar weapons in the arsenals of the
United States and USSR in 1985
will deplete 80 percent of the
ozone in the northern hemi
sphere and 30 to 40 percent in the
southern hemisphere. A deple
tion of 20 percent will suffice to
cause blinding unprotected
animals on earth. During that
time every creature living on
land that could not sheild itself
from the ultraviolet rays would
most probably be blinded and
die."

If this estimate is correct
then who will survive the long
term effects of general nuclear
war? The answer is no one.
Clearly, from this perspective,
we must conclude there is noth
ing irorse than nuclear ware.
Even surrender would be pref
erable to the mass annhilation
of the human race.
Obviously, there is only one
long term solution to the men
ace of nuclear war, and that is
disarmament. But there is no
reason to believe that, given the
poor record of arms control
over the past 35 years, disarma
ment will ever become a sincere
policy of the United States and
the Soviet Union, or of any nu
clear power tor that matter. In
fact, the most influential forces
now operating within the U.S.
government are advocating a
vast escalation of the nuclear
arms race. The only hope for
disarmament efforts in the
future lies in the rallying politi
cal force of national and in
ternational protest movements
organized by the people.
Narrow-minded political and
mora-l considerations ot our
leaders, often under the guise of
"technical" or "national secur
ity" rationalizations tor the es
calation ot the arms race, re

main the greatest obstacles to
an effective disarmament
movement in this country and
around the world. Most people
find themselves unable to argue
with the "experts" about the
arms race who seem to have all
the facts and figures at their dis
posal.
The present administration
has brought in many of these ex
perts who use their statistics to
prove "the Soviet Union is seek
ing nuclear superiority over the
United States" or "the Soviet
Union is looking to win a nuclear
war over the United States,"
both assertions being used to
justify an escalation of the arms
race. And how can one disprove
them, if one is simply unaware
of the basic facts of the situ
ation? Obviously, one can not.
The only way to refute such as
sertions is to learn the basic
facts tor yourself and see wheth
er the evidence supports or re
jects a certain interpretation.
Luckily, people in the Stan
ford area will have the op
portunity to-get information on
this vital issue in coming weeks
because of the efforts of con
cerned students and faculty.
The Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Forum is spon
soring Weapons Crisis Week
from May 26-30. The week will
feature debates and lectures
from leading arms control and
disarmament experts from the
Stanford community and around
the world including professors
Barton Bernstein. Sidney Drell
and W. H. K Panofsky. Weapons
Crisis Week will be the perfect
opportunity for those concerned
to gain a factual understanding
of the arms race and a basis for
an active opposition to future es
calation pressures from the mil
itary and the administration.
Maybe everyone won't learn all
the numbers or all the in
tricacies of the latest develop
ments. but everyone can learn
enough to understand the moral
and political assumptions be
hind all of the various technical
arguments.
Man has never built a weapon
he has not subsequently used.
There is no reason to believe
that this rule will not apply to
the present stockpile of nuclear
weapons. Our only answer then
is to get rid ot them while we
still can.
Nuclear weapons remain
symbols ot diplomatic power,
prestige and security for the
leaders of most national govern
ments. Power is one concept

that every leader understands
well and one commodity h$
clings to with tenacity. So dis
armament will never take place
without strong pressure from
national and international pro
test movements opposing the
arms race.
A potential lor international
consensus exists on this issue,
since one factor unites all of us:
our biological instinct for sur
vival. This potential is inhibited
by the strong psychological ob
stacles to a sustained, well or
ganized opposition to nuclear
weapons. As one journalist puts
it: "What has been missing are
ways to make the issue of war
itselt live in our imagination
without reducing us to despair
our callousness."
There are no easy solutions to
avoid this psychological dilem
ma, but getting involved in this
issue does not mean giving up all
of your personal concerns. It
just means making arms con
trol and disarmament one of
them. One need not occupy
oneself with doomsday pro
clamations: besides, involve
ment is a life-affirming proposi
tion.
What is desperatley needed is
a starting point, a theme around
which to organize a mass, in
ternational opposition move
ment. What should be the con
tent of this theme, and to whom
shall we address it? George F.
Kennan — career diplomat and
former Cold Warrior — has
thought on such theme to say to
the decision makers of the two
superpowers:
"For the love of God, of your
children, and of the civilization
to which you belong, cease this
madness. You have a duty not
just to the generation of the
present, you have a duty to civ
ilization's past which you
threaten to render meaningless
and to its future, which you
threaten to render non-existent.
You are mortal men. You are
capable of error. You have no
right to hold in you hands —
there is no wise enough and
strong enough to hold in his
hands — destructive power suf
ficient to put an end to civilized
life on a great portion of our
planet. No one should wish to
hold such powers. Thrust them
from you. The risks you might
thereby assume are not greater
— could not be greater — than
those which you are now incur
ring for us all.

For those who are emotional

seem self-evident. Yet, some
how. opposition to nuclear
weapons — the most compelling
and most moral ot protest — has
not yet materialized in this
country on a level com

though opposition has been
growing in recent months, there
still exists a general lack of con

jority ot Americans with regard
to the dangers ot the nuclear
arms race.
. Complacency and indif
ference to nuclear power on the

part of the general public have
fostered a propitious environ

ous theories advocating "lim

bility of "winning" a nuclear
war.
One even hears nowadays
from hawks in the executive and
nuclear strategists in the Pen
tagon that a general nuclear
war will only constitute a set
back to civilization but will not
profoundly change it. Alexander
Haig even goes so far to say
"there are worse things than nu
clear war."
But are there really? Accord
ing to an estimate made by the
first Congress ot International
Phvisicians for the Prevention
of Nuclear War:
"... 50 percent of the nucle
ar weapons in the arsenals of the
United States and USSR in 1985
will deplete 80 percent of the
ozone in the northern hemi
sphere and 30 to 40 percent in the
southern hemisphere. A deple
tion of 20 percent will suffice to
cause blinding unprotected
animals on earth. During that
time every creature living on
land that could not sheild itself
from the ultraviolet rays would
most probably be blinded and
die."

If this estimate is correct
then who will survive the long
term effects of general nuclear
war? The answer is no one.
Clearly, from this perspective,
we must conclude there is noth
ing irorse than nuclear ware.
Even surrender would be pref

of the human race.
Obviously, there is only one
long term solution to the men
ace of nuclear war, and that is
disarmament. But there is no
reason to believe that, given the
poor record of arms control
over the past 35 years, disarma
ment will ever become a sincere
policy of the United States and
the Soviet Union, or of any nu
clear power tor that matter. In
fact, the most influential forces
now operating within the U.S.
government are advocating a
vast escalation of the nuclear
arms race. The only hope for
disarmament efforts in the
future lies in the rallying politi

ternational protest movements
organized by the people.
Narrow-minded political and
mora-l considerations ot our
leaders, often under the guise of
"technical" or "national secur

movement in this country and
around the world. Most people
find themselves unable to argue
with the "experts" about the
arms race who seem to have all

The present administration
has brought in many of these ex

prove "the Soviet Union is seek

United States" or "the Soviet
Union is looking to win a nuclear
war over the United States,"
both assertions being used to
justify an escalation of the arms
race. And how can one disprove
them, if one is simply unaware
of the basic facts of the situ

The only way to refute such as

Crisis Week will be the perfect

Man has never built a weapon

There is no reason to believe
that this rule will not apply to
the present stockpile of nuclear

Nuclear weapons remain
symbols ot diplomatic power,
prestige and security for the
leaders of most national govern

that every leader understands
well and one commodity h$
clings to with tenacity. So dis
armament will never take place
without strong pressure from
national and international pro
test movements opposing the
arms race.
A potential lor international
consensus exists on this issue,
since one factor unites all of us:
our biological instinct for sur
vival. This potential is inhibited
by the strong psychological ob
stacles to a sustained, well or
ganized opposition to nuclear
weapons. As one journalist puts
it: "What has been missing are
ways to make the issue of war
itselt live in our imagination
without reducing us to despair
our callousness."
There are no easy solutions to
avoid this psychological dilem

issue does not mean giving up all
of your personal concerns. It
just means making arms con

them. One need not occupy
oneself with doomsday pro

What is desperatley needed is
a starting point, a theme around

there is no wise enough and

A New York journalist
writes:
"The increasing possibility of
nuclear catastrophe is the fun
damental premise ot opposition
to the administration in the age
ot Reagan. Specific instances of
protest — from El Salvador to
cuts in social spending — are ul
timately contained in resistance
to the most terminal menace of
all. . . Nuclear power in its mil
itary and subsequent civilian
guise is the ultimate threat to
society and remains the most
compelling, the most moral
motive tor protest."
For those who are emotional
ly convinced of the possibility of
nuclear catastrophe, like my
self, statements like the above
seem self-evident. Yet, some
how. opposition to nuclear
weapons — the most compelling
and most moral ot protest — has
not yet materialized in this
country on a level com
mensurate with the threat. Al
though opposition has been
growing in recent months, there
still exists a general lack of con
cern orv the part of a vast ma
jority ot Americans with regard
to the dangers ot the nuclear
arms race.
. Complacency and indif
ference to nuclear power on the

part of the general public have
fostered a propitious environ
ment tor the emergence ot vari
ous theories advocating "lim
ited" nuclear wars, or the possi
bility of "winning" a nuclear
war.
One even hears nowadays
from hawks in the executive and
nuclear strategists in the Pen
tagon that a general nuclear
war will only constitute a set
back to civilization but will not
profoundly change it. Alexander
Haig even goes so far to say
"there are worse things than nu
clear war."
But are there really? Accord
ing to an estimate made by the
first Congress ot International
Phvisicians for the Prevention
of Nuclear War:
"... 50 percent of the nucle
ar weapons in the arsenals of the
United States and USSR in 1985
will deplete 80 percent of the
ozone in the northern hemi
sphere and 30 to 40 percent in the
southern hemisphere. A deple
tion of 20 percent will suffice to
cause blinding unprotected
animals on earth. During that
time every creature living on
land that could not sheild itself
from the ultraviolet rays would
most probably be blinded and
die."

If this estimate is correct
then who will survive the long
term effects of general nuclear
war? The answer is no one.
Clearly, from this perspective,
we must conclude there is noth
ing irorse than nuclear ware.
Even surrender would be pref
erable to the mass annhilation
of the human race.
Obviously, there is only one
long term solution to the men
ace of nuclear war, and that is
disarmament. But there is no
reason to believe that, given the
poor record of arms control
over the past 35 years, disarma
ment will ever become a sincere
policy of the United States and
the Soviet Union, or of any nu
clear power tor that matter. In
fact, the most influential forces
now operating within the U.S.
government are advocating a
vast escalation of the nuclear
arms race. The only hope for
disarmament efforts in the
future lies in the rallying politi
cal force of national and in
ternational protest movements
organized by the people.
Narrow-minded political and
mora-l considerations ot our
leaders, often under the guise of
"technical" or "national secur
ity" rationalizations tor the es
calation ot the arms race, re

main the greatest obstacles to
an effective disarmament
movement in this country and
around the world. Most people
find themselves unable to argue
with the "experts" about the
arms race who seem to have all
the facts and figures at their dis
posal.
The present administration
has brought in many of these ex
perts who use their statistics to
prove "the Soviet Union is seek
ing nuclear superiority over the
United States" or "the Soviet
Union is looking to win a nuclear
war over the United States,"
both assertions being used to
justify an escalation of the arms
race. And how can one disprove
them, if one is simply unaware
of the basic facts of the situ
ation? Obviously, one can not.
The only way to refute such as
sertions is to learn the basic
facts tor yourself and see wheth
er the evidence supports or re
jects a certain interpretation.
Luckily, people in the Stan
ford area will have the op
portunity to-get information on
this vital issue in coming weeks
because of the efforts of con
cerned students and faculty.
The Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Forum is spon
soring Weapons Crisis Week
from May 26-30. The week will
feature debates and lectures
from leading arms control and
disarmament experts from the
Stanford community and around
the world including professors
Barton Bernstein. Sidney Drell
and W. H. K Panofsky. Weapons
Crisis Week will be the perfect
opportunity for those concerned
to gain a factual understanding
of the arms race and a basis for
an active opposition to future es
calation pressures from the mil
itary and the administration.
Maybe everyone won't learn all
the numbers or all the in
tricacies of the latest develop
ments. but everyone can learn
enough to understand the moral
and political assumptions be
hind all of the various technical
arguments.
Man has never built a weapon
he has not subsequently used.
There is no reason to believe
that this rule will not apply to
the present stockpile of nuclear
weapons. Our only answer then
is to get rid ot them while we
still can.
Nuclear weapons remain
symbols ot diplomatic power,
prestige and security for the
leaders of most national govern
ments. Power is one concept

that every leader understands
well and one commodity h$
clings to with tenacity. So dis
armament will never take place
without strong pressure from
national and international pro
test movements opposing the
arms race.
A potential lor international
consensus exists on this issue,
since one factor unites all of us:
our biological instinct for sur
vival. This potential is inhibited
by the strong psychological ob
stacles to a sustained, well or
ganized opposition to nuclear
weapons. As one journalist puts
it: "What has been missing are
ways to make the issue of war
itselt live in our imagination
without reducing us to despair
our callousness."
There are no easy solutions to
avoid this psychological dilem
ma, but getting involved in this
issue does not mean giving up all
of your personal concerns. It
just means making arms con
trol and disarmament one of
them. One need not occupy
oneself with doomsday pro
clamations: besides, involve
ment is a life-affirming proposi
tion.
What is desperatley needed is
a starting point, a theme around
which to organize a mass, in
ternational opposition move
ment. What should be the con
tent of this theme, and to whom
shall we address it? George F.
Kennan — career diplomat and
former Cold Warrior — has
thought on such theme to say to
the decision makers of the two
superpowers:
"For the love of God, of your
children, and of the civilization
to which you belong, cease this
madness. You have a duty not
just to the generation of the
present, you have a duty to civ
ilization's past which you
threaten to render meaningless
and to its future, which you
threaten to render non-existent.
You are mortal men. You are
capable of error. You have no
right to hold in you hands —
there is no wise enough and
strong enough to hold in his
hands — destructive power suf
ficient to put an end to civilized
life on a great portion of our
planet. No one should wish to
hold such powers. Thrust them
from you. The risks you might
thereby assume are not greater
— could not be greater — than
those which you are now incur
ring for us all.
