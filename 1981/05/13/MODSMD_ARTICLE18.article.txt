## Arabs don't want our AWACS 
### 
The Mac Nelly cartoon <Dai-
ly. May 4) viciously depicted the
Saudi Arabs as anti-Semites
who aim to use the AWACS
planes to "hunt" Jews. The
caricature was not only totally
lacking in consideration for the
feelings ot the Arab students at
Stanford, it was also completely
wrong from A factual point of
view. By the publication of this
caricature, the Daily proves
either of two things: that it is
part ot the monopoly which Zi
onism has on the American
mind and conscience through its
almost complete penetration of
America's mainstream mass
media, or it proves that the Dai
ly is simply ignorant of some
basic facts regarding the
AWACS affair. In hope that the
latter alternative is correct. I
send you the following facts:
1.) Saudi Arabians have never
fired a single shot at Israel (de
spite a symbolic participation in
the 1948 war). And while this is
not something to be proud of in
light ot Israel's continuous ag
gression against the Arab and
Muslim people and in light of the
fact that Israel actually oc
cupies a tew Saudi islands in the
Gulf ot Aqabah. it is a fact which
defeats your characterizing the
Saudis as "Jew Hunters":
2 ) Jews have experienced the
best, most prosperous, most
peaceful periods of their history
under Arab and Islamic rule
Any fair textbook of Jewish his
tory would tell you that Hence,
it is both vicious and factually
wrong to label Arabs or
Muslims as "Jew Hunters":
3.»lronically, it would be fair,
using your own terminology, to
label Israelis as "Arab
Hunters " Since its estab
lishment in 1948. Israel has dis-'
placed more than 3 million
Palestinians, more than 3 mil
lion other Arabs, and has killed
more than millon Arabs
(Palestinians and non-Palesti
nians t. It continues to kill Arabs

on a daily basis in Lebanon and
elsewhere either directly
through raids or indirectly
through the use of stooges like
Saad Haddad;
4 ) The few Saudis whom the
ruling house ot Saud can trust
are too incompetent to use the
AWACS against anybody. Even
if these toys are not piloted by
Americans, which is very un
likely. the information they get
will definitely require Ameri
can expertise and knowledge;
5.) Israel and Jews are two
separate entities: they are not
one and the same as your
caricature implies. Israel is a
settler state established at the
expense ot the Palestinian peo
ple: Jews are the followers ot a
respected religion. And while
Arabs and Muslims hold Israel
responsible for the slaughter
and displacement of their kin,
they have nothing against Jews;
6.) We do not want your
A U' U N. Due to the strings and
conditions that will be attached

to their sale and due to the mi
serable state of incompetence
of the Saudi armed forces, the
AWACS will only serve one
purpose: reinforce American
presence in the Middle East.
Finally, while the Arab stu
dents at Stanford respect the
Daily's right to express its opin
ion on the sale of the AWACS.
they strongly object to your ra
cist, defaming means of doing
so.

tory would tell you that Hence,
it is both vicious and factually
wrong to label Arabs or
Muslims as "Jew Hunters":
3.»lronically, it would be fair,
using your own terminology, to
label Israelis as "Arab
Hunters " Since its estab
lishment in 1948. Israel has dis-'
placed more than 3 million
Palestinians, more than 3 mil
lion other Arabs, and has killed
more than millon Arabs
(Palestinians and non-Palesti
nians t. It continues to kill Arabs

on a daily basis in Lebanon and
elsewhere either directly
through raids or indirectly
through the use of stooges like
Saad Haddad;
4 ) The few Saudis whom the
ruling house ot Saud can trust
are too incompetent to use the
AWACS against anybody. Even
if these toys are not piloted by
Americans, which is very un
likely. the information they get
will definitely require Ameri
can expertise and knowledge;
5.) Israel and Jews are two
separate entities: they are not
one and the same as your
caricature implies. Israel is a
settler state established at the
expense ot the Palestinian peo
ple: Jews are the followers ot a
respected religion. And while
Arabs and Muslims hold Israel
responsible for the slaughter
and displacement of their kin,
they have nothing against Jews;
6.) We do not want your
A U' U N. Due to the strings and
conditions that will be attached

to their sale and due to the mi
serable state of incompetence
of the Saudi armed forces, the
AWACS will only serve one
purpose: reinforce American
presence in the Middle East.
Finally, while the Arab stu
dents at Stanford respect the
Daily's right to express its opin
ion on the sale of the AWACS.
they strongly object to your ra
cist, defaming means of doing
so.
