As I pointed out in an earlier
column (Daily, Apr. 27), politi
cal discussion in this country is
increasingly substituting name
calling and vicious falsehoods
for reasoned argument An ex
ample is Douglas Smith's letter
i Daily, Apr. 301 Which accuses
me of lying
It is revealing that Smith does
not quote directly anv alleged
falsehood by me; rather, he con
cocts a demonstrably false
statement in his own words,
claims without proof or evi
dence that I believe this false
statement, and concludes that I
therefore lied
This kind of argument is. to
put it mildly, irresponsible.
1 did claim that Smith in his
earlier column dealing with gun
control mentioned only two spe
cific examples relating to gun

control — Texas and the District
of Columbia. I then pointed out
— on my oun authority and not
qmttin.u Smith — that the D.C.
homicide rate was in tact slight
ly lower than the Texas rate.
Smith could have marginally
strengthened his case against
gun control by citing this tact in
his original column, but he
didn't do so and I didn't claim
that he did.
Smith's accusation that I lied
is apparently based on the mis
taken belief that I accused him
of citing this piece of data which
he did not cite but which would
have strengthened his case if he
had cited it He is apparently an
gry because he believes that my
whole discussion was simply
knocking down the "straw
man which is set up by this
"lie."
In fact, my criticism of Smith
was not based on his citing or
not citing this little piece of
data Rather. I criticized Smith
tor claiming on the basis of only
two examples that the case for
gun control was "closed " I
pointed out that one can prove
almost anything with only two
examples, and that more com

prehensive studies disagreed
with Smith's conclusions.
Smith did not dispute these
arguments and I'm alraid that
they still stand.
The larger issue here is
neither gun control per sr nor
Smith's Alice-in-Wonderland
fantasies but rather his reckless
irresponsibility in labelling an
argument a "lie" simply be
cause he was unable to under
stand it or found it emotionally
disturbing.
Like most people. I don't like
being called a liar, especially by
someone whose claim is based
not on any direct statement of
mine but only on a careless mis
reading ot what I ve written
Perhaps if I'd written my col
umn more carefully, it would
not have been misunderstood by
Smith and we could have been
spared his angry outburst and
name-calling However, even if
the column could have' been
clearer Smith had no justifi
cation whatsoever for engaging
in libel and dubbing me a liar.
It is Smith, not I. who is guilty
of stating a vicious, ir
responsible. and libelous
falsehood I do not believe Smith

was lying, for "to lie" means to
knowingly and intentionally
present a falsehood. On the con
trary, I suspect that Smith's
falsehood was the result not of
malicious intent but only of in
tellectual carelessness, moral
irresponsibility, an emotional
trauma in the area ot firearms,
and a pronounced inability or
unwillingness to engage in
analytical reasoning.
However, even this more gen
erous interpfetation does not
excuse Smith's actions The ver
bal vandalism and vicious silli
ness which Smith chose to prac
tice ought to be expunged from
political debate in this country.
