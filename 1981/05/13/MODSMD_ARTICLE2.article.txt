## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
The list of gsa'duation requfrements
at the University nidV be extended to
include the study ot a toreign language
if the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies' (CUS) proposal is adopted by
the Faculty Senate on Thursday
Beginning with the freshman class
entering in 982, the committee is rec
ommending that students satisfy one
of the following:
— completion of the third quarter of
first-year language study at Stanford.
— demonstration by exam of com
petency at a level comparable to one
year ot study at Stanford: or
— completion of a third-year course
of one toreign language in high school
Committee member Ralph Hester,
professor of French and Italian, said
CUS has been discussing foreign lan
guage for ten years He said that the
discussions became more focused in
1976 when a resolution by the Senate ot
the Academic Council directing the
University to study ways to encourage'
toreign language studies.
According to Hester, the resolution
was designed to encourage students to
fulfill the humanities distribution re
quirement with a toreign language
After first year languages no longer
completed the humanities require
ment, a change in University policy
required students to take the language
for two years in order to fulfill the re
quirement
Hester said the new distribution re
quirements adopted last year are "one
more step to discourage foreign lan
guage " because language can no long
er fulfill any of the distribution re
quirements. "CUS had to do some
thing,'' he said
Hester pointed out that all the Ivy
League schools and California state
universities require foreign language
to graduate.
This is not a terribly strong meas
ure because an increasing number of
freshmen will meet the requirement
before getting here," hesaid. Students
who have taken three years of foreign
language in high school or enough to
pass a test indicating competency
comparable to one year's study at
Stanford will have fulfilled the re
quirement on arrival at Stanford.
Assoc. History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, chairman ot CUS, said the
proposed language requirement is in
tended both to encourage foreign lan
guage study by students in high school

as well as at Stanford
Studies by the admissions office
have shown that about 98 percent of all
entering freshmen have completed
two years of toreign language About
35 percent have had three years or
more, while 27 percent have had four
years or more in high school
Hester pointed out that foreign lan
guage "is. ot course, a national con
cern and that former President Jim
my Carter established a commission
to study the lack ot foreign language

proficiency among American stu
dents
Too many students are not doing
anything" in a foreign language, both
here and nationally, according to
Lougee
The new requirement, it adopted,
will require more language classes,
and thus additional funding Lougee
indicated that while no firm figures
will be available until the fall, the im
pact is likely to be in the tens of
thousands of dollars
