## Japan views military spending 
### 
Recently, there has been
American pressure on Japan to
increase defense spending. This
pressure is based upon two
arguments. First, that it is a le
gitimate request of the United
States on Japan to have "ap
propriate" armed forces as she
has succeeded in building a
strong economy under the mili
tary umbrella (specifically its
nuclear "umbrella") without
paying the due cost of the na
tional security. This is the so
called" Free Rider Theory," fre
quently expressed by those who
are suffering from an excess of
Japanese cars in the American

market. The second argument is
that it is Japan's duty to take a
responsible military role in
maintaining the regional secur
ity of the Far East as a member
nation of the Allied Forces. This
would help the United States
cope with Communist ex
pansionism in other corners of
the world.
The Japanese defense budget
is disproportionately small
compared to her economic
power (0.9 percent of GNP v&5.0
tor the United States). The Unit
ed States would ask Japan to in
crease her defense spending to
some "appropriate" level, in
terms ot a definite percentage
of the GNP.
Fortunately, Prime Minister
Zenko Suzuki so far has ruled
out any major military in
itiatives.
Instead, he has decided on the
alternative of setting a future
date for achieving a modest
buildup to a level originally
planned in 1976(Daily, April 28).
This is quite a right judgment
as a Japanese top political lead
er, but there seems to be some
misunderstanding over this is
sue in America. In hoping to pro
mote American understanding,
I here will mention how the con
temporary Japanese see the is
sue and point out some negative
reactions which would be
caused by a rapid military
buildup in Japan.
Though it is a strong argu
ment in America to press Japan
to strengthen her armed forces
by appealing to the nationalistic
feeling of the American people
who are menaced by the flood of
competitive Japanese cars and
electronic goods, this argument
is misleading because it
criticizes Japan by putting
causes and effects of the
Japanese economic growth up
side down. Certainly there may
have been an intuitive calcu
lation in the mind ot the late
Prime Minister Shigeru
Yoshida when he insisted on the
"Economy First Principle"
within the shield of the so called
"Mac Arthur Constitution." He
correctly judged that milita
rism was not the future course
ot Japan. The Japanese people
have accepted, with at least
some sense ot reality, the de
nunciation of war as a means to
settle international disputes.
Proudly written in the Preface
ot the present Japanese Con
stitution is the phrase "We,
Japanese, denounce forever
war as a means to settle interna
tional disputes by trusting in the
justices and faith of the peace
loving peoples of the world."
The "Disarmed Neutral Poli
cy" tormulated and still main
tained by the Japan Socialist
Party, and the "UN centered
policy" or "AH Direction
Diplomacy" formally pro
claimed by the Liberal Demo
cratic Party are seen as very
unrealistic idealism in the eyes
of foreign people. But the gener
al feeling of the Japanese people
is that a military buildup to cope

with international problems in
unrealistic, since the next world
war will be a nuclear war, de
stroying everything on earth
The common Japanese response
to the "Soviet threat" is quite
simple. They do not share the
geopolitical image of the con
temporary world with the Pen
tagon strategy analysts. The
Japanese people simply think
that it they do not harm the Rus
sians the Soviet army would
never invade Hokkaido.
Today, the Japanese people,
though in a quite relative way,
are enjoying a stable and pros
perous economic success (when
asked, almost 90 percent of the
Japanese people answer that
they are belonging to the
"middle-class"). This attitude
toward the status quo is very
conservative. Even 1970s oil
shocks have passed away
without leaving any serious
after effects in the Japanese
economy. At present there is no
forseeable social "crisis"
which would drive Japan into a
drastically new military policy.
Recent opinion polls show
that only 20 to 30 percent of the
population favor the strong
buildup of the Self Defense
Forces. There are only a few
who think seriously that we
should have an army properly
corresponding to our economic
power. Such action would re
quire amending the Constitu
tion. This would mean a
Japanese military second only
to that of the United States in
the Free World. Such a massive
buildup of Japanese military
force would always induce a
negative and pervasive re
sponse from the neighboring
countries, including China, the
Soviet Union, and Southeast
Asian nations, who still regard
Japan warily as a result ot
memories left from World War
11. A full scale conventional and
nuclear buildup of Japanese
forces might cause even the
United States to consider re
targeting its ICBMs to include
Japanese bases.
In my point of view, it is a de
sirable and realistic Japanese
option in the longer perspective
to deal with the problem of mili
tary buildup in the light ot the
spirit of the "Peace Constitu
tion," even though such an op
tion draws criticism from the
U.S. as a little bit 'idiotic' or un
realistic.
Generally speaking, except
for some well-informed in
tellectuals, the image ot Japan
in this country is terribly poor
and distorted. In addition the re
ports on Japan in the media are
usually fragmented, lacking the
complete context or background
to judge the reported story. It is
my sincere hope that the two
countries as important partners
in this Free World should try to
understand each other better
than this.
