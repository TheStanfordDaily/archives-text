## Florida sinkhole expansion slows 
### 
Winter Park, Fla. (API — A
sinkhole devoured part of a city
street Monday and toppled a tew
trees, but an engineer said the
crater was beginning to stabi
lize. A city official estimated
property damage at more than
$2 million.
Already in the pit were a
house, tive expensive foreign
cars and a camper, which fell in
when the earth opened up in this
central Florida city.

"All we can do is stand here
and gape at it — let nature take
its course,'' said Orange County
Administrator Jim Harris, join
ing other officials, workers and
the curious peering into the 100-
foot-deep hole. During the week
end, officials estimated the
diameter of the sinkhole at up to
1.000 feet, but consulting engi
neer Dan said Monday it
was closer to 4<X> feet wide.
Parts of the tile roof of a

three-bedroom house could be
seen Monday in the approx
imately 00-foot-wide bottom of
the sinkhole, now filled with
mud and water.
Blamed on drought
The crater, which officials
have blamed on the drought,
also has wrecked a $150,W0
swimming pool and demolished
the backs of businesses.
"It expanded 10 or 20 teet,"
said Police Chief Raymond
Beary Monday. "Another cou
ple of trees and some more of
Denning Avenue fell in."
The avenue is the north-south
street bordering one side of the
sinkhole, which is in an area
that is part residential, part
business and part recreational.
$2 million in damage
City Commissioner Dave
Johnston estimated property
losses would top $2 million, and
said the governor's office was
sending a representative to

check out the sinkhole. The city
will try to get state and federal
aid, he said.
The owner of a car dealership
on Fairbanks Avenue, an east
west artery which the en
dangered businesses face, had
employees move cars from a lot
about 30) feet away from the
south edge ot the hole.
The back ends ot two of the
four businesses next to the sink
hole — an auto repair service
and a printing shop — were
slowly eroding A record shop
and laundry were not as serious
ly threatened.
Businesses to be condemned
"Those businesses will proba
bly have to be condemned by the
city," said Fulford, a technical
engineer whose firm is a consul
tant for Winter Park. "The hole
is starting to stabilize. There is
still some movement, some
sloughing going on. But there
has been no appreciable move
ment since Saturday."
