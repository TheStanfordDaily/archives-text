# Delahanty shooting strange coincidence
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Had it not
been for a sick dog and an
outdated photograph, Dis
trict ot Columbia police
canine officer Thomas De
lahanty would now be spend
ing his days patroling the
side streets and back alleys
ot Washington's 3rd District.
As it is, he is taking therapy
three times a week and being
treated like a hero Miile re
covering from a wound left
by a bullet meant for Presi
dent Ronald Reagan.
The day before John
Hinckley stepped out from a
press gallery outside the
Washington Hilton and al
legedly fired a volley of shots
that seriously wounded Rea
gan, press secretary James
Brady, Delahanty and Secret
Service agent Timothy Mc-
Carthy, Delahanty was at
home in suburban Maryland,
sharing the Sunday news
paper with his wife.
Paging through the paper,
the 18-year veteran of the
force noticed a story about a
suburban police officer who
had been shot when he and
another man surprised early
morning burglars in a New
Hampshire Avenue store.
The police officer's picture
looked outdated to Delahan
ty.
"You know," Delahanty
recalled mentioning casually
to his wife, Jean, "I'm going
down to headquarters tomor
row and get a new picture (ot

me) tor the police file. The
one I have now is (as) out
dated as this one here."
The next day, the day of
the shooting, Delahanty, 45,
went to work at the 3rd Dis
trict station. But because his
dog, Kirk, was sick and at the
veterinarian's for treat
ment, Delahanty went to
headquarters to have his pic
ture taken. He returned to
the station and was assigned
to the presidential security
detail.
Several hours later, he
was shot in the back. But the
new picture hadn't been de
veloped. and his old one was
released to the press by au
thorities.
Six weeks have now
passed, and Delahanty is at
home, recovering from the
delicate operation in which
doctors at the Washington
Hospital Center removed the
bullet that had lodged an
eighth of an inch from his
spine. He is in constant pain,
he says, but grateful to be
alive.
But with pain has come re
wards, recognition of a job
well done. Monday Delahan
ty received an award for val
or from the New York City
police department, the first
non-New York police officer
to receive it. He has received
other such awards and has
gotten thousands of letters
from well-wishers across the
country.
