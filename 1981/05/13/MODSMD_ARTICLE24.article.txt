## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Pentagon has compiled and
sent to the White House a "hit list" of military
bases that could be closed to save money, govern
ment officials said Monday.
Although the bases listed are being kept secret
in hopes of forestalling the political storm that af
fected members of Congress would kick up. one
official said 50 was a good estimate of the number
of facilities being reviewed by the Defense Dept
and the Office of Management and Budget.
As important as saving money by shutting down
or shrinking some military bases, detense of
ficials said, would be the symbolic demonstration
to Congress and the public that President Ronald
Reagan is demanding economies in military as
well as civilian programs
Symbolism vital
Budget chief David Stockman is said by admin
istration officials to consider such symbolism vi
tal to Reagan's effort to convince Congress to ac
cept proposed cuts in federal income taxes.
Former Defense Secretary Harold Brown said
shortly before leaving office that millions ot
dollars could be saved if politicians to
closing bases that the military no longer needs
Detense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has been
studying what he calls "realignments" in the base
structure but is not expected to tackle the issue
publicly until this summer, when the Pentagon's
record peacetime budget is expected to have
passed most major congressional obstacles.

Several of the Pentagon s friends in Congress
are warning the administration that the con
sensus favoring defense will break up if rising
costs ot weaponry are not brought under control
and budget estimates are not hardened
Such congressional veterans as chairmen John
Tower (R-Texasi of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and Mark 0. Hatfield (R-Ore. > of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sens
.John C. Stennis < D-Miss.) Sam Nunn (D-Ga I and
Barry Goldwater i R-Ariz.) of the Armed Services
Committee have been sounding such warnings re
cently.
'More bang for the buck'
Two comparatively junior members. Sen Carl
Levin (D-Mich.l and Rep Dave McCurdy <D-
Okla i of the Senate and House armed services
committees respectively, have pledged toconcen--
trate on retorming Pentagon procurement to get
more bang for the buck
Levin succeeded in adding language to the Pen
tagon's fiscal 1982 authorization bill requiring
more extensive advertising of weapons projects
before contracts can be negotiated on a sole
source basis. The Pentagon, under the Levin
amendment, also would have to inform Congress
on a regular basis about how many sole-source
contracts it was awarding
McCurdy said Monday that Reagan told him
last week that his tax cut proposal would go before
Congress for a vote this year even if inflation and
mortgage rates failed to drop below present
levels.
