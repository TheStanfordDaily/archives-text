# Atlanta apprehensive about 'Safe Summer'
## 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — A vague restlessness,
a sense ot unease, hangs in the balmy
spring air over this Southern city, which
has buried 26 young black murder vic
tims in the past 22 months.
Fear and suspicion — products of
months of frustration over the killings —
overshadow the normal languid expecta
tion of carefree summer days.
This summer will not be carefree.
With 70,000 children, mostly black,
ready to dash trom public school build
ings in Atlanta on June 5, city officials
are deep in plans for a "Safe Summer"
campaign to keep children off tjve streets
— and, they hope, out of danger.
City-run day camps
City-run day camps will spring up in 47
recreation centers around Atlanta the
Monday after school closes, operating
from morning to night on weekdays until
school starts again in September.
Each will be closely supervised with
low ratios of counselors to campers, col
or-coded T-shirts for the children and
roll-call three times a day.
"It won't be a prison," said Roma
Harper, the city's depuy commissioner
pt parks and recreation, "but we are
to insulate the children so they can
play-without fear of strangers."
City officials estimate the day camps
can accomodate 33,0*30 of the 56,000 chil

dren aged 6 to ' 5 in the city school sys
tem. They expect another 14,000 to at
tend supervised activities of nonprofit
agencies. The remaining 9000 will be in
summer school or on vacation, they be
lieve.
Other sources of worry
Fears for the children, believed to be
especially vulnerable while schopl is out,
are not the only source of apprehension
as summer nears.
City leaders also say the potential ex
ists that lingering frustration over the
killings, high unemployment among
working-age blacks and the continued
pinch of inflation could form an ex
plosive mixture during hot summer days
and nights.
"When you talk about a half million
people and the temperature rising and
the cost ot living going up, and you talk
about the great sense of assault many ot
our citizens feel by these killings, who
can predict what response will come?,"
asked Leon Hall, director of the mayor's
office ot community and consumer af
fairs.
"There are people who tell me they
feel they are being raped and can't do
anything about it because of these kill
ings," he said.
Federal budget cuts have cost the city
hundreds ot government-funded posi

tions which typically went to young, poor
blacks. Some 40) new slots will be made
available as the city hires staff for the
day camps.
The National Association of Business,
headed by Wade Mitchell, a banker and
former Atlanta City Council member,
hopes to provide at least 1000 summer
jobs exclusively for low-income black
youths.^
Businessmen concerned
"A lot of questions have been asked,
does the business community really give
a damn?* This is just one effort to say,
'Yes, we're concerned, " said Mitchell.
Another group planning summer
strategy is the United Youth Adult Con
ference, led by Councilman Arthur
Langford, which spearheads weekend
searches tor clues by volunteers and as
sists in a police-sanctioned neighborhood
watch program.
"We plan to cover all areas where chil
dren are going to be assembling,"
Langford said. "We're going to work our
best to make sure we're going to have all
our children supervised."
Suspicion is symptomatic of Atlanta's
problem.
Eyes, ears open
"This community's eyes and ears are
open and close to the ground," said Hall.
"Everybody is literally a possible sus

pect. As you go into various communities
where you are not known, you can feel
them wondering if you may be the one."
A prominent minister, seeing a black
teen-ager on the street late at night, con
sidered offering him a ride home and
then thought better of it. Hall reported.
"He told me that in the middle of think
ing about it, it suddenly hit him: 'My
God, suppose the child panics. Then I
have to live under the cloud of somebody
suspecting I was after that child. "
Children warned often
Atlanta's children have been warned
repeatedly for many months to stay
away from strangers, play in groups and
report suspicious contacts to police.
Health officials have encouraged pa
rents to spend more time in family ac
tivities to help relieve the tension and
stress.
Mass anticipation
"There is a mass anticipation of good
news in this community," Braddock
said. "The whole community is looking
tor the psychological closure to occur, tp
be able to say that the process of injury is
now over so the process of healing can
begin.
"But the healing process has never
begun."

jobs exclusively for low-income black
youths.^
Businessmen concerned
"A lot of questions have been asked,
does the business community really give
a damn?* This is just one effort to say,
'Yes, we're concerned, " said Mitchell.
Another group planning summer
strategy is the United Youth Adult Con
ference, led by Councilman Arthur
Langford, which spearheads weekend
searches tor clues by volunteers and as
sists in a police-sanctioned neighborhood
watch program.
"We plan to cover all areas where chil
dren are going to be assembling,"
Langford said. "We're going to work our
best to make sure we're going to have all
our children supervised."
Suspicion is symptomatic of Atlanta's
problem.
Eyes, ears open
"This community's eyes and ears are
open and close to the ground," said Hall.
"Everybody is literally a possible sus

pect. As you go into various communities
where you are not known, you can feel
them wondering if you may be the one."
A prominent minister, seeing a black
teen-ager on the street late at night, con
sidered offering him a ride home and
then thought better of it. Hall reported.
"He told me that in the middle of think
ing about it, it suddenly hit him: 'My
God, suppose the child panics. Then I
have to live under the cloud of somebody
suspecting I was after that child. "
Children warned often
Atlanta's children have been warned
repeatedly for many months to stay
away from strangers, play in groups and
report suspicious contacts to police.
Health officials have encouraged pa
rents to spend more time in family ac
tivities to help relieve the tension and
stress.
Mass anticipation
"There is a mass anticipation of good
news in this community," Braddock
said. "The whole community is looking
tor the psychological closure to occur, tp
be able to say that the process of injury is
now over so the process of healing can
begin.
"But the healing process has never
begun."
Atlanta (AP) — A vague restlessness,
a sense ot unease, hangs in the balmy
spring air over this Southern city, which
has buried 26 young black murder vic
tims in the past 22 months.
Fear and suspicion — products of
months of frustration over the killings —
overshadow the normal languid expecta
tion of carefree summer days.
This summer will not be carefree.
With 70,000 children, mostly black,
ready to dash trom public school build
ings in Atlanta on June 5, city officials
are deep in plans for a "Safe Summer"
campaign to keep children off tjve streets
— and, they hope, out of danger.
City-run day camps
City-run day camps will spring up in 47
recreation centers around Atlanta the
Monday after school closes, operating
from morning to night on weekdays until
school starts again in September.
Each will be closely supervised with
low ratios of counselors to campers, col
or-coded T-shirts for the children and
roll-call three times a day.
"It won't be a prison," said Roma
Harper, the city's depuy commissioner
pt parks and recreation, "but we are
to insulate the children so they can
play-without fear of strangers."
City officials estimate the day camps
can accomodate 33,0*30 of the 56,000 chil

dren aged 6 to ' 5 in the city school sys
tem. They expect another 14,000 to at
tend supervised activities of nonprofit
agencies. The remaining 9000 will be in
summer school or on vacation, they be
lieve.
Other sources of worry
Fears for the children, believed to be
especially vulnerable while schopl is out,
are not the only source of apprehension
as summer nears.
City leaders also say the potential ex
ists that lingering frustration over the
killings, high unemployment among
working-age blacks and the continued
pinch of inflation could form an ex
plosive mixture during hot summer days
and nights.
"When you talk about a half million
people and the temperature rising and
the cost ot living going up, and you talk
about the great sense of assault many ot
our citizens feel by these killings, who
can predict what response will come?,"
asked Leon Hall, director of the mayor's
office ot community and consumer af
fairs.
"There are people who tell me they
feel they are being raped and can't do
anything about it because of these kill
ings," he said.
Federal budget cuts have cost the city
hundreds ot government-funded posi

tions which typically went to young, poor
blacks. Some 40) new slots will be made
available as the city hires staff for the
day camps.
