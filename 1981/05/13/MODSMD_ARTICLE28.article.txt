# Women netters break Bruins

### Steve Odell 
After the Stanford women's tennis team's
match with No. 3 ranked UCLA yesterday at-
Stanford Tennis Stadium, Cardinal coach
Frank Brennan had the look of a genius. The
reason was that his newly aligned doubles
teams all had the look of winners, allowing
the Cards to finish their 198' home season
with a convincing 6-3 win over the Bruins al
ter being behind 3-1 after tour singles
matches.
"I was really happy with how we played
today," said Brennan after the match. "I
was happy because we were able to win. and
also because we came back from being be
hind 3-1 to do it. It was really a good effort on
everyone's part."
Brennan, in a bit of a surprise move,
changed his pairs around last Friday when
the Cards hosted USC because of the
absence of two of his top six players, Susy
Jaeger and Michelle Weiss. He switched
Elise Burgin and Caryn Copeland around,
inserting Burgin into number one doubles
with Alycia Moulton. and moving Copeland
down to number two, reuniting her with her
partner from last year, Donna Rubin. And
at number three, he used a team that had
never played a match together before, put
ting Sue Rasmussen with Chan instead ot
her usual partner, Alison Hardey.
Burgin and Moulton, who were partners
in lime for the first time last weekend with
varying results, put it together against
UCLA, playing aggressive and overpower
ing tennis to more than make up for what

they lacked in experience as a team. The
Cardinal duo exhibited vicious volleying
throughout their match, as they tore
through the Bruins' number one team of
Kathrin Keil and Ann Hennrickson, 6-2, 6-4.
The deciding match was at number two
doubles where Coueland and Rubin started
off slow, dropping the first set 6-4. The next
brought back memories ot last
year, 'however, when they took the tilth
match in a 5-4 thriller in Los Angeles.
Steamrolling over their Bruin opponents,
Copeland and Rubin dropped only two
games the rest of the match to clinch the
team victory. It was Rubin's last match at
home as a Cardinal, and she went out a win
ner, as the two played inspired tennis in tak
ing the three-setter, 4-6 6-2, 6-0.
Chan and Rasmussen wielded brooms for
rackets in completing the sweep in doubles
at number three, winning their debut, 6-4,
2-6, 6-3, over Karin Huebner and LizStalder.
In singles, freshman Elise Burgin started
the comeback for the Cards after they had
dropped three out ot their first four de
cisions. The lefthander from Baltimore won
the first set 6-4 over UCLA's tfathy O'Brien,
buttell behind 5-2, 30-love on O'Brien's serve
in the eighth game of the second set. Burgin
battled back and broke O'Brien's serve,
then won four more games in a row to notch
the Cards' second victory of the day.
Attention then turned to court No. 6,
where Gayle Chan was playing Helena
Manset in a match which took over
hours. Chan showed her resiliency also in

the battle of the baseliners when, after drop
ping the first set, she bounced back and took
the next two to knot the team match at 3-3
heading into the doubles.
The win was most satisfying tor the
Cardinals (now 3-4), as it was the rubber
match between the two teams so tar this
year — Stanford having won the first bout
5-4, at the NIKE Tournament in San Fran
cisco, and the Bruins (now 23-4) taking a
victory in Los Angeles a month ago, 6-2.
Furthermore, when UCLA won last time,
the Cards were playing with both Jaeger
and Weiss; and UCLA was without Hen
ricksson, their number tour singles and'No.
1 doubles player. The triumph gives
Stanford legitimate grounds to the claim on
the No. 2 spot in the nation behind the un
defeated and two-time AIAW defending
champion USC Trojans.
Stanford now has a day to prepare for the
AIAW Regionals, scheduled for May 14- 7 in
San Jose, featuring players on teams from
California and Arizona (among them USC
and UCLA.) The tournament is set up on an
individual basis only, and it will determine
who qualifites for the AIAW Nationals, to be
held June 3-10 in Tempe, Arizona.
