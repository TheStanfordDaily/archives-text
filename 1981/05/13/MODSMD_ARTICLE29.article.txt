## Laxmen triumph 
### Gray Maxwell 
The men's lacrosse team methodically destroyed a physical UC-
Davis squad 16-5 this past Saturday in a game played at deGuerre
P'ield. Stanford middle Chris Romer won the opening face- oft, and
Stanford controlled the game from that point onward.
The news wasn't all good however, for leading scorer Kirk Phelps
suffered ligament and possible cartilage damage to his right knee in
the third period. The injury occurred shortly after Phelps scored his
fifth goal of the day, setting a Stanford season record with 65 goals.
The senior attack is set for surgery later this week, and is out for
the season.
Phelps was the first Card to score, firing a shot past the Davis
goalie three minutes into the first quarter. Fellow attack Dickie
Taylor scored thirty seconds later, assisted by Peter Hoberg, the
first of his six tor the day. Romer scored the first goal of his hat
trick, and Phelps scored again moments later.
At the other end of the field, tough Cardinal defense prevented
Davis from taking any high-percentage shots. A pattern was estab
lished early and continued throughout the game: Davis actually out

shot Stanford 26-23 through two quarters, and managed to get off a
total of 40. The shots were hurried though, and goalie Dennis Childs
had no difficulty stopping most of them < 18 safes for the afternoon >
Phelps, Romer, Hoberg, and middie Mason Day scored in the sec
ond period, and the Cards led 8- at half time.
Day scored his second and third goals of the day early in the
fourth quarter, and Williams and Romer scored again as the Cards
coasted to a 16- lead. Four Davis goals later in the period dismayed
Stanford coach Sam Sadtler, but did nothing to affect the outcome of
the contest.
The game was a tune-up of sorts, for this Saturday the Cardinals
will face UC-Berkeley for the NorCal Collegiate Championship and
the Webb-Sadtler trophy, which has never left Stanford. The match
will begin at 3:00 p.m. at deGuerre Field.
