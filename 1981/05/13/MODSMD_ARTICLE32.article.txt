Polish union scores victory
Warsaw, Poland — A Polish court legally registered an
independent trade union for private farmers yesterday,
making it the first organization ot its kind in the com
munist world.
The decision was greeted with loud cheers by several
thousand farmers who had gathered outside
courtroom. The farmers' leader, 23-vear-old Jan Kulaj.
said that torming the rural branch ot the independent Soli
darity trade union marked a victory after a bitter seven
month struggle with Poland's Communist authorities
The formal legalization ot Rural Solidarity, as the union
is popularly called, had been expected following an agree
ment last month between the government and striking
farmers in the northern town ot Bydgoszcz.
It also sets the seal on Kulaj's own emergence as a popu
lar leader second only to Solidarity's president. Lech
Walesa.
"We peasants do not want political power, but we do
want to be able to control the authorities. The government
must play the role ot the servant of the nation.'' Kulaj said
Union officials estimated that between two-thirds and
three-quarters of Poland's 3.5 million private farmers al
ready belong to Rural Solidarity. They predicted the per
centage will rise now that the union has been formally le
galized.
Irish hunger striker dies
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Francis Hughes, once
Northern Ireland's most-wanted IRA gunman, died in
Maze prison yesterday after 59 days without food, the sec
ond hunger striker to starve to death in a bid to win politi
cal status for Irish nationalist prisoners.
Hughes, 25, died at the Maze in the late afternoon with
his family at his bedside.
Hughes, a legendary figure in the IRA. had been serving
a life sentence for killing a British soldier. Security
sources believe he could have been responsible for the
deaths of at least 26 soldiers and policemen.
Oliver Hughes, 31, emerged from the Maze prison 90
minutes after witnessing his brother's death, and was met
with an emotional greeting from supporters of the hunger
strikers.
Senate approves budget limit
Washington — The Senate overwhelmingly approved a
1982 budget limit of $700.8-billion last night, handing Presi
dent Ronald Reagan a second major victory within days
tor his proposed tax and spending cuts.
The vote was 78 to 20 in favor of the non-binding plan,
which is similar on virtually all major points to the $689-
billion measure passed last week by the Democratic-con

trolled House.
Aides said House and Senate negotiators would begin
work today on ironing out the differences — mostly techni
cal — and expressed hope a compromise could be ap
proved in both houses by the end of the week.
For the present, the plan calls for $36.9 billion in spend
ing cuts from social programs for 982, and provides for
the accelerated defense spending Reagan wants. And it
leaves room for the three-year, across-the-board tax cut ot
30 percent favored by the president.
Despite several last-minute attempts to change the
plan, most Democrats supported the blueprint, with the
loudest complaints coming from badly outnumbered liber
als.
