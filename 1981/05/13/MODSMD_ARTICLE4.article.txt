# Housing draw results released
## 
### Dinah Lahnala 
Residential Education has sim
plified the draw system and given
housing to more people this year
Students no longer have to fill out a
new draw card it they want to enter
Round Two.
And in an improvement over last
year, the Housing Center was able to
assign all guaranteed women, a
greater number of unguaranteed
women, and most ot the guaranteed
men in Round One.
The results of Round One of the
Draw are posted as of this morning in

the local residence housing offices,
and as in the past there is bound to be
some misunderstanding on what the
student must do to secure his housing
Last year, the cut-off numbers in
Round One were 0)64 for women and
4542 for The Housing Office as
signed all guaranteed women and un
guaranteed women up to 0064, while
the cut-off for males included only
guaranteed men
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean ot
student affairs and director of the
Housing Center, said. "We've
changed the system this year because

we want to simplify the Draw as much
as possible In previous years, stu
dents entering the Second Round had
to fill out a second draw card after
Round One, This meant they basically
had to start all over, indicating new
choices which may have differed from
their original designations "
This year the cut-off numbers are
0745 for women and 4540 for men in
Round One These numbers mean all
guaranteed women and those un
guaranteed females holding a number
