# Housing draw results released
## 
### Dinah Lahnala 
Residential Education has sim
plified the draw system and given
housing to more people this year
Students no longer have to fill out a
new draw card it they want to enter
Round Two.
And in an improvement over last
year, the Housing Center was able to
assign all guaranteed women, a
greater number of unguaranteed
women, and most ot the guaranteed
men in Round One.
The results of Round One of the
Draw are posted as of this morning in

the local residence housing offices,
and as in the past there is bound to be
some misunderstanding on what the
student must do to secure his housing
Last year, the cut-off numbers in
Round One were 0)64 for women and
4542 for The Housing Office as
signed all guaranteed women and un
guaranteed women up to 0064, while
the cut-off for males included only
guaranteed men
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean ot
student affairs and director of the
Housing Center, said. "We've
changed the system this year because

we want to simplify the Draw as much
as possible In previous years, stu
dents entering the Second Round had
to fill out a second draw card after
Round One, This meant they basically
had to start all over, indicating new
choices which may have differed from
their original designations "
This year the cut-off numbers are
0745 for women and 4540 for men in
Round One These numbers mean all
guaranteed women and those un
guaranteed females holding a number
between <)001 and 0745 will be assigned.
The figure for males, again, includes
only guaranteed men.
Whitney said, "This year if a stu
dent wants to keep moving up he
should go right into the Second Draw.
If he is happy with his Round One as
signment then he should pick up a
Round Two card and accept it."
According to Whitney, about 200
men normally drop out of the Draw be
cause they have pledged a fraternity.
He said that in the past, Res Ed has
always been able to assign all guaran
teed men. and that they expect to do
the same again this Spring.
Unlike last year, students cannot
change their original choices. All stu
dents who want to try for a higher
choice must go through Round Two.
They will be automatically entered in
Second Round with the same order of
choices as they indicated originally.
Students who are either satisfied
with their Round One assignment or
who want to drop out of the Draw en
tirely must fill out a Round Two card.
The cards are available in lpcal resi
dence housing offices and the Housing
Center. The deadline to turn the cards
in is this Friday at 5 p.m. If the student
fails to fill out a card he will auto
matically be entered in the Second
Round.
The final step for all students is fill

ing out Card Three which is a binding
agreement that the student accepts
his assigned housing. If after signing
the student refuses his housing, he or
she will be charged a $10 penalty up
until the first of August. After this
date, cancellation will result in the
student's losing the mandatory $50
housing deposit.
Alternatives to the present draw
system have been looked at by Resi
dential Education. Some schools use a
simple lottery system. However,
Whitney said, "Stanford has special
programs like the theme houses which
involve returning residence priority to
maintain cohesiveness and continuity

in the houses. A simple lottery just
won't work." Other schools use a class
preference system where seniors have
priority over juniors, and so on down
the line.
Splitting the numbers into two
divisions, with students picking from
a special box with "good numbers"
one of the years, has also been con
sidered. This system would help solve
the returning residence priority prob
lem which allows people with such sta
tus to live in a high-priority house even
if they have a bad number.
But Whitney said, "The plan is more
complicated than our present one. Our
whole objective is to simplify the
Draw."

Splitting the numbers into two
divisions, with students picking from
a special box with "good numbers"
one of the years, has also been con
sidered. This system would help solve
the returning residence priority prob
lem which allows people with such sta
tus to live in a high-priority house even
if they have a bad number.
But Whitney said, "The plan is more
complicated than our present one. Our
whole objective is to simplify the
Draw."
Residential Education has sim
plified the draw system and given
housing to more people this year
Students no longer have to fill out a
new draw card it they want to enter
Round Two.
And in an improvement over last
year, the Housing Center was able to
assign all guaranteed women, a
greater number of unguaranteed
women, and most ot the guaranteed
men in Round One.
The results of Round One of the
Draw are posted as of this morning in

the local residence housing offices,
and as in the past there is bound to be
some misunderstanding on what the
student must do to secure his housing
Last year, the cut-off numbers in
Round One were 0)64 for women and
4542 for The Housing Office as
signed all guaranteed women and un
guaranteed women up to 0064, while
the cut-off for males included only
guaranteed men
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean ot
student affairs and director of the
Housing Center, said. "We've
changed the system this year because

we want to simplify the Draw as much
as possible In previous years, stu
dents entering the Second Round had
to fill out a second draw card after
Round One, This meant they basically
had to start all over, indicating new
choices which may have differed from
their original designations "
This year the cut-off numbers are
0745 for women and 4540 for men in
Round One These numbers mean all
guaranteed women and those un
guaranteed females holding a number
between <)001 and 0745 will be assigned.
The figure for males, again, includes
only guaranteed men.
Whitney said, "This year if a stu
dent wants to keep moving up he
should go right into the Second Draw.
If he is happy with his Round One as
signment then he should pick up a
Round Two card and accept it."
According to Whitney, about 200
men normally drop out of the Draw be
cause they have pledged a fraternity.
He said that in the past, Res Ed has
always been able to assign all guaran
teed men. and that they expect to do
the same again this Spring.
Unlike last year, students cannot
change their original choices. All stu
dents who want to try for a higher
choice must go through Round Two.
They will be automatically entered in
Second Round with the same order of
choices as they indicated originally.
Students who are either satisfied
with their Round One assignment or
who want to drop out of the Draw en
tirely must fill out a Round Two card.
The cards are available in lpcal resi
dence housing offices and the Housing
Center. The deadline to turn the cards
in is this Friday at 5 p.m. If the student
fails to fill out a card he will auto
matically be entered in the Second
Round.
The final step for all students is fill

ing out Card Three which is a binding
agreement that the student accepts
his assigned housing. If after signing
the student refuses his housing, he or
she will be charged a $10 penalty up
until the first of August. After this
date, cancellation will result in the
student's losing the mandatory $50
housing deposit.
Alternatives to the present draw
system have been looked at by Resi
dential Education. Some schools use a
simple lottery system. However,
Whitney said, "Stanford has special
programs like the theme houses which
involve returning residence priority to
maintain cohesiveness and continuity

in the houses. A simple lottery just
won't work." Other schools use a class
preference system where seniors have
priority over juniors, and so on down
the line.
Splitting the numbers into two
divisions, with students picking from
a special box with "good numbers"
one of the years, has also been con
sidered. This system would help solve
the returning residence priority prob
lem which allows people with such sta
tus to live in a high-priority house even
if they have a bad number.
But Whitney said, "The plan is more
complicated than our present one. Our
whole objective is to simplify the
Draw."
