# Trustees review 'Facilities Plan and Forecast '81-'84'
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
A streamlined and more conservative document pres
enting Stanford's plans, possibilities and the forces driv
ing ty)th has been presented to the Board of Trustees this
week at. their May meeting.
The thick Facilities Plan and Funding Forecast I9HI-84,
prepared by the University s Capital Budget Staff, was re
viewed by a joint commitee of the board on Monday. It
presents the "priorities established by University officers
tor the physical development of the campus during the
next three years," according to Albert Hastort, vice presi
dent and provost.
These include, according to the report, such projects as
— a Center tor Integrated Systems to begin construction in
summer 1982;
— renovations of the Medical Center's Boswell clinics
over the next three years;
— additions to the Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in
the next two years;
— a storage facility for dangerous chemicals to begin con
struction in January,l9B3;
— an $R 7 million project to centralize research animal fa
cilities beginning in spring 1983.
— an annex to the Graduate School of Business possibly be
ginning construction in spring 1984.
-- a humanities center to begin construction in summer
1985;
— a Radiobiology Research Building to begin construction
in spring 984; and
— combination of the Research Animals Facilities
the Radiobiology Research Building to form a Science
Complex, possibly to begin construction in spring 1984
This plan was not an action plan but rather a report to
the Board.
However, in a major action yesterday, the trustees
voted to approve the design and a $14 million budget for the
Cardiovascular Research Building (CVRB). Vice Presi
dent tor Building and Finance William Massy has been au
thorized to put the project to bid and occupancy is ten
tatively scheduled for August 983
Already in hand are two major gilts — $4 5 million from
an <nonymous donor, the other a $4 million grant from the

Max C. Fleischman Foundation — as well as several ot her
gifts to bring the total to $10,654,000. The remainder ot thp
project budget is anticipated to come from interest earned
on in-hand monies and $2.6 million worth of anticipated
new gifts.
The proposed building is a two-story structure over a
lull laboratory basement and is designed to eventually ac
comodate future connections to the hospital mod
ernization project.
The structure will include research laboratories, oper
ating and monitoring rooms and physiology laboratories.
Also included will be wet and dry laboratories for drug as
say. biochemistry, immunology, neuroelectrophysiology
and magnetometrv among other areas of research
According to junior Chris Bonbright. a student member
of the Board's committee on finance and administration,
one ot the most interesting presentations made to the com
mittees was by Lynda Weisberg, who presented an em rgy
action plan to the trustees which hf* said was "well-re
ceived."
The plan was submitted to the Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massy tor study'
There will be various actions deriving from that plan
as time goes on," said Vice President for Public Aft.iirs
Robert Rosenzweig last night However, no immediate ac
tions are planned.
Bonbright also mentioned that he was making a recom
mendation to the Board in light ot recent discussion .(bout
establishing the COP as ex officio members of the trustee
committees.
"1 am recommending that it the Board decides to put
COP members on trustee committees, they should also
nominate alternate student committee members who
would, if the board granted the COP members ex officio
rights, move into the full member position, while tht COP
would move off into ex officio positions," Bonbright ex
plained He said his recommendation came out ot concern
that the change would rob students of an important. active
voice on the board.
Currently the board's committees have as members
several students, who possess voting rights

A streamlined and more conservative document pres
enting Stanford's plans, possibilities and the forces driv
ing ty)th has been presented to the Board of Trustees this
week at. their May meeting.
The thick Facilities Plan and Funding Forecast I9HI-84,
prepared by the University s Capital Budget Staff, was re
viewed by a joint commitee of the board on Monday. It
presents the "priorities established by University officers
tor the physical development of the campus during the
next three years," according to Albert Hastort, vice presi
dent and provost.
These include, according to the report, such projects as
— a Center tor Integrated Systems to begin construction in
summer 1982;
— renovations of the Medical Center's Boswell clinics
over the next three years;
— additions to the Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in
the next two years;
— a storage facility for dangerous chemicals to begin con
struction in January,l9B3;
— an $R 7 million project to centralize research animal fa
cilities beginning in spring 1983.
— an annex to the Graduate School of Business possibly be
ginning construction in spring 1984.
-- a humanities center to begin construction in summer
1985;
— a Radiobiology Research Building to begin construction
in spring 984; and
— combination of the Research Animals Facilities
the Radiobiology Research Building to form a Science
Complex, possibly to begin construction in spring 1984
This plan was not an action plan but rather a report to
the Board.
However, in a major action yesterday, the trustees
voted to approve the design and a $14 million budget for the
Cardiovascular Research Building (CVRB). Vice Presi
dent tor Building and Finance William Massy has been au
thorized to put the project to bid and occupancy is ten
tatively scheduled for August 983
Already in hand are two major gilts — $4 5 million from
an <nonymous donor, the other a $4 million grant from the

Max C. Fleischman Foundation — as well as several ot her
gifts to bring the total to $10,654,000. The remainder ot thp
project budget is anticipated to come from interest earned
on in-hand monies and $2.6 million worth of anticipated
new gifts.
The proposed building is a two-story structure over a
lull laboratory basement and is designed to eventually ac
comodate future connections to the hospital mod
ernization project.
The structure will include research laboratories, oper
ating and monitoring rooms and physiology laboratories.
Also included will be wet and dry laboratories for drug as
say. biochemistry, immunology, neuroelectrophysiology
and magnetometrv among other areas of research
According to junior Chris Bonbright. a student member
of the Board's committee on finance and administration,
one ot the most interesting presentations made to the com
mittees was by Lynda Weisberg, who presented an em rgy
action plan to the trustees which hf* said was "well-re
ceived."
The plan was submitted to the Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massy tor study'
There will be various actions deriving from that plan
as time goes on," said Vice President for Public Aft.iirs
Robert Rosenzweig last night However, no immediate ac
tions are planned.
Bonbright also mentioned that he was making a recom
mendation to the Board in light ot recent discussion .(bout
establishing the COP as ex officio members of the trustee
committees.
"1 am recommending that it the Board decides to put
COP members on trustee committees, they should also
nominate alternate student committee members who
would, if the board granted the COP members ex officio
rights, move into the full member position, while tht COP
would move off into ex officio positions," Bonbright ex
plained He said his recommendation came out ot concern
that the change would rob students of an important. active
voice on the board.
Currently the board's committees have as members
several students, who possess voting rights
