## Doctors advance microsurgery techniques 
### Michell Sklar 
Doctors have made dra
matic advances in
plastic and reconstruc
tive surgery that may open the
door to significant improve
ments in restoring and re
generating damaged body tis
sue. The advances have come
both in microsurgery tech
niques and in the use of col
lagen, the body's basic struc
tural protein that provides
structure for new tissue to
grow.
Though microsurgery is a rel
atively recent innovation, de
veloped over the past few dec
ades. it is already producing
spectacular results such as the
attachment of limbs or fingers
that were severed in accidents.
Microsurgery is also impor
tant when one piece of the body
must be moved somewhere else,
as when skin is transferred to
cover an area damaged bv in
jury or a burn.
Microsurgery is performed
under an operating microscope
The delicate work on the small
blood vessels, nerves and ten
dons must be done with special
ly designed surgical instru
ments.
"Comparing traditional
surgery with microsurgery is
like comparing plumbing with
watchmaking." explained Dr.
Ernest Kaplan, associate pro
fessor ot surgery here. "Wrist
motions are too gross on the tiny
scale of microsurgery , even the
ordinary tremors that occur if
the hand is unsupported look
like an earthquake under the mi
croscope."
Operating on the small scale,
doctors have been able to sew up
tiny arteries thinner than a hu
man hair. This technique
enables surgeons working with
tissue grafts to transfer an en
tire patch of tissue along with
its blood vessels.
While microsurgery is prima
rily concerned with repairing
and transferring tissues, col
lagen is used as a replacement
for missing structural tissue,
forming a basis for later tissue
growth.
Collagen is being used to raise
depressed scars such as those
caused by acne. The collagen is
injected into the tissue beneath
the scar in a saline solution,
which is absorbed. The collagen
then undergoes cellular in
vasion and vascularization, the
growth of blood vessels. The col
lagen softens the scars and
raises them, filling contour de
tects.
Collagen therapy compares
favorably with other forms of
treatment such as
dermabrasion, in which the skin
itself is sanded down and al
lowed to grow back. The costs
are in the same range but col
lagen avoids the risks of scar

ring and uneven pigmentation.
Also, the patient can continue
his regular work and activities
while the treatment takes place
as a series of injections spaced
over several weeks or months.
Collagen itself is the struc
tural protein that makes up the
connective tissue in the body.
.Judy Boshart of Palo Alto's Col
lagen Corporation explained the
function of collagen: "It's what
keeps you from becoming a pud
dle on the floor. Collagen is like
the house in which you live. Any
thing that has structure in it has
collagen."
Collagen is the foundation
upon which the body builds. It
provides the support for other
tissues.
When collagen is damaged or
destroyed in the human body, it
is not regenerated. By injecting
specially processed collagen de
rived from animals, however,
doctors have been able to pro
vide a suitable support for new
tissues to grow and regenerate.
Other materials such as
metal plates or silicone im
plants have been used before to
replace body parts. Collagen,
though, is superior in that it is a

naturally occurring substance
which does not cause rejection.
The processed collagen is ac
tually incorporated into the
structure of the body, forming a
basis for growth that is indist
inguishable from normal tissue.
Boshart noted that damaged
tissue "needs the same matrix
that was destroyed in
place â€” and that's collagen."
The collagen is derived from
cowhide and is purified to re

move any foreign materials
from the matrix, enabling the
human body to use it.
Collagen will have "over
whelming applications," ac
cording to Bushart. Collagen
has potential use in many fields
of medicine because it is so
common in the body. Possi
bilities for the future include
correction of congenital ab
normalities such as closing a
cleft palate, and applications in

the field of dentistry.
Bushart believes that even
tually it may even be possible to
use collagen "as a substrate for
the body to regenerate actual
organs."
Research on collagen is being
done at almost every major in
stitution in the country, accord
ing to Bushart. Here at Stan
ford. Dr. Joseph Rosen is trying
to repair severed nerves in
animals using collagen.
