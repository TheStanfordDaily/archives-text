# Television seen as the caretaker of today's children
## 
### Laurie LaPat-Polasko 
The social influences on
children today are far
more complex and dif
ficult to understand than they
were 30 to 40 years ago. This is
partly due to various major
changes that have occurred
within the family structure and
to the rapid increase in techno
logical innovations.
Last Thursday night, the
Friends of Psychiatry and Be
havioral Sciences sponsored a
(two personi panel discussion
on the "Social Influences on
Childhood." First Dr. Herbert
Leiderman. a psychiatry pro
fessor here, discussed alter
native family lifestyles and how
.they affect a child's develop
ment. Then. Dr. Alberta Siegel,
psychology professor here, ad
dressed the issue of the most
popular technological invention
in the United States today, the
television, and how it influences
children.
What are the effects ot vari
ous family arrangements on
children? Leiderman presented
the results of a study done by
Dr. Bernice Eiduson, a psy
chology professor at UCLA, as
an answer to this question.
Eiduson's study compared
caretaking arrangements and
their effects on young children
of four different family groups,
those being the traditional two
percent family, the single pa
rent family, the family with a
social contract (not married but
ideologically united), and the
communal family. She in
terviewed, observed and stud
ied 200 families before, during
and after their children were
born, until age six.
She found that no matter
which group the child was in.
the more mobility and upsets
the child experienced, the lower
his/her score was on a standard
ized psychological tests. This
mobility, actually moving from
place to place, caused changing
relationships and very little sta
bility.
However, the children in
traditional families and the sin
gle-parent families were more
affected by these upsets than

children in the social contract or
communal units.
Leiderman's interpretation
was that in the social'contract
and communal families,
egalitarian caretaking occurred
and this was more beneficial to
the development of the child.
She has concluded that addi
tional caretakers mitigate the
negative effects of high in
stability for children.
Leiderman also discussed her
analysis of family units in the
Kikuyu community in Africa,
which she studied during a 6-
month stay. In this tribe, be
cause the mother has so many
tasks, the infant caretaking sys
tem includes other caretakers,
such as older daughters (mean
ing over age seven).
The major effect of this mul
tiple-parent caretaking is en
hanced cognitive development
of children tor it improved their
test performances. This im
provement was mainly at
tributed to the social stimu
lation caretakers provided.
Following Leiberman's pres
entation, Dr. Siegel considered
the effects of a very different
'caretaker' in our society, the
TV. Dr. Siegel stated that chil
dren's lives are no longer
shaped by the family, neighbor
hood and school, but by the TV
set. Today more homes have
TVs than have refrigerators or
indoor plumbing.
The only activity American
people spend more time doing
than watching TV is sleeping.
Children begin watching TV at
age two and by age three have
'favorite' programs which they
want three to four hours per
day. Viewing peaks at age 1,
tapers oft during the teens and
rises sharply for the elderly.
What are these TV 'addicts'
watching? According to Siegel,
two-thirds of all characters on
TV are involved in violent acts,
and criminals are by far the
most common characters. The
male is mostly the perpetrator
of the violent act, while the
female is usually the victim.
The average TV-watching
child will also see 10 alcohol
drinking acts per night where its

use relays the idea ot tension re
lief.
Furthermore, only 10 percent
of TV characters are obese,
whereas, the national per
centage is approximately 25 to
35 percent of the population.
Doctors and nurses are seen five
times as often on TV as in the
real world, and the most com
mon topic of discussion on TV is
health and illness problems.
The effects of TV on children
have been heavily researched
tor the past 25 years. Stanford
has been the fountainhead of

this research. Such research
has revealed several aspects of
the effects of TV on children.
First, said Siegel, simply ap
pearing on television confirms
status of people so that children
believe Ihe people they see on
TV are the significant people of
our culture. TV also creates and
propagates fads, in dress, hair
styles and speech, said Siegel.
Furthermore, TV tends to
create role expectations; chil
dren expect the people they
meet to be and act like the peo
ple on TV. thereby providing

children with models, both pro
and anti-social ones. Children,
explained Siegel, will imitate
what they see and incorporate it
into their own mannerisms
Finally, TV socializes chil
dren to be consumers, accord
ing to Siegel, which is really
TV's main intention. It creates
interests in products and brand
preference at an early age.
When asked how much and
which television shows a child
should watch, Siegel simply re
plied. "Watch television with
your child!"

into their own mannerisms
Finally, TV socializes chil
dren to be consumers, accord
ing to Siegel, which is really
TV's main intention. It creates
interests in products and brand
preference at an early age.
When asked how much and
which television shows a child
should watch, Siegel simply re
plied. "Watch television with
your child!"
The social influences on
children today are far
more complex and dif
ficult to understand than they
were 30 to 40 years ago. This is
partly due to various major
changes that have occurred
within the family structure and
to the rapid increase in techno
logical innovations.
Last Thursday night, the
Friends of Psychiatry and Be
havioral Sciences sponsored a
(two personi panel discussion
on the "Social Influences on
Childhood." First Dr. Herbert
Leiderman. a psychiatry pro
fessor here, discussed alter
native family lifestyles and how
.they affect a child's develop
ment. Then. Dr. Alberta Siegel,
psychology professor here, ad
dressed the issue of the most
popular technological invention
in the United States today, the
television, and how it influences
children.
What are the effects ot vari
ous family arrangements on
children? Leiderman presented
the results of a study done by
Dr. Bernice Eiduson, a psy
chology professor at UCLA, as
an answer to this question.
Eiduson's study compared
caretaking arrangements and
their effects on young children
of four different family groups,
those being the traditional two
percent family, the single pa
rent family, the family with a
social contract (not married but
ideologically united), and the
communal family. She in
terviewed, observed and stud
ied 200 families before, during
and after their children were
born, until age six.
She found that no matter
which group the child was in.
the more mobility and upsets
the child experienced, the lower
his/her score was on a standard
ized psychological tests. This
mobility, actually moving from
place to place, caused changing
relationships and very little sta
bility.
However, the children in
traditional families and the sin
gle-parent families were more
affected by these upsets than

children in the social contract or
communal units.
Leiderman's interpretation
was that in the social'contract
and communal families,
egalitarian caretaking occurred
and this was more beneficial to
the development of the child.
She has concluded that addi
tional caretakers mitigate the
negative effects of high in
stability for children.
Leiderman also discussed her
analysis of family units in the
Kikuyu community in Africa,
which she studied during a 6-
month stay. In this tribe, be
cause the mother has so many
tasks, the infant caretaking sys
tem includes other caretakers,
such as older daughters (mean
ing over age seven).
The major effect of this mul
tiple-parent caretaking is en
hanced cognitive development
of children tor it improved their
test performances. This im
provement was mainly at
tributed to the social stimu
lation caretakers provided.
Following Leiberman's pres
entation, Dr. Siegel considered
the effects of a very different
'caretaker' in our society, the
TV. Dr. Siegel stated that chil
dren's lives are no longer
shaped by the family, neighbor
hood and school, but by the TV
set. Today more homes have
TVs than have refrigerators or
indoor plumbing.
The only activity American
people spend more time doing
than watching TV is sleeping.
Children begin watching TV at
age two and by age three have
'favorite' programs which they
want three to four hours per
day. Viewing peaks at age 1,
tapers oft during the teens and
rises sharply for the elderly.
What are these TV 'addicts'
watching? According to Siegel,
two-thirds of all characters on
TV are involved in violent acts,
and criminals are by far the
most common characters. The
male is mostly the perpetrator
of the violent act, while the
female is usually the victim.
The average TV-watching
child will also see 10 alcohol
drinking acts per night where its

use relays the idea ot tension re
lief.
Furthermore, only 10 percent
of TV characters are obese,
whereas, the national per
centage is approximately 25 to
35 percent of the population.
Doctors and nurses are seen five
times as often on TV as in the
real world, and the most com
mon topic of discussion on TV is
health and illness problems.
The effects of TV on children
have been heavily researched
tor the past 25 years. Stanford
has been the fountainhead of

this research. Such research
has revealed several aspects of
the effects of TV on children.
First, said Siegel, simply ap
pearing on television confirms
status of people so that children
believe Ihe people they see on
TV are the significant people of
our culture. TV also creates and
propagates fads, in dress, hair
styles and speech, said Siegel.
Furthermore, TV tends to
create role expectations; chil
dren expect the people they
meet to be and act like the peo
ple on TV. thereby providing

children with models, both pro
and anti-social ones. Children,
explained Siegel, will imitate
what they see and incorporate it
into their own mannerisms
Finally, TV socializes chil
dren to be consumers, accord
ing to Siegel, which is really
