# A 						study you can sleep through

Brring. Buzz. Beep. Whatever the sound
is, if it just woke you up, you're probably
wishing you could sleep as long as you
wanted .
Stanford sleep researchers have fulfilled
just such a dream. Charles Czeisler of Stan
ford's Sleep Disorders Research Center and
his colleagues have been conducting experi
ments that allow volunteers to sleep whenever
and as long as they like without interruption.
And as idyllic as this sounds, the studies may
have major implications tor our understanding
ot human sleep patterns and curing various
sleep disorders.
Czeisler designed his experiments to re
move the usual time cues that structure indi
vidual sleep habits , thereby letting the body
find its natural rhythm. (Most people's body
clocks are set for a 25 hour time period to fit
with light-dark and work hour schedules.)
Subjects lived in specially designed apart
ments. For dp to six months they were not al
lowed access to anything that might reveal the
time of day. Instead, volunteers were urged to
sleep and wake as they desired.
At first, there seemed to be no pattern to vol
unteers' sleeping and waking cycles. A rela
tionship heat and sleeping was
noted—the body temperatures routinely began
slipping before sleep, was lowest as they tell
asleep, and crept back up as they slept-but the
cycles seemed to fall out of unison period
ically.
Researchers also observed that while body
temperature rhythm stayed near normal, the
sleep cycle spanned from 30 to 50 hours.
Closer examination ot these seemingly er
ratic habits revealed that the body's circadian
rhythms were the determining factor in under
standing sleep patterns. Circadian rhythms

cause the body's temperature to oscillate as
the body falls in and out of the sleep pattern.
When research subjects chose to go to bed at a
low body temperature point, they slept an av
erage of 7.8 hours. But if they chose to sleep at
their highest temperature, they slept almost
twice as Jong.
, "The most important factor in determining
the length and internal structure of sleep is
when you go to sleep, not how long you've been
deprived of sleep," said Czeisler.
Circadian rhythms also help explain why
people tend to have difficulty sleeping at timfes
society considers unusual. The body rhythms
are usually cycled to keep in tune with the
earth's 24-hour light- dark cycle and social
cues. But if regular cues are ignored or
drastically altered, the body adapts its own
beat and Sometimes falls out of sine, which can
lead to erratic sleep and fatigue patterns.
According to Czeisler, it is "an advantage
for man to be on a 25-hour cycle, because inter
ruptions (such as an alarm) help reset the
body's clock. If the body clock isn't reset in a
regular pattern, sleep disorders may occur.
"People just don't realize how important
regularity in their sleeping habits is," said
Czeisler. "Hamsters ,and blowflys whose
schedule is shifted by six hours every week in
experiments have a 25 percent shorter life
span."
Czeisler and other researchers across the
country are using what has been learned to.
treat people with sleep schedule problems such
as insomnia. They help the patient understand
his or her body clock and adjust their sleeping
habits to increase the amount of time spent
sleeping.
"The results of our studies allow us to begin
applying the principles of circadian physiology
to sleep processes in man," Czeisler said.
