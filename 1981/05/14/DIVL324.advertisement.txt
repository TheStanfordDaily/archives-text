UNDERGRADUATE HOUSING
Spring Housing Draw
Round one results and draw materials for round two are
now available in residence hall offices and at the Stanford
Housing Center (room 317, Old Union). All students who
entered the draw should check the results and decide how
they wish to participate in round two.
Draw assignments are not final until round two has been
completed.
If you wish to (1) drop out of the draw, or (2) accept your
round one assignment before round two, you must pick
up, complete, and return your second draw card by Fri
day, May 15.
