# Cap and Gown honor society benefits outstanding women
## 
### Cathy Janus 
To honor the women who have
contributed to the Stanford
community by participating in
extra-curricular activities and
have demonstrated academic
superiority, the Cap and Gown
honor society was organized in
1905.
The organization is still going

''Each year the club is a different entity
simply because the cast of characters
changes. Some years it is more active than
others.'

strong, and on Saturday, May 9,
alumni and active members
met at the Faculty Club for a
luncheon where they welcomed
new members, listened to a
speaker, and talked. The oldest
surviving member, Ruth
Hoskinson, class of '909, was
present.
"In the old days there was an
academic standard that had to
be met by the girls who wished
to join Cap and Gown, but now

we realize they deserve recogni
tion if they've been accepted (at
Stanford) and are active,".said
Jean Coblentz, president of the
Alumni Board.
She said highly visible women
used to be chosen by the "ac
tives" (the senior members),
but in the 1960s many questioned
if this was fair. "The applica-

tion process evolved, and active
members now choose from
these applications. There is no
limit to the number of members
chosen." Although some mem
bers are juniors, the majority
are seniors, Coblentz said.
Cap and Gown members are
"women at Stanford who care
about doing something for Stan
ford, rather than simply getting
an education. These girls'
purpose is to enhance the com

munity in addition to being stu
dents," Coblentz said "Each
year the club is a different enti
ty simply because the cast of
characters changes. Some
years it is more active than oth
ers," she added.
The club's main function is to
earn money for two scholar
ships (one full and one partial
scholarship) which are awarded
to Stanford students. The funds
are raised by selling calendars
that are compiled and published
by the alumni board.
In addition to selling calen
dars, the women help the alum
ni out during various functions,
have teas and luncheons, pub
lish a newsletter, and they held
a tailgater for one of the football
games, said Jeannene Johnson,
a senior member.
Coblentz said that at the
calendar tea every fall the new
calendar is unveiled, and the ac
tives are given the opportunity
to tell about themselves.
"The speakers at the spring
luncheons give an image of what
women can do," said Coblentz.
Many of the speakers are Cap
and Gowners; some have be
come chaplains, and one is the

mayor of Modesto. Coblentz
said.
This year's speaker was Mar
ylyn Morrell, one ot the found
ers and present chairman ot the
board of directors of the Re
source Center for Women, lo
cated on Sherman Avenue in
Palo Alto.
Morrell said that women
should be persistent and self
confident. "You are important
and you really can make a dif
ference. Take your own lives
and say, 'Hey, I can do that,' and
then go and do it," she said.
Morrell said two things that
hold women back are a lack of
self confidence and a lack of in
formation. Morrell and three
friends opened the resource cen
ter because they found that too
many women "complain
without doing anything; they
were going nowhere." The cen
ter is "action, as opposed to a
discussion group "
The center offers courses in
communications, how not to be
afraid ot computers, and em
ployment related courses.
"That's where the need is,"
Morrell said. There is also a li
brary, job listings, job develop

ment files, sample applications,
and volunteer opportunities
She said that by volunteering,
women gain necessary ex
perience. but women "are less
willing to do this now than they
were in the past."
Morrell said that they had dif
ficulties in the beginning finding
sufficient funds, but then they
began to receive donations.

women were accepted to medical
school. The idea was that lots of money
would be spent to educate them, and then
they would get married and their training
would not be used.'

"The state didn't know what to
make of a women's group when
we asked for a tax exemption;
the business community is very
supportive. They believe in put
ting women in business."
The center helps many wom
en who are readjusting from a
home-oriented schedule, but 25
percent of the clients are under
25, Morrell said.

" Careers used to be secon
dary for women. now a career is
primary." said Coblentz. She
said when she attended Stanford
"we weren't headed in a career
mode; career women were
those who couldn't find Mr.
Right."
Along with the speaker, the
actives and alumni talked about
their experiences "The gather-

ings also give you a chance to
mingle with those that are
younger and older than you,"
said Coblentz. She said that over
the years "expectations change
. . . but kids are still bright,
motivated, talented, moral, ex
citing, and fun to be around."
Mildred Worsnick, class of
1926, said Stanford offered typ
ing and shortland classes in a
basement when she was in
school. "At that time typing
skills opened many doors," she
said.
Worsnick said it is wonderful
what is offered at Stanford.
While she said her education
was worthwhile she said she

finds that there are "more
educational opportunities now
Through all the years it gives
me a thrill to have graduated
from Stanford I am very proud
of it."
Roz Bacon lives on campus;
her house is on May field next to
the Beta's. She has lived on
campus since she attended Stan
ford in the late 1920s "Women
have become more interested in
intercollegiate sports We used
to have play days with women
from three schools, UC-
Berkeley, Mills and Stanford,
combined into two teams."
Bacon said they had to fit
their educational programs in
with the men's "In the late
1920s there was one woman en
gineer. It was looked upon as an
unusual profession for women."
Women interested in medical
school also had obstacles to ov
ercome, she said "Few women
were accepted to medical
school. The idea was that lots of
money would be spent to
educate them and then they
would get married and their
training would not be used.
Teaching was the one field open
to women," said Bacon.
Applications for juniors in
terested in becoming Cap and
Gown members will be taken
Tuesday, May '2 through Tues
day, May 9. Applications can
be picked up at Joanne van
Erp's room, Rinconada 2 0.
