## Don't write off grammar 
### 
(Editors note Michael Selmi claims he "really
can write good" and that "the style of the paper is
to enhance the article. ")
It is often reasonable not to expect too much
from education, or at the very least, not to over
estimate its new worth However, a modest ex
pectation would be that after 6 years of education
a student would be able to write good. Hardly
Of the numerous senior evaluations the one that
is both the most striking and appalling is that
most students felt "their ability to write had not
improved during their years at Stanford."
This could be the result of any one of three rea
sons: first, most students had perfect writing
when they entered Stanford. Unfortunately, this
is doubtful and could be easily verified by asking
any professor for an assessment of their student's
writing.
Second, it could be that the majority ot students
have never written a paper in their years here
This, too, is unrealistic. It would be virtually im
possible for a student to not have written a paper
here. Unless, of course the student did not com
plete the general requirements, or did not turn in
any ot the assigned papers. But then the student
would not be a graduating senior.
This leads one to the third and most probable
reason, Stanford's writing program is failing, and
failing bad.
" v Here, like at most universities, all that is re
quired out of a student in terms ot writing training
is Freshman English. Passing Freshman English,
and who doesn't, is believed to be sufficient to de
velop writing proficiency.
However, the current writing program has
many problems. Judging from the results ot the
senior survey, it is not helping student's to signifi
cantly improve one's writing.
* Certainly, writing about one's summer for the
sixteenth time promotes neither creativity or ad
. ditional skills. Moreover, the theme-orientation
tof the classes often places the emphasis on the
•sheme rather than on writing skills. Although stu
dents do write a number of papers, the actual me
chanics ot writing are generally subordinate to
!Hhe theme ot the class.
5 Similarly, the classes are both undemanding
Jind unstimulating. Even illiterate papers receive
« B+, and most ot the critical remarks are not
jtnough to till and 8 x "0 note card. I clearly re
member a paper free ot marks with the final
.Statement, "Too full of language." A great help
Jndeed.
£ A final criticism is that few classes stress
grammar. The ones that do are perennial low
fhoices between students. In fact, the only real
rammar class is taught through linguistics de
partment, and everyone knows that nobody takes
linguistics classes. You have to know 17 languages
to take linguistics.

The proper conclusion, then, is that Stanford
students cannot write well because no one teaches
them to The value of the one-shot Freshman Eng
lish program is at best quite limited. Indeed, one
would have to go to great lengths to extremely
profit from the current writing program.
And what makes the problem more significant
is that writing is a most basic element to success
in any facet ot society If you can't write you can't
communicate Whether it is to write an irate let
ter or applying for a job. writing skills are critical
tor mere survival.
Students, graduate schools, and employers all
complain about the inadequacy of graduating stu
dents' writing, and yet nothing is done to rectify
the situation
Perhaps the reason for the present deficient
program is that the premise ot the system — stu
dents learn to write in high school — is false Stu
dents are supposed to learn to write before they
get to college but invariably few do. Hence, sever
al steps should be taken to improve the writing
programs at Stanford and ultimately to improve a
student's writing skills.
The program should be restructured to make is
more instructive rather than enjoyable. Similar
ly, by transforming the program into a tour-year
program — a class a year — would help both to
build and impound writing skills into students.
It is also important that at least one of the
classes, preferably two. are structured grammar
courses. Although grammar courses are often
boring, the skills to be acquired from these
classes are too valuable to ignore simply to avoid
a dull class.
A further but equally important step would be
to have professors either reject papers with sub
stantial grammatical problems or grade down tor
errors. This would force students to be more cons
cientious and caretul in their writing.
Oddly enough, the University seems to place a
heavy emphasis on writing. However, although
actual writing is the best means to improvement,
without the necessary knowledge and skills writ
ing papers will be ot little benefit. Students will
simply repeat the same errors and receive the
same grades, and never improve.
The assumption that students already know
how to write well when they get to college has em
phastically been proven to be incorrect. Writing is
a basic and necessary skill, yet colleges fail to
make real efforts to provide students with writing
skills.
The system needs to be revamped to ensure that
students learn to write before graduating from
college. Several modifications of the current writ
ing requirement may in fact be enough to enable
students to learn to write good.

here. Unless, of course the student did not com
plete the general requirements, or did not turn in
any ot the assigned papers. But then the student
would not be a graduating senior.
This leads one to the third and most probable
reason, Stanford's writing program is failing, and
failing bad.
" v Here, like at most universities, all that is re
quired out of a student in terms ot writing training
is Freshman English. Passing Freshman English,
and who doesn't, is believed to be sufficient to de
velop writing proficiency.
However, the current writing program has
many problems. Judging from the results ot the
senior survey, it is not helping student's to signifi
cantly improve one's writing.
* Certainly, writing about one's summer for the
sixteenth time promotes neither creativity or ad
. ditional skills. Moreover, the theme-orientation
tof the classes often places the emphasis on the
•sheme rather than on writing skills. Although stu
dents do write a number of papers, the actual me
chanics ot writing are generally subordinate to
!Hhe theme ot the class.
5 Similarly, the classes are both undemanding
Jind unstimulating. Even illiterate papers receive
« B+, and most ot the critical remarks are not
jtnough to till and 8 x "0 note card. I clearly re
member a paper free ot marks with the final
.Statement, "Too full of language." A great help
Jndeed.
£ A final criticism is that few classes stress
grammar. The ones that do are perennial low
fhoices between students. In fact, the only real
rammar class is taught through linguistics de
partment, and everyone knows that nobody takes
linguistics classes. You have to know 17 languages
to take linguistics.

The proper conclusion, then, is that Stanford
students cannot write well because no one teaches
them to The value of the one-shot Freshman Eng
lish program is at best quite limited. Indeed, one
would have to go to great lengths to extremely
profit from the current writing program.
And what makes the problem more significant
is that writing is a most basic element to success
in any facet ot society If you can't write you can't
communicate Whether it is to write an irate let
ter or applying for a job. writing skills are critical
tor mere survival.
Students, graduate schools, and employers all
complain about the inadequacy of graduating stu
dents' writing, and yet nothing is done to rectify
the situation
Perhaps the reason for the present deficient
program is that the premise ot the system — stu
dents learn to write in high school — is false Stu
dents are supposed to learn to write before they
get to college but invariably few do. Hence, sever
al steps should be taken to improve the writing
programs at Stanford and ultimately to improve a
student's writing skills.
The program should be restructured to make is
more instructive rather than enjoyable. Similar
ly, by transforming the program into a tour-year
program — a class a year — would help both to
build and impound writing skills into students.
It is also important that at least one of the
classes, preferably two. are structured grammar
courses. Although grammar courses are often
boring, the skills to be acquired from these
classes are too valuable to ignore simply to avoid
a dull class.
A further but equally important step would be
to have professors either reject papers with sub
stantial grammatical problems or grade down tor
errors. This would force students to be more cons
cientious and caretul in their writing.
Oddly enough, the University seems to place a
heavy emphasis on writing. However, although
actual writing is the best means to improvement,
without the necessary knowledge and skills writ
ing papers will be ot little benefit. Students will
simply repeat the same errors and receive the
same grades, and never improve.
The assumption that students already know
how to write well when they get to college has em
phastically been proven to be incorrect. Writing is
a basic and necessary skill, yet colleges fail to
make real efforts to provide students with writing
skills.
The system needs to be revamped to ensure that
students learn to write before graduating from
college. Several modifications of the current writ
ing requirement may in fact be enough to enable
students to learn to write good.
