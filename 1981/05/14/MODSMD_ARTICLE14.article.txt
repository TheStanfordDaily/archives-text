Bombs away
In his recent column (Daily,
May 11), Paul Baer offers some
convincing reasons not to base
the MX missle in the shell-game
mode in Utah and Nevada. In
contrast, the various sea-based
modes now being discussed are
superior for reasons of cost, se
curity and preservation of the
environment.
Baer also argues that the MX
program itself, regardless of
the basing mode, threatens our
security. This argument, I be
lieve, is not persuasive.
Baer's primary concern
seems to be that the system will
provoke the Soviets into a first
strike. Our possession of a first
strike capability, he suggest,
will make the Soviets feel "vul
nerable," and in time of crisis
tempt them to shoot first. In this
characterization, Baer ignores
the crucial role of the MX as a
second-strike deterrent.
Even the stauchest sup-

porters of arms control admit
the current vulnerability of our
Minuteman missle force. In
deed, some experts estimate
that the Soviets, using only one
third of their strategic force,
could destroy 90 percent of our
land based ICBMs, as well as
the 50 percent of our submarine
force in port for servicing at any
given time and a good share of
our B-525.
It is clear that we need a sur
vivable accurate heavy missle,
capable of destroying strategic
Soviet targets in a second
strike. This is the purpose of the
MX. We should not be deterred
from implementing it because
of Baer's unfounded tears or So
viet posturing.
To accept Baer's premise, in
fact, would be to admit now the
Finlandization of America that
will certainly result if we fairto
strengthen our strategic forces.
Let us hope that that day never
comes.
