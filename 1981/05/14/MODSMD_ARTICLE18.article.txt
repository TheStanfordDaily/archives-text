Strolling down the Champs
Ellysees in Paris the other day,
I overheard the following con
versation as I passed a sidewalk
cafe:
"Chantelle, ave you zeen dee
lateest fazhions from Monsieur
Chritian Dior. He az made dee
mose vonderful pink and yellow
zummer dress."
"Yez, Michelle, I ave zeen it,
but I must tell you zat it zimply
doz not compare to vhat dey are
vearing at Stanford deze days."
The day before that, I was
eating in what is reputedly the

finest restaurant in all of Italy. I
heard the following conversa
tion from an adjoining table:
"Aya, Papa, don'ta youa
tinka data disa chickena isa
greata? Thea chefa madea ita
justa likea youa likea ita."
"Youa righta, sona, buta la
musta tella youa thata I hearda
thata theya makea disha ata
Stanforda thata isa justa outa
thisa worlda."
Finally, the day before that, I
was taking a safari in Africa.
Our group came upon a group of
natives and we overheard the
following:
"Oug mowa owa kaka data."
"Mano ama owa dada Stan
ford."
"Ooga Mooga Mooga Stan
ford."
In case you did not understand
the preceding dialogue, it
means:
"Have < you seen the new
great-looking native women
that moved into the village?"
"Forget about them. The oth
er day I met some Stanford
women. They're the best."
"Yea, I heard about those
Stanford women."
What is the point of these
anecdotes? There are three pos
sibilities:
1) I am trying to boast about
my travels around the world.
2) I am a compulsive liar.
3) I am trying to show just
how popular the Stanford con
cept has become.
Yes, that is right! It's number
three. In case you have not no
ticed, Stanford is presently the
hottest thing going. No longer
are students the only peopWthat
want to be involved with the
University. Presently, ev
eryone wants a piece of the ac
tion. In the fashion world, the
food industry, the record in
dustry — the lastest LSJUMB
release is busting out on all ra
dio stations — and other in
dustries as well, the University
is now considered to be most ac
curate gauge of future trends.

What bothers me is that no
body is taking advantage of the
potential market value of Stan
ford. Consider the following
tacts:
; .) Within this university lies
the number one business school
in the country.
2) In a study recently done
here, when students were asked
why they came to Stanford, nine
out of ten urider-grads gave the
following response: ''I'm here
tor the exceptional education
that I can receive from my in
structors as well as from my fel
low students ... in actuality,
I'm here because I want to learn
something and I figure why not
learn in sunshine . . . okay, al
ready, if you really want to
know, I'm here because I know
that a Stanford diploma can put
me into the bucks as quickly as
any other diploma can."
In conclusion, there is a per
vading desire on this campus to
make money. But why wait?
Right now the Stanford concept
is so hot that anything with a
Stanford insignia would sell. We
simply have to turn Stanford
University into Stanford Inc.,
and then dump Stanford prod
ucts onto the market.
I have recently conducted
some studies in certain in
dustries. For example, speak
ing quantitively, the garment
industry is in a slump. There are
no exciting products on the mar
ket. Stanford could provide the
stimulus.
I can envision the television
commercials advertising the
new Stanford line of clothing: a
young boy is walking down the
street when suddenly he sees
basketball star Larry Bird. The
boys says, "Hey Larry, how do
you feel today?"
Larry responds, "Just
great."
"Why? Because the Celtics
beat the 76ers in the NBA semi
finals?" the boys asks innocent
ly-
"Of course not, you jerk,"
Larry replies. "I feel great be
cause I just bought new
polyester Stanford pants, 5 new
Cardinal insignia shirts, and I

even have some Stanford of the
Loom undies. With these clothes
I feel just plain intelligent."
I also did some studies of the
food industry, and came up with
the following statistics:
The food industry is in a big
ger slump than the garmet in
dustry.
Stanford can be the stimulus
to the food industry. Engineers
should get together and figure
out a really Stanfordy way of
packing food. If people know
that food is coming out of Stan
ford. they will definitely buy it
in mass quanitities.
Presently, Stern food service
makes food for about 700 stu
dents. It would not be difficult to
make food for another 90 or 100
million people.
Obviously, as soon as people
taste this Stern food, they will
realize just how stomach
wrenching it really is. However,
the profits from the initial sales
— those sales that occur before
the consumer has tested the
product will be enormous.
Finally, our biggest product
will be life-size wooden dolls
that when wound up, turn into
authentic Stanford women. The
advertising slogan can be the
following": "They cook, they
sew, they wash clothes, and they
derive mathematical formulas
in less than three minutes. Yes,
that's right, for just $6.99, you
too can be the proud possessor
of a Stanford Doll. Simply wind
her up, and she will act just like
a Stanford girl. Being wooden,
this doll will even imitate the
traditional Stanford-woman
personality.
One warning: Do not take
these dolls into a bedroom.
These dolls are not equipped for
this part of the house, and they
will cease to function when
brought into it. As you can see,
they imitate the real Stanford
woman in everv way.
In conclusion, with imagina
tion you can accomplish any
thing.
