# Med students may lose say in admission
## 
### David Frank 
Despite firm opposition from Medi
cal School students, the Medical
School Faculty Senate is considering
curtailing student participation in the
Medical School admissions process.
According to medical students and
faculty, a Med School Faculty Senate
ad hoc Committee on Admissions Poli
cy will likely propose to the full Senate
on May 22 that student voting partici
pation on the Committee on Ad
missions (COA) be eliminated. The
COA makes final decisions on ad
missions to the Medical School.
Med School faculty members ap
pear divided over the issue. Some see
the elimination of student voting as a

way to streamline the admissions
process; others demur, fearing they
will alienate students.
The students view the prospect of
losing the voting participation as a
gross intringement on their partici
pation in administrative activities and
as a blow to the admissions process.
Stanford has let medical students
vote on the admission of their peers
for the last decade. Other top medical
schools that follow the same practice
include Columbia, Cornell, Duke,
Harvard, and the University of Penn
sylvania.
Debra Johnson, fourth-year student
and a member ot the COA, said the
students are aghast (also see accom

panyinH article). "I think the students
see the end to student voting partici
pation as a giant step backward for
what has been a progressive medical
school," she said.
Of all the committees on which the
students participate and vote, none is
as significant as the COA because it
votes on who will be accepted in the
entering class, Johnson said. Any re
ductions in student participation
jeopardize the quality of students that
are admitted, she added.
"Med School students, because they
have just finished their undergraduate
years," Johnson said "are in some
ways much more attuned than are the
faculty to candidates showing outstan
ding academic and leadership poten
tial."
Flout school's philosophy
The changes would also flout the
Medical School's "basic philosophy"
of training future medical leaders.
Johnson said. "The faculty seems to
feel it has made a mistake in allowing
student participation on governance
committees. How can we be leaders
when the faculty tries to reduce our
potential leadership and make us fol
lowers?"
Noe Martinez, a third-year student
and another member of the COA,
speculated as to the Senate's motives:
"They (faculty members) say they
want to speed up the admissions proc
ess by saving student and faculty
time. I don't see this as a valid reason.
I think they see the students as a
threat."
Currently, 21 students and 56 faculty
members participate in Medical
School admissions. Three panels, in
cluding 7 students, help read applica
tions, interview candidates, and make
recomendations tor admittance.
The four students and 16 faculty
members on the COA take panel rec
ommendations and vote to decide who
is admitted. (For the class entering
last autumn, 186 were admitted; 86
matriculated).
'Cost effective'
According to Dr. Avram Goldstein,
head of the Medical School Faculty
Senate, the admissions process needs
to be made more "cost effective." Re
ducing the time students and faculty
members spend on various admissions
activities is one way to accomplish
this goal.
Although Goldstein said he doesn't
teel it is "appropriate tor students to
be voting" on the admission of other
students, he said he feels students play
an important role in other admission
steps — particularly in recruiting.
"I think that attitude is more than
just a bad show of faith," said Pamela
Steele, Stanford Medical Students As
sociation vice-president. She said it
shows the students that the faculty
wants to "run" admissions and that
students would not be treated as
equals in the decision-making proc
ess.
If student involvement in ad
missions doesn't include work in de
ciding who gets admitted, Steele

added, "we're going to be much less
likely to want to recruit them (stu
dents who are admitted)."
Dr. Roy Maftly, incoming director
of admissions and a member ot the ad
hoc Committee on Admissions Policy,
said time concerns are important rea
sons tor changing admissions policy.
Currently, he noted, each ot the 6000
applications received by the Medical
School each year is read by a student
and a faculty member. Further, stu
dents and faculty members conduct
separate interviews of about 600 appli
cants. and about halt the interviews
hre done in Chicago or New York City.
Matfly said he believes a majority
of the ad hoc committee "seems to
teel that medical students should not
be voting on the final step of ad
missions." However, he added, the
committee members seem to tavor
continued involvement on the three
admissions panels.
Eliminate Interviews
Beside the possibility of eliminating
student voting participation on the
COA, Maftly said the ad hoc commit
tee is also considering recommending
the elimination ot interviews. Instead,
Matfly noted, a computer could be
used to cull out those applicants with
less desirable grade point averages
and Medical College Aptitude Test
(MCAT) scores.
However, according to Med School
Associate Dean ot Student Affairs
John Steward, "chances aren't likely"
that the interview will be ended. Stew
ard, another member of the ad hoc
committee, said interviews have
helped admissions staff to spot out
standing candidates who, by their
written application alone, would not
otherwise appear so outstanding. In
addition, he said, interviews help spot
candidates who are not as outstanding
as they appear on paper.
Matfly agreed with Steward on the
interview changes, but said the facul
ty needs more "informed input" from
students on the voting policy change.
"We've heard conflicting reports,"
he said adding, "If the students don't
feel the action (to end voting partici
pation on the COA) is appropriate,
then that alarms me. I'm very con
cerned to have the faculty take an ac
tion which is devisive."
Dr. Laurence Kedes, out-going di
rector of admissions and ad hoc com
mittee member, said he believes "it
would be a terrible mistake to reduce
student participation in the ad
missions process at any level —
whether it be in voting, reading ap
plications or interviewing."
Further, Kedes said, any alteration
in admissions will hurt minority stu
dents. Several minority students work
in admissions, but there are virtually
no minority faculty members tor such
work, he noted. In fact, only one black
and four Hispanic faculty members
work in clinical departments of the
Med School.
"This means that the strongest in
put from the minority community into

the admissions process has been trom
the minority students serving in ad
missions,'.' he said.
What Kedes said he objects to is that
the director of admissions doesn't
select the students who serve on the
admissions panels and on the COA.
Currently, the Stanford Medical Stu
dents Association, the medical
school's student government, makes
the selections. Alternatively, Kedes
noted, the director of admissions, in
consultation with the the Medical
School dean, selects faculty members

for admissions work.
The dean of admissions should have
control over selecting the students
serving on the panels and the COA,
Kedes said.
The ad hoc Committee on Ad
missions Policy proposals are not nec
cesarily final. The committee's re
comendation could be approved, dis
aproved or delayed for action to future
meetings Faculty Senate meetings
during the summer — when many
medical students are away from cam
pus.
