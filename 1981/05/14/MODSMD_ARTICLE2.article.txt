# Med students may lose say in admission
## 
### David Frank 
Despite firm opposition from Medi
cal School students, the Medical
School Faculty Senate is considering
curtailing student participation in the
Medical School admissions process.
According to medical students and
faculty, a Med School Faculty Senate
ad hoc Committee on Admissions Poli
cy will likely propose to the full Senate
on May 22 that student voting partici
pation on the Committee on Ad
missions (COA) be eliminated. The
COA makes final decisions on ad
missions to the Medical School.
Med School faculty members ap
pear divided over the issue. Some see
the elimination of student voting as a

way to streamline the admissions
process; others demur, fearing they
will alienate students.
The students view the prospect of
losing the voting participation as a
gross intringement on their partici
pation in administrative activities and
as a blow to the admissions process.
Stanford has let medical students
vote on the admission of their peers
for the last decade. Other top medical
schools that follow the same practice
include Columbia, Cornell, Duke,
Harvard, and the University of Penn
sylvania.
Debra Johnson, fourth-year student
and a member ot the COA, said the
students are aghast (also see accom

panyinH article). "I think the students
see the end to student voting partici
pation as a giant step backward for
what has been a progressive medical
school," she said.
Of all the committees on which the
students participate and vote, none is
as significant as the COA because it
votes on who will be accepted in the
entering class, Johnson said. Any re
ductions in student participation
jeopardize the quality of students that
are admitted, she added.
"Med School students, because they
have just finished their undergraduate
years," Johnson said "are in some
ways much more attuned than are the
faculty to candidates showing outstan
ding academic and leadership poten
tial."
Flout school's philosophy
The changes would also flout the
Medical School's "basic philosophy"
of training future medical leaders.
Johnson said. "The faculty seems to
feel it has made a mistake in allowing
student participation on governance
committees. How can we be leaders
when the faculty tries to reduce our
potential leadership and make us fol
lowers?"
Noe Martinez, a third-year student
and another member of the COA,
speculated as to the Senate's motives:
"They (faculty members) say they
want to speed up the admissions proc
ess by saving student and faculty
time. I don't see this as a valid reason.
I think they see the students as a
threat."
Currently, 21 students and 56 faculty
members participate in Medical
School admissions. Three panels, in
cluding 7 students, help read applica
tions, interview candidates, and make
recomendations tor admittance.
The four students and 16 faculty
members on the COA take panel rec
ommendations and vote to decide who
is admitted. (For the class entering
last autumn, 186 were admitted; 86
matriculated).
'Cost effective'
According to Dr. Avram Goldstein,
head of the Medical School Faculty
Senate, the admissions process needs
to be made more "cost effective." Re
ducing the time students and faculty
members spend on various admissions
activities is one way to accomplish
this goal.
Although Goldstein said he doesn't
teel it is "appropriate tor students to
be voting" on the admission of other
students, he said he feels students play
an important role in other admission
steps â€” particularly in recruiting.
"I think that attitude is more than
just a bad show of faith," said Pamela
Steele, Stanford Medical Students As
sociation vice-president. She said it
shows the students that the faculty
wants to "run" admissions and that
students would not be treated as
equals in the decision-making proc
ess.
If student involvement in ad
missions doesn't include work in de
ciding who gets admitted, Steele

added, "we're going to be much less
likely to want to recruit them (stu
dents who are admitted)."
Dr. Roy Maftly, incoming director
of admissions and a member ot the ad
hoc Committee on Admissions Policy,
said time concerns are important rea
sons tor changing admissions policy.
Currently, he noted, each ot the 6000
applications received by the Medical
School each year is read by a student
and a faculty member. Further, stu
dents and faculty members conduct
separate interviews of about 600 appli
cants. and about halt the interviews
hre done in Chicago or New York City.
Matfly said he believes a majority
of the ad hoc committee "seems to
teel that medical students should not
be voting on the final step of ad
missions." However, he added, the
committee members seem to tavor
continued involvement on the three
admissions panels.
Eliminate Interviews
Beside the possibility of eliminating
student voting participation on the
COA, Maftly said the ad hoc commit
tee is also considering recommending
the elimination ot interviews. Instead,
Matfly noted, a computer could be
used to cull out those applicants with
less desirable grade point averages
and Medical College Aptitude Test
(MCAT) scores.
However, according to Med School
Associate Dean ot Student Affairs
John Steward, "chances aren't likely"
that the interview will be ended. Stew
