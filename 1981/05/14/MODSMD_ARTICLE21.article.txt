## Straddling the tragic and the silly: Noe Valley does Chekhov 
### Stephen Nash 
"The-Seagull" by Anton
Chekhov is a most challenging
play to perform â€” it is a comedy
with a tragic ending, there is lit
tle action, and his characters'
speeches often contradict their
thoughts. Because the audience
must be aware of the underlying
motives of many scenes, and be
aware of fashionable literary

ideas ot the period, it can be a
challenging play to watch as
well.
The central character in "The
Seagull" is the idealistic young
writer Konstantin (Kevin Gar
diner). He is madly in love with
Nina (Kathy Baker), an aspi
ring actress who lives on a
nearby estate, but she cares lit
tle for him. The contrast be

tween their two careers il
lustrates the main themes ot the
play.
In Act I, Konstantin is staging
one of his experimental plays in
the garden ot his uncle's estate,
with Nina acting the sole part.
Konstantin's mother Irina (who
is a famous actress) is quite
jealous: not only because she
was overlooked for the part, but
also because Nina could break
up her affair with Trigorin, a
well-known author. Konstan
tin's play is a failure, not least
because of Nina's inept acting.
However, Nina is a success at
attracting Trigorin's attention.
Acts II and 111 describe
Irina's attempts to get Trigorin
away from the estate, and in
particular away from Nina De
spite all of Irina's efforts, Nina
still manages to initiate an af
fair with him. In the final act,
which takes place two years lat
er, Konstantin has achieved
some success as a writer, and
Nina, her affair with Trigorin
long since over, has a minor ca
reer as an actress. During the
final scene between Nina and

Konstantin, it becomes clear
that, although .Nina is not very
successful, she at least has a
purpose in lite and faith in
herself, while Konstantin, al
though gifted, is a ti ivial writer.
The play ends with Konstantin's
suicide
Chekhov used The Seagull"
to indicate his ideas about writ
ing and about art in general.
When it was written in 18%, the
Symbolist movement was in full
swing, with its demands for
new forms and for the tossing
out of naturalism Also very
popular was Nietzsche's opinion
that creativity was a mystical
and divine force This was very
much in contrast to Chekhov's
teelings that a writer must first
have a purpose in life, and that
then all else would follow natu
rally. He felt that both the form
ot writing and the path of a ca
reer should be subservient to the
goals of the artist
Chekhov satirizes both of the
fashionable ideas by making
Konstantin (who is a Symbolist
writer) and Nina (who naively
repeats Nietzsche's ideas) into

generally ridiculous charac
ters. In addition Chekhov in
serts his own opinions into the
speeches ot a number of charac
ters. Nina, during her final
speech, and Dr. Dorn, through
out much of the play, indicate
the need tor a purpose in life;
Trigorin, through his work hab
its, displays a very mundane
version of the creative process.
Because of the tragic nature
ot the plot (Chekhov labelled
this play a comedy, but he hated
happy endings), and because
this is a play based on
nuances than on action; in
telligent acting and direction
are crucial to a successful per
formance of "The Seagull." The
Noe Valley Theatre Company,
with its beautiful sense of en
semble, does an excellent job of
keeping the play gripping
through all of its four acts.
Much of the comedy comes
from the many ridiculous char
acters in the play.- Masha
(Kathleen Amorose) is in
fatuated by Konstantin, and is
always seeking attention by
dressing in mourning, taking

snuff, and drinking heavily.
Medvedenko (Julian Lopez-
Morilla), her kind-hearted but
thick-headed fiance, never
quite understands all the half
hinted schemes going on around
him The only serious charac
ters (and even this might be
argued) are Irina (Abigail
Booraem) and Trigorin (Jack
Shearer). Even in these roles,
though, the actors keep in mind
the balance that must be main
tained between silliness and
tragedy.
Under the sensitive direction
of Robert Kippur, the whole
cast is very effective at hinting
at the underlying intrigues in
the play.
Throughout the performance,
there is a great attention to de
tail. The end of Act I, for exam
ple, the stage directions call for
the sound of a piano playing in
side the house. A professional
recording could have been used,
but instead it is an amateur per
formance of a Chopin waltz (Op.
70 No. 2 (post.)), complete with
awkward pauses and wrong
notes. Such small extra touches

of realism add much at
mosphere to the play.
This is a very effective pro
duction of "The Seagull." The
intelligence and sensitivity ot
the cast and director make for a
very intense pertormance. a
performance which is both
faithful to Chekhov and satis
fying to the audience
