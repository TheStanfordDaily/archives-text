# Jonathan Richman sings off key to adoring Waldorf
## 
### Chris Butchko 
There really isn't any easy
way to explain Jonathan Rich
man and the Modern Lovers.
He's not really a "rock star," he
isn't a stand-up comedian, and
he definitely isn't anything in
the ordinary. Saturday night at
the Old Waldorf he was show
cased in all his glory, but the
show didn't help any in deciding
what he's about.
Perhaps the best way to in
troduce Jonathan Richman is by
description. In a world of music

that holds a range from Frank
Sinatra to Johnny Ramone,
Richman remains on a branch
by himself. His singing voice
has character, it is true, but it
also has the flaw of having no
true pitch.
.Let's put it baldly — at its
worst, his voice is hideous,
wimplike, painful to listen to.
However, there is a certain "X"
where, having listened to
him often enough, his singing
transcends itselt. After a while,
you find yourself liking it. A lot

of people can sing on key. but
only Richman can make a living
singing like that. There could be
a case tor proclaiming him the
voice of the common man, but
that's stretching a lot ot things;
first and foremost, he is the
voice of Jonathan Richman
As for the songs he writes, the
most important thing to do is to
discard any notion that they are
especially clever, musically in
novative. or capable of hitting
any deeply sensitive nerves. In
stead. they are very simple,
basic, and often quite silly.
What, then, makes him wor
thy of a review, much less ot an
audience?
Jonathan Richman is very en
tertaining. Implausible though
it may seem, he manages to
combine a bad voice and silly
songs into a great show.
It may have been wrong to say
that Richman's songs aren't
very clever. That, as it turns
out, is exactly where the con
fusion lies. The man is so sin
cere in his songs that you don't
really know if the silly ones
were supposed to seem so in
sipid. Take the following lines
from "Marching Martians," tor
instance:
Yeah, the marching martians
arc coming,
they 're taking home movies,
too.
Rut they can't develop film
any better
than the average earthling
can.
You have to wonder if it makes
sense to him.
His backing band, the Modern
Lovers, seemed to watch him

throughoQt the set with a mix
ture of admiration and concern
for his well being Ken Fortia on
piano. Curly Keller on bass, and
Micheal Donabassian on drums
provide a very adept and
straightforward backing tor
Richman's singing Also on
hand were two lovely backup
singers, identified only as Beth
and EUie, who had excellent,
clear voices. The contrast,
needless to say, was obvious
Even though he was playing
to a crowd that already knew
and loved him, Jonathan defi
nitely proved himself a show
man. In person he looked like
the one Stallone brother who
eschewed weightlifting for sing
ing (not a bad analogy for his
singing voice, either); he has
the same innocent blankness in
his face that he writes into his
songs.
Richman started the show by
talking with the audience, and
kept a level of intimacy
throughout, often going off
mike while singing. The
Waldorf is so well suited to that
kind of intimacy that he was
able to perform an entire song a
cappella off-mike. Once, while
he was talking his way through a
chorus, the band drowned out
his words. "Don't worry," he
said into the mike. "I wasn't
saying anything important."
Throughout the show he re
lied on his audience to help him.
At several points he stopped and
announced that he was looking
for a particular mood. He then
stopped to let the audience shout
out suggestions for his next

songs, which, more olten than
not. he followed
Richman interspersed his
songs with a strange, self-depre
cating humor. His band, which
had only been together for a
month, didn't know several of
the songs he wanted to do. He
directed the band to play'' Buzz.
Buzz. Buzz.'' an innovative song
about the sounds bees make, in
the key ot G. "like most ev
erything I write."
Before "Affection," the
nearest thing he has to a theme
song, he noted that "people who
don't speak English very well —
like in Europe — like this song,
maybe better than people who
do speak English well...maybe
they like the chords."
In addition to dancing and
talking to his band. Richman
sang all his hits, like "Back in
Your Life," "(I've Got a Crush
on) The New Teller," and "Ab
dul and Cleopatra." Some of the
best songs he did, however,
were from his new, let's-find-a
label record — for example,
"Can t Let the Neighbors Run
My Life," a song about a man
who wants to invite a woman
over while his wife is away and
worries about what the neigh
bors will think.
Another new song raised an
interesting question about his
intent as a songwriter. Called
"Dick Gregory", it tells how
Richman heard Gregory speak
at Martin Luther King's funer
al. This is touchy material, and
it's performed with a near
gospel feel. Surrounded as it
was by all sorts of light, inconse

quential songs, it made one won
der not only what Richman was
trying to say, but if. indeed, he
was trying to say anything at
all He gave no clue.
That's the mystery of
Jonathan Richman. Does he feel

he sings well? Are there hidden
meanings in songs like "Dick
Gregory"? When he's home
alone at night, does he listen to
Elvis Costello or Perry Como? I
can't tell. All I know is that he
puts on a tun show. Go see him.

also has the flaw of having no
true pitch.
.Let's put it baldly — at its
worst, his voice is hideous,
wimplike, painful to listen to.
However, there is a certain "X"
where, having listened to
him often enough, his singing
transcends itselt. After a while,
you find yourself liking it. A lot

of people can sing on key. but
only Richman can make a living
singing like that. There could be
a case tor proclaiming him the
voice of the common man, but
that's stretching a lot ot things;
first and foremost, he is the
voice of Jonathan Richman
As for the songs he writes, the
most important thing to do is to
discard any notion that they are
especially clever, musically in
novative. or capable of hitting
any deeply sensitive nerves. In
stead. they are very simple,
basic, and often quite silly.
What, then, makes him wor
thy of a review, much less ot an
audience?
Jonathan Richman is very en
tertaining. Implausible though
it may seem, he manages to
combine a bad voice and silly
songs into a great show.
It may have been wrong to say
that Richman's songs aren't
very clever. That, as it turns
out, is exactly where the con
fusion lies. The man is so sin
cere in his songs that you don't
really know if the silly ones
were supposed to seem so in
sipid. Take the following lines
from "Marching Martians," tor
instance:
Yeah, the marching martians
arc coming,
they 're taking home movies,
too.
Rut they can't develop film
any better
than the average earthling
can.
You have to wonder if it makes
sense to him.
His backing band, the Modern
Lovers, seemed to watch him

throughoQt the set with a mix
ture of admiration and concern
for his well being Ken Fortia on
piano. Curly Keller on bass, and
Micheal Donabassian on drums
provide a very adept and
straightforward backing tor
Richman's singing Also on
hand were two lovely backup
singers, identified only as Beth
and EUie, who had excellent,
clear voices. The contrast,
needless to say, was obvious
Even though he was playing
to a crowd that already knew
and loved him, Jonathan defi
nitely proved himself a show
man. In person he looked like
the one Stallone brother who
eschewed weightlifting for sing
ing (not a bad analogy for his
singing voice, either); he has
the same innocent blankness in
his face that he writes into his
songs.
Richman started the show by
talking with the audience, and
kept a level of intimacy
throughout, often going off
mike while singing. The
Waldorf is so well suited to that
kind of intimacy that he was
able to perform an entire song a
cappella off-mike. Once, while
he was talking his way through a
chorus, the band drowned out
his words. "Don't worry," he
said into the mike. "I wasn't
saying anything important."
Throughout the show he re
lied on his audience to help him.
At several points he stopped and
announced that he was looking
for a particular mood. He then
stopped to let the audience shout
out suggestions for his next

songs, which, more olten than
not. he followed
Richman interspersed his
songs with a strange, self-depre
cating humor. His band, which
had only been together for a
month, didn't know several of
the songs he wanted to do. He
directed the band to play'' Buzz.
Buzz. Buzz.'' an innovative song
about the sounds bees make, in
the key ot G. "like most ev
erything I write."
Before "Affection," the
nearest thing he has to a theme
song, he noted that "people who
don't speak English very well —
like in Europe — like this song,
maybe better than people who
do speak English well...maybe
they like the chords."
In addition to dancing and
talking to his band. Richman
sang all his hits, like "Back in
Your Life," "(I've Got a Crush
on) The New Teller," and "Ab
dul and Cleopatra." Some of the
best songs he did, however,
were from his new, let's-find-a
label record — for example,
"Can t Let the Neighbors Run
My Life," a song about a man
who wants to invite a woman
over while his wife is away and
worries about what the neigh
bors will think.
Another new song raised an
interesting question about his
intent as a songwriter. Called
"Dick Gregory", it tells how
Richman heard Gregory speak
at Martin Luther King's funer
al. This is touchy material, and
it's performed with a near
gospel feel. Surrounded as it
was by all sorts of light, inconse

quential songs, it made one won
der not only what Richman was
trying to say, but if. indeed, he
was trying to say anything at
all He gave no clue.
That's the mystery of
Jonathan Richman. Does he feel

he sings well? Are there hidden
meanings in songs like "Dick
Gregory"? When he's home
alone at night, does he listen to
Elvis Costello or Perry Como? I
can't tell. All I know is that he
puts on a tun show. Go see him.

Jonathan Richman, the bard of the tone deaf
There really isn't any easy
way to explain Jonathan Rich
man and the Modern Lovers.
He's not really a "rock star," he
isn't a stand-up comedian, and
he definitely isn't anything in
the ordinary. Saturday night at
the Old Waldorf he was show
cased in all his glory, but the
show didn't help any in deciding
what he's about.
Perhaps the best way to in
troduce Jonathan Richman is by
description. In a world of music

that holds a range from Frank

Richman remains on a branch
