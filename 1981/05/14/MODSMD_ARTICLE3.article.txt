# Students 'saddened' by prospect of losing votes
## 
### David Frank 
Stanford medical students appear
to oppose any change in their partici
pation in the admissions process.
Some fear that changes in admissions
are just part of other policy changes
that demonstrate faculty insensitivi
ty toward the students. The Daily
presents the opinions of five students.
First-year student Stephen Thomas
said that one of the things that makes
Stanford Medical School attractive is
that student input in admissions
counts.
"The process where students vote
on admissions and serve on ad
missions panels allows a greater con
tinuity among the student body from
class to class than if the faculty picked
the students exclusively,"he said.
Take away uniqueness
"To change that process would be to
take away one of Stanford's unique
qualities," Thomas explained.
Further, Thomas said changes in
student admissions participation
would alienate students. "To remove
students from voting would be to make
a statement that students are not a
part of the University as they were
before," he said.
Bruce Black, third-year student,
went further and said the end of stu
dent voting participation would affect
the quality of the school.
"The school would sink into obli
vion," Black said. "The thing that
keeps this school an exciting place is
the quality of the students and that
they have remained active in main
taining the quality of the school," he
added.
Admissions, honors changes linked
Other students saw the change in
admissions policy as tied to other poli
cy changes, such as the attempted re
institution of the honors system with
the first-year class entering last
autumn.
The new honors system was to have
rewarded a select few students based
on their class performance, research
projects and community work, ac

cording to first-year student Karen
Urbani, who led a successful petition
drive to overturn honors for her class.
Although the Med School's pass/no
credit grading would have been re
tained had honors been kept, Urbani
said the class was "overwhelmingly
opposed" to honors. Many students
said they telt it would bring back a
high-pressure, "pre-med" at
mosphere, she said.
Parental attitude
Curtailing student participation in
admissions would send "another sig
nal" to students, Urbani said. "That
signal relays a parental attitude on the
faculty's part — of them making value
judgements on what is best done with
our spare time."
That students participate willingly
in admissions work is evidence, she
said, that students "know that ad
missions work isn't taking too much
time."
"Saving time isn't a compelling
argument in and of itself," said Fran
cine Hanberg, a third-year student.
"Logically there must be another rea
son," she added.
In response to the argument given
by Director of Admissions Laurence
Kedes that students exercise too much
control over the selection of student
admissions staff (see accompanying
article), Hanberg said the director
should have more input.
"But certainly there's always the
problem of conflict of interest. The di
rector has certain ideas, and there is
the possibility of him selecting stu
dents whose ideas are very much like
his."
• ' Lack of trust
"Student's really care about the-ad
mission of other students," said Jon
Zweig, a second-year student. He
noted the medical school's "philoso
phy" of training students for leader
ship positions.
"Yet they (the faculty) appear as if
they are not willing to trust us leader
ship positions in admissions. That
makes me sad."
