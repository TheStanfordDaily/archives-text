Habib resumes Lebanon meetings
Beirut, Lebanon — American presidential envoy Philip
Habib returned to Lebanon yesterday on his marathon
peacemakingtnission as tresh reports from two sections
of the wartorn country indicated that the Syrian army was
strengthening its defenses in preparation for a possible
war with Israel.
Habib met for several hours with President Elias Sarkis
of Lebanon, but refused to speak to reporters when he left
the presidential palace at Babda, the hilltop retreat that
overlooks the dividing line separating Christian and
Molsem sections of Beirut,
Despite the seeming uncertainty ot the close-mouthed
diplomacy devised by the Reagan administration, an air oi
optimism continued to prevail here
The only serious battle action of the day was reported
from the ridge line ot Mount Sinnin. overlooking the Chris
tian enclave of Zahlah, where Syrian artillery shelled
Christian Falangist positions. No heavy damage was re
ported. Syrian troops have occupied most of the ridge line
since early April, when the Falange militia attempted to
turn Zahlah, a predominantly Catholic city, into an anti-
Syrian military stronghold and exercise strategic control
over the Beirut-Damascus highway and large parts of the
vital Bekaa Valley.
Riots continue in Belfast
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Belfast police lit a iuse on
anger in this riot-torn city yesterday by effectively scuttl
ing a procession through Catholic West Belfast intended to
honor hunger striker Francis Hughes.
Belfast police, in a prepared statement-, said that Chief
Constable Kenneth McClain ordered the escort out of town
because he believed that the Irish Republican Army
wanted to make a spectacle of the procession.
It was clear, though, that the Catholic community be
lieved that the police action was an insulting show of force.
An angry rumbling swept through the crowd, and it grew
louder several minutes later with the announcement that
the march had been called off.
Car hijackings, part of the daily ritual here in Belfast,
began almost immediately. Half an hour after the march
was called off, a gang of teen-agers hijacked a large truck
about a mile from the church, moved it across theroad and
set it on fire.
U.S. Customs angers Soviets
Washington — In what appears to be an embarassing
mistake, U.S. Customs agents boarded a Soviet airliner
Tuesday, seized some common electronic equipment they
believed to be defense related and created an interhational
incident.
The Soviet government accused the agents of using
brute force and filed an official protest contending that
"terror and banditism have been elevated in the United
States to the status of official policy." U.S. officials de
fended the legality and conduct of the search and seizure,
but were hard-pressed to explain the basis for the sudden
action or who authorized it.
Seized were eight dosimeters for measuring radiation,
spare parts for chemical control apparatus at a fertilizer
factory and some aircraft navigation equipment being
modified by the Norden Systems Co., claims Valentin
Kamenev, press counselor for the Soviet embassy. None of
these items appeared to be defense related.
Aeroflot planes have been the focus of other incidents in
recent years. Early last year, baggage handlers refused to
load Aeroflot flights in New York to protest the Soviet in

vasion of Afghanistan In 1979, U S authorities detained an
Aeroflot plane in New York until they were satisfied the
wile of a defecting Soviet ballet star wasn't being forcibly
returned to Moscow

ing postponing an 11.2 percent cost-of-living increase due
in July for 36 million Social Security recipients as a cost

$10) and move nearly $4 billion in federal spending from
the 1981 budget to the 1982 budget, which starts Oct. 1.
One knowledgeable administration source, asking that
he not be identified, said postponing the upcoming 1981 in
crease is one of several items Budget Director David
Stockman is considering as a way to offset an unan
ticipated increase in the projected budget deficit tor the
current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
The source emphasized that a final decision has not been
made by President Ronald Reagan, who would have to
submit the proposal to Congress for its approval.

peacemakingtnission as tresh reports from two sections
of the wartorn country indicated that the Syrian army was
strengthening its defenses in preparation for a possible

the presidential palace at Babda, the hilltop retreat that
overlooks the dividing line separating Christian and
Molsem sections of Beirut,
Despite the seeming uncertainty ot the close-mouthed
diplomacy devised by the Reagan administration, an air oi
optimism continued to prevail here

tian enclave of Zahlah, where Syrian artillery shelled
Christian Falangist positions. No heavy damage was re

Riots continue in Belfast
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Belfast police lit a iuse on
anger in this riot-torn city yesterday by effectively scuttl
ing a procession through Catholic West Belfast intended to
honor hunger striker Francis Hughes.
Belfast police, in a prepared statement-, said that Chief
Constable Kenneth McClain ordered the escort out of town
because he believed that the Irish Republican Army
wanted to make a spectacle of the procession.
It was clear, though, that the Catholic community be
lieved that the police action was an insulting show of force.
An angry rumbling swept through the crowd, and it grew
louder several minutes later with the announcement that
the march had been called off.
Car hijackings, part of the daily ritual here in Belfast,
began almost immediately. Half an hour after the march
was called off, a gang of teen-agers hijacked a large truck
about a mile from the church, moved it across theroad and
set it on fire.
U.S. Customs angers Soviets
Washington — In what appears to be an embarassing
mistake, U.S. Customs agents boarded a Soviet airliner
Tuesday, seized some common electronic equipment they
believed to be defense related and created an interhational
incident.
The Soviet government accused the agents of using
brute force and filed an official protest contending that
"terror and banditism have been elevated in the United
States to the status of official policy." U.S. officials de
fended the legality and conduct of the search and seizure,
but were hard-pressed to explain the basis for the sudden
action or who authorized it.
Seized were eight dosimeters for measuring radiation,
spare parts for chemical control apparatus at a fertilizer
factory and some aircraft navigation equipment being
modified by the Norden Systems Co., claims Valentin
Kamenev, press counselor for the Soviet embassy. None of
these items appeared to be defense related.
Aeroflot planes have been the focus of other incidents in
recent years. Early last year, baggage handlers refused to
load Aeroflot flights in New York to protest the Soviet in

vasion of Afghanistan In 1979, U S authorities detained an
Aeroflot plane in New York until they were satisfied the
wile of a defecting Soviet ballet star wasn't being forcibly
returned to Moscow
