Residents ot a local bamboo-grow
ing site confronted three Delta Up
silon i DU) pledges in the yard of their
Palo Alto home last week, but did not
press charges because there was no
concrete evidence of any crime.
According to resident Michael
McDiarmit. the pledges had a saw but
no bamboo in their possession.
McDiarmit said he and his house
mates were on the alert after two
bamboo stalks were removed the pre
vious night.'
• The next night we figured they
might come back," he said. "Two peo
ple ran outside and caught them."
Members of his house then called the
police.
According to DU president Wolf
Puckett, the pledges proposed to make
mugs out of the bamboo for the bid
party luau last weekend.
The tradition of stealing bamboo is
not new — five bamboo stalks were cut
down last year. At that time, four Zeta
Psi members were arrested and two
of them were prosecuted.
According to Assistant Director of
the Row Michael Jackson, the matter
has been referred to the Inter-

Fraternity Council (IFC) Judiciary
Committee tor investiagation and rec
ommendation Jackson said that
fraternity self-government is "the
most reasonable approach."
Since the pledges were not caught
with bamboo in their possession, they
will be treated merely as if they had
exhibited bad behavior, said Jackson.
"The University looks at it with the
Fundamental Standard in mind." he
said The Fundamental Standard is
the code of ethics by which the Univer
sity governs student activities.
Jackson said he investigated* the
identity of the pledges "through talk
ing to people who are not DUs." Jack
son said the pledges'had identified
themselves, but he refused to disclose
their names.
The five-member IFC committee
will meet next week to discuss the DU
issue, said IFC President Richard
David. "We probably will take some
sort of action," he said.
Puckett said the DU house has not
levied any "firm punishment" against
the pledges. This is partly because the
pledges do not live in the house yet, he
said.
"Those pledges were told specifi-

cally not to do what they have done."
he emphasized. He added that the
pledges would probably not be treated
"too harshly."
Puckett said that the police
"jumped to a lot of conclusions "
"The argument is clouded." he
said. "All the facts are a little bit thin
now."
He said. "It's sort ot like a fraterni
ty just can't do right." He stressed
that campus sensitivity has increased.
Many rush activities, for example, are
no longer viewed as "all in good tun,"
he said.
Proposed changes
Jackson said the fraternities should
respect the rights ot others in the com
munity. "If they want to have the
fraternities, then they have to .con
form to the same standards as ev
eryone else," Jackson said.
According to McDiarmit, Univer
sity fraternity members in the past
four years have cut down six to eight
of the 30-foot tall stalks. The stalks
take about 30 years to grow to that
height, he said.
McDiarmit estimated that each
stalk is worth "hundreds ot dollars."
