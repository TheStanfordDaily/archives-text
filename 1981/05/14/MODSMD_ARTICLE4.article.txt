# Grads ask for $1.8M stipend boost
## 
### 
A $1.8 million increase in stipends
for graduate students in humanities
and social sciences is needed to meet
their living costs as calculated by the
University, the Social Sciences Grad
uate Students Association (SSGSA)
and the Stanford Fellows Association
(SFA) stated in a position paper last
week.
The money, according to SSGSA
leader !â€¢ rank Dobbin, isn't just "float
ing around, but I think the adminis
tration has the choice to allocate funds
where it wants ... it sounds like a lot
< ot money > but 1 percent ot the budget
doesn't sound like so much."
But Dean of Graduate Students
Gerald Lieberman said "$lB million,
and that's their figure, is a lot of mon

ey. I don't see where, easily, the Uni
versity will come up with this money
at this time.''
The position paper, distributed May
8 to members ot the Faculty Senate
Committee on Graduate Studies, is
the groups' "next step" in a continu
ing dialogue with the University ad
ministration about graduate stipends,
according to Michael Sperberg-
McQueen, SFA chairman. The two
groups were formed several months
ago and since have informing gradu
ate students through meetings of the
nature of the funding problem.
The paper presents no new solution
to the problem, according to Sperberg-
McQueen, but it puts together a
strong and forceful summary of what

we think of as the most persuasive
arguments (tor increased stipends)."
In real terms, support of graduate
students has declined in recent years
because the University's cost of living
increases have not kept up with infla
tion. Next year, however, a 16.8 per
cent increase in stipends under the De
partment Fellows Plan is expected to
top the national inflation rate, al
though sociology graduate student
Larry Wu, an author of the paper, said
that raised rent may erode the in
crease tor some students
GSA and SFA have warned that if
the real level of graduate support con
tinues to decline, the University will
lose qualified students to industry or
to other schools.
