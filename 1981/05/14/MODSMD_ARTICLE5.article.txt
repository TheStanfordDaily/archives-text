### Pat Carroll Eric Cornell 
Angry residents of Escondido Vil
lage met with representatives from
the Stanford Housing Office last night
to discuss the planned conversion of 54
family apartments to single student
housing.
The meeting was called by Escon
dido Village Housing Director Jan
Marx and Director of the Housing Cen
ter Roger Whitney atter 46 of the 54
families signed a petition protesting
the conversion.
The petitioners claimed that the the

University did not solicit input from
Escondido residents during the de
cision-making process and that they
learned of the University's decision to
concentrate singles in the sector near
the Housing Office (Increment IV)
only when it was announced in the Vil
lage Express, the Escondido Village
newsletter.
Escondido resident Ben Luft called
the policy making process
"haphazard." "One day in the Village
Express someone reads that singles
will be moving into 60 units of Incre

ment IV, saying essentially 'Take it or
leave it'," Luft said. "If everyone
used the Village Express for what it is
usually used for only the fishmonger
would have known about it."
Marx denied, however, that the
housing office did not seek community
input when the University was de
veloping its policy. She said that pos
sible redesignation was publicized
before the decision was made and that
the March 4 open meeting of the
Escondido Village Council was
was attended by about 30 village residents who partici
pated in the discussion ot the redesignation.
"It is very important that people realize that these fami
lies are not losing their apartments and singles are not los
ing spaces," Marx said. "Singles will be losing three
bedroom apartments and families are losing two
bedroom apartments. We are changing the ratio of two and
three-bedroom apartments to reach the goal in which half
of Escondido Village residents will have three-bedroom
apartments."
The plan calls for singles to be moved into that section of
the Village as families move out and was based on prob
lems in housing arising from two areas:
—Single students are significantly underrepresented in
on-campus housing (68 percent of all graduate students
are single, but only 24 percent of all singles are housed on
campus.)
The 46 people who signed the petition argued that single
students would be disruptive to the familial environment
of Increment IV. In their petition they said that Increment
IV is "the most ideal courtyard in the Village for children,
that "it is well organized and the residents share social ac
tivities and have a baby-sitting co-op with 20 active mem
bers."
