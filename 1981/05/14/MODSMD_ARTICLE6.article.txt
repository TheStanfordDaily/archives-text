# Loan cuts may cost Stanford $2M
## 
### Richard Klingler 
President Donald Kennedy discussed potentially grave
effects of federal budget cuts upon the University at last
night's ASSU Senate meeting — the last official meeting of
the 1980-81 Senate.
Kennedy focused upon possible changes forthcoming
budget cuts might bring to the financial aid program, but
he emphasized that it is "important to note that not ev
erything is decided."
Effects of budget changes may be great, however. Ken
nedy said "in the financial aid area, the institution will be
obliged to put 2 to 3 million dollars from general funds to
replace" lost federal funding if predicted budget cuts occ
cur.
Noting that "the political force behind this budget is
almost unstoppable," Kennedy said budget cuts will pri
marily affect students who are neither extremely poor nor
extremely wealthy — particularly students receiving
loans through the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) pro
gram. GSL loans are federally financed low-interest loans
whose interest the government currently pays while the
recipient attends school.
Kennedy said the GSL program is "under a broad and
more general threat" that might result in its abolishment,
but he said that more limited changes will probably be
placed upon the program. He said possible moditications
include limiting loans to students who demonstrate need
and eliminating government interest payment while the
loan recipient attends school.
More than 4700 Stanford students receive $13. million of
loans through the GSL program, according to Kennedy He
estimated that 30 percent of the GSL money Stanford stu
dents receive is through "convenience loans" — loans ob
tained without demonstrated financial need — that would
be eliminated if proposed budget changes pass
If the GSL program is completely eliminated, the Uni
versity would probably not be able to replace all cut gov
ernment funding, even though Stanford is committed to
meeting each student's financial need, according to Ken

nedy. "I do not believe we could make all that loss good,"
he said.
Kennedy said he thought the Pell Grant program < for
merly Basic Education Grants) — which aid the most
needy students — will be modified to require stricter qual
ifications and greater student contributions. He estimated
that budget changes in this program alone will force the
University to replace "directly by general tunds" $350,000
to $400,00) of lost government aid. GSL changes will not
force the University to divert general funds unless budget
cuts increase students' demonstrated need, he said
Kennedy said that the National Direct Student Loan
Program (NDSL), "which was feared to be lost, apparent
ly will not be lost." He also said. "Last time I looked, there
were no plans to cut work-study," a government program
that helps finance student employment.
Graduate student financial aid programs will be very
restricted by possible budget cuts in addition to funding
cuts in GSL aid to graduates, Kennedy said He singled out
the National Science Foundation fellowships as one source
of funds that is particularly threatened and estimated that
"most ot the NSF fellowships will be lost it the I Reagan >
Administration gets its way."
Kennedy said Stanford's top priorities in its lobbying ef
forts are saving the NSF fellowship program and ensuring
continued government payment of interest on GSL loans
while the recipient attends school
The University is pursuing all known possibilities of
private sector funding, according to Kennedy, but he said
that fund solicitation does not offer immediate relief to op
erating budget restraints because many contributions are
restricted to specific uses by the donors, dedicated toward
long-term projects, or earmarked to increase the endow
ment He said that for this year's fund solicitation, "suc
cess has been good" and the final sum "will top last year's
total — probably by quite a lot."
