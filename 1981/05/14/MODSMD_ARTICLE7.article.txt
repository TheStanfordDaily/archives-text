## Nicaragua makes up U.S. aid loss 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Nicaragua has
obtained a substantial increase
in international assistance, in
cluding a $100 million loan from
Libya, a large-scale expansion
in Mexico's aid program and So
viet wheat shipments, since a
U.S. decision early this year to
suspend aid to the leftist revolu
tionary government.
The Libyan deal, a balance ot
payments loan on what were de
scribed by Nicaraguan officials
as extremely favorable terms,
marks a significant expansion
of the radical Arab state's here
tofore limited activity in Latin
America. Libya previously had
granted considerably smaller
amounts of aid to politically di
verse countries in Africa and
Asia.
Nicaraguan officials said that
their government had made no
political concessions in ex
change for the loan from the
government of Col. Moammar
Khadaty, which the Reagan ad
ministration has accused of pro
moting international terrorism.
"We don't think we should be
ashamed of it,"* Nicaraguan
Ambassador to the United
States Arturo Cruz said.
The Libyan loan, Cruz said,
will help soften the blow of what
he called the
sword" of an estimated $300
million balance of payments
deficit the government expects
this year.
The Reagan administration
has accused Nicaragua of aiding
guerrillas, which it also de
scribes as terrorists, trying to
overthrow the U.S.-backed jun
ta in nearby El Salvador. That
charge, which the adminis
tration has backed up with what
it has said are captured guer
rilla documents outlining

Nicaraguan assistance, was the
justification, under U.S. law.
for the suspension of aid to
Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment.
Although the approximately
$15 million that the United
States is withholding — the re
mainder ot a $75 million ap
propriation made last year — is
relatively insignificant in terms
ot Nicaragua's economic
health, Nicaraguan oKicials
fear the suspension will affect
"our relations with Wall Street,
London and the international
business community."
The funds initially were
frozen in January, when the ad
ministration said it suspected
that Nicaragua had facilitated
the shipment of weapons to
Salvadoran guerrillas. U.S. of
ficials since have said that the
alleged arms flow through
Nicaragua, the existence ot
which the Sandinistas publicly
have denied, has largely ceased.
But the aid program has not
been restarted, and a per
manent suspension was an
nounced last month, although
disbursement of funds for a
number of development pro
grams has continued without
halt.
There is little indication that
other international donors to
Nicaragua have followed Wash
ington's lead, however. In addi
tion to the Libyan loan, which
was signed by a Nicaraguan del
egation in Tripoli on April 2. the
day of the U.S. announcement,
Mexico has substantially
boosted its assistance.
During a state visit to Mexico
last week by Sandinista leader
Daniel Saavedra, President
Jose Lopez Portillo, in an ob
vious reference to his own dis
approval of the U.S. aid cutoff

said that "we will always be at
(Nicaragua's) side." During-
Ortega's trip. Mexican officials
signed agreements increasing
their economic and technical as
sistance to a total estimated at
$200 million over the next two
years.
In what both Nicaraguan and
U.S. officials described as "tak
ing advantage of an opportuni
ty," the Soviet Union last month
announced it would send
Nicaragua 20.000 tons of wheat,
worth about $4 million and
enough to till its needs tor sever
al months to make up for the
U.S. cutoff of at least $7 million
in wheat shipments.
Since then, most aid to
Nicaragua has come from
Western Europe. Scandanavia,
Latin America, the Inter-Amer

ican Development Bank and the
United States. The last two by
far have been the largest
donors, with a total ot approx
imately $160 million each, with
the bulk of lADB tunds coming
from the United States
Nicaragua's internal finan
cial picture remains bleak Poor
weather conditions leading to
poor harvests, what Cruz de
scribed as continuing "revolu
tionary trauma" that has im
peded private local investment
by businessmen who mistrust
the government's intentions,
and increased imports — the re
sult both of poor internal pro
duction and a rising standard of
living for the lower economic
class — have caused high infla
tion and a severe cash-flow
problem.
