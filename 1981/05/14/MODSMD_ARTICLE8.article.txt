# NATO told 'grim buildup' story

### Los Angeles Times 
Brussels, Belgium — The United States gave
NATO defense ministers a "grim story" here
Tuesday of the buildup ot Soviet conventional
arms that has created "unprecedented danger tor
the next decade." senior U.S. officials said.
The presentation made a "deep and profound
impact" upon the representatives of the other "4
countries, who then reaffirmed a prior committ
ment to a 3 percent growth in annual defense
budget, and perhaps more, according to the U.S.
officials.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger,
following the U.S. intelligence discription of the
Soviet threat to the ministers, warned that "cur
rent and prospective leaders of the Soviet Union
may be impelled by lack of success in other fields
to turn increasingly to the one field in which they
have most confidence and capability: stark mili
tary power and military threats."
The background briefing by American officials
seemed likely to set off alarms throughout Eu
rope. where the U.S. characterization ot the Sovi
et threat, if not the details, will be examined skep
tically.
Three weeks ago, Weinberger presented evi
dence of the Soviet buildup of medium-range nu
clear missiles targeted at Europe.
The complementary presentation on non-nucle
ar forces Tuesday covered "new and similarly in

tensive Soviet efforts to improve and expand con
ventional military forces," the officials said
Four specific points were emphasized:
—Soviet ground forces are ready for "extensive
combat" in the central region of Europe.
—More than 1000 fighter aircraft have been pro
duced every year by the Soviets for the past eight
years.
—The Soviet navy's continued growth will per
mit sustained operations in areas tar from the So
viet Union.
—There is an "extensive and growing industrial
production base" tor weapons in the Soviet Union
for both Soviet use and export to client states, the
officials said, calling Moscow the world's chief
arms exporter.
German officials reportedly had somewhat
heated exchanges with Weinberger in private ses
sions during the day. Because Germany's spend
ing rose more than 3 per cent last year, they
argued, it should not be criticized tor an increase
of only 2.8 percent this year.
The U.S. officials, while not denying dif
ferences of opinion, said that the ministers in the
end actually went beyond reaffirming the 3 per
cent annual increase in future defense spending.
In comparison, Soviet spending on defense con
tinues to rise at 4 percent per year as it has each
yearl since 1970, according to to the report of
NATO's Military committee released Tuesday.
