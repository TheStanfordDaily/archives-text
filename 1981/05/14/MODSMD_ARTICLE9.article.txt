Paris — A cornerstone ot
President-elect Francois Mit
terrand's Socialist program in
volves nationalization ot private
French banks and 10 major in
dustrial combines employing
more than 1 million workers
But such a sweeping program
ot nationalization can only be
accomplished with a leftist ma
jority in the National Assembly,
and Mitterrand and the Social
ists are a long way from achiev
ing that goal.
The new president is expected
to dissolve the assembly and
call for another round of elec
tions in late June. At present,
the right-wing Gaullists and the
supporters ot President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing control the
legislature by nearly 100 seats.
The left's chances of overturn
ing such a large majority are
not considered to be strong.
Extremist check
Political observers believe
that French voters, having
made their dramatic choice of a
Socialist president, will now

saddle him with a conservative
legislature as a check against
any extremist policies or pro
grams. Until the legislative
elections are held, it is im
possible to assess just how lef
tist Mitterrand's new govern
ment will be. but it is considered
unlikely that the Socialists will
be able to carry out anything
near their full nationalization
program.
Mitterrand and his sup
porters want to bring the steel
industry, the arms industry,
much of the chemical industry
and the big electrical equipment
and computer companies under
full state control. No foreign
owned companies are targeted
for nationalization, and the new
government is expected to take
steps to reassure foreign in
vestors that it does not want to
scare away outside capital.
The only U.S. business in
terests that might be affected
by the nationalization program
— if it ever gets that far —
would be companies that have
minority holdings in French in
dustries. Two of those are CII-
Honey well-Bull and ITT-
France. both of which are in the
computer and electronics busi
ness. In both cases, under
Giscard d'Estaing, the Ameri
can dominance of the two com
panies was reduced to minority
participation in the iast decade.
Minneapolis-based Honeywell
took over French Machines Bull
in the early 19705, but the
French then forced through a
merger, with its own^ govern
ment-subsidized computer com
pany CH. reducing the Ameri
can participation.
Similarly in the late 19705,
ITT was required to merge with
a French manufacturer of com
munications equipment and re
duced to second place. The proc
ess was called "Frenchifica
tion," rather than nationaliza
tion.
On the other hand, there is no
question of the new Socialist
government touching Ameri
can-owned IBM-France, which
is one of the nation's biggest em
ployers as well as biggest ex
porters.
Also left off the Socialists' list
as targets for nationalization

are Michelin. the big tire and
rubber combine, and the car
manutacturer Peugeot-Citroen-
Talbot. France's other automo
bile manufacturer. Renault,
was nationalized by Gen
Charles deGaulle immediately
after Paris was liberated from
German occupation in 1945.
In the post-war round of na
tionalization under de Gaulle,
the country's four biggest banks
also came under state control,
as did all public transportation,
utilities, the tobacco industry,
ports, harbors and waterways,
the airlines and part of the avia
tion industry. About 30 percent
of the economy now is under
direct state ownership or con
trol.
In addition to ITT-Franee and
CII-Honeywell-Bull, the other
companies on the Socialists' list
tor nationalization are:
—Avions Marcel Dessault-
Breguet, builders of the Mirage
jet tighter planes. It already is
one-third state-owned.
— Compagnie General
d'Electricite, manufacturers of
generators and heavy electrical
equipment.
— Pechiney-Ugine-
Kuhlmann, which manufac
turers chemicals and mines
aluminium and other metals.
—Rhone-Polenc, a manutac
turer of chemicals and pharma
ceuticals.
-Thomson-Brandt, manufac
turers of heavy electrical equip
ment. electronics, household
appliances and precision-guided
missiles.
—Matra, builders of tanks,
armored vehicles, artillery and
a range of other military equip
ment.
— Saint Gobain-Pont-a-
Mousson, a glass and chemicals
combine.
—Roussl-Uclaf, a pharma
ceutical combine.
Two steel companies, Unisor
and Sacilor, also are on the
target list for nationalization,
but both are already semi-na
tionalized through heavy state
loans and shareholdings.
