# Union contests clerical election
## 
### 
United Stanford Employees (USE)/Local 7 5 yesterday
filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board
<N ! LRB), challenging the results of last Thursday's
unionization election.
Although no one from the union would comment on the
exact grounds used to challenge the election outcome,
.Joyce Tipps-Coats, spokesperson for the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC), said they referred to some
specific "unfair labor practices" used by the University in
the campaign against the union.
Tipps-Coats said that USE had "a number of options" in
challenging the results, but said she would haVe no public
statements to make on the challenge until Monday. In the
election, clerical workers here voted 930-554 against hav
ing USE/Local 715 as their bargaining agent.
Bruce Friend, an NLRB spokesman, confirmed that a
challenge was filed, but said that no information from it
could be released because it is not a public document at
this time.
Priscilla Wheeler, labor consultant in the University

Counsel's otfice, said the NLRB told her Wednesday a
challenge was likely, but added she has yet to receive a
copy oi the actual document.
Wheeler said usually the challenge would be served to
both the NLRB and the University at the same time, but
since she had not seen a copy of the challenge, she could
not comment.
It is up to USE to provide the evidence to support its
claim that the University waged an unfair campaign,
Friend said Now that the challenge is before the NLRB,
the regional director has three choices.
On the basis of this proof, said Friend, the regional di
rector can make a recommendation to the national board
whether to accept the evidence and throw out the election,
to move the matter to a hearing so both sides can present
their arguments, or to dismiss the allegations and certify
the election.
The report filed by the regional office is only a recom
mendation. and the ultimate decision will be made by the
national office in Washington.
