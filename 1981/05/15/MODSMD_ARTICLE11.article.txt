Nadel, a member of Musicians Union
Local 6 in San Francisco, is responsible
for having secured funds for Stanford's
jazz festival, as well as helping to coordi
nate activities surrounding it.
The music for "Joy Spring Jazz'' is
funded in whole or in part by U.S. rec
ording companies as arranged for by the
Music Performance Trust Fund < MPTF >
and The National Association of Jazz
Educators (NAJE). Record companies
established the fund in an effort to ensure
the continuance ot live musical per
formances in American communities at
a time when it seemed that recorded mu
sic would overshadow in-person attrac
tions.
Nadel explained that the name "Joy
Spring Jazz" was derived from a classic
selection by the late, great trumpeteer
Clifford Brown called "Joy Spring."
"The whole idea of this event is a cele
bration ot jazz in the community," Nadel
said. " 'Joy Spring Jazz" seemed [ike a
very appropriate title."
In addition to the program slated for
the afternoon, the Stanford Jazz Band
will perform at the Coffee House at 7:30
this evening in a grand finale to the
STARTS jazz extravaganza.
Nadel said that Tresidder Memorial
Union is an ideal place tor an event of
this kind at Stanford. "On a campus
where there is so much going on its hard
to persuade people to come out tor an
event, so we decided that we would take
the event to where the people are," he
said.
