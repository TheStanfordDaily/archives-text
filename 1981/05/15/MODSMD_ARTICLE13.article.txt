## Black culture a response racism

Millions of Africans lost their
lives during the passage from
Africa to the Americas aboard
slaveships. Millions of Africans
have lost their lives fighting
against European and United
States colonialism and op
pression on the continent.
Thousands of Africans lost their
lives rebelling against slavery
before the Civil War. Thousands
of African Americans lost their
lives in the turn of the century
through lynchings, house burn
ings, and other violence
directed at the so-called
'freedmen.' Hundreds of
African Americans lost their
lives as front-line fodder during
the Vietnam War and as victims
of the FBI COINTELPRO
(counterintelligence program)
against black organizations dur
ing the '60s. not to mention the
murder of Malcolm. King.
George Jackson, and other
black leaders
Africans and African Ameri
cans continue to lose their lives
as a result of violence aimed at
the black community.
When white terrorists bomb a
black church and kill five black
children, this is an act of indi
vidual racist violence.
But when in the same city.
Birmingham. Alabama. 500
black babies die each year be
cause of a lack of proper food.

shelter, and medical facilities
and thousands more are de
stroyed and maimed — physi
cally, emotionally, and mental
ly — because of conditions of
poverty and discrimination
toward the black community,
this is a function of institutional
racism and violence. The pro
posed Reagan budget cuts are
particularly aimed at poor peo
ple throughout the country, and
will have particular impact in
black children (cuts in health
care housing, lunch programs,
etc.).
Our people are killed daily in
Angola, Namibia, and South
Africa not only by bombings and
raids by the U.S.-supported
white South African army, but
by the racist apartheid system
itself, which causes high rates
of black infant mortality, pover
ty. disease, and famine among
the masses of people in southern
Africa. Stanford uses our money
(gotten by charging excessive
amounts in tuition) to invest in
U.S. companies operating in
South Africa. These companies
are taking advantage of cheap
labor and high profits at the ex
pense of black Africans slaving
in the mines; who are not recog
nized as citizens of their own
country; who are paid so little
that their children starve.
The violence directed against

the older black men in Buffalo,
who were brutally killed, their
hearts cut out, the violence
directed against the children in
Atlanta . . . this is physical vio
lence.
However, other methods of
violence are directed at us in an
attempt to destroy us. There is
also the cultural and mental vio
lence that we suffer. The weap
ons range from movies and TV
— which present images of
blacks as clowns and buffoons,
images of Africans through
Tarzan as backward and
without cultural history and
beauty — to the education sys
tem itself which fosters a sense
among black people that they
have no history before coming
to American shores as slaves,
that the "Negro" magically ap
peared out of nowhere to settle
in America. And check out the
Western Civilization require
ment at Stanford, which is an af
front to anyone of Asian,
African or South American de
scent. But not only do they shove
their history down our throats,
they go further by presenting
distortions and lies.
Historically, we have suf
fered many forms and methods
of racist violence. Still, against
tremendous odds, black culture
has endured.
For the 3rd Annual Black ArtS

Festival, we have adopted the
Nguzo Saba (Seven Principles)
which were developed and pro
posed by M. Ron Karenga dur
ing the black cultural revolution
in the '60s as a necessary min
imum set ot principles by which
black people must live in order
to begin to rescue and re
construct our history, and cul
ture, and our lives.
The Black Arts Festival is not
designed to make us paralyzed
with fear but spur us to action.
We must draw upon our own
inner strength and collective
power. True courage of the
heart is the natural fruit of our
awareness of the presence of
this strength and power. We at
tain this liberating certainty
when, instead ot being misled,
hindered, and hunted by fear,
we move calmly, methodically,
but with a sense of urgency,
purpose, and familyhood to
grasp our sure support: our in
ner strength and collective
power.
We invite the entire Stanford
community to come out to the
Black Art/Crafts Faire and
Community Picnic on Saturday,
May 16, and celebrate Black cul
ture and "Self-Determination
Through Cultural Unity."
