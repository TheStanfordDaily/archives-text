## Paul Baer Grades: a letter to Aunt Sally 
### 
Dear Aunt Sally,
How are you? I'm fine. I'm
sorry I haven't written trom
September until May, but I've
been real busy. But seriously, I
decided that now would be a
good time to write; I have a
year's perspective on the place,
and can tell you what it's really
like to live here. Or at least how
it seems to me . .
College is all about learning,
right? And while certainly not
all learning is classroom learn
ing, that's one of the biggest
aspects. So let me tell you about
my classes.
I have kind of mixed feelings
about my classes here. By and
large I've had good teachers.
But I wonder, especially con
sidering what I've taken (most
ly math, physics, and philoso
phy), whether I couldn't have
had almost identical classes at
any decent university. Perhaps
the percentage of good teachers
is high here, but I don't know
how I could find out. And the
quality varies from department
to department as well.
One advantage of the private
university is supposed to be
smaller classes and more con
tact with the pfrofessors. Well,
my classes have varied from
about 30 to almost 200. And
while only philosophy has been
really large, still the only place
I've been krfbwn by name is in
my philosophy discussion sec
tion.
Now, talking to professors is
certainly possible. All of my
teachers have office hours. And
while the office hours may be
pretty few, they're usually not
very crowded either. But even if
it's not hard to talk to your prof,
it's often hard to find the
motivation to do so.
Motivation — that's a key
word. In fact both for me per
sonally and in general, I think
that motivation is one of the
crucial issues to life at Stanford.
Life at college is a different
experience trom lite in high
school. There is no one to
babysit you, to make sure you do
you homework, to make sure
you have an adequate social life,
to make sure you don't drink
yourselt to death. You don't
even have to go to class. No per

son will act upon you as parents
and others have done up till now.
But that is not to say that
there are no external forces.
Grades alone can be an exteme
ly large motivation, although
tor different people tor different
reasons. Some people are still
under pressure from their pa
rents; others are personally
committed to a particular end,
such as a graduate school. For
me it's not quite either of those.
I think I simply got used to mak
ing A's in high school; and now
as long as I'm capable of mak
ing A's, I feel obliged to do so. Of
course, that may not be the real
reason . . .
Unfortunately tor myself, and
I suspect for many others, mak
ing good grades substitutes for
having any real long term goals.
I see a real danger in this, for a
couple of reasons.
One is that when I do succeed
in making good grades, the only
satisfaction I get is a temporary
ego gratification — the pleasure
of knowing "I'm this good." Al
though I can't really say for
sure, I suspect that the satisfac
tion ot knowing "I'm this much
closer to my goal" would be
much more gratifying. For one
thing, it doesn't involve direct
comparison and competition
with others.
But the second major prob
lem is that, in the absence of any
long term goals, grades as a
motivation have caused me to
derail any search for long term
goals. Let me see it I can explain
this a little better.
I came here not really know
ing what I wanted as a major or
as a career. I said I would pre
tend for a year that I was a phys
ics major, since that was one of
the possibilities I was (and I
guess still am) favoring the
most. Well, pretending I was a
physics major has meant taking
lots of math and physics. And
since I'm taking these classes, I
want to do well in them. Thus
my real goal, which was to find
out if I want to be a physics ma
jor, has been submerged to just
trying to make good grades. I
haven't spent much time talking
to people in the field, or in other
fields, to help me find out what I
really want to do.

So, a year later, I still don't
know if I want to be a physics
major; I still have no long term
goals. See what I mean?
This all ties in with the issue
of how one spends one's time.
For anyone who is grade con
scious, schoolwork always has
to take precedence at a certain
point. Now. neither I nor most
people are just constantly
drowning in homework. But the
effect of schoolwork is much
greater than simply the time it
takes up.
For one thing, it means that
when I'm not doing schoolwork,
I don't want to do anything re
sembling schoolwork. It means
I don't read much, I don't go ex
amining other areas I might be
interested in, I don't follow up
on the things in my schoolwork
which do interest me, and so on.
And it means that if my classes
aren't teaching me much, I may
not be learning much at all.
Another aspect is how it
makes me treat non-studying
time in general. The prospect of
having a paper due can ruin a
great deal more time than just
the time spent writing it. For
one thing, it is difficult to enjoy
a lot of things when I have a pa
per hanging over my head. It
can get to be a real source of
anxiety. But another thing is
that, as the due date comes
near, I will no longer take time
to do the things I enjoy — going
to movies, visiting friends, and
so on. These things, since they
are fun, clearly should be put off
until later. However, I then find
myself doing things I don't real
ly enjoy in order to avoid work
ing on whatever's due — things
like reading all tour sections of
the newspaper, watching TV,
taking naps, or whatever. A
double loser.
Wow — I didn't realize I had
so much to write about. I
haven't even begun to talk about
the dorms, the other students,
and a bunch of other things. I
guess I'll have to try to write
again.
All my love, Paul.
