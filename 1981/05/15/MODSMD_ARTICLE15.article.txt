## Contemporary terrorists lack ideologies and realizable goals 
### 
Terrorism is as old as history.
It has troubled society in one
form or another since time
began. The version that men
aces today's world, however, is
fundamentally different than
the earlier forms. The political
nationalists that plagued most
oi western Europe in the nine
teenth century, for example,
had an abiding belief that a new
and free society could emerge
from the ashes of the existing
social order, once the latter was
put to the torch. They were both
ideological and nationalistic,
and their terrorism was
grounded in centuries of cul
tural and political oppression.
By contrast, contemporary
terrorists are not interested in
offering grand visions of a "bet
ter world.'' Few, if any, have re
alizable goals. Rootless and
reckless, they use violence to
call attention to their own fury
at the way things are: they avow
to destroy the structure of pres
ent society, without offering
workable replacements. But
unlike past anarchists, today's
version can use modern technol

ogy to unite in coordinated acts
of transnational violence.
Contemporary terrorism
transcends not only ideologies
and political or social goals but
national boundaries and oceans
as well. With every year that
passes it is becoming more the
manifestation of a single prob
lem — a surrogate warfare that
reflects a transnational web of
relationships that might be
called the "New Interna
tionale." This is a profound
break with the past when anar
chists were weak and divided by
impossible geographic and com
munication barriers.
A classic illustration of the
ongoing relationship among ter
rorist elements around the
globe is demonstrated by the
route followed by the three
Japanese United Red Army
(URA) gunmen who committed
murders at Tel Aviv's
Lod Airport in May 972. They
first flew to the United States
and Canada, then on to a Paris
base of operations maintained
by their comrades from the pop
ular Front tor the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP). Next they

went to Lebanon, for training at
a Palestinian Fedayeen camp.
Thus "qualified," they returned
to their comrades in Paris,
staying with them until receiv
ing false passports from docu
ment-counterfeiting sources in
Frankfurt. The next step in this
grim odyssey was a trip to
Rome, where Italian terrorists
supplied them with grenades
and automatic weapons made in
Czechoslavakia. These were
stored in a Rome apartment by
a German sympathizer until the
flight to Tel Aviv completed
their saga of horror.
Another aspect of the trans
national relationship is il
lustrated by the takeover of the
Saudi Arabian embassy in Khar
tous by eight Palestinians in
March 1973. Threatening to kill
their five hostages, they de
manded the release of killers
from around the world: the
Baader-Meinhof terrorists held
by West Germany, the Robert
Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan
held by the United States, Arab
guerrillas held by Israel, and
seventeen Palestinian ter
rorists imprisoned in Jordan.

Upon refusal by all govern
ments concerned, the Palesti
nians killed three WEstern
diplomats who were among the
hostages. Another instance of
multinational terrorism and co
operation was the June 1976 hi
jacking of the Air France jet to
Entebbe in Uganda. This
episode involved Palestinian,
German, African, and Ecua
dorian nationals in a major ex
cursion covering thousands of
miles and involving several
countries of the Middle East and
Africa.
A major "glue" joining the di
verse number of terrorist
groups and events around the
world is the Palestinian connec
tion. In many of the major ter
rorist incidents of the last eight
years, members of the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) have been increas
ingly involved. Continuous de
mands have been made to free
Arab terrorists wherever they
may be held. Other terrorists
groups look to the PLO for lead
ership and training. Arab and
Lebanese elements,
furthermore, have been identi

fied as conduits for the
purchase, donation, and
transfer of explosives and other
weaponry for international ter
rorist wings.
These small bands of dedi
cated fanatics provide a fright
ening demonstration of the
power that such groups can
wield against the liberal de
mocracies of the West. They
seek reversals of the systems of
authority that constitute the
framework of a civilized people.
They threaten the overthrow of
due process by demanding the
release of legally imprisoned
criminals, using the leverage of
seized power over helpless
hostages. They play on the fears
of public officials torn between
the desire to resist such de
mands to avid encouraging oth
er terrorists and the concern for
public outcry if hostages are
abused or murdered.
This transnational effort
seeks the degradation of the'
democratic commitment to hu
man freedom and government
by law. Fearful populaces are
often willing to buy security at
the price of individual rights

and liberties.
To combat today's terrorism,
we must recognize its trans
national character. We must
have the courage to pinpoint and
condemn publicly those nations,
groups, and movements that
provide covert support to ter
rorists, And we must be pre
pared to meet the costs — eco
nomic, social, and political — of
doing battle with the terrorists.
The magnitude of this novel
form of global "warfare" was
recently underscored by Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig. In
his first public remarks on U.S.
foreign policy, Haig pledged the
Reagan government to combat
international terrorism as a top

national priority. But in im
plementing this pledge, the gov
ernment must be careful not to
let the terrorist tear at the ru
diments of a democratic socie
ty: to exploit the legitimate and
inherent differences of opinion
and related tensions between
freedom and order. We cannot
ever afford to overcome the ter
rorist in such a way that he will
have lost the battle and won the
war.

ter world.'' Few, if any, have re
alizable goals. Rootless and
reckless, they use violence to
call attention to their own fury
at the way things are: they avow
to destroy the structure of pres
ent society, without offering
workable replacements. But
unlike past anarchists, today's
version can use modern technol

ogy to unite in coordinated acts
of transnational violence.
Contemporary terrorism
transcends not only ideologies
and political or social goals but
national boundaries and oceans
as well. With every year that
passes it is becoming more the
manifestation of a single prob
lem — a surrogate warfare that
reflects a transnational web of
relationships that might be
called the "New Interna
tionale." This is a profound
break with the past when anar
chists were weak and divided by
impossible geographic and com
munication barriers.
A classic illustration of the
ongoing relationship among ter
rorist elements around the
globe is demonstrated by the
route followed by the three
Japanese United Red Army
(URA) gunmen who committed
murders at Tel Aviv's
Lod Airport in May 972. They
first flew to the United States
and Canada, then on to a Paris
base of operations maintained
by their comrades from the pop
ular Front tor the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP). Next they

went to Lebanon, for training at
a Palestinian Fedayeen camp.
Thus "qualified," they returned
to their comrades in Paris,
staying with them until receiv
ing false passports from docu
ment-counterfeiting sources in
Frankfurt. The next step in this
grim odyssey was a trip to
Rome, where Italian terrorists
supplied them with grenades
and automatic weapons made in
Czechoslavakia. These were
stored in a Rome apartment by
a German sympathizer until the
flight to Tel Aviv completed
their saga of horror.
Another aspect of the trans
national relationship is il
lustrated by the takeover of the
Saudi Arabian embassy in Khar
tous by eight Palestinians in
March 1973. Threatening to kill
their five hostages, they de
manded the release of killers
from around the world: the
Baader-Meinhof terrorists held
by West Germany, the Robert
Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan
held by the United States, Arab
guerrillas held by Israel, and
seventeen Palestinian ter
rorists imprisoned in Jordan.

Upon refusal by all govern
ments concerned, the Palesti
nians killed three WEstern
diplomats who were among the
hostages. Another instance of
multinational terrorism and co
operation was the June 1976 hi
jacking of the Air France jet to
Entebbe in Uganda. This
episode involved Palestinian,
German, African, and Ecua
dorian nationals in a major ex
cursion covering thousands of
miles and involving several
countries of the Middle East and
Africa.
A major "glue" joining the di
verse number of terrorist
groups and events around the
world is the Palestinian connec
tion. In many of the major ter
rorist incidents of the last eight
years, members of the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) have been increas
ingly involved. Continuous de
mands have been made to free
Arab terrorists wherever they
may be held. Other terrorists
groups look to the PLO for lead
ership and training. Arab and
Lebanese elements,
furthermore, have been identi

fied as conduits for the
purchase, donation, and
transfer of explosives and other
weaponry for international ter
rorist wings.
These small bands of dedi
cated fanatics provide a fright
ening demonstration of the
power that such groups can
wield against the liberal de
mocracies of the West. They
seek reversals of the systems of
authority that constitute the
framework of a civilized people.
They threaten the overthrow of
due process by demanding the
release of legally imprisoned
criminals, using the leverage of
seized power over helpless
hostages. They play on the fears
of public officials torn between
the desire to resist such de
mands to avid encouraging oth
er terrorists and the concern for
public outcry if hostages are
abused or murdered.
This transnational effort
seeks the degradation of the'
democratic commitment to hu
man freedom and government
by law. Fearful populaces are
often willing to buy security at
the price of individual rights

and liberties.
To combat today's terrorism,
we must recognize its trans
national character. We must
have the courage to pinpoint and
condemn publicly those nations,
groups, and movements that
provide covert support to ter
rorists, And we must be pre
pared to meet the costs — eco
nomic, social, and political — of
doing battle with the terrorists.
The magnitude of this novel
form of global "warfare" was
recently underscored by Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig. In
his first public remarks on U.S.
foreign policy, Haig pledged the
Reagan government to combat
international terrorism as a top

national priority. But in im
plementing this pledge, the gov
ernment must be careful not to
let the terrorist tear at the ru
diments of a democratic socie
ty: to exploit the legitimate and
inherent differences of opinion
and related tensions between
freedom and order. We cannot
ever afford to overcome the ter
rorist in such a way that he will
have lost the battle and won the
war.

Terrorism is as old as history.
It has troubled society in one
form or another since time
began. The version that men
aces today's world, however, is
fundamentally different than
the earlier forms. The political
nationalists that plagued most
oi western Europe in the nine
teenth century, for example,
had an abiding belief that a new
and free society could emerge
from the ashes of the existing
social order, once the latter was
put to the torch. They were both
ideological and nationalistic,
and their terrorism was
grounded in centuries of cul
tural and political oppression.
