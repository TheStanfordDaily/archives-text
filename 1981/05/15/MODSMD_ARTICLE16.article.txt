## Not a weapon, but an assertion of dignity 
### 
I have a new escort these
days. A companion of sorts. I
am cautiously reassured by its
presence yet feel incredibly
hostile that I am compelled to
invite its company.
My escort is a can of mace.
What provoked the $27 check,
two hours of certification train
ing and a difficult choice to
carry a non-lethal weapon like
any other accessory for an eve
ning out?
Fear and reality.
I am afraid not to be pre
pared. Even if the can is only a
placebo reminding me of poten
tial danger — that is a start. My
acknowledgement of possible
attack is sharpened with this
ammunition.
It is my personal decision to
arm myself, in order to respond
to any person who may trespass

me that is significant. Not the
mace itselt. The assertion that
my person is worth defending is
far more powerful a weapon
than the tearing eyes, burning
throat and nausea the gas in
duces.
I am not falsely assured of
greater strength, agility or luck
with this tube clipped to a belt
buckle.
Rather, the intensity of pro
test I feel at the conditions
which prescribe the necessity of
such a device is greater.
My mace and I are rebelling. I
do not accept physical or emo
tional confinement in my life
style and this "protection" pro
vides an ingredient of power as I
bike to the Daily or walk home
from a lecture.
I certainly do not plan to flash
the cannister around taunting

muggers and rapists; not will I
prowl dark parking lots hoping
to catch some deviant and spray
him to death. But, the very act
of purchasing the mace and wit
nessing 30 other people do the
same validated my perceived
need and reinforced my decision
to tight back.
What a statement of the
times. Along with Econ 52 sec
tions, we have mace training
classes in the History Corner.
And, along with the women who
practiced shooting an im
aginary criminal chalked on the
board, about one-third the class
was comprised of men.
I reacted with ambivalence at
the gender integration: at least
women are not the only targets;
and, things are really bad when
men feel the need to carry tear
gas.
It's tough for a non-violent.

non-paranoid person to decide to
take this step. I feel a little ri
diculous toting around some
thing that resembles a de
odorant can. That's 0.K., I en
joy safety.
I can think of no place that is
tree from the invasion. A dra
matic word? Not really. All the
dark and isolated places have
been invaded. Perhaps not by
real threats, but you can ask any
woman on campus if she's feel
safe walking home alone from
the Quad at night and she'll
probably shudder.
Our thoughts, as well as the
shadows, have been invaded by
the reality that incidents occur
"too close to home" these days.
So, when I grab my back-pack
and cram in the I D. room key
and change tor the Tab, I carry a
pocket model of liquid spray
tear gas.

I am not convinced of this
route of defense. In fact, it rath
er sickens me. But, I am less
sure of doing nothing. I am a
firm believer in common sense:
avoiding walking alone, keeping
to well-lit areas, checking the
bathroom stalls late at night.
Unfortunately, you can't ask
a statistic if they took precau
tions. And, I d rather be a
statistic used by the advertisers
of mace than one cited by the po
lice department.
I am not entirely comfortable
with this addition to my life; I
am admittedly comforted by it.
I have a new escort these
days. And, I hope I'll never have
to introduce it to anyone.

Wednesday.)
I have a new escort these
days. A companion of sorts. I
am cautiously reassured by its
presence yet feel incredibly
hostile that I am compelled to
invite its company.
My escort is a can of mace.
What provoked the $27 check,
two hours of certification train
ing and a difficult choice to
carry a non-lethal weapon like
any other accessory for an eve
ning out?
Fear and reality.
I am afraid not to be pre
pared. Even if the can is only a
placebo reminding me of poten
tial danger — that is a start. My
acknowledgement of possible
attack is sharpened with this
ammunition.
It is my personal decision to
arm myself, in order to respond
to any person who may trespass

me that is significant. Not the
mace itselt. The assertion that
my person is worth defending is
far more powerful a weapon
than the tearing eyes, burning
throat and nausea the gas in
duces.
I am not falsely assured of
greater strength, agility or luck
with this tube clipped to a belt
buckle.
Rather, the intensity of pro
test I feel at the conditions
which prescribe the necessity of
such a device is greater.
My mace and I are rebelling. I
do not accept physical or emo
tional confinement in my life
style and this "protection" pro
vides an ingredient of power as I
bike to the Daily or walk home
from a lecture.
I certainly do not plan to flash
the cannister around taunting

muggers and rapists; not will I
prowl dark parking lots hoping
to catch some deviant and spray
him to death. But, the very act
of purchasing the mace and wit
nessing 30 other people do the
same validated my perceived
need and reinforced my decision
to tight back.
What a statement of the
times. Along with Econ 52 sec
tions, we have mace training
classes in the History Corner.
And, along with the women who
practiced shooting an im
aginary criminal chalked on the
board, about one-third the class
was comprised of men.
I reacted with ambivalence at
the gender integration: at least
women are not the only targets;
and, things are really bad when
men feel the need to carry tear
gas.
It's tough for a non-violent.

non-paranoid person to decide to
take this step. I feel a little ri
diculous toting around some
thing that resembles a de
odorant can. That's 0.K., I en
joy safety.
I can think of no place that is
tree from the invasion. A dra
matic word? Not really. All the
dark and isolated places have
been invaded. Perhaps not by
real threats, but you can ask any
woman on campus if she's feel
safe walking home alone from
the Quad at night and she'll
probably shudder.
Our thoughts, as well as the
shadows, have been invaded by
the reality that incidents occur
"too close to home" these days.
So, when I grab my back-pack
and cram in the I D. room key
and change tor the Tab, I carry a
pocket model of liquid spray
tear gas.

I am not convinced of this
route of defense. In fact, it rath
er sickens me. But, I am less
sure of doing nothing. I am a
firm believer in common sense:
avoiding walking alone, keeping
to well-lit areas, checking the
bathroom stalls late at night.
Unfortunately, you can't ask
a statistic if they took precau
tions. And, I d rather be a
statistic used by the advertisers
of mace than one cited by the po
lice department.
I am not entirely comfortable
with this addition to my life; I
am admittedly comforted by it.
I have a new escort these
days. And, I hope I'll never have
to introduce it to anyone.
