## Reagan proposals weakened by market 
### 
Washington (AP) — While President
Ronald Reagan is scoring political victories
in Congress, his economic proposals are in
danger of being undermined by forces in the
marketplace, administration and private
economists warn.
Rising interest rates, deep-seated fears
on Wall Street that high inflation will persist
indefinitely and problems in controlling the
nation's money pool threaten to neutralize
the economic benefits Reagan predicts will
flow frpm his budget and tax cuts.
"I'm very concerned about what is hap
pening," Beryl Sprinkel, an undersecretary
of the treasury for monetary affairs, said of
the recent jump in interest rates that fol
lowed a late April spurt in the money supp
ly-
Unless the growth of the money supply —
the currency and checking accounts Ameri
cans hold — is slowed to levels sought by the
Reagan administration, inflation will stay
high and "render our program ineffectual,"
asserted Sprinkel, one of the principal
architects of the president's plan for rein
vigorating the economy.
"The market disbelieves there is going to
be a successful fiscal policy from this ad
ministration or any administration," adds
Alan Greenspan, chairman of former Presi

dent Gerald Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers and now a private Wall Street con
sultant.
'Deep-seated skepticism'
"There is a deep-seated skepticism
(among investors)," said Greenspan, who
also serves as an adviser to Reagan. "They
are, in effect, saying the president's pro
gram is not enough, that significant cuts
(beyond those proposed by Reagan) are also
required."
While Reagan advisers acknowledge they
cannot produce "instant success" in undo
ing inflation, some administration officials
clearly have been disappointed that the fi
nancial markets have not reacted more
positively to the president's program by
lowering interest rates.
There also is concern that Reagan's
budget and tax proposals will succeed on a
political front — reducing the size ot the fed
eral government — without producing the
president's promised economic recovery.
For example:
• Rising interest rates drive up government
payments on the national debt,, wording
against the spending cuts Reagan is pushing
through Congress.
• Persistently high interest rates threaten
to choke off business activity and increase

unemployment, leading to higher govern
ment spending for jobless benefits or wel
fare and lower tax revenues. The result is an
increasing budget 'deficit at a time when
Reagan is trying to bring the budget into
balance by 1984.
• Higher-(han-expected inflation pushes
Americans into ever-higher tax brackets,
negating the intended impact of Reagan's
plan to encourage saving and investment
through personal tax cuts.
• Because oi pessimism about inflation and
the high cost of borrowing money, busi
nesses retrain from the kinds of invest
ments the administration says are neces
sary to stimulate economic growth, create
new jobs and improve productivity.
Shaped on assumption
The problems stem from the fact that
Reagan's program was shaped on the as
sumption that inflation and interest rates
would recede rapidly in the months and
years ahead.
Budget director David Stockman and oth
er administration economic advisers pre
dicted the inflationary psychology of Wall
Street investors and the general public
would be reversed soon after Reagan
showed he was serious about cutting the fed
eral budget and taxes.
