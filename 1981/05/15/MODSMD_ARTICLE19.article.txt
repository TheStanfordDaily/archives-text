Florida sinkhole grows
A 400 foot-wide sinkhole grows silently earlier this week in Winter Park, Fla. Residents have
moved their possessions from nearby homes and businesses as they wait for it to stop growing.
The 125 foot-deep hole, r caused as earth, weakened by a subterranean stream and pumping
from underground wells, collapsed late last week. The sinkhole has already destroyed a mu
nicipal swimming pool and swallowed a three-bedroom house and five expensive sportscars.
