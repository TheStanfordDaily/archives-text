# Phi Delts' prank ends in probation
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Members of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity were placed on social pro
bation last Monday following pledge
active wars which left three freshman
pledges drenched and stranded at an
El Camino Real motel.
The fraternity was placed on proba
tion because of the"serious lite en
dangering nature" of the prank, ac
cording to Assistant Row Director
Michael Jackson.
The three pledges, Eric Laurence, a
resident of Paloma in Florence
Moore, and Mike Rielly and Brian
Gonzalez, both of Larkin in Stern were
taken from their dorms by Phi Delts in
retaliation for a prank they pulled
earlier that day. The pledges had re
portedly abducted Phi Delt president
Jeff Bird, stripped him to his shorts,
and abandoned-him at a sorority pic
nlc.
Just before midnight on May 4, the
Phi Delts entered Larkin in search of
Rielly and Gonzalez. Rielly said that
his R.A., Kenneth Killianey, warned
him that the actives were looking for
him, but decided to go out anyway.
"It was totally voluntary," said
Rielly, "I wasn't "forced into any
thing."
The actives bound the pledges'
hands, put them in a car and drove to a
motel on El Camino Real. Once at the

motel the actives untied the pledges'
hands, but tied their feet. Actives then
threw the pledges into the shallow end
of the motel pool. According to Phi
Delt actives, at "no time" were they
in danger.
"I was out in two seconds; I never
telt like my life was threatened. All
the Phi Delts were still there to make
sure we were okay," said Rielly.
According to Phi Delts, police at the
scene called the prank "harmless"
and decided to ignore the incident
when the motel guard laughed the
matter off. Killianey however, re
ported the incident to Conklin the next
day. The Phi Delts were then notified
that they were up for disciplinary ac
tion from the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC). The pledges and actives say
they feel the penalty was unwar
ranted. "We are being used as an ex
ample," they said.
"Our prank was fairly minor in
comparison to other activities. Every
trat on campus has pledge-active
wars," said co-rush chairman, Tom
Kohn.
The Phi Delts claim that the prank
was "made to sound terrible," and
that the penalty signals a move to
crack down on the fraternity system.
"We didn't think it was that terrible.
The freshmen had a good time," Kohn
said.

According to Phi Delt R.A. Marc
Jones, the fraternity members did not
intentipnally break any rules. He and
Kohn stessed that if fraternity mem
bers had known their actions would be
punishable, the prank would not have
occurred. "We had no idea we would
offend anyone," Kohn said.
The penalty leveled by the judiciary
board of the IFC recommended that
the Phi Delts be placed on social pro
bation and requiired to pay a $300 fine.
Social probation means that the
fraternity will not be allowed to hold
any organized parties for the re
mainder of this year and six weeks of
tall quarter. The Phi Delts appealed
the original decision which would have
extended the social probationary peri
od through fall quarter.
Though upset with being placed on
probation, the Phi Delts say they ap
predate Jackson's help in "working
out the problem in a non-confronta
tional approach."
