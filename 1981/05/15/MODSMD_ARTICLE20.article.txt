# Watt tries to soft-pedal his anti- environmentalist reputation
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Embroiled in
almost-daily controversy and
faced with a weekly deluge of
hate mail, Secretary of the In
terior James Watt is working to
tone down his anti-environmen
tal image and shift to the center
of the conservation movement,
according to departmental
sources.
In a series of moves over the
last few weeks, Watt has tried to
woo those he considers the more
moderate environmentalists
while at the same time changing
his own public statements on
sensitive issues.
"He is definitely working to
move towards the center," one
source close to Watt said.
Evidence cited by friends of
the secretary include a speech
Monday in St. Louis in which
Watt told the American Mining
Congress that his shifts in poli

cies on public lands "cannot be
viewed as a relaxation of en
vironmental protection."
"The environment and its val
ues will be protected," Watt
warned the mine owners.
Pleasent surprise
Watt also pleasantly sur
prised environmentalists by en
dorsing Tom Garrett, as head of

the U.S. delegation to the In
ternational Whaling Com
mission.
"I think it's possible Watt
wants to throw a bone in the en
vironmental direction," said
Elizabeth Kaplan, legislative
director for Friends of the
Earth. "It's a very good ap
pointment."

However, Watt, who has re
cently been inviting conserva
tionists to breakfast, occasion
ally has trouble reining in his
combative spirit, especially
when he talks about his most vo
cal opponents among the con
servationists.
Stressing that he got along
with "volunteers," Watt told re

porters at a breakfast Wednes
day that "the hired guns ot the
environmental movement have
not been so cooperative."
"Their agenda is different,
for the most part all they are in
terested in is membership
dollars and headlines," Watt
said.
The comment immediately

roused those in the Washington
oifices of the environmental
groups he was talking about —
in particular, the Audubon Soci
ety, the Wilderness Society and
the Sierra Club.
"Sure, we're hired guns,"
said former Wisconsin Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, now chairman
of the Wilderness Society.

Watt, who joked with re
porters that he has not "spent
the time cultivating an image
for myself showing what a great
guy I am", said that if the White
House does order him to tone
down, he will do so.
"I work for the president of
the United States; he's the boss,
and I'm a team player."
