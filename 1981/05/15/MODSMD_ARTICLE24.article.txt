Do you remember the last three
major league "rookie phenoms" to
grace the cover of Sports Illustrated'
Don't worry, I can't recall them
either.
To refresh your memory-and
mine-the three coverboys were, in
order of their appearance: Clint Hur
dle of the Royals (1978), Harry Chap
pas of the White Sox (19791. and Kirk
Gibson of the Tigers (last year). To
say that none of three have taken
baseball by storm would not be miss
ing the point by much.
The moral of all this is simple.
While picking pennant-contending
clubs is so easy even a sports writer
can do it, finding talented young
ballplayers and predicting superstar
status for them is quite tricky. A 20-
year-old .300 hitter is much more like
ly to go the way ot Hon Blumberg.
than of George Brett. A youthful fire
baller is far more capable of burning
himself out as Mark Fidrych did, than
ot dominating year in, year out the
way Steve Carlton has.
But, as Nietzsche says, "Live dan
gerously!" Thus the rationale for
presenting my team for the eighties:
eleven young players who are des
tined to be stars this decade. You
don't have to agree with my choices,
of course. However, by the time I'm
proven wrong, we'll all be in El
Salvador anyway.

Catcher: Tcry Kennedy, age 24,
Padres
Credentials: Smooth behind the
plate and a potentially lethal hitter,
(he's currently batting 3*3)
Comments: Kennedy is as diligent
and unselfish as they come If only the
poor, poor, pitiful Padres had a few
more like him
First Base: Eddie Murray. 25, Ori
oles
Credentials: 4'X)-plus rbi, 100-plus
home runs, and a career batting aver
age ot .290, terrific totals for just four
big league seasons.
Comments: So good and yet so
quiet about it. Get this man a press
agent
Second Base: Tony Bernadez, 24.
White Sox
Credentials: A complete player
Tony runs well, fields nicely, and is
presently sixth in the American
League batting < .340).
Comments: This former Expo
might be a flash in the pan. but he is
really taking charge for the young
(15-13) Chisox.
Shortstop: Robin Yount, 25,
Brewers
Credentials: Now in his eighth sea
son. Yount his .293 last year with 23
home runs and 87 rbi.
Comments: Gary Templeton of St.
Louis might be more gifted in the
field, but Yount is no slouch de
fensively, and he hits like a third
baseman Mount St. Steinbrenner

erupts regularly at the thought ot this
guy in Yankee pinstripes.
Third Base: Bob Horner, 23.
Braves
Credentials: In three incomplete
seasons in the bigs Horner has
smacked 9' homers, driven in 250
runs, batted 287, and built up a
monstrous .533 slugging percentage
Comments: Look out Roger Maris!
Brave mascot chief Noc-A-Homa is
reportedly playing out his option You
wouldn't want to do that dopey dance
more than 61 times in one season
either.
Outfield: Tim Raines, 21, Expos
Credentials: 30 steals in his first 28
games this season, plus a batting av
erage of .355 (fifth best in N.L.)
Comments: The perfect lead-off
hitter.
Outfield: Ricky Henderson, 22. A s
Credentials:' Last year Henderson
hit .303, totalled 111 runs, and broke
Ty Cobbs A.L. record with '00 stolen
bases.
Comments: Like Raines, Ricky has
an unusual amount of patience tor a
young batter (he drew I' 7 walks in
1980). He also gets a lot of help from
Oakland's two other fine young out
fielders, Dwayne Murphy and Tony
Armas.
Outfield: David Green, 20,
Cardinals
Credentials: A minor league terror
(Green hit 19 triples in the Eastern
League last year, eclipsing the mark

of L A s Reggie Smith) who will
crack the bigs sometime soon
Comments: If you listen to the
scouts. David is the greatest thing
since sliced bread He has power,
speed, and "Fete Rose's mental abili
ties I still can't figure out whether
that's a compliment or not
Lefthanded Starting Pitcher:
Fernando Valenzuela, 20. Dodgers
Credentials: Off to the best start by
a rookie pitcher since Vida Blue broke
in with the Asa decade ago. Fernan
do's ledger is flawless seven starts,
seven victories, an era of 0.29. and 61
strikeouts
Comments: a poised screwballer'
(he goes to his "scroogie" tor about
half of his pitches). Valenzuela is
dominating the major leagues at an
age when most ol us can't even domi
nate our midterms.
Righthanded Starting Pitcher:
Mike Norris. 26. A s
Credentials: Should have won the
Cy Young Award last year Behold his
1980 figues: 22 wins, nine losses, a 2.53
ere, 180 k's, and 24 complete games.
Comments: "I'm going to be one ot
the greatest pitchers," admists
modest Mike. With his fine fastball
and wicked screwball. Norris is not
too tar away now
Relief Pitcher: Neil Allen. 23. Mets
Credentials: 22 saves last year for a
delightfully bad team.

Don't worry, I can't recall them

To refresh your memory-and
mine-the three coverboys were, in

baseball by storm would not be miss

The moral of all this is simple.
While picking pennant-contending
clubs is so easy even a sports writer

ballplayers and predicting superstar
status for them is quite tricky. A 20-

baller is far more capable of burning
