that provided the New York Is
landers with a 6-3 victory over
the Minnnesota North Stars last

lead in the Stanley Cup finals.
Mike Bossy, with his 4th and
15th goals of the playoffs, tied a
record with 29 points in one post
season. The record was set a
year ago by teammate Bryan

15 Islander playoff games this

advantage of a tripping penalty
on Neal Broten as Potvin fired a
40-foot wrist shot past a
screened Don Beaupre in the
Minnesota goal.
Jn the first period, the Is
landers' star defenseman had
blasted a 55-foot slap shot past
Beaupre's outstretched glove to

Earlier in that period, Bossy

a wrist shot from the slot and

Bob Nystrom sent a perfectly
placed shot trom the left wing
circle into the far corner of the
net.
But the young North Stars,
bolstered by the play ot five
rookies, mounted their come
back. Rookie Brad Palmer's 30-
toot slap shot went over goalie
Billy Smith's shoulder at 9 .15 ot
the second period to make it 3-2.
Beaupre then kept the North
Stars in the game with several
miraculous saves, including

three against the Islanders' Bob
Bourne while he was lying on the
ice.
Payne tied it by knocking a re
bound past Smith, who ap
parently injured his right shoul
der on the play but remained in
the game.
Then Potvin took over, scor
ing his game-winner and setting
up Ken Morrow for an insurance
goal that gave Potvin 100 career
plavoft points.
