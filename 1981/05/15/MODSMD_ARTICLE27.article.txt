# That's the guy who beat Connors

### Ivan Maisel 
When Brad Gilbert of Foothill College up
set Tim Mayotte 6-3. 1-6, 6-3 March 3, his
father jumped up, clapping and yelling, then
turned to his friends and said, "Well, that's
an indirect win over Connors. "
Scott Davis is the freshman phenom on
the Stanford tennis team. Davis is unbeaten
in 13 dual matches, losing only two sets all
season. He is currently the No. 1 ranked col
legian in the nation. >
Tim Mayotte is The Guy Who Beat Jimmy
Connors. Period.
Never mind that Mayotte has made the
quarterfinals of his last three pro tour
naments. Never mind that he beat Davis 7-5.
6-2 in the finals of the Pacitic-'O Conference
tournament. Never mind that he has firmly
established himself as No. 1 for coach Dick
Gould's Cardinals, who play Utah in the
first round of the NCAA tournament in
Athens, Ga. tomorrow at 8 a.m. (EDT).
Until further notice, which could come in
the shape of an NCAA singles title, Mayotte
is The Guy Who Beat Jimmy Connors. Peri
od. And that pressure still exists eight
months after he beat Connors 3-6, 7-6. 7-6 in
the third round of the Transamerica Open
"That will always stay until 1 establish
myself as a professional." Mayotte said
"After I beat Connors, it was There's one
amazing win in a sea of wins that were?com
paratively insignificant ' I questioned my
self more then than now. I've beaten nobody
of that caliber, but I have beaten Terry
Moor and Trey Waltke," both of whom are

in the top 50 in the worfd
There are few athletes at any level who
would beat the No. 3 player in the world and
then worry about it. But Tim Mayotte is a
thinker, Rodin's sculpture in Adidas shorts.
When asked a question, he will think
about it for several seconds before giving a
long, explanatory answer. Mavotte's deep
brown eyes are fixed in a searching stare,
making sure the subject of that stare under
stands him. There is always a hint of a smile
on his long face.
"He's the best kid I ever had. just a
phenomenal person," Gould said. "He is
very genuine, and a hard worker. He's not a
real rah-rah guy, but he's enough of a leader
that his teammates voted him team captain
the last two years."
Mayotte doesn't believe in rah-rah stuff
Nor does he believe in the slam-the-ball
technique teammate Jim Gurfein employs
to let off steam. He does not argue calls. At
best, a not-quite-stifled scream sneaks out
two or three times a match.
"1 think maintaining dignity on the court
is more important than winning I'm not
sure a lot of people will agree with me," the
20-year-old said. His objective on the court
is to be "mentally tough, be as good as I can
while maintaining a sense of dignity."
His composure — and his game — made a
fan oi Arizona State coach Myron
McNamara. "He's one of the few kids I'd
pay to see play. Tim's a cool dude."
Mayotte enjoys leading by example. Af
ter all. at No. 1. everyone can see him. "I

don't know what symbolic role it plays In
the past it's been shown at the NCAAs that
it's important tor the No. 1 to do well," he
said.
"A lot of people look up to Bon Man'
(Seott Bonduranti," Mayotte said. "Scott
Davis' impact and confidence has put him in
that role. This year we share the role."
Davis is cozy where he is. thank you At
the Pac- 0 tournament, when he played
Mayotte tor not only the league title but the
team's top spot (Gould had informed both
players that " whoever had done significant
ly better than the other would be No. 1 ">.
the freshman had qualms about replacing
Mayotte.
"He deserves to be No 1," Davis said. "I
don't know if 1 would be comfortable. "
Mayotte (12-3) has clearly improved as
the season has progressed. He made a con
scious effort to do so after peaking too early
last season. After winning 19 consecutive
matches during the regular season, he lost
three matches on the slow courts in Athens.
They shouldn't bother him this year.
Ojai's slow courts failed to rattle him.
"He's a much better all-court player. His
groundstrokes are greatly improved," the
coach added. "He's hitting better now than
all year."
"He's very powerful, capable of blowing
anybody off the court." Billy Nealon. USC's
top player and 0-3 against Mayotte this year,
said. "The win over Connors says a lot for
his game. "

the Stanford tennis team. Davis is unbeaten
in 13 dual matches, losing only two sets all
season. He is currently the No. 1 ranked col
legian in the nation. >
Tim Mayotte is The Guy Who Beat Jimmy
Connors. Period.
Never mind that Mayotte has made the
quarterfinals of his last three pro tour
naments. Never mind that he beat Davis 7-5.
6-2 in the finals of the Pacitic-'O Conference
tournament. Never mind that he has firmly
established himself as No. 1 for coach Dick
Gould's Cardinals, who play Utah in the
first round of the NCAA tournament in
Athens, Ga. tomorrow at 8 a.m. (EDT).
Until further notice, which could come in
the shape of an NCAA singles title, Mayotte
is The Guy Who Beat Jimmy Connors. Peri
od. And that pressure still exists eight
months after he beat Connors 3-6, 7-6. 7-6 in
the third round of the Transamerica Open
"That will always stay until 1 establish
myself as a professional." Mayotte said
"After I beat Connors, it was There's one
amazing win in a sea of wins that were?com
paratively insignificant ' I questioned my
self more then than now. I've beaten nobody
of that caliber, but I have beaten Terry
Moor and Trey Waltke," both of whom are

in the top 50 in the worfd
There are few athletes at any level who
would beat the No. 3 player in the world and
then worry about it. But Tim Mayotte is a
thinker, Rodin's sculpture in Adidas shorts.
When asked a question, he will think
about it for several seconds before giving a
long, explanatory answer. Mavotte's deep
brown eyes are fixed in a searching stare,
making sure the subject of that stare under
stands him. There is always a hint of a smile
on his long face.
"He's the best kid I ever had. just a
phenomenal person," Gould said. "He is
very genuine, and a hard worker. He's not a
real rah-rah guy, but he's enough of a leader
that his teammates voted him team captain
the last two years."
Mayotte doesn't believe in rah-rah stuff
Nor does he believe in the slam-the-ball
technique teammate Jim Gurfein employs
to let off steam. He does not argue calls. At
best, a not-quite-stifled scream sneaks out
two or three times a match.
"1 think maintaining dignity on the court
is more important than winning I'm not
sure a lot of people will agree with me," the
20-year-old said. His objective on the court
is to be "mentally tough, be as good as I can
while maintaining a sense of dignity."
His composure — and his game — made a
fan oi Arizona State coach Myron
McNamara. "He's one of the few kids I'd
pay to see play. Tim's a cool dude."
Mayotte enjoys leading by example. Af
ter all. at No. 1. everyone can see him. "I

don't know what symbolic role it plays In
the past it's been shown at the NCAAs that
it's important tor the No. 1 to do well," he
said.
"A lot of people look up to Bon Man'
(Seott Bonduranti," Mayotte said. "Scott
Davis' impact and confidence has put him in
that role. This year we share the role."
Davis is cozy where he is. thank you At
the Pac- 0 tournament, when he played
Mayotte tor not only the league title but the
team's top spot (Gould had informed both
players that " whoever had done significant
ly better than the other would be No. 1 ">.
the freshman had qualms about replacing
Mayotte.
"He deserves to be No 1," Davis said. "I
don't know if 1 would be comfortable. "
Mayotte (12-3) has clearly improved as
the season has progressed. He made a con
scious effort to do so after peaking too early
last season. After winning 19 consecutive
matches during the regular season, he lost
three matches on the slow courts in Athens.
They shouldn't bother him this year.
Ojai's slow courts failed to rattle him.
"He's a much better all-court player. His
groundstrokes are greatly improved," the
coach added. "He's hitting better now than
all year."
"He's very powerful, capable of blowing
anybody off the court." Billy Nealon. USC's
top player and 0-3 against Mayotte this year,
said. "The win over Connors says a lot for
his game. "
