But wait! Are the forces even

friends The forces of dark are
so secret that we don't even
know they're taking over.)
Such is the stuff of Masks of
the Illuminati. Robert Anton
Wilson's latest delving into the
mysteries of conspiracy theo
ries.
And thank goodness it's fic
tion. For as Wilson has amply
shown in his non-fiction work.
Cosmic Trigger, he tends to
meander around his assertions
until they're lost — long before
he even gets to the point. To be
sure. Masks of the Illuminati
does break from pure narrative

torm But more on that below.
Wilson's novel centers around
the story ot Sir John Babcock
Babcock. in a state of near in
sanity, recounts the past tew
years of his life, as he tirst dis
co vers, then becomes
fascinated by. and finally be
comes a member ot the "Golden
Dawn."
He recounts his spooky story
to none other than Albert Eins
tein and James Joyce, who find
Sir John passed out on a London
pub floor in 9 4. Master physi
cist and decadent author pro
vide amusing foils for Bab
cock's story, as they interject
and exchange quips.
Through flashbacks, we are
given glimpses of Babcock's
last tive years of inquisition and
training, until his realization ot
the higher schemes around him.
Like the Wilson's conspiracy
theory i which says a secret so
ciety — Illuminati. if you choose
— is taking over the world
through practices only vaguely
understood by the layperson). it
is never resolved whether or not
the grander schemes even exist.
But it's fun trying to stay with

the mystery Wilson untolds for
us.
That is. if you can sit through
some of his self-indulgence.
Wilson, something ot an expert
in parapsychology, can't resist
showing off how much he knows,
sometimes to the detriment of
the novel.
Wilson frequently uses
stream-of-consciousness narra
tion — usually in the mind of Sir
John, who nears madness as he
discovers there are no coin
cidences. Wilson also interjects
television scenes, complete
with camera angles, lighting,
and sound effects (do I hear the
call of Hollywood' 1 ). He takes us
into the present with question
and answer sessions in which he
furthers his hypotheses about
the Illuminati and modern day
phenomena.
Fortunately he doesn't take
himself too seriously. The Mor
al Majority becomes "bocca
grande giganticus" and a game
show contestant wins "a con
solation prize ot one year's sup
ply of Preparation Hand com
plete instructions on how to use
it."
Unfortunately. Wilson does
have a knack for throwing the
reader about unmercifully. We
go, in rapid succession, from the
game show, to the back streets
ot London in the 9 O's, and to
the mind ot Sir John in the midst
of a drug trip — which lasts 30
pages. Still, most of Wilson's in
terjections and toying are
amusing or within the bounds of
the story.
If one can tolerate the occa
sional lapses. Masks of the Il
luminati is an amusing conjec
ture for those even a bit in
terested in conspiracy theories
It doesn't provide any answers
and it may be a bit much for a
tirst taste, but it's worth a try
for anyone with an open mind
and a lighthearted view.
