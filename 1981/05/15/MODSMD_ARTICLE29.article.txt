Lucy is a 3.5 million year old
partial skeleton of a human an
cestor uncovered in late 1974, by
American paleoanthropologist
Donald Johanson in Ethiopia's
remote Afar region. These
fossilized bones are the oldest,
most complete skeleton of any
erect-walking human fore
bearer. and have significantly
altered the way scientists view
our origins.
In Lucy. Johanson, in col
laboration with science writer
Maitland Edey, offers a
fascinating and compelling ac
count of Lucy's discovery and
implications. The book should
be required reading for all those
who wish to install "scientific"
creationism in our schools, for it
clearly reveals the extent of our
knowledge about man's origins
and why scientists interpret this
knowledge as they do.
The major question which
confronted Johanson and his
colleague Timothy White, a UC-
Berkeley paleoanthropologist,
was where to place Lucy on

mankind's family tree. Lucy
was a creature with a brain far
too small to be considered hu
man, yet she walked upright,
the quintessential hallmark of
humanity. This paradox ul
timately forced Johanson and
White to redraw the family tree
and create the first new hominid
species name in 5 years in or
der to find a niche for Lucy.
The first half of Lucy moves
with the swiftness and suspense
of a detective novel. The au
thors recount the early history
of paleoanthropology with its
startling discoveries and con
troversies, setting the stage for
the find of Johnason and others
in the 1960s and 19705, The feuds
which have long been character
istic of the profession are also
chronicled, and these too pres
age the experiences of
Johanson.
Johanson's work at Afar is
presented in much the same
tense, expectant tone as the
background history. Important
finds are dramatically re
counted, but the reader is also
allowed to glimpse the tedium
and routine involved in develop
ing a site. Johanson's worries
over funding, his self-doubts,
and concern over the volatile po
litical situation in Ethiopia
make it clear that field work
bears little resemblance to the
idealized view seen in National
Geographic Society television
specials.
The discovery of Lucy and the
other significant hominid fossils
at Afar offer gripping and dra
matic reading, yet the book is at
its best when the authors are
discussing the analysis of the
fossils and the attempts of
Johanson and White to unravel
their mysteries. In the past
most laymen have been forced
to either accept or reject the
pronouncements of an
thropologists, and in fact all sci
entists, without adequately un
derstanding or even comprehen
ding how they'd arrived at their
conclusions. The authors of
Lucy work very hard at making
these complex processes under
standable. Without pandering,
but in clear simple terminology,
they lead the reader through the
intricacies of fossil analysis and
dating. You get fascinating

crash courses on potassium
argon dating, geology, biostrati
graphy. and the differences be
tween human and ape dentition
This information allows you to
make the analysis of Lucy along
with Johanson instead of having
it shoved down your throat as a
scientific fait accompli.
The account of the analysis bj?
Johanson and White is disarm
ingly candid Johanson frankly
admits that his own biases, his
desire to classify Lucy as hu
man. blinded him to reality.
White's persistent arguments
finally convinced him that she
could not be truly human with
such a small brain. Johanson
even admits that he wishes he'd
never published an early arti-

cle, written in the first flush of
discovery, claiming Lucy to be
human. These are startling ad
missions from a man \yho calm
ly boasts of his "unp&ralleled
collection" of fossils, and whom
White describes as a "sales
man, a real operator."
The authors advance an in
teresting notion, based on the
work of C. Owen Love joy of
Kent State University, to ex
plain Lucy's bipedalism. Her
primitive nature destroyed the
traditional notions that man
walked erect only after his brain
began to enlarge and he started
using tools. Lovejoy's eloquent
ly argued theory posits that pair

bonding and the development of
the nuclear family caused
bipedalism. It is a fascinating
idea.
The importance of Lucy to an
understanding of human origins
is undeniable. We must some
how place this ancient,
primitive, but erect walking lit
tle creature into our collective
family tree. Or so argues
Johanson. This conclusion has
touched off the latest teud
within the profession, with
Johanson and White vehemently
opposed by the two most famous
paleoanthropologists in the
world, Mary and Richard
Leakey. The Leakey's refuse to
believe that man could possibly
have evolved from so primitive

a creature as Lucy, yet ap
parently can advance no con
crete evidence to disprove
Johanson and White. The entire
book is, in one sense, a heavy
barrage aimed at the Leakeys.
Johanson and Edey present a
convincing and apparently
seamless argument for Lucy's
position as a human ancestor.
While they are hardly objective
observers, they are to be given
a great deal of credit for arguing
their case in such a manner that
the layman can arrive at his own
conclusions in an intelligent
manner. Lucy is truly spellbind
ing, and I, for one, am ready to
welcome her into the family.
