Notorious v***
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Notorious, directed by Alfred
Hitchcock, is a spy story done with
the wit and grace of high comedy;
it is among the most beautifully
crafted films of the genre This is a
film composed ot gleaming sur
faces: keys, winebottles, and
teacups take on a glowing sheen of
intrigue. Gary Grant plays an
American agent who must dis
cover the secrets of Claude Rains
The device he uses is Ingrid
Bergman. The film's irony is that
Rains engages our sympathies
more than Grant does — Rains is
the member of the triangle who
knows the least and whose love is
most sincere
Ted Tetzlatf did the stunning
black-and-white photography;
Ben Hecht wrote the script

Alfred Hitchcock directed this
tale of intrigue set in the days im
mediately preceding World War
11. Though it has neither the moral
depth nor the ambiguity of
Hitchcock's greatest work, it nev
ertheless manages to be wonder
fully entertaining. The movie is
filled with the set-pieces
Hitchcock is famous for; a wind
mill, used as a signal by spies, has
vanes that spin backwards; a
rainy-day murderer is hidden in a
sea of people carrying umbrellas:
a plane crash over the ocean is
filmed from the pilot's point of

The Postman A luays Rings
Twice **
Guild, Menlo Park
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
Double-billed with Gloria.

By turns magnificent and pre
posterous, luminous and opaque,

this film of the Arthurian legend is
a tribute to director John
Boorman's freakish talent Bad
writing wars with classical, pain
terly tableau battles and scenes in
which the fairy-tale grandeur of
the movie catches us up in the ro
mantic whirl of the story. The act
ing is highly variable: Nicol Wil
liamson is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin; Paul Geoftrey plays Sir
Percival feelingly; Helen Mirren,
as Morgana, has some high witchy
moments; and most of the other
principals are dwarfed by the stat
ure of the characters they are

There are some interesting per

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first tew minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num
bers. Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeezfe' the life
right out of this picture. Redford is
better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially good.

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first tew minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num
bers. Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeezfe' the life

Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially good.

Notorious, directed by Alfred

The Postman A luays Rings
Twice **
Guild, Menlo Park
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first tew minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num

in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul

Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master

Guild, Menlo Park
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

Fox, Redwood City
There are about three good
minutes in this one, and those
three—most of them involving
singing, dancing, and suchlike
are choice. But to get those few
nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours ot / was a
Teenaged Chorus Line. All the fa
miliar faces are here: an ignorant
but-talented ghetto kid. a girl who
brings along a Jewish mother out
of a '40s comic strip, and a lonely
but-talented homosexual son of a
tamous actress. All work to prove
that it takes an incredible amount
of talent to keep churning out
melodrama.
Alan Parker, who made the
world safe for stereotypes with
1978' s Midnight Express,
directed. Plays tonight and tomor
row night with* The Idolmaker.

Nighthawks
Old Mill, Mountain View
Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee
Williams star as cops who must
track down a psychopathic, fiend
ishly intelligent terrorist who is
fiendishly terrorizing New York
City. The message of the film
seems to be that only fools believe
that it is possible to deal with vio
lence non-violently. Luckily for
the humanists among us, the
film's dialogue is so bad and its
pacing so inept that even this
message gets lost in the telling.

The Hlnck Stallion ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege ot Francis Coppola,
directed The Hlack Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one. Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work ot striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
, A bov and a horse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island, when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal. Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in what has become an
alien landscape.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Watrrship Down.

Private Benjamin **
Sunday, Mem Aud
A Goldie Hawn-production of a
Goldie Hawn star vehicle. The
movie is a big-budgeted "Perils of
Goldie. " Hawn plays a know-noth
ing rich girl who loses her hus
band. meets the reality of the
army, grows up. becomes inde
pendent thinking. Hawn's talents
are considerable, but she's lost
much ot her perspective here —
many of her best sequences are
pushed beyond the breaking point.
Director Howard Zieft (Hearts of
the West) has a nice comic touch,
but he stumbles badly when the
movie takes a romantic turn.

9 to 5 *
Old Mill, Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a take feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance; trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic temale incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.

The Stunt Man
Menlo, Menlo Park
It's the old theme of reality ver
sus illusion, but in an astonishingly
witty new setting The director,
Richard Rush, reverses every au
dience expectation in this
audacious, kinetic comedy about
making movies. Peter O'Toole
gives an imaginative, self-de
lighted performance as Eli Cross,
a filmmaker who revels in risks
Steve Railsback plays the stunt
man. The cast also includes Allen
Goorwitz (who used to be called
Allen Garfield) in another good
performance and Barbara
Hershey (who used to be called

New Varsity. Palo Alto
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a film most
notable for its lack of distinction
Director Martin Rosen bragged in
interviews at the time of the film's
release that he knew nothing about
animation before undertaking Wa
ti-rship Down, and it shows in ev
ery institutionally colored frame
This is one of those attempts at
mystic whimsy that make you
leave the theater feeling like
you've slept all night with your
mouth open.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
The Black Stallion.

Ordinary People **
Old Mill, Mountain View
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first tew minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num
bers. Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeezfe' the life
right out of this picture. Redford is
better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially good.
With Mary Tyler Moore and
Donald Sutherland.
