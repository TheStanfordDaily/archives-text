Pope remains in intensive care
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II was reported in satis
factory condition yesterday, but still not out of danger, as
Italian police broadened their investigation to check
whether his assailant had ties with international terrorist
groups.
A day after the pontiff was shot while on the way to an
audience in St. Peter's Square, doctors reported that he
was conscious and alert, but would have to remain in the
intensive care unit for one or two more days.
The pope will faci? further delicate surgery when doc
tors terminate a bypass of his intestine that they con
structed during the five hours and 30 minutes of surgery
Wednesday night. No date has been set for the new
surgery.
The damage to his intestine, caused by the bullets that
penetrated his abdomen, was so extensive that doctors
performed a temporary colostomy — the surgical process
of forming an artificial anal opening. His intestines are
being evacuated through a special abdominal tube.
Doctors said that the pope still faces a risk of infection
from what they called contamination of the abdominal
cavity.
The doctors reaffirmed, however, that the prognosis for
the pope's recovery remains "reserved," the same word
that they used following the surgery. This was seen as an
indication of the risks that remain.
The length of the operation — 54 hours — was caused by
the necessity for numerous resections — removing dam
aged portions of the intestine while trying to save as much
as possible of the organ.
The pope's loss of three liters of blood — more than half
of the body's supply — was the first problem faced by the
doctors, just as it had been for doctors operating on Presi
dent Ronald Reagan after he was shot six weeks earlier.
The "massive hemorrhaging" was in the abdominal cavi
ty
The pope asked about the condition of the two women in
jured in Wednesday's shooting yesterday evening. He also
received the Eucharist.
Last night's medical bulletin reported no change in John
Paul's condition during the day, an encouraging sign of
stabilization. Further, doctors said that his consciousness
had improved. They cited his expressions of concern for
the two other victims, and of brief conversations that he
had with church officials.
Conference committee passes budget
Washington — House and Senate budget writers gave
their approval last night to a $695.4-billion compromise
spending plan for 1982, making way for President Ronald
Reagan's program of deep cuts in taxes and spending.
Using newly revised administration economic assump
tions that some Democrats scoffed at, the non-binding
budget blueprint predicts a deficit of $37.6 billion. That
compares with the $45 billion Reagan estimated last win
ter.
The compromise is expected to win final passage in both
houses of Congress next week. Since the plan is non-bind
ing. it does not need Reagan's signature.
There was no final vote, but representatives of the two
houses sent the measure on to the House and Senate by
signing their names to the compromise.
The spending figure is almost identical to the $695.3
billion Reagan recommended when he sent his budget pro
posals to Congress last February.
The compromise envisions a surplus of slightly more
than $1 billion in 1984 — the year Reagan said he would bal

ance the budget.
For 982, aides said the plan calls for immediate cuts of
about $36 billion, but would not necessarily encompass all
the reductions Reagan proposed this week for Social Se
curity.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M), chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, said of the compromise. "It's a fragile
thing but I think we can get it over with."
The compromise envisions cuts of more than $36 billion
in spending, mostly on social programs. It also calls for an
accelerated defense budget and leaves room for the 30 per
cent, three-year tax cuts Reagan wants to revitalize the
economy.
British release hunger striker's body
Belfast, Northern Ireland — British authorities failed to
release the the body of IRA hunger striker Francis Hughes
tor seven hours Wednesday until his family agreed not to
drive it through Roman Catholic West Belfast tor a hero's
farewell.
The move, in an attempt to avert further violence, came
as Catholic rioters attacked police patrols with gasoline
and acid bombs in West Belfast in angry response to
Hughes' death. The 25-year-old guerrilla, convicted of
murdering a soldier, died Tuesday on the 59th day of a fast
at the Maze prison.
Hughes, a legendary figure in the IRA, had been serving
a life sentence. He and 27-year-old Bobby Sands, who
starved himself to death a week before, went on hunger
strike in a bid to win from the British government political
prisoner status for Irish nationalists.
Eric Guiney, 45, a milkman who died Wednesday
without regaining consciousness, was the fifth person
killed violently since Sands died nine days ago.
His death raised the known death toll from Northern Ire
land's nearly 12 years of political and sectarian bloodshed
to at least 2101.
Security chiefs feared that taking Hughes' body through
the Andersonstown and Falls Roads districts would touch
off more trouble in the area where violence flared Tuesday
night.
Police delayed releasing the body from the city morgue
in Forster Green hospital until Hughes' family agreed to
drive it in a hearse straight to their home in Bellaghy, 40
miles northwest of here. He is due to be buried there with
full IRA military honors this afternoon.
In West Belfast, more than'sooo IRA supporters waited
in vain for Hughes' body to be driven to St. Agnes' Catholic
Church for a service and two-mile procession through the
turbulent district.
The condition of two other hunger strikers, Raymond
McCreesh and Patrick O'Hara, both 24, "continued to de
teriorate" on their 53rd day without food, the Northern
Ireland Office reported.
Begin worried about Syrian missiles
Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Menachem Begin
yesterday told reporters outside his office that the downed
drone proves that the Syrian missiles represent a "grave
danger" to Israel's security.
Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, in a news
conference while visiting the Israel-Lebanon border, said
the purpose of Israeli reconnaissance flights is to provide
early warning against an attack and that it should be re
membered that Syria has attacked Israel three times.
Israeli army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Rafael Eitan said in
an interview last night on Israeli television that Israel will

continue its overflights of Lebanon because it is necessary
for national security.
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union has urged Syria not to es
calate the current confrontation with Israel into a full
scale war but has not tried to persuade Damascus to
withdraw its Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles from
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley as Israel has demanded, accord
ing to Western and Asian diplomats here.
Indeed, it is widely believed in the diplomatic communi
ty that the Soviets would replace immediately any mis
siles knocked out by the Israelis.
No matter how much Moscow wants wants to prevent
another Middle East war, which it and the United States
could be dragged into, diplomats here say it cannot afford
to anger Syria.
UC defers weapons lab decision
Los Angeles — A University of California regents com
mittee, on a split vote yesterday, decided to postpone for
one month its consideration of the seven-year renewal of
major contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy for
operation of two nuclear weapons labs.
UC student Tracy Powell, external affairs coordinator
from the student government on the Berkeley campus, had
asked that the action be postponed until October and stu
dent Regent Leslie Lurie said she wanted to examine the
complete 150-page DOE contract for the Lawrence Liver
more Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., and Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico. At least half their re
search is geared to weapons development, including nucle
ar, laser, particle beams and others. Lurie also asked that
the public be allowed to comment on the contract.
The vote on Regent Stanley Sheinbaum's motion to post
pone was 6-4. The full board of regents had been scheduled
to take up the contract renewal today.
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, recently appointed to
the board of regents by Gov. Jerry Brown, said in a tele
gram to the regents yesterday that he was strongly op
posed to the inclusion of the contract renewal item on the

agenda and contended it was scheduled at the "last
minute."
UC President David Saxon voted for the motion to post
pone but said he was doing so in spite of the telegram from
Brown and in no way because of it.
Saxon said he had not had a single word from the gov
ernor despite trying to call him every day for a week
before the regents' meeting.
Saxon also said regent lobbyist Lowell Paige had tried to
call speaker Brown every day for a week and that he, Sax
on, had left a message for Brown to call him anytime be
tween dinner and dawn but he was never called.
Sheinbaum said he found Willie Brown's telegram "of
fensive."
"He is attempting to politicize this board, which has to
fight against politicization," Scheinbaum said, adding that
he proposed the motion to postpone so that Lurie and the
other regents could thoroughly review the contract if they
wished.

vance credited to speculation that the interest-rate out
look might soon improve.

Wednesday, climbed 5.31 to 973.07.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 42.75 million
shares, against 42.60 million Wednesday.
