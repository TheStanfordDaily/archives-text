# Language requirement passes
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
Foreign language will be added to
the list of graduation requirements be
ginning with the freshman class that
will enter Stanford in the fall of 1982.
Following a long debate, the Facul
ty Senate yesterday voted to require
students to demonstrate foreign lan
guage proficiency equivalent to one
year qt study at Stanford.
The requirement can be fulfilled in
one of three ways:
• completing the third quarter of first
year language study here; 112
• demonstrating by exam competency
at a level comparable to one year of
study here;
• having completed the third-year
course of one foreign language ir> high
school.
Assoc. History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, who chairs the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) which
made the proposal, said,"The lan
guage requirement will lie outside of
the framework of the distribution re
quirements because students may be
exempt. It will instead be a fifth grad
uation requirement (180 units, major
requirements, writing requirement,
distribution requirements, and for
eign language requirement).
Students wishing to be exempted
will have to show proficiency through

a CEEB (College Entrance Examina
tion Board) placement test or a Stan
ford language department test. The
specific test format has still to be de
cided.
Faculty reaction to the proposed re
quirement ranged from "very se
vere" to "too weak." William Rey
nolds, chairman of the mechanical en
gineering department said the re
quirement would be "hard on engi
neering students with no incoming lan
guage," because engineers already
have 147 required units, including
their major requirements, writing re
quirement, and distribution require
ments. "The language requirement
really is a burden that is going to limit
our students very severely."
In a discussion of the resources
needed to implement the new require
ment, Dean ot the Engineering School
William Kays said, "I can find the re
sources. All we need to do is abolish
the undergraduate Engineering De
partment."
Reporting on the financial implica
tions of the proposed requirements,
English Prof. Martin Evans said the
cost could be anywhere from $190,0(30
to $315,0(30 for the first year the re
quirement ts in effect. Evans anid.
"Financially, this represents some
what of a leap into the dark."

But Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
said, "We're not pioneering here.
Most universities have some language
requirement. We've had a language
requirement in the past and were able
to afford it."
In response to the plight of the engi
neering department, Kenneth Arrow,
economics, said, "Engineering can
make it clear to incoming students
that they need to take a language in
high school."
Dean ot Admissions Fred Hargadon
warned. "Don't be too optimistic
about sending signals to high schools.
They are having difficulty holding on
to third-year programs in anything."
But he added, "I'm in favor of this pro
posal. I really don't think it's all that
revolutionary."
Ronald Rebholz, English professor,
said, "My problem is with the
weakness of this proposal. There's not
enough being required. My feeling is
that CUS has bent over backwards to
satisfy the school ot engineering."
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs
agreed. "I think the senate should
adoptlhis proposal because it will give
the stud&ntst less &thnocentricity. Wc
hope that over the years we can
strengthen the requirement."
