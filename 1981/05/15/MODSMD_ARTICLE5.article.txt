# Guest prof Burnett shares lobbying techniques
## 
### Todd Pickett 
For 25-year-old Andre Burnett, a
degree in experience from the school
of lite has proven itself a credential
worthy of a Stanford guest pro
fessorship.
Drawing upon the knowledge of four
years of lobbying for minority stu
dents Burnett, a would-be senior at the
University of Maryland, has aided a
group of Stanford students in discover
ing issues that surround minorities in
higher education.
For the 16 minority students en
rolled in the SWOPSI course entitled
Minority Students in Higher Educa
tion, issues such as affirmative action
and federal financing of higher educa
tion hold current concerns, said
Burnett.For some of these students,
the recent federal budget cuts threat
en to interrupt their college education,
said Burnett.
Through lectures, class discussions,
and organized debate, students in the
course have been able to learn both
sides of the issues which affect minor
ity students. Burnett said he has been
especially pleased with the students
who have taken active part in the dis

cussions as well as the in-depth re
search that have gone into the de
bates. "It's really low key," said one
student. "He (Burnett) has the ability
to draw us out in discussion as well as
being a great information source
himself."
Prior to his position as a lobbyist tor
the United States Student Association
(USSA), Burnett worked with juvenile
delinquents in Maryland and had not
considered a career in the political
world. Six months later, atter answer
ing an ad in the newspaper and under
going several interviews, Burnett was
appointed Director of Minority Af
fairs for the National Student Associa
tion which later became the USSA.
Most recently, Burnett represented
minority student concerns for the U.S.
Department of Education.
Since becoming a registered lob
byist in 1977, he has testified before
Congress four times, co-authored and
testified for the truth-in-testing legis
lation of '979, and held a White House
conference on minorities in higher
education. The importance of his posi
tion did not strike him, Burnett said,
until one White House staffer referred

to him as the "National Minority Stu
dent," the sole represenative of the
nation's minority students.
Though Burnett has enjoyed his
position as a student lobbyist, "it is
not just sitting down with legislators
for lunch," he said. "You go to hear
ings all day, do research, and plan
strategy. Every night there's some ac
tivity. You begin to lose a sense of
your personal life."
He accepted the guest professorship
to get away from the "unreal" world
ot Washington and to gain a renewed
sense of commitment, a better under
standing ot thoughts and concerns of
the people he's representing, said
Burnett. Not only has the SWOPSI
course allowed him the contact with
minority students, but has given him
the opportunity to train students in
discussing and lobbying tor minority
issues in higher education.
With 750,00) students affected by

the loan cuts, according to the Ameri
can Council on Education, minority
students will need to use creativity in
seeking out new sources of finance for
college, said Burnett.
As academic degrees and work ex
perience become greater prere
quisites for jobs, the unemployment
rate of minority students will most
likely rise as fewer minority students
will be able to attend universities and
colleges, said Burnett. This may in
turn cause greater frustration among
minority youth, as well as poor whites,
and increase racial tension.
With declining enrollment in the na
tion's colleges and universities,
educational institutions will have an
opportunity to draw upon the vast
number of minority students seeking
higher education, said Burnett.
Nevertheless, Burnett believes the
greatest challenge tacing minority
students in this decade will be getting
into schooland staying there.

colleges, said Burnett. This may in
turn cause greater frustration among
minority youth, as well as poor whites,
and increase racial tension.
With declining enrollment in the na
tion's colleges and universities,
educational institutions will have an
opportunity to draw upon the vast
number of minority students seeking
higher education, said Burnett.
Nevertheless, Burnett believes the
greatest challenge tacing minority
students in this decade will be getting
into schooland staying there.

Andre Burnett is the youngest of three ASSU guest professors here this quarter,
and is now teaching a SWOPSI course called "Minority Issues In Higher Educa
tion." The class discusses such topics as affimative action and the federal role
in higher education.
For 25-year-old Andre Burnett, a
degree in experience from the school
of lite has proven itself a credential
worthy of a Stanford guest pro
fessorship.
Drawing upon the knowledge of four
years of lobbying for minority stu
dents Burnett, a would-be senior at the
University of Maryland, has aided a
group of Stanford students in discover
ing issues that surround minorities in
higher education.
For the 16 minority students en
rolled in the SWOPSI course entitled
Minority Students in Higher Educa
tion, issues such as affirmative action
and federal financing of higher educa
tion hold current concerns, said
Burnett.For some of these students,
the recent federal budget cuts threat
en to interrupt their college education,
said Burnett.
Through lectures, class discussions,
and organized debate, students in the
course have been able to learn both
sides of the issues which affect minor
ity students. Burnett said he has been
especially pleased with the students
who have taken active part in the dis

cussions as well as the in-depth re
search that have gone into the de
bates. "It's really low key," said one
student. "He (Burnett) has the ability
to draw us out in discussion as well as
being a great information source
himself."
Prior to his position as a lobbyist tor
the United States Student Association
(USSA), Burnett worked with juvenile
delinquents in Maryland and had not
considered a career in the political
world. Six months later, atter answer
ing an ad in the newspaper and under
going several interviews, Burnett was
appointed Director of Minority Af
fairs for the National Student Associa
tion which later became the USSA.
Most recently, Burnett represented
minority student concerns for the U.S.
Department of Education.
Since becoming a registered lob
byist in 1977, he has testified before
Congress four times, co-authored and
testified for the truth-in-testing legis
lation of '979, and held a White House
conference on minorities in higher
education. The importance of his posi
tion did not strike him, Burnett said,
until one White House staffer referred

to him as the "National Minority Stu
dent," the sole represenative of the
nation's minority students.
Though Burnett has enjoyed his
position as a student lobbyist, "it is
not just sitting down with legislators
for lunch," he said. "You go to hear
ings all day, do research, and plan
strategy. Every night there's some ac
tivity. You begin to lose a sense of
your personal life."
He accepted the guest professorship
to get away from the "unreal" world
ot Washington and to gain a renewed
sense of commitment, a better under
standing ot thoughts and concerns of
the people he's representing, said
Burnett. Not only has the SWOPSI
course allowed him the contact with
minority students, but has given him
the opportunity to train students in
discussing and lobbying tor minority
issues in higher education.
With 750,00) students affected by

the loan cuts, according to the Ameri
can Council on Education, minority
students will need to use creativity in
seeking out new sources of finance for
college, said Burnett.
As academic degrees and work ex
perience become greater prere
quisites for jobs, the unemployment
rate of minority students will most
likely rise as fewer minority students
will be able to attend universities and
colleges, said Burnett. This may in
turn cause greater frustration among
minority youth, as well as poor whites,
and increase racial tension.
With declining enrollment in the na
tion's colleges and universities,
educational institutions will have an
opportunity to draw upon the vast
number of minority students seeking
higher education, said Burnett.
Nevertheless, Burnett believes the
greatest challenge tacing minority
students in this decade will be getting
into schooland staying there.
