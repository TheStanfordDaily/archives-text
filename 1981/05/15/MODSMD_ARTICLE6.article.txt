# Harvard feminist speaks on women's identity

Women involved in radical feminist theory are
redefining their identities andtheir "space" on
several levels — physically, as a group, mental
ly, and cosmically, according to Emily Cul
pepper, a key activist in the drive for feminist
studies at Harvard.
Undergraduates will be able to major in
feminist studies here beginning next fall.
"I believe there is great power in women de
claring our (sic) own space, in freeing ourselves
from patriarchal society and the rule of men,"
said Culpepper, who is working on her doctoral
thesis. "Woman's space means the space which
is specifically created and controlled by women.
This space and what happens in it is pro-woman;
it is concerned with woman's interests and well
being," she said.
Speaking to about 50 women and a handful of
men in Bishop Auditorium on Monday night, Cul
pepper said that she she views women's space as
"a place where we can be fully ourselves, not one
little room off in a corner, but not part of the
Ivory Tower either." She said that feminist work
cannot be contained within the Ivory Tower, that
it is phallic thinking.
Culpepper said that the first way in which
women build their own space is by reclaiming
their bodies. "Included in that is the right to de
cision-making about abortion and other physical
functions, as well as actually claiming our
muscles, our sinews, our sweat — our
birthright," she said. "We are literally taking
our bodies back. For those opposed to free worn

en it can be very intimidating," Culpepper said.
As an example of the importance of body lan
guage in the academic world, she related an inci
dent that occurred during the initial drive for
feminist studies at Harvard. Culpepper said that
during a meeting with an all-male administrative
board, she and several other women imitated the
men's mannerisms and physical carriage and
that the effect was "quite powerful.'' "The men
became unnerved and did not know why," she
said.
The second way in which Culpepper viewed
women as redefining themselves is through pub
lic gatherings and special groups. She said that
these groups are "a special expression, a frame
of reference" which can make up a vital part of
any woman's life.
"Just as the patriarchy wants our bodies, it
also wants our minds," said Culpepper. "We are
addressing daringly large topics, rather that lim
iting ourselves to specific, confined, male-de
termined disciplines. Our studies are not just in
ter-disciplinary, they are trans-disciplinary,"
maintained Culpepper. She said that the signifi
cance of women thinking solely with women was
not just a change in focus but a new way of think
ing which "breaks vast internal and institutional
taboos "
The fourth way in which Culpepper sees wom
en as redefining their identity is by "literally re
constituting the world." She said that women
should not be just negating the male cultural
myths and images, but actually creating their
own positive images.

Culpepper said in their attempts to redefine
themselves, women immediately encounter the
problem of male boundaries. "We have the
choice whether or not we feel these boundaries as
limits," said Culpepper. "If we let them be limits
we are being trapped into a ghetto-like prison; if
not they can be jumping oft places, or markers,"
she said.
"I don't have a view that we are damaged vic
tims of patriarchy," said Culpepper.
Later, in a somewhat heated question-and-an
swer period, Culpepper said that she doesn't
mean to obstruct the centuries of pain and suffer
ing inflicted on women, but that she doesn't want
women reduced to those terms.
Catherine MacKinnon, a member of the au
dience and a lawyer who works with battered
women, said, "We are lying to women as
feminists when we say thatwe are not damaged,
when we speak of redefining the world and recre
ating it." She went on to say, "Talking about
women as a sub-culture doesn't get at the dam
age in reality now and that divides us from the
most damaged women."
Although Culpepper was responsive to, and en
couraging of, questions from women, her
openness did not extend fully to men. She asked
that the first few minutes of the discussion be
limited to questions from women only, adding
that she thought it was important for the men to
"listen for a change."
