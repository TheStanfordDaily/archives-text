## Israel debates concessions to Syria as Mideast missile crisis heightens 
### Washington Post 
Jerusalem — An intense national debate
has begun in Israel over whether Prime
Minister Menachem Begin should offer con
cessions to Syria to extricate Israel from
the crisis over the antiaircraft missiles in
Lebanon, or risk a full-scale Middle East
war by remaining adamant about national
security objectives.
The Israeli consciousness seems to have
been numbed by the rush of events of the
last two weeks, and the extraordinary
openness in which both sides have maneu
vered themselves into the most ominous and
intractable showdown since the *967 war.

News analysis

Ezer Weizman, the former defense min
ister. likened it to two enemies climbing a
very tall tree and — finding it impossible to
climb down — lock themselves aloft in mor
tal combat until both fall.
Delicate balance
For five years, Israel has managed to
maintain with Syria a delicate balance of
policy objectives in Lebanon, both sides
walking a thin line with an unsigned gen
tlemen's agreement that for the most part
had been studiously adhered to by both
parties.
The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976
to end the civil war that had wracked the
country for two years and quickly received
an Arab League endorsement of this goal.
At the time, Israel agreed to tolerate the in
tervention on the condition that the Syrians
limited themselves to policing the warring
factions.
The terms were spelled out in a letter sent
in March '976 by then-Foreign Minister
Yigael Allon to Henry Kissinger, who had
asked the Israelis to define their vision of a
Syrian "red line" in Lebanon. The letter
was passed by Kissinger to the Syrians, and
it was Israel's understanding that the terms
were tacitly accepted.
Israeli interpretation
According to the Israeli interpretation,
there was to be no interference by Syria in
Israeli ground operations or air strikes
against Palestinian guerrilla positions, par
ticularly those south of theZaharani River;
no Syrian naval operations along the Leba
nese coast; no movement of Syrian troops
south of the Zaharani; no more than one in
fantry brigade south of the Beirut-Damas
cus line; no deployment of Syrian missiles
in Lebanon; no Syrian attempt to close the
Christian port of Jouniyeh, and no im

balance in the Syrian moves against the
Christians and Palestinians.
It is that "red line" agreement to which
Prime Minister Begin refers when he re
peatedly invokes the Israeli demand that
Syria return to the "status quo ante" that
existed until a month ago.
Civil war
It was then that the Syrians, apparently
provoked by Christian attacks on the Bar
douni River bridge in the strategic Bekaa
Valley northeast of Beirut, moved to take
Mount Sanin overlooking the Christian city
of Zahle. Syria regards the Bekaa Valley as
its "soft underbelly," and President Hafez
Assad has made no attempt to disguise his
determination to control the valley.
The Israeli Air Force responded to the
Syrian offensive on April 28 by shooting
down two Syrian helicopters near Mt. Sanin,
and the Syrians the next day deployed the
first three of the fourteen surface-to-air
missile batteries now located inside Leba
non or on the Syrian side of the border. Five
of the batteries are on Lebanese soil, ac
cording to Begin.
Begin reaction
Begin s initial reaction to the Syrian of
fensive against the Christians was to invoke
what he called Israel's "sacred moral com
mitment to prevent the annihilation of the
Christians of Lebanon."
But it became clear in his subsequent ut
terances on the subject that Begin's concern
extended beyond the safety of the Chris
tians, and dwelt largely on Israel's own self
interest and national security.
As he indicated in his speech to par
liament Monday. Begin is acutely aware
that the Christian forces are tieing up a
large part of Syria's 30,000 troops in Leba
non, and that an unencumbered Syrian
Army might soon exert its control over all of
Lebanon.
"Whoever controls the Sanin mountains
and the skies of Lebanon controls all of Leb
anon up to the Israeli border. There is no
doubt about that. And then. Israel will face a
threat to its existence. Then, war will be in
evitable under the worst possible conditions
for Israel," the prime minister declared.
Terrorist deterrent
Another key element in Israel's decision
to risk war with Syria over its actions in cen
tral Lebanon is its heavy dependence on pre
emptive air strikes as a deterrent to ter
rorist attacks launched from Palestinian
bases in Lebanon against civilian targets in
Israel.

Since Weizman announced in 1979 a policy
that Israel would not merely retaliate for
terrorist raids, but would continuously con
duct bombing raids against guerrilla train
ing camps, crossborder infiltration into Is
rael has decreased dramatically.
Without this freedom of movement in
Lebanese skies, Begin argued, the air
force would be ineffective against the guer
rillas, and the Palestinian training camps
would be reestablished on a permanent
basis, leading to increased terrorism in Is
rael.
No compromise
Having committed himself so absolutely
and publicly to keeping these policy goals in
Lebanon, Begin does not appear likely to
compromise on any one of them, particular
ly on Israel's right to conduct preemptive
strikes without the danger of Israeli pilots
being downed by Syrian antiaircraft mis
siles.
Indeed, even the opposition Labor Party,
which has bitterly condemned Begin's han
dling of the crisis, agrees that there is a na
tional consensus in Israel on the necessity of'
removing the missiles.
No consensus
But Labor Party leader Shimon Peres and
other party spokesmen say there is no con
sensus on Israel's obligation to rush to the
defense of Lebanese Christian forces so far
from Israel's border.
The problem for Israel has become one of
having to choose which of its policy objec
tives in Lebanon it should forfeit it it be
comes necessary to make a concession —
and, indeed, if the government is willing to
forfeit any of them.
Peres and his Labor supporters seem
eager to return to the policy of "helping the
Christian forces help themselves," and pos
sibly giving Syria assurances that Israel
will not intervene as it did on April 28 in the
Bekaa Valley. In return, the missiles would
be removed, and Israel would be free to con
duct pre-emptive' strikes against the
Palestinian bases and make aerial photo re
connaissance flights.
The debate, both in public and in private
consultations with U.S. special envoy Philip
Habib, has just begun, and it remains to be
seen whether any way can be found to ease
the crisis.
But in any case, it appears certain that
success cannot be attained unless the '976
"red line" agreement — abrogated by both
Syria and Israel — is restored in one form or
another. ,
