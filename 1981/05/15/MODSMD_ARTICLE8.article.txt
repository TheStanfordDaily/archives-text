# Plan promotes birthrate, Russian marital stability
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — The Russian family, once the
basis of the country's strength, is getting new
attention from the Soviet government and the
Communist Party.
Long ignored while the regime concentrated
on building a modern industrial state, the is
sues of marriage, divorce and raising children
have become subjects for more and more pub
lic discussion and research.
The new five-year plan, the basic law that
directs all activity in the Soviet Union, in
cludes a directive "to conduct an effective de
mographic policy and promote the strengthen
ing of the family as a highly important primary
unit of socialist society. . ."
Divorce and death
Behind the ideological jargon of the plan lies
serious concern over the continuing rise of the
divorce rate, and over recently discovered
rises in infant mortality and in the death rate
for men in their prime.
In addition to issues common to all in
dustrial, uvban societies, the Moscow concern
is especially deep concerning problems pecul
iar to tt Soviet Union — especially to the
western European part of the country.
The low birthrate in particular is trouble
some since it causes a direct confrontation be
tween the rights of women and the needs of the
country to assure itself a future supply of man
power and continued political control by the
three main Slavic groups — the Russians,
Ukrainians and Byelorussians.
The increased concern for improving family
conditions was stimulated partly by the 1979
census, which showed that population in the So
viet Union's European republics was growing
even more slowly than had been predicted.
Demographic implications
Behind these political and economic con
cerns, the Soviet leaders are paying more at
tention to the implications of the new demo
graphic information for the daily life of the
country and lor its future.
Demography itself — the study of vital
statistics — was recognized as a science in the
Soviet Union only in 1965. Much of the best pop
ulation research about the country has been
done in the West, with the U.S. Census Bureau
and its Soviet expert, Murray Feshbach, hold
ing a world reputation.
In a recent study based on Soviet statistics,
the Americans estimated that the infant mor
tality rate rose by one-third to 3.1 deaths for ev
ery : .000 live births between 1971 and 1976.
The rate has been falling steadily in all other
developed countries.
In addition, the death rate for men in their
working years has risen dramatically. They
now die at a rate three times as high as for
women of the same age. Feshbach blamed this
rise on the heavy incidence of alcoholism and
its associated ailments among Russian men.

The subject of infant mortality is especially
sensitive because it had been used previously
in official propaganda to show the success of
the country's free public-health service.
A Moscow health officer admits that 8 per
cent of all babies born in the city are pre
mature and therefore weak
"This may be the result of (earlier) abor
tions, especially of first pregnancies, or it may
stem from the fact that the mother's work is
too arduous," s.he'said.
There were 951,000 divorces in the Soviet
Union, an increase of 30 percent in five years,
an economist reported. That means there is
about one divorce for every 2.7 marriages in
the country. The divorce rate in the European
region is much higher than in the Asian.
In the last two years, the city of Moscow has
organized a chain of counseling centers for
young families, and the University of Moscow
has established the country's first center to
study the problems of raising children.
The main cities have new social centers
where single men and women can meet and
clinics where individuals can get psychological
guidance and information on sex.
Pressure on women
New pressure is being applied on women to
forego their legal right to have abortions, and
to have more children — regardless of marital
status.
At the same time, women are expected to
continue carrying their heavy share of the na
tion's work. Women account for more than 50
percent of the work force and the percentage
will grow, given the present population trend.
Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper,
recently admitted that "facts provide grounds
for saying that most women are overburdened,
which keeps them from harmoniously combin
ing the functions of worker and mother."
The government last month increased the
stipend paid working mothers on maternity
leave and granted unpaid leave to care for chil
dren until they are two years old.
In addition, the government plans to in
crease spending tor food in kindergartens and
nurseries, to expand their capacities and make
them tree tor the children of low-income wom
en.
Mother's allowance
The government resolution, which was also
approved by the party central committee, said
that some time in the present five-year period,
which begdn in January, married mothers will
get a monthly allowance of 50 rubles ($7O) tor
their first child and 100 rubles each for the sec
ond and third. Current benefits go only to moth
ers with four or more children.
Single mothers under this scheme would get
20 rubles ($2B) a month instead of the present
five rubles for each child. The benefits stop
when the children reach age 16.

tween the rights of women and the needs of the
country to assure itself a future supply of man
power and continued political control by the
three main Slavic groups — the Russians,
Ukrainians and Byelorussians.
The increased concern for improving family
conditions was stimulated partly by the 1979
census, which showed that population in the So
viet Union's European republics was growing
even more slowly than had been predicted.
Demographic implications
Behind these political and economic con
cerns, the Soviet leaders are paying more at
tention to the implications of the new demo
graphic information for the daily life of the
country and lor its future.
Demography itself — the study of vital
statistics — was recognized as a science in the
Soviet Union only in 1965. Much of the best pop
ulation research about the country has been
done in the West, with the U.S. Census Bureau
and its Soviet expert, Murray Feshbach, hold
ing a world reputation.
In a recent study based on Soviet statistics,
the Americans estimated that the infant mor
tality rate rose by one-third to 3.1 deaths for ev
ery : .000 live births between 1971 and 1976.
The rate has been falling steadily in all other
developed countries.
In addition, the death rate for men in their
working years has risen dramatically. They
now die at a rate three times as high as for
women of the same age. Feshbach blamed this
rise on the heavy incidence of alcoholism and
its associated ailments among Russian men.

The subject of infant mortality is especially
sensitive because it had been used previously
in official propaganda to show the success of
the country's free public-health service.
A Moscow health officer admits that 8 per
cent of all babies born in the city are pre
mature and therefore weak
"This may be the result of (earlier) abor
tions, especially of first pregnancies, or it may
stem from the fact that the mother's work is
too arduous," s.he'said.
There were 951,000 divorces in the Soviet
Union, an increase of 30 percent in five years,
an economist reported. That means there is
about one divorce for every 2.7 marriages in
the country. The divorce rate in the European
region is much higher than in the Asian.
In the last two years, the city of Moscow has
organized a chain of counseling centers for
young families, and the University of Moscow
has established the country's first center to
study the problems of raising children.
The main cities have new social centers
where single men and women can meet and
clinics where individuals can get psychological
guidance and information on sex.
Pressure on women
New pressure is being applied on women to
forego their legal right to have abortions, and
to have more children — regardless of marital
status.
At the same time, women are expected to
continue carrying their heavy share of the na
tion's work. Women account for more than 50
percent of the work force and the percentage
will grow, given the present population trend.
Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper,
recently admitted that "facts provide grounds
for saying that most women are overburdened,
which keeps them from harmoniously combin
ing the functions of worker and mother."
The government last month increased the
stipend paid working mothers on maternity
leave and granted unpaid leave to care for chil
dren until they are two years old.
In addition, the government plans to in
crease spending tor food in kindergartens and
nurseries, to expand their capacities and make
them tree tor the children of low-income wom
en.
Mother's allowance
The government resolution, which was also
approved by the party central committee, said
that some time in the present five-year period,
which begdn in January, married mothers will
get a monthly allowance of 50 rubles ($7O) tor
their first child and 100 rubles each for the sec
ond and third. Current benefits go only to moth
ers with four or more children.
Single mothers under this scheme would get
20 rubles ($2B) a month instead of the present
five rubles for each child. The benefits stop
when the children reach age 16.
Moscow — The Russian family, once the
basis of the country's strength, is getting new
attention from the Soviet government and the
Communist Party.
Long ignored while the regime concentrated
on building a modern industrial state, the is
sues of marriage, divorce and raising children
have become subjects for more and more pub
lic discussion and research.
The new five-year plan, the basic law that
directs all activity in the Soviet Union, in
cludes a directive "to conduct an effective de
mographic policy and promote the strengthen
ing of the family as a highly important primary
unit of socialist society. . ."
Divorce and death
Behind the ideological jargon of the plan lies
serious concern over the continuing rise of the
divorce rate, and over recently discovered
rises in infant mortality and in the death rate
for men in their prime.
In addition to issues common to all in
dustrial, uvban societies, the Moscow concern
is especially deep concerning problems pecul
iar to tt Soviet Union — especially to the
western European part of the country.
