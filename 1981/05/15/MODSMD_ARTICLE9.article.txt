# Encina Station – revamped and roaring
## 
### Karen Springen 
It's a biz school student's
dream — an eating estab
lishment which- has increased
its revenues 100 percent in one
year — and it's a reality here in
the form of Encina Station.
Until recently, located near
Crothers and Green Library, it
was virtually unknown. But dur
ing the past year the Station has
changed dramatically.
It originated as the dining hall
tor Encina, once a men's dorm,
and until a year ago, was used as
training table for the football
team. Then last June, Servoma
tion, the company that operates
Tresidder, hired manager
Michael Moran to revamp the
Station. According to Moran,
the eatery is a supplement to the
Transition.
The Station is designed to be a
meeting place. A spot "not just
to have food but to have a good
time," Moran said. In contrast,
he described the Coffee House
as "more romantic and laid
back" and the Transition as a
"full catered cafeteria."
Moran expanded the hours,
now 7 a.m. to '.:30 a.m., and
made the Station into a pub.
The Station is open Monday
through Friday. Moran said
weekend business will not sup
port all three — the Coffee
House, the Transition and En
cina. So the Station holds open
parties and special events rath
er than regular business on Sat
urdays. However it is still open
almost as many hours as the
Coffee House.
If your train of thought runs
toward made-to-order food,

beer and wine, pub nights and
live entertainment, you may
perceive another reason for the
increase in business.
According to Moran, the Sta
tion features a pub night with
live music two to three nights
per week Bands that performed

at Encina this year include The
Claude Monet Band, Rooftop
Magic, and Murphy's Lawyers.
"They know we have an au
dience for them," said Moran.
Claude Monet will play at the
Station tonight.
The station attracts about 300
people to events scheduled on
Friday nights, Moran said. "We
had to shut the doors the last
time Rooftop Magic was here."
Unique
Although the Station has the
same director as the Transition
at Tresidder, it has several dif
ferent features.
Besides the Coffee House and
the Faculty Club, it is the only
place on campus with a liquor

license. The Station has a happy
hour from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. each
day during which pitchers of
beer are two for one.
(Budweiser is $2 and Michelob
is $2.50.)
Moran does not see the Sta
tion's relatively isolated loca-

tion as a handicap. "It's a place
to go to forget Stanford — an
oasis," he said.
Unlike the Coffee House, the
atmosphere is conducive to
large gatherings. Seating ca
pacity for dining alone is about
150. Also, there is room enough
for about 350 people to dance.
The Station also boasts a
game room and lounge area. A
giant television is a major draw
ing power, said Moran. He
pointed to a large crowd which
gathers for M*A*S*H each day.
Changes
Several changes are slated
for Encina. Next week, for ex
ample, a quadrophonic sound
system will b'e installed. Moran

also plans to place more tables
outside, and ice cream may be
added to the Station's summer
menu.
The menu is fairly diverse
and reasonably priced All food
is tresh and made to order
Moran said, "We don't start
serving steaks because most
students wouldn't be able to buy
them."
Breakfast is served from 7:30
to 10:30 a.m. Sefections include
omelettes, hash browns and
french toast. Linda Swezey,
day-shift manager, cited the
Station's variety of the egg
McMuffin, the Encina muffin
($1), as a best-seller. Most of
the breakfast customers work in
Encina, she said.
Lunch and dinner entrees in
clude burgers ($1.95 to $2.25),
sandwiches ($1.60), chicken
fillet ($1.85) and pizza ($.65 a
slice). Soup, chili and fries are
also available.
The grill closes at 8:30 when
Encina changes to a pub at
mosphere.
The Station is frequently
criticized for its poor acoustics.
Moran said, however, that
bands continue to return. "Why
do the bands come back and play
tor $100?" he asked..f'Vou don't
hear them complaining about
the sound," he said, "people are
the greatest absorbant."

Michael Moran to revamp the
Station. According to Moran,
the eatery is a supplement to the
Transition.
The Station is designed to be a
meeting place. A spot "not just
to have food but to have a good
time," Moran said. In contrast,
he described the Coffee House
as "more romantic and laid
back" and the Transition as a
"full catered cafeteria."
Moran expanded the hours,
now 7 a.m. to '.:30 a.m., and
made the Station into a pub.
The Station is open Monday
through Friday. Moran said
weekend business will not sup
port all three — the Coffee
House, the Transition and En
cina. So the Station holds open
parties and special events rath
er than regular business on Sat
urdays. However it is still open
almost as many hours as the
Coffee House.
If your train of thought runs
toward made-to-order food,

beer and wine, pub nights and
live entertainment, you may
perceive another reason for the
increase in business.
According to Moran, the Sta
tion features a pub night with
live music two to three nights
per week Bands that performed

at Encina this year include The
Claude Monet Band, Rooftop
Magic, and Murphy's Lawyers.
"They know we have an au
dience for them," said Moran.
Claude Monet will play at the
Station tonight.
The station attracts about 300
people to events scheduled on
Friday nights, Moran said. "We
had to shut the doors the last
time Rooftop Magic was here."
Unique
Although the Station has the
same director as the Transition
at Tresidder, it has several dif
ferent features.
Besides the Coffee House and
the Faculty Club, it is the only
place on campus with a liquor

license. The Station has a happy
hour from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. each
day during which pitchers of
beer are two for one.
(Budweiser is $2 and Michelob
is $2.50.)
Moran does not see the Sta
tion's relatively isolated loca-

tion as a handicap. "It's a place
to go to forget Stanford — an
oasis," he said.
Unlike the Coffee House, the
atmosphere is conducive to
large gatherings. Seating ca
pacity for dining alone is about
150. Also, there is room enough
for about 350 people to dance.
The Station also boasts a
game room and lounge area. A
giant television is a major draw
ing power, said Moran. He
pointed to a large crowd which
gathers for M*A*S*H each day.
Changes
Several changes are slated
for Encina. Next week, for ex
ample, a quadrophonic sound
system will b'e installed. Moran

also plans to place more tables
outside, and ice cream may be
added to the Station's summer
menu.
The menu is fairly diverse
and reasonably priced All food
is tresh and made to order
Moran said, "We don't start
serving steaks because most
students wouldn't be able to buy
them."
Breakfast is served from 7:30
to 10:30 a.m. Sefections include
omelettes, hash browns and
french toast. Linda Swezey,
day-shift manager, cited the
Station's variety of the egg
McMuffin, the Encina muffin
($1), as a best-seller. Most of
the breakfast customers work in
Encina, she said.
Lunch and dinner entrees in
clude burgers ($1.95 to $2.25),
sandwiches ($1.60), chicken
fillet ($1.85) and pizza ($.65 a
slice). Soup, chili and fries are
also available.
The grill closes at 8:30 when
Encina changes to a pub at
mosphere.
The Station is frequently
criticized for its poor acoustics.
Moran said, however, that
bands continue to return. "Why
do the bands come back and play
tor $100?" he asked..f'Vou don't
hear them complaining about
the sound," he said, "people are
the greatest absorbant."

Encina Station, originally the dining hall of a men's dorm, is now "not just a place to have food, but
to have a good time." The Station is open from 7 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., Monday thru Friday, and also fea
tures a pub night with live music two to three nights each week. Tonight The Claude Monet Band will
perform.
It's a biz school student's
dream — an eating estab
lishment which- has increased
its revenues 100 percent in one
year — and it's a reality here in
the form of Encina Station.
Until recently, located near
Crothers and Green Library, it
was virtually unknown. But dur
ing the past year the Station has
changed dramatically.
It originated as the dining hall
tor Encina, once a men's dorm,
and until a year ago, was used as
training table for the football
team. Then last June, Servoma
tion, the company that operates
Tresidder, hired manager
Michael Moran to revamp the
Station. According to Moran,
the eatery is a supplement to the
Transition.
