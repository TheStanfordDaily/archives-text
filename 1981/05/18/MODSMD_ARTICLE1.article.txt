### Ralph Walker 
Seattle — Steve Cottrell, Mike Dot
terer, John Elway and Phil Wilson are
living proof that football and baseball
do mix, and occasionally even propel a
team toward the College World Series.
By sweeping the Washington Huskies
0-8 and '0-6 this weekend in Seattle,
the Cardinals are virtually guaranteed
a regional playoff berth tor the first
time since 1967
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess was the first baseman on that
team, and lettered three years in foot
ball as well.
Marquess will receive a conference
call at about noon today informing him
of the .Cards' fate. Arizona State, the
Southern Division champion, received
an automatic spot in the NCAA Tour
nament, while the Cards finished sec
ond and consequently must wait tor
the call to learn whether or not their
season will be extended.
Cottrell hurled eight solid innings in
the second game en route to his sev
enth triumph in nine decisions. Dot
terel , Wilson and Elway combined for
5 hits and 1 RBIs in leading Stanford
tp victory.
'You guys have too much firepower
tor us," Washington coach Bob
McDonald said to Marquess after the
series. Indeed, comparing the two
teams is like comparing a pistol to a
cannon. The Stanford pitchers threw

heat, while the Washington pitchers
threw breaking balls
Coming into the series. Stanford
had 1 players with four or more home
runs, while the Huskies had only one.
From the outset it was evident that the
Cards would win the confrontation be
tween finesse and power
"They have a lot of guys whose best
shot is a single," said Cottrell
Brian Myers, who collected his fifth
victory in the second game, was even
less impressed.
"I wouldn't want to tell them this to
their face, but they were nothing like
the teams we faced in the league, noth
ing." he said. "Their hitters are just
really weak. That's why 1 wasn't
throwing my slider. 1 could get my
fast ball past most of them."
One of the few Huskies who gave
Myers or anyone else any trouble was
Jeff Best. He came into the series hit
ting 4'7 and went four-for-eight. in
cluding a home run and a double.
"Best is a great player. He scared
us all the time," said Marquess. "It
was (ough getting him out.
Best was overshadowed, however,
by Stanford's aluminum corps, which
clobbered a total of 32 hits.
McDonald described the Cards'
thundering offense (.34'. 82 home
runs, both school records) as "physi
cal," so it was fitting that three of the


Cardinal catcher Bill Worden and
teammate Eric Hardgrave cele
brate after sweeping the Washing
ton Huskies this weekend in Seat
tle. With the two wins, the Cards
virtually clinched a spot in the
NCAA regional playoffs. The final
confirmation should come today.
