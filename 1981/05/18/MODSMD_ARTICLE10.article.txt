# Cities initiate user fees to supplement revenues
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — In California,
the Little League has to pay to
use public softball fields, and ill
or injured persons taken to the
hospital by city ambulance
must pay for the ride. In De
troit, Mayor Coleman Young
wants to charge 50 cents to visit
his city's aquarium, which has
been free during the more than
30 years of its existence. In
Washington, Mayor Marion
Barry's proposal to impose a tee
on those who swim in city pools
or play tennis at city courts has
raised a minor furor.
With their financial condi
tions worsening and voter senti
ment against tax increases
hardening, many cities are
creating new sources ot revenue
by charging a fee or levying a
tax tor city services that were
previously considered "free"' —
that is, they had been paid for by
all the taxpayers out ot a city's
general fund.
"It is really incorporating a
private market principle into
the government sector," said
John Petersen ot the Govern
ment Finance Research Center
here. "If you don't pay, if you

can't pay, you don't get the ser
vice."
A study Peterson helped pre
pare tor the congressional Joint
Economic Committee esti
mated that these charges have
increased by up to 20 percent in
cities around the nation, partic
ularly in the West and North
east. The report predicted that
these user fees would continue
to rise as local governments
contend with the ever-more-dif
ficult problem ot balancing
their books.
Budget shortfalls expected
In their survey of 594 cities —
large-, medium- and small-sized
— the .Joint Economic Commit
tee found that more than half ex
pected this year to have budget
shortfalls, with the likely result
of higher taxes,cutbacks in ser
vices or layoffs of workers. The
survey was conducted before
the Reagan administration's
cuts in federal aid were pro
posed. and committee staff pre
dicted that the situation will
worsen, particularly for the
largest cities that rely most
heavily on federal aid.
The committee report was
critical of the federal govern

ment tor failing to develop a pol
icy to help cities on the brink of
default.
"You have something ap
proaching a crisis, not just for
one or two, but for scores of
cities," said Rep. Henry Reuss
(D-Wis.), committee chairman.
The survey noted that con
tracts for more than half of the
employees in big city police,
tire and sanitation unions expire
this year, and said there would
be added pressure on city
budgets as these workers press
for cost-of-living salary in
creases to counter the effects of
intlation.
Financial pressures
Reuss predicted that the com
bined effect of these financial
pressures would be more strik
ing city workers, more un
collected garbage, more un
repaired streets, more utility
brownouts and more crumbling
bridges.
"In short," he said, "the be
ginning ot America in ruins."
The suffering of cities such as
Boston, New York City, Wash
ington, Detroit and Chicago is
well known, but the commit
tee's survey found that the prob
lems were spread around the
country and not confined to the
industrial North. Urban experts
say older cities in the Sun Belt
such as Atlanta, Birmingham
and New Orleans also are ex
periencing financial problems.
California the most creative
California, now feeling the ef
fects of the tax-restraining
Proposition 13, is perhaps the
most creative in coming up with
new sources of money. The mul
ti-billion dollar state surplus
that had triggered the taxpayer
revolt has been spent, for the
most part, and local govern
ments are pioneering the con
cept of user fees to raise addi
tional revenues.
In the fast-growing city of
Vacaville (pop. 43.Q00) outside
Sacramento, sports leagues are
charged $1000 a year to use
playing fields. An ambulance
ride to the hospital now costs
$50.
The new fees are being
challenged in courts by some
who contend they they are a
backdoor way to get around
Proposition 13's requirement
that no new taxes be imposed
without a two-thirds majority
vote in a municipal referendum.
