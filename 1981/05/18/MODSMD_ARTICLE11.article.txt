# The 						Earthquake Hotline—preparing for the big quake
## 
### Debbie Appel 
When the next earthquake
hits Stanford will you be ready
tor it? Will you have an ade
quate personal water supply 9
Will you know how to admin
ister first aid to the injured stu
dents around you?
If the answer to these ques
tions is no, don't worry, you're
not alone. According to Dave
Hedman, a Stanford senior ma
joring in Economics, most peo
ple will not be prepared in the
event of such a disaster.
To cope with this situation, he
has established an Earthquake
Preparedness Hotline for Stan
ford and the entire Bay Area. By
calling (415) 858-0323, residents
can obtain valuable information
on how to protect their homes
and their families.
Hedman spent months re
searching earthquake prepared
ness with engineers, public of
ficials and other experts. He is
determined to "make it as easy
as possible for people to prepare
for an earthquake." He said that
the survival guide published in
recent phone books does not go
far enough into precautionary
"how-tos." Until the Hotline
was established, he said, there
was no single comprehensive
source to which individuals
could turn for information. The
project is sponsored by SCIRE
and Hedman is receiving 10
units of credit for his work.
The hotline itself will be
manned by students from 8 a.m.
to 4 p.m. on weekdays, with a
24-hour tape recorded back-up.
Concerned homeowners can
also order a basic preparedness
information packet from the
hotline, which includes advice
on property protection and pre
paredness games tor children.
Although the packet is geared to
families, the Hotline can also
provide tips for students. Hed
man believes that are two areas
especially pertinent to the Stan
ford community: water storage
and first aid.
In the event of a severe earth
quake, it is estimated that the
peninsula will lose 95 to 97 per
cent of its water sources. Since
transportation out of the area
will be next to impossible, Hed
man said, "it is essential that
students store water, safely and
purely." There are many mis-

conceptions about how best to
store water and it is important
to know exactly which kind of
containers are the safest, he
said. Students should not use
glass bottles, clear plastic milk
containers, or waterbeds. These

can break easily and do not keep
the water pure.
Hedman believes he has
found a container that is "just
about earthquake proof." This
specially constructed 5 gallon
jug can be obtained through the

Hotline and is large enough to
sustain one person tor about a
week Students can order a con
tainer over the phone, and it will
be delivered right to their resi
dence. Hedman said purex bot
tles made from hard, colored
plastic" are a viable alter
native. However, it would be
necessary to store several of
these and circulate the water
more often.
Besides the Hotline service,
the Earthquake Preparedness

program will be extended to in
clude other services for the
community. A student research
