# Blind freshman a winner on campus and on slopes

Facing challenges has nev
er posed a great problem tor
freshman Connie Conley.
Legally blind since birth,
with only partial vision in her
right eye, Conley recently
won six gold medals in
slalom, giant slalom, down
hill, treestyle, and cross
country events at the tenth
Annual National Handicap
Ski Championships in Winter
Park, Colorado. She has
since been chosen as one of
the five U.S. athletes slated
to go to the 1982 World Dis
abled Ski Championships in
Switzerland next spring.
Conley, a three-time Na
tional Junior Champion,
started skiing with her fami
ly at nine. But it was not until
freshman year in high
school, when the Reno native
began skiing with the Sierra
Daredevils, that she began to
take the sport seriously.
The Daredevils, formed

under the Nevada state voca
tional rehabilitation pro
gram, encourage all kinds of
handicapped skiers to partic
ipate through specialized
teaching. This past April, the
team headed to Winter Park
to compete against other
physically disabled athletes
trom the U.S., Canada, Aus
tralia, and Japan.
During the week-long com
petition, Conley skied down
hill and cross country events
with a sighted guide, Lacy
Wells of Reno. Wells, a
former captain of the Uni
versity of Nevada Ski Team,
followed along at a distance
of five or 0 feet and shouted
directions on when and
where Conley should turn.
"Lacy's been skiing with
me tor a while, so she knows
my reaction time and knows
how to pace me," Connie
said. "But it takes a lot of
concentration. In last year's
downhill I fell, so I was a lit

tle nervous about competing
again this year."
In cross country racing.
Wells helps to keep her on the
track by shouting instruc
tions. "Cross country is so
strenuous I only did it to get
the overall competition and
qualify for Switzerland,"
Conley said.
Conley trained intensively
with Wells tor Winter Park.
During spring break, two
weeks before the competi
tion, she ran and lifted
weights daily, practiced the
course, took timed runs, and
adjusted herself to a new
pair ot skis.
"It all went so fast, in just
a second the whole thing was
over, everything I'd been
training for." Connie said.
"But it really was a great ex
perience. I got to go to Colo
rado. and meet all kinds of
people. I can't wait to go to
Switzerland next year."
