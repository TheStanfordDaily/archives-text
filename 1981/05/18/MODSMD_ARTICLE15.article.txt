# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Breier/Farman/Schlemmer What's wrong with the picture? 
### 
Do you remember sitting in a dentist office
many years ago and thumbing nervously through
a magazine called Highlights'! For many of us,
that magazine provided a few moments of fun dur
ing those hours of terror. One feature in particular
stood out as the highlight of Highlights: a cartoon
puzzle entitled. "What's wrong with this pic
ture?"
Those puzzles were great! Highlights would
provide a drawing such as a quiet, pastoral scene
of grasslands, horses, sheep and a tactical nuclear
missile. The bright kids would circle the nuclear
missile, go on to get great marks in school, and
eventually end up at Stanford.
Well, now that we've all gathered here, why
don't we review the rules of the game and play
again? Randomly distributed about our campus
are scores of scenes where something in the pic
ture is flagrantly wrong. Certain incongruities
are more subtle than others, but all have a touch
of the absurd, the nonsensical, and the completely
misplaced. See how many ot these oddities you
have detected yourself:
1) View of Meyer Library from the Law School
— A wide set ot stairs faces the Law School and
leads majestically up to Meyer: eminently ac
cessible, beautifully sculpturedTand . . . well, uh
... off limits. Circle the stairs in this picture.
21 The "Engineering Corner" — This section of
the Quad pulsates daily with throngs of English,
toreign language, and other humanities students;
but have you ever seen an engineering student
there? Circle the term " Engineering Corner" ev
ery time you see it.
3) Wilbur Parking Lot — Acres of asphalt
searching tor a purpose in life. Never full. Never
half-full. Never even quarter-full. And you get a
ticket it you park there without a permit. Don't
circle anything — just rollerskate in this space.
4) The Elevator in Old Union — A marvel of
modern technology. Ever made a trip to Financial
Aids, Housing, or the AIC? Then you've probably
ridden the infamous Old Union elevator. Three
floors, two doors, and one speed (slow), the lift is
one of the trickiest contraptions on the campus.
Its most useful aspect is that it weeds out the un
aware bound for the admissions office.
5) Bike Ramps — There are countless places on
campus where "what's wrong with this picture"
is a missing bike ramp. You pedal through White
Plaza, pass Tresidder. veer toward the Storey
ruins, and klunk\ Bent rim, jarred bones and the
sudden recollection that the bike ramp is 20
feet to your left. You watch in anguish as a fellow
bike-rider discovers that there is also a tree 20
teet to the left.
6) The Crt-ed Bathroom at deGuerre Courts —
Guys only? Girls only? "Excuse me miss, but I'm
using this shower." This restroom/locker
room fiasco by the raquetball courts makes even
the Old Union Elevator look simple. Enter with
caution. Who's behind curtain number two?

7) The Zapata Dining Room — Stern Food
aside, can anyone explain the mural hanging in
the dining room? Or more importantly, find any
one who likes it? Take your pick at what's wrong
with this picture: the old lady picking her nose or
the one with no face.
8) The Marguerite — Public transportation
saves energy and reduces congestion, right? Ever
seen more than three people on a 27-foot
Marguerite? And what causes more congestion
than four emergency units attending to side
swiped bikers 0
9) Mamanita Trailer Park — A trailer park at
Stanford 0 No matter what they tell you. this place
does not belong. You choice here: circle the ants,
put an X through the ice plants, or color in the wa
ter spots on the ceiling.
0) Bollardmania — You might think the whole
concept of bollards is silly, but have you ever seen
the median strip of Campus Drive in front of
Maples 0 There's a sea ot bollards down there:
bollards next to bollards, bollards behind
bollards, bollards encircling bollards. We think
it's a breeding ground.
11) Class Abbreviations — If you think that
some ot your classes are unintelligible, check out
their abbreviations on your study list. How about
"17 18CEUR" (17th and 18th Century Europe: The
Age ot Enlightenment). Or "Am Romance"
(American Romanticism). We propose "Urban
Problems in Your Society" (UPYOURS) as an un
dergraduate special next year.
Finally, there is a host of night-time mysteries.
Here are but a tew:
'2) Plant Service Horrors — Ever walked cam
pus late at night and found driverless Plant Ser
vices trucks attacking students? Smoke rising
trom campus sewers and street openings?
Sprinklers that water everything but the grass?
Stay tuned for an upcoming horror film. (Filmed
on location.)
'4) The Old Clubhouse — Have you ever heard
that bizarre music emanating from the building
next to Old Union? Who are those people? And
what are they doing? One of the great Stanford
mysteries.
'5) The Oasis — Why do people go there? The
place is a mess, the employees are rude, and they
don't have French tries. Stanford patrons are
what's wrong with this picture.
16) For an all-star finish, how about Alber's
Wall, the Perrier Course (Where does it end?
What does it do?) and dumpster pickups outside
your window at 6 a.m.?
17) It has to end — The biggest thing wrong
with this picture is that it only lasts four years. If
these are the only things wrong then we feel lucky
to be here. We're sure going to miss it.
