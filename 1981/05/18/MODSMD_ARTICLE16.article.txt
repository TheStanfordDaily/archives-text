## Legitimacy should not be conferred on terrorists 
### 
Larry Sheehan (Daily, May
12) should have followed his own
advice and studied Northern
Ireland history carefully before
trying to understand what is
happening there. He would then
have discovered the following
facts:
1. The British are not "in"
Northern Ireland any more than
the Americans are "in" Califor
nia. Economically, culturally
and politically, Northern Ire
land is British, and a substantial
majority of its people like it that
way.
2. The vast majority of Catho
lics in Northern Ireland ac
cepts. as does the government
ot the Republic of Ireland, that
British withdrawl and enforced
"unification" are simply not on
the cards, given the inevitable

resistance of the million-strong
Protestant minority on the is
land.
3. Recent survey evidence
shows that Protestants' pre
ferred constitutional solution
would be a return to the old sys
tem of regional government
which they dominated and
which the British dismantled in
1972; and that Catholics would
prefer a united Ireland,
achieved peacefully by nego
tiation. Neither of these solu
tions is acceptable to the other
side. But a large majority
within both communities view
direct rule from London, as at
present, as a reasonable second
best — higher than precipitate
British withdrawl, forced unifi
cation or an independent
Northern Ireland.

4. Contrary to Sheehan sdelv
ings into the dim past, to long
before the sons of the American
Revolution were butchering
native Americans on the
prairies of the Midwest, the rec
ord of the past 100 years shows
clearly that successive British
governments have been only too
eager to divest themselves of
their truculent province. In
9 2, Navy Secretary Winston
Churchill ordered the fleet to
bombard Belfast if the Protes
tants did not submit to the Lib
eral government's plans tor a
united Ireland.'
Colonialism yes, but hardly as
Sheehan describes it! And as re
cently as 1973 the British were
on the same track, resolving
jointly with the government of
the Republic of Ireland to set up
an all-Ireland council which
could have evolved into a gov
erning body for the whole island
after the British withdrew. This
behavior of the British govern
ment makes far more sense
than the blind lust lor ex
ploitation imputed by Sheehan,
once you know that English,
Welsh and Scottish taxpayers
subsidize public spending in
Northern Ireland to the tune of
some $1.500,i)0) a year.
5. There are no special IRA
prisons. The Maze Prison,
where most ot the Catholic and
Protestant paramilitaries con
victed of terrorist crimes are
kept, is one of the newest and
best equipped prisons in the
world, with skilled workshops,
libraries, gymnasia and tele
vision rooms for the large ma
jority ot prisoners who abide by
the relatively lenient prison
rules.
6. Sheehan accuses the Brit
ish of torture. What the Europe
an Court of Human Rights ac
tually found was that certain in
terrogation procedures used
against' 4 men under the former
regional administration con
stituted "inhuman and degrad
ing treatment." This was in
197the same year that the IRA
killed 48 soldiers. 11 policemen
and [ 15 civilians and set off over
1000 bombs. The London gov
ernment promptly dealt with
these improper interrogation
practices by abolishing the re
gional administration in 972,
six years before the Court's fin
ding The Court also pointed out

that the British had prevented
any repetition of the abuse and
had paid handsome compensa
tion to the 14 men concerned.
7. Trial procedures for ter
rorist offences in the Republic
ot Ireland are much the same as
in Northern Ireland. Suspects
can be detained for seven days
(five days longer than usual)
without charge and there is no
jury because when there were
juries the terrorists intimidated
them. The British find these ex
ceptional measures so dis
tasteful that the British Par
liament must reconsider the
law which authorizes them
twice a year. The vast majority
of MPs of both parties has
always accepted their necessi
ty-
8. The British army does not
stand by and allow Protestant
paramilitaries to rampage
through Catholic ghettoes. The
fact of the matter is that in 968
Catholic leaders urgently re
quested the British Prime Min
ister to send soldiers to protect
Catholic neighborhoods. The
British responded quickly and
positively, and met this request
within a tew days. Elected Cath
olic leaders continue to insist
that the army should stay, even
though they are obviously not
ideal for the job that must be
done.
9. The present dramatic hun
ger strike is a last ditch survival
attempt by the IRA, which has
seen its activities and public
support dwindle over the past 8
years, as some statistics show.
In 1972, there were 1853 bombing
incidents: in 1979, only 565. In
1972, there were 10,628 shooting
incidents: in 1979, only 728. In
'972, there were 321 murders ot
civilians and 146 murders of po
lice men and women and sol

diers: in 1979, the corresponding
figures were 51 and 62. And in
972, the main IRA support
group in the USA collected
$400,000; in 980, less than half
that. The IRA has been trying to
reverse this downward trend for
some years: finally, in the trag
ic and futile deaths of Bobby
Sands ahd Frankie Hughes and
the anonymous soldiers and ci
vilians killed in the ensuing
street violence, they hope they
have found the dramatic sym
bolism they needed.
It follows that the IRA's
claim to political legitimacy is
wholly spurious. It does not
speak for the majority of Catho
lics in Ireland: only a handful
support it. Leading Irish-
American politicians as various
as Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Teddy Kennedy have denounced
them unequivocally. The Irish
government deals with them in
the same way as the British.
They are a small, violent band
of murderers and thieves sup
ported by a larger network of
gullible romantics whose ig
norance is almost as complete
as their lack of judgement.
Sheehan should devote his pre
cise engineer's mind to thinking
exactly how the British and
Irish governments should deal
with the dilemma they jointly
face. Until he can come up with
some practical answers, he
should at least face up to the one
simple lesson that the British
have learned through bitter ex
perience: no democratic gov
ernment can afford to confer le
gitimacy on those who can
pursue political objectives
through terrorism.

in Northern Ireland. Suspects
can be detained for seven days
(five days longer than usual)

8. The British army does not
stand by and allow Protestant
paramilitaries to rampage
through Catholic ghettoes. The
fact of the matter is that in 968
Catholic leaders urgently re
quested the British Prime Min
ister to send soldiers to protect
Catholic neighborhoods. The
British responded quickly and
positively, and met this request
within a tew days. Elected Cath
olic leaders continue to insist
that the army should stay, even
though they are obviously not
ideal for the job that must be
done.
9. The present dramatic hun
ger strike is a last ditch survival
attempt by the IRA, which has
seen its activities and public
support dwindle over the past 8
years, as some statistics show.
In 1972, there were 1853 bombing
incidents: in 1979, only 565. In
1972, there were 10,628 shooting
incidents: in 1979, only 728. In
'972, there were 321 murders ot
civilians and 146 murders of po
lice men and women and sol

diers: in 1979, the corresponding
figures were 51 and 62. And in
972, the main IRA support
group in the USA collected
$400,000; in 980, less than half
that. The IRA has been trying to
reverse this downward trend for
some years: finally, in the trag
ic and futile deaths of Bobby
Sands ahd Frankie Hughes and
the anonymous soldiers and ci
vilians killed in the ensuing
street violence, they hope they
have found the dramatic sym
bolism they needed.
It follows that the IRA's
claim to political legitimacy is
wholly spurious. It does not
speak for the majority of Catho
lics in Ireland: only a handful
support it. Leading Irish-
American politicians as various
as Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Teddy Kennedy have denounced
them unequivocally. The Irish
government deals with them in
the same way as the British.
They are a small, violent band
of murderers and thieves sup
ported by a larger network of
gullible romantics whose ig
norance is almost as complete
as their lack of judgement.
Sheehan should devote his pre
cise engineer's mind to thinking
exactly how the British and
Irish governments should deal
with the dilemma they jointly
face. Until he can come up with
some practical answers, he
should at least face up to the one
simple lesson that the British
have learned through bitter ex
perience: no democratic gov
ernment can afford to confer le
gitimacy on those who can
pursue political objectives
through terrorism.
(Hill Smith is a graduate stu
dent in political scicnce and
citizen of Northern Ireland.)
Larry Sheehan (Daily, May
12) should have followed his own
advice and studied Northern
Ireland history carefully before
trying to understand what is
happening there. He would then
have discovered the following
facts:
1. The British are not "in"
Northern Ireland any more than
the Americans are "in" Califor
nia. Economically, culturally
and politically, Northern Ire
land is British, and a substantial
majority of its people like it that
way.
2. The vast majority of Catho
lics in Northern Ireland ac
cepts. as does the government
ot the Republic of Ireland, that
British withdrawl and enforced
"unification" are simply not on
the cards, given the inevitable

resistance of the million-strong
Protestant minority on the is
land.
3. Recent survey evidence
shows that Protestants' pre
ferred constitutional solution
would be a return to the old sys
tem of regional government
which they dominated and
which the British dismantled in
1972; and that Catholics would
prefer a united Ireland,
achieved peacefully by nego
tiation. Neither of these solu
tions is acceptable to the other
side. But a large majority
within both communities view
direct rule from London, as at
present, as a reasonable second
best — higher than precipitate
British withdrawl, forced unifi
cation or an independent
Northern Ireland.

4. Contrary to Sheehan sdelv
ings into the dim past, to long
before the sons of the American
Revolution were butchering
native Americans on the
prairies of the Midwest, the rec
ord of the past 100 years shows
clearly that successive British
governments have been only too
eager to divest themselves of
their truculent province. In
9 2, Navy Secretary Winston
Churchill ordered the fleet to
bombard Belfast if the Protes
tants did not submit to the Lib
eral government's plans tor a
united Ireland.'
Colonialism yes, but hardly as
Sheehan describes it! And as re
cently as 1973 the British were
on the same track, resolving
jointly with the government of
the Republic of Ireland to set up
an all-Ireland council which
could have evolved into a gov
erning body for the whole island
after the British withdrew. This
behavior of the British govern
ment makes far more sense
than the blind lust lor ex
ploitation imputed by Sheehan,
once you know that English,
Welsh and Scottish taxpayers
subsidize public spending in
Northern Ireland to the tune of
some $1.500,i)0) a year.
5. There are no special IRA
prisons. The Maze Prison,
where most ot the Catholic and
Protestant paramilitaries con
victed of terrorist crimes are
kept, is one of the newest and
best equipped prisons in the
world, with skilled workshops,
libraries, gymnasia and tele
vision rooms for the large ma
jority ot prisoners who abide by
the relatively lenient prison
rules.
6. Sheehan accuses the Brit
ish of torture. What the Europe
an Court of Human Rights ac
tually found was that certain in
terrogation procedures used
against' 4 men under the former
regional administration con
stituted "inhuman and degrad
ing treatment." This was in
197the same year that the IRA
killed 48 soldiers. 11 policemen
and [ 15 civilians and set off over
1000 bombs. The London gov
ernment promptly dealt with
these improper interrogation
practices by abolishing the re
gional administration in 972,
six years before the Court's fin
ding The Court also pointed out

that the British had prevented
any repetition of the abuse and
