## Watt's appointment incomprehensible 
### 
Although I disagree with
much of Bill Wray's recent col
umn, "Lett follows self-right
eous course" (Daily, April 24),
I've decided to confront his
stance that environmental con
cerns should be put aside.
It is easy to see why the new
administration is challenged re
garding its lack of concern for
the environment. It is almost in
comprehensible that James
Watt was appointed as secre
tary of the interior, a position
established to provide balanced
use of the public's land. Many
ecologists would be more leni
ent toward the administration if
they were convinced that there
was an attempt at balance.
Watt's record displays extreme
sympathies with corporate
("private") interests, and a to
tal distrust of environmental
"reactionaries." His former
position was president of the
Mountain States Legal Founda
tion (MSLF), which was sup
ported by various oil, gas, coal,
mining and timber companies.
MSLF showed a consistent pro
business and anti-environmen
tal attitude in its case§. And af
ter only a tew months in his posi
tion as secretary, the Sierra

Club has launched a national
petition campaign to replace
Watt.
Wray's argument did little to
convince me that the oil. mining
and lumber corporations are not
even considering the potential
short term economic gains
available to them within Watt's
jurisdiction; that they are act
ing completely in the interest ot
the ever thirsting American
public, which has delivered an
unquestionable mandate to this
administration.
I must strongly disagree that
it is pointless to protest the use
of traditional means of energy
production. Nuclear waste dis
posal problems, acid rain.
CO(2) buildup, and the flooding
ot eco-systems must not be al
lowed to continue unnoticed.
Must we allow these problems
to continue unchallenged simply
because the U.S. has invested
many dollars in the present sys
tem? You must realize that
these and similar problems do
not obey national boundaries,
and that problems are created
on a global scale. Also, invest
ments can be damaged by a£id
rain as well as lakes and trees,
and a chairman of the board is

just as susceptible to radiation
posioning as we are.
Furthermore, the tangible
strides recently made in the de
velopment of renewable energy
sources and conservation pro
grams (the "solar bank" and
"conservation bank," federal
homeowner loan plans) are
being eliminated before their
birth because they somehow in
terfere with the free market
system. Federally funded re
search is also scheduled for the
chopping block. The soft energy
path (a positive approach to the
energy problem) and various
conservation efforts are being
squelched through the budget
system. Yet, this adminis
tration insists on financially

supporting nuclear energy de
velopment, which is rapidly los
ing tavor among the tree en
terprise system. 1 find that iron
ic and hypocritical.
Finally. I can't help but com
ment on Wrav's phrase, "No one
wants to alter the land
scape. . ." As a civil engineer,
he must have seen at least one
person that is anxious to build a
dam simply because an unhar
nessed river exists. If you
haven't, contact the Bureau of
Reclamation. They have com
pleted plans that would put
dams in the Grand Canyon.
