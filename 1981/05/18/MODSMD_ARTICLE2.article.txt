Many students here have been questioning the benefits
ot ethnic theme houses recently, especially in Ujamaa, the
black thetae house, and Zapata, the Chicano theme house.

registered complaints with the Office of Residential
Education.

Other causes, he added, include cultural differences be
tween the minority and non-minority students and the ra
cism that students carry from society into a theme house.
"It certainly is a highly charged situation," Lyons said.

An ethnic theme house requires a commitment from a
resident to participate in the house's programs, and this
oiten means seeing dorm funds directed towards com
munity or other non-dorm functions. This bothers many
residents, but Lyons doesn't feel that students who are not
committed to the theme should complain.
"Nobody has to accept an assignment. To some stu
dents, it's choosing between bad alternatives and very bad
alternatives," Lyons said. If students choose to live in
theme houses, Lyons added, they should be ready to partic
ipate in the house's activities.

dential education, sees value in the present theme houses.
"Theme houses are one of the primary places where I
can say residential education is happening. There is a high
level of programming and a natural interaction among
students from different backgrounds," Supton said.
Sup ton echoed Lyons' feelings about students that are
assigned to ethnic theme houses but did not desire them.
"People are free to accept or refuse an assignment, and
an ethnic theme house may be a new experience," she

said. "Even if a student did not list a cross-cultural hous
ing choice on his draw card, once he or she accepts this
choice, he or she has the responsibility to try and influence
the house's programs by working with the residence staff,
and make an effort to shape its activities."
Many Stanford students don't want to be bothered with
racial tension, but Supton questions this attitude.
"College should not be a protected time in one's life. It
should be a time of probing and questioning everything
i one's learned," she said. "One of the functions of the
bouses is being achieved if the students living there are en-
Couruged to confront stereotypical attitudes» about race. "
Based on student interviews, members of minority
groups generally seem more pleased with the theme house
programs than non-members are. Many non-members of
minority groups agree that there is a large amount of ra
cial tension in these houses, but some disagree with the
benefits residents receive from this tension.
One non-minority freshman living in Ujamaa said,
"There's a lot ot tension here, but it's not all bad. I don't
mind coping with it, because it's been a learning ex

perience.
Not everyone reacts this favorably to ethnic theme
houses. One student commented, "It's just one more ten
sion I have to worry about, and I don't have the time to deal
with it."
A non-minority Zapata resident stated, "I think a lot ot
it has to do with the fact that it's a cultural theme house,
and not everyone is committed to that culture and its pro
grams."
Many students with poor draw numbers end up in Zapata
and Ujamaa. and most students the Jimlv talked to cited
this as a major cause of unhappiness in the houses.
"Many people placed here as freshmen, or because of
bad draw numbers, are not dedicated to the theme, and
this hurts the house. "
The Office of Residential Education's position that no
one has to take a housing assignment doesn't refer to
freshmen, since they must live on campus wherever
they're assigned.

dents, it's choosing between bad alternatives and very bad
alternatives," Lyons said. If students choose to live in
theme houses, Lyons added, they should be ready to partic
ipate in the house's activities.
/Miec ouplun, aasiatuut dean of student affairs for resl
dential education, sees value in the present theme houses.
"Theme houses are one of the primary places where I
can say residential education is happening. There is a high
level of programming and a natural interaction among
students from different backgrounds," Supton said.
Sup ton echoed Lyons' feelings about students that are
assigned to ethnic theme houses but did not desire them.
"People are free to accept or refuse an assignment, and
an ethnic theme house may be a new experience," she

said. "Even if a student did not list a cross-cultural hous
ing choice on his draw card, once he or she accepts this
choice, he or she has the responsibility to try and influence
the house's programs by working with the residence staff,
and make an effort to shape its activities."
Many Stanford students don't want to be bothered with
racial tension, but Supton questions this attitude.
"College should not be a protected time in one's life. It
should be a time of probing and questioning everything
i one's learned," she said. "One of the functions of the
bouses is being achieved if the students living there are en-
Couruged to confront stereotypical attitudes» about race. "
Based on student interviews, members of minority
groups generally seem more pleased with the theme house
programs than non-members are. Many non-members of
minority groups agree that there is a large amount of ra
cial tension in these houses, but some disagree with the
benefits residents receive from this tension.
One non-minority freshman living in Ujamaa said,
"There's a lot ot tension here, but it's not all bad. I don't
mind coping with it, because it's been a learning ex

perience.
Not everyone reacts this favorably to ethnic theme
houses. One student commented, "It's just one more ten
sion I have to worry about, and I don't have the time to deal
with it."
A non-minority Zapata resident stated, "I think a lot ot
it has to do with the fact that it's a cultural theme house,
and not everyone is committed to that culture and its pro
grams."
Many students with poor draw numbers end up in Zapata
and Ujamaa. and most students the Jimlv talked to cited
this as a major cause of unhappiness in the houses.
"Many people placed here as freshmen, or because of
bad draw numbers, are not dedicated to the theme, and
this hurts the house. "
The Office of Residential Education's position that no
one has to take a housing assignment doesn't refer to
freshmen, since they must live on campus wherever
they're assigned.
