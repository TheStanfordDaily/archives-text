Study language
There seems to be no reason
to question the long-standing
and widely-held assumption
that the study of a foreign lan
guage is a crucially valuable
variant on the study of a native
language — referring here par
ticularly to the structured
aspects of it in grammar, com
position, literature; both stud
ies being ideal exercises in the
evolution from logical (or
mathematical) modes of know
ing toward more imaginative,
flexible and concrete modes of
knowing. The development of
agility in the conscious play
amid these "relations of rela
tions" is as basic to intellectual
man as walking (or dancing) is
to physical man.
Historically, we may recall
that Descartes was interested in
the wedding of philosophy to
speech — a Universal Grammar
— as well as the fusion of
mathematics and physical
phenomena. In our day, if we do
not provide the best of language
education to our students (at the
very least all who do not take the
math option), preferably at the
high school level, but tailing
that, remedially here, we will
be in effect "castrating" them
ot their intellectual future. For
all of the exciting new develop
ments in twentieth century
thought depend on the two sym
bolic systems, whether
cybernetics, structuralism in
anthropology, the new
criticism, etc.
The argument has been ad
vanced that other symbolic sys
tems such as Music can serve
this education function. No
doubt this is so, providing the
discipline is presented for that
basic purpose. But until it has
been convincingly demon
strated that each of the pro
posed substitute systems can in
tact serve the same absolutely
fundamental educative function
as language or math, it would be
sheer folly to ditch these re
liable systems which have
served our whole tradition and
produced the Descartes,
Hegels, Bergsons, and Russells.
Practically speaking, it is im
possible to harness, organize
and control all the various dis
ciplines for this root purpose —
Music, Sociology, etc. all spon
taneously function better at
"higher" levels of the academic
tree.
We have a major reason to
maintain these primary sys
tems in order precisely to keep
up a continuity with our whole
cultural past. Just as important
ly, there has to be a continuity in
space as well as time, a harmo
nizing central system (or set of
systems) without which all hu
man reality becomes mere
chaos. Babel. The native lan
guage comes obvioirsly first in
this sense, followed closely by
the foreign language which
helps ideally to dialectically

raise the knowledge of the
native language to the ad
vanced, synthetic or universal
consciousness of language.
If an adolescent studies math,
or musical theory, or the like, in
addition to his own language, we
cannot say that he is altogether
failing in this vital area. But
supposing he doesn't pick up
such a subject; or supposing he
makes no connection between
that subject and his knowledge
ot his own language and
thought-system; or supposing
the subject is not taught at a
basic theoretical level? Be
cause ot all these possible
loopholes, our academic tore
bears showed sound instincts in
providing foreign language
study as a prime insurance of
solidity here.

Michael Weiss' conclusion to
his recent column (Daily, Apr.
: 4) on the marketability of "the
Stanford concept" — "with im
agination you can accomplish
anything" — seems to con
tradict his preceding statement
that the Stanford Doll, just like
"the real Stanford woman,"
ceases to function in the
bedroom. But perhaps Weiss'
imagination ceases to function
in that area as well .. .
Moreover, if one can imagine
marketing Stern food profit
ably, one surely ought not over
look the tremendous sales
potential of the Stanford Doll's
natural counterpart, the Stan
ford Boy Doll. The same argu
ment ought to apply both to
Stern food, "stom
achwrenching" as it really is,
and to Stanford men, . . . (you
fill in the appropriate adjective)
as they are': "profits from the
initial sales — those sales that
occur before the consumer has
tested the product — will be
enormous."
One does wonder, however,
whether Mattel, Inc. has not al
ready cornered the market on
Stanford-type dolls (as Weiss
envisions them) with Ken and
Barbie.

all of the exciting new develop
ments in twentieth century
thought depend on the two sym
bolic systems, whether
cybernetics, structuralism in
anthropology, the new
criticism, etc.
The argument has been ad
vanced that other symbolic sys
tems such as Music can serve
this education function. No
doubt this is so, providing the
discipline is presented for that
basic purpose. But until it has
been convincingly demon
strated that each of the pro
posed substitute systems can in

fundamental educative function
as language or math, it would be
sheer folly to ditch these re
liable systems which have
served our whole tradition and
produced the Descartes,
Hegels, Bergsons, and Russells.
Practically speaking, it is im
possible to harness, organize

ciplines for this root purpose —
Music, Sociology, etc. all spon

"higher" levels of the academic

We have a major reason to
maintain these primary sys
tems in order precisely to keep
up a continuity with our whole
cultural past. Just as important

space as well as time, a harmo

systems) without which all hu
man reality becomes mere
chaos. Babel. The native lan
guage comes obvioirsly first in
this sense, followed closely by
the foreign language which
helps ideally to dialectically

raise the knowledge of the
native language to the ad

consciousness of language.
If an adolescent studies math,
or musical theory, or the like, in
addition to his own language, we
cannot say that he is altogether
failing in this vital area. But
supposing he doesn't pick up
such a subject; or supposing he
makes no connection between
that subject and his knowledge
ot his own language and
thought-system; or supposing
the subject is not taught at a
basic theoretical level? Be
cause ot all these possible
loopholes, our academic tore
bears showed sound instincts in
providing foreign language
study as a prime insurance of
solidity here.

Michael Weiss' conclusion to
his recent column (Daily, Apr.
: 4) on the marketability of "the
Stanford concept" — "with im
agination you can accomplish
anything" — seems to con
tradict his preceding statement
that the Stanford Doll, just like
"the real Stanford woman,"
ceases to function in the
bedroom. But perhaps Weiss'
imagination ceases to function
in that area as well .. .
Moreover, if one can imagine
marketing Stern food profit
ably, one surely ought not over
look the tremendous sales
potential of the Stanford Doll's
natural counterpart, the Stan
ford Boy Doll. The same argu
ment ought to apply both to
Stern food, "stom
achwrenching" as it really is,
and to Stanford men, . . . (you
fill in the appropriate adjective)
as they are': "profits from the
initial sales — those sales that
occur before the consumer has
tested the product — will be
enormous."
One does wonder, however,
whether Mattel, Inc. has not al
ready cornered the market on
Stanford-type dolls (as Weiss
envisions them) with Ken and
Barbie.

There seems to be no reason
to question the long-standing
and widely-held assumption
that the study of a foreign lan
guage is a crucially valuable
variant on the study of a native
language — referring here par
ticularly to the structured
aspects of it in grammar, com
position, literature; both stud
ies being ideal exercises in the
evolution from logical (or
mathematical) modes of know
ing toward more imaginative,
flexible and concrete modes of
knowing. The development of
agility in the conscious play
amid these "relations of rela
tions" is as basic to intellectual
man as walking (or dancing) is
to physical man.
Historically, we may recall
that Descartes was interested in
the wedding of philosophy to
speech — a Universal Grammar
— as well as the fusion of
mathematics and physical
phenomena. In our day, if we do
not provide the best of language
education to our students (at the
very least all who do not take the
math option), preferably at the
high school level, but tailing
that, remedially here, we will
be in effect "castrating" them
ot their intellectual future. For
