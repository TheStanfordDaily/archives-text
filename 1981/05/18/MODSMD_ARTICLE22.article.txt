# Defending champs play Georgia today
## Cards advance to semi-finals 
### Ivan Maisel 
Athens, Ga. — Having Geor
gia host the NCAA Tennis
Championships has always been
an intercollegiate tribute to the
Almighty Dollar. Because
Georgia coach Dan Magill can
till the 3500 seats of Henry Feild
Stadium for eight days every
May, the NCAA has held the
tournament here tor five con
secutive years.
The parent body surely didn't
hold the tournament here be
cause of Georgia's tennis prow
ess. Sure, they were good in the
Southeastern Conference, but
good enough to play with the
USCs, the Pepperdines, the
Stanfords?
Well, that ol' boy Magill, who
has some sportcoats that would
make even Lindsey Nelson
blush, ain't exactly been
whistlin' Dixie. His Bulldogs
beat USC 6-3 during the regular
season. After mildly surprising
the fans here Saturday with a 7-2
upset of seeded Houston, they
nearly set off a riot yesterday
with a 7-2 upset of third-seeded
Pepperdine.
And now, at 10 a.m. today,
they get a shot at the second
seeded defending champion
Stanford Cardinals. In the 2
p.m. semifinals, top—seeded
UCLA meets fourth-seeded
USC. The Bruins survived a late
rush by Arkansas to win 5-4. The
Trojans were tied with Clemson
atter the singles, but swept the
doubles tor a 6-3 victory.
"Stanford will be favored nat
urally," Magill said. "They'll
be favored at every spot. They
may be too tough tor us."
"You don't really believe
that, do you?" a reporter asked.
"We'll see," Magill said imp
ishly. "Hardly anybody beats
Stanford."
Nobody has beaten the Cards
yet. Stanford advanced to the
semifinals with two sparkling
performances this weekend.
The Cards outclassed first
round opponent Utah 9-0, losing
only two sets along the way.
Yesterday they met Cal tor
the third time this year, and
beat them for same. The 5-4
final score is misleading, for
Stanford won five of six singles

matches and then packed up its
rackets. Cal won the doubles by
default.
Stanford coach Dick Gould's
decision not to play was a pre
cautionary measure "We have
a long week of tennis ahead. We
either play a little extra doubles
or we'll be tresher tomorrow.
We gave a good solid doubles
performance yesterday," Gould
said. "I'm gambling that fresh
ness is more important than the
extra work."
Jim Gurfein, who,'along with
Scott Davis and Scott Bond
urant, has tailed to lose a set
here, pointed out another bene
fit from sitting out the doubles.
"Cal could come right out hit
ting away — they already lost,"
Gurtein said. "We lose a couple
of doubles, and we might lose
our confidence."
Stanford's confidence — or
anything else — has yet to be
tested. The only thing tested
against Utah was the team's
ability to a) wake up early and
b) play in weather more suited
to the Bay Area than the Deep
South.
The match began at 8 a.m.
before approximately 50 spec
tators, or about 3250 less than
would be there by the 1 p.m.
start of the Georgia-Houston
match. The players warmed up
while dodging portable heaters
being pushed across the courts
to evaporate the night's dew.
Once play began, it looked as
if No. 1 Tim Mayotte might nev
er warm up. Utah's Jeff Rob
bins, with a cannon disguised as
a forehand, jumped out to a 5-
lead. At one point Mayotte
served to his opponent's
backhand only to watch in
credulously as Robbins ran
nearly onto the next court to
smash a forehand winner down
the line.
Mayotte looked at Davis and
Mike Falberg, who were in the
stands waiting to begin their
matches, and smiled.
"If you get uptight about him
smashing winners, it can only
work against you. If he keeps
doing that, let him win," May
otte said. "But it's so rarely
anyone can do that for two sets,
except the great professionals."

Mayotte began to strike back
with a vengeance, winning 14 ot
the next 15 games to move
ahead 5-0 in the third set. After a
three-game lapse, he closed out
the match 4-6, 6-0, 6-3.
It was Mayotte who was
closed out yesterday, losing for
the third time in three tries this
year to Cal's Mike Bauer. May
otte said the 6-3, 6-4 loss was the
"best I've played against him.
He plays the style of game I
have trouble with. He's one of
those tough people you have to
play. There are certain people
you have to face that you would
rather not face. He's my per
son."
None of the other Cards ran
into apy such person as all five
went undefeated in singles play.
Jeff Arons continued to rebound
from an early- and mid-season
slump. He has now won seven of
his last nine matches, shrugging
oft both a slow start and a slight
shoulder strain to beat Utah's
Ed Heath and Cal's Miles Walk
er.
Of course, Arons' winning
ways don't quite match up to
those ot No. 2 Davis, who
lengthened his dual-match un
beaten streak to 5 over the
weekend. Though he has lost
only 12 games here, Davis
seemed tentative. He said it is
his normal early-tournament
jitters.
"I have a habit of doing this in
big tournaments. I come out and
try to pace myself and I always
struggle in the first couple of
rounds," Davis said after Satur
day's win over John Tsumas of
Utah.
Davis seemed the same
against Cal's Mark Wooldridge,
even falling behind a service
break in the first set. He im
mediately struck back with two
breaks of his own to win the set
6-3, then added one more late in
the second set to win the match.
"I can't keep getting these
slow starts and getting away
with it," Davis said. "It's prob
ably the fact that I've played so
many good matches. It's hard to
get up every time. But," he was
quick to add, "I can assure you I
will have no problem getting up
tor the semis of the NCAAs."

The same can be said for his
opponents. "I don t know how
good their guys are," Davis
said, "but they are all damned
tough. The fact of this crowd
makes them better "
Georgia's Gerald Kleis, who
along with No. 3 doubles partner
Tom Foster clinched the Bull
dogs' victory yesterday, agreed
with Davis.
"We're gonna go all the way,
and we need as many students
out here as possible," Kleis
said. "I think we can do it."
Added Foster "We're just
six no-names, but we're gonna
give them all they can handle. "
And he ain't just whistlin'
Dixie.
