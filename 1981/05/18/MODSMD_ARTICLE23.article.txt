# Burgin wins Regionals
## 
### Steve Odell 
Stanford tennis player Elise Burgin is not
one that you would usually term "laid back."
Burgin, a freshman to the Farm via Baltimore,
appears high-strung, lively, and packed full of
energy. She used the very words to describe
herself, however, citing her relaxed attitude as
the key to her singles championship in the Re
gion VIII women's collegiate tennis tour
nament, held last Thursday through Sunday at
San Jose State University
Burgin, not one of the top eight seeds head
ing into the tourney, won the title by winning
six matches in four days. Playing loose, "con
centrating on one match at a time", and "nev
er putting pressure on myself that I had to win
it," Burgin produced a list of victims that
reads like a Who'.s Who in women's collegiate
tennis' on her way to the crown Now on a sev
en-match winning streak, the rookie southpaw
took apart No. 3 seed and No. 1 Trojan Anna
Maria Fernandez on Sunday to net the title.
Like a piece of (' orningware. Burgin was un
breakable in the final match, and she broke her
opponent twice, once in each set to win by a
score of 6-4, 6-4.
But the path to the finals was tar from a yel
low brick road. After two fairly easy opening
day victories. Burgin faced (and beat) USC's
Kelly Henry, the No. 4 seed; UCLA's No. 2 and
eighth-seeded Kathy O'Brien; teammate and
No. Cardinal, Alycia Moulton, who was
seeded second; before even getting a shot at
Fernandez.
"My best match was against Kelly Henry,"
explained Burgin, obviously thrilled with the
results of the weekend. "Beating her boosted
my confidence for the rest of the tournament
It was my toughest match."
Another tough match for Burgin, psy
chologically, as well as physically, was against

teammate Moulton. "It was different playing
her." admitted Burgin. "But I to play
it like it was any other match, and I think I
did."
Stanford coach Frank Brennan was under
standably very pleased with his rookie "The
story of the day was Elise Burgin," he said
"She's just playing great tennis."
But the Cardinal mentor was happy with the
results his entire team turned in as well "I'm
extremely pleased," Brennan said of the tour
nament. "I'm very happy with everything
We're coming along very nicely. Not only did
we play well, but the other teams were looking
tired V\ith our shorter season, we're going to
still be tresh for Nationals."
Gayle Chan also had a big win in the opening
round tor the Cards, upsetting UCLA's Karen
Dewis 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. marking the first time in
tour tries that a Cardinal player has beaten the
Bruin this year. Chan got her tirst blemish in
her previously undefeated 7-0 record the next
round, however, when teammate Caryn
Copeland beat her in straight sets.
