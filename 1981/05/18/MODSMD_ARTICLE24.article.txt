Stanford battled UC-Berkeley for the
Northern California Lacrosse Cham
pionship Saturday, and relinquished the
Sadtler-Miller Trophy for the first time in
three years, losing 14-10.
The Cardinals were forced to play without
league-leading scorer Kirk Phelps, who was
out with a knee injury, as a disorganized
Squad spotted the Bears eight goals in the
first quarter, and was never able to catch
up.
Stanford defeated Cal two years ago, 8-3,
and went on to beat UC-Santa Barbara for
the California Championship. The contest
was even closer last year, as the Cards won
in triple overtime, 12-11.
Stanford attack Chris Romer scored
twice in the first 40 seconds of the fourth
quarter to close the eight goal gap after

three quarters to 3-9. Six separate man
down penalties paralyzed the Cards for over
seven crucial minutes, however.
The offense was unable to gain control,
and Tom Riker scored his seventh goal of
the 'game to ice it for Cal. Romer scored his
fifth goal of the afternoon moments later,
but time ran out as Cal held on.
After showing some signs of life in the
second period, the Cards suffered a relapse
in the third. They had held the Bears to only
three goals before the half and scored five
goals to Cal's three, but in the third period
Cal outshot them 12-5, and scored two more
goals to build a 13-7 lead.
The Cards simply could not overcome the
first period disaster, which was a night
mare of Cal goals, with little retaliation
from Stanford. "Our defense was uncharac
teristically sloppy early in the game, and

our offense was erratic." said head coach
Sam Stadtler. who closed out an eight year
stint on the Farm with a 91-35 record
The Bears jumped to an early first quar
ter 2-0 lead on goals by Riker, and Paul Sen
ior. The two small, quick attackmen vir
tually beat Stanford by themselves, combin
ing for 12 goals and two assists.
Romer. who was moved to attack to re
place Phelps, scored the first goal for the
Cardinals on an unassisted drive with 5:20
remaining in the period. Cal came back with
three point-blank shots that went for goals
before Dickie Taylor bounced a shot past
Cal goalie Mike Eisenstadt. Senior and
Riker tallied three more goals between
them, and Cal led at the end of the first peri
od. 8-2.
The game dropped Stanford's record to
11-5 overall.
