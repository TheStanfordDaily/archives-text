Pope recovering, forgives assailant
Vatican City— Pope John Paul II rose from his hospital
bed and celebrated Mass yesterday for the first time since
he was wounded, and doctors said that barring setbacks he
will fully recover from the bullet wounds of a would-be as
sassin four days ago,
Dr. Emilio Tresalt, chief of the medical staff at the
pope's hospital, said in reply to questions the pope will
fully recover unless there are setbacks. He said the pope
will soon be moved out of the intensive care ward — per
haps on his 6'st birthday today — and should be able to
leave the hospital "in about a month."
The pope sat in a chair for about a half hour, a medical
bulletin said, after saying in a tape-recorded Mass that he
forgives "that brother of ours who shot me."
The papal message, in a soft but unfaltering voice, was
played to a throng in St. Peter's Square. It brought relief
and tears to listeners, who were hearing the pope tor the
first time since he was wounded Wednesday.
"With deep emotion, I thank you for your prayers and I
bless you all," the pope said in a message which was rec
orded at Rome's Gemelli Policlinico Hospital and played
over a loudspeaker a short time later for the crowd in St.
Peter's Square.
"United with Christ, priest and victim. I offer my suf
ferings for the church and the world." he said. The words,
in Italian, were carried on Vatican Radio and were broad
cast in his native Poland.
The man charged with shooting the pope. Mehmet Ali
Agca, 23, remained under heavy guard in Rome police
headquarters.
John Paul passed a restful night and was taken off
painkillers, his physicians said. His intestines, damaged in
at least 2 places, were reported showing signs of return
ing to normal.
Israeli-Syrian crisis worsens
Beirut, Lebanon— Syria moved stockpiles of Soviet
made SAM-6 missiles into east Lebanon yesterday, and Is
raeli jets screamed over Beirut after a second day of artil
lery duels here and in the eastern town of Zahle. U.S. envoy
Philip Habib appeared to buy more time for diplomatic ef
forts to solve the Israeli-Syrian missile crisis.
Associated Press reporter Alex Efty reported from the
Syrian-controlled Lebanese town of Chtaura in the Bekaa
Valley that he saw several flatbed transport trucks, each
carrying two or three of the 8-foot SAM-6 missiles, move
in from the Syrian border on the main Beirut-Damascus
highway and on side roads.
Habib met with royalty in the Saudi capital of Riyadh,
and King Khaled sent a letter via special emissary to Syr
ian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, according to
Saudi state radio.
The contents of King Khaled's letter to Syria were not
{ au.ic. but .udJ Jiplo. < -ic sources here sa d they
believed the Saudi government was counseling restraint
and greater cooperation with Habib — who was expected
to return to Damascus today to renew his shuttle between
Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.
The Cabinet of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin, who has threatened to take military action against the
Syrian missiles if they are not removed voluntarily,
agreed unanimously to give U.S. diplomatic efforts more
time. Begin said.
In Jerusalem, Begin told reporters following the regular
weekly Cabinet session that "No time limit was referred
to whatsoever" in allowing Habib to have more time for

diplomacy.
"We don't want war, we want a peaceful solution," Be
gin said, reiterating his desire for a diplomatic end to the
crisis.
Dole predicts Reagan setback
Washington — Sen. Robert Dole predicted yesterday
that President Ronald Reagan will be forced to com
promise on his proposed changes in Social Security and
said the administration unveiled its plan too soon.
"I think you'll see a lot of compromises in the presi
dent's proposals." said Dole, a Kansas Republican and
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
"The short term. yes. we'll make some changes which
will not affect benefits. Long term. I think we'll make
changes that may affect benefits — maybe we'll change
the COLA (cost ot living adjustment), maybe we'll do oth
er things," he said on the CBS program "Face the Na
tion."
Dole said he did not believe the Social Security pro
posals would damage efforts to pass Reagan's program of
cuts in taxes and spending.
He said he talked Saturday night with Health and Hu
man Services Secretary Richard Schweiker and that the
secretary is "looking for a compromise" on the cuts in So
cial Security benefits.
Priest appeals for hunger strikers
Belfast. Northern Ireland— The Catholic priest brother
of Irish hunger striker Raymond McCreesh. reported fad
ing in the 57th day of his fast, sent a telegram yesterday to
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher begging her to
save his life by making some concessions.
McCreesh. 24, was given the last rites of the Roman
Catholic Church Saturday night and "is almost blind, los
ing his hearing and lapsing in and out of unconsciousness,"
said a spokesman for the IRA's political front, Ken
McClain.
The telegram to Mrs. Thatcher from McCreesh's
brother, the Rev. Brian McCreesh, a parish priest at
Coalisland, 30 miles west of here, said:
"All he t Raymond McCreesh) has left is his pride as an
Irishman and his loyalty to his fellow prisoners, living and
dead. I beg you to respect his dignity and save him."
In London, a spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher's office at 10
Downing Street said: "We have no comment. A reply will
be sent."
Police reported scattered violence in three Northern
Ireland cities amid simmering tension generated by the
hunger strike and the British government's repeated re
fusal to treat Irish Republican Army inmates as political
prisoners rather than common criminals.
Reagan reminisces at Notre Dame
South Bend. Ind.—Presiueiit itonaid Reagan bathed
himself in nostalgia about "the Gipper," Knute Rockne,
and his film career yesterday in delivering a commence
ment address at Notre Dame University.
It was Reagan's first trip outside the capital since he
was shot by a would-be assassin on March 30. Security was
especially tight, but did not keep the president from enjoy
ing a triumphant return to a campus that 41 years ago pro
vided the setting for his first widely acclaimed movie role,
that ot legendary Notre Dame iuliback George Gipp in the
movie "Knute Rockne, All American."
Reagan, wearing a'black robe and mortar board, was
presented an honorary doctorate degree. So was Pat

0 Brien, the actor who played Knute Rockne in the film
Reagan and O'Brien embraced on center stage, delighting
the capacity audience of 12.500
Reagan said there was "real significance" in the story
ot George Gipp and his death-bed request to Rockne to
someday ask a Notre Dame team to "win one for the Gip
per."
"Yes, it was only a game and it might seem somewhat
maudlin, but is there anything wrong with young men hav
ing the experience of feeling something so deeply that they
can give so completely of themselves?" Reagan asked
"There will come times in the lives of all of us when
we'll be faced with causes bigger than ourselves, and they
won't be on a playing field."
Reagan is far from having completely recovered from
his gunshot wound and his delivery showed it. His voice
was hoarse, and he occasionally stumbled over the words
in reading the address.
Power network called "vulnerable"
Washington— The nation's electric power system is vul
nerable to major interruptions from sabotage or ter
rorism, and the federal government is doing little about it,
the congressional auditing agency says.
The power system has never suffered a national disrup
tion or a long-term regional disruption, the General Ac
counting Office noted, but is "highly vulnerable because
its components are widely dispersed, operated in a low
manpower environment, have minimal security and are
highly interdependent."
A GAO report released last week said the agency's in
vestigators studied an unidentified region with 120 sepa
rate utilities.
'' An attack on just eight substations could result in wide
spread power outages, with cascading blackouts through
out the electrical grid. In addition, major metropolitan
areas in the region could be without power for several days
and be subject to rotating blackouts for over a year," the
report said.
"Damage to tour substations could actually place one
city on interruptible power tor up to a year," it warned.

"One substation's key components could be damaged us
ing a rifle and leave an important defense-related facility
without power."
The Emergency Electric Power Administration in the
Energy Department has only two staff members, working
less than full-time, working on emergency planning, the
report said.
Designated utility company employees around the coun
try are listed as special unpaid government employees
who, in a national emergency declared by the president,
would manage the power system under guidance of
EEPA.
The GAO said its interviews with "a number'' of those
workers found them mostly unsure of their responsibilities
and doubtful that the organization could work in an emer
gency. Some no longer worked for the company under
which they were listed and some did not even know they
would represent the government in an emergency.
In its response, which was included in the GAO report,
the Energy Department disagreed with almost all the
GAO conclusions. In particular, the department said dis
persal was a source of strength because it provided many
sources of power and transmission routes.
Virgin wins Bay-to-Breakers run
San Francisco— Craig Virgin, leading 27,000 runners
wearing everything from business suits to nothing at all,
sprinted yesterday to his second consecutive victory in the

The race was marred by the death of at least one runner,
who reportedly suffered a heart attack, authorities said.
Officials said doctors participating in the race tried to re
suscitate the victim, whose identity was not immediately
available.

Cloudy through tonight with periods of light rain.
Partial clearing with a few showers tomorrow. Lows in
the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Light
