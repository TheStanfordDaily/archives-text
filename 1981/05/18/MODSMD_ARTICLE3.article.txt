# Feminist major to focus on theory development
## 
### Louise Solomon 
The feminist studies program here
approaches the subject ot gender dif
ferently than similar programs at oth
er universities. It emphasizes the de
velopment of feminist theory and
analysis rather than the more com
mon approach to women's studies that
focuses on women within each of the
traditional disciplines.
Feminist studies expands and re
evaluates the assumptions, areas of
inquiry, data, theories, and in
terpretations of traditional dis
ciplines, according to the Report of
the Task Force on the Study of Wom
en, the group which officially recom
mended the creation of the Feminist
Studies program April. It provides a
framework for analyzing unequal
gender systems and analyzes the im
plications of individual and institu
tional gender stereotypes, says the re
port.
Many courses studying women and
gender issues already exist. Since
1976, 70 courses have been taught in
various departments including Eng
lish, business, political science, his
tory. anthropolgy, law, religious stud
ies and human biology. The feminist
studies program provides coordi
nation of existing courses and de
velops the new ones necessary for
coherence and structure in a student's
academic program.
The major will be considered indi
vidually designed until the program is
actually given the authority to grant
degrees, hopefully sometime in the
next few years, said English Prot.
Anne Mellor, director of the program.
However, there is a recommended
curriculum including an introductory
course on the situation of women in so
ciety, a feminist theory course, a sem
inar, specific focus of study and a
practicum or field research. Each stu
dent will take a minimum of 12
courses for a total of 60 units.
The introductory core requirement
can be met by two courses currently
being taught, said Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman, a member of the
committee organizing the major.
These courses are English 163E,
which examines novels by women to
explore social questions, and VTS 160,
which focuses on women and technolo
gy and actually combines discussion

and use of the technology being stud
ied. These courses have had high en
rollment in the past and student in
terest is expected to continue to grow,
Freedman said.
Seven foci, united by theme or dis
ciplinary subject area, are currently
suggested. However, students are
able to design their own focus in con
sultation with an advisor. The list of
foci includes Sex and Gender; Women
in Language and Symbol; Race, Class,
and Sex; and Feminist Perspectives
on Science, Health and the Environ
ment.
"It's as important to get both men
and women interested in the subject ot
gender as it is to get majors," Mellor
said. She said that she sees many
women double-majoring in feminist
studies and another academic area.
On the decision to call the new pro
gram "feminist studies" instead of
"women's studies," Mellor said that
feminist studies implies a critical look
at society and the broader goal of not
just studying women but both genders.
Freedman said the difference was
that "women's studies" focuses on the
subject matter, whereas "feminist
studies" focuses on methodology and
critical analysis. "We want to claim
the word feminist as a non-threaten
ing word," said Freedman.
Two directions in current feminist
thinking exist, said Mellor. She said
that one direction is to reclaim and re
define the ancient myths in positive
feminist terms — for example, a cele
bration of women as the mother
goddess, closely tied to nature and the
earth. The second direction is an im
age of androgyny, or a union of what
has been typically associated with the
female and the male.
The first direction is criticized tor
its lack of practicality, whereas the
latter one is criticized for endangering
the feminist movement's ability to at
tack certain traditionally masculine
values such as aggression.
Mellor said that both directions ot
thought were well-represented at
Stanford, but that there was a larger
number on the side of the androgynous
image.
Both she and Freedman seemed en
thusiastic about the program and both
ot them agreed that response by facul
ty and students has been "very
positive."

"It's as important to get both men
and women interested in the subject ot
gender as it is to get majors," Mellor
said. She said that she sees many
women double-majoring in feminist
studies and another academic area.
On the decision to call the new pro
gram "feminist studies" instead of
"women's studies," Mellor said that
feminist studies implies a critical look
at society and the broader goal of not
just studying women but both genders.
Freedman said the difference was
that "women's studies" focuses on the
subject matter, whereas "feminist
studies" focuses on methodology and
critical analysis. "We want to claim
the word feminist as a non-threaten
ing word," said Freedman.
Two directions in current feminist
thinking exist, said Mellor. She said
that one direction is to reclaim and re
define the ancient myths in positive
feminist terms — for example, a cele
bration of women as the mother
goddess, closely tied to nature and the
earth. The second direction is an im
age of androgyny, or a union of what
has been typically associated with the
female and the male.
The first direction is criticized tor
its lack of practicality, whereas the
latter one is criticized for endangering
the feminist movement's ability to at
tack certain traditionally masculine
values such as aggression.
Mellor said that both directions ot
thought were well-represented at
Stanford, but that there was a larger
number on the side of the androgynous
image.
Both she and Freedman seemed en
thusiastic about the program and both
ot them agreed that response by facul
ty and students has been "very
positive."
The feminist studies program here
approaches the subject ot gender dif
ferently than similar programs at oth
er universities. It emphasizes the de
velopment of feminist theory and
analysis rather than the more com
mon approach to women's studies that
focuses on women within each of the
traditional disciplines.
Feminist studies expands and re
evaluates the assumptions, areas of
inquiry, data, theories, and in
terpretations of traditional dis
ciplines, according to the Report of
the Task Force on the Study of Wom
en, the group which officially recom
mended the creation of the Feminist
Studies program April. It provides a
framework for analyzing unequal
gender systems and analyzes the im
plications of individual and institu
tional gender stereotypes, says the re
port.
Many courses studying women and
gender issues already exist. Since
1976, 70 courses have been taught in
various departments including Eng
lish, business, political science, his
tory. anthropolgy, law, religious stud
ies and human biology. The feminist
studies program provides coordi
nation of existing courses and de
velops the new ones necessary for
coherence and structure in a student's
academic program.
The major will be considered indi
vidually designed until the program is
actually given the authority to grant
degrees, hopefully sometime in the
next few years, said English Prot.
Anne Mellor, director of the program.
However, there is a recommended
curriculum including an introductory
course on the situation of women in so
ciety, a feminist theory course, a sem
inar, specific focus of study and a
practicum or field research. Each stu
dent will take a minimum of 12
courses for a total of 60 units.
The introductory core requirement
can be met by two courses currently
being taught, said Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman, a member of the
committee organizing the major.
These courses are English 163E,
which examines novels by women to
explore social questions, and VTS 160,
which focuses on women and technolo
gy and actually combines discussion

and use of the technology being stud
ied. These courses have had high en
rollment in the past and student in
terest is expected to continue to grow,
Freedman said.
Seven foci, united by theme or dis
ciplinary subject area, are currently
suggested. However, students are
able to design their own focus in con
sultation with an advisor. The list of
foci includes Sex and Gender; Women
in Language and Symbol; Race, Class,
and Sex; and Feminist Perspectives
on Science, Health and the Environ
ment.
