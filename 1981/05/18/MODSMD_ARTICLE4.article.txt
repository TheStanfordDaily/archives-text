# Speakers debate Central American involvement
## 
### Leah Halper 
From the first question at the morn
ing press conference until other pan
elists summarized nearly five hours of
debate, State Dept. spokesman James
Cheek was on the defensive Saturday
about U.S. policy in Central America
Establishing what he called "the of
ficial view of analysis of the situation
and the U.S. policy stance," Cheek
told about 500 people at Kresge
Auditorium that the United States is
justified in tearing Communist in
tervention in El Salvador, and will
therefore continue economic and mili
tary aid to the present junta-backed
government despite its "very serious
flaws."
Cheek's analysis was debated by
Ruben Zamora, secretary ot the Ex
ternal Commission ot the Democratic
Revolutionary Front (FDR) of El
Salvador; Wolf Grabendorf, a West
German specialist in Latin American
affairs who is a visiting professor at
John Hopkins School of Advanced In
ternational Studies; Thomas Quigley
of the U.S. Catholic Conference; and
Congressional Representative Pete
McCloskey (R-12th District). Donald
Harris of Stanford's Economics De
partment moderated, and each speak
er was questioned by Richard Fagen
of Stanford and Carmen Diana Deere
of the University of Massachusetts

Saying that the Reagan Adminis
tration has opted tor military over dip
lomatic strategies in El Salvador,
Zamora discounted Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's "communist con
spiracy" theory. El Salvador's violent
struggle, he said, is a consequence of
past inequities and American manipu
lation rather than a struggle between
capitalist and socialist ideologies.
"That guerillas cause violence is
the standard phrase ot the extreme
right, but if you look at history you see
that violence was started by those in
power, with security forces and the
army," Zamora said. For 15 years full
of violence I've worked for elections
and I've been put in jail and tortured.
The Department of State cannot say
that the left causes violence. Facists
are controlling El Salvador; they are
the rulers."
With implicit U.S. support and mili
tary aid in the form ot trucks, heli
copters, communications equipment,
and technical trainers. Zamora added,
regimes in Central America may do as
they please.
In El Salvador, according to
Zamora, the military has overseen
paramilitary kidnappings, torture and
massacres Even economic aid ends
up being spent by the Minister of De
fense, he said, because in its present
crisis El Salvador has no adminis

trative structure to disseminate U.S.
monies.
Zamora received a standing ovation
when he told the audience that Ameri
cans therefore share responsibility for
what happens in El Salvador.
"The military high command has
said no to international mediation,"
Zamora declared. "They do not want a
political solution. They will say no
only if they have Reagan Adminis
tration support to say no." Zamora
said that Americans should be present
at any peace negotiations because the
U.S. has kept the junta in power. In ad
dition. he pointed out, "There is a
chance that American soldiers will be
sent to die in Latin America."
Cheek, however, cautioned against
what he called the "Vietnam syn
drome — the mistake of being heated,
hyperconscious, and quick to adopt a
position." Cheek said the Reagan Ad
ministration acknowledges "cen
turies of social injustice and repres
sion," but has chosen to aid neither the
right nor the left in El Salvador, a na
tion with a "tradition of violence."
"El Salvador has one of the highest
homicide rates in the world," he said.
"The people are accustomed to using
violence as a tool. Since no one else in
the Western World seems very eager
to get involved, we will have to do so."
Cheek added that it is possible, and

part of U.S. policy goals, to punitively
transfer especially abusive enlisted
men and to support "free, ope:;,
credible, non-repressive election.-
Citing Algeria as an example, Cheek
said elections can be held even in
midst ot "raging civil war."
Cheek acknowledged that mail to
Washington is running heavily against
U.S. involvement in Central America.
Until reports ot socialist block arms
reached the Carter Administration, he
said, the U.S. gave little military aid
to the junta. Now an "arms surplus"
and the spectre of Premier Fidel
Castro "gobbling up countries in Latin
America" has added an East-West
dimension, he said
Grabendorf responded by saying
that Europeans avoid overlaying Cen
tral America with East-West signifi
cance. "There is a strong feeling in
Europe that Central America has been
a test case, not on the ability ot the
U.S. to reassert its superpower, but on
Western powers to integrate Third
World models into our understanding
of how the world works today."
Grabendorf said.
If more nations don't follow Sweden
and Mexico's leads in "leaving real
choices open" tor Third World coun
tries, Grabendorf said, "we'll have a
self-fulfilling prophecy and nations

will ask the U.S.S.R. for help." Arms
procurement in Central America,
where leftist groups have been
"isolated" by the U.S. government, is
one example of this, he said.
Grabendort also said that American
policymakers are handicapped by an
inability to understand radical left
movement in other countries. And.
"unlike superpowers from the Ro
mans to Britain, the U.S. has never
had to come to grips with unfriendly
neighbors. It is possible to live side by
side with Communist neighbors — it
might be difficult but it must be made
possible or we'll blow up the world."
Other nations might consent to arbi
trating the current crisis in El
Salvador, said Grabendorf, "if the
Americans had not been 'helping'
from the very beginning."

Quigley addressed the role of the
church in El Salvador, citing ex
amples of assassinated clergy, at
tacks on Catholic buildings and or
ganizations, and harassment. Ameri
can Catholics have responded by
drawing together to oppose military

aid and work for negotiation, he said.
The symposium was sponsored by a
number of campus departments and
organizations and planned by the El
Salvador Solidarity Committee with
input from the Faculty Committee on
Central America.
