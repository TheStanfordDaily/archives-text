## Suzuki's weakness in foreign policy blamed for ministers' resignations 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — When a little-kndwn
politician named Zenko Suzuki
became prime minister last
summer, the wise heads in To
kyo described him as an
amiable tellow with one major
fault — he did not know much
about foreign policy.
The judgment seemed to be
proved accurate Saturday with
the sudden resignation of his
two top foreign policy officials
in a dispute that hinged on what
Suzuki had or had not promised
President Ronald Reagan last
week.
Suzuki emerged from the dis
pute looking inconsistent and
confused. His ruling faction in
the Liberal Democratic Party
was split, rumors of more resig
nations surfaced, and the future
of his government seemed un
certain.
Foreign Minister Masavoshi
Ito resigned unexpectedly after
a bruising intra-Cabinet squab
ble. announcing that he would
take responsibility for the con
fusion that erupted over a joint
communique issued by Suzuki
and Reagan a week ago in Wash
ington. The Ministry's top ca
reer otficial. Vice Minister
Masuo Takashima, also re
signed and there were reports
that lesser officials would fol
low suit.
Ito was replaced by Sunao
Sonoda. 67, a former foreign
minister who negotiated the
1978 Japan-China peace and
friendship treaty. Sonoda.
health and welfare minister
since last September, was for
eign minister from November
1977 to November 1979.
Disagreement
It was the unlikely cul
mination of a simmering dis
agreement over what had
seemed to be merely a semantic
confusion but which had touched
on the raw nerves of Japanese
politicans who don't want this
country to play a bigger defense

role in the world
The communique last week
had described the U.S.-
Japanese relationship as an "al
liance." which in Japan is a
risky code word usually taken to
mean a joint military under
taking For a week, opposition
parties and part of the press
pilloried Suzuki for allegedly
bowing to U.S. demands for an
expanded defense effort with
the United States.
Suzuki, throughout the week,
denied that the term had any
military connotation and
stressed repeatedly that his
talks with Reagan had not added
anything new to his country's
military promises.
Joint Communique
The prime minister finally
triggered Ito's resignation by
blaming the Foreign Ministry
for mishandling the joint com
munique. Publicly in par
liament and privately in an
acrimonious Cabinet meeting,
he said the communique did not
represent his true views of the
summit meeting.
He said that in his final meet
ing with Reagan he had stressed
that Japan's defense posture is
sharply limited by public opin
ion, which opposes any big
buildup, and by fiscal restraints
imposed by heavy deficit spend
ing.
Suzuki, it was learned, re
peated these complaints to Ito's
face during a heated Cabinet
meeting Friday. Sources said
Ito replied by asking that the
comments not be made public
and reportedly believed he had
received assurances of that. In
stead, the confrontation was
widely reported in newspapers,
and at 1 p.m. Friday night Ito
handed in his resignation. He
was asked by chief Cabinet Se
creatry Kiichi Miyazawa to re
consider, but refused.
That produced a bitter dis
agreement within the Foreign
Ministry, which felt it was being

made the scapegoat for what
was. in fact. Suzuki's own turn
about under political pressure.
Major disruption
It was the first major disrup
tion in the Suzuki government
since he became prime minister
last July, following the death of
Masavoshi Ohira. who suffered
a heart attack. Ito had been a
close ally of Ohira and. iron
ically. was chosen foreign min
ister in a public gesture to pro
vide continuity with the pro
nounced pro-American views of
Ohira.
There had been one sharp dif
ference earlier this year, also
involving an American issue.
Suzuki authorized the Ministry
of International Trade and In
dustry to negotiate the issue of
restricting automobile exports
to the United States as Reagan
requested. Ito had wanted his
Foreign Ministry to negotiate

the export problem
The long-term political dam
ages for Suzuki were not clear
Since he and Ito are members of
the same dominant faction
within the Liberal Democratic
Party, the incident was con
sidered certain to cause a fac
tional split. There was specula
tion that opposing party leaders
might try to take advantage of
the dispute to bring Suzuki
down. Even before the Ito resig
nation Saturday, the prime min
ister was being criticized in the
press tor inconsistency.
Since returning to Tokyo,
however, Suzuki has painstak
ingly refuted any suggestions
that he offered Reagan an ex
panded defense role. Japan will
not consider any form of collec
tive defense with the United
States and has not promised to
increase detense expenditures,
he told parliament Friday.
