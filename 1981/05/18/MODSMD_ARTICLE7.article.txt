# Worried Mexico uses duty to combat 'petrolizacion'
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Mexico City — Amid growing
official concern over the direc
tion ot the Mexican economy,
the Mexican government has
announced an increase of as
much as 100 percent in the taxes
that must be paid on 269 so
called luxury items, most of
which are imported from the
United States
The higher import duties,
which will affect items ranging
from hand-held calculators and
children's toys to Christmas
trees, are designed to dis
courage skyrocketing demand
tor such items. Last year, ac
cording to recently released
Banco de Mexico figures. Mexi
cans spent more than $2.4 billion
dollars on imported consumer
goods, an increase over 1979 of
more than 142 percent.
The new import duties, an
nounced in the government's
<)fficial Daily and put into effect
last week, underscore the Mexi
can government's growing pre
occupation — evidenced in a
series ot recent official public
comments — that despite
careful economic planning,
Mexico is showing signs ot what
Mexicans call "petrolizacion"
— the reliance on petroleum ex

ports for revenue that is then
spent on items imported from
abroad
Increase export capacity
That worry was present 10
days ago when Gustavo Romero
Kolbeck, the general director of
the Banco de Mexico. Mexico's
state-owned central bank, urged
the government to extend more
than $2.7 billion dollars in cred
its to help Mexico's small and
medium-sized manufacturers
increase their export capacity.
In proposing the credits,
Kolbeck pointed to "alarming''
Banco de Mexico statistics that
show petroleum exports were
becoming so great a factor in
Mexico's foreign commerce
that Mexico was in danger of be
coming a monoexporter.
While exports ot manufac
tured items such as shoes and
textiles grew by only 1.3 percent
during 1980 — a growth that ac
tually signifies a decline, given
Mexico's official inflation rate
last year of 29.8 percent — rev
enue from petroleum exports
grew by a whopping 167 percent.
Petroleum exports were re
sponsible for 67 percent of Mexi
co's foreign revenue during
980, the Banco de Mexico said
in its annual report, compared
with 43.9 percent in 1979. In the
first tour months of 1981, ac
cording to preliminary figures,
petroleum accounted for nearly
74 percent of export revenues.
Manufacturing failure
The Mexican government's
concern over the course of the
economy was also behind Pro
gramming and Budget Minister
Miguel de la Madrid's ad
mission last week — just one
day before the new import
duties were announced — that
Mexican manufacturers failed
to grow at the rate predicted in
government plans. Mexican
government officials so rarely
admit that things are not going
according to plan that some
Mexico City newspapers telt ob
ligated to comment editorially
on de la Madrid's candor.
In 1980, according to Banco de
Mexico, Mexico's imports in
creased 55 percent, included
machinery tor expansion ot in
dustry.
But it was the increase in the

imports of consumer goods that
may prove most worrisome for
Mexican officials
Oil for economic growth
Since the Lopez Portillo ad
ministration announced tour
years ago that it would increase
petroleum exports to help pull
Mexico out of a prolonged finan
cial crisis, Mexican ofticials
have promised that the oil rev
enue would be used only to fi
nance broad-based economic
growth. Lopez Portillo pledged
that Mexico would not commit
the same errors as other petro
leum countries, using oil export
revenue to import consumer
goods while leaving other sec
tors of the economy woefully un
developed.
But despite Lopez Portillo's
best intentions, Mexican manu
facturers have been unable to
keep up with the Mexicans' de
mand tor consumer goods,
much less create a surplus for
export, and Mexican consumers
have turned increasingly to im
ported items, mostly from the
United States, to fill the gap.
Signs of the growing Mexican
demand tor consumer items are
everywhere. Food store chains,
tor example, are devoting in
creasing shelf space to non-food
items — television sets, radios
and electrical appliances.
Visas
Perhaps most telling ot all is
the blocks-long line of people
waiting outside the U.S. Em
bassy daily tor visas. Despite
the lack of any more Mexican
holidays until Sept. 1, the line
Friday stretched nearly six
blocks. The increase in Mexi
cans traveling to the United
States was so great in 980, that
Mexico's protit from tourism
actually dropped to $659 million
from $730 million in 1979.
And there is little doubt in
anybody's minds about why so
many Mexicans are traveling to
the United States, where infla
tion is running at about a third
the rate in Mexico and where
prices for a wide range of con
sumer goods, from shirts to
toasters, are considerably less.
"They're not going there for
tourism." Tourism Minister
Rosa Luz Alegria said recently.
"They're going there to buy."

Mexico City — Amid growing
official concern over the direc
tion ot the Mexican economy,
the Mexican government has
announced an increase of as
much as 100 percent in the taxes
that must be paid on 269 so
called luxury items, most of
which are imported from the
United States
The higher import duties,
which will affect items ranging
from hand-held calculators and
children's toys to Christmas
trees, are designed to dis
courage skyrocketing demand
tor such items. Last year, ac
cording to recently released
Banco de Mexico figures. Mexi
cans spent more than $2.4 billion
dollars on imported consumer
goods, an increase over 1979 of
more than 142 percent.
The new import duties, an
nounced in the government's
<)fficial Daily and put into effect
last week, underscore the Mexi
can government's growing pre
occupation — evidenced in a
series ot recent official public
comments — that despite
careful economic planning,
Mexico is showing signs ot what
Mexicans call "petrolizacion"
— the reliance on petroleum ex

ports for revenue that is then
spent on items imported from
abroad
Increase export capacity
That worry was present 10
days ago when Gustavo Romero
Kolbeck, the general director of
the Banco de Mexico. Mexico's
state-owned central bank, urged
the government to extend more
than $2.7 billion dollars in cred
its to help Mexico's small and
medium-sized manufacturers
increase their export capacity.
In proposing the credits,
Kolbeck pointed to "alarming''
Banco de Mexico statistics that
show petroleum exports were
becoming so great a factor in
Mexico's foreign commerce
that Mexico was in danger of be
coming a monoexporter.
While exports ot manufac
tured items such as shoes and
textiles grew by only 1.3 percent
during 1980 — a growth that ac
tually signifies a decline, given
Mexico's official inflation rate
last year of 29.8 percent — rev
enue from petroleum exports
grew by a whopping 167 percent.
Petroleum exports were re
sponsible for 67 percent of Mexi
co's foreign revenue during
980, the Banco de Mexico said
in its annual report, compared
with 43.9 percent in 1979. In the
first tour months of 1981, ac
cording to preliminary figures,
petroleum accounted for nearly
74 percent of export revenues.
Manufacturing failure
The Mexican government's
concern over the course of the
economy was also behind Pro
gramming and Budget Minister
Miguel de la Madrid's ad
mission last week — just one
day before the new import
duties were announced — that
Mexican manufacturers failed
to grow at the rate predicted in
government plans. Mexican
government officials so rarely
admit that things are not going
according to plan that some
Mexico City newspapers telt ob
ligated to comment editorially
on de la Madrid's candor.
In 1980, according to Banco de
Mexico, Mexico's imports in
creased 55 percent, included
machinery tor expansion ot in
dustry.
But it was the increase in the

imports of consumer goods that
may prove most worrisome for
Mexican officials
Oil for economic growth
Since the Lopez Portillo ad
ministration announced tour
years ago that it would increase
petroleum exports to help pull
Mexico out of a prolonged finan
cial crisis, Mexican ofticials
have promised that the oil rev
enue would be used only to fi
nance broad-based economic
growth. Lopez Portillo pledged
that Mexico would not commit
the same errors as other petro
leum countries, using oil export
revenue to import consumer
goods while leaving other sec
tors of the economy woefully un
developed.
But despite Lopez Portillo's
best intentions, Mexican manu
facturers have been unable to
keep up with the Mexicans' de
mand tor consumer goods,
much less create a surplus for
export, and Mexican consumers
have turned increasingly to im
ported items, mostly from the
United States, to fill the gap.
Signs of the growing Mexican
demand tor consumer items are
everywhere. Food store chains,
tor example, are devoting in
creasing shelf space to non-food
items — television sets, radios
and electrical appliances.
Visas
Perhaps most telling ot all is
the blocks-long line of people
waiting outside the U.S. Em
bassy daily tor visas. Despite
the lack of any more Mexican
holidays until Sept. 1, the line
Friday stretched nearly six
blocks. The increase in Mexi
cans traveling to the United
States was so great in 980, that
Mexico's protit from tourism
actually dropped to $659 million
from $730 million in 1979.
And there is little doubt in
anybody's minds about why so
many Mexicans are traveling to
the United States, where infla
tion is running at about a third
the rate in Mexico and where
prices for a wide range of con
sumer goods, from shirts to
toasters, are considerably less.

tourism." Tourism Minister
Rosa Luz Alegria said recently.
