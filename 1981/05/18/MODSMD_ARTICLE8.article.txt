## Concerned about outcry over budget cuts Republicans try to reassure public 
### Washington Post 
Easton, Md. â€” Republican of
ficeholders, nervous about pub
lic reaction to President Ronald
Reagan's proposed Social Se
curity cutbacks, voted at an in
formal party meeting Saturday
to assure "those who are row
concerned that no partic lar
age group or segment of our
population will sustain an ui fair
burden" of protecting th< re
tirement system 112 om
bankruptcy.
In Washington, meanwhile,
Health and Human Services
Secretary Richard Schweiker
said Reagan is willing to com
promise on his Social Security
proposals. "We would certainly
strongly consider working out a
bipartisan bill," Schweiker said
in an appearance on the "UPI
Roundtable" broadcast.
Endorsement avoided
The language adopted at the
Republicans' Tidewater Con
ference. attended by 17 GOP
members ot the House and Sen
ate. governors and other state
wide officials, avoided any
direct repudiation or endorse
ment of Reagan's proposal for a
sharp reduction starting next
year ot benefits for those who
retired before age 65.
But Rep. Carroll Campbell
(R-S.C.), one ot the drafters of
the tinal statement, capsulized
the mood when he said, "There
are many people upset and dis
turbed" by what they have
heard of the Reagan plan.
"Those on the brink of retire
ment years think the rug is
being pulled from under their
feet."
In his message on the finan
cial crisis threatening the Social
Security trust fund, Reagan pro
posed protecting benefits and
cost-of-living allowances for all
present recipients but sug
gested cutting benefits by
almost one-third for those who
choose early retirement in the
future. That provision has
stirred great controversy and
was denounced by House Speak
er Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) as "stone-hearted."
The Republicans rallied be
hind the president, up to a point.
The resolution said the fiscal
problems now facing Social Se

curity are a result of "the
abysmal neglect ot past Demo
cratic-dominated Congresses,
which have accelerated the ben
efits far beyond the ability of the
system to pay for them."
O'Neill cricized
Former party chairman Bill
Brock, now the administration's
special trade representative,
said statements like O'Neill's
are "a contemptible exercise in
political hypocrisy."
But while commending Rea
gan tor "properly focusing na
tional attention" on the Social
Security system's financial
problems and joining his opposi
tion to any boost in payroll tax
es. the Republican officeholders
were plainly looking nervously
over their shoulders at their
constituents on this issue.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.)
said that three-fourths of the
questions he received on a radio
call-in show this week suggested
that people thought Reagan was
"just whacking back benefits in
a railroading kind of proposi
tion."
Actuarial calculations in
dicate that the Reagan pro
posals eventually would reduce
Social Security benefit outlays
by nearly one-fourth, and would
save twice as much as the pro
gram needs to operate in the
black. Budget director David
Stockman attempted to down
play those figures in a news con
ference Saturday, saying that
the actuarial numbers, calcu
lated over a 75-year period, are
"very artitical and mislead
ing."
'Some give-and-taking'
And Schweiker indicated that
Reagan would be happy to con
sider different approaches to
the problem if Congress wants
to offer them up. "Certainly
you're going to have to do some
give-and-taking," he said . . I
think we're certainly willing to
look at a reasonable proposal
and blending of different
ideas."
The Tidewater Conference
was started in 1978 by Sen. Bob
Packwood (R-Ore.) partly as a
social weekend for Republicans
and partly as a forum for argu
ing out divisive issues within the
party in an informal at

mosphere. This is the first time
it has met with a Republican in
the White House, and the partic
ipants were sensitive to any sug
gestion that they might be at
odds with the administration.
In addition to Brock, Interior
Secretary James Watt and
Energy Secretary James Ed
wards attended, and White
House political counselor Lyn
Nofziger was monitoring the
proceedings.
Earlier, a group of Re
publican governors woh a tac
tical victory when they suc
ceeded in removing from a
draft-resolution on block grants
a specific reference to giving
states "responsibility for the
maintenance ot health, educa
tion and welfare."
The governors, led by Rich
ard Snelling ot Vermont and
Lamar Alexander ot Tennessee,
said they supported Reagan's
pending proposals to merge
more than 100 separate, catego

rical programs into seven block
grants for health, educatioh and
community development.
But when it came to welfare,
Alexander said, "the president
has one view and most gov
ernors have another." Reagan
tor many years has urged that
the basic income-support pro
grams be turned over to the
states, while the National Gov
ernors Association equally long
has called for federalization ot
welfare.
With backing from Sen. David
Durenberger (R-Minn.) the
chairman of the Senate Inter-
Governmental Relations sub
committee, the governors
pushed through a resolution urg
ing a "sorting out ot obligations
and capacities as they are most
appropriate at each level of gov
ernment."
The conference also reaf
firmed the Republican Party
platform's pledge ot across-the
board tax cuts.
