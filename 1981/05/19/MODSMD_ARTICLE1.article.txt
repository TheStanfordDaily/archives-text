# Netters victorious over Bulldogs; meet UCLA today at finals
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Athens, Ga. — The midnight chimes
tolled a day early tor the Cinderella
Georgia Bulldogs, who had their bell
rung by second-seeded Stanford 7-2
yesterday in the semifinals of the
NCAA Tennis Championships. The
dream of so many fans here at the
hosts' Henry Feild Stadium, as well as
the players, was indeed proven im
possible. . ,
Stanford advanced to today's 2 p.m.
finals, when they will meet trip-seeded
UCLA. The teams split earlier
Pacific-10 Conference matches this
season. Stanford won 6-3 at home,
while losing to the Bruins 5-4 in Los
Angeles two weekends ago.
It looked doubtful yesterday wheth
er Stanford would make the losing end
of a 5-4 score. Backed by a screaming
crowd of 3000 tans, the Bulldogs held
four service breaks in the first sets of
the six matches.
"We had a good chance," Georgia
coach and tournament director Dan
Magill said. "We could have won any
of the matches, but they're not na
tional champs for nothing."
Despite that advantage, Georgia
came away with only one win in the
singles, Tom Foster's 6-2,6-4 drubbing
of Scott Bondurant in the No. 5 spot.
Stanford clinched the match in the sin
gles, including three three-set vic
tories.
According to No. 2 Scott Davis, who
came from a first-set service break
down to put away left-hander John
Mangan 7-6 (5-1), 6-4, there were two
reasons tor the Cards' sluggish start. ,
"Everybody's a little worried about
the crowd. That was the biggest fear
as far as the team match goes. No
matter how much the guys talked
about it, I wasn't totally prepared tor
the noise today," Davis said. "Individ
ually, we were a little hesitant as to
our confidence. We hadn't seen these
players before this week."
Tim Mayotte, who beat lefty Bill
Rogers 7-5, 6-7 (5-2), 6-2 in the No. 1
singles match, amplified Davis' idea.
"It takes you a half-set to really un
derstand what they can do. We were
discussing the matches amongst
ourselves last night and there were a
lot of blanks," Mayotte said. "There
was a feeling-out process."
What had looked menacing for Stan
ford slowly dissolved after that half
set. The Cards bounced back to split
the first sets with their hosts, winning
the first-set tiebreakers. Besides

Davis, only Jim Gurfein was able to
win in straight sets, beating Brent
Crymes 7-6 (5-2), 6-1 at the No. 3 posi
tion.
The match that seemed to take the
life out of the Bulldogs was at No. 4
singles, where left-hander Paul Groth
battled Stanford freshman Mike
Falberg. When Groth broke back
against Falberg, in the second game of
the final set, it looked as if the momen
tum was turning in the senior's direc
tion.
That break seemed to show up in the
11th game. Tied 5-5, Groth won the
first two points of Falberg's serve.
But the freshman rallied, reeling oft
eight consecutive points to win the
match 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.
The normally implacable blond,
who ran his dual match record to 1-1,
was snapping at the fans and generally
scowling at everyone in that tense
final set.
"I was nervous the whole match,"
Falberg said. "All of a sudden in the
last game I was confident. The tension
finally left." He added that the final
game in which he broke Groth was
"the only good return game I had the
whole match."
Shortly thereafter Mayotte and Jetf
Arons closed out the team match with
three-set wins within five minutes of
each other. Arons, who dropped the
first set to Kelly Thurman 7-5 despite
breaking the Georgia senior three
times, rallied to win the final two sets
6-3, 6-1.
He said he was so worried about his
teammates he wasn't concentrating
on his own match. "I thought we would
be lucky to win two out of three up
there," Arons said, pointing to the ad
jacent courts 1-3, which are in front of
the 3500-seat stadium. "It's weird — I
was worried about them winning and
they've been worried about me all
year."
Arons' victory was his eighth in his
last 10 matches. He, like his team
mates, is peaking just in time for the
last day of the season. Though Georgia
will meet USC at 10 a.m. for third
place, yesterday was the last day of
their impossible dream.

players before this week."
Tim Mayotte, who beat lefty Bill
Rogers 7-5, 6-7 (5-2), 6-2 in the No. 1
singles match, amplified Davis' idea.
"It takes you a half-set to really un
derstand what they can do. We were
discussing the matches amongst
ourselves last night and there were a
lot of blanks," Mayotte said. "There
was a feeling-out process."
What had looked menacing for Stan
ford slowly dissolved after that half
set. The Cards bounced back to split
the first sets with their hosts, winning
the first-set tiebreakers. Besides

Davis, only Jim Gurfein was able to
win in straight sets, beating Brent
Crymes 7-6 (5-2), 6-1 at the No. 3 posi
tion.
The match that seemed to take the
life out of the Bulldogs was at No. 4
singles, where left-hander Paul Groth
battled Stanford freshman Mike
Falberg. When Groth broke back
against Falberg, in the second game of
the final set, it looked as if the momen
tum was turning in the senior's direc
tion.
That break seemed to show up in the
11th game. Tied 5-5, Groth won the
first two points of Falberg's serve.
But the freshman rallied, reeling oft
eight consecutive points to win the
match 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.
The normally implacable blond,
who ran his dual match record to 1-1,
was snapping at the fans and generally
scowling at everyone in that tense
final set.
"I was nervous the whole match,"
Falberg said. "All of a sudden in the
last game I was confident. The tension
finally left." He added that the final
game in which he broke Groth was
"the only good return game I had the
whole match."
Shortly thereafter Mayotte and Jetf
Arons closed out the team match with
three-set wins within five minutes of
each other. Arons, who dropped the
first set to Kelly Thurman 7-5 despite
breaking the Georgia senior three
times, rallied to win the final two sets
6-3, 6-1.
He said he was so worried about his
teammates he wasn't concentrating
on his own match. "I thought we would
be lucky to win two out of three up
there," Arons said, pointing to the ad
jacent courts 1-3, which are in front of
the 3500-seat stadium. "It's weird — I
was worried about them winning and
they've been worried about me all
year."
Arons' victory was his eighth in his
last 10 matches. He, like his team
mates, is peaking just in time for the
last day of the season. Though Georgia
will meet USC at 10 a.m. for third
place, yesterday was the last day of
their impossible dream.

Athens, Ga. — The midnight chimes
tolled a day early tor the Cinderella
Georgia Bulldogs, who had their bell
rung by second-seeded Stanford 7-2
yesterday in the semifinals of the
NCAA Tennis Championships. The
dream of so many fans here at the
hosts' Henry Feild Stadium, as well as
the players, was indeed proven im
possible. . ,
Stanford advanced to today's 2 p.m.
finals, when they will meet trip-seeded
UCLA. The teams split earlier
Pacific-10 Conference matches this
season. Stanford won 6-3 at home,
while losing to the Bruins 5-4 in Los
Angeles two weekends ago.
It looked doubtful yesterday wheth
er Stanford would make the losing end
of a 5-4 score. Backed by a screaming
crowd of 3000 tans, the Bulldogs held
four service breaks in the first sets of
the six matches.
"We had a good chance," Georgia
coach and tournament director Dan
Magill said. "We could have won any
of the matches, but they're not na
tional champs for nothing."
Despite that advantage, Georgia
came away with only one win in the
singles, Tom Foster's 6-2,6-4 drubbing
of Scott Bondurant in the No. 5 spot.
Stanford clinched the match in the sin
gles, including three three-set vic
tories.
According to No. 2 Scott Davis, who
came from a first-set service break
down to put away left-hander John
Mangan 7-6 (5-1), 6-4, there were two
reasons tor the Cards' sluggish start. ,
"Everybody's a little worried about
the crowd. That was the biggest fear
as far as the team match goes. No
matter how much the guys talked
about it, I wasn't totally prepared tor
the noise today," Davis said. "Individ
ually, we were a little hesitant as to
our confidence. We hadn't seen these
players before this week."
Tim Mayotte, who beat lefty Bill
Rogers 7-5, 6-7 (5-2), 6-2 in the No. 1
singles match, amplified Davis' idea.
