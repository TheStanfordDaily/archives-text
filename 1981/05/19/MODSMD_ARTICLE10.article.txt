### 
Aydin Koc (Daily, May 2>
wrote denying the Armenian
genocide
The points of his thesis were
the following A There was no
genocide of the Armenians by
Turks. B No documents exist to
that elfect. C Ottomans did not
persecute their subjects D
Armenian terrorists wiped out
Muslim villages and burned res
idents in mosques E The case
of the Jews in World War 11 and
that ol the Armenians in World
War 1 are not comparable F
Ottomans transported Arme
nians away from the war zone
If there were no genocide.

then the countless non-Arme
nians who hdve said there was
were purveying lies and did not
speak ior the sake of justice and
truth
Fndtjof Nansen lor exam
ple. Armenia and the \ear
hast The whole plan of ex
termination was nothing more
nor less than cold-blooded, cal
culated political measure, hav
ing for its object the annihila
tion of a superior element in the
population And to this must
be added trie motive of greed
Or Lord James Bryce. Trans
caucasia and Ararat: "At this
moment (the Armenians? are
being slaughtered by the
thousands in their blazing vil
lages . . (The polic\ toward
the Armenians) was a policy of
deliberate oppression, which
ripened at last into a policy of
extermination "
Or .Arnold J. Toynbee. The
T r catmcnt of the .Armenians in
the Ottoman Empire, 1915-16:
"The Young Turkish Ministers
are directly and personally
responsible The scheme
was nothing less than the ex
termination ol the whole Chris
tian population '
Or Talaat Pasha himself, the
then Minister ol the Interior and
chiei architect ol the Armenian
genocide "The government by
order ol the Assembly (.Jamiet !
has decided to exterminate en
tirely all the Armenians living
in Turkey . "
Or even Adoll Hitler "Our
strength is our quickness and
brutality . . Who talks
nowadays ol the extermination
of the Armenians' 1 The world
believes only in success " (No
vember 23. 1939. Obersalsburg.
Germany )
Despite Koc s claims, there is
documentation of the slaughter
based on a mass ol evidence, the
court condemned to death, in
absentia. Enver. Talaat and
Djemal pashas.
In the report ol the convention
ol the Young Turks' party in
Salonika, held five years before
the Armenian Genocide. Dr
Nazim proposed that Turkey,
having lost nearly all of its lands
in Europe, look eastward to the
Azeri Turks and Turkomen peo
ples. "The Armenian problem is
not one to be solved through mi
nor arrests and persecutions,"
he said. " . . . We cannot give in
to the Armenian proposals for
reforms . There remains only
one alternative. ... : to wipe
out the Armenian race from the

J ace ol our empire " The con
vention passed L>r Nazim's pro
posal. and genocide became the
policy ol the government, mak
ing it premeditated and waiting
tor the opportune moment lor
its execution That moment
came with World War 1
Koc savs "Armenian ter
rorists wiped out Muslin vil
lages and burned mosques
This is a propaganda ploy.
Bernard Levin says in The
London Times "The British
consul was an eye-witness to
one of the episodes, in which
thousands of Armenians had
taken refuge in the cathedral at
L'rfa. which was then set alight
by the Turks The gallery beams
and wooden framework soon
caught fire, whereupon, block
ing the staircase leading to the
gallery with inflammable
materials, they left the mass of
struggling human beings to be
come prey to the flames
Parallels between the Jews in
World War II and the Arme
nians in World War 1 were
drawn by Adolf Hitler, and they
are very much comparable,
with one exception
The Armenians were on their
ancestral lands; and in 1915.
when they saw the murder and
rapine and plunder going on in
surrounding villages, such as
Van. Ourfa. Shabin Karahissar
and Musa Dagh put up re
sistance. But they were un
prepared their men had tÂ»een
drafted into the arm* months
before; and since the} were of
ficially lorbidden to possess
arms, all they had were
flintlocks Only Van and Musa
Dagh were saved, the first by
Russian troops, the second by
French warships.
On the surface, the claim that
Ottoman Government "trans
ported Armenians away from
war zone seems reasonable But
note the extent of the dis
semblance: There was no com
bat zone in 1895. when 300.OX)
Armenians were murdered, nor
in 1909. when 00.000 more were
killed As for 9 5. why deport
Armenians living 1000 miles
from the war zone, or the rest of
the million and a half who lived
more than 30) miles from that
zone?
To summarize: Most del mite
ly there was a premeditated
genocide of the Armenians by
the Turks There are more than
3'M dispatches in the prestigious
Sen York Times of 9 5-16. on
the subject Ottomans per
secuted all their subjects, and
the Turks still do. The Turks
want us to believe that what
they did to the Armenians the
latter did to them. Genocide
was mllicted on both the Arme
nians and the Jews, and both
went through a holocaust. The
words "deport" and "trans
port" (what irony tor the tor
mented caravans!) mean "an
nihilage."
I thank Koc for giving me this
opportunity to present the
Armenian case before Stanford
Academe.
