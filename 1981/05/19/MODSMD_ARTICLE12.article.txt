# Drama's 'Twelfth Night' has the elements of success
## 
### Marianne Villanueva 
The Stanford Drama Depart
ment's production of
Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,
which will be shown in Memori
al Auditorium from May 9 to
23, has all the elements tor a
successful evening: a plot full of
surprising twists and turns,
beautifully written love scenes,
and great comic characters.
The play takes place in the
make-believe kingdom of II-
Ivria, where the dominant
households are those of the Lady
Olivia and the Duke of Orsino.
The Duke is in love with Olivia,
but because of the recent death
of her brother, she has
cloistered herself in her man
sion and refuses to hear his suit.
Into this emotional impasse
come the twin brother and sis
ter, Sebastian and Viola, who
are cast on the shores of Illyria
after a shipwreck. Their pres
ence on the island complicates
matters, for Viola, who enters
into the service of the Duke
masquerading as a man, falls in
love with the Duke but is sent as

his emissary to woo 1 Olivia.
Olivia promptly falls in love
with Viola. Eventually, the
tangle of relationships gets re
solved, thanks to the late ap
pearance of Sebastian, and at
the end of the play — well, suf
fice it to say that Shakespeare
has loaded this play with so
many twists that the audience
will be kept guessing about the
final outcome for most of the
play's two-hour running time.
As usual, Shakespeare has
also provided a brilliant set of
supporting characters to spice
up the proceedings. There is
Feste the clown, whom Director
Jim Carmody describes as "one
of Shakespeare's greatest
fools." There is Malvolio. ser
vant to the Lady Olivia, perhaps
the one tragic character in this
generally light and happy com
edy, who falls in love with his
mistress and ends up being
driven off, Carmody says, "like
a dog with a tail between his
legs." There is the colorful
character of Sir Toby Belch —
man-about-town, degenerate

roustabout and lecher. There is
the hilarious, comic character
of the earthy Mauria. who lusts
after him. Finally, there is Sir
Andrew Aguecheek, the ef
feminate fop who fancies
himself a good match for the
Lady Olivia.
When Carmody, a doctofal
student in Drama who has
directed many previous produc
tions, was asked to explain what
his particular version of
Twelfth Niiiht was all about, he
explained that he was trying to
create "a dream world, a fan
tasy world that is not set in any
strict place or time." Although
the costumes, which were de
signed by Douglas Russell of the
Drama Department, are vague
ly inspired by late 18th century
fashions, and the background pi
ano music played by Dan
Birnbaum is mostly Chopin and
Beethoven, any false notions the
audience may entertain that
Shakespeare's play has been
transferred to Bth or 9th cen
tury Europe is dispelled by one
look at the fanciful set design.
A circular platform projects
several feet into the orchestra
pit and tilts upwards just
enough so that audiences can

get a glimpse of a swirling, pink
and green design. Behind the
platform, two huge disks with
faces stare out on either side of
what looks, at first glance, like a
series of little mountains, and at
the very back of the stage is a
mountain so tall and pointed
that it could almost be mistaken
for a tower.
Carmody says that in this pro
duction, he has "tried to resist
the usual caricatures." For ex
ample. in the role of Olivia, a
noblewoman with a great house
hold. Carmody says he cast "a
very young girl." Lisa Geller,
who plays Olivia, is a freshman
in the English Department and
has never acted in a play before.
Sir Toby Belch, who is usually
cast as "fat and ugly," is played
by Fritz Bruhn, who is "tall and
lean." Sir Andrew Aguecheek.
who is usually portrayed as
"old. spindly and impotent." is
played by an actor whom
Carmody describes as "young
and attractive." Thus, when
Olivia rejects his advances, she
does so not because of re
pugnance to his physical ap
pearance. but because he is
weak and spineless.
The priest who emerges at the

end of the play to perform the
marriage ceremonies is played
by a woman, and so is the char
acter of Fabian, Feste's side
kick. Carmody insists that in
doing this he was "not trying to
make any sexual statement,"
but trying to emphasize the tact
that Illyria "is a fantasy world
where any character can be any
thing."
The whole production was
budgeted at just $1200. which is,
as Rathman points out, "dirt
cheap by professional stan
dards."
A lot ot ingenuity went into
building the set. The disk-like
clouds were made out ot what
Rathman calls "Sona tubes."
which he says is a kind of mate
rial used frequently in industry.
The tubes were cut into two-inch
wide segments, glued together
with polyurethane toam, and
painted over with metallic paint
to give them a bronze sheen.
The play makes hardly any
use of props and furniture.
Carmody says, "This is a very
stripped-away production. We
wanted to concentrate on the
lanuuanc."

himself a good match for the
Lady Olivia.
When Carmody, a doctofal
student in Drama who has
directed many previous produc
tions, was asked to explain what
his particular version of
Twelfth Niiiht was all about, he
explained that he was trying to
create "a dream world, a fan
tasy world that is not set in any
strict place or time." Although
the costumes, which were de
signed by Douglas Russell of the
Drama Department, are vague
ly inspired by late 18th century
fashions, and the background pi
ano music played by Dan
Birnbaum is mostly Chopin and
Beethoven, any false notions the
audience may entertain that
Shakespeare's play has been
transferred to Bth or 9th cen
tury Europe is dispelled by one
look at the fanciful set design.
A circular platform projects
several feet into the orchestra
pit and tilts upwards just
enough so that audiences can

get a glimpse of a swirling, pink
and green design. Behind the
platform, two huge disks with
faces stare out on either side of
what looks, at first glance, like a
series of little mountains, and at
the very back of the stage is a
mountain so tall and pointed
that it could almost be mistaken
for a tower.
Carmody says that in this pro
duction, he has "tried to resist
the usual caricatures." For ex
ample. in the role of Olivia, a
noblewoman with a great house
hold. Carmody says he cast "a
very young girl." Lisa Geller,
who plays Olivia, is a freshman
in the English Department and
has never acted in a play before.
Sir Toby Belch, who is usually
cast as "fat and ugly," is played
by Fritz Bruhn, who is "tall and
lean." Sir Andrew Aguecheek.
who is usually portrayed as
"old. spindly and impotent." is
played by an actor whom
Carmody describes as "young
and attractive." Thus, when
Olivia rejects his advances, she
does so not because of re
pugnance to his physical ap
pearance. but because he is
weak and spineless.
The priest who emerges at the

end of the play to perform the
marriage ceremonies is played
by a woman, and so is the char
acter of Fabian, Feste's side
kick. Carmody insists that in
doing this he was "not trying to
make any sexual statement,"
but trying to emphasize the tact
that Illyria "is a fantasy world
where any character can be any
thing."
The whole production was
budgeted at just $1200. which is,
as Rathman points out, "dirt
cheap by professional stan
dards."
A lot ot ingenuity went into
building the set. The disk-like
clouds were made out ot what
Rathman calls "Sona tubes."
which he says is a kind of mate
rial used frequently in industry.
The tubes were cut into two-inch
wide segments, glued together
with polyurethane toam, and
painted over with metallic paint
to give them a bronze sheen.
The play makes hardly any
use of props and furniture.
Carmody says, "This is a very
stripped-away production. We
wanted to concentrate on the
lanuuanc."

Malvolio (Rush Rehm) declares his love for Olivia (Lisa Geller) as Feste (Lome Buchgman) grins,
in the Stanford Drama Departments production of Sharkespeare?s comedy, 'Twelfth Night.' The play
begins tonight at 8:30 in Memorial Auditorium, and is scheduled to run through this Saturday. Tickets
are $4 general admission and $1 for students, and are available at Tresidder.
The Stanford Drama Depart
ment's production of
Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,
which will be shown in Memori
al Auditorium from May 9 to
23, has all the elements tor a
successful evening: a plot full of
surprising twists and turns,
beautifully written love scenes,
and great comic characters.
The play takes place in the
make-believe kingdom of II-
Ivria, where the dominant
households are those of the Lady
Olivia and the Duke of Orsino.
The Duke is in love with Olivia,
but because of the recent death
of her brother, she has
cloistered herself in her man
sion and refuses to hear his suit.
Into this emotional impasse
come the twin brother and sis
ter, Sebastian and Viola, who
are cast on the shores of Illyria
after a shipwreck. Their pres
ence on the island complicates
matters, for Viola, who enters
into the service of the Duke
masquerading as a man, falls in
love with the Duke but is sent as

his emissary to woo 1 Olivia.
Olivia promptly falls in love
with Viola. Eventually, the
tangle of relationships gets re
solved, thanks to the late ap
pearance of Sebastian, and at
the end of the play — well, suf
fice it to say that Shakespeare
has loaded this play with so
many twists that the audience
will be kept guessing about the
final outcome for most of the
play's two-hour running time.
As usual, Shakespeare has
also provided a brilliant set of
supporting characters to spice
up the proceedings. There is
Feste the clown, whom Director
Jim Carmody describes as "one
of Shakespeare's greatest
fools." There is Malvolio. ser
vant to the Lady Olivia, perhaps
the one tragic character in this
generally light and happy com
edy, who falls in love with his
mistress and ends up being
driven off, Carmody says, "like
a dog with a tail between his
legs." There is the colorful
character of Sir Toby Belch —
man-about-town, degenerate

roustabout and lecher. There is
the hilarious, comic character
of the earthy Mauria. who lusts
after him. Finally, there is Sir
Andrew Aguecheek, the ef
feminate fop who fancies
himself a good match for the
Lady Olivia.
