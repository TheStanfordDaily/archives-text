# Panel claims Israeli occupation of West Bank represses academic life
## 
### Todd Pickett 
For Palestinian students on
the West Bank, university life
has become a struggle for
educational freedom against the
yoke of Israeli censorship, ac
cording to a panel of three pro
fessors who spoke at CERAS
Thursday night
Tight restrictions on educa
tional material, suspensions
and expulsions of students and
faculty, and the prevention of
student and faculty associations
has helped to fuel the recent
demonstrations that have
erupted against the Israeli mili
tary occupation of the territory,
according to the panel's report.
The panel was part of a team
of eight professors sent -by the
Association of Arab American
Graduate Students to view the
situation of Palestinian stu
dents in the territory occupied
by Israel since the Arab-Israeli
war of 1967.
Regulations governing the
three universities on the West
Bank were set forth by Military
Order 854 which the Israeli gov
ernment said was aimed at rais
ing the standard of higher
education there, according to
Professor Hayden White of UC-
Santa Cruz.
White warned that the aca
demic policies imposed on the
Palestinian students must be
viewed within the context of Is
rael's greater policies of co
lonization of the West Bank.
The regulations, which pre
viously applied only to elemen
tary and secondary schools, in
clude a ban on more than 100
books. One-third of these books
were children's books, many of
which are traditional Palesti

nian stones, said Frederic
Jamesop. professor of French
at Yale .University. The ap
proved teaching materials often
take one or two years for de
livery and are subject to high
taxes not imposed on materials
received by Israeli universities,
said Jameson. , '
According to the panel, the
most serious forms of harrass
ment involve the restrictions
placed on individual students
and faculty. Faculty members
can rarely obtain permits tor
longer than six months, while
some permits grant visits of
less than a month, said
Jameson.

"It is obviously very difficult
for such institutions to recruit
faculty." said Jameson, who
added that permits are some
times arbitrarily denied Pro
fessors vfaiting the West Bank
universities must submit a man
uscript of their lecture one
month in advance accompanied
by a list from the university of
those attending the lecture.
Restrictions against the es
tablishment of faculty associa
tions and a wide range of stu
dent groups and labor unions has
also evolved in Israeli attempts
to eliminate any organized op
position against the military oc
cupation, said Miyoshi

The censorship of Palestinian
newspapers by the Israeli gov
ernment distorts facts that sug
gest the Israelis might be to
blame tor the uprisings, said
Miyoshi
According to the report, the
Israeli attempt to subdue
Palestinian nationalism has on
the contrary increased national
consciousness and resistance
against the Israeli occupation of
the territory.
