# S.J. State 'Daily Spartan' deeply in debt, could fold
## 
### Mike Oneal 
The San Jose State Spartan
Daily, now floundering under a
$16,000 debt, faces the danger of
folding entirely it it does not de
velop a consistent source of fun
ding soon. University and stu
dent officials report.
The student-run newspaper,
although it is tied to the journal
ism department in a laboratory
capacity, has been deriving its
revenue solely from advertising
for more than three years. Late
ly, it has fallen prey to inflation
and an advertising public that is
wary of the commuter nature of
the students attending San Jose
State. The paper has been hard
put to find customers exactly

when they need them most.
Last week, the student body
voted for the "Automatic Fund
ing Initiative," a program of
funds allocated to various ac
tivities at the University, which
will give the Spartan Daily
$25,00). Editor Wayne Norton
says that is not enough.
"The $25*.')00 will pay off the
debt, but that doesn't leave us
much for start-up costs next se
mester, and then we're in the
same boat again with the ad
vertising,'" he said.
"We'll have a paper next se
mester, but I can't say anything
about after that," he added.
The Associated Students of
San Jose State University
(called the Associated Stu
dents), donated funds to the pa
per until four years ago when
the two organizations had a dis
pute. The Spartan Daily
thought the Associated Students
were trying to exact too much
control over the editorial side of
the paper and the Associated
Students felt they had that right
because they were providing the
funds, said Norton.
Since then, the paper and the
Associated Students have been
at odds, neither wanting any in
volvement with the other.
The Associated Students are
now fighting the Automatic
Funding Initiative because they
feel it is invalid, according to
Associated Students President
Mike Medina. There is a possi
bility they will take the issue to
court.
"The Automatic Funding In
itiative was meant to fund non
curricular activities," said Me
dina. "I have no problem with
the paper itself, every campus
needs a student newspaper, but
I have a problem with the cur
rent editorial staff. They need
their own subscription or depen
dable source ot funding. If cur
ricular activities (like the
Spartan Daily) start dipping
into AFI funds, where does that
stop?"
Norton said he agrees that the

Spartan Dail\ should contract
some other, constant torm of
funding but differs with Medina
on the initiative issue
"He (Medina) wouldn't like
the initiative either way, be
cause it takes funds away from
tne Associated Students' pro
grams," Norton said. "I think
student opinion was made pret
ty clear at the ballot box. The in
itiative cleared 2-'. If the stu
dents want to support it, I don't
see how there could be any prob
lem, but the Associated Stu
dents are fighting it tooth and
nail."
There are very few other fun
ding ideas available to the paper
now. The options are: straight
University funding, direct stu
dent payment or subscription
ias is done at Stanford) and the
Tnstructionally Related Ac
tivities'" fund which now gives
most ot its money to the Athletic
Department, and is not likely to
change because of the lucrative
proceeds the University re
ceives from athletic events. All
ot those options are imprac
tical, University officials and
student leaders agree.
"The University is fairly
committed to supporting the
Spartan Daily, but it ought to
succeed by advertising and sub
scription," said acting Academ
ic Vice-President Robert
Sasseen.
The journalism department
would like to see the University
fund the paper and feels it would
be a serious detriment to the
print-journalism program if it
went out of business, said Jour
nalism Prof. Robert Till
inghast.
"It would be tragic if we lost
the paper," Tillinghast said.
"The quality of the paper is al
ready slipping because ot lack of
funds. A lot ot students come
here because of the paper and
losing it would definitely hurt
the program. We've had the
Spartan Daily since 1934, and
I'd like to see it at least cele
brate its 50th anniversary."

will give the Spartan Daily
$25,00). Editor Wayne Norton
says that is not enough.
"The $25*.')00 will pay off the
debt, but that doesn't leave us
much for start-up costs next se
mester, and then we're in the
same boat again with the ad
vertising,'" he said.
"We'll have a paper next se
mester, but I can't say anything
about after that," he added.
The Associated Students of
San Jose State University
(called the Associated Stu
dents), donated funds to the pa
per until four years ago when
the two organizations had a dis
pute. The Spartan Daily
thought the Associated Students
were trying to exact too much
control over the editorial side of
the paper and the Associated
Students felt they had that right
because they were providing the
funds, said Norton.
Since then, the paper and the
Associated Students have been
at odds, neither wanting any in
volvement with the other.
The Associated Students are
now fighting the Automatic
Funding Initiative because they
feel it is invalid, according to
Associated Students President
Mike Medina. There is a possi
bility they will take the issue to
court.
"The Automatic Funding In
itiative was meant to fund non
curricular activities," said Me
dina. "I have no problem with
the paper itself, every campus
needs a student newspaper, but
I have a problem with the cur
rent editorial staff. They need
their own subscription or depen
dable source ot funding. If cur
ricular activities (like the
Spartan Daily) start dipping
into AFI funds, where does that
stop?"
Norton said he agrees that the

Spartan Dail\ should contract
some other, constant torm of
funding but differs with Medina
on the initiative issue
"He (Medina) wouldn't like
the initiative either way, be
cause it takes funds away from
tne Associated Students' pro
grams," Norton said. "I think
student opinion was made pret
ty clear at the ballot box. The in
itiative cleared 2-'. If the stu
dents want to support it, I don't
see how there could be any prob
lem, but the Associated Stu
dents are fighting it tooth and
nail."
There are very few other fun
ding ideas available to the paper
now. The options are: straight
University funding, direct stu
dent payment or subscription
ias is done at Stanford) and the
Tnstructionally Related Ac
tivities'" fund which now gives
most ot its money to the Athletic
Department, and is not likely to
change because of the lucrative
proceeds the University re
ceives from athletic events. All
ot those options are imprac
tical, University officials and
student leaders agree.
"The University is fairly
committed to supporting the
Spartan Daily, but it ought to
succeed by advertising and sub
scription," said acting Academ
ic Vice-President Robert
Sasseen.
The journalism department
would like to see the University
fund the paper and feels it would
be a serious detriment to the
print-journalism program if it
went out of business, said Jour
nalism Prof. Robert Till
inghast.
"It would be tragic if we lost
the paper," Tillinghast said.
"The quality of the paper is al
ready slipping because ot lack of
funds. A lot ot students come
here because of the paper and
losing it would definitely hurt
the program. We've had the
Spartan Daily since 1934, and
I'd like to see it at least cele
brate its 50th anniversary."
The San Jose State Spartan
Daily, now floundering under a
$16,000 debt, faces the danger of
folding entirely it it does not de
velop a consistent source of fun
ding soon. University and stu
dent officials report.
The student-run newspaper,
although it is tied to the journal
ism department in a laboratory
capacity, has been deriving its
revenue solely from advertising
for more than three years. Late
ly, it has fallen prey to inflation
and an advertising public that is
wary of the commuter nature of
the students attending San Jose
State. The paper has been hard
put to find customers exactly

when they need them most.
Last week, the student body
voted for the "Automatic Fund
ing Initiative," a program of
funds allocated to various ac
tivities at the University, which
will give the Spartan Daily
$25,00). Editor Wayne Norton
says that is not enough.
"The $25*.')00 will pay off the
debt, but that doesn't leave us
much for start-up costs next se
mester, and then we're in the
