## Jimmy Cliff, charged and hungry, plays to Waldorf 
### J. Raymond Mills Don Willenburg 
With no fanfare, no hyped in
troduction, not even an an
nouncement, Jimmy Cliff began
his show at San Francisco's Old
Waldorf with a single spotlight
shining on his hands beating a
deep, rhythmic bongo drum in
troduction to the opening song.
The focus was on the vibrant
reggae sound, and not the per
former: an act not of humility,
but of deliberate under
statement to emphasize the
prjmacy ot the message and leel
of reggae music.
Still, the audience responded
to Cliff the performer, and by
the end ot a set that included
The Harder They Come-era
songs as well as enticing new
material, they were in tune with
what Cliff calls the "universal
vibrations" underlying his mu
sic.
Most Americans' exposure to
reggae has been limited to rec
ords receiving tragically min
imal airplay. As fine as some of

those recordings have been, reg
gae is not an art form that is eas
ily reducible to technological re
production. Live reggae is a mu
sic ot expression and motion,
and even though the Old
Waldorf's dinner seating
eliminated the dance floor, Cliff
proved himself a master of com
municating motion and emotion
to an audience lar from reg
gae's home in Jamaica.
Cliff is working to "reroot"
and recreate the pure drive of
that reggae that emerged from
its rock steady roots in Jamaica
during the late 19605. He is con
fident that American audiences
will eventually appreciate reg
gae as much as do Jamaican lis
teners. The audience response
at the Old Waldort was typical
of what Cliff has encountered on
his recent American tour. "You
can see the increase in the au
diences, in closeness to the mu
sic," he said.
The composition of the au
dience. overwhelmingly white
with a few Rastafarians

sprinkled about the crowd, was
also typical of reggae audiences
in America. Cliff feels that
whites can relate to and in some
senses "understand the
message better than blacks" be
cause they "see the music trom
a cultural level."
He noted that "black Ameri
cans have a music form that fits
into their lifestyle, that's as
much a part of their lifestyle as
reggae is for Jamaicans." This
makes it harder to introduce
them to a new music than
whites, who are used to trends
and relating to music as an in
tellectual ancillary to personal
experience of culture.
Cliff is eager to reach Ameri
can blacks and says he is recep
tive to influences from Afro-
American music. Cliff's new
album, entitled I Am The Liu
inn, which is due to be released
by MCA records in July, fea
tures vocals by American soul
singer Deniece Williams. "I
would like to tour with an Afro-
American group in this country.

that's what's needed to bring
reggae music to black people
here," he said That may not be
until after Cliff is satisfied that
he has remastered the basics of
his reggae music: his nine-piece
Jamaican band is on a solo tour,
and he emphasized that his up
coming album would be "strict
ly reggae."
"I really love to feel the vi
brations from all over the
earth," Cliff said Modern popu
lar music groups like the Police,
the Clash, and the English Beat,
are indicative of the "universal
vibrations" that Cliff feels are
the driving force behind reg
gae's current upsurge in popu
larity. "I feel gratified that
they're taking part in something
1 helped to create," Cliff said,
"but I think they should do
something more creative with
it."
Cliff credited much of reg
gae's initial impetus and purest
expression to "brother Bob
Marley," who died while Cliff
was in San Francisco. The two
had worked together before
either left Jamaica, and Cliff re
turned to Kingstown for yester
day's services.
"There was a time in Jamai
ca when the police would catch
you and cut off your dreadlocks
(a Rastafari hairstyle symbol
izing oneness and rebellion).
Reggae music is the cry ot op
pressed people ... for love, for
justice, for identity, for accep
tance. Rastafari was born ot
this spirit."
Against this background,
"Bob was the first one who
stood up and said let your natty
dreads fly — be proud and give
courage to others.' " Still,
Marley's death does not mean
the fight is over: "He has fin
ished his work here and he has
gone on to work on a higher
plane." Cliff requested a period

oi silence from the audience at
three oi his tour San Francisco
shows in tribute to Marley, and
audiences showed so much re
spect that Cliff said "you could
just teel the vibrations."
The first song of the set was
"Bongo Man." which serves
double duty on his next album
(due in July) and as the title
track of Cliff's upcoming movie.
The movie features Cliff in a
starring role for the first time
since The Harder They Come,
and its soundtrack LP brought
him and reggae music attention
in the United States for the first
time. The film contains footage
from a tour of South Africa that
Cliff made last year.
"Africa is the biggest place
for reggae music on the whole
planet. I went to South Africa
and the reaction was incredible.
We played in Soweto, a black
town, it was tense, exciting and
very emotional at the same
time. The brothers there cried
— it was the greatest event of
my career."
The last stop on Cliff's South
African tour was Cape Town,
where he performed before a
desegregated audience for "the
first time in that government's
rule." It was also the only place
that he had ever played "Ma
jority Rule" which was to be the
title track of his next album.
The South African govern
ment claimed the song was re
sponsible for the next day's stu
dent riots. "They told me that if
I titled my new album Majority
Rule they would not print it.
they would not distribute it,
they would not sell it, they
would not let me enter the coun
try again and they would issue a
warrant for my arrest on
charges of inciting revolution.
So I said I'd title it Give The
People What They Want, and
everything was alright."

Jimmy Cliff is not playing
reggae music for Americans, the
way a travel agent shows slides
of some mystical alien culture.
He says he is singing the "same
message" to Americans as to
Jamaicans — even the political
message that he teels was part
ly responsible tor last year's
change in the Jamaican govern
ment. The message, like the
music, has a universal appeal,
since "it is the same system
that rules in Jamaica, that rules
in America, that rules in Eng
land."
Many ot reggae's. and Cliff's,
finest songs are bitter protests
against that system and its ef
fect on the oppressed. "When I
leel bitter, I feel hunger." said
Cliff, placing his fist against his
stomach Then, raising his hand
to face level, "and when I sing, I
express the hunger and the bit

terness I teel."
Reggae's response to this de
humanizing system is not
further conflict and hate, but an
emotional vision of oneness, in
tegrity. and love. Cliff feels that
the social possibilities of these
visions are demonstrated every
time a reggae band takes the
stage. Society "is like the mu
sic. You have nine people up
there — but they mus: make one
music. Nine different person
alities — but they must make
one music."
The one music Cliff and his
band played at the Old Waldorf
was tresh. charged, and in
spired. The energy and quality
of his performance lends new
hope that acceptance of the spir
it and messages ot reggae will
follow the increasing popular
success of the music.
