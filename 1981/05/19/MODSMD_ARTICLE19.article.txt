# Eureka's 'Fefu': moments of freedom in eight lives
## 
### Stephen Nash 
'Fetu and her Friends' by Maria Irene Fornes is
about eight women. It's not about pivotal events in
their lives, or about psychological motivations for
their behavior or even about Women as a political
movement; it's about a very particular group of
eight women who have come to Fefu's New Eng
land house one spring afternoon in '935 to plan an
educatiortal meeting. To be sure, there are politi
cal ideas mentioned, and these women are not so
idiosyncratic as to be unrecognizable; but trying
to'interpret' the play seems to destroy much of its
magic.
'Fefu' has at its center an unusual theatrical de
vice. During the middle part of the play, the au
dience is split into four sections. Each group is led
to a different room in the theatre to see a different
scene. The four scenes are performed simultane
ously. and they also interact with one another.
When the four scenes have finished, the groups
are rotated and the process is repeated until each
group has seen all four scenes. v '
These four scenes do not just form the physical
center of the play. They are also at its intellectual
center, indicating how we should react to the play
as a whole. First ot all, there is the fact that they
are going on at the same time. When scenes are
performed sequentially, it is natural to wonder
why one scene was placed before another. This
leads to questions about motivation of events,
drawing attention away from individual scenes
toward the flow of the complete play. It also tends
to emphasize the function of characters at the ex
pense of their personality. A good example is
Shakespeare's 'Othello' where we are more in
terested in how lago manipulates the other char
acters than in lago himself.
Secondly, there is the increased intimacy be
tween the audience and actors during scenes,
When characters are on a raised stage at some
distance from the audience, they are often seen as
archetypes. This generates even more questions
of motivation and function. When the characters
are seen up close, in an ordinary room, the gap be
tween the audience and performer is almost com
pletely wiped out, along with all the portentious
ness that accompanies it.
What is left is a collection ot scenes with women
relating to each other as women, scenes linked to
gether by a number ot motifs. Central to the play

is Fefu (played by Linda Hoy, who starred in the
Eureka Theatre's last production 'Mary
Barnes'). Not only does her ebullient character
provide much energy, she also illustrates one ot
the principle themes. Fetu, despite her powerful
and independent personality, is still dependent on
men. This dependence (or subservience) is also il
lustrated by Julia (Leslie Harrell), a visionary
woman who has so internalized oppression that
she has'made herself unable to walk.
The other central theme is the need for women
to establish their own forms of community. This is
most explicitly stated by Cecilia (Mary Jo
Pearson) during a monologue in part 111, but it is
implicit in all the situations in the play. Whether it
be planning a conference, organizing lunch, or
working out an affair, the women define for them
selves those relationships which serve their
needs.
These and other themes are generally near the
surface of the play, but at the beginning of part 111
they are clearly stated in a series of very abstract
monologues. Not only does this preaching in
terfere with the intimate balance between actor
and audience set up in part 11, but the monologues
are difficult to understand and out ot character
with the rest of the writing. They are lacking in
concrete images, making them seem artificial,
especially alter scenes of croquet and soup-mak
ing. Far more magical is the water-fight which
follows them.
It is the many small-scale (but certainly not in
significant) moments which make this play mem
orable. Its power does not come from political
speech-making. It is via gestures, games, and oth
er nearly-trivial shared experiences that the play
comes to life.
The direction (by Alma Becker with Laura
Barberian) is very successful at establishing the
delicate flow from one scene or mood to another,
and the naturalistic sets (by Pat Monk) provide an
approachable background for the action. From a
whole collection ot good performances, special
thanks to Mary Jo Pearson tor her elegant and elo
quent Cecilia, and especially to Linda Hoy for her
wide-ranging portrayal ot Fetu.
