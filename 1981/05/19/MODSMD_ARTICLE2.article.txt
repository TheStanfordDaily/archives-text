## 
### 
Santa Cruz (AP) â€” Police in five
Bay Area cities searched yesterday
for possible links between at least 1'
unsolved cases and David Joseph
Carpenter, the stuttering printer
charged in one of eight trailside tor
ture slayings.
Carpenter, 51, an ex-convict with a
history of violent crime, was ar
raigned yesterday in Santa Cruz on
one count of murder and one count of
attempted murder in the shooting
death of Ellen Hansen, 20, and the
wounding of her companion, Stephen
Haertle, 20.
The attack occured while the pair
were hiking through Henry Cowell
Redwood State Park on March 29.
Haertle reportedly picked Carpenter
from a police lineup Friday as the man
responsible for the attack.
In yesterday's proceedings, Munici
pal Judge Richard McAdams agreed
to allow Carpenter to delay entering a
plea until June 8. He also granted a re
quest by Carpenter's attorney, Public
Defender Larry Biggam, to seal all af
fidavits in the case, including the
search and arrest warrants.
McAdams also ordered that
Carpenter be held without bail.
Carpenter, arrested Friday, as been

charged only in the Hansen killing, but
Marin County Sheriff A 1 Howenstein
has labeled him a suspect in at least
five of the other seven trailside kill
ings at Mount Tamalpais and Point
Reyes over the past 21 months.
No formal charges have been filed
in those deaths, but Howenstein said a
ballistics link has been established
among the killings.
"We have the luxury ol having this
individual in custody, so we are pursu
ing all our investigative leads and set
ting about building our case. We don't
feel compelled to have this wrapped
up tomorrow or the day alter," said
Jerry Herman of the Marin County
District. Attorney's office in San
Ratael.
Meanwhile, police in San Jose, San
Francisco, Daly City and Santa Cruz
have reopened several murder cases
and one missing person case in looking
tor a possible connection to the
trailside killings.
San Francisco homicide detectives
said they were probing links between
Carpenter and the October 29 slaying
of Mary Bennett, 23, who was stabbed
to death and buried in a shallow grave
in the city.
They declined to release details
about the second killing except to say
that there were "similarities" be
tween the case and the trailside
murders.
In Santa Cruz, investigators are
probing the possibility that Carpenter
may have been involved in the '979
deaths of two Santa Cruz women.
Authorities in Daly City have
launched a new investigation into the
case of Anna Kelly Menjivar, 17, who
has been missing since December. Or
iginally listed as a missing person
case, police reopened their investiga
tion after learning Minjivar and
Carpenter had been friends.
Police became interested in
Carpenter after Heather Skaggs, 20,
disappeared on May 2, the same day
she had planned to meet Carpenter at
a store near her San Jose home.
Carpenter and Skaggs worked togeth
er at the California Trade School in
Havward.
