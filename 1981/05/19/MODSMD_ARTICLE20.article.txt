# Coffee House hosts 'Gamma Rays'
## 
### Jane Wollenberg 
How does student theatre con
tinue to thrive on a university
campus such as Stanford, with
San Francisco next door and
Reagan in the White House?
Well, to be frank, I'm not sure.
However, the calendar this sea
son proves beyond a doubt that,
like Tillie and her marigolds,
flowers grow out of nowhere. So
it is with Stanford theatre.
If you had the good fortune of
being at the Coffee House last
week around midnight you could
have witnessed an example of
what theatre once was or should
be — a gift, a marvelous sur
prise, intimate, free, insightful,
and moving.
Against all odds — the hour, a
midnight rehearsal schedule,
the space, midterms, a full dra
matic season — a group of peo
ple gave of themselves to a

packed Coffee House of friends
and regulars.
They started with Paul
Zindel's poignant, superbly
written play The Effect of (lam
ma Rays on Man in the Moon
Marigolds, which won both a
New York Drama Critic Circle
award and a Pulitzer prize. It is
an aching slice of the life of a
family exposed to "too much."
The mother. Beatrice, doesn't
get dressed any more, but
smokes, drinks, complains,
cries, and suffers. She has been
ridiculed and divorced by life
and its inhabitants from an ear
ly age.
She takes out her frustrations
on her daughters. Her two
daughters are also powerless
and would seem to be doomed to
a similarly derelict existence.
One daughter, Ruth, has been
marred by some tragic history

(never revealed> which has left
her a half-person.
The other daughter, Tilly, has
also suffered the bitterness of a
mother whose dreams have all
died. Somehow, out of this desti
tute environment. Tilly sees the
unlimited horizon of science
and. like some of the mutant
marigolds, grows stronger and
survives. They live in an old
vegetable store with papered
over front windows, with a rab
bit and a living corpse whom
they babysit tor $50 a week.
Marigolds is a naturalistic de
piction of their world when Tilly
wins a science award and starts
to bloom.
Transforming the Coffee
House into a vegetable-store
turned-living-area is not an easy
task. That was part of the
challenge, charm and problem
ot this production ot Marigolds.
There are no curtains, no seats,
no light grids, and no money in
the Cotfee House. The lighting
by Rachel Mikva was an exam
ple ot making magic out of noth
ing. It was effective, natural,
and what the play called for.
The crumpled newspaper nat
uralism went a long way
towards establishing the dec
adence and decay. Rebecca De-
George, as director, did an ad
mirable job of using the space
(what little there was). The
movement was uncontrived and
fluid for the most part.
There were some problems
with the placement of the
scenes that occured at the
school; Somehow they needed to
be more differentiated from the
house. Yet, considering the
physical limitations imposed by
"Pub Theatre," theydidacom
mendable job.
As for the acting, in every

role it was both committed and
superb Once the usual opening
night nerves were gone, the
show took otf. Janet Heimlich
as Beatrice, the mother, had the
most difficult role. Playing a
character much older than one
self, but not old. is a difficult ac
ting challenge. From the begin
ning she captured the bitterness
and decadence of the character.
Unfortunately, her character
was too large for the intimate
staging and she lost some hu
manness as a result. The mater
nal element, the dignity, and the
age of the character weren't
there, but by the end she had be
come pitiable and restrained
her energy, thereby aging the
characters Part of the problem
could have been that Zindel
shows us Beatrice's character
before and explaining her.
Lisa Jacobson, as the daugh
ter whose marigolds have al
lowed some sun into the fami
ly's darkened world, gave a fine
performance. She was very
much like her rabbit: tentative
and frightened. She didn't quite
develop any strength when talk
ing about her flowers or science.
But when she looked at her
mother with tears and said "no
body laughed at me" everybody
in the audience was hers.
Tracy Grey, as Nanny, was
old and half alive — exactly
right, considering that age is not
easy to portray well. What
thoughts were behind her
smile? Any pain? Any aware
ness ot the indignity ol her situ
ation? Perhaps she represents a
full life in contrast to the half
lives of the family.
If you missed Marinnlds that
is unfortunate, for it was a fine
production of a provoking play.

no light grids, and no money in
the Cotfee House. The lighting
by Rachel Mikva was an exam
ple ot making magic out of noth
ing. It was effective, natural,
and what the play called for.
The crumpled newspaper nat
uralism went a long way
towards establishing the dec
adence and decay. Rebecca De-
George, as director, did an ad
mirable job of using the space
(what little there was). The
movement was uncontrived and
fluid for the most part.
There were some problems
with the placement of the
scenes that occured at the
school; Somehow they needed to
be more differentiated from the
house. Yet, considering the
physical limitations imposed by
"Pub Theatre," theydidacom
mendable job.
As for the acting, in every

role it was both committed and
superb Once the usual opening
night nerves were gone, the
show took otf. Janet Heimlich
as Beatrice, the mother, had the
most difficult role. Playing a
character much older than one
self, but not old. is a difficult ac
ting challenge. From the begin
ning she captured the bitterness
and decadence of the character.
Unfortunately, her character
was too large for the intimate
staging and she lost some hu
manness as a result. The mater
nal element, the dignity, and the
age of the character weren't
there, but by the end she had be
come pitiable and restrained
her energy, thereby aging the
characters Part of the problem
could have been that Zindel
shows us Beatrice's character
before and explaining her.
Lisa Jacobson, as the daugh
ter whose marigolds have al
lowed some sun into the fami
ly's darkened world, gave a fine
performance. She was very
much like her rabbit: tentative
and frightened. She didn't quite
develop any strength when talk
ing about her flowers or science.
But when she looked at her
mother with tears and said "no
body laughed at me" everybody
in the audience was hers.
Tracy Grey, as Nanny, was
old and half alive — exactly
right, considering that age is not
easy to portray well. What
thoughts were behind her
smile? Any pain? Any aware
ness ot the indignity ol her situ
ation? Perhaps she represents a
full life in contrast to the half
lives of the family.
If you missed Marinnlds that
is unfortunate, for it was a fine
production of a provoking play.
How does student theatre con
tinue to thrive on a university
campus such as Stanford, with
San Francisco next door and
Reagan in the White House?
Well, to be frank, I'm not sure.
However, the calendar this sea
son proves beyond a doubt that,
like Tillie and her marigolds,
flowers grow out of nowhere. So
it is with Stanford theatre.
If you had the good fortune of
being at the Coffee House last
week around midnight you could
have witnessed an example of
what theatre once was or should
be — a gift, a marvelous sur
prise, intimate, free, insightful,
and moving.
Against all odds — the hour, a
midnight rehearsal schedule,
the space, midterms, a full dra
matic season — a group of peo
ple gave of themselves to a

packed Coffee House of friends
and regulars.
They started with Paul
Zindel's poignant, superbly
written play The Effect of (lam
ma Rays on Man in the Moon
Marigolds, which won both a
New York Drama Critic Circle
award and a Pulitzer prize. It is
an aching slice of the life of a
family exposed to "too much."
The mother. Beatrice, doesn't
get dressed any more, but
smokes, drinks, complains,
cries, and suffers. She has been
ridiculed and divorced by life
and its inhabitants from an ear
ly age.
She takes out her frustrations
on her daughters. Her two
daughters are also powerless
and would seem to be doomed to
a similarly derelict existence.
One daughter, Ruth, has been
marred by some tragic history

(never revealed> which has left
her a half-person.
The other daughter, Tilly, has
also suffered the bitterness of a
mother whose dreams have all
died. Somehow, out of this desti
tute environment. Tilly sees the
unlimited horizon of science
and. like some of the mutant
marigolds, grows stronger and
survives. They live in an old
vegetable store with papered
over front windows, with a rab
bit and a living corpse whom
they babysit tor $50 a week.
Marigolds is a naturalistic de
piction of their world when Tilly
wins a science award and starts
to bloom.
Transforming the Coffee
House into a vegetable-store
turned-living-area is not an easy
task. That was part of the
challenge, charm and problem
ot this production ot Marigolds.
There are no curtains, no seats,
no light grids, and no money in
