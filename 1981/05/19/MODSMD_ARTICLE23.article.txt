Inf 1 plot ruled out in pope attack
Rome — Police investigating the shooting ot Pope
John Paul II said yesterday there was only a "very,
very remote" chance the accused gunman was part
of an international conspiracy.
While Interpol agents in other countries were
checking statements made by the suspect. Mehmet
Ali Agca, about his travels since fleeing a Turkish
prison. Italian authorities circulated pictures of two
ot his hometown friends to Italian newspapers.
In Turkey, three people are now in custody tor
their alleged roles in helping Agca obtain the false
passport found on him after Wednesday's shooting.
Agca is charged with attempted murder of the
pope, whose recovery had progressed enough yes
terday to allow him to be moved out of the intensive
care unit at Gemelli Policlinico Hospital. Yesterday
was the pontiff's 61st birthday.
Alfredo Lazzerini. chief of the anti-terrorist po
lice squad and head of the papal shooting investiga
tion. said there is no evidence the two whose pic
tures are being circulated were ever in Italy or in
volved in the pope's shooting. He said authorities
are trying to check them out to determine it they
may have aided Agca in the 18 months between his
prison escape and the pope's shooting
"He (Agca) may have been a hired killer, or he
may not have been," Lazzerini told The Associated
Press. "As for an international conspiracy, it's a
very, very remote possibility."
The pope left the intensive care unit yesterday
and moved to an 11th floor hospital suite with a view
ot the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City,
where 6000 people attended a birthday Mass.
Running a slight temperature and still ted in
travenously as he recovered from bullet wounds suf
fered in the assassination attempt, the Polish-born
pontiff sat up in his new hospital bed and conferred
with Cardinal Rubin Wladyslaw, a fellow Pole now
based in Rome.
"It all went nice and easy." a hospital spokesman
said ot the pope's transfer from the third-floor in
tensive care ward to a suite of six rooms for the
pope, his doctors and nurses and Vatican officials.
Japan may house US nukes
Tokyo — The Japanese government suffered a
new shock yesterday when a former U.S. am
bassador to Japan asserted that nuclear-armed
American Navy ships have routinely been permitted
to dock at Japanese ports.
The comments by former Ambassador Edwin Re
ischauer conflicted with two decades of denials by
Japanese governments that American nuclear arms
have been allowed into this country's waters.
His account, denied again yesterday by the gov
ernment. touched off a stormy controversy, with op
position parties accusing officials ot lying tor 21
years Nuclear weaponry is one of the touchiest is
sues in Japan, which was atom-bombed in World
War 11. and a succession of governments has tried to
avoid the question of whether U.S. naval forces
carry nuclear weapons here.
It was a new embarrassment for the government
of Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, already stung by a
U.S. detense-cooperation controversy that resulted
in the resignation ot Foreign Minister Masayoshi
I to.
Suzuki ordered an investigation of Reischauer's
remarks while disputing them. The U.S. Embassy
refused to discuss the incident, repeating its stan
dard statement that it could "neither confirm nor
deny" the presence of nuclear weapons aboard
American ships using Japanese ports.
Reischauer, now a Harvard professor, was am
bassador here from 1961 to 966 and is widely re
spected in Japan for his scholarship and his triendly
understanding of this country's politics.
In an interview with the Mainichi newspaper at
his home near Boston, Reischauer said nuclear
armed American aircraft carriers and cruisers
have called at Japanese ports. He was quoted as

saying it is time tor Japanese governments to "sim
ply recognize the tact."
Budget suffers defeat in House
Washington — The Reagan administration's high
minded rhetoric about demanding sacrifices ot rich
and poor alike has taken a tumble on the House floor
with a stunning reversal of the president's budget
cuts tor the Export-Import Bank
In fact, the legislators and lobbyists who worked
hardest to win more lending authority tor the bank
— and for the big corporations that use it the most —
say it was really no contest The White House didn't
even put up a fight.
"We took a licking." acknowledged one adminis
tration official. "I believe our people werecaughtby
surprise. I don't think the Republicans had the word
loud and clear that this was bad."
The folks at Boeing. General Electric and the In
ternational Association of Machinists, among oth
ers. were delighted at the outcome It involved an
overnight switch ot some 70 votes.
At stake the final levels for the current 981
fiscal year in the Ex-Im Bank's direct loan authority
and in its loan guarantee authorizations.
President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting back
burgeoning' Rank's direct loan level for the cur
rent year to $5 148 billion, a reduction ot $752 mil
lion. as the first stepin a professed effort "to reduce
or eliminate federal subsidies to business." And he
called tor a $1 billion cutback from the Carter ad
ministration's loan guarantee level for the bank this
year, from $8 560 billion to $7,559 billion.
The Office of Management and Budget headed by
David Stockman has also hammered at the fact that
most of the bank's direct loans, which carried an av
erage interest rate last year of only BV 2 percent, sup
port the exports ot a handtul ot large firms. In 1980.
two-thirds ot those loans went to seven companies:
Boeing. General Electric. Westinghouse, Western
Electric and Combustion Engineering.
Two Reagan officials to resign
Washington — Charging that 1 million Third
World babies perish each year from diseases
brought on by bottle-feeding, two government of
ficials said yesterday they will resign when the Rea
gan administration carries out its decision to vote
against an international code that says mothers'
milk is best.
Administration officials don't dispute that breast
teeding is preferable, but contend the code repre
sents an unwaranted attempt by the United Nations
to regulate how private business promote their prod
ucts.
Dr. Stephen Joseph and Eugene Babb, both senior
executives of the Agency tor International Develop
ment, issued their resignation threat during a news
conference at the American Public Health Associa
tion.
Several prominent physicians joined them in
deploring the Reagan administration plan to cast
what is expected to be a solitary vote against the
code at the World Health Assembly in Geneva. The
vote is set tentatively for Thursday.
The resignations apparently would make Joseph
and Babb the first top officials to quit over Reagan
administration policies. Both went to work for AID
during the Carter administration.
Joseph, a pediatrician who is the highest ranking
health professional at AID. said "One million chil
dren a year die for reasons associated with bottle
feeding," such as diarrhea and under-nutrition that
are common causes of infant death in impoverished
countries.
Pulitzer winner Saroyan dies
William Saroyan, the boisterous, brilliant and re
clusive Armenian bard of Central California whose
prize-winning books and plays underscored the
dearness of life, and who readily admitted he was as

great a writer as his admirers said he was, died yes
terday of cancer in Fresno He was 72.
Saroyan was admitted to Veteran's Adminis
tration Hospital in Fresno on April 2' after family
members found him unconscious at his home in the
San Joaquin Valley community. At first it was
thought that he had suffered a stroke, but doctors
later said he was suffering from cancer, which con
tributed to his hospitalization.
Five days before his collapse. Saroyan had called
The Associated Press to report that he was dying of
cancer and to make this final statement for publica
tion after his death:
"Everybody has got to die, but I have always be
lieved an exception would be made in my case Now
what?"
A portly man with a walrus mustache that once
led a critic to describe him as resembling a "Balkan
bandit," Saroyan was a prolific, sometimes ram
bling, writer who churned out a Pulitzer prize-win
ning play in six days and then stunned the literary
community by rejecting the award.
If there was a message in Saroyan. it was this:
Experience life to its fullest. "Try to leafn to
breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat.
and when you sleep, really to sleep," he advised in
the preface to his first book, The Daring Young Man
on the Flying Trapeze. "Try as much as possible to
be wholly alive, with all your might, and when you
laugh, laugh like hell and when you get angry, get
good and angry. Try to be alive. You will be dead
soon enough."
