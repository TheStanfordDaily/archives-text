# 'Mr. Nice Guy' Howe elected Daily editor
## 
### 
Topsiders and v-necked sweat
ers may soon replace painters'
pants and political T-shirts at the
Daily, following last night's elec
tion of Sam Howe as next fall's edi
tor.
Sam, a native of Weston, Mass.,
promised to bring to the Daily "the
good old Yankee know-Howe."
However, insiders are calling the
election a clear indication of the
advent of "Nordic reform."
Pledging to purge the office of all
but the blondest of women, the
coldest of beer and the whitest of
toothpastes, Howe added last
night, "Most of what I will bring to
the Daily I learned on a six-month
trek around the country last year."
Disappointed staffers who had
thought his platform read "most of
what I bring to the Daily I earned
on a six-month trek around the
country," soon lost interest in the
rest ot Howe's remarks.
Known for his grain-fed, healthy,
Aryan appearance, Howe stands 5-
foot-6 at the shoulder and sports a
shock of blond hair.
He has vowed to institute a "Pre
ppie Page," devoted to sailing
news and the latest in khaki, to be
sponsored byL.L. Bean, and to give
more extensive coverage to sports
like dogsled racing.
Sources "intimately close" to
Sam characterized him as "father
knows-best type of figure." Those
sources refused to comment on his
figure, however.
In other important reforms,
Howe vowed to serve only hot
cider, preservative-enriched
Twmkies and an occasional rein
deer steak at munchie breaks
"Granola is on the way out," he de
clared after the votes were in.
Howe will be joined in his mis
sion to "cover Stanford like no one
else can" by Hoosier hick Vic
"Form over Content" Goetz. GoeL

has pledged to increase Daily cov
erage of important Midwestern
news like the price of pork bellies in
South Bend and pending changes in
Indiana state license plate codes.
He also announced late last night
that he would relinquish his sum
mer job in a sewage treatment
plant back home. "I'm sure I'll be
getting more shit in this job than I
can handle." he said.

Goetz meanwhile, sported a
smile not seen by Daily newsroom
staffers (that doesn't include
photo) since the staff's last trip to
the theater or since the wire ser
vices moved a story which refer
enced an Indiana prison "you can
practically see from my backyard
if only you stand on the porch with a
high-powered telescope and catch
the reflection off the moving vehi
cles' windows." Goetz has vowed
to temper Howe's preference for
blondes.
Howe, characterized as an ins
tant love object by his managing
editor-designate, is called Mr. Nice
Guy both by his friend? and ene
mies. "This volume can be the
most successful since my role
model Bill Burger's," Howe said
