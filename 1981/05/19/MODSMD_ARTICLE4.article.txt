# Views differ on theme house complaints
## 
### Bill Beyda Second in a series 
Last quarter, Dean ot Student Affairs James
Lyons sent a memo to President Donald Kennedy
outlining the complaints his office had received
about Ujamaa, the black theme house, and Zapata,
the Chicano theme house. The complaints, which
had come from both minority and non-minority resi
dents, ranged from "pressure due to racial ten
sions" to "lack of participation in theme projects."
The memo sparked various responses from the
resident statf at those houses. Many ot the student
complaints had come from non-members of minor
ity groups who did not want to be in the houses, but
had been assigned there in the draw.

ISeivs analysis

Woodrow Meyers, resident tellow at Ujamaa, re
sponded to the problems discussed in the memo.
"Everyone has different expectations tor what a
theme house should do," Meyers said, "but I've
always stated that Ujamaa is the summation of the
people in the house."
Meyers said he feels racial tension is not neces
sarily a "bad" thing. In fact, Meyers stated, racial

tension, "it channelled correctly, can be very bene
ficial."
Meyers emphatically disagrees with students who
claim Ujamaa makes a bad neighbor and does not
participate in Lagunita Court activities, stating that
"Ujamaa social activities are open to all students
. . . in tact, one of our events, Club Ujamaa. at
tracted large crowds of all ethnic backgrounds from
all over campus.
"Neither culture dominates Ujamaa, and there
tore both groups are uncomfortable. becau«p it's a
situation they're not used to," Meyers said. "That's
what makes Ujamaa an exciting place to live. It's
challenge to all students . . . they're thrust into a sit
uation they've never been in before, and probably
never will again. If it can't happen at Stanford,
where can it happen?"
Leah Halper, a resident assistant (RA i at Zapata,
said, "Just as allminority groups are not the same,
it's a mistake to assume that all theme houses at
Stanford are the same or raise the same issues. Be
cause the Zapata staft is aware that the issues con
cerning theme houses are extremely complex, deep,
and sensitive, we would like to address those issues
on our own terms rather than through a Daily arti

cle, and we are presently drafting responses to the
circulated memos."
Lyons' memo, which was circulated to the resi
dent fellows of ethnic theme houses and others on
residential education committees, outlined more
than a dozen complaints that his office received.
"Some of these complaints were received only
from one resident, and by no means reflect the opin
ion of an entire house or the majority of students in
any house," Lyons stressed.
The " / " >r npl '-i.intc include:
• freshmen assigned to Ujamaa or Zapata don't
want to cope with racial tension.
• Ujamaa and Zapata make bad neighbors and don't
participate in Lagunita and Stern functions.
• Black community-wide activities are imposed on
Ujamaa residents and intrude on their house affairs.
• Too many students choose Ujamaa because of the
quality of the rooms and are not truly interested in
the theme and therefore don't participate.
• Zapata's double rooms are a hindrance to the
theme.
• Themes are not effective because of the Univer
sity's policy against all black or all Chicano houses.
• Many students are assigned to Ujamaa or Zapata
in the draw and are not interested in the theme, but
wouid rather live there than off-campus, and are not
committed to the theme.
• Houses are too broad and try to serve too many
purposes.
• Theme houses are in the hands of a few and their
programs are politically one-sided.
• The University admits "middle class" minority
students who are not very politically aware or so
cially committed.
• Theme houses do not afford minority students the
desired isolation.
• Stanford residences are not good informal
classrooms where students from different racial
backgrounds can learn to live, study, and col
laborate together, or to unlearn racism.
• There are not enough opportunities for minority
students, especially freshmen, to cluster in resi
dences other than theme houses.
Okada, the Asian-American theme house, was
virtually ignored in Lyons' memo. Why Okada is
generally perceived as providing a less tense at
mosphere than the other ethnic theme houses will
hr examined in the last article of the series, appear

Leah Halper, a resident assistant (RA i at Zapata,
said, "Just as allminority groups are not the same,
it's a mistake to assume that all theme houses at
Stanford are the same or raise the same issues. Be
cause the Zapata staft is aware that the issues con
cerning theme houses are extremely complex, deep,
and sensitive, we would like to address those issues
on our own terms rather than through a Daily arti

cle, and we are presently drafting responses to the
circulated memos."
Lyons' memo, which was circulated to the resi
dent fellows of ethnic theme houses and others on
residential education committees, outlined more
than a dozen complaints that his office received.
"Some of these complaints were received only
from one resident, and by no means reflect the opin
ion of an entire house or the majority of students in
any house," Lyons stressed.
The " / " >r npl '-i.intc include:
• freshmen assigned to Ujamaa or Zapata don't
want to cope with racial tension.
• Ujamaa and Zapata make bad neighbors and don't
participate in Lagunita and Stern functions.
• Black community-wide activities are imposed on
Ujamaa residents and intrude on their house affairs.
• Too many students choose Ujamaa because of the
quality of the rooms and are not truly interested in
the theme and therefore don't participate.
• Zapata's double rooms are a hindrance to the
theme.
• Themes are not effective because of the Univer
sity's policy against all black or all Chicano houses.
• Many students are assigned to Ujamaa or Zapata
in the draw and are not interested in the theme, but
wouid rather live there than off-campus, and are not
committed to the theme.
• Houses are too broad and try to serve too many
purposes.
• Theme houses are in the hands of a few and their
programs are politically one-sided.
• The University admits "middle class" minority
students who are not very politically aware or so
cially committed.
• Theme houses do not afford minority students the
desired isolation.
• Stanford residences are not good informal
classrooms where students from different racial
backgrounds can learn to live, study, and col
laborate together, or to unlearn racism.
• There are not enough opportunities for minority
students, especially freshmen, to cluster in resi
dences other than theme houses.
Okada, the Asian-American theme house, was
virtually ignored in Lyons' memo. Why Okada is
generally perceived as providing a less tense at
mosphere than the other ethnic theme houses will

Last quarter, Dean ot Student Affairs James
Lyons sent a memo to President Donald Kennedy
outlining the complaints his office had received
about Ujamaa, the black theme house, and Zapata,
the Chicano theme house. The complaints, which
had come from both minority and non-minority resi
dents, ranged from "pressure due to racial ten
sions" to "lack of participation in theme projects."
The memo sparked various responses from the
resident statf at those houses. Many ot the student
complaints had come from non-members of minor
ity groups who did not want to be in the houses, but
had been assigned there in the draw.

ISeivs analysis

Woodrow Meyers, resident tellow at Ujamaa, re
sponded to the problems discussed in the memo.
"Everyone has different expectations tor what a
theme house should do," Meyers said, "but I've
always stated that Ujamaa is the summation of the
people in the house."
Meyers said he feels racial tension is not neces
sarily a "bad" thing. In fact, Meyers stated, racial

tension, "it channelled correctly, can be very bene
ficial."
Meyers emphatically disagrees with students who
claim Ujamaa makes a bad neighbor and does not
participate in Lagunita Court activities, stating that
"Ujamaa social activities are open to all students
. . . in tact, one of our events, Club Ujamaa. at
tracted large crowds of all ethnic backgrounds from
