"Stanford has finally come around
to the view that a journalist, is a jour
nalist, is a journalist," said Com
munications Prot. Elie Abel, describ
ing some of the changes that will be in
itiated this fall in the graduate broad
cast curriculum ot the Communica
tions Department.
Abel, who chairs the department
Curriculum Committee, explained
that tor the tirst time the department
is following a graduate admissions
process that is common to the print
and broadcast specializations.
Students will be admitted to a single
journalism program, and once here
they will be able to chose a broadcast
or print concentration. Some
coursework not previously required of

broadcast students, including writing
courses and courses concerning legal,
regulatory and ethical questions, will
nowbe a part of the regular cur
riculum.
Beginning this September, the
broadcasting program will demand
more of students in the way of re
search and writing, said Abel. The
change "is a question of treating
broadcasting as a legitimate and pow
erful torm of journalism."

Visiting Prof. Irv Drasnin, who
joined the Communications Depart
ment last fall after a 20-year career
with CBS, said "What's important is
that there should be no arbitrary dis
tinction made between print journal
ism and broadcast journalism. The
principles of good reporting apply
equally to both, however different
they may sometimes be in technique
and technology."

■Drasnin said he was troubled by the
department "defining print as 'jour
nalism' and broadcasting as 'some
thing else.' "
"In a time when most Americans
get most of their news from television,
it is all the more imperative that tele
vision news meet the highest pro
fessional standards of journalism," he
said.
"It's a good change, a modern
change." said Abel, whose experience
includes 16 years as a print journalist
and nine years with NBC news. He
said, "I think it is something that
probably should have been done years
ago."
Other programs
Besides journalism, the Com
munication Department offers
courses ot study in tilm, social sci
ence, and communication and de
velopment.
Another improvement for the Com

munications Department will be the
completion of the building now being
renovated in the outer Quad near
Palm Drive. The new location should
be finished by fall quarter 1982.
Henry Breitrose, who chairs the de
partment, said that with the comple
tion of the new facility, "for the first
time in the history of the department
we anticipate that the facilities will be
adequate for our teaching and re
search needs — on all levels."
Included in the new building will be
a color television studio. 20 editing
rooms, and a computerized journal
ism lab.
Breitrose said, "the building was
planned on the basis of technical
changes predicted for the next 10
years." He also anticipates that every
graduate student will be given a work
space. Currently, only doctoral can
didiates and film students have work
space provided.
