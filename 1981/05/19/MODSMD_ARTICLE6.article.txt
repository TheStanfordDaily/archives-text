# Supreme Court expands Miranda
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court gave criminal suspects two im
portant new tools yesterday tor pre
venting their own words trom being
used against them.
The court ruled that murder defen
dants must be warned about their
rights to remain silent and to have a
lawyer's help prior to psychiatric tes
ting if the test results are used after
conviction to help choose life or death
as punishment.
And in a separate decision, the jus
tices said police cannot use informa
tion gained by initiating new con-,
versations with a criminal suspect
who previously refused to talk without
his lawyer present.
Both rulings expanded or shored up
the controversial Miranda doctrine
fashioned in 1966 by a Supreme Court
generally viewed as more liberal in its
views of criminal suspects' rights
than the present court. Both results
came on unanimous votes.
The psychiatric-testing opinion was
authored by Chief Justice Warren
Burger, generally viewed as one of the

court's most conservative members;
it extended the Miranda doctrine to
psychiatric testing and overturned the
death sentence of Texas death row in
mate Ernest Benjamin Smith.
His 90-minute interview with a Dal
las psychiatrist, Dr. James Gpigson.
was used to establish his "future dan
gerousness." Under Texas law, a con
victed murderer's future danger
ousness can be used to justify the
death sentence.
Smith was not aware that the test
result would be used for anything but
to determine his competency to stand
trial.
Yesterday's decision likely will af
fect at least 30 other Texas death row
inmates and perhaps dozens more It
also could affect similar death penalty
procedures in Virginia and Oklahoma,
according to one of Smith's lawyers
Justice Byron White, who 15 years
ago dissented from the Miranda ruling
that required police to warn suspects
about their rights before questioning
them, wrote for the court in the second
case.

The second major ruling stemmed
from Robert Edwards conviction in a
Tucson. Ariz., armed robbery seven
years ago.
Edwards asked for a lawyer when
he was arrested but the following
morning, hours before a lawyer was to
be appointed for him, was questioned
by two police detectives after being
told he "had to" talk to them
"An accused such as Edwards hav
ing expressed his desire to deal with
the police only through counsel is not
subject to further interrogation by the
authorities until counsel has been
made available to him, unless the ac
cused himself initiates further com
munication. exchanges or com
munications with the police," White
wrote
In a busy day of decisions and or
ders, the court also took these actions:
