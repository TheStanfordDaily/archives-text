The house stands in a quiet
whirlpool just off the rushing
torrent of Embarcadero Road
buffeted on one side by the com
muter trains making their daily
sprint from San Jose to San
Francisco and on the other by a
ceaseless stream of Porsches.
Jaguars and BMW's returning
to their suburban east
The house itself is con
structed of pink stucco, and is so
clearly the product of Southern
California that it seems as if
Woody Allen must surely have
had a hand in its design A small
plastic sign attached to the
doorbell says "please knock
so I open the ragged screen door
and knock hollowly
There is no sign of activity be
hind the curtained window, but
in a moment I hear the sound of
slow lootsteps approaching
pad SLAP! pad SLAP'
One almost expects a perfectly
tan Mandel to answer the door
wearing running shorts and
Birkenstocks. casually flipping
his straight blond Viair out ol his
eyes bef ore he grasps your hand
in a firm but sincere handshake
The door opens, a pair of
green eyes peer up at me. squin
ting against the sunlight Ah
you must be Binky Come on
in."
I follow his hunched
silhouette into the darkened liv
ing room, and it takes several
seconds for my eyes to grow ac
customed to the gloom I begin
to make out spindly pieces of
modern furniture and heaps of
newspapers piled up in corners
An avocado plant near the win
dow is dying a slow death lrom
dehydration
Mandel ushers me to a dining
room that is — thankfully — not
as pink as the outside of the
house, but he proudly points
through an open bamboo divider
to a shockingly pink kitchen
"The landlord calls it desert
rose." he says, chuckling
"Wait til you see the bath
room."
It is immediately obvious that
Mandel is out ol his element in
the sunny residential heart of
Palo Alto, although his wiry,
pale-skinned figure would seem
ordinary enough on the streets
of any Eastern city He has in
herited no obvious character
istics Ironi the Scottish farmers
or the East European Jews who
must be rolling over in their
graves at the thought of their
bloods now mingled, and he
takes great pains to explain that
his curly brown hair is in fact his
mother's, his father being that
rare entity, a blond New York
Jew
He is eager to tell me what he
perceives as the essential dif
ference between California and
the East Coat "Californians
have spent U>o much time ex
• erasing their bodies, not

enough time on their minds he
says, leaning oac* in his Danish
wicker chair which shows signs
of giving way under the strain
But it's easy to understand
why With the weather like this
all the time.' he waves ex
pansively at the closed blinds,
"it's hard to sit down and
study
If I were the outdoors type.
I d want to be outside throwing a
insbee or hiking or whatever it
is that you outdoor people do

Does Mandel realize hou many special
interest groups on campus he has alienated
uith his column '?

3ut. you know I grew up in New
York and went to school in Mas
sachusetts. and I can't seem to
get over my old conditioning I
know it's a bit strange to go out
side with a down coat when the
weather s like this, but think of
it as season lag — like jet lag.
only on a bigger scale
The chilly, cloistered winters
of the East coast have taken
their toll upon Mandel in other,
less obvious ways. For instance,
the flannel shirt that he wears
buttoned up to the collar it
would be futile to tell him that
flannels are entirely unaccep-

table south of Eureka with the
possible exception of the Boot
n' Saddle Bar in the foothills.
He offers his guests a cup ol hot
tea. which seems similarly in
congruous when the outside
temperature is a torrid 75
degrees It's soon apparent that
he is a connoisseur of such
things, and will happily bring
out colorful little packets of
Earl Grey and Lapsang
Souchong if one is foolish
enough to express any interest.

I decline refreshment, and
propose to Mandel that we begin
the interview He nods
agreeably, and shows little re
luctance when I start to ques
tion him about his recent col
umn m The Stanford I)hily
' Oh. those!" he says, a faint
smile crossing his cherubic
face. "I can't believe how many
people actually read them You
know I was going to write on
called Humor is the Forgotten
Weapon of Irish Nationalists,
but they told me they wouldn't
print it For some reason, they
didn't want me to write a pro-

Apartheid piece either
Does Mandel realize how
many special interest groups on
campus he has alienated with
his column''
"Well, that's the idea, isn't
if I mean, what's the fun ol
having a column if you can't say
whatever comes to mind It's
not m\ fault if the feminists and
the gay community were so
touchy. Anyway. I thought gay
people were supposed to have a
good sense of humor "
1 ask him if he is aware of the
"Jimmy's World'' scandal at
The Washington Post, and I del
icately point out the existence ol
something called journalistic
responsibility
"I hardly see how that applies
to me," he sputters indignantly.
"After all. I'm an English ma
jor. not a journalist . "
The 3:52 commuter train
from San Francisco rumbles by,
and the house begins to shake
palpably. Mandel rushes to the
window, cranks it shut, and re
turns to his chair He absently
stirs the lumps of congealed
cream in his tea and shouts to
be heard over the roar of the
passing tram
You know, I'm surprised
that people haven't been more
understanding Writing a col
umn every two weeks isn't very
easy. I have to go around and
beg my friends for ideas, and
it's getting so they won't even
trust me anymore They know if
they tell me any juicy tidbits ol
gossip, it'll be in next Monday's
column For instance that one
about Paul Rob.

I tactfully interrupt him as it
is nearly lour and 1 am anxious
to return to campus for a
chamber music concert But
Mandel is adamant about show
ing me his room belore I go
The room is a lovingly-pre
served shrine to New York, and
the single most imposing object,
dwarf ing the few meager pieces
of furniture, is a gargantuan
Sew Yorker cover Flanking it
are lesser icons a New School
poster, and several exhibition
posters from the Met and
MOMA
Sunday Times and Sew
Yorkers are littered about un
derfoot and one feels a sense of
claustrophobia not unlike that of
a crowded IRT tram or a Bloom
mgdale's elevator at Christ
mastime Yet Mandel sees no
irony in his expatriate s temple,
and punctuates his tour with
good-humored remarks about
the California lifestyle he has so
enthusiastically adopted
As I stand on the sundeck with
Mandel. surveying the last af
ternoon traffic on Em
barcadero. I am reminded of a
few lines from The Great
(latsby. Fitzgerald might
almost have been writing about
Mandel when he said. "So we
beat on. boats against the cur
rent. borne back ceaselessly
into the past "
Later, as the sun is disappear
ing behind the foothills. I begin
the long trek back to campus
