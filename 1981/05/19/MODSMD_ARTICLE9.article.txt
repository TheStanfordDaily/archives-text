## Abortion opponents in favor of forced labor 
### 
John Stuart Mill once defined
"conservatives as "the stupid
party." Mill had a point: both in
ideological debate and in politi
cal action conservatives have
generally displayed a certain in
tellectual dullness
It is therefore a cause for sur
prise that anti-abortion conser
vatives in the House and Senate
are currently displaying an un
characteristic cleverness in
their quest to make abortion il
legal Correctly judging that
amending the Constitution to
overturn the Supreme Courts
973 abortion ruling would be a
lonf jnd uncertain process,
these Congressional conserva
tives have instead devised a
plan to make an end run around
the Constitution
The idea is simply to pass a
law defining the fetus as a per
son. the proposed law cites the
enforcement clause of the four
teenth amendment as granting
to Congress the authority to
pass such legislation Since both
sides in the abortion debate gen
erally agree that if the fetus is a
person then abortion is murder,
one might presume that existing
laws against murder would suf
fice to prohibit abortion once
the fetus were legally defined to
be a person.
Furthermore, by invoking a
rarely noticed Constitutional
provision originally intended to
give Congress certain house
keeping powers over the courts,

the proposed law strips lower
federal courts of the power to in
terfere in any way with the
states prohibition of abortion
Whether or not one agrees
with the anti-abortion Con
gressmen one must admire the
cleverness and subtlety of their
plan Not only are they reveal
ing a political savvy and clev
erness unusual tor the Right,
but they also surprisingly, have
a better case on the basic in
tellectual issue which has been
at the center of the abortion de
bate
Typically, defenders of the
right to abort argue that ttie
ietus cannot be said to be a hu
man being distinct from the
mother, that it is only a part of
the mother's body.
Immediately after concep
tion. before there is a function
ing brain and nervous system,
the fetus surely is not a person
Without a functioning brain
there can be no awareness or
consciousness; without any
spark of awareness or con
sciousness there cannot be a dis
tinct person.
The fact that a functioning
brain is necessary for a human
being to exist is the reason that
"brain-death," the irrevocable
cessation of all brain activity
which supports awareness or
consciousness, is nowadays
rightly viewed as signaling the
end of a human s life
But by the same token, once a
spark of awareness does exist in
the fetus's brain, it is a distinct
being, a person which is not sim
ply a part of its mother. If the
presence of brain activity sup
porting awareness serves as the
criterion for determining the
end of life, it must also serve to
determine the beginning of life
Of course, the fetus's level of
consciousness is not that of an
adult, but then neither is the
level of awareness of a newborn
babe equal to an adult's. Yet a
newborn baby is surely a human

being
Similarly, the tact that the
fetus is physically dependent
upon the mother does not make
it a non-person for all practical
purposes, babies and some adult
invalids are also totally depen
dent upon other people tor their
survival and are. nonetheless,
human beings.
In short, while the anti-abor
tionists push their case too far in
claiming that from conception
the fetus is a human being, their
ba ic claim that the fetus is a
person tor some time before its
birth is certainly true
For most people on both sides
ot the issue, such a conclusion
would mark the end of the de
bate: if the fetus is a person,
then, it is assumed, abortion is
obviously murder and should be
outlawed
That assumption is invalid.
Assume that the fetus is in
deed a person This person has
established itself inside the
mother's body, usually contrary
to the mother's desire or intent
in the cases under discussion,
and lives off the mother's body,
literally extracting nutrients
from her bloodstream
As MIT philosopher Judith
Jarvis Thompson has pointed
out, if some adult person were to
somehow hook himself up to a
woman so as to sustain himself
through her bloodstream and by
her organs, she would obviously
have the right to terminate this
relationship through any means
necessary — even if the other
person could not survive
without the arrangement. It
would be a simple matter of
self-defense
If the fetus is a person, the
same argument applies. The
mother has a right to use what
ever force is necessary to ex
tract this person trom her body
and to free herself trom its use
of her body.
No person, including a fetus,
has a right to live by subjecting

another person to slavery. To
force a woman to carry a fetus
against her will is to impose
upon her the most intimate form
of forced labor nine months of
carrying another person inside
her womb and allowing it to
live off of her body
For the federal government
or any state to outlaw abortion
is to impose upon women a
uniquely intrusive form of in
voluntary servitude
Conservatives may not be in
consistent in favoring this form
of forced labor: after all. many
conservatives, such as Bill
Wray (Daily, Apr 9i. who wish
to legislate forced labor in the
area of childbearing by outlaw
ing abortions also favor other
sorts of involuntary servitude
such as the draft. Nor. perhaps,
are liberals terribly anxious to
challenge the basic concept of
forced labor: the liberal welfare
state, let's remember, rests on
the premise that some people do
have a right to force others to
provide them with the means of
sustenance
The conservative victory last
November was the result of pop
ular rejection of tailed liberal
economic policies and liberal
social engineering It was not.
as Moral Majoritarians claim, a
popular mandate for a new ver
sion of social engineering differ
ing from the old only in that con
servative rather than liberal
values are to be imposed upon
the country.
Most Americans favor the
right to abort. However, if pro
abortion activists continue to
wrongly insist that a fetus is not
a person and to concede that il it
were a person abortion would be
murder, the anti-abortion mi
nority may well prevail Defen
ders of freedom of choice must
forcefully emphasize that, even
if the fetus is n person, to forc
ibly expel another person from
one's own body is not murder
but self-defense and that to out

law abortion is to impose torced
labor upon women, violating
their individual rights.
Unless such a defense ot the
right to abort is made to the pub
lic. the New Right may succeed
in its ingenious attempt to re
strict the liberty of American
women

If the fetus is a person, the

of her body.
No person, including a fetus,
has a right to live by subjecting

upon her the most intimate form
of forced labor nine months of

live off of her body

is to impose upon women a
uniquely intrusive form of in

conservatives, such as Bill

John Stuart Mill once defined
"conservatives as "the stupid
party." Mill had a point: both in
ideological debate and in politi
cal action conservatives have
generally displayed a certain in
tellectual dullness
It is therefore a cause for sur
prise that anti-abortion conser
vatives in the House and Senate
are currently displaying an un
characteristic cleverness in
their quest to make abortion il
legal Correctly judging that
amending the Constitution to
overturn the Supreme Courts
973 abortion ruling would be a
lonf jnd uncertain process,
these Congressional conserva
tives have instead devised a
plan to make an end run around
the Constitution
The idea is simply to pass a
law defining the fetus as a per
son. the proposed law cites the
enforcement clause of the four
teenth amendment as granting
to Congress the authority to
pass such legislation Since both
sides in the abortion debate gen
erally agree that if the fetus is a
person then abortion is murder,
one might presume that existing
laws against murder would suf
fice to prohibit abortion once
the fetus were legally defined to
be a person.
Furthermore, by invoking a
rarely noticed Constitutional
provision originally intended to
give Congress certain house
keeping powers over the courts,

the proposed law strips lower
federal courts of the power to in
terfere in any way with the
states prohibition of abortion
Whether or not one agrees
with the anti-abortion Con
gressmen one must admire the
cleverness and subtlety of their
plan Not only are they reveal
ing a political savvy and clev
erness unusual tor the Right,
but they also surprisingly, have
a better case on the basic in
tellectual issue which has been
at the center of the abortion de
bate
Typically, defenders of the
right to abort argue that ttie
ietus cannot be said to be a hu
man being distinct from the
mother, that it is only a part of
the mother's body.
Immediately after concep
tion. before there is a function
ing brain and nervous system,
the fetus surely is not a person
Without a functioning brain
there can be no awareness or
consciousness; without any
spark of awareness or con
sciousness there cannot be a dis
tinct person.
The fact that a functioning
brain is necessary for a human
being to exist is the reason that
"brain-death," the irrevocable
cessation of all brain activity
which supports awareness or
consciousness, is nowadays
rightly viewed as signaling the
end of a human s life
But by the same token, once a
spark of awareness does exist in
the fetus's brain, it is a distinct
being, a person which is not sim
ply a part of its mother. If the
presence of brain activity sup
porting awareness serves as the
criterion for determining the
end of life, it must also serve to
determine the beginning of life
Of course, the fetus's level of
consciousness is not that of an
adult, but then neither is the
level of awareness of a newborn
babe equal to an adult's. Yet a
newborn baby is surely a human

being
Similarly, the tact that the
fetus is physically dependent
upon the mother does not make
it a non-person for all practical
purposes, babies and some adult
invalids are also totally depen
dent upon other people tor their
survival and are. nonetheless,
human beings.
In short, while the anti-abor
tionists push their case too far in
claiming that from conception
the fetus is a human being, their
ba ic claim that the fetus is a
person tor some time before its
birth is certainly true
For most people on both sides
ot the issue, such a conclusion
would mark the end of the de
bate: if the fetus is a person,
then, it is assumed, abortion is
obviously murder and should be
outlawed
That assumption is invalid.
Assume that the fetus is in
deed a person This person has
established itself inside the
mother's body, usually contrary
to the mother's desire or intent
in the cases under discussion,
and lives off the mother's body,
literally extracting nutrients
from her bloodstream
As MIT philosopher Judith
Jarvis Thompson has pointed
out, if some adult person were to
somehow hook himself up to a
woman so as to sustain himself
through her bloodstream and by
her organs, she would obviously
have the right to terminate this
relationship through any means
necessary — even if the other
person could not survive
without the arrangement. It
