The Daily welcomes expressions of all viewpoints from its readers. Letters should
be kept as brief as possible and are subject to editing, though efforts are made to
consult with the authors before changes are made. They must include signature and
phone number. Pseudonyms and initials will not be used. Unpublished letters can
not be acknowledged.
