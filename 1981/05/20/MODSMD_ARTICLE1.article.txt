Athens, Ga. — The Stanford Cardinals sixth NCAA
tennis title in nine years will go down in the record
books as a narrow 5-4 upset of the top-seeded UCLA
Bruins. But as any of the approximately 1500 spectators
at Henry Feild Stadium could tell you, the second
seeded winners were far and away the better team on
this muggy, clouded Tuesday
Stanford was the better team because, as it had done
the day before, the team overcame a slow start to
steamroll its opposition.
Stanford was the better team because, as it had done
in three previous rounds of the 97th NCAA tournament,
the team clinched the match after the six singles
matches. It was the first time that had ever happened
in the finals round. The close final score reflects the
forfeits of three doubles matches.
Stanford was the better team because, as it had all
season, the team picked up the slack when one player
faltered.
And last, but not least, Stanford was the better team
because they had a reason to be inspired above the thrill
ot becoming national champion.
"I want you guys to know this match is dedicated to
Tim Mayotte," coach Dick Gould told the press. "He's
supposed to turn pro next week."

It was bound to come out sooner or later, but Mayotte
wished it had been later "I really don't want to make
my decision public because I'm not 100 percent sure.''
he said, which seemed to be a cordial way ot saying he
would confirm it next week. "If it is my last match," he
said of yesterday's win, "it's a nice way to go out."
Co-captain Scott Bondurant delivered a "Let's win
one for the Timmer" speech in the pre-game team
meeting, and evidently it did the trick
"That really fired me up." said No. 6 .Jeff Arons, who
won 3-6, 6- , 6-3 over Craig Venter. "I knew I wasn't
going to lose. Timmy has been one of my best friends.
Timmy wanted it real bad. It made me feel good to do
it."
When the match began, the Cards looked as if they
might justify the second seeding. Only Jimmy Gurfein
was having an easy time of it. mowing down Blaine
Willenborg 6-0. 6-3 in No. 3 singles. But on tour of the
other five courts. Stanford was struggling.
They were struggling despite the fact that the Bruins
were missing their No. 4 player, sophomore Dan Saltz,
who has been plagued for a month with tendonitis in his
right ankle UCLA coach Glen Bassett pulled Saltz out
of the lineup only minutes before the match began.

week, led the Stanford Cardinais in winnning the NCAA

sixth time the tennis team has won the NCAA tille in nine
years.
"l've tried to play this week on it. It just
limits me too much. Saltz said "There are
roo many balls I can t get to. "
Saltz's opponent would have been Mike
Falberg, who didn't learn of the lineup
change until the match introductions.
"I psyched up last night and all this morn
ing for Saltz," said Falberg, who beat Saltz
at UCLA less than two weeks ago. "Then
they announced John Davis at No. 4 sin
gles."
Falberg played the first set as it he was
the the one with a bad ankle. Davis moved
him all over the court in the first set-and-a
half, taking a 6-3, 4-1 lead
"I thought I was a goner," Falberg said
"I was counting on the other guys to win,"
which shows what bad shape he was in.
Arons, Mayotte, and No 2 Scott Davis were
also in trouble.
Davis never extricated himself, but it
wasn't as it he didn t have the opportunities.
He converted on only eight of 10 break points
in two sets. That alone could explain his first
loss in dual matches this season. But there
was credit due his opponent, Robbie Venter,
who was clearly the better player in the 6-4,
6-3 win.
"I don't think he ever volleyed better in
his life," Davis said. "Even more than that,
he hit his approach shots great. I had trouble
passing him."
"I played pretty well. I won a lot of three

all games." Venter said "My game is not
the attacking style, but I knew 1 had to at
tack to beat Davis."
Mayotte's attacking game, which had
been too much to handle tor UCLA's Marcel
Freeman in two previous matches this year,
was sidelined by broken strings on the first
point of the match.
"That's my favorite racket. We sent it to
Bulldog Sporting Goods, and they came
through for the third set," Mayotte said
with relief,'after he won. "My other two
rackets are strung with less tension. That
was one of the reasons I wasn't playing as
well as I hoped "
The new racket and a regained first serve
made the difference in the third set, May
otte winning the match 6-7 (5-2) 7-6 (5-3),
6-3. Mayotte's win, coupled with Arons' vic
tory, put Stanford ahead 3-1. Attention
switched to the Falberg-.John Davis match.
Falberg had fought off a match point in the
second set and won it in a tiebreaker
The two freshmen swapped breaks over
the first four gagames of the final set. In the
race to see who regained their first serve,
Falberg won. Davis never held serve in the
final set, handing Falberg the match 3-6,7-6
(5-3), 6-2).
Stanford was ahead 4-1 and depending on
Bondurant to clinch the title. Since the jun

ior is the team's best money player, things
looked considerably brighter Seconds after
Falberg won. Bondurant broke Bruce
Brescia in the 1 th game of the third set He
easily held serve, winning the match 6-3. 4-6.
7-5
Bondurant lept in the air upon winning
but it took a squad of teammates rushing out
to meet him to make him realize that he had
made Stanford the 97th NCAA champion
