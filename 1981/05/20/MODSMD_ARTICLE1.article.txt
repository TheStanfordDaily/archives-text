Athens, Ga. — The Stanford Cardinals sixth NCAA
tennis title in nine years will go down in the record
books as a narrow 5-4 upset of the top-seeded UCLA
Bruins. But as any of the approximately 1500 spectators
at Henry Feild Stadium could tell you, the second
seeded winners were far and away the better team on
this muggy, clouded Tuesday
Stanford was the better team because, as it had done
the day before, the team overcame a slow start to
steamroll its opposition.
Stanford was the better team because, as it had done
in three previous rounds of the 97th NCAA tournament,
the team clinched the match after the six singles
matches. It was the first time that had ever happened
in the finals round. The close final score reflects the
forfeits of three doubles matches.
Stanford was the better team because, as it had all
season, the team picked up the slack when one player
faltered.
And last, but not least, Stanford was the better team
because they had a reason to be inspired above the thrill
ot becoming national champion.
"I want you guys to know this match is dedicated to
Tim Mayotte," coach Dick Gould told the press. "He's
supposed to turn pro next week."

It was bound to come out sooner or later, but Mayotte
wished it had been later "I really don't want to make
my decision public because I'm not 100 percent sure.''
he said, which seemed to be a cordial way ot saying he
would confirm it next week. "If it is my last match," he
said of yesterday's win, "it's a nice way to go out."
Co-captain Scott Bondurant delivered a "Let's win
one for the Timmer" speech in the pre-game team
meeting, and evidently it did the trick
"That really fired me up." said No. 6 .Jeff Arons, who
won 3-6, 6- , 6-3 over Craig Venter. "I knew I wasn't
going to lose. Timmy has been one of my best friends.
Timmy wanted it real bad. It made me feel good to do
it."
When the match began, the Cards looked as if they
might justify the second seeding. Only Jimmy Gurfein
was having an easy time of it. mowing down Blaine
Willenborg 6-0. 6-3 in No. 3 singles. But on tour of the
other five courts. Stanford was struggling.
They were struggling despite the fact that the Bruins
were missing their No. 4 player, sophomore Dan Saltz,
who has been plagued for a month with tendonitis in his
right ankle UCLA coach Glen Bassett pulled Saltz out
of the lineup only minutes before the match began.


Tim Mayotte, who said he may turn professional next
week, led the Stanford Cardinais in winnning the NCAA
tennis title yesterday in Athens, Georgia. This is the
