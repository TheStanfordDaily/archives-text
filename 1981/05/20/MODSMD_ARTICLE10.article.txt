# Licensing Dept. kept busy as Stanford inventions increase
## 
### 
On the average of once every
14 working hours, judging from
980 figures. Stanford re
searchers have produced an in
vention the University seeks to
license to industry by working
through Stanford's unique Of
fice ot Technology Licensing
(OTL).
Though this figure marks a
sharp unstep in sophistication
and quality of Stanford research
discoveries, past finds have put
Stanford returns from royalties
on sales of licensed inventions,
or advances on royalties, at
more than $600,000 a year.
It is recent work in pioneer
fields such as DNA technology.

pure-cloned antibodies,
acoustic microscopes, com
puters, semiconductors,
chemistry and medicine that ex
plain this marked increase in
Stanford productivity â€” and
profits.
The man who is largely re
sponsible for arranging the sale
of rights in Stanford discoveries
to industry is Niels Reimers.
His title is director of technolo
gy licensing. He and his staff
are the personal link between
the researchers in Stanford's
labs and business corporations
all over the world.
Since OTL was established in
1970, some 170 inventions or
processes have been patented.
The total volume of royalties
generated this year is up to $2
million.
"In the first half of this
year." said Reimers, "we have
had as many new inventions as
in the whole of last year, and the
tempo is still rising," he said.
Most of the discoveries which
Reimers' office is negotiating
for sale involve advances on the
frontiers of science. But leaning
against his office wall is a cross
country ski with a new form of
binding, invented by a Stanford
product design student.
Although public imagination
has been caught by "gene splic
ing," there is another medical
area which, in Reimers' terms,
is moving more dramatically.
This is in the hybridomas, which
are designed cell lines that pro
duce pure-cloned antibodies.
"To date, rat and mouse anti
bodies have been made, and an
extensive research literature is
rapidly evolving. Next will be
hybridomas of human origin
which should reduce or
eliminate the problem of rejec
tion. The antibody products can
be used not only in direct thera
py against a disease, but also for
purposes such as research, ge
netic typing, diagnosis, proph
ylaxis, and as 'vectors' to guide
another drug to the disease."
"Research involving gene
splicing is also, of course, pro
ducing important discoveries,
and now involves scientists in
chemical engineering, such as
Alan Michael and Channing
Robertson," says Reimer.
"Another area of technology
which is rich in developments at
the moment is computer soft
ware. This includes new ways to
manipulate data and to design
integrated circuits and semi
conductor components.

"There are others too numer
ous to mention Prominent
among them are programs tor
drug interaction information to
interface computers to laser
printers, sequencing of nucleic
acids, and so on," says Re
imers. "The OTL is now work
ing with an average of 12 dis
coveries a month."
Stanford's eminence as a na
tional resource of inventiveness
began before OTL was set up.
Two Stanford projects, the Line
ar Accelerator, and nuclear
magnetic resonance, were of in
ternational importance.
In the years following World
War 11, outstanding inventions
by Stanford researchers in
cluded the klyston, the high
power microwave vacuum tube,
spectronometers, communica
tions systems, fundamental ad
vances from organic chemistry
and computer theory to the pre
cise measurements of the pro
ton and neutron.
Today, there are over 110
high-technology corporations,
many direct or secondary of
fshoots of Stanford technology,
within a 25-mile radius of the
campus.
What role does OTL play in all
this inventiveness? "We take
what may be called an en
trepreneurial approach," Re
imers said. "We interact with
prospective licensees, general
ly before we have filed a patent
application, to assess com
mercial prospects.
"Frequently, an invention is
only one out of several techno
logical alternatives available to
a company. And experience in
dicates that however good an in
vention is, usually it needs a
champion inside the target cor
poration. This in turn means
personal interaction.
"But there is tar more benefit
to Stanford than income from
licensing inventions. For exam
ple, although they (the corpo
ration ) may nol take up the par
ticular invention we offer, they
become interested in other op
portunities tor interaction"
with Stanford, explained Re
imers.
"One of our biggest dif
ficulties," said Reimers in re
gards to seeking patents, "is
that we have to deal with about
30 different government agen
cies, each one with a different
way of operation and degree of
hopefulness or obstruction."
