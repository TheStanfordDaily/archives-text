## 
### Sarah Hotchkis 
Amidst the rythmic sounds of smooth
leather drums and the swaying of colored
beads, participants in the tenth annual Stan
ford Powwow last weekend danced to the
steps ot their Indian ancestors. Sponsored
by the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion (SAIO), the Powwow featured dozens
of beautifully costumed Indian dancers rep
resenting tribes such as the Kiowa, Navajo,
Cherokee, Sioux and Apache.
According to veteran powwow coordi
nator Joanne Nickol, the dancers and other
participants, including native arts and
crafts vendors, come from as far away as
Oklahoma, Idaho, Washington and Canada.
Many ot the dancers follow the powwow
circuit, and travel from one festival to the
next.
"Every weekend, there's a powwow
somewhere," said Nickol who added that

the next one will be held at the Antioch Fair
grounds followed by Fort Mason's celebra
tion on the Fourth ot July. Prize money,
ranging from $100 to $300, is usually offered
to the best dancers in each contest.
SAIO member Joel Sahmaunt, enjoys the
dance and traditional ambiance of the re
gional powwows. After contributing time
and energy into planning the Stanford Pow
wow, Sahmaunt and other SAIO members
receive their reward every year as increas
ingly larger crowds ot participants and
spectators arrive at Stanford.
"It's gotten bigger . . . I'm surprised,"
said Sahmaunt, who mentioned that public
ity is always the most difficult detail of the
Powwow. "Ideally, we want a large, major
powwow," and, he added, "It might be fun
to have a little more prestige."
Prestigious or not, the Stanford Powwow
is exciting. This year, booth after booth of
painting, weaving, featherwork, beadwork,

basketry and native cooking encircled the
main attraction: the dancers To the sounds
of Indian songs and drums, fancier footwork
was not to be found on campus last Saturday
and Sunday. The War Dance, performed
three times during the festival, drew the
biggest crowd as dancers moved not in vic
tory, as is stereotyped, but to honor their
warriors and veterans. In this ritual, the
dancers exhibited their greatest skills and
individualistic foot and body movements.
Sahmaunt also noted the reappearance
every year of the "regulars who frequent
the powwow circuit. This familiarity, as
well as the bond of a common heritage
makes the Stanford festival similar, re
marked Sahmaunt, to "a big party." For
most of the participants, the Stanford Pow
wow represents an opportunity for friends
and fellow Indians to get together and enjoy
the weekend.


It's 'a big party' for all who attend
Some visitors watched the skilled dancers, who performed the trad
itional War Dance to the beat of native drums, while others perused
the many small booths that sold handcrafts and native cooking. The
sight of visitors in t-shirts and jeans mingling with the native Amer
icans in beautiful traditional costumes was only a part of the fun
of the annual Stanford Powwow.
