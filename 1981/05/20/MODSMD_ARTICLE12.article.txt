The fifth annual "Splendor on the
Grass" party will be held on the Man
zanita lawn this Saturday, May 23,
from noon until midnight. The party
will feature performances by 16 stu
dent bands including Rooftop Magic,
Murphy's Lawyers, Blade Brown,
Claude Monet and the LSJUMB. Beer
from 60 kegs will be provided free to
those with a Stanford I D.
"We expect about 3000 people,"
said Laurie Tomich, one of the coordi
nators of the event. "Our lawn should
be lull all day," she said.
Tomich, a senior, said she has been
involved in the organization ot the last
three "Splendor on the Grass"
parties. This year, Tomich and anoth
er Manzanita resident, Doug Holt,
began planning the party at the begin
ning of winter quarter.
"About eight people have really

been working on the party," Tomich
said. "We had an organizational
meeting at the beginning of the quar
ter and assigned each person a partic
ular duty, such as publicity or stag
ing," she said. Tomich said she had
spent several hours each week or
ganizing the event.
Funds for the party were con
tributed by several sources. Accord
ing to Tomich, Manzanita gave $3000,
and Budweiser, who is sponsoring the
event, gave $2500. Budweiser was un
able to give the beer as a direct con
tribution, said Tomich, but the money
they gave will be used to buy
Budweiser beer, and tor publicity.
Additional funds were appropriated
by individual dorms, usually about
the sum of $50, Tomich said.
According to Tomich, work on the
party has proceeded very smoothly
compared to other years. "The only

problems," Tomich said, "have been
with organizing the bands."
"We usually try to get a pro
fessional, well-known group to play,"
said Doug Holt. "Last year we had
Joe Perry. He really didn't appeal to a
lot of the people here, and he at
tracted a lot of high school students
who came and got drunk." Holt said.
"This year we decided there were
enough good student bands right here
on campus," explained Holt. The
bands were selected on the basis of lo
cal popularity and talent. "We also
tried to give new campus bands a
shot," Holt said. "Bands like to play
here because ot the publicity they
get," Holt said.
According to Tomich, too many
bands wanted to play. "We had to turn
about six or seven down," she said.
Tomich said there was also a problem
with the order of presentation of

bands.
"Some people take it personally if
they don't get the final spot on the pro
gram," Tomich said. "This year we
gave this place to Rooftop Magic be
cause they have played here for the
last three years," Tomich said. "Any
how. enough people will be here all
day so it shouldn't matter what order
the bands play in."
According to Tomich. the bands
will play continuously from noon until
midnight. Two stages will be set up at
opposite ends of the field, and the
bands will alternate playing time,
with the better-known bands having
50 minutes to play and the less well
known bands having 30 minutes.
"The 'Splendor on the Grass' party
always falls on a great, sunny day,"
Tomich said. "Be ready for music and
beer drinking," she said.
