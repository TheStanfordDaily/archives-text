<Editor's note: The following
open letter to I University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy was writ

the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, who officially take office
today.)
Dear President Kennedy,
We very much enjoyed our re
cent discussions with you and
we are looking forward to a year
of close cooperation between
our two offices. On our first day
in office, we would like to share
with you some thoughts about
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University. This upcoming
year finds the ASSU with an es
pecially invigorated and tal
ented crew with a combination
of energy and continuity which
will make the ASSU more effec
tive than it has ever been.
The ASSU is a large and var
ied organization that provides
many services to the student
body and to the University. We
represent the interests of our di
verse and disparate student
body, run projects that directly
serve the community and pro
vide educational opportunities
for students to develop business,
administrative and political
skills.
The direct services we pro
vide range widely from Lecture
Notes, Refrigerator Service and
the Recycling Center to the Sun
day Flicks and the Typesetting
Shop, among many others. In
addition to these very popular
projects, we sponsor all-campus
events such as the recent ASSU
Friday at Frost. Indirectly, we
aid virtually every student or
gnanization by administering a
comprehensive banking service
and by overseeing the distribu
tion of over $200,000 annually to
student groups.
Another function of the ASSU
is to represent the interests and
concerns of students in the de
cision-making process ot the
University. We do this by select
ing students to sit on nearly all
committees, commissions,
boards, and panels of the Uni
versity. The officers ot the
ASSU round out this representa
tion by being members ot such
groups as the Faculty Senate,
Tresidder Union Board and the
Undergraduate Cabinet. In ad

dition. we meet regularly with
University ofticials such as
yourself to discuss issues ot im
portance to the student body.
We are able to speak with the
voice of the student body be
cause we have varied back
grounds and we come from vari
ous communities within the Uni
versity. We thus address issues
of concern to all students (such
as tuition and academic require
ments! and we address issues
which primarily affect individ
ual communities (such as for
eign students, graduate stu
dents, minority students and
women).
The ASSU is in itself an
educational entity. Three hun
dred people work for us on a full
or part-time basis. The elected
officers ot the ASSU are the four
ASSU Presidents and the 40 reg
ular and alternate ASSU Sena
tors. In addition, there are
many talented and dedicated
students in appointive positions,
the most important ot which are
the Senate Chair and the Student
Financial Manager.
We want to emphasize that
the ASSU services many people
in the University community,
not only students. Of course,
almost all the services we pro
vide are available to the public
at large. Indeed, many projects
have a significant non-student
clientele. And when the ASSU
brings a guest professor to the
University, he or she is avail
able tor public speaking and for
discussions with University
scholars.
We can also serve the Univer
sity more directly. By officially
representing the student body at
alumni activities, fund raisers
and to outside visitors, we can
help the University with its pub
lic relations
We view the Coffee House as
an example ot how increased
student participation can bene
fit everyone in the University.
When the ASSU-owned Coftee
House, Inc. submitted its bid to
run the Coftee House last year,
this food service was plagued
with low patronage, terrible
service and high prices. The
University made a great show of
taith in us by awarding us the
contract. In our first year of op

eration we have surpassed ev
eryone's expectations, except
perhaps our own. Customer
counts have nearly doubled the
past year, with the Coffee House
serving 2000 people on many
days. Despite the increased us
age. lines are faster due to a re
designing of the counters. Food
quantities are larger than last
year and the food is less ex
pensive in real cost. Dynamic
and broad-ranged programming
in conjunction with STARTS has
made the Cotfee House a favor
ite spot to pass a pleasant eve
ning. In short, the Cotfee House,
Inc. has been an unqualified suc
cess. and further improvements
are being planned. This success
has been to everyone's advan
tage: the ASSU provides a popu
lar service, the community has
a pleasant, inexpensive coffee
house; and the University has a
source ot pride instead ot prob
lems. The Coftee House is but
one instance of the successful
nature of cooperation between
the ASSU and the University.
As the success of Stanford
alumni can attest, people who
attend this University have a
variety ot artistic, scientific,
humanistic and business tal
ents. These skills and the energy
necessary to apply them are ev
ery bit as available while we are
still members ot the student
body as when we join the ranks
of the alumni. Indeed, the ser
vice by the student body to the
University is limited only by our
imagination and yours.
This is a period in Stanford's
history of quiet cooperation be
tween the student body and the
administration. We strongly en
courage you to take advantage
of this opportunity by expanding
the participation of students in
the operation of the University.
Not only wil this insure that de
cisions are made with better in
formation, but it will also pro
vide students with a direct un
derstanding of the reasons why
a tough decision was made. And
now that creative solutions are
needed to solve increasingly dif
ficult budgetary and policy
problems, the student body still
contains the greatest untapped
potential in the University.
We would like to offer you the

services of our office and of the
entire ASSU. We ask you to ex
pand your vision of how students
can aid the University. During
the next year you will see at the
ASSU some enthusiastic new
faces, as well as some ex.-
perienced old ones who would
like nothing better than to work
hard on the problems facing the
student body and the Univer
sity. Together we can perhaps
find solutions which would be
overlooked by each of us individ
ually.
