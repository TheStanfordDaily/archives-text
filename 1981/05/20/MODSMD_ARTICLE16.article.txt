## Eric Berg We can't afford to cut grad aid 
### 
Recently, much attention has been given to the
catastrophic effects on the University and its stu
dents of pending cuts in Federal support for
higher education and research. What has not been
fully realized, however, is that even without Rea
gan cuts, there would still be a serious crisis for
graduate students in the humanities and social
sciences who rely on University support.
For academic year 1980-81, the teaching as
sistantship stipend provides only 77 percent of the
living expenses tor single graduate students who
live off campus, as estimated by the Financial
Aid office, down from 104 1/2 percent in *975-76.
The fellowship stipend provides only 58 percent of
expenses, down from 80 1/2 percent in *975-76.
Clearly, support for graduate students at Stanford
has been badly eroded by inflation over the last
five years. Thanks to the efforts of Dean of Gradu
ate Studies Gerald Lieberman and his staff, next
year will see the first real increase in the level of
stipends (especially fellowships) for quite some
time, but the situation still remains critical.
A complete statement of the argument tor an
increase in the volume of University funds com
mitted to graduate student support is in the posi
tion paper from the Social Sciences Graduate Stu
dents Association and the Stanford Fellows As
sociation printed on pages 16 and 17 ot last
Wednesday's issue of Campus Report. However, I
wish to emphasize a tew points, responding espe
cially to some comments made by President
Donald Kennedy in his April 3 remarks to the Aca
demic Council.
First, Kennedy proposes that Stanford set grad
uate stipends at a level which will enable students
"to enroll here with the aid of other resources for
which they are themselves responsible â€” as with
the self-help requirement we impose upon our un

dergraduates." This overlooks the fact that grad
uate students already do a great deal in the way of
self-help through teaching and research as
sistantships which are a major form of support. In
fact, whereas undergraduates are expected to
contribute one-fourth of their total budget through
self-help, a graduate student holding a teaching
assistantship will contribute almost 59 percent
($4260 earned plus $1280 loan vs. $3873 tuition for
the nine units per quarter TAs can register for).
Second. Kennedy asks, why should Stanford
fully support study tor the Ph.D. and not pro
fessional degrees? The answer is that graduate
study in the humanities, social sciences and sci
ences has historically been the means by which
the academic community reproduced itself
through time, by training the next generation of
scholars.
If graduate students are increasingly forced
into debt to support themselves during four or five
years of graduate study which they then must re
pay out of rather unimpressive salaries when they
find teaching positions, this can only discourage
talented undergraduates from pursuing academic
careers. This will have serious consequences for
the University, both now and in the future.
The inadequacy of various alternative pro
posals (which are summarized and critiqued in
the above-mentioned position paper) leaves an in
crease in the amount of University funds com
mitted to the support of graduate students as the
only viable solution to the current situation. In
light of the Federal cuts, many will ask. can Stan
ford afford to do this? I would respond by asking,
in light of what is at stake, can it afford not to?
