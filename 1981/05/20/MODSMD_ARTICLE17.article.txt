## Feminism, men and human potential 
### 
We are male feminists, and we address
ourselves primarily to our fellow men.
Feminism has at times been threatening to
us as it has been for many other men. It has
challenged our way of life and forced us to
look at ourselves. But we have tried not to
be defensive; rather, we have attempted to
react openly and take the opportunity to
grow.
Feminism is frequently thought of as only
affecting men to the extent that men relate
to women. This is not the case. Without
question, feminism has had a profound ef
fect on our relations with women. It has
taught us to at least begin seeing women as
people, rather than as objects whose
purpose in lite is to satisfy our egos. As well
as benefitting the women with whom we've
come into contact, this shift has been good
tor us as well. We have felt ourselves be
come richer, more sensitive people as we
have moved in this direction.
In addition to altering our relations with
women, feminism has changed the way in
which we see ourselves and other men. We
have both felt the emptiness inherent to
being a "male machine" — a thing whose
sole purpose is achievement, whether it be
in the classroom or the market, the athletic
field or the bedroom.
Feminism has helped us transcend this
alienating view of ourselves, and realize the
breadth of our human capacity. We have re
alized that we can feel as well as think, co
operate as well as compete, make love as
well as fuck. We have found that what we
have been is just one small part of what we

have the potential to be.
This shift in the way we see ourselves has
been deeply linked to a shift in the way we
see other men. While at one time, we saw
other men primarily as competitors, as peo
ple against whom to prove ourselves, we
now recognize them as a profound source of
warmth and communication. When we en
counter other men, rather than slap them on
the back, we embrace; rather than put them
down, we offer support. In short, we are
learning to relate to other men in a humane,
nori-violent, and sensitive way.
Sexism and macho-ism have traditionally
gone hand-'in-hand. The struggle against one
necessitates a struggle against the other. As
men, we have been oppressed by sexism, in
sofar as we have undergone a macho social
ization. Though we have oppressed women
to the extent that we have fulfilled this trad
itional role, we have at the same time been
dehumanized ourselves. The struggle to lib
erate women is simultaneous with the
struggle to liberate ourselves.
As the feminist movement has consistent
ly maintained, the personal is political. Per
sonal affairs are political in that they are so
cial. Whatever aspect of sexism one chooses
— be it rape, pornography, or discrimina
tion in the work place — the issue is never
simply one of individuals, but of a society
which fosters a certain type of behavior
among its members. We are all aware ot the
multitude of experiences which have condi
tioned us to adopt traditional sex roles. As
we have struggled to transform ourselves in

a feminist direction, we have by definition
struggled to transform our world.
The personal is political also in the sense
that power plays an integral role in human
interaction. Institutionalized relations of
domination at the social level manifest
themselves in individual interactions. For
example, the presentation of women by the
media as objects of male pleasure reflects
itself in dating relationships in which wom
en are pursued as sexual objects. Our strug
gles against sexism in our personal rela
tions is political, then, because that struggle
has as its goal the elimination of power ine
qualities.
For us, feminism has been a movement to
be embraced, rather than resisted. We have
seen it not as a threat to our position of privi
lege, but as the key to transcending the ef
fects of socialization and thereby more fully
realizing our human potential.
Because the personal is political, our
adoption of feminism has not been akin to
the self-help movement of the 70s. The
move from accepting feminism in theory to
implementing it in practice has been
neither easy nor unproblematic. Frequent
ly, women we know have pushed us in the
direction we hope to go. This struggle has
been one of the most significant of our lives.
We hope that our brothers join us in this ef
fort.

Feminism has helped us transcend this
alienating view of ourselves, and realize the
breadth of our human capacity. We have re
alized that we can feel as well as think, co
operate as well as compete, make love as
well as fuck. We have found that what we
have been is just one small part of what we

have the potential to be.
This shift in the way we see ourselves has
been deeply linked to a shift in the way we
see other men. While at one time, we saw
other men primarily as competitors, as peo
ple against whom to prove ourselves, we
now recognize them as a profound source of
warmth and communication. When we en
counter other men, rather than slap them on
the back, we embrace; rather than put them
down, we offer support. In short, we are
learning to relate to other men in a humane,
nori-violent, and sensitive way.
Sexism and macho-ism have traditionally
gone hand-'in-hand. The struggle against one
necessitates a struggle against the other. As
men, we have been oppressed by sexism, in
sofar as we have undergone a macho social
ization. Though we have oppressed women
to the extent that we have fulfilled this trad
itional role, we have at the same time been
dehumanized ourselves. The struggle to lib
erate women is simultaneous with the
struggle to liberate ourselves.
As the feminist movement has consistent
ly maintained, the personal is political. Per
sonal affairs are political in that they are so
cial. Whatever aspect of sexism one chooses
— be it rape, pornography, or discrimina
tion in the work place — the issue is never
simply one of individuals, but of a society
which fosters a certain type of behavior
among its members. We are all aware ot the
multitude of experiences which have condi
tioned us to adopt traditional sex roles. As
we have struggled to transform ourselves in

a feminist direction, we have by definition
struggled to transform our world.
The personal is political also in the sense
that power plays an integral role in human
interaction. Institutionalized relations of
domination at the social level manifest
themselves in individual interactions. For
example, the presentation of women by the
media as objects of male pleasure reflects
itself in dating relationships in which wom
en are pursued as sexual objects. Our strug
gles against sexism in our personal rela
tions is political, then, because that struggle
has as its goal the elimination of power ine
qualities.
For us, feminism has been a movement to
be embraced, rather than resisted. We have
seen it not as a threat to our position of privi
lege, but as the key to transcending the ef
fects of socialization and thereby more fully
realizing our human potential.
Because the personal is political, our
adoption of feminism has not been akin to
the self-help movement of the 70s. The
move from accepting feminism in theory to
implementing it in practice has been
neither easy nor unproblematic. Frequent
ly, women we know have pushed us in the
direction we hope to go. This struggle has
been one of the most significant of our lives.
We hope that our brothers join us in this ef
fort.

We are male feminists, and we address
ourselves primarily to our fellow men.
Feminism has at times been threatening to
us as it has been for many other men. It has
challenged our way of life and forced us to
look at ourselves. But we have tried not to
be defensive; rather, we have attempted to
react openly and take the opportunity to
grow.
Feminism is frequently thought of as only
affecting men to the extent that men relate
to women. This is not the case. Without
question, feminism has had a profound ef
fect on our relations with women. It has
taught us to at least begin seeing women as
people, rather than as objects whose
purpose in lite is to satisfy our egos. As well
as benefitting the women with whom we've
come into contact, this shift has been good
tor us as well. We have felt ourselves be
come richer, more sensitive people as we
have moved in this direction.
In addition to altering our relations with
women, feminism has changed the way in
which we see ourselves and other men. We
have both felt the emptiness inherent to
being a "male machine" — a thing whose
sole purpose is achievement, whether it be
in the classroom or the market, the athletic
field or the bedroom.
Feminism has helped us transcend this
alienating view of ourselves, and realize the
breadth of our human capacity. We have re

operate as well as compete, make love as
