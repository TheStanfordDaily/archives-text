Don't kiss ass
Michael Weiss's column < Dai
ly. May 4) depicts the women
of Stanford as inanimate dolls;
woodenlike in disposition, yet
unignitable in the bedroom.
While his conclusions may be
based on genuine rejection and
neglect delivered him by most
women here, their reactions do
not actually indicate boorish
frigidity. The truth is not that
Stanford women don't kiss —
Stanford women just don't kiss
ass.
Most of us came to Stanford to
"be somebody" — not just to be
some body to some booby. To
those of us with any self-esteem,
the prospect of submitting to the
romantic antics of a piddling
misogynist, as Weiss has estab
lished himself to be, is rather
galling.
Sexual frustration is very
hard on some students, but it is
not an excuse tor ejaculating
such abusive and assinine slurs
toward women. Only because
we've been subjected to such
sexist drivel all our lives are
most of us able to pass over such
crude, rude remarks unruffled.
While we don't believe that
the degree of immaturity and in
sensitivity demonstrated in
Weiss's column is represent
ative of most Stanford men,
neither do we think his
aspersions should be tolerated
passively.

Please understand that we
are directing our criticism
against misogynist attitudes
and not men. We don't mean to
sound defensive but by failing to
cut down this type of woman
hating harangue, we would be
behaving, instead, like "wooden
dolls."

Miller rational?
I cannot resist responding to
the character of a persistent
series ot opinion columns by
David Miller appearing in the
Daily.
Miller has consistently ad
dressed himself to issues of im
portance and of a complexity
seldom encountered in physics.
It is mainly because of the very
importance ot these issues, and
because I am glad to finally see
Stanford students indicate some
emergence from a cocoon of af
fluent apathy; that I will resist
addressing him in kind. I will
strive, rather for the objectivity
and "rationality" which is
Miller's ideal. The problems at
issue are too large.
For myselt, I find that I agree
with about half of Miller's con
clusions, although possibly for
quite different reasons. I hasten

to make clear that, for reasons
of time, and possibly mental
limitation. I do not teel that I
have a final answer to several of
these issues (i.e. conscription,
gun control, political parties).
Yet, it is clear to me that I have
availed myself of more source
material, as well as more open
reflection, than many who pro
fess such anwers. The answers
are there, but they will only be
reached in a truly open ex
amination and discourse which
Miller's approach precludes.
The major reason why this
approach is self-defeating is
that it is dishonest. Repression
is not an effective means of con
trol. Miller's articles are ram
pant with aggression and nasti
ness ("playing at soldier,"
"moral irresponsibility," "ver
bal vandalism." etc.) and su
percilious in tone. Yet all this is
swept under the aegis of some
sort of supreme "rationality"
which Miller professes to have a
patent on.
Rationality appears to have
several overlapping meanings.
Not the least of these is being in
tune with reality. Certainly not
the most of these is
algorithimacally arriving from
point A to point B. To contrast
these two extremes with an ex
ample from physics, it matters
little what the "next" decimal
place is in Plank's constant it
one is concerned with the behav
ior of microscopic masses in a

many-body problem — such as
tinding one's way to the grocery
store.
I contend that Miller does not
recognize his own motivation
for writing his columns, and
that this poisons their purported
intent. I would hope he would
either become more openly ag
gressive or more truly "ration
al." Or perhaps both.
I don't think there has been a
time in human history when
there have been issues and prob
lems of such widespread social
concern and real urgency — nu
clear proliferation being fore
most among these. These aren't
simple problems. They won't be
solved by dogmatism, egotism,
or any other ism. It seems the
first step toward solving any
problem is recognizing one's ig
norance. Not in some absolute,
or defeatist sense, but in the
qualified way in which it is real.
This opens the way to finding
the solution.

Lottery unfair
Michaei Calabrese, in an arti
cle entitled "Why Doves Should
Back the Draft," argues that a
"fair" lottery system would be
our best insurance against war.
As I pointed out in my earlier
article, the problem with this
argument is that there is no way

to make a draft fair. Over the
next decade our military will
need to recruit only about one
out of every eight young men
and women who turn '8. Unless
we ban volunteers, most ot this
need will be met by those who
elect to sign up.
Calabrese appears to believe
that by including upper-class in
dividuals, opposition to any war
would be stronger. In the first
place, a draft by lottery would
by definition select about halt ot
its victims from the lower half
ot the income scale.
Calabrese also makes the
point that today's army is near
ly 40 percent black. I am not
sure why this disturbs him. It
troubles me because it em
phasizes that blacks do not be
lieve they can succeed as well in
civilian life as in the military.
The military is to be con
gratulated for having provided a
relatively discrimination-free
environment. Civilian life ob
viously needs improvement.
However, the proportion of
blacks in the military cannot be
lowered unless a quota is estab
lished for blacks in the military,
or unless we abandon volunteer
service entirely. I would con
sider both alternatives in

Michael Weiss's column < Dai
ly. May 4) depicts the women
of Stanford as inanimate dolls;
woodenlike in disposition, yet
unignitable in the bedroom.
While his conclusions may be
based on genuine rejection and
neglect delivered him by most
women here, their reactions do
not actually indicate boorish
frigidity. The truth is not that
Stanford women don't kiss —
Stanford women just don't kiss
ass.
Most of us came to Stanford to
"be somebody" — not just to be
some body to some booby. To
those of us with any self-esteem,
the prospect of submitting to the
romantic antics of a piddling
misogynist, as Weiss has estab
lished himself to be, is rather
galling.
Sexual frustration is very
hard on some students, but it is
not an excuse tor ejaculating
such abusive and assinine slurs
toward women. Only because
we've been subjected to such
sexist drivel all our lives are
most of us able to pass over such
crude, rude remarks unruffled.
While we don't believe that
the degree of immaturity and in
sensitivity demonstrated in
Weiss's column is represent
ative of most Stanford men,
neither do we think his
aspersions should be tolerated
passively.

Please understand that we
are directing our criticism
against misogynist attitudes
and not men. We don't mean to
sound defensive but by failing to
cut down this type of woman
hating harangue, we would be
behaving, instead, like "wooden
dolls."

Miller rational?
I cannot resist responding to
the character of a persistent
series ot opinion columns by
David Miller appearing in the
Daily.
Miller has consistently ad
dressed himself to issues of im
portance and of a complexity
seldom encountered in physics.
It is mainly because of the very
importance ot these issues, and
because I am glad to finally see
Stanford students indicate some
emergence from a cocoon of af
fluent apathy; that I will resist
addressing him in kind. I will
strive, rather for the objectivity
and "rationality" which is
Miller's ideal. The problems at
issue are too large.
For myselt, I find that I agree
with about half of Miller's con
clusions, although possibly for
quite different reasons. I hasten

to make clear that, for reasons
of time, and possibly mental
limitation. I do not teel that I
have a final answer to several of
these issues (i.e. conscription,
gun control, political parties).
Yet, it is clear to me that I have
availed myself of more source
material, as well as more open
reflection, than many who pro
fess such anwers. The answers
are there, but they will only be
reached in a truly open ex
amination and discourse which
Miller's approach precludes.
The major reason why this
approach is self-defeating is
that it is dishonest. Repression
is not an effective means of con
trol. Miller's articles are ram
pant with aggression and nasti
ness ("playing at soldier,"
"moral irresponsibility," "ver
bal vandalism." etc.) and su
percilious in tone. Yet all this is
swept under the aegis of some
sort of supreme "rationality"
which Miller professes to have a
patent on.
Rationality appears to have
several overlapping meanings.
Not the least of these is being in
tune with reality. Certainly not
the most of these is
algorithimacally arriving from
point A to point B. To contrast
these two extremes with an ex
ample from physics, it matters
little what the "next" decimal
place is in Plank's constant it
one is concerned with the behav
ior of microscopic masses in a

many-body problem — such as
tinding one's way to the grocery
store.
I contend that Miller does not
recognize his own motivation
for writing his columns, and
that this poisons their purported
intent. I would hope he would
either become more openly ag
gressive or more truly "ration
al." Or perhaps both.
I don't think there has been a
time in human history when
there have been issues and prob
lems of such widespread social
concern and real urgency — nu
clear proliferation being fore
most among these. These aren't
simple problems. They won't be
solved by dogmatism, egotism,
or any other ism. It seems the
first step toward solving any
problem is recognizing one's ig
norance. Not in some absolute,
or defeatist sense, but in the
qualified way in which it is real.
This opens the way to finding
the solution.

Lottery unfair
Michaei Calabrese, in an arti
cle entitled "Why Doves Should
Back the Draft," argues that a
"fair" lottery system would be
our best insurance against war.
As I pointed out in my earlier
article, the problem with this
argument is that there is no way

to make a draft fair. Over the
next decade our military will
need to recruit only about one
out of every eight young men
and women who turn '8. Unless
we ban volunteers, most ot this
need will be met by those who
elect to sign up.
Calabrese appears to believe
that by including upper-class in
dividuals, opposition to any war
would be stronger. In the first
place, a draft by lottery would
by definition select about halt ot
its victims from the lower half
ot the income scale.
Calabrese also makes the
point that today's army is near
ly 40 percent black. I am not
sure why this disturbs him. It
troubles me because it em
phasizes that blacks do not be
lieve they can succeed as well in
civilian life as in the military.
The military is to be con
gratulated for having provided a
relatively discrimination-free
environment. Civilian life ob
viously needs improvement.
However, the proportion of
blacks in the military cannot be
lowered unless a quota is estab
lished for blacks in the military,
or unless we abandon volunteer
service entirely. I would con
sider both alternatives in
tolerable.
