# USE lists objections in election challenge
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
listed 16 objections in a challenge filed
with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) last Thursday, con
testing the May 7 unionization election
which USE lost, 930 to 554.
Joyce Tipps-Coats, a Stanford Line
ar Accelerator secretary and spokes
person for the Office Staff Orgahizing
Committee (OSOC), said OSOC de
cided to challenge the University's ac
tions because "Stanford is not above
the law and should be accountable for
that."
Asked whether the clericals here
would regard this as an antagonistic
action, Tipps-Coats said it is "difficult
to evaluate the opinion of 180) people,
but there are a lot of people who want
to see us fight back. It is clear that
some things were done that were un
lawful."
Among others claims, the union
says the University:
""Interfered with the rights of em
ployees by singling out known union
adherents and publicly insulting and
inciting them;"
*"Promised benefits if the union
lost,"
•"Intimidated eligible voters with
loss of employment opportunities if
they supported the union."
""Promised employees salary in
creases during the critical period in
order to discourage their support of
the union;"
•"Made material misrepresenta
tion of facts concerning the union's
policies, programs, costs of member
ship. . and
•"Threatened to close the facility
and/or take other retaliatory meas
ures if the union won. . . ."
Although, as is customary, the ob
jections did not contain specific ex
amples, one of the objections was that
"The Stanford Daily polled and inter
rogated employees concerning their
support for the union."
Tipps-Coats did not want to give
specific examples at this time. She did
say that the University newsletters
were "objectionable in the way they
portrayed unions; in saying what
they've done here and at other places
the newsletters were misleading and
distorting."
Tipps-Coats said the the University
initially announced its wage increases
in the Dec. 10 Campus Report, much
sooner than the traditional annual an
nouncement in March.
Calling the claims "standard,"
Priscilla Wheeler, labor expert in the
University Counsel's office, said she
doesn't "believe that any objec
tionable behavior occurred."

Noting that there were few specifics
except tor the Daily poll, Wheeler said
that the University could make no
comment on specific examples until
the union published some.
No one from the union was available
to give specific examples of how the
University could close down its facil
ity. A labor expert at the Law School
said that this provision, common in
most industrial disputes, was proba
bly overlooked in the rush to meet the
five-day deadline established by the
NLRB tor tiling challenges.
The objections were filed after
Michael Dureitse of Locnl 71S. the
chapter of the Service Employees In
ternational Union which OSOC would
have joined had they won the election,
contacted Tipps-Coats and recom
mended that a challenge be filed. The
OSOC steering committee decided to
approve the challenge and Local 7's's
lawyers in San Francisco filed the ob
jections with the NLRB.
