## Prop. 2½ belt-tightening creates 'economic battleground' in Boston 
### Washington Post 
Boston — The voters of Mas
sachusetts weren't aware of it
at the time, but when they went
to the polls last Nov. 4 they were
taking a step that could send
coach Bill Allen from the
playing fields of Madison Park
High School to the cafes of Par
is.
That was the day the elec
torate overwhelmingly en
dorsed Proposition 2V 2 , a str
ingent limitation on local prop
erty taxes that will cost 351 Mas
sachusetts cities and towns $450
million in revenues in the com
ing fiscal year unless the state
legislature steps in to help.

As a result of that, Bill Allen,
a veteran of 10 years of coaching
an inner city varsity football
team in the Boston public
schools, has received his dis
missal notice.
Allen is still hoping for a mir
acle. The playing fields of
Madison Park are where he
feels he belongs and is needed,
but as the days go by the thought
is sinking in that maybe this is
for real. And so he has been
thinking that maybe he will just
chuck it all and go to Paris.
Allen is not alone. Because of
Proposition 2Vz, police stations,
firehouses and hundreds of
schools are earmarked for clos

ing.
In earlier times, a taxpayers'
initiative such as Proposition
2'/ 2 would have been quickly off
set by federal or state aid. But
under the emerging "Rea
ganomics," the federal govern
ment is sharply reducing its aid
to schools, colleges, the handi
capped, the old and the bureauc
racies that provide public ser
vices.
State governments, mean
while, seem more inclined to
follow Washington's budget-cut
ting lead than to make up the
difference.
The upshot is that local com
munities are being left to set the
priorities and take the heat as
protests over reduced services
wash over them. Battles that
once took place in Washington,
D.C., are being shoved into the
laps of governors, mayors,
selectmen and school boards.
If Boston is an example of
what is ahead for the rest of the
country, communities are in for
a protracted period of civil
strife pitting policemen and
firemen against teachers; older
public servants against younger
ones not protected by seniority;
newly hired blacks with jobs
safeguarded by affirmative ac
tion statutes against white vet

erans lacking such guarantees,
and union leaderships against
their members.
When Boston and neighboring
communities announced cuts in
public services, angry citizens
went into the streets, blocking
traffic and demanding restora
tion of fire and police protec
tion. But there was no com
parable outpouring when Mayor
Kevin White threatened in late
April to shut down schools serv
ing 64,000 students for lack of
funds.
Massachusetts Com
missioner of Education Gregory
Anrig warns that if there is no
help before next year, "then 1
think we are basically dismantl
ing public education in the com
munities affected."
Anrig and some other Ameri
can educators who are looking
ahead at the 1980s have begun to
wonder whether the cuts might
not even force some fundamen
tal changes in the structure of
high schools — changes that
might do away with sports and
extracurricular programs and
leave schools doing little more
than running classrooms and
stripped-down academic pro
grams.
