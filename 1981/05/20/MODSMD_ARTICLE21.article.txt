# White House blocks intra-party battle
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — The White
House has stepped in to heal a
rift between the chairman of the
Republican Party and leaders of
the right-wing independent ex
penditure groups that helped the
GOP win the presidency and the
Senate last year.
The feud is the only cloud on
the Republican horizon — in
contrast to the embattled and
divided Democrats — as mod
erates have acquiesced to the
conservative tide on economics
and almost every other issue.
But President Ronald Reagan's
hand-picked chairman of the
Republican National Commit
tee, Richard Richards of Utah,
has become embroiled in a pub
lic war of words with the New
Right organizations.
He has called the groups ir
responsible and dangerous and
said their tactics could create a
sympathetic backlash for liber
als. Some of the groups' leaders
have responded that they helped
put Reagan in the White House
and that Richards is the one
helping liberals with his com
ments.
In an effort at peacemaking,
Richards said that he had asked
Lyn Nofziger, the top White
House political aide, to arrange
a private meeting for the two
sides. One of the New Right
leaders, direct-mail expert
Richard Viguerie, offered the
use of his suburban Virginia
home, but Richards insisted on
more neutral turf. The meeting
was to be held over breakfast
yesterday morning at the
Capitol Hill Club, a Republican
gathering place next door to na
tional committee headquarters.
Richards and Nofziger were

to be joined by Viguerie; John
(Terry) Dolan, chairman of the
National Conservative Political
Action Committee; Howard
Phillips, director of the Conser
vative Caucus; and Paul
Weyrich, director of the Com
mittee tor the Survival of a Free
Congress.
Independent expenditure
groups are organizations uncon
nected to any candidate or par
ty. They promote a political phi
losophy or stand on particular
issues, are not bound by the fed
eral contribution limits im
posed on candidates, and spent
about $15 million on the 1980
elections, nearly all ot it in sup
port of Republicans. Some liber
al independent expenditure
groups have been formed since
the election to offset the conser
vative groups.
The best hope from Tuesday's
session seemed to be a cease
fire, not a peace treaty. Rich
ards said in an interview, "I'm
not backing off my views, but
I'd just as soon get out ot the
newspapers on this one." F*hil
lips said he would withhold
judgment until afterward, but
added. "I'm a conservative, not
a Republican."
Administration officials have
said they are anxious to main
tain good relations with the in
dependent expenditure groups
for at least two reasons: first,
because they can be useful in
campaigns and second, because
there is concern by some that
without good relations the
groups could become "loose
cannons" which would hurt the
administration more than help
it.
