# Symptom of deeper party problems
## Democrats express concern about leadership 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Before the big budget
vote that signaled that the Democrats
had lost effective control of both houses
of Congress for the first time in 28 years,
two southern representatives were talk
ing about their party.
"If Tip is representative of Demo
crats, I don't have a Democrat in my dis
trict," one of them said of their leader,
Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill of Massa
chusetts.
"Well, I could pretty much say that,
too," the other replied.
Later, in recounting that conversa
tion, one of the congressmen said:
"Off the record, we're going to have a
new speaker if the Democrats retain con
trol of the House next time. I think Tip's
an intelligent fellow. I think he'll see the
writing on the wall."

News analysis

The murmurings of internal discon
tent about leadership ot the nation's
oldest political party are commonplace
on Capitol Hill these days and not re
stricted to the more conservative south
ern Democratic ranks. Liberals and
middle-of-the-road, young and ex
perienced, many teel uneasy.

But complaints about the leaders are
really only symptoms of deeper troubles
tor the Democrats. The party has lost its
way. A once-dominant coalition is now
splintered. Retormers and pragmatists,
famous tor their inventiveness, now have
no sure ideas of the country's future. . .
or their own. This season in Washington
has put the Democrats at bay. . . and in
jeopardy. ,
When Speaker O'Neill traveled to Aus
tralia during the recent congressional
Easter recess, a northern liberal bluntly
expressed his teelings about the state of
Democratic leadership.
"Tip is reeling on the ropes,'" Rep. Les
Aspin wrote in a blistering newsletter
mailed to his Wisconsin constituents.
. . Tip doesn't understand the ex
plosions that have been going on since
November. He's in a tog. Tip is smart
enough to understand that there's been a
seismic event, but he also realizes that
he doesn't understand its nature. He's
not part of what's happening and he has
no idea where to go."
But O'Neill is "not the only source ot
problems" for the Democrats, Aspin
went on. His prescription:
"The Democratic Party needs some
new leadership and it needs it badly. I
note the words of Congressman Henry

Reuss (another Wisconsin Democrat) a
lew weeks ago. He said, The Democrats
get credit for being soft-hearted and soft
headed and the Republicans tor being
hard-hearted and hard-headed.' I think
he's right. What we need now are Demo
crats who are soft-hearted and hard
headed."
Critical words by Democrats about
Democrats are not restricted to the
House of Representatives. You car. hear
similiar complaints, publicly and
privately, about Sen. Robert Byrd's
( W. Va. ) leadership of Democrats in the
Senate, although they are less strongly
expressed
"We have zigged when we should have
zagged,*' Sen. Ernest Hollings of South
Carolina says.
His fellow southerner, Sen. Dale
Bumpers of Arkansas, agrees. "I don't
mind saying this on the record — of
course. I'm not anxious to see it in print
— but my feeling is that there is time for
a new generation ol leadership in the
Democratic Party. Anything else is
going to be perceived as doing business in
the same old way, defending the same
old indefensible programs. I think there
is a way to defend and champion our
coalition and the things we've always
stood tor, but with more — I'm trying to

think of the word — realism. Yes, a more
realistic way."
Their northern colleague, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan ot New York, draws a
more general portrait of Democratic dis
array in the Congress that few could dis
pute:
"My feeling about the Congress is not
that we lost the last election but that we
seem to have persuaded ourselves that
we've lost the next election. "
Behind those words lies a larger politi
cal story, one that contains all the classic
dimensions ot a great political party's
rise and fall, with suspenseful questions
about whether it can recover its old
glory.
Now, as their own leading figures free
ly acknowledge, the Democrats tace
their greatest moment of crisis. Some in
their ranks will tell you their problems
are only starting. The Republicans, they
fear, stand to win the House of Repre
sentatives next year, which would re
verse the pattern that has existed since
1934 in which the party winning the presi
dency loses congressional seats in the
next otf-year election. A more apocalyp
tic thesis exists: that the Ronald Reagan
Republican victory of 1980 signaled the
end of Democratic control ol the White
House for the rest of this century.
