## Stanford Daily beats Daily Cal 
### Bill Beyda 
The Stanford Daily sottball team rebounded from its loss to the
Professional Journalism Fellows a week ago to beat the Daily Cali
fornian Weenies 12-9, in a hard fought contest last Friday evening
which stretched until dusk.
The Daily was behind 8-3 in the sixth inning, when they rallied to
score nine runs to take a 12-8 lead over the Weenies. The Daily in
serted ace reliever Pat "Tug McGraw" Carroll, who pitched three
scoreless innings and gave up one run in the tenth (the Daily telt bad
for the poor Weenies and gave them an extra inning to catch up).
Carroll was the winning pitcher, relieving Joan "Tom Seaver"
O'Connell, whose patented "Joannieball" was ineffective against
the Daily Californian's hitters.
Part of the Daily's success can be attributed to outstanding field
ing, including an amazing (living catch in left field by Clay "Cleon
Jones" Moltz in the eighth inning to shake up the Weenies. James
"Ron Swoboda" Higa sacrificed his body unselfishly in attempting
to catch a foul ball, and returned from his escapade with blood
streaming down his face. The gutless Weenies couldn't understand
why anyone would be such a competitor (it they knew how to com
pete, they'd be at Stanford, not Berkeley).
Other injuries included ace reliever Carroll's hamstring and
Berkeley's pride.
If parallels can be drawn between the 1969 Mets and the Daily's
preformance against Berkeley, then the PJF game was still the ear
ly '60s for the Daily.
The Professional Journalism Fellows defeated the Daily in sott
ball a week ago Saturday at Angell Field 15- 0. This was the first win
for the PJF in years, as Harry Press (good name for a journalist,
eh?) pitched them to their victory. The Daily team resembled the
not-so-amazing 1968 Mets, as they committed more errors in the
first four innings than the A's are likely to commit all season.
The PJF are journalists on leave from their jobs for a year to
study at Stanford. The traditional Fall and Spring battles between
the Daily and the PJFs are always graced with good spirits, smiles
and lots ot beer.
All-Star performers included Mike "Ed Charles" Vaska, Sam
"Gil Hodges" Howe, Doug "Tommy Agree" Jehl, Karen "Wayne
Garrett" Halbo, Kim "Tim Foli" Brown and Bill "Bud Harrelson"
Beyda.
Aside from Howe's home run, most ot the rest of the Daily's runs
came on cheap grounders and fielding errors. Confident that they
could turn the tables on their elders, the Daily challenged the PJF
to a doubleheader. "We're too old, you can't expect us to play anoth
er game," Press said.
Disgruntled by the loss, one of the Daily staff members com
mented, "Don't worry, we'll get'em next year â€” better yet, let's lie
like hell when we write the article!"
