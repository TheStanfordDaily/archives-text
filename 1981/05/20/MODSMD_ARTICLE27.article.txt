As expected, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess received the
news that his team would indeed
gain an at-large berth and there
fore be included in the Regional
play-offs, on Monday afternoon
via a phone call from the NCAA.
34 teams in the nation advance
to eight Regions throughout the

country, with the Regional win
ners advancing to the College
World Series in Omaha, Nebras
ka, to be held May 29-June 6.
"I'm just happy that we're
going, first of all," said Mar
quess in reaction to the call.
"We're really looking forward
to it. We're playing as well as we
have all year."
The Cards' region, which in
cludes four teams, will be run on
a double elimination format,
with the Lamar Cardinals (yes,
they're red and white also)
being Stanford's first opponent
Friday at 1:30. Lamar, the
Southland Conference Cham
pion, carries a 55-24 record into
the post-season competition,
and they have taken the con
ference title four out of the last
six years.

If Stanford wins, they will
play the winner of the BYU-Tex
as game on Saturday. If they
lose, they will play the loser ot
the Longhorn-Wildcat affair.
Losing that one would mean
they would be sent home pre
maturely, but if they win, they
would continue on. Look for a
tull preview in Friday's Daily.
