The Stanford women's crew team upset UC-Berkeley last
weekend in the Western Women's Invitational Rowing Cham
pionships, held at Redwood Shores. It was the first time the
Cardinals had beaten previously undefeated Cal.
"We got what we wanted," said coach John Davis. Stanford
now ranks second in the Pacific-10 behind the University of
Washington.
"The Stanford women have come a long way," said Denise
Sankster, who rowed for Cal tor four years. "John Davis is a
helluva coach. He was a national oarsman in his time."
The novice women finished third in their division, beating
out San Diego State. Cal was first, followed by the University
of Washington.
"They are a fantastic group," said Tom Brown, coach of
the novice team. Brown transferred from Orange Coast Col
lege where he rowed for three years. He rowed with the Stan
ford crew for one season.
"Absolutely none of the team has rowed before," the coach
pointed out.
Unlike most sports, rowing is not seasonal. "They work all
year round," said former oarswoman Mary Jenneskens.
"You do it because you want to."
The team works out four mornings a week during the fall,
and six mornings during winter and spring, while meets are
held on Saturdays and Sundays.
The women's program began only five years ago. "It's the
only sport that you can start otf knowing nothing about, and
they teach you everything," said novice coxain Kathryn
Mills.
