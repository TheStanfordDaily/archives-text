## 
### Paul Brewer 
The Stanford men's track
team finished up its dual meet
season last Saturday by beating
Montana 95-43 and losing to
Washington State 104-57 at a
meet in Pullman, Washington.
The Montana half of the meet
gave the Cards their fourth win
ot the season, while the WSU
Cougars handed them their
tenth loss.
500-meter runner John
Schaer kept his metric mile un
defeated streak alive by win
ning his newfound specialty in a
quick 3:47.0. He moved to the
front a little earlier than is his
custom, and with a powerful
drive over the entire last lap.
Schaer, a junior who focused on
the 800 meter in his first two col
legiate seasons, will definitely
run the 150) meter in the post
season meets.
Another runner in a new event
this season is Rod Berry. Berry,
also a junior, won the
steeplechase at WSU and is un
decided on whether he will run
that event or the 5000 meters at

the upcoming Pac-'O cham
pionships.
The distance runners weren't
the only active athletes on Sat
urday, however. One of the
brightest Stanford efforts of the
meet came in the 400-meter re
lay when the Cardinal squad of
Vincent White, Kevin Jones,
Fred Williams, and Darrin
Nelson finished second but
clocked a seasonal best of 40.94
seconds.
Other Cardinal winning per
formances were turned in by
Dave Thomson in the discus,

Craig Awbrey in the shot put,
and Garry Shumway in the 40)
meter hurdles.
Meanwhile, treshman dis
tance runner Ellen Lyons high
lighted the low-key Stanford
women's Classic held last Fri
day at Stanford Stadium. The
hard-running cross country star
broke teammate Kim
Schnurpfeil's school record in
the 000 meters, with her fine
34: 0.5.
The women also sent a few
athletes to the world class Pepsi
Invitational at UCLA
