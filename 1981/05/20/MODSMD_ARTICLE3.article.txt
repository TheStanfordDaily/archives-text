# To All Members of the Office and Library Support Staff

### 
The University has learned that the Stanford Daily and
USELocal 715 union have been conducting separate surveys of
office and library support staff to determine their feelings about
unionization.
A number of employees have expressed concerns about
these surveys because they view their vote on May 7 as a per
sonal and private matter.
The University has no involvement in these surveys and
wants you to know that you are free to respond or not to
respond to the questions.
The University also wants to assure all eligible voters that the
May 7 election is indeed a secret ballot election. No one—not
the University, nor the union, nor the National Labor Relations
Board—will know how you voted.
So roflflrdJosffl of these survaye, aff offlco and //brary supporf
staff should be sure to vote on May 7.

The University News and Publications service purchased an ad which ran the
day before the 'Daily' poll of was released. The ad emphasized to the office and
library support staff that the upcoming vote for the union election would be by
secret ballot.
