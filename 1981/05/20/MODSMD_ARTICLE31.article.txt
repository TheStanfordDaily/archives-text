Budget amendment approved
Washington — The Senate Judiciary Committee, giving
a big boost to a goal long held by conservatives, voted 1 -1
yesterday to approve a proposed constitutional amend
ment for a balanced federal budget.
The only exception would be in time of war or when a
three-fifths majority in both houses ot Congress vote for
deficit spending.
"The people of the country want it," said Sen. Strom
Thurmond. (R-S.C.), who started suggesting such an
amendment when Dwight Eisenhower was president. "I
believe we have a fine chance to get it through the Con
gress this year."
Budget director David Stockman has said the Reagan
administration would prefer to balance the budget through
already-existing congressional avenues than be locked in
by the Constitution.
If approved by Congress, the proposed amendment
would take effect two years after being ratified by three
fourths of the 50 states.
Syrian missile threat unresolved
Jerusalem — U.S. envoy Philip Habib met yesterday
with the leaders of Syria and Israel, but his effort to avert
a showdown over Syria's missiles in Lebanon was clouded
by signs ot Israeli impatience and Syrian charges he was
covering for an impending Israeli attack
Habib flew to Israel from Damascus, where he spent
two to four hours with Syrian President Hatez Assad, tell
ing reporter's afterward. "All I can say is that the diplo
matic efforts will continue."
As he was meeting with Assad. Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir was telling reporters in Jerusalem that Is
rael will not wait indefinitely for diplomacy to remove the
Soviet-made anti-aircraft missiles — that the Israeli air
torce will eventually be called in.
The threat of war has hung over the Middle East since
Israel shot down two Syrian helicopter gunships operating
against the Lebanese Christians in eastern Lebanon April
28. Syria responded the next day by moving SAM-6 mis
siles into the area.
Pope's assailant questioned
Rome — Pope John Paul II was listed in "vastly im
proved" condition yesterday, sipping tea for breakfast,
doing light physical exercises and resuming Vatican busi
ness for the first time since a terrorist shot and wounded
him.

Meanwhile, investigators said the 23-year-old suspect.
Mehmet Ali Agca of Turkey, was trying to confuse his in
terrogators by bragging that he made plans to kill Queen
Elizabeth II and other world dignitaries.
Agca is charged with attempted murder in the shooting
of the pope last Wednesday in St. Peter's Square.
Schmidt threatens to resign
Bonn — By putting his oftice publicly on the line last
weekend. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has
placed himself out on a political limb on which he well
could be left hanging for a considerable time.
Long heard to grumble to his friends and in close party
circles about how he might quit his office prematurely for
a less hassled life, Schmidt went public this week in a
speech to members of his Social Democratic Party with an
implicit threat to resign if some in the party did not stop
sniping at NATO plans to station new medium-range nu
clear missiles in Europe.
By clearly staking his continued leadership on his par
ty's unwavering support for the NATO missiles decision.
Schmidt sent a signal to Washington ot what he would
stake on keeping to the alliance course, perhaps in hopes of
trading that tough stance against further U.S. commit
ments to resume the missile talks.
Japan reaffirms ban on weapons ship
Tokyo — The Japanese government stuck to its 21-year
old story yesterday that American ships carrying nuclear
weapons have been barred from Japan's waters and ports
despite new disclosures by former officials that there nev
er had been such an agreement.
The conflict burst into the open in a series of newspaper
interviews that pitted the memories of former key of
ficials against the version the government is clinging to.
The issue of nuclear weapons is extremely sensitive in
this country that had two cities devastated by atomic
bombs in World War 11. and successive Japanese govern
ments have avoided the issue of whether U.S. naval forces
carry nuclear weapons.
The controversy arose Monday when former U.S. Am
bassador Edwin 0. Reischauer disclosed in a newspaper
interview that since 1960 an agreement had permitted nu
clear-armed American warships to dock routinely in
Japanese ports and pass through Japanese waters.
Reagan waffles on draft stance
Washington — President Ronald Reagan will continue
to oppose a military draft "just as long as he can," but
probably will support its reinstatement if the armed ser
vices are unable to meet new recruiting requirements.
Secretary ot Defense Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Although recent recruitment figures reflect an im
proved situation. Weinberger said, Reagan may have to
accept "the tact that the volunteer system may not pro
duce enough people" tor the expanded armed forces
planned by the administration.
Reagan is known to be deeply concerned that — despite
his philosophical opposition to the dratt and the political
sensitivity of the issue — he soon may face the difficult
choice of either approving a draft or presiding over a mili
tary with critical manpower needs.
Social Security slash called unlikely
Washington — Congressional sources say that President
Ronald Reagan's plan to slash Social Security checks for

early retirees has stirred up such a public outcry there is
little chance that 62-year-olds will lose benefits next year.
In public and in private, leaders in both parties are ques
tioning the Reagan administration's political judgment
over the way it sprang the plan, which calls for major re
ductions starting in 1982. especially for persons retiring
before age 65.
IRA blast of British truck kills five
Belfast — An ambush team of IRA bombers blew up a
British armored vehicle with a half-ton of explosives yes
terday, killing five soldiers in the "God-almightv" blast,
the bloodiest blow against the British army here in two
years.
At the Maze prison near Belfast. Irish Republican Army
hunger striker Raymond McCreesh was reported blind,
nearly deaf and slipping into a coma in the 59th day of his
fast to the death.
CIA reappraises Russian oil supply
Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency con
ceded yesterday that its controversial 1977 forecast of fall
ing Soviet-oil production was too low. But in a rare
statement, the CIA maintained that the basic trend pre
dicted then — of Soviet output reaching a plateau, then

falling — still would occur over the longer term.
Both the Carter and Reagan administrations cited that
prediction to justify, in part, U.S. military preparations to
defend the Mideast oil fields from a possible seizure by So
viet forces moving through Iran or Afghanistan.
Critics of the 1977 study complained that CIA analysts
underestimated the ability of the Kremlin to pour money
into oil exploration and recovery efforts, at the expense of
other sectors of their economy, to keep up production.
Stocks decline
New York — Stock prices declined yesterday as the gov
ernment reported that both the economy and prices rose
more than had been thought in the first three months of
1981.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 5.76 to
980.0 as declining stocks outnumbered gainers by a 3-2
margin.

per 50s coastside to the 60s inland. Chance of rain 20 per
