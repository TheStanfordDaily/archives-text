## 
### 
A man carrying an automatic pistol
and wearing a gorilla mask attempted
to rob the Oasis Beer Garden Monday.
Larry Riley, 35, manager ol the pop
ular student "hangout," required six
stitches in his scalp at Stanford Hospi
tal after he was allegedly pistol
whipped by the suspect, who is still at
large.
Riley told reporters he answered a
knock on the door while preparing to
open for business. He said he was ex
pecting a bread delivery. Instead, he
was greeted by the bandit, described
by police as 5 feet 8 inches tall and
wearing a dark blue windbreaker.
"He thought it was a joke until he

saw that gun," Dominic Peloso of the
Menlo Park Police Department told
the press.
When the would-be robber turned
his head momentarily, Riley said he
grabbed a chair and attempted to de
flect the gun. The two struggled, the
manager threw the chair at his as
sailant and attempted to run out the
back door, he said.
As Riley tried to get out of the build
ing, the assailant hit him twice on the
head with his gun, knocking him to the
ground outside.
The would-be robber, who police say
did not take any cash, fled in a yellow
van.
