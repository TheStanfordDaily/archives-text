# Law School 'Dean search' committee appointments
## Law students seek more input 
### Kirk J. Bloede 
Controversy has erupted at the Law
School over the appointment of mem
bers to the search committee to select
a new dean to replace Charles Meyers.
After Meyers announced his resig
nation Aprii 4. University President
Donald Kennedy made his appoint
ments to the committee April 24. How
ever, students learned nothing about
the appointments until May r, and
then only through a letter by commit
tee chair Robert Rabin, a law pro
fessor.
The committee is composed of five
Law School faculty members, Provost

Albert Hastorf and two law students.
Kennedy's office declined com
ment. He is drat ting a response to the
criticism which will be ready Friday,
according to Marlene Wine, his spe
cial assistant.
The day atter the letter was re
leased, law students circulated and
sent Kennedy a petition objecting to
the choice of the two student repre
sentatives and the late notification.
Mark Brewer, a senior law student
who helped organize the petition
drive, said that the objection was not
to the student appointees, Glen Nager
and Ron Noble, but rather to the way
in which the choices were made.
"The students chosen do not repre
sent the broad range of interests and
backgrounds at the Law School," the
petition said.
The petition, which received 166 sig
natures or one-third of the school's en
rollment, further calls for re
consideration ot the choices made for
the committee and proposes an alter
nate method of selection.
But many ot the signers ot the peti
tion have reconsidered their approval
of it.
Nager questioned the hasty circula
tion of the petition, mentioning that
some signers had second thoughts lat
er and also pointing out that since the
positions are appointed by Kennedy,

he must determine how much student
input is sought.
Stephane Atencio, co-chair of La
Raza, the Chicano Law Student or
ganization, and John Preiskel, co
chair ol the Black American Law Stu
dent Association (BALSA), also said
that some signers had reconsidered.
They maintained that it was pos
sible to interpret the petition as a per
sonal attack on the two student selec
tions and that some of the signers,
while objecting to the method used in
determining the two students, had no
knowledge of who they actually were.
Upon finding out who the appointees
were, students became concerned that
their signing of the petition could be
misinterpreted as disapproval of the
appointments per se, rather than dis
approval of the procedure used to


Charles Meyers
