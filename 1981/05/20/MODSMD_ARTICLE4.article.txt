# Law School 'Dean search' committee appointments
## Law students seek more input 
### Kirk J. Bloede 
Controversy has erupted at the Law
School over the appointment of mem
bers to the search committee to select
a new dean to replace Charles Meyers.
After Meyers announced his resig
nation Aprii 4. University President
Donald Kennedy made his appoint
ments to the committee April 24. How
ever, students learned nothing about
the appointments until May r, and
then only through a letter by commit
tee chair Robert Rabin, a law pro
fessor.
The committee is composed of five
Law School faculty members, Provost

Albert Hastorf and two law students.
Kennedy's office declined com
ment. He is drat ting a response to the
criticism which will be ready Friday,
according to Marlene Wine, his spe
cial assistant.
The day atter the letter was re
leased, law students circulated and
sent Kennedy a petition objecting to
the choice of the two student repre
sentatives and the late notification.
Mark Brewer, a senior law student
who helped organize the petition
drive, said that the objection was not
to the student appointees, Glen Nager
and Ron Noble, but rather to the way
in which the choices were made.
"The students chosen do not repre
sent the broad range of interests and
backgrounds at the Law School," the
petition said.
The petition, which received 166 sig
natures or one-third of the school's en
rollment, further calls for re
consideration ot the choices made for
the committee and proposes an alter
nate method of selection.
But many ot the signers ot the peti
tion have reconsidered their approval
of it.
Nager questioned the hasty circula
tion of the petition, mentioning that
some signers had second thoughts lat
er and also pointing out that since the
positions are appointed by Kennedy,

he must determine how much student
input is sought.
Stephane Atencio, co-chair of La
Raza, the Chicano Law Student or
ganization, and John Preiskel, co
chair ol the Black American Law Stu
dent Association (BALSA), also said
that some signers had reconsidered.
They maintained that it was pos
sible to interpret the petition as a per
sonal attack on the two student selec
tions and that some of the signers,
while objecting to the method used in
determining the two students, had no
knowledge of who they actually were.
Upon finding out who the appointees
were, students became concerned that
their signing of the petition could be
misinterpreted as disapproval of the
appointments per se, rather than dis
approval of the procedure used to


Charles Meyers
make the selections.
Atencio and Preiskel also said that
their organizations had sought input to
the choice of who would serve on the
committee (both faculty and stu
dents) immediately upon hearing ot
Meyers' resignation.
Their repeated calls to Hastorf s of
fice and a letter sent to both Kennedy
and Hastorf were dismissed as pre
mature inquiries. Atencio and Pre
iskel said they felt that they were not
treated fairly by the University. Their
primary concern was not removal of
the two current student represent
atives but making student input a part
of the selection process.
Complicating the issue further is
the fact that the "precedent" tor the
appointment process — established in
1976, when the student appointments
went to the presidents ot the Lair Re
view and the Law Students' Associa
tion — is not even being followed.
Brewer pointed out that one of the
two appointees, Noble, is not the cur
rent, but the past president of the Law
Students' Association. He also cited
that the current president, Barbara
Hulburt, made the dean selection
committee an issue in her campaign.
Brewer said that these two positions
represent the faculty's view of the
"ideal law student" and may leave
large elements of the population un

represented. He added that the presi
dent of the Law Review is selected by
the vote of the 30 or so members of the
Lair Rericir staft and thus hardly rep
resents the entire student body.
Hulburt believed it was unfortunate
that objections to the process itselt
have been confused with personal at
tacks on the two representatives.
She feared that the wording of the
petition may have indicated that the
signers questioned the ability of the
students to be representative of, for
example, women's issues, since they
are both male. Hulburt expressed her
confidence in the ability of the appoin

tees to represent groups other than
those to which they may personally
belong.
Acting Dean ot the Law School, J.
Keith Mann, noted that the students
organizing the petition were not the
only people dissatisfied, citing alumni
who have sought input. He reiterated
that the selections were Kennedy's
and that his office was the appropriate
place to address any criticism of the
appointments.
The committee has already had its
first meeting and will likely work on
the selection of the dean through the
summer.

fice and a letter sent to both Kennedy
and Hastorf were dismissed as pre
mature inquiries. Atencio and Pre
iskel said they felt that they were not
treated fairly by the University. Their
primary concern was not removal of
the two current student represent
atives but making student input a part
of the selection process.
Complicating the issue further is
the fact that the "precedent" tor the
appointment process — established in
1976, when the student appointments
went to the presidents ot the Lair Re
view and the Law Students' Associa
tion — is not even being followed.
Brewer pointed out that one of the
two appointees, Noble, is not the cur
rent, but the past president of the Law
Students' Association. He also cited
that the current president, Barbara
Hulburt, made the dean selection
committee an issue in her campaign.
Brewer said that these two positions
represent the faculty's view of the
"ideal law student" and may leave
large elements of the population un

represented. He added that the presi
dent of the Law Review is selected by
the vote of the 30 or so members of the
Lair Rericir staft and thus hardly rep
resents the entire student body.
Hulburt believed it was unfortunate
that objections to the process itselt
have been confused with personal at
tacks on the two representatives.
She feared that the wording of the
petition may have indicated that the
signers questioned the ability of the
students to be representative of, for
example, women's issues, since they
are both male. Hulburt expressed her
confidence in the ability of the appoin

tees to represent groups other than
those to which they may personally
belong.
Acting Dean ot the Law School, J.
Keith Mann, noted that the students
organizing the petition were not the
only people dissatisfied, citing alumni
who have sought input. He reiterated
that the selections were Kennedy's
and that his office was the appropriate
place to address any criticism of the
appointments.
The committee has already had its
first meeting and will likely work on
the selection of the dean through the
summer.
Controversy has erupted at the Law
School over the appointment of mem
bers to the search committee to select
a new dean to replace Charles Meyers.
After Meyers announced his resig
nation Aprii 4. University President
Donald Kennedy made his appoint
ments to the committee April 24. How
ever, students learned nothing about
the appointments until May r, and
then only through a letter by commit
tee chair Robert Rabin, a law pro
fessor.
The committee is composed of five
Law School faculty members, Provost

Albert Hastorf and two law students.
Kennedy's office declined com
ment. He is drat ting a response to the
criticism which will be ready Friday,
according to Marlene Wine, his spe
cial assistant.
The day atter the letter was re
leased, law students circulated and
sent Kennedy a petition objecting to
the choice of the two student repre
sentatives and the late notification.
Mark Brewer, a senior law student
who helped organize the petition
drive, said that the objection was not
to the student appointees, Glen Nager
and Ron Noble, but rather to the way
in which the choices were made.
"The students chosen do not repre
sent the broad range of interests and
backgrounds at the Law School," the
petition said.
The petition, which received 166 sig
natures or one-third of the school's en
rollment, further calls for re
consideration ot the choices made for
the committee and proposes an alter
nate method of selection.
But many ot the signers ot the peti
tion have reconsidered their approval
of it.
Nager questioned the hasty circula
tion of the petition, mentioning that
some signers had second thoughts lat
er and also pointing out that since the
positions are appointed by Kennedy,

he must determine how much student
input is sought.
Stephane Atencio, co-chair of La
Raza, the Chicano Law Student or
ganization, and John Preiskel, co
chair ol the Black American Law Stu
dent Association (BALSA), also said
that some signers had reconsidered.
They maintained that it was pos
sible to interpret the petition as a per
sonal attack on the two student selec
tions and that some of the signers,
while objecting to the method used in
determining the two students, had no
knowledge of who they actually were.
Upon finding out who the appointees
were, students became concerned that
their signing of the petition could be
misinterpreted as disapproval of the
appointments per se, rather than dis
approval of the procedure used to


Charles Meyers
make the selections.
Atencio and Preiskel also said that
their organizations had sought input to
the choice of who would serve on the
committee (both faculty and stu
dents) immediately upon hearing ot
Meyers' resignation.
