# Council orders DU apology
## 
### Peter Finch 
The Inter-Fraternity Council Judi
cial Committee met Monday night to
determine the fate ot three Delta Up
silon pledges caught trespassing in a
Palo Alto bamboo patch two weeks
ago.
According to members of the com
mittee, the pledges, who were propo
sing to remove several bamboo stalks
for the DUs traditional luau, will be
requested to write a letter of apology
to the owners of the bamboo patch.
DU Resident Assistant Bill Barnum
said he found the request "fairly rea
sonable," and assumed that the
pledges would write a letter ot
apology.

The IFC Judicial Committee re
cently took considerably harsher ac
tion in reccomending punishment tor
the Phi Delta Theta house. Caught
throwing several pledges into the shal
low end ot a nearby swimming pool
with their legs tied, the Phi Delts were
handed a one quarter social probation
and a $300 tine.
Members ot the committee, how
ever, deny that the Phi Delts were
only punished so severely as to set an
example for the other fraternities.
IFC president Richard David called
the Phi Delt and DU issues "unrelated
incidents," stressing that the DU
pledges did "nothing wrong."
"It was nothing but circumstancial
evidence." said David Sherman, a

member of the Judicial Committee.
"There were no formal charges made
by the police, no formal charges made
by the people who owned the bamboo
and the DUs had no bamboo in their
posession."
Sherman explained that the Phi
Delt's punishment was largely due to
two "buzz words which cause the Uni
versity to hit the panic button: hazing
and alcohol," and noted that neither
were involved in the DU incident.
Sherman also mentioned that the
IFC may formulate a set policy re
garding bamboo stealing for next
year. Houses caught stealing bamboo,
he said, could have their luau parties
automatically canceled
