# Okada's atmosphere is 'less tense,' say students

### Bill Beyda Third last in a series 
Okada. the Asian American theme
house, was not included in Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons' memo to
University President Donald Kennedy
about problems in ethnic theme
houses. Assistant Dean of Student Af
fairs for Residential Education Alice
Supton states. "The residents of
Okada. both Asian American and non-
Asian American, seem to function
well as a community."
Why is Okada generally regarded by
both its residents and jthe office of
Hiwidentifll JSducMtion dx a prime ex
ample of an etfinlc tficmc nousr tfiat
works well?
David Chin. Resident Fellow at
Okada, attributes the house's success
to its members.

Psews analysis

"There's a family atmosphere in
Okada. . .perhaps it's because Asian
Americans are more assimilated as a
group than other minorities."
Racial tension is minimal in Okada,
according to Chin. "The major issue
last quarter," Chin said, "was wheth
er to play disco or rock music at our
parties. Last year our big problem
was deciding how much of the house's
funds should be spent on alcohol."
Most Okada residents the Daily in
terviewed agreed. "There's a really
good feeling in this house." said one
resident. Okada is also the site of the
Japanese Tea House, and many resi
dents point to its "success" as another
indicator ot the house's healthy at
mosphere.
Okada's "success" conflicts with
the argument that some Zapata stu
dents put forward stating theme
houses could not succeed it the rooms
were "undesirable" doubles, as are
the majority ot rooms in both Wilbur
and Stern.
Yet one non-minority student who
lived in Okada during the 1978-79 and
1979-80 school years said that Okada

wasn't always as "free from tension
as its residents today claim.
"The house goes in cycles â€” two
years ago we centered on issues such
as Angel Island. Coolie labor.
.Japanese interment during World War
II and stereotypes that residents
brought into the house." said the stu
dent.
"The result was a very theme-ori
ented house, but a tense house. Last
year the residence staff emphasized
Asian culture, and other positive
aspects a theme house can examine,
and the result was a less tense house.
Th 112 resident staff can make or u
tficme noir^r.'
The student added, T did learn
more in the tense atmosphere, be
cause I understood what Asian Ameri
cans went through. I think the major
problem with ethnic theme houses is
that some residents that drew poorly
just aren't interested and resent being
placed there."
Present house residents have mixed
feelings about Okada's "family" at
mosphere. Most residents the Daily
talked to were enthusiastic about
Okada, and most enjoyed living there.
One non-minority freshman agreed
that. "Okada is a great place to live,
and there's a great feeling here, but I
don't think we got as much as we could
have out of this experience. The resi
dence staff has tried to protect us
from radical Asian American groups
with different ideas, and though this
year has not been very tense. I think
we could have gotten more out of the
experience if the resident staff took
more of a hands-off attitude."
The residents of Okada. however,
have managed to create an ethnic
theme house where most everyone, in
cluding minorities and non-minor
ities, are happy. In the midst of com
plaints of racial tension in ethnic
theme houses. Okada has remained
relatively unscathed.
One freshman put it this way. "So
what if we're a little sheltered. We rt
learning about each other's cultures
and having a lot of fun doing it."
