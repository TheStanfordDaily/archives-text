# Many sign anti-Watt petition
## 
### Gale Warner 
The Sierra Club's month-old petition drive to oust In
terior Secretary James Watt from office is going "won
derfully," according to Gene Coan, assistant conservation
director for the club.
More than a half-million copies of the petition have been
distributed, and other major environmental organiza
tions, such as the Audubon Society and Friends of the
Earth, are reprinting the petition in their publications as
well.
So tar. more than 70,000 signatures have come in to the
Sierra Club's national office, and the rate is accelerating,
said Coan.
"We expect to peak at about 10,000 signatures per day."
he said. "We're well on our way to getting a million by the
end ot the summer."
Since the petition has no legal status, other than as an
expression ot public opinion under the First Amendment,
anyone who is a resident of the United States may sign
The petitions will be sorted and sent to individual con
gressmen sometime in the summer, according to Coan.
Although Congress has no official power to remove a
Cabinet official from office, barring impeachment for a
crime, proponents of the drive say that it is already having
several effects.
"It's keeping environmental issues alive in people's
minds, and making them talk about what Watt is doing,
said Coan. "We're harvesting the frustration that people
feel and giving them a chance to do something."
Though Watt has told reporters that the petition effort is
nothing more than "a membership drive." some attribute
his recent attempts to appear more moderate the result of

growing public outcry.
Mary Kyle McCurdy. conservation coordinator for the
Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club, characterized lo
cal reaction to the petition as "outstanding."
"We've had a tremendous response." she said. "Many
people who aren't that environmentally-oriented, and who
'don't ordinarily agree with the Sierra Club on everything,
are contacting us and saying that they want to sign it right
away."
Reaction at Stanford to the petition has been favorable
as well. "I think it's great," said senior Melanie Julian
"It's a great way to mobilize public opinion, and I hope
Congress pays attention. "
"A lot of people who voted for Reagan are unhappy with
Watt," said business student Joel Horn. "It will be in
teresting to see how many Reaganites, such as Reed, come
out against Watt."
Horn was referring to former Assistant Secretary of In
terior Nataniel Reed, a Republican who said in a May 2
speech in San Francisco to the Sierra Club that while he
"supported Ronald Reagan's election by word and by
deed." his former colleague Watt "is already a disaster as
secretary."
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich. in a May 6 letter to Reagan,
stated that "we Republicans are being embarrassed and
betrayed by the appointment of a radical as secretary of
interior. It is inevitable that many people otherwise sym
pathetic to many of your programs will soon be forced into
active opposition to your presidency unless Watt and his
ilk are removed from positions of power ."
On campus, John Anderson delighted the students of
David Brower's course on environmental policy by signing
the Watt petition in the middle of his guest lecture, amid
cheers and applause.
Anderson encouraged students to devote time and
energy to environmental organizations, saying that "I
don't see any reason why you can't stir up enough heat, and
along with that, sufficient light, to expose the kind of phi
losophy he represents and just how bad it is for the future
of our country."
"In all the letters and phone culls we've gotten so far
about the petition," said Sierra Club's national petition
drive coordinator David Hastings, "the only negative re
action has been that we don't have people with petitions
standing on every street corner."
