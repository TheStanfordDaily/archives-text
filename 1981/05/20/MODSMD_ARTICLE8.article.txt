## Venus aids studies on greenhouse effect 
### 
Using NASA's Pioneer-Venus
spacecraft data, a team of sci
entists has virtually proved that
the searing 482 degree Celsius
1 9<)0 degree Fahrenheit) surface
temperature of Venus is due to
an atmospheric greenhouse ef
fect. Until now the Venus green
house effect has been largely a
theory.
The work is important to un
derstanding possible adverse ef
fects on agriculture resulting
from society's long-term use of
fossil fuels.
"Greenhouse effect" means
that the surface temperature is
raised when energy in the form
of sunlight easily passes
through Venus' atmosphere to
the surface, but has difficulty
escaping when converted to
heat radiation, and is thus held
in by the atmosphere.
! The same principle provides
fnuch of the heat for nursery
greenhouses on Earth.
; Calculations, which used
Pioneer measurements of at
mosphere composition, tem
perature profiles and radiative
heating, predicted Venus's sur
face temperature "very pre
eisely," says Dr. James
Pollack, NASA's Ames Re
search Center. Pollack is head
of the Pioneer-Venus radiative
heating team. The calculations
predict not only Venus's surface
temperature, but agree with
temperatures measured at vari
ous altitudes above the surface
by the tour Pioneer Venus at
mosphere probe craft.
; The fact that Venus's at
mosphere heat balance can be
accurately calculated means
the atmosphere heating on
Earth caused by burning ot
fossil fuels also can be pre
dicted. The accuracy of the
Venus predictions increases
confidence in similar predic
tions for the Earth.
The main atmosphere ingre
dient holding in Venus's heat is
carbon dioxide. Eighty years of
burning fossil fuels on Earth has
increased atmospheric carbon
dioxide by 15 percent. Predic
tions of increased future burn
ing of fossil fuels like coal and
oil suggest that the carbon diox
ide in Earth's atmosphere could
be doubled in 50 years.
Researchers point out that re

suiting heat trapping by carbon
dioxide could raise average at
mosphere temperatures from
three to seven degrees Fahren
heit (seven degrees F). This is a
very minor effect compared to
the inferno of Venus's surface.
Nonetheless, such a tem
perature increase could well
cause "incredible havoc," says
Pollack.
This is because it takes only a
very small temperature change
to produce major climatic
changes.
During the most severe
phases of the Earth's ice ages,
tor example, the average tem
perature drop has been only 15
degrees F.
Having calculated at
mospheric heating tor Venus
(which is almost the most ex
treme case imaginable), calcu
lations of carbon dioxide effects
on Earth's atmospheric heat
budget should be much easier.
Then more definite predictions
about effects of CO(2) on the
Earth's climate can be made.
"These questions need look
ing into because the problems
are potentially so serious, and
mixed up with other human dif
ficulties like the energy short
age," Pollack adds.
Only half of the carbon diox
ide so far sent into the at
mosphere by human fossil-fuel
burning has stayed there. The
rest apparently has been ab
sorbed into the oceans. How
ever. ocean absorption effects
have been included in the scien
tists' calculations ot carbon
dioxide doubling.
Pollack says Venus's surface
temperature of 900 degrees F is
remarkable. The planet is only
30 percent closer to the Sun than
Earth, and with a relatively thin
atmosphere like Earth's, its
surface temperatures would be
around a warm but habitable 100
degrees F.
Earth's existing greenhouse
effect heats up our planet's sur
face some 55 degrees F. while
Venus's surface temperature is
wrenched upward by 800
degrees F due to the greenhouse
effect. This happens despite the
fact that Venus currently ab
sorbs less solar energy than the
Earth.

The Pioneer team has estab
lished the role and amount of
heat trapping by the various
gases and particles in Venus's
atmosphere. These include
carbon dioxide, water vapor,
sulfur dioxide, and various
types of cloud particles.
Carbon dioxide, which makes
up 96 percent of Venus's tre
mendously massive atmosphere
had by far the largest role in
trapping heat on Venus. Water

vapor and sulfur dioxide also
trapped important amounts of
heat, as did the clouds and
planet-enveloping haze layer.
The calculations included
amounts ot heat absorption for
carbon dioxide in long heat radi
ation wave lengths that this gas
does not normally absorb. How
ever, under Venus's enormous
atmospheric pressure, carbon
dioxide absorbs heat even at
very long wavelengths.
