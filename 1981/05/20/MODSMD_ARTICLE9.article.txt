# Nuke fears called exaggerated

Paranoia may be too strong a word to de
scribe the public reaction to nuclear power but
it may not be far off the mark, according to
Nobel Prize-winner Arno Penzias.
Penzias. who won the prize for his discovery
of evidence to support die big-bang theory of
the universe, spoke last Thursday at the invita
tion of Scientist and Engineers for Secure
Energy (SE2), a professional group which is
working "to correct much ot the misun
derstanding of fundamental scientific and
technological issues permeating the national
energy debate."
Penzias spoke first at a press conference,
which was ignored by the press, and later as
the keynote speaker at a forum, "Energy: The
Eighties and Beyond," held in an overflowing
Geology Corner auditorium.
"Many people get tremendously worked up
about nuclear energy," said Penzias. Why
aren't people equally concerned about nuclear
weapons, the number ot people who die on
highways each year, or the ones that die of pov
erty? "Did you know that the average black
has a life expectancy that is five years less
than a white?" he said.
Public fears center around the fear of con
tamination by radioactive materials and the
fear that the materials could be used by ter
rorists to build a bomb, according to Penzias.
Penzias said he thinks that disposal does not
present major problems. "Even if you were to
dispose ot it in the stupidest way, (to) just
dump the stuff into the ground in Montana and
cover it up, in a few hundred years it (the radi
ation levels) would not be any worse than in
Boulder. Colorado."
The fear of theft of nuclear material by ter
rorists is equally groundless, according to
Penzias. "To make a nuclear weapon is hard.
You not only have to study nuclear physics but
you have to be willing to give up your life. The
easier course to take is to take ROTC for five
years, become a major and then steal one.
There are thousands of warheads all over the

place."
There are several theories of why there has
been such a bad public reaction, Penzias said,
but added that he doesn't necessarily believe in
any of them.
"If you talk to Ralph Nader he says that
starting in 1974 on we stopped the nuclear
power business cold,"said Penzias.
"Well, what happened in 1973? There were
no nuclear accidents in 973, the thing that rea
ly put a dent in nuclear power was the quad
rupling in oil prices." This is the "conspiracy
of the Arabs theory," the theory that the seeds
of the energy shortage were sown by the Arabs
themselves.
"Another theory is that the anti-Vietnam
movement looked for another opponent â€” big,
vulnerable and hard to understand," Penzias
said.
"You sometimes hear in these rallies, 'I
haven't felt this good since the march on Wash
ington.' This was also a period when institu
tions were less than candid with the public.
Three Mile Island itself is an example ot lack
ot candor, said Penzias. "People simply do not
trust institutions."
Faced with the reality of public fear,
Penzias does not advocate a crash program in
nuclear power but simply turning on all the ex
isting nuclear reactors.
Penzias is a believer in conservation but
points out that it is expensive. He advocates us
ing the money that would be saved if nuclear
power plants such as Diablo Canyon would be
put back into operation to fund a state program
to replace wasteful refrigerators with fuel effi
cient ones, for example. Just replacing refrig
erators could save $8 in electricity for every
househ6ld each month, Penzias claims.
Penzias points out that if Diablo Canyon is
delayed or not put into operation,the cost will
go to consumers, a cost he says is estimated to
be around 15% higher energy bills.
Why is an astrophysicist interested in
energy? "I don't want to see the country go
down the drain," says Penzias.
