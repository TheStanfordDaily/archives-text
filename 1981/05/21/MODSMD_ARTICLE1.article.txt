# Reagan budget cuts hit social sciences
## 
### Louise Solomon 
The federal budget cuts which were
recently approved by Congress will in
elude drastic cuts in University re
search funding, particularly in the so
cial sciences. Many professors and ad
ministrators at universities around
the country are worried about the ef
fects of these cuts, and have begun
searching outside the government for
other sources of funding.
The budget cuts proposed by Presi
dent Ronald Reagan this March
drastically reduced the funds avail
able for basic social science research
and science education The research
cuts, which are only a minimal part of
the entire Reagan budget, were aimed
specifically at reseaich in economics,
sociology, pyschology, anthropology,
linguistics and other social sciences
The theoretcal research of these sub
jects has relied heavily in the past on
funding by the National Science Foun
dation (NSF).
The proposed cuts would complete
ly terminate some programs; in other
cases, the severity of the cuts coupled
with previous funding committments
would virtually prohibit any new re
search proposals tor the next two
years. NSF research support in eco
nomics and sociology has been re
duced from $33.6 million to $23.6 mil
lion for 1981-82, and the proposed cuts
for 1982-83 would reduce next year's
budget from $40 million to $10 million.
Support for research in psychology
and the neural sciences is to be cut 50
to 60 percent in 1982. while support for
the natural sciences is to be increased
from 7 to 20 percent in the same year.
It is the ostensibly discriminatory
and slanted nature of these cuts which
has particularly outraged social scien
tists. They object to the manner in
which the cuts were made, especially
to the lack of a scientific advisor on
the Office of Budget and Management
statf, and to the lack of flexibility giv
en to the NSF in determining where

"It's not just budget cutting, it's po
litical vengeance," said Sociology
Prot. Michael Hannan. "I think it's a
very astute politcal move, they're us

ing the divide and conquer strategy.
The physical scientists are so relieved
that they're not fighting it.
"Everybody who is left untouched
breathes a sigh of relief," Hannan
said. "But it could be them next
year."
Hannan said that the Reagan ad
minstration is claiming the cuts are
due to a lack of practical applications
for social science research.
"But that's not it,'' he said, "the
real story is that we're the bearers of
bad news Social scientists do re
search on poverty, income distribu
tion and a host of other problems.
They (the Reagan administration) are
cutting welfare drastically ; the fewer
social scientists there are finding out
the effects of such policies, the better
for the administration," he said.
"I think it's a real intellectual ven
detta." said Economics Prof.
Mordecai Kurz. "They don t want to
know how behavior is influenced. It's
an ostrich type view."
' It would have been understandable
to cut 75 percent of all science re
search, but when you go after a specif
ic group, I don't see the difference be
tween that and book-burning," Kurz
said.
"The greatest paradox of all is that
a great amount of Reagan's contem
porary economic thinking comes from
research funded by NSF â€” the same
foundation they now want to liqui
date," said Kurz. "It shows how little
they know what they're doing."
"The social scientist occupies a
position between the social critic and
the scientist,"said Prof. Gordon
Bower, who chairs the psychology de
partment. "Because they say things
relevant to society, you can always
find a politician who will disagree, and
this may have been a cause of the
backlash." he said.
The question now being asked is
what can be done to restore as much of
the original budget as possible. Before
any decisions regarding funding al
locations are finalized, proposals for
maintaining much of the original fund
ing must be considered by several dif
