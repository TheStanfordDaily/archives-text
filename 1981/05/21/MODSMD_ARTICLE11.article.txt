# Amicitia club sponsors a 'space week' of events
## 
### Marc Gimbrere 
The NASA Spacemobile and an exhibit dis
playing recent advances in space and science
technology will be presented by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration in
CERAS, room 12, at 3 p.m today.
William Horvath, a protessional NASA
educator, will also be speaking in a general
meeting which will be open to the public.
The program is one of a series of ongoing
presentations during the "Space for the
Future" week, which is sponsored by the
Amicitia International Institute, a non-profit
organization based in San Jose which ad
vocates an increased utilization of outer
space.
In the first of the "Space Week" events on
Monday, Jack Glazer was the speaker for a dis
cussion of space law. In the two hour dis
| cussion, Glazer spoke on the future of govern
ment regulation in the space industry, and the
ideologies behind breaking down potential gov
ernment controls and minimizing limitations.
Glazer, a former maritime representative to
the United Nations and leading authority on
maritime law, said he telt that exisiting in
ternational statutes could be projected and
utilized with some degree of proficiency in
space.
On Tuesday night, "Space Week" organizers
sponsored a series of movies. The first, ap
propriately entitled The Space Movie was an
hour long collage of NASA films of the 961-69
Apollo program formed into a documentary on
the race to the moon. Another composition of
just-released films of the space shuttle
launching was shown. The most popular clip in
cluded a soundtrack of shuttle astronauts Crip
pen and Young explaining the processes and
their thoughts as the shuttle was launched,
circled the earth, and landed.
"Definitely a worthwhile series," Frank
Thompson, a sophomore who attended the
screening, commented. "Anyone who, after
seeing these films, doesn't realize the connec
tion between nature and technology in the
space program has got a lot to learn."
The Amicitia International Institute
(Amicitia means friendship in Latin) hopes to
' educate the general public about the possi
i blities and future of space colonization.
I Nancy Kobryn, president of the institute,

said she was originally a schoolteacher when J
she realized that "there is so much to be done I
with the untapped potential of the human I
mind." She said she left teaching in an effort to 1
spread her ideology that human potential is \
limitless, that learning begins at birth and ,
ends at death, "and is not limited by the con- i
straints of formal education." I
This educational philosophy, called " an- I
drogene." is being tested in East Coast schools 1
with positive results, according to Kobryn.
However. Kobryn said she felt that this was not
enough, and hit upon the idea that this philoso
phy must be put into use in an area of education
which she sees as having great potential — out
er-space.
Kobryn then formed Amicitia in an effort to
put together a ten year study entitled The Sci
ence and Art of Living in Space, which will, on
the international level, research the technolog
ical, economical, sociological, and psy
chological effects upon the world to which
movement into outer space will lead.
Several authorities with established creden- i
tials in a variety of disciplines have been in- I
vited to direct specific studies, and many have I
accepted. Some of the principle professionals I
that have been invited are: \
— Dr. Stanley Krippner, author of Human
I'nssihilitii's and Dean of Faculty at the Hu
manistic Psychology Institute in San Francis
co.
— John Billingham, editor of Space Re
sources and Space Settlements, and an in
ternational authority on the search tor ex
traterrestrial intelligence.
— Dr. Peter Glaser. who has worked on the
development of the solar power satellite.
— Dr. Peter Vajk, author of Doomsday Has "
Heen Cancelled and senior scientist at Science
Applications in Pleasanton.
— Michael Prezkop. a visual designer, and
authority on graphics and exhibits at Ames re
search center at Moffet field. '
— Dr. Francis Cartier, Director of Eval
uation at the Defense Language Institute in
Monterey.
"Space for the future week" is the first of |
what the Stanford Amicitia chapter hopes will
be an annual event. For those interested in

pen and Young explaining the processes and
their thoughts as the shuttle was launched,
circled the earth, and landed.
"Definitely a worthwhile series," Frank
Thompson, a sophomore who attended the
screening, commented. "Anyone who, after
seeing these films, doesn't realize the connec
tion between nature and technology in the
space program has got a lot to learn."
The Amicitia International Institute
(Amicitia means friendship in Latin) hopes to
' educate the general public about the possi
i blities and future of space colonization.
I Nancy Kobryn, president of the institute,

said she was originally a schoolteacher when J
she realized that "there is so much to be done I
with the untapped potential of the human I
mind." She said she left teaching in an effort to 1
spread her ideology that human potential is \
limitless, that learning begins at birth and ,
ends at death, "and is not limited by the con- i
straints of formal education." I
This educational philosophy, called " an- I
drogene." is being tested in East Coast schools 1
with positive results, according to Kobryn.
However. Kobryn said she felt that this was not
enough, and hit upon the idea that this philoso
phy must be put into use in an area of education
which she sees as having great potential — out
er-space.
Kobryn then formed Amicitia in an effort to
put together a ten year study entitled The Sci
ence and Art of Living in Space, which will, on
the international level, research the technolog
ical, economical, sociological, and psy
chological effects upon the world to which
movement into outer space will lead.

"Space for the future week" is the first of |
what the Stanford Amicitia chapter hopes will
be an annual event. For those interested in
more information, call Michael Phelps
(854-0750) or Curtis Horton (326-3605).
The NASA Spacemobile and an exhibit dis
playing recent advances in space and science
technology will be presented by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration in
CERAS, room 12, at 3 p.m today.
William Horvath, a protessional NASA
educator, will also be speaking in a general
meeting which will be open to the public.
The program is one of a series of ongoing
presentations during the "Space for the
Future" week, which is sponsored by the
Amicitia International Institute, a non-profit
organization based in San Jose which ad
vocates an increased utilization of outer
space.
In the first of the "Space Week" events on
Monday, Jack Glazer was the speaker for a dis
cussion of space law. In the two hour dis
| cussion, Glazer spoke on the future of govern
ment regulation in the space industry, and the
ideologies behind breaking down potential gov
ernment controls and minimizing limitations.
Glazer, a former maritime representative to
the United Nations and leading authority on
maritime law, said he telt that exisiting in
ternational statutes could be projected and
utilized with some degree of proficiency in
space.
On Tuesday night, "Space Week" organizers
sponsored a series of movies. The first, ap
propriately entitled The Space Movie was an
hour long collage of NASA films of the 961-69
Apollo program formed into a documentary on
the race to the moon. Another composition of
just-released films of the space shuttle
launching was shown. The most popular clip in
cluded a soundtrack of shuttle astronauts Crip
pen and Young explaining the processes and
their thoughts as the shuttle was launched,
circled the earth, and landed.
"Definitely a worthwhile series," Frank
Thompson, a sophomore who attended the
screening, commented. "Anyone who, after

tion between nature and technology in the
