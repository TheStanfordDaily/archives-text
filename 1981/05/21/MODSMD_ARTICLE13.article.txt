## Feminists view men as arch villains 
### 
Since this year is almost over. I think I
can safely write this Column and still be able
to beat a timely retreat. Several other col
umnists have ventured to write on this sub
ject, some seriously, some in a light
hearted vein, and have been summarily
jumped on with both feet (in the editorial
sense) by angry letter-writers. So I will don
a false nose and mustache, furtively glance
around to ensure isolation, take a deep
breath, and say: There are many things I do
not like about the feminist movement.
It has nothing to do with any personal
animosity toward women. Some of my best
friends are women. I don't mind living in the
same neighborhood, drinking from the
same water fountain, or sitting next to
women in a bus.
But as a man, I have been labelled an
arch-villian in the massive historical con
spiracy to deprive women of their human
ity, their sense of self-worth, and their
rightful status as an equal half of the human
race. I have been told that the "ivory tow
er" is a product of "phallic thinking." Last
week. Emily Culpepper, a key activist in the
drive for feminist studies at Harvard, (to
whom is attributed that last-mentioned gem
of idiocy) even refused to allow men to
speak during the initial phase of the ques
tion-and-answer period following her ad
dress, maintaining that it was time men
"sat and listened for a change."
That was a grossly discourteous and vir
ulently self-righteous gesture; it also ir
ritates the hell out of me. If a male speaker
had pulled a similar puerile stunt, he would
have been stuffed in the podium and thrown

in the lake (justifiably). But men were sup
posed to sit with bowed heads in silentexpia
tion of their sins, humbly accepting crimi
nal culpability for any and all past actions of
their sex, and wallowing in self-depreca
tion. I'm sorry — I will enthusiastically sup
port any reasonable effort to remedy past
injustice to women, but I am not goin&to be
a whipping-boy for the whole mare sex
(njeager pun intended).
Last fall there was an ongoing debate
about rape in the Daily. There was. of
course, no disagreement about the abhor
rent nature of the crime; but some writers
saw offers made by male students to protect
female students as patronizing. That is ri
diculous — in general men are stronger and
quicker than women and therefore more
able to defend against assault. That does not
mean that women should not learn self-de
tense: but labeling that offer of an escort as
patronizing is going a bit too far on the nasty
side.
I also take issue with the claim that all
emotional and mental differences between
men and women are inculcated by society.
This is true to a large extent, but I suspect
that we are more creatures of our biological
heritage than we care to admit.
Undeniably, there are physical dif
ferences between men and women (with
some pleasant consequences). Undeniably,
women are physically structured to bear
and to nurture children. Whether they
choose to do that is an entirely different
matter, but it is a fact that their biological
role in procreation is clearly defined. This
does not mean that little girls must wear

pink as opposed to blue, or learn to sew in
stead of weld, yet it seems to contradict
feminist claims that the post-natal societal
environment is wholly responsible for the
implantation of all non-physiological dif
ferences in the two sexes.
There are no definite conclusions on this
topic as of yet, but feminists seem to bridle
at the mere suggestion that women and men
have inherent emotional and mental dif
ferences. Neither scientists nor I know if
that's Jtriie but it is not an insult to women to
suggest it. This seems to be the one case in
which the "separate but equal" doctrine
seems applicable. I hope the new "feminist
studies" major will provide a sorely needed
objective approach to a consideration of
these topics.
It is time I take cover from the expected
barrage of epithets such as "male
chauvinist pig" (that one is losing its
punch), "doltish D.H. Lawrencian
mugwump" (always one of my favorites),
and "damn Yankee" (that seems to tit any
situation).
Call me what you will — as I have said, I
like women. I am just as willing to send my
girlfriend a set of barbells as I am to send
some roses. (Fortunately for my shaky fi
nances, she prefers the flowers.) Since I
have committed the cardinal sin of criticis
ing the feminist movement at Stanford,
though, I am forever doomed to a fugitive
existence, at least until spring quarter is
over.

Undeniably, there are physical dif
ferences between men and women (with
some pleasant consequences). Undeniably,
women are physically structured to bear
and to nurture children. Whether they
choose to do that is an entirely different
matter, but it is a fact that their biological
role in procreation is clearly defined. This
does not mean that little girls must wear

pink as opposed to blue, or learn to sew in
stead of weld, yet it seems to contradict
feminist claims that the post-natal societal
environment is wholly responsible for the
implantation of all non-physiological dif
ferences in the two sexes.
There are no definite conclusions on this
topic as of yet, but feminists seem to bridle
at the mere suggestion that women and men
have inherent emotional and mental dif
ferences. Neither scientists nor I know if
that's Jtriie but it is not an insult to women to
suggest it. This seems to be the one case in
which the "separate but equal" doctrine
seems applicable. I hope the new "feminist
studies" major will provide a sorely needed
objective approach to a consideration of
these topics.
It is time I take cover from the expected
barrage of epithets such as "male
chauvinist pig" (that one is losing its
punch), "doltish D.H. Lawrencian
mugwump" (always one of my favorites),
and "damn Yankee" (that seems to tit any
situation).
Call me what you will — as I have said, I
like women. I am just as willing to send my
girlfriend a set of barbells as I am to send
some roses. (Fortunately for my shaky fi
nances, she prefers the flowers.) Since I
have committed the cardinal sin of criticis
ing the feminist movement at Stanford,
though, I am forever doomed to a fugitive
existence, at least until spring quarter is
over.

Since this year is almost over. I think I
can safely write this Column and still be able
to beat a timely retreat. Several other col
umnists have ventured to write on this sub
ject, some seriously, some in a light
hearted vein, and have been summarily
jumped on with both feet (in the editorial
sense) by angry letter-writers. So I will don
a false nose and mustache, furtively glance
around to ensure isolation, take a deep
breath, and say: There are many things I do
not like about the feminist movement.
It has nothing to do with any personal
animosity toward women. Some of my best
friends are women. I don't mind living in the
same neighborhood, drinking from the
same water fountain, or sitting next to
women in a bus.
But as a man, I have been labelled an
arch-villian in the massive historical con
spiracy to deprive women of their human
ity, their sense of self-worth, and their
rightful status as an equal half of the human
race. I have been told that the "ivory tow
er" is a product of "phallic thinking." Last
week. Emily Culpepper, a key activist in the
drive for feminist studies at Harvard, (to
whom is attributed that last-mentioned gem
of idiocy) even refused to allow men to
speak during the initial phase of the ques
tion-and-answer period following her ad
dress, maintaining that it was time men
"sat and listened for a change."
That was a grossly discourteous and vir
ulently self-righteous gesture; it also ir
ritates the hell out of me. If a male speaker
had pulled a similar puerile stunt, he would
have been stuffed in the podium and thrown

in the lake (justifiably). But men were sup
posed to sit with bowed heads in silentexpia
tion of their sins, humbly accepting crimi
nal culpability for any and all past actions of
their sex, and wallowing in self-depreca
tion. I'm sorry — I will enthusiastically sup
port any reasonable effort to remedy past
injustice to women, but I am not goin&to be
a whipping-boy for the whole mare sex
(njeager pun intended).
Last fall there was an ongoing debate
about rape in the Daily. There was. of
course, no disagreement about the abhor
rent nature of the crime; but some writers
saw offers made by male students to protect
female students as patronizing. That is ri
diculous — in general men are stronger and
quicker than women and therefore more
able to defend against assault. That does not
mean that women should not learn self-de
tense: but labeling that offer of an escort as
patronizing is going a bit too far on the nasty
side.
I also take issue with the claim that all
emotional and mental differences between
men and women are inculcated by society.
This is true to a large extent, but I suspect
that we are more creatures of our biological
heritage than we care to admit.
