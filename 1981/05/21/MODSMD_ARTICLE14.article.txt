"Troublemakers Congregate
at Lake" (Daily, May tl) con
tains some very disturbing im
plications. It may well be that
problems have arisen at Lake
Lagunita due to the presence ot
non-Stanford students and that
Stanford students have a right
to enjoy a private beach on Uni
versity property. I question,
however, whether the problems
ot noise, litter, and general dis
ruption of our students' tran
quility are as serious as the
problems reflected in manager
Everhart's attitude toward "the
Paly High students and the 24-25
year-old low-lifes in the area."
Is our campus so isolated
from the real world that we
must feel threatened and
"hassled" by the presence of
people who travel in four-wheel
drive trucks, party with loud
music, and don't bring books to
the beach? Should we really be
proud of the fact that Everhart
doesn't even "have to ask for
I.D.'s to tell the Stanford stu
dents apart from the vulgar
masses?" I tor one appreciate
the all-too-rare opportunities
afforded in the Palo Alto and
Stanford area to encounter peo
ple with values and behavior dif
ferent from my own.
Whether the management ot
the Lake Lagunita facility
wishes to restrict access to the
beach or not is not the point — it
seems to have a perfectly legal
right to do so, and the limited
statt and space available may
justify such a policy. However, I
find it insulting that the justifi
cations offered for such a meas
ure tend to stereotype me, a
Stanford student, as a sheltered,
helpless child who cannot stand
exposure to residents of the
world beyond our campus.

More on IRA
Larry Sheehan forgot to men
tion the following fact in his col
umn (Daily, May 2):
— Bobby Sands was part ot a
terrorist organization that is fi
nanced by Libya and the takings
of violent bank-robberies in the
Republic of Ireland. The IRA's

principle victims have been
women and children. The IRA is
a cowardly organization which
has killed more civilians than
soldiers.
— Bobby Sands died volun
tarily, a privilege which the IRA
has consistently denied its own
victims.
— IRA thugs are indeed not to
be classified with "shoplifters
and car thiefs." They are to be
branded as the sadistic,
homocidal maniacs as they are.
— A favorite method of IRA
interrogation is called "knee
capping." Belfast now has the
best surgeons in the world for
repairing knees that have been
shattered by .45 bullets or Black
and Decker drill bits.
— The British did not choose
to have Northern Ireland. The
residents of that area, for better
or worse, voted shortly after
World War I to remain a British
dominion.
— The Republic of Ireland
wants Northern Ireland even
less than the British do. They do
not want to inherit an economi
cally depressed area terrorized
by a group of thugs whose ul
timate goal is to form a one-par
ty Marxist state throughout Ire
land.
Doubtless, Sheehan believes
the good, old-fashioned Anglo-
Saxon traditions of tolerance
and open debate will be allowed
to flourish even more when that
happens than they do now on
that tragic island.

Dismay. There is no other
way to describe my reaction
upon reading, in the Peninsula
Times Tribune, but not in the
Daily, that henceforth that most
revered of Stanford institutions,
the LSJUMB, would in the
future be subjected to super
vision/regulation/censorship.
The Band's creativity, ir
reverence, and individualism
are hallmarks of the Farm.
They are characteristics I
would gladly be guilty of by as
sociation. They are character
istics which cannot survive su
pervision. The Band succeeds
because it fails.

The Band is at its best when it
takes a sensitive topic and strips
it of its pretentions. The Band
cannot exhibit its vaunted skills
at this if sensitive issues are out
of bounds. The Band is humor
ous because it dares to offend. It
is weak when it does not in
cisively attack a sensitive area,
such as in last year's Big Game.
However, I will gladly suffer
through week upon week of slow
shows for that one glimpse of
greatness — for example, the
USC show last year. (In the
future will the scholastic
achievements of the opponents
be oft limits for such an impor
tant shaper of American morali
ty as Stanford?) The Band
might as well forget "All Right
Now" and learn "God Bless
America."
This concern for the whole
some image of Stanford is not
limited to putting a muzzle on
the Band. In a recent "debate"
on the mascot issue the Daily's
sports editors turned in an in
credibly lackadaisical per
formance alternately support
ing the Indian and the Griffin.
Much was said about the physi
cal and spiritual aspects of
these symbols. Nothing was
mentioned about what the
choice ot either mascot would
say about Stanford. In a con
ference littered with mascots as
diverse as a major manufac
turer of condoms (USC), not so
vague sexual innuendos (Wash
ington and Oregon State), a pro
fessional golfer (Cal), and a
bath tub play toy (Oregon),
Stanford is going to have to do
better than the meager pro
posals put torth by the Daily
sports editors. The uniqueness,
animation, and imaginitiveness
of Stanford is more closely cap
tured by such nominees as the
Trees/Sequoias/ and the Trains.
Stanford ought to put its
mouth where its money is and
adopt the "Robber Baron" as its
official mascot. Alternatively, a
rotating mascot (with four
mascots alternating every year
and identified with the individ
ual graduating class) might be
innovative enough. But to
elevate the Indian, the Gritfin
or the Cardinal (the color not
the bird or the prelate) to the

status of mascot just as to con
demn (to conformity) those
Merrie Masters of Madcap
Melody, the One and Only, the
Truly Incomparable, Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band is a sentence of

"Troublemakers Congregate

tains some very disturbing im
plications. It may well be that
problems have arisen at Lake
Lagunita due to the presence ot
non-Stanford students and that
Stanford students have a right
to enjoy a private beach on Uni

however, whether the problems

problems reflected in manager
Everhart's attitude toward "the
Paly High students and the 24-25

Is our campus so isolated
from the real world that we
must feel threatened and
"hassled" by the presence of
people who travel in four-wheel
drive trucks, party with loud

proud of the fact that Everhart
doesn't even "have to ask for

Whether the management ot
the Lake Lagunita facility
wishes to restrict access to the

seems to have a perfectly legal
right to do so, and the limited
statt and space available may
justify such a policy. However, I
find it insulting that the justifi

More on IRA
Larry Sheehan forgot to men
tion the following fact in his col
umn (Daily, May 2):
— Bobby Sands was part ot a
terrorist organization that is fi
nanced by Libya and the takings
of violent bank-robberies in the
Republic of Ireland. The IRA's

principle victims have been
women and children. The IRA is
a cowardly organization which
has killed more civilians than
soldiers.
— Bobby Sands died volun
tarily, a privilege which the IRA
has consistently denied its own
victims.
— IRA thugs are indeed not to
be classified with "shoplifters
and car thiefs." They are to be
branded as the sadistic,
homocidal maniacs as they are.
— A favorite method of IRA
interrogation is called "knee
capping." Belfast now has the
best surgeons in the world for
repairing knees that have been
shattered by .45 bullets or Black
and Decker drill bits.
— The British did not choose
to have Northern Ireland. The
residents of that area, for better
or worse, voted shortly after
World War I to remain a British
dominion.
— The Republic of Ireland
wants Northern Ireland even
less than the British do. They do
not want to inherit an economi
cally depressed area terrorized
by a group of thugs whose ul
timate goal is to form a one-par
ty Marxist state throughout Ire
land.
Doubtless, Sheehan believes
the good, old-fashioned Anglo-
Saxon traditions of tolerance
and open debate will be allowed
to flourish even more when that
happens than they do now on
that tragic island.

Dismay. There is no other
way to describe my reaction
upon reading, in the Peninsula
Times Tribune, but not in the
Daily, that henceforth that most
revered of Stanford institutions,
the LSJUMB, would in the
future be subjected to super
vision/regulation/censorship.
The Band's creativity, ir
reverence, and individualism
are hallmarks of the Farm.
They are characteristics I
would gladly be guilty of by as
sociation. They are character
istics which cannot survive su
pervision. The Band succeeds
because it fails.

The Band is at its best when it
takes a sensitive topic and strips
it of its pretentions. The Band
cannot exhibit its vaunted skills
at this if sensitive issues are out
of bounds. The Band is humor
ous because it dares to offend. It
is weak when it does not in
cisively attack a sensitive area,
such as in last year's Big Game.
However, I will gladly suffer
through week upon week of slow
shows for that one glimpse of
greatness — for example, the
USC show last year. (In the
future will the scholastic
achievements of the opponents
be oft limits for such an impor
tant shaper of American morali
ty as Stanford?) The Band
might as well forget "All Right
Now" and learn "God Bless
America."
This concern for the whole
some image of Stanford is not
limited to putting a muzzle on
the Band. In a recent "debate"
on the mascot issue the Daily's
sports editors turned in an in
credibly lackadaisical per
formance alternately support
ing the Indian and the Griffin.
Much was said about the physi
cal and spiritual aspects of
these symbols. Nothing was
mentioned about what the
choice ot either mascot would
say about Stanford. In a con
ference littered with mascots as
diverse as a major manufac
turer of condoms (USC), not so
vague sexual innuendos (Wash
ington and Oregon State), a pro
fessional golfer (Cal), and a
bath tub play toy (Oregon),
Stanford is going to have to do
better than the meager pro
posals put torth by the Daily
sports editors. The uniqueness,
animation, and imaginitiveness
of Stanford is more closely cap
tured by such nominees as the
Trees/Sequoias/ and the Trains.
Stanford ought to put its
mouth where its money is and
adopt the "Robber Baron" as its
official mascot. Alternatively, a

mascots alternating every year

ual graduating class) might be
