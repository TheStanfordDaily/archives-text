# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Harold Montgomery US involvement justified 
### 
Much has been said regarding possible U.S. in
volvement in El Salvador. Most critics have
scorned U.S. "imperialism" and called for a
"popular" government, allowing the Salvadoran
people to choose their own system free from out
side intervention. While I agree with the basic
thrust of such a policy, it seems shortsighted when
subjected to a thorough analysis. The U.S. has le
gitimate concerns in El Salvador and surrounding
countries, which obviate a "hands-off" policy.
Further, if the U.S. chooses to remain on the side
lines, it had better be prepared tor the conse
quences, which may be worse than it it had in
tervened.
Critics often overlook sizeable U.S. investment
and trade with El Salvador. In 1978 trade ap
proached $750 million, and El Salvador provides
an important source of raw materials. Given the
chronic U.S. balance of trade deficit, critics
should be slower to throw away a valuable trading
partner to a potentially unfriendly regime.
Further, El Salvador's position complicates
matters. Sandwiched between Guatemala and
Honduras, El Salvador commands a lengthy
coastline, essential to vital U.S. security interests
such as the defense ot neighboring states and ot
the Panama Canal. For an unfriendly power to
control that coastline could mean a disruption ot
trade in the area. From air and sea bases in the
area, a power could control the major shipping
lanes and fishing grounds. Its proximity to Mexi
co, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and Nicaragua
all of which are U.S. allies and trading partners,
means that the U.S. has more than a passing in
terest in Salvadoran stability.
Conceivably, El Salvador could become a stag
ing base for unfriendly assaults on neighboring
states. The jungles of Central America have
proven themselves as the perfect place tor
guerilla activity. So far such activity has proved
highly successful, as in Cuba. The U.S. would be
better off dealing with a guerilla movement early
than allowing it to grow and spread through in
action.
Most importantly, the U.S. must consider its
broader foreign policy objectives and their rela
tion to the specific case. It is not enough to make
random and incongruous decisions on individual
problems. Rather, it is necessary to maintain a
continuity in foreign policy. For reasons of

credibility, the U.S. must maintain an image of
reliability and consistency of action. As the re
sults of Jimmy Carter's foreign policy showed,
equivocation and vacillation lead allies to doubt
U.S. strength and reliability.
If the U.S. does not stand firm for its interests
and those of its allies in El Salvador, its Central
and South American allies may seek more re
liable allies elsewhere.
Because of historical imperatives, the U.S.
should consider a firm stand. The Monroe and
Truman doctrinejvcompel the U.S. to counter out
side influence in Latin America. The U.S. must
face up to its previous commitments or face the
consequences of renouncing them through inac
tion.
All this does not mean that El Salvador must re
press change and follow the U.S. as a satellite.
The current regime is in favor of a substantive
program of social and land reforms currently un
der way. Such changes might not exist under a dif
ferent government, rightist or leftist.
Finally, U.S. policy has suffered from what has
been labeled "the post-Vietnam Syndrome" — the
inability to act effectively, rising from the ex
periences in Southeast Asia. But the "Vietnam
Syndrome" has cost the U.S. heavily from the
Vietnam peace negotiations, down to the Iranian
hostage negotiations. How many more "boat peo
ple" will have to die on the South China Sea before
the American public realizes its role as the only
capable democratic actor in the global sense?
The U.S. may not be the savior of mankind, but
the opposition is certainly no better. Given the So
viet performance in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and a dozen other prox
ies around the world, the U.S. should be welcomed
with open arms.
Yet, the issue is not whether the Soviet Union or
Cuba is at the bottom of the trouble in El Salvador.
The point is rather that the U.S. now faces a seri
ous test of its ability to throw oft the stalemate of
the "Vietnam syndrome" and to conduct foreign
policy effectively. Given the response to Reagan's
first months in office, it seems likely that the pub
lic will allow the President to make a start.

"popular" government, allowing the Salvadoran
people to choose their own system free from out
side intervention. While I agree with the basic
thrust of such a policy, it seems shortsighted when
subjected to a thorough analysis. The U.S. has le
gitimate concerns in El Salvador and surrounding
countries, which obviate a "hands-off" policy.
Further, if the U.S. chooses to remain on the side
lines, it had better be prepared tor the conse
quences, which may be worse than it it had in
tervened.
Critics often overlook sizeable U.S. investment
and trade with El Salvador. In 1978 trade ap
proached $750 million, and El Salvador provides
an important source of raw materials. Given the
chronic U.S. balance of trade deficit, critics
should be slower to throw away a valuable trading
partner to a potentially unfriendly regime.
Further, El Salvador's position complicates
matters. Sandwiched between Guatemala and
Honduras, El Salvador commands a lengthy
coastline, essential to vital U.S. security interests
such as the defense ot neighboring states and ot
the Panama Canal. For an unfriendly power to
control that coastline could mean a disruption ot
trade in the area. From air and sea bases in the
area, a power could control the major shipping
lanes and fishing grounds. Its proximity to Mexi
co, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and Nicaragua
all of which are U.S. allies and trading partners,
means that the U.S. has more than a passing in
terest in Salvadoran stability.
Conceivably, El Salvador could become a stag
ing base for unfriendly assaults on neighboring
states. The jungles of Central America have
proven themselves as the perfect place tor
guerilla activity. So far such activity has proved
highly successful, as in Cuba. The U.S. would be
better off dealing with a guerilla movement early
than allowing it to grow and spread through in
action.
Most importantly, the U.S. must consider its
broader foreign policy objectives and their rela
tion to the specific case. It is not enough to make
random and incongruous decisions on individual
problems. Rather, it is necessary to maintain a
continuity in foreign policy. For reasons of

credibility, the U.S. must maintain an image of
reliability and consistency of action. As the re
sults of Jimmy Carter's foreign policy showed,
equivocation and vacillation lead allies to doubt
U.S. strength and reliability.
If the U.S. does not stand firm for its interests
and those of its allies in El Salvador, its Central
and South American allies may seek more re
liable allies elsewhere.
Because of historical imperatives, the U.S.
should consider a firm stand. The Monroe and
Truman doctrinejvcompel the U.S. to counter out
side influence in Latin America. The U.S. must
face up to its previous commitments or face the
consequences of renouncing them through inac
tion.
All this does not mean that El Salvador must re
press change and follow the U.S. as a satellite.
The current regime is in favor of a substantive
program of social and land reforms currently un
der way. Such changes might not exist under a dif
ferent government, rightist or leftist.
Finally, U.S. policy has suffered from what has
been labeled "the post-Vietnam Syndrome" — the
inability to act effectively, rising from the ex
periences in Southeast Asia. But the "Vietnam
Syndrome" has cost the U.S. heavily from the
Vietnam peace negotiations, down to the Iranian
hostage negotiations. How many more "boat peo
ple" will have to die on the South China Sea before
the American public realizes its role as the only
capable democratic actor in the global sense?
The U.S. may not be the savior of mankind, but
the opposition is certainly no better. Given the So
viet performance in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and a dozen other prox
ies around the world, the U.S. should be welcomed
with open arms.
Yet, the issue is not whether the Soviet Union or
Cuba is at the bottom of the trouble in El Salvador.
The point is rather that the U.S. now faces a seri
ous test of its ability to throw oft the stalemate of
the "Vietnam syndrome" and to conduct foreign
policy effectively. Given the response to Reagan's
first months in office, it seems likely that the pub
lic will allow the President to make a start.

Much has been said regarding possible U.S. in
volvement in El Salvador. Most critics have
scorned U.S. "imperialism" and called for a
"popular" government, allowing the Salvadoran
people to choose their own system free from out
side intervention. While I agree with the basic
