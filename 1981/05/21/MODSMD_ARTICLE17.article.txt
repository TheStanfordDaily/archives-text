## AWACS not forced on Arabs 
### 
It is most ironic that, after
claiming that the caricature of
the Saudi Arabians as "Jew
Hunters" was "completely
wrong from a factual point of
view," Noor-ud-Deen Mahmoon
Zanki, in his article, "Arabs
don't want our AWACS" (Daily,
May 13) proceeds to cite myths
and "factual" inaccuracies in
support of his argument.
Even his title is designed to
give the illusion that the AWACS
are being forced upon the Saudi
Arabians, a fallacy that must be
disputed. If Saudi Arabia does
not want the AWACS, then why
have they put such intense pres
sure, including the threat of an
oil boycott, on the United
States? Who is Zanki represent
ing when he writes, "We do not
want your AWACS,"? If his
"we" is the Saudi Arabian gov
ernment, then does he mind it I
send a copy of his letter to the
United States Congress?
I do agree with Zanki on one
point: Saudi Arabia does not
need the AWACS for its defense.
It does need the planes, how
ever, to assist other Arab coun
tries in their battle against Is

rael. It is no secret that, with the
use of the AWACS, Saudi Arabia
will have access to all Israeli
military activity on land and in
the air. Who should be worried
about defense?
If the Saudi Arabian attitude
toward Israel is so peaceful,
why did it do everything in its
power to deny the peace process
between Egypt and Israel?
Saudi Arabia has preferred to
hire other people to fight its
wars against Israel. Along with
Libya, Saudi Arabia is the chief
financial support of the PLO.
Zanki has adopted a classical
anti-Semitic argument: he is de
ciding who is Jewish and who is
not. "Israel and Jews are two
separate entities . . . Israel is a
settler state established at the
expense of the Palestenian peo
ple: Jews are followers of a re
spected religion."
On what grounds does he sup
port this distinction? Judaism is
a religion, a heritage, an ethnic
group, and a nation. A religion
may not have a right to its own
land, but a people with a com
mon language, common
heritage, does. Israel is the
homeland of the Jews; the two
cannot be separated.
The evidence supporting his
claim that Israelis should be
called "Arab Hunters," is at
best irresponsible and at worst
flagrantly deceptive. The
Palestine Arab refugees today
would be living in an independ
ent Arab state if the Arabs had
not refused to accept the 1947
UN resolution. Arab leaders
stimulated the Arab departure
in 1947 because they wanted to
arouse the Arab world into a
Holy War against the Jews
While Arab armies were mov
ing into the newly established

Israel, Arab civilians were mov
ing out. The London Economist,
on October 2, 1948, carried a
British eyewitness account:
"During subsequent days the
Jewish authorities, who were
now in complete control of
Haifa, (save for limited dis
tricts still held by the British
troops), urged all Arabs to re
main in Haifa and guaranteed
them protection and security.
As far as I know, most of the
British civilian residents whose
advice was asked by Arab
friends told the latter that they
would be wise to stay. However,
of the 62,00) Arabs who for
merly lived in Haifa, not more
than 5000 or 6500 remained."
The Arab exodus was voluntary.
The Israeli government did not,
and has never, forced its Arab
population to leave the country.
Just last year alone, more than
1,000,000 visitors from Arab
countries came to Israel to see
members of their families.
Many other "facts" in
Zanki's article are not sup
portable. For example, the is
lands in the Gulf of Agabah, that
he claims Israel occupies, never
belonged to Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, Israel doesn't oc
cupy them. His comment on Zi
onism manipulating the Ameri
can mass media is incorrect.
Unfortunately, Zanki mis
used, to his advantage, an issue
that is of grave political concern
today: the selling of the AWACS
to Saudi Arabia. By starting
with an objection to what he
called a racist and thoughtless
caricature, Zanki was able to
cajole his reader into reading an
article that was itself "racist"
and "defaming."
