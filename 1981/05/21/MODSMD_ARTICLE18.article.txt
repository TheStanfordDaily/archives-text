## Gang of Four helps put the guts back into New Wave 
### Tony Kelly 
Once upon a time, rock music
had guts. Ever since Rock
Around the Clock changed the
times of musicians everywhere,
power has been the key to emo
tion in rock and roll. Wimpy
troubadors who sound real pret
ty may be entertaining at times,
but as tar as advances in
modern music is concerned,
people take notice of sounds that
grab them by the throat, throw
them off their back, on their
feet*out the door, and into a tel
ephone pole. Unfortunately, the
former style has been the trend,
leading most folks to write off
the 1970s in terms of creativity.
The explosion of new wave in
976-77 helped things greatly,
with the Sex Pistols (and hun
dreds of spitting images of
them) reintroducing anger and
rebellion into music. But now.
most of new wave is as tame in
its dissatisfaction as the rest of
popular music, becoming "the
same old thing in brand new
drag" (David Bowie). One step
forward, two steps back.

Fortunately, there are excep
tions, arid the boldest among
them is Gang of Four. Disdain
ing all the traditions of Contem
porary Rock, these guys make
music that is all guts. No one
member of Gang of Four leads
the melody, a possible parallel
to their Chinese namesakes. In
stead, the seat of power is in the
rhythms — drummer, bassist,
guitarist and singer all playing
at seemingly different speeds.
Out of these widely different
parts comes a compelling whole
— a sound that almost pushes
you forward as it spins around
on the turntable. The music is
compelling in concert too, as
singer Jon King lurches around
the stage like a palsy victim
with happy feet. But again, the
image isn't important, for the
sheer energy of Gang of Four is
the main ingredient, found in
huge amounts on their latest
LP, Solid Gold.
Similarly titled to last year's
Entertainment!, the new Gang
of Four album continues to un
veil a unique picture of life-as

politics on this collection of
slightly leftist rock. With song
titles like "The Republic" and
"He'd Send in the Army," you
know these folks didn't choose
their inspired name out of the
blue. But even more so than
before, the Gang of Four aren't
as blatantly political as they ap
pear. The outstanding opening
track, "Paralysed," illustrates
social problems brought down
from the theoretical to the indi
vidual. In front of Andy Gill's
sparse but crunching guitar
chords and the finely honed
rhythm section of Dave Allen
and Hugo Burnham (I hate that
term — this group is a four
man rhythm section), King's
detached vocals still fill the lis
tener with the emotion of a man
out of place. He claims "History
is the reason/ I'm washed up"
while his obvious bitterness sug
gests otherwise Adding to the
tension is a tune that almost
stops at various points through
out the track, only to start again
with more power and starker
vocals. When King closes such a

quiet break with an angry "I
was good at what I did," the lis
tener can't help but teel the
wrenching determination of his
tone.
The sheer force of rhythm in
Solid Gold continues through
"What We All Want" ("is what
you get"), the mass of in
terlocking instruments in "If I
Could Keep It For Myself," and
a carryover from their recent
LP, "Outside the Trains Don't
Run on Time." But while the
latter track sounds like the
earlier, more trebly work of the
Gang, "Why Theory?" closes
Side ■ with a new perspective.
Some echoing keyboard work,
only sporadically present in this
small band, dominates the in
troduction, with Gill's guitar re
duced to occasional single
scratches. The song offers a mu
sical retreat from the near
atonality of "Trains," and a
more personal statement to
boot: "Too much thinking
makes me ill/ I think I'll have
another gin/ A few more drinks
it'll be alright."

Side 2, on the other hand, is
more erratic, offering a couple
ot missteps along the path to so
cial reform. "Cheeseburger"
sounds like something Devo
would write if they could do
more than one riff without self
destructing. Unlike "Paral
ysed," this one stops to rest in
stead ot build, resulting in a
mess of feedback at the end.
The dip is short-lived, though,
as "The Republic" and "In the
Ditch" push the listener back
into the beat. By this point, Jon
King makes clear in his lyrics
that he is not merely observing,
but acting on his beliefs in the
songs. This commitment shows
up in "In the Ditch," perhaps
the best lyrical summary of
Gang of Four: "Martial music,
the beat goes on/ Get down,
down to the floor." This Gang
knows the hazards of power
without thought, in politics and
in music. Maybe because of this
sharpness, the Gang of Four
seem more compelling than
ever.
After "A Hole in the Wallet,"

a relatively commercial attack
on sexism, and "He'd Send in
the Army," Solid Gold ends,
having drained the listener with
its power. By discovering new
boundaries in its many rhythms
and combining disparate

sounds, Gang of Four is unique
in its uncommercial music; yet
amazingly faithful to long-held
rock values, values that are ov
erlooked in today's industry. To
make music like that takes guts
— and they have guts to spare.

a carryover from their recent
LP, "Outside the Trains Don't
Run on Time." But while the
latter track sounds like the
earlier, more trebly work of the
Gang, "Why Theory?" closes
Side ■ with a new perspective.
Some echoing keyboard work,
only sporadically present in this
small band, dominates the in
troduction, with Gill's guitar re
duced to occasional single
scratches. The song offers a mu
sical retreat from the near
atonality of "Trains," and a
more personal statement to
boot: "Too much thinking
makes me ill/ I think I'll have
another gin/ A few more drinks
it'll be alright."

Side 2, on the other hand, is
more erratic, offering a couple
ot missteps along the path to so
cial reform. "Cheeseburger"
sounds like something Devo
would write if they could do
more than one riff without self
destructing. Unlike "Paral
ysed," this one stops to rest in
stead ot build, resulting in a
mess of feedback at the end.
The dip is short-lived, though,
as "The Republic" and "In the
Ditch" push the listener back
into the beat. By this point, Jon
King makes clear in his lyrics
that he is not merely observing,
but acting on his beliefs in the
songs. This commitment shows
up in "In the Ditch," perhaps
the best lyrical summary of
Gang of Four: "Martial music,
the beat goes on/ Get down,
down to the floor." This Gang
knows the hazards of power
without thought, in politics and
in music. Maybe because of this
sharpness, the Gang of Four
seem more compelling than
ever.
After "A Hole in the Wallet,"

a relatively commercial attack
on sexism, and "He'd Send in
the Army," Solid Gold ends,
having drained the listener with
its power. By discovering new
boundaries in its many rhythms
and combining disparate

sounds, Gang of Four is unique
in its uncommercial music; yet
amazingly faithful to long-held
rock values, values that are ov
erlooked in today's industry. To
make music like that takes guts
— and they have guts to spare.

Once upon a time, rock music
had guts. Ever since Rock
Around the Clock changed the
times of musicians everywhere,
power has been the key to emo
tion in rock and roll. Wimpy
troubadors who sound real pret
ty may be entertaining at times,
but as tar as advances in
modern music is concerned,
people take notice of sounds that
grab them by the throat, throw
them off their back, on their
feet*out the door, and into a tel
ephone pole. Unfortunately, the
former style has been the trend,
leading most folks to write off
the 1970s in terms of creativity.
The explosion of new wave in
976-77 helped things greatly,
with the Sex Pistols (and hun
dreds of spitting images of
them) reintroducing anger and
rebellion into music. But now.
most of new wave is as tame in
its dissatisfaction as the rest of
popular music, becoming "the
same old thing in brand new
drag" (David Bowie). One step
forward, two steps back.

Fortunately, there are excep
tions, arid the boldest among
them is Gang of Four. Disdain
ing all the traditions of Contem
porary Rock, these guys make
music that is all guts. No one
member of Gang of Four leads
the melody, a possible parallel
to their Chinese namesakes. In
stead, the seat of power is in the
rhythms — drummer, bassist,
guitarist and singer all playing
at seemingly different speeds.
Out of these widely different
parts comes a compelling whole
— a sound that almost pushes
you forward as it spins around
on the turntable. The music is
compelling in concert too, as
singer Jon King lurches around
the stage like a palsy victim
with happy feet. But again, the
image isn't important, for the
sheer energy of Gang of Four is
the main ingredient, found in
huge amounts on their latest
LP, Solid Gold.
Similarly titled to last year's
Entertainment!, the new Gang
of Four album continues to un
veil a unique picture of life-as

politics on this collection of
slightly leftist rock. With song
titles like "The Republic" and
"He'd Send in the Army," you
know these folks didn't choose
their inspired name out of the
blue. But even more so than
before, the Gang of Four aren't
as blatantly political as they ap
pear. The outstanding opening
track, "Paralysed," illustrates
social problems brought down
from the theoretical to the indi
vidual. In front of Andy Gill's
sparse but crunching guitar
chords and the finely honed
rhythm section of Dave Allen
and Hugo Burnham (I hate that
term — this group is a four
man rhythm section), King's
detached vocals still fill the lis
tener with the emotion of a man
out of place. He claims "History
is the reason/ I'm washed up"
while his obvious bitterness sug
gests otherwise Adding to the
tension is a tune that almost
stops at various points through
out the track, only to start again
with more power and starker
vocals. When King closes such a

quiet break with an angry "I
was good at what I did," the lis
tener can't help but teel the
wrenching determination of his
tone.
The sheer force of rhythm in
Solid Gold continues through
"What We All Want" ("is what
you get"), the mass of in
terlocking instruments in "If I
Could Keep It For Myself," and

Run on Time." But while the
