# Kieth Merril shelves politics for mythology in 'Windwalker'
## 
### Vince Waldman 
A few months ago, Bay Area filmmaker
Kieth Merril released a movie called Harry 's
War. Heavily pervaded with traditional poli
tics and rhetorical attacks on Big Govern
ment, it was nevertheless a warm and
creative comedy. Harry's War was notice that
Merril was on his way to becoming a leading
cinematic voice of the new conservatism in
America.
Merril's newest film, Windwalker, shelves
the contemporary politics. It is the story of a
family of the Cheyenne tribe who must flee
from their enemies in the Crow tribe. It is set
in 1797, when the only impact of the white man
on the West was the introduction ot the horse.
When the actors (most ot whom are Native
American) speak, it is in the Cheyenne and
Crow tongues.
Even so, Windwalker is very similar to
Harry's War — and to Merril's Oscar-winning
documentary The Great American Cowboy —
in the way it glorifies strong, individualistic

men. The Windwalker (Trevor Howard) is an
aged Cheyenne who uses guile and nerve to
survive countless hardships as he guides his
family south to meet the rest ot the tribe. He
kills a bear; he heals his wounded son; he re
unites his divided family; he destroys the
Crow enemy despite overwhelming odds.
Windwalker is less an action-packed adven
ture story than an evocation of mythological
certainties. Thus the members of the Crow
tribe are almost all depicted as cruel, in
sensitive, and dishonorable; they pursue the
helpless Cheyenne family even after they be
lieve the men are dead, and talk lustfully of
raping the Cheyenne wives. Against them is
the Windwalker, who has mystical powers of
such potency that his young grandchildren can
vanquish the Crow warriors. The film be
comes a tale of good and evil in which — true
to tradition — good must triumph.
The film has an underlying tone of majestic
inevitability. Much of the story is told in hazy
flashbacks which reduce past events to sym

bolic shots. The moment when the Wind
walker (as a young man, played by James Re
mar) learns that his wife is pregnant (in a dis
tant, silent shot, he leans over and puts his ear
to her belly) is naively beautiful: we rarely
see such innocent joy in movies anymore.
But the technique can become hackneyed.
Like Harry's War, Windwalker was filmed in
the mountains ot Utah, and Merril uses the
scenery to show the changing ot the seasons.
These shots are undeniably beautiful, and
were intended, one supposes, to remind us ot
the overwhelming power of nature and the in
evitable passing ot time. But this concept
wears thin after a while; the pictures lose
their power and start to look like home movies
of Merril's vacation in the Wasatch National
Forest.
Merril stresses dignity (at least in his
portrayals of the Cheyenne men), which is ap
propriate tor a film that strives to be a recita
tion ot legend. But sometimes the dignity gets
in the way. The Indian dialogue (at least as it

is translated in the subtitles) is absurdly un
natural on occasion. Perhaps this is merely
the translation; Howard reads the unspoken
thoughts of the Windwalker (in English) with
poetic gravity, and these lines are often quite
moving. There is no such excuse tor Merril
Jenson's music, however. While some ot the
score is interesting, as performed by the Na
tional Philharmonic ot London it is portentous
beyond belief. In any case, it's hard to under
stand why Merril would go to the trouble ot
making a film in native Indian languages and
then use a full European orchestra for the mu
sic.
Windwalker runs a little over two hours —
about thirty minutes too long, especially tor a
film aimed at a "family" audience. It's also
rather gory tor a kids' movie; what with all
the bloody killing one wonders how the Indians
survived even before the white man arrived.
Still, it does a good job of providing a role
model: Howard's Windwalker is both vener
able and strong.

The portrayal of the Cheyenne women is
less admirable: they are always falling help
lessly into the grip of danger and must be
saved by the valiant acts of the men. Even
Windwalker's little grandsons are more
capable of withstanding danger than their
mother.
The not-so-subtle sexism is part and parcel
ot Merril's old-fashioned style. His tradi
tionalism may also be responsible for making
the film intermittently boring to modern au
diences. Still, Merril deserves compliment
for his celebrations of individualism and of the
integrity of family lite. Whether or not you
like his philosophy (and it's hard to argue with
his romantic empathy for the freedom of
primitive culture) he brings it to the screen
with taste and wit. With Clint Eastwood out
making chimpanzee movies, Merril may be
the most able exponent of the conservative
libertarian ethos now working in American
film

the translation; Howard reads the unspoken
thoughts of the Windwalker (in English) with
poetic gravity, and these lines are often quite
moving. There is no such excuse tor Merril
Jenson's music, however. While some ot the
score is interesting, as performed by the Na
tional Philharmonic ot London it is portentous
beyond belief. In any case, it's hard to under
stand why Merril would go to the trouble ot
making a film in native Indian languages and
then use a full European orchestra for the mu
sic.
Windwalker runs a little over two hours —
about thirty minutes too long, especially tor a
film aimed at a "family" audience. It's also
rather gory tor a kids' movie; what with all
the bloody killing one wonders how the Indians
survived even before the white man arrived.
Still, it does a good job of providing a role
model: Howard's Windwalker is both vener
able and strong.

The portrayal of the Cheyenne women is
less admirable: they are always falling help
lessly into the grip of danger and must be
saved by the valiant acts of the men. Even
Windwalker's little grandsons are more
capable of withstanding danger than their
mother.
The not-so-subtle sexism is part and parcel
ot Merril's old-fashioned style. His tradi
tionalism may also be responsible for making
the film intermittently boring to modern au
diences. Still, Merril deserves compliment
for his celebrations of individualism and of the
integrity of family lite. Whether or not you
like his philosophy (and it's hard to argue with
his romantic empathy for the freedom of
primitive culture) he brings it to the screen
with taste and wit. With Clint Eastwood out
making chimpanzee movies, Merril may be
the most able exponent of the conservative
libertarian ethos now working in American
film
A few months ago, Bay Area filmmaker
Kieth Merril released a movie called Harry 's
War. Heavily pervaded with traditional poli
tics and rhetorical attacks on Big Govern
ment, it was nevertheless a warm and
creative comedy. Harry's War was notice that
Merril was on his way to becoming a leading
cinematic voice of the new conservatism in
America.
Merril's newest film, Windwalker, shelves
the contemporary politics. It is the story of a
family of the Cheyenne tribe who must flee
from their enemies in the Crow tribe. It is set
in 1797, when the only impact of the white man
on the West was the introduction ot the horse.
When the actors (most ot whom are Native
American) speak, it is in the Cheyenne and
Crow tongues.
Even so, Windwalker is very similar to
Harry's War — and to Merril's Oscar-winning
documentary The Great American Cowboy —
in the way it glorifies strong, individualistic

men. The Windwalker (Trevor Howard) is an
aged Cheyenne who uses guile and nerve to
survive countless hardships as he guides his
family south to meet the rest ot the tribe. He
kills a bear; he heals his wounded son; he re
unites his divided family; he destroys the
Crow enemy despite overwhelming odds.
Windwalker is less an action-packed adven
ture story than an evocation of mythological
certainties. Thus the members of the Crow
tribe are almost all depicted as cruel, in
sensitive, and dishonorable; they pursue the
helpless Cheyenne family even after they be
lieve the men are dead, and talk lustfully of
raping the Cheyenne wives. Against them is
the Windwalker, who has mystical powers of
such potency that his young grandchildren can
vanquish the Crow warriors. The film be
comes a tale of good and evil in which — true
to tradition — good must triumph.
The film has an underlying tone of majestic
inevitability. Much of the story is told in hazy
flashbacks which reduce past events to sym

bolic shots. The moment when the Wind
walker (as a young man, played by James Re
mar) learns that his wife is pregnant (in a dis
tant, silent shot, he leans over and puts his ear
to her belly) is naively beautiful: we rarely
see such innocent joy in movies anymore.
But the technique can become hackneyed.
Like Harry's War, Windwalker was filmed in
the mountains ot Utah, and Merril uses the
scenery to show the changing ot the seasons.
These shots are undeniably beautiful, and
were intended, one supposes, to remind us ot
the overwhelming power of nature and the in
evitable passing ot time. But this concept
wears thin after a while; the pictures lose
their power and start to look like home movies
of Merril's vacation in the Wasatch National
Forest.
Merril stresses dignity (at least in his
portrayals of the Cheyenne men), which is ap
propriate tor a film that strives to be a recita
tion ot legend. But sometimes the dignity gets
in the way. The Indian dialogue (at least as it

is translated in the subtitles) is absurdly un
natural on occasion. Perhaps this is merely
the translation; Howard reads the unspoken
thoughts of the Windwalker (in English) with
poetic gravity, and these lines are often quite
moving. There is no such excuse tor Merril
