The rapid pace of change in the
Middle East is the basis for there
surgence of Islam in government, said
Howard Reed, a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institute, in a speech last night
on Middle Eastern politics.
"Rapid change induces stress, and
this causes people to go back to their
roots when they don't know where to
turn," said Reed. He used the Islamic
overthrow of the Iranian Shah as one
of the most visible examples of a re
turn to fundamental beliefs in the face
of rapid change.
Addressing 75 members ol the pen
insula chapter of the World Affairs
Council, a community organization
designed to increase awareness ot in
ternational issues. Reed said that af
ter "the revolution in Iran, designed to
dislodge a despised shah and a system
which most Iranians believed was not
in their best interests," the people
"turned back to their roots" to estab
lish an Islamic republic.
One of the key factors contributing
to the success ot this revolution, ac
cording to Reed, was the communica
tion network of the clerical communi
ty. This network was one thing the

shah's secret police could not get a
hold ol and destroy, he said.
Reed defined Islam in general as "a
faith and a community of believers
dedicated to peace in the world."
Since the founding of the religion in
the seventh century, "Islam has been
closely linked with politics" and that
the western distinction between
church and state does not exist in the
Middle East.
The extent to which the two are sep
arated is a matter of constant debate
in Islamic republics, said Reed. The
Ayatollah Khomeini is subject to
harsh criticism from clerical leaders
in Iran for participating directly in the
process of government. Traditionally,
Islamic scholars have "avoided direct
rule for tear of corruption," he said.
Instead, they generally serve as ad
visors to the government.
Because ol this debate, "The ten
sions in the top Islamic leadership in
Iran are very real," he said.
Reed noted several ways the United
States could increase its under
standing of the Middle East and im
prove its aid policy in the area, partic
ularly in Iran. The U.S. should re
establish links with Iran and help

them import food and in general
"show a more humanitarian concern
for Iranians regardless of political dif
ferences," Reed said.
In the current conflict between Iran
and Iraq in Lebanon, Reed said dif
ferences between Islamic sects have
been an influential but not decisive
factor in initiating and continuing the
hostilities. It is more important, ac
cording to Reed, that "Syria and Is
rael are using different groups in Leb
anon as surrogates to attack each oth
er."
In general, the United States needs
to cooperate more with the people in
the Middle East and we "need to know
more about them." Reed said. There
are not enough resources to learn
about the area now, and with Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's proposed $28
million in budget cuts in international
studies, including funds used for ex
changing scholars, we "run the dan
ger of being blind" to problems in the
area. Reed said.
Reed, a professor of Middle Eastern
and Islamic History at the University
of Conneticut, is currently at the Hoo
ver to do research on Modern Turkey.
