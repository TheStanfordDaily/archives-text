# Lindley fronts own band
## 
### Tom Casciato 
David Lindley is one of the
best musicians in rock and
roll. An accomplished
guitarist, slide guitarist, and
violinist, Lindley is best
known for his work with
Jackson Browne, (whom he
has backed since 972s For
F.rcryman), Crosby and
Nash, and on various occa
sions, James Taylor, Linda
Ronstadt, and everybody
else in L A. who knows any of
the above.
Unlike many guitar stars,
he is known more for his
flawless sense of melody
than for how many 64th notes
he can cram into twelve
bars. In concert, he is a mas
ter of taste and restraint. On
record, he's turned more
three-chord ditties into bona
tide classics than any other
sideman in the business.
Lindley brought his own
band to the Keystone Palo
Alto Sunday night tor the
opening show ot his first solo
tour, one that will hook up
with Joe Walsh's summer
tour in June. His Northern
California dates were, ac
cording to an
Elektra/Asylum publicist,
warm-ups for the big shows
with Walsh.
And the show featured all
the ragged highs and lows of
a warm-up. Featuring main
ly music from Lindley's new
album, FA Rayo-X, the band
worked through an hour and
a halt of creative and in
teresting music — something
of a fusion ot reggae and New
Wave, but with a distinctly
American sound, containing
certain country and folk ele
ments that make this
sound easily distinguishable
from similar fusions by Brit
ish New Wave bands. But
while Lindley may well have
been superb on guitar, it was
near impossible to tell. The
band was too loud, and the in
struments so poorly mixed
that it was often difficult to
distinguish his solos from the
sounds of the rest of the
band. He did one number on
mandolin, but the sound was
so poor he might as well have

been playing a synthesizer
for the tone he was getting.
The best numbers were
those which featured his
trademark slide guitar — it
was mixed loud and clear
above the rest of the band,
and he played it with a com
mand that few players have
over the instrument.
Lindley's singing credits
to date include only the
falsetto part on Jackson
Browne's "Stay," but he
sang every song of the set, in
a high, not unpleasant voice
that was perfectly suited, if
anything is, to reggae/New
Wave versions of "Twist and
Shout" and "Bye Bye Love,"
the latter of which he per
formed with Jackson
Browne on guitar and backup
vocals.
Yes girls, Jackson showed
up to help his old buddy out on
the encore. After "Bye Bye
Love," somebody had the
good sense to turn the vol
ume down as Browne came
center-stage for the eve
ning's high point: a Lindley
arranged, reggae version of
"Doctor My Eyes," retitled
"Doctor I Eyes," or "Doctor
I I's" or something like that,
for some Rastafarian reason
that was never sufficiently
explained.
Another encore, an excit
ing, if noisy and un

rehearsed, version of "Red
neck Friend" closed out the
show.
While it was a treat to have
Jackson Browne on hand, one
has to wonder what he was
doing there if Lindley is
trying to establish some
commercial credibility on
his own. Sure his appearance
sold more tickets — the Key
stone leaked the news of
Browne's appearance a tew
days before the show (Tower
Records reportedly ad
vertised it on a special bin of
Jackson Browne records,
and there was a flyer with his
name on it taped to the gar
bage can in front of the Tres
idder Wells Fargo Bank).
And Browne stuck around,
after the band left the stage,
to inform the audience that
David Lindley "is my main
man" (read: "is my main
man so buy his record.").
But appearances like this
are dangerous; Once Rolling
Stone sticks this in its "Ran
dom Notes." a lot of people
are going to see David
Lindley open for Joe Walsh
and be disappointed if there
are no special guests.
And that's a shame. De
spite the kinks and flaws,
Lindley's show proved that
he is more than capable of
fronting a band, and, after a
warm-up or two, he should do
just fine on his own.

David Lindley is one of the
best musicians in rock and
roll. An accomplished
guitarist, slide guitarist, and
violinist, Lindley is best
known for his work with
Jackson Browne, (whom he
has backed since 972s For
F.rcryman), Crosby and
Nash, and on various occa
sions, James Taylor, Linda
Ronstadt, and everybody
else in L A. who knows any of
the above.
Unlike many guitar stars,
he is known more for his
flawless sense of melody
than for how many 64th notes
he can cram into twelve
bars. In concert, he is a mas
ter of taste and restraint. On
record, he's turned more
three-chord ditties into bona
tide classics than any other
sideman in the business.
Lindley brought his own
band to the Keystone Palo
Alto Sunday night tor the
opening show ot his first solo
tour, one that will hook up
with Joe Walsh's summer
tour in June. His Northern
California dates were, ac
cording to an
Elektra/Asylum publicist,
warm-ups for the big shows
with Walsh.
And the show featured all
the ragged highs and lows of
a warm-up. Featuring main
ly music from Lindley's new
album, FA Rayo-X, the band
worked through an hour and
a halt of creative and in
teresting music — something
of a fusion ot reggae and New
Wave, but with a distinctly
American sound, containing
certain country and folk ele
ments that make this
sound easily distinguishable
from similar fusions by Brit
ish New Wave bands. But
while Lindley may well have
been superb on guitar, it was
near impossible to tell. The
band was too loud, and the in
struments so poorly mixed
that it was often difficult to
distinguish his solos from the
sounds of the rest of the
band. He did one number on
mandolin, but the sound was
so poor he might as well have

been playing a synthesizer
for the tone he was getting.
The best numbers were
those which featured his
trademark slide guitar — it
was mixed loud and clear
above the rest of the band,
and he played it with a com
mand that few players have
over the instrument.
Lindley's singing credits
to date include only the
falsetto part on Jackson
Browne's "Stay," but he
sang every song of the set, in
a high, not unpleasant voice
that was perfectly suited, if
anything is, to reggae/New
Wave versions of "Twist and
Shout" and "Bye Bye Love,"
the latter of which he per
formed with Jackson
Browne on guitar and backup
vocals.
Yes girls, Jackson showed
up to help his old buddy out on
the encore. After "Bye Bye
Love," somebody had the
good sense to turn the vol
ume down as Browne came
center-stage for the eve
ning's high point: a Lindley
arranged, reggae version of
"Doctor My Eyes," retitled
"Doctor I Eyes," or "Doctor
I I's" or something like that,
for some Rastafarian reason
that was never sufficiently
explained.
Another encore, an excit
ing, if noisy and un

rehearsed, version of "Red
neck Friend" closed out the
show.
While it was a treat to have
Jackson Browne on hand, one
has to wonder what he was
doing there if Lindley is
trying to establish some
commercial credibility on
his own. Sure his appearance
sold more tickets — the Key
stone leaked the news of
Browne's appearance a tew
days before the show (Tower
Records reportedly ad
vertised it on a special bin of
Jackson Browne records,
and there was a flyer with his
name on it taped to the gar
bage can in front of the Tres
idder Wells Fargo Bank).
And Browne stuck around,
after the band left the stage,
to inform the audience that
David Lindley "is my main
man" (read: "is my main
man so buy his record.").
But appearances like this
are dangerous; Once Rolling
Stone sticks this in its "Ran
dom Notes." a lot of people
are going to see David
Lindley open for Joe Walsh
and be disappointed if there
are no special guests.
And that's a shame. De
spite the kinks and flaws,
Lindley's show proved that
he is more than capable of
fronting a band, and, after a
warm-up or two, he should do
just fine on his own.
