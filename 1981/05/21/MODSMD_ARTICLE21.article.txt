# Love, sex and drugs in 'Fantasy'
## 
### Pat Carroll 
It's got love, it's got sex. it's
got drugs, and it's got a cast who
almost dance their asses oft.
It's "Just a Fantasy," a back
street, tongue-in-cheek tairy
tale "loosely based on Cin
derella" but this is one version
vou won't find in the brothers
(irimm.
"Just a Fantasy is a mixture
ot contemporary antagonists
and folk-lyrical naivete, and tor
the price of one admission you
get both. This almost-campy,
jazz-dance production is full of
gutsy exuberance and a raw.
sexual energy caricaturized
enough to keep it humorous. Jim
Sakamoto, a student here who
conceived and choreographed
"Just a Fantasy." carefully
controls the production which
includes in its cast of charac
ters: "The Pimp," and his ac
complice; "The Wanderer," a
somewhat reluctant hero; and
"The Trashettes," those women
of, to put it in the vernacular of a
former time, "dubious moral
distinction . . . and ah, question
able virtue."
"All right, they're whores,"
explained Keli Hook, who
dances the part oi a slowly de
teriorating, junk-crazed aid to
the pimp with a rhythmic sensu
ality suggesting far more than
we've a right to expect. In
"Pimp's Henchman," Hook
writhes and contorts to the mu
sic of the Stone's "Fingerprint
File," dramatically evoking the
image of a character fading in
and out ot a drug-induced void,
while he clings to.the energy of
sexual primacy as singular evi
dence of a formerly unshattered
existence.
Craig Haladay is "The
Pimp," intense, lustful, equat
ing power with the possession ot
his women. He is weakened and
ultimately conquered by his ob
session and the commitment he
makes to do anything to keep
them. Haladay struts his part,
delivering a performance ot
graceful eroticism; his moves
are bold, his form forceful and
sure. At times he dominates the
stage, taking command of his
ladies to the music of David
Bowie's "Fascination" with re
markable sensual presence.
Donna Helliwell exhibits
commendable comic presence

in her plucky characterization
of a fairy godmother — with a
twist. Abruptly arriving on the
scene always a little too late,
she communicates her blunders
to the audience, but the objects
ot her misdelivered good inten
tions — "The Wanderer" hero
and the heroine he loves — nev
er realize that the good tairy
never quite gets her act togeth
er.
Tina Suleiman's fine barre
trained form adds a graceful
elegance to her role as the inno
cent who is lusted after by the
pimp, scorned by the
"Trashettes," almost-pro
tected by her klutzy godmother
and, finally, rescued by her re
luctant "Wanderer".
Sakamoto attributes the
show's suggestive tone to the
music which includes AC/DCs
"You Shook Me All Night
Long," a number used to in
troduce "The Trashettes," the
group of four dancers he defines
as "tacky whores, stock charac
ters with enough humanity to
keep them from becoming ster
eotyped." The four women are
portrayed by Audrey Levine,
Mary Tanner, Liz Rosner and
Gayle McGinnis, all ot whom
deliver sultry, suggestive,and
ultimately convincing per
formances under the skillful
direction of Sakamoto; their
combined talents manage to
strike a fine balance between
overstated sexual voracity and

a dull, contemporary pas
d'ensem hie. They happily avoid
falling into gawdy rocking-n'-
rollina to a disco heat often
characteristic ot modern dance
revues.
Possibly one of the tinest
numbers in the production is
Sakomoto's enchanting presen
tation of "The Wanderer."
Sakomoto's moves are at the
same time puppet-like and
smooth, with a gracefulness of
form approaching elegance.

Done to the tune of Donna Sum
mer's "The Wanderer," the up
beat, snappy tempo of his steps
create the illusion of control by
celestial strings. The effect is
worthy of any good fantasy.
