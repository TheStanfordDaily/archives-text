have mercy.
Not too long afterward. Split
Enz bounded on. full of energy
and special effects, and creat
ing a type of circus atmosphere.
Front singer Tim Finn, like the
rest of the 'group, has no pre
tensions of art in his songs: "Oc
casionally. we probably move
people's emotions, but we be
lieve that we're there to enter
tain We don't have any illusions
above or beyond that." And en
tertain they do, though some
times at the expense ot details
like coherence. For instance, a
song like "Nobody Takes Me Se
riously." off last year's True
( 'dlours LP, was introduced as a
sort of Martian love song. Now
that explains things like the silly
sound effects and the
kaleidoscopic light show, but
what about the lyrics? Never
mind. With Tim Finn holding
the audience's attention with his
theatrical antics and
brother/guitarist Neil Finn
wowing em with some Towns
hendesque touches of power, the
enthusiastic crowd never no
ticed how dumb the words ac
tually are.
Which leads us. sadly enough,
to Waiata. Split Enz is a band
that needs to give you some
thing to watch while you listen.
That hurdle was taken rather
well by True Colours, boasting a
laser-etched design on the rec
ord that would thrill any music
lover/geometry student. Alas,
no gimmicks on the latest rec
ord — except in the music itself,
revealing Split Enz to be simply
all bread crumbs and no meat.

Not even veal.
The first side of Waiata starts
well, recalling the outstanding
music that also made True Col
ours irresistible to the first
time listener. "Hard Act to Fol
low" and "One Step Ahead,"
both reminiscent ot The Cure in
their heavy bass lines, begin
with excellent driving riffs. Af
ter that, though, these guys are
in la-la-land, in more ways than
one. Both songs, while they may
shift in tempo, don't build at all.
making one wonder why they
were written in the first place.
The nagginglv repetitive key
boards, so effective on True
Colours, don't help here either,
hinting at trouble for the album.
The next cut removes all
doubt by turning the hints into a
full-scale scandal. Actually, "I
Don't Wanna Dance" is the best
remake of Blondie's "Heart ot
Glass'' I've heard, except Split
Enz got the title wrong and
changed the names of the com
posers. All I have in my
notebook about this song is the
word "Sucko" written all over
the page. This is known in the
trade as critical insight.
The rest of Side One never re
covers from this blow, resorting
to Eurodisco backing riffs that
sound a lot like third-rate Alan
Parsons Project stuff. Knowing
what first-rate Alan Parsons
sounds like, that's pretty bleak.
The only bright spot is "Wail," a
(mercifully) instrumental tune
with a bass riff straight from

the theme from Hatman. Like
the band, it's silly, but it's fun.
Side Two rarely achieves
even the silliness, resulting in a
mildly enjoyable game of guess
the-rhymes-in-the-lyrics. Let's
see if you can do it. too. Suppose
the first line of a verse is "Ev
ery night it's always there."
What's the second line? "Mem
ories of our sad affair" — right!
Let's try another. "There was a
girl I used to know. . You're
almost there — it's "She dealt
my love a savage blow." Fun,
huh? Tim and Neil Finn, they
are God, no?''
After all the electronic nurs
ery-rhyme doodling, Waiata
grinds to a halt with "Albert of
India," another instrumental,
but this time with a piano lead
that's gotta be only a back fence
away from the E Street Band. It
sounds like a dentist's office, ex
cept there's no one who had tish
for lunch drilling your teeth dur
ing it. That might actually be an
improvement — at least then
you'd have something to watch.
Because ot that need. Split Enz
succeed in a sort of mindlessly
fun way on stage, but succumb
to their own mindlessness on
record. That's OK, in a way — if
Split Enz were (God forbid) pre
tentious in their electronics,
they'd be much worse than they
are. But on the other side of the
coin, there's a price to pay tor
innocence, and on Waiata, the
band winds up almost bankrupt.
