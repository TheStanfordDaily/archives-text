# A 						Little Night Music' waltzes into Tresidder
## 
### Tony Navarrete 
Had Johann Strauss ever set William
Shakespeare's .1 Midsummer Might's Dream to
music, he probably would have produced a musi
cal with a remarkable resemblance to A Little
Might Music. Because Strauss concentrated on
waltzes, however, it was not until 973, when Ste
phen Sondheim adapted Ingmar Bergman's*
movie. Smiles of a Summer Might, that this de
lightful combination reached the theater. Thanks
to the combined eftorts ot STARTS and The Com
pany, this recent Broadway hit will be pertormed
from May 27 to 30 in the Tresidder Memorial
Lounge.
The music is written entirely in 3/4 time and re
flects the story's stylish celebration ot romantic
love set in turn-of-the-century Sweden. The plot
centers around the hilarious situations which
arise between an aging actress who wishes to
marry the father of her illegitimate child, the
father who has been remarried for a year and not

consumated his marriage, the virgin wife who is
younger than her stepson, the seminary-bound
stepson who attacks anything in a skirt and finally
falls in love with his stepmother, a count who is
having an affair with the actress, and a countess
who loves her husband too much to care.
Although it is sometimes difficult to follow who
is sleeping (or in some cases, not sleeping) with
whom, the musical is even more difficult for the
actors. As in all Sondheim productions, the music
is characterized by intricate melodies. Perhaps
the greatest challenge to the actors, however, is
that the show is being produced in the Tresidder
lounge. Because of the small space, Night Music
is being performed in the round. While this has
proved challenging to the company, it will allow
for a sense of intimacy and contact with the per
formers impossible in a larger hall. The limited
space will also necessitate small audiences (ap
proximately 200) and seating on the floor. As a re
sult. early arrival is recommended.
