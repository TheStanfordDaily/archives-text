# 'Twelfth Night' is successful
## 
### Mike Hale 
The Drama Department's
current production of Twelfth
Might is the best looking, least
boring, most nearly pro
fessional campus play I have
seen this year. Ideally, nothing
more than this should have to be
said; but with Shakespeare the
question of interpretation must
be faced, and director Jim
Carmody's approach to the text
will not be to everyone's taste.
Questions of theme and charac
terization, however, should not
prevent anyone from seeing the
play, or enjoying it when they
do.
Praise of the production must
begin with John Rathman's
beautiful and functional set.
Rathman has made no attempt
to represent "Olivia's house" or
"the street." opting instead for
a colorful abstraction which
does not get in the way of the ac
tion. The set and the lighting de
sign (also Rathman's) both
serve the overall breakneck
pace of the production.
Carmody has rearranged the in
termissions (making a three
act play out of a five-act play),
and cut various bits of dialogue
while preserving the plot entire.
In fact, the emphasis here is
almost entirely on the plot, that
is, on the most immediately ac
cessible elements ot the play.
The production plays up the

slapstick and bawdy byplay, and
treats the more serious mo
ments perfunctorily or
satirically; most of the cutting
seems to have been done to the
overtly "philosophical" sec
tions of dialogue. This treat
ment is, in a way, a return to the
9th century approach to
Twelfth Night, in which the
play is seen as primarily an
amoral comedy, Malvolio is
shown no sympathy, and the
plotline involving his humil
iation is dominant. Carmody
seems to be deliberately going
against the modern tendency to
focus on the
Olivia/Orsino/Viola "illusion
and reality" plotline and its
moralistic overtones, and to
emphasize Malvolio's humanity
and the cruelty of what is done
to him. This may have been an
attempt to make an extremely
complicated play more in
telligible and enjoyable tor a
modern audience, and if so it
works, but at the cost of a cer
tain gravity many people expect
in a production of Shakespeare.
It is more likely, however, that
Carmody is simply trying to
bring out Shakespeare's genius
for keeping the action going,
and he succeeds at this too — the
production hardly ever lags.
The places where it does are
the fault of superfluous stage
business rather than poor tim

ing or pacing. There are two in
terminable bits involving
lengths of gaudy cloth which are
danced with, wound around bod
ies, and placed over heads; the
point of this escaped me. And as
part of the overall "earthiness"
of the production, the kitchen
scene was embellished with
groping and leering and falling
bodies, all of which seemed ex
cessive.
Within the limits imposed by
the director's interpretation,
the cast is generally excellent.
Especially good are Rush
Rehm, who plays Malvolio as a
complete ass, Lome Buchman,
as Feste the clown, and Fritz
Brun as Sir Toby, although his
(Danish?) accent breaks
through occasionally and makes
his speech unintelligible. Paul
King plays Orsino, and for once
his great stone face suits his
role; it gives him a nobility that
won't come from anywhere
else. Olivia is played by Lisa
Geller, who though competent,
turns the play's reigning love in
terest (four different men are
enamoured of her) into a shrew.
I assume that this is what she
has been told to do. Molly
Mayock is quite charming in the
crucial role of Viola, but again
vulgarization has occured; we
expect a much more self
possessed Viola than the coy,
mugging little creature we get.

Questions of theme and charac
terization, however, should not
prevent anyone from seeing the
play, or enjoying it when they
do.
Praise of the production must
begin with John Rathman's
beautiful and functional set.
Rathman has made no attempt
to represent "Olivia's house" or
"the street." opting instead for
a colorful abstraction which
does not get in the way of the ac
tion. The set and the lighting de
sign (also Rathman's) both
serve the overall breakneck
pace of the production.
Carmody has rearranged the in
termissions (making a three
act play out of a five-act play),
and cut various bits of dialogue
while preserving the plot entire.
In fact, the emphasis here is
almost entirely on the plot, that
is, on the most immediately ac
cessible elements ot the play.
The production plays up the

slapstick and bawdy byplay, and
treats the more serious mo
ments perfunctorily or
satirically; most of the cutting
seems to have been done to the
overtly "philosophical" sec
tions of dialogue. This treat
ment is, in a way, a return to the
9th century approach to
Twelfth Night, in which the
play is seen as primarily an
amoral comedy, Malvolio is
shown no sympathy, and the
plotline involving his humil
iation is dominant. Carmody
seems to be deliberately going
against the modern tendency to
focus on the
Olivia/Orsino/Viola "illusion
and reality" plotline and its
moralistic overtones, and to
emphasize Malvolio's humanity
and the cruelty of what is done
to him. This may have been an
attempt to make an extremely
complicated play more in
telligible and enjoyable tor a
modern audience, and if so it
works, but at the cost of a cer
tain gravity many people expect
in a production of Shakespeare.
It is more likely, however, that
Carmody is simply trying to
bring out Shakespeare's genius
for keeping the action going,
and he succeeds at this too — the
production hardly ever lags.
The places where it does are
the fault of superfluous stage
business rather than poor tim

ing or pacing. There are two in
terminable bits involving
lengths of gaudy cloth which are
danced with, wound around bod
ies, and placed over heads; the
point of this escaped me. And as
part of the overall "earthiness"
of the production, the kitchen
scene was embellished with
groping and leering and falling
bodies, all of which seemed ex
cessive.
Within the limits imposed by
the director's interpretation,
the cast is generally excellent.
Especially good are Rush
Rehm, who plays Malvolio as a
complete ass, Lome Buchman,
as Feste the clown, and Fritz
Brun as Sir Toby, although his
(Danish?) accent breaks
through occasionally and makes
his speech unintelligible. Paul
King plays Orsino, and for once
his great stone face suits his
role; it gives him a nobility that
won't come from anywhere
else. Olivia is played by Lisa
Geller, who though competent,
turns the play's reigning love in
terest (four different men are
enamoured of her) into a shrew.
I assume that this is what she
has been told to do. Molly
Mayock is quite charming in the
crucial role of Viola, but again
vulgarization has occured; we
expect a much more self
possessed Viola than the coy,
mugging little creature we get.
