# Abortion debates rage in Congress

### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The House helped a
prominent opponent of abortions
move one step closer to becoming
surgeon general yesterday, while, in
the Senate, eminent physicians de
nounced a pending anti-abortion bill as
"backwards authoritarianism" that
could outlaw certain forms of birth
control.
The House agreed by voice vote to
an unusual maneuver designed to
clear the way for President Ronald
Reagan's nomination of 64-year-old
Philadelphia surgeon C. Everett Koop
as surgeon general, even though the
statutory age limit lor the job is 63.
On a voice vote, the House directed
its representatives to accept a Senate
amendment permitting the age
waiver when the legislation comes up
in a conference committee But Dem
ocratic Rep Henry Waxman of Cali
fornia, a leader of the opposition to
Koop's nomination, said that he con
sidered yesterday's resolution ad
visory, rather than binding on the con
lerees. He said he and two of the other
four House conferees would continue
to oppose the age waiver w!i«?n the con
ference committee meets
Meanwhile, in a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee hearing, Dr. George

Ryan, president of the American Col
lege of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, insisted that a pending
anti-abortion bill would ban the in
trauterine birth-control device and
certain low-dose contraceptive pills.
"This is not the way to resolve the
abortion issue," Ryan said, denounc
ing a bill by Sens. Jesse Helms and
John East, both Republicans from
North Carolina The bill defines life as
beginning at the moment of concep
tion and thus could pave the way for
states to forbid all abortions.
"Who are we to conceive of putting
into legislation rules that will affect
every woman who ever becomes preg
nant. to say to her, You must carry
that pregnancy to term because it's
life?' Senator East, I think that's non
sense," said Dr Mary Ellen Avery, a
Harvard medical professor and chief
physician at Children's Hospital in
Boston.
Dr. Lewis Thomas, who heads the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York, joined the others
in concluding that the origin of lite is
"not in any real sense a scientific
question and cannot be answered by
scientists."
(At an earlier hearing held by East,
other scientific witnesses testified

that life begins at the moment of con
ception.)
After hearing hours of testimony
critical to his bill and to the tight to
ban all abortions. East heatedly told
the witnesses .
"I had polio at the age of 24 before
vaccine (was available), and I'm par
alyzed from the waist down. I've often
wondered if medical science had told
my mother that this fetus was suscep
tible to polio, are we then to suggest
that my mother ought to have con
sidered aborting 0 If so, I would have
liked to have discouraged that."
East criticized Avery's argument
that babies should be wanted by their
mothers — and that the pre-birth
screening procedure known as am
niocentesis, (to detect disease or de
fects in the fetus), which earlier wit
nesses had said would be banned by
the bill, was necessary.
"I'm troubled by the idea of this
right to be born healthy, free of cleft
palates," East said,
Avery testified that scientific evi
dence shows that fetuses under the age
of 24 to 26 weeks are not "human
beings" because they are not "viable"
— that without the mother, they do not
have the ability to grow even if all of
medical technology is applied to them.
