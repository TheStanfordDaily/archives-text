Begin sobered by firm Syrian stance
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin, his
earlier optimism deflated by some tough talk from Presi
dent Hafez Assad of Syria, said yesterday that Israel
would continue to seek a peaceful solution to the Lebanon
missile crisis but that no breakthrough was imminent
Begin s comments, which followed a 95-minute meeting
with Philip Habib. President Ronald Reagan's special en
voy to the Middle East, served to tone down official
speculation that a settlement was near.
"We shall again enable Mr. Habib to continue his ef
forts." Begin said. "The statement by Mr. Assad doesn't
create the proper atmosphere but maybe Mr. Habib. with

his great intelligence and ability, will overcome this."
Begin objected specifically to Assad's assertion that
Habib had presented Syria not with an American proposal
tor compromise, but with Israeli demands.
Begin said that Assad's claim of Israeli demands was
"simply untrue." "The fact is that Mr. Habib delivered
American proposals to Mr Assad.'' he said
" I keep hearing about this so-called American proposal,
but this plan — as reported in the press — has not been pre
sented to us." Assad said in a news conference for Ameri
can reporters in Damascus. "All the talk is about Israeli
demands so far "
It was reported that Assad also said that he was con
vinced that Israel "intends to take military action"
against Syrian forces. He insisted that Syria would not
agree to remove its anti-aircraft missiles from Lebanon.
"Israel says it should have access to Lebanese air
space." Assad said. "Israel feels free to attack our forces
but it we provide our forces with defensive weapons then
Israel says we have no such right." t
Begin said that the only way to end the crisis was to re
store the "status quo ante" by returning to the tactical sit
uation that existed in Lebanon before Israeli jets shot
down Syrian helicopters and Syria moved the SAM-6 mis
siles into Lebanon.
For his part, Assad said that the missiles are purely de
fensive and "cannot attack targets inside Israel." He said
that Syria has no intention of removing them.
U.N. group passes baby formula bill
Geneva. Switzerland — Overriding U.S. objections, the
World Health Organization voted yesterday to encourage
women around the world, especially in poor nations, to
breast-leed their children rather than give them manufac
tured substitutes.
Only two other nations joined the United States in the
93-3 vote, which was supported by both our Western Eu
ropean allies and the Soviet bloc.
Proponents ot the non-binding code say manufacturers'
high-powered sales tactics discourage breast-feeding,
which is universally regarded as the healthiest infant
nourishment. They say formula is misused in the Third
World where it is mixed with polluted water under poor
health conditions that contribute to millions ot infant
deaths.
The Reagan administration took its stand on grounds the
United Nations agency should not be in the business of is
suing international regulations.
In Washington, two senior officials of the U.S. Agency
for International Development followed through with
their threat and resigned in protest against the U.S. vote.

One. Dr. Eugene Babb earlier said "This is not an issue
of free enterprise versus governmental regulation " His
colleague. Dr. Stephen Joseph, had said "a no' vote on this
code will signal the world that the United States does not
care if our tirms behave irresponsibly overseas.'
They announced their resignations during the meeting
of a forum sponsored by Sen Edward Kennedy (D-Mass >.
who is looking into the Reagan administration decision
The non-binding eight-page code urges a global ban on
promotion and advertising of baby formula, on distribu
tion of free product samples, and on gifts tor promoting
the use of formula as a substitute for breast milk
UNICEF, which worked with WHO in framing the code,
has said "it is likely that at least one million children in the
developing world die each year from inadequate artificial
feeding."
Nuclear dispute angers Japanese
Tokyo — The United States yesterday sought to ease
Japan's latest nuclear arms dilemma by insisting that it
has honored its commitments under the U.S.-Japan
mutual security treaty that covers the deployment of nu
clear weapons here.
A controversy was triggered in Japan recently when the
former U.S. ambassador, Edwin Reischauer, said that
American warships have routinely carried nuclear weap
ons into Japanese ports for 20 years. Ambassador Mike

Mansfield said that the former ambassador "was speak
ing as a private individual" when he made his statement.
Manstield's comments, released later by the American
Embassy, did not, however, touch on the central question
of whether the ships entering Japanese waters actually
carry nuclear weapons. He repeated a government policy
of refusing to confirm or deny the existence of such weap
ons anywhere.
