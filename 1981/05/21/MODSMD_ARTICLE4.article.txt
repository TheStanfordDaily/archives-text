# Senate rejects Reagan Soc. Sec. cuts
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Led by its Re
publican majority, the Senate voted
unanimously yesterday to spurn two
critical aspects of President Ronald
Reagan's new plan to cut Social Secur
ity benefits.
First rejecting by only a one-v9te
margin an even harsher repudiation
proposed by the Democrats, the Sen
ate went on record 96-0 against any
proposal that would "precipitously
and unfairly penalize early retirees"
or reduce benefits more than neces
sary.
Almost at the same time, House
Democrats unanimously adopted a
statement characterizing Reagan's
proposals as an "unconscionable
breach of faith," especially with early

retirees.
These reversals for the president
came even as the House was confirm
ing his earlier budget victories by
finally adopting, 244-155, the much-cut
budget resolution he supported tor
next fiscal year.
Reagan last week proposed, on top
of his first round of budget cuts, major
new retrenchments in Social Security,
the sharpest of which would alfect
those seeking in the future to retire
before age 65. His recommendations
would cut future benefits nearly twice
as much as required to keep the Social
Security system solvent, assuming the
economy behaves as anticipated. Such
cuts would serve not only to keep the
system afloat without new inreases in
taxes; they would help reduce future
budget deficits as well.
Jubilant Demqcrats said the Senate
vote amounted to a repudiation of the
scope of the proposed cuts, as well as
the early retirement provision
Almost mischievously, they suggested
that the Republicans merely copied
the essence ol their proposal, which
had been tabled by a vote of 49-48. with
Republicans Lowell Weicker Jr.
(Conn.) and William Roth Jr. (Del.)
joining all Democrats in support of it.
'We won the point'
The Republican proposal on Social
Security, offered by Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Robert Dole
(R-Kan), was "a rejection of those
proposals, tacitly and interentially,"
said Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) "We won the point ... , "
claimed Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-

N.Y.).
The vote by the Republican-con
trolled Senate, although only
hortatory in nature, amounted to the
most important rebuff Reagan has re
ceived so far from Congress — al
though the White House itself has been
backpedaling a little in recent days on
the Social Security recommendations.
The Senate action came as the Dem
ocratic-dominated House gave final
approval to a compromise version of
Reagan's slashed-back 1982 spending
targets that mandate more than $35
billion in actual program cuts. The
Senate was expected to follow suit on
the budget later in the day.
O'Neill plots to save programs
But even as the White House tasted
victory in Phase One of its budget-cut
ting drive, House Speaker Thomas
(Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) plotted a
strategy to salvage some of the threat
ened programs.
"If it breaks the budget, then that is
the will of Congress," said O'Neill as
he outlined a procedure under which
the House can entertain second
thoughts about actually approving the
program cuts that it is instructing its
legislative committees to draft.
Asked if he was proposing to un
ravel the whole austerity program.
O'Neill smiled and said he was just
"giving members of Congress a
chance to vote for the programs that
truly made America great."
The House vote was 244-155, with all
but eight of the opposition votes com
ing from Democrats, to approve a

House-Senate budget compromise to
taling $695.5 billion, with a projected
deficit of $37.7 billion.
The preliminary budget proposes to
give Reagan virtually all the spending
cuts he wants, along with room tor the
more than $50 billion, three-year,
across-the-bbard tax cut that he has
proposed.
Only first phase complete
But yesterday's action only com
pletes the first, easiest phase of the
protracted, complex budget process.
The budget neither makes actual
spending cuts nor binds Congress to
the tax cut, which is considered un
likely to pass without modification.
Actual tax and spending cuts will have
to come later, which is what gives

O'Neill an opportunity to try to restore
some of the money that the first
budget resolution proposes to cut.
O'Neill would enforce the cuts in
only a technical sense. He would have
the committees meet their targets for
program cuts but also encourage them
to propose amendments to restore
money for programs that they con
sider essential. Thus, House members
would be voting on specific program
cuts rather than on generalities of the
Reagan budget, which has proved to
be extremely popular in Congress.
Democrats won't 'play dead'
"We're not going to roll over and
play dead and let them (the Re
publicans) stew in their own juice,"'
said O'Neill, while insisting he was not
being obstructionist.
