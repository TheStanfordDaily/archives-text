# U.S. financed secret force sent into Laos
## Mercenaries searched for Americans rumored imprisoned in camp 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The United States fi
nanced and helped train a secret force
of mercenaries who went into Laos
earlier this month to determine if
Americans were imprisoned in a
jungle camp there, as covert over
flights by satellites and spy planes had
suggested.
The reconnaissance force 1 eturned
a few days ago without any evidence
that Americans were in the camp,
chilling the hopes that the earlier
photographic intelligence had raised
in the minds of some Pentagon of
ficials.
The team of Asians, believed to be
Laotians, had been issued cameras to
take pictures of the camp's inhabi
tants to supplement the overhead pho
tography collected by the CIA and De
fense Intelligence Agency, sources
said.
The sources added that photo in
terpreters scrutinized all the photog
raphy last weekend and concluded
that there were no Americans in the
jungle camp.
'Special operations'
Asked about the mission. Col.
Ronald Duchin, chief of the Pentagon
news branch, said last night, "We do
not comment on any special opera
tions of this kind."
In another statement personally ap
proved by Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, the Pentagon said the fol
lowing when queried by The Washing
ton Post about efforts to rescue any
Americans still being held captive in
Southeast Asia.
"There has been a steady flow of re
ports about Americans being held
against their will in Southeast Asia
since the flow of Vietnamese from
Southeast Asia began The U.S. gov
ernment regularly, and with great
care, has and will continue to check
the validity of each of these reports.
The United States can be expected to
take appropriate action if any of these
reports proves to be true. Top priority
effort will continue to be assigned to
investigate these efforts."
The families of servicemen missing
in the Vietnam war have continued to
believe that some of their relatives
are still alive and are being held cap
tive in Southeast Asia. They have pres
sured the government repeatedly to
try to locate the men and rescue them.
The National League of Families of
American Prisoners and Missing in
Action in Southeast Asia has com
plained that the U.S. government has
failed to press hard enough to find
missing Americans.
By the Pentagon's count, there are
2528 Americans unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia, including 237 listed
as missing in action Of that total. 560
U.S. airmen went down in Laos, ac
cording to the Pentagon, with 295 of
them believed killed in crashes.
Of the other 265, 14 have been re
leased alive as prisoners of war
through Hanoi. Laos also has sent the
United States the remains of two other
American servicemen.
The mystery over what happened to
the unaccounted-for Americans in
Laos has lent credence to reports that
some are still being held prisoners
there. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer
in February quoted Sayfa
Phounsavan. a former Royal Lao air
force pilot, as saying on the basis of
refugee reports, "There are today 40
or 50 Americans, most of them pilots,
who were shot down over Laos during
the war, being held prisoner there
now."
Presumably on the basis of such re
ports, the U.S. intelligence communi
ty intensified its overhead spying on
Laos. Sources said satellite photos
showed shadows on the ground in the
Laotian camp that some interpreters
believed were too big for Asians.
Furthering this theory were pic
tures of tools which, to photo in
terpreters, looked too long for Asians
but just right tor Caucasians.
'B-52' spelled out
Also, the photos suggested that the
word B-52 had been spelled out with
bodies or logs within the camp during
one pass of a satellite or SR-71 Black
bird spy plane. One theory was that
this was a signal from desperate

American POWs imprisoned as slave
laborers in the jungle.
Other overhead pictures, sources
said, showed what looked like a guard
tower and earthen barriers to keep
people in what appeared to be a prison
compound.
However, this overhead evidence
was not conclusive enough to justify a
risky military action like the Iranian
rescue attempt. Even if there were
Caucasians in the compound, as the
photos of shadows and tools indicated,
they might be Soviet advisers there of
their own free will. Rescuing them
would be a tragicomedy.
It was this lack of hard evidence
that spawned the U.S. effort to recruit
and train a team of Asians to go-over
land from Thailand into Laos to get a
close look at the captives. Sending in
an American team would have caused
an international storm of protest if it
were detected.
The Asian mercenaries apparently
ran into difficulties shortly after they
got into Laos, causing them to delay
their mission, perhaps by picking an
alternate route. There were hints, but

no hard information, that the team be
lieved it had been detected.
The team, believed to consist of 20
to 30 men, was said to have gotten
close enough to the camp to study its
inhabitants and report back that no
Americans or any other Caucasians
were in the compound. Apparently the
mercenaries managed to take some
pictures as well, although sources
were guarded in discussing what evi
dence was brought back to Thailand.
Rear Adm. Jerry Tuttle, a deputy
director for intelligence at the Pen
tagon's Defense Intelligence Agency,
was the Washington field general tor
the secret mission into Laos, sources
said. The U.S.-sponsored foray came
after POW lamilies sought to launch
such a mission on their own.
Private plan aborted
This earlier, private plan was
aborted after the group ran out of
money. Twenty-six men, a team made
up largely of ex-special forces soldiers
and Vietnam combat veterans, as
sembled near Leesburg. in central
Florida, tor the privately financed
POW rescue mission into Laos.

cording to the Pentagon, with 295 of
them believed killed in crashes.
Of the other 265, 14 have been re
leased alive as prisoners of war
through Hanoi. Laos also has sent the
United States the remains of two other
American servicemen.
The mystery over what happened to
the unaccounted-for Americans in
Laos has lent credence to reports that
some are still being held prisoners
there. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer
in February quoted Sayfa
Phounsavan. a former Royal Lao air
force pilot, as saying on the basis of
refugee reports, "There are today 40
or 50 Americans, most of them pilots,
who were shot down over Laos during
the war, being held prisoner there
now."
Presumably on the basis of such re
ports, the U.S. intelligence communi
ty intensified its overhead spying on
Laos. Sources said satellite photos
showed shadows on the ground in the
Laotian camp that some interpreters
believed were too big for Asians.
Furthering this theory were pic
tures of tools which, to photo in
terpreters, looked too long for Asians
but just right tor Caucasians.
'B-52' spelled out
Also, the photos suggested that the
word B-52 had been spelled out with
bodies or logs within the camp during
one pass of a satellite or SR-71 Black
bird spy plane. One theory was that
this was a signal from desperate

American POWs imprisoned as slave
laborers in the jungle.
Other overhead pictures, sources
said, showed what looked like a guard
tower and earthen barriers to keep
people in what appeared to be a prison
compound.
However, this overhead evidence
was not conclusive enough to justify a
risky military action like the Iranian
rescue attempt. Even if there were
Caucasians in the compound, as the
photos of shadows and tools indicated,
they might be Soviet advisers there of
their own free will. Rescuing them
would be a tragicomedy.
It was this lack of hard evidence
that spawned the U.S. effort to recruit
and train a team of Asians to go-over
land from Thailand into Laos to get a
close look at the captives. Sending in
an American team would have caused
an international storm of protest if it
were detected.
The Asian mercenaries apparently
ran into difficulties shortly after they
got into Laos, causing them to delay
their mission, perhaps by picking an
alternate route. There were hints, but

no hard information, that the team be
lieved it had been detected.
The team, believed to consist of 20
to 30 men, was said to have gotten
close enough to the camp to study its
inhabitants and report back that no
Americans or any other Caucasians
were in the compound. Apparently the
mercenaries managed to take some
pictures as well, although sources
were guarded in discussing what evi
dence was brought back to Thailand.
Rear Adm. Jerry Tuttle, a deputy
director for intelligence at the Pen
tagon's Defense Intelligence Agency,
was the Washington field general tor
the secret mission into Laos, sources
said. The U.S.-sponsored foray came
after POW lamilies sought to launch
such a mission on their own.
Private plan aborted
This earlier, private plan was
aborted after the group ran out of
money. Twenty-six men, a team made
up largely of ex-special forces soldiers
and Vietnam combat veterans, as
sembled near Leesburg. in central
Florida, tor the privately financed
POW rescue mission into Laos.
Washington — The United States fi
nanced and helped train a secret force
of mercenaries who went into Laos
earlier this month to determine if
Americans were imprisoned in a
jungle camp there, as covert over
flights by satellites and spy planes had
suggested.
The reconnaissance force 1 eturned
a few days ago without any evidence
that Americans were in the camp,
chilling the hopes that the earlier
photographic intelligence had raised
in the minds of some Pentagon of
ficials.
The team of Asians, believed to be
Laotians, had been issued cameras to
take pictures of the camp's inhabi
tants to supplement the overhead pho
tography collected by the CIA and De
fense Intelligence Agency, sources
said.
The sources added that photo in
terpreters scrutinized all the photog
raphy last weekend and concluded
that there were no Americans in the
jungle camp.
'Special operations'
Asked about the mission. Col.
Ronald Duchin, chief of the Pentagon
news branch, said last night, "We do
not comment on any special opera
tions of this kind."
In another statement personally ap
proved by Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, the Pentagon said the fol
lowing when queried by The Washing
ton Post about efforts to rescue any
Americans still being held captive in
Southeast Asia.
"There has been a steady flow of re
ports about Americans being held
against their will in Southeast Asia
since the flow of Vietnamese from
Southeast Asia began The U.S. gov
ernment regularly, and with great
care, has and will continue to check
the validity of each of these reports.
The United States can be expected to
take appropriate action if any of these
reports proves to be true. Top priority
effort will continue to be assigned to
investigate these efforts."
The families of servicemen missing
in the Vietnam war have continued to
believe that some of their relatives
are still alive and are being held cap
tive in Southeast Asia. They have pres
sured the government repeatedly to
try to locate the men and rescue them.
The National League of Families of
American Prisoners and Missing in
Action in Southeast Asia has com
plained that the U.S. government has
failed to press hard enough to find
missing Americans.
By the Pentagon's count, there are
2528 Americans unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia, including 237 listed
as missing in action Of that total. 560
U.S. airmen went down in Laos, ac
cording to the Pentagon, with 295 of
them believed killed in crashes.
