# U.S. financed secret force sent into Laos
## Mercenaries searched for Americans rumored imprisoned in camp 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” The United States fi
nanced and helped train a secret force
of mercenaries who went into Laos
earlier this month to determine if
Americans were imprisoned in a
jungle camp there, as covert over
flights by satellites and spy planes had
suggested.
The reconnaissance force 1 eturned
a few days ago without any evidence
that Americans were in the camp,
chilling the hopes that the earlier
photographic intelligence had raised
in the minds of some Pentagon of
ficials.
The team of Asians, believed to be
Laotians, had been issued cameras to
take pictures of the camp's inhabi
tants to supplement the overhead pho
tography collected by the CIA and De
fense Intelligence Agency, sources
said.
The sources added that photo in
terpreters scrutinized all the photog
raphy last weekend and concluded
that there were no Americans in the
jungle camp.
'Special operations'
Asked about the mission. Col.
Ronald Duchin, chief of the Pentagon
news branch, said last night, "We do
not comment on any special opera
tions of this kind."
In another statement personally ap
proved by Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, the Pentagon said the fol
lowing when queried by The Washing
ton Post about efforts to rescue any
Americans still being held captive in
Southeast Asia.
"There has been a steady flow of re
ports about Americans being held
against their will in Southeast Asia
since the flow of Vietnamese from
Southeast Asia began The U.S. gov
ernment regularly, and with great
care, has and will continue to check
the validity of each of these reports.
The United States can be expected to
take appropriate action if any of these
reports proves to be true. Top priority
effort will continue to be assigned to
investigate these efforts."
The families of servicemen missing
in the Vietnam war have continued to
believe that some of their relatives
are still alive and are being held cap
tive in Southeast Asia. They have pres
sured the government repeatedly to
try to locate the men and rescue them.
The National League of Families of
American Prisoners and Missing in
Action in Southeast Asia has com
plained that the U.S. government has
failed to press hard enough to find
missing Americans.
By the Pentagon's count, there are
2528 Americans unaccounted for in
