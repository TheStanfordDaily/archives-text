# Retired Hoover fellow railed back
## Mid-East admires diplomat Habib 
### Washington Post 
Beirut, Lebanon — A Lebanese
newspaper columnist paid presiden
tial troubleshooter Philip Habib a
compliment yesterday by suggesting
he should become a permanent part of
the peacekeeping machinery in the
Middle East like various U.N. opera
tions established over the decades.
Such barbed praise for a man who a
little more than two weeks ago was
playing golf in retirement in Belmont.
Calif., reflects the many seeming od
dities that have made Habib some
thing out of the ordinary throughout
his long career.

News analysis

A 30-year diplomat with the State
Department, Habib was a senior re
search tellow at the Hoover Institute
at Stanford from November 980 until
his appointment earlier this month
He also served as a diplomat-in-resi
dence at the Hoover in 1978-79, after
his position as Undersecretary of
State for Political Affairs, the third
highest position at the State Depart
ment.
(The diplomat-in-residence is part
of a federally funded program to keep
the intellectual community in direct
touch with Washington )
Born the son of a Lebanese immi
grant grocer in Brooklyn 61 years ago,
Habib has combined the Levantine
ease of approach and warmth that
have pleased Arab and Israeli in
terlocutors alike with a traditional
diplomatic horror of publicity.
Yet the shrewd Middle Easterners
watching Habib at work also thought
they saw the revenge of a career

diplomat recalled to service when a
fledgling Reagan administration
stumbled into a major world crisis.
Suddenly called back to service, like
a John Le Carre character, Habib was
involved in damage control, trying to
prevent serious Soviet inroads in the
Mideast from which the adminis
tration had trumpeted its desire to ban
Moscow's remaining influence.
Arab and Israeli politicians and
diplomats wondered admiringly a»
Habib's modus operandi, which mixes
direct contact with Secretary of State
Alexander Haig and the kind of leeway
few Foreign Service officers of any
nation have been allowed since the in
vention of high-speed communica
tions.
"Habib gives you the impression
that he's operating on his own, feeling
his way. almost groping," a Lebanese
source said, "as if he is getting no sol
id guidance from Washington because
the Reagan administration has no
clear Mideast policy as yet."
"His approach is non-structured
and there's none of the obvious State
Department orders: 'Explain points 1.
2. 3, 4, and do not proceed to point 5 un
til you have covered sub clauses a, b,
c, d," he added
Habib s first order of meaningful
business in the missile crisis was to re
establish American influence in Syria,
which has been reduced to the point of
near-no-return by Haig's failure to in
clude Damascus on his Mideast famil
iarization trip last month and what
Syria perceived as other Reagan ad
ministration snubs.
If nothing else, the crisis has proved
that Syria cannot be ignored in any
Mideast peace negotiations. As Presi
dent Hafez Assad — who is not known
to praise diplomats, especially Ameri
can diplomats, in public — said yester
day: Habib "is making efforts for

which he is to be thanked" and the Syr
ian leader has jokingly invited him to
come back to Syria as a tourist.
The charm of this short, squat, bald
ing man has worked its magic on Is
raelis, too.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin
Tuesday night said, "I want to express
our deep gratitude to my friend. Mr.
Philip Habib. for his immense ... ef
forts. intellectually, physically, mor
ally invested in his efforts to bring
about a peaceful solution in the
crisis."
Hannon Bar-on, head of the Israeli
Foreign Ministry's North American
section, articulated impressions
shared by other Israelis and Lebanese
interlocutors as well.
"Phil is a very lovable man. I ad
mire him. He's very gregarious, but
on the other hand very discreet," Bar
on said. "He has a vast sense of hu
mor, a storehouse of stories to tell.
He's very outgoing, but very guarded.
He keeps his own counsel and only
talks at great length about things he
wants you to know. He is very inven
tive in his own thinking. He will try to
secure his flanks as much as he can.
but he doesn't show that he's doing
that."
Bar-on said. "Habib moves from
one issue to another and back again
and does not teel uncomfortable it all
the ends are not neatly tucked in one
by one .... He pulls cards out and
takes them back again."
Inevitably, both Arabs and Israelis
have compared him to his former
boss, former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, who described Habib as
"the antithesis of the public stere
otype of the elegant, excessively gen
teel foreign service officer . . rough,
blunt, direct, as tar from the striped
pants image as it is possible to be. "
