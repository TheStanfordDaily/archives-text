## Italians reject gun, abortion referendums

From the Daily wire services
Rome — The 2-1 vote in favor
of Italy's liberal abortion law
showed Italians believe church
and state should be separate,
newspapers here said Tuesday.
* The vote marked a serious po
litical defeat for the Roman
Catholic Church as well as for
Pope John Paul 11, who had
played an active part in the
campaign to change the law
,t>eiore he was shot in an as
sassination attempt last week.
But the Church said it would not
be moved from its position by
the results of the referendum.
Vatican Radio condemned the
result of the vote, which took
place Sunday and Monday in this
97 percent Catholic country.
Tolerance and reason
"The results show the secu
larization ot Italy. The values of
tolerance and of reason pre
vailed." the Milan daily Cnr
tfere ciella Sera. Italy's largest
circulation newspaper, said in a
front-page editorial.
"The news of the referendum
results has probably caused
greater pain to the Holy Father
than the bullets that struck him
(in last Wednesday's assassina
tion attempt)," the pro-Com
munist Rome daily Paese Sera
said.
Italians also voted to reject
changes in three other laws re
lated to the issue ot law and or
der, including a current law that
allows citizens to carry weap
ons if they are licensed.
In all, there were tive issues
on the referendum ballots de
cided in the voting Sunday and
Monday. The two that dealt with
changes in the 1978 abortion law
were both rejected.
• The measure, for which the
pope personally had cam
paigned. was backed by the Ro
man Catholic Church and the
Pro Life Movement in Italy.The
results of the latest vote were
21.5 million in favor of keeping
the abortion law to 10.2 million
against, or 67.9 percent to 32.1
The measure would have lim
ited abortions to cases in which
the life of the pregnant woman
was at stake.
Restrictions
The second referendum issue,
which would have dropped most
ot restrictions that now control
legal abortions, also was de

feated.
Italy's abortion law has been
detended by Aldo Aniasi. the so
cial minister ot health, who said
it had been effective in limiting
the clandestine abortions that
previously were common in Ita
ly
There have been 410,00) abor
tions since the new law went
into etfect, and during that peri
od the mortality rate related to
maternity has declined trom 1.6
to .9 per 00.')00 births. The rate
of abortions has been increasing
and now is estimated at a ratio
of 285 for every .00") live births.
Italian law limits most legal
abortions to the first 90 days af-

ter conception. Applicants are
asked to wait a week at ter tirst
seeking an abortion, unless
there is a critical emergency.
Abortions are permitted after
the first 90 days only it the moth
er's health is in danger or it
there is the possibility of physi
cal or psychological problems,
including special provisions in
the event of a defective embryo.
Life-saving limit
The church-sponsored meas
ure sought to limit abortions to
cases where the mother's life
was at stake. The church also
had sought another referendum
that would have barred all abor
tions. but a court rejected this
as in conflict with an earlier fin
ding that theraputic abortions
are in conformity with the Ital

ian constitution.
Italian women's organiza
tions had led the campaign to
preserve the abortion law They
also had the support of all the
political parties except the
Christian Democrats, the ruling
party ot Italy, and the MSI. an
extreme right-wing party.
The most important referen
dum victory for law-enforce
ment agencies was a decision by
the voters to reject efforts to
terminate special anti-terrorist
legislation adopted in 1979. The
legislation provided broader po
lice powers, including preven
tive custody, and tougher sen
tences tor terrorists.

A move to do away with the
penalty of life imprisonment
also was being rejected. Italy
abolished the death penalty in
1944, but the neo-fascist MSI has
been trying to stir interest in re
storing it and collected more
than 1 million signatures on
petitions.
The life sentence was pro
vided in 1944 to replace the
death penalty in such extreme
crimes as premeditated
murder, but there are pro
visions for conditional release
from prison after 28 years for
those under life sentence.
The move to terminate these
provisions was defeated 77.4
percent to 22.6 percent.
Italy's gun control law was

Lett in places as voters, by a
margin of 86 4 percent to 3.6
percent, were rejecting a move
that would have ended the right
to carry weapons
There are no restrictions in
Italy on having arms in one's
home, but those carrying guns
outside the home must have a
license. The most recent fire
arms census shows that more
than 5 million weapons, most of
them rifles, are licensed in a
population of 57 million people.
One complication with the
■ referendum is that it would have
jeopardized the use of arms by
private security organizations.

The ballot marked the second
time in seven years that Italian
voters overwhelmingly re
buffed a church-backed pro
posal to overturn a law passed
by Parliament. In May '974,
Italians voted 60-40 to keep
divorce.
Italy has had four referendum
campaigns since World War 11.
The first was in 946 on whether
to continue to monarchy. There
have been three since a law was
adopted in 1970 allowing refer
endums by petition.
The turnout in the referen
dum Sunday and Monday was 79
percent of the eligible voters,
lowest in the three recent refer
endums and in contrast with an
88 percent turnout in the divorce
referendum in 1974.

Supporters of the "NCf vote in the Itanian referendums display the news on the vote to keep a liberal
abortion law in Rome Tuesday. Italians voted 2-1 to keep the present law, despite the bill backed by
Pope John Paul 11. (By even larger margins, the voters turned down four other proposals.)
