# Soviets transform Afghanistan
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi. India — Soviet authorities are mak
ing fundamental changes in Afghanistan, changes
aimed at transforming the country into a per
manent client state.
Many observers think these changes are a
greater threat to Afghanistan's long-term pros
pects of regaining independence than the pres
ence of the Soviet troops.
Because so tew Westerners are permitted into
Afghanistan, it is difficult to assess accurately the
pace and depth ot this process. But, judging from
official government pronouncements and in
formation provided by people who have fled the
country in recent months, rapid and complete
"Sovietization" appears to be a fundamental ob
jective of the invaders.
Predictably, one of the first targets was the Af
ghan political structure, which is now said to be
virtually a mirror image of the Soviet model.
According to Rejendra Sareen, a respected re
gional specialist who recently returned to India
from Kabul, the Afghan capital, the Revolu
tionary Council ot Afghanistan's ruling People's
Democratic Party is modeled after the Supreme
Soviet, and the Afghan Council ot Ministers, the
Presidium, party Central Committee and Polit
buro are nearly identical to their Soviet coun
terparts.
Party and state bureaucracies alike have taken
on the Soviet form, Sareen said, as are organiza
tions such as the Democratic Organization ot Af
ghan Youth and the Kabul Pioneers. One of the
greatest Soviet efforts, he said, seems to be in
youth development, an area that Moscow clearly
recognizes as essential to reshaping the attitudes
of Afghanistan's next generation.
During the past 18 months, large numbers of
educated Afghan young people, mainly males in
their late teens or early 20s, have been sent to the
Soviet Union tor advanced education. According
to political analysts familiar with the program,
most have gone to schools in the Central Asian re
publics.
"In three to four years they'll start coming
back and then the investment will begin to pay
off," Sareen said. "They will become the hard
core ot young people that the (People's Demo
cratic Party) presently lacks."
At Afghan schools the curricula are being al
tered to tit the Soviet mold. Fundamental changes
in primary and secondary education announced
last autumn will require three years to complete,
but the first four grades were reorganized this
spring.
According to teachers who have left Kabul in
recent months, the goal is to instill Marxist values
trom the beginning of a student's educational ex
perience.
A former teacher of 7- and 8-year-olds at
Kabul's Malalay primary school said that instead
ot local history, she had to teach her children
about student-worker-peasant solidarity.
To ensure that the revolutionary message is
taught with proper enthusiasm, the government
reportedly gave teachers an ultimatum last Feb
ruary: Join the party or be dismissed.
A number ot teachers chose to tlee the country
rather than comply.
At Kabul University, engineering and medical
students have protested changes in their course
structure, which now includes such requirements
as "Theory of the Working Class."
According to recently arrived refugees, at
tempts last month to bring in Russians to lecture

in the Medical School triggered violence and even
tual government retreat on the issue
But education is only one area where Soviet
ization is in progress. Technical assistance, which
prior to the Soviet invasion in December 1979
came chiefly from the West, now comes increas
ingly from the Soviet Union and other East Block
countries.
According to a diplomat, a Kabul medical re
searcher whose laboratory was built mainly with
American and Japanese equipment, said that he
was told that any future needs would have to be
met from the Soviet Union.
In fact, the government announced last month
that there would soon be an agreement integrat
ing Afghan health institutes with those in the
neighboring Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan
Protocols for the Soviets to operate power sta
tions and irrigation projects, to build roads, ex
pand airports and supervise planning are an
nounced with regularity over Radio Kabul.
Former Afghan government officials living
here report that Soviet advisers have settled into
key positions in the central government, and al
though they tend to remain in the background, lit
tle is done without their approval.
Even the shrinking number of projects financed
by the United Nations and other international
agencies have been brought into the Soviet
purview by forcing out experts from Western
countries.
"When your contract is up, the government just
says it doesn't want to keep you on," one departed
Westerner said.
Within a year of the Soviet invasion, the number
of these international aid experts from non-Com
munist countries dwindled from about 20 to 3.
East Bloc countries, especially East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria in addition to the So
viet Union, have taken up the slack.
The Afghans' view of the outside world is now
shaped almost exclusively by the Soviet press.
Foreign news printed in Kabul newspapers is usu
ally provided either by Tass, the Soviet News
Agency, or some other East Bloc agency.
A recent issue of the English-language Kabul
New Times carried three lengthy political com
mentaries written by men named Borisov, Boikov
and Semyonov. The issue was said to be typical.
Even news of Afghanistan often comes from the
Soviet Union. According to British Broadcasting
Corp monitors, about 60 percent of Radio Kabul's
broadcasts are beamed from transmitters in the
Soviet Union.
Afghanistan's main economic lifeline, through
the Khyber Pass to South Asia, has been sup
planted by the Salang Pass leading to Soviet
Tadzhikistan. A major construction project
widening the Salang Pass highway symbolizes the
new Soviet ties.
Under a series of comprehensive trade agree
ments signed in the past six months, large quan
tities of Soviet consumer goods — motor vehicles,
foodstuffs,fertilizer's will flow into Afghanistan.
Even Afghanistan's electric power distribution
grid will be tied into the Soviet grid under the
agreement.
The Soviets appear to be taking special care to
exposq the Afghan leaders to socialist "suc
cesses" elsewhere. At one point this month
diplomats noted that eight top Afghan leaders, in
cluding both deputy prime ministers, were out of
the country on visits to the Soviet Union, the East
Bloc nations and Cuba.

According to teachers who have left Kabul in

A former teacher of 7- and 8-year-olds at
Kabul's Malalay primary school said that instead
ot local history, she had to teach her children
about student-worker-peasant solidarity.
To ensure that the revolutionary message is
taught with proper enthusiasm, the government
reportedly gave teachers an ultimatum last Feb

A number ot teachers chose to tlee the country
rather than comply.
At Kabul University, engineering and medical
students have protested changes in their course

But education is only one area where Soviet

prior to the Soviet invasion in December 1979
came chiefly from the West, now comes increas

According to a diplomat, a Kabul medical re

American and Japanese equipment, said that he

Even the shrinking number of projects financed

Within a year of the Soviet invasion, the number
of these international aid experts from non-Com

East Bloc countries, especially East Germany,

A recent issue of the English-language Kabul
New Times carried three lengthy political com

and Semyonov. The issue was said to be typical.
Even news of Afghanistan often comes from the
Soviet Union. According to British Broadcasting
Corp monitors, about 60 percent of Radio Kabul's
broadcasts are beamed from transmitters in the
Soviet Union.
Afghanistan's main economic lifeline, through
the Khyber Pass to South Asia, has been sup

Under a series of comprehensive trade agree

agreement.
The Soviets appear to be taking special care to
exposq the Afghan leaders to socialist "suc

diplomats noted that eight top Afghan leaders, in

New Delhi. India — Soviet authorities are mak
ing fundamental changes in Afghanistan, changes
aimed at transforming the country into a per
manent client state.
Many observers think these changes are a
greater threat to Afghanistan's long-term pros
pects of regaining independence than the pres
ence of the Soviet troops.
Because so tew Westerners are permitted into
Afghanistan, it is difficult to assess accurately the
pace and depth ot this process. But, judging from
official government pronouncements and in
formation provided by people who have fled the
country in recent months, rapid and complete
"Sovietization" appears to be a fundamental ob
jective of the invaders.
Predictably, one of the first targets was the Af

According to Rejendra Sareen, a respected re

Democratic Party is modeled after the Supreme
Soviet, and the Afghan Council ot Ministers, the
Presidium, party Central Committee and Polit
buro are nearly identical to their Soviet coun
terparts.
Party and state bureaucracies alike have taken
on the Soviet form, Sareen said, as are organiza

ghan Youth and the Kabul Pioneers. One of the
greatest Soviet efforts, he said, seems to be in
youth development, an area that Moscow clearly
recognizes as essential to reshaping the attitudes
of Afghanistan's next generation.
During the past 18 months, large numbers of
educated Afghan young people, mainly males in
their late teens or early 20s, have been sent to the
