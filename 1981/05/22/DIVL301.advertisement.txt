Class List Sign-Up

There will not be Advance Registration in Spring Quarter
for Autumn Quarter 1981-82. Instead there will be a Class
List Sign-Up for current students to sign class lists for those
courses requiring it. Courses will be listed on Autumn Prog
ram Cards that will be available at the "Autumn Program
Cards" window in the lobby of the Old Union beginning
May 26. Signing of the Class Lists wil begin May 26 accord
ing to the schedule in the Time Schedule (available at the
- Information window in the lobby of the Old Union.)
Each student should bring his or her ID to get a Program
Card. No advisors' signatures will be required on the Au
tumn Program Cards and only courses that require signing
class lists should be shown. Students who do not need to
sign class lists should not fill out and turn in Autumn Program
Cards. The last day to pick up Program Cards is June 2 but
Class Lists can be signed through June 3. The cards should
be turned in at the Class List windows by June 3 and will be
available for students to pick up at Maples Pavilion on regist
ration days or the Registrar's Credentials Window after that.
