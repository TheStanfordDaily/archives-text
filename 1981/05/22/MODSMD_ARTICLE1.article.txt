# Kennedy pleads research aid

### 
Corporate support of basic research
in the nation's universities must be
spurred by tax incentives, University
President Donald Kennedy told the
Senate Finance Committee yesterday
in Washington, D C.
Speaking before the committee on
behalt of the Association of American
Universities and the National Associa
tion ot State Universities and Land
Grant Colleges, Kennedy supported
the Research Revitalization Act of
98 (S. 692).
The bill would allow business to re
ceive a large tax credit on money de
posited in a reserve fund for univer
sity research.
The National Science Foundation
(NSF) estimates that industry last
year provided only 3.5 percent of total
support for university research and
development, a total of $210 million.
'Enormous potential for gain'
Kennedy, former commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration,
said "there is enormous potential for
gain from efforts to establish closer
links between the research capacity of
universities and the neglected needs
of industry for basic research."
The rapidly emerging fields of mi
croelectronics and biotechnology
"represent especially fertile ground
for industry-university cooperation,"
Kennedy said. Besides stimulating

basic research and technology
transfer, such cooperation can "help
train highly qualified scientists and
engineers experienced in working
with industry.
"As our national attention is fixed
on the extraordinary difficulty ot par
ing back government expenditures,
one frequently hears it asserted that
the private sector can be expected to
accomplish those things from which
the government now proposes tf)
withdraw," Kennedy said
New incentives needed
Kennedy said private sector support
will require new incentives, noting "I
simply do not believe that significant
sources of funds exist in the private
sector that we are not now tapping."
The proposed legislation would per
mit business to receive a 25 percent
tax credit on funds deposited in a spe
cial reserve that could be used only to
pay for "qualified research expenses''
tor research conducted at an institu
tion of higher education.
Funds may remain in the reserve
tor up to four years, allowing industry
to accumulate funds to permit more
flexibility in amounts spent on a given
project, Kennedy noted. When funds
are properly spent from the reserve, a
standard business deduction — cur
rently available under law — is al
lowed. However, failure to spend the

funds within four years, or misuse of
the reserves, would be heavily penal
ized
In other remarks, Kennedy dis
cussed differences between the wants
and needs of universities and industry.
•'Universities have traditionally
worked on basic research at the fron
tiers of knowledge and they have been
vigilant to preserve the openness of in
quiry and the independence of facul
ties.
Industry, on the other hand, may
want more immediate results than
can normally be expected from basic
research, and they are accustomed to
secrecy in the handling of proprietary
information," he said.
Private funding at Stanford
Nevertheless. Kennedy said that
satisfactory arrangements had been
worked out at Stanford and other ma
jor research universities. He noted the
University's Center tor Integrated
Systems (CIS), which joins electrical
engineers, computer scientists and
others from other fields working with
high speed integrated circuitry.
A group of companies supported the
Center by entering into a cooperative
research relationship, and the group
has provided over $7.5 million toward
a new research facility. Tax incen
tives, Kennedy noted, could increase
support for CIS research.
In addition, the president noted an
other example of the combined forces
of education and private industry —
the Stanford Synchrotron Laboratory,
which puts together some 500 re
searchers trom the nation's univer
sities and corporations.
Work done at the laboratory has led
to production of powerful X-rays for
studying the makeup and electronic
state of materials. Quite possibly, this
work can be applied to a wide variety
of studies — on human arteries, min
iaturization of electronic circuits, and
on the nature of catalysts used in
petrochemical processes.

The National Science Foundation
(NSF) estimates that industry last
year provided only 3.5 percent of total
support for university research and
development, a total of $210 million.
'Enormous potential for gain'
Kennedy, former commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration,
said "there is enormous potential for
gain from efforts to establish closer
links between the research capacity of
universities and the neglected needs
of industry for basic research."
The rapidly emerging fields of mi
croelectronics and biotechnology
"represent especially fertile ground
for industry-university cooperation,"
Kennedy said. Besides stimulating

basic research and technology
transfer, such cooperation can "help
train highly qualified scientists and
engineers experienced in working
with industry.
"As our national attention is fixed
on the extraordinary difficulty ot par
ing back government expenditures,
one frequently hears it asserted that
the private sector can be expected to
accomplish those things from which
the government now proposes tf)
withdraw," Kennedy said
New incentives needed
Kennedy said private sector support
will require new incentives, noting "I
simply do not believe that significant
sources of funds exist in the private
sector that we are not now tapping."
The proposed legislation would per
mit business to receive a 25 percent
tax credit on funds deposited in a spe
cial reserve that could be used only to
pay for "qualified research expenses''
tor research conducted at an institu
tion of higher education.
Funds may remain in the reserve
tor up to four years, allowing industry
to accumulate funds to permit more
flexibility in amounts spent on a given
project, Kennedy noted. When funds
are properly spent from the reserve, a
standard business deduction — cur
rently available under law — is al
lowed. However, failure to spend the

funds within four years, or misuse of
the reserves, would be heavily penal
ized
In other remarks, Kennedy dis
cussed differences between the wants
and needs of universities and industry.
•'Universities have traditionally
worked on basic research at the fron
tiers of knowledge and they have been
vigilant to preserve the openness of in
quiry and the independence of facul
ties.
Industry, on the other hand, may
want more immediate results than
can normally be expected from basic
research, and they are accustomed to
secrecy in the handling of proprietary
information," he said.
Private funding at Stanford
Nevertheless. Kennedy said that
satisfactory arrangements had been
worked out at Stanford and other ma
jor research universities. He noted the
University's Center tor Integrated
Systems (CIS), which joins electrical
engineers, computer scientists and
others from other fields working with
high speed integrated circuitry.
A group of companies supported the
Center by entering into a cooperative
research relationship, and the group
has provided over $7.5 million toward
a new research facility. Tax incen
tives, Kennedy noted, could increase
support for CIS research.
In addition, the president noted an
other example of the combined forces
of education and private industry —
the Stanford Synchrotron Laboratory,
which puts together some 500 re
searchers trom the nation's univer
sities and corporations.
Work done at the laboratory has led
to production of powerful X-rays for
studying the makeup and electronic
state of materials. Quite possibly, this
work can be applied to a wide variety
of studies — on human arteries, min
iaturization of electronic circuits, and
on the nature of catalysts used in
petrochemical processes.
