When asked by graduate film
students how he broke into the
movie industry, Colin Higgins,
winter-director of Foul Play,
.\fyne to Five,' Humid and
.\\aude and Stanford alumnus,
grinned sheepishly and replied.
"Well, you really don't want to
judge from my example."
When pressed, he admitted
that, having arrived in Los An
geles with very little money to
start graduate work at UCLA's
film school, he applied for a job
offering a tree room in ex
change for chatfeuring and pool
cleaning duties. He got the job,
and his employer turned out to
be Eddie Lewis, producer ot
such films as Spartacus, (Wan
I'rix and others. So when Hig
gins wrote Harold and Maude
as his thesis for UCLA, there
was no problem. He gave the
script to Lewis who sold it to
Paramount Studios over a week
end.
As a Stanford student from
1959 to 1965, he didn't follow con
ventional ground rules, either.
Admitted with a scholarship, he
lost it in the first year. Things
didn't improve, and realizing
that he was flunking out ot
school, Higgins joined the Army
in the hope that he would get
posted to Europe.
After attending the Fort

Slocum School of Journalism at
the Army's expense, he was sent
to Europe where he worked on
the Armed Forces newspaper
The Stars and Stripes.
Upon his discharge three
years later, Higgins decided to
complete his Stanford educa
tion. The first step, he decided,
was to fulfill the Stanford for
eign language requirement,
whicty he did by spending the
next'six months at the Sorbonne
in Paris.
When he finally returned to
Stanford, his career goal was
more settled. He majored in
creative writing and won sever
al awards, including an award
tor the best undergraduate short
story. He then went on to UCLA,
and the rest is history.
Well, not quite. Harold and
Maude, although popular today,
was a big flop at the box office
when it came out. Any hopes
Higgins might have had of
breaking painlessly into the Hol
lywood scene quickly died with
the picture.
Being an unemployed screen
writer in Hollywood was no easy
task, so Higgins returned to
Paris, where he collaborated
with Peter Brooks on a play
called The Ik, an adaptation of
the book The Mountain People,
by anthropologist Colin Turn
bull.

Returning to Hollywood, Hig
gins took on what he refers to as
bread and butter jobs, like writ
ing the script tor Devil's Daugh
ter. now a late night TV thriller,
before writing and selling Silrer
Strrah to Twentieth Century
Fox
For a while, he said, he
thought horror stories were the
way to go. With this in mind, he
searched his memory for the
best horror story he'd ever read,
and finally settled on
Shakespeare's Titus An
droriivus.
Unfortunately, he got so
caught up in the writing that
what he eventually submitted
"was probably the only script in
Elizabethan blank verse that
Roger Korman ever received."
Higgins is currently working
on an adaptation of the play,
The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas for the screen. Actually,
the script is already written but
he faces the problem ot not
being able to make any changes
at this point, since he is current
ly on strike as a member of the
Writers Guild.
Higgins spoke at the Univer
sity Monday at the invitation of
Julian Blaustein of the Com
munication Department and
John L'Heureux of the
English Department. Higgins

said that he was glad to have
been given this opportunity,
since he remembers being ver>
impressed and grateful when
Delmer Davis came to lecture
when he was a student here
In addition to lecturing to a
film class and a creative writing
class. Higgins gave a question
and answer session entitled
"Loose Talk." that was open to
the general public.
He was questioned about the
recent controversy over his
movie l-'oul I'lay. which had
been slated to air last week on
NBC. but was pulled at the hist
minute because of the rral as
sassination attempt on the
Pope
"You know, real life has a
tendency to reflect fiction,
said. "When I used the Pope as
the butt of an assassination at
tempt in Foul Play, I thought
that that was about as ridiculous
as you could get . . I mean the
whole idea of the Pope watching
a performance of the Mikado in
San Francisco is really
bizarre."
In a final analysis of his ca
reer, Higgings told his audience
that "What I like doing best is
entertaining large numbers of
people and making them
laugh." If his films are anything
to judge by. he's certainly suc
ceeded.
