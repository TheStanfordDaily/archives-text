# Japanese art featured on noon tour
## 
### Diane Johnson 
Rather than indulging in
the usual dining hall lunch,
why net "sack it"and en
gage in a noon tour of the
Japanese prints at the Stan
ford Art Museum? The col
lection, entitled "Images of
Foreigners" depicts Japan's
impression ot the exotic for
eigners during the 16th
through 19th centuries.
With luck, the tour guide
will turn out to be the curator
himself. Patrick Maveety,
who led the tour Wednesday.
"The prints displayed in
the collection are not great
works ot art," Mareety
began. "Their interest lies in
their historical back
ground."
In the f2th century, Japan
chose a policy ot isolation
and cut itself off from vir
tually. all foreign contact,
Maveety'said. In i542, Japan
linally came into contact
with Western culture
through three Portuguese
who were shipwrecked on a
nearby island. These exotic
foreigners were warmly re
ceived and trading expedi
tions followed, he said.
According to Maveety,
this early Japanese tascina

tion with Europeans inspired
a type of art featuring the
foreigners as subject mat
ter. But near the end of the
(6th century, the Japanese
realized the political danger
of Westerners and expelled
all foreigners.
In 1640, the tew Chinese
and Dutch traders remaining
were confined to a tiny
artificial island in Nagasaki
harbor. For over 200 years,

''The prints displayed in the collection are
not great works of art. . . their interest lies
in the historical background.'
â€” Patrick Maveety,
curator of the Stanford Art Museum

the island was Japan's only
channel ot communication
with the outside world.
Maveety said that many of
the early prints in the exhibit
were influenced by the Eu
ropean paintings, prints, and
book illustrations available
at Nagasaki.
Maveety described the
Nagasaki prints as "appeal
ing tor their directness and

exotic tascination." He said
they remained marketable
until the arrival ot Com
modore Perry in 1853.
A special feature ot the
collection includes a
Japanese handscroll depict
ing the arrival of the Perry
expedition, along with Amer
ican books belonging to a
direct descendant of Perry
who currently lives in Palo
Alto.

As a result of Perry's ex
pedition, diplomatic rela
tions were established be
tween U.S. and Japan,
Maveety said, and Japan was
opened to foreign trade. Yo
kohama, a small fishing vil
lage, was designated as this
trade center. The Yokohama
prints comprise the last half
of the exhibit and like the
Nagasaki prints, they are im

portant historically, not tor
their artistic merit, he said.
When the market for these
prints began to drop,
Japanese artists thought up
new ideas to revive the dying
market. Instead of simply
featuring strange figures,
they began to picture foreign
countries as well, he said. An
amusing print ot 19th century
America with hot air
balloons and magnanimous
carriages adds a unique
touch to the collection.
The tour concluded with a
unique 30-foot handscroll of
Ainu salmon-fishing and a
large print ot an American
steamship. When asked why
the people on the lower deck
ot the ship looked so somber,
while those on the upper deck
looked exhilarated, Maveety
replied, "Maybe that's
where the bar is!"
The Japanese exhibit will
continue to run from May 5
through June 14, and tours
will be given bi-weekly: Sun
days at 2 p.m. and Thursdays
at 12:15 p.m. The museum is
currently offering noon tours
on "Masters ot Photogra
phy" as well.
