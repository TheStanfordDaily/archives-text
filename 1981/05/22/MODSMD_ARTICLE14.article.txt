# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Bob Pahre A 						man 'overbored' here? 
### 
I have heard a lot of people complain recently
that life at Stanford is boring Obviously, these
people must be thinking of some place other than
the Stanford I know. Each day of our lives here are
chock-full ot excitement. Don't believe me?
Okay, I'll show you: I'll trace a typical day in the
life of Joe Stanford to show you the thrills abound
ing at every turn here.
It is Monday, Joe Stanford's favorite day of the
week. At 6:45 a.m. Joe's alarm goes oft, and the
first critical moment of decision in Joe's day is
suddenly thrust upon him: should he get up right
now, turn oft the alarm and blow oft his 8 o'clock
class, or hit the snooze alarm and postpone the de
cision a tatetul nine minutes? Despite the early
hour, Joe knows instantly what he must do: he hits
the snooze alarm. Nine minutes later the alarm
goes off again, and once again Joe must make a
decision. He gets up. •
As he walks down the hall to the shower Joe
wonders how many people will be up and taking
this morning. He guesses that two will.
But alas! As Joe enters the bathroom and looks
to the showers, he sees not two. but three people
taking a shower! Although stunned by this unex
pected development. Joe is able to pull himself to
gether somehow, and he. too. takes a shower.
Some time afterward, Joe goes down to break
tast. As he goes outside on his way to Food Ser
vice. he looks to the street, hoping with all his
might that the Daily has been delivered already
on this tine morning. Oh. joy unparalleled — it
has! He dashes over to the stack of papers on the
wet lawn, rips the string off of a bundle, and tri
umphantly wrenches a Daily trom the pile. Un
able to hold back his glee, he runs to breakfast.
Today's breakfast is fruit, cereal, eggs, English
muffins, and/or juice, like every other Food Ser
vice breakfast — and here I bow to those who call
Stanford boring. However, this breakfast is able
to excite Joe since today's eggs are neither boiled
eggs nor fried eggs, but scrambled eggs —
favorite! He can hear his heart pounding as he
says, "Eggs, please," to the hasher.
With his eggs on his tray. Joe finds a place to sit
and he pulls out his Daily. Like any ( Stanfordian
who doesn't want to go through lite clueless, he
turns tirst the Opinions Page, where one can find
the wisdom of ages waiting to be discovered.
Today's columns are on the earth-shaking sub
jects ot: meaningless dinner-table conversations
at Stanford, the similarities between Vice Presi
dent George Bush and Prince Charles, and the ap
plication of the free market system to the Stan
ford library system. Joe is so deeply entranced by
these columns that he loses track of the time until
the clock strikes eight and reminds him of the
lateness ot the hour.
"Yikes 1 " he yells, or less kind words to that ef
fect. "I have a class right now!" With that. Joe

runs outside, unlocks his bike, and pedals oft to his
8 o'clock class, dodging sprinklers gone berserk,
bollards, and pedestrians with the graceful ti
nesse only a Stanford bicyclist possesses. "Ah.
the excitement of biking at Stanford!" he tells
himselt.
Joe reaches the Quad in record time, locks his
bike, runs to class, and sits down panting. He gets
a pen and notebook out of his rucksack and begins
to transcribe the revelations being uttered by the
honored seer lecturing in tront ot him. He is tilled
with the profound sense of satisfaction that comes
with the exploration ot yet another field of in
quiry.
After the lecture is over, our mentally-enriched
hero bikes off to his next class, where he will
further increase both his stores of knowledge and
his ability to understand the world around him.
After this, he checks his mailbox and finds, to his
surprise, a letter! He opens it and learns that he
may have already won $100,030 in a sweepstakes
he hasn't even entered yet! Thrilled by this pros
pect, he tills out the enclosed form and mails it.
"Wow!" he thinks. "$100,000" He bikes off to his
next class.
After emerging from his last class of the morn
ing intellectually stimulated. Joe goes to lunch.
More excitement is in store for him as he chooses
his main course. "Funny that it is moving like
that, though." Nevertheless, he makes the fateful
decision to eat the lasagna. He goes into the dining
room and sits down with two friends.
"What did you get for problem 3(g) on the
Chem. test?" one of his triends asks the other.
"232. 4 milligrams," replies the other. "But I
wasn't sure. How bout you?" Engrossed by this
sudden twist in the conversation, Joe leans tor
ward, listening intently.
"Same thing." He pushes himself away trom
the table. "Well, I hate to eat and run. but I've got
a paper due tomorrow I haven't started yet."
"Yeah, so do I," says the other. They both put
their trays away. 'Later."
With this, it is time for us to leave Joe Stanford.
We must leave out in the interests of space, un
fortunately, his throes of passion as he begins this
week's reading assignments, his momentarily in
terrupted heartbeat when his phone rings later in
the afternoon (wrong number), the surprises of
tonight's dinner-soup, or the pleasurable sense of
enlightenment he receives when he hears John
Anderson speak in Kresge tonight (remember, to
day is a Monday). Although we have seen his life
from only slumber to lunch, we must have felt the
sense ot adventure permeating every part of Joe's
morning. Yet, here at Stanford, we have nothing
to bore us but boredom itself!

eggs nor fried eggs, but scrambled eggs —
favorite! He can hear his heart pounding as he
says, "Eggs, please," to the hasher.
With his eggs on his tray. Joe finds a place to sit
and he pulls out his Daily. Like any ( Stanfordian
who doesn't want to go through lite clueless, he
turns tirst the Opinions Page, where one can find
the wisdom of ages waiting to be discovered.
Today's columns are on the earth-shaking sub
jects ot: meaningless dinner-table conversations
at Stanford, the similarities between Vice Presi
dent George Bush and Prince Charles, and the ap
plication of the free market system to the Stan
ford library system. Joe is so deeply entranced by
these columns that he loses track of the time until
the clock strikes eight and reminds him of the
lateness ot the hour.
"Yikes 1 " he yells, or less kind words to that ef
fect. "I have a class right now!" With that. Joe

runs outside, unlocks his bike, and pedals oft to his
8 o'clock class, dodging sprinklers gone berserk,
bollards, and pedestrians with the graceful ti
nesse only a Stanford bicyclist possesses. "Ah.
the excitement of biking at Stanford!" he tells
himselt.
Joe reaches the Quad in record time, locks his
bike, runs to class, and sits down panting. He gets
a pen and notebook out of his rucksack and begins
to transcribe the revelations being uttered by the
honored seer lecturing in tront ot him. He is tilled
with the profound sense of satisfaction that comes
with the exploration ot yet another field of in
quiry.
After the lecture is over, our mentally-enriched
hero bikes off to his next class, where he will
further increase both his stores of knowledge and
his ability to understand the world around him.
After this, he checks his mailbox and finds, to his
surprise, a letter! He opens it and learns that he
may have already won $100,030 in a sweepstakes
he hasn't even entered yet! Thrilled by this pros
pect, he tills out the enclosed form and mails it.
"Wow!" he thinks. "$100,000" He bikes off to his
next class.
After emerging from his last class of the morn
ing intellectually stimulated. Joe goes to lunch.
More excitement is in store for him as he chooses
his main course. "Funny that it is moving like
that, though." Nevertheless, he makes the fateful
decision to eat the lasagna. He goes into the dining
room and sits down with two friends.
"What did you get for problem 3(g) on the
Chem. test?" one of his triends asks the other.
"232. 4 milligrams," replies the other. "But I
wasn't sure. How bout you?" Engrossed by this
sudden twist in the conversation, Joe leans tor
ward, listening intently.
"Same thing." He pushes himself away trom
the table. "Well, I hate to eat and run. but I've got
a paper due tomorrow I haven't started yet."
"Yeah, so do I," says the other. They both put
their trays away. 'Later."
With this, it is time for us to leave Joe Stanford.
We must leave out in the interests of space, un
fortunately, his throes of passion as he begins this
week's reading assignments, his momentarily in
terrupted heartbeat when his phone rings later in
the afternoon (wrong number), the surprises of
tonight's dinner-soup, or the pleasurable sense of
enlightenment he receives when he hears John
Anderson speak in Kresge tonight (remember, to
day is a Monday). Although we have seen his life
from only slumber to lunch, we must have felt the
sense ot adventure permeating every part of Joe's
morning. Yet, here at Stanford, we have nothing
to bore us but boredom itself!
(Rob Pahre is a freshman majoring in interna
tional relations and German. His column appears
eierx other Friday.)
I have heard a lot of people complain recently
that life at Stanford is boring Obviously, these
people must be thinking of some place other than
the Stanford I know. Each day of our lives here are
chock-full ot excitement. Don't believe me?
Okay, I'll show you: I'll trace a typical day in the
life of Joe Stanford to show you the thrills abound
ing at every turn here.
It is Monday, Joe Stanford's favorite day of the
week. At 6:45 a.m. Joe's alarm goes oft, and the
first critical moment of decision in Joe's day is
suddenly thrust upon him: should he get up right
now, turn oft the alarm and blow oft his 8 o'clock
class, or hit the snooze alarm and postpone the de
cision a tatetul nine minutes? Despite the early
hour, Joe knows instantly what he must do: he hits
the snooze alarm. Nine minutes later the alarm
goes off again, and once again Joe must make a
decision. He gets up. •
As he walks down the hall to the shower Joe
wonders how many people will be up and taking
this morning. He guesses that two will.
But alas! As Joe enters the bathroom and looks
to the showers, he sees not two. but three people
taking a shower! Although stunned by this unex
pected development. Joe is able to pull himself to
gether somehow, and he. too. takes a shower.
Some time afterward, Joe goes down to break
tast. As he goes outside on his way to Food Ser
vice. he looks to the street, hoping with all his
might that the Daily has been delivered already
on this tine morning. Oh. joy unparalleled — it
has! He dashes over to the stack of papers on the
wet lawn, rips the string off of a bundle, and tri
umphantly wrenches a Daily trom the pile. Un
able to hold back his glee, he runs to breakfast.
Today's breakfast is fruit, cereal, eggs, English
muffins, and/or juice, like every other Food Ser
vice breakfast — and here I bow to those who call
Stanford boring. However, this breakfast is able
to excite Joe since today's eggs are neither boiled
eggs nor fried eggs, but scrambled eggs —
favorite! He can hear his heart pounding as he
says, "Eggs, please," to the hasher.
