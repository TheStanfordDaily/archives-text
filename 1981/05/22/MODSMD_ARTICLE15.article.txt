## Parents cannot choose to end life of fetus 
### 
While I do not pretend to have
the definitive answer to the
problems of abortion, it seems
to me that the argument pre
sented by David Miller (Daily,
May 19) must be rejected. The
question of whether abortion
can be justified in cases of rape,
serious congenital defect or
danger to the lite of the mother
remains an unresolved issue for
some people. But abortion as
birth control is clearly wrong.
Miller does not distinguish these
important conditions; instead,
he bases his argument defend
ing the "right" to abort on two
grounds: "self-defense" and
"involuntary servitude."
Leaving aside his myopic,
self-serving and irrelevant clas
sification of liberals and conser
vatives, assume for the sake of
argument that the fetus is hu
man at the point at which brain

activity begins, which is some
time after conception. This is
what Miller assumes.
This is the crux of his argu
ment: since the fetus "lives off"
its mother, contrary to her "de
sire or intent," the mother is
justified in terminating the re
lationship, resulting in the death
of the fetus. She has the right to
do this just as she would have
the right to disconnect herself
from Judith Jarvis Thompson's
hypothetical adult who sustains
himself by attaching himself to
her bloodstream.
A "simple matter of self de
fense," right? Wrong! Self de
tense from what? From a pos
sible threat on the mother's life,
perhaps so (I don't know). From
the inconvenience of carrying a
child to term? That is uncons
cionable. A fetus is not someone
who just comes along and com

mandeers its mother's body; it
is the product of an act, the pos
sible consequences of which are
known to practically everyone
(perhaps even Miller and
Thompson).
Miller's "involuntary
servitude" to carry a fetus.
There are ample opportunities
for a responsible person to take
measures against pregnancy.
Contrary to what Miller says, a
fetus is not capable of subject
ing anyone to anything, let alone
the "slavery'' of carrying it for
the inhumane period of nine
months. Except in cases of
rape, the mother has willfully
engaged in an act, recognizing
the possibility of pregnancy,
and must be responsible for its

outcome (as must the lather).
They cannot choose to cancel
another human lite because it is
inconvenient to them.
J. S. Miller, a bastion ot
modern day conservatism, also
said; "A person should be free
to do as he likes in his own con
cern; but he ought not to be free
to do as he likes in acting for an
other, under the pretext that the
affairs of the other are his own
affairs." He certainly did not
believe children were somehow
analogous to leeches, whose
continued existence was to be
decided according to the "de
sire and intent" of parents.
