Jewish security
Forgive me for not believing
that Noor-ud-Deen Mahmood
Zanki had the Jews' sense-?! se
curity and well-being in mind
when he enlightened the "ig
norant" Stanford community
about the AWACs affair (Daily,
May 3).
I suppose that when the Saudi
Arabians call for a "jihad," or
holy war, against Israel, they
want to drive Israel into the sea,
but not the Jews. They wish to
destroy Israel, but not the Jews.
They probably believe that the
terrorists they sponsor shoot
and bomb the concept of Israel,
rather than blowing up Jewish
schoolchildren.
And when the AWACs are
used to direct Arab bombers and
jet-fighters against targets in
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Jewish
blood won't run in the streets.
Right?

Hard to digest
I would like to express my
deepest apologies if I offended
anybody in my last column (Dai
ly, May 4). My purpose in writ
ing this column, as well as my
past columns, was not to vent
any pent-up feelings of racism,
misogyny or anything else of
that nature.
Rather, my purpose was to
provide some light, hopefully
comical material which people
could read while eating their
cereal in the morning Studies
have shown that cereal does not

get digested well with serious
columns.
I felt that if I were to write
some less serious columns, then
there would be less people in 9
a.m. classes with stomach
aches. For a time, I felt I was
succeeding. I noticed that on the
day of my column, there were
less people in morning classes
patting their little tummies.
I now realize that I have not
been completely successful in
my endeavors to help people.
Obviously, the contents of my
columns have been causing
some people much more in
digestion than any bowl of Cap
tain Crunch ever could.
Once again, my sincere
apologies.

'Vast majority'
In reading what Sylvia Weins
tein said concerning abortion
(Daily, April 30), we were
struck with a feeling that she
does not know what she is
saying. First, she declares
"most" churches are in favor of
abortiuii, iar <*s we
know, is unfounded. Which
churches comprise this
"most?" And anyway, "most"
churches do not condone abor
tion. Second, we don't re
member voting her to the posi
tion ot spokesperson for the
"vast majority" of Catholics.
We think she would have had a
hard time getting very many
Catholics to support abortion

and certainly not a "majority"
let alone a "vast majority."
Abortion is an emotional issue
and there is no easy solution. We
don't have the answer, but we
don't like anyo.st- *rying to force
their views by claiming a "vast
majority."

Belabored issue
Is it selt-defense to place a
"Come in" sign on your front
door, leave it open, and then
shoot all who inquire, on sight? I
suppose David Miller in "Abor
tion opponents in favor of forced
labor," (Daily, May '9) would
encourage the execution ot all
welfare recipients (and gradu
ate students!) in order to
abolish slavery; at least he
agrees they are human beings.
And I agree.

"Come in" sign on your front
door, leave it open, and then
shoot all who inquire, on sight? I
suppose David Miller in "Abor
tion opponents in favor of forced
labor," (Daily, May '9) would
encourage the execution ot all
welfare recipients (and gradu
ate students!) in order to
abolish slavery; at least he
agrees they are human beings.
And I agree.
