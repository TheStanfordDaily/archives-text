## Treat Irish Protestants, Catholics equally

And Cod has shown me he
has a remnant of people in Ul

here. A chosen people! An elect

And I believe Cod! Ecumenism
is doctrinallv unbiblical . . .
Basically unprotestant . . . ec
clesiastically unclean . . . prac

membership of the Creek Or

to the depths of the basest idol

church . . . the Archbishop of
Canterbury would welcome the
Pope as chairman and seems to

— The Right Reverend lan
Paisley,
Member of Parliament
As - such words issue forth
from the lips of the undisputed
leader of Ulster's Protestants,
can there be any question why a
Marxist terrorist orgnization
such as the Provisional Irish Re
publican Army is gaining the

sympathy ot Ulster's Catholics
as well as of world opinion?
Unfortunately, Paisley and
demogogues such as Martin
Smyth and Enoch Powell cannot
be ignored; they effectively dic
tate the actions of British
troops, the Royal Ulster Con
stabulary, and the Ulster De
tense Association, all ot which
comprise state or state-sanc
tioned forces in Ulster, and all
exclusively Protestant. Against
this array, Ulster Catholics are
defenseless except for the
abhored IRA to which the com
munity must turn to protect its
limited freedoms and
possessions.
British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is correct
that a crime is a crime is a
crime; Bobby Sands under the
laws of the Crown was a bank
robber and gun runner.
But, Sands' guilt under the
law was never in question, the
question raised by the hunger
strikers is whether or not there
is equal protection under the
laws ot the Crown for Catholics
as well as Protestants in
Northern Ireland. As the an
swer is so obviously no, the Iron
Lady and her government have
much to be accountable for.
How does she account for the
fact that under the laws of in
ternment whereby a citizen of
Ulster may be held without
being charged, without re
course, for an indefinite period
of time, 90 percent of those held
are Catholic? It is possible to
imagine a scenario in which 33
percent ot Ulster's population
commits 90 percent of its vi
olent crime; but as there are no
statistics as to who commits
what since there are no formal
charges, one cannot say with
any degree ot certainty that
such figures are correct.
Bombs hit Catholic and Prot
estant taverns alike; further,
for every Mountbatten blown up
there is a Bernadette Devlin
shot. Either the Protestants
never get caught or West
minster is looking the other way

when they commit crime.
Catholics subject to the
Crown have always been dis
criminated against whether un
der monarchy, aristocracy, lib
eral democracy or internment.
This is especially so in Ulster,
the last remnant of the British
Empire. At the same time, Ul
ster Protestants are the most
avowedly loyal of the Queen's
subjects. As such, the thunder
ings of Paisley remind the Brit
ish ot Rudyard Kipling and Em
pire, ot Oliver Cromwell, ot
King Billy of Orange who rid the
Empire forever of Rapists and
the House ot Stuart.
As obnoxious as the above
may seem, such is analogous to
our veneration of George Wash
ington, Abraham Lincoln, Ted
dy Roosevelt, the Wild West,
baseball, apple pie, hot dogs,
and Chevrolet; if John Wayne
were British, he would have
often been cast as William ot Or
ange at the Boyne.
It must be remembered that
the Test Act, repealed only 150
years ago, forebade Irish Catho
lics from voting, office holding,
ownership of real estate, educa
tion, etc., ad infinitum, ad nau
seam. Under the Act of Settle
ment of 701, no Catholic may
sit on the throne.
Further, the British Monarch
is the titular head of both the
Anglican and Presbyterian
churches. Thus, in the lore of the
monarchy, the essential symbol
ot British civilization, the head
of state must defend Protestant
churches against perceived
Catholic encroachment.
Although there is now com
plete religious liberty in the
British Empire, the state dis
criminates in other, no less in
vidious ways such as intern
ment; such can be compared to
the use of the poll tax in this
country to prevent minority vot
ing. I ofter the above as reasons.
Justification ot the above rea
sons are neither implied nor in
terred. However, anti-Catholi
cism is as British as ham
burgers are American.
Paisley's demagogic drivel
only serves to dupe the British
and others into thinking that the
strife is at root sectarian; such
a guise is necessary for con
tinued support trom the British
government. As was slavery,
and is apartheid, the root of the
problem is economic; there are
not enough jobs to go around in
the North. The Catholic ot Ul
ster is in an economic and politi
cal situation analogous to that of
American blacks before the civ
il rights movement.
The "chosen people" rhetoric
of Paisley, akin to the "master
race" propaganda ot Hitler,
serves as the intellectual
framework tor justifying the
discrimination against Catho
lics. Protestants avow the Cath
olics are disloyal in proportion
to Protestant loyalty and cannot
be trusted manning industry vi
tal to the Empire. Such may be
true, but Catholics cannot be
blamed as they have no stake in
the political or economic status
quo of Ulster as it has been con
tinually denied them by the
British.
Britain is directly responsible
for all ot Ireland's economic
problems; the Empire's coloni
al policies made it impossible
for Ireland to sustain herself as
anything but an agricultural

backwater. The famine of the
late 840s destroyed the Irish ec
onomic base forcing. Protes
tants and Catholics alike to
scrounge for the limited in
dustrial jobs available.
As these industries were
Anglican-owned and Presby
terian-staffed, the Protestants
got the jobs and the Catholics
got a life of squalor. Ulster's
economy became even more de
pendent on union with the Em
pire as the Harland and Wolff
shipyard ot Belfast built the
fleet used to protect British
power on a global scale. Such an
enterprise could not be sus
tained in an Irish republic.
In 921, the island was ger
rymandered into two states —
one, majority Protestant, and
the other, majority Catholic.
Such a division was made to
facilitate the fiction that the
area was intrinsically a prov
ince instead ot an artifical state
created by treaty. Only two of
Northern Ireland's six counties
have Protestant majorities. The
Irish Presbytarians feared that
if they were forced into the Irish
Free State where they would be
a 20 percent minority instead of
a 67 percent majority, Catholics
would resort to the same dis
criminatory and terrorist prac
tices that has been used against
them previously to gain
hegemony over these Protes
tants who remained.
It cannot be denied that IRA
violence has been focused on
Protestants. But unlike Paisley
and his Orange Order, the IRA
leaders were not Catholic:
Charles Steward Parnell, Sir
Roger Casement, and Theobald
Wolfe Tone were Protestant;
Eamonn DeValera, first IRA
leader and first Irish Republic
President was Jewish. Ulster
Protestants will only be targets
of IRA violence as long as they
stand in the way ot Irish re
unification. Moreover, they
have little moral right to do so
as they are Scotch colonialists
sent over by Britain in the 1600s
to secure her claims to Ireland,
and are thus not truly Irish.
It may be objected that Irish
reunification would serve only
to reverse the current pattern of
discrimination. However,
Northern Ireland is a fiction
created in 921 by the British. As
such, a 20 percent minority is
given veto power on the question
of national unification which
had not been hitherto divided.
It may not be argued that the
two communities be allowed to
coexist. However, we as a na
tion could never countenance
secession for the implementa
tion of slavery. Ireland had
always been an indivisible
whole before British partition.
It is in Britain's power to rectify
that wrong whenever it
chooses; such an action would
extricate itselt from the un
tenable situation of having to
support a quasifacist state
within its borders. If it refuses
to change its current policy, it
risks driving Catholics ever
more into the arms of the uni
versally deplored IRA.
Although such may be hell on
earth for Paisley and his fol
lowers. it is a hell he taught how
to create and operate.

the Test Act, repealed only 150
years ago, forebade Irish Catho
lics from voting, office holding,
ownership of real estate, educa
tion, etc., ad infinitum, ad nau
seam. Under the Act of Settle
ment of 701, no Catholic may
sit on the throne.
Further, the British Monarch
is the titular head of both the
Anglican and Presbyterian
churches. Thus, in the lore of the
monarchy, the essential symbol
ot British civilization, the head
of state must defend Protestant
churches against perceived
Catholic encroachment.
Although there is now com
plete religious liberty in the
British Empire, the state dis
criminates in other, no less in
vidious ways such as intern
ment; such can be compared to
the use of the poll tax in this
country to prevent minority vot
ing. I ofter the above as reasons.
Justification ot the above rea
sons are neither implied nor in
terred. However, anti-Catholi
cism is as British as ham
burgers are American.
Paisley's demagogic drivel
only serves to dupe the British
and others into thinking that the
strife is at root sectarian; such
a guise is necessary for con
tinued support trom the British
government. As was slavery,
and is apartheid, the root of the
problem is economic; there are
not enough jobs to go around in
the North. The Catholic ot Ul
ster is in an economic and politi
cal situation analogous to that of
American blacks before the civ
il rights movement.
The "chosen people" rhetoric
of Paisley, akin to the "master
race" propaganda ot Hitler,
serves as the intellectual
framework tor justifying the
discrimination against Catho
lics. Protestants avow the Cath
olics are disloyal in proportion
to Protestant loyalty and cannot
be trusted manning industry vi
tal to the Empire. Such may be
true, but Catholics cannot be
blamed as they have no stake in
the political or economic status
quo of Ulster as it has been con
tinually denied them by the
British.
Britain is directly responsible
for all ot Ireland's economic
problems; the Empire's coloni
al policies made it impossible
for Ireland to sustain herself as
anything but an agricultural

backwater. The famine of the
late 840s destroyed the Irish ec
onomic base forcing. Protes
tants and Catholics alike to
scrounge for the limited in
dustrial jobs available.
As these industries were
Anglican-owned and Presby
terian-staffed, the Protestants
got the jobs and the Catholics
got a life of squalor. Ulster's
economy became even more de
pendent on union with the Em
pire as the Harland and Wolff
shipyard ot Belfast built the
fleet used to protect British
power on a global scale. Such an
enterprise could not be sus
tained in an Irish republic.
In 921, the island was ger
rymandered into two states —
one, majority Protestant, and
the other, majority Catholic.
Such a division was made to
facilitate the fiction that the
area was intrinsically a prov
ince instead ot an artifical state
created by treaty. Only two of
Northern Ireland's six counties
have Protestant majorities. The
Irish Presbytarians feared that
if they were forced into the Irish
Free State where they would be
a 20 percent minority instead of
a 67 percent majority, Catholics
would resort to the same dis
criminatory and terrorist prac
tices that has been used against
them previously to gain
hegemony over these Protes
tants who remained.
It cannot be denied that IRA
violence has been focused on
Protestants. But unlike Paisley
and his Orange Order, the IRA
leaders were not Catholic:
Charles Steward Parnell, Sir
Roger Casement, and Theobald
Wolfe Tone were Protestant;
Eamonn DeValera, first IRA
leader and first Irish Republic
President was Jewish. Ulster
Protestants will only be targets
of IRA violence as long as they
stand in the way ot Irish re
unification. Moreover, they
have little moral right to do so
as they are Scotch colonialists
sent over by Britain in the 1600s
to secure her claims to Ireland,
and are thus not truly Irish.
It may be objected that Irish
reunification would serve only
to reverse the current pattern of
discrimination. However,
Northern Ireland is a fiction
created in 921 by the British. As
such, a 20 percent minority is
given veto power on the question
of national unification which
had not been hitherto divided.
It may not be argued that the
two communities be allowed to
coexist. However, we as a na
tion could never countenance
secession for the implementa
tion of slavery. Ireland had
always been an indivisible
whole before British partition.
It is in Britain's power to rectify
that wrong whenever it
chooses; such an action would
extricate itselt from the un
tenable situation of having to
support a quasifacist state
within its borders. If it refuses
to change its current policy, it
risks driving Catholics ever
more into the arms of the uni
versally deplored IRA.
Although such may be hell on
earth for Paisley and his fol
lowers. it is a hell he taught how
to create and operate.

— The Right Reverend lan
Paisley,
Member of Parliament
As - such words issue forth
from the lips of the undisputed
leader of Ulster's Protestants,
can there be any question why a
Marxist terrorist orgnization
such as the Provisional Irish Re
publican Army is gaining the

sympathy ot Ulster's Catholics
as well as of world opinion?
Unfortunately, Paisley and
demogogues such as Martin
Smyth and Enoch Powell cannot
be ignored; they effectively dic
tate the actions of British
troops, the Royal Ulster Con
stabulary, and the Ulster De
tense Association, all ot which
comprise state or state-sanc
tioned forces in Ulster, and all
exclusively Protestant. Against
this array, Ulster Catholics are
defenseless except for the
abhored IRA to which the com
munity must turn to protect its
limited freedoms and
possessions.
British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is correct
that a crime is a crime is a
crime; Bobby Sands under the
laws of the Crown was a bank
robber and gun runner.
But, Sands' guilt under the
law was never in question, the
question raised by the hunger
strikers is whether or not there
is equal protection under the
laws ot the Crown for Catholics
as well as Protestants in
Northern Ireland. As the an
swer is so obviously no, the Iron
Lady and her government have
much to be accountable for.
How does she account for the
fact that under the laws of in
ternment whereby a citizen of
Ulster may be held without
being charged, without re
course, for an indefinite period
of time, 90 percent of those held
are Catholic? It is possible to
imagine a scenario in which 33
percent ot Ulster's population
commits 90 percent of its vi
olent crime; but as there are no
statistics as to who commits
what since there are no formal
charges, one cannot say with
any degree ot certainty that
such figures are correct.
Bombs hit Catholic and Prot
estant taverns alike; further,
for every Mountbatten blown up
there is a Bernadette Devlin
shot. Either the Protestants
never get caught or West
minster is looking the other way

when they commit crime.
Catholics subject to the
Crown have always been dis
criminated against whether un
der monarchy, aristocracy, lib
eral democracy or internment.
This is especially so in Ulster,
the last remnant of the British
Empire. At the same time, Ul
ster Protestants are the most
avowedly loyal of the Queen's
subjects. As such, the thunder
ings of Paisley remind the Brit
ish ot Rudyard Kipling and Em
pire, ot Oliver Cromwell, ot
King Billy of Orange who rid the
Empire forever of Rapists and
the House ot Stuart.
As obnoxious as the above
may seem, such is analogous to
our veneration of George Wash
ington, Abraham Lincoln, Ted
dy Roosevelt, the Wild West,
baseball, apple pie, hot dogs,
and Chevrolet; if John Wayne
were British, he would have
often been cast as William ot Or
ange at the Boyne.
It must be remembered that
the Test Act, repealed only 150
years ago, forebade Irish Catho
lics from voting, office holding,

tion, etc., ad infinitum, ad nau

stand in the way ot Irish re
unification. Moreover, they
have little moral right to do so
as they are Scotch colonialists
sent over by Britain in the 1600s
to secure her claims to Ireland,
and are thus not truly Irish.
It may be objected that Irish
reunification would serve only
to reverse the current pattern of
discrimination. However,
Northern Ireland is a fiction
created in 921 by the British. As
such, a 20 percent minority is
given veto power on the question
of national unification which
had not been hitherto divided.
It may not be argued that the
two communities be allowed to
coexist. However, we as a na
tion could never countenance
secession for the implementa
tion of slavery. Ireland had
always been an indivisible
whole before British partition.
It is in Britain's power to rectify
that wrong whenever it
chooses; such an action would
extricate itselt from the un
tenable situation of having to
support a quasifacist state
within its borders. If it refuses
to change its current policy, it
risks driving Catholics ever
more into the arms of the uni
versally deplored IRA.
Although such may be hell on
earth for Paisley and his fol
lowers. it is a hell he taught how
to create and operate.

— The Right Reverend lan
Paisley,
Member of Parliament
As - such words issue forth
from the lips of the undisputed
leader of Ulster's Protestants,
can there be any question why a
Marxist terrorist orgnization
such as the Provisional Irish Re
publican Army is gaining the

sympathy ot Ulster's Catholics
as well as of world opinion?
Unfortunately, Paisley and
demogogues such as Martin
Smyth and Enoch Powell cannot
be ignored; they effectively dic
tate the actions of British
troops, the Royal Ulster Con
stabulary, and the Ulster De
tense Association, all ot which
comprise state or state-sanc
tioned forces in Ulster, and all
exclusively Protestant. Against
this array, Ulster Catholics are
defenseless except for the
abhored IRA to which the com
munity must turn to protect its
limited freedoms and
possessions.
British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is correct
that a crime is a crime is a
crime; Bobby Sands under the
laws of the Crown was a bank
robber and gun runner.
But, Sands' guilt under the
law was never in question, the
question raised by the hunger
strikers is whether or not there
is equal protection under the
laws ot the Crown for Catholics
as well as Protestants in
Northern Ireland. As the an
swer is so obviously no, the Iron
Lady and her government have
much to be accountable for.
How does she account for the
fact that under the laws of in
ternment whereby a citizen of
Ulster may be held without
being charged, without re
course, for an indefinite period
of time, 90 percent of those held
are Catholic? It is possible to
imagine a scenario in which 33
percent ot Ulster's population
commits 90 percent of its vi
olent crime; but as there are no
statistics as to who commits
what since there are no formal
charges, one cannot say with
any degree ot certainty that
such figures are correct.
Bombs hit Catholic and Prot
estant taverns alike; further,
for every Mountbatten blown up
there is a Bernadette Devlin
shot. Either the Protestants
never get caught or West
minster is looking the other way

when they commit crime.
Catholics subject to the
Crown have always been dis
criminated against whether un
der monarchy, aristocracy, lib
eral democracy or internment.
This is especially so in Ulster,
the last remnant of the British
Empire. At the same time, Ul
ster Protestants are the most
avowedly loyal of the Queen's
subjects. As such, the thunder
ings of Paisley remind the Brit
ish ot Rudyard Kipling and Em
pire, ot Oliver Cromwell, ot
King Billy of Orange who rid the
Empire forever of Rapists and
the House ot Stuart.
As obnoxious as the above
may seem, such is analogous to
our veneration of George Wash
ington, Abraham Lincoln, Ted
dy Roosevelt, the Wild West,
baseball, apple pie, hot dogs,
and Chevrolet; if John Wayne
were British, he would have
often been cast as William ot Or
ange at the Boyne.
It must be remembered that
the Test Act, repealed only 150
years ago, forebade Irish Catho
lics from voting, office holding,
ownership of real estate, educa
tion, etc., ad infinitum, ad nau
seam. Under the Act of Settle
ment of 701, no Catholic may
sit on the throne.
Further, the British Monarch
is the titular head of both the
Anglican and Presbyterian
churches. Thus, in the lore of the
monarchy, the essential symbol
ot British civilization, the head
of state must defend Protestant
churches against perceived
Catholic encroachment.
Although there is now com
plete religious liberty in the
British Empire, the state dis
criminates in other, no less in
vidious ways such as intern
ment; such can be compared to
the use of the poll tax in this
country to prevent minority vot
ing. I ofter the above as reasons.
Justification ot the above rea
sons are neither implied nor in
terred. However, anti-Catholi
cism is as British as ham
burgers are American.
Paisley's demagogic drivel
only serves to dupe the British
and others into thinking that the
strife is at root sectarian; such
a guise is necessary for con
tinued support trom the British
government. As was slavery,
and is apartheid, the root of the
problem is economic; there are
not enough jobs to go around in
the North. The Catholic ot Ul
ster is in an economic and politi
cal situation analogous to that of
American blacks before the civ
il rights movement.
The "chosen people" rhetoric
of Paisley, akin to the "master
race" propaganda ot Hitler,
serves as the intellectual
framework tor justifying the
discrimination against Catho
lics. Protestants avow the Cath
olics are disloyal in proportion
to Protestant loyalty and cannot
be trusted manning industry vi
tal to the Empire. Such may be
true, but Catholics cannot be
blamed as they have no stake in
the political or economic status
quo of Ulster as it has been con
tinually denied them by the
British.
Britain is directly responsible
for all ot Ireland's economic
problems; the Empire's coloni
al policies made it impossible
for Ireland to sustain herself as
anything but an agricultural

backwater. The famine of the
late 840s destroyed the Irish ec
onomic base forcing. Protes
tants and Catholics alike to
scrounge for the limited in
dustrial jobs available.
As these industries were
Anglican-owned and Presby
terian-staffed, the Protestants
got the jobs and the Catholics
got a life of squalor. Ulster's
economy became even more de
pendent on union with the Em
pire as the Harland and Wolff
shipyard ot Belfast built the
fleet used to protect British
power on a global scale. Such an
enterprise could not be sus
tained in an Irish republic.
In 921, the island was ger
rymandered into two states —
one, majority Protestant, and
the other, majority Catholic.
Such a division was made to
facilitate the fiction that the
area was intrinsically a prov
ince instead ot an artifical state
created by treaty. Only two of
Northern Ireland's six counties
have Protestant majorities. The
Irish Presbytarians feared that
if they were forced into the Irish
Free State where they would be
a 20 percent minority instead of
a 67 percent majority, Catholics
would resort to the same dis
criminatory and terrorist prac
tices that has been used against
them previously to gain
hegemony over these Protes
tants who remained.
It cannot be denied that IRA
violence has been focused on
Protestants. But unlike Paisley
and his Orange Order, the IRA
leaders were not Catholic:
Charles Steward Parnell, Sir
Roger Casement, and Theobald
Wolfe Tone were Protestant;
Eamonn DeValera, first IRA
leader and first Irish Republic
President was Jewish. Ulster
Protestants will only be targets
of IRA violence as long as they
stand in the way ot Irish re
unification. Moreover, they
have little moral right to do so
as they are Scotch colonialists
sent over by Britain in the 1600s
to secure her claims to Ireland,
and are thus not truly Irish.
