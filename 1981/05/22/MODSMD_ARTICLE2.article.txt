# New LOTS board will provide policy advice
## 
### Peter Finch 
A new LOTS Advisory Board, de
signed to review policies and user
problems, has been formed by Vice-
Provost and Dean ot Graduate Studies
and Research Gerald Lieberman.
According to LOTS director Ralph
Gorin, when the computer facility was
opened in 1976. an advisory board was
set up. However, for the last couple of
years, no board has met. he said.
The idea to reinstate the board
came, according to to Asst.
Geophysics Prof. Michael
McWilliams. "after last spring's dis
aster" when LOTS seemed to be con
tinually suffering from overloading
and other bothersome problems.
The new board is headed by Assoc.
Industrial Engineering Prof. James
Jucker and includes McWilliams,
Asst. Political Science Prof. John
Chubb, Arthur Pacheco, associate
dean of education. Curt Langlotz, a
senior human biology major and Nau
shad Forbes, a graduate student in in
dustrial engineering.
"We'll mostly be advising
(Lieberman and Gorin) about operat
ing LOTS and on what kind of equip
ment should be bought in the future,"
Jucker explained.
"Our job is to assess LOTS' current
problems and look ahead tor the
future," McWilliams added. "We'll be
looking for the best long-term and
short-term remedies for overload, for
example. We'll be making recommen
dations, as I understand it. We have no
mandate power. We can just make
suggestions."
"LOTS goes through cycles when
things aren't so good," Gorin noted. "I

think our low point was winter quar
ter. Things seem to be doing much bet
ter this spring."
"Right now LOTS is operating quite
well," Jucker concurred. "That is
mostly because of some things they
have done this quarter. Some of those
things are temporary, though, and our
main problem is what LOTS should do
in the long run."
One short-term action LOTS has
taken this quarter, according to
finrin. is :in expansion ot the facility's
capacity By borrowing a Decsystem
2040 computer from the Stanford Busi
ness School, he said, LOTS has been
able to handle considerably more ac
tivity.
Unfortunately, however, the Busi
ness School wants its computer back.
Chances are they will want it returned
by June 1982, Gorin said.
At that point, LOTS will probably
need to purchase a new computer. The
advisory board will be called on to
, help choose one that will best fit stu
dent needs.
"That's the kind of thing LOTS man
agement will have to decide on well in
advance," McWilliams said. "Our
group will help to make decisions like
that by identifying key problems
now."
The board has already had one
meeting this quarter, according to
Jucker, and intends to have another in
early June. The first meeting, he said,
was informational, an attempt to get
an overview of "where LOTS is" to
day. At the next meeting, he added,
the board will look into more specific
problems.
