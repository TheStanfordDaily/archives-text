## Federal official questions wisdom of preventive programs in Atlanta 
### 
Atlanta — The official in
charge of coordinating federal
aid to help solve the wave of
child killings here said Wednes
day that he had doubts about
how some ot that money is being
spent.
Charles Rinkevich, the coor
dinator, told members of the At
torney General's Task Force on
Violent Crime that the $979,00)
budgeted for summer recrea
tion programs would probably
be of no help to potential vic
tims.
So far, Rinkevich said, the 28
murdered or missing black chil
dren and young adults "fall into
an area not being addressed by
educational or recreational"
programs now in operation. He
noted that the victims "are not
the kinds of kids who get in
volved" in summer recreation
programs.
Rinkevich's observations
were sought by the task force
because the $2.9 million in fed
eral assistance given to Atlanta
— and which the $979,t)00 in sum
mer recreation funds is a part —
could be a precedent when an
other city is faced with a serious
crime wave in the future.
Rinkevich, urging that the
federal task force propose the
establishment ot a mechanism
for promptly responding to state
and local crime-related crises,
said that the Atlanta crisis had
affected "all aspects ot our so
cial fabric."
Personality changes
He noted that some children
are afraid to play outside with
their friends and have grown
fearful of all strangers.
Classroom teachers, he added,
have found "some normally out
going and communicative chil
dren to be withdrawn and un
responsive and others who are
ordinarily well-behaved show
ing signs of anger and frustra
tions."
Rinkevich said that truancy

rates have dropped, "presum
ably as a result of children and
parents being more fearful of
the unsupervised environment
outside the school." At the same
time, caseloads ot social ser
vice agencies have increased,
reflecting community fears and
tensions.
Rinkevich said that public
health officials had compared
the mental distress now being
suffered by children and parents
in Atlanta to the crisis caused by
the sectarian strife in Northern
Ireland, the London blitz of
World War 11, and the stress
produced by a natural disaster.
But in the case of a flood or

hurricane, "the level of distress
peaks, then ebbs when the natu
ral disaster subsides,"
Rinkevich said. "In the Atlanta
case, the peaking and ebbing are
a continuous process, adding an
unknown dimension to the prob
lem and the mental health reac
tion to it."
The task force was appointed
in March by Attorney General
William Smith to recommend
steps that the federal govern
ment can take to combat violent
crime without spending more
money or enacting new laws.
That recommendation is due in
mid-June. By mid-August, the
panel is to recommend changes,
both legally and financially.

that would help over the longer
term.
Griftin Bell, former attorney
general in the Carter adminis
tration and co-chairman of the
task force, questioned why all of
the $2.9 million in federal aid
was given to Atlanta instead of
the state of Georgia for distribu
tion to surrounding counties and
areas affected by the child kill
ings.
Rinkevich noted that more
than $1.5 million of the total fed
eral outlay was going to assist in
funding the investigation itself,
and that that would benefit not
just Atlanta, but all affected
areas.
