# Cal Tech seniors create ingenious 'ditch day' pranks
## 
### Washington Post 
Pasadena, Calif. — They are still
patching some bullet holes, but the
fires have been extinguished and the
floodwaters drained. The California In
stitute of Technology has survived an
other annual spring rite, transforming
the ordinary college prank by quantum
leaps into a proving ground for Ameri
can creativity.
To advance the frontiers of knowl
edge, some ot America's finest young
scientific minds surprised their teach
ers and administrators this week with
the following:
• A dormitory room tilled with water,
plus two undergraduates floating and
shivering as they waited, honor-bound,
for an hour before attempting to re
trieve an alcoholic reward hidden in the
murky depths.
• A room door blown oft its hinges by a
chemical reaction gone awry, igniting
a garbage can full ot combustible mate
rial and forcing emergency tire meas
ures.
• A ruse ot questionable legality which
led ground controllers to call back a
light plane bearing a Cal Tech senior at
tempting a daring escape from his un
dergraduate pursuers.

This surprise attack on university de
corum, costing over the years
thousands of dollars in damage and un
told hours of class time, happens every
May on this grassy, tree-lined campus.
Seniors suddenly disappear, the re
maining undergraduates try in the
most bizarre fashion to break into their
rooms and university administrators
see it all as a possible key to the unques
tioned superiority of American tech
nology:
"It is a lot like science is," said Cal
Tech news bureau director Dennis
Meredith. "The problems are going to
come out ot the blue and off the wall.
They are going to have to know how to
improvise."
Americans like to think of scientists
as eccentric, so Cal Tech has embraced
the idea with a vengeance and created a
tradition of pranksterism going back
decades. Some of the most bizarre have
already become cliches. During one
year's version of "senior ditch day,"
which is what the students call the an
nual spring event, some under
graduates broke into a senior's room
and were dissatisfied with the tood, liq
uor and drugs that had been left for
them. They disassembled the senior's

Porsche, which he had unwisely left in
the parking lot. When he returned in the
evening he found the car reassembled
— in his room, with the motor running.
The stunt has been repeated so often it
now is considered passe.
Cal Tech's history of pranks isn't
confined to the month of May. Budding
nuclear physicists here reminisce
about the great Rose Bowl hoax, in
which Cal Tech commandos switched
2300 card stunt instructions to be used
by the University of Washington cheer
ing section at halftime. The Washing
ton director watched aghast as his sig
nal to spell out "Washington"' instead
produced the huge letters for "Cal
Tech." Instead of a Washington Husky,
a Cal Tech Beaver then materialized
and the message "Buy bonds" came
out "Buy blondes."
Freshman Scott Gordon, a long
haired biochemistry major, sees
pranks as a way to relieve some of the
pressures ot study at one ot the most
competitive and distinguished scien
tific institutions in the world. Studying
at Cal Tech, he said, "is sometimes like
trying to drink from a fire hose."
Under the rules, mostly unwritten,
seniors secretly pick a day in May and

must be off campus by 8 a.m. or risk
being chained to a tree, as one re
portedly was Monday. They leave be
hind "stacks," intricate locks and
puzzles which must be solved before
their rooms can be entered.
Monday's "stacks" included com
puter programs, ,28-caliber bullets to
be tired through preselected holes, the
mixing of certain chemicals (which
misfired) and dozens ot others. Many
involved searches tor clues hidden
throughout the university.
One year a clue was wedged in a
crack in the exterior wall tive stories
up on the outside ot the nine-story Mil
liken Library. The dean of student af
fairs could be seen praying as an in
trepid undergraduate rappelled down
the side of the building to retrieve the
piece of paper.
Ted Weverka, a 20-year-old
sophomore, had been up all night Sun
day working on a physics lab assign
ment when early morning scurrying in
the halls told him the seniors were
sneaking away. He and some friends
solved one "stack" based on identi
fying rock types. One clue was a book
by Nobel laureate physicist and Cal
Tech professor Richard Feynman, so

Weverka climbed 20 feet up the side of
his dormitory to an old bas relief show
ing Copernicus, Newton and other sci
entific greats greeting God — labeled
"Feynman" by some unknown student.
On top of the head of the God/physicist
was the key to a senior's room*
One senior, a pilot, said he still had
his room key and dared anyone to catch
him. A team ot students rushed to the
El Monte airport, too late to prevent his
takeoff, but invented a story that per
suaded flight controllers to order him
back. His pursuers grabbed him and got
his key.
Senior Kelvin Wagner, 21, an applied
physics major, left what he thought
was a fairly simple "stack."
"If they poured liquid nitrogen on
this lens it would close a relay to an 120
volt AC charge which would drop a
large weight which would in turn pull
out a nail to unlock the door," Wagner
said.
As he spoke, university housekeeping
supervisor Ivan Zwelling appeared on
his annual survey of "ditch day" dam
age. Zwelling seemed amused by the
week's events and said that students
eventually repair or pay for all dam
age.
