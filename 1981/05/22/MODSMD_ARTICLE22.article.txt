# House, Senate consider abortion-related issues
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The House helped a promi
nent opponent of abortions move one step
closer to becoming surgeon general Wednes
day, while, in the Senate, eminent physicians
denounced a pending anti-abortion bill as
"backwards authoritarianism" that could out
law certain forms of birth control.
The House agreed by voice vote to an un
usual maneuver designed to clear the way for
President Ronald Reagan's nomination of 64-
year-old Philadelphia surgeon Everett Koop as
surgeon general, even though the statutory age
limit for the job is 63.
On a voice vote, the House directed its repre
sentatives to accept a Senate amendment per
mitting the age waiver when the legislation
comes up in a conference committee. But
Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman oi Califor
nia, a leader of the opposition to Koop's nomi
nation, said that he considered Wednesday's
resolution advisory, rather than binding on the
conferees. He said he and two of the other four
House conferees would continue to oppose the
age waiver when the conference committee
meets.
Meanwhile, in a Senate Judiciary subcom
mittee hearing. Dr. George Ryan, president of

the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, insisted that a pending anti
abortion bill would ban the intrauterine birth
control device and certain low-dose contracep
tive pills.
"This is not the way to resolve the abortion
issue." Ryan said, denouncing a bill by Sens.
.Jesse Helms and John East, both Republicans
from North Carolina. The bill defines life as be
ginning at the moment of conception and thus
could pave the way for states to forbid all abor
tions.
•Who are we to conceive of putting into leg
islation rules that will affect every woman who
ever becomes pregnant, to say to her. 'You
must carry that pregnancy to term because it's
life?' Senator East, I think that's nonsense."
said Dr. Mary Ellen Avery, a Harvard medical
professor and chief physician at Children's
Hospital in Boston.
East criticized Avery's argument that
babies should De wanted by their mothers —
and that the pre-birth screening procedure
known as amniocentesis. (to detect disease or
defects in the fetus), which earlier witnesses
had said would be banned by the bill, was nec
essary.
