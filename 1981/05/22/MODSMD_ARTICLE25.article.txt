I he Deer Hunter
New Varsity. Palo Alto
A cer\ rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
contradictory or confusing or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of Iwo
Jima; the movie puts you face to
face with the horrors of war.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cen
tral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in the
-same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically ev
erything else he's made — and oc
casionally he restores the movie
when things get pushed out of
shape. The Deer Hunter is more
than a little misshapen — some
times unbelievably wrong — but
there is a masterpiece buried in
there somewhere, and it more
than repays an attempt at excava
tion.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Apocalypse Note.

Hye llye lirazil ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing" so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cynical
enough to compete with the new
entertainment. TV, nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect trom
them. The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
to survive. Director Diegues does
a fine job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.
— Plays Mondav and Tuesday.

Apocalypse .Voir ★ ★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking ot
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb cinemato
graphy of Vittorio Storaro, Cop
pola creates stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and a vision of over
whelming evil. The movie has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ness ot this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind. Star
ring Martin Sheen and Marlon
Brando.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Deer Hunter

Melrin ami Howard ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
The so-called "Mormon will"
story is the inspiration tor
Jonathan Demme's Melrin and
Howard, an imaginative re
construction of the meeting be
tween Melvin Dummar (Paul Le
Mat) and Howard Hughes (Jason
Robards).
There aren't any stock charac
ters in this movie: everyone has
idiosyncracies, but Demme and
scriptwriter Bo Goldman don't
condescend to anv of them. The

major characters have been won
derfully drawn — and Demme and
Goldman have been fortunate in
their cast. As Lynda, Dummar's
first wife, Mary Steenburgen has
the perfect outlet for her spacy
sexiness. Jason Robards towers
over the movie, even though he ap
pears only briefly at the beginning
and (in a flashback) at the end No
actor has ever managed to look so
eccentric and so tragic at the same
time.

Dona Flor. a widow who mar
ries a dependable but none-too-ex
citing druggist, manages to get the
best of two worlds when her rakish
tirst husband returns from the
dead to put romance back into her
life. Dunn Flor is a warm, often
very funny import from Brazil On
the technical level, it has a lot of
rough edges — somehow, these
just seem to make it more human.

A movie that has forged an
amazingly durable reputaion on
the strength of one good gag. One
gets the feeling that director Mel
Brooks would have preferred to be
making "Springtime for Hitler,"
the play-within-the-film. than the
movie itself. The movie's TV-style
ugliness is a textbook case in fnep

Friday, Kresge
Jean Renoir's 1937 master
piece, set in a W'W I German pris
on camp, can be seen as a
marvellous adventure story; as a
melancholy essay on the loneliness
of man; as a masterful study in
changing social roles; and as an
unparalleled showcase of natural
istic cinematography. It is all of
these and much more, and might
even make you cry. With excellent
performances by Jean Gabin,
Pierre Fresnay, and Erich Von
Stroheim.
Double-billed with Alain
Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour.

the glorification of strong, individ

(Trevor Howard) is an aged
Cheyenne who uses guile and
nerve to survive countless hard
ships as he guides his family south
to meet the rest of the tribe. The
film is less an action-packed ad
venture story than an evocation of
mythological certainties. It is at

I he Deer Hunter
New Varsity. Palo Alto
A cer\ rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
contradictory or confusing or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of Iwo
Jima; the movie puts you face to
face with the horrors of war.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cen
tral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in the
-same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically ev
erything else he's made — and oc
casionally he restores the movie
when things get pushed out of
shape. The Deer Hunter is more
than a little misshapen — some
times unbelievably wrong — but
there is a masterpiece buried in
there somewhere, and it more
than repays an attempt at excava
tion.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Apocalypse Note.
— John Nielsen
Hye llye lirazil ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing" so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cynical
enough to compete with the new
entertainment. TV, nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect trom
them. The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
to survive. Director Diegues does
a fine job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.

Apocalypse .Voir ★ ★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking ot
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb cinemato
graphy of Vittorio Storaro, Cop
pola creates stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and a vision of over
whelming evil. The movie has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ness ot this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind. Star
ring Martin Sheen and Marlon
Brando.

Melrin ami Howard ★★★★

The so-called "Mormon will"
story is the inspiration tor
Jonathan Demme's Melrin and
Howard, an imaginative re
construction of the meeting be
tween Melvin Dummar (Paul Le
Mat) and Howard Hughes (Jason
Robards).
There aren't any stock charac
ters in this movie: everyone has
idiosyncracies, but Demme and
scriptwriter Bo Goldman don't
condescend to anv of them. The

major characters have been won
derfully drawn — and Demme and
Goldman have been fortunate in
their cast. As Lynda, Dummar's
first wife, Mary Steenburgen has
the perfect outlet for her spacy
sexiness. Jason Robards towers
over the movie, even though he ap

I he Deer Hunter
New Varsity. Palo Alto
A cer\ rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
contradictory or confusing or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of Iwo
Jima; the movie puts you face to
face with the horrors of war.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cen
tral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in the
-same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically ev
erything else he's made — and oc
casionally he restores the movie
when things get pushed out of
shape. The Deer Hunter is more
than a little misshapen — some
times unbelievably wrong — but
there is a masterpiece buried in

than repays an attempt at excava
tion.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing" so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cynical
enough to compete with the new
entertainment. TV, nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect trom
them. The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
to survive. Director Diegues does
a fine job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.

Francis Coppola's reworking ot

Aided by the superb cinemato

Jean Renoir's 1937 master

marvellous adventure story; as a
melancholy essay on the loneliness
of man; as a masterful study in
changing social roles; and as an
unparalleled showcase of natural

these and much more, and might

Jean Renoir's 1937 master
piece, set in a W'W I German pris
on camp, can be seen as a
marvellous adventure story; as a
melancholy essay on the loneliness
of man; as a masterful study in
changing social roles; and as an
unparalleled showcase of natural
istic cinematography. It is all of
these and much more, and might
even make you cry. With excellent
performances by Jean Gabin,
Pierre Fresnay, and Erich Von
Stroheim.
Double-billed with Alain

I he Deer Hunter
New Varsity. Palo Alto
A cer\ rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
contradictory or confusing or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of Iwo
Jima; the movie puts you face to
face with the horrors of war.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cen
tral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in the
-same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically ev
erything else he's made — and oc
casionally he restores the movie
when things get pushed out of
shape. The Deer Hunter is more
than a little misshapen — some
times unbelievably wrong — but
there is a masterpiece buried in
there somewhere, and it more
than repays an attempt at excava
tion.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Apocalypse Note.
— John Nielsen
Hye llye lirazil ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing" so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cynical
enough to compete with the new
entertainment. TV, nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect trom
them. The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
to survive. Director Diegues does
a fine job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.
— Plays Mondav and Tuesday.

Apocalypse .Voir ★ ★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking ot
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb cinemato
graphy of Vittorio Storaro, Cop
pola creates stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and a vision of over
whelming evil. The movie has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ness ot this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind. Star
ring Martin Sheen and Marlon
Brando.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Deer Hunter

Melrin ami Howard ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
The so-called "Mormon will"
story is the inspiration tor
Jonathan Demme's Melrin and
Howard, an imaginative re
construction of the meeting be
tween Melvin Dummar (Paul Le
Mat) and Howard Hughes (Jason
Robards).
There aren't any stock charac
ters in this movie: everyone has
idiosyncracies, but Demme and
scriptwriter Bo Goldman don't
condescend to anv of them. The

major characters have been won
derfully drawn — and Demme and
Goldman have been fortunate in
their cast. As Lynda, Dummar's
first wife, Mary Steenburgen has
the perfect outlet for her spacy
sexiness. Jason Robards towers
over the movie, even though he ap
pears only briefly at the beginning
and (in a flashback) at the end No
actor has ever managed to look so
eccentric and so tragic at the same
time.

The characters names are the

centrate on her character's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum

The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman

with dramatizing its "big mo

A movie that has forged an
amazingly durable reputaion on

gets the feeling that director Mel

movie itself. The movie's TV-style
