# The
						Stanford Daily Restaurants
## There's no free lunch, but Chinese restaurants can come close 
### Vince Waldman 
One of the culinary pleasures of living on
the Peninsula is the large number of Chinese
restaurants which offer inexpensive luncheon
specials. Restaurant reviews have an un
fortunate but understandable tendency to ig
nore lunch, because it is the meal at which a
restaurant's culinary abilities are most con
strained by considerations of time and money.
But the lunch specials are often of very high
quality; and for those of us on the demand side
of supply-side economics, they provide some
welcome bargains.
For example, at Lyly, 406 California Ave
nue, $2.15 will buy a complete lunch including
a main dish, appetizer, soup, and rice. The
selection is limited to traditional Chinese-
American items: almond pork, chop suey,
sweet and sour pork. The last is quite tasty,
with a very sweet, thick sauce; with it are
served crispy fried wontons and an ample por
tion of fried rice.
The decor at Lyly is an odd combination of
East and West. The long narrow dining room
has false Swiss windows along the sides, Chi
nese lanterns above, and astroturf-like in
door-outdoor carpeting on the floor. The res
taurant is crowded at noon, but when we went
after one it was nearly empty, and the service
was very quick.
In addition to the specials, Lyly offers ».
large selection of rice plates — a single dish
served on a large bed of white rice — at prices
from $2.35 to $3.15. The barbecued duck
($2.50) was good if greasy (you may need a
tew extra napkins).
For a larger appetite, extra appetizers may
also be ordered. Especially good is the parch
ment-wrapped chicken ($3.95). It ac
tualty comes wrapped in aluminum toil, but
the serving is quite large and the chicken is
tender and savory.
King Chuan, off Embarcadero at 75 Town
and Country Village, has a variety of luncheon
specials from $2.50 to $3.25. An excellent hot
and sour soup was served as soon as we or
dered. Like the other "hot" dishes we
sampled at King Chuan, it was not especially
spicy; but it was full of vegetables and the

broth was piquant.
Lunch was brought on very large serving
dishes Inspection revealed, however, that
there was very little pork in the twice-cooked
pork ($2.50) and even less shrimp in the
shrimp with black sauce ($3.25). There were
lots of vegetables and a great deal of rice. The
"black sauce" was actually a tew black beans
mixed in with the shrimp and other ingre
dients.
Another misleading description on the
menu was "Assorted Cold Appetizers
($4 95). This was not, as one would expect, an
assortment of the other cold appetizers listed
on the menu. Instead it turned out be a large
serving of two cold meats: lightly marinated
roast beef, and chicken covered with a thick
peanut and sesame sauce. It was an unusual
offering for a Chinese restaurant — the roast
beef wouldn't have been out of place in a deli
— and was one of the highlights of the meal.
(If you have time for dessert. King Chuan is
happily located next door to Edy's. a
marvelous old-fashioned candy store and ice
cream fountain: it's the sort of place where
you expect to see Andy Hardy and his girl
friend order one soda with two straws.)
Further down El Camino (at the University
exit ramp is China First, which has justly won
a reputation for some of the best-tasting food
in the area. A number of lunches are available
for about $3. which includes soup, spring roll,
and rice. The shrimp in chili is especially
good.
The "hot & spicy" dishes here are. for a
change, actually hot. China First makes few
concessions to Americanized taste buds. Un
fortunately. it also makes little effort to treat
its clientele with respect; the service ranges
from inept to rude.
China First is said to have an excellent, in
expensive bar. Perhaps this explains why. at
one lunch, our waiter brought the check with
the food and then went to sit at the bar. He sat
there for 30 minutes, staring impassively in
our direction while we waved at him for some
water. Another waiter finally brought the wa
ter — a whole pitcher — just as we were get
ting up to leave.

The service is much friendlier at Six Happi
ness. Here the lunch specials are $3 39, includ
ing soup and tried rice. Other items, at some
what higher prices, are posted on a black
board near the entrance.
Six Happiness is housed in an imposing
white building at 220 University Avenue In
side. however, the atmosphere is casual and
surprisingly quiet: more relaxed than many
harried lunch spots. It was not crowded when
we arrived at 12:30. and the service was effi
cient.
We ordered chicken in hot sauce (which
wasn't very hot) and pork in garlic sauce
(which was hotter). The portions were very
large and full ot meat.
With soup and rice, the lunch is quite filling.
For a voracious appetite, an order of pot
stickers (4 tor $1.95) is highly recommended.
The dough wrapping is light and the meat till
ing is strongly spiced with ginger. Other ap
petizers include chicken salad and steamed
buns.
For its weekend lunches. Six Happiness
serves dim sum. The prices are high, but
those who can't get to San Francisco shouldn't
miss the opportunity to try these ex
traordinary appetizers which are the ultimate
expression of the variety of Chinese cooking.
Mui Kiang is a wonderfully improbable res
taurant. Its owners claim that it's the only
place in the United States that serves the
cuisine of the Hakka people of China. The
menu tells us that the Hakka were aristocrats
who were thrown out of their native lands bv
their slaves 160) years ago. They migrated all
over China but never assimilated (today more
than 20 million speak the Hakka dialect).
"Hakka"' means "visitor," and the cookery is
unlike any other, though it is clearly in
fluenced by both northern and southern
cuisines, and perhaps also by Indian cooking. *
Two Mui Kiang restaurants are located in
Hong Kong. It almost defies credulity that the
third member of the chain should be placed on
a back street amidst the suburban boredom of
Mountain View. But there it is, a block north
of Castro at the corner ofVilla and Bryant
Streets. Mui Kiang is set off from the street by

a rocky artificial stream with beautiful or
namental carp.
The restaurant is large and very dark. The
decor is simple, with screens separating the
rooms. The service is fast but unobtrusive.
Despite its elegance and quality, Mui Kiang
still offers an excellent lunch tor $3.25, includ
ing soup, rice, and appetizer. The soup was
bland and somewhat disappointing, but the
rest of the meal was impressive. The fried
prawns were almost as light as tempura; the
skewered beef satay was prepared in a
flavorful marinade. Topping it all was the
lemon chicken, crisp and covered with a
pungently sweet, sticky glaze.
With the meal was served a terrific fried
rice, made with a variety of ingredients in
cluding peas and eggs. The rice was fluffy and
it stuck together (as rice must to be eaten with
chopsticks) without being sticky.
An unusual appetizer called Angel Treat
can be ordered for $2. The menu gives no de
scription, and the waiter would tell us only
that it was "fried milk." In any case, what
came to our table was a plate piled with tidbits
coated in a light brown crust. The filling had
the flavor of milk but the consistency of fish.
We could not induce the manager to divulge
the process for frying milk; but Angel Treat is
certainly worth a try.
Chef Chu's, at the corner of El Camino and
San Antonio, has a $3.25 lunch special which
lets you pick three items from a list of nine.
The portions are good-sized and the food good.
But most of the items on the list are ordinary,
especially when compared to the remarkable
variety ot items available on the menu. It may
be very hard to resist ordering from the regu
lar menu, although"the cost will run con
siderably higher.
Chef Chu's is a very large and very busy es
tablishment. It is not a place for lunchers in a
hurry; we came at 1 p.m. and waited 20
minutes for a table. Other than the special, the
menu (and the prices) is the same as at din
ner. This is not necessarily bad, since Chef
Chu is renowned tor its cuisine.
One fine dish that can be ordered on the
lunch special is the Mandarin Beet Stew ($5.50

on the regular menu). Big chunks of beef are
cooked with bamboo shoots, garlic, anisette,
and soy sauce. It isn't especially hot or spicy,
but it is as filling and hearty a dish as you can
expect to find in a Chinese restaurant.
We also ordered the five-spiced bean cake
with shredded pork ($4.95). The "five spices"
— anisette, cloves, pepper, fennel, and soy —
are sauteed with bean cake, pork, and bam
boo. The result was very meaty and very tas
ty.
A plate of appetizers can be had for $4.25, in
cluding excellent fried prawns, rumaki, spare
ribs, and egg rolls. A possible meal for two
would be a plate of appetizers and one main
course; but it will take fortitude to resist or
dering more of the fascinating items on Chef
Chu's menu.
Cho's, is a tiny store on California Avenue
which sells several varieties of dim sum, in
cluding steamed buns with pork, bean, and
lotus paste fillings, pot stickers, and several
types of pork dumplings. Cho's is only open for
three hours a day at lunchtime (closed on
Tuesday, open in the late afternoon on Thurs
day only). It has two tables and four chairs,
and is so small that one of the chairs sits
smack against the storage refrigerator.
(Take out orders are available, and probably
advisable.) But the dumplings are very juicy
and the steamed buns are sweet and whole
some.
Of the restaurants we visited, Lyly was the
cheapest; Chef Chu's and Six Happiness the
most expensive. Chef Chu's and Six Happiness
both prepare very fine meals, but the com
bination of setting, originality, and quality
made Mui Kiang the best buy overall.
Of course, this selection barely scratches
the surface. My sources vouch for China Lion,
Yuen Yung, O'Mei, and Su Hong, among oth
ers. This guide is only a sample of the re
markable variety of establishments at which
the economy-minded epicure can get an inex
pensive yet aesthetically pleasing weekday
lunch.
