Austin, Texas â€”In 967, the Stanford baseball team,
behind the coaching of Dutch Fehring and the bat of
Mark Marquess, rolled up the school's all-time best
record and finished third in the nation.
Now, fourteen years later, Marquess has taken Fehr
ing's spot in the dugout, and under his tutelage the
Cards will try to go one up on the boys from '67 and
claim Stanford's first national title, so narrowly
missed that year.
Their next step in that direction comes this weekend,
when the Cardinals will battle three other nationally
ranked teams in the Central Regional of the NCAA
play-otfs, with the winner advancing to the College
World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. The Cards open the
double-elimination tournament with the Lamar Uni
versity Cardinals (53-24, champions of the Southland
Conference) today at 1:30 CDT at the University of Tex
as in Austin.
Stanford, 40-20 following a two-game sweep of Pacil
ic-10 Nothern Division champion Washington last
weekend in the conference playoffs (10-8,10-6), is cur
rently rated 15th in the nation.
The Cards have won 1 out of their last 4 games, in
cluding a three-game sweep of then-No. 1 ranked Arizo
na State at Sunken Diamond earlier in the month. Some
are calling them the hottest team in the nation at the
moment, which is important as momentum plays a
large part in a tournament such as the one in Austin.
"We peaked just at the right time," agreed Mar
quess. "We're playing our best baseball right now.

We're as ready as we'd want to be at this stage "
But if the Cards are just starting to put it together as
a team, their offense has been there all year long, al
lowing the Cards to set more "hit" records than The
Beatles.
The new records set include team batting average
( .341, smashing the old mark of .305 set in 1979), home
runs (82, obliterating the old standard of 45 set in 1975),
hits (721, destroying the previous record of 608 in 977),
and runs, (534, breaking the old mark of 456 set in 1977).
Lamar, on the other hand, relies heavily on a young
pitching staff that includes sophomores Tony Mack
(8-3, 2.42 ERA) and Joe Pantaleo (10-4, 2.95) and
freshman southpaw John Senes (6- , 2.77). Pantaleo, a
righthander who has recorded 55 strikeouts on the sea
son, is slated to start against Stanford's Brian Myers in
the first game. Lamar's team ERA of 3.68 is among the
top twenty in the nation.
Offensively, the Texas Cards are led by Pedro
Valerio (.392, 6 HR, 41 RBIs in 55 games), second
baseman Alan Marr (.329, 12 HR, 45 RBIs), and desig
nated hitter Wayne Schwing (.293, 9 HR, 35 RBIs), as
well as twin brothers Kerry (.30 ) and Kim Christenson
(.271). The latter is who Lamar turns to in the clutch as
he has driven home 7 runs this year, a Southland Con
ference Record. The Cardinals from Beaumont, Texas,
have won seven straight games.
If Stanford wins their debut in Austin, they will then
face the winner of the other opening round game be
tween the host Texas Longhorns (55-8-1, No. 5 in the na
tion) and the Western Athletic Conference Champion

Brigham Young Wildcats (45-22), on Saturday.
The Longhorns, who were national champs in 1975.
are a team much in the mold of Stanford, lacking con
sistency in their mounds corps, but more then making
up tor it with their offensive firepower. UT boasts a .308
team batting average, and their big guns include Spike
Owen ( 332, 26 stolen bases. 78 BBs) catcher Burk
Goldthorn ( 343, 18 doubles, 8 HR), and rightfielder
Larry Long (.347).
Who is Peter Kendrick"' Answer: the hottest thing in
Provo. At five-foot-eight, 165 pounds, he is the man
most responsible for BYU's presence in Austin. Ken
drick threw both ends of a doubleheader, pitching all
6 innings, and picking up two victories over Hawaii for
his efforts in the WAC play-offs to catapult the Wildcats
to the Central Regional.
The sophomore from Honolulu has thrown two no-hit
ters, sports a 16-2 record, and a 1.30 ERA on the season.
If that isn't enough, he also doubles as a designated hit
ter, and is batting at a .381 clip.
But the 'Cats are far from a one man team. Kenny
Clayton i .413,21 HR, 77 RBI) is the WAC career batting
champion, having hit .479 in career conference games.
Rightfielder Steve Campbell has powered 15 balls over
the fence, including seven that have led off ballgames.
And Leon Bahem, a tranfer from El Camino Junior Col
lege, is hitting .369.
The victors will meet Saturday in the upper (win
ners') bracket, while the losers meet the same day.
Two losses eliminate a team from the tournament.
