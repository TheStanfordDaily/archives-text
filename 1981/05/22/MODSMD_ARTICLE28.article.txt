West Coast track enthusiasts will locus
their attention on the Farm this weekend as
Stanford hosts the 1981 Pacific-10 Track and
Field Championships. The meet began with
the decathlon Wednesday and continues to
day and tomorrow at Stanford Stadium with
the remaining events.
Dannie Jackson of Arizona State main
tained a significant lead over UCLA's Mark

Anderson in the ten-event decathlon yester
day, with two events remaining at press
'time. Anderson, the favorite in the event,
appeared to be confidently easing up in a
few events with the intention of saving his
energy for the NCAA meet, but the surpris
ing Jackson seemed to have snuck away
from him and put the title out ot reach.
The team competition is particularly in
teresting in that each of the top teams is

strong in a ditferent area: Oregon in the dis
tances, ASU in the sprints, Washington
State in the field events, and UC-Berkeley in
the hurdles and weights. Only UCLA is even
ly balanced, for the Bruins should score in
all but one or two of the 2 events.
The showcase of individual stars includes
distance-men Alberto Salazar and Rudy
Chapa ot Oregon, Olympic 200-meter bronze
medalist Dwayne Evans of ASU.
