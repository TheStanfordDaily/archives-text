I'niondale, \.Y. (AP) —
Butch Goring, the Islanders'
catalyst throughout the Na
tional Hockey League playoffs,
scored two first-period goals to
propel New York to its second
consecutive Stanley Cup with a
5- victory last night over the
Minnesota North Stars in the
fifth game of the finals.
The 9-year-old Islanders, who
lost only three of 18 postseason
games this spring, jumped to a
3- lead after one period. They
stretched it to 4-1 on Bob
Bourne's goal just 39 seconds
from the end of the second ses
sion and coasted to the cham
pionship before 15,0)8 delirious
fans.
It was Goring who drove most
ot the tans to ecstacy — and the
North Stars to elimination —

with his relentless brand of two
way hockey He was instrumen
tal to the Islanders last year as
well, sparking them to their
first championship.
Goring beat 19-year-old Min
nesota rookie goalie Don
Beaupre with a 15-foot wrist
shot on a power play at 5.12 ot
the first period after a pass
from Bourne set him up in front.
At 0:03, Goring, who joined the
team in a trade with Los Angel
es only a month before last
year's playoffs, poked a Clark
Gillies pass behind Beaupre.
Just 25 seconds after Gofing's
first goal, Wayne Merrick beat
Beaupre from short range after
John Tonelli had outmuscled
two Minnesota detensemen.
Minnesota's Steve Christotf
cut the North Stars' deficit to 3-
when he snapped a 25-foot shot
behind Islanders goalie Billy
Smith at 6.06. The gutsy North
Stars, who finished the season in
ninth place overall while the Is
landers were first, then kept
pace with New York for much of
the second period.
But, with 39 seconds left in the
period, Minnesota detenseman
Paul Shmyr misplayed the puck
at the side of his net and Bourne
took advantage, ripping a 25-
foot shot past Beaupre to clinch
it.
