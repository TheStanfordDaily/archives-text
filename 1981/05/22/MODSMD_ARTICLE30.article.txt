# Ivan Maisel: singles tournament endurance test
## 
### 
You could see the agony etched in Scott
Davis' face. It was the agony of getting passed
over tor that promotion in lavor of the boss' son
in law, the agony that so otten hits when lite is
not all serves and sideline winners. It was the
agony of knowing you are better than the guy
across the net, only to watch helplessly as the
ball sails long, or wide, or both.
Like a pitcher without his best stuff, Davis
worked his way through Mark Flur of Duke of
the second round of the NCAA singles tour
nament on guile and guts, winning 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.
But the magic held out for only so long on this
breezy spring Thursday. An hour-and-a-half
later, Davis opened his third round match with
a service break of SMU's Jerome Vanier. That,
however, was it. Vanier broke the fifth-seeded
freshman in the 'Ith game of each set to move
into the fourth round a 7-5, 7-5 victor."..
Davis was agonizing because he wasn't
being beaten by a Robbie Venter, or a Chip
Hooper. In the first match, he struggled

against a guy who had lost nine times this sea
son. Flur, a sophomore trom that tennis hotbed
known as Burlington, Vt., hadn't played a com
petitive match in over a month.
If anything, the opposite was Davis' prob
lem. He, as well as his teammates, was emo
tionally drained from too much tennis.
The Stanford team was in good shape physi
cally for the beginning ot the singles and
doubles competition. But in Davis' case the
emotional highs needed to compete in this tour
nament had been used up two days ago in win
ning the team competition.
"The whole process of the team tournament
took more out of me than I thought," Davis
said after losng to Vanier. "I can't just say I'd
rather be on a losing team and practice all
week. I know it's not the best thing tor individ
uals to get that far in the team tournament."
In the opening match against Flur, Davis
tried to force himself to be mentally ag
gressive by being physically aggressive. But

he soon found out that changing his game from
the neck down didn't help when his problems
were from the neck up.
If he were a boxer, Davis would be a coun
terpuncher. He has been the most successful
this year when he waited for his opponent to
commit himself, then hit whatever shot was
necessary to win the point. Against Flur, how
ever, he came out swinging.
"I was hoping to come out and play really ag
gressive tennis. I started to serve and volley.
When I started coming in, he kept passing
me," Davis said.
Davis worked out of that hole by going back
to what had won for him all year. He began to
pick his spots in which to be aggressive, know
ing, as he said after the match, that Flur
"couldn't keep passing me."
He was right, winning the match late in the
third set after being broken at 5-2 and 5-4. But
he knew he didn't have enough to continue win
ning against the fast paced company he was

keeping.
"I usually start playing better by the round
ot 16 or the quarters. But I've got to start
playing better in the first round. I'm not in the
16-and-unders anymore," he said, after beat
ing Flur.
Arkansas' Chip Hooper, a brother ot Stan
ford fullback Greg and the top seed here, said
Davis' collegiate inexperience was the telling
difference. He hasn't played in the NCAA's
before. He's a great player and everybody
knows it," Hopper said. "But I got the nod for
No. 1 seed because I'm a senior. You've got to
be mentally tough."
Davis was tired. He was tired ot playing less
than his best tennis. He had been lamenting his
lethargy all week. When he lost to Venter in the
finals of the team tournament Tuesday, he was
so upset he wouldn't speak to reporters until af
ter the match was over. But yesterday, he was
resigned to defeat. He knew the spoils of vic
tory had spoiled his game.

Davis worked out of that hole by going back
to what had won for him all year. He began to
pick his spots in which to be aggressive, know
ing, as he said after the match, that Flur
"couldn't keep passing me."
He was right, winning the match late in the
third set after being broken at 5-2 and 5-4. But
he knew he didn't have enough to continue win
ning against the fast paced company he was

keeping.
"I usually start playing better by the round
ot 16 or the quarters. But I've got to start
playing better in the first round. I'm not in the
16-and-unders anymore," he said, after beat
ing Flur.
Arkansas' Chip Hooper, a brother ot Stan
ford fullback Greg and the top seed here, said
Davis' collegiate inexperience was the telling
difference. He hasn't played in the NCAA's
before. He's a great player and everybody
knows it," Hopper said. "But I got the nod for
No. 1 seed because I'm a senior. You've got to
be mentally tough."
Davis was tired. He was tired ot playing less
than his best tennis. He had been lamenting his
lethargy all week. When he lost to Venter in the
finals of the team tournament Tuesday, he was
so upset he wouldn't speak to reporters until af
ter the match was over. But yesterday, he was
resigned to defeat. He knew the spoils of vic
tory had spoiled his game.
You could see the agony etched in Scott
Davis' face. It was the agony of getting passed
over tor that promotion in lavor of the boss' son
in law, the agony that so otten hits when lite is
not all serves and sideline winners. It was the
agony of knowing you are better than the guy
across the net, only to watch helplessly as the
ball sails long, or wide, or both.
Like a pitcher without his best stuff, Davis
worked his way through Mark Flur of Duke of
the second round of the NCAA singles tour
nament on guile and guts, winning 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.
But the magic held out for only so long on this
breezy spring Thursday. An hour-and-a-half
later, Davis opened his third round match with
a service break of SMU's Jerome Vanier. That,
however, was it. Vanier broke the fifth-seeded
freshman in the 'Ith game of each set to move
into the fourth round a 7-5, 7-5 victor."..
Davis was agonizing because he wasn't
being beaten by a Robbie Venter, or a Chip
Hooper. In the first match, he struggled

against a guy who had lost nine times this sea
son. Flur, a sophomore trom that tennis hotbed
known as Burlington, Vt., hadn't played a com
petitive match in over a month.
If anything, the opposite was Davis' prob
lem. He, as well as his teammates, was emo
tionally drained from too much tennis.
The Stanford team was in good shape physi
cally for the beginning ot the singles and
doubles competition. But in Davis' case the
emotional highs needed to compete in this tour
nament had been used up two days ago in win
ning the team competition.
"The whole process of the team tournament
took more out of me than I thought," Davis
said after losng to Vanier. "I can't just say I'd
rather be on a losing team and practice all
week. I know it's not the best thing tor individ
uals to get that far in the team tournament."
In the opening match against Flur, Davis
tried to force himself to be mentally ag
gressive by being physically aggressive. But

he soon found out that changing his game from
the neck down didn't help when his problems
were from the neck up.
If he were a boxer, Davis would be a coun
terpuncher. He has been the most successful
this year when he waited for his opponent to
commit himself, then hit whatever shot was
necessary to win the point. Against Flur, how
ever, he came out swinging.
"I was hoping to come out and play really ag
gressive tennis. I started to serve and volley.
When I started coming in, he kept passing
me," Davis said.
