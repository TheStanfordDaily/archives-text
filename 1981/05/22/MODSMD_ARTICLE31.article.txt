Schmidt seeks better relations
Washington — President Ronald Reagan warmly wel
comed West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to Wash
ington yesterday as both leaders appeared determined to
put relations between their countries on a firmer footing
than that ot the often stormy days ot the Carter adminis
tration.
"Make yourself at home." Reagan told Schmidt during
a full-dress military welcoming ceremony on the south
lawn of the White House.
In their public remarks at the start of Schmidt 's two-day
official visit, each leader said things the other likes to
hear.
Schmidt spoke of the 'excessive Soviet arms buildup"
and the "challenge toward the community of nations re
sulting from the continuing Soviet intervention in Afghan
istan." assessments meant to bolster U.S. confidence that
Bonn remains firm in its commitments to Western de
fense.
Reagan promised that the United States will work
toward meaningful negotiations with Moscow to limit Eu
ropean-based nuclear armaments. That concession is very

important to Schmidt who has come under sharp attack
from his own party's left wing for compliance with a
NATO plan to base new U.S.-built missiles in West Germa
ny.
Reagan thanked Schmidt for support during the Iran
crisis and added that "our economic policies should be as
closely allied as our defense policies. "
Although Schmidt has a crucial interest in the arms
talks and in high U.S. interest rates which are having a se
rious impact on European economies, officials said Bonn
did not press demands on the White House
Pope's assailant still unrepentant
Rome — Mehmet Ali Agca, accused of the May 13 shoot
ing of Pope John Paul 11, shouted to reporters yesterday
that he had no regrets that the pontiff had been injured.
"I am well." he said "I am sorry tor the two foreign
tourists, not the Pope
Agca was referring to the two American women
wounded in the shooting.
Agca made the comments in English as he was being
taken from police headquarters here to an armored van
that transported him to Rebbibia Prison, six miles north
east ot Rome, where he will be held in isolation and be un
der constant guard.
The move came after police had questioned Agca for
tour more hours late Wednesday.
Agca dropped the cool, sometimes defiant, silence with
which he had faced reporters on previous occasions to
shout back, in response to a din of questions, as guards
herded him across the courtyard of police headquarters.
Security was so relaxed that one reporter with a tape rec
order was able to edge between Agca and his guards for a
few seconds. Other press representatives jostled the pris
oner and his escort.
In the interrogation Wednesday night. Agca told police
that he had considered killing two additional public figures
— president Habib Bourguiba ot Tunisia and Prime Min
ister Dom Mintotf of Malta.
Begin wants missiles out of Syria, too
Jerusalem — Injecting a new element into the nego
tiations to defuse the Syrian-Israeli crisis. Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin demanded yesterday that Syria
not only remove its surface-to-air missiles deployed in
Lebanon, but also those inside Syria near the Lebanese
border.
Begin also said Syria must offer a commitment not to
tire any of its missiles against overflying Israeli aircraft.
In an interview on the NBC-TV "Today" show broadcast
from his Jerusalem office, the prime minister said Syrian
fulfillment of those conditions is necessary to return the
situation in Lebanon to the "status quo ante."
The prime minister's office issued a statement last
night saying that the "reference to missiles was intended
to indicate additional installations to existing missiles
deployed after the outbreak of the current crisis with Syr
ia. It did not refer to missiles already in position before the
crisis."
Begin s comment, representing, in effect, a demand to

control Syrian military deployment on sovereign Syrian
soil, appeared to pose a new problem for U.S. special en
voy Philip Habib, who has been shuttling tor two weeks be
tween here and Damascus in an attempt to resolve the Is
raeli-Syrian confrontation and avert a Middle East war
The crisis began to escalate on April 28 when Israeli jet
fighters shot down two Syrian helicopters that had been
used to resupply Syrian forces attacking Israeli-supported
Christian militias in the Sannin mountains northeast of
Beirut The next day Syria deployed the first of 14 surface
to-air missile batteries, five in Lebanon's Bekaa valley
and nine more just across the frontier inside Syria

ing of Pope John Paul 11, shouted to reporters yesterday
that he had no regrets that the pontiff had been injured.
"I am well." he said "I am sorry tor the two foreign
tourists, not the Pope
Agca was referring to the two American women
wounded in the shooting.
Agca made the comments in English as he was being
taken from police headquarters here to an armored van
that transported him to Rebbibia Prison, six miles north
east ot Rome, where he will be held in isolation and be un
der constant guard.
The move came after police had questioned Agca for
tour more hours late Wednesday.
Agca dropped the cool, sometimes defiant, silence with
which he had faced reporters on previous occasions to
shout back, in response to a din of questions, as guards
herded him across the courtyard of police headquarters.
Security was so relaxed that one reporter with a tape rec
order was able to edge between Agca and his guards for a
few seconds. Other press representatives jostled the pris
oner and his escort.
In the interrogation Wednesday night. Agca told police
that he had considered killing two additional public figures

Begin wants missiles out of Syria, too
Jerusalem — Injecting a new element into the nego
tiations to defuse the Syrian-Israeli crisis. Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin demanded yesterday that Syria
not only remove its surface-to-air missiles deployed in
Lebanon, but also those inside Syria near the Lebanese
border.
Begin also said Syria must offer a commitment not to
tire any of its missiles against overflying Israeli aircraft.
In an interview on the NBC-TV "Today" show broadcast
from his Jerusalem office, the prime minister said Syrian
fulfillment of those conditions is necessary to return the
situation in Lebanon to the "status quo ante."
The prime minister's office issued a statement last
night saying that the "reference to missiles was intended
to indicate additional installations to existing missiles
deployed after the outbreak of the current crisis with Syr
ia. It did not refer to missiles already in position before the
crisis."
Begin s comment, representing, in effect, a demand to

control Syrian military deployment on sovereign Syrian
soil, appeared to pose a new problem for U.S. special en
voy Philip Habib, who has been shuttling tor two weeks be
tween here and Damascus in an attempt to resolve the Is
raeli-Syrian confrontation and avert a Middle East war
The crisis began to escalate on April 28 when Israeli jet
fighters shot down two Syrian helicopters that had been
used to resupply Syrian forces attacking Israeli-supported
Christian militias in the Sannin mountains northeast of
Beirut The next day Syria deployed the first of 14 surface
to-air missile batteries, five in Lebanon's Bekaa valley
and nine more just across the frontier inside Syria

situation in Lebanon to the "status quo ante."

deployed after the outbreak of the current crisis with Syr
ia. It did not refer to missiles already in position before the

tween here and Damascus in an attempt to resolve the Is
raeli-Syrian confrontation and avert a Middle East war
The crisis began to escalate on April 28 when Israeli jet

Beirut The next day Syria deployed the first of 14 surface
to-air missile batteries, five in Lebanon's Bekaa valley
and nine more just across the frontier inside Syria

put relations between their countries on a firmer footing
than that ot the often stormy days ot the Carter adminis

"Make yourself at home." Reagan told Schmidt during
a full-dress military welcoming ceremony on the south
lawn of the White House.
In their public remarks at the start of Schmidt 's two-day
official visit, each leader said things the other likes to
hear.
Schmidt spoke of the 'excessive Soviet arms buildup"
and the "challenge toward the community of nations re
sulting from the continuing Soviet intervention in Afghan
istan." assessments meant to bolster U.S. confidence that
Bonn remains firm in its commitments to Western de
fense.
Reagan promised that the United States will work
toward meaningful negotiations with Moscow to limit Eu
ropean-based nuclear armaments. That concession is very

important to Schmidt who has come under sharp attack
from his own party's left wing for compliance with a
NATO plan to base new U.S.-built missiles in West Germa
ny.
Reagan thanked Schmidt for support during the Iran
crisis and added that "our economic policies should be as
closely allied as our defense policies. "

talks and in high U.S. interest rates which are having a se
rious impact on European economies, officials said Bonn
did not press demands on the White House

taken from police headquarters here to an armored van
that transported him to Rebbibia Prison, six miles north
east ot Rome, where he will be held in isolation and be un
der constant guard.
The move came after police had questioned Agca for
tour more hours late Wednesday.
Agca dropped the cool, sometimes defiant, silence with
which he had faced reporters on previous occasions to
shout back, in response to a din of questions, as guards
herded him across the courtyard of police headquarters.
Security was so relaxed that one reporter with a tape rec
order was able to edge between Agca and his guards for a
few seconds. Other press representatives jostled the pris
oner and his escort.
In the interrogation Wednesday night. Agca told police
that he had considered killing two additional public figures
— president Habib Bourguiba ot Tunisia and Prime Min
