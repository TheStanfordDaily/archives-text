### Ivan Maisel 
Athens, Ga. — The height of emo
tion reached by the Stanford tennis
team in winning the NCAA title Tues
day took its toll yesterday in the indi
vidual tournament. Freshman Scott
Davis, the fifth seed in the 64-man
field, was one of eight seeds to exit
early in the singles meet, while the
seeded team of Jeff Arons and Mike
Falberg were ousted in the second
round ot doubles.
Though fourth-seeded Tim Mayotte
and seeded Jim Gurfein (Nos. nine-16

are listed alphabetically) advanced
without dropping a set through two
rounds of singles and, a long with
Davis and Scott Bondurant, moved to
the third round ot doubles, they were
clearly drained.
"In a lot of ways this is an en
durance test," Mayotte said, after his
second round win over Wayne Hearn
of Missisipi, 6-4.6-2 "You have to play
two matches, which a lot ot people
aren't used to."
The junior advanced to the round of
16 yesterday atternoon with a 6-4. 6-0

drubbing of Oklahoma State's Mark
Johnson. Besides winning. Mayotte's
goal was to use as little emotional and
physical energy as possible. "I feel a
little tired, we all do." he said. "I just
tried to get a lot of the balls in the
court."
Though Gurfein didn't have much
more trouble than Mayotte did in mov
ing to the fourth round, he said he
didn't have the luxury of shitting into
low gear.
"It was tough to get mentally ready
this morning." the sophomore said af

ter beating Texas' Paul Crozier 6-3,
6-2. "I don't think I can afford to pace
myself like Mayotte and play ade
quate and do the job. I have to be on a
higher level. Tim goes out and plays
business- like — I'm not physically
capable of doing that."
Despite his supposed physical in
capabliites. Gurfein had little trouble
with Arizona State's Gary Donnelly,
winning 6-4.6-3. His next opponent will
be UCLA's Robbie Venter, the No. 8
seed who lost only five games in mov
ing into the fourth round
