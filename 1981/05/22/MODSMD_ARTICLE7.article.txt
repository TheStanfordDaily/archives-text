# More minority grads admitted

The number of non-Asian American
minority graduate students who plan
to attend Stanford for 198 -82 is 20 per
cent greater than it was for 980-8 , ac
cording to Vice-Provost and Dean of
Graduate Studies and Research
Gerald Lieberman.
However, in a report to the Faculty
Senate yesterday on affirmative ac
tion in graduate enrollment and re
search appointments, Lieberman said
total actual minority enrollment held
steady in 980-8 compared to 1979-80.
Increases in first-year minority ad
missions in professional schools —
law, medicine and business — offset
decreases in first-year minority ad
missions in engineering, education
and humanities and sciences, he said.
(Stanford, like many other univer
sities, does not consider Asian Ameri
cans an underrepresented ethnic
group.)
Assistant Dean of the Graduate
Division Edward Escobar said gradu
ate schools have increased minority

enrollment at a steady rate, but the
rate for professional schools has sky
rocketed.
Lieberman cited the School of Engi
neering and natural science depart
ments as exceptions. Together, they
accepted 7 non-Asian minority stu
dents for 198 -82 compared to only five
in 980-8 .
"But that doesn't mean we can let
down our guard," Lieberman said.
This fall, the Office of Graduate Stud
ies and Research will add a full-time
position filled by a native American,
who will help recruit native Ameri
cans throughout the University,
Lieberman said. The University
wishes to till a similar position with a
black, he said.
In a report on affirmative action in
faculty appointments. Provost Albert
Hastorf said: "In general we have
made very slow progress in the ap
pointment of Women and minorities to
the faculty at Stanford. But we have
come fairly close to doubling them in
the past decade."

Hastorf said tive new women have
been appointed to the faculty for
198 -82, two at the tenure level. Three
new minority faculty have also been
appointed, but none with tenure. How
ever, five other minority members
and two women from within the Uni
versity have been tenured, he said.
The senate also heard a report on
distribution requirements and
adopted the recommendations of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS) to alter criteria for two of the
eight required areas.
Assoc. History Prot. Carolyn
Lougee, who chairs the CUS, ex
plained that the committee had re
viewed every course certified last
year to meet a distribution require
ment and every course that had been
proposed as an addition to the list.
Last year, she said, 350 courses
were certified. This year the CUS
certified 412.
The CUS also recommended that
criteria for determining which
courses should fulfill the distribution
requirements be changed for two
areas. The senate adopted the recom
mendation to reword the criteria for
two areas — philosophical, social and
religious thought, and technology and
applied sciences. In the former, there
will be more emphasis put on courses
