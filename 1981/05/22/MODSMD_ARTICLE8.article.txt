## 
### 
Stanford lost a legal skirmish with
Father Flanagan's Boys Home
Wednesday, when Palo Alto Superior
Court Judge Paul Teilh granted the
Nebraska foundation's lawyers a mo
tion to stay a suit for breach of con
tract.
In March, Stanford and Catholic
University of Washington, D C. filed
suit against the home after it stopped
payments on the two universities' 25-
year contracts for youth research
Stanford currently receives some
$650,000 each year.
The contracts were to run from 1974
to 1998, but Boys Home ceased
payments in January, claiming the re
search being conducted at the two uni
versities was inappropriate or un
authorized under the foundation's
articles of incorporation
Current research projects at the
Stanford Boys Town Center include in
vestigating the effect of day-care cen
ters on mother-child relationships and
a child's own social development and
exploring the impact of foster care on
abused and neglected children.
The universities had filed a motion
for declaratory judgment to order
Boys Town to honor the contract.
However. Teilh agreed with conten
tions by the counsel for Boys' Home
that legal action in the case should be
tiled in Nebraska rather than in Cali

fornia, as wished by the two univer
sities.
David Heilbron, the lavwer repre
senting Stanford, told the press after
the hearing that he was unprepared to
say what the universities would do
next, but he indicated that subsequent
legal action would happen soon.
.J. Merrill Carlsmith, director of the
Stanford center, said he was disap
pointed about the ruling He said the
center was concerned with locating
replacement funds for current re
search
"We're looking very hard to find
funding to provide for our projects but
at the present time. I just don't see
how we can find that kind of money."
Carlsmith said.
While Stanford s center includes 25
affiliated faculty members, a resident
staff of 0. 30 graduate students, and
clerical workers, Carlsmith said no
one would be laid off and that his staff
was trying to cut down on expenses.
Besides the $650.0)0 annual contract
fee. Boys Home donated $15 million
to Stanford to build quarters for the
