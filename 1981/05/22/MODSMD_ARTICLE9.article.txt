## Turkish indictment probes terrorist refuge network 
### Washington Post 
Ankara, Turkey — A massive investigation into Tur
key's major tar-right political party has suggested
ways how a fugitive Turkish terrorist such as Mehmet
Ali Agca, accused of shooting Pope John Paul II last
Wednesday, could find underground refuge in Western
Europe after escaping from prison here 8 months ago
The probe has led to a 945-page criminal indictment
against 587 leaders of the ultraconservative National
Action Party, whose militant Gray Wolves are blamed
tor many murders of leftists and liberals in the fac
tional strife that led to last September's military coup.
Submitted recently to the Turkish martial-law court
by seven military prosecutors after six months of ex
amining seized documents and interrogating im
prisoned party officials, the indictment makes no at
tempt to tocus on Agca or explain possible motives for
the alleged assassination attempt
Militant ties
It implies, however, that Agca had direct ties to the
feared Gray Wolves and obtained shadowy help from
the National Action Party in tleeing to Iran after his
November 1979 prison escape. Agca had been arrested
earlier that year for the assassination of Abdi Ipekci. a
leading liberal newspaper editor. He is mentioned in
the indictment in connection with that slaying.
Agca, 23, who is called extremely intelligent and dan
gerous by Turkish officials who questioned him after
the Ipekci slaying, disappeared into the underground
despite warnings by Turkish police officials to Interpol

and European law enforcement agencies that he was at
large in Europe
The indictment describes the kind of world into
which other Turkish terrorists are said to have disap
peared. and thus should be of special interest to in
vestigators trying to piece together Agca's success at
wandering across Europe without being detected.
Youth group network
According to accounts now being printed almost dai
ly in the Turkish press from detailed reading of the
now-public document, the National Action Party
directed 129 youth groups, called Idealists, in Western
Europe. 87 of them in West Germany, where at least 1.2
million Turkish workers and political refugees live.
The indictment claims that fugitive Turkish political
assassins illegally obtained West German residence
permits through the Turkish Institute, which it says
was established by the Bonn government, but became
int iltrated by right-wing operatives.
The indictment identifies six other Idealist groups in
the Netherlands, seven in Belgium, three in France,
and one each in Austria and Switzerland. It alleges that
the party sought to organize Turkish workers in Europe
into an expatriate political force, a violation of Turkish
law.
The document traces 694 political killings to the par
ty while Turkes headed it and alleges that in the 970s
he converted party headquarters here into a terrorist
operations center with an arsenal bought with money

obtained trom donations by powerful Turkish busi
nessmen and extortion ot bars, casinos and small busi
nesses.
He also is accused of funneling hundreds of thousands
of West German marks obtained in donations from ex
patriate workers through a West German bank.
The party even may have received donations from
sympathizers in the United States, the indictment sug
gests. The document says probers found a money order
of unspecified amount drawn on a San Diego bank and
sent from a man in California. The money order con
tained a card trom "the Fascist National Party,"
which the probers wrote they believe is an organization
called the National Fascist Party in America.
These amounts of money are vast in a country where
the average annual income is $1200 a year. The indict
ment traces some of it directly to Agca's flight from
Turkey after slipping out of a maximum-security mili
tary prison with the help of some soldiers on Nov. 24,
1979.
The prosecutors say Agca was brought from fstanbul
by car to the capital, then moved to Erzurum in north
east Turkey, about 170 miles trom the Iranian border.
There, the indictment says, he was sheltered by a local
Idealist member who since has told authorities he re
ceived $1000 trom an Idealist association. He also said
he took Agca to a professional smuggler at a cof
feehouse near the frontier and that then Agca disap
peared.

It implies, however, that Agca had direct ties to the
feared Gray Wolves and obtained shadowy help from
the National Action Party in tleeing to Iran after his
November 1979 prison escape. Agca had been arrested
earlier that year for the assassination of Abdi Ipekci. a
leading liberal newspaper editor. He is mentioned in
the indictment in connection with that slaying.
Agca, 23, who is called extremely intelligent and dan
gerous by Turkish officials who questioned him after
the Ipekci slaying, disappeared into the underground
despite warnings by Turkish police officials to Interpol

and European law enforcement agencies that he was at
large in Europe
The indictment describes the kind of world into
which other Turkish terrorists are said to have disap
peared. and thus should be of special interest to in
vestigators trying to piece together Agca's success at
wandering across Europe without being detected.
Youth group network
According to accounts now being printed almost dai
ly in the Turkish press from detailed reading of the
now-public document, the National Action Party
directed 129 youth groups, called Idealists, in Western
Europe. 87 of them in West Germany, where at least 1.2
million Turkish workers and political refugees live.
The indictment claims that fugitive Turkish political
assassins illegally obtained West German residence
permits through the Turkish Institute, which it says
was established by the Bonn government, but became
int iltrated by right-wing operatives.
The indictment identifies six other Idealist groups in
the Netherlands, seven in Belgium, three in France,
and one each in Austria and Switzerland. It alleges that
the party sought to organize Turkish workers in Europe
into an expatriate political force, a violation of Turkish
law.
The document traces 694 political killings to the par
ty while Turkes headed it and alleges that in the 970s
he converted party headquarters here into a terrorist
operations center with an arsenal bought with money

obtained trom donations by powerful Turkish busi
nessmen and extortion ot bars, casinos and small busi
nesses.
He also is accused of funneling hundreds of thousands
of West German marks obtained in donations from ex
patriate workers through a West German bank.
The party even may have received donations from
sympathizers in the United States, the indictment sug
gests. The document says probers found a money order
of unspecified amount drawn on a San Diego bank and
sent from a man in California. The money order con
tained a card trom "the Fascist National Party,"
which the probers wrote they believe is an organization
called the National Fascist Party in America.
These amounts of money are vast in a country where
the average annual income is $1200 a year. The indict
ment traces some of it directly to Agca's flight from
Turkey after slipping out of a maximum-security mili
tary prison with the help of some soldiers on Nov. 24,
1979.
The prosecutors say Agca was brought from fstanbul
by car to the capital, then moved to Erzurum in north
east Turkey, about 170 miles trom the Iranian border.
There, the indictment says, he was sheltered by a local
Idealist member who since has told authorities he re
ceived $1000 trom an Idealist association. He also said
he took Agca to a professional smuggler at a cof
feehouse near the frontier and that then Agca disap
peared.

Ankara, Turkey — A massive investigation into Tur
key's major tar-right political party has suggested
ways how a fugitive Turkish terrorist such as Mehmet
Ali Agca, accused of shooting Pope John Paul II last
Wednesday, could find underground refuge in Western
Europe after escaping from prison here 8 months ago
The probe has led to a 945-page criminal indictment
against 587 leaders of the ultraconservative National
Action Party, whose militant Gray Wolves are blamed
tor many murders of leftists and liberals in the fac
tional strife that led to last September's military coup.
Submitted recently to the Turkish martial-law court
by seven military prosecutors after six months of ex
amining seized documents and interrogating im
prisoned party officials, the indictment makes no at
tempt to tocus on Agca or explain possible motives for
the alleged assassination attempt
Militant ties

feared Gray Wolves and obtained shadowy help from
