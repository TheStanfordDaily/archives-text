Service Special
Oil change, oil filter,
plus lubrication
Don't put off this important service work any longer.
Your old oil is drained from your engine, and replaced
with Shell Fire & 10W-40 motor oil. A new filter is
installed to trap harmful particles that may work their way
into the engine's mainstream.
Then your chassis is lubri
cated at all key points.
