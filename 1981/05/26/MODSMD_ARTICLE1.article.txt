# Card nine fall in regionals

### Steve Odell 
Austin, Tex. — It appeared for a
while that nothing would be able to
stop the Stanford baseball team from
achieving their ultimate goal of earn
ing a trip to the College World Series
this weekend at the NCAA Central Re
gional playoff.
Not flash floods. Not losing their
first game to Lamar, pitting the Cards
in a must win situation tor four
straight games. Not even the home
town Texas crowd which jammed
almsot 6000 screaming tans per game
into Disch-Falk field.
Finally, however, it was the com
bination of the latter two along with a
stand-out performance from a Texas
pitcher named Tony Arnold that put an
end to Stanford's most successful sea
son since 967.
Arnold shut out Stanford B'/a innings
in the final game ot the tournament to
lead fifth-ranked Texas to a 10-2 vic
tory and propelling them to a berth in
the college World Series.
Arnolds victory puts him at 17-0,
making him the winningest collegiate
pitcher this season. More important
ly, the victory earned him and the rest
of the Longhorns a plane ticket to
Omaha. The junior right hander had
plenty of support from his teammates
as Texas battered three Stanford
pitchers for 6 hits, six going for extra
bases.
Burk Goldthorn led the Texas at
tack going four for five with a double
and scoring three times in the finale.
"Hey, if we come out and play the way
we can, nobody's gonna beat us," he
said in a wet and jubilant locker room
after the game.
Stanford catcher Bill Worden was

impressed with Arnold's per
formance. "He came back tougher
than ever," he said, referring to the
only three days of rest for Arnold since
his 16th win, an 11-4 rout over Brigham
Young in the opening round. "Arnold
pitched a helluva game That sum it up
pretty well. If you don't hit, you aren't
going to win."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
echoed his senior receiver. "Arnold
pitched a fantastic game," he said. "I
think he was tougher than he was thre
days ago. I was really impressed with
the way he threw."
Marquess had nothing but praise for
his own team also, which finished the
season at 43-22. "It was a great, great
season for us," he said in retrospect.
"We lost our best pitcher (Brian
Mignano) the second weekend of the
league season, but the freshman guys
came through and our hitting really
picked up the last month or so. I told
our kids in there (the locker room)
that they could be proud of what they
had accomplished this year."
The Longhorns' big inning was the
sixth when they sent losing pitcher
Steve Cottrell (7-2) to the showers,
stringing together five consecutive
hits, they put four runs on the board to
give him what turned out to be an in
surmountable lead.
No two the same
Stanford experienced every pos
sible outcome of the spectrum in its
five games in Austin. The Cards were
blown out in the final game with Tex
as; won a slugfest in the ninth inning
earlier yesterday against the Long
horns; made their own killing Sunday
afternoon, trouncing Lamar 9-1;
pulled out a pitching duel 2-'. against
BYU Saturday; and lost a close of

fensive battle to Lamar, 6-5 to open
the tournament Friday
The opening round loss hurt the
Cards more than it might seem at
first. It put upon them the pressure of
having to win four in a row against top
twenty teams. It also meant the Cards
would have to play an extra game in
order to win the regional, meaning
less rest for the players and more
work for the pitching staff, which had
already problems in depth. And, as it
turned out, it meant they had to beat
the Longhorns who finished 16-9-1,
twice in a row in front of the home
town fans. It turned out to be a bit too
much.
The fans in Austin made quite a dif
ference, with people lining up 2V2
hours before game time for seats and
Longhorn officials having to turn
away as many as 500 fans per game.
The Texas afticionados packed their
stadium past capacity. "I'm very im
pressed with this crowd," said Mar
quess. "They're the best baseball
crowd I've seen in college. They can
play a big factor in the game. They're
like a tenth man on the field."
The only thing as dependable as the
hairy Texas tans was the performance
of John Elway. Had Stanford won the
regional, Elway all but had the tour
nament's MVP award wrapped up.
The sophomore right fielder went
eight for 18 at the plate, while keeping
enough runners honest to start a boy
scout troop. He also made the de
fensive play of the tournament, mak
ing a running over-the-shoulder snag
with his back to the infield to rob the
Longhorns' Larry Long of sure extra
bases.

ever, who triumphed 10-2 in the finale.
