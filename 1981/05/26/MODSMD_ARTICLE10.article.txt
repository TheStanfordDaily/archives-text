# The 						hidden lives of bees and deans
## Lyons reveals hobby — beekeeping 
### Tina Essey 
"It's not unusual to have
someone ask: 'Is there a spigot
on a bee-hive?' " Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons ex
plained. "Most people don't
know much about beekeeping. "
For this reason, Lyons, who
has kept three hives on the Stan
ford campus, and local
beekeeper Peter Stauffer, who
has six hives in Palo Alto, of
fered an insiders' view of the
hobby Tuesday evening in a
presentation sponsored by
STARTS. They discussed the
lite cycle and behavorial pat
terns, of bees shared anecdotes
from personal experiences, and
invited the audience to simple
"homemade honey."
Lyons' interest in beekeeping
began seven years ago when a
large oak tree in his backyard
needed to be removed. The tree
contained an enormous bee
hive, and nobody would touch it
unless the hive was extracted
beforehand. "I didn't have the
heart to kill them," Lyons said,
"so I decided to remove them
myself." He was fascinated by
the reading he did in prepara
tion for the project and the hive
became the first in his collec
tion.

It's not just tending the hives
that is so interesting to Lyons,
but the "bee literature" that ac
companies the hobby. "All
kinds of people keep bees," he
said. "The literature is a cross
between science and swap tales
like, 'I was treated to an early
morning sting today!' Lyons
quipped.
"Beekeeping is definitely a
lazy man's hobby, since the bees
do all the work," he said, "but it
is also a fascinating one — few
people realize how complex the
insects are."
The treatment of the larvae
determines which of the three
types of bees it will later be
come — a worker, drone, or
queen, the speakers explained.
The workers, 95 percent female,
take on different jobs as they
grow. They keep the hive clean,
tend the queen and her young,
scout pollen and transform it
into honey, build the combs, and
guard the hive from intruders.
The job of the drone is simply
to mate with the queen when she
leaves the hive, they said. Be
cause she is able to store the
sperm for five or six years, she
has only to leave once in her life
time. She spends the rest of her
time in the hive laying eggs.

According to Lyons, the hive
serves many purposes. It acts as
a food warehouse, an incubator
for the young, and a site for hon
ey production. Both Lyons and
Stauffer keep their bees in
"artificial hives," boxes with
vertically arranged wooden
frames, each containing wax
screens with wire reinforce
ments. The insects build upon
these screens, but if they are the
least bit irregular, they will not
be accepted.
A hive can easily house up to
80,i)(W bees and can exist in a va
riety of climates, although it
must be kept at a constant 97
degrees. In warmer areas,
workers bees act as "air condi
tioners," wiggling to circulate
the air. In cold areas, the honey
production is sped up to in
crease heat.
"One of the most interesting
things about the insects is the
way that they communicate
with one another," Stauffer
said. When a "scout" finds a
source of honey less than 00
yards from the hive, he'll return
with a sample and perform a
"dance" in a circular motion. If
the source is more than 100
yards from the colony, he'll do a
more specific "wiggling''

dance. The frequency of the wig
gle transmits the distance of the
source and its location in rela
tion to the sun, taking into ac
count the latter s seasonal
movement. Scouts will travel up
two miles in order to retrieve
pollen.
The insects are quite precise
in their actions. Lyons said.
"You can train a bee in seven to
ten days by putting a dab ot hon
ey on a dish, placing it in an ac
cessible location, and timing the
bee's daily visits. Eventually
the arrivals will be so precise,
you can set your watch by them,
and tell your friends: it's 6:00,
time to feed the bee!' The bee
will then arrive at exactly 6:00,
having compensated somehow
for the difference in the sun's
position," he said
Both Lyons and Stauffer wear
white jumpsuits, hats, and veils
when tending their hives. "Bees
are less incensed by light colors
than they are by dark,'' Stauffer
explains. Bears are the bees'
natural enemies, so when deal
ing with the insects you want to
look white and smooth and not
black and fuzzy, to avoid getting
stung."
Dean Lyons is allergic to bee
stings. "Some people with al
lergies get more affected as
they're repeatedly stung, some
get less. Fortunately, I've got
ten less receptive."
The cost of a basic "kit" — a
hive with a cover, wax founda
tions, bee veil, gloves, a smoker
to pacify the bees before remov
ing the honey, and a hive tool to
lift out the frames can easily
add to $150, but the rewards eas
ily outweigh the cost, according
to the keepers.
"You can easily extract 60-70
lbs. ot honey from a strong
hive," Stauffer explains, "I re
move it twice a year, with the
bulk coming in the fall after the
honey flow is over . . . I've got a
garage full of it!"
Besides the fascination of
working with the insects, the
hobby holds other rewards.
Though the wax makes ex
cellent candles, as Stauffer ex
plains, the honey is the top
prize.
