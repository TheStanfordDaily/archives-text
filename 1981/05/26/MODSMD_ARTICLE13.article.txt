# Screenwriting fellows selected
## 
### Karen Johnson 
Many people dream of being
paid to write fiction. But for
three students in Stanford's
graduate film program that
dream has come true.
Margaret Barnett. Lisa Sonne
and Paige Konrad have been
chosen to receive the Nicholl
Fellowships, awards that will
allow them to spend the next full
year writing screenplays.
The fellowships will give each
of the three women approx

imately $680) for a 12 month pe
riod. They will not be enrolled in
any classes and their time will
be devoted to writing, watching
movies and participating in in
formal discussion groups once a
week.
The three women were
chosen out of six entries by a
panel of judges that included
Henry Breitrose, chairman of
the communicatioh depart
ment, Julian Blaustein, director
of the film and T.V. production
center, and Martin Esslin. a
professor in the drama depart
ment. The three other judges
were Doree Allen, Maria Gar
giulo and William Waldner, who
were the recipients of the fel
lowships last year.
The Nicholl Fellowship
awards are only in their second
year. They are part of an at
tempt to use money from the de
partment to encourage qualified
students in the study of
screenwriting. The communica
tion department will also be of
fering a new master's program
next year in screenwriting.
Money trom the fund will be
used for this new program as
well.
Blaustein said that the
number of people who applied
for the fellowships this year was
low. This is probably because
only graduate students enrolled
in the communication depart
ment are permitted to apply.
Blaustein said he would like to
see the program opened up to
other departments in the future,
such as the English department
and the drama department.
According to Margaret
Barnett, the goal of the program

is that each ot the fellows com
plete a feature-length
screenplay by the end ot the
year this doesn't affect the fel
lowship in any way.
Both Konrad and Barnett
came to Stanford for the first
time last fall, although neither
ot them is a stranger to the Bay
Area.
Barnett was born and raised
in Berkeley, and graduate trom
San Francisco State with a
degree in French literature.
Barnett says that she's always
enjoyed writing and when she
took up photography a short
while ago, the film program at
Stanford seemed a good way to
combine her interests and tal
ents.
Konrad went to Mills College
in Oakland and then lived in Los
Angeles before returning to the
Bay Area six years ago with her
husband and two children.
Before coming to Stanford she
had been a painter and a com
mercial photographer, but she
was not happy in those pro
fessions and decided to try the
Stanford film program. She
says that she hasn't written any
fiction since her junior year in
college, when she was told by a
teacher that she couldn't write.
She's very happy to have won
the award because "I have so
many stories inside myselt ."
Sonne did her undergraduate
work at Stanford and graduated
in 1978 with a degree in journal
ism. After graduation she went
into arts management and
worked as a project director for
the American Conservatory
Theater in San Francisco.
