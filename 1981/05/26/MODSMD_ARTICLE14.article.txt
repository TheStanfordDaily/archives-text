## Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann Libyan leader threat to world peace 
### 
Americans were surprised re
cently when the Reagan admin
istration expelled Libya's
diplomats from the United
States. Hopefully this was the
first step, long overdue, in put
ting pressure on Libya to stop
training and supporting ter
rorists. Libya is not only a
threat to world peace because of
its support for terrorism but
also because ot its alliance and
arms building with the Soviet
Union. Furthermore, Libya
threatens its immediate neigh
bors, Tunisia, Egypt, Chad and
the Sudan.
Colonel Muammar Qaddafi
seized power in 1969 from King
Idris. When Libya struck oil he
suddenly had a billion dollars a
month to spend. And spend it he
did on terrorism and arms
purchases.
Qaddafi is the paymaster of
the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO). He provided
the arms, funds and training for
the massacre of Israelis at the
1972 Olympics. Qaddafi also
provides arms, money and
training for virtually every rev
olutionary group in the world.

He now underwrites Castro's
new drive in Latin America; he
pays for the Polisario's war
against Morocco. He has sup
ported. among others, the Sand
inistas ot Nicaragua, Uruguay's
Tupamaros. the Red Brigade of
Italy and the I.R.A. Pro
visionals. He has financed as
sassination teams to kill
conservative Arab leaders.
Numeiry of the Sudan has had 2
attempts made on his life.
The major present threat
from Qaddafi is his training
camps for terrorists. East Ger
mans, Cubans and Soviets train
nationals trom various for
eigners who are in these death
schools in Libya.
Qaddafi has put together an
African foreign legion (about
700 men) to destabilize Black
Africa and perhaps to help him
create a Libyan Empire in
Africa. He already had con
quered Chad and threatens
Mauritania through his agents,
the Polisario and Niger.
Once trained, the terrorists
get money, weapons and false
passports and then leave to
spread revolution throughout

the world. Western European
states, afraid of offending Qad
dafi and losing his oil, have done
little to protect their citizens
trom the terrorists. Numerous
terrorists have Jbeen let free on
legal technicalities or allowed
to escape to avoid the embar
rassment or danger of trials.
Qaddafi threatens world
peace also by providing to Sovi
ets air and naval bases and facil
ities for storing massive
amounts of arms. Since '.969
Libya has sent 12 billion dollars
to the Soviet Union. By 1980 the
Soviets had supplied Libya with
2800 tanks. 7000 armored vehi
cles, several hundred M.I.G.s
and bombers. 25 missile
launching naval craft and the
fearsome Scud missile. In addi
tion, 12,000 Soviet. Cuban and
North Korean military advisers
came along with the arms and
ran most of the technically ad
vanced equipment and missile
systems.
The Soviets operate regular
intelligence and surveillance
flights in the eastern Mediter
ranean. Soviet bases in Libya,
the airfields and equipment, and

communist military techni
cians have tipped the balance in
the Mediterranean in tavor of
the Soviets. The admiral in
charge of NATO's naval
forces claims he could not sur
vive one week against the power
of Soviet forces in Libya.
What should we do about this
triple threat to world peace and
Western security? We should
immediately bolster the de
fense of Libya's neighbors then
train guerrillas to cause trouble
in Chad. We should adopt the
same tactics as Qaddafi â€” train
Libyan dissidents to endanger
his regime. Egypt and the Sudan
should be encouraged to take a
strong line toward Qaddafi next
time he threatens them. Per
haps Israeli intelligence might
cooperate in a new anti-Libyan
campaign. But something has to
be done to cope with the new
Fuhrer. The common good of
humanity calls for his unseating
or his demise.
