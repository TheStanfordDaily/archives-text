# Jews forced Arabs to flee Israel in 1948
## 
### 
Every year, as surely as the
seasons roll around, someone
writes a column for the Daily
repeating the myth that the Ar
abs who fled Israel in 1948 had
been urged to leave by their own
leaders. Susan Coskey repeated
the myth in her column (Daily,
May 21).
It might be comforting for
some to believe that over 500,000
people abandoned their busi

nesses, farms, orchards, and all
their possessions, to go into
homeless exile simply because
they were told to do so. But this
explanation is untrue.
According to Christopher
Sykes, in his book Crossroads to
Israel: "The monitoring of Ara
bic broadcasts and the Arabic
press of the time have been
searched in vain for official ex
hortation ot any kind . . . Terror

was the impulse for the exodus,
by hearsay most often and
sometimes by experience." The
"experience" Sykes referred to
was the ruthlessness of Jewish
soldiers against civilians in
some Arab towns and villages
during the fighting of 1947-48.
Sometimes the attacks were
made by the Haganah, the of
ficial Jewish army, but more
often by the Irgun terrorist or
ganization headed by Men
achem Begin.
The climax of Irguns terror
campaign came in April 1948,
when the organization attacked
the village of Deir Yassin,
whose inhabitants were re
portedly neutral. The raiders
went through the village sys
tematically shooting everything
that moved and dynamiting the
buildings. After the assault rep
resentatives of the Red Cross
found corpses ot 254 men, wom
en, and children. The village
was a smoking ruin. In his auto
biography, The Revolt, Begin
himself claims that after Deir
Yassin "panic overwhelmed the
Arabs of Eretz Israel . . . the
Arabs began to flee in terror
even before they clashed with
Jewish forces."
J. Bowyer Bell, in his book
Terror Out of Zion, confirms

Begins claim: "When the
Haganah offensive began early
in April, coupled with the news
from Deir Yassin, the Arabs, re
gardless of their leaders' inten
tions or the issues of the mo
ment, began to flee because
they were afraid of the Jews.''
Coskey is right that when the
Haganah captured Haifa (a
week after the massacre at Deir
Yassin) the Jewish authorities
sincerely tried to persuade the
Arab residents to stay. Never
theless, reports from other
cities and towns apparently con
vinced even the Arabs of Haifa
to flee. It remains a fact that
Arab leaders were not respon
sible for the exodus, although
afterwards some claimed that
they were. The myth is kept
alive primarily to justify Is
rael's continued refusal to per
mit Palestinians to return to
their homes.
There is a desperate need for
a solution to the Arab-Israeli
conflict that will permit both Is
raelis and Palestinians to live in
peace and mutual dignity. Per
sistent distortion of past history
only makes such a solution more
difficult to achieve.
