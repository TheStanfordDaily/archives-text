## Disarmed by the Third World 
### 
As the chance of the two nuclear superpowers
ever voluntarily controlling their own arms be
comes increasingly slim, some analysts have
begun to argue that the movement of the "non
aligned" nations (NAN s) holds key "carrots"
and "sticks" that might force the superpower
"horses" into disarmament. Some eighty nations
strong, the NAN s well-represent the world's pop
ulation. command the worlds resources (in par
ticular, most ot the minerals the U.S. deems of
"strategic" importance), and espouse the ru
diments of an emerging egalitarian morality. Ori
ginally active in OPEC and the Law of the Sea
Conference, the NAN s have become increasingly
influential in other areas of global politics includ
ing arms control. Their simple, forceful view is
that the real threat to international security is a
Soviet/American conspiracy to maintain their
global dominance through their arms race.
One obvious carrot the NAN s could wield
would be a large publicity campaign within the
U.S. While various United Nations groups such as
the Center for Disarmament and the non-gov
ernmental organizations have compiled im
pressive written materials on the arms race, they
have failed to distribute them widely or to trans
late them into the mass media. A multi-million
dollar marriage of the U.N. and Madison Avenue
might be a powerful counter to such well-financed
cold warriors as the $4 million per year campaign
of the Committee on the Present Danger.
Imagine the impact of a hundred nations put
ting a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal ev
ery day for five years: "Please Disarm for Our
Survival." It would help obliterate a fallacious
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy — that some
how its nuclear "umbrella" is "protecting" the
world.
E.P. Thompson has emphasized that the suc
cesses of the European Nuclear Disarmament
movement owes much to "increasing stress on
lateral communication, on transcontinental (as
well as transatlantic) exchanges between special
ist groups: universities, scientists, doctors, re
ligious bodies, or trade unions." Exposing U.S.
citizens to the diversity of international opinions
both by disseminating international writings and
by touring international speakers might signifi
cantly help temper nationalistic cries tor military
buildups.
Professor Hal Fieveson of Princeton has sug
gested another possible NAN carrot — more vig
orous nuclear power safeguards agreements. The
U.S. has long wanted to close some of the
"loopholes" in its agreements with individual
NAN s to aid in their development of "peaceful"
nuclear reactors, by having, for example, the
NAN s promise neither to reprocess spent fuel nor
to enrich natural uranium — two activities which
could bring a non-nuclear nations close to building
a nuclear weapon. The NAN s could thus use these
promises as levers by promising, for exartiple, to
accept safeguards only if the superpowers con
clude a comprehensive test ban.
Positive pressures, however, may not be strong
enough to overcome three significant barriers to
disarmament: first, the vested interests like the
Lockheeds and Rockwells that keep pro-arms
race politicians in power; second, the sovereignty
stalwarts that refuse to surrender any national
power to an international inspection authority;
and third, the conservative proponents of in
egalitarian foreign policies that are convinced
that the rest of the world should be "just like us"
and who are willing to fight to ensure that even El
Salvadoransdrink Coca Cola.
It is interesting to note that when people in
timately involved in arms control are cornered
about just what they think might turn around
these anti-disarmament forces, they confess their
hope for some small but horrible nuclear war,
preferably (ot course) in the Third World. Such a
war would indeed make clear that every nuclear
weapon, not only the communist ones, is a threat
to human civilization. But there is no way we
could ensure that even a small war would not es
calate into Nuclear War I. This cynical "hope"
underscores a widely (but quietly) held per
ception that only some threat that will capture
global media attention may motivate the public at
large into demanding disarmament.
One possible electrifying threat might be for
the NAN s to give the superpowers the following
ultimatum: "Either you dismantle 90 percent of

your nuclear weapons in the next ten years, or we
all promise to go nuclear ourselves!" Actually,
NAN s need not go so far. Most of them are parties
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in
which they agreed not to obtain nuclear weapons.
Thus, NAN s need not promise to "go nuclear;"
they need only to threaten to rescind their agree
ment not to do so unless the superpowers reach
significant arms control measures immediately.
While this proposal seems both unrealistic and
risky, it actually has several key attractions.
Regarding its realism, no proposed solution —
whether SALT or the previously mentioned
positive pressures — is completely realistic in the
sense of being likely to work. Unlike the other ap
proaches, however, a global threat to repudiate
the NPT would be a newsworthy event that would
shake the superpower publics out of their current
complacency.
Despite all of the issues that divide the NAN s,
one on which they are united is that the super
powers ought to disarm. NAN s might ultimately
embrace this proposal tor three reasons: the re
gime might allow diversion of global military
spending into the non-nuclear world's develop
ment; it would increase the non-nuclear world's
political and military power vis-a-vis the super
powers; and it would allow the non-nuclear world
greater control over its own survival.
The major risk of this proposal is that the super
powers might either deem the NAN s threats bluff
or retaliate harshly. Indeed, it such threats did
not result in superpower disarmament, they could
eventuate in more proliferation and greater risk
of nuclear war. But is this risk really greater than
the world's present suicide course?
At the NPT Review Conference, last Septem
ber, some NAN s spoke openly of repudiating the
treaty if the superpowers do not begin disarming.
Instead of sabotaging the treaty in despair, guar
anteeing the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weap
ons, NAN s can at least try to make their repudia
tions constructive and forceful forces for dis
armament. Moreover, compared to the risks of a
small nuclear war (the leading "hope" tor dis
arming the world.) The risks of this proposal
seem modest.
On a recent visit to New York, I discussed these
possible actions with nine non-nuclear nation del
egations and other prominent members of the
United Nations community. I discovered that, for
now, the NAN s are only prepared to pursue the
carrots. They are cautious about using the sticks
because of their belief that President Reagan,
while ostensibly against arms control, will replay
President Nixon's dance with detente and ul
timately deliver a strong, new SALT accord. They
did not seem to appreciate, however, the impor
tant differences between Reagan and Nixon, evi
denced primarily in their surrogates: Secretary
of State Haig ("there are worse things than nucle-'
ar war") and Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency Director Walt Rostow (ot Vietnam fame)
are much more Russophobic and bellicose than
their Nixon counterparts (Bill Rogers and Fred
Ikle). If Reagan plunges the U.S. into a new, ex
pensive arms race and fails to secure any mean
ingful arms control pact by the 1985 NPT Review
Conference, as most observers expect, the com
placent NAN s may then be ready for more radi
cal actions.
Meanwhile, the NAN s are preparing for the
Second U.N. Special Session on Disarmament in
June of 1982. This event is a critical opportunity
for the NAN s to begin coordinating their efforts
more aggressively and visibly; while these na
tions have caucused together on arms control
before, they do not as yet have a name, a secretar
iat, an office, a constitution, or an agenda.
The Special Session also presents an important
opportunity for disarmament factions in the U.S.
to link up with the NAN s. We can plan to ensure
that the press and media do not ignore this event
as they ignored the first Special Session in T . 979.
We would be wise to speak with NAN represent
atives while they are in New York, to open chan
nels ot communication, and to begin a more per
manent working relationship with the NAN s. A
coordinated effort of American disarmament
groups and NAN s, pressuring the U.S. both from
within and without, may be one of the real keys to
disarming the two nuclear superpowers.

are much more Russophobic and bellicose than
their Nixon counterparts (Bill Rogers and Fred

As the chance of the two nuclear superpowers
ever voluntarily controlling their own arms be
comes increasingly slim, some analysts have
begun to argue that the movement of the "non
aligned" nations (NAN s) holds key "carrots"
and "sticks" that might force the superpower
"horses" into disarmament. Some eighty nations
strong, the NAN s well-represent the world's pop
ulation. command the worlds resources (in par
ticular, most ot the minerals the U.S. deems of
"strategic" importance), and espouse the ru
diments of an emerging egalitarian morality. Ori
ginally active in OPEC and the Law of the Sea
Conference, the NAN s have become increasingly
influential in other areas of global politics includ
ing arms control. Their simple, forceful view is
that the real threat to international security is a
Soviet/American conspiracy to maintain their
global dominance through their arms race.
One obvious carrot the NAN s could wield
would be a large publicity campaign within the
U.S. While various United Nations groups such as
the Center for Disarmament and the non-gov
ernmental organizations have compiled im
pressive written materials on the arms race, they
have failed to distribute them widely or to trans
late them into the mass media. A multi-million
dollar marriage of the U.N. and Madison Avenue
might be a powerful counter to such well-financed
cold warriors as the $4 million per year campaign
of the Committee on the Present Danger.
Imagine the impact of a hundred nations put
ting a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal ev
ery day for five years: "Please Disarm for Our
Survival." It would help obliterate a fallacious
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy — that some
how its nuclear "umbrella" is "protecting" the
world.
E.P. Thompson has emphasized that the suc

movement owes much to "increasing stress on

ligious bodies, or trade unions." Exposing U.S.
citizens to the diversity of international opinions
both by disseminating international writings and
by touring international speakers might signifi
cantly help temper nationalistic cries tor military
buildups.
Professor Hal Fieveson of Princeton has sug
gested another possible NAN carrot — more vig
orous nuclear power safeguards agreements. The
U.S. has long wanted to close some of the
"loopholes" in its agreements with individual
NAN s to aid in their development of "peaceful"
nuclear reactors, by having, for example, the
NAN s promise neither to reprocess spent fuel nor
to enrich natural uranium — two activities which
could bring a non-nuclear nations close to building
a nuclear weapon. The NAN s could thus use these
promises as levers by promising, for exartiple, to
accept safeguards only if the superpowers con
clude a comprehensive test ban.
Positive pressures, however, may not be strong
enough to overcome three significant barriers to
disarmament: first, the vested interests like the
Lockheeds and Rockwells that keep pro-arms
race politicians in power; second, the sovereignty
stalwarts that refuse to surrender any national
power to an international inspection authority;
and third, the conservative proponents of in
egalitarian foreign policies that are convinced
that the rest of the world should be "just like us"
and who are willing to fight to ensure that even El
Salvadoransdrink Coca Cola.
It is interesting to note that when people in
timately involved in arms control are cornered
about just what they think might turn around
these anti-disarmament forces, they confess their
hope for some small but horrible nuclear war,
preferably (ot course) in the Third World. Such a
war would indeed make clear that every nuclear
weapon, not only the communist ones, is a threat
to human civilization. But there is no way we
could ensure that even a small war would not es
calate into Nuclear War I. This cynical "hope"
underscores a widely (but quietly) held per
ception that only some threat that will capture
global media attention may motivate the public at
large into demanding disarmament.
One possible electrifying threat might be for
the NAN s to give the superpowers the following
ultimatum: "Either you dismantle 90 percent of

your nuclear weapons in the next ten years, or we
all promise to go nuclear ourselves!" Actually,
NAN s need not go so far. Most of them are parties
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in
which they agreed not to obtain nuclear weapons.
Thus, NAN s need not promise to "go nuclear;"
they need only to threaten to rescind their agree
ment not to do so unless the superpowers reach
significant arms control measures immediately.
While this proposal seems both unrealistic and
risky, it actually has several key attractions.
Regarding its realism, no proposed solution —
whether SALT or the previously mentioned
positive pressures — is completely realistic in the
sense of being likely to work. Unlike the other ap
proaches, however, a global threat to repudiate
the NPT would be a newsworthy event that would
shake the superpower publics out of their current
complacency.
Despite all of the issues that divide the NAN s,
one on which they are united is that the super
powers ought to disarm. NAN s might ultimately
embrace this proposal tor three reasons: the re
gime might allow diversion of global military
spending into the non-nuclear world's develop
ment; it would increase the non-nuclear world's
political and military power vis-a-vis the super
powers; and it would allow the non-nuclear world
greater control over its own survival.
The major risk of this proposal is that the super
powers might either deem the NAN s threats bluff
or retaliate harshly. Indeed, it such threats did
not result in superpower disarmament, they could
eventuate in more proliferation and greater risk
of nuclear war. But is this risk really greater than
the world's present suicide course?
At the NPT Review Conference, last Septem
ber, some NAN s spoke openly of repudiating the
treaty if the superpowers do not begin disarming.
Instead of sabotaging the treaty in despair, guar
anteeing the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weap
ons, NAN s can at least try to make their repudia
tions constructive and forceful forces for dis
armament. Moreover, compared to the risks of a
small nuclear war (the leading "hope" tor dis
arming the world.) The risks of this proposal
seem modest.
On a recent visit to New York, I discussed these
possible actions with nine non-nuclear nation del
egations and other prominent members of the
United Nations community. I discovered that, for
now, the NAN s are only prepared to pursue the
carrots. They are cautious about using the sticks
because of their belief that President Reagan,
while ostensibly against arms control, will replay
President Nixon's dance with detente and ul
timately deliver a strong, new SALT accord. They
did not seem to appreciate, however, the impor
tant differences between Reagan and Nixon, evi
denced primarily in their surrogates: Secretary
of State Haig ("there are worse things than nucle-'

Agency Director Walt Rostow (ot Vietnam fame)

one on which they are united is that the super
powers ought to disarm. NAN s might ultimately
embrace this proposal tor three reasons: the re
gime might allow diversion of global military
spending into the non-nuclear world's develop
ment; it would increase the non-nuclear world's
political and military power vis-a-vis the super
powers; and it would allow the non-nuclear world
greater control over its own survival.
The major risk of this proposal is that the super
powers might either deem the NAN s threats bluff
or retaliate harshly. Indeed, it such threats did
not result in superpower disarmament, they could
eventuate in more proliferation and greater risk
of nuclear war. But is this risk really greater than
the world's present suicide course?
At the NPT Review Conference, last Septem
ber, some NAN s spoke openly of repudiating the
treaty if the superpowers do not begin disarming.
Instead of sabotaging the treaty in despair, guar
anteeing the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weap
ons, NAN s can at least try to make their repudia
tions constructive and forceful forces for dis
armament. Moreover, compared to the risks of a
small nuclear war (the leading "hope" tor dis
arming the world.) The risks of this proposal
seem modest.
On a recent visit to New York, I discussed these
possible actions with nine non-nuclear nation del
egations and other prominent members of the
United Nations community. I discovered that, for
now, the NAN s are only prepared to pursue the
carrots. They are cautious about using the sticks
because of their belief that President Reagan,
while ostensibly against arms control, will replay
President Nixon's dance with detente and ul
timately deliver a strong, new SALT accord. They
did not seem to appreciate, however, the impor
tant differences between Reagan and Nixon, evi
denced primarily in their surrogates: Secretary
of State Haig ("there are worse things than nucle-'
ar war") and Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency Director Walt Rostow (ot Vietnam fame)
are much more Russophobic and bellicose than
their Nixon counterparts (Bill Rogers and Fred
Ikle). If Reagan plunges the U.S. into a new, ex
pensive arms race and fails to secure any mean
ingful arms control pact by the 1985 NPT Review
Conference, as most observers expect, the com
placent NAN s may then be ready for more radi
cal actions.
Meanwhile, the NAN s are preparing for the
Second U.N. Special Session on Disarmament in
June of 1982. This event is a critical opportunity
for the NAN s to begin coordinating their efforts
more aggressively and visibly; while these na
tions have caucused together on arms control
before, they do not as yet have a name, a secretar
iat, an office, a constitution, or an agenda.
The Special Session also presents an important
opportunity for disarmament factions in the U.S.
to link up with the NAN s. We can plan to ensure
that the press and media do not ignore this event
as they ignored the first Special Session in T . 979.
We would be wise to speak with NAN represent
atives while they are in New York, to open chan
nels ot communication, and to begin a more per
manent working relationship with the NAN s. A
coordinated effort of American disarmament
groups and NAN s, pressuring the U.S. both from
within and without, may be one of the real keys to
disarming the two nuclear superpowers.

As the chance of the two nuclear superpowers
ever voluntarily controlling their own arms be
comes increasingly slim, some analysts have
begun to argue that the movement of the "non
aligned" nations (NAN s) holds key "carrots"
and "sticks" that might force the superpower
"horses" into disarmament. Some eighty nations
strong, the NAN s well-represent the world's pop
ulation. command the worlds resources (in par
ticular, most ot the minerals the U.S. deems of
"strategic" importance), and espouse the ru
diments of an emerging egalitarian morality. Ori
ginally active in OPEC and the Law of the Sea
Conference, the NAN s have become increasingly
influential in other areas of global politics includ
ing arms control. Their simple, forceful view is
that the real threat to international security is a
Soviet/American conspiracy to maintain their
global dominance through their arms race.
One obvious carrot the NAN s could wield
would be a large publicity campaign within the
U.S. While various United Nations groups such as
the Center for Disarmament and the non-gov
ernmental organizations have compiled im
pressive written materials on the arms race, they
have failed to distribute them widely or to trans
late them into the mass media. A multi-million
dollar marriage of the U.N. and Madison Avenue
might be a powerful counter to such well-financed
cold warriors as the $4 million per year campaign
of the Committee on the Present Danger.
Imagine the impact of a hundred nations put
ting a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal ev
ery day for five years: "Please Disarm for Our
Survival." It would help obliterate a fallacious
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy — that some
how its nuclear "umbrella" is "protecting" the
world.
E.P. Thompson has emphasized that the suc
cesses of the European Nuclear Disarmament
movement owes much to "increasing stress on
lateral communication, on transcontinental (as
well as transatlantic) exchanges between special
ist groups: universities, scientists, doctors, re
ligious bodies, or trade unions." Exposing U.S.
citizens to the diversity of international opinions
both by disseminating international writings and
by touring international speakers might signifi
cantly help temper nationalistic cries tor military
buildups.
Professor Hal Fieveson of Princeton has sug
gested another possible NAN carrot — more vig
orous nuclear power safeguards agreements. The
U.S. has long wanted to close some of the
"loopholes" in its agreements with individual
NAN s to aid in their development of "peaceful"
nuclear reactors, by having, for example, the
NAN s promise neither to reprocess spent fuel nor
to enrich natural uranium — two activities which
could bring a non-nuclear nations close to building
a nuclear weapon. The NAN s could thus use these
promises as levers by promising, for exartiple, to
accept safeguards only if the superpowers con
clude a comprehensive test ban.
Positive pressures, however, may not be strong
enough to overcome three significant barriers to
disarmament: first, the vested interests like the
Lockheeds and Rockwells that keep pro-arms
race politicians in power; second, the sovereignty
stalwarts that refuse to surrender any national
power to an international inspection authority;
and third, the conservative proponents of in
egalitarian foreign policies that are convinced
that the rest of the world should be "just like us"
and who are willing to fight to ensure that even El
Salvadoransdrink Coca Cola.
It is interesting to note that when people in
timately involved in arms control are cornered
about just what they think might turn around
these anti-disarmament forces, they confess their
hope for some small but horrible nuclear war,
preferably (ot course) in the Third World. Such a
war would indeed make clear that every nuclear
weapon, not only the communist ones, is a threat
to human civilization. But there is no way we
could ensure that even a small war would not es
calate into Nuclear War I. This cynical "hope"
underscores a widely (but quietly) held per
ception that only some threat that will capture
global media attention may motivate the public at
large into demanding disarmament.
One possible electrifying threat might be for
the NAN s to give the superpowers the following
ultimatum: "Either you dismantle 90 percent of

your nuclear weapons in the next ten years, or we
all promise to go nuclear ourselves!" Actually,
NAN s need not go so far. Most of them are parties
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in
which they agreed not to obtain nuclear weapons.
Thus, NAN s need not promise to "go nuclear;"
they need only to threaten to rescind their agree
ment not to do so unless the superpowers reach
significant arms control measures immediately.
While this proposal seems both unrealistic and
risky, it actually has several key attractions.
Regarding its realism, no proposed solution —
whether SALT or the previously mentioned
positive pressures — is completely realistic in the
sense of being likely to work. Unlike the other ap
proaches, however, a global threat to repudiate
the NPT would be a newsworthy event that would
shake the superpower publics out of their current
complacency.
Despite all of the issues that divide the NAN s,
one on which they are united is that the super
powers ought to disarm. NAN s might ultimately
embrace this proposal tor three reasons: the re
gime might allow diversion of global military
spending into the non-nuclear world's develop
ment; it would increase the non-nuclear world's
political and military power vis-a-vis the super
powers; and it would allow the non-nuclear world
greater control over its own survival.
The major risk of this proposal is that the super
powers might either deem the NAN s threats bluff
or retaliate harshly. Indeed, it such threats did
not result in superpower disarmament, they could
eventuate in more proliferation and greater risk
of nuclear war. But is this risk really greater than
the world's present suicide course?
