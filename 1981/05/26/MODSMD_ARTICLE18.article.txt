Law school dean
We, the undersigned Stanford
Law School students, strongly
object to your choice of students
to serve on the Law School Dean
Search Committee. We believe
that the student representatives
were not chosen in a fair and
public manner and do not repre
sent the variety of student opin
ion on the needs of the Law
School.
In particular, the students
were chosen without any con
sultation with student groups.
Nor was there any public solic
itation of nominees. Only on
Monday, May U, more than two
weeks after their selection,
were we notified that there
would even be students on the
committee, much less their
identity. This contrasts sharply
with the open process which
governed student participation
in your selection last year.
It is totally unpersuasive that
the students were chosen in ac
cordance with "tradition." This
"tradition" arose merely from
the one prior case of student
participation on the Law School
Dean Search Committee. One
instance does not establish
"tradition," nor does it demon
strate the rationality or wisdom
of this procedure.
The unfortunate conse
quences of this non-public proc
ess are manifest. The students
chosen do not represent the
broad range of interests and
backgrounds at the Law School.
Unrepresented are such per
spectives as clinical education,
women's issues, public interest
law, community involvement,
non-Law Review research and
writing activities, and alter

native career choices. It is par
ticularly offensive that, in light
of the increasing importance
and contributions of women in
the legal profession and at the
Law School, there is no woman
student on the committee. Two
male Law Review members
cannot speak on behalf of law
students in so important a mat
ter as the choice of a new dean.
We therefore strongly urge
you to reconsider your choice of
students tor the Search Com
mittee. We think that the follow
ing process is fairer, more open,
and will result in a more repre
sentative choice of student com
mittee members. A committee
representing all Law School stu
dent organizations should meet
and consider interested stu
dents, recommending at least
two nominees to you for appoint
ment to the committee.
We share your concern tor the
future of legal education at
Stanford Law School. We hope
you agree that the Law School
can only benefit from mean
ingful student participation in
the selection of a new dean.

Counter attack
In response to the criticisms
leveled at Michael Weiss's col
umn by Teresa Butzerin and
Molly Durfee (Daily, May 20) I
can only say that they display
precisely the attitude to which
Weiss refers.
I find it most difficult to be
lieve that any reader of Weiss's
column (Daily, May 14) could

fail to see that the piece was
written with "tongue planted
firmly "irt cheek" rather than as
a malicious and misogynistic at
tack against all female Stanford
students. If nothing else, the
tone of the article should have
given some indication, to say
nothing of the fact that the re
marks about Stanford women
occupied only one paragraph of
a full article.
By assuming so easily that
any attack against "Stanford
women," however obviously in
jest, deserves a serious reply in
the vein of an offended party,
these two contribute to the for
mation of just the sort of at
titude they claim to reject,
namely the sort of woman
portrayed in Weiss's article.
It is unfair and hypocritical
on their part to accuse Weiss of
"crude (and) rude remarks"
while proceeding to assert that
he expects Stanford women to
"kiss ass" and of "ejaculating
(!) such abusive and asinine
slurs toward women."
I strongly suggest that if
Butzerin and Durfee really wish
to reply to Weiss's article they
should do so in kind — retaining
a sense of humor and an ability
to look at things a bit more ob
jectively. Instead, they chose to
exemplify the very lack of un
derstanding which Weiss is
trying to portray.

In response to the criticisms
leveled at Michael Weiss's col
umn by Teresa Butzerin and
Molly Durfee (Daily, May 20) I
can only say that they display
precisely the attitude to which
Weiss refers.
I find it most difficult to be
lieve that any reader of Weiss's
column (Daily, May 14) could

fail to see that the piece was
written with "tongue planted
firmly "irt cheek" rather than as
a malicious and misogynistic at
tack against all female Stanford
students. If nothing else, the
tone of the article should have
given some indication, to say
nothing of the fact that the re
marks about Stanford women
occupied only one paragraph of
a full article.
By assuming so easily that
any attack against "Stanford
women," however obviously in
jest, deserves a serious reply in
the vein of an offended party,
these two contribute to the for
mation of just the sort of at
titude they claim to reject,
namely the sort of woman
portrayed in Weiss's article.
It is unfair and hypocritical
on their part to accuse Weiss of
"crude (and) rude remarks"
while proceeding to assert that
he expects Stanford women to
"kiss ass" and of "ejaculating
(!) such abusive and asinine
slurs toward women."
I strongly suggest that if
Butzerin and Durfee really wish
to reply to Weiss's article they
should do so in kind — retaining
a sense of humor and an ability
to look at things a bit more ob
jectively. Instead, they chose to
exemplify the very lack of un
derstanding which Weiss is
trying to portray.

Law school dean
We, the undersigned Stanford
Law School students, strongly
object to your choice of students
to serve on the Law School Dean
Search Committee. We believe
that the student representatives
were not chosen in a fair and
public manner and do not repre
sent the variety of student opin
ion on the needs of the Law
School.
In particular, the students
were chosen without any con
sultation with student groups.
Nor was there any public solic
itation of nominees. Only on
Monday, May U, more than two
weeks after their selection,
were we notified that there
would even be students on the
committee, much less their
identity. This contrasts sharply
with the open process which
governed student participation
in your selection last year.
It is totally unpersuasive that
the students were chosen in ac
cordance with "tradition." This
"tradition" arose merely from
the one prior case of student
participation on the Law School
Dean Search Committee. One
instance does not establish
"tradition," nor does it demon
strate the rationality or wisdom
of this procedure.
The unfortunate conse
quences of this non-public proc
ess are manifest. The students
chosen do not represent the
broad range of interests and
backgrounds at the Law School.
Unrepresented are such per
spectives as clinical education,
women's issues, public interest
law, community involvement,
non-Law Review research and
writing activities, and alter

native career choices. It is par
ticularly offensive that, in light
of the increasing importance
and contributions of women in
the legal profession and at the
Law School, there is no woman
student on the committee. Two
male Law Review members
cannot speak on behalf of law
students in so important a mat
ter as the choice of a new dean.
We therefore strongly urge
you to reconsider your choice of
students tor the Search Com
mittee. We think that the follow
ing process is fairer, more open,
and will result in a more repre
sentative choice of student com
mittee members. A committee
representing all Law School stu
dent organizations should meet
and consider interested stu
dents, recommending at least
two nominees to you for appoint
ment to the committee.
We share your concern tor the
future of legal education at
Stanford Law School. We hope
you agree that the Law School
can only benefit from mean
ingful student participation in
the selection of a new dean.
(Signed by 166 Law School stu
dents.)
