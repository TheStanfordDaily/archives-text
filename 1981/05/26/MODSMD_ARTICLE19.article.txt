# Junior defeats surprise finalist
## Mayotte beats Gurfein for NCAA title 
### Ivan Maisel 
That Tim Mayotte won the singles title ot the 97th
NCAA Tennis Championships Sunday in Athens, Ga.
comes as no surprise. Though he was seeded fourth,
many people at the Henry Feild Stadium on the Univer
sity of Georgia campus telt Stanford's No. 1 player •
should have been even higher.
Nor was the fact Mayotte reached the finals without
losing a set a shocker. He never faced any of the top
eight seeds in the 64-man field. His semifinal opponent,
Drew Gitlin of SMU, reached that plateau only when
top-seeded Chip Hooper of Arkansas defaulted their
quarterfinal match because of leg cramps. Hooper was
leading the match at the time.
That's why it comes as a partial surprise that May
otte found himself losing after the first set of the finals.
Though he rallied to become NCAA champion with a 6-7
(5-1), 6-3, 6-3 victory, the biggest surprise of the eight
day tournament was the man he beat to win the title, his
teammate, Jim Gurfein.
The sophomore began this season at No. 5 on the Stan
ford team's ladder, behind Mayotte, Scott Davis, Mike
Falberg and David Siegler. That's not NCAA-finalist
background, although its merits stand tall when you

consider he began his treshman year at No. 10.
Siegler dropped oft the team to turn pro, Falberg
stopped out winter quarter and Gurtein tought the re
mainder ot the team oft to settle in at No. 3 behind May
otte and Davis.
Though he finished the season with a dual match rec
ord of 18-3, and was seeded alphabetically in the Nos.
9-16 positions for the NCAA tourney, no one expected
Gurtein to even make it to the quarterfinals. Not only
did he accomplish that, beating eighth-seeded Robbie
Venter of UCLA 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 Friday, but he amazed ev
eryone with a 7-5, 6-7 (5- ), 6-2 ousting of No. 2 seed
Glenn Michibata of Pepperdine to move to the semi
finals.
"I said all week I've been hitting the ball well. It's
just a question of being as hungry as the other guys,"
Gurtein said after beating Venter, with whom he had
split matches during the season. "If you can't sustain it
tor eight or nine days, you'll never make it in th£ pros.
That's what's so amazing about (John) McEnroe. He
goes out week after week and wins."
Neither Gurtein nor Mayotte was exercised too
strenuously in the semifinals, both executing straight
set victories over seeds Nduka Odizor of Houston and

Gitlin, respectively. That set up the all-Stanford final,
the first in which teammates competed tor the national
title since 1974 (Stanford's John Whitlinger beat Chico
Hagey i.
Gurfein's trek to the finals had been based on both
ends of his service game. He pulled out of several
scrapes against Michibata and Odizor with a accurate,
powerful first serve, and his returns were equally good.
Against Mayotte, however, he had no aces and was suc
cessful on only 46 percent of his first serves. Mayotte
broke Gurfein three times in the final two sets to make
the difference.
The win capped off a most successful career for May
otte, who will turn pro next month in the Wimbledon
warm-up in Bristol, England. He finishes his athletic
career here a two-time All-America and a national
champion (Stanford's fifth in nine years and eighth ov
erall i.
In addition to Mayotte, Gurtein, Davis and Scott
Bondurant made All-America. The latter two made the
team by making the quarterfinal round of the doubles
competition, won by David Pate and Karl Richter of
TCU.
