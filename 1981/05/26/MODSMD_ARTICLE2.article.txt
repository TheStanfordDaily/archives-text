Believe it or not, the next frozen yogurt or polo shirt
purchased at the Stanford Shopping Center could help
to keep student costs down here, since the University
owns the center and receives a portion of each store's
profits.
As the only shopping mall ot its kind to be planned,
developed, owned and operated by a university, the
Stanford Shopping Center provided more than $5.4 mil
lion in rent and was one of the University's largest
sources ot income last year, according to Rosemary
McAndrews, manager ot campus properties.
After expenses, the net operating income of the cen
ter was approximately $3 million last year, about 2 per
cent of the University's operating budget for 1980-8 .
The shopping center, which currently leads all
nearby centers in total sales, was originally built in 955
in order to help "pay that part of the costs not paid by
students' tuition," McAndrews said. "The shopping
center is not operated as a money-making venture but
to help meet the University's obligations."
The income from the shopping center becomes a part
of the University's general tund and about 58 percent of
the income is a part of an investment pool.
McAndrews calls the shopping center an "inflation
hedge" since the University can adjust the rents, which
are based on square footage as well as sales. "It con
tinues to be productive because it is protected by infla
tion," she explained. The leases are all different and on
the average last for 0 years, though some may be as
short as three years.
The large department stores — Bullocks, Em
porium, Macy's, I. Magnin, Joseph Magnin and Saks
Fifth Avenue — are ground lease tenants which means
that they paid for their own facilities and only rent land
from Stanford. The smaller stores, which are housed in
the six multi-tenant buildings of the shopping center,
pay a higher rent per square foot because Stanford
owns the buildings as well as the land
The minimum rents vary from $5 to $40 per square
toot per month plus an overage rent, one added on when
a store makes more in sales than their breakeven point.
The University requires all stores to report their sales
"We make most of our money from the smaller
stores," McAndrews said. McAndrews also com
mented that the number of stores which failed to be suc
cessful were "remarkably small considering the size of
the center."

One reason that the failures may be low is that the
center checks out each new applicant thoroughly. ' We
have a pre-formalized plan which means that we know
what kind of store that we want," McAndrews said
The shopping center's tenants now cover 9 catego
ries including the five major department stores, two
junior department stores and 11 restaurants. About 40
percent of the center's sales are in apparrel.
The '24 stores of the shopping center have a gross
leasable area of ~'43, 00 square feet and the center
covers 71 acres ol the University. The shopping center
is a part of more than 000 acres designated as com
mercial land by the University. Other commercial
areas include Stanford Financial Square and "auto
row" along El Camino Real in Menlo Park.
In addition the University leases the 660 acres of the
industrial park. All leases in the industrial park are
pre-paid leases, meaning the University receives the
bulk ot the rental money when the companies first
move in.
The total acreage of is 8800 acres,
though approximately 700 acres have been condemned
for easements, etc. There are about 2500 acres for aca
demic use with an additional reserve of 4000 acres
SLAC includes about 500 more acres.
"I think that Stanford is unusual because land de
velopment is so large here and the potential is so much
greater to develop." McAndrews stated
The University is not the only one to make money
from the shopping center. The city of Palo Alto as well
as the Palo Alto Unified School District and Santa Clara
County all receive tax payments from the center. Last
year Area A of Palo Alto, which includes the shopping
center and the Stanford Professional Center, provided
Palo Alto with more than $2 million in tax revenues, ac
cording to Andrew Doty, director of community rela
tions. Of that. $144,969 was property tax. $1.339,3'8 was
retail sales tax and $888,827 was utility charges.
Doty said that Stanford lands in Palo Alto generated
more than $8 million for the city last year These I'6o
acres include the shopping center, the professional cen
ter, the industrial park and the Oak Creek Apartments.
"Stanford lands within the city ot Palo Alto are a to
tal of 7 percent of the city yet provided 36 percent of the
city's revenue," Doty said
Both Stanford and its tenants must pay taxes on all
lands not used for education and related purposes
