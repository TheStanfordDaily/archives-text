The Arizona State Sun Devils
tallied 133 points to score a
come-from-behind upset vic
tory in the Pacific-10 Cham
pionship Track meet at Stanford
Stadium Friday and Saturday.
Oregon finished second with 1.4,
UCLA was third with 108*. V4,
UC-Berkeley was fourth with 76,
and Stanford finished ninth and
last with 20 points.
Hammer thrower Dave
Thomson was the lone Cardinal
winner as he triumphed in his
specialty by more than 10 feet
with his throw of 209-feet-eight
inches.
The Oregon Ducks appeared
to be the favorites going into
Saturday's action since the co
favored UCLA Bruins had a
poor Friday showing. But de
spite racking up an amazing 74
points in the five distance
events, the Ducks lacked the ov
erall consistency necessary to
maintain their lead from Fri
day.
After scoring in only three of
eight events Friday, the blazing
Sun Devils put things together
Saturday, outscoring the Ducks
li3o-54 in second day action.
The unexpected victors did
most of their damage in the
sprints and horizontal jumps,
but the turning point came when
ASU's Dan Raby scored an up
set win over Oregon's Rudy
Chapa in the ' 500-meter race. It
was Arizona State's meet there
after, as the Sun Devils scored
in all but two of Saturday's 13
events.
Three individuals took home a
full one-third of the 21 gold med
als awarded in the meet. Dave
Porath of Cal was given Athlete
of the Meet honors for winning
both the shot put and the discus
throw by wide margins. His shot
put mark of 66-3 was a Cal
school record and good enough
to win by almost four feet.
The winning team's star per
former was sprinter-jumper
Lamonte King, who won the 200-

meters in a fast 20.36 seconds,
won the long jump, ran a quick
leg on the 400-meter relay
squad, and placed fifth in the
100-meters. All told, King nailed
down 24 points tor ASU.
Oregon's renowned distance
runner Alberto Salazar scored
an easy double victory in the
5000 and 1000-meter races.
Other top performances were
turned in by UCLA's Andre Phil
lips who won the 400-meter
hurdles in a meet record time of
49.81, and by Arizona's Harrison
Koroso whose 8:32.2 is the best
steeplechase clocking in the
country this year.
Although the Cardinals' point
total was predictably modest, a
few Stanford athletes came
through with strong per
formances. Hammer victor
Thomson came back to place
fifth in the discus. John Schaer
placed tourth in a blanket finish
of 1500-meter runners in which
the second through fifth fin
ishers were all clocked at 3:44.9.
