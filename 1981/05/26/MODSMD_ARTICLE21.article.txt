## NCAA golf tournament begins at Stanford 
### Sally Jenkins 
Stanford hosts the 84th NCAA golf
tournament tomorrow through Satur
day, for the first time since '966. Players
from 30 schools, including defending
team champion Oklahoma State Univer
sity and defending individual champion
Jay Don Blake of Utah State, will com
pete in the four-day tournament.
Play will begin at 7:30 a.m. each morn
ing on the first and tenth tees save for the
closing round, which will begin at 9 a.m.
Saturday.
Individual entrants from 27 other
schools will compete in medalist play on
the par 71, 6835-yard Stanford golf
course.

Besides Oklahoma State, favorites for
the team title include 1981 Pacific-10
Conference champion Arizona State,
Houston and Brigham Young. Other con
tenders for the team crown are USC,
Oral Roberts, Florida State and San Jose
State.
In addition to Blake, who won last
year's tournament at Ohio State, other
individual competitors expected to
challenge for the medal are 981 Pac-10
co-champion Dan Forsman ot Arizona
State, Ron Commans of USC, Bob Tway
of Oklahoma State, Joe Rassett ot Oral
Roberts and Joey Sindelar of Ohio State.
Tournament director and Stanford
head coach David Yates figures Arizona

State to give Oklahoma State a fight for
the team title, if only because the Sun
Devils are a Pac-10 team, and so have
played the Stanford couse before, and
well at that.
"ASU beat this field last fall at the
Stanford Intercollegiate," he said.
"They came back to win the Pac-10 meet
on the same course a few weeks ago. The
way they've been playing lately, espe
cially on this course, tells me the Sun
Devils have to figure among the favor
ites."
ASU is led by Pac-'O co-medalists
Tony Grimes and Dan Forsman, who
edged out Commans of USC and David
Games ot Stanford in the Pac-10 tour

nament.
Also in the running in the team com
petition is Brigham Young, the runner
up last year, and currently ranked first in
the country by Golf World magazine.
Oral Roberts, a definite force to be
reckoned with, is led by a senior named
Joe Rasset who has a habit leaving
course records in tatters behind him.
The Stanford Cardinals will field one
ot the youngest teams in the tournament,
with three freshmen in the lineup.
Games will most probably be the individ
ual leader tor the Cards. He shot opening
rounds of 68-68 in the conference tour
nament, to lead the field by six strokes.
