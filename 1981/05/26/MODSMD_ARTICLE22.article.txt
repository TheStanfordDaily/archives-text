# Baseball strike talks continue

New York (AP) — With a Friday strike dead
line staring them in the tace, negotiators tor ma
jor league baseball club owners and players will
return to the bargaining table today.
Kenneth E. Moftett, the federal mediator in
volved in the negotiations, said after Saturday's
session: "It doesn't look good.
"I don't feel as good this year as last," said
Moftett, referring to a last-minute agreement last
May that avoided a player walkout.
The sole issue is compensation for the signing of
ranking free agents. The owners have im
plemented a plan that would require more mean
ingful compensation — a major league roster
player rather than picks in the amateur draft —
when a team loses a ranking free agent to another
team through the re-entry draft. The players are
concerned that owners, required to part with
players, would be less apt to sign free agents and
their mobility as free agents would be restricted.
They are set to strike following the completion of
games next Thursday night.
The executive board of the Players Association,
which is headed by Marvin Miller, is scheduled to
meet here Thursday.

"1 wasn't impressed by the owners' side,'"
Cleveland pitcher Bert Blyleven said after Satur
day's meeting. "We have something we won and
they wftnt to take it away. They want us to make a
proposal. Why should we?"
Instead, the players are hoping for a favorable
decision from the National Labor Relations Board
after charging the owners with unfair labor prac
tices. William Lubbers, the NLRB general coun
sel/is expected to disclose his decision on the
charges on today.
Lubbers could dismiss the charges or issue a
complaint. If he does the latter, the NLRB also
could seek an injunction in federal court to post
pone the strike deadline.
Last year, the negotiations involved many sub
jects, all ot which were settled with the exception
of the free agent clause. It was put off for further
study, and then the owners, exercising a right pro
vided in last year's contract agreement, unilat
erally implemented their plan. The agreement
which prevented a strike last May also gave the
players the right to strike over the compensation
issue providing they do so prior to June 1.
