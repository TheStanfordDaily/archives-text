# Unser stripped of Indy victory
## 
### 
Indianapolis (AP) — Mario Andretti got
another taste of victory at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway after an 1-year drought —
but it was a bittersweet one.
Andretti would rather h*ve won his sec
ond Indianapolis 500 on the track, but had to
be satisfied with getting it by committee as
the race stewards stripped Bobby Unser of
the victory yesterday.
Unser crossed the finish line nearly 300
yards ahead of Andretti. But the veteran
driver from Albuquerque, N.M., saw his
third Indy 500 triumph slip away when the
stewards penalized him one full lap for pass
ing more than half a dozen cars and improv
ing his position after pitting under a yellow
caution flag on the 149 th lap.
That decision gave the 41-year-old An
dretti his first Indy victory since 969.
It also prompted car-owner Roger Penske
to file a pair of official protests — one claim
ing his Unser, his driver, did nothing wrong
and the other accusing Andretti of the very
thing Unser was supposed to have done.

The race stewards met with the parties
involved and heard testimony trom wit
nesses, including other drivers, during the
late morning and afternoon. Tlfe hearing
continued into the late afternoon.
The change of winner was not known until
the official order of finish was«posted at the
U.S. Auto Club's speedway office at 8 a.m.
yesterday, about 17 hours after Andretti and
his Wildcat crossed the finish line 5.3 sec
onds behind Unser's Penske PC-9B
The stewards made their decision to pe
nalize Unser after reviewing videotapes of
the incident, checking scoring reports and
hearing reports from race course ob
servers.
Unser, 47, would have been the oldest
man ever to win at Indianapolis. Instead, he
became the first driver in the 65 years in
which the Indy classic has been run to have
victory taken away for breaking a rule.
Striding purposefully toward his garage
during a break in the hearing, a somber Un
ser said. "I feel very empty. They say I did
something wrong, and I say I didn't. If I did

anything wrong, then so did a lot ot other
people."
Andretti said he saw Unser commit the
infraction and immediately told his crew
over the two-way radio to report it to race
officials. But, when nothing was done before
the race ended, Andretti, teammate Gordon
Johncock and A.J. Foyt petitioned Chief
Steward Tom Bintord to make a ruling.
Binford said, "We discussed the blend
in' rule at some length at our meetihg with
the drivers last Thursday. When you leave
the pits, there is an orange cone there that is
the approximate position where you join the
field — blend in with the other cars. This is
not an optional penalty. It's mandatory. In
my opinion, there is not a shred of doubt it
was passing under the yellow, not blending
in."
There was a total of 1 caution flags in the
race, resulting in an average winning speed
by Andretti of 39.029 mph, the slowest since
960. Unser s speed was announced after the
race at 139.084 mph.
