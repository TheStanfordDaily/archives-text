## Jo Anne: woman, not symbol 
### Stephen Nash 
One August night in 1974, Jo Anne Little
murdered her jailer with an ice-pick and ran
away. A week later, she turned herself in, said
that it was self-defense, that the guard had tried to
rape her, and was charged with first-degree
murder. She was acquitted, but not before she had
been made into the symbolic victim of many dec
ades of oppression of black women. It's not clear
that even Little herself knows anymore what real
ly happened that night, since her supporters and
her lawyers demanded that she transform herself
into the symbol that they had created.
In its West Coast premiere at the Julian
Theatre in San Francisco, Ed Bullins's play Jo
Anne satirizes all those myth-makers who
couldn't bring themselves to look at the woman
who was actually on trial. The feminists, the
southern blacks and the attorneys who used Lit
tle's trial to further all their own causes, are the
villains; Little is just a prop tor their fantasies.
The setting for the play is a stylized courtroom
where All Goode the jailer is both judge and defen
dant. On the multi-level stage, the many versions
of the murder scene are acted out interspersed
with appearances by the various groupies who at
tached themselves to the trial.
Bullins has used Brechtian techniques to re
mind the audience how irrelevant Truth became
for the people involved. Except tor Adilah
Azikiwe as Little, all of the actors play multiple
roles. Also, there are many reminders that the
scenes acted out are pieces ot theatre, and not rec

reations of real events.
Central to the play is Azikiwe's performance as
Jo Anne. It's hard-edged and aggressive, coun
terbalancing the myth ot the helpless victim that
all the other characters have created. Also in
teresting is Ed Corbett as the jailer trying to Re
deem whatever he can of his reputation. In thfc
rest of the cast, there are remarkable per
formances by Bobby Joe Woodward (as the
preacher), Rebecca Stockley (as an activist) and
Eleanore Tapscott (particularly as Lawyer
Scott).
One special pleasure of seeing this play at the
Julian is the performance by jazz musician Ray
Collins. Both with his languorous improvisations
on soprano sax beforehand, and with his under
stated comments on sax and clarinets during the
play, he is very helpful in establishing mood.
■Jo Anne was directed by John Doyle (founder of
the Grassroots Experience Theatre Co.f, who
keeps the momentum going throughout the many
changes of scene. The very versatile set is by Alan
Curreri, and the lighting by Susan Paigen.
Jo Anne Little's trial may have been a rallying
point tor many black and teminist political
groups, but Bullins's play bypasses all the politics
connected with the event. His play is about the
woman who was on trial, not the symbol everyone
wanted her to be.
