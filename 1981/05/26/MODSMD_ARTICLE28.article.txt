# 'The Fox': maybe not Fantastic, but he's nobody's has- been
## 
### David Schmelzer 
Captain Fantastic is dead. No
more glasses with windshield
wipers and neon lights; no more
wild hats. Oh he still pops up
now and again — he came out
dressed in a Bob Mackie
created duck suit at a free con
cert in Central Park last year —
but tor the most part the Fox has
taken over for him.
He burst on to the music
scene at the start ot the '70s as a
brilliantly talented young per
former who created an image as
the wild and indulgent rock star.
He didn't do a concert without a
lavish wardrobe, a seven-tiered
stage, frenetic lighting and
room for 75,000 people. But tor
all his talent, he had no place to
go in his career ; he was heading
for the proverbial fall. His mu
sic began a slow decline — the
"Goodbye Yellow-Brick
Road'' 's became the "Island
Girl" sand —and in 1977, the crash
came. An onslaught of different
factors eroded his mental condi
tion: his recently professed
bisexuality, his receding hair
line. the pressures of the road,
harsh criticism of his last
album. Blue Moves. At that
time, Elton John announced he
was giving up touring forever
and would, for an indefinite pe
riod, stop recording.
When he made a record after
a two-year break, he was still
floundering. He told reporters
that when he did .4 Single Man,
he simply "forgot to call"
Bernie Taupin, the man who had
written the lyrics tor almost ev
ery song he'd ever composed.
On Victim of Love, John, one of
the music industry's finest com
posers, let others convince him
not to write a single number for
the album.
He pulled himself together
for last year's 21 at 33, which
was better than anything he'd
made in years. It's the work of a
mature craftsman who no long
er lets others tell him what to
do. Much of his past year has
been devoted to resolving a le
gal dispute with MCA records,
who disagree with him about
what type of album he had to
make to fulfill a contract. He
didn't bend, and he released The
Fox on a different label. On the
album's inside sleeve he writes,
"Special thanks to . . . Geffen
Records for their inspiration (at
last) . . . and to my brain for
coping with it all."
His brain here has never been
more diverse or more cutting.
While he has other people write
his lyrics, there is often little
doubt about who suggested
them. Where he consciously

created his Captain Fantastic
image years ago, he's now made
himself a new one: the wily,
wirey, crafty, unpredictable
Fox. He still has a mystique, but
it's a more mature facade, and
one he enters into firmly,
saying, "I am the tox/Like it or
not."

The "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" 's
became the "Island Girl" 'sand in 1977,
the crash came.

In the finest song on an album
ot fine songs, he talks, through
Taupin, apparently about the
MCA fight. "Heels ot the Wind"
is a neat little rocker that
doesn't seem to suggest any
heavy meaning. The lyrics,
though, delve into a disappoint
ing split that leaves the singer
more disturbed than angry. It's
"just like a broken marriage,
when two people just don't
care," and its effect is that
"rains wash out the fires
within."
Those fires, and his anger,

are more than present in the
Gary Osborne-penned lyric of
"Heart in the Right Place."
John leaves little doubt about
who thought of this number, or
what it is trying to say; trom the
first line he's taking his shot at
the critics. His view of what
they do: "I'll ask you some

questions/ I'll tell you some
lies/ You'll open you're heart
like a friend/ I'll make up some
answers you won't recognize/
The you I create with my pen.''
But the move that best il
lustrates his current confidence
is his decision to write two clas
sical pieces and to include them
on The Fox. He's getting older
and he's in a position where he
can afford to branch out and not
allow himself to get locked into
a pattern of producing albums
composed ot 10 pop tunes. This
is how he'll grow and how he'll

stay on top as an artist. Having
very little knowledge of classi
cal music, I cannot presume to
judge these, but I know that I
like them enough not to move
the needle to the next songs
when they come up.
Technically, The Fox is su
perb. as are all Elton John
albums. He still plays the piano
better than all but a tew, and he
shows it off well on several
songs. James Newton Howard
does some wonderful work with
synthesizers here; on "Nobody
Wins" it's the only instrument
used. Howard also arranged and
conducted the London Sym
phony Orchestra for the classi
cal pieces.
And John's vocals are still
top-quality. He's a controlled
singer, who can give his all emo
tionally on "Nobody Wins," and
still understate a lighter
number like "Just Like
Belgium."
Elton John is nobody's has
been. His music on The Fox is as
well-crafted as anything he's
ever done, and is more varied
and incisive than the bulk of his
past work. Captain Fantastic
was great, but the Fox is no step
down.

ot fine songs, he talks, through
Taupin, apparently about the
MCA fight. "Heels ot the Wind"
is a neat little rocker that
doesn't seem to suggest any
heavy meaning. The lyrics,
though, delve into a disappoint
ing split that leaves the singer
more disturbed than angry. It's
"just like a broken marriage,
when two people just don't
care," and its effect is that
"rains wash out the fires
within."
Those fires, and his anger,

are more than present in the
Gary Osborne-penned lyric of
"Heart in the Right Place."
John leaves little doubt about
who thought of this number, or
what it is trying to say; trom the
first line he's taking his shot at
the critics. His view of what
they do: "I'll ask you some

questions/ I'll tell you some
lies/ You'll open you're heart
like a friend/ I'll make up some
answers you won't recognize/
The you I create with my pen.''
But the move that best il
lustrates his current confidence
is his decision to write two clas
sical pieces and to include them
on The Fox. He's getting older
and he's in a position where he
can afford to branch out and not
allow himself to get locked into
a pattern of producing albums
composed ot 10 pop tunes. This
is how he'll grow and how he'll

stay on top as an artist. Having
very little knowledge of classi
cal music, I cannot presume to
judge these, but I know that I
like them enough not to move
the needle to the next songs
when they come up.
Technically, The Fox is su
perb. as are all Elton John
albums. He still plays the piano
better than all but a tew, and he
shows it off well on several
songs. James Newton Howard
does some wonderful work with
synthesizers here; on "Nobody
Wins" it's the only instrument
used. Howard also arranged and
conducted the London Sym
phony Orchestra for the classi
cal pieces.
And John's vocals are still
top-quality. He's a controlled
singer, who can give his all emo
tionally on "Nobody Wins," and
still understate a lighter
number like "Just Like
Belgium."
Elton John is nobody's has
been. His music on The Fox is as
well-crafted as anything he's
ever done, and is more varied
and incisive than the bulk of his
past work. Captain Fantastic
was great, but the Fox is no step
down.

Captain Fantastic is dead. No
more glasses with windshield
wipers and neon lights; no more
wild hats. Oh he still pops up
now and again — he came out
dressed in a Bob Mackie
created duck suit at a free con
cert in Central Park last year —
but tor the most part the Fox has
taken over for him.
He burst on to the music
scene at the start ot the '70s as a
brilliantly talented young per
former who created an image as
the wild and indulgent rock star.
He didn't do a concert without a
lavish wardrobe, a seven-tiered
stage, frenetic lighting and
room for 75,000 people. But tor
all his talent, he had no place to
go in his career ; he was heading
for the proverbial fall. His mu
sic began a slow decline — the
"Goodbye Yellow-Brick
Road'' 's became the "Island
Girl" sand —and in 1977, the crash
came. An onslaught of different
factors eroded his mental condi
tion: his recently professed
bisexuality, his receding hair
line. the pressures of the road,
harsh criticism of his last
album. Blue Moves. At that
time, Elton John announced he
was giving up touring forever
and would, for an indefinite pe
riod, stop recording.
When he made a record after
a two-year break, he was still
floundering. He told reporters
that when he did .4 Single Man,
he simply "forgot to call"
Bernie Taupin, the man who had
written the lyrics tor almost ev
ery song he'd ever composed.
On Victim of Love, John, one of
the music industry's finest com
posers, let others convince him
not to write a single number for
the album.
He pulled himself together
for last year's 21 at 33, which
was better than anything he'd
made in years. It's the work of a
mature craftsman who no long
er lets others tell him what to
do. Much of his past year has
been devoted to resolving a le
gal dispute with MCA records,
who disagree with him about
what type of album he had to
make to fulfill a contract. He
didn't bend, and he released The
Fox on a different label. On the
album's inside sleeve he writes,
"Special thanks to . . . Geffen
Records for their inspiration (at
last) . . . and to my brain for
coping with it all."
His brain here has never been
more diverse or more cutting.
While he has other people write
his lyrics, there is often little
doubt about who suggested
them. Where he consciously

created his Captain Fantastic
image years ago, he's now made
himself a new one: the wily,
wirey, crafty, unpredictable
Fox. He still has a mystique, but
it's a more mature facade, and
one he enters into firmly,
saying, "I am the tox/Like it or
not."
