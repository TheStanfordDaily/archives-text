# Students may lose loan funds BEOG and GSL cuts planned
## 
### Chris Butchko 
Stanford students may be drastical
ly affected by predicted reductions in
Basic Educational Opportunity
Grants (BEOG) and in the California
Guaranteed Student Loan Program
(GSL), a program which may suffer
available fund cuts as high as 45 per
cent.
In addition to the heavy cuts the
loans face as a "social program'' in
the national budget, costs to students
will change and eligibility require
ments may be altered.
Almost half of Stanford's students
obtain assistance through loans, re
ceiving more than $14 million under
the two programs facing cuts. Presi
dent Donald Kennedy estimated that
approximated 30 percent of the stu
dents currently on a loan program
may be cut out entirely. He indicated,
however, that a majority ot those stu
dents are getting "loans of conve
nience," because there is no income
ceiling for the GSL.
Director of Government Relations
Larry Horton, said the entire student
loan program itself is in "very serious
trouble" due to the unstable condition
of the federal budget in Congress. The
status of programs is "literally chang
ing every day,"and a great deal of
confusion surrounds the program
cuts. Although the changes are still
being studied by Congress, Horton de
scribed the student aid situation as
being "increasingly bad."
> The budget cuts proposed in Con
gress will have a profound affect on
Stanford's students if they are carried
out without any major changes. At
present, the largest cuts would be in
the BEOG's, from which 100 students
receive a total of $1.1 million. After
the latest Senate session, it was esti
mated that Stanford would lose ap
proximately $480,000, more than three
times the amount predicted in March,
and almost one-half the current funds.
The vast majority of loans available
are from the GSL, the major source of
finance for middle income families
As a "luxury" item, the program will
be altered the most by President
Ronald Reagan's cuts. In fact, the
final verdict is likely to be more dis
mal tor the college student as "overly
optimistic assumptions concerning in
flation" in Reagan's proposals could

force greater measures, according to
Horton.
It is also likely that uncertainty and
instability surrounding the GSL could
make the program "unattractive" to
lenders, thus reducing the availability
of the loans.
Horton added that the University
and its students may face "rolling un
certainty" tor a long time to come, be
cause of the unsettled situation of fun
ding processes.
In the midst of the turmoil surroun
ding student aid. the California Guar
anteed Student Loan program is now
accepting applications from Califor
nia students tor the 981-82 school
year. Arthur Marmaduke, director of
the California Student Aid Com
mission, expects that changes in the
program may go into effect by Octo
ber 1, which would thus influence this
year's applicants.
Kight now both Citibank of New
York and Chase Manhattan are accep

ting loan applications for the upcom
ing year, with the Bank of America
due to begin accepting applications in
June. United California, Union and
Crocker banks set July as the date
they begin accepting applications,
while Security Pacific and Wells
Fargo have not yet set a date.
Students who borrowed funds under
the California GSL should return to
the same lender, and students covered
by the Federal Insured Student Loan
Program must continue to borrow un
der that program. Students who pre
viously borrowed under a plan are as
sured the same interest rate they as
sumed last year, while new borrowers
this year start with 9 percent interest.
Any students wishing to find out
about other California lenders should
contact the Financial Aid Office. The
California student aid commission is
preparing a comprehensive study of
lender policies for California stu
dents, which will be on file at the Fi
nancial Aid Office in Old Union.
