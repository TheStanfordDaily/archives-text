# Misogyny, superficiality mar Peter Shaffer's 'Equus'
## 
### Mike Hale 
' According to the program
notes for The Company's pro
duction of Equus, playwright
Peter Shaffer wished to make
"comprehensible" a "dreadful
event" of which he was told. As
you may or may not know, the
dreadful event involves doing
terrible things to horses. Shaf
fer's explanation of the event
turned out to be a thoroughly un
interesting play, a superficial,
misogynistic mess. It is a play
for people who don't really en
joy plays and must justify their
presence in a theater on higher
grounds than pleasure.
This isn't to say that a produc
tion of Equus has no pleasure to

give. There is the opportunity
for bravura acting present in the
central role, that of psychiatrist
Martin Dysart A good actor in
this role can, to a certain extent,
redeem the play; Paul Ed
wards, who plays Dysart in this
production, is a good actor, and
the evening is tolerable if you
manage to spend the 2 x 'z hours
watching him rather than the
play.
"Actor" may not be the right
word to use, because playing
Dysart does not require acting
in the usual sense. All of the
character's seeming profun
dities are, when you look at
them, just talk, and talking is
what Edwards does well. It is

very impressive, at the college
level, to see an actor speak this
comfortably, handle a British
accent this capably, and be ever
correct in his readings. (The lat
ter is made easier by the super
ficiality of Shaffer's script.)
While there isn't any real emo
tion in the role for Edwards to
communicate — his worst mo
ments are those; at which he
must rant about passion, Shaf
fer's jiominal theme — and
there is a certain mechani
calness in the way he dominates
the play, his technique can be
enjoyed in its own right.
There is not too much else to
be enjoyed in The Company's
production. The tubular-metal

and-black-rubber horses' heads
(which, I am told, were bor
rowed from ACT I are wonder
ful ; they give the horses person
ality, which most of the humans
in the production lacked Watch
ing this play, I found myself
wondering, once again, why are
there so few women at Stanford
who can act? The four women
who appear in Equus all seem to
have wandered in from dorm
plays; the quality of their per
formances ranges from medi
ocre to wretched. Steven Fuller,
who plays Alan Strang, Dysart's
patient, tries to get by on bug
eyes and screaming and jerky
movements; he is only intermit
tently believable. Gregory

Jackson, as Alan's father, is
competent, but if you have seen
him create exactly the same
character in other plays his per
formance becomes uninterest
ing.
The play is staged in the
round, and the actors sit in the
first row of seats "behind" the
stage, from where they make
their entrances and exits. This
works very well, except when
the "horses" (actors in
leotards, wearing the ACT
heads and large metal
"hooves") must come clomping
on stage. They are quite striking
once there, but it takes them so
long to get there, and they make
so much noise doing it, that the
effect is ruined.
Peter Maradudin, who de
signed the set, was also respon
sible for the lighting, which was
at times very effective. Steven
Young's rather workmanlike
direction set the tone for the
production, which was one of
flavorless competence,
leavened by bad acting, and re
lieved only by Paul Edwards's
performance.
