# No apologies on 'Hard Promises'
## 
### David Schmelzer 
You say ya like rock n' roll,
but it's beginning to get boring?
You say new wave's just a little
bit too far in left field for your
tastes? If so, you're probably
saying you like Tom Petty.
Let's face it, nobody who
sings like he just had a
tracheotomy and who looks like
his face got hit by his amp can be
considered a classic pop-rock
singer. On the other hand, any
new-waver who had Stevie
Nicks sing harmony vocals on
his album would soon find his
fans spastically jumping up and
down to a different artist.
Tom Petty belongs to a third
type, that of the progressive
rocker. His music is lean and
sparse; you won't hear any horn
section or overdubs on his
albums. He doesn't write
soothing, commonplace songs,
and the way he croaks out vocals
won't disappoint people who are
sick of silky (some say sappy)
crooners like Barry Manilow.
But he also still wears his hair
long, dresses casually, plays
some straight-ahead rock, and
writes a few ordinary love songs
— a mix that's shown off pretty
well on his just-released album
Hard Promises.
The ordinary parts of it are
sections of his lyric ("Baby no
one could'a ever told me 'bout
this/ I said yeah yeah"). The
melody isn't bad, though, and
it's the catchiest song on the
album. It's also not as irritating
as his other hits (one more
chorus of "Ya doane haa ta lii
lak a refugee" and my stereo

would have been sent soaring towards making up for what
out of a window), so people who ever weaknesses the rest of the
merely tolerated those will album has. "Letting You Go"

doesn't write soothing, commonplace
songs, and the way he croaks out vocals
won"t disappoint people who are sick of silky
crooners. . .'

probably like this.
The album's new wave song is
"Nightwatchman," and it does
get irritating. Petty's lisping
delivery gets so pronounced at
points in the number that it be
gins to sound like a Bob Dylan
parody. But the song is an in
teresting one, and his vocal
style accentuates its quirkiness.
"The Criminal Kind" is a simi
larly dark song about the types a
nightwatchman has to defend
himselt against.
The straight-ahead rocker is
"Kings Road," and here Petty
shows that he can straight
ahead rock pretty well. Look for
this to be the opening song on his
concert tour for the album.
The Stevie Nicks duet is "In
sider" and, even with her help,
it's not one ot the high points of
the album. Although another
lyrically fine number, it drags,
and her vocals are wasted on a
song that wouldn't have sounded
much different as a solo.
The pop-rockers are "Letting
You Go" and "A Thing About
You," and they go a long way

rolls along about the problems
of losing a love and "A Thing
About You" rocks nittily (if
similarly to Springsteen's
"Crush On You") about the feel

ings the singer has for the type
of girl that left him in the pre
vious song.
Petty gave some thought to
calling this album $8.98 as a
protest against his record com
pany selling it tor an inordinate
ly high price. His choice of Hard
Promises instead is tamer, but
likely relates to the problem of
following up his successful last
album Damn the Torpedoes,
which brought him his success.
It's tough to top an album that
millions love. Petty doesn't
have to apologize, though; Hard
Promises comes through. It
won't send any tans scurrying
back to Manilow.
