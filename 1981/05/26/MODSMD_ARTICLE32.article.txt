# Senior to give vocal recital
## 
### Val Vaden 
Last month Gwen Eagleton, a blonde
soprano with hair dyed auburn to look a little
less Californian and a little more Puerto Ri
can, sang the demanding role of Maria in
Ram's Head's production of West Side Story.
Now, four weeks later, witHÂ»-hair back to
blonde, Eagleton will be on her own as she
presents her Senior Voice Recital this Wednes
day night at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
"In a show like West Side Story you're part
of a big group working together toward the
same goal: a really great production,"
Eagleton said. "In contrast, preparing a reci
tal is much more intimate. It's a three-person
effort, working with my pianist (Ellen
Brodsky) and my voice teacher (Marie
Gibson).
There are other differences between a musi
cal and a recital besides rehearsal conditions.
As Eagleton explains, "A Senior Recital is a
survey of music from the 17th century to the
20th. Its purpose is to show technical skill
through long phrases, runs and trills, and to
show how you work with different languages.
It's like a Senior Honors Thesis for Voice Ma
jors, what you have spent years working up
to."
The experience of singing songs in different
languages is one she highlights. "Doing work
in different languages teaches you about the
languages. I've spent hours studying trans
lations because it's very important to know

what you're singing. Otherwise you would just
be singing instead ot relating what the com
poser and the poet had in mind.''
What is more, the recital should be an artis
tic experience tor the audience as well. "Feel
ing the different moods, reading the trans
lations of the texts, and hearing the music
should leave the audience feeling something,"'
she said.
Further, in a musical, a performer's goal is
to create one character with a range of moods
"But in an art song recital, each song has its
own mood to convey from its unique point of
view."
But in spite ot the differences between the
two types of performances, they are still both
performances, and the key to success is prac
tice. And more practice.
Still, no matter how well-prepared,
Eagleton still acknowledges that rush ot
adrenalin and the nervousness that goes along
with performing. "But it I concentrate and use
what I've learned, the nerves shouldn't get in
the way.
If she does get a little nervous, it would be
understandable. She has high aspirations for
Wednesday night. "There are stereotypes
about classical singing, like you can't under
stand what is being sung even if it's in English
and that the singer is just showing oft. But the
whole point is communication.
"I want to share what I've learned, and
hopefully people will feel something."
