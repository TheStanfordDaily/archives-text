Atlanta death toll reaches 30
Atlanta — The city's list of murdered and missing young
blacks grew to 30 yesterday, as police added the cases of a
man who disappeared a week ago and another whose body
was found in the Chattahoochee River. An autopsy showed
the latest victim was asphyxiated, like '6 before him.
The nude body of the man, whose identity was not re
leased, was found Sunday in the river northwest of Atlan
ta.
Police said yesterday his case and that of 22-year-old
Ronald Crawford, a mentally retarded man who ha§ been
missing since May 18, would be added to the list of eases
being investigated by a special police task force, bringing
the total to 28 unsolved deaths andHwo disappearances.
Fulton County Medical Examiner Robert Stivers said
the identity of the latest victim was not released because
police were still trying to notify his family. But he said it
definitely was not Crawford, as had been suspected when
the body was found Sunday.
There was "no patterned injury on the neck," as had
been the case in several of the earlier cases. Stivers said,
and he added that he was unsure what type of asphyxial
death it was. At least seven of the earlier deaths were
ruled strangulations.
The addition of the man, in his late 20s, to the task force
list confronted investigators with their oldest victim to
date. Michael Mcintosh, 23, had been listed as the oldest of
the young black victims.
The latest body was found by two boys who were fishing
in the river at a spot less than a mile north of where the
corpse of Jimmy Ray Payne, 21, was found April 27. The
bodies of five other victims on the task force list were also
found in the Chattahoochee.
South African celebration protested
Johannesburg, South Africa — Rail lines were sabo
taged, police were attacked, and power lines were cut in
tive areas of South Africa yesterday, and the underground
black-activist African National Congress claimed respon

sibility for the episodes.
The group's president. Oliver Tambo, in Paris tor an in
ternational meeting to discuss sanctions against South
Africa because of its racist policies, said his partisans
blew up a section of track on the railroad that carries
thousands of black workers between the ghetto city of
Soweto and the white factories, offices, and homes of
Johannesburg
In other violent incidents linked to a boycott of the white
celebration of South Africa's 20th anniversary as a re
public, a police station was attacked, a police patrol was
fired on, a rail line leading out of the port of Durban was
blasted, and power lines were cut in the conservative
white province of Orange Free State.
The rail line sabotage appeared to have been carefully
timed not to derail trains or injure black riders. The gov
ernment said the damaged sections of track were quickly
repaired and normal service resumed.
In three tribal regions — Transkei. Lebowa. and the
Zulu homeland — campaigns have urged black workers to
stay away from their jobs the rest of this week to protest
Republic Day observations.
Indian students in Durban decried the observance as "a
celebration of 20 years of repression and terrorism."
In Johannesburg, white students have condemned the
series of festivals but deny that they support the African
National Congress' call tor strikes to disrupt the celebra
tions.
Sammy Adelman, student council president at Johan
nesburg's University ot Witwatersrand, criticized the
spending ot more than $2 million on Republic Day events
"when we have 2.2 million unemployed and three out of
five children dying in the homelands" tor lack of food, a
statistic challenged by authorities.
Expressions ot opposition caused Prime Minister Pieter
Botha to declare that negativism displayed by boycotters
is "un-South African."
Trailside victim linked to suspect
Santa Cruz — Authorities using dental charts identified

the remains yesterday of Heather Scaggs, missing co
worker of David Carpenter, who is charged in one of eight
trailside slayings in Northern California.
Detectives from San Jose used Scaggs' dental X-rays to
help identify the decomposed body found Sunday in Big
Basin State Park. Scaggs had been missing since May 2.
The body was discovered by two unidentified hikers.
She was reported missing the same day she had planned
to meet Carpenter, 51, who worked with Scaggs at the Cali
fornia Trade School in Hayward.
On March 29, Ellen Hansen, a 20-year-old college stu
dent, was shot to death and her boyfriend seriously
wounded in a trailside attack in Henry Cowell State Park,
also in Santa Cruz County.
Carpenter, an ex-convict with a history of violence, was
arrested May 15 in San Francisco and later charged with
murder in the slaying of Hansen and the wounding ot Steve
Haertle, 20. He hasn't been charged in any other cases.
The eight trailside killings — seven in Marin County
north of San Francisco and Hansen's in Santa Cruz County
to the south — began in August 1979 and terrorized resi
dents who used the myriad of hiking trails which blanket
the Northern California coast and nearby mountains.
Court affidavits filed in connection with warrants issued
tor the search of Carpenter's house and car revealed that
Scaggs had told her boyfriend she was going to meet
Carpenter on May 2 to look at a car for sale in Santa Cruz.
Carpenter is being held without bail pending his arraign
ment next month.
Early retirement benefits may stay
Washington — The Reagan administration, in an at
tempt to make its Social Security plan "a lot more attrac
tive," is willing to discuss phasing in reduced benefits tor
early retirees and other compromises during a meeting
this week with House Democratic leaders.
"Maybe we can phase it in,. . . we're not against that,"
Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Schweiker
said yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Some of
these changes may have to be phased in."

He gave no indication of what type of delay the adminis
tration might agree to on the early-retirement question.
A key, controversial item in the president's plan would
revise a system under which persons are able to retire at
age 62 — as 70 percent of workers now do — and collect 80
percent of the benefits they would normally receive at age
65.
Earlier, the Republican-controlled Senate adopted a
resolution 96-0 saying that "Congress shall not pre
cipitously and unfairly penalize early retirees."
Today's weather
Chance of morning showers. Partly cloudy during the
afternoon and tonight. Fair and a little warmer tomorrow.
Lows in the 50s. Highs in the 70s today and the mid 70s to
mid 80s tomorrow.

Atlanta death toll reaches 30
Atlanta — The city's list of murdered and missing young
blacks grew to 30 yesterday, as police added the cases of a
man who disappeared a week ago and another whose body
was found in the Chattahoochee River. An autopsy showed
the latest victim was asphyxiated, like '6 before him.
The nude body of the man, whose identity was not re
leased, was found Sunday in the river northwest of Atlan
ta.
Police said yesterday his case and that of 22-year-old
Ronald Crawford, a mentally retarded man who ha§ been
missing since May 18, would be added to the list of eases
being investigated by a special police task force, bringing
the total to 28 unsolved deaths andHwo disappearances.
Fulton County Medical Examiner Robert Stivers said
the identity of the latest victim was not released because
police were still trying to notify his family. But he said it
definitely was not Crawford, as had been suspected when
the body was found Sunday.
There was "no patterned injury on the neck," as had
been the case in several of the earlier cases. Stivers said,
and he added that he was unsure what type of asphyxial
death it was. At least seven of the earlier deaths were
ruled strangulations.
The addition of the man, in his late 20s, to the task force
list confronted investigators with their oldest victim to
date. Michael Mcintosh, 23, had been listed as the oldest of
the young black victims.
The latest body was found by two boys who were fishing
in the river at a spot less than a mile north of where the
corpse of Jimmy Ray Payne, 21, was found April 27. The
bodies of five other victims on the task force list were also
found in the Chattahoochee.
South African celebration protested
Johannesburg, South Africa — Rail lines were sabo
taged, police were attacked, and power lines were cut in
tive areas of South Africa yesterday, and the underground
black-activist African National Congress claimed respon

sibility for the episodes.
The group's president. Oliver Tambo, in Paris tor an in
ternational meeting to discuss sanctions against South
Africa because of its racist policies, said his partisans
blew up a section of track on the railroad that carries
thousands of black workers between the ghetto city of
Soweto and the white factories, offices, and homes of
Johannesburg
In other violent incidents linked to a boycott of the white
celebration of South Africa's 20th anniversary as a re
public, a police station was attacked, a police patrol was
fired on, a rail line leading out of the port of Durban was
blasted, and power lines were cut in the conservative
white province of Orange Free State.
The rail line sabotage appeared to have been carefully
timed not to derail trains or injure black riders. The gov
ernment said the damaged sections of track were quickly
repaired and normal service resumed.
In three tribal regions — Transkei. Lebowa. and the
Zulu homeland — campaigns have urged black workers to
stay away from their jobs the rest of this week to protest
Republic Day observations.
Indian students in Durban decried the observance as "a
celebration of 20 years of repression and terrorism."
In Johannesburg, white students have condemned the
series of festivals but deny that they support the African
National Congress' call tor strikes to disrupt the celebra
tions.
Sammy Adelman, student council president at Johan
nesburg's University ot Witwatersrand, criticized the
spending ot more than $2 million on Republic Day events
"when we have 2.2 million unemployed and three out of
five children dying in the homelands" tor lack of food, a
statistic challenged by authorities.
Expressions ot opposition caused Prime Minister Pieter
Botha to declare that negativism displayed by boycotters
is "un-South African."
Trailside victim linked to suspect
Santa Cruz — Authorities using dental charts identified

the remains yesterday of Heather Scaggs, missing co
worker of David Carpenter, who is charged in one of eight
trailside slayings in Northern California.
Detectives from San Jose used Scaggs' dental X-rays to
help identify the decomposed body found Sunday in Big
Basin State Park. Scaggs had been missing since May 2.
The body was discovered by two unidentified hikers.
She was reported missing the same day she had planned
to meet Carpenter, 51, who worked with Scaggs at the Cali
fornia Trade School in Hayward.
On March 29, Ellen Hansen, a 20-year-old college stu
dent, was shot to death and her boyfriend seriously
wounded in a trailside attack in Henry Cowell State Park,
also in Santa Cruz County.
Carpenter, an ex-convict with a history of violence, was
arrested May 15 in San Francisco and later charged with
murder in the slaying of Hansen and the wounding ot Steve
Haertle, 20. He hasn't been charged in any other cases.
The eight trailside killings — seven in Marin County
north of San Francisco and Hansen's in Santa Cruz County
to the south — began in August 1979 and terrorized resi
dents who used the myriad of hiking trails which blanket
the Northern California coast and nearby mountains.
Court affidavits filed in connection with warrants issued
tor the search of Carpenter's house and car revealed that
Scaggs had told her boyfriend she was going to meet
Carpenter on May 2 to look at a car for sale in Santa Cruz.
Carpenter is being held without bail pending his arraign
ment next month.
Early retirement benefits may stay
Washington — The Reagan administration, in an at
tempt to make its Social Security plan "a lot more attrac
tive," is willing to discuss phasing in reduced benefits tor
early retirees and other compromises during a meeting
this week with House Democratic leaders.
"Maybe we can phase it in,. . . we're not against that,"
Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Schweiker
said yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Some of
these changes may have to be phased in."
