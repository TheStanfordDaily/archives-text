# Found at ASSU boathouse
## Stolen piano recovered 
### Mike Oneal 
A piano stolen from the Music De
partment at the end of fall quarter was
found locked in the ASSU boathouse
last week by the Stanford police. Four
students were charged with a rfiisde
meanor — trespassing on University
property — after admitting to the
theft.
According to police reports,
boathouse manager Garth Everhart
and seniors Gwil Evans. Doug Ogden
and Tom Strand entered the Music De
partment on the Knoll through an open
window. They allegedly wanted to
play the piano located in the woman's
bathroom lounge — a part of the build
ing that is not equipped with an alarm
system.
The students told police they felt
they were making too much noise in
side the building and, thinking they
might get caught, moved the piano
down to the boathouse where Everhart
resides.
"We were pretty damn drunk." said
Ogden. "We were raging and it was

just a prank. What else can you say?"
The four students also told police
that they meant to take the piano back
eventually but were afraid of getting
caught in the process. Police finally
found the piano after receiving a re
port that it was in the boathouse. It
was clearly marked as belonging to
the Music Department.
Although the boathouse is financed
and operated by the ASSU, that or
ganization will take no immediate ac
tion on the issue. In this instance, Ev
erhart's position as boathouse man
ager being ignored and he is being
considered a regular student, accord
ing to Associate Financial Manager of
the ASSU Cynthia Mathewson.
"The ASSU will not take any action
because we look at it as a prank more
than anything else," she said.
Everhart would not comment
The law enforcement authorities
are taking the same attitude toward
the incident as the ASSU, according to
Capt Miller of the Stanford police.
Charges have been lowered from the
original grand larceny charge, a felo
ny, to the current trespassing charge
in view of the students' apparent
motives
Prof. John Planting, Music Depart
ment spokesman, expressed his happi
ness at having the piano back and said
he wasn t surprised at the outcome.
"I expected something like that,"
he said, "but that's not to say I'm any
less upset about it. I figured it was a
fraternity or something that took it.
The boathouse is just another living
group."
