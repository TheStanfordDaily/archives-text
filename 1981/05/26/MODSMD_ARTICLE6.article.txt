## Mauritania walks thin line in Sahara war 
### Washington Post 
Nouakchott, Mauritania â€” In
a political realignment that
could lead to a widening of the
Saharan war, this desert na
tion's military government has
moved closer to its radical
North African neighbors, Alger
ia and Libya, in response to per
ceived threats from Morocco.
But Mauritania's military
leader emphatically denies that
his government has opened a
second war front against Moroc
co, the United States' principal
ally in the region, by siding with
Algerian-backed Polisario guer
rillas in their 6-year-old conflict
in the Western Sahara.
In an interview, Lt. Col.
Mohammed Khouna Haidalla
repeatedly dismissed charges of
Mauritanian complicity with
Polisario as "false" and said
the allegations have been
purposely fabricated by "the
expansionist Moroccan
throne." Haidalla's denials
were strongly supported by par
ticularly well-informed
Western analysts who referred
to recent Western military sur
veillance of northern
Mauritania's desert region
where guerrilla bases are said
to be located.
No Polisario bases
Western military intelligence
concluded recently that Moroc
can allegations of Polisario

bases on Mauritanian soil "are
not true to the best of our knowl
edge," said one analyst.
Three times Haidalla re
sponded "that is false'" when
asked specifically about reports
that Libyan, East German and
Cuban troops were aiding
Polisario guerrillas at Maurita
nian bases, that the guerrillas
had a base 100 miles due north of
here, that the Libyans were sup
plying Polisario with arms
along the so-called Khadafy
Trail in northeast Mauritania's
Chegga region and that, in
withdrawing from the Western
Saharan war in 1979, Mauritania
secretly ceded part ot its terri
tory to Polisario.
Haidalla said Mauritania
does support the Western Saha
ran people's right to self-de
termination. but has not. as has
been widely reported, recog
nized Polisario's Saharan Arab
Democratic Republic as a sov
ereign country.
OAU recognition
At last year's Organization ot
African Unity summit in Sierra
Leone, after a bitter debate, a
majority of the 50 member
states voted to admit the Saha
ran Republic as a member be
cause Morocco has turned a
deaf ear to repeated calls for a
U.N.-supervised referendum in
the disputed territory. The is
sue. however, was shelved after

Morocco and 2 other African
states threatened to quit the
OAU if Polisario were ad
mitted.
Algeria has openly supported
Polisario with bases and sup
plies since the beginning of the
contlict in 1975, and Libya re
portedly stepped up its as
sistance to the guerrillas in re
cent months. Polisario. several
observers noted, has increased
its attacks on Moroccan troop
positions in Western Sahara,
adding to Morocco's estimated
$1 million a day cost of the war.
One European diplomat here
said the conservative Saudi
monarchy, which views
Polisario, Algeria and Libya as
' dangerous, Communist-in
tluenced radicals," is substan
tially underwriting Morocco's
war effort.
The war is over a sparsely in
habited. phosphate-rich, 200-
square-mile desert territory
that was ruled by Spain until six
years ago. In November 1975,
Spain, under Moroccan pres
sure. ceded what was then the
Spanish Sahara to Morocco and
the Mauritanian government of
Moktar Daddah. The Maurita
nians suffered heavy loss of life
and saw their meager financial
resources depleted, and three
years later the unpopular war
led to Daddahs overthrow in a
bloodless Army coup.

In March, Mauritania im
mediately charged the Moroc
can government of King Hassan
with supporting a coup attempt.
Morocco denied the charge, but
Mauritania broke diplomatic re
lations. and within 48 hours
began receiving planeloads of
Algerian arms in Soviet-built
Antonov- 2 troop carriers at
Nouakchott's airport.
One informed observer here
credits the Mauritanians with
maintaining their neutrality in
the conflict, but added that
Haidalla, 40, who was born in
the border area between
Western Sahara and
Mauritania, "has never hidden
his pro-Polisario sentiments.
Haidalla. several top members
of his government and a large
proportion of the Mauritanian
population have ethnic and re
gional ties to the Polisario guer
rillas.
Mauritania is ar.xious to stay
out of the war because of the ex
posed position of its iron ore
mines near the northern town of
Zouerate close to the Western
Saharan border and Moroccan
troops. Iron ore exports make
up more than 85 percent of this
country's small annual export
earnings of $160 million. The
Mauritanians do not want to
give the Moroccans a reason to
invade on a "hot pursuit" mis
sion after guerrillas.
