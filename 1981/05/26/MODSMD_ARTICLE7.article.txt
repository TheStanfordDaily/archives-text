# Namibia chafes under South Africa's grip
## 
### Washington Post 
Windhoek, Namibia — Ben Afrika. part
time politician, part-time doctor, sat in his
office in the National Assembly and began
to list what the Democratic Turnhalle Al
liance regards as its accomplishments over
the past two years.
"Racial segregation as entrenched in
laws, that's been abolished," the colored
(mixed race) Alliance leader said con
fidently as the phone rang.
Turning his attention to the hospital staff
member at the end of the line, Dr. Afrika
said he was calling to inquire about a patient
admitted the night before with symptoms of
malaria. A few short exchanges followed,
then the conversation ended abruptly.
With the phone still dangling in his hand
and a look of pained exasperation on his
face, Afrika explained: "That's the white
hospital. She says since he's a colored. I
must call the colored hospital. That's the
system in this country." he went on shaking
his head. "I'm not defending it, you under
stand."
So much tor the Alliance's first ac
complishment. And so much too. for any
U.N.-supervised election sometime soon in
this territory tucked away in the southwest
corner of the continent.
UN election plan
Last January South Africa, which has
governed the territory for 60 years, backed
out of a U.N. plan for elections leading to in
dependence that would have put the Al
liance. a multiracial coalition of 1 parties
representing the 11 tribes of Namibia's 1
million people, against the Soviet-armed
South-West Africa Peoples' Organization
(SWAPO), a guerrilla movement fighting
South African troops here.
Instead, South Africa is pressing ahead
with a process that on Madison Avenue is
known as "corporate image building "
Treated as a province of South Africa since
it was seized by Pretoria from the Germans

in World War I. Namibia (also known as
South-West Africa) is fast getting its own
identity as a separate, self-governing state.
Ministerial department heads are moved
from Pretoria to Windhoek. A South-West
African Army is in the making. A South
west African police force has replaced the
South African force and shortly, the air
waves over Namibia's desert vastness will
be ruled by the South-West Africa Broad
casting Corp., carved off from its South
African parent network.
South Africa has set up a 60-member mul
tiracial National Assembly and a prototype
Cabinet that reports to the top South African
official in Namibia. The Alliance gained
control of these bodies when it won the first
one-man, one-vote elections in December
1978, held under South African supervision.
The Alliance's only competition was a
number of parties to its right.
Not backing out
All this does not mean South Africa is
backing out of Namibia; at least, not yet.
But critics of its actions believe the process
is inevitably heading to the point when Pre
toria will unilaterally give Namibia its inde
pendence under a pro-South Africa Alliance
government.
Officially, South Africa says this is not so,
that it is committed to an internationally
recognized independence for this territory
it has occupied in defiance of the United Na
tions since 1966.
The more benign view of South Africa's
actions is that it is attempting to give the Al
liance a forum from which it can make vis
ible changes to win popular support and un
dercut the appeal of SWAPO in preparation
tor a future election.
But, "there is no time," said black
Anglican Bishop James Kauluma. "The war
is going on now. We have seen the fulfill
ment of what we have been saying — that if
there is no settlement, there would be an es
calation of the war."

One cannot belittle the reforms in
troduced here over the past two years.
Regulations restricting where blacks
could live and work are gone; interracial
sex and marriage are now permitted;
blacks can own property anywhere in the
country. Discrimination in hotels, restau
rants and other public places is illegal with
tines tor offenders. There is equal pay for
equal work and blacks are being brought
into the civil service.
But in an attempt to placate angry, con
servative whites, many of whom are South
African. Pretoria has kept in place a middle
level of government made up of "ethnic au
thorities" with control over a wide range of
public services for each ethnic group.
Thus, the white ethnic authority, now in
the hands of a right-wing white party, con
trols white schools, hospitals, city councils
and white farmers' affairs, and "can still
exert an influence 180 degrees different to
what the DTA would do," said Windhoek
Chamber of Commerce chairman Kurt
Bohme.
Crippled
And if a government without a civil ser
vice is like a man without legs, the Alliance
could be called a cripple. The territory's
civil service is still largely staffed by South
Africans, and their record is one of ob
stinate refusal to abide by directives from
the National Assembly.
But the Alliance's problems are internal
as well. It is a fragile coalition, cemented
only by tear of SWAPO, which it views as a
Communist party dominated by the Ovam
bo people who make up 46 percent of the
country's population.
Its black leadership is lackluster and re
portedly chafing under the chairmanship of
Dirk Mudge, a white rancher.
"The Alliance is not different from the
system which has been ruling here for 50
years," Kauluma said.
