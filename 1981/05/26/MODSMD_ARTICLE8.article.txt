# U.S. to cut Vietnam aid
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
United Nations — The United States has
launched a global campaign to punish Vietnam for
its invasion of Cambodia by cutting off develop
ment assistance from international institutions,
and curtailing some humanitarian aid as well.
The immediate object, according to American.
West European and Asian officials involved in
planning the drive, is to put pressure on Hanoi to
open negotiations on the future of Cambodia and
an international conference under U.N. auspices
that is due to take place in Vienna in July.
Washington has already signaled its new
punitive policy, both at home and in the U.N.
arena.
Earlier this month, it rejected an export permit
sought by the central committee of the Mennonite
Church to send 250 tons of wheat flour to Vietnam.
This was the first such turndown of food exports to
Hanoi since 1975, according to officials of a hu
manitarian agency that deals with Vietnam aid.
At the United Nations, the United States and the
European Economic Community have refused to
respond to an appeal from the United Nations
Children's Fund — UNICEF — to provide milk
powder, butter oil and CSM (a high-protein food
supplement) as an emergency donation to Viet
nam.
Doubt results
Some officials have expressed serious doubts
that the U.S. campaign will achieve practical re
sults. In addition, tactical differences have de
veloped between Washington and its allies on how
to make the case against Vietnam at meetings of
U.N. aid age .cies.
Officials joth here and in Washington say the
Reagan administration has adopted the position
that as long as the Vietnamese divert their re
sources to the occupation of Cambodia, "We ques
tion granting any assistance to them."
American representatives will be authorized to
state publicly at U.N. meetings that aid to Viet
nam "amounts to subsidizing aggression," ag
gression that has been condemned by U.N. Gener
al Assembly resolutions, U.S. officials confirmed.
Diplomats from Asian nations opposed to the
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia generally
supported the American idea of checking interna
tional aid flows to Hanoi, but remain reluctant to
make the case this bluntly.
"We are loathe to set the precedent of linking
political acts to the flow of U.N. development
aid," said one Asian diplomat. "We would prefer
that the U.S. not articulate that reason publicly."
The Asians would prefer to make the case that
U.N. funds are going "into a bottomless hole" in
Vietnam, with inadequate monitoring, and that
future funding of development projects there be
"put on hold" until monitoring improves.
June forum
The first international forum targeted by the
American-led drive is a meeting of the 48-nation
council of the U.N. Development Program, which
convenes here on June 9.

That gathering must approve aid to Vietnam
that would provide between $94 million and $118
million between 1982 and 986.
Currently, the U.N. agency — which promotes
no-strings-attached aid projects that are con
sidered highly desirable by all Third World na
tions — has a portfolio of $49 million in projects in
Vietnam
Bradford Morse, a former Republican con
gressman from Massachusetts who has run the
development program for six years, admits that
the issue of funding for Vietnam "could be
raised" at the June meeting, but "I hadn't heard
of it."
The issue has been raised in the past by pre
vious American administrations — most recently
in 1976, Morse noted — and the Vietnam funding
"has always been approved."
One veteran State Department source admits
privately that although the Reagan adminis
tration would like "to kill the development as
sistance program for Vietnam if it can get the
horses, this is virtually impossible" in the U.N.
Development Program.
He noted that the majority of Third World na
tions on the governing council "are not about to
accept the principle that you can cut oft funding,
so it would be a losing battle."
Washington denial
Officials here and in Washington say that there
is no intention of trying to cut funds for Vietnam at
a meeting of the governing board of UNICEF that
is now going on here. Hanoi gets about $5 million a
year in programmed aid from UNICEF, plus
emergency food supplies for both Vietnam and
Cambodia. Since UNICEF helps out mothers and
children, it has always been treated as a sacred
cow. even by Congress.
"We have always tried to treat UNICEF as non
politica'," an American official explained. "Viet
nam is not going to arise here."
The emergency aid program for Cambodia is
scheduled to end in December, and until then;
U.S. policy is to "cut the line as close to human*
itarian relief and as tar from development as
sistance as possible, although there are some grey
areas," said a Reagan appointee at the U.S. mis-;
sion.
Even if the Reagan administration is unable to
stem the bulk of the aid flow to Vietnam, officials
said, it is determined to speak out on the issue.
UNICEF sought the emergency food aid dona
tion for Vietnam after another U.N. agency, the
Food and Agricultural Organization, reported in
March that Vietnam needs 384,000 metric tons of
food aid this year because of typhoons last Octo
ber and November.
State Department officials, while denying that
they asked the Common Market to reject the ap
peal, expressed skepticism about Hanoi's need for
these supplies. They again expressed the view
that Hanoi should either turn to Moscow for the
food or buy it on the open market with the money
being spent on the occupation of Cambodia.

areas," said a Reagan appointee at the U.S. mis-;
sion.
Even if the Reagan administration is unable to
stem the bulk of the aid flow to Vietnam, officials
said, it is determined to speak out on the issue.
UNICEF sought the emergency food aid dona
tion for Vietnam after another U.N. agency, the
Food and Agricultural Organization, reported in
March that Vietnam needs 384,000 metric tons of
food aid this year because of typhoons last Octo
ber and November.
State Department officials, while denying that
they asked the Common Market to reject the ap
peal, expressed skepticism about Hanoi's need for
these supplies. They again expressed the view
that Hanoi should either turn to Moscow for the
food or buy it on the open market with the money
being spent on the occupation of Cambodia.
From the Daily wire services
United Nations — The United States has
launched a global campaign to punish Vietnam for
its invasion of Cambodia by cutting off develop
ment assistance from international institutions,
and curtailing some humanitarian aid as well.
The immediate object, according to American.
West European and Asian officials involved in
planning the drive, is to put pressure on Hanoi to
open negotiations on the future of Cambodia and
an international conference under U.N. auspices
that is due to take place in Vienna in July.
Washington has already signaled its new
punitive policy, both at home and in the U.N.
arena.
Earlier this month, it rejected an export permit
sought by the central committee of the Mennonite
Church to send 250 tons of wheat flour to Vietnam.
This was the first such turndown of food exports to
Hanoi since 1975, according to officials of a hu
manitarian agency that deals with Vietnam aid.
At the United Nations, the United States and the
European Economic Community have refused to
respond to an appeal from the United Nations
Children's Fund — UNICEF — to provide milk
powder, butter oil and CSM (a high-protein food
supplement) as an emergency donation to Viet
nam.
Doubt results
Some officials have expressed serious doubts
that the U.S. campaign will achieve practical re
sults. In addition, tactical differences have de
veloped between Washington and its allies on how
to make the case against Vietnam at meetings of
U.N. aid age .cies.
Officials joth here and in Washington say the
Reagan administration has adopted the position
that as long as the Vietnamese divert their re
sources to the occupation of Cambodia, "We ques
tion granting any assistance to them."
American representatives will be authorized to
state publicly at U.N. meetings that aid to Viet
nam "amounts to subsidizing aggression," ag
gression that has been condemned by U.N. Gener
al Assembly resolutions, U.S. officials confirmed.
Diplomats from Asian nations opposed to the
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia generally
supported the American idea of checking interna
tional aid flows to Hanoi, but remain reluctant to
make the case this bluntly.
"We are loathe to set the precedent of linking
political acts to the flow of U.N. development
aid," said one Asian diplomat. "We would prefer
that the U.S. not articulate that reason publicly."
The Asians would prefer to make the case that
U.N. funds are going "into a bottomless hole" in
Vietnam, with inadequate monitoring, and that
future funding of development projects there be
"put on hold" until monitoring improves.
June forum
The first international forum targeted by the
American-led drive is a meeting of the 48-nation
council of the U.N. Development Program, which
convenes here on June 9.

That gathering must approve aid to Vietnam
that would provide between $94 million and $118
million between 1982 and 986.
Currently, the U.N. agency — which promotes
no-strings-attached aid projects that are con
sidered highly desirable by all Third World na
tions — has a portfolio of $49 million in projects in
Vietnam
Bradford Morse, a former Republican con
gressman from Massachusetts who has run the
development program for six years, admits that
the issue of funding for Vietnam "could be
raised" at the June meeting, but "I hadn't heard
of it."
The issue has been raised in the past by pre
vious American administrations — most recently
in 1976, Morse noted — and the Vietnam funding
"has always been approved."
One veteran State Department source admits
privately that although the Reagan adminis
tration would like "to kill the development as
sistance program for Vietnam if it can get the
horses, this is virtually impossible" in the U.N.
Development Program.
He noted that the majority of Third World na
tions on the governing council "are not about to
accept the principle that you can cut oft funding,
so it would be a losing battle."
Washington denial
Officials here and in Washington say that there
is no intention of trying to cut funds for Vietnam at
a meeting of the governing board of UNICEF that
is now going on here. Hanoi gets about $5 million a
year in programmed aid from UNICEF, plus
emergency food supplies for both Vietnam and
Cambodia. Since UNICEF helps out mothers and
children, it has always been treated as a sacred
cow. even by Congress.
"We have always tried to treat UNICEF as non
politica'," an American official explained. "Viet
nam is not going to arise here."
The emergency aid program for Cambodia is
scheduled to end in December, and until then;
U.S. policy is to "cut the line as close to human*
itarian relief and as tar from development as
sistance as possible, although there are some grey
areas," said a Reagan appointee at the U.S. mis-;
sion.
