# Stanford shopping center nears completion
## 
### Adam Goodman Second in a series 
The newest addition to the Stanford
Shopping Center is scheduled to be a
Neiman-Marcus department store
which should be completed by 1983, ac
cording to Rosemary McAndrews,
manager of campus properties.
A theater complex with decked
parking may be in the works as well,
although no details have yet been an
nounced.
The Neiman-Marcus store would be
the shopping center's 125 th store and
the sixth major department store,
joining the ranks of Bullocks, Em
porium, Macy's, I. Magnin and Joseph
Magnin. and Saks Fifth Avenue. It
would be located southwest of Liu-
Bank of America and Mama's Restau
rant, in what is now a parking area.
The theater complex would be on
the corner of Arboretum Drive and
Quarry Road, where the old Chevron
service station was located. Accord
ing to McAndrews, the theater would
have advanced ticket sales available
in the main shopping center and would
be housed in an "aesthetically attrac
tive building." She also said that the
University would "exercise some con
trol over what is shown at the thea
ter."
Neiman-Marcus and the theater are
both part of the final phase develop
ment of the shopping center, which
was originally opened in 1955.
Before that time the site was a hay
field mostly used for horseback rid
ing, McAndrews said. In fact, the in
terior mallways of the shopping cen
ter are now named after Senator
Leland Stanford's horses â€” Azmoor
Place, Clarion Court, Electioneer

Court, Lady Ellen Place and Palatine
Court.
Development of the shopping center
began after a 1947 study showed that
Stanford needed to use its land to
create income and to reduce its tax
burden since tuition was not coming
close to covering the University's ex
penses, McAndrews said.
"At that time a shopping center was
actually quite a farsighted thing since
there were no regional shopping cen
ters in this area," McAndrews ex
plained.
Initially six University-owned
buildings and three tenant-owned
buildings were built. By '974 the shop
ping center had 51 tenants but over the
years the physical appearance or the
center had deteriorated and competi
tion from newer centers was hurting
business. So in that same year a mod
ernization program was started.
The $17 million program of re
construction and revitalization was
designed in four phases. Phase I was
basically a facelift, a renovation of the
existing buildings with the installation
of new signs, trees, fountains and oth
er decorative measures. Phase II
added 80,000 square feet of retail
space and two new buildings.
By 1978 the shopping center was en
tering Phase 111 and gaining a
"Carmel atmosphere" as James
Nelson, director of facilities and prop
erties described it in January of that
year. Several stores were divided into
smaller stores and the leasing policy
was changed to allow for short-term
leases, to attract local businesses and
to ensure quality merchandise.
Phase IV is the final phase of de
velopment and should include the

Neiman-Marcus store, the theater and
additional parking.
During the renovation, the Stanford
Shopping Center bucked the national
trend toward enclosed, air-condi
tioned malls because the developers
believed that the Palo Alto climate al
lowed for an open-air center, McAn
drews said.
The rewards from the mod
ernization have been many as the
shopping center has returned to its
number one position in sales for the
nearby area. Customers and business
owners alike praise the aesthetics of
the renovated center.
"People have said that this is the
prettiest mall around." said Rosalie
Kavalarls, regional manager of Ten
nis Lady. "It's a nice place to work. "
The center's location has also been
an advantage to the stores. "The shop
ping center brings in interesting peo
ple because we are near the Univer
sity and the hospital," explained
Micki Pollock, manager and buyer for
The Company. "We also get a lot of
tourists."
"It's very convenient that Stanford
owns the shopping center because it's
a guarantee of traffic and of parking,"
said Grace Muchmore, owner of
Grace Muchmore's, the newest store
in the center. "The professionalism is
what I like. I tried for nearly two yeas
to get in but everyone wants in at Stan
ford."
The only complaints that shop
owners mentioned were parking prob
lems during home football games and
the number of art fairs and entertain
ment events scheduled at the center.
"Something like that (fairs and enter

tainment) is annoying because it tends
to hurt business instead of help it,"
said Irene Theys, assistant manager
of the Jewel Tree.
Though most store managers in
terviewed admitted that their rents,
of $5 to $40 per square foot, were quite
high, they did not complain. "The
rents are high but that is to be ex
pected, especially in this area,"

Pollock said.
According to McAndrews, the Uni
versity currently has no plans for any
more expansion or renovation pro
grams following the completion of
Phase IV. "The history of the industry
changes about every, 20 years, so per
haps there will be another change in 20
years," she said. "We follow all ot the
industry's trends."
