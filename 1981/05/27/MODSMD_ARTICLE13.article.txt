# When the Draw is over and there's no place to go
## How to find off-campus housing 
### Allie Giles 
So what do you do when you're
unguaranteed and you draw
3754? For the 1380 "unassigned
and not in assignable group'' un
dergraduates, it means finding
a place to live next year off
campus.
When to start looking for that
place depends on what you want
and how picky you are. For the
best places, especially if one is
not going to be here over the
summer, now is the time to be
gin. However, the Rental Hous
ing Office emphasizes: "Do not
feel that house-hunting needs to
be your first priority during
dead week and finals."
From Sept. 2-30 this fall, a
Clearinghouse in Tresidder
Union will offer the largest sin
gle source of rental listings, in
addition to a roommate-finding
service. The Rental Housing Of
fice boasts that 80 percent of all
persons using the Clearinghouse
find housing within four days.
For those who won't be here
in September, other places cur
rently to look include: the Ren
tal Housing Office itself, on the
third floor of Old Union, which
always has listings; ads in the
paper; bulletin boards and
kiosks about campus; and
always â€” word of mouth.
Friends who are off-campus this
year are often the best people to
ask for next year's housing.
Living off-campus has its
pros and cons. Many welcome
the chance to live in a more
home-like environment. Karol

Groswold, who lived in a College
Terrace apartment last year,
liked the privacy.
"It's nice to be able to curl up
with a glass of wine in front of
your own fireplace," she said.
But there are a lot of prob
lems too.
"You learn who your friends
are," said Groswold because,
"It's not as easy for people to
just stop by anytime." Also, "If
there's a roommate problem, it
tends to get magnified" due to
the close quarters, she said.
The surrounding area is ex
pensive, to say the least. But
students can get by on a budget.
"While rent is comparable to
that on campus, we find we

spend about half as much on
food, doing our own cooking,"
said Curt Langlotz, currently in
a house off campus.
The Housing Office, in its
booklet Finding a Place Off-
Campus and Settling In, lists
estimates of the costs of places
to live. A four-bedroom, un
furnished house varies in rent
from $800 to $2000 while a one
bedroom place costs anywhere
from $350 to $500 for a one
bedroom place to $45Q-$7OO for
three bedrooms. Rooms in
private homes cost about $100 (o
$275 a month.
One of the most common com
plaints about living away from
Stanford is the hassle with

transportation. Although 80 per
cent of commuting students live
within five miles of campus,
that can be a long five miles in
the middle of a wet, cold winter
quarter.
For those determined to get
on campus, there is always the
waiting list. The Housing Office
emphasizes that "students
should not join the waiting list
unless they definitely desire an
assignment and are prepared to
accept and move into that as
signment."
If one has a really bad
number, the walk-in assign
ments start on Oct. 6, when stu
dents are assigned on a purely
first-come-first-served basis.
