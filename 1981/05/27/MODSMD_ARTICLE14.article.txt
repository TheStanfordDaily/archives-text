# Health faire aims at awareness

Maintaining a high level of fit
ness is an athlete's everyday
job.
The middle linebacker who
can crush an empty Coors can
with his thumb and pinky finger
and the top-seeded tennis player
have to be in shape or they
might as well throw in the tow
el. However, according to Jack
Martin, who teaches "Optimum
Health and Fitness" offered
this quarter, jeven top athletes
may not be at their optifnum
level of fitness,.
"For example, Jim ("Jurfein,
a top-seeded player in the NCAA
mens' singles tenuis cham

pionship, is not very flexible. So,
I've been working with Jim, us
ing stretching exercises to im
prove his flexibility," Martin
said.
"Physical fitness is not lim
ited to being able to bench-press
300 pounds. Strength is impor
tant but it is just one of four gen
eral categories of fitness. En
durance, speed, agility and flex
ibility are also important,"
Martin added.
Martin, a graduate student
working on his Ph.D. in educa
tion, is the overall coordinator
of Health Awareness Day,
which begins this morning. The
main activity of the event is the
Stanford Health Faire, which
will be open from 10 a.m. until 3
p.m. in White Plaza.
Associated with Health
Awareness Day is "Stanford's
Greatest Challenge," a team
event involving eight tests of
physical fitness including run
ning, swimming and bike riding.
These activities will take place
at 10 a.m. this Saturday, start
ing at Angell Field.'
"This year we wanted an ac
tivity that the entire Stanford
community can participate in.
Last year we had a fitness run
but the very nature of the event
excluded people who might not
be as aware of or concerned
about their fitness level,"
Martin said.

Martin and his students, who
are coordinating the faire as a
class project, hope to create a
greater awareness of health and
physical fitness within the en
tire Stanford community. Sev
eral of the students will be run
ning the various programs fea
tured throughout Health Aware
ness Day.
Junior Trina Wiggins will co
ordinate an information booth
on stress management, where
individual assessments of cur
rent stress levels and tech
niques for reducing stress will
be presented.
"Stanford students feel stress
all the time. I think it's hidden
because not many people talk
about it." Wiggins said.
Wiggins will hand out a ques
tionnaire at the faire to help
people understand how well
they handle stress. The ques
tionnaire will determine wheth
er an indivual has "type A be
havior." Type A individuals are
people who experience a lot of
stress and may not know how to
channel it into positive outlets,
according to Wiggins.
Students can also find out ho v
much body fat they have rela
tive to their total body mass.
Such a test is helpful in de
termining how much of one's
body is healthy muscle, and how
much excess fat.
Other programs include blood
pressure and heart rate tests,
proper nutrition and diet in
formation, and "New Games"
which emphasize fun ralhe>
than competition.
Another program will be
directed at encouraging peopie
to reduce their intake of
saturated tats and cholesterol.
All of the presentations and
literature at the Health Fai
are free and entry blanks for
''Stanford's Greatest
Challenge" will be availablf
through today at White Plaza.
