Following the Faculty Senate vote two
weeks ago, freshmen entering the Univer
sity in the fall of 1982 will face a one-year
foreign language proficiency require
ment.
While we acknowledge the benefits of
learning another language, we question
whether the Faculty Senate has chosen the
proper means of increasing the number of
students who receive this aspect of a liber
al education.
The decision places an unfair burden on
science and engineering students, who are
already unduly handicapped and limited in
choosing course electives. Engineers face
up to 147 required units, including their
major requirements, writing requirement
and distribution requirements.
Other departments claim the School of
Engineering can make it clear to incom
ing students that they need to take a lan
guage in high school. We doubt this type of
communication would be prevalent.
Moreover, it might require students to de
termine early in their high school educa

tions that they want to study engineering.
It should be the function of a university
to foster its students' inner motivation to
become educated adults. This aim is not
facilitated by an over-abundance of re
quirements. The University should enable
its students to choose their own path to
wisdom, for it is only through making
those choices while at the University that
they will learn to make them after they
leave its walls.
Perhaps a more appropriate way to in
stitutionalize the study of a foreign lan
guage here would be to provide incentives
in terms of the current distribution re
quirements to take courses in a foreign
language. For instance, a multi-quarter
track of study in a foreign language and
culture could satisfy the Literature/Fine
Arts and Behavior/Language require
ments currently in place.
The advantages of studying a foreign
language are not at issue here. The means,
however, deserve more attention and pos
sible revisions.
