# Keep pass â€” no credit system
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate will vote tomorrow
on whether to maintain the present
pass/no credit system and add/drop dead
lines. The Daily strongly urges that the
current procedures be preserved, because
they encourage students to select from a
broad variety of courses.
A return to the "historical transcript"
(or use of the "F") would impose unneces
sary restrictions on the student body.
Grade pressure is strong enough without
the added worry of the failing grade. Re
instituting the "F" grade would create a
more competitive atmosphere without
significantly increasing the value of a
Stanford diploma or of a Stanford educa
tion.
Both the pass/no credit system and
add/drop deadlines give a desirable flex
ibility to course selection. Many students
would not choose more difficult courses if
this leeway were removed. These policies
encourage experimentation in a broad
spectrum of classes, which should be a
goal here. Many students are interested in

a course but would not take it if they did
not have the option of dropping it.
While students should realize that the
absence of the "F" grade on any Stanford
transcript is not entirely overlooked by
most graduate schools when reviewing ap
plications, the benefits of the current sys
tem outweigh the disadvantages.
Moreover, consciousness of this fact
should and does serve as an incentive for
students to not abuse the privileges of the
current policies.
Chiefly, students receive the benefit of
instruction regardless of a grading policy.
If the current system is changed, it may
discourage students from sampling the di
verse course offerings at Stanford. The
pass/no credit system and the liberal
add/drop deadline are unique policies
which help distinguish the "Stanford ex
perience" from the needlessly com
petitive, grade-conscious atmosphere at
other universities of similar reputation
and quality.
