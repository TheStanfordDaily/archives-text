## Strike threats jeopardize baseball season 
### 
Barring an unforeseen settlement, Amer
ica will be deprived of her pasttime —
baseball — Friday. One cannot show much
sympathy for either the players or owners.
If a strike should come to pass, it will be a
conflict between millionaires newly con
cerned about tax shelters and millionaires
who find baseball teams quite good ones.
It is hard to show compassion for the Reg
gie Jacksons, Dave Winfields, and especial
ly the Ronnie Stennetts who claim that their
million plus salaries are warranted as their
playing days are few. A player earning
$400,000 per year (not at all a rare circum
stance) will have made three times as much
in five years than will the guy making
$18,000 who strolls into Archie Bunker's
place after a hard day at Chrysler. And it is
difficult to understand how owners such as
the CEO's of McDonalds, Levi Strauss, or
Wrigley's Gum can consider themselves fi
nancially strapped. >..
On libertarian grounds, it certainly can
be understood how a Rod Carew chafed in
Minneapolis, having the choice of taking the
owner's salary offer or quitting the game.
Carew's value on the open market turned
out to be a million dollars per year, and he
was able to trade the great north woods for
the neon of Los Angeles. Carew's situation
was common in major league baseball
before 1976 as under the reserve clause in
his contract a player could only play for the
team which originally signed him until

traded or released.
The issue in the current dispute is the
owners' demand that a team signing a free
agent must compensate the team he had
been playing for with a player of com
parable ability. The players are ready to
strike as they feel that their free agents val
ue will be diminished if such a rule is im
plemented. Such claims are dubious as the
average salary in baseball is between those
of football and basketball, which both have
similar clauses.
In a bid to gain fan sympathy, owners hold
that the free agent system has made the
game less competitive as wealthier owners
can afford the exorbitant salaries being paid
some stars.
Further, Gene Autry's $10 million line-up
led the California Angels to a sixth place fin
ish last year, only seven games better than
the four year old Seattle Mariners, which is
a team full of nobodies. The free agent sys
tem may sometimes buy pennants, but with
the exception of the Yankees, most of the
successful teams in the last five years have
been built around players developed in their
respective farm systems.
Series between the Yankees and Dodgers
(no how much I hate the latter)
seem to be the most exciting because there
is so much tradition involved. If free agency
is responsible for giving us the first Yankee-
Dodger series in fifteen years, it can't be so
bad.

Baseball is popular since it has so much
tradition in comparison to other organized
sports. More importantly, it reflects the
changing seasons and thus fits nicely into
the favorite time of year for we non-skiers.
As the trees blossom and girls begin to start
wearing skirts and shorts again, one is able
to rationalize how the same lower-division
team of last year can win the pennant at all
is tabula rasa.
The long games on a long schedule seem
slow or boring. However, like the summer,
they are to be sipped so the rich and mellow
qualities may be savored more exquisitely.
Going to a stadium to watch a baseball
game is like going to the local stream. One
is more concerned about where the next
beer is coming from and the people around
than the game itself; but as one would no
tice if the stream didn't flow, one would no
tice if there weren't a game in the stadium.
Lastly, as it is apparent that the Cubs are
going to finish last again in September, all
other dreams of April turn to mush as we
prepare for the doldrums of winter.
So Bob Lurie, Wally Haas and Ray Kroc,
give up your demands as long as there are
suckers like me who will pay the price for a
ticket which will insure your profit
margins. Please don't take away my sum
mer!

ish last year, only seven games better than
the four year old Seattle Mariners, which is
a team full of nobodies. The free agent sys
tem may sometimes buy pennants, but with
the exception of the Yankees, most of the
successful teams in the last five years have
been built around players developed in their
respective farm systems.
Series between the Yankees and Dodgers
(no how much I hate the latter)
seem to be the most exciting because there
is so much tradition involved. If free agency
is responsible for giving us the first Yankee-
Dodger series in fifteen years, it can't be so
bad.

Baseball is popular since it has so much
tradition in comparison to other organized
sports. More importantly, it reflects the
changing seasons and thus fits nicely into
the favorite time of year for we non-skiers.
As the trees blossom and girls begin to start
wearing skirts and shorts again, one is able
to rationalize how the same lower-division
team of last year can win the pennant at all
is tabula rasa.
The long games on a long schedule seem
slow or boring. However, like the summer,
they are to be sipped so the rich and mellow
qualities may be savored more exquisitely.
Going to a stadium to watch a baseball
game is like going to the local stream. One
is more concerned about where the next
beer is coming from and the people around
than the game itself; but as one would no
tice if the stream didn't flow, one would no
tice if there weren't a game in the stadium.
Lastly, as it is apparent that the Cubs are
going to finish last again in September, all
other dreams of April turn to mush as we
prepare for the doldrums of winter.
So Bob Lurie, Wally Haas and Ray Kroc,
give up your demands as long as there are
suckers like me who will pay the price for a
ticket which will insure your profit
margins. Please don't take away my sum
mer!
