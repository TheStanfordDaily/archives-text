Bookstore rebate envelopes will re
ceive checks in the next week for : 4
percent of their book purchase total,
according to General Manager Eldon
Speed.
The Bookstore board of directors
based its determination of how much
to rebate on a projection of the store's
year-end financial condition, Speed
said.
"We were hopirfc that we would be
able to rebate about 8 percent, so we
were pleased to see that we had ex
ceeded our expectations," he said.
All of the rebates will be presented
to students in the form of checks.
Speed noted that the average envelope
contained about $200 worth of book
purchase receipts, so the average re
bate was about $28.

The store had originally planned to
offer a choice of rebates, either in the
form of cash or merchandise
vouchers, but decided to make all re
bates in cash this first year.
"We opted to forego the merchan
dise vouchers until we could work out
the details," said Speed. "I'm confi

incentive (rebates requested in
merchandise were to be slightly larg
er than cash rebates) in some form
next year."
Rebates were offered annually at
the Bookstore until 0 years ago, when
the program was discontinued for 1 fi
nancial reasons.
"Just prior to the discontinuation
(in 197 .) it was done as a discount at
the cash register called a 'prepaid re
bate.' This was discontinued when we
found we were giving more back than

we were making," Speed said.
Other factors than the over-rebat
ing also contributed to a shaky finan
cial condition at the Bookstore at the
time, according to the general man
ager.
"The discontinuation, came at a
time when sales weren't growing.
General economic conditions weren't
good for the Bookstore. We were just
coming out of a period of campus un
rest. The Bookstore was looked upon
as the 'Establishment' and conse
quently treated as such," he said.
Once the financial condition of the
store improved in the mid-70s, profits
were put in reserve for the expansion
project completed in the fall of 1978.
The following two years were con
cerned with keeping up with the swell-
