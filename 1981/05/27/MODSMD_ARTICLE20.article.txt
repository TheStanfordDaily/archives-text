# A 						bortion debate: rights of the fetus vs. parental responsibility

is simply a part of the mother's
body; there, aborting it is not
murder but simply the surgical
removal of unwanted tissue.
While there is no need to re
count Miller's compelling argu
ment that the fetus is at some
point in its team the "fetus-as
tissue" argument is no longer
intellectually tenable. By
almost any medical criterion
(including, as Miller suggests,
brain wave activity) the fetus
must be considered a person. In
addition, Dr. Bernard
Nathanson, one of the early
leaders of the pro-choice move
ment, has pointed out that im
proving medical technology
promises to push back the defi
nition of "biological" person
hood earlier and earlier into the
fetus' life.
Miller sees clearly that if pro
abortionists were to concede the
personhood of the fetus most of
them would probably agree that

abortion is murder and would
give up their fight. In recogni
tion of this he attempts to
salvage the pro-abortionists'
position by conceding that the
fetus is indeed a person, that be
cause of special circumstances
the killing of a fetal person
would not be murder but "self
defense." In making this move
Miller goes from a bad argu
ment to a worse one; in order to
avoid walking down a dangerous
rickety flight of stairs he opens
a door and falls down an empty
elevator shaft.
He characterizes the fetal
person as a parasite on the
mother's body. Miller explains
that the fetus "has established
itself inside the mother's body,"
and is literally extracting
nutrients from her blood
stream." The mother is thus
free to abort the fetal-parasite
because "no person, including a
fetus, has a right to livesubject
i ing another person to slavery
(italics ours)." From this point
of view-, abortion is seen as a
revolutionary action, freeing
the mother from fetal im
perialism.
It is difficult to tell where the
issue of responsibility fits into
Miller's arguments. In virtually
all civilized ethical codes the
death penalty (or killing in self
defense. for that matter) is ac
ceptable only when it is in re
sponse to a grevious crime or in
justice consciously and willfully
chosen by the perpetrator.
Miller implicitly recognizes this
by speaking of the fetus as if it
were a consciously malicious in
vader bent on enslaving its inno
cent mother. He compares it to
an adult who hooks himself up to
a woman and feeds off of her
blood and organs.
From his phrasing and
analogies it appears that Miller
recognizes that the fetal person
must be held responsible for the
grevious crime of an unwanted
pregnancy if the taking of its life
is not to be considered murder.
That he goes beyond recognizing
this to implicitly affirm that the
fetus is responsible is ridicu
lous; it is difficult to believe
that someone of Miller's ob
vious intellectual gifts would
take this view seriously.
Perhaps we are being unfair.
It may be that the issue of re
sponsibility plays no role in
Miller's ethical thinking at all.
If this is the case he must be
arguing that when one person's
needs severely interfere with

another person's freedom the
latter is justified in taking the
former's life. This would be true
whether the needy person has
willfully put himself or herself
in such a dependent position or
not.
This assumption has fright
ening ramifications. One would
be hard pressed to explain why
retarded people, cripples, the
elderly and other types of peo
ple who inconvenience and
"enslave" those who care for
them should not also be put to
death on request.
We may be drawing dire con
clusions from Miller's assump
tions that he might not want to
claim for himself. But whether
he does or not, it would be help
ful if he could explain how and if
the concept of responsibility fits
into his thinking on abortion and
also how he can avoid condoning
the killing of society's un
fortunates if he consistently ap
plies his argument for abortion.

Duty neglected
David Miller jloes an ad
mirable job of presenting the es
sence of the abortion issue,
stripped of the usual confusing
rhetoric (Daily, May 19). How
ever, I find this description of
pregnancy as "slavery" and
"forced labor" inconsistent
with society's existing notions
of duty.
Assuming, as Miller does,
that the fetus is a person, then
we cannot deny the fetus the
same rights we bestow on the in
fant. Whereas the mother-fetus
relationship can be described as
parasitic, the mother-infant re
lationship is more accurately
described as forced labor or
slavery. Society forces mothers
to provide reasonable care to in
fants by holding them legally re
sponsible. A mother who is neg
ligent In providing for the well
being of her child, or who tries
to end her slavery by eliminat
ing the infant, is punished by so
ciety.
Yet there is no question that
the infant deprives the mother
of her freedom. Those tasks
such a» feeding, maintenance of
a proper environment, and
elimination of waste, which
were previously handled auto

matically within the uterus, be
come very manual upon birth.
How can one justify this forced
labor in the name of the infant,
while condemning it in the name
of the fetus? If anything, the in
fant seems to be a more bother
some parasite, and yet there is
no clamor to exterminate this
pest.

Parental blame
David Miller passes pff the
usual issue of when a fetus is or
is not a human in favor of his
own peculiar case for abortion.
Miller argues that the fetus im
poses itself upon the mothei*,
virtually enslaving her. In self
defense, then, the mother has a
right to abort the fetus' life.
Even if we adhere closelv to
Miller's mode of reasoning; we
can find at least two flaws in his
argument. The most obvious
concerns the culpability of the
fetus. But first, suppose we go
along with Miller's assertion
that the fetus is guilty of "at
tempted enslavement." Is the
appropriate punishment for this
"crime" the death penalty? If
so, is it also acceptable for a
mother to abandon (or abort) a
whose cries for
food might well be interpreted
as attempted enslavement as
well?
A more important problem
with Miller's Jogic concerns the
culpability of tnte fetus. Did the
fetus decide to enslave its moth
er? Of course not. Its parents
are responsible for the action
which presents the possibility of
"enslavement." The fetus de
serves no blame. If one accepts
the humanity of the fetus, then
the case against abortion is se
cure; Miller's appeals to self
defense are untenable. The
stage should be returned to the
key issues of the human-ness of
the fetus.

Moral choice
In recent years, we have all
read about and listened to a pro
tracted, bitter dialogue regard
ing the issue of abortion. One
aspect of the argument which is
especially repugnant to me is
the attempt by some (principal
ly "pro-choice" advocates) to
define the less than fully de

veloped fetus as something oth
er than human. During life a hu
man being grows through vari
ous stages which are rather ar
bitrarily labeled such things as
infancy, adolescence and
adulthood. Similarly, prior to
birth the child may be referred
to as a fetus, or in the earliest
stages, an embryo. At no time in
its life cycle can it be called a
parasite, tumor, modified body
part, or anything other than that
which it genetically is: human.
While there is no doubt that it is
less developed than an adult, the
embryo is unquestionably hu
man and alive.
Furthermore, the embryonic
child is unique in its genetic
makeup; if it dies, that human
being will never have another
chance to develop to maturity.
Despite the efforts of Edgar
Cayce et al, reincarnation of
that baby in another womb
someday is merely a soothing
thought in the back of our collec
tive minds. The death of an
aborted baby is essentially no
different from that of a miscar
ried child, and there is no use
pretending otherwise. They
both existed, were human, were
living, and both unfortunately
died.
I say unfortunately in both
cases because they both had
something in common: neither
had any control over being con
ceived; but once they were,
their lives were taken from
them. The obvious difference is
that the miscarried baby was
the victim of natural tragedy
while the aborted child was the
victim of a conscious act of one
or both of its parents who would
or could not take responsibility
for their own sexuality.
There are times when abor
tion may seem necessary, or at
least justifiable to a degree:
rape cases, serious threat to a
mothers life during childbirth,
pre-detected major birth de
fects, and birth control failure.
In all these cases, however, the
decision to abort should be con
sidered in light of what justifi
cation, if any exists for taking
the life of a human being. This is
the ultimate moral choice of any
couple who is in a position to
have to make it, and is one
which no government legisla
tion can decide.
In the absence of laws, the pa
rents must realize that in the
fullest sense abortion means
taking an innocent child's life.
There are many moral decisions

to be made in life, but none are
as important as this.
It is horrifying when some
people cavalierly decide that
abortion is a quick end to their
"inconvenience," particularly
when they had the ability andre
sponsibility to prevent it in the
first place.
The point to be made is that in
sex as in all other aspects of life,
entails a hefty responsibility. It
is only in certain cases such as
those mentioned above that a
moral decision can legitimately
be made. Always keep in sharp
focus that fact that this is a
question of life or death.

Fetus' fault?
David Miller's column on the
"forced labor" of pregnant
women avoids a crucial issue in
the debate. He appears to imply
that a fetus has "established
itself" without the mother's co
operation. Certainly, the preg
nancy may be "contrary to the
mother's desire or intent," but
without the mother willingly en
gaging in sex there can be no
pregnancy. (Rape is a brutal
crime outside of this argu
ment.) It is the fetus' fault that
it was conceived? Should a de
veloping human lose the right to
live because some contracep
tive didn't work or wasn't used?
Unfortunately, this emotional
debate surrounding abortion is
not clear or one-sided. Restrict
ing abortions may infringe upon
a woman's liberty, but potential
humans will lose all rights and
life in allowing unrestricted
abortions. There are un
avoidable responsibilities as
sociated with sex which men
and women must consider if we
are to value all human life.

Fetus' fault?
David Miller's column on the
"forced labor" of pregnant
women avoids a crucial issue in
the debate. He appears to imply
that a fetus has "established
itself" without the mother's co
operation. Certainly, the preg
nancy may be "contrary to the
mother's desire or intent," but
without the mother willingly en
gaging in sex there can be no
pregnancy. (Rape is a brutal
crime outside of this argu
ment.) It is the fetus' fault that
it was conceived? Should a de
veloping human lose the right to
live because some contracep
tive didn't work or wasn't used?
Unfortunately, this emotional
debate surrounding abortion is
not clear or one-sided. Restrict
ing abortions may infringe upon
a woman's liberty, but potential
humans will lose all rights and
life in allowing unrestricted
abortions. There are un
avoidable responsibilities as
sociated with sex which men
and women must consider if we
are to value all human life.

is simply a part of the mother's
body; there, aborting it is not
murder but simply the surgical
removal of unwanted tissue.
While there is no need to re
count Miller's compelling argu
ment that the fetus is at some
point in its team the "fetus-as
tissue" argument is no longer
intellectually tenable. By
almost any medical criterion
(including, as Miller suggests,
brain wave activity) the fetus
must be considered a person. In
addition, Dr. Bernard
Nathanson, one of the early
leaders of the pro-choice move
ment, has pointed out that im
proving medical technology
promises to push back the defi
nition of "biological" person
hood earlier and earlier into the
fetus' life.
Miller sees clearly that if pro
abortionists were to concede the
personhood of the fetus most of
them would probably agree that

abortion is murder and would
give up their fight. In recogni
tion of this he attempts to
salvage the pro-abortionists'
position by conceding that the
fetus is indeed a person, that be
cause of special circumstances
the killing of a fetal person
would not be murder but "self
defense." In making this move
Miller goes from a bad argu
ment to a worse one; in order to
avoid walking down a dangerous
rickety flight of stairs he opens
a door and falls down an empty
elevator shaft.
He characterizes the fetal
person as a parasite on the
mother's body. Miller explains
that the fetus "has established
itself inside the mother's body,"
and is literally extracting
nutrients from her blood
stream." The mother is thus
free to abort the fetal-parasite
because "no person, including a
fetus, has a right to livesubject
i ing another person to slavery
(italics ours)." From this point
of view-, abortion is seen as a
revolutionary action, freeing
the mother from fetal im
perialism.
It is difficult to tell where the
issue of responsibility fits into
Miller's arguments. In virtually
all civilized ethical codes the
death penalty (or killing in self
defense. for that matter) is ac
ceptable only when it is in re
sponse to a grevious crime or in
justice consciously and willfully
chosen by the perpetrator.
Miller implicitly recognizes this
by speaking of the fetus as if it
were a consciously malicious in
vader bent on enslaving its inno
cent mother. He compares it to
an adult who hooks himself up to
a woman and feeds off of her
blood and organs.
From his phrasing and
analogies it appears that Miller
recognizes that the fetal person
must be held responsible for the
grevious crime of an unwanted
pregnancy if the taking of its life
is not to be considered murder.
That he goes beyond recognizing
this to implicitly affirm that the
fetus is responsible is ridicu
lous; it is difficult to believe
that someone of Miller's ob
vious intellectual gifts would
take this view seriously.
Perhaps we are being unfair.
It may be that the issue of re
sponsibility plays no role in
Miller's ethical thinking at all.
If this is the case he must be
arguing that when one person's
needs severely interfere with

another person's freedom the
latter is justified in taking the
former's life. This would be true
whether the needy person has
willfully put himself or herself
in such a dependent position or
not.
This assumption has fright
ening ramifications. One would
be hard pressed to explain why
retarded people, cripples, the
elderly and other types of peo
ple who inconvenience and
"enslave" those who care for
them should not also be put to
death on request.
We may be drawing dire con
clusions from Miller's assump
tions that he might not want to
claim for himself. But whether
he does or not, it would be help
ful if he could explain how and if
the concept of responsibility fits
into his thinking on abortion and
also how he can avoid condoning
the killing of society's un
fortunates if he consistently ap
plies his argument for abortion.

Duty neglected
David Miller jloes an ad
mirable job of presenting the es
sence of the abortion issue,
stripped of the usual confusing
rhetoric (Daily, May 19). How
ever, I find this description of
pregnancy as "slavery" and
"forced labor" inconsistent
with society's existing notions
of duty.
Assuming, as Miller does,
that the fetus is a person, then
we cannot deny the fetus the
same rights we bestow on the in
fant. Whereas the mother-fetus
relationship can be described as
parasitic, the mother-infant re
lationship is more accurately
described as forced labor or
slavery. Society forces mothers
to provide reasonable care to in
fants by holding them legally re
sponsible. A mother who is neg
ligent In providing for the well
being of her child, or who tries
to end her slavery by eliminat
ing the infant, is punished by so
ciety.
Yet there is no question that
the infant deprives the mother
of her freedom. Those tasks
such a» feeding, maintenance of
a proper environment, and
elimination of waste, which
were previously handled auto

matically within the uterus, be
come very manual upon birth.
How can one justify this forced
labor in the name of the infant,
while condemning it in the name
of the fetus? If anything, the in
fant seems to be a more bother
some parasite, and yet there is
no clamor to exterminate this

David Miller passes pff the
usual issue of when a fetus is or
is not a human in favor of his
own peculiar case for abortion.
Miller argues that the fetus im
poses itself upon the mothei*,
virtually enslaving her. In self
defense, then, the mother has a
right to abort the fetus' life.
Even if we adhere closelv to
Miller's mode of reasoning; we
can find at least two flaws in his
argument. The most obvious
concerns the culpability of the
fetus. But first, suppose we go
along with Miller's assertion
that the fetus is guilty of "at
tempted enslavement." Is the
appropriate punishment for this
"crime" the death penalty? If
so, is it also acceptable for a
mother to abandon (or abort) a
whose cries for
food might well be interpreted
as attempted enslavement as
well?
A more important problem
with Miller's Jogic concerns the
culpability of tnte fetus. Did the
fetus decide to enslave its moth
er? Of course not. Its parents
are responsible for the action
which presents the possibility of
"enslavement." The fetus de
serves no blame. If one accepts
the humanity of the fetus, then
the case against abortion is se
cure; Miller's appeals to self
defense are untenable. The
stage should be returned to the
key issues of the human-ness of
the fetus.

Moral choice
In recent years, we have all
read about and listened to a pro
tracted, bitter dialogue regard
ing the issue of abortion. One
aspect of the argument which is
especially repugnant to me is
the attempt by some (principal
ly "pro-choice" advocates) to
define the less than fully de

veloped fetus as something oth
er than human. During life a hu
man being grows through vari
ous stages which are rather ar
bitrarily labeled such things as
infancy, adolescence and
adulthood. Similarly, prior to
birth the child may be referred
to as a fetus, or in the earliest
stages, an embryo. At no time in
its life cycle can it be called a
parasite, tumor, modified body
part, or anything other than that
which it genetically is: human.
While there is no doubt that it is
less developed than an adult, the
embryo is unquestionably hu
man and alive.
Furthermore, the embryonic
child is unique in its genetic
makeup; if it dies, that human
being will never have another
chance to develop to maturity.
Despite the efforts of Edgar
Cayce et al, reincarnation of
that baby in another womb
someday is merely a soothing
thought in the back of our collec
tive minds. The death of an
aborted baby is essentially no
different from that of a miscar
ried child, and there is no use
pretending otherwise. They
both existed, were human, were
living, and both unfortunately
died.
I say unfortunately in both
cases because they both had
something in common: neither
had any control over being con
ceived; but once they were,
their lives were taken from
them. The obvious difference is
that the miscarried baby was
the victim of natural tragedy
while the aborted child was the
victim of a conscious act of one
or both of its parents who would
or could not take responsibility
for their own sexuality.
There are times when abor
tion may seem necessary, or at

Moral choice
In recent years, we have all
read about and listened to a pro
tracted, bitter dialogue regard
ing the issue of abortion. One
aspect of the argument which is
especially repugnant to me is
the attempt by some (principal
ly "pro-choice" advocates) to
define the less than fully de

veloped fetus as something oth
er than human. During life a hu
man being grows through vari
ous stages which are rather ar
bitrarily labeled such things as
infancy, adolescence and
adulthood. Similarly, prior to
birth the child may be referred
to as a fetus, or in the earliest
stages, an embryo. At no time in
its life cycle can it be called a
parasite, tumor, modified body
part, or anything other than that
which it genetically is: human.
While there is no doubt that it is
less developed than an adult, the
embryo is unquestionably hu
man and alive.
Furthermore, the embryonic
child is unique in its genetic
makeup; if it dies, that human
being will never have another
chance to develop to maturity.
Despite the efforts of Edgar
Cayce et al, reincarnation of
that baby in another womb
someday is merely a soothing
thought in the back of our collec
tive minds. The death of an
aborted baby is essentially no
different from that of a miscar
ried child, and there is no use
pretending otherwise. They
both existed, were human, were
living, and both unfortunately
died.
I say unfortunately in both
cases because they both had
something in common: neither
had any control over being con
ceived; but once they were,
their lives were taken from
them. The obvious difference is
that the miscarried baby was
the victim of natural tragedy
while the aborted child was the
victim of a conscious act of one
or both of its parents who would
or could not take responsibility
for their own sexuality.
There are times when abor
tion may seem necessary, or at
least justifiable to a degree:
rape cases, serious threat to a
mothers life during childbirth,
pre-detected major birth de
fects, and birth control failure.
In all these cases, however, the
decision to abort should be con
sidered in light of what justifi
cation, if any exists for taking
the life of a human being. This is
the ultimate moral choice of any
couple who is in a position to
have to make it, and is one
which no government legisla
tion can decide.
In the absence of laws, the pa
rents must realize that in the
fullest sense abortion means
taking an innocent child's life.
There are many moral decisions

to be made in life, but none are
as important as this.
It is horrifying when some
people cavalierly decide that
abortion is a quick end to their
"inconvenience," particularly
when they had the ability andre
sponsibility to prevent it in the
first place.
The point to be made is that in
sex as in all other aspects of life,
entails a hefty responsibility. It
is only in certain cases such as
those mentioned above that a
moral decision can legitimately
be made. Always keep in sharp
focus that fact that this is a

Fetus' fault?
David Miller's column on the
"forced labor" of pregnant
women avoids a crucial issue in
the debate. He appears to imply
that a fetus has "established
itself" without the mother's co
operation. Certainly, the preg
nancy may be "contrary to the
mother's desire or intent," but
without the mother willingly en
gaging in sex there can be no
pregnancy. (Rape is a brutal
crime outside of this argu
ment.) It is the fetus' fault that
it was conceived? Should a de
veloping human lose the right to
live because some contracep
tive didn't work or wasn't used?
Unfortunately, this emotional
debate surrounding abortion is
not clear or one-sided. Restrict
ing abortions may infringe upon
a woman's liberty, but potential
humans will lose all rights and
life in allowing unrestricted
abortions. There are un
avoidable responsibilities as
sociated with sex which men
and women must consider if we
are to value all human life.

is simply a part of the mother's
body; there, aborting it is not
murder but simply the surgical
removal of unwanted tissue.
While there is no need to re
count Miller's compelling argu
ment that the fetus is at some
point in its team the "fetus-as
tissue" argument is no longer
intellectually tenable. By
almost any medical criterion
(including, as Miller suggests,
brain wave activity) the fetus
must be considered a person. In
addition, Dr. Bernard
Nathanson, one of the early
leaders of the pro-choice move
ment, has pointed out that im
proving medical technology
promises to push back the defi
nition of "biological" person
hood earlier and earlier into the
fetus' life.
Miller sees clearly that if pro
abortionists were to concede the
personhood of the fetus most of
them would probably agree that

abortion is murder and would
give up their fight. In recogni
tion of this he attempts to
salvage the pro-abortionists'
position by conceding that the
fetus is indeed a person, that be
cause of special circumstances
the killing of a fetal person
would not be murder but "self
defense." In making this move
Miller goes from a bad argu
ment to a worse one; in order to
avoid walking down a dangerous
rickety flight of stairs he opens
a door and falls down an empty
elevator shaft.
He characterizes the fetal
person as a parasite on the
mother's body. Miller explains
that the fetus "has established
itself inside the mother's body,"
and is literally extracting
nutrients from her blood
stream." The mother is thus
free to abort the fetal-parasite
because "no person, including a
fetus, has a right to livesubject
i ing another person to slavery
(italics ours)." From this point
of view-, abortion is seen as a
revolutionary action, freeing
the mother from fetal im
perialism.
It is difficult to tell where the
issue of responsibility fits into
Miller's arguments. In virtually
all civilized ethical codes the
death penalty (or killing in self
defense. for that matter) is ac
ceptable only when it is in re
sponse to a grevious crime or in
justice consciously and willfully
chosen by the perpetrator.
Miller implicitly recognizes this
by speaking of the fetus as if it
were a consciously malicious in
vader bent on enslaving its inno
cent mother. He compares it to
an adult who hooks himself up to
a woman and feeds off of her
blood and organs.
From his phrasing and
analogies it appears that Miller
recognizes that the fetal person
must be held responsible for the
grevious crime of an unwanted
pregnancy if the taking of its life
is not to be considered murder.
That he goes beyond recognizing
this to implicitly affirm that the
fetus is responsible is ridicu
lous; it is difficult to believe
that someone of Miller's ob
vious intellectual gifts would
take this view seriously.
Perhaps we are being unfair.
It may be that the issue of re
sponsibility plays no role in
Miller's ethical thinking at all.
If this is the case he must be
arguing that when one person's
needs severely interfere with

another person's freedom the
latter is justified in taking the
former's life. This would be true
whether the needy person has
willfully put himself or herself
in such a dependent position or
not.
This assumption has fright
ening ramifications. One would
be hard pressed to explain why
retarded people, cripples, the
elderly and other types of peo
ple who inconvenience and
"enslave" those who care for
them should not also be put to
death on request.
We may be drawing dire con
clusions from Miller's assump
tions that he might not want to
claim for himself. But whether
he does or not, it would be help
ful if he could explain how and if
the concept of responsibility fits
into his thinking on abortion and
also how he can avoid condoning
the killing of society's un
fortunates if he consistently ap
plies his argument for abortion.

Duty neglected
David Miller jloes an ad
mirable job of presenting the es
sence of the abortion issue,
stripped of the usual confusing
rhetoric (Daily, May 19). How
ever, I find this description of
pregnancy as "slavery" and
"forced labor" inconsistent
with society's existing notions
of duty.
Assuming, as Miller does,
that the fetus is a person, then
we cannot deny the fetus the
same rights we bestow on the in
fant. Whereas the mother-fetus
relationship can be described as
parasitic, the mother-infant re
lationship is more accurately
described as forced labor or
slavery. Society forces mothers
to provide reasonable care to in
fants by holding them legally re
sponsible. A mother who is neg
ligent In providing for the well
being of her child, or who tries
to end her slavery by eliminat
ing the infant, is punished by so
ciety.
Yet there is no question that
the infant deprives the mother
of her freedom. Those tasks
such a» feeding, maintenance of
a proper environment, and
elimination of waste, which
were previously handled auto

matically within the uterus, be
come very manual upon birth.
How can one justify this forced
labor in the name of the infant,
while condemning it in the name
of the fetus? If anything, the in
fant seems to be a more bother
some parasite, and yet there is
no clamor to exterminate this
pest.

David Miller passes pff the
usual issue of when a fetus is or
is not a human in favor of his
own peculiar case for abortion.
Miller argues that the fetus im
poses itself upon the mothei*,
virtually enslaving her. In self
defense, then, the mother has a
right to abort the fetus' life.
Even if we adhere closelv to
Miller's mode of reasoning; we
can find at least two flaws in his
argument. The most obvious
concerns the culpability of the
fetus. But first, suppose we go
along with Miller's assertion
that the fetus is guilty of "at
tempted enslavement." Is the
appropriate punishment for this
"crime" the death penalty? If
so, is it also acceptable for a
mother to abandon (or abort) a
