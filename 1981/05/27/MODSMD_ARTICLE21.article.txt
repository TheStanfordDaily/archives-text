Today's forum represents
a variety of responses to
David Miller's column,
"Abortion opponents in favor
of forced labor" (Daily, May
19). Miller wrote that the
fetus imposes itself on the
mother's body, and that the
mother may abort the fetus
because "no person, includ
ing a fetus, has a right to live
by subjecting another person
to slavery."
