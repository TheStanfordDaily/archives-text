## Reagan weighing overhaul of pollution act 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Reagan
administration is considering a
drastic overhaul of the Clean
Air Act, including possible
elimination of nationwide stan
dards for air pollutants and the
"margin of safety" required in
defining a health hazard.
This could bring the president
into collision with key members
of Congress who have vowed to
permit only fine-tuning of the
controversial 1970 legislation.
While professing to agree with
that approach, those who are
preparing the administration
position have not ruled out ma
jor changes, according to docu
ments obtained by The Wash
ington Post.
The proposed changes include
transferring to state govern
ments the power to set stan
dards, eliminating the program
to prevent significant de
terioration of air quality in
clean areas, and redefining
health goals'so that Xhey safe
guard the public only against
"significant risk of adverse ef
fects." Current law bases its
pollution standards on the level
of air purity required to protect
children and asthmatics.
Split within White House
Working papers from early
April reveal major divisions
within the White House, how
ever. During his campaign,
Reagan criticized the act as an
impediment to energy develop
ment, but the amount of change
he will seek is still being ham
mered out.
The process involves a series
of meetings with trade associa
tions and industry lobbyists that
began two weeks ago to gather
ideas for the rewrite. Wqrk on
the amendments is divided
among at least four groups.
One, headed by Interior Sec
retary James Watt, is the Clean
Air Act Working Group set up
under the Cabinet Council on
Natural Resources and En
vironment, which appears to be
in overall charge. Another is
Vice President George Bush's
Regulatory Policy Office, a
third is the natural resources
team at the Office of Man
agement and Budget, and the
fourth is the Environmental
Protection Agency, which will
take the lead in presenting the
administration proposals to

Congress.
In an April 7 memo, the Watt
group outlined seven "issues for
review" on which Congress
could be asked to hold hearings.
They included methods by
which the act sets pollution
standards, the deadlines for
compliance, the federal-state
relationship, programs to pre
serve clean air and to control
acid rain, and the impact of the
act on the auto industry and
coal-burning industries.
But discussion papers sent to
the working group from dif
ferent parts of the adminis
tration varied greatly in their
approach to those issues. One of
the toughest, from Bryan Man
nix of Bush's regulatory policy
analysis team, titled "Federal
ism and Clean Air," recom
mended elimination of national
air quality standards for vari
ous pollutants, which form the
basis of the act. He called them
"inappropriate, as they take no
account of local conditions."
Instead, Mannix wrote, the
federal government could in
form the states about health ef
fects of various levels of pollut
ants, to help the states set their
own standards. Mannix agreed
in an interview #iat the shift

would be "a major overhaul" of
the Clean Air Act, but, he said,
"I haven't heard any talk that
the administration position will
be just a fine-tuning. The admin
istration is looking at basic, fun
damental change."
EPA viewpoint
However, another paper, un
signed but apparently from
EPA, assumed national stan
dards will continue to exist and
discussed the pros and cons of
easing them. Another EPA pa
per — the unpublished draft out
line of its position, which has yet
to be approved by the new EPA
head, Anne Gorsuch — also re
tains federal standards. The ad
ministration verdict on this is
sue is not yet in.
A third unsigned issue docu
ment, thought to be from the Of
fice of Management and
Budget, said swift adminis
trative deregulation of air pollu
tion control would be faster than
waiting for Congress to do it:
"As the agency (EPA) begins
dismantling the federal regu
latory structure, it will become
clear that there are no adverse
consequences of federal de
regulation."
But other papers in the series
ignored that approach. They

discussed autp emission stan
dards, regional costs and bene
fits of air pollution control and
the possible effect of changes in
the act on the coal market,
clearly relating all of them to
the congressional debate.
'Thinking out loud'
White House sources said that
the papers merely represented
"thinking out loud" and would
not necessarily be reflected in
the final proposals.
The EPA draft proposes
loosening health standards to
protect the public only from
"significant risk of adverse ef
fects" instead of "with an ade
quate margin of safety," a
phrase aimed at safeguarding
asthmatics and children. Such a
change is a goal of the Business
Roundtable, the steel and auto
industries and the Chemical
Manufacturers' Association,
but is anathema to environmen
tal groups.
EPA's draft also recom
mends further research on acid
rain instead of the reduction in
pollution emissions that Canada
and environmental groups have
asked for. It would give major
polluters a three-year extension
in their 1982 deadline for com
pliance with the law and would

replace the current alphabet
soup of site-specific technical
rules with one performance
standard for new pollution
sources. These are all major
changes.
Chairman wants 'fine-tuning*
But Sen. Robert Stafford (R-
Vt.), chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works
Committee, where the abt will
be rewritten, has made it clear
he wants only "fine-tuning" of
the law he helped to write. His
counterpart in the House, Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.)
chairman of the energy subcom
mittee on health and the en
vironment, echoes that senti
ment.
In fact, staff aides to both
chairmen said hearings on
Clean Air Act issues should be
completed before the adminis
tration submits its bill. That is
not expected until June 30;
meanwhile, industry chieftains
are making their case to the
working group.
Representatives of the coal,
electric utility and mining in
dustries were among those who
trooped into the Office of Man
agement and Budget recently to
dispense ideas, documents and
charts.
