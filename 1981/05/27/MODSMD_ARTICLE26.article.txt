# Argentine criticizes 'quiet' U.S. human rights policy

From the Daily wire services
New York — The distinction drawn
by the Reagan administration between
"authoritarian" and "totalitarian" re
gimes has largely eluded Jacobo Tim
erman, who is well-informed about the
subject of human rights.
That distinction remained unclear
even after Timerman — a former Bue
nos Aires newspaper publisher who in
1977 was kidnapped, tortured and im
prisoned by Argentine military author
ities for 30 months — met recently with
Jeane Kirkpatrick, the U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations; whose
views about human rights are heeded at
top policy-making levels in the admin
istration.
"How would you classify a country in
which 20,000 people have been kid
napped and killed for political reasons
by those in power?" Timerman said he
asked the ambassador. "That is Argen
tina. Would you call It an authoritarian
country or a totalitarian country?"
Because it was a private meeting,
the former publisher, who was expelled

from Argentina in 19T9 without being
formally charged with a crime, de
clined to discuss,the ambassador's re
ply. Mrs. Kirkpatrick said she does not
recall the question being raised that
way.
Nevertheless, the distinction be
tween authoritarian regimes, which
provide a measure of personal free
dom, and totalitarian rule, which seeks
total control over people's lives, has be
come an integral part of the adminis
tration's human rights policy. And that,
deeply troubles Timerman.
"Maybe you should ask some of the
"desaparecidos" — those who have dis
appeared — about it,"he sai'd ifi an in
terview last week. "Ask them — and
perhaps their jailers and torturers, too
— whether Argentina is authoritarian
or totalitarian. I don't think it would
make much difference to them."
Timerman, now an Israeli news
paper columnist, also responded
strongly to Mrs. Kirkpatrick's asser
tion, contained in a widely read article
she wrote in 1979 lor Commentary mag

azine, that "traditional autocrats" ob
serve "traditional taboos" and respect
"habitual patterns of family and per
sonal relations."
Painfully wrong
"She is wrong in the most horrible
way," Timerman said, noting that the
most painful scenes he witnessed dur
ing his Argentine imprisonment in
volved torture of families, whose mem
bers were beaten and sexually as
saulted in view of one another.
Kirkpatrick's statement, he said, is
"an obscene idea, a travesty of the re
ality in Argentina."
Timerman recounted the story of an
Argentinian teen-ager, surnamed
Tamopolsky, who was not at home
when Buenos Aires police came to
question him about suspected terrorist
activities.
The youth's parents, sister and
brother were home, however, and all
four were seized. Although they were
never formally charged with a crime,
Timerman said, nobody ever heard
from them again.

"I would suggest," Timerman said,
a cold look and closed fist belying the
emotion behind his soft, steady voice,
"that Mrs. Kirkpatrick ask this boy,
who is now an exile in Paris, about the
respect shown to families by an author
itarian regime."
Broader issues
Mrs. Kirkpatrick said she had been
referring to regimes in Nicaragua and
Iran, not Argentina. In any event, Tim
erman stressed to Newsday that his
concern lies not in a debate with the
ambassador but with broader issues
raised by the human rights policy of the
administration she serves.
That policy was underscored last
week in stormy Senate confirmation
hearings for Ernest Lefever, President
Ronald Reagan's nominee to head the
State Dept.'s Bureau of Human Rights
and Humanitarian Affairs. Lefever, an
ultraconservative scholar, advocated
"quiet diplomacy" designed to nudge
repressive regimes into more demo

cratic practices.
Having attended those hearings,
Timerman, a powerfully built, baldish
man of 58, bristled when recalling the
nominee's self-description as a genuine
advocate of human rights who merely
intends to employ different means of
implementing them. 'Quiet diplomacy
is surrender," he said.
"I am not fooled by this man, and
neither is anybody else," Timerman
asserted about Lefever, whose con
firmation by the Senate panel reported
ly is in doubt. "A silent diplomacy is si
lence; a quiet diplomacy is surrender.
This is the same kind of diplomacy that
so-called pragmatists in the United
States used with Hitler in the early
•9305."
Lefever and high-ranking adminis
tration officials are not simply talking
about a new approach, Timerman said,
but are advocating substantial changes
in the "ideology" that has governed
U.S. human rights policy since World
War 11.
