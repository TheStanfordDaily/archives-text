## NLRB upholds players' claims 
### 
Washington (AP) — In a decision that
could lift the threat of a strike by major
league ballplayers, the National Labor Re
lations Board's general counsel yesterday
upheld the players' claim that team owners
have bargained unfairly.
But NLRB official William Lubbers
delayed an immediate decision recom
mending whether the board will seek an in
junction to force the owners of major league
teams to reveal the financial status.
In a decision announced yesterday, Lub
bers said he would make a final de
termination on the matter tomorrow.
On Monday, Mark Belanger, Baltimore
Oriole player representative and a member
of the Executive Board of the Players As
sociation, said: "If we get injunctive relief
we would consider not striking. "
The players association has vowed to

strike following tomorrow night's games if
a settlement is not reached.
Don Fehr, general counsel to the players'
group, said of the decision: "We are pleased
that the Board has gone that far. The issue is
financial and they have been bargaining in
bad faith."
The owners' chief negotiator, Ray
Grebey, director of the Player Relations'
committee, was not available for comment
and his office said it had not received a copy
of the NLRB decision.
If Lubbers does go ahead and recommend
the injunction sought by the players, it could
be issued before the strike deadline.
"Theoretically, a judge could grant the
injunction within 24 hours," said NLRB
spokesman Thomas Miller. "And all we re
ally want is to beat the strike deadline."
The Major League Players Association

and team owners have been locked in nego
tiations for over 16 months on the only un
resolved issue in an agreement reached last
year — the question of compensation for
signing free agents acquired in the re-entry
draft.
The owners want teams signing certain
free agents to pay compensation in the form
of another major league player to the free
agent's former team. The players say if the
owners' compensation plan remains in its
present form, their mobility would be re
stricted in the free agent marketplace.
The players association, claiming that
the owners are using high player salaries as
an argument, filed charges with the NLRB
on May 7. The players maintain that the
owners' have failed to provide the financial
data needed to prove the necessity for the
free agent compensation.
