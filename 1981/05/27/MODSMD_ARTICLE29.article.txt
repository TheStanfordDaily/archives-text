Paris (AP) — Eliot Teltscher of the United States, seeded No. 10
in the French Open tennis championships, was ousted by veteran
Ilie Nastase in the first round yesterday, and then was involved in a
scuffle with the umpire.
Nastase, 34, came out of the shadows to win 6-2,6-4,7-5 with all his
old brilliance. For once, the tempestuous Romanian played no part
in the amazing scene that followed.
The umpire, Patrick Flodrops, claimed Teltscher grabbed him
by his tie and pushed him and used strong language.
Flodrops said he was reporting Teltscher to the tournament com
mittee. The 22-year-old American had disputed a line call on the
next-to-last point of the match and had been given a public warning.
Dozens of fans swarmed on to the court at the end in a confusing
scene.
Teltscher told a news conference: "I was merely trying to push
my way through the crowd and get off the court. I didn't know the
man I pushed was the umpire."
Teltscher was the second seed eliminated in the $611,000 tour
nament at Roland Garros Stadium. American Harold Solomon, No.
8 seed, was beaten by Italy's Adriano Panatta Monday.
Other seeded players survived the first round yesterday. Ameri
can Gene Mayer (4) downed Dominique Bedel of France 6-1, 6-4,
6-3; Guillermo Vilas of Argentina (6) disposed of Paolo Bertolucci
of Italy 6-2, 7-5, 6-2; and Yannick Noah of France (11) eliminated
Ramesh Krishnan of India 6-1, 6-1, 6-4.
Chris Evert Lloyd, favored to win the women's title tor the fifth
time, eliminated Claudia Khode of West Germany 6-3, 6-2.
Teltscher's scenes with the umpire culminated a dramatic and
fluctuating third set on an outer court. Fans climbed scaffolding
and tried to squeeze into the packed stands to see.
Teltscher led 3-1 in the third set, but Nastase came back to lead
5-3. The American then saved three match points and leveled at 5-5.
Nastase broke him again to lead 6-5. At deuce in the last game,
Nastase unleashed one of his specials — a flashing forehand that
sped across the court trom corner to corner.
Teltscher said the ball was out. The umpire ruled it was on the
line. Teltscher argued and wanted a linesman to inspect the mark
left by the ball on the red clay.
"Monsieur Teltscher, s'il vous plait," shouted the umpire. Then
he gave the American a warning.
Teltscher played on and the incident appeared over. But after the
last {Joint the tans went on to the court, umpire Flodrons came down
from his seat and the scene blew up from there.
