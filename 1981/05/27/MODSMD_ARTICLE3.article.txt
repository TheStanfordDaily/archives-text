# Additional victim found in Atlanta

### 
Atlanta (AP)— The latest victim in a string of 28
murders of young black men and children here was the
oldest and the largest, giving police more variables to
worry about in the already baffling cases, Public Safety
Commissioner Lee Brown said yesterday.
Brown identified the latest victim as Nathaniel Cater,
who would have been 28 years old Friday. Cater's corpse
was pulled from the Chattahoochee River on Sunday, and a
medical examiner said he had been asphyxiated — like at
least 16 other victims.
The addition of Cater to the list of slain blacks apparent
ly has not brought police closer to making an arrest in the
cases. "We do not have any announcement today in rela
tion to an arrest," Brown said at a nejys conference yester
day.
He said it was too early to tell if Cater's death meant a
killer was now stalking black adults.
Until Cater was added to tHe caseload of the special po
lice task force investigating the crimes, the oldest victim
had been 23-year-old Michael Mcintosh. Five of the last

seven victims were over age 20, but most of the victims
were between the ages of 7 and 17. Cater was 5 feet 10 and
weighed 150 pounds, while the other adult victims were
smaller in stature.
Also added to the task force list Monday was Ronald
Crawford, 22, reported missing last week, even though
Crawford's mother said yesterday he had called her the
night before to say he was in east Georgia picking peaches.
Brown said Crawford would remain on the list' 'until we
set eyes on him."
Authorities in Richmond County, which surrounds Au
gusta, began a search for Crawford yesterday at the re
quest of Atlanta police, said Capt. Gene Johnson of the
Richmond County Sheriff's Dept. He pointed out that it is
too early to harvest peaches there.
With Crawford on the list, the task force is investigating
28 murders and two disappearances. The other missing
person is 10-year-old Darron Glass, who was last seen in
September 1980.
