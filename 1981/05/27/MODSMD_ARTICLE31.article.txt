# Women rowers 4th in nation
## 
### Samuel Howe 
The Stanford women's
crew team came within
almost a second of placing
among the top three crews in
the entire nation, and al
though the squad fell just'
short of copping a medal in
the national tournament over
the weekend, the lady
Cardinals came off the water
and back to the Farm with an
impressive fourth place fin
ish.
Team captain Martha
Hoffman gave most of the
credit to women's coach
John Davis, who has "taken
a crew that couldn't beat
anybody two years ago and
made us national champs."
Davis, who coached the
crew team as a volunteer
last year and has been paid a
mihimal salary this year be
cause crew is still classified
as a club sport, led the team
to an outstanding season,
marred by only two defeats
in dual races. The first, to
Cal on May 9, was avenged

twice within a week as the
team defeated Cal both last
weekend and the previous
weekend at the Pacific-'O
championships.
At the Pac-lOs, which were
held at Redwood Shores, the
Cards lost in the finals by
four seconds to the Washing
ton Huskies, who went on to
win the national title.
The team also placed fifth
of a dozen squads in the Na
tional San Diego Crew Clas
sic, which was the first in
tercollegiate competition of
the year.
The nationals, which were
held this year up the Bay at
Lake Meritt in Oakland,
marked the first time that
the Stanford women have
sent an eight-person boat to
that competition.
"We were very pleased,"
said Hoffman, although she
added that their "big goal"
was to earn a medal in the
contest. The fourth place fin
ish does establish a hallmark
in the history of Stanford

crew, as the team had been
nowhere near the national
caliber of a team like UC-
Berkeley or the University of
Washington as late as two
seasons ago Hoffman de
scribed the finish as a "real
triumph for Stanford crew."
Practice since autumn
quarter — a typical crew ses
sion lasted from 5:45 a.m. to
eight — paid off for both the
women's varsity and the nov
ice eight, which placed sev
enth in the nation.
The Huskies crossed the
finish line in the final race,
among six teams, in a time of
3:20.8 for the 1000-meter
course. They were followed
by Yale at 3:22.9, and Boston
University at 3:26.5.
Stanford placed fourth at
3:27.8, followed by Wisconsin
and Cal.
In the competition among
the varsity fours, which
Stanford did not enter,
Berkeley took top honors.
