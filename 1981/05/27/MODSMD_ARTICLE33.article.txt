Saudis demand oil-price freeze
Geneva, Switzerland — Saudi Arabia struck a firm blow
against higher oil prices yesterday by retusing to hike its
price and forcing the OPEC cartel to accept a freeze for at
least six months
The Saudis also refused to cut their production from
about 10 million barrels a day, it was announced at the end
of a two-dav meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries
Saudi Arabia pumps more than 40 percent of OPEC s to
tal output. Its action in maintaining high production and
the lowest price in OPEC has produced a world surplus and
undercut the prices charged by other cartel members
Libyan Oil Minister Abdussalam Zagaar told reporters
that 0 of the 13 OPEC members agreed to cut production
bv at least 10 percent. Iran and Iraq joined the Saudis in not
agreeing to the reduction
Oil production in Iran and Iraq is far below normal be
cause of their war. and Saudi Deputy Oil Minister Abdul
Aziz al-Turki said Saudi output would remain unchanged
1 he Saudis now charge $32 per 42-gallon barrel of crude,
the lowest in OPEC. The cartel made an "official" OPEC
price of $36 per barrel at its last price-setting meeting in
Indonesia last December, but Algeria. Libya and Nigeria
charge more, with Libya the highest at $41 '
In New York, financial analysts predicted OPEC's ac
tion would mean gasoline prices in the I'nited States prob
ably would remain stable or even decline if excess oil pro
duction continues to flood market. They saw the price
freeze as meaningless without a Saudi cutback and said
there would be heavy pressure on other OPEC members to
drop prieesT;o sell theif oil.
Under the price 'accord, all OPEC members except
Saudi Arabia will have to stick to their current prices rang
ing from about $36 to $41 a barrel The Saudis, who now
have OPEC's lowest price of $32 a barrel, can raise their
price up to $36 whenever they want.
The cartel agreed on extending the current price range
after the Saudi oil minister. Sheik Ahmed Yamani, de
railed a tentative accord calling for a $2 price hike by the
Saudis and a freeze by all other members, conference
sources said. They said Yamani refused to raise his price
unless OPEC lowered its ceiling from $41 to $39 a barrel
Spain investigates bank incident
Madrid, Spain— The Spanish government has not been
able to determine who planned and financed the seizure of
a Barcelona bank last weekend. Prime Minister Leopoldo
Calvo Sotelo told Parliament yesterday.
Calvo Sotelo reaffirmed earlier official reports that
onlv 10 terrorists participated in the attack and that none
was a member of any of the state security forces
So far. he said, two of the nine persons under arrest have
been connected with the anarchist movement through
..heir police records, bui he adaed that there is no e\ idence
that the National Confederation of Labor, the anarchist
party, was behind the move.
He indicated that the government was still pursuing the
suspicion that it first expressed, just an hour and a half af
ter release of the hostages Sunday night, that extreme
rightists were behind the plot and that the 10 terrorists,
one of whom was killed when police stormed the bank,
were hired for the operation
Gonzalez, leader of the Socialist Workers, the No. 2 par
ty of Spain, expressed the widely-shared skepticism at in
itial reports that the bank seizure had merely been the
work of common criminals and anarchists.
"Nobody believes it."he said, and he insisted that the

investigation go "to the roots."
Begin patient with U.S. mediation
Jerusalem— Prime Minister Menachem Begin said yes
terday the Syrians are moving reinforcements into Leba
non but that he was patiently awaiting the outcome of the
I S attempt to defuse the Syrian-Israeli missile crisis.
Begin spoke after a cabinet meeting and did not
elaborate on his claim that Syria was increasing the esti
mated 22.000 troops it has in the country. *
I S envoy Philip Habib was in his fourth day in Israel
waiting for what Begin said was a message from Saudi
Arabia that would determine whether the American
diplomat should go to Damascus for talks on the crisis.
In Beirut, unidentified planes believed to be Israeli flew
over the Lebanese capital at dusk, drawing heavy anti-air
craft tire from ground positions in predominantly Moslem
West Beirut None of the planes were hit.
Lebanese police reports said the Christian city of Zahle.
30 miles east of Beirut, was shelled during the night and
three people were reported killed and seven wounded.
Zahle is one of the flashpoints between Israel and Syria '
Israel supports the Lebanese Christians there and on April
28 Israeli jets shot down two Syrian helicopters involved in
a siege of Zahle
Syria positioned anti-aircraft missiles in the area the
next day.and the U.S. mediator is trying to avoid an out
break of warfare over Israel's threat to use force to take
out the missiles if Syria doesn't withdraw them.
Israel also demands that Syria end its siege of Zahle and
that Syrian troops withdraw from the strategic Sannine
mountain ridge above the city.
Israel, in addition, wants Syria to pull back additional
anti-aircraft batteries that were deployed on the Syrian
side of the border with Lebanon as the crisis grew, and Be
gin says he wants a commitment from Damascus that it
won't try to shoot down Israeli planes over Lebanon.
Chicago transit system in trouble
Chicago— With one suburban bus system already idled,
the agency responsible for Chicago-area mass transit met
yesterday to consider raising fares 12.5 percent and cut
ting weekend service to avoid going broke and shutting
down all service by June '..

portation Authority, said the crisis might come Friday,
when payrolls for many of the agency's carriers are due.
The RTA has only $10 million on hand, Ford said, but will
have to meet payrolls of as much as $5 million for the Chi
cago Transit Authority alone.
The RTA already has cut off funding for public transit in
nearby Joliet. but that city got through its first working
day without buses yesterday with little problem.
The RTA was created by the Legislature in 1974 to over
see and subsidize mass transit in the six-county Chicago
area It is funded by fares and state taxes, and contracts
with regional carriers to provide transit service.
Police in Joliet. a city of 76,000 people 40 miles
southwest of Chicago, reported rush-hour traffic no heav
ier than usual yesterday, the third day without buses. On
Friday the agency did not receive RTA subsidies needed
for its payroll and when its 67 bus drivers learned they
would not be paid they refused to work Saturday.

armed with expressions of support from President Ronald
Reagan and French President Francois Mitterrand, easily

won parliamentary approval yesterday for his endorse
ment of NATO's plan to deploy a new generation of tac
tical nuclear missiles in Western Europe
The Bundestag (lower house of Parliament) in effect
gave Schmidt a vote of confidence on the missile plan. It

the U.S.-made Pershing II and cruise missiles on the conti
nent while at the same time undertaking talks with the So
viet Union designed to make the deployment, set to begin
in 1983. unnecessary.

Saudis demand oil-price freeze
Geneva, Switzerland — Saudi Arabia struck a firm blow
against higher oil prices yesterday by retusing to hike its
price and forcing the OPEC cartel to accept a freeze for at
least six months
The Saudis also refused to cut their production from
about 10 million barrels a day, it was announced at the end
of a two-dav meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries
Saudi Arabia pumps more than 40 percent of OPEC s to
tal output. Its action in maintaining high production and
the lowest price in OPEC has produced a world surplus and
undercut the prices charged by other cartel members
Libyan Oil Minister Abdussalam Zagaar told reporters
that 0 of the 13 OPEC members agreed to cut production
bv at least 10 percent. Iran and Iraq joined the Saudis in not
agreeing to the reduction
Oil production in Iran and Iraq is far below normal be
cause of their war. and Saudi Deputy Oil Minister Abdul
Aziz al-Turki said Saudi output would remain unchanged
1 he Saudis now charge $32 per 42-gallon barrel of crude,
the lowest in OPEC. The cartel made an "official" OPEC
price of $36 per barrel at its last price-setting meeting in
Indonesia last December, but Algeria. Libya and Nigeria
charge more, with Libya the highest at $41 '
In New York, financial analysts predicted OPEC's ac
tion would mean gasoline prices in the I'nited States prob
ably would remain stable or even decline if excess oil pro
duction continues to flood market. They saw the price
freeze as meaningless without a Saudi cutback and said
there would be heavy pressure on other OPEC members to
drop prieesT;o sell theif oil.
Under the price 'accord, all OPEC members except
Saudi Arabia will have to stick to their current prices rang
ing from about $36 to $41 a barrel The Saudis, who now
have OPEC's lowest price of $32 a barrel, can raise their
price up to $36 whenever they want.
The cartel agreed on extending the current price range
after the Saudi oil minister. Sheik Ahmed Yamani, de
railed a tentative accord calling for a $2 price hike by the
Saudis and a freeze by all other members, conference
sources said. They said Yamani refused to raise his price
unless OPEC lowered its ceiling from $41 to $39 a barrel
Spain investigates bank incident
Madrid, Spain— The Spanish government has not been
able to determine who planned and financed the seizure of
a Barcelona bank last weekend. Prime Minister Leopoldo
Calvo Sotelo told Parliament yesterday.
Calvo Sotelo reaffirmed earlier official reports that
onlv 10 terrorists participated in the attack and that none
was a member of any of the state security forces
So far. he said, two of the nine persons under arrest have
been connected with the anarchist movement through
..heir police records, bui he adaed that there is no e\ idence
that the National Confederation of Labor, the anarchist
party, was behind the move.
He indicated that the government was still pursuing the
suspicion that it first expressed, just an hour and a half af
ter release of the hostages Sunday night, that extreme
rightists were behind the plot and that the 10 terrorists,
one of whom was killed when police stormed the bank,
were hired for the operation
Gonzalez, leader of the Socialist Workers, the No. 2 par
ty of Spain, expressed the widely-shared skepticism at in
itial reports that the bank seizure had merely been the
work of common criminals and anarchists.
"Nobody believes it."he said, and he insisted that the

Begin patient with U.S. mediation
Jerusalem— Prime Minister Menachem Begin said yes
terday the Syrians are moving reinforcements into Leba

I S attempt to defuse the Syrian-Israeli missile crisis.
Begin spoke after a cabinet meeting and did not
elaborate on his claim that Syria was increasing the esti
mated 22.000 troops it has in the country. *
I S envoy Philip Habib was in his fourth day in Israel
waiting for what Begin said was a message from Saudi
Arabia that would determine whether the American
diplomat should go to Damascus for talks on the crisis.
In Beirut, unidentified planes believed to be Israeli flew
over the Lebanese capital at dusk, drawing heavy anti-air
craft tire from ground positions in predominantly Moslem
West Beirut None of the planes were hit.
Lebanese police reports said the Christian city of Zahle.
30 miles east of Beirut, was shelled during the night and
three people were reported killed and seven wounded.
Zahle is one of the flashpoints between Israel and Syria '
Israel supports the Lebanese Christians there and on April
28 Israeli jets shot down two Syrian helicopters involved in
a siege of Zahle
Syria positioned anti-aircraft missiles in the area the
next day.and the U.S. mediator is trying to avoid an out
break of warfare over Israel's threat to use force to take
out the missiles if Syria doesn't withdraw them.
Israel also demands that Syria end its siege of Zahle and
that Syrian troops withdraw from the strategic Sannine
mountain ridge above the city.
Israel, in addition, wants Syria to pull back additional
anti-aircraft batteries that were deployed on the Syrian
side of the border with Lebanon as the crisis grew, and Be
gin says he wants a commitment from Damascus that it
won't try to shoot down Israeli planes over Lebanon.

been connected with the anarchist movement through
..heir police records, bui he adaed that there is no e\ idence
that the National Confederation of Labor, the anarchist
party, was behind the move.

rightists were behind the plot and that the 10 terrorists,
one of whom was killed when police stormed the bank,
were hired for the operation

itial reports that the bank seizure had merely been the
work of common criminals and anarchists.

Jerusalem— Prime Minister Menachem Begin said yes
terday the Syrians are moving reinforcements into Leba
non but that he was patiently awaiting the outcome of the
I S attempt to defuse the Syrian-Israeli missile crisis.

elaborate on his claim that Syria was increasing the esti
mated 22.000 troops it has in the country. *

Lebanese police reports said the Christian city of Zahle.
30 miles east of Beirut, was shelled during the night and

Israel supports the Lebanese Christians there and on April
28 Israeli jets shot down two Syrian helicopters involved in
a siege of Zahle
Syria positioned anti-aircraft missiles in the area the
next day.and the U.S. mediator is trying to avoid an out
break of warfare over Israel's threat to use force to take
out the missiles if Syria doesn't withdraw them.
Israel also demands that Syria end its siege of Zahle and
that Syrian troops withdraw from the strategic Sannine
mountain ridge above the city.

anti-aircraft batteries that were deployed on the Syrian
side of the border with Lebanon as the crisis grew, and Be
gin says he wants a commitment from Damascus that it
won't try to shoot down Israeli planes over Lebanon.

southwest of Chicago, reported rush-hour traffic no heav
ier than usual yesterday, the third day without buses. On
Friday the agency did not receive RTA subsidies needed
for its payroll and when its 67 bus drivers learned they
would not be paid they refused to work Saturday.
