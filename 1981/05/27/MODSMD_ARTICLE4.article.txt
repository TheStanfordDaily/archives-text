# Phelps voted in as chair of the 1981-82 ASSU Senate
## 
### Richard Klingler 
The ASSU Senate last night chose
Senior David Phelps as the senate
chair and requested that the Faculty
Senate postpone decision on proposed
reinstitution of the "F" grade and
changes in the pass/no credit option.
The senate chose Phelps by ac
clamation from a field of five can
didates after three hours of debate.
The senate chair is responsible for
conducting senate meetings, coordi
nating action of the senate, linking dif
ferent divisions of the ASSU and serv
ing as the student representative to
various segments of the University
community.
Phelps stressed his "knowledge and
experience within the ASSU" and
promised to channel senators' en
thusiasm while at the same time de
fining the issues that will occupy the
senate's efforts next year. He said the
senate chair's principal role will be
directing the senate's efforts rather
than taking particular positions be
cause "the chair is an unbiased posi
tion."

Phelps presented himself as "a
source of information" about the
ASSU in addition to a senate leader be
cause he has experience within the
student government. Phelps served
last year as an ASSU senator on the in
fluential Finance Committee, which
conducted concert issue hearings and
determined fund appropriations.
Phelps has also served on the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
and was chairman of the Academic
Organization Board (AOB).
During senate discussion of the can
didates, outgoing Senate Chair Doug
Mitchell said the principal require
ments of any senate leader are or
ganizational skills, the ability to com
municate effectively and charisma.
After Phelps was chosen as senate
chair, Mitchell said the senate had
chosen a leader possessing those nec
essary abilities. '
Senators expressed confidence in
Phelps' leadership abilities but con
curred that his knowledge of the or
ganization and reputation as an effec
tive and dedicated senator last year

are his primary strengths. Alternate
Senator Rick Naimark said, we (the
senators) will be the driving force of
the senate — not the senate chair. '
The senate chose Senator Roc
Blumenthal to be deputy senate chair,
a position supplementing the efforts of
the senate chair. Blumenthal said
"the deputy chair has no real function
in itself," but promised to make the
position a source of information that
additionally will assume many of the
chair's organizational duties.
Blumenthal received the highest
number of votes of any senator during
this quarter's election.
The senate also unanimously passed
a resolution recommending that the
Faculty Senate "postpone any pro
posal to change the pass/fail,
add/drop, and F-grade status" until
the issue is further explored The Fac
ulty Senate is scheduled to vote on
grading procedure changes tomorrow.
Senators expressed reservations
that students have not been consulted
and that the rationale motivating any
changes has not been fully articulated.
Senators suggested that proposed
changes will limit student experimen
tation in choosing classes without re
ducing "grade inflation," the sup
posedly disproportionate number of
high grades. Reducing the perceived
high percentage of A and B grades
granted by professors is often present
ed as a reason for accepting the pro
posed changes.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Chris Greene attacked the pos
sible grading procedure revisions by
saying, "The proposed changes would
do nothing but limit students' op
portunity tQr plan their own educa
tion."
