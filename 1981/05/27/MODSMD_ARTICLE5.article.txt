# Speakers warn about effects of a world-wide nuclear war
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Talking about surviving or even
winning a nuclear war ignores the
problems such a war would create,
said Drs. Herbert Abrams and Kosta
Tsipis last night before a half-full
Kresge Auditorium.
The event opened a five-day pro
gram of debates and talks focusing on
the world's weapons crisis, organized
by the newly formed student group,
the Stanford Arms Control and Dis
armament Forum.
Abrams, director of radiology at the
Harvard Medical School, and Tsipis,
associate director of the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology's Center
for International Studies, spoke on the
medical and environmental conse
quences of nuclear war.
Abrams said that though all of the
gruesome information he presented
was taken from government studies,
policy makers are not aware of it. He
and Tsipis agreed there is no "consti
tuency" for control of nuclear weap
ons. To remedy the situation, they
stressed the need for educating the
public.
"Many people are embarrassed be

cause they think that they cannot un
derstand nuclear weapons," Tsipis
said. "But nuclear weapons are easy
to understand."
Some strategists may talk about
winning a nuclear war, but Abrams
asked, "What does winning mean?
What is the meaning of survival?" He
pointed, to gtaverment studies
projecting only 95 million survivors in
the U.S. after a nuclear attack, 34 mil
lion of whom would be injured.
"Nuclear war is not winnable. It is
not a policy option," Abrams said.
Abrams described a world of devas
tation following a nuclear war based
on a government study of a 60-mega
ton nuclear exchange between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
The survivors would face unlikely
odds. Burying the 130 million dead
would require an area twice as large
as San Francisco. Survivors would
have difficulty obtaining food, since
population centers are far from agri
cultural areas. With most medical fa
cilities and supplies destroyed, taking
care of the sick and preventing
epidemics would be impossible.
No crisis on this scale has ever been

experienced, said Abrams. The medi
cal problems would be enormous since
resistance to disease as well as the ef
fectiveness of anti-biotics is reduced
by radiation.
Evacuating city dwellers would not
likely be any help, according to
Abrams, because less protection from
radiation exists in the countryside.
Abrams said that the optimism of
people like Paul Nitze, a nuclear arms
analyst who talks about "winning" nu
clear war, stems from a lack of under
standing of the problem.
Nitze, said Abrams. was one of the
first Americans to visit Hiroshima but
reported that nothing had realy hap
pened."He saw life go back to normal
in a month," Abrams said, adding that
Nitze did not realize that the help
came from parts ot Japan unaffected
by the blast. In a large nuclear war.
Abrams went on, there would no out
side help.
And it is doubtful that many would
survive the physical destruction of the
explosions themselves, even if the
medical and logistical problems could
be overcome.
The sheer physical destruction of
just an average-sized, one-megaton
weapon (the equivalent of a train
loaded with TNT 200 miles long) would
cause excessive destruction.
The fireball that is created by a nu
clear explosion is so destructive,
Tsipis said, that when one talks about
a nuclear war it becomes impossible
to talk about protecting human popu
lations.
The thermal radition would give ev
eryone within a '0-km. range second
degree burns. The heat would create a
fire-storm that could rage for days, re
moving all oxygen from the area and
killing anyone hiding in a shelter.
The blast itself would cause a pres
sure shock wave that could hurl a per
son against a wall with several times
the force of gravity three miles away
from detonation. "It's like when you
flick an insect with your finger,"
Tsipis said. Closer to the blast "people
and furniture would get swept out of
the structures into the streets."
Another shock wave would cause
debris to fly at velocities above 100
miles per hour.
Any weapon detonating near the
ground will vaporize soil and turn it
into radioactive fallout. The shock
waves would be like a major earth
quake.
Among the more esoteric effects of
a nuclear blast is the creation of a
giant electromagnetic pulse that
would destroy electrical circuits for

tens of miles around.
"It would incapacitate telephone
and power lines much beyond the area
of the blast effects of the explosion,"
Tsipis pointed out. "All communica
tion equipment would be destroyed."
And of course there is radiation. Ev
eryone within a mile receiving 100
rads or more would get radiation
sickness and die. "It is hard to under
stand why people worry about the 7
Curies of radiation released out of
Three-Mile Island," Tsipis said,
"compared to the 100 thousand million
curies from such a blast."
A nuclear war would "collapse the
ecosystem" by destroying half of the
the earth's protective ozone layer,
Tsipis said Ultraviolet radiation
would cause blindness and then death
in most animals on earth, he added.
