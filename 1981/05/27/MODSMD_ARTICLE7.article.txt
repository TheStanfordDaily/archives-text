## Paradise found: Stanford's Biological Preserve, Jasper Ridge 
### Tyler Ochoa 
The air is calm and invigorat
mgly fresh. Tall, green grasses
cover a hillside generously
sprinkled with large oak trees.
Birds sing and crickets chirp un
der a cloudless blue sky.
This is Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, a micro
cosm of California ecology, and
the University's own natural
laboratory for field research in
the sciences.
Jasper Ridge is unique. It pro
vides professors and students
with an incredible diversity of
plant and animal life, protected
from outside disturbances, only
a few minutes' drive — and a
slightly longer bike ride — from
their classrooms. It is the only
research preserve of its kind on
an American university cam
pus.
Within its 1200 acres can be
found every type of inland plant
community that exists on the
Peninsula, ffom fresh water

swamp to dry chaparral.
Redwoods grow along San Fran
cisquito Creek; five types of
oaks grow in the woodlands.
Wide expanses of open
grassland border shady ever
green forests.
Each of these communities
grows best in different types of
soil. At Jasper Ridge, these
soils lie side by side, creating
abrupt borders between com
munities more clearly defined
than those of any city. It is
therefore ideally suited for
comparative research.
Jasper Ridge has been used
for biological study since the
University opened in '891. One
of the first scientists to use the
Ridge was Stanford's first pres
ident, David Starr Jordan, who
collected and classified fishes
from San Francisquito Creek.
The first Ph.D. thesis based
on Jasper Ridge research was
submitted in 1897. Nearly 100
doctoral degrees have been
earned through research there
since.
One of Jasper Ridge's

greatest contributions is Prof.
Paul Ehrlich's continuing re
search on Checkerspot but
terflies. Since '960, Ehrlich and
his students have differentiated
three distinct populations and
have extensively studied
changes in the populations and
their links to genetic and en
vironmental factors. Their
work is now considered a land
mark in the field of population
biology.
Since 1975 the University has
conducted guided tours, of the
Jasper Ridge Preserve. Cur
rently, there are 46 adult and
student docents who last year
led more than 3000 people
through the preserve.
Stepping through the gate in
the eight-foot-high fence that
surrounds the preserve is like
stepping through a looking-glass
into the wilderness of Califor
nia's past.
The first landmark on the
trail is a large bush of poison oak
— a silent warning to those who
would disobey the rules about
wandering off the trail.
The path curves along the hill
side, which is covered with har
dy California bunch grasses.
The docent stops to point out a
few of the splendidly-colored
wildflowers that grow here.
Tiny yellow goldfields lure a
new breed of treasure-hunters.
California Poppies, the state
flower, attract the patient eye
and steady hand of an amateur
photographer. Flowers are
named for animals they re
semble': Stork's Bill, Hound's
Tongue and Owl's Clover.
This wide variety of wild
flowers is due to the presence of
a greenish rock known as
serpentine. The soil that lies on
serpentine is mildly toxic to
plants. Thus, while a number of
plants can survive, none has
thrived well enough to overrun
the others.
The protected status of
Jasper Ridge is a tribute to the
perseverance of the Stanford
community, for the future of the
Ridge as a research area was
imperiled several times during
its history.
In 1890 the Spring Valley Wa
ter Company impounded
Searsville Lake, which lies ad
jacent to the Ridge, to increase
its supply of drinking water for
San Francisco. The water
proved unsuitable for drinking,
and the lake and adjoining lands
were sold to Stanford in .9'.3.
Military training exercises
were held on the Ridge during
World War I.
In the late 1910s, Dr. A.C. Ves
tal fenced off several small
areas to keep out cattle. His ex
periment showed that the cattle
were overgrazing the natural
vegetation, allowing imported
European grasses to overrun

the Ridge. It was not until '960,
however, that cattle grazing
was banned.
In '961, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers proposed that a
dam be built on San Francis
quito Creek, downstream from
Searsville Lake. This would
have flooded all of the redwood
communities on Jasper Ridge.
The University and several
community groups banded to
gether to fight against the pro
posed dam. The project was
finally killed by Congress in
1967.
Jasper Ridge was designated
a "Biological Experimental
Area'' by the University in '956.
However, as the surrounding
area became more developed,
the Ridge became increasingly
popular with hikers, picnickers

and horseback riders. Problems
arose with those visitors dis
turbing the natural ecology.
Stanford closed the area to
the public in 1960. but the lack of
fences made the ban hard to en
force. By * 970 most of the Ridge
was fenced off, and in 1973 the
University Board of Trustees of
ficially declared 960 acres to be
a biological preserve.
Problems continued, how
ever. Searsville Lake, which
had been rented out since '922
for use as a recreational park,
was becoming very popular. By
1975 over 100,000 people used the
lake annually, and many hikers
trespassed into the preserve.
Scientists found equipment ru
ined or stolen by vandals.
In addition, the State Health
Department was suggesting

that Stanford might have to
treat the water for the safety of
swimmers. Biologists protested
that this would upset the
ecological balance down
stream.
Finally, in the fall of '976, an
anonymous gift enabled the
Board of Trustees to close the
land to the public, expanding the
biological preserve to 1300
acres.
The value of preserving
Jasper Ridge has now in
creased. It is the only research
preserve in the Santa Cruz
mountains, and it is one of the
last naturally vegetated open
spaces on the Peninsula. Pro
tection assures that its beauty
and ecology will be available to
both scientists and laymen in
future years.
