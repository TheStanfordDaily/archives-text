# Ehrlich discusses death of earth's ecosystem
## 
### Andreas Becker 
Studies and books dealing
with humanity's impending
doom have proliferated in re
cent years. Critics call these
scientists and populizers
"doomsday prophets." They
warn of overpopulation, the
depletion of our natural re
sources, the melting of the ice
caps and the collapse of the
world's ecosystem if we do not
mend our ways.
Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a Stan
ford population biologist, en
tered public debate over the
world's ecosystem with his book
Population Bomb back in '.966.
Now he and his wife Ann, senior
research assistant at the
Biology Dept., have published a
new book, Extinction, on "the
causes and consequences of the
disappearance of species."
Extinction is a book on hu
manity's attitude towards our
environment, on our under
standing of the mechanisms
that created and maintain it,
and the dangers it is exposed to
today: species of plants and
animals are going extinct.
But isn't extinction a natural
and integral part of evolution?
Species have gone extinct all the
time: look at the dinosaurs!
"That's right," says Paul
Ehrlich, but "it is a matter of
rate. In other words, there are
two balanced processes. One is
speciation, creating diversity,
and the other is extinction,
which is losing diversity."
Humanity has intervened to
greatly increase the rate of ex
tinction (of all species) and to
reduce the overall probability of
speciation.
"There have been extinctions
in the past, maybe ones as big as
the one we are facing now. But
humanity was not trying to exist
at that time. In other words, we

have not only to ask what are the
consequences for the rest of the
biota, but what are the conse
quences going to be for us in this
huge episode of extinction which
we are going to bring about?"
asks Ehrlich.
"The fact that we are bring
ing about the extinction of other
organisms, however, does not

mean that we will be able to lean
back and watch it happen, be
cause we are dependent on
them," says Ehrlich.
"The other organisms of the
planet are working parts of the
ecological systems which pro
vide us with a whole series of ir
replaceable free services that
we simply have to have to main
tain industrial society. That is
maintaining the quality of the
atmosphere, generating and
maintaining the soil, regulating
fresh water supplies, controll
ing crop pests, etc."
"The basic point is that we

don't know enough about
ecological systems to say what
will happen to our entire system
if you remove single organisms
or a population. But any fool can
tell you what the results will be
if you continue the process on
and on," explains Ehrlich.
This is not Ehrlich's only
argument, however. There is

also "the combination of things
you might call aesthetics and
ethics. Other organisms are in
teresting, pretty and enrich our
lives. Do we have any right to
arbitrarily exterminate other
organisms, particularly ones
that are not harmful to us?"
"As a scientist, I don't find
much basis for moral guidance
in science." But says Ehrlich,
"I believe thgt our stewardship
and our dominance of the earth
brings with it the responsi
bilities to take care of helpless
other organisms, just like we
take care of helpless other peo

pie."
And Ehrlich's third argu
ment, "most easily understood
by an economist or layperson, is
ftiat we get enormous direct ec
onomical benefits from other
organisms. Think of food and
medicine: the potential for ex
tracting such benefits has bare
ly been scratched."
Medicine is especially depen
dent on natural drugs, found in
bacteria, fungi and higher
plants. Just small portions of
existing organisms have been
screened for useful products
thus far. These potential re
sources would be lost forever
with their extinction, warns
Ehrlich.
Looking at the world, how
ever, it seems "that most de
cision-makers in all countries
do not recognize the urgency of
getting on with the world. In
part, this is because the econo
mists who advise them are ut
terly ignorant of the con
straints."
"They believe the economical
system is the main system and
don't understand how it has to
be embedded in the physical,
chemical and biological proper
ties of the planet.
For example, one economist
at the University of Illinois
states that "only the total
weight of the universe is a theo
retical limit to the amount of
copper available in the future,
because copper can be made
from other metals."
Resource policies in this
country are the results of demo
cratic elections, so "why,
every poll shows that most
Americans are in favor of sacri
ficing economic gain for en
vironmental quality if neces
sary, do we have an adminis
tration that is going exactly the
opposite way? I think we just

have to politicize the environ
mental groups," says Ehrlich.
"You've got to get in there
and do the political work like
that to get rid of the Ronald
Reagans, to get rid of the Watts,
to push things in the right direc
tion. And you are not going to
get that done unless there is a
structural change."
"But lobbying is only effec
tive if you have a large public
behind you. So what Ann and I
have been doing for the last 15
years is to run a public educa
tion program. I do research on
the biological and the policy
side, I do Stanford education on
the biological side, and public
education on the policy side."
Ehrlich regards writing
books as part of it, the problem
being that "you don't have the
ability to go through the in
troduction materials and meth
ods-routine (scheme of scien
tific publications) and put all
the qualifying words in."
"I was worried 15 years ago,
when I first really went public,
that it would hurt my scientific
reputation. But it has, if any
thing, enhanced it, at least
within my own discipline."
comments Ehrlich.
"In summary, if you ask me
what is going to happen, I am
very pessimistic. Everything is
going in the wrong direction; we
are already vastly over
populated, and things are get
ting worse both socially and in
terms of the planet."
"On the other hand, in the last
15 years we've gone from a point
where most people didn't know
the word ecology to where
ecology is clearly embedded in
the structure of our society as a
standard issue in politics."
