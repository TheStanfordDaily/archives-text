Ehrlich. a specialist on popu

nuclear explosions, said "A
full-scale nuclear war would de
vastate the whole Northern
Hemisphere and quite likely
mean the end of human life oh

The immediate ecological

Blacker, associate director of
the Stanford Arms Control
Program, said that becoming an
expert on the reasons for arms
control is "the most effective
way" to bring change towards
an active U.S. government
commitment to arms control.
He however, that
progressive-minded arms con
trol supporters should be wary
of alienating "middle America."
"1 do not think that the way to
further arms control is to link it

with all of the most progressive
causes in the U. 5.." he said.
During his speech. Anderson
said. ' We have an administra

embargo, ar. economic weapon,
and has moved instead to the
building of more military
weapons."
Anderson quoted long-time
State Department official and
former U.S. Ambassador to the
Soviet Union George Kennan:
"The U.S. and USSR could
halve their (stockpiles of) nuc
lear weapons and stil! he just as
safe."
