# Res Ed system: 'quality of life' improved
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Residential education at
Stanford — to some it is
just a matter of course.
But to those responsible lor its
day to day functions, residential
education is more than a style of
living It is a means of improv
ing the quality of lite.
"I think a lot of what Res Ed
is is taken for granted." said
Rob Robinson, an associate pro
fessor in German studies and
resident fellow iRFi tor West
Lagunita Court. "Too few stu
dents realize what an effective
system we have "
Improving the quality of life
can be a vague and time con
suming task The boundaries,
according to one RF. are "lim
ited only by the imagination."
Vet. the diversity created by the
desire to improve life is an inte
gral part of what many term
Stanford's "unique" residential
education system Norm Rob
inson. associate dean of student
affairs for residential educa
tion. is proud of the options
available to students.
"Our diversity does set us
apart The range of choice is
much greater than that of other
universities. We prize diversity
so highly that we're expanding
it." said the associate dean
Stanford's Res Ed system is
indeed diverse. It boasts every
type of housing imagineable —
from the co-ed dorms of Stern
and Wilbur, the apartment liv
ing found in Mirrielees and the
renowned all-freshmen dorm of
Branner. to the equally well
known self-op Synergy And
each house is encouraged to de
velop programs best suited to
its occupants.
Programs are a crucial part
of Res Ed at Stanford. Across
the campus any number of cul
tural and educational events are
held daily. Sherry hours, long
popular at Stanford, give stu
dents a chance to meet with pro
fessors in the dorms. Diana Con
klin. director of the row. reports
that row houses are "thriving,
healthy, energetic and busy
houses."
"We have a quarterly check
up on houses when they submit a
list of house activities." Conklin
said. "Some have something
happening every night."
Whether a dorm is holding a

ftlrti or lecture series, working
on a dorm production, or plan
ning an outing. Res Ed views the
process as anjeducational asset.
"Programs are an en
richment. They can serve as a
complement to the classroom."
said Kathleen Namphy, a
Western Culture instructor and
RF at Madera House in Wilbur.
The use of residences as an
extension ol the classroom ver
sus a separate educational sys
tem is a topic of trequent de
bate. Some academic program
ming is already a part of the sys
tem The addition of the
Western Culture requirement
last fall has resulted in an in
crease in residentiallv based
education. Robinson of West
Lagunita views the develop
ment as positive.

are also part of the residence
programs. Katchadourian
the program is gradually expan
ding and will "eventually
blanket all of the freshman
dorms."
"Through academic advising
we hope to strengthen the in
tellectual aspects and bring the
academic side into greater
focus." said Katchadourian.
Vet. most RF's stress that
they are not trying to "supplant
the classroom to the resi
dences.' Kendell Jackson, an
RF at Branner and chairman of
a University subcommittee on
residential education, said that
the University is "not trying to
duplicate the Quad in the resi
dences. but rather make room
for intelligent talk to become
more routine."
Conklin agreed with Jackson
and added that she would like to
see a "shrinking ol the
dichotomy ol learning and hav
ing fun.
"Fun is often defined as non
intellectual activity. I don't un
derstand why it is so unpleasant

to carry over what you're learn
ing in the classroom into the
home." said Conklin
The idea of the residence as
home is another aspect of living
that Res Ed would like to see
emphasized A sense of com
munity and family living is a
goal sought in many of Stan
ford's residences Ken Tanabe,
a second year Residence Assis
tant (R Ai in Cedro and a senior
electrical engineering major,
noted some differences between
Stanford dorms and those at oth
er campuses in saying that stu
dents here are more involved
with each other on a personal
level.
"Dorms should be more than
a simple place to come back and
crash. Friends at other schools
tell me RA's are viewed as po
licemen who keep the kiddies
from burning up the dorm,"
Tanabe said.
The development of the indi
vidual and community growth
are emphasized throughout the
Res Ed system. Understanding
and appreciation of other's dif
ferences is a goal most often
mentioned in discussions
"A large part of what Res Ed
is involves learning to become a
member of a community — get
ting to know and like people of
other backgrounds." said Rob
inson.

Exchanging ideas and ex
pressing opinions are
moves Conklin would like
to see in the residences. She
views the smaller size of the
row houses as helping students
reach a more personal level of
interaction
"Students should make the
most of small living situations
to share with each other who
they really are in less super
ficial relationships," said Con
klin. "They should teel sate
talking to each other openly : un
afraid to reveal their vulner
abilities as humans."
Such a goal requires special
attention — attention residen
tial education is designed to so
licit from resident fellows and
staff as well as trom the stu
dent. Yet the role of staff in the
Res Ed system varies from resi
dence to residence. In the
dorms, staff members work as a
team, serving as both a re
source person and instigator.
According to Norm Robinson
they must be understanding,
available, and realize the im
portant role the residence can
play in "encouraging students
to think about things they
wouldn't normally think about,
and in helping them take respon
sibility for their lives."
In other housing arrange
ments staff members may
serve in more of an advisory ca

parity. Particularly in self-run
houses where students have
elected house officials, RA's
play a behind-the-scenes role.
Students, both in the dorms and
individual houses, are then
charged with establishing their
own guidelines to live by.
The general feeling in the ad
ministration is that the system
runs quite smoothly. As in any
system, however, conflicts do
arise. Robinson, as head of Res
idential Education, and Conklin,
as Director of the Row, like to
let students handle behavior
problems at the house level as
often as possible.
£ £ mhe best solution to
problems comes
•L from the house
level." said Conklin "Their de
cision will be the most in
formed. most efficient, and
most likely to succeed."
Generally there are few
criticisms of the goals outlined
by residential education. One
RF complained, however, about
the lack of "clear policies" on
theme houses and that degree of
responsibility owed the houses
is also undefined. Another RF
countered this criticism. "The
job isn't well described; you
can't just pin it down. We're re
sponsible for the cultural, so
cial. emotional and academic
growth of students — we're re
sponsible for any kind of growth
we can get."

The general feeling in the ad
ministration is that the system
runs quite smoothly. As in any
system, however, conflicts do
arise. Robinson, as head of Res
idential Education, and Conklin,
as Director of the Row, like to
let students handle behavior
problems at the house level as
often as possible.
£ £ mhe best solution to
problems comes
•L from the house
level." said Conklin "Their de
cision will be the most in
formed. most efficient, and
most likely to succeed."
Generally there are few
criticisms of the goals outlined
by residential education. One
RF complained, however, about
the lack of "clear policies" on
theme houses and that degree of
responsibility owed the houses
is also undefined. Another RF
countered this criticism. "The
job isn't well described; you
can't just pin it down. We're re
sponsible for the cultural, so
cial. emotional and academic
growth of students — we're re
sponsible for any kind of growth
we can get."
