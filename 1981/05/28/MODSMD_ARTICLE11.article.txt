# Norm Robinson: a look at the man behind the name
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Norm Robinson Most ev
eryone is more than fa
miliar with the name.
It's one ot the first mentioned
when the Draw or residential
education is discussed. Yet few
people know much about the
man behind the name, and
fewer still realize how impor
tant he is to the Stanford living
"experience." Robinson, as an
associate dean, is directly re
sponsible for all University resi
dences and their programming

A former western
Massachusetts resident. Rob
inson came to Stanford in 967.
as a graduate student in coun
seling psychology. It was that
fall that he joined the Univer
sity's residential education sys
tem as a resident assistant.
F rom there, Robinson went on
to become director of Florence
Moore Hall in 1970. Director of
the Row in 197 . and Associate
Dean of Student Affairs for Res
idential Education, his present
position, in 976.
"I floated into the system, en

joyed it, and decided to stay,"
said the 40-year-old adminis
trator of his years at Stanford.
During his 14 years at the Uni
versity, Robinson says he has
learned much about students
and the difference residential
education can make.
"It has given me a good un
derstanding of the developmen
tal problems and situations stu
dents go through." said Rob
inson. "and the role residences
can play in student education."
The role of residential educa
tion. according to Robinson, has
a great potential to "capitalize
on the diversity" of Stanford
students. Robinson considers
the residential education sys
tem here unique in both the di
versity and amount of housing
situations and in the amount oi
faculty involved in residential
education. By offering such a
wide range of housing choices,
Robinson said he hopes to turn
residential education into a
"creative asset."
Robinson leaned back
from his desk and looked
out the window of his
third floor office in Old Union
and reflected on some goals of
the residential education sys
tem
"We want to stimulate an un
derstanding of, a sensitivity to,
and a tolerance of people of all

kinds, colors, shapes and be
liefs." Robinson said.
Robinson stresses the im
portance of learning to accept
each individual for his or her
own merits rather than catego
rizing and stereotyping him.
The responsibility for achieving
these goals, says Robinson, lies
chiefly with the student. Resi
dent Fellows and staff members
are an integral part of the sys
tem, he said, but Robinson be
lieves students must cooperate
in making the residence "a
place where everything comes
together."
Living in a residence is a
great democratizing factor —
everybody is essentially in the
same boat." explained Rob
inson.
Discipline and problem-solv
ing in the residence system is.
according to Robinson, ideally
approached at a local level. In
almost every instance, Rob
inson said he avoids interfering.
He recalled a problem involving
room assignments in one of the
houses. For some reason, resi
dents experienced difficulty in
making midyear room assign
ments. After much debate, they
decided to ask Robinson to set
tle the matter. Instead Rob
inson urged the house to discuss
assignments again. When the
group came back a second and

third time, still unable to reach
a decision, Robinson explained
his plan for handling the room
assignment: roommates would
be drawn randomly, from a hat.
Upset with Robinson's proposal,
the group asked for one more
chance to work out the problem.
"An hour later they called
back. They'd made the room as
signments," he said.
Robinson, who came to Stan
ford at a time ot unrest concern
ing Vietnam and civil rights
added that he is aware of recent
changes in the student popu
lation's attitudes about them
selves and others.
Tn 1967, there was tre-
I mendous concern in
A the areas of war and
civil rights; there was much dis
cussion and interest in what was
going on in the University and
the world." said Robinson.
"People are now more con
cerned about themselves and
less inclined to take risks.
It is Robinson's hope that res
idential education can, through
its , staff and programs, en
courage students to. "think
about things they wouldn't nor
mally think about and take re
sponsibility for the quality of
their life."
"I certainly don't think it's
too much to ask," Robinson
said.

Norm Robinson Most ev
eryone is more than fa
miliar with the name.
It's one ot the first mentioned
when the Draw or residential
education is discussed. Yet few
people know much about the
man behind the name, and
fewer still realize how impor
tant he is to the Stanford living
"experience." Robinson, as an
associate dean, is directly re
sponsible for all University resi
dences and their programming

A former western
Massachusetts resident. Rob
inson came to Stanford in 967.
as a graduate student in coun
seling psychology. It was that
fall that he joined the Univer
sity's residential education sys
tem as a resident assistant.
F rom there, Robinson went on
to become director of Florence
Moore Hall in 1970. Director of
the Row in 197 . and Associate
Dean of Student Affairs for Res
idential Education, his present
position, in 976.
"I floated into the system, en

joyed it, and decided to stay,"
said the 40-year-old adminis
trator of his years at Stanford.
During his 14 years at the Uni
versity, Robinson says he has
learned much about students
and the difference residential
education can make.
"It has given me a good un
derstanding of the developmen
tal problems and situations stu
dents go through." said Rob
inson. "and the role residences
can play in student education."
The role of residential educa
tion. according to Robinson, has
a great potential to "capitalize
on the diversity" of Stanford
students. Robinson considers
the residential education sys
tem here unique in both the di
versity and amount of housing
situations and in the amount oi
faculty involved in residential
education. By offering such a
wide range of housing choices,
Robinson said he hopes to turn
residential education into a
"creative asset."
Robinson leaned back
from his desk and looked
out the window of his
third floor office in Old Union
and reflected on some goals of
the residential education sys
tem
"We want to stimulate an un
derstanding of, a sensitivity to,
and a tolerance of people of all

kinds, colors, shapes and be
liefs." Robinson said.
Robinson stresses the im
portance of learning to accept
each individual for his or her
own merits rather than catego
rizing and stereotyping him.
The responsibility for achieving
these goals, says Robinson, lies
chiefly with the student. Resi
dent Fellows and staff members
are an integral part of the sys
tem, he said, but Robinson be
lieves students must cooperate
in making the residence "a
place where everything comes
together."
Living in a residence is a
great democratizing factor —
everybody is essentially in the
same boat." explained Rob
inson.
Discipline and problem-solv
ing in the residence system is.
according to Robinson, ideally
approached at a local level. In
almost every instance, Rob
inson said he avoids interfering.
He recalled a problem involving
room assignments in one of the
houses. For some reason, resi
dents experienced difficulty in
making midyear room assign
ments. After much debate, they
decided to ask Robinson to set
tle the matter. Instead Rob
inson urged the house to discuss
assignments again. When the
group came back a second and

third time, still unable to reach
a decision, Robinson explained
his plan for handling the room
assignment: roommates would
be drawn randomly, from a hat.
Upset with Robinson's proposal,
the group asked for one more
chance to work out the problem.
"An hour later they called
back. They'd made the room as
signments," he said.
Robinson, who came to Stan
ford at a time ot unrest concern
ing Vietnam and civil rights
added that he is aware of recent
changes in the student popu
lation's attitudes about them
selves and others.
