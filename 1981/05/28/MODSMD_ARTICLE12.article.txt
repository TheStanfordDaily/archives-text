# ASSU reaches crossroad of program growth
## 
### Richard Klingler 
As an organization affecting
many areas of the University
and as the representative body
of Stanford students, the ASSU
has arrived at a crucial time of
decision. Actions taken within
the next months may shape the
ASSU for several years. Choices
made by incoming officers may
determine whether the ASSU
will draw upon successes of the
past to become an effective, re
spected organization or, instead,
heighten the problems within
the ASSU that threaten to limit
action and to discredit and con
tract the organization.
The potential for increased ef
fectiveness lies in thelirganized,
extended structure of the ASSU,
and in the development of a fo
cused and sophisticated sense of
the organization's purpose.
Outgoing Council of Presidents
(COP) member Marc Ventresca
expressed this possibility of
growth: " We feel that this year's
group has made administrative
changes and continued and
started projects that future
year's groups can build on."
The decline and contraction
of the ASSU is also possible.
The source of the organization's
problems lies in many students'
negative perception of the
ASSU and in morale problems
within the organization itself.
Outgoing Senate Chairman
Doug Mitchell expressed frust
ration at these problems. "We
haven't been a real public se
nate," he said. "Students just
think of us as the senate that
killed concerts, but we've done
much, much more. Concerts and
other actions are something stu
dents will feel good about five
years from now."
The great strength of the
ASSU lies in the breadth of the
areas of the University and stu
dent life it affects. The core of
ASSU operations is the COP,
the senate and the finance and
administrative division. In addi
tion to directly representing stu
dents in different parts of the
University, this core directs ac
tivities that include service pro
jects ranging from legal counsel
ing to the Sunday Flicks, and
coordinates bodies such as the
Publications Board and the
Guest Professorship Board.
The ASSU also contributes to
the development of Tresidder
Union and directs the operation
of the Coffee House. The ASSU
represents students by directing
student members on academic.
University and trustee commit
tees. COP member Dick Butter
field said the ASSU's potential
for effective organization comes
through its "great range of in
formal contacts and formal posi
tions."
Another possible source of
expansion and increased effec

tiveness is the quality of the fi
nance division. According to
outgoing COP member Dayna
Goldfine, Steve Davis (1980-81
financial manager) has done "an
amazing job of regularizing pro
cedure and overseeing pro
jects," and there is broad ag
reement within the ASSU con
cerning the finance office's
capability.
The financial manager and
staff are responsible for report
ing to the COP about manage
ment of finances and services,
and defer to the senate, which
controls "budget authority for
the ASSU," according to ASSU
publications.
However, the finance office is
so successful partially because it
has co-opted many of the other
bodies' powers. Davis and his
staff have virtually directed the
service projects through budget
and advisory control, and
Davis's budget recommenda
tions and financial advice have
usually passed through the se
nate unchallenged and unques
tioned.
One of the developments in
this year's ASSU that may allow
the organization to expand its
role in the University is greater
cooperation between the diffe
rent ASSU divisions. "This is
the first time ever that the
members of the COP, the senate
chair, and the financial manager
all have been on speaking terms
at the end of the year," said out
going COP member Nancy
Takahashi. According to outgo
ing Deputy Senate Chair Sheri
lyn Gilbert, "The senate has
been linked much closer to the
University committee system
through five good committee
staff assistants, and the finance
office has worked closely with
the senate finance committee."
A lack of student support is
the primary factor offsetting
many of these sources of growth
and that poses the greatest
threat to ASSU success. ASSU
officers are often dismissed as
"do-nothing politicos who want
to get into law school." as in
coming COP member Chris
Greene characterized a popular
perception of the ASSU. The

low voter turnout in the most
recent election is the strongest
indication of the lack of student
support for the ASSU: less than
25 percent of the student body
chose to vote in the election,
and all but two senators re
ceived fewer than 600 votes.
Approximately 12,000 students
attend Stanford University.
Although the ASSU claims to
represent "the student body as a
whole." graduate students play
a small role in the ASSU, and
demonstrate little interest in the
organization. According to out
going Graduate Senator Dave
Daleke, one of the graduate
students most active in the
ASSU, "The ASSU is not the
place for graduate student issues
to be aired. Graduate students
can organize in other ways."
This year, the highest polling
graduate senator received 174
votes from the entire student
body, and all but three graduate
senators were elected with fewer
than 150 votes.
Butterfield attempted to exp
lain the lack of student support.
"One reason students are so
down on the ASSU is that when
they think of the ASSU. they
don't think of t-shirts. they don't
think of the Sunday Flicks, and
they don't think of money going
to publications through the Pub
Board." Ventresca was even
more candid. "People like to
complain and the ASSU is an
easy target."
All members of the outgoing
COP said students' low estima
tion of the ASSU resulted from
poor presentation of the organi
zation and a lack of publicity,
rather than inherent problems
within the organization. Butter
tield. Ventresca and Goldfine
each blamed The Stanford Daily
tor many of the negative student
impressions of the ASSU he
cause of what they feel is selec
tive coverage. "They often high
light our failures," Ventresca
said. Butterfield cited lack of
cooperation as contributing to
the problem. "The Daily doesn't
work with us to present what we
do," he said.
The formulation of a clear
sense of the ASSU's purpose is

one development this year that
may alter students' impressions
of the organization and led to
more effective action. The
ASSU has always provided stu
dents with services, representa
tion in the community, and the
opportunity for participation in
student government, but the
focus of the senate and the COP
has often been unclear. The
COP and. to a lesser degree, the
senate have three principal
roles, according to Ventresca:
administering the entire organi
zation, serving as a clearing
house for information to serve
as a network for different
groups with similar interests,
and advocating student interests
within the University.
Mitchell has emphasized that
the senate, in addition to these
duties, "has to respond to what
ever is important at the mo
ment." Because senators and
COP members do maintain con
tact with so many parts of the
University — students, faculty
members and administrators —
their roles are particularly well
suited to advocating student in
terests, to bringing sympathetic
groups together, and coordinat
ing efforts to resolve problems.
The emphasis on process also
augers well for the ASSU be
cause its definition of purpose
brings consistency over succes
sive years of management. The
ASSU, particularly the senate,
has often fluctuated between
concentrating on national and
international issues and addres
sing immediate Stanford con
cerns. By concentrating upon
and passing on a single, clear
conception of the role of the
COP and senate, the ASSU can,
in Butterfield's words, "become
more effective ' as students
realize how we view its role."
'This concentration upon pro
cess and administration often
shows only indirect results and
does not lend itself to flashy in
itiatives, however. Ventresca
said ASSU leaders "can't de
mand — we can only facilitate.
Because of this, we (outgoing
ASSU officers) probably won't
see any tangible results for most
of our efforts." The concert

issue provides an example of the
irony often accompanying the
conception of the ASSU as a
coordinating body. ASSU offi
cials claim that the concert issue
shows that the system works:
the finance office made a re
commendation: the senate ap
pointed bodies to make sugges
tions; and the issue was debated
and acted upon. Yet student
reaction to the senate's action
from editorial cartoons to per
sonal comments, was far from
positive. A clear sense of pur
pose may not be enough to
overcome an additional prob
lem, plaguing the ASSU. Mem
bers of the ASSU government
themselves often have a poor
image of the organization and
often have problems motivating
themselves to further the ASSU.
Senators' attendance at their
own meetings has been abys
mally poor this year: the
quorum of I 1 out of 40 poten
tial senators was often just
barely achieved and was occa
sionally not met. Attendance at
the different committees, al
though higher than in past years,
has often been very low as well.
Even some senators who
worked very hard during the
first two quarters of the year at
tended later meetings only
sporadically. One newly-elected
senator said. "I've had several
senators come and practically
cry on my shoulder, telling me
how frustrated they were with
what they haven't achieved."
Although there are signs of
increased cohesion within the
ASSU. deep divisions have re
sulted from the frustration of
having little to show for much
effort. Butterfield has urged the
senate to act. His statement
made during one senate meet
ing, thai "This might be anl
achievement of the senate. not\
that 1 can think of one so far."
resulted in protests from several
senators, and one senator
walked out of the meeting. COP
members have clashed publicly
and personally over the concert
issue as well.
It is the strengths of a broad
and organized structure and a
clear sense of purpose as well as
the weaknesses of little student
support and internal motiva
tional problems that have
brought the ASSU to this criti
cal point. The possibilities for
development prompt ASSU of
ficers to speak of a time when
the organization will direct ex
pansion and student control of
Tresidder. expand services,
coordinate interests and ac
tivities of groups throughout the
University, and. Ventresca says,
"be thought of as the place
where students will bring their
problems and concerns."
Yet the ASSU is also faced
with the possible reversal of

much of its growth and de
velopment of past years. De
feated fee assessments threaten
to weaken ASSU services and
shear ASSU links between dif
ferent publications and
academic organizations. An oc
casionally unwieldy committee
system and problems with by
laws limit effective action, espe
cially senate action. Most impor
tantly, weak student support
threatens to erode any legiti
macy that makes action possible
and threatens to limit expansion
and services.
A relatively smooth transition
this year has increased the pos
sibility for retaining many of the
strengths of this year's ASSU.
Provisions for the transition

range from a few orientation
meetings for new senators to
lengthy discussions and joint ac
tions between the outgoing and
incoming COPs and the finance
division's very thorough transi
tion.
The new senate has made ten
tative efforts to address some of
the problems it faces by plan
ning a fall fee assessment elec
tion and by establishing commit
tees to suggest ways to better
publicity and to improve the fee
assessment procedure. How
ever, the ASSU has yet to define
what issues it will concentrate
upon next year or to show that
its efforts will not be beset by
perennial motivational prob
lems.
As an organization affecting
many areas of the University
and as the representative body
of Stanford students, the ASSU

The emphasis on process also
augers well for the ASSU be
cause its definition of purpose
brings consistency over succes
sive years of management. The
ASSU, particularly the senate,
has often fluctuated between
concentrating on national and
international issues and addres
sing immediate Stanford con
cerns. By concentrating upon
and passing on a single, clear
conception of the role of the
COP and senate, the ASSU can,
in Butterfield's words, "become
more effective ' as students
realize how we view its role."
'This concentration upon pro
cess and administration often
shows only indirect results and
does not lend itself to flashy in
itiatives, however. Ventresca
said ASSU leaders "can't de
mand — we can only facilitate.
Because of this, we (outgoing
ASSU officers) probably won't
see any tangible results for most
of our efforts." The concert

issue provides an example of the
irony often accompanying the
conception of the ASSU as a
coordinating body. ASSU offi
cials claim that the concert issue
shows that the system works:
the finance office made a re
commendation: the senate ap
pointed bodies to make sugges
tions; and the issue was debated
and acted upon. Yet student
reaction to the senate's action
from editorial cartoons to per
sonal comments, was far from
positive. A clear sense of pur
pose may not be enough to
overcome an additional prob
lem, plaguing the ASSU. Mem
bers of the ASSU government
themselves often have a poor
image of the organization and
often have problems motivating
themselves to further the ASSU.
Senators' attendance at their
own meetings has been abys
mally poor this year: the
quorum of I 1 out of 40 poten
tial senators was often just
barely achieved and was occa
sionally not met. Attendance at
the different committees, al
though higher than in past years,
has often been very low as well.
Even some senators who
worked very hard during the
first two quarters of the year at
tended later meetings only
sporadically. One newly-elected
senator said. "I've had several
senators come and practically
cry on my shoulder, telling me
how frustrated they were with
what they haven't achieved."
Although there are signs of
increased cohesion within the
ASSU. deep divisions have re
sulted from the frustration of
having little to show for much
effort. Butterfield has urged the
senate to act. His statement
made during one senate meet
ing, thai "This might be anl
achievement of the senate. not\
that 1 can think of one so far."
resulted in protests from several
senators, and one senator
walked out of the meeting. COP
members have clashed publicly
and personally over the concert
issue as well.
It is the strengths of a broad
and organized structure and a
clear sense of purpose as well as
the weaknesses of little student
support and internal motiva
tional problems that have
brought the ASSU to this criti
cal point. The possibilities for
development prompt ASSU of
ficers to speak of a time when
the organization will direct ex
pansion and student control of
Tresidder. expand services,
coordinate interests and ac
tivities of groups throughout the
University, and. Ventresca says,
"be thought of as the place
where students will bring their
problems and concerns."
Yet the ASSU is also faced
with the possible reversal of

much of its growth and de
velopment of past years. De
feated fee assessments threaten
to weaken ASSU services and
shear ASSU links between dif
ferent publications and
academic organizations. An oc
casionally unwieldy committee
system and problems with by
laws limit effective action, espe
cially senate action. Most impor
tantly, weak student support
threatens to erode any legiti
macy that makes action possible
and threatens to limit expansion
and services.
A relatively smooth transition
this year has increased the pos
sibility for retaining many of the
strengths of this year's ASSU.
Provisions for the transition

range from a few orientation
meetings for new senators to
lengthy discussions and joint ac
tions between the outgoing and
incoming COPs and the finance
division's very thorough transi
tion.
The new senate has made ten
tative efforts to address some of
the problems it faces by plan
ning a fall fee assessment elec
tion and by establishing commit
tees to suggest ways to better
publicity and to improve the fee
assessment procedure. How
ever, the ASSU has yet to define
what issues it will concentrate
upon next year or to show that
its efforts will not be beset by
perennial motivational prob
lems.
As an organization affecting
many areas of the University
and as the representative body
of Stanford students, the ASSU
has arrived at a crucial time of
decision. Actions taken within
the next months may shape the
ASSU for several years. Choices
made by incoming officers may
determine whether the ASSU
will draw upon successes of the
past to become an effective, re
spected organization or, instead,
heighten the problems within
the ASSU that threaten to limit
action and to discredit and con
tract the organization.
The potential for increased ef
fectiveness lies in thelirganized,
extended structure of the ASSU,
and in the development of a fo
cused and sophisticated sense of
the organization's purpose.
Outgoing Council of Presidents
(COP) member Marc Ventresca
expressed this possibility of
growth: " We feel that this year's
group has made administrative
changes and continued and
started projects that future
year's groups can build on."
The decline and contraction
of the ASSU is also possible.
The source of the organization's
problems lies in many students'
negative perception of the
ASSU and in morale problems
within the organization itself.
Outgoing Senate Chairman
Doug Mitchell expressed frust
ration at these problems. "We
haven't been a real public se
nate," he said. "Students just
think of us as the senate that
killed concerts, but we've done
much, much more. Concerts and
other actions are something stu
dents will feel good about five
years from now."
The great strength of the
ASSU lies in the breadth of the
areas of the University and stu
dent life it affects. The core of
ASSU operations is the COP,
the senate and the finance and
administrative division. In addi
tion to directly representing stu
dents in different parts of the
University, this core directs ac
tivities that include service pro
jects ranging from legal counsel
ing to the Sunday Flicks, and
coordinates bodies such as the
Publications Board and the
Guest Professorship Board.
The ASSU also contributes to
the development of Tresidder
Union and directs the operation
of the Coffee House. The ASSU
represents students by directing
student members on academic.
University and trustee commit
tees. COP member Dick Butter
field said the ASSU's potential
for effective organization comes
through its "great range of in
formal contacts and formal posi
tions."
Another possible source of
expansion and increased effec

tiveness is the quality of the fi
nance division. According to
outgoing COP member Dayna
Goldfine, Steve Davis (1980-81
financial manager) has done "an
amazing job of regularizing pro
cedure and overseeing pro
jects," and there is broad ag
reement within the ASSU con
cerning the finance office's
capability.
The financial manager and
staff are responsible for report
ing to the COP about manage
ment of finances and services,
and defer to the senate, which
controls "budget authority for
the ASSU," according to ASSU
publications.
However, the finance office is
so successful partially because it
has co-opted many of the other
bodies' powers. Davis and his
staff have virtually directed the
service projects through budget
and advisory control, and
Davis's budget recommenda
tions and financial advice have
usually passed through the se
nate unchallenged and unques
tioned.
One of the developments in
this year's ASSU that may allow
the organization to expand its
role in the University is greater
cooperation between the diffe
rent ASSU divisions. "This is
the first time ever that the
members of the COP, the senate
chair, and the financial manager
all have been on speaking terms
at the end of the year," said out
going COP member Nancy
Takahashi. According to outgo
ing Deputy Senate Chair Sheri
lyn Gilbert, "The senate has
been linked much closer to the
University committee system
through five good committee
staff assistants, and the finance
office has worked closely with
the senate finance committee."
A lack of student support is
the primary factor offsetting
many of these sources of growth
and that poses the greatest
threat to ASSU success. ASSU
officers are often dismissed as
"do-nothing politicos who want
to get into law school." as in
coming COP member Chris
Greene characterized a popular
perception of the ASSU. The

low voter turnout in the most
recent election is the strongest
indication of the lack of student
support for the ASSU: less than
25 percent of the student body
chose to vote in the election,
and all but two senators re
ceived fewer than 600 votes.
Approximately 12,000 students
attend Stanford University.
Although the ASSU claims to
represent "the student body as a
whole." graduate students play
a small role in the ASSU, and
demonstrate little interest in the
organization. According to out
going Graduate Senator Dave
Daleke, one of the graduate
students most active in the
ASSU, "The ASSU is not the
place for graduate student issues
to be aired. Graduate students
can organize in other ways."
This year, the highest polling
graduate senator received 174
votes from the entire student
body, and all but three graduate
senators were elected with fewer
than 150 votes.
Butterfield attempted to exp
lain the lack of student support.
"One reason students are so
down on the ASSU is that when
they think of the ASSU. they
don't think of t-shirts. they don't
think of the Sunday Flicks, and
they don't think of money going
to publications through the Pub
Board." Ventresca was even
more candid. "People like to
complain and the ASSU is an
easy target."
All members of the outgoing
COP said students' low estima
tion of the ASSU resulted from
poor presentation of the organi
zation and a lack of publicity,
rather than inherent problems
within the organization. Butter
tield. Ventresca and Goldfine
each blamed The Stanford Daily
tor many of the negative student
impressions of the ASSU he
cause of what they feel is selec
tive coverage. "They often high
light our failures," Ventresca
said. Butterfield cited lack of
cooperation as contributing to
the problem. "The Daily doesn't
work with us to present what we
do," he said.
The formulation of a clear
sense of the ASSU's purpose is

one development this year that
may alter students' impressions
of the organization and led to
more effective action. The
ASSU has always provided stu
dents with services, representa
tion in the community, and the
opportunity for participation in
student government, but the
focus of the senate and the COP
has often been unclear. The
COP and. to a lesser degree, the
senate have three principal
roles, according to Ventresca:
administering the entire organi
zation, serving as a clearing
house for information to serve
as a network for different
groups with similar interests,
and advocating student interests
within the University.
Mitchell has emphasized that
the senate, in addition to these
duties, "has to respond to what
ever is important at the mo
ment." Because senators and
COP members do maintain con
tact with so many parts of the
University — students, faculty
members and administrators —
their roles are particularly well
suited to advocating student in
terests, to bringing sympathetic
groups together, and coordinat
ing efforts to resolve problems.
The emphasis on process also
augers well for the ASSU be
cause its definition of purpose
brings consistency over succes
sive years of management. The
ASSU, particularly the senate,
has often fluctuated between
concentrating on national and
international issues and addres
sing immediate Stanford con
cerns. By concentrating upon

staff are responsible for report
ing to the COP about manage
ment of finances and services,
and defer to the senate, which
controls "budget authority for
the ASSU," according to ASSU
publications.
However, the finance office is
so successful partially because it
has co-opted many of the other
bodies' powers. Davis and his
staff have virtually directed the
service projects through budget
and advisory control, and
Davis's budget recommenda
tions and financial advice have
usually passed through the se
nate unchallenged and unques
tioned.
One of the developments in
this year's ASSU that may allow
the organization to expand its
role in the University is greater
cooperation between the diffe
rent ASSU divisions. "This is
the first time ever that the
members of the COP, the senate
chair, and the financial manager
all have been on speaking terms
at the end of the year," said out
going COP member Nancy
Takahashi. According to outgo
ing Deputy Senate Chair Sheri
lyn Gilbert, "The senate has
been linked much closer to the
University committee system
through five good committee
staff assistants, and the finance
office has worked closely with
the senate finance committee."
A lack of student support is
the primary factor offsetting
many of these sources of growth
and that poses the greatest
threat to ASSU success. ASSU
officers are often dismissed as
"do-nothing politicos who want
to get into law school." as in
coming COP member Chris
Greene characterized a popular
perception of the ASSU. The

low voter turnout in the most
recent election is the strongest
indication of the lack of student
support for the ASSU: less than
25 percent of the student body
chose to vote in the election,
and all but two senators re
ceived fewer than 600 votes.
Approximately 12,000 students
attend Stanford University.
Although the ASSU claims to
represent "the student body as a
whole." graduate students play
a small role in the ASSU, and
demonstrate little interest in the
organization. According to out
going Graduate Senator Dave
Daleke, one of the graduate
students most active in the
ASSU, "The ASSU is not the
place for graduate student issues
to be aired. Graduate students
can organize in other ways."
This year, the highest polling
graduate senator received 174
votes from the entire student
body, and all but three graduate
senators were elected with fewer
than 150 votes.
Butterfield attempted to exp
lain the lack of student support.
"One reason students are so
down on the ASSU is that when
they think of the ASSU. they
don't think of t-shirts. they don't
think of the Sunday Flicks, and
they don't think of money going
to publications through the Pub
Board." Ventresca was even
more candid. "People like to
complain and the ASSU is an
easy target."
All members of the outgoing
COP said students' low estima
tion of the ASSU resulted from
poor presentation of the organi
zation and a lack of publicity,
rather than inherent problems
within the organization. Butter
tield. Ventresca and Goldfine
each blamed The Stanford Daily
tor many of the negative student
impressions of the ASSU he
cause of what they feel is selec
tive coverage. "They often high
light our failures," Ventresca
said. Butterfield cited lack of
cooperation as contributing to
the problem. "The Daily doesn't
work with us to present what we
do," he said.
The formulation of a clear
sense of the ASSU's purpose is

one development this year that
may alter students' impressions
of the organization and led to
more effective action. The
ASSU has always provided stu
dents with services, representa
tion in the community, and the
opportunity for participation in
student government, but the
focus of the senate and the COP
has often been unclear. The
COP and. to a lesser degree, the
senate have three principal
roles, according to Ventresca:
administering the entire organi
zation, serving as a clearing
house for information to serve
as a network for different
groups with similar interests,
and advocating student interests
within the University.
Mitchell has emphasized that
the senate, in addition to these
duties, "has to respond to what
ever is important at the mo
ment." Because senators and
COP members do maintain con
tact with so many parts of the
University — students, faculty
members and administrators —
their roles are particularly well
suited to advocating student in
terests, to bringing sympathetic
groups together, and coordinat
ing efforts to resolve problems.
The emphasis on process also
augers well for the ASSU be
cause its definition of purpose
brings consistency over succes
sive years of management. The
ASSU, particularly the senate,
has often fluctuated between
concentrating on national and
international issues and addres
sing immediate Stanford con
cerns. By concentrating upon
and passing on a single, clear
conception of the role of the
COP and senate, the ASSU can,
in Butterfield's words, "become
more effective ' as students
realize how we view its role."
'This concentration upon pro
cess and administration often
shows only indirect results and
does not lend itself to flashy in
itiatives, however. Ventresca
said ASSU leaders "can't de
mand — we can only facilitate.
Because of this, we (outgoing
ASSU officers) probably won't
see any tangible results for most
of our efforts." The concert

issue provides an example of the
irony often accompanying the
conception of the ASSU as a
coordinating body. ASSU offi
cials claim that the concert issue
shows that the system works:
the finance office made a re
commendation: the senate ap
pointed bodies to make sugges
tions; and the issue was debated
and acted upon. Yet student
reaction to the senate's action
from editorial cartoons to per
sonal comments, was far from
positive. A clear sense of pur
pose may not be enough to
overcome an additional prob
lem, plaguing the ASSU. Mem
bers of the ASSU government
themselves often have a poor
image of the organization and
often have problems motivating
themselves to further the ASSU.
Senators' attendance at their
own meetings has been abys
mally poor this year: the
quorum of I 1 out of 40 poten
tial senators was often just
barely achieved and was occa
sionally not met. Attendance at
the different committees, al
though higher than in past years,
has often been very low as well.
Even some senators who
worked very hard during the
first two quarters of the year at
tended later meetings only
sporadically. One newly-elected
senator said. "I've had several
senators come and practically
cry on my shoulder, telling me
how frustrated they were with
what they haven't achieved."
Although there are signs of
increased cohesion within the
ASSU. deep divisions have re
sulted from the frustration of
having little to show for much
effort. Butterfield has urged the
senate to act. His statement
made during one senate meet
ing, thai "This might be anl
achievement of the senate. not\
that 1 can think of one so far."
resulted in protests from several
senators, and one senator
walked out of the meeting. COP
members have clashed publicly
and personally over the concert
issue as well.
It is the strengths of a broad
and organized structure and a
clear sense of purpose as well as
the weaknesses of little student
support and internal motiva
tional problems that have
brought the ASSU to this criti
cal point. The possibilities for
development prompt ASSU of
ficers to speak of a time when
the organization will direct ex
pansion and student control of
Tresidder. expand services,
coordinate interests and ac
tivities of groups throughout the
University, and. Ventresca says,
"be thought of as the place
where students will bring their
problems and concerns."
Yet the ASSU is also faced
with the possible reversal of

much of its growth and de
velopment of past years. De
feated fee assessments threaten
to weaken ASSU services and
shear ASSU links between dif
ferent publications and
academic organizations. An oc
casionally unwieldy committee
system and problems with by
laws limit effective action, espe
cially senate action. Most impor
tantly, weak student support
threatens to erode any legiti
macy that makes action possible
and threatens to limit expansion
and services.
A relatively smooth transition
this year has increased the pos
sibility for retaining many of the
strengths of this year's ASSU.
Provisions for the transition

range from a few orientation
meetings for new senators to
lengthy discussions and joint ac
tions between the outgoing and
incoming COPs and the finance
division's very thorough transi
tion.
The new senate has made ten
tative efforts to address some of
the problems it faces by plan
ning a fall fee assessment elec
tion and by establishing commit
tees to suggest ways to better
publicity and to improve the fee
assessment procedure. How
ever, the ASSU has yet to define
what issues it will concentrate
upon next year or to show that
its efforts will not be beset by
perennial motivational prob
lems.
As an organization affecting
many areas of the University
and as the representative body
of Stanford students, the ASSU
has arrived at a crucial time of
decision. Actions taken within
the next months may shape the
ASSU for several years. Choices
made by incoming officers may
determine whether the ASSU
will draw upon successes of the
past to become an effective, re
spected organization or, instead,
heighten the problems within
the ASSU that threaten to limit
action and to discredit and con
tract the organization.
The potential for increased ef
fectiveness lies in thelirganized,
extended structure of the ASSU,
and in the development of a fo
cused and sophisticated sense of
the organization's purpose.
Outgoing Council of Presidents
(COP) member Marc Ventresca
expressed this possibility of
growth: " We feel that this year's
group has made administrative
changes and continued and
started projects that future
year's groups can build on."
The decline and contraction
of the ASSU is also possible.
The source of the organization's
problems lies in many students'
negative perception of the
ASSU and in morale problems
within the organization itself.
Outgoing Senate Chairman
Doug Mitchell expressed frust
ration at these problems. "We
haven't been a real public se
nate," he said. "Students just
think of us as the senate that
killed concerts, but we've done
much, much more. Concerts and
other actions are something stu
dents will feel good about five
years from now."
The great strength of the
ASSU lies in the breadth of the
areas of the University and stu
dent life it affects. The core of
ASSU operations is the COP,
the senate and the finance and
administrative division. In addi
tion to directly representing stu
dents in different parts of the
University, this core directs ac
tivities that include service pro
jects ranging from legal counsel
ing to the Sunday Flicks, and
coordinates bodies such as the
Publications Board and the
Guest Professorship Board.
The ASSU also contributes to
the development of Tresidder
Union and directs the operation
of the Coffee House. The ASSU
represents students by directing
student members on academic.
University and trustee commit
tees. COP member Dick Butter
field said the ASSU's potential
for effective organization comes
through its "great range of in
formal contacts and formal posi
tions."
Another possible source of
expansion and increased effec

tiveness is the quality of the fi
nance division. According to
outgoing COP member Dayna
Goldfine, Steve Davis (1980-81
financial manager) has done "an
amazing job of regularizing pro
cedure and overseeing pro
jects," and there is broad ag
reement within the ASSU con
cerning the finance office's
capability.
The financial manager and
staff are responsible for report
ing to the COP about manage
ment of finances and services,
and defer to the senate, which
controls "budget authority for
the ASSU," according to ASSU
publications.
However, the finance office is
so successful partially because it
has co-opted many of the other
bodies' powers. Davis and his
staff have virtually directed the
service projects through budget
and advisory control, and
Davis's budget recommenda

usually passed through the se

the weaknesses of little student
support and internal motiva
tional problems that have
brought the ASSU to this criti
cal point. The possibilities for
development prompt ASSU of
ficers to speak of a time when
the organization will direct ex
pansion and student control of
Tresidder. expand services,
coordinate interests and ac
tivities of groups throughout the
University, and. Ventresca says,
"be thought of as the place
where students will bring their
problems and concerns."
Yet the ASSU is also faced
with the possible reversal of

much of its growth and de
velopment of past years. De
feated fee assessments threaten
to weaken ASSU services and
shear ASSU links between dif
ferent publications and
academic organizations. An oc
casionally unwieldy committee
system and problems with by
laws limit effective action, espe
cially senate action. Most impor
tantly, weak student support
threatens to erode any legiti
macy that makes action possible
and threatens to limit expansion
and services.
A relatively smooth transition
this year has increased the pos
sibility for retaining many of the
strengths of this year's ASSU.
Provisions for the transition

range from a few orientation
meetings for new senators to
lengthy discussions and joint ac
tions between the outgoing and
incoming COPs and the finance
division's very thorough transi
tion.
The new senate has made ten
tative efforts to address some of
the problems it faces by plan
ning a fall fee assessment elec
tion and by establishing commit
tees to suggest ways to better
publicity and to improve the fee
assessment procedure. How
ever, the ASSU has yet to define
what issues it will concentrate
upon next year or to show that
its efforts will not be beset by
perennial motivational prob
lems.
