# Faculty Senate to weigh quarter system alternatives
## 
### Christine Myers 
Concern over flaws in the
quarter system, the rela
tive value of courses and
the number of units required for
graduation has resulted in plans
for a lengthy investigation of the
academic calendar.
When the Faculty Senate
meets today it will create an ad
hoc committee to investigate al
ternatives to the present quar
ter system at Stanford. The
committee, charged with study
ing '" the question of the length of
terms of academic instruc
tion." is expected to report back
to the Senate during the 1981-82
academic vear.

The current debate is not as
simple as whether to switch to
the semester system. What one
faculty member called the "ov
ercrowded lives" of students
lies at the heart ot the decision
to look into the substance and
structure of courses at Stan
ford.
Academic Secretary Eric
Hutchinson said that
some of the committee's
responsibilities will be to define
a unit of credit, establish the
number of courses in which a
students will be allowed to en
roll. and to investigate the rela
tive merits of quarter versus se
mester calendars.
Proposals the committee
may consider include increas
ing the number of units granted
for classes that require re
search papers, extending the
length ot some courses from one
to two quarters or adopting a
split-semester plan.
In order to accommodate a
change to the semesteij system,
professors would have to re
evaluate the courses they teach
now. Faculty members seem to
agree that the process of rewrit-

ing lectures and rethinking
course structure, although
time-consuming, would be bene
ficial to both students and pro
fessors.
Although different seg
ments of the University
have heard proposals to
change the system eight times
in fifty years, the committee's
investigation may be more com
prehensive. Registrar Sally
Mahoney said previous studies
have emphasized financial rath
er than academic motives to
change the calendar. The cost of
a change in the system would be
primarily administrative.
On the surface, the debate
centers on teaching ap
proaches of different de
partments. Professors whose
courses require research papers
or extensive writing assign
ments complain the quarter sys
tem does not allow sufficient
time to produce high quality
work But those whose classes
are based on a complex series of
prerequisites say their students
are exposed to a wider range of
subjects that enhance flexibility
and ability to absorb constantly
changing material.
Many humanities and social
science professors believe the
semester system is the key to a
more complete university
education. They stress that time
for more thorough research and
reflection on course content
would create a less pressured
atmosphere and reduce the
number of incomplete grades
taken. The professors who sup
port the semester system fore
see better writing skills and
critical thinking among Stan
ford students as a result of the
change.
Proponents of the semester
system say its implemen
tation would not substan
tially increase the subject load
or the number of hours taught,
but it would allow more time for
reflection on a course.
English Professor Ronald
Rebholz, who brought the se
mester change motion before
the senate, called the notion of
two-quarter course sequences
"ludicrous," saying students
only needed a few extra weeks.
Rebholz said, "The process of
thinking means an ever-deep
ening understanding that de
mands articulation of insights in
writing."
Rebholz said that graduate
students in the humanities and
social science fields feel
cheated by quarters, which do
not allow sufficient time to do
substantative research. Engi
neering, mathematics and sci
ence professors who favor the

quarter system say their stu
dents need to be exposed to as
many subjects and ideas as pos
sible in order to keep up with the
vast volume of information they
must contend with. They say
that to switch to the semester
system would require not only
rethinking their course struc
ture. but a substantial loss of
material as well.
Engineering Associate
Dean .James Adams ex
plained the engineering
department is set up on a
"block" system that depends on
multiple prerequisite subjects.
He said engineering students
get depth from stringing
courses together in an individ-

ualized program. Because the
department is so crowded and
courses so tightly structured,
Adams said, a switch to the se
mester calender would be a
monumental task.
Charles Holloway, an aca
demic dean at the Graduate
School of Business, called the
quarter system "hard to beat"
for students there. Holloway
said the nature of the school de
mands that students become ac
quainted with a diverse range of
subjects.
Students who have ex
perienced both calendars agree
with the assessment that most
undergraduate students prefer
quarters. Several said the varie
ty of cltasses makes up for a
more leisurely approach.
• I figure I can go to grad
school for in-depth training,"
said Senior Kathryn Poling.
Conrad Bock, a graduate stu
dent who transferred from MIT,
said he found quarters here dif
ficult, but enjoyed the op
portunity to take more classes.
Bock believes the present sys
tem's biggest drawback is the
lack ot time "to allow the
maturation ot ideas." He noted
that a true Dead Week might
ease some of the pressure stu
dents feel under the quarter sys
tem.
William Huseby. a senior
mechanical engineer
ing student, said the
pace ot the department helps
students make earlier decisions
on their majors. But, he said,
the system can exclude explora
tion of areas beyond distribution
requirements. "It's easy to
miss out if you don't force your
self." said Huseby.
One student who has majored
in humanities and mathematics
in both systems. Linda Gass.
said she thought a change in the
calendar is not enough to reduce
the number of incompletes or
help the quality of written work
here, "unless professors felt
they could set deadlines."
Gass suggested more units
tor difficult courses in order to
decrease student loads without
losing the advantages of quar
ters.

simple as whether to switch to
the semester system. What one
faculty member called the "ov
ercrowded lives" of students
lies at the heart ot the decision
to look into the substance and
structure of courses at Stan
ford.
Academic Secretary Eric
Hutchinson said that
some of the committee's
responsibilities will be to define
a unit of credit, establish the
number of courses in which a
students will be allowed to en
roll. and to investigate the rela
tive merits of quarter versus se
mester calendars.
Proposals the committee
may consider include increas
ing the number of units granted
for classes that require re
search papers, extending the
length ot some courses from one
to two quarters or adopting a
split-semester plan.
In order to accommodate a
change to the semesteij system,
professors would have to re
evaluate the courses they teach
now. Faculty members seem to
agree that the process of rewrit-

ing lectures and rethinking
course structure, although
time-consuming, would be bene
ficial to both students and pro
fessors.
Although different seg
ments of the University
have heard proposals to
change the system eight times
in fifty years, the committee's
investigation may be more com
prehensive. Registrar Sally
Mahoney said previous studies
have emphasized financial rath
er than academic motives to
change the calendar. The cost of
a change in the system would be
primarily administrative.
On the surface, the debate
centers on teaching ap
proaches of different de
partments. Professors whose
courses require research papers
or extensive writing assign
ments complain the quarter sys
tem does not allow sufficient
time to produce high quality
work But those whose classes
are based on a complex series of
prerequisites say their students
are exposed to a wider range of
subjects that enhance flexibility
and ability to absorb constantly
changing material.
Many humanities and social
science professors believe the
semester system is the key to a
more complete university
education. They stress that time
for more thorough research and
reflection on course content
would create a less pressured
atmosphere and reduce the
number of incomplete grades
taken. The professors who sup
port the semester system fore
see better writing skills and
critical thinking among Stan
ford students as a result of the
change.
Proponents of the semester
system say its implemen
tation would not substan
tially increase the subject load
or the number of hours taught,
but it would allow more time for
reflection on a course.
English Professor Ronald
Rebholz, who brought the se
mester change motion before
the senate, called the notion of
two-quarter course sequences
"ludicrous," saying students
only needed a few extra weeks.
Rebholz said, "The process of
thinking means an ever-deep
ening understanding that de
mands articulation of insights in
writing."
Rebholz said that graduate
students in the humanities and
social science fields feel
cheated by quarters, which do
not allow sufficient time to do
substantative research. Engi
neering, mathematics and sci
ence professors who favor the

quarter system say their stu
dents need to be exposed to as
many subjects and ideas as pos
sible in order to keep up with the
vast volume of information they
must contend with. They say
that to switch to the semester
system would require not only
rethinking their course struc
ture. but a substantial loss of
material as well.
Engineering Associate
Dean .James Adams ex
plained the engineering
department is set up on a
"block" system that depends on
multiple prerequisite subjects.
He said engineering students
get depth from stringing
courses together in an individ-

ualized program. Because the
department is so crowded and
courses so tightly structured,
Adams said, a switch to the se
mester calender would be a
monumental task.
Charles Holloway, an aca
demic dean at the Graduate
School of Business, called the
quarter system "hard to beat"
for students there. Holloway
said the nature of the school de
mands that students become ac
quainted with a diverse range of
subjects.
Students who have ex
perienced both calendars agree
with the assessment that most
undergraduate students prefer
quarters. Several said the varie
ty of cltasses makes up for a
more leisurely approach.
• I figure I can go to grad
school for in-depth training,"
said Senior Kathryn Poling.
Conrad Bock, a graduate stu
dent who transferred from MIT,
said he found quarters here dif
ficult, but enjoyed the op
portunity to take more classes.
Bock believes the present sys
tem's biggest drawback is the
lack ot time "to allow the
maturation ot ideas." He noted
that a true Dead Week might
ease some of the pressure stu
dents feel under the quarter sys
tem.
William Huseby. a senior
mechanical engineer
ing student, said the
pace ot the department helps
students make earlier decisions
on their majors. But, he said,
the system can exclude explora
tion of areas beyond distribution
requirements. "It's easy to
miss out if you don't force your
self." said Huseby.
One student who has majored
in humanities and mathematics
in both systems. Linda Gass.
said she thought a change in the
calendar is not enough to reduce
the number of incompletes or
help the quality of written work
here, "unless professors felt
they could set deadlines."
Gass suggested more units
tor difficult courses in order to
decrease student loads without
losing the advantages of quar
ters.

Concern over flaws in the
