# 'Premiere '81': a smorgasbord of rentable one-acts
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Like the Lego books which
show you how to build anything
using their small brightly
colored bricks, the One-Act
Theatre Company shows how
versatile the short play can be.
In addition to a main series, they
have a second stage (for de
veloping new plays and
playrights), lunchtime theatre
(no crunchy veggies, please),
and even Rent-a-Plays (for
those parties where a stripper in

a cake might be considered de
goute).
At the main stage, they are
currently presenting "Premieres
'81," three brand-new one-acts.
"Suicide Franchise" by local au
thor John Angell Grant was
originally presented last fall on
the second stage, but has since
undergone considerable rework
ing. The other two plays are "A
Letter from Leo Gorcey" by
playwright-in-residence Michael
Lynch, and "Billy Angel" by

Bostonian John Crabtree.
"Suicide Franchise" is an ec
centric comedy about a com
mercial suicide service at the
Golden Gate Bridge. The prop
rietor Murph has thought of ev
erything: valet parking, designer
body bags (by Gloria Vander
bilt. just $86), gift certificates
for your loved ones, and even
free coffee. The only thing he
doesn't allow is food — it's bad
for business. People are* more
depressed when they're hungry.
Murph's customers are a gen
erally zany collection of local
types. Tina (Joan Hammes) is a
liberated mother, whose 13-
year-old son is a major heroine
dealer in Marin (she got a little
suspicious when he bought a
Lincoln Continental, despite
being too young to drive).
Harold (Kent Minault) is no
longer able to evict old people
from their Tenderloin apart
ments: Richard (Richard Ryan)
is forlorn because all of his favo
rite TV shows are being cancel
led. There is even a streaker
who manages to kill himself
without paying.
In control is Ron Blair as
Murph, a salesman who resem
bles those found on used-car
lots everywhere. The play is full
of good ensemble performances,
under the direction of Kasey
Amold-Ince. The realistic set is
by Stephen Elspas.
"A Letter from Leo Gorcey"
is like Woody Allen's "Play It
Again, Sam," but with Hum
phrey Bogart replaced by the
Bowery Boys. Bryan (Charles
Bouvier) imagines himself to be
Leo Gorcey, the star of the old
Bowery Boys movies. He is so

caught up in his fantasy that he
even materializes two other kids
from the gang. Bryan is married
to Helen (P riscil I a Alden) a
large overbearing woman obses
sed with cleanliness (she goes
through four cans of Lvsol a
week). Bryan is also being
blackmailed by Stacey Moztek
(Elsa Burger), a 14-year-old
who can't decide whether to be
a Pacific Heights bitch or a Fab
Mab punk.
The plot is worked out in true
Bowery-Boys style, with enough
factual details thrown in to
make it comprehensible even
for those who lived culturally
deprived childhoods. It is di
rected by Peter Tripp, with
some exciting action scenes
staged by Allen Gebhardt.
The middle play, "Billy
Angel - ' is considerably more
serious. It is set in a one-room
apartment "on the wrong side of
Beacon Hill" in Boston. Billy
(Joseph Jon Riggs) and David
(James Mathers) have just
woken up early on December
23; Billy, a young and aspiring
trumpet player, picked up the
older David at a bar the night
before. David is a defrocked
whiskey-priest who is dying of
cirrhosis of the liver. The play is
an exploration of the tragedies
in David's life, culminating in a
primitive mass around the
spindly Christmas tree.
"Billy Angel" is the only play
of the three which tries to be
socially significant. It explains
David's condition with anec
dotes from his childhood and his
priesthood — sometimes casting
blame, but more often just indi
cating causes. Much of the play

relates to his traditional Irish-
Catholic upbringing, an upbring
ing which is now alien to most of
us. The result is something
freakish: fascinating to be sure,
but vaguely embarrassing at the
same time. Perhaps the greatest
tragedy of David's life is that his
problems have gone out of fash
ion.
The role of David is central to
the play, both thematically and
theatrically. It is a difficult part,
since David is frequently deliri
ous and obsessed with the
Catholic rituals that have been
his whole life. The breaks bet
ween cogency and delirium are
not convincing, partly because
of the fragmentary writing, and
partly because of James Mathers
performance. The play is di
rected by Neil Stadtmore; the
effective lighting is bv Rhonda
Birnbaum.

Joseph Jon Riggs and James Mathers in John Crabtree's 'Billy
Angel."
Like the Lego books which
show you how to build anything
using their small brightly
colored bricks, the One-Act
Theatre Company shows how
versatile the short play can be.
In addition to a main series, they
have a second stage (for de
veloping new plays and
playrights), lunchtime theatre
(no crunchy veggies, please),
and even Rent-a-Plays (for
those parties where a stripper in

a cake might be considered de
goute).
At the main stage, they are
currently presenting "Premieres
'81," three brand-new one-acts.
"Suicide Franchise" by local au
thor John Angell Grant was
originally presented last fall on
the second stage, but has since
undergone considerable rework
ing. The other two plays are "A
Letter from Leo Gorcey" by
playwright-in-residence Michael
Lynch, and "Billy Angel" by

Bostonian John Crabtree.
"Suicide Franchise" is an ec
centric comedy about a com
mercial suicide service at the
Golden Gate Bridge. The prop
rietor Murph has thought of ev
erything: valet parking, designer
body bags (by Gloria Vander
bilt. just $86), gift certificates
for your loved ones, and even
free coffee. The only thing he
doesn't allow is food — it's bad
for business. People are* more
depressed when they're hungry.
Murph's customers are a gen
erally zany collection of local
types. Tina (Joan Hammes) is a
liberated mother, whose 13-
year-old son is a major heroine
dealer in Marin (she got a little
suspicious when he bought a
Lincoln Continental, despite
being too young to drive).
Harold (Kent Minault) is no
longer able to evict old people
from their Tenderloin apart
ments: Richard (Richard Ryan)
is forlorn because all of his favo
rite TV shows are being cancel
led. There is even a streaker
who manages to kill himself
without paying.
In control is Ron Blair as
Murph, a salesman who resem
bles those found on used-car
lots everywhere. The play is full
of good ensemble performances,
under the direction of Kasey
Amold-Ince. The realistic set is
by Stephen Elspas.
"A Letter from Leo Gorcey"
is like Woody Allen's "Play It
Again, Sam," but with Hum
phrey Bogart replaced by the
Bowery Boys. Bryan (Charles
Bouvier) imagines himself to be
Leo Gorcey, the star of the old
Bowery Boys movies. He is so

caught up in his fantasy that he
even materializes two other kids
from the gang. Bryan is married
to Helen (P riscil I a Alden) a
large overbearing woman obses
sed with cleanliness (she goes
through four cans of Lvsol a
week). Bryan is also being
blackmailed by Stacey Moztek
(Elsa Burger), a 14-year-old
who can't decide whether to be
a Pacific Heights bitch or a Fab
Mab punk.
The plot is worked out in true
Bowery-Boys style, with enough
factual details thrown in to
make it comprehensible even
for those who lived culturally
deprived childhoods. It is di
rected by Peter Tripp, with
some exciting action scenes
staged by Allen Gebhardt.
The middle play, "Billy
Angel - ' is considerably more
serious. It is set in a one-room
apartment "on the wrong side of
Beacon Hill" in Boston. Billy
(Joseph Jon Riggs) and David
(James Mathers) have just
woken up early on December
23; Billy, a young and aspiring
trumpet player, picked up the
older David at a bar the night
before. David is a defrocked
whiskey-priest who is dying of
cirrhosis of the liver. The play is
an exploration of the tragedies
in David's life, culminating in a
primitive mass around the
spindly Christmas tree.
"Billy Angel" is the only play
of the three which tries to be
socially significant. It explains
David's condition with anec
dotes from his childhood and his
priesthood — sometimes casting
blame, but more often just indi
cating causes. Much of the play

relates to his traditional Irish-
Catholic upbringing, an upbring
ing which is now alien to most of
us. The result is something
freakish: fascinating to be sure,
but vaguely embarrassing at the
same time. Perhaps the greatest
tragedy of David's life is that his
problems have gone out of fash
ion.
The role of David is central to
the play, both thematically and
theatrically. It is a difficult part,
since David is frequently deliri
ous and obsessed with the
Catholic rituals that have been
his whole life. The breaks bet
ween cogency and delirium are
not convincing, partly because
of the fragmentary writing, and
partly because of James Mathers
performance. The play is di
rected by Neil Stadtmore; the
effective lighting is bv Rhonda
Birnbaum.
