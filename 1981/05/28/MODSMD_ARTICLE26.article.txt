Dole wages compromise cuts
Washington — Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.),
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, prop
osed yesterday that Congress and President Ronald
Reagan compromise on a 25 percent, three-year cut
in personal income-tax rates.
Such a plan, which was suggested last week by a
group of conservative House Democrats, already
has the tentative endorsement of key policymakers
in the Reagan administration. It would substitute
for the 30 percent, three-year rate cut that is the
heart of Reagan's economic program.
The first tax reduction for individuals would take
effect on Oct. 1.
Dole offered the compromise in a meeting with
reporters.
Although in the past he has been cool to any
multiyear tax-cut plan. Dole also suggested Con
gress could put together with the 25 percent rate cut
a package of tax reductions to include increased
incentives for private retirement plans, phasing out,
of the tax penalty that hurts many working couples',
cutting the maximum tax on investment income and
reducing estate taxes.
Reagan recalls 'shuttle diplomat'
Washington — President Ronald Reagan called
home his special Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, yes
terday to consult over the next U.S. attempt to
prevent an outbreak of fighting between Israel and
Syria. Reagan rejected any suggestion that the mis
sion so far has failed.
Reagan said Israel and Syria had been "on the
verge of war arid that has not happened." And he
declared that Habib had done "a refnarkable job'N
during his three weeks of shuttle diplomacy in
Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Reagan said the veteran diplomat, who is due
here today, would return to the region following
talks expected to last several days.
But there was mounting evidence that Habib had
come up empty-handed in the attempt to use Saudi
Arabia as a mediary for pressuring Syria to with
draw Soviet-made missiles from Lebanon, as de
manded by Israel.
