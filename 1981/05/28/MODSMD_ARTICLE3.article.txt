# Panel argues CutS in education budget
## 
### Louise Solomon 
A sharp difference of opinion
regarding possible effects for
higher education of the prop
osed federal budget cuts
emerged in a panel discussion
last night in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium in this week's Dickin
son Symposium.
The three panelists, visiting
Prof. John Anderson, former
Secretary of Education Shirley
Hufstedler. and Congressman
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), split into two distinct
camps, with Hufstedler and An
derson attacking the paring pro
cess and McCloskey acting as a
defender of President Ronald
Reagan's policy.
"I can answer very succinctly
whether or not it was in the pub
lic interest ?o have the federal
budget reduce funds for higher
education and the answer is no."
Hufstedler said.

She said that the widespread
tear that the federal government
was controlling local education
in elementary and secondary
schools was unfounded. "The
federal government has never
supplied more than K percent of
the costs," Hufstedler said, "hut
this 8 percent goes to the most
needy, the poorest, the hand
icapped and other groups with
severe and special problems.
I his 8 percent does not buy con
trol of anything."
Reagan s proposed budget
slashes the 8 percent figure to ft
percent for 1982-83. Other
education cuts include tuition
support loans for university stu
dents and cuts in research
targeted primarily at the social
sciences.
" I here are people who be
lieve that all you need to do is
reduce funds available for edu
cation and demands of the con
stitution disappear." said Hufs
tedler.
In her closing remarks Hufs
tedler concluded. "If we do not
cultivate human resources, then
why talk about the future of our
country?" The children of the
United States are the future of
our country and, because of our
prominent position, the future
of the world."

McCloskey. defending the
Reagan administration position,
said that inflation had to he re
duced and that the best way to
do it was to axe the federal de
ficit which he said averaged 10
percent of the total budget for
the last five years. McCloskey
said that the poor arc harder hit
by inflation than they would be
from the planned reductions of
social services.
McCloskey said that because

of the pressure of many special
interest groups for federal
funds, roughly 20 percent cuts
are necessary "across the
board." However, in his expla
nation of the federal budget, he
said that the 25 percent allotted
to defense and the 10 percent
allotted to meeting the national
deficit were "impossible to cut
in the face of Russian expendi
tures on arms and domestic in
flation "
