# Murders disturb Stanford Utopia
## 
### Mike Oneal 
Within the violent environ
ment which most of us grew up
in and learned to incorporate
into our everyday lives, news of
a murder is not that uncommon.
It mostly serves as a reminder
that it is dangerous out there
and we do have to watch out for
ourselves.

News analysis

There have been six murder
victims found on Stanford's
campus or unincorporated lands
since 1970. All were killed quite
violently. That number is consis
tent with, or below. the norm for
an area such as this, according to
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of Stan
ford's Department of Public
Safety, but it is still significant.
— Leslie Marie Perlov was kil
led Feb. 16. 1973. She was a
21-year-old graduate and lived
in Los Altos Hills with her pa
rents. She was found strangled
in the Old Quarry area at Stan
ford Ave. and Foothill Express
way.
— Janet Ann Taylor was killed
March 25. 1974. She was the
21-year-old daughter of former
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
She was also found strangled, in
a ditch on Sand Hill Rd. by

Manzanita Way. She was last
seen hitchhiking.
— David S. Levine was killed
Sept. 11. 1973. He was a 20-
year-old senior from Ithaca.
New York. He was stabbed 15
times in front of Meyer Library
between one and 3 a.m.
— Arlis Perry was killed Oct.
12. 1974. She was the 19-year
old wife of Bruce Perry, a
sophomore pre-med. She was
sexually molested and stabbed
in the head inside Memorial
Church. The case was deter
mined to have ritualistic over
tones.
— Karl deLeeuw was killed
Aug. 18. 1978. He was a 48-
year-old mathematics professor.
He was found in his office, the
victim of multiple beatings to
the head with a hammer. Theo
dore, Streleski, a part-time
graduate student working on if
doctoral thesis, turned himself
in as the murderer.
— Horace McNair was killed
this April 25. He was the 35-
vear-old brother of singer Bar
bara McNair and was an un
employed taxi driver from San
Francisco. He was shot in the
head and dropped out of a car
near Stanford Ave. The murder
was probably drug-related.
"Murder is incomprehensi
ble." said Dean\>f Stude/H Af
fairs James*!.yons. "People have
a hard time relating to it. (Of the
six murders), there weren't close
connections with large groups of
students in any of them so
people couldn't really identify
with them. But there have been
some useful actions taken by the
community because of these
sorts of crimes. There's the
SURE escort service . . . and
lighted pathways have enjoyed a
high priority in the University."
All of the cases but that of
Karl deLeeuw have gone unsol
ved, and at this point, the
chances of solving them are not
good. According to Sgt. Kahn of
the Santa Clara Sheriffs Dept.,
there was never much physical
evidence in any of the cases and,
in view of that, after the first 24
to 4N hours, the chances of solv
ing a case decline. All of them
are definitely still active, how
ever.
"Any case could be solved at
any time with the right breaks."
Kahn said. "Information might
come in from other areas that
seems pertinent to something in
our case, and we follow it up. I
was working on a lead on the
Perlov case this week. But it's
not day-to-day work. We might
actively work a case five to six
times a year."
There was no determination
of motive in any of the unsolved
cases and none of them have
been conclusively linked to each
other, according to Kahn. T he
closest the authorities have

come to attempting a link is to
say that the Perlov and Perry
cases seem similar because both
were strangled and neither was
sexually molested. Essentially,
the cases have not progressed
much since the initial investiga
tions. said Kahn.
"The thing that's (particu
larly) frustrating about these
ca»es is that they were on a col
leg< campus.

campus or unincorporated lands
since 1970. All were killed quite
violently. That number is consis
tent with, or below. the norm for
an area such as this, according to
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of Stan
ford's Department of Public
Safety, but it is still significant.
— Leslie Marie Perlov was kil
led Feb. 16. 1973. She was a
21-year-old graduate and lived
in Los Altos Hills with her pa
rents. She was found strangled
in the Old Quarry area at Stan
ford Ave. and Foothill Express
way.
— Janet Ann Taylor was killed
March 25. 1974. She was the
21-year-old daughter of former
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
She was also found strangled, in
a ditch on Sand Hill Rd. by

Manzanita Way. She was last
seen hitchhiking.
— David S. Levine was killed
Sept. 11. 1973. He was a 20-
year-old senior from Ithaca.
New York. He was stabbed 15
times in front of Meyer Library
between one and 3 a.m.
— Arlis Perry was killed Oct.
12. 1974. She was the 19-year
old wife of Bruce Perry, a
sophomore pre-med. She was
sexually molested and stabbed
in the head inside Memorial
Church. The case was deter
mined to have ritualistic over
tones.
— Karl deLeeuw was killed
Aug. 18. 1978. He was a 48-
year-old mathematics professor.
He was found in his office, the
victim of multiple beatings to
the head with a hammer. Theo
dore, Streleski, a part-time
graduate student working on if
doctoral thesis, turned himself
in as the murderer.
— Horace McNair was killed
this April 25. He was the 35-
vear-old brother of singer Bar
bara McNair and was an un
employed taxi driver from San
Francisco. He was shot in the
head and dropped out of a car
near Stanford Ave. The murder
was probably drug-related.
"Murder is incomprehensi
ble." said Dean\>f Stude/H Af
fairs James*!.yons. "People have
a hard time relating to it. (Of the
six murders), there weren't close
connections with large groups of
students in any of them so
people couldn't really identify
with them. But there have been
some useful actions taken by the
community because of these
sorts of crimes. There's the
SURE escort service . . . and
lighted pathways have enjoyed a
high priority in the University."
All of the cases but that of
Karl deLeeuw have gone unsol
ved, and at this point, the
chances of solving them are not
good. According to Sgt. Kahn of
the Santa Clara Sheriffs Dept.,
there was never much physical
evidence in any of the cases and,
in view of that, after the first 24
to 4N hours, the chances of solv
ing a case decline. All of them
are definitely still active, how
ever.
"Any case could be solved at
any time with the right breaks."
Kahn said. "Information might
come in from other areas that
seems pertinent to something in
our case, and we follow it up. I
was working on a lead on the
Perlov case this week. But it's
not day-to-day work. We might
actively work a case five to six
times a year."
There was no determination
of motive in any of the unsolved
cases and none of them have
been conclusively linked to each
other, according to Kahn. T he
closest the authorities have

come to attempting a link is to
say that the Perlov and Perry
cases seem similar because both
were strangled and neither was
sexually molested. Essentially,
the cases have not progressed
much since the initial investiga
tions. said Kahn.
"The thing that's (particu
larly) frustrating about these
ca»es is that they were on a col
leg< campus.
