# Judge blocks offshore leases
## 
### 
lx>s Angeles ( AP)â€” .A federal
ludge yesterday blocked the sale
of 34 oil leases off the central
California coast after Gov. Jerry
Brown and 19 city and county
governments objected to the
sales on environmental grounds.
"There can be no doubt that a
brief delay in the sale of these
leases is in the public interest,"
said U.S. District Judge Mariana
Pfaelzer. "The delay will cause
insignificant monetary injury to
the U.S. government or to the
potential lease holders "
The judge said U.S. Interior
Secretary James Watt had used
too narrow an interpretation"

of federal law in excluding
California from participating in
pre-lease dealing with the oil
companies.
She said California's right to
control development of the
coast under the Coastal Zone
Management Act "would he lost
forever" if it was excluded from
pre-lease arrangements, such as
including developmental stipu
lations.
Sealed bids for the tracts were
being accepted from oil com
panies yesterday and today "by
the Bureau of Land Manage
ment at the Anaheim Conven
tion Center.

In seeking the injunction.
Brown had contended that Watt
acted illegally in opening for
lease 34 of 115 tracts in the
Santa Maria Basin north of
Santa Barbara.
Brown's suit sought to block
only the most environmentally
sensitive tracts of undersea land
covering 600,000 acres ranging
from three to 27 miles of the
coast.
Ihe suit did not oppose the
sale of HI other offshore tracts
Brown claimed the danger ot
environmental damage from
possible oil spills outweighed
potential benetits of drilling
