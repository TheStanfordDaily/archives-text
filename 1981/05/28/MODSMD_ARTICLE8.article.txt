# Campus running: a many splendored thing
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Three more laps. Two more
blocks. One more mile.
Around the tracks, in the
faculty ghetto and through the
foothills surrounding the Uni
versity, Stanford students,
teachers and staff are counting
down the distance as they run.
Running on. Not on empty, how
ever. Through the springtime.
The running craze which
swept the country several years
ago with the publication of Jim
Fixx's book, The Complete
Hook of Running, continues in
full swing at Stanford. The paths
traversed, the distances trav
eled and the reasons for the rit
ualistic grueling in
cardiovascular wonder are as
varied as the people pounding
the pavements around the Uni
versity each evening.
Some are experts. Phil Des
jardines, a senior from Terra
House, has been running regu
larly for six years. The thin elec
trical engineering major runs
more than five miles each eve
ning because "It's good for
one's health and it gets the body
feeling tight."
Some are amateurs. Senior
Monica Menco runs two miles
every day because "it makes
me feel good, it helps me control
my weight, I like it and it keeps
me in shape. "
Fred Behling of the depart
ment of sports medicine of the
Palo Alto Clinic agrees. "Run
ning which effectively stresses
the cardiovascular system can
benefit the body by making
breathing more efficient, by in
creasing the body 's ability to up
date its oxygen mechanization
and by helping one get in
shape."
"Running to be beneficial
should be done on a regular
basis and tor challenging, man
ageable distances," added Behl
ing.
"Manageable distances'"
vary from person to person.
Lori Sutherland, a senior, runs
two or three miles a few times a
week, while junior Dave Frank
logs four or more miles several
times a week. President Donald
Kennedy keeps pace with the
best of the University joggers,
running a four mile course each
Tuesday and Thursday morn
ing.
Jogging experts, track

coaches and doctors agree any
runner interested in running tor
health reasons should work up to
the desired distance slowly,
steadily on a regular, conscien
tious basis. "Distance runners
should have medical clearance
and should begin a running pro
gram by going very slowly and
on progressively longer dis
tances," said Diane Pagani,
nurse at Cowell Student Health
Center.
"Running too far too fast can
cause shin splints, pulled
muscles, cramps and foot
strain," Behling said. Shin
splints, inflammation in lower
leg blood vessels, are a common
ailment of begining runners and
joggers who run on hard sur
faces. according to Pagani. At
the Palo Alto Clinic, Behling
sees two or three patients a
week for running related ail
ments, most of which are in
cluded under "the catch all
phase," shin splints, said Behl
ing.
Pagani could give no esti
mates on the number of
students visiting Cowell
each week tor running injuries,
but noted "the number of stu
dents seeking help varies with
the season. We see more in the
spring." Treatment for running
ailments varies from heat ap
plications tor sore, pulled
muscles to prohibitions on jog
ging altogether for victims of
severe shin splints.
The possibility of running in
jury scares very tew Stan
tordites away. Area residents
run for a myriad of reasons. "I
used to run because I wasn't
dancing and wanted to keep in
shape. Then one night, I was
pretty wasted and I had to get
sobered up quickly so my room
mate and I went running on an
obstacle course. It was very fun
ny and I don't remember much,
but we sobered up, alright,"
said Sutherland.
Runners' high, a heightened
sense of exhileration ex
perienced primarily by distance
runners, is not a joke. Although
many joggers and distance
runners never sense this
phenomenon, many regular
sprinters contend this feeling
keeps them hitting the tracks,
streets or hills every day.
"Many runners say they have
a natural high from running. I

don't know if this experience is
just exercising and being out
doors, but I know of no proven
medical explanation for the
feeling," said Pagani.
DesJardins feels no high
from running, while
Frank describes the
phenomenon as analogous to
being "inside a car and aU you
are doing is steering. You don't
have to put your feet on the
pedals or think about the driving
or anything. It's all effortless."
For many students, running is
a release from the tensions of
school. "I run oft a lot ot tension
in the jog to the Dish." said
Frank. "I meditate while I run
and I relax," said Sutherland.
"Many students find the physi
cal exhaustion that comes with
running also includes emotional
exhaustion," Pagani said.

blocks. One more mile.
Around the tracks, in the
faculty ghetto and through the
foothills surrounding the Uni
versity, Stanford students,
teachers and staff are counting
down the distance as they run.
Running on. Not on empty, how
ever. Through the springtime.
The running craze which
swept the country several years
ago with the publication of Jim
Fixx's book, The Complete
Hook of Running, continues in
full swing at Stanford. The paths
traversed, the distances trav
eled and the reasons for the rit
ualistic grueling in
cardiovascular wonder are as
varied as the people pounding
the pavements around the Uni
versity each evening.
Some are experts. Phil Des
jardines, a senior from Terra
House, has been running regu
larly for six years. The thin elec
trical engineering major runs
more than five miles each eve
ning because "It's good for
one's health and it gets the body
feeling tight."
Some are amateurs. Senior
Monica Menco runs two miles
every day because "it makes
me feel good, it helps me control
my weight, I like it and it keeps
me in shape. "
Fred Behling of the depart
ment of sports medicine of the
Palo Alto Clinic agrees. "Run
ning which effectively stresses
the cardiovascular system can
benefit the body by making
breathing more efficient, by in
creasing the body 's ability to up
date its oxygen mechanization
and by helping one get in
shape."
"Running to be beneficial
should be done on a regular
basis and tor challenging, man
ageable distances," added Behl
ing.
"Manageable distances'"
vary from person to person.
Lori Sutherland, a senior, runs
two or three miles a few times a
week, while junior Dave Frank
logs four or more miles several
times a week. President Donald
Kennedy keeps pace with the
best of the University joggers,
running a four mile course each
Tuesday and Thursday morn
ing.
Jogging experts, track

coaches and doctors agree any
runner interested in running tor
health reasons should work up to
the desired distance slowly,
steadily on a regular, conscien
tious basis. "Distance runners
should have medical clearance
and should begin a running pro
gram by going very slowly and
on progressively longer dis
tances," said Diane Pagani,
nurse at Cowell Student Health
Center.
"Running too far too fast can
cause shin splints, pulled
muscles, cramps and foot
strain," Behling said. Shin
splints, inflammation in lower
leg blood vessels, are a common
ailment of begining runners and
joggers who run on hard sur
faces. according to Pagani. At
the Palo Alto Clinic, Behling
sees two or three patients a
week for running related ail
ments, most of which are in
cluded under "the catch all
phase," shin splints, said Behl
ing.
Pagani could give no esti
mates on the number of
students visiting Cowell
each week tor running injuries,
but noted "the number of stu
dents seeking help varies with
the season. We see more in the
spring." Treatment for running
ailments varies from heat ap
plications tor sore, pulled
muscles to prohibitions on jog
ging altogether for victims of
severe shin splints.
The possibility of running in
jury scares very tew Stan
tordites away. Area residents
run for a myriad of reasons. "I
used to run because I wasn't
dancing and wanted to keep in
shape. Then one night, I was
pretty wasted and I had to get
sobered up quickly so my room
mate and I went running on an
obstacle course. It was very fun
ny and I don't remember much,
but we sobered up, alright,"
said Sutherland.
Runners' high, a heightened
sense of exhileration ex
perienced primarily by distance
runners, is not a joke. Although
many joggers and distance
runners never sense this
phenomenon, many regular
sprinters contend this feeling
keeps them hitting the tracks,
streets or hills every day.
"Many runners say they have
a natural high from running. I

don't know if this experience is
just exercising and being out
doors, but I know of no proven
medical explanation for the
feeling," said Pagani.
DesJardins feels no high
from running, while
Frank describes the
phenomenon as analogous to
being "inside a car and aU you
are doing is steering. You don't
have to put your feet on the
pedals or think about the driving
or anything. It's all effortless."
For many students, running is
a release from the tensions of
school. "I run oft a lot ot tension
in the jog to the Dish." said
Frank. "I meditate while I run
and I relax," said Sutherland.
"Many students find the physi
cal exhaustion that comes with
running also includes emotional
exhaustion," Pagani said.
