# Bay Area run 'fun'
## 
### Eric Cornell 
San Francisco's clear air was a
little cold at 7:15 that Sunday
morning. But the sun soon
shone warmer, the crowd pres
sed closer, and my shivers stop
ped.
My tour dormmates took
nervous steps in one direction or
another, but the crowd wouldn't
have it: we were locked in, wait
ing on the start of the 70th an
nual San Francisco Examiner
Bay to Breakers road race.
The people around us were
somberly attired — for runners.
Where was the promised diver
sity? Forty-five minutes before
the starting gun. runners filled
the street from curb to curb and
stretched back a block and a
half, but most of the mob was
still eating breakfast. The 4000
early risers had the look of dedi
cated pavement pounders.
Suddenly I was standing in
shadow. Gliding high on the
arms of a two-man ground crew,
a 15-foot model of the space
shuttle passed gracefully over
head.
And now the ice was broken.
A man wearing only a leopard
skin pushed past us, heading for
the front. He vanished into the
mob.
A woman in a pink tutu
wafted by, went en point for a
moment, then wafted on.
On the starting line (3:56)
The clock read 3:54 as we
walked over the starting line.
We had done quite a bit of walk
ing since the starting gun had
fired. You can't run when the
person in front of you walks. He
can't run when the person in
front of him walks. Eventually
space would open up for run
ning but meanwhile — I'm told
walking is better for your spine.
While the large majority of the
entrants had not reached the
starting line, eventual winner
Craig Virgin had finished most
of his first mile at the 3:54 mark.
Four miles — (46:12)
We turned onto Fell Street
and ran along the strip of green
ery, the "Panhandle," project
ing from the park.

A breeze wafted the welcome
essence of eucalyptus trees
through the tiring runners. Ah,
eucalyptus, after 30 blocks of
bus tumes and sweat! It seemed
to me that I was neither thirsty,
hungry nor tired, but that I was
missing, something, and now my
soul's every need had been tilted
by the leafy perfume.
Two runners had dropped out
by the side of the road with their
20 foot long cardboard creation.
The race was now without an
MX missile. '
A centipede came by, and I
watched as the 13 pairs of legs
chattered with each other.
Minutes later, as 1 watched
the 26 legs pull away, it occur
red to me that for all the wierd
apparel, every runner had a
couple of things in common with
every other: two good running
shoes. Runners, even wacko
runners, do not joke about
shoes.
The man in the ape suit, for
instance, wore Brooks.
The groom in the tuxedo wore
Nike.
At the end of every leg was an
Adidas, a Kasaga, a Tiger;
60.000 feet shod at $35 a pair —
a million dollars worth of foot
gear skimmed through Golden
Ciate park.
This year's race attracted
27,000 registered runners and
enough illegal runners to bring
the total to over 30,000. Accord
ing to the San Francisco
Examiner, this year's event was
the largest road race of all time.
Runners could compete as in
dividuals in the usual fashion or
as a "centipede," in a group of 13
or more runners tied together at
the waist. Several dozen cen
tipedes finished.
The finish line (1:17:26)
After miles of hills, we finally
turned the last corner and ran
the last 200 yards alongside the
beach.
People who had been saving
something for "the last kick,"
kicked.
Those who hadn't, didn't.
The faces of many around us
were studies in pain and deter
mination. One man dropped
