# COSS's proposal confusing
## 
### Victor Goetz 
Various campus minority groups
,and the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) are concerned over possible
changes in a university subcommittee
on minority issues
The concern arose from a recom
mendation prepared last Friday by
the Committee on Services to Students
(COSS). The recommendation said
that its subcommittee structure
should be re-evaluated before nomi
nations are accepted for COSS-M, the
subcommittee on minority issues
Newly installed COP member Fred
Buhl said he was unaware of the move
until a Minority Coordinating Com
mittee meeting he attended at noon
yesterday was informed of the vote by
a COSS student member in atten
dance.
The major problem at this time
seems to be a lack of understanding of
exactly what happened at last Fri
day's COSS meeting and what the im
plications may be
After discussing the matter last
night, the COP is scheduled to meet
with President Donald Kennedy this
morning.
Buhl expressed a tear that the sub
committee had in effect been dis
solved for next year.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president and co-chairman of COSS,
emphatically called this evaluation
"wrong."
"COSS this year recommended that
COSS next year make as its first order
of business next year an examination
of its standing subcommittees," he
said.
Confusion
Apparently some contusion exists
even over the context ot the recom
mendation Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, another member of
COSS, said the discussion came about
during the preparation of the commit
tee's annual report to the president.
Student committee member Lisa Pan
said she was unclear as to the nature
of the discussion in which she had par
ticipated.
"My interpretation of what hap
pened is that it had been decided to tell
the COP not to nominate student
members to COSS-M." she said.
Buhl's concern at not being in
formed of this discussion stemmed
from the fact that these nominations
have already been made and are ready
for ASSU Senate approval on Monday.
'Legitimate option'
Lyons said the choice not to appoint
new subcommittee members at this
time, pending the planned evaluation,
was a legitimate option open to COSS.
He cautioned that COSS-M is not a
standing University committee like
its parent COSS. and exists only be
cause COSS chose to allocate some of
its work to a subcommittee.
"No one around here runs Univer
sity committees. If a committee
chooses to exercise its options they
surely can do it. That's what COSS
did," he said. "What happens some
times is that the ASSU anticipates
traditional requests." According to
Lyons, COSS has in the past called on
the ASSU Nominations Committee to
select student members for the sub-*
committee, though this is npt man
dated. *
He pointed out that a re-evaluated
subcommittee might seejk a different
type of student membership than the

current structure. "We coukf have
waited for next year's committee to
get organized and then decide in Octo
ber to revamp its subcommittees and
then tell the ASSU that the people it
nominated were not appropriate for
the new structure."
The parent committee would have
more freedom to organize its subcom
mittee structure effectively if it were
not forced into staying the same sim
ply because its membership had been
established in advance, he said.
Low regard
Lyons cited as a reason for the ac
tion the feeling that some of the topics
discussed by COSS-M do not get high
enough regard because they are re
legated to a "subcommittee," though
important enough to discuss in the pa
rent committee. The subcommittee's
charge, revised several years ago
when it last came under such scrutiny,
specifically empowers it to deal with
currently sensitive issues such as
theme houses.
"Although COSS-M got off to a late
start this year, they've been doing
good work. One of the difficulties with
COSS-M is that they deal with issues
that COSS often feels it should look
into itself," said former COP member
Nancy Takahashi.
Both Pan and Buhl questioned

whether the possible elimination of
the only University committee specif
ically dealing with minority concerns
might reflect a de-emphasis of the is
sue.
"The subcommittee was created to
serve minority issues that COSS didn't
have time for. This can be looked upon
as a case where the University is phas
ing out another service to the minority
community. Bift, if it is just a com
munication problem as it now seems
we wonder why we aren't better in
formed," said Buhl.
"Now that we don't have a specific
minority^affairs committee, these is
sues could easily be swept aside,"
warned Pan.
Buhl added that he was greatly con
cerned with the timing of the move,
coming at the end of the year. "All
next year we'll go without a COSS-M
just because of an end of the year,
Saturday night' action. I don't think
anyone disagrees with the idea that
the committee needs to be strength
ened. But dissolving it doesn't do that.
When you re trying to strengthen a
committee by trying to pick serious
people, it calls into question whether
student input is still important," said
Buhl about the decision to hold nomi
nations after the selections had al
ready been made.

Various campus minority groups
,and the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) are concerned over possible
changes in a university subcommittee
on minority issues
The concern arose from a recom
mendation prepared last Friday by
the Committee on Services to Students
(COSS). The recommendation said
that its subcommittee structure
should be re-evaluated before nomi
nations are accepted for COSS-M, the
subcommittee on minority issues
Newly installed COP member Fred
Buhl said he was unaware of the move
until a Minority Coordinating Com
mittee meeting he attended at noon
yesterday was informed of the vote by
a COSS student member in atten
dance.
The major problem at this time
seems to be a lack of understanding of
exactly what happened at last Fri
day's COSS meeting and what the im
plications may be
After discussing the matter last
night, the COP is scheduled to meet
with President Donald Kennedy this
morning.
Buhl expressed a tear that the sub
committee had in effect been dis
solved for next year.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president and co-chairman of COSS,
emphatically called this evaluation
"wrong."
"COSS this year recommended that
COSS next year make as its first order
of business next year an examination
of its standing subcommittees," he
said.
Confusion
Apparently some contusion exists
even over the context ot the recom
mendation Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, another member of
COSS, said the discussion came about
during the preparation of the commit
tee's annual report to the president.
Student committee member Lisa Pan
said she was unclear as to the nature
of the discussion in which she had par
ticipated.
"My interpretation of what hap
pened is that it had been decided to tell
the COP not to nominate student
members to COSS-M." she said.
Buhl's concern at not being in
formed of this discussion stemmed
from the fact that these nominations
have already been made and are ready
for ASSU Senate approval on Monday.
'Legitimate option'
Lyons said the choice not to appoint
new subcommittee members at this
time, pending the planned evaluation,
was a legitimate option open to COSS.
He cautioned that COSS-M is not a
standing University committee like
its parent COSS. and exists only be
cause COSS chose to allocate some of
its work to a subcommittee.
"No one around here runs Univer
sity committees. If a committee
chooses to exercise its options they
surely can do it. That's what COSS
did," he said. "What happens some
times is that the ASSU anticipates
traditional requests." According to
Lyons, COSS has in the past called on
the ASSU Nominations Committee to
select student members for the sub-*
committee, though this is npt man
dated. *
He pointed out that a re-evaluated
subcommittee might seejk a different
type of student membership than the

current structure. "We coukf have
waited for next year's committee to
get organized and then decide in Octo
ber to revamp its subcommittees and
then tell the ASSU that the people it
nominated were not appropriate for
the new structure."
The parent committee would have
more freedom to organize its subcom
mittee structure effectively if it were
not forced into staying the same sim
ply because its membership had been
established in advance, he said.
Low regard
Lyons cited as a reason for the ac
tion the feeling that some of the topics
discussed by COSS-M do not get high
enough regard because they are re
legated to a "subcommittee," though
important enough to discuss in the pa
rent committee. The subcommittee's
charge, revised several years ago
when it last came under such scrutiny,
specifically empowers it to deal with
currently sensitive issues such as
theme houses.
"Although COSS-M got off to a late
start this year, they've been doing
good work. One of the difficulties with
COSS-M is that they deal with issues
that COSS often feels it should look
into itself," said former COP member
Nancy Takahashi.
Both Pan and Buhl questioned

whether the possible elimination of
the only University committee specif
ically dealing with minority concerns
might reflect a de-emphasis of the is
sue.
"The subcommittee was created to
serve minority issues that COSS didn't
have time for. This can be looked upon
as a case where the University is phas
ing out another service to the minority
community. Bift, if it is just a com
munication problem as it now seems
we wonder why we aren't better in
formed," said Buhl.
"Now that we don't have a specific
minority^affairs committee, these is
sues could easily be swept aside,"
warned Pan.
Buhl added that he was greatly con
cerned with the timing of the move,
coming at the end of the year. "All
next year we'll go without a COSS-M
just because of an end of the year,
Saturday night' action. I don't think
anyone disagrees with the idea that
the committee needs to be strength
ened. But dissolving it doesn't do that.
When you re trying to strengthen a
committee by trying to pick serious
people, it calls into question whether
student input is still important," said
Buhl about the decision to hold nomi
nations after the selections had al
