# Report suggests S. Africa policy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Johannesburg, South Africa
— An unofficial American com
mission urged the Reagan ad
ministration to express "fun
damental opposition" to the
South African government's ra
cial policies
The group, headed by Frank
lin Thomas, president of the
Ford Foundation, said that it
the South African government
does not move ahead in extend
ing political rights to the black
majority here, the United States
should toughen its economic
boycott against South Africa.
Copies of the report, titled
"South Africa: Time Running
Out," were distributed here and
in Washington. There was no
immediate comment from
South African Prime Minister
Pieter Botha.
Members of the 11-member
commission included Chester
Crocker, who has since been
named assistant secretary ot
state for African affairs, and six
educators, three business ex
ecutives and a labor leader.
The commission advocated
that the United States extend its
arms embargo and stiffen its
ban on supplying South Africa
with nuclear materials if the
Botha government continues to
refuse to consider sharing polit
ical power with the blacks.
It took a softer stand on the
question of how American cor
porations should apply pressure
on South Africa to end racial dis
crimination. The commission
recommended only that Ameri
can companies in South Africa
not expand their operations, and
that "those not already (here)
should stay out."
The commission came out
flatly against American com
panies and individuals divesting
themselves of any of the $2
billion that they have invested
here. And it did not advocate a
break in non-military trade with
South Africa, which was valued
at $3.4 billion last year.
One object ot American poli
cy, tor both government and
business, should be to "support
organizations inside South
Africa working for change, as

sist the development of black
leadership and promote black
welfare," the commission said
Specifically, it said American
companies in South Africa
should commit "a generous pro
portion" of corporate resources
to improve the lives of their
black employees.
In the event that there is no
significant moderation in the
South African system of racial
separation, known as apartheid,
the commission said, the Rea
gan Administration should re
duce its diplomatic representa
tion here but not make a com
plete break. It also proposed a
limit on exports ot American
technology, such as that being
used in South Africa's search for
oil. The country is rich in manv
minerals but has no oil.
The commission also ad
vocated that the United States
increase its aid to other coun
tries in southern Africa as a
means of enabling them to re
duce their dependence on South
Africa. The United States
should increase its stockpiles of
chrome and other strategic
metals and so reduce its depen
dence on South African min
erals, the report added.
No deadline was fixed tor the
South African government to
show real progress in racial re
lations, but the report made it
clear that U.S. government and
business should move quickly to
black leaders in South Africa,
and that aid to surrounding
black countries should be made
available "as soon as possible."
The commission urged Presi
dent Reagan to issue a
statement defining U.S. in
terests in South Africa and the
entire region, and to describe in
broad terms the adminis
tration's policy toward the re
gion. It called for formation of a
high-level interdepartmental
committee to coordinate policy.
The commission, whose
members spent 2V2 months in
South Africa in 1980, said that
"fundamental political change
. . . without sustained large
scale violence is still possible,
although time is running out."
