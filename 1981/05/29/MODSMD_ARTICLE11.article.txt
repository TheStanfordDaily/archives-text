# Emotions run high as Israel election nears
## 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — As Is
rael's election campaign slips
into high gear, the threat of war
with Syria over its missiles in
Lebanon has deeply divided the
Jewish state, which in years
past has taken pride in its ability
to close ranks in times of na
tional emergency.
No one argues with Prime
Minister Menachem Begin s de
mand that Syria remove the
anti-aircratt missile batteries it
wheeled into Lebanon last
month after Israel downed two
Syrian helicopters.
But the opposition Labor par
ty, feeling a wide lead slipping

away, has charged Begin with
"national irresponsibility" tor
getting into a showdown with
Syria over the issue.
Labor's accusations have
turned the missile crisis into a
heated issue tor the June 30 vot
ing. It also has given the country
an uncomtortable teeling that
its house is divided when it most
needs unity.
No polls have been published
since the tirst week of the crisis,
but experts say the confronta
tion with Syria probably has
boosted Begin s popularity.
Public opinion analyst

Hanoch Smith says Israelis usu
ally rally around their govern
ment in the face ot external
threat, and the public generally
has become more hawkish in re
cent years.
One Israeli newspaper pub
lished a cartoon depicting the
protagonists, including the
United States and the Soviet
Union, chasing each other like
dogs in a circle. The Israeli fig
ure limps atter the others with
his toot stuck in a ballot box.
On Sunday, the government
rejected an opposition otfer to
sever the Lebanon crisis from

the campaign it Begin agreed to
bring in opposition leader
Shimon Peres on decisions.
"It is the government that has
to deal with and control national
affairs," said a Cabinet
statement. The opposition pro
posal was "not the proper way."
The Cabinet decision may
mean a bitter fight focusing on
the Lebanon issue rather than
on the economy, the traditional
battleground ot Israeli election
politics. With the two major
parties nearly even in the polls
but Labor showing some slip,
the issue could swing the elec
tion results.
