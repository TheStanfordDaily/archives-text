# Called a 'unique commune'
## Children's Hospital treats body and soul 
### Cyndi Gordon 
It could be called a commune. The
members live under one roof, take part
in communal activities, and strive to
gether towards a common goal of sur
vival.
Y.et, this is no ordinary commune.
Some of the members are confined to
wheelchairs or are missing limbs. Oth
ers have severe emotional disorders.
Still, each member wears a plastic
bracelet identifying him or her as a
member of this commune — the Chil
dren's Hospital at Stanford.
For 60 years. Children's Hospital has
helped children from all over the world
tight their battles against chronic dis
eases and disabilities.
"We provide the most advanced medi
cal care possible tor seriously ill and dis
abled children," said Executive Direc
tor John Williams, "while maintaining
the unique, personalized care that has
characterized the hospital since its
earliest days."
This "two-fold" care involves the
treatment of the whole patient, not just
his or her diseased tissues. An emphasis
is placed on the child becoming self-suf
ficient despite severe handicaps.
"We are not only encouraged to get

well but, also, to Hue with our diseases,"
explained an emaciated 19-year-old
anorexia nervosa patient.
This encouragement is apparent in ev
ery corner of the hospital where "nor
mal" childhood activities abound. In the
school, a special education program of
the Palo Alto Unified School District,
professional teachers help the children
keep up with their studies.
liie recreation room provides elec
tronic video games and a pool table as
well as traditional arts and crafts mate
rial. Members of the volunteer staff take
the children on one-day field trips out
side the hospital grounds to such places
as Yosemite Park and Great America.
"These activities not only make ward
living non-institutional, but expand a
child's abilities and self-confidence by
developing new skills," one nurse ex
plained, "If a youngster has to be hospi
talized, this is a super place to be," she
said.
But the true proof of Children's Hospi
tal's success is visible in many of its
young patients. An example is Matthew
Spadia, age five, who does not have the
thin, pale, concave frame of a cystic
fibrosis child, even though he suffers
from the disease.

Instead, Matthew builds his body by
swimming twice a week and will return
to start nursery school in the fall.
Another success story involves 10-
year-old Jessica Saal, who responded so
well to the treatments for her juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis that she is no longer
on medication and often has trouble con
vincing other children that she has physi
cal limitations.
However, not all the children succeed
in conquering their illnesses. In these
cases, the hospital's policy is to return
the children to their home environments
as quickly as possible.
"When it becomes clear that the child
will not survive, we stop pouring in more
toxic drugs that will only increase
sickness," said Dr. Bertril Glader, chief
of the Hemotology/Oncology service.
"Our goal is to insure the quality of re
maining lite is the best possible."
Thus, in both success and failure, the
commune at Children's Hospital works.
Perhaps the words of a 14-year-old pa
tient on the psychosomatic unit state this
idea most clearly:
"I really am proud of myself. I'm
doing what everybody does and with
them. I feel part of everything again.
