## Photo exhibit shows 'futurism' of the past 
### Tony Bouffard 
During the next few weeks,
the future will be on display at
Tresidder Union.
An exhibit titled, "The
Future That Was Going To Be:
A Halt Century ot Popular Im
agery," depicts visual concep
tions of life in the future as de
picted by people in the past.
Various subtopics presented
in color and black and white
photographs include: cities,
role models ot future men and
women, robots, space travel,
and exploration. The reproduc
tions were taken from various
twentieth century magazines
such as Popular Science
Monthly, The Saturday Eve
ning Post, and Amazing Stories.
The project is an undertaking
of the Values, Technology, and
Society 125 class "Past Visions
ot American Futures," taught
by Protessor Joseph Corn ot the
VTS department.
"The course grew out of my
interest in the hopes and expec
tations which Americans have
held for technology," said Corn.
"As a people we have projected
often extravagant hopes into
new machines and processes,
hopes that become frustrated
when dreams tail to material

ize," he said.
Craig Rublaa, a member ot
the class, elaborated on the "ex
travagant hopes" of inventors
and futurists. "Those dreams
that failed, that never became
reality, God knows there are a
lot ot them, are what make this
exhibit fun and interesting," he
said.
"Don't forget," said Ken
Whitney, a senior majoring in
economics, "some of those
dreams did come true though.
Where would we be if no one had
dreamed about their future, or
should I say our present?
Hopefully this exhibit will make
people think a little about our
future and our children's pres

ent," Whitney said.
"Futurism. What do people
think when they hear that word?
Phasers? Space Colonies?"
asked an American Studies ma
jor taking the class. "Everyone
is wondering where society is
going. Looking at where people
used to think we were going
gives us a perspective on our
own future."
The exhibition is the cul
mination of a quarter of rum
maging through stacks of maga
zines from Bay Area libraries,
many hours of discussion, and a
couple ot weekends of hammer
and nail construction. "I in
cluded the exhibit project in the
course not only as a way of vary

ing the customary end-proddct*
of student research efforts tyut
also as a means of exposing stu
dents to an aspect of material
culture," said Professor Corn.
"By creating an exhibition
from these images (those col
lected by the students), studerits
must address issues of com
munication and education
which are quite different,
though no less important, than
those confronted in writing a pa
per," he said.
The project was funded by the
Offices of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies and the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences ahd
will tentatively run thru Jiijie
9th.
