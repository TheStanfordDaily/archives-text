## Editorial Feminist major beneficial

The Feminist Studies major won ap
proval recently as an official in
terdisciplinary program whose students
may be granted degrees through the Indi
vidually Designed Majors program. For a
broad variety of reasons, we believe this is
a sound step and one that has great poten
tial lor promoting more open-minded at
titudes by virtue of its very existence.
The basic premise of feminist studies is
that an alternative analysis exists that can
provide non-mainstream perspectives on
human culture. The program looks at dis
ciplines that have been traditionally domi
nated by men, such as history, economics,
political science, technology, and from a
feminist, i.e., gender-conscious per
spective. It examines the ways in which
the gender of the actors involved and our
gender-oriented behavior shaped events.
It is wise that the University has chosen
to institutionalize this viewpoint by grant
ing it the legitimacy that comes with "pro
gram" status. It is not, as some of its
critics have charged, a separatist major.

one that is a priori anti-men, but rather of
fers new ways of looking at these issues,
ways that can stimulate thought even if
they are not wholly accepted.
These critics should also note that the
program does not require that those who
major in it be women or feminists. It is a
major that focuses on the implications of
gender and sex roles. It is not just an ex
clusively women-oriented "Women's
Studies" major as exists at other univer
sities.
Especially given the concerns that have
been expressed, most notably by Assoc.
Political Science Prof. Nan Keohane in
her address to the incoming freshman
class, that the new Western Culture re
quirement is weighted heavily toward the
history and accomplishments of men. this
program is particularly important.
Given this, and the recent relocation to
Stanford of SIGNS, the journal of
feminist thought, Stanford may be an in
novator in feminist thought and educa
tional theory.
