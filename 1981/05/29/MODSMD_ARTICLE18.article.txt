Kennedy responds
(Editor's note: This is in re
sponse to the letter protesting
the lack of student input in
selection of the Law School
Dean Search Committee. That
letter, signed by 166 law stu
dents, appeared in the Daily on
May 26.)
I've read the argument
carefully, and I must say I do
not find it persuasive. Let me
trv to explain why.
In the first place. I think I
ought to set out my view about
the purpose ot having students
on such committees. (I am not a
newcomer to the subject; I was
chairman ot one of the first de
partments to invite students to
serve on such committees, in
about 1967, and I have been an
active supporter of such ser
vices since.) That purpose is to
bring to the process ot decision
making new views, new knowl
edge, and new capacities that
are likely to be brought by stu
dents. The purpose is em
phatically not to produce a kind
of "representation." We do not
seek to provide that as we select
the faculty members of search
committees. True, we do reach
for diversity in a number of dif
ferent ways; but we realize the
futility of fully encompassing
faculty diversity in a sample so
small, and we would firmly re
ject the notion that the mem
bers so chosen be expected to
"represent" some character
istic (of gender, ethnicity, age,
or whatever) they might
possess. This applies to the stu
dent body, where the sample is
necessarily an even smaller
proportion of the universe.

Your own letter clearly il
lustrates the difficulties into
which this approach propels
one. You claim to find it "of
fensive" that in the sample of
two students chosen by their
positions no woman is included.
But in tact it is impossible to
"represent" a large universe
with a pair of persons, and not
neglect to represent some
important dimension of the di
versity of that population. I also
disagree with the underlying as
sumption. that a person lacking
a part\cu\ar characteristic or
interest cannot possibly speak
effectively for it.
Now let me turn to the matter
of the selections themselves.
You say, "It is totally un
persuasive that the students
were chosen in accordance with
tradition.' " I am a bit per
plexed by the use of the word
"unpersuasive," since I cer
tainly never tried to persuade
you or anyone that tradition was
the basis of that choice. Since
you bring the subject up, how
ever, let me point out that the
custom is actually two searches
old, not one: the Committee ap
pointed in '970 had two office
holders (in that case the Presi
dent and Vice President of the
Student Law Association).
But that is really beside the
point: I did not select the Presi
dent of the Stanford Law Re
view because of any tradition,
but instead because I thought it
a good idea. The processes that
produced the selection of those
two Presidents augur well tor
the likelihood that they will
make a contribution to the work
of the Committee.
To summarize: the students

whom I have named to the Com
mittee are likely, by virtue of
their individual abilities and
their mode of selection, to give
the Committee an enlarged per
spective and valuable help in its
work. I do not consider them as
having the obligation to "repre
sent" the full range of views
present in the Law School stu
dent body. I believe such repre
sentation is quite impossible,
and in any event I do not think it
is desirable; we are not creating
a legislature. As to the ade
quacy ot student participation
and the openness of the selec
tion process, I do not — for rea
sons I've given above — find my
self in agreement with your
argument. I do encourage you,
however, to use whatever
means you choose to make all of
the Committee's members —
students and faculty alike —
aware ot the full range ot con
cerns among Law students, and
of the ways in which you think
the Committee's work should
attempt to meet them. I shall
urge the Committee and the
Provost to attend carefully to
your representations.

Insult to injury
If a student at Stanford Uni
versity gets injured on campus
he receives the top medical at
tention available, right?
Wrong! What he does receive is
a trip to Cowell Student Health
Center. If he is unlucky enough
to be injured right after "regu
lar hours" he is met by a curt re
ceptionist that tersely asks why
he did not come sooner. Then af

ter a few moments of resistance
he is allowed to enter the center
where he is met by another bat
tery of questions offered in a
rather cold and certainly not
comforting atmosphere.
The individual, in this
case who had received a series
of cuts and bruises from a bike
accident, is lectured for 20
minutes on how to bandage his
own wounds rather than the
nurse taking the five minutes to
do it herself. The nurse not only
provided no real treatment but
also was about as comtorting as
Idi Amin. Now maybe I'm
wrong, but I kind of thought that
when I pay Stanford University
well over ten thousand a year I
could expect a little bit better
treatment from the health cen
ter that exists for the students.
This is also not an isolated in
cident I am told. Four friends of
mine, each arriving at different
times, explain that they re
ceived similar cold, im
personal, and on a whole un
helpful attention. I must say
that from the minute I left Cow
ell I was fuming. There is some
thing totally infuriating about
inadequate medical care in a
place that constantly performs
operations and treatment of
world renowned quality and
complexity. I am certainly in
terested in Cowell's response
and perhaps excuse. I merely
felt this was a time to speak out,
and to those who might by mis
fortune become inured perhaps
the worst part of your ordeal is
yet to come.

vices since.) That purpose is to
bring to the process ot decision
making new views, new knowl
edge, and new capacities that
are likely to be brought by stu
dents. The purpose is em
phatically not to produce a kind
of "representation." We do not
seek to provide that as we select
the faculty members of search
committees. True, we do reach
for diversity in a number of dif
ferent ways; but we realize the
futility of fully encompassing
faculty diversity in a sample so
small, and we would firmly re
ject the notion that the mem
bers so chosen be expected to
"represent" some character
istic (of gender, ethnicity, age,
or whatever) they might
possess. This applies to the stu
dent body, where the sample is
necessarily an even smaller
proportion of the universe.

Your own letter clearly il
lustrates the difficulties into
which this approach propels
one. You claim to find it "of
fensive" that in the sample of
two students chosen by their
positions no woman is included.
But in tact it is impossible to
"represent" a large universe
with a pair of persons, and not
neglect to represent some
important dimension of the di
versity of that population. I also
disagree with the underlying as
sumption. that a person lacking
a part\cu\ar characteristic or
interest cannot possibly speak
effectively for it.
Now let me turn to the matter
of the selections themselves.
You say, "It is totally un
persuasive that the students
were chosen in accordance with
tradition.' " I am a bit per
plexed by the use of the word
"unpersuasive," since I cer
tainly never tried to persuade
you or anyone that tradition was
the basis of that choice. Since
you bring the subject up, how
ever, let me point out that the
custom is actually two searches
old, not one: the Committee ap
pointed in '970 had two office
holders (in that case the Presi
dent and Vice President of the
Student Law Association).
But that is really beside the
point: I did not select the Presi
dent of the Stanford Law Re
view because of any tradition,
but instead because I thought it
a good idea. The processes that
produced the selection of those
two Presidents augur well tor
the likelihood that they will
make a contribution to the work
of the Committee.
To summarize: the students

whom I have named to the Com
mittee are likely, by virtue of
their individual abilities and
their mode of selection, to give
the Committee an enlarged per
spective and valuable help in its
work. I do not consider them as
having the obligation to "repre
sent" the full range of views
present in the Law School stu
dent body. I believe such repre
sentation is quite impossible,
and in any event I do not think it
is desirable; we are not creating
a legislature. As to the ade
quacy ot student participation
and the openness of the selec
tion process, I do not — for rea
sons I've given above — find my
self in agreement with your
argument. I do encourage you,
however, to use whatever
means you choose to make all of
the Committee's members —
students and faculty alike —
aware ot the full range ot con
cerns among Law students, and
of the ways in which you think
the Committee's work should
attempt to meet them. I shall
urge the Committee and the
Provost to attend carefully to
your representations.

Insult to injury
If a student at Stanford Uni
versity gets injured on campus
he receives the top medical at
tention available, right?
Wrong! What he does receive is
a trip to Cowell Student Health
Center. If he is unlucky enough
to be injured right after "regu
lar hours" he is met by a curt re
ceptionist that tersely asks why
he did not come sooner. Then af

ter a few moments of resistance
he is allowed to enter the center
where he is met by another bat
tery of questions offered in a
rather cold and certainly not
comforting atmosphere.
The individual, in this
case who had received a series
of cuts and bruises from a bike
accident, is lectured for 20
minutes on how to bandage his
own wounds rather than the
nurse taking the five minutes to
do it herself. The nurse not only
provided no real treatment but
also was about as comtorting as
Idi Amin. Now maybe I'm
wrong, but I kind of thought that
when I pay Stanford University
well over ten thousand a year I
could expect a little bit better
treatment from the health cen
ter that exists for the students.
This is also not an isolated in
cident I am told. Four friends of
mine, each arriving at different
times, explain that they re
ceived similar cold, im
personal, and on a whole un
helpful attention. I must say
that from the minute I left Cow
ell I was fuming. There is some
thing totally infuriating about
inadequate medical care in a
place that constantly performs
operations and treatment of
world renowned quality and
complexity. I am certainly in
terested in Cowell's response
and perhaps excuse. I merely
felt this was a time to speak out,
and to those who might by mis
fortune become inured perhaps
the worst part of your ordeal is
yet to come.

I've read the argument

In the first place. I think I

partments to invite students to
serve on such committees, in
about 1967, and I have been an
