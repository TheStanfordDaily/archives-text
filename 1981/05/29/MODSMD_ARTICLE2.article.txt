# Gloomy job outlook for liberal arts graduates
## 
### Teresa Butzerin 
In comparison to an almost full-ern
ployment outlook for engineers and
science majors, nationwide place
ment statistics for liberal arts gradu
ates look grim.
According to a National Science
Foundation Report on employment
opportunities for recent grads, 80 to 90
percent of math-science and engineer
ing majors secured jobs within their
fields of study, compared to a 10 per
cent placement rate for social science
graduates.
The Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) reports that the
fields of banking and finance account
tor 20 percent of new jobs acquired by
students and alumni using CPPC ser
vices. Miscellaneous business jobs in
volving management, marketing, and
sales also provide positions for many
registered with the office
More than 570 students and alumni
registered last year with the liberal
arts section of the CPPC. Only 291 se
cured jobs through the service, while
100 went on to graduate school. (120
tailed to respond to CPPC queries.)
$22,000 a year
Starting salaries for engineers and
science majors are typically above
$22,000 a year. In recent years, the de
mand for bachelor's degree engineer
ing graduates has actually diverted
many students from pursuing ad
vanced engineering degrees
By contrast, many graduate stu

dents in liberal arts face the uncer
tainty of a barren market for pro
fessorships. Rather than enter the
private sector, some graduates accept
menial or low-paying jobs far beneath
their academic training.
High salaries not for everybody ,
But high salaries don't .suit ev
eryone's standards of security. What
I'm looking for now is outside involve
ment, and enough money and time to
keep my writing going." said
Jonathan Cohen, a Wallace Stegner
Creative Writing Fellow at Stanford.
Cohen said his present job, deliver
ing pizzas, suffices, but he has secured
a job teaching Freshman English at
San Jose State University next year.
"Oh sure they're times when I just
wonder, Why didn't I study computer
programming 9 '," Cohen said, "But I
know this is really what I want to be
doing."
Cohen said he didn't consider voca
tional training, except in teaching, in
college.
Teaching jobs scarce
But teaching jobs, popular with
many students who find comfort in an
academic environment, are scarce
and the competition tremendous. Re
flecting a nationwide trend, student
placement in education through the
CPPC fell from 166 to 46 last year.
Even on the elementary and secon
dary school level, the market is tight,
but in recent years it has eased slight

ly. and a shortage ol teachers by the
mid-1980s is anticipated.
Math jobs available
The insatiable demand for math and
science specialists has lured most col
lege graduates from those fields into
the security of the private sector,
where salaries and opportunities tor
advancement make teaching less ap
pealing.
As a result, liberal arts majors who
have sufficient math background to
teach secondary school students, may
find math teaching jobs available.
Jean Duddy, a senior graduating
this year in psychology, hopes to be

teaching math and Spanish at a Chris
tian school in San Bruno next year. Al
though she took only one math class
while at Stanford, Duddy expects her
job to draw upon other skills she ac
quired through her liberal arts educa
tion.
'' When I began with psychology I in
tended to pursue it further pro
fessionally, but now I just feel it will
help me in everyday life, especially
counseling and understanding the
kids," Duddy said.
Although teaching compensation is
not comparable to some more lucra
tive jobs in the private sector, money
is not the main concern for some grad
uates, who don't regard high salaries
as ultimate indicators of security.
"I've grown up around and been ex
posed to many people who have had a
lot of money, and I know that it doesn't
give you what it takes to live a happy
life. I don't mean it's bad or makes
people unhappy, just that there's

something else that has a lot more
meaning,'' Duddy said.
The problem of underemployment,
therefore, is not entirely explained by
statistics. Lower salaries, and careers
outside their major field of studies
may confront graduating students
who don't choose to go to graduate
school. Long-term success, however,
depends on much more.
"You've really got to make your
own breaks," said Shirin Nivin, a
biology major, who graduated last
quarter and is now working at a
caterer 's shop. Nivin said she was con
tent with her job and didn't expect to
find a job suited for her qualifications.
"It really doesn't matter what you
start out doing if you really know what
you want to work for. Maybe the first
job people have isn't everything they
want out of lite, but if you do know
what's good for you, when the op
portunities come, you can make your
own way," Nivin said.
