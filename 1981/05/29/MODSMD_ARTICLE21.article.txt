## Transfer expectations often unfulfilled 
### 
Transfer students are a
unique breed. Not only do they
not fit in linguistically, but they
are surrounded by a personal
mystique. Affixed to this mys
tique are various rumors and
perceptions about the transfer
student. Some no doubt are true
but others are based on
fallacious grounds. Hence after
a year at Stanford some re
flections from a transfer are in
order.
Two questions are invariably

posed to transfers: why do stu
dents transfer and how does
Stanford compare with other
schools?
The answers to the former
question are as varied as those
tor why students originally
came to the University, such as:
the sun, California, the name, or
their parents went here. In addi
tion, some students transfer be
cause they were denied ad
mission as a freshman appli
cant.
Many people believe this
means the student was not
"smart enough" to get in as a
freshman. This is obviously
false. Since statistically it is
more difficult to gain accep
tance as a transfer, it implies
that the student became
"smarter" at the other school.
Perhaps a superior inference
is that the acceptance of a stu
dent who was originally denied
admission is an acknowl
edgement by the admissions of
tice that they make mistakes in
their evaluations — both in
whom they deny and accept.
-'The second question, "How
does Stanford compare with oth
er schools," is more difficult to
generalize because of the di
verse schools from which stu
dents transfer. Nonetheless,
several comparisons can be
made.
The most striking com
parison is the quality of the fac
ulty. The faculty here, like the
band, is truly incomparable. At
smaller or lesser known schootts
the faculty is often good, but,.in
general, teaches theories of oth
er people such as Stanford pro
fessors.
Here there is a feeling that
real intellectual achievements
are being made by the faculty.
Using books written by your
professor is not only a good
means to additional subsidies
for the professor; it is also a tes
timony of the level of excellence
the professor has attained.
And, surprisingly, the popu
lar and experienced professors
are eager to teach under
graduates. I was warned that
my classes would be large and
my professors would be either
graduate students or beginning

professors. This has proven to
be undeniably false. Most of the
professors here are accessible
to undergraduates.
Another change I encoun
tered here was the use of TAs.
TAs were a novelty which I ap
proached with considerable
trepidation. However, the TAs
and discussion sections here are
both excellent and valuable. The
only negative aspect is that too
tew students take advantage of
the sections.
Another positive comparison
is the vast opportunities that ex
ist outside the classroom. The
University is a world unto itself,
and the various organizations
and never-ending political func
tions provide a wealth of op
portunity for almost any in
terest. This is something that is
simply not available at smaller
schools.
Finally, the Academic In
formation Center, Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, and
Overseas Studies Center offer
invaluable assistance for pro
curing the most from one's
education. Unfortunately, the
benefits of these groups are
more than balanced by housing.
When one turns to the stu
dents here, the comparison be
comes both perplexing and often
disappointing. Upon trans
ferring one expects a superior
student body avidly dedicated to
pursuing realms of intellectual
curiosity. After all, everyone is
aware how difficult it is to get
into Stanford.
But after several months here
— especially in the spring — one
discovers that intellectual
curiosity is quickly replaced by
an obsession with the sun. Stu
dents in fervent pursuit of the
Caltornia tan "blow off" classes
and reading, and rely instead on
lecture notes or divine fortuna.
Perhaps the most enigmatic
comparison is the students' lan
guage and dress. My previous
school was a school not at all far
from Stanford. However, it took
me three months to decipher the
peculiar language here, and
only recently was I able to dist
inguish between "banging it"
and "blowing it off."
Similarly, at the other school

girls did not wear shorts to their
knees, and guys who had never
seen a boat did not wear top
siders. The phenomena of wear
ing a sweater with shorts is also
a new sight. I suppose this
ensures that one is always halt
correct in attire regardless ot
the weather.
Inside the classroom the at
mosphere is also contrary to
what is expected. Many stu
dents are unstimulated and the
"just getting by" syndrome
plagues "one of the best schools
in the country" to the same ex
tent as other schools.
The vision of brilliant stu
dents rushing to the library is a
parental image. The true irony
is that the students' potential,
which is obviously profound, is
rarely realized.
One of the problems students
encounter is that they must try
so hard to fit the Stanford im
age. This means those who
study are nerds, those who care
about grades are too com
petitive, and those who need to
go to class are dumb.
Students need a cushion from
failure, and they find it in a lack
adaisical attitude which is in
tended to imply that they are too
smart to care. Unfortunately,
the tacit social pressure often
creates an unhealthy environ
ment for intellectual curiosity.
The problems mentioned are
certainly not unique to Stanford
nor applicable to all the stu
dents. Rather, they are both
problems that one is surprised
to find more evident here than
at many other schools.
Overall, like most transfers, I
am glad I transferred. The Uni
versity offers a great ex
perience; however, Stanford's
potential is not being ac
tualized. Too many students
come here for the wrong rea
sons and remain to graduate be
cause there is nothing better to
do.
Stanford is indeed an ex
cellent school. It could'be bet
ter, but then, what would I have
to complain about?

tor why students originally
came to the University, such as:
the sun, California, the name, or
their parents went here. In addi
tion, some students transfer be
cause they were denied ad
mission as a freshman appli
cant.
Many people believe this
means the student was not
"smart enough" to get in as a
freshman. This is obviously
false. Since statistically it is
more difficult to gain accep
tance as a transfer, it implies
that the student became
"smarter" at the other school.
Perhaps a superior inference
is that the acceptance of a stu
dent who was originally denied
admission is an acknowl
edgement by the admissions of
tice that they make mistakes in
their evaluations — both in
whom they deny and accept.
-'The second question, "How
does Stanford compare with oth
er schools," is more difficult to
generalize because of the di
verse schools from which stu
dents transfer. Nonetheless,
several comparisons can be
made.
The most striking com
parison is the quality of the fac
ulty. The faculty here, like the
band, is truly incomparable. At
smaller or lesser known schootts
the faculty is often good, but,.in
general, teaches theories of oth
er people such as Stanford pro
fessors.
Here there is a feeling that
real intellectual achievements
are being made by the faculty.
Using books written by your
professor is not only a good
means to additional subsidies
for the professor; it is also a tes
timony of the level of excellence
the professor has attained.
And, surprisingly, the popu
lar and experienced professors
are eager to teach under
graduates. I was warned that
my classes would be large and
my professors would be either
graduate students or beginning

professors. This has proven to
be undeniably false. Most of the
professors here are accessible
to undergraduates.
Another change I encoun
tered here was the use of TAs.
TAs were a novelty which I ap
proached with considerable
trepidation. However, the TAs
and discussion sections here are
both excellent and valuable. The
only negative aspect is that too
tew students take advantage of
the sections.
Another positive comparison
is the vast opportunities that ex
ist outside the classroom. The
University is a world unto itself,
and the various organizations
and never-ending political func
tions provide a wealth of op
portunity for almost any in
terest. This is something that is
simply not available at smaller
schools.
Finally, the Academic In
formation Center, Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, and
Overseas Studies Center offer
invaluable assistance for pro
curing the most from one's
education. Unfortunately, the
benefits of these groups are
more than balanced by housing.
When one turns to the stu
dents here, the comparison be
comes both perplexing and often
disappointing. Upon trans
ferring one expects a superior
student body avidly dedicated to
pursuing realms of intellectual
curiosity. After all, everyone is
aware how difficult it is to get
into Stanford.
But after several months here
— especially in the spring — one
discovers that intellectual
curiosity is quickly replaced by
an obsession with the sun. Stu
dents in fervent pursuit of the
Caltornia tan "blow off" classes
and reading, and rely instead on
lecture notes or divine fortuna.
Perhaps the most enigmatic
comparison is the students' lan
guage and dress. My previous
school was a school not at all far
from Stanford. However, it took
me three months to decipher the
peculiar language here, and
only recently was I able to dist
inguish between "banging it"
and "blowing it off."
Similarly, at the other school

girls did not wear shorts to their
knees, and guys who had never
seen a boat did not wear top
siders. The phenomena of wear
ing a sweater with shorts is also
a new sight. I suppose this
ensures that one is always halt
correct in attire regardless ot
the weather.
Inside the classroom the at
mosphere is also contrary to
what is expected. Many stu
dents are unstimulated and the
"just getting by" syndrome
plagues "one of the best schools
in the country" to the same ex
tent as other schools.
The vision of brilliant stu
dents rushing to the library is a
parental image. The true irony
is that the students' potential,
which is obviously profound, is
rarely realized.
One of the problems students
encounter is that they must try
so hard to fit the Stanford im
age. This means those who
study are nerds, those who care
about grades are too com
petitive, and those who need to
go to class are dumb.
Students need a cushion from
failure, and they find it in a lack
adaisical attitude which is in
tended to imply that they are too
smart to care. Unfortunately,
the tacit social pressure often
creates an unhealthy environ
ment for intellectual curiosity.
The problems mentioned are
certainly not unique to Stanford
nor applicable to all the stu
dents. Rather, they are both
problems that one is surprised
to find more evident here than
at many other schools.
Overall, like most transfers, I
am glad I transferred. The Uni
versity offers a great ex
perience; however, Stanford's
potential is not being ac
tualized. Too many students
come here for the wrong rea
sons and remain to graduate be
cause there is nothing better to
do.
Stanford is indeed an ex
cellent school. It could'be bet
ter, but then, what would I have
to complain about?

Transfer students are a
unique breed. Not only do they
not fit in linguistically, but they
are surrounded by a personal
mystique. Affixed to this mys
tique are various rumors and
perceptions about the transfer
student. Some no doubt are true
but others are based on
fallacious grounds. Hence after
a year at Stanford some re
flections from a transfer are in
