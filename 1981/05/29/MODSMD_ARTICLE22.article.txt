## Ethnic theme houses encourage racial sensitivity 
### 
Though the ethnic theme houses are
among the most discussed residences,
the discussion has been one-sided and
misfocused for too long. In drawing at
tention to two recent examples of cul
tural ignorance we hope to set the ongo
ing debate over theme houses within the
contex of societal problems regarding
race, and by doing so to insure that
Zapata continues to confront issues of
race, class, and gender arising in society
and at the University.
The first case is the recent Daily col
umn about sore thumbs. Does anyone re
ally like or even understand the mural
(entitled, "A Response to Media Ra
cism") in Zapata's dining hall, the au
thors asked. Two of the authors are ma
jors in American studies; one lived in
Zapata tor a year. Their cultural ig
norance and arrogance is regrettable,
but no example could serve better to put
Zapata into a context of University and
societal insensitivity to race.
A decade ago, the ethnic theme houses
were bom of social problems that are
deeply ingrained in the U.S. The difficul
ty in maintaining a strong commitment
to cultural problems and cross-cultural
interaction at this institution is reflected
in Stanford's delays in integrating Third
World experiences into courses and re
quirements, in admissions and faculty
hiring statistics, in overseas program
options, and in the lack of a system-wide
treatment of racial issues in residences.

The American Studies major is one ex
ample of a white-majority view of the
world: for one thing, it excludes South
America; tor another, it seems possible
to slip through the curriculum with no
grounding in issues important to
Chicanos, the largest minority group in
the Western U.S.
The ethnic theme houses cannot be re
sponsible for addressing these errors of
omission, but they can and do create an
atmosphere where the delicate, ir
replaceable influence of race (as well as
gender and class) may be appreciated
and respected by open-minded students.
Many non-Chicano residents begin to see
that they have a personal stake in
eliminating racist attitudes because for
the first time they have friends who have
been victimized. Non-minority residents
may also begin to link racial oppression
to experiences they had had. Because
women's oppression is sometimes simi
lar to that of Chicanos, for example,
these issues are often raised in tandem.
Non-Chicanos can also learn to recognize
and respond to racist comments or at
titudes by gently but firmly setting oth
ers straight.
Of course, some students leave Zapata
without having participated in the many
rap groups, films, speakers, classes, sur
veys, and informal opportunities to in
teract offered in addition to the usual
symphony, party, and IM sports fare
here. The complaint that some non-mi
nority students are too busy to make the

most of their experiences in the house
suggests a low priority on learning from
people of color, and indeed, on people of
color themselves.
An invitation is extended in good faith
by the house for non-Chicano students to
take advantage of the resources here.
Happily, many do. It is the responsibility
of students, like the authors of the col
umn, to avoid racially insensitive
statements, like the characterization of
the mural.
The second case is the memo
circulated by Dean James Lyons and
quoted in the Daily's three part series
last week. Part of the quoted comment
involved complaints from non-minority
students about Casa Zapata's tensions.
But tension is a loaded term: any serious
discussion of societal problems — like
racism, sexism, or poverty — is likely to
provoke anxiety and tension. The feel
ings of individuals must be understood in
terms of society's treatment of racial is
sues. Naturally, some people will be un
comfortable with strong expressions of
emotion or heated arguments. But does
one assume that non-discussion leads to
a tension-free community? The issues
are deep, complex, and explosive — and
tor that, all the more in need of airing.
The Zapata staff works to provide an at
mosphere and a context in which to dis
cuss feelings and views in the house.
Even students in the house who feel
tension add important qualifiers: ten

sion is primarily between those who ask
to live here and those who do not; be
tween those who support the theme with
energy and allocations of their house
dues and those who do not. Disagree
ments are aired regularly, in public and
private, in structured and nonstructured
situations, and many residents agree
that Zapata is one ot the tew places at
Stanford where real discussion of values
and priorities may occur. Further, the
investment of feelings allows people to
learn from, rather than about, each oth
er. To see an emotionally heated dis
cussion as problematic is to totally miss
the point of talking: people must be free
to examine their assumptions, with help
from other, if they are to change them.
Zapata fosters an environment where
all students are encouraged to see racial
differences, to take these differences se
riously, and to appreciate the diversity
among human beings. Rather than fram
ing the issues negatively or defensively,
we are proud to be working towards a
framework for a deeper understanding
of race. Such an understanding is pos
sible only after years of listening, ques
tioning, and sharing. Indeed, many stu
dents of all backgrounds who feel a little
uneasy at Zapata come back two, three,
or seven years later to say that questions
they first heard being asked here have
become important to their work and self
awareness.
