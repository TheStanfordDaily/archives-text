## ITC to investigate tobacco imports 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Two days before he left of
fice, President Jimmy Carter did afavor for
a political friend from North Carolina who
was having trouble with the state's per
snickety Republican senator, Jesse Helms.
At the behest of his pal, Gov. James Hunt,
and against the advice of trade experts at
the Department of Agriculture, Carter
asked the International Trade Commission
(ITC) to look at the tobacco import situ
ation.
Six months later, the Hunt-Helms byplay
has expanded into what no one on Tobacco
Road apparently really wanted or counted
on — a full-dress review by the ITC of the
federal price support program for tobacco.
The ITC probe could tangle the Reagan
administration in a sticky flap with nervous
U.S. trading partners, who already are
whispsring of retaliation if the United
States curbs tobacco imports.
One-upmanship >
Back in January, it seemed like a clever
bit of political one-upmanship. Helms had
been hacking away at Carter, Hunt and
thep-«Sen. Robert Morgan, blaming thenVfor
what he regarded as improperly low tariffs
placed on tobacco imports by the U.S. Cus
toms Service.
Thus, Carter's request for an ITC probe
could somewhat dull the edge of Helms'
complaints and allow Democrat Hunt, re
garded by many as a challenger to Helms in
1984, to score points with North Carolina
tobacco growers disgruntled with imports.
North Carolina is the largest producer of
flue-cured tobacco, the principal compo
nent of cigarettes. The state's crop pro
duces cash receipts of more than $1 billion
yearly.
Helms, now chairman of the Senate Agri
culture Committee, has not let up the pres
sure. He reportedly has reiterated his views

on tobacco taritfs to the administration and
has left a clear impression that he will
closely review names of Treasury appoin
tees who will be in a position to make tariff
decisions.
Higher duties
George Dunlop, the senator's chief tobac
co adviser, said he has "visited"' recently
with possible Reagan nominees to head the
Customs Service, seeking to push the case
for higher duties on foreign leaf.
Key Treasury officials will be the cus
toms commissioner — not yet named — and
the assistant secretary for enforcement.
The White House ct\oice for that job is New
York attorney John Walker, a first cousin of
Vice President George Bush.
Walker's selection was announced May '3
after weeks of delay resulting from ques
tions raised by the National Rifle Associa
tion. Walker declined to discuss his nomi
nation, but said no one had ever suggested
he should have a predetermined position on
the tobacco tariff question.
As this goes on, the ITC is preparing to be
gin hearings here June 24, as part of its
Carter-requested investigation, to de
termine if imports are impairing the con
troversial price-support program.
ITC alternatives
The ITC could hold that there is no harm
to the program. Or it could recommend lim
its atfi imports, a move that could put the
free-trade politics of Reagan to a quick test.
The president could support or reject the
ITC findings.
The proceedings hold the potential for
giving critics of the price-support program
a rare chance to spotlight the system of fed
erally backed acreage allotments and mar
ket controls they find so objectionable.
Agriculture Secretary John Block, in a
February letter to Hunt, outlined the peril
to tobacco advocates if they continued to

push for the ITC investigation, asking if the
governor was prepared to bear the possible
consequences.
He noted that Helms, too, had supported
an ITC probe of imports and had discussed
the question "on many occasions" with
Reagan.
"Are you confident that public hearings
. . . would not result in legislative reaction
that would be adverse to the interests of
tobacco producers in your and other
states?" Block asked Hunt. The governor
never responded to Block's letter.
Political ambush
Helms, sensitive to a political ambush,
now says he supports the ITC investigation
only because his state's farmers, principal
ly the North Carolina Farm Bureau, want it.
Helms and other tobacco-state legisla
tors over the years have successfully
thwarted challenges to the support pro
gram, although their strength may be wan
ing. A recent effort by Sen. Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio) to cut federal tobacco out
lays drew 42 supporters and could have suc
ceeded with a change in eight votes.
So at a time when the critics seem to be
picking up ground, the ITC forum gives
them an unusual new opportunity. To de
termine the impact of imports, the ITC will
have to examine closely the price-support
program.
The program has had problems for a vari
ety of reasons in the last several years, with
increasing amounts ot low-grade flue-cured
tobacco finding their way into government
warehouses because of poor marketability.
Increasing government stocks have given
rise to a fear that the program soon may
find itself in serious economic difficulty.
The quick reaction among growers has
been to blame lower-priced imports and
tariffs — which Helms and others say §re
unreasonably low — for their problem. s *
