# Reagan calls for new increases in military salaries, spending
## 
### Washington Post 
West Point, N.Y. — President Ronald Rea
gan Wednesday promised the U.S. Military
Academy's graduating class higher military
pay and increased spending on military hard
ware in a commencement address studded
with declarations that America is experienc
ing a spiritual revival.
For the first time, Reagan indicated that he
tavors selective pay increases for the military,
and he made no mention of the scheduled 5.3
percent July military pay raise, which he ap
parently is willing to see deterred until Octo
ber.
Although Reagan supported the July ' pay
rise, it was voted down by the House and there
is no indication that the White house intends to
tight tor it. As a result, it is most likely to be
postponed until October when it would be
added to the 9.' percent raise scheduled to take
effect then. The delay would help Reagan re
duce this year's budget deficit.
Advocates of selective pay increases have
argued that they would help the military keep
people with the most needed skills at less cost
than the customary across-the-board raises.
Reagan said such plans are being studied.
New spirit
Turning to what has become one of the domi
nant themes of his presidency, Reagan said
there is a new spirit on the move in the United
States. "The era of self-doubt is over. We've
stopped looking at our warts and rediscovered
how much there is to love in this blessed land,"
he said.
"There is a spiritual revival going on, a hun
ger to be once again proud ot America, all that
it is and all that it can be','' the president told
the 906 cadets of the academy's 183 rd gradu
ating class in Michie Stadium.
In his second speech outside Washington
since he was wounded by a would-be assassin's
bullet March 30, Reagan referred to the recent
past as a time when the military was subjected
to a "lack of respect for the uniform."
Attacks critics
Reagan attacked critics of the military,

saying, "Those shrill voices that would have us
believe the defenders of our nation are some
how the enemies of peace are as false as they
are shrill." \
The president also reiterated his opposition
to the draft. Instead of a draft, Reagan said he
favors increasing pay and other benefits to
make military careers more attractive.
"Last year's pay increase was a step in the
right direction, but we are asking for another
in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1," he said
"We are studying proposals for a merit pay •
system and increased flexibility in personnel
practices."
Collection of cliches
Except tor his general promise of White
House support tor the military, Reagan's
speech was a collection of observations,
cliches, jokes and praise for the traditions of
West Point and its "long gray line."
The president and his senior advisers at one
time considered delivering a major foreign
policy speech here, but apparently felt the tim
ing for such an address was not right.
Wednesday's speech and his address at the
Notre Dame commencement 0 days ago,
largely devoted to nostalgia over his ex
perience playing the role of Notre Dame foot
ball star George Gipp, were the first speeches
Reagan has given since Ken Khachigian, his
principal speech writer in the final stage ot the
presidential campaign and first months ot his
presidency, left the White House staff. The
chief speech-writing job is now vacant.
Although Reagan spoke at length about Gipp
at Notre Dame, he made no mention Wednes
day of the famous West Point graduate he
portrayed in the 1940 movie Santa Fe Trail.
Reagan was cast as the young George Custer
who was still years away from death at the Lit
tle Big Horn and not long out of the academy
where he had graduated last in the class of
186 .
On a warm, overcast morning, the president
was applauded enthusiastically by a crowd of
about 26,000, including the 4109-member cadet
corps, their families and guests.
