## 
### Sally Jenkins 
The dark horses came out of the woodwork yesterday in the
second round of the NCAA golf tournament. Names like the
University of New Mexico, Georgia, Purdue, and Texas A&M
kept showing up on the leader board while defending cham
pion Oklahoma State was seldom seen or heard from.
Brigham Young's name at the top of the list halfway
through the tournament was not all that surprising, but the
manner in which the Cougars got there snapped a tew heads
around. They posted a team score of 574, coming from eight
strokes back to overtake first round leader Oral Roberts Uni
versity.
It was all courtesy of a couple of guys named Richard Zokol
and Rick Fehr, names that weren't likely to stand out in any
one's program prior to the tournament, since they are com
peting with the likes of defending individual champion Jay
Don Blake of Utah State, and Joe Rasset of Oral Roberts.
All Fehr did was post a 69 yesterday to put himself in a tie
for third place with Rasset and Stuart Smith of Tennessee. He
shot a one-over-par 72 Wednesday, which had placed him in a
13-way tie tor fifth.
All Zokol did was set the course ablaze, firing oft five
straight birdies on holes ' 2 through 16 for a 66 on the 6835-yard
Stanford golf course. Combined with his first round 76, the
score moved him from nowhere to fifth place, and the
Cougars from sixth into a five stroke lead.

Texas A&M followed up BYU with rounds of 293-286. a 579

total moving them up two places from fourth after Wednes
day's play.
Oral Roberts dropped to a tie with Houston (289-29', third
place both days) for third at 580 with scores of 286-294.
Pacific-10 champion Arizona State also maintained a solid
grip on fourth place with 298-293, .led by individual Pac-10
champs Dan Forsman and Tony Grimes. i r
Stanford turned in rounds ot 309-294 to move from'26th to a
tie for 25th at 603. USC is presently tied for 12th at 592
(300-292) with Oklahoma State < 297-2951. moving up from
15th.
In the individual tournament, Rick Dalpos ot Purdue
moved into the lead by posting his second consecutive 69 with
seven birdies, three bogies, and one double-bogie. "It was a
lot different than yesterday,"he said of the round, also refer
ring to the first 69 which included only three birdies.
Dalpos overtook Rasset, who slipped with a 75 after turning
in a tournament-leading 66 Wednesday. Things did not go well
from the first, when he double-bogied the first hole, only to
bogie the second.
The tournament favorite, Blake, who has been experienc
ing back problems since Tuesday when he strained a muscle,
moved frorp third to second as he matched Dalpos' 69 (70-69,
139). Blake has been working with Stanford trainers through
out the tournament to try and relieve his back pain
Zokol is tied with Fresno State's surprise, Ed Luetnke, who
also posted a 69 after a first round of 73.

ford golf course. Games, however, is not having as good of fortune on the*same course for the NCAA's,
having shot opening rounds of 78.-73 the last two days to put him towards the back of the pack.
