# Pro baseball strike postponed

New York (AP) — Baseball's threatened
mid-season strike has been delayed for at
least one week following an agreement yes
terday by representatives of the players and
the owners to extend a June 1 walkout dead
line in the collective bargaining agreement.
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Werker,
who agreed to the extension, said he will lis
ten next week in Rochester, N.Y. to a Na
tional Labor Relations Board petition for an
injunction.
If the injunction is granted in the lan
guage requested, it would put the entire free
agency compensation issue — and presum
ably any threat of a strike — on hold for one
year.
The NLR& request petitions for an in
junction which would rescind the con
troversial compensation proposal unilat
erally implemented by the owners last Feb
ruary, and allow management the option ot
adopting the clause next February instead.

In addition, it would allow the union to re
open the basic agreement on this issue and
call a strike by June 1,1982.
Those are virtually the same groijyid rules
the two sides agreed to last year, preventing
a strike at that time but leading eventually
to the current crisis.
The decision averting the strike came
just hours before the strike would have
begun. The players had to begin a strike
betore June 1 it they did not want to accept
the owners' position on tree agency. The
players had decided they would walk out af
ter yesterdays' games.
The agreement by the negotiators to ex
tend the strike deadline was required* to
keep them playing without accepting the
owners' compensation clause.
NLRB regional director Daniel Silver
man spent some 7V2 hours in conference,
with Marvin Miller, executive director 0!
the Major League Players Association, and

Ray Grebey, chief negotiator for man
agement before announcing that the parties
would file a petition for a preliminary in
junction and ask for a hearing date.
That plan ran afoul of Judge Werker, how
ever, when he informed Silverman that he
was going to Rochester on Monday for two
weeks.
Judge Werker said he would hold a hear
ing in Rochester next Wednesday, June 3,
and said he would have to work the baseball
case into his schedule around the criminal
cases.
As part of the agreement, Judge Werker
promised a speedy decision, within 48 hours
of the conclusion of the hearing. The union
agreed that it would not call any strike for at
least 24 hours after Werker handed down his
decision but if there were to be one it would
have to be called within 48 hours after the
judge's ruling.
