# Angels give manager Fregosi the pink slip
## 
### 
Anaheim, Calif. (AP) — The
California Angels fired Jim
Fregosi as manager yesterday
and replaced their former star
player with veteran skipper
Gene Mauch.
Mauch, former manager ot
the Philadelphia Phillies, Mont
real Expos and Minnesota
Twins, had joined the Angels
this year as director of player
personnel.
Fregosi,' who played short
stop for the Angels, was in his
third year as manager. He was
named in June, 978, and
reached the playoffs in 1979.
They sagged to sixth with a
65-95 record last season, and
were just 22-25 this campaign.

Fregosi has been under fire
after owner Gene Autry spent
millions in acquiring players.
"Jimmy has been a friend ot
mine for years." Autry said.
"However, we have to think of
the best interests of the club and
tor this reason, we think a
change is necessary."
The Angels had just con
cluded a home stand, losing five
ot six games, and had lost seven
of its last nine.
Mauch. who has spent the
past 37 years in uniform as
player, coach or manager,
ranks Oth on the all-time man
agerial list. In 21 years, his
teams have won 524 victories
but his clubs never won a pen

nant or a divisional cham
pionship.
Fregosi commented, "I'm
thankful for the opportunity that
Gene and Buzzie Bavasi gave
me to manage over the last
three years. I just wish the team
had played better. I think
they're an outstanding group of
men and I wish all ot them the
best of luck the rest ot the sea
son."
Fregosi's playing career
spanned 18 years and he still is
the holder of Angels' records in
r 0 offensive categories.
He earned All-Star recogni
tion six times.

When it was rumored earlier
in the season that the former
shortstop was on his way out as
manager, Autry wondered out
loud if Fregosi inspired his
players. Then the Angels went
on a winning streak and the
manager stayed until this final
decision was reached.
Mauch didn't have the playing
record of Fregosi. He started
his professional career as a
shortstop with the Brooklyn
Dodgers and also played for the
Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago
Cubs, Boston Braves, St. Louis

Cardinals and Boston Red Sox
from 944-57.
Autry, the former singing
cowboy, has frequently gone to
the free agent ranks to sign top
p\ayers at high salaries in look
ing for a championship that nev
er has arrived.
Fregosi had an overall man
agerial record with the Angels
of 237-248, the second highest
number of victories among the
eight previous managers. Bill
Rigney, the original pilot of the
club, was 625-707 for years.
