Paris (AP) — Bjorn Borg
made the third round of the
French Open tennis cham
pionships in the nick of time
Thursday, just before rain
flooded the red clay courts of
Roland Garros Stadium.
The Swede, favored to win the
title for the sixth straight year,
swept past Cassio Motta of Bra
zil 6-1, 7-5, 6-2. He did not seem
to be affected by the shoulder in
jury that kept him from playing
tennis for six weeks before this
tournament.
Only two other men beat the
weather and reached the third

round — Wojtek Fibak, the 14th
seed, and an unlikely
Frenchman named Paul Torre,
a survivor from the qualifying
competition.
