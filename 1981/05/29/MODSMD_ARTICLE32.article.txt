•With its neon orange and black cover, The Die
Song: ■Journey into the Mind of a Mass Murderer.
a recently published book by forensic psychiatrist
Donald Lunde and co-author Jefferson Morgan,
catches one's attention immediately. And that's
just what Donald Lunde wants.
The book focuses on the case of Herbert Mullin,
a young man in his early 20s, who terrified Santa
Cruz and its environs for a four-month period in
the early 9705, when he went on a murder ram
page. By the time he was caught, Mullin had
murdered 13 innocent people, including a popular
Roman Catholic priest, a mother and her two
sons, and an old high school friend.

• 'Working for the defense. Dr. Lunde managed to
piece together Mullin's life prior to the murders
Between the time Mullin graduated from high
school and the time the murders were committed,
the young man changed from a promising student
to a college drop-out who frequented the boarding
houses of San Francisco's Tenderloin district. Un
able to keep a job, and more and more frequently
Wsing contact with reality, Mullin was hospi
talized five times in state mental institutions.
Diagnosis: Paranoid Schizophrenic. Progno
sis: Ro or.
It was at this time that the administration, un-
then-Governor Reagan, began cutting back
funds to the mental heaKh institutions of the state.
As a result, most ot them closed down Does a pic

ture begin to emerge?
Mullin's family was aware that he was in se
vere need of help, but when they took him to Men
docino State Hospital, where he was normally
treated, they tound it was about to closfe and that
he couldn't be admitted. They were financially un
able to send him to a private institution and they
had nowhere else to turn. Mullin continued to walk
the streets.enable to get help.
He was clearly crazy. Declaring that his
motivation to murder came from"the die song,"
which told him to kill in order to prevent a hiajor
earthquake, the defense pleaded innocent by rea
son ot insanity.
Despite overwhelming evidence to the con
trary, the jury found him guilty and therefore
sane. According to Lunde. the jury didn't credit
the insanffv plea, because they didn't want to
commit Mullin to the state mental system that
had tailed him before. They wanted him in prison
where he couldn't get out, and where, by the way,
he couldn't receive treatment for his condition.
Although he was judged sane bV the court, the
jury telt otherwise outside the courtroom. Soon
after the trial, jury foreman Kenneth Springer
wrote an open letter to Governor Reagan saying,
"I hold the state executive and state legislative
offices as responsible for these '3 lives as I do the
defendant himselt — none of this need ever have
happened."
The Die Song is a factual book, but it leaves no
doubt in the mind of the reader that all the horror
could have been avoided. Lunde should gain some
support for what has been termed his "one-man
crusade" once this book has been in circulation a
while.
