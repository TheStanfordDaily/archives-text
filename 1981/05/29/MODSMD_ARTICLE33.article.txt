In 1975, Joe McGinniss, the
author of The Selling of the
President, decided to go to Alas
ka and experience America's
"last frontier." The result of
the next two years' roamings
across the largest state in the
union is Going to Extremes, a
very personal view of Alaska.
TTie best thing about Going to
Extremes is the fortunate coin
cidence which landed McGin
niss in the state just as the oil
pipeline began to tlood Alaska
with money. McGinniss ob
served a frontier society leaping
directly into the world of corpo
rate oil, skipping the 200 or so
years generally required in be
tween. The wrenching changes
he witnessed in the mod
ernization ot Alaskan life make
tor fascinating reading.
Travelling from one end ot
the state to the other, from An
chorage, a city of 200,000 (halt
the entire population of the
state) to tiny villages with un
pronounceable names, McGin
niss observes and records what
he saw, heard, and telt with un
bridled curiosity and honesty.
He presents Alaska in all its
improbability; describing ev
erything from $2000-a-week oil
workers at Prudhoe Bay who
riot in the dining hall alter being
told that lobster and steak will
be served on alternate nights in
stead of both at the same meal,
to natives eating "Eskimo Ice

Cream - ' â€” a concoction of
whipped seal oil or Crisco laced
with "a particularly noxious
and bitter berry."
McGinniss' Alaska is a land
where, in the course of a single
generation, the Eskimos have
gone from hunting whales in
sealskin kayaks and running dog
sleds to staring gap-mouthed at
The Six Million Dollar Man and
racing on snowmobiles. In his
view an entire culture is van
ishing overnight as a result of
the oil money so many regard as
a boon.
Alaska is divided into two op
posing camps: developmental
and preservationist. McGinniss,
like most who come to the state
trom what Alaskans con
temptuously call "Outside," is
definitely lodged in the preser
vationist camp. He's repulsed
by the destruction of the native
cultures, the pride of the An
chorage Times in the state's
first McDonald's, and the on
mipresence of immense quan
tities of alcohol.
Most people trom Outside
with any appreciation for na
ture, particularly if they're
from an urban environment, are
like McGinniss in their re
vulsion at Alaska 's apparent ob
session with growth and de
velopment. Unfortunately,
McGinniss comes across as a bit
priggish and judgmental in his
evaluation of Alaskan life. As
one resident explains, "Well,
there's no radio in Valdez, very
little TV, and last winter we had
370 inches of snow. I mean, how

much can you drink?"
McGinniss seems blinded by
his vision of what the place
could be, and exhibits a surpris
ing lack of sensitivity towards
the people who've been rushed
into "modern times." His at
titudes towards the alcohol
wrecked Eskimos, the pro
liferation of rattle-trap, pre-fab
buildings and the rest of Alas
ka's ills and blights seem to
blame individuals, rather than
the society and economy which
have thrust this change onto the
land.
McGinniss is at his best in the
book's final chapter, an account
of a 4-day hike through a por
tion of the Brooks Range. The
most remote, and least explored
mountain range in North Ameri
ca, the Brooks Range lies en
tirely north of the Arctic Circle.
When McGinniss arrived in
Alaska he had never slept in a
sleeping bag; two years later he
was setting out with tour other
men into one of the wildest re
gions on the continent.
The Brooks Range fits
McGinniss' vision of what Alas
ka ought to be. In these remote
valleys he sees an Alaska un
touched, and probably even un
trodden, by man. He conveys
with extraordinary grace the
sense of insignificance one feels
among Alaskan mountains, as
well as the omnipresent trace of
fear you carry with you like a
spare pair ot socks. In Alaska
wilderness you don't screw up;
if you do there's a chance you're

dead. McGinniss is very much
aware of this constantly loom
ing danger, particularly after
the party's several harrowing
encounters with grizzly bears.
The problem with writing
about Alaska is that there are so
many "Alaskas," and so many
different ways of experiencing
them, that any one account is
necessarily idiosyncratic.
doing to Extremes, like John
McPhee's Coming into the
Country, is a first-rate
portrayal of one person's Alas
ka. Unfortunately, McGinniss'
or McPhee's Alaska may not be
the one you would have ex
perienced in their place.
Still, Going to Extremes is
fine for anyone who wants to vi
cariously sample our "last fron
tier" from a comfortable
armchair. It covers every re
gion of the state (though the
southeastern Panhandle is giv
en pretty short shrift), and its
portrayal of a society and a re
gion in flux is excellent. It's just
that, as the saying goes, "you
had to be there."
