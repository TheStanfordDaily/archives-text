A Hard Doy'i !\ught ■kit-kit
Century 21, San Jose
This one's worth the ride into
San Jose to see. It features the four
Beatles at a time when they were a
teenybopper phenomenon and
before they had become "respect
able " Richard Lester, straight
from directing television com
mercials, directed this one as it
the Beatles were another product
to sell: his genius was for recog
nizing that the commodity to be
sold was personality. The Beatles
might have been the most likeable
product ever to hit the shelves. .4
Hard Days Night would have to
be included on anyone's list of
great musicals. It takes musical
conventions, ties them into knots,
and then unwraps them again: this
is a musical that owes as much to
the newsreel as to Broadway.

It Came from It ithin kkk
Fox, Redwood City
"It" is a nasty parasite, blood
colored and about the size and tex
ture of a gefilte fish, that climbs
inside people and turns them into
sexual maniacs. David Cronen
berg (Scanners) directed this
almost unbelievably gruesome
thriller — there's so much blood
and gore here that it makes those
tacky driver's ed films look re
strained But Cronenberg, who
also wrote the script, isn't a hack;
he has a good time grossing us out,
and his fine, bloody humor shows
on the screen. He's got a knack for
economically defining character:
the crazy doctor who created the
parasites in the first place is de
scribed as being "not a very good
teacher, and not a very good re
searcher. But there's one thing
he's a genius at — getting grants."
If you can avoid throwing up,
there's an awful lot of good stuff
here.
Plays through Saturday with
Scanners.

Atlantic City k-kkk
Palo Alto Square
In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shut fled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on the
Boardwalk, the older buildings —
remnants of a past grandeur and a
more recent decay — tumble to the
ground. In the vision of director
Louis Malle and screenwriter John
Guare, the environmental trans
formation reflects the disorienting
change that has seized the lives of
the people of the city. Atlantic
City's people try with varying
degrees of success to cope with
this anomie. Somewhat surpris
ingly, Malle ends on an optimistic
note. It is possible, we see, for
some people to adjust to new con
ditions and to make a new life out
of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives.
The film features fine per
formances by Burt Lancaster,
Susan Sarandon. and Kate Reid.

U izards k
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Animator Ralph Bakshi's
cynicism is exceeded only by his
utter lack of taste This is an un
credited rip-off of Lord of the
liinnf (Bakshi's credited rip-off
would* come a couple of years lat
er); it mixes wizardry and old war
movies and sexism and violence to
generally disgusting results. This
is a fantasy for those who think im
agination is something you grow
out of.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Wizards. It also plays at the late
show this weekend at the Old Mill,
Mountain View.

Julia kkkk
Fox, Redwood City
Director Fred Zinnemann's su
perb craftmanship and in
telligence dominate this film
about friendship and its responsi
bilities. Jane Fonda and Vanessa
Redgrave star in this true story
based on Lillian Hellman's auto
biographical book Pcntimento.
Both performers are brilliant;
Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine, un
derstated performance as the ide
alistic Julia. A must-see film.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Resurrection.
— Ron Lillejord.
Fame ■*"*
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
There are about three good
minutes in this one, and those
three—most of them involving
singing, dancing, and suchlike
are choice. But to get those few
nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours of I was a
Tecnagcd Chorus Line. All the fa
miliar faces are here: an ignorant
but-talented ghetto kid, a girl who
brings along a Jewish mother out
of a '40s comic strip, and a lonely
but-talented homosexual son of a
famous actress. All work to prove
that it takes an incredible amount
of talent to keep churning out
melodrama.
Alan Parker, who made the
world sate for stereotypes with
1978's Midnight Express,
directed.

Hind walker ★★'/*
Old Mill. Mountain View
Windualher is set in 1797 and
most of the actors speak in Native
American languages; its theme is
the glorification of strong, individ
ualistic men. The Windwalker
(Trevor Howard) is an aged
Cheyenne who uses guile and
nerve to survive countless hard
ships as he guides his family south
to meet the rest of the tribe. The
film is less an action-packed ad
venture story than an evocation of
mythological certainties. It is at
times portentous, gory, and sexist.
Still, with Clint Eastwood out
making chimpanzee movies, di
rector Kieth Merril may be the
most able exponent of the conser
vative-libertarian ethos now work
ing in American film.

Star Trek **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Empty, apocalyptic rumblings
trom the world champions of
greed — Paramount Pictures De
spite the seeming grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and Its ending — where
one of the Ertterprise's crew mem
bers saves the universe by gleeful
ly agreeing to some cosmic sex —
is unintentionally hilarious.
Shatner, Nimoy and the rest were
better on TV, on the large screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Wizards.

The Searchers kkkk
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Few men had a better feel for
the western film than director
John Ford; he made films that
were equal parts myth and acutely
observed reality. This stunning
western is one of his very best.
John Wayne stars as a man whose
niece (played by a very young
Natalie Wood) has been kidnapped
and raised by Indians; his pride is
so great that he decides that he
would rather see the girl dead than
"ruined" by people he views as
savages. We are shocked, yet we
cannot turn away from his charac
ter. Ford's artistry is for forcing
us to try to understand a character
even when he seems most incom
prehensible.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Sam Peckinpah's The Wild
Hunch.

The boar Seasons k 1
Palo Alto Square
A tiresome movie about seven
tiresome people who become more
tiresome as the movie progresses.
Alan Alda wrote and directed this
gimmicky comedy/drama about
middle-aged angst; his per
formance is nice, but the movie
just doesn't hold together. The
"revelations" he gives us about
his characters — played, for the
most part nicely, by a cast that in
cludes Carol Burnett, Rita
Moreno, and Sandy Dennis — seem
middle-aged, too.
- J.M.
Black Orpheus kk
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Marcel Camus re
locates the myth of Orpheus and
Eurydice to carnival time in Rio;
the results are beautifully im
pressive. The myth is an in
credibly durable one (it was trans
ferred to modern-day France by
Jean Cocteau in his Orphee), and
no matter in what form you see it,
it never fails to be fascinating. The
carnival makes a striking Hades,
and Camus mixes joy and terror
expertly. Breno Mello plays Or
pheus.
Plays tonight only.

One of Hitchcock s master-
pieces, and — I'm perfectly seri- a
ous — one of the greatest movies *
the cinema has produced Even af-
ter many viewings have reduced a
its suspense, this film fascinates
with its incredible command of i
[film form, its perverse wit, and its 4
[dark vision of an empty society
ilt's one of the most influential i
.films of the last two decades; it 4
has been endlessly imitated, but
its richness of theme and detail
have never been matched
Hitchcock's genius is for implicat
ing his audience in the crimes of
his characters — we are placed in
the role of first an impulsive thief
and then a psychotic. Both,
Hitchcock suggests, are equally
••logical" psychological states.
Anthony Perkins gives a
brilliant performance as Norman
Bates, a young man with family
problems. The incredibly
evocative score, composed entire
ly for strings, is by Bernard Her
rmann Janet Leigh and Vera
Miles are also featured

Old Mill, Mountain View
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone The ultimate responsibility
tor this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski Unable to
render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments.' What he forgot to
do. or what he was afraid to at
tempt. was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's lovely
"epic" photography isn't enough i"
for seeing the movie rather than*
staying home and rereading the
book. '
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia<
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,"
without in the least intending to,<
drive men to do terrible deeds But
her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her 1
much-touted Cornish accent, lies,
i another one that sounds as if it
I drifted in off the banks of the 1
tohine.

Park. Menlo Park
By turns magnificent and pre
posterous. luminous and opaque,
this film of the Arthurian legend is
a tribute to director John
Boorman's freakish talent Bad
writing wars with classical, pain
terly tableau battles and scenes in
which the fairy-tale grandeur of
the movie catches us up in the ro
mantic whirl of the story. The act
ing is highly variable: Nicol Wil
liamson is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin; Paul Geoffrey plays Sir
Percival feelingly; Helen Mirren,
as Morgana, has some high witchy
moments; and most of the other
principals are dwarfed by the stat
ure ot the characters they are
playing, though Nigel Terry reads
Arthur's lines well — even mov
ingly.
