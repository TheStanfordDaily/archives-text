In the 1980s, cable television promises greater
public access to the media and a diversity not found
on today's televison networks, according to Elie
Abel and Anne Rawiey Saldich, who spoke last night
at Toyon Hall.
Saldich, assistant editor ot The Journal of Eco
nomic Literature, said. "I think the air waves will
be opened up. but those people (broadcasting) on
cable will reach fewer people."
Saldich cautioned that the historical perspective
not be forgotten. "As cable television emerges from
oppression,'' she said, "we should not under
estimate the size ot its audience. Remember that
Christ started with only 12 apostles.
"We will learn to use cable and it will provide a
greater access to the air waves, she added."
Abel, a professor ot communication, said that
changes will have to be made before public access
cable TV becomes a viable source for the expression
ot alternate viewpoints.
Saldich spoke on democracy and mass media in
America. She said the CUBE system in Cincinnati

provides for instantaneous communication between
viewers and broadcasters. This allows broadcasters
to gauge public reactions in instances such as elec
tions.
"Advocates of instant communication think this
type of plebiscite is the ultimate in democracy,"
Saldich said.
While she conceeded that it was quick and effi
cient, she emphasized that democratic government
was designed to be inefficient.
"Fast is not better," she said, adding that "much
of the reporting today is inaccurate because too
much emphasis is placed on getting information
quickly."
She added that these inaccuracies are causing a
"shift of democratic leadership to reporters."
"We are going to have to take control of the tyran
nous telecommunications systems," Saldich con
cluded.
Abel countered her view, saying that television
does not set the political agenda.
He also advocated the establishment of a press

council to ensure media accountability. "The Na
tional News Council was set up in this country about
eight years ago. . . . The problem is that the Council
has no teeth to enforce its rulings and in the Ameri
can scheme of things it probably cannot," Abel said.
Abel, a newspaper journalist for 16 years, said
newspapers are currently on the defensive "thanks
to that bizzare incident at The Washington Post."
He was referring to the case in which a Post re
porter, Janet Cook, fabricated her Pulitzer-Prize
winning story on a young heroin addict.
"This has raised difficult questions. Are reporters
to blame or have editors become too trusting?' The
trouble has to be traced the first editor who failed to
strike a story from an unidentified source." he said.
Both Abel and Saldich agreed that all mass media
in the country are going through a period ot change
and that it is difficult to to predict what direction it
will take. Abel, however, noted that the Reagan ad
minstration could have a big effect if it goes through
with its free-market reasoning and deregulates tele
vision.
