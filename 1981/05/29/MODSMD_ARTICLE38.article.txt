ASSU-Daily Softball
The Daily Softball squad, which has
gone undefeated in the last half of its
season, will take on the winless (also
untested) ASSU Politicos (we thought
up that name) tomorrow. The contest
will be the final one of the year for the
Daily, with more than one star turning
in an emotional final performance.
Don't miss it — that goes for players
especially . . . tomorrow, 10 a.m.,
Angell Field.
Staff lunch second coming
For all Daily staffers who thought

yesterday's staff lunch was the last —
prepare for miracles. The second final
staff lunch of the year will be held on
Wednesday tor all people interested in
working on the paper this fall. Impor
tant and enticing information about
the tall volume will be distributed at
that time. Loaves and fishes will be
served.
'Daily' cessation
Today's issue is the final regular
edition of the Daily. We will be pub
lishing a special Dead Week issue on
Wednesday.
