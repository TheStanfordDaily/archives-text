# SWOPSI symposium presents water controversy
## Peripheral Canal discussed 
### Marianne Villanueva 
California has had a long and com
plex history of water problems.
The latest controversy has been
over the proposed Peripheral Canal —
a channel which would divert water
from water sources in Northern Cali
fornia and funnel them to Southern
California.
The Peripheral Canal bill — SB 200
— will be presented for a voter refer
endum at the next state election, per
haps this coming November.
The issues raging over the Per
ipheral Canal were discussed last
Wednesday night at a symposium or
ganized by the members of SWOPSI
135, "California Water: History and
Politics."

The guest speakers for the sym
posium were: Don Froelich, a senior
engineer with the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California; Dick
Walker, assistant professor of geogra
phy at UC-Berkeley and a represent
ative of the Coalition to Stop the Per
ipheral Canal; Dorothy Green, co
founder of WATER, the Los Angeles
based Working Alliance to Equalize
Rates; and William Dußois, who rep
resented the California Farm Bureau
Federation, a private organization of
approximately 93.000 farming fami
lies.
Froelich. the first speaker, said the
canal could provide water for 15 mil
lion people, more than half the people
in California. He said the increasing
demand lor water is caused by popu
lation increase.
Froelich pointed out that the Metro
politan Water District, in wanting to
divert water from the Delta tor its
own use, is not unique.
"Ninety percent of the people in the
San Francisco Peninsula get their wa
ter from other locations in the state,"
he said. The "basic objective" of the
Peripheral Canal, said Froelich is "to
bypass the Delta" — whose mean
dering channels make it an inefficient
water conveyance system — and get
the water up to the headwaters of the
Sacramento River. Then, the water
would flow directly from there to the
state pumps near Tracy, Calif, and
then down to Southern California.
Among the many advantages to this
approach, Froelich said, is better wa
ter quality. The canal, by reducing the
amount ot salinity in the system,
would reduce pressure on the levee
system, which now operates to keep
the Delta from being inundated by wa
ter.
Second, and the most important ad
vantage, would be improvement of
fishery resources in the Delta. At
present, water from the Sacramento
River is moved to the pumps by way of
the Delta channels. This reverses the
natural How of water in the Delta,
harming fisheries in the area.
Walker, the next speaker, main
tained that the canal was only part of
the issue. When one considers the
series of reservoirs that would have to
be built to meet the canal's projected
yield of 2.5 million acre feet of water,
he said, "We are talking about a public
works project second only to the MX
missile."
As the situation now stands, the
State Water Project, which began 20
years ago to solve California's conti
nuing problems with water supply, is

the second largest energy consumer in
the State, according to Walker The
Peripheral Canal would add signifi
cantly to the energy demands of the
state, without adding significant im
provement to the environment
As for the claim that the Peripheral
Canal will lead to an improvement in
San Francisco Bay's water quality,
Walker maintained that "the natural
flow of the current will prevent salt in
trusion in the Delta it you just leave
the water alone."
Walker said that the Peripheral
C'anal was just one more example ot
the trend towards "larger and larger
interventions by the government"
leading to "diminishing returns."
Southern California would not need
more water if there were better man
agement of its ground water re
sources. he claimed.
Green, the third speaker, said that
no state-conducted studies on the Cali
fornia water situation, have never
projected the cost of state water
projects and the increased tax rates
users would bear.
At present, Green said, consumers
pay for the water at rates drawn up in
the 19605, when "we were paying $2
per barrel of oil." Two years from
now, energy contracts "have to be re
negotiated," and that, she said, is
when the consumer will feel the brunt
of shouldering the "capital cost of ex
pansion ot the State Water Project and
the increased energy costs ot trans
porting the water" through the canal
Green said one argument favoring
the canal is the imminent completion
of the Central Arizona Project, which
will assume first rights to the water of
the Colorado River, currently provid
ing Southern California with 600,000
acre feet of water.
But Green said an examination ot
the Metropolitan Water District's own
published figures shows that after Ari
zona gets its share ot the river s wa
ter, the Los Angeles area will be short
by only 11 to 14 percent of expected de
mand in the year 2000.
Dußois, the last speaker, said that
he favored SB 200, but not Proposition
8, passed in last November's election.
Proposition 8 provides a series of en
vironmental safeguards for the North
Coast rivers. The safeguards will au
tomatically take effect if SB 200 is ap
proved.
Proposition 8, which will limit the
water Northern California can export,
will, Dubois said, "take away the wa
ter we need tor the Peripheral Canal."

will assume first rights to the water of
the Colorado River, currently provid
ing Southern California with 600,000
acre feet of water.
But Green said an examination ot
the Metropolitan Water District's own
published figures shows that after Ari
zona gets its share ot the river s wa
ter, the Los Angeles area will be short
by only 11 to 14 percent of expected de
mand in the year 2000.
Dußois, the last speaker, said that
he favored SB 200, but not Proposition
8, passed in last November's election.
Proposition 8 provides a series of en
vironmental safeguards for the North
Coast rivers. The safeguards will au
tomatically take effect if SB 200 is ap
proved.
Proposition 8, which will limit the
water Northern California can export,
will, Dubois said, "take away the wa
ter we need tor the Peripheral Canal."
California has had a long and com
plex history of water problems.
The latest controversy has been
over the proposed Peripheral Canal —
a channel which would divert water
from water sources in Northern Cali
fornia and funnel them to Southern
California.
The Peripheral Canal bill — SB 200
— will be presented for a voter refer
endum at the next state election, per
haps this coming November.
The issues raging over the Per
ipheral Canal were discussed last
Wednesday night at a symposium or
ganized by the members of SWOPSI
135, "California Water: History and
Politics."

The guest speakers for the sym
posium were: Don Froelich, a senior
engineer with the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California; Dick
Walker, assistant professor of geogra
phy at UC-Berkeley and a represent
ative of the Coalition to Stop the Per
ipheral Canal; Dorothy Green, co
founder of WATER, the Los Angeles
based Working Alliance to Equalize
Rates; and William Dußois, who rep
resented the California Farm Bureau
Federation, a private organization of
approximately 93.000 farming fami
lies.
Froelich. the first speaker, said the
canal could provide water for 15 mil
lion people, more than half the people
in California. He said the increasing
demand lor water is caused by popu
lation increase.
Froelich pointed out that the Metro
politan Water District, in wanting to
divert water from the Delta tor its
own use, is not unique.
"Ninety percent of the people in the
San Francisco Peninsula get their wa
ter from other locations in the state,"
he said. The "basic objective" of the
Peripheral Canal, said Froelich is "to
bypass the Delta" — whose mean
dering channels make it an inefficient
water conveyance system — and get
the water up to the headwaters of the
Sacramento River. Then, the water
would flow directly from there to the
state pumps near Tracy, Calif, and
then down to Southern California.
Among the many advantages to this
approach, Froelich said, is better wa
ter quality. The canal, by reducing the
amount ot salinity in the system,
would reduce pressure on the levee
system, which now operates to keep
the Delta from being inundated by wa
ter.
Second, and the most important ad
vantage, would be improvement of
fishery resources in the Delta. At
present, water from the Sacramento
River is moved to the pumps by way of
the Delta channels. This reverses the
natural How of water in the Delta,
harming fisheries in the area.
Walker, the next speaker, main
tained that the canal was only part of
the issue. When one considers the
series of reservoirs that would have to
be built to meet the canal's projected
yield of 2.5 million acre feet of water,
he said, "We are talking about a public
works project second only to the MX
missile."
As the situation now stands, the
State Water Project, which began 20
years ago to solve California's conti
nuing problems with water supply, is

the second largest energy consumer in
the State, according to Walker The
Peripheral Canal would add signifi
cantly to the energy demands of the
state, without adding significant im
provement to the environment
As for the claim that the Peripheral
Canal will lead to an improvement in
San Francisco Bay's water quality,
Walker maintained that "the natural
flow of the current will prevent salt in
trusion in the Delta it you just leave
the water alone."
Walker said that the Peripheral
C'anal was just one more example ot
the trend towards "larger and larger
interventions by the government"
leading to "diminishing returns."
Southern California would not need
more water if there were better man
agement of its ground water re
sources. he claimed.
Green, the third speaker, said that
no state-conducted studies on the Cali
fornia water situation, have never
projected the cost of state water
projects and the increased tax rates
users would bear.
At present, Green said, consumers
pay for the water at rates drawn up in
the 19605, when "we were paying $2
per barrel of oil." Two years from
now, energy contracts "have to be re
negotiated," and that, she said, is
when the consumer will feel the brunt
of shouldering the "capital cost of ex
pansion ot the State Water Project and
the increased energy costs ot trans
porting the water" through the canal
Green said one argument favoring
the canal is the imminent completion
of the Central Arizona Project, which
will assume first rights to the water of
the Colorado River, currently provid
ing Southern California with 600,000
acre feet of water.
