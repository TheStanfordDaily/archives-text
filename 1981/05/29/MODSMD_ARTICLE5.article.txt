## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
The thiraFriday of the quarter will
be the new deadline tor students to
choose to t&ke a class pass/no credit,
the Faculty Senate decided yesterday
In addition, the responsibility lor
administration of the P NC option wilt
be placed on the registrar, no longer
making the arrangement one between
student ar.d teacher
The senate defeated two other Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) recommenda
tions. One have established a
deadline tor withdrawing from a
course without record of the with
drawal appearing on the student's
transcript The other recommenda
tion indicated failures acu
late withdrawals on transcripts.
The senate's rejection of the pro
posal maans that Stanford transcripts
will continue not to record failure, rior
will a deadline be imposed for drop
ping a class.
ASSU Senate Chairman Dave
Phelps had mixed reactions about the
Faculty Senate's decisions: "Al
though we still feel the decision to pass
the C-AAA proposal concerning
pass/tail was premature, we are anx
ious to work with the Faculty Senate
to gather any information to ensure
that this policy and its implementa
tion will benefit the Stanford com
munity.''
At yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting, initial discussion ot the
P/NC declaration deadline centered
on expense.
According to the C-AAA report, the
Registrar's Office still lacks the com
puter capacity to administer the P NC
option The work, which would have to
be done manually, would cost approx
imately $25,000 to $30,00) a year.
Referring to those figures. English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz asked, "Is it
worth $30,000 in light of the apparent
lack of abuse of the system 0 We may
very well consider this an unwar
ranted expense to correct a problem
that doesn't seerp tr> exist "
As well, AssoV'. Slavic Professor
William Todd pointed out that $30,000
is equivalent to three graduate schol
arships — or the cost of one-and-a-half
instructors. ( ,•
Another issue discussed was the un
fairness that has arisen in the past

from professors implementing the
P/NC deadline inconsistently. The
present deadline is four weeks prior to
the last day of the quarter
President Donald Kennedy said, I
assume from the report that facultv
members are ignoring the deadline It
is very uncomfortable tor students
when faculty say one thing and do an
other."
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs
said: "The present system en
courages students to play games with
the grading system. The issue of jus
tice arises because we're com
passionate.
"II both the professors and students
know that others make exceptions to
the declaration deadline it makes it
hard to say no I would feel better with
the rule and the Registrar to hide be
hind."
The majority of the senators Op
posed re-institution of the F' grade
Biology Prof. Marcus Feidman said
the Biology Department opposes 'F'
grades because such action would
only increase pressure on students."
The reasoning behind C-AAA s rec
ommendation was a concern that.
"Where students drop to avoid failure
of even less-than-altogether-excellent
performance, present policy seems to
teach studonts thalt when you do some
thing badly yt>u can drop it without in
curring any real penalty l ."
Pn response. History Prof. Peter
Stanskv said it was unrealistic to say
there aren't real penalties tor drop
ping a class.
' I believe in perfectly accurate his
torical records, but I also believe in
the interest of the students. I hesitate
to incur further penalties," he said.
The degree to which Stanford tran
scripts. without any indication of fail
ure. are judged differently by gradu
ate schools was also discussed.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian noted: "The
Stanford transcript does look different
from those of other schools our stu
dents compete with.
But Associate Dean ot Humanities
and Sciences James Rosse pointed
out. "From all my years of reading
graduate admissions transcripts, I
know that all transcripts look dif
ferent. I don't see any reason to record
drops."
