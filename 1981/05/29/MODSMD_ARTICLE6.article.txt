Warsaw, Poland (AP> — Cardinal
Stefan Wyszynski. the rock on which
Poland s Roman Catholic church
stood through more than 30 years ot
Communist rule and a symbol ot the
church's trials and triumphs, died yes

Wyszynski's death brought an out
pouring of grief, sorrow and uncer

lion population is Catholic.
The 79-vear-old primate of the

dence where he had been ailing for
about six weeks. Death ended a reign
that began in 1948 and saw the eleva
tion ot a Polish priest to the papacy.
During the Stalinist'l9sos, when the
Foolish government tried to silence the
church and placed him under house ar
rest tor three years. Wyszynski in
sisted that "Christ has the right to be
announced, and we have the right to
announce him."
Pope John Paul 11, who once said he
owed his papacy to Wyszynski. asked
to be left alone to pray alter hearing ot
the death of the man he considered his
mentor.
Later, the pontiff sent a telegram to
Poland saying he shared its "grief and
prayers," and celebrated a memorial
Mass in his hospital room John Paul's
continued recuperation from the May
13th attack on his life will prevent him
from attending Wyszynski's funeral

on Sunday.
The official church announcement,
read by a solemn announcer over radio
and television at about 0 a.m., sent
thousands of mourners to Wyszynski's
residence, where white and yellow
papal flags and red and white Polish
flags fluttered.
The crowd swelled to a sea, huddl
ing under umbrellas in the rain and
waiting to pray at the cardinal's cof
fin.
I ' Just pray and say nothing," said a
r/ian as he entered the ornate building
to file past the silvery metallic coffin
Wyszynski's red cardinal's hat was
placed atop the coftin amid bouquets
of flowers.
With thousands of Poles lining the
route, softly singing religious hymns,
the cardinal's coftin was borne in a
one-mile-long procession from the
residence to the seminary church on
Krakowskie Przedmiescie, the
"King's Highway," near the re
fonstructed royal castle in Warsaw's
Id city.
The coffin will lay in state in the
church until a requiem Mass on Sun
day.
A medical bulletin from the Polish
news agency PAP said death came
from a "scattered tumorous process
ot the abdominal cavity ot ex
traordinary malignance and rapid
progress."

mission met to plan tl\e funeral
