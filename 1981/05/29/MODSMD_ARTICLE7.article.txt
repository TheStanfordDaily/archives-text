# Speaker attacks Reagan's defense budget
## 
### Chris Butchko 
1 Wisconsin Congressman Les Aspin. speaking to
about 100 persons in Braun Auditorium Lecture Hall
Wednesday, attacked President Ronald Reagan's
plans to boost the defense budget.
The U.S. economy would be drained, Aspin said,
because such a large portion of the federal budget
would be devoted to defense.
He (Jiscussed Japan and West Germany, countries
without large defense budgets. The two nations cur
rently spend more on social welfare programs, have
national health programs, and still maintain a
higher growth rate than the United States, Aspin
claimed.
The United States has a greater number of scien
tists and technicians than the two countries, and
most of these persons work in defense research,
Aspin added. As a result, the United States devotes
fewer resources to commercial purposes
"Although there have been times when there has

been fallout from defense or aeronautical research,
it really hasn't been that •great," \spin said. '
"The two countries with the worst growth rates
over the last decades have been the U.S. and the
USSR The Soviets always miss their five-year
plans, their agricultural system is a mess. Even the
most ardent say the only thing the USSR has
going for itis4ts military strength," said Aspin.
Although he admitted that Soviet military
strength was formidable, the devastation of the So
viet economy counters the strength.
Claiming that the amount of money in the U.S. de
fense budget was large enough to overhaul every
major industry and transportation system in the
country. Aspin said that it was absurd for the United
States, alone, to consider defending the world.
"Obviously, you can't jam the defense budget into
the economy. Still, it shows the burden of carrying
the world's defense. . . . It's a crazy state of affairs
that grew out of the 1950s Then we were the world's

most powerful nation, both militarily and economi
cally. Now we're not.
"We're still and important player, (but why
should we > defend Japan while they beat us econom
ically? It's time to change the whole balance."
Aspin said.
He compared Reagan's defense budget increase
to Lyndon Johnson's defense spending increases
during the Vietnam War.
"Johnson got in trouble for not asking for a tax
raise, and Reagan is planning a tax cut," Aspin said
He termed Reagan's expectations for gross national
product growth and inflation rate decline, "voodoo
economics."
When asked about the proposed MX missile sys
tem, Aspin flatly denied that it would be built. "The
people in the West don't want it If the government
tries to put it in, they'll fight it in the court, they'll
tile environmemntal impact statements. . . It'll be
nibbled to death."
