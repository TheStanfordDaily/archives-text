## OPEC summit raises production questions Oil equilibrium will depend on Saudi plans 
### Washington Post 
Geneva — By deciding Tues
day to maintain prices and cut
production, the OPEC oil min
isters did what they were forced
to do in order to firm up a
loosening grip on the world's
energy market.
But the two-day conference
ended with a sense of business
left unfinished.
The formal agreement by a
majority ot members of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries to lower pro
duction ceilings by 10 percent
set a precedent, indicating the
seriousness with which the oil
producers regard the current oil
glut.
Whether a new supply-de
mand balance for oil can be
reached hinges on what the
Saudis do next.
Saudi Arabia, the dominant
partner among OPEC's 13
member nations and currently
responsible for more than 40
percent of the organization's to
tal 27 to 28 million barrel per day
production, gave no firm indica
tion ot whether or when it would
go along with the cuts.
Price hike uncertain
Saudi officials also declined
to say whether they would raise
the $32 floor level price of their
Arabian light crude, as other
OPEC members would like.
Saudi oil minister Sheik
Ahmed Zaki Yamani can claim
credit for standing firm enough
on his country's high produc
tion, low price strategy to have
appeared — on top of a general
$lack in world oil demand — to
pressure other OPEC countries
Into at least a six-month price
freeze. The other OPEC na
tions, in turn, can claim some
accomplishment in showing
enough sense to have bowed to
the inevitable by adjusting to
market conditions without com
plaining too loudly.
But the tact that organization
members ran into a deadlock on
a motion to unify prices, forcing
f |hem to keep the current wide $9
grange in pricing differentials,
underlined the deepening
-division between OPEC's two
basic groups: the large-oil-re
•erve countries, which tend to
a \ong term, moderate
pricing view, and the smaller
reserve countries, which are
heavily mortgaged and there
fore keenly interested in run
ning up prices for quick profits.
Stable period
While OPEC sorts out its in
terests, the rest of the world can
enjoy a period now of relatively
stable oil prices that gives wel
comed relief to the United
States and other oil consuming
nations that have battled infla

tion and slow economic growth
as a result of the steady upward
climb in oil prices since the ear
ly 19705.
Considering the strain on the
oil producers, the OPEC con
ference was conducted re
markably free of the acrimony
that had been anticipated. This
suggests that although dis
agreements among member
states run deep, the oil min
isters appreciate the threat of
diminishing returns they face
jointly.
Kuwait oil minister Ali
Khalifa Sabah said the tone ot
the meeting was "extremely
triendly. extremely coopera
tive." Notably absent this time
were the tensions brought to last
December's meeting by heated
exchanges between Iranian and
Iraqi oil ministers, whose coun
tries had shortly before gone to
war against each other.
Engineered oil glut
Ministers trom some of the
higher priced oil countries also
refrained from publicly attack
ing Saudi Arabia for its claim to
have engineered the oil glut
purposely to depress prices and
oppose the long term freeze
When Yamani then stood by his
country's traditional refusal at
the meeting to discuss produc
tion cuts, the other ministers
avoided making too much of
Saudi Arabia's isolation trom
the group.
Figuring out the real inten
tions of other oil ministers has
developed into a fine art within
OPEC, where officials appear
to communicate often in ellip
tical fashion. Each oil minister
who talked with reporters after
the meeting spoke somewhat
vaguely of having understood
that the Saudis would move up
in price and down in production
within the next six months. But
the Saudis made no firm com
mitment to do either. Yamani
has not made himself available
to reporters since the meeting
ended.
Extend current structure
The OPEC ministers, unable
to come closer together on their
prices, simply agreed to extend
their current pricing structure.
This sets a price of between $32
and $36 tor a barrel of average
quality crude oil and allows for
differentials to be added up to a
ceiling of $41 a barrel for high
quality oil.
Significantly, however, the
$32 base was not mentioned in
Tuesday's final communique.
Subroto. Indonesia's minister ot
mines and energy and the OPEC
conference president, said
Wednesday a lower figure was
intentionally not mentioned "to
leave the door opened to the

Saudis" to raise their price later
in the year.
Saudi Arabia has a number of
factors to weigh before acting.
Its current strategy is political
ly unpopular not just within
OPEC but at home as well.
Bargaining leverage
Offsetting this is Riyadh's in
terest in keeping a club over
OPEC for a time to retain
bargaining leverage. Even
more important to the Saudis
are the political gains that still
might be had from the United
States — particularly in the
eventual purchase of four so
phisticated radar planes — by
continuing to appear to be the
restraining force in OPEC.
Several OPEC ministers
Wednesday confirmed that the
conference had considered an
arrangement under which the
price of Saudi light crude oil
would rise to $34 per barrel in
return for a drop in the price of
high-quality oil produced by
Libya. Nigeria and Algeria
from $40-$4 to $39 per barrel.
But the North Africans re
fused to cut prices. Another mo
tion that would have pegged the
price of average crude at a uni
fied $34 also encountered re
sistance from OPEC countries
that price theirs higher.
December agreement
If the Saudis do eventually
raise their price, other OPEC
ministers anticipate agreement
could be reached on a unified
price in December. "I think
what emerged was a better un
derstanding ot the positions of
each other," said Kuwait's oil
minister Sabah. "I hope this un
derstanding set a foundation
for broader agreement in De
cember." Sabah said he would
favor a unification at a price of
$36.
This was echoed by Venezue
lan oil minister Humberto
Calderon-Berti, who told re
porters Wednesdayl think the
decision we made Tuesday was
a very good move to unify prices
at the end of the year."
Such hopeful predictions
about further progress on pric
ing could easily go awry if con
flict flares again in the Middle
East. But the talk of unification
at least fixes a goal for the or
ganization.
A unified OPEC price for av
erage quality crude is con
sidered a prerequisite for adopt
ing a long-term pricing formula
that would tie the price of OPEC
oil to a mix of world economic
factors. The formula now being
considered is part of a long
term strategy under review by a
special OPEC ministerial com
mittee led by Yamani.
Perhaps the most significant

outcome of the meeting, though,
was not what was decided but
what was said about the need to
reconsider OPEC policy in view
of what appears to be per
manent changes in the world de
mand for oil. Unlike earlier sur
pluses in the 19705, which were
short lived, the current glut was
seen by oil ministers as more
troublesome because it stems in
part from a development of con
servation measures and
switchovers to alternative
energy sources.
"This glut is a rather special
glut," Indonesia's oil minister
Subroto told reporters. "It is an

interaction of temporary and
structural changes. Before, the
glut was due to temporary rea
sons."
In the span of two years, cov
ering the Iranian revolution,
the Iran-Iraq war, in recession
in the West, the world's oil mar
ket has swung sharply from
shortage to surplus. OPEC's
challenge now is to find a pric
ing-and-production program
that will steer between market
extremes while also taking ac
count of the differences in long
and short-term views of the
market among member na
tions.
