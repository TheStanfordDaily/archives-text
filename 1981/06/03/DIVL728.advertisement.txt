MARY
HEALY
HAS
SOMETHING
TO SING
ABOUT.
Nineteen years
ago, Mary Healy had
a success she'll never
forget: recovering
from cancer. She
and almost 2 million
others are living
proof that serious
forms of cancer can
he heat. But not
without the research
and advances in
treatment that your
donations help to
fund. Your
contributions are
important. As
important as life
itself.
