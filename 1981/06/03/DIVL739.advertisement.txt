1981-82 GUARANTEED
STUDENT LOAN APPLICANTS
The following notice has been prepared by the Office of Financial Aids to alert
students that it may be to their advantage to apply now for a 1981-82 Guaranteed
Student Loan (GSL).
On March 10, 1981, the Reagan administration proposed substantial
changes in the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, and these changes
continue to be studied by Congress. Students should be aware that the
terms on which a GSL is approved may change very soon.
If you are a student who plans to use a GSL as a source of funding
during 1981-82, it may be to your advantage to apply now. You are
advised to contact your GSL lender to determine whether they are
accepting applications for 1981-82 and if so, which application form you
should use.
If you are a California GSL borrower, a 1981-82 "GSL Application
Schedule" for major California lenders is now available in the Financial
Aids Office. Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank are currently accept
ing 1981-82 applications, and other major lenders will be accepting
applications in the near future.
Once you have obtained the appropriate GSL application required by
your lender, complete the student section and submit the application to
the Financial Aids Office for certification.
For further information concerning the Guaranteed Student Loan Prog
ram, contact the Financial Aids Office, your lender, or your state
guarantee agency (list of guarantee agencies, including addresses and
phone numbers, is available in the Financial Aids Office).
