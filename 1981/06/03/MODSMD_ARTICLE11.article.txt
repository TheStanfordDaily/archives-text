# Feminists in Kuwait fear Moslem fundamentalists

### Washington Post 
Kuwait — Women of this na
tion share many of the problems
bedevilling their sisters around
the world, but feminism in an Is
lamic welfare state has some
twists all its own
Where else do women teel
that working is a luxury? Where
else can a working woman count
on a staff of domestic servants 0
Where else do women prefer as
a matter of course to work for
the government rather than
private business because the
hours are shorter'.'
And where else does the elec
tion of a parliament trigger
fears that women's rights per
haps were better served by a
government that had suspended

parliament tor four years 9
Although pleased by the res
toration of an elected national
assembly this month, many
women are worried that re
surgent Islam will threaten
their further emancipation and
try to cut back on the con
siderable progress they have
made.
Deprived of the rights to vote
or hold public office — even
though the rights are constitu
tionally guaranteed to all
citizens regardless of sex —
women seem convinced their
best hope lies with the govern
ment taking the initiative.
Fear fundamentalists
Specifically, they fear that Is
lamic fundamentalists, who
emerged as the election's big
winners, will refuse to en
franchise them or may even
push through statutes further
limiting their rights.
For example. Lulwa Gatami.
who in 1952 became the first
Kuwaiti woman sent abroad for
university studies, notes that a
Kuwaiti man marrying a for
eigner confers citizenship on
her, but that a Kuwaiti woman
marrying a foreigner loses hers.
Yet on the job front, especial
ly in the large civil service.
Kuwaiti women have made im
pressive strides.
Fears of being swamped by
foreigners, who make up 70 per
cent of the work force, provide
the feminists' best arguments in
combatting their conservative
menfolk — who are convinced
that Saudi Arabia has things
right in limiting women to
teaching and medical jobs.
Pioneering model
For Badriya and Lulwa, their
devotion to excellence and the
realization they're providing a
pioneering model for other
Kuwaiti women led them to re
nounce marriage.
"Here, you just don't just
marry a man," Badriya said,
"you marry his whole family,
and I wanted to be a professor
and write books and attend in
ternational conferences.
"If I fail, other women will
get hurt," she added And in a
phrase many another feminist
of the early generation has
claimed as her own, she said,
"You have to work twice as
hard as men to prove to them
your're capable."
Badriya considers herself a
devout Moslem and has made
the pilgrimage to Mecca. She
does not wear the "hejab, the

scarf covering the hair, which
many young Kuwaiti girls have
taken to affecting just as their
mothers' generation so en
thusiastically discarded it
Badriya is also concerned
about what she fears is a trend
among educated young Kuwaiti
women to eschew feminist bat
tles.
At the arts faculty for women
where she is administrative di
rector, Lulwa, who is president
of the local women's rights or
ganization, said one of her big
gest concerns is day-care cen
ters for the third of her students
who are married.
Welfare
Such are Kuwait's welfare
provisions that many students
do not have to work to make a
living, but want to study to im
prove and fulfill themselves.
Day-care centers are impor
tant because they would provide
an Arabic environment for chil
dren now often left by working
mothers with their domestic
help — who are often from the
Indian subcontinent. They don't
speak Arabic and the children
risk losing their cultural identi
ty
"The family is starting to
break up," she said. "In the old
days, the extended family lived
in the same complex and ev
eryone took care of everyone
else, but no more."
For just such reasons. 31-
year-old Salwa Razzuki stays at
her job as director of the finance
ministry's European and Asian
investment department rather
than work in more lucrative
private business
The advantage of government
work is that her six-hour day
ends at 1 p.m., allowing her to
spend the afternoon with her
three young children.
"For me work is a luxury
which also makes me feel I'm
doing something useful when I
wake up in the morning." she
said.
Salwa was educated at the
American University of Beirut
and acknowledges that most of
the women in top jobs are
daughters of the upper middle
class.
Daughter of the first am
bassador to the United Nations
after Kuwait was granted inde
pendence in 196'. Salwa con
siders Kuwaiti women only
"partly liberated" since "ours
is a traditional society where
the man rules the home
