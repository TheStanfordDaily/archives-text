# Chung Wei-Wen notes pains and pleasures of the West
## Taiwan grad fits into U.S. 'jigsaw' 
### Dinah Lahnala 
He is a misplaced piece in a jigsaw puzzle
of fair, apple-cheeked giants who stream in
and out of the campus store
The students, dressed in polo shirts and
Topsider shoes, fit together smoothly but he
is not the right shape for this puzzle. They
dwarf him as they brush by, oblivious to the
small Chinese man in grey slacks and slight
ly worn, printed cotton shirt.
At well under five-feet-five-inches, Chung
Woi-Wen is not considered short in his
homeland. But it has been eight months
since he has been among his people in
Taiwan. Last September, Chung journeyed
to the United States, leaving behind a wife
and two children. He is here to study at Stan
ford, hoping to earn his Ph.D. in com
munication theory and research in the next
four or five years.
If there is a contrast between the 50-year
old Chinese man the scurrying students,
Chung does not see it.
"In my country, the younger generation
( which Chung considers himself a part ot) is
no different from young people here. I think
our cultures have many things in common,
because Taiwan has been westernized. They
had prepared us for what life in the United
States would be like, and it was as I ex
pected. So I did not feel I was in a foreign
land."
But adjusting to a new culture has not
been all that easy for Chung. He says that it
is often frustrating tor foreign students to
interact with the native students here. Even
the most insignificant incident is a potential
source of embarassment for a foreigner un
acquainted with the proper etiquette of his
new environment.
Chung is one ot approximately 10 stu
dents from Taiwan currently studying at
Stanford. He is proud of both his fellow
countrymen and his nation. He says that
with pride, and he leans on the edge of his
chair as he talks, pushing his straight black
hair from his eyes with earnest fingers.
"In my country we have a very good land

policy. We have a high per capita income,
the second highest in Asia We all have TV
sets. Even rural farmers. And the great ma
jority of people have no problem sending
their kids to college." And there are no
more praises. "We are people ot high social
mobility. Our literacy rate is. I am not sure
of the precise figure, but, yes. undoubtedly
over 99 percent."
In all sincerity, his hair falling once again
into his eyes, he says that Taiwan is at the
foretront ot the developing countries. But a
note of frustration creeps into his voice
when he refers to the break in U.S.-Taiwan
relations two years ago. Following the Joint
Communique of 1979, Taiwan lost American
support when the U.S. established official
relations with Communist China.
He is bitter that the "Carter Adminis
tration betrayed a good friend with a good
political and economic record. Taiwan's in
ternational prestige was hurt by the break
in official relations between the U.S. and my
country."
But the Chinese have an uncanny ability
to transform a bad situation into a positive
learning experience, and Chung is no excep
tion.
"Of course my people felt frustrated that
the U.S. had renounced our friendship. The
government was worried about the morale
ot the people. We had depended on U.S. sup
port for almost 50 years and now we had to
stand on our own. But in a sense, the break
was good because we were not aware that
we could be independent until we had to de
pend only on ourselves. We would like to re
store that relationship tor materialistic ad
vantages. But mentally I don't think we
were negatively affected."
"The U.S. depends on Taiwan to a certain
extent. We are the eighth trading partner of
the U.S. Furthermore, Taiwan plays an im
portant strategic tactor in U.S. foreign poli
cy"
Chung's said his sensitivity to the role his
country plays in international atfairs stems
from a realization that Taiwan is a small

torn crowing in a barnyard of very big
roosters.
"We are a very politically conscious na
tion because of the ever-present threat of a
take-over by mainland China The U.S. has
played a big part in protecting us from this
threat. Thus, we are oriented toward Amer
ica and we know alot about the U.S. and her
people. But Americans don't know much
about Taiwan They continue to picture
Taiwan as it was 30 years ago "
Chung's life at Stanford is a microcosm of
Taiwan's dilemma. The Chinese, as well as
the other foreign students, face virtual non
recognition by the American student popu
lation. There is no doubt that the blame lies
on both sides of the fence.
"Well, after using the wrong word a cou
ple of times or facing a new situation in
which one does not know how to act, we
often teel discouraged and trustrated. Then
it is easy to stop trying to interact with
Americans." Chung says.
Chung and his Chinese •'brothers" have
the Chinese Student Association to fall back
on. He says that every Chinese student
belongs — both those from Communist Chi
na and Taiwan. There is no conflict arising
from the differences in the ideologies
claims Chung.
"We (the Chinese from Taiwan I don'task
them anything about their background. We
avoid discussing all political issues. They
are very cautious so there are never any in
timate relations between us. But they are
our brothers. We try to help each other out."
Many students have left their loved ones
tar behind to come to Stanford. The Chinese
community is now their source of support
and comfort, a small part of the Far East in
the middle of mellow California. Chung says
they go shopping and to the movies together.
But there is not even a trace of sadness in
Chung's eyes. He smiles his confident and at
the same time shy smile. Chung is happy to
be at Stanford. And he looks forward to next
June, when his wife will join him in his new
home away from home.
