# A 						note from Stanford-in-Florence:
## Students sample spring quarter 'al'Italia' 
### Fran Miller 
Florence, Italy — If the question is how does Spring
Quarter 1981 in Florence differ from other quarters at
Stanford-In-Italy, the answer is probably, not much.
Inevitably, as those who have resided here before
them, Stanford students devour kilos of panini a day,
linger near the mailboxes around 11:30 a.m.,
cherish and share news trom home and friends and
ravenously await the next stack of the Daily.
As the quarter progresses, table conversations turn
to travel, with numerous adventure stories being told
every day. So, how does this quarter differ from all the
others? Not much, and quite a bit.
Admittedly, it is impossible to "get to know" a cul
ture in a brief nine weeks overseas. Attempts to learn
as much as possible are made in different ways, how
ever, depending on the special needs and interests of
the person.
Becky Schwartz, who has joined the Elvenue Wom
en's Softball team and gives up Sundays and several
week nights to practice, travels and plays with the
team. Athough Schwartz has had limited travel time
with other students, she said she hasn't been disap
pointed with her decision.
"It's the team more then the sport itself that I en
joy," she said. "Softball is a kind of common language,
and its easier to get to know people through a shared
activity. I've really learned to swear well," she added.
She noted that while softball is relatively new in Ita
ly, it is becoming popular quickly. Italian Prof. John
Freccero's daughter Francesca, also a Stanford stu

dent, has returned to Florence for a second season, af
ter playing with the team last year. Both women's pic
tures recently appeared with an article about the team
in two Italian newspapers.
Dale DePalatis, a second quarter student here, has
found another way to delve into Italian culture. He has
joined a church choir, composed of men and women of
all ages, with which he sings regularly.
"It really bothers me when people (at the Villa) gen
eralize about Italians," said DePalatis. "That's like
sitting in California and generalizing about Americans.
You wouldn't think of doing that."
"The problem here," he said, "is the difficulty of
being able to get past the superficial level to a point
where you can differentiate between people to form
some valid, meaningful impressions." DePalatis said
that he spends a great deal of time — including week
ends — with friends he has made here and that it was
easier for him in the beginning because of this common
bond — an interest in Christianity.
DePalatis said he thought misinterpretation and
misunderstanding formed the root of the problem
American women have when dealing with Italian men.
The social life here is very different, he said. He ex
plained that young men and women rarely have friend
ships with members of the opposite sex. and one is as
sumed to be nearly engaged after going out with some
one two or three times.
This is especially true in the more traditional fami
lies, according to DePalatis, who said that this behav
ior led to obvious misunderstandings when Italian men

see and go out with Italian women.
"You have to be willing to break down the cultural
communication barrier, however, instead of giving
up," said De Palais, who noted that in the cities today,
young people are trying to break out of their restrictive
traditions.
DePalatis said he doesn't "like to think about leaving
here." He said he has learned that knowing a culture
"is not a skill you can put in your pocket." He said he is
continually amazed by the Italian emphasis on the past
and said that while he believes all people are similar in
many respects, Italians, "have to wade though hun
dreds of years of history before they can deal with the
present."
It's a totally different way of thinking than that of
Americans, he said, "I really feel like I've stepped out
of my culture and can look at everything with new
eyes."
A similar attitude was expressed by Kris Tita, one of
approximately 20 students enrolled in Current Issues in
U.S.-European relations, a course for history political
science international relations majors, being taught at
the villa by former U.S. Ambassador to Italy Richard
Gardener.
Tita said she believes that in general, the American
public is short-sighted and "should at least recognize
the fact that actions taken in the United States for what
appear to be solely domestic purposes (such as energy
policies) have an effect on the rest of the world."

with other students, she said she hasn't been disap
pointed with her decision.
"It's the team more then the sport itself that I en
joy," she said. "Softball is a kind of common language,
and its easier to get to know people through a shared
activity. I've really learned to swear well," she added.
She noted that while softball is relatively new in Ita
ly, it is becoming popular quickly. Italian Prof. John
Freccero's daughter Francesca, also a Stanford stu

dent, has returned to Florence for a second season, af
ter playing with the team last year. Both women's pic
tures recently appeared with an article about the team
in two Italian newspapers.
Dale DePalatis, a second quarter student here, has
found another way to delve into Italian culture. He has
joined a church choir, composed of men and women of
all ages, with which he sings regularly.
"It really bothers me when people (at the Villa) gen
eralize about Italians," said DePalatis. "That's like
sitting in California and generalizing about Americans.
You wouldn't think of doing that."
"The problem here," he said, "is the difficulty of
being able to get past the superficial level to a point
where you can differentiate between people to form
some valid, meaningful impressions." DePalatis said
that he spends a great deal of time — including week
ends — with friends he has made here and that it was
easier for him in the beginning because of this common
bond — an interest in Christianity.
DePalatis said he thought misinterpretation and
misunderstanding formed the root of the problem
American women have when dealing with Italian men.
The social life here is very different, he said. He ex
plained that young men and women rarely have friend
ships with members of the opposite sex. and one is as
sumed to be nearly engaged after going out with some
one two or three times.
This is especially true in the more traditional fami
lies, according to DePalatis, who said that this behav
ior led to obvious misunderstandings when Italian men

see and go out with Italian women.
"You have to be willing to break down the cultural
communication barrier, however, instead of giving
up," said De Palais, who noted that in the cities today,
young people are trying to break out of their restrictive
traditions.
DePalatis said he doesn't "like to think about leaving
here." He said he has learned that knowing a culture
"is not a skill you can put in your pocket." He said he is
continually amazed by the Italian emphasis on the past
and said that while he believes all people are similar in
many respects, Italians, "have to wade though hun
dreds of years of history before they can deal with the
present."
It's a totally different way of thinking than that of
Americans, he said, "I really feel like I've stepped out
of my culture and can look at everything with new
eyes."
A similar attitude was expressed by Kris Tita, one of
approximately 20 students enrolled in Current Issues in
U.S.-European relations, a course for history political
science international relations majors, being taught at
the villa by former U.S. Ambassador to Italy Richard
Gardener.
Tita said she believes that in general, the American
public is short-sighted and "should at least recognize
the fact that actions taken in the United States for what
appear to be solely domestic purposes (such as energy
policies) have an effect on the rest of the world."
