# Belli reflects on years in court
## 
### Bill Beyda 
A stately gentlemen entered
the Branner Lounge last Thurs
day evening. The black suit he
wore and the yellow Rolls
Royce he parked outside were
slightly out of place on a college
campus, yet a crowd of 125 anx
iously awaited what he had to
say. Who could command the at
tention of a crowd that size on a
Thursday night, with finals
almost a week away?
Why, Melvin Belli, of course
Belli is known mostly for his
success as a civil and criminal
trial lawyer over the past 50
years, but he also has written

several books, has appeared on
Star Trek, and is presently co
operating with the N.B.C. in the
production of a television series
on his cases, to be called The
Belli File.
Belli spent the evening dis
cussing some of the more in
teresting problems he saw in the
present judicial system. He also
pointed out a number of im
provements in civil law trial
techniques, many of which he
initiated himself over the 50
years he's been practicing.
Delays in bringing a case to
court frustrate Belli. "They
have to eliminate the delays in
bringing a case to trial," Belli
said. "Sometimes you wait
around for a week and then the
judge tells your case will be de
layed even longer."
Belli surprised the audience
by adding, "Once you get the
case to court, it's a breeze, be
cause you've done it so much.
After you call your first witness
to the stand, it's routine."
One of the best systems
around, according to Belli, is in
Los Angeles. "They give you a
beeper and a number, such as
A 7; they go as low as GlO some
times. But they go through them
fast — there are more judges in
L A. than in England, and you
can be gathering your witnesses
together while you wait tor your
case to come up."
One field where major im
provements have been made in
the last 50 years is in the use
of demonstrative evidence —
props, blackboards, video tapes,
films, overheads, and other vis
ual aids in the civil courtroom.
"The jury used to have to sit and
listen. Now we list our wit
nesses on the blackboard, and
use videotapes where ap
propriate."
Belli was a pioneer in this
field, and was one of the first to
use a "Day in the Life of" seg
ments in court. These
videotapes or films show how an

injured person lives, and helps
the court determine how much
of an award the person de
serves, based on the hardships
they are suffering. Belli
stressed that bringing realism,
in the form of videotapes, into
the courtroom often makes the
difference in the jury 's verdict.
Belli sees serious problems in
our penal system. "Things have
improved corporeally for the in
mates — they're not beaten any
more, but we're not doing any
thing for their minds. . prison
should be educational."
He admits that things are
much better now than they were
50 years ago. At San Quentin,
prisoners could buy their way
out for the night if they had the
money years ago. "One police
chief was out dancing with his
wife and saw the gangster he'd
sent away dancing next to him,"
Belli said. "The prisoner had
paid a guard enough money, and
he took him out."
In other areas. Belli has much
praise tor the judicial system.
"Trial by jury is a wonderful,
almost mystical thing," Belli
said. "The '2 together can come
up with things that as individ
uals none of them would. There
have been times when I've dis
agreed with a jury's decision,
but years later often I see they
were right."
Belli loves his profession —
it's evident from the en
thusiasm he has when he re
counts his many cases, and with
which he encouraged the largely
undergraduate audience to
enter the law profession. How
does a famous lawyer such as
Belli justify boasting about his
innovations in the courtroom?
"If you've been in practice for
50 years and you don't have
something to say for it, you
haven't been doing your job."
Not too many lawyers can say
that.

cussing some of the more in
teresting problems he saw in the
present judicial system. He also
pointed out a number of im
provements in civil law trial
techniques, many of which he
initiated himself over the 50
years he's been practicing.
Delays in bringing a case to
court frustrate Belli. "They
have to eliminate the delays in
bringing a case to trial," Belli
said. "Sometimes you wait
around for a week and then the
judge tells your case will be de
layed even longer."
Belli surprised the audience
by adding, "Once you get the
case to court, it's a breeze, be
cause you've done it so much.
After you call your first witness
to the stand, it's routine."
One of the best systems
around, according to Belli, is in
Los Angeles. "They give you a
beeper and a number, such as
A 7; they go as low as GlO some
times. But they go through them
fast — there are more judges in
L A. than in England, and you
can be gathering your witnesses
together while you wait tor your
case to come up."
One field where major im
provements have been made in
the last 50 years is in the use
of demonstrative evidence —
props, blackboards, video tapes,
films, overheads, and other vis
ual aids in the civil courtroom.
"The jury used to have to sit and
listen. Now we list our wit
nesses on the blackboard, and
use videotapes where ap
propriate."
Belli was a pioneer in this
field, and was one of the first to
use a "Day in the Life of" seg
ments in court. These
videotapes or films show how an

injured person lives, and helps
the court determine how much
of an award the person de
serves, based on the hardships
they are suffering. Belli
stressed that bringing realism,
in the form of videotapes, into
the courtroom often makes the
difference in the jury 's verdict.
Belli sees serious problems in
our penal system. "Things have
improved corporeally for the in
mates — they're not beaten any
more, but we're not doing any
thing for their minds. . prison
should be educational."
He admits that things are
much better now than they were
50 years ago. At San Quentin,
prisoners could buy their way
out for the night if they had the
money years ago. "One police
chief was out dancing with his
wife and saw the gangster he'd
sent away dancing next to him,"
Belli said. "The prisoner had
paid a guard enough money, and
he took him out."
In other areas. Belli has much
praise tor the judicial system.
"Trial by jury is a wonderful,
almost mystical thing," Belli
said. "The '2 together can come
up with things that as individ
uals none of them would. There
have been times when I've dis
agreed with a jury's decision,
but years later often I see they
were right."
Belli loves his profession —
it's evident from the en
thusiasm he has when he re
counts his many cases, and with
which he encouraged the largely
undergraduate audience to
enter the law profession. How
does a famous lawyer such as
Belli justify boasting about his
innovations in the courtroom?
"If you've been in practice for
50 years and you don't have
something to say for it, you
haven't been doing your job."
Not too many lawyers can say
that.
