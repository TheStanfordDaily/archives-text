## End-of-volume thoughts 
### 
It is a hallowed tradition for the outgo
ing editor to make a few parting remarks
on the op-ed page of the last issue. Editors
have used the opportunity in various ways
over the years, some even being too
"burnt out" to take advantage of it, others
writing on the relationship of the Daily to
the community or on its financial situ
ation.
As the volume draws to a close, it is easy
to wax sentimental and think of the good
intentions and plans with which one began
the volume, four months ago. It is easy,
too, to lament those goals that were never
achieved, or striven for and not quite
reached. But eventually, one comes to the
realization that perfection is important as
a standard always held out. but never at
tained.
This realization, however, still leaves us
dissatisfied at the stories we've missed,
the typos that slipped by. or the super
ficiality that has gotten into print because
we needed to run the story and couldn't
take the time to rectify it. But the process
of producing a daily newspaper is not con
ducive to perfection, as the corrections on
page 2 of Hw New York Times will attest.
Frustration over tainted perfection is
not constructive, but the use of those stan
dards as models is. Some shortcomings
will always be with us. They may limit our
possibilities in such areas as complete,
thorough news coverage â€” because of the
perennial shortage of staff writers, our in
experience. but we have an obligation to

do our best. And. over the three years 1
have been associated with the Daily. I
think we have, on the whole, done our best.
Part ot giving the paper our best shot, is
accepting criticism, from both within and
outside the staff. An editor under
whom I worked edited a paragraph out of
an opinions article merely because he dis
agreed with the criticism of the Daily that
paragraph contained. The prevailing at
titude has changed since then, and the
days of 500-word editor's notes in response
to letters to the editor are long gone. But
to reintorce that openness to criticism
that has been fostered here, it is helpful
for the community to continue to make
those criticisms, to complain when com
plaining is warranted.
We are all striving to reduce the number
of complaints that need to be made. My
successor. Sam Howe, plans a series of
workshops for campus groups on how to
handle their relations with the Daily. Un
derstanding the proper mechanics of how
to gain coverage of an event can make the
paper more beneficial to you and a better
journalistic product. But even then, per
fection will escape us.
Thank you. to all the staff and communi
ty members who are a part ot the Daily,
and may all our efforts continue to con
tribute to the process of informing our
communitv.
