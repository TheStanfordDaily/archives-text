'Theme' of isolation
After reading the series of
Daily articles concerning
theme houses, it appears that
few members of the Stanford
community really understand
the goals and objectives of these
unique residences. I have lived
in Ujamaa for two years and
have observed some of the
"problems" mentioned in the
series.
The majority of these prob
lems arise because of one
simple difficulty inherent in
these cross-cultural houses,
namely, that white students in
these residences refuse to un
derstand the ideas of the house's
culture and tend to isolate them
selves away from the happen
ings around them.
When a lack of understanding
is combined with the typical
white Stanford attitude of
elitism and distinerest in the
problems of our world, com
munication breaks down be
tween non-minority students
and, in Ujamaa, black students;
the theme house becomes the
place of tension and anxiety
some white students complain
about.
Such complaints are the tell
tale signs of individuals unable
to accept anything less than
dominance. The entire difficul
ty stems from the lack of under
standing between the races.
Many Stanford blacks come
from white schools and com
munities, and they all must lie
in our white society. Existing
for a lifetime with whites in
charge provides a sufficient un
derstanding by blacks; but ob
viously the lack of under

standing by whites is a typical
problem fostered by the com
plete control enjoyed by whites
in all facets of society. This one
way misconception causes the
problems in all theme houses,
and only through an effort on the
part of whites can any gains be
made.
The problem is real, but the
solution is not elimination of
Ujamaa. Black students are a
minority at Stanford, just as
blacks in America are a minor
ity. The existence of a minority
culture in a dominant,
malevolent society is a tenuous
one, and the thin line of cultural
life runs through institutions
such as Ujamaa.
The elimination of such resi
dences would be an act of gen
ocide. albeit on a limited scale,
but it would be an unforgivable
act nonetheless, and anyone
promoting such behavior plays
an integral part in the "prob
lems" that arise in Ujamaa.
Zapata, and Okada. The solution
lies in a greater compassion by
non-minority students (as well
as faculty members and admin
istrative officials) toward the
differences and uniqueness of
minority cultures.

Major clarified
When stories in Campus Re
port touch off presses up and
down the coast, one must in
evitably feel a mix of ap
prehension and excitement. We
of the feminist Studies Com
mittee were delighted with the
interest the announcement of a
program in Feminist Studies

evoked from Stanford to Los An
geles.
But news often travels faster
than understanding. And insofar
as the reports appearing in Stan
ford and private news media in
the last weeks may have mis
represented the nature of the
feminist studies program, we
feel it necessary to clarify our
status.
First, the program has non
degree granting status; this
means that students wishing a
feminist studies major will
graduate with what is techni
cally called an individually de
signed major with a concentra
tion in University programs
seen as new and experimental;
should student interest and cur
ricular development warrant it,
we may apply for full degree
granting status in the future.
A second issue concerns the
label "feminist" and the rela
tionship of Stanford's program
to a rapidly growing field of
Women's Studies programs and
scholarship throughout the
United States. "Feminist" tor
us connotes a questioning of
gender roles and expectations
and not simply a focus on the
deeds of women. In using a "po
litical"' term, we hoped to signal
our critical intellectual per
spective, and our belief that
feminism must lead at once
toward interest in and advocacy
of women and to a new set of
questions and perspectives with
which to understand the world.
Finally, the press reports of
the Feminist Studies program
discussed the contribution of
key members of the faculty
without communicating fully
the importance of student effort
and concern. We would not have
a program now were it not for
the enthusiasm that has re
ceived our feminist-oriented
classes. The present program
reflects the work of staff and
both graduate and under
graduate members of the
Feminist Studies Committee.

Continuing and active student
support is, and will continue to
be, essential to our efforts.

I didn't realize there was
more than one Cowell Student
Health Center at Stanford, but
from Kiplund Kolkmeier's let
ter (Daily, May 291 we obvious
ly haven't been going to the
same one. I also recently had a
bike accident at night and was
pleased both with the medical
service at Cowell and the at
titudes of the people there. If the
doctor was unhappy at having to
come out in the middle of the
night to sew me together, he
certainly didn't show it.
I have been to Cowell on other
occasions and have had similar
ly favorable experiences each
time. I suggest Kolkmeier make
sure he has been visiting the
right place. Maybe he acciden
tally wound up at a fraternity
and was just being subjected to
normal initiation procedures.

Poor loser
Is it just our imagination or is
our recently defeated local
union being a poor loser? It
seems to us that the union lost
fair and square in a secret ballot
election. What more of a man
date do you want than a 930 to
554 decision?
First, union worker Joyce
Tipps-Coats comes out with the
absurd statement that because
the clericals voted her union
down, they are "not ready to ac
cept responsibility for their own
lives, their own livelihood.'' Re

gardless of how the election
turned out, that is exactly what
the clericals were doing. Unions
are not the obvious answer to
every labor problem and the
clericals simply decided that a
union was not their answer.
Next, Tipps-Coats files a
complaint against Stanford
charging that the University vi
olated election procedures in 16
counts. One of the union's com
plaints is that the Stanford Dai
ly "polled and interrogated em
ployees concerning their sup
port for the union." Inter
rogated? That seems to be pret
ty strong language to describe
the opinion poll that the Daily
apparently conducted. Tipps-
Coats also tails to mention that
the union conducted their own
"interrogation" of the clericals
at the same time.
It seems slightly trivial to
complain about an opinion pool
by the Daily. It seems to be
slightly more than trivial to at
tempt to void the whole election
on the basis of such complaints.
But the silliest thing of all is to
make a fuss over an election
that was won by a 26 percent
margin. Does the union serious
ly believe that a second election
will give them a victory? (If
they do we have a nice bridge
that we could sell them . . . )
USE 715, you lost in a fair
tight and it is time for you to ac
cept your defeat gracefully and
let the issue die a natural death.

'Theme' of isolation
After reading the series of
Daily articles concerning
theme houses, it appears that
few members of the Stanford
community really understand
the goals and objectives of these
unique residences. I have lived
in Ujamaa for two years and
have observed some of the
"problems" mentioned in the
series.
The majority of these prob
lems arise because of one
simple difficulty inherent in
these cross-cultural houses,
namely, that white students in
these residences refuse to un
derstand the ideas of the house's
culture and tend to isolate them
selves away from the happen
ings around them.
When a lack of understanding
is combined with the typical
white Stanford attitude of
elitism and distinerest in the
problems of our world, com
