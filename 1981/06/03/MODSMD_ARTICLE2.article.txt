# Symposia held on arms strategy for '80s

### R.B. Lynch 
The series of speeches, films and presentations
that comprised Weapons Crisis Week culminated
last Saturday evening in a debate between Lt. Gen
eral Daniel Graham and SLAC Deputy Director Dr.
Sidney Drell.
In the debate entitled "Weapons in the '80s — The
MX and Beyond,"the retired Graham said, "We are
at a juncture in history where either we or the Sovi
ets are going to dominate space."
Graham proposed two comprehensive programs
to ensure U.S. dominance in space in the future:
— A space-based foreign defense system, esti
mated to cost $15 billion;
— A space based solar powered satellite able to
deliver energy anywhere in the world at a cost of $60
billion.
Graham claimed all of the significant strategic
and political problems facing the United States in
the near future — U.S.-Soviet military balance, U.S.
overreliance on OPEC oil and North/South relations
— could be overcome with his proposed program.
The retired general assured the audience that given
U.S. superiority in technological and industrial
capability with his program, U.S. dominance in
space would last at least two decades.
He said he supports competition in mutually as
sured survival and added his plan offered a way out
ot the mutually assured destruction (MAD) doctrine
which has only spurred a race in deadly offensive
systems.
Technically feasible
Graham and Drell both said the MX is a coun
terproductive military system. Drell added that the
MX will be vulnerable, according to present predic
tions, the day it is deployed.

Both speakers also expressed regret that the nu
clear debate has beeen reduced to a fine tuning ot the
strategic balance. Drell, however, said he saw no
way out of this predicament in the next decade.
Drell thus emphasized the need for meaningful arms
control negotiations, ensuring the survivability of
each country's second strike forces to increase sta
bility and mutual restraint on the part of both super
powers. These short term measures, he said, are
necessary prerequisites to the eventual goal of dis
armament.
FDR legacy
Friday night, Associate History Prof, ol History
Barton Bernstein presented a historical analysis on
the beginnings of the nuclear arms race in a talk en
titled, "Hiroshima and Nagasaki Reconsidered."
According to Bernstein, to understand the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings ordered by Pres
ident Harry Truman, one must understand the per
sonal legacy left by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
the strategic bombing legacy left from World War
11. At no time, during the war, Bernstein noted, did
Roosevelt or leading policy makers question the as
sumption that once the bomb was built it would be
used. Once the strategic bombing of civilians be
came a legitimate military target early in the war,
U.S. policy makers saw no moral difference betwen
the atomic bomb and other conventional weapons.
Thus, Bernstein said, to look, in retrospect, for other
more moral alternatives to the atomic bombings is
misleading in the sense that Truman and his ad
visers were never searching seriously tor options.
In a Thursday night forum entitled "The Arms
Race: Sources and Solutions," Dr. Wolfgang Pan
ofsky, director of SLAC, said that largely political

factors have prevented arms control measures from
being implemented during the past 35 years. He
stressed the tact that the nuclear arms race is large
ly driven by the perception of power, not objective
reality.
Limited war?
Panotsky criticized the notion ot "limited nuclear
war." "Neither side" he said "has specified how a
limited nuclear war would stay limited. " He pointed
out that once nuclear weapons are used in a war at
all the consequences are incalcuable. In conclusion,
Panofsky stressed that remedies to the arms race
must be sought in the political arena. "'No govern
ment has answered the question of when enough is
enough."
Dr. Jeremy Stone, director of the Federation of
American Scientists, said he agreed with Pan
ofsky's analysis ot the central issues confronting
both leaders and citizens. Stone, however, em
phasized short term practical solutions to the prob
lem He said he saw some hope in the near future in
addressing the concerns of the Right about the esca
lation ot the nuclear arms race. According to Stone,
because the Right has the political capability to turn
the arms race around, if it ever gets the will, there
will be some cause tor hope.
Tony Webb, founder of the British Anti-Nuclear
movement, offered a provocative analysis regard
ing the nuclear dilemma now confronting us. He said
that "somehow, people must muster the force in this
world to break out this very narrow dialogue be
tween the superpowers.
Sadl> enough, Webb said it would take a nuclear
war tc "turn thenuclear arms race around."
