## Risks worth taking in defense of freedom 
### 
One cannot help being moved
by the intensity of Michael
Shuman in his concern for arms
control. But many of his pre
mises, and therefore many of
his conclusions, lack founda
tion. The fallacies evident in his
recent column (Daily, May 26)
are too numerous to list here.
But I feel compelled to mention
two of them before suggesting
what seems to me the more
basic problem with his argu
ments and those of his fellows.
First is the fallacy that the
Reagan administration is re
sponsible for a new arms race.

In the decade'of the 19705, the
Soviets spent three times as
much as the United States on de
fense, and in 1979 alone (even af
ter a slight reversal of our
steady downward trend) they
outspent us by 50 percent. The
Reagan administration is now
taking badly needed steps to
avert the clear-cut Soviet supe
riority which would result short
ly if this trend continued. This
hardly amounts to the blind or
wasteful "race" that Shuman
suggests. Nor is it anything in
itiated by the United States.
The second obvious fallacy is

that the world would somehow
be a safer place if only the so
called "non-aligned nations"
had, and threatened to use, nu
clear weapons. Shuman himself
notes: "Indeed, if such threats
did not result in superpower dis
armament, they could even
tuate in more proliferation and
greater risk of nuclear war." He
asks rhetorically, "Is this risk
really greater than the world's
present suicide course?"
The answer is clearly "yes."
The danger from nuclear weap
ons is a function not merely of
the number that exist, but of
their availability to nations in
unstable political and military
crises. The United States and
the Soviets have so far been able
to avoid such instability. With
prudent policies, we can con
tinue to do so. We cannot be so
sure what will happen when
such weapons fall into the hands
of persons like Colonel Khad
afi. Even assuming that na
tions can be truly non-aligned
(Cuba, after all, is a leader of
the "non-aligned movement"),
nuclear weapons are many
times more dangerous in the
hands of international terrorists
than in the hands of the super
powers.
I must confess here that this
seems obvious, but apparently
many disagree. Shuman s pro
posal to arm the Third World is
also at the core of the
"Rabinowitch Essay on How to
Eliminate the Threat of Nuclear
War" for which he won $5000
from The Bulletin of the Atom
ic Scientists. It gives one pause.
These and other fallacies
aside, however, it is useful to ex
plore further Shuman's argu
ments and those of his fellow
arms control advocates.
The essential argument of
many arms control groups
seems to be against what might
be called the doctrine of "flex
ible response." That doctrine
holds that we should have op
tions for responding to Soviet
aggression, including a Soviet
first nuclear strike, other than
just massive nuclear retaliation
against their cities.
The arms control groups ridi
cule notions that nuclear war
might somehow be limited.
They prefer reliance on a sec
ond doctrine, that of "mutually
assured destruction" (MAD).
This calls for the targeting of
cities, and depends on the threat
of massive destruction of hu
man life as a means of deterring
nuclear war. To this end, the
Physicians Against Nuclear
War, for example, go about de
scribing in gruesome detail the
effects of a nuclear exchange.

But this theory of assured de
struction has suffered brutally
in its encounter with the real
world. Aside from its question
able morality, the Soviets have
never accepted the idea that we
can hold one another's cities
hostage. They have continued to
develop weapons for strategic
military purposes.
In the face of Soviet develop
ment, it has become clear that
reliance on MAD would leave us
with only bad options in case of a
"surgical" Soviet first strike.
We could surrender immediate
ly. Or we could decimate some
of their cities, knowing full well
that they held enough force in
reserve to decimate our own
cities in a third strike.
Reliance on MAD leaves us in
a very unstable position — one
in which the Soviets could gain a
substantial advantage with a
first strike. The ability to react
flexibly by attacking Soviet mil
itary targets — in particular
their reloadable missile silos —
increase the credibility of our
nuclear deterrent.
Flexible response increases
the credibility of our deterrent
in situations short of nuclear
war. It is no coincidence that the
relative decline of American
power, and our perceived lack
of self-confidence, has been ac
companied by Soviet adven
turism in Angola, Cambodia,
Rhodesia, Mozambique, Ethio
pia, Nicaragua and Afghan
istan.
Perhaps most troubling about
the arms control groups'
criticisms of American policy,
finally, is their virtual silence
with regard to the Soviets.
Shuman argues that we need
arms control "no matter what
we think of the Soviet Union.''
He apparently means that we
should disarm ourselves, wheth
er the Soviets disarm or not.
This suggests that Shuman and I
disagree on the most basic pre
mises.
One must wonder whether
Shuman has read the accounts
of life under the Soviet regime,
written by dissidents who have
escaped from their own coun
try. Has he considered the plight
of the boat people, undergoing
tremendous hardship to escape
the Communist regime in Viet
nam? Has he considered why
there are walls around Com
munist nations to keep people
in, while at the same time we
have a problem with illegal al
iens?
While Shuman s concerns for
arms control are indeed
laudable, our freedom is worth
taking some risks to defend.
