## A 						'conscientious objector' looks at fraternity rush 
### 
To the outside observer, spring days
pass by with soothing serenity. Students
frolic through the Quad, anticipating
summer. The palm trees saluting Mem
Chu form a majestic honor guard invit
ing dignitaries to gape at the beauty of
the campus.
It would take an astute individual to
dig deeper, beyond the apparent equa
nimity of the campus; a diligent spy to
travel behind enemy lines to discover
that Stanford is at war!
Hold tight, Ma; no draft card, mortar
shells or air raids . . . just the sound of
firecrackers, water balloons and
frenzied screeches at 2:30 a.m.
Have the Russians invaded? No, far
worse The Greeks. For, here in the
midst of mellow May, we are besieged by
the Pledge-Active wars.
It is tough to believe that a group of
usually intelligent adults would choose to
converge into a militia each night for a
week or two and stalk the residences of
their foes; but hark, I hear a battalion
now. They march from The Row, from
the Lake, from the Theta Delt parking
lot, in legions so strong from beer con

sumption, so dedicated to mass havoc, so
singularly bound to that one purpose . . .
divide and conquer. Incite the freshman
and other innocent pledges to battle!
I'm not sure where their training
grounds are hidden. I've heard a few old
timers admit to practicing water
ballooning on tipped cows. Then there
were the distant screams of torture I
heard from the prisoners being carted to
Bakersfield with only boxers and one
dime.
Major Conklin has tried enemy diver
sion squadrons and a few comrades
wisened up this year. My beauty sleep
has yet to be disturbed by troops from the
Zetes They have united in a tradition so
ingrained in frat mentality that I fear we
civilians are destined to surrender,
"What is a pledge-active war?" you
ask, grabbing the nearest firearm
(garden hose will do).
Deserters reveal that the
philosophical purpose is to unite the
hearty pledge class by provoking them
with lovely little gimmicks like "road
trips'' to desolate places, early morning
wake-ups and threats of death by shots

(of tequila), if they do not counter-at
tack. Unfortunately, these unifying ac
tivities seep into civilian life. I feel like
posting a white flag outside my window
each night to indicate my status.
It seems a bit unfair that occupation is
carried out with so little consideration of
lowly P.O.F.'s (prisoners of frats). The
unadulterated fun of being tied up by sev
en frosh at 3 a.m. in the women's hall
must be riotous for the active, but why
subject the rest of us to those shrieks of
pleasure? Couldn't they carry on in an
abandoned laundry room?
Similarly, if certain commandants
choose to ignite firebombs at odd hours
to celebrate their victories, does that
justify the noise for the rest of us?
It is disturbingly symbolic of the "frat
mentality" they shrug off when
criticized. They operate under the notion
that groups justify action; that somehow
stealing is okay if it's palm fronds; that
defacing property is forgivable if ev
eryone else is participating, that de
struction is less damaging if it occurs un
der the auspices of fraternity kicks.
In context, the actions are forgivable.

College jollies; "bro" enhancement; too
much to drink. All the excuses we'd glad
ly accept if there wasn't a lingering, if
not pervasive, attitude of fraternity
right.
I do not object or condemn the
fraternity system in essence I just ques
tion the liberties some of these gen
tlemen assume at times. I guess I am a
conscientious objector. I object to the as
sumption by any group that their con
gregation excuses conduct that is either
disruptive or offensive to other members
of the community.
But, seeing as how we're in the midst
of war, these peacetime sentiments
won't accomplish much. Perhaps we
should have a summit meeting. We'll
start up a detente policy between the
rush chairman and a few heads of univer
sity. Sign a few treaties, agree to pledge
non-proliferation. And, if that doesn't
work, we can always occupy their emi
bassies.
