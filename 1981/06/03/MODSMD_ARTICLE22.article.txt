## Moral complexity of abortion 
### 
Several critics of my column defending abor
tion raise serious questions which deserve a
careful reply.
I agree with those critics who point out that the
fetus is an innocent person not morally respon
sible for the actions it takes against the mother.
However, they further claim (to quote Tom Pratt
and Bill Peatman) that in "all civilized ethical
codes . . killing in self-defense ... is acceptable
only when it is in reponse to a grievous crime or
injustice consciously and willfully chosen by the
perpetrator."
This claim is clearly false. Suppose that you are
attacked by a crazed madman or an intoxicated
person who is attempting to do you bodily harm
but who is clearly not consciously aware or in con
trol of his actions. You plainly have the right to de
fend yourself, by deadly force if necessary,
against such an innocent aggressor even though
he has not "consciously and willfully chosen" to
commit a crime.
You may not use gratuitous violence beyond the
minimum which appears necessary to defend
yourself against such an innocent attacker. Use of
force beyond the minimum required would con
stitute punishment rather than self-defense: just
punishment does require malicious intent on the
part of the aggressor; forcible self-defense does
not.
My argument is simply that these principles
should be applied to the fetus as to all other per
sons. Currently, the minimum force required for
the mother to end the innocent fetus's attack on
her body is deadly force resulting in the fetus's
death. Her right to use this force is the same as the
right to use deadly force if necessary to defend
oneself against an innocent crazed madman who
is attacking one.
Acknowledging this right does not imply that
one holds the fetus (or the madman) responsible
for its actions or that one wishes to "punish" it.
If medical technology ever reaches the point at
which a fetus can safely and easily be removed
from the mother's womb without killing the fetus,
to intentionally kill the fetus would then be to use
more than the minimal force required for defense
and would therefore be unjustified.
This approach also answers those critics who
suggest that my position logically entails the right
to kill persons already born who are in a state of
dependency. In all the examples cited in the Dai
ly (babies, invalids, the aged, welfare recipients,
graduate students, etc.), freeing oneself from the
dependent person does not require killing that per
son; indeed freeing oneself from such dependents
does not require any forcible action against them
at all.
Unlike fetuses or Judith Jarvis Thompson's
hypothetical adult who physically attaches
himself to unwilling victims, dependents such as
the aged or invalid do not, contrary to Pratt and
Peatman's claim, forcibly "enslave" those who
care for them.
There is no basis for claiming that one must kill
such dependent persons in self-defense to free
oneself from their exactions: obviously, to kill
such persons would therefore not be self-defense

Several critics object to my position on the
grounds that the mother should have special rela
tionship of mother to fetus.
Several writers imply that a woman does not
have the right to defend herself against a fetus by
expelling it from her body since the fetus was able
to embed itself in her body only as a result of her
own carelessness or sexual irresponsibility.
Even if one were to grant that an unwanted
fetus is always due to the woman's irresponsibili
ty, the claim that one may not defend oneself in a
situation made possible by one's own carelessness
is unjustified.
Suppose a woman carelessly and irresponsibly
wanders into a bad area of town late at night and
is, predictably, assaulted as a result. Even though
the assault is a predictable consequence of her
own voluntarily careless action, she nonetheless
has a clear right to forcibly defend herself against
the assailant who was able to attack her only be
cause of her own carelessness
In the same way, even if pregnancy has resulted
from a woman's voluntarily chosen careless ac
tions, she nonetheless has a right to forcibly de
fend herself against the fetus which was able to at
tack her only because of her own carelessness.
Finally, David Fredricks argues that, in accord
with "society's existing notions of duty," mothers
are legally compelled to undergo "forced labor or
slavery" caring for their infants and that there
fore legally-enforced "forced labor or slavery" in
bearing a fetus is also justified.
I agree that the same principles which apply to
infants should also be applied to the fetus. How
ever, contrary to Fredricks' claim, a mother who
does not wish to care for her infant is not legally
forced to do so: she is free to put it up for adoption
if she is unwilling to care for it. The only con
straint is that she must allow others to do so; she
may claim guardianship over the child and ex
clude others from that role only if she is willing to
care for the child.
Applying this principle to a fetus implies only
that if someone else is able and willing to nurture
this unwanted fetus (for example, if it is viable af
ter being removed from the mother) then the
mother cannot forbid the other person from trying
to nurture the fetus if she refuses to bear it
herself.
Aside from Fredricks' tactual error concerning
the obligations society imposes on mothers of in
fants, his basic assumption that "society's exist
ing notions of duty" should decide issues such as
abortion is highly dangerous; society's notions of
duty have often been barbaric
The objections raised by anti-abortionists to my
defense of abortion are important and interesting,
but all of them can be answered simply by apply
ing the same moral and legal principles to fetuses
that apply to other persons. Anyone who recog
nizes that the fetus is a person and who is consis
tent in applying moral principles should recognize
that outlawing abortions violates the human
rights of women and is inconsistent with a free,
just and humane society.
