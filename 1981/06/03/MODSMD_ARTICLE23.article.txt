## Mother cannot violate fetus'rights 
### 
I would like to respond to a
number of the arguments put
forth by David Miller in "Abor
tion opponents in favor of forced
labor" (Daily, May '9), as well
as to a characterization he has
made of the pro-life movement.
First, the characterization:
Miller, along with much of the
mass media, identified anti
abortion and conservative polit
ical forces in the United States
as being one and the same. Con
ventional wisdom in the media
has it that pro-lifers are always
"conservatives" and pro-abor
tionists are always "liberals"
— even when their pro-abortion
arguments are elitist,
Malthusian, or blatantly racist
and anti-poor.
In fact, the pro-life move
ment has always included a sig
nificant number of liberals, and
their number is steadily in
creasing. They include Jesse
Jackson, Cesar Chavez, Dick
Gregory, Senators Thomas
Eagleton and Mark Hatfield,
and such increasingly active or
ganizations as Feminists tor
Life and Pro-Lifers for Sur
vival, am anti-war, anti-nuke,
pro-life group engaged in non-vi
olent direct action at the Pen
tagon, missile silos and abortion
mills.
In the election in November, a
number of congressional can
didates, including Senator
Eagleton, were targeted for de
feat by the "New Right" lob
bies, but were supported by pro
lifers. They all won. Clearly, the
pro-life mandate was distinct
from, and apparently greater
than, any conservative man
date.
The press alternately paints
the pro-life movement as a
rightist conspiracy or as a Cath
olic plot, but never in the same
breath. They would have a hard
time explaining how a rightist
conspiracy could be led by an in
stitution which also stands firm
ly against capital punishment,
U.S. military aid to El Salvador

and the very existence of nucle
ar weapons, and firmly in sup
port of increased foreign as
sistance, aid to the poor and gun
control.
Admittedly, much ot the lib
eral establishment in the United
States supports unrestricted ac
cess to abortion, demonstrating
the occasional tendency of the
left to become so enthusiastic
over whatever is called "re
form" that it forgets to think the
issue through. Liberalism has
traditionally fought to defend
the rights and well-being of the
poor, the powerless, and those
who, in the prevailing political
climate, have no voice of their
own.
Who is more poor and pow
erless than a fetus? One can
only conclude that, on this issue,
in the name of "reform," much
of the left has abandoned these
principles. Like the Cold War
liberals who took us to Vietnam,
they have marched off in the
wrong direction, to fight the
wrong war, against the wrong
people.
Miller argues that the criteria
used for establishing "brain
death" should be applied to the
fetus to determine the beginning
of personhood. Even if we were
to do so (using the commonly
accepted "Harvard criteria"),
the fetus would be a "person"
by the fifth or sixth week of
gestation. Spontaneous move
ments have been observed in
fetuses 36 days old and in EEC
tracings recorded at 43 days.
However, threre are a
number of problems with apply
ing these criteria to determine
the personhood of a fetus in or
der to justify abortion. The most
obvious is that these criteria are
used to declare an individual
"brain dead" only when there is
a reasonable certainty that the
neurological defects are per
manent. A one-day old embryo
may not meet any of the
criteria, but if we just leave it
alone for five or six weeks it
will.

Secondly, these criteria were
established to help determine
when extraordinary life-saving
measures may justifiably be
withheld from an individual
with no reasonable chance of
ever returning to a resemblance
of full human personhood. Even
when the individual is certain to
remain permanently "brain
dead" (which the early embryo
is not), and regardless of the
costs of their continued sur
vival, the criteria do not justify
chopping people into pieces,
sucking them through small
tubes or immersing them in
caustic salt solutions.
Thirdly, Miller seems to think
that these criteria can be as
sumed to indicate the presence
or absence of consciousness and
awareness. They can not. We do
not know when consciousness
begins. The last 20 years have
seen a revolution in our under
standing of the consciousness
and psychological respon
siveness of the newborn. A simi
lar revolution in our under
standing of the fetus has begun
and is still gaining momentum.
We do not know where it will
lead.
R. D. Laing has proposed that
the root of all human anxiety is
the anxiety that the zygote ex
periences as it floats down the
fallopian tube, not knowing
whether it will be implanted in
the lining of its mother's womb
or washed out with her next
menstrual flow. Though this is
certainly far-fetched, much of

what we today know about new
borns would have appeared far
fetched 20 years ago. I doubt if
even Laing takes this proposal
entirely seriously. The point is
that we know very little about
the consciousness of the fetus.
Miller argues that whether
the fetus is a person or not,
the unwilling mother has a right
to destroy it in self-defense He
is certainly correct that a wom
an has a right to control her own
body. However, no rights are
absolute. The reason that moral
dilemmas ever arise indeed the
raison d'etre of law — is that
rights sometimes come into
conflict.
The right to life underlies and
sustains every other right and
have. As Thomas Jefferson and
his friends said, it is self-evi
dent. Logically, as well as in the
Declaration of Independence, it
comes before the right to liberty
and the right to poverty. The
right to exist, to be free from the
threat of destruction by others,
is the basis of equality.
Unborn children don't cause
their mothers to become preg
nant. They are entirely inno
cent. In order to defend herself
against the inconvenience of
pregnancy, great as it may be
but only nine months long,
should a mother be allowed to
violate the most fundamental
right of another, entirely inno
cent human being — the right to
exist?
