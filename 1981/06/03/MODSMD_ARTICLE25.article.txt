— The Fourth Amendment
We seem to be living in the
age of undercover agents. To
the delight of almost everyone,
the FBI and local police forces
have apparently discovered a
subtle but potent weapon in
their battle against crime.
Newspaper columns and na
tional television news broad
casts abound with "juicy" ac
counts of the ABSCAM convic
tions while everyone marvels at
the ingenuity of the FBI agents
in trapping those corrupt and
seedy politicians.
In the District of Columbia,
undercover cops are out on the

streets as pushers supposedly in
order to get at the roots of the
drug addiction problem! In Con
gress we may see the re-emer
gence of the House Committee
on Un-American Activities.
(Need I specify the ideological
orientation?) High-ranking FBI
agents convicted by the justice
department for violation of
fourth amendment rights are
pardoned by our president be
cause he claims they were doing
their duty and acting in what
they perceived to be "the best
interests of our country."
These nice little oddities in
the interpretation and ob
servance of civil liberty 1980s
style pale in comparison to a re
cent case in Memphis Tennes
see (publicized in a series of
articles by Nat Hentoff of the
Village Voice) involving govern
ment intrusion into the privacy
of the home. Wait 'til you hear
this one — you ain't seen nothing
yet!
In April 1974, when Arthur
Wayne Baldwin moved to Mem
phis from Seattle and became
owner of several topless Play
girl clubs, he drew the attention
ot the Memphis Police Depart
ment. Although topless bars are
legal under Memphis law and
police officials had no evidence
that Baldwin was involved in
any crime whatsoever, the
Memphis police department as
signed a special undercover
agent to keep tabs on Baldwin
and his establishment around
the clock. The special agent
soon became regular at the
Baldwin establishment.
In July '975 the special agent
learned that Baldwin's chauf
feur had been fired and reported
it to his superiors. Although af
ter over a year of constant sur
veillance the undercover agent
still had no evidence that
Baldwin was involved in any
wrongdoing, he was ordered by
his superiors to do all he could to
get the chauffeur's job. With the
knowledge of the Memphis city
attorney, the State Attorney
General's office and the office
the United States attorney, the
undercover agent got the chauf
feur job and moved into the
Baldwin home to continue his
surveillance.
In December, '975, five
months later, the undercover
agent hit paydirt. One day he
discovered a little bag of white
powder on Baldwin's dresser.
The agent took the bag and
brought it back to his superiors.
To make along story short,
Baldwin was soon charged and
convicted for possession of co
caine based only on the evidence
the undercover agent found in
the Baldwin home.
Baldwin did not have to look

very far for legal defense as the
American Civil Liberties Union
soon took a keen interest in his
case. In its petition before the
Supreme Court, the ACLU ex
plained the case's significance:
"This case poses the stark
and unprecedented issue of
whether the fourth amendment
imposes any contraints on the
activities of an undercover law
enforcement officer who,
without a search warrant and
with no probable cause or rea
sonable suspicion to believe that
the suspect of his investigation
was engaged in criminal activi
ty or that the subject's resi
dence was being used for illicit
purposes, inserts himself as a
household employee in the sub
ject's home and lives with the
subject ... for the express
purpose of conducting 24 hour
surveillance of and gathering
evidence against the targeted
individual. We are aware of no
case in which this Court has
been confronted with a more
pervasive and Orwellian intrus
tion by Government authorities
into the sanctity of a private res
idence."
An important case, right?
The Supreme Court would have
to review this one for all of the
above stated reasons, right?
Wrong. On April 6 the Court re
fused to review the Baldwin
case when seven of the nine jus
tices deemed the case was not
worthy of their consideration.
Only Brennan and Marshall
found the case worthy of review,
two short of the four justices re
quired for acceptance. Marshall
even offered a written dissent
(very unusual for petition de
nials considering the Supreme
Court receives 4030 to 5000 re
quests per year).
In his dissent, Justice
Marshall outlined the grave im
plications of the Sixth Circuit
Court's upholding of the
Baldwin conviction. Marshall
states that "it the decision of
the Memphis police to place an
undercover agent in the peti
tioner's home for a six month
period, during which the agent
rifled through his belongings in
the search of incriminating evi
dence does not implicate the
'right of people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against un
reasonable searched and
seizures, it is hard to imagine
what sort of undercover activity
would."
Marshall was not alone in his
dissent. Nathaniel Jones of the
Sixth Circuit court also forsaw
the grave consequences of the
Baldwin case. Jones contended
that once undercover agents are
allowed to enter by deception
into the homes ot private
citizens — without a warrant

justifying reasonable cause tor
suspicion, what is to prevent
them from "targeting specific
individuals for any reason and
securing entry in the hope ot fin
ding incriminating evidence? It
is not impossible to think of law
enforcement officials targeting
'unpopular' judges, politicians
or private individuals."
Still the views of Marshall
and Jones were only dissenting
opinions and obviously failed to
persuade the opinions of their
conservative colleagues. We
can only speculate why the
judges remained insensitive to
the significance of the Baldwin
case. It is possible that the jus
tices were probably reluctant to
place any additional constraints
on law enforcement officials
given the present national mood
for law and order. Reinforcing
such an appraisal, could have
been the tact that the Baldwin
case has passed virtually un
noticed in the press.
Whatever the justification of
the Baldwin conviction, the con
sequences for civil liberties in
this country will be disasterous.
The Baldwin decision and the
precedent it sets marks yet an
other significant encroachment
upon the democratic ideals of
justice and fairness. The
erosion of democracy in the
1980s has taken place at many
different levels.
In foreign policy we have seen
U.S. leaders ignore the ideal of
justice by cynically supporting
ruthless authoritarian regimes.
In domestic policy, we have
seen U.S. leaders ignore the
plight of the poor through their
cynical support of a budget
which relies almost solely upon
a simplistic mathematical
analysis of this country's eco
nomic problems, as if economic
problems occur in a political
and social vacuum. But the
latest erosion in civil liberties
as symbolized by the Baldwin
case, although the most subtle
intrusion on demoratic ideals, is
perhaps the most disturbing, for
it attacks the very legal fabric
of our society: the Bill of
Rights.
The ghost of George Orwell
looms over all of us; it looks like
his prophetic visions are not so
preposterous after all — if we
choose to ignore his warnings. If
public indifference and com
placancy to the freedom's pro
tected by the Constitution con
tinues, Americans might wake
up some day and find little dif
ference between themselves
and the citizens of other author
itarian and totalitarian coun
tries around the world.

In April 1974, when Arthur
Wayne Baldwin moved to Mem
phis from Seattle and became
owner of several topless Play
girl clubs, he drew the attention
ot the Memphis Police Depart
ment. Although topless bars are
legal under Memphis law and
police officials had no evidence
that Baldwin was involved in
any crime whatsoever, the
Memphis police department as
signed a special undercover
agent to keep tabs on Baldwin
and his establishment around
the clock. The special agent
soon became regular at the
Baldwin establishment.
In July '975 the special agent
learned that Baldwin's chauf
feur had been fired and reported
it to his superiors. Although af
ter over a year of constant sur
veillance the undercover agent
still had no evidence that
Baldwin was involved in any
wrongdoing, he was ordered by
his superiors to do all he could to
get the chauffeur's job. With the
knowledge of the Memphis city
attorney, the State Attorney
General's office and the office
the United States attorney, the
undercover agent got the chauf
feur job and moved into the
Baldwin home to continue his
surveillance.
In December, '975, five
months later, the undercover
agent hit paydirt. One day he
discovered a little bag of white
powder on Baldwin's dresser.
The agent took the bag and
brought it back to his superiors.
To make along story short,
Baldwin was soon charged and
convicted for possession of co
caine based only on the evidence
the undercover agent found in
the Baldwin home.
Baldwin did not have to look

very far for legal defense as the
American Civil Liberties Union
soon took a keen interest in his
case. In its petition before the
Supreme Court, the ACLU ex
plained the case's significance:
"This case poses the stark
and unprecedented issue of
whether the fourth amendment
imposes any contraints on the
activities of an undercover law
enforcement officer who,
without a search warrant and
with no probable cause or rea
sonable suspicion to believe that
the suspect of his investigation
was engaged in criminal activi
ty or that the subject's resi
dence was being used for illicit
purposes, inserts himself as a
household employee in the sub
ject's home and lives with the
subject ... for the express
purpose of conducting 24 hour
surveillance of and gathering
evidence against the targeted
individual. We are aware of no
case in which this Court has
been confronted with a more
pervasive and Orwellian intrus
tion by Government authorities
into the sanctity of a private res
idence."
An important case, right?
The Supreme Court would have
to review this one for all of the
above stated reasons, right?
Wrong. On April 6 the Court re
fused to review the Baldwin
case when seven of the nine jus
tices deemed the case was not
worthy of their consideration.
Only Brennan and Marshall
found the case worthy of review,
two short of the four justices re
quired for acceptance. Marshall
even offered a written dissent
(very unusual for petition de
nials considering the Supreme
Court receives 4030 to 5000 re
quests per year).
In his dissent, Justice
Marshall outlined the grave im
plications of the Sixth Circuit
Court's upholding of the
Baldwin conviction. Marshall
states that "it the decision of
the Memphis police to place an
undercover agent in the peti
tioner's home for a six month
period, during which the agent
rifled through his belongings in
the search of incriminating evi
dence does not implicate the
'right of people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against un
reasonable searched and
seizures, it is hard to imagine
what sort of undercover activity
would."
Marshall was not alone in his
dissent. Nathaniel Jones of the
Sixth Circuit court also forsaw
the grave consequences of the
Baldwin case. Jones contended
that once undercover agents are
allowed to enter by deception
into the homes ot private
citizens — without a warrant

justifying reasonable cause tor
suspicion, what is to prevent
them from "targeting specific
individuals for any reason and
securing entry in the hope ot fin
ding incriminating evidence? It
is not impossible to think of law
enforcement officials targeting
'unpopular' judges, politicians
or private individuals."
Still the views of Marshall
and Jones were only dissenting
opinions and obviously failed to
persuade the opinions of their
conservative colleagues. We
can only speculate why the
judges remained insensitive to
the significance of the Baldwin
case. It is possible that the jus
tices were probably reluctant to
place any additional constraints
on law enforcement officials
given the present national mood
for law and order. Reinforcing
such an appraisal, could have
been the tact that the Baldwin
case has passed virtually un
noticed in the press.
Whatever the justification of
the Baldwin conviction, the con
sequences for civil liberties in
this country will be disasterous.
The Baldwin decision and the
precedent it sets marks yet an
other significant encroachment
upon the democratic ideals of
justice and fairness. The
erosion of democracy in the
1980s has taken place at many
different levels.
In foreign policy we have seen
U.S. leaders ignore the ideal of
justice by cynically supporting
ruthless authoritarian regimes.
In domestic policy, we have
seen U.S. leaders ignore the
plight of the poor through their
cynical support of a budget
which relies almost solely upon
a simplistic mathematical
analysis of this country's eco
nomic problems, as if economic
problems occur in a political

on law enforcement officials
given the present national mood
for law and order. Reinforcing
such an appraisal, could have
been the tact that the Baldwin
case has passed virtually un
noticed in the press.
Whatever the justification of
the Baldwin conviction, the con
sequences for civil liberties in
this country will be disasterous.
The Baldwin decision and the
precedent it sets marks yet an
other significant encroachment
upon the democratic ideals of
justice and fairness. The
erosion of democracy in the
1980s has taken place at many
different levels.
In foreign policy we have seen
U.S. leaders ignore the ideal of
justice by cynically supporting
ruthless authoritarian regimes.
In domestic policy, we have
seen U.S. leaders ignore the
plight of the poor through their
cynical support of a budget
which relies almost solely upon
a simplistic mathematical
analysis of this country's eco
nomic problems, as if economic
problems occur in a political
and social vacuum. But the
latest erosion in civil liberties
as symbolized by the Baldwin
case, although the most subtle
intrusion on demoratic ideals, is
perhaps the most disturbing, for
it attacks the very legal fabric
of our society: the Bill of
Rights.
The ghost of George Orwell
looms over all of us; it looks like
his prophetic visions are not so
preposterous after all — if we
choose to ignore his warnings. If
public indifference and com
placancy to the freedom's pro
tected by the Constitution con
tinues, Americans might wake
up some day and find little dif
ference between themselves
and the citizens of other author
itarian and totalitarian coun
tries around the world.
