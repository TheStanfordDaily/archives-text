'Personal choice'
I find it extremely revealing
that all those who responded to
David Miller's abortion column
(Daily, May 27) that women do
not feel strongly enough about
this issue to speak up.
No, it is rather that women
here — and most women
elsewhere, as well as the sen
sible men — recognize the
absurdity of trying to medically
or legaliy define when life be
gins. We are aware, instead, of
the crucial need for personal
choice where such a sensitive is
sue is involved.
Finally, amidst all of the
rhetoric, I sense a fear that the
"privilege" of abortion will be
abused. Quite frankly, there
probably are a few women who
have their uteruses scraped rou
tinely — but I have never met
one. For most women who have
abortions, the experience is one
difficult beyond words — an ex

perience the most sympathetic
male cannot fully comprehend,
an experience to which no per
son should try to apply general
ities.

Bike theft
The bicycle is the primary
mode of transportation for
many students. However, the
true value and usefulness of a bi
cycle often goes unappreciated
until it is stolen.
It is a rather rude awakening
when you run down the dorm
stairs on your way to an 8:00
class only to find that your bi
cycle is no longer where you left
it. Unfortunately, this is not an
uncommon occurrance. There
were 61 bicycles stolen on cam
pus during April 1981. The total
value of these bicycles was
$10,760 During the first week

alone of May '981, 17 bikes
(worth $6363) were stolen. A to
tal of 212 bikes were stolen in the
first '8 weeks of 981. This is an
average of over two bikes a day.
Most of the bikes stolen are
locked but only to themselves.
Bicycles can be stolen any time
ot day or night. No bike is safe
no matter how inexpensive or
old. Thieves will steal anything
from a 40-year-old one speed to
a brand new $2000 racing bike.
One of the contributing fac
tors to the high rate is the fact
that most students are unaware
of the prevalence of bicycle
theft. Locking your bike to a sta
tionary object will lower the
chances of it being stolen. Reg
ister your bike so that if it is sto
len and found it can be returned
to you quickly and easily. Final
ly, be aware of the bicycle theft
problem and help by calling 91
to report any suspicious ac
tivitiy around bikes or bike
racks These reports, increased

awareness and being careful
with your bike will help bring
the theft rate down and could
help catch one of the bicycle
thieves.

No credit due
Professor James Gibbs' re
marks on the new rule regard
ing the pass/no credit option
(Daily, May 29) illustrate, per
haps more clearly than Gibbs
would like, a failure on the part
of the members of the Faculty
Senate to seriously consider
their roles as educators. If fac
ulty members are made uncom
fortable with having to enforce
the pass/no credit deadline
themselves, and "would feel
better with the rule and the Reg
istrar to hide behind," then how
can they expect voluntary com
pliance with the Honor Code on

the part of students?
If professors cannot resist the
pressure from their colleagues
who do ignore the deadline, then
why should students resist the
pressure to cheat that comes
from their less honest col
leagues? In approving this ex
pensive and unnecessary regu
lation, the Faculty Senate is
telling students that they need
not learn to take responsibility
for their own actions, nor to
challenge irresponsibility in
others. They can simply learn to
hide behind the rules
