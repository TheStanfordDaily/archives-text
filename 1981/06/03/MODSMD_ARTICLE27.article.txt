# The 						lady behind the cookies is not grandma

There really is a Mrs Fields,
and she is not a sweet, white
haired grandmother as most
people would assume.
Rather, Debbie Fields is an
attractive, blonde, 24-year-old
with an incredible sweet tooth.
"You just have to marry the
right man with the right last
name," she laughed. " 'Fields'
does promote a matronly im
age, but I love it!" Currently the
grandmother' owns 20 Mrs.
Fields' Chocolate Chipperies
and manufactures millions of
cookies annually.
Born and raised in Oakland,
the youngest in a family of six
girls, Debbie began baking
cookies for family and friends at
13. "Since my mother didn't
bake and didn't allow sweets in
the house. I would buy all the in
gredients and make a whole
batch of cookies," she said.
"Most of the time I'd sit in the
kitchen and eat them all, 12 or
so, by myself!"
The idea of marketing her
cookies came through sugges
tions from nearly everybody

who had tried them and loved
them. With encouragement
from friends and husband Ran
dy, she opened the first Mrs
Fields' Chocolate Chippery in
1977, at Liddicoat's Market in
Palo Alto.
Because she wanted the
cookie to be the same product it
had been in her kitchen at home,
she installed an identical set-up
and used the same ingredients.
Excluding minor changes, the
recipe remained unaltered
The main marketing tactic
was, "to get a cookie in ev
erybody's mouth. The cus
tomer's first bite was our best
salesperson," said Fields.
Therefore she walked the
streets of Palo Alto giving out
free cookies. "Pretty soon." she
said, "I had lines of people fol
lowing me back."
After the Liddicoat's store
proved a success, another chip
pery was opened in San Francis
co's Pier 39. Initially Fields was
hesitant about expanding: "I
was worried about maintaining
the quality of the cookies," she
said, "since I wouldn't be able

to bake each one myself " To
guarantee a level of consisten
cy, she invested in special
equipment to do the portioning
and hired a competent level of
management.
Today, there are 20 Mrs.
Fields' Chocolate Chipperies in
Northern California, Seattle,
Utah and Hawaii (with 13 more
opening in the next three
months), and over 300 employ
ees — all trained by Debbie
Fields herself. "I'd like to ex
pand to the East Coast even
tually," she said, "but there are
geographical areas in between
that I'd like to concentrate on
first."
What has enabled the com
pany to jump from one store to
33 in the space of four years?
One factor is the quality of the
cookies themselves.
"The secret to the recipe is to
add so much chocolate that the
dough must act as a carrier for
the chips," Fields explained.
"The product is more like a
chocolate candy than a cookie,"
she said.
Part of the appeal is the
nostalgia attached to chocolate
chip cookies. "Every kid loved

chocolate chip cookies," she
said. "We try to maintain that
homemade quality in our
stores."
At present there are five dif
ferent kinds of Mrs. Fields'
cookies: milk chocolate and
semi-sweet, both with or
without nuts; and her newest
creation, "Debra's Special,"
with oatmeal and raisins.
For the past four years, Deb
bie has intermittently been
working on a peanut cookie. "I
know exactly what I want — it
has to be chewy with a genuine
peanut butter taste — but it's
taking awhile to get there."
All Mrs. Fields' cookies are
made daily, on store premises,
or delivered to outlets with no
kitchen facilities (such as the
Bookstore), each morning. Day
old cookies are given to chari
ties, such as The Red Cross,
which uses them as a "reward"
for blood donors.
Another factor Debbie is
proud of is the price of the prod
uct. She tries to sell the highest
quality cookies at the lowest
possible prices — $3.55 per
pound, $4.20 a baker's dozen —
though the price may vary at

different locations. "If they cost
a bit more at one store, it's only
because it costs us more to be in
business there," she said.
If one were to make a similar
product at home, the price of the
ingredients, plus the price of the
labor, would actually come out
to be higher than what she is
able to sell them for.
Because she is so concerned
about maintaining consistent
quality from store to store, none
have been franchised, but are
all owned and run by Fields
herself. "The focus of the busi
ness is to get good people who
are aware of what I am trying to
accomplish," she said. "They in
turn produce high quality man
agers, and so on down the line.
People like taking responsi
bility, and I feel good about giv
ing it to them."
The intensive training pro
gram she requires of all her em
ployees takes three to six
months, focusing on customer
service, the quality of the prod
uct, and"the philosophy of ex
cellence." She calls it a "Cookie
University."

employees herself, but as the
company expands, a pro
fessional trainer will probably
take the program to each of the
new stores.
Debbie Fields is proud of her
employees, and a great many ot
the company's decisions rest on
their shoulders as well as on
hers. "Expansion is geared to
the people in the company," she
said. "Right now everybody is
enthusiastic about growing, and
we've put in all the tools neces
sary for expansion in advance,
so we won't go too fast without
the proper support."
All success considered, the
amazing thing is not so much
Debbie Fields' expanding self
made enterprise, but the fact
that she looks more like a model
than a plump, little old lady bent
over a mixing bowl. It seems the
energy she expends baking mil
lions of cookies, handling 300
employees, and running 20 chip
peries is enough to compensate
for the chocolate chip calorie
factor.
