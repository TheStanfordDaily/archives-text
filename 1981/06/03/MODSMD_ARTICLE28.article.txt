# Blind freshman faces Stanford challenges
## 
### John Sage 
\ For most students, life at
Stanford often seems hectic,
and generally con
fusing. Navigating through
White Plaza at noon, waiting in
line at the bookstore and dealing
with registration at Maples are
but a few of the more cum
bersome tasks.
C While these chores, as well as
the intricacies of daily life pres
ent problems for the majority of
the student population, they
pose additional complexities to
Stanford's physically limited
students. John Deßenedetti. one
of several blind students on
campus is an enthusiastic
freshman who handles the so
cial, academic, and day-to-day
challenges of the University
system quite successfully.
Deßenedetti, or 'DB' as he is
known to a wide circle of
friends, was born 19 years ago
with perfect vision. At the age of
11, he contracted a serious virus
known as Stephens-Johnson syn
drome. With a temperature of

106 degrees, he developed scar
tissue on his corneas which
eliminated his sight.
With his vision gone, and
prospects for the restoration of
his sight questionable, John
managed to maintain a positive
attitude. "I don't remember
being especially depressed
when my sight went. I never re
ally got down because my pa
rents wouldn't let me," he said.
Indeed, the relative ease with
which Deßenedetti has been
able to accept his blindness is
largely attributable to his pa
rents. Since his virus, they have
devoted much time to seeing
that he has had access to all the
latest medical and technolog
ical advances available.
They supplied him with tape
recorders, a braille-writer, and
provided him with training on
the Optacon scanner — an in
strument which allows the blind
to read bv converting visual
print images to corresponding
tactile print felt with the finger.
In addition to physical sup
plies, Deßenedetti's parents

provided tremendous moral
support and encouraged him to
be independent and persistent.
In view of the many successes
he has enjoyed in his first year
here, it is obvious that he has
taken his parent's advice to
heart.
"John has always been a nat
ural athlete — and a very good
one at that.' This comment, of
fered by Mr. Deßenedetti,
might seem the result of pater
nal pride, until one considers the
athletic ability of the 19-year
old. An above-average baseball
player as a youngster, he has
shown considerable aptitude as
a wrestler as well. In the all
school wrestling tournament
held last fall, he took an overall
second in his weight division. In
addition to his grappling prow
ess, he is also a competent wa
ter and snow skier.
Academically, Deßenedetti
has done exceptionally well by
any standards. Making use of
the Optacon scanner, braille,
recorded texts, and a

phenomenal memory, he has
performed well scholastically
and earned the praise of his in
structors.
Stewart Johnson of the
Mathematics Department
stressed Deßenedetti's strong
motivation to do well. "His
motivation carries him right
over and above most of the stu
dents who can see. He works 0
times as hard as other students
and does exceptionally well as a
result."
In a social sense as well, he
has shown himself quite capable
of handling all facets of Univer
sity life.
Roommates David Tracy and
Byron Jeung both agree that he
makes a "great roommate."
Zete active Pat O'Halloren
commented on his ability to so
cialize and interact, saying
"For a pledge, John's a stud.
Like he always says, you don't
need to see brews to slam em.
The great thing about John is
that he sees more than most
people I know who are 20/20."
