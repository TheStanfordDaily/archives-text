The voyage of student en
terprise. Its mission? To boldly
go where no student has been
before . . . into dry cleaning.
On May 12, Stanford Business
School student Larry McElroy
and a group of undergraduate
entrepreneurs officially
launched an "On-Campus Dry
Cleaning Corporation" at Mir
rielees House apartments.
"Business is good," according
to company president McElroy,
also president of the Stanford
Association for the Advance
ment of Black Enterprise
(SAABE), which owns all stock
in the dry cleaning corporation.
Profits from the business ven
ture go to SAABE, which aims
to promote black enterprise in
the Bay Area. "En
trepreneurship is what we're all
about," McElroy explained.
"We hope to prepare our mem
bers to start businesses of their

own.
The founding members have,
in fact, gained tremendous
practical experience from vari
ous facets of the project.
Stephen Brown, a junior ma
joring in economics and the
firm's vice president for mar
keting, said that many of the
principles he learned in eco
nomics applied in starting the
business.
Asbury Lockett, a senior ma
joring in industrial engineering
and the firm's vice president for
operations, said setting up the
cleaners had been a good learn
ing experience, "one I hope to
put to use after I graduate."
McElroy said that incorporat
ing the company was the best
way to protect it from the dis
continuity of student man
agement. Individual ownership
was not a feasible alternative,
according to McElroy, since
"the names and faces change
here every year."

Incorporating their business,
however, involved several legal
complications. "We had to get a
lawyer," said McElroy, who
also mentioned having to file
with the IRS and federal govern
ment.
But why dry cleaning? After
conducting a marketing survey,
the group found that "60 percent
of the students saw a need for an
on-campus dry cleaners, and
that they would use the cleaners
if one were located here,"
Brown said. "Our main selling
point to Stanford students will
be convenience," added
McElroy.
The Black Student Union and
the Dean of Student Affairs Of
fice provided initial funding for
the project. Their investment
has given McElroy and SAABE
a boost into the business world
— one that promises to benefit
both the "cleaners" and the cus
tomers.
