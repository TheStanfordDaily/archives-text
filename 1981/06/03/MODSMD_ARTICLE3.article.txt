# Excavation starts for new dormitory

Joggers should adjust their usual
routes to avoid falling trees and
branches as site development for the
new dorm complex begins later this
week.
The site for the $36.2 million com
plex, located at the end of Santa
Teresa Street bordered by Lake
Lagunita and Lagunita Court, is being
prepared tor construction which will
begin next September.
When sewer lines and electrical and
gas connections are completely in
stalled, the site will be graded and the
soil treated to prevent shifting and
slippage.
"We're trying to get the site de
velopment started early," said Robert
Nerrie, project manager.
"Right now the laying of utility
lines has caused a slight delay, but
we're working to get back on sched
ule," said Nerrie.
Tree removal, trimming
The site development work, sched
uled to be completed in three weeks,
involves removal of dead trees and

stumps and trimming of the large
eucalyptus trees which will line the
entrance to the new residential com
plex.
"As soon as the tree work is com
pleted we will then grade the soil on
the complex site and lay the first foun
dations hopefully in September," Ner
rie said.
About 80 students will live in the
first group of independent houses,
scheduled for completion in fall 982.
The houses will be similar to the May
field Avenue row houses.
"Our main worry is whether or not
we can keep the project on schedule.
With a project ot this size and cost,
any slight delays in construction are
costly and destructive," said Nerrie.
In addition, the housing project will
contain suite living complexes tor 260
students and a series of connected
houses modeled after Lagunita Court
for 360 students.
No solar power, yet
The new dorms will not be heated by
solar power but will contain allow
ances in the design for retrofitting,
giving the complex the option to in

stall solar heating in the future.
"We've done extensive studies on
the economic feasibility of solar
power and it just doesn't come close,"
Nerrie said, but the University is wait
ing for solar power to become cost ef
fective.
"Because the University is not
eligible for the tax credit on solar in
stallation, the cost tar outweighs any
future savings (at this time)," hesaid
Despite this discouraging report,
the complex will be designed with flat
roots and large windows at southern
exposures.
"We'll also be planting desiduous
trees around the buildings which will
allow the sun to heat the buildings in
the winter months." Nerrie said. De
siduous trees lose their leaves in the
winter.
"The general imagery of the com
plex is patterned after Lagunita Court
and the more modern buildings on
campus," said Nerrie.
"We're hoping to recapture some of
the charm of the older buildings with
more of the tan stucco and red tile
roots," he said.
