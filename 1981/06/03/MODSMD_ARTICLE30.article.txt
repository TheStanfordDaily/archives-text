## Illegal aliens seep in from Canada 
### Associated Press 
While border agents try to
curb a tide of aliens crossing the
Mexican border, the Canadian
frontier is a convenient back
door for tens of thousands of oth
er "illegals" sneaking into the
United States.
Haitians, Jamaicans and oth
er aliens using Canada as a step
ping stone head south hidden in
automobile trunks or secret
compartments of trucks. They
scamper through the border's
piney woodlands, or cruise
across the lakes and rivers
strung along the frontier.

Neivs analysis

Others, more confident of
their "documents," openly
drive through crossing points or
fly to U.S. airports.
But, unlike the flood from
Mexico, it is more of a seepage
from Canada.
Much less than Mexico
In 1.980, a total of 92,896 un
documented aliens were turned
back at the U.S.-Canadian
border or were caught trying to
sneak across, the U.S. Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service
reports. The figure for the Mexi
can frontier was approximately
1.6 million.
However, U.S. officials con
cede privately that thousands
must be getting across the
northern border, making it a
significant second source of the
United States' underground
population of illegal aliens,

which some estimates put as
high as 10 million people.
'Not major problem'
The Canadian border is not
yet a major problem, said Vern
Jervis, an INS spokesman in
Washington.
"But it's logical that there
might be an increase" in illegal
traffic from the north, he said.
'' More and more people are anx
ious to enter the country."
The biggest problem is at the
eastern end of the 3200-mile line
between Canada and the lower
48 states.
"We have a steady stream of
people coming through illegal
ly," said George Lara, district
director for the INS in St.
Albans, Vt.
Different origins
In the East, the "illegals"
generally are from Haiti and
other poor Caribbean islands. In
the West, they include many
people from India or Pakistan,
and the Philippine Islands.
George Tranberg, a deputy
chief patrol agent in the border
town of Blaine, Wash., said the
flow from British Columbia of
fraudulently documented peo
ple from India is "steadily on
the increase."
The advantage of the
northern route is that it can be
far easier to enter Canada than
the United States, and the light
ly patrolled U.S.-Canadian fron
tier is one of the world's most
open borders.
The route is well-known
around the world. Haitian of

ticials say it is openly ad
vertised in that country. At her
1978 trial for entering Vermont
trom Canada, suspected West
German terrorist Kristina
Berster said she learned of the
route from Latin American ref
ugees in Paris.
U.S. authorities say pro
fessional smugglers in Canada
charge $1000 or more to sneak an
alien into the United States.
Often the smuggler drops off
his clients in an isolated woods
on the Canadian side, drives
through the border crossing
alone, then picks them up after
they have walked to a remote
spot on the U.S. side, agents say.
'Extra clothes'
"Sometimes we detect it by
the fact that the driver has extra
clothes in the car," said James
Harrigan, INS chief at
Champlain, N.Y., on the border
30 miles south of Montreal.
Immigration officials said
others come by boat across
Lake Champlain, the Detroit
River and waterways. Many
simply head south down the
highways.
"Last month we stopped a
tractor-trailer hauling wood,"
Harrigan recalled. "The trailer
had a space below it that would
accommodate 15 to 20 people.
We tound a Haitian in there.
"Once they get into the Unit
ed States, they go live with rela
tives or friends, get work and
settle down."
The "back door" clearly is

more attractive than the per
ilous sea voyage thousands of
Haitian "boat people" have
risked to reach Florida.
For a $544 round-trip ticket —
the two-way air fare "proves"
to Canadian immigration of
ficers he is not staying — a Hai
tian can fly to Montreal and put
himself in the hands of a smug
gler or of friends who can ar
range his illegal passage to
America.
Many caught at border posts
have been supplied fraudulent
documents — passports with vi
sas allowing U.S. entry but doc
tored with substitute photo
graphs, or papers supposedly
proving permanent residence in
Canada. Canadian residents
generally can cross freely into
the United States.
Amnesty
American officials say a re
cent six-month Canadian "am
nesty" for undocumented Hai
tians in Quebec province —
granting them immigrant sta
tus — apparently helped stem
the flow of Haitian "illegals"
from Montreal. Almost 4000
Haitians came forward under
the amnesty, but it has ended
and the southbound Haitian tide
could rise again.
U.S. officials do not blame
Canada for the situation.
"We could help ourselves
with more men," concludes
Donald Russell, deputy INS di
rector for the Seattle district.
