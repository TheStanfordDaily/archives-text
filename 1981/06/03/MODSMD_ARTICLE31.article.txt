# 'Safe' mark for Republican president
## Reagan criticizes Wall Street 
### 
New York (AP) — It has long
been a relatively safe thing for a
U.S. president to attack "Wall
Street." In President Ronald
Reagan's case it was a very safe
thing to do, and he surely must
have known it.

!\eivs analysis

Safe because Reagan is a Re
publican seeking passage of a
tax cut that critics say favors
the rich. To attack a symbol of
both Republicanism and wealth,
therefore, would seem to earn
him popular support.
Moreover, his questioning of
Wall Street's understanding of
economics — "I have never
found Wall Street a source of
good economic advice" — sug
gests that opposition Demo
crats and bankers tend to think
alike.
But regardless of these fac
tors, Wall Street is an easy
mark. Nobody really knows
what it means, but when it is
used in a certain context almost
everyone think it stands for
power and selfish, vested in
terest.
In its most limited definition,
Wall Street is the name of the
street on which the New York
Stock Exchange resides, but by
extension it also means LaSalle
Street in Chicago, Montgomery
Street in San Francisco, State
Street in Boston and financial
streets every where in America.
It means stock and bond
houses, brokers, bankers, ana
lysts, letter writers, econo
mists, and portfolio managers
for pension funds, mutual funds
and private trusts. In short,
those who influence invest

ments.
And it means a segment of the
public that trades regularly,
and whose members read the fi
nancial pages and in general de
rive their views of the economy
from the incessant opinionating
of "the street."
It is "the market." Whether it
is a market that represents pub
lic opinion is debatable, because
trading today is hardly the ran
dom buying and selling of indi
viduals. Instead, it is the con

centrated power of institutions,
such as pension funds, who first
collect the money to be invested
and who then make judgments
about how it is to be invested.
While generally happy about
the overall Reagan program,
which repeatedly they say is
headed in the right direction,
those who make investment de
cisions have expressed reserva
tions about the president's tax
cut plan, fearing it could add to
budget deficits and inflation.
