## Animal testing threatened 
### Lisa Hudson 
Man was originally supposed to "have dominion
. . over every living thing that moveth upon the
earth," right? Wrong, according to the Center for
Alternative Research They currently have a bill
before the House that would cut federal funds to
any scientific project using live animals in which
the center determined that the project could use
alternate methods equally well.
These methods include computer simulations,
mathematical models, tissue cultures, isolated
organs, and artificial body fluids or tissues. But
according to Dr James Dewson, director of Stan
ford's Lab Animal Medicine, "There is no
biomedical scientist who would not use an alter
native research method if he could."
Animal research is very expensive, and Dr.
Samuel Strober, assistant professor of medicine
here and currently doing research in im
munology, explained that a researcher always
starts with a test such as injecting a new anti
biotic into the bacteria to see if it will kill the bac
teria.
In the next step, Strober continued, an animal
model, such as a rat, is infected with the disease,
and the new drug administered to test its effec
tiveness. When the researcher has properly ad
justed the drug dosage and has conclusive evi
dence that the drug is effective, he may move up
to a larger animal model, such as a dog, and may
eventually apply his results to cure humans.
Hence, Strober said, "There is no substitute for
live organisms as a model for the disease."
Dr. John Pennock, a cardiothoracic surgeon
here, agreed. He works with dogs and monkeys
developing the techniques of heart-lung trans
plants, as well as immunosuppresants such as
Cyclosporin A.
"Working out a technique for combined heart
lung transplants may take years," he said. "The
only way to do that is with an animal model.
You've got to prove it (the technique) in an animal
model before you do it in humans — otherwise
you're wasting time, money and effort."
But the Center for Alternative Research seems
unconvinced. If the bill the center is sponsoring

passes, 50 percent ol the $15 billion appropriated
by the National Institute of Health (NIH) tor
animal-related research could be redirected to
the development of non-animal testing methods,
and would place restrictions on the projects to
avoid duplication.
Biological researchers claim they already have
enough restrictions and regulations. As Pennock
described, when an application lor an NIH grant
is made, a point-by-point statement of every step
in the project is listed, "down to the last milli
gram of serum administered." He added that he
thought a majority ot this process is necessary,
however.
The U.S. Department ot Agriculture, the Fish
and Game Commission, and Food and Drug Ad
ministration also keep researchers honest about
research methods by requiring annual reports and
by giving surprise inspections.
All this is presumably to prevent cruelty to
animals. But Dewson emphasized that "absolute
ly, to the best of my knowledge, there is no cruelty
to animals at Stanford." He added, "I am not here
to torture animals — I'm here to provide the
healthiest possible animals for research."
In fact, some of the tests most objected to by
animal advocates are required by the federal gov
ernment. Every new product introduced into the
environment or put on the market must be tested
on animals. In the LD-50 (lethal dose for 50 per
cent), the manufacturers must determine the
amount of product required to kill half the
animals Stanford does no FDA testing work.
However, researchers here report that they
have been feeling the effects of the anti-vivisec
tionists' efforts. Strober reports difficulty in ob
taining dogs from local pounds for his im
munology experiments, because the pounds have
been pressured into "more humane" killing with
anesthetic.
But Strober still needs the animals, and now
must buy thoroughbred dogs from breeders, de
laying and increasing the cost of his research.
Pennock summed up, "If we didn't do this kind
of (animal) research, we would still be doing
bloodletting and using leeches to heal."
