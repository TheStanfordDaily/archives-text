# Electromagnetism helps heal broken bones
## 
### Laurie LaPat 
As the result of a serious car
accident, Neal, 24, was left with
both of his thigh bones severely
fractured. After 18 months of
unsuccessful treatment that in
cluded eight surgical operations
and a plate fixation, his doctor
strapped two hand-size elec
tromagnetic coils to Neal's
casts for 10 hours each day,
bathing the fracture site in a
mild pulsating electric field. Af
ter using the electric field for
three months, the bones became
solid and the young man was
able to walk again.
Over five million people in the
United States will fracture
bones this year. Seven percent
of these fractures (35,000 frac
tures), will fail to mend. How
ever, for these 7 percent there is
now new hope through the use of
electricity.
Bone is one of the few tissues
in the human body that is able to
regenerate. After a fracture, re
pair processes usually ensure a
solid bone union within weeks or
months of the break. However,
when bone formation is slow or
inadequate, a proper bone union
fails to develop. An unfused
fracture can become a major
problem creating a fibrous tis
sue barrier to further bone re
pair.
But Dr. Arthur Pilla and Dr.
Andrew Bassett of University of

Columbia, have developed a
new technique that uses elec
tromagnetic fields to promote
bone healing. The fibrous bar
rier can be eliminated if the be
havior of cells are "pro
grammed" by specific elec
tromagnetic pulses coming
from outside the body. These
pulses change enzyme activities
to induce mineralization, result
ing in a process that mimicks
normal bone develoment.
This new electromagnetic
healing system requires no
surgery, no hospital stay and no
known discomfort or sensation.
The technique also eliminates
all risks associated with other
invasive surgical procedures.
After five years of applying
this technique in over 8000
worldwide clinical cases, the re
sults show an overall success
rate of 77 percent. Criteria for
success are union of the frac
ture gap, no local tenderness,
and function with or without an
external protective splint.
The use of electricity for heal
ing is not a new idea. Over 2000
years ago Roman physicians
used electric eels to ease the
pain of gout-swollen feet. In 'B'2
"shocks of electric fluids" were
reported by one scientific jour
nal to be useful in mending frac
tures. In '850 Faraday invented
electromagnetic coils which lat
er proved effective in treating

broken bones.
And by the '950 sand 19605,
Japanese and American re
searchers had found that when
living bone is placed under me
chanical stress, weak electrical
potentials were produced and
that certain types of externally
applied electric current could
actually initiate bone growth.
Dr Andrew Bassett is a ma
jor pioneer ot this electrical
bone healing. His investigations
of the mechanism by which bone
seems to "sense" and respond
to mechanical stress began in
the early '60s. He discovered
that it an electric potential is
applied to bone, current will
flow through the bone because
the bone acts as a semi
conductor, displaying various
reactions according to the
strength of the applied poten
tial.
The electromagnetic device
Dr. Bassett uses is made by
Electro-Biology Inc. and has
been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration. This sys
tem consists ot two elec
tromagnetic coils enclosed in
plastic pads that look like small
shin guards. The pads face each
other with the fracture centered
between them.
A specific pulse of current is
fed to the coils from a handbag
size pulse generator which
"drives" the coils at approx

imately '.0 volts. The shape,
strength and pulse pattern of the
field varies from patient to pa
tient depending upon the type of
fracture, the specific bone in
volved, and size of the area in
volved.
The coils must be worn at
least 10 to 12 hours per day, usu
ally while sleeping, and they
must be on for at least a one
hour period. Increasing the dai
ly number of treatment hours
beyond the recommended
amount does not appear to de
crease the overall length of
treatment. Patients with leg
fractures were cautioned not to
bear weight on the injured bone
until the X-rays provided evi
dence that a union was pre? Nt,
usually three to four months af
ter treatment had begun.
Dr. Donald Nagel, head of Or
thopedic Surgery at Stanford
Medical Center, has applied the
electromagnetic system on 17
patients and has achieved suc
cessful results in 71 percent of
the cases. However, he ex
plained, "I don't start using this
technique immediately after a
break because the data have not
shown that bones heal any faster
with this technique than without
it, in normal breaks."
Dr. Bassett used the elec
tromagnetic system on 30 chil
dren with congenital
pseudoarthroses (false joints)

of the tibia, where nerve defects
preclude healing of the tibial
break and attained successful
results in 90 percent of the
cases.
Dr. Bassett explained,
"We're learning to talk the elec
trical language the cell. By
choosing the proper pulse width
and frequency distribution for
electromagnetic waveform, we
can communicate some very
subtle bits of information to the
cell, (such as) 'release
calcium,' 'don't release
calcium,' simply by inducing
the necessary voltage gradieni
across the cell membrane."
Electromagnetic therapy can
cut the healing time of a frac
ture in half, which would save
on workmen's compensation,
cut down on lost productivity,
and minimize the patient's
anguish.
Dr. Bassett also believes that
electrobiology is at the fore
front of medical technology. He
explained, "It is entirely pos
sible that in the future many
other functional disorders of the
human body can be rectified by
changing the electrical environ
ment of the cells and organs
with specific external messages
communicated through an elec
tromagnetic field that is very
specific in its pulse character
istics."

when bone formation is slow or
inadequate, a proper bone union
fails to develop. An unfused
fracture can become a major
problem creating a fibrous tis
sue barrier to further bone re
pair.
But Dr. Arthur Pilla and Dr.
Andrew Bassett of University of

Columbia, have developed a
new technique that uses elec
tromagnetic fields to promote
bone healing. The fibrous bar
rier can be eliminated if the be
havior of cells are "pro
grammed" by specific elec
tromagnetic pulses coming
from outside the body. These
pulses change enzyme activities
to induce mineralization, result
ing in a process that mimicks
normal bone develoment.
This new electromagnetic
healing system requires no
surgery, no hospital stay and no
known discomfort or sensation.
The technique also eliminates
all risks associated with other
invasive surgical procedures.
After five years of applying
this technique in over 8000
worldwide clinical cases, the re
sults show an overall success
rate of 77 percent. Criteria for
success are union of the frac
ture gap, no local tenderness,
and function with or without an
external protective splint.
The use of electricity for heal
ing is not a new idea. Over 2000
years ago Roman physicians
used electric eels to ease the
pain of gout-swollen feet. In 'B'2
"shocks of electric fluids" were
reported by one scientific jour
nal to be useful in mending frac
tures. In '850 Faraday invented
electromagnetic coils which lat
er proved effective in treating

broken bones.
And by the '950 sand 19605,
Japanese and American re
searchers had found that when
living bone is placed under me
chanical stress, weak electrical
potentials were produced and
that certain types of externally
applied electric current could
actually initiate bone growth.
Dr Andrew Bassett is a ma
jor pioneer ot this electrical
bone healing. His investigations
of the mechanism by which bone
seems to "sense" and respond
to mechanical stress began in
the early '60s. He discovered
that it an electric potential is
applied to bone, current will
flow through the bone because
the bone acts as a semi
conductor, displaying various
reactions according to the
strength of the applied poten
tial.
The electromagnetic device
Dr. Bassett uses is made by
Electro-Biology Inc. and has
been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration. This sys
tem consists ot two elec
tromagnetic coils enclosed in
plastic pads that look like small
shin guards. The pads face each
other with the fracture centered
between them.
A specific pulse of current is
fed to the coils from a handbag
size pulse generator which
"drives" the coils at approx

imately '.0 volts. The shape,
strength and pulse pattern of the
field varies from patient to pa
tient depending upon the type of
fracture, the specific bone in
volved, and size of the area in
volved.
The coils must be worn at
least 10 to 12 hours per day, usu
ally while sleeping, and they
must be on for at least a one
hour period. Increasing the dai
ly number of treatment hours
beyond the recommended
amount does not appear to de
crease the overall length of
treatment. Patients with leg
fractures were cautioned not to
bear weight on the injured bone
until the X-rays provided evi
dence that a union was pre? Nt,
usually three to four months af
ter treatment had begun.
Dr. Donald Nagel, head of Or
thopedic Surgery at Stanford
Medical Center, has applied the
electromagnetic system on 17
patients and has achieved suc
cessful results in 71 percent of
the cases. However, he ex
plained, "I don't start using this
technique immediately after a
break because the data have not
shown that bones heal any faster
with this technique than without
it, in normal breaks."
Dr. Bassett used the elec
tromagnetic system on 30 chil
dren with congenital
pseudoarthroses (false joints)

of the tibia, where nerve defects
preclude healing of the tibial
break and attained successful
results in 90 percent of the
cases.
Dr. Bassett explained,
"We're learning to talk the elec
trical language the cell. By
choosing the proper pulse width
and frequency distribution for
electromagnetic waveform, we
can communicate some very
subtle bits of information to the
cell, (such as) 'release
calcium,' 'don't release
calcium,' simply by inducing
the necessary voltage gradieni
across the cell membrane."
Electromagnetic therapy can
cut the healing time of a frac
ture in half, which would save
on workmen's compensation,
cut down on lost productivity,
and minimize the patient's
anguish.
Dr. Bassett also believes that
electrobiology is at the fore
front of medical technology. He
explained, "It is entirely pos
sible that in the future many
other functional disorders of the
human body can be rectified by
changing the electrical environ
ment of the cells and organs
with specific external messages
communicated through an elec
tromagnetic field that is very
specific in its pulse character
istics."
As the result of a serious car
accident, Neal, 24, was left with
both of his thigh bones severely
fractured. After 18 months of
unsuccessful treatment that in
cluded eight surgical operations
and a plate fixation, his doctor
strapped two hand-size elec
tromagnetic coils to Neal's
casts for 10 hours each day,
bathing the fracture site in a
mild pulsating electric field. Af
ter using the electric field for
three months, the bones became
solid and the young man was
able to walk again.
Over five million people in the
United States will fracture
bones this year. Seven percent
of these fractures (35,000 frac

ever, for these 7 percent there is
now new hope through the use of
electricity.
