# IQ tests still valid, 65 years later
## 
### Gail Edmondson Schares 
Modern science has come a
long way toward understanding
human intelligence, but the va
lidity of measuring mental ca
pacity remains controversial.
What do IQ tests and the bat
tery of achievement tests de
veloped by educators actually
measure? Do they predict "suc
cess"? What are their limita
tions? Perhaps most important,
are these tests valid enough to
wield the power they do in our
society?
Intelligence tests
Intelligence tests were de
signed to give a rough measure
of a child's capacity for learn
ing, especially the learning ot
skills required for school. They
were never intended to measure
character, manual skills or ar
tistic ability.
Much of the fundamental re
search on intelligence testing
was conducted at Stanford. In
1916, Professor Lewis Terman
published an extended form of
the Binet intelligence test.
Binet's test was developed in
France to identify mentally de
ficient children who would not
benefit from public education.
Terman revised it to be used for
all adults and children, includ
ing the very bright.
The Stanford-Binet IQ test
has undergone only minor
changes over the past 65 years,
and remains the most widely
used test of general in
telligence.
Terman, who is credited with
making the term "IQ" (in
telligence quotient) a household
word in America, borrowed the
concept from Professor
Wilhelm Stern of Germany.
Like Stern, Terman calculated
IQ by dividing mental age, as

measured by the test, by chron
ological age This ratio was then
multiplied by 100 for conve
nience — this makes the aver
age IQ 100
The Terman study
Several psychological studies
have examined the predictive
power of IQ tests. The most
well-known research assessing
the correlation between high IQ
and success is that begun by
Terman himself in 1921.
His study included 1528 chil
dren, ages three to 19, selected
from the California public
school system. All the "Ter
mites," as they later came to be
known, had IQ's above 35, plac
ing them in the top ' percent of
the nation in terms of in
telligence.
According to Prof. Robert
Sears, Terman was looking for a
good way to measure aptitude
for school achievement. He as
sumed there was a general fac
tor of intelligence and that it re
lated to success in life," Sears
said.
Determinants of success
Over the span of six decades,
Terman, Sears and their co
workers have found a large pro
portion ot the group to be "ex
tremely successful."
As of 1955, the average income
for the group was $33,000, com
pared with a national average of
$8000. As a whole, the group was
above the national average in
both occupational status and
education.
But not all Termites were
successful. "Intelligence was a
necessary but not a sufficient
condition tor certain kinds of
success," Sears said.
One of the key characteristics
ot the most successful Termites
was a high level of ambition.

They were more goal-oriented,
had greater perseverance and
more self-confidence when they
were young than the less suc
cessful Termites.
The most successful subjects
sought work excellence tor its
own sake, not just as a pathway
to success, according to Sears.
The study pointed to length of
schooling as another de
termining factor ot success.
"As I read the (Terman)
data," said Prot. Lee Cronbach,
a consultant on the project, "the
critical matter was the amount
ot schooling received." But this
factor can't be separated from
drive and ambition, he added.
Genius redefined
Despite their overall achieve
ments, Terman's group did not
include any Einsteins or

Beethovens. "Toward the end of
his life, Terman felt that his use
of the term genius to describe
his subjects had been misun
derstood," Sears explained.
When asked to distinguish more
specifically between ex
traordinarily high intelligence
and genius, Sears said, "I
wouldn't even define the word
genius. I think it has been over
used".
In general, psychologists
have come to recognize that in
telligence is not the only compo
nent of genius. Highly in
telligent individuals merely
represent a section of the hu
man race from which genius
may arise. The creative ele
ment of genius may not be
tested for or revealed by an 1Q
test.
Culture bias
IQ tests and standardized
achievement tests have come
under increasing attack as
agents of social bias and inequi
ty.
A recent study commissioned
by Ralph Nader stated Scholas
tic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores
were strongly linked to parental
income. According to the study.
SAT scores were predictive of a
ireshman's performance in only
one out of 10 cases.
Defenders of standardized
testing claim Nader's study un
derestimated the correlation
between SAT scores and first
year grade-point averages. The
Educational Testing Service
claims that the figure ranges
from .3 to 41. Furthermore,
they say the SAT contributes
significantly to the accuracy of
predictions based on high school
grades alone.
Psychologists generally ac
knowledge the problem of cul

tural bias in standardized tes
ting. "Any test based on lan
guage skills is culture-bound.''
stated Sears ' The mean thing
about it."he said, "is that the
(Stanford) Binet is a very good
predictor of how well a child
will do in school "
Several researchers have
begun to put together "culture
free" tests which would com
pensate for bias in language. ,
motivation, competitiveness,
speed, practice in test-taking,
and opportunity. The test mate
rials for these pertormance-ori- ,
ented exams are primarily non- \
verbal and include diagrams or
pictures familiar to the various t
cultural groups tor whom the j
test is intended
However, in a recent book.
Measurement and Evaluation

in Teaching, Norman Gronlund
concludes that culturally neu
tral testing is more an ideal than
reality. "Most attempts to re
move cultural influences from
tests have fallen short of their
goal," Gronlund says.
Cronbach said,"lt just
doesn't make sense to define or
measure ability outside of the
culture that produced it."
Ability vs. intelligence tests
Whereas intelligence tests
were originally designed to pre
dict a child's potential tor learn
ing (and thus his future per
formance in school), an ap
titude test measures current
performance based on learned
abilities.
The SAT, GRE, LSAT. and
MCAT are general tests of abili
ty, according to the Educational
Testing Service. For example,
the SAT tests whether or not a
high school student can com
prehend college textbook mat
ter.
According to Gronlund, any
conclusion concerning capacity
or potential tor learning based
on SAT scores is valid only when
certain conditions have been
met. For example, all pupils
must have had an equal op
portunity to learn the types of
tasks presented in the test.
Future of ability tests
The increasingly prevalent
phenomenon of grade inflation
and the fact that colleges differ
in quality, promote the con
tinued use of standardized gen
eral ability tests.
"Society has to sort people —
it can't place everyone into
medical school." Cronbach
said. "Societies use ability tests
to make their sorting de
cisions," he added.
