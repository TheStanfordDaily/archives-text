# Who is Barney Gould, and how did he ever find out?

Barney Gould is not really an ASSU senator
Neither is the letter which a number of
freshmen received last week, informing them
that the ASSU had established a task force to
investigate possible exaggerations on their
admissions appications, an official com
munication ot the ASSU, though it was typed
on ASSU stationary.
However, "when I first read it I didn't re
alize it was a prank," said Arroyo resident
Sarah Carrel, one recipient of the letter. Oth
ers werealso fooled, at least initially, by the
letter.

"Some of the people who phoned in were
very upset — one girl was even in tears," said
ASSU Senator Mark Epstein.
The letter told of a task force supposedly set
up by the ASSU. which had sent letters to "high
school administrators to verify the truthful
ness ot students' applications About 5 people
subsequently called the ASSU offices, accord
ing to financial manager Cynthia Mathewson.
to inquire about a "task force" meeting
scheduled for Monday at 4 p m.
"It was well-written." said Carrel, but "I
was really offended — it implied that lots of
freshmen had cheated or exaggerated."

"That was not a funny thing to do. and espe
cially coming right before finals week, it
showed extremely poor taste," Epstein said
After a moment's inspection, Carrel said
she realized that the letter could not have been
genuine, as "there was no return address, the
letterhead paper was obviously photocopied,
and the ASSU office confirmed that Barney
Gould was non-existent "
Carrel, the other recipients ot the letter,
and the ASSU then began to hunt for the true
author ot the mailing
"Everyone figures that it was time for
Hammer and Coffin to come out with some

thing." said Mathewson. Others also sus
pected the Chaparral, and it seemed likely af
ter Epstein discovered that the mysterious
Barney Gould is a past president of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society, which publishes the
Chaparral.
However, Chapparal editor Mike Wilkins
said that the humor magizine wasn't involved
in the prank. "That sounds self-destructive at
best. . I don't know who did it or how they got
his (Gould's) name. However, our offices are
always open and we do keep bound volumes of
past issues." He said that the Chaparral has
been working to better its image, and that its

traditional annual prank (the "John Anderson
tor ASSU Senate" posters) had already been
done.
Epstein said he was certain of one thing
"We're in sort of a bind because we can t
prove it was the Chaparral. However, we do
expect a complete mailing list ot all treshmen
who recieved the letter," he said, so the ASSU
can reassure them that we didn't send the let
ters and that no one has been accused of falsi
fying their applications.
"I wonder what Dean (ot Admissions Fred)
Hargadon would think," mused Carrel.
