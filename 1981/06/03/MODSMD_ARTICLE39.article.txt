Israel hits targets in south Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli war planes yesterday staged
their second air raid in five days against suspected
Palestinian targets in south Lebanon in defiance ot Ameri
can entreaties to exercise maximum restraint during the
current Middle East missile crisis.
Local residents said at least six persons were killed and
nine wounded in the 45-minute midday attack at Abul
Aswed just north of the Litani River aiong the Mediter
ranean coast.
Israeli military spokesman said the target was a re
gional headquarters of Fatah, the mainstream guerrilla
outtit headed by overall commando leader Yasser Arafat.
Six U.S. built Phantom F-4 fighter-bombers rocketed a
three-story building and released thermal balloons to de
flect heat-seeking missiles fired from the ground, the resi
dents said.
The Israeli army command in Jerusalem said the Is
raeli pilots reported "accurate hits" on the building,
which was occupied at the time. All of the aircraft re
turned to base, he added.
After a month's interruption due to the missile crisis. Is
rael last Thursday resumed its controversial pre-emptive
strike policy less than 24 hours after U.S. presidential trou
ble-shooter Philip Habib had left Tel Aviv for Washington.
The first attack hit a Libyan-manned missile site near
Beirut.
Poll shows Begin's Likud party ahead
Jerusalem — Riding a surge of popularity that coincided
with the Lebanon missile crisis. Prime Minister Men
achem Begin's Likud bloc moved ahead of the opposition
Labor Alignment in Israel's June 30 election, according to
a new public opinion poll published yesterday.
The poll, commissioned by the English-language -Jeru
salem Past, indicated that if the election were held now.
Likud would win 45 seats while Labor, led by former De
tense Minister Shimon Peres, would take 42 seats in the
'20-member Parliament.
A similar poll conducted a month earlier, before the Is

rael-Syria confrontation over deployment of Soviet-sup
plied anti-aircraft missiles in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley,
showed Likud and Labor in a dead-heat at 4 seats each.
Interviewing for the most recent poll was done last
week, after voters had ample opportunity to consider Be
gin's response to Syrian positioning of SAM-6 missiles in
Lebanon.
The polltakers did not, however, ask voters for their
opinion on the missile crisis. The trend toward Likud and
away from Labor began well before the Jerusalem-Da
mascus confrontation.
The Hebrew-language newspaper Davar reported last
week that a poll conducted about two weeks ago but not yet
published showed that the public was split on the missile
issue.
About half of the respondents were critical of Begin's
handling ot the crisis, according to Davar. and the other
half were displeased with Labor for criticizing the govern
ment on the issue.
Reagan wants Lefever confirmation
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, faced with the
politically embarrassing prospect of having one of his
nominees rejected by the Senate, launched an all-out cam
paign yesterday to win confirmation of Ernest Lefever as
assistant secretary of state for human rights.
The Senate majority leader. Howard Baker iR-Tenn.)
informed the president yesterday that it would take a hard
fight on the Senate floor to win Lefever's confirmation, but
Baker said that he would lead the fight if Reagan wanted to
pursue the nomination.
Reagan did not respond at the time, and Larry Speakes.
the deputy White House press secretary, said that Baker's
comment "did not call for a response." But later, the pres
ident said that he was sticking with Lefever.
Lefever, a critic of the human rights policy practiced by
the Carter administration, has come under attack because
ot a research center that he headed received contributions
from the Nestle Corp., a producer ot baby formula used in
Third World countries

Extra soc. security cuts okayed
Washington — The House Ways and Means Committee,
which last month recommended cutting $2.6 billion out of
Social Security programs, voted yesterday to trim an ex
tra $560 million in benefits.
Affected by the proposed new cuts would be people who
earn money in addition to their Social Security benefits,
people who die without leaving a survivor, and people who
become eligible for Social Security benefits in the middle
of the month.
Reductions endorsed by the committee last month in
cluded a delay in paying one-half of a scheduled 1982 cost
of-living increase, a tour-year phaseout of benefits for col
lege students and elimination of the $122 minimum month
ly payment tor all new beneficiaries.
U.S. nukes were stationed off Japan
Washington — A U.S. Navy ship apparently carrying nu
clear weapons remained off the coast of Japan into the
mid-'96os. at least three years after senior officials in the
Kennedy administration have said they understood the
Pentagon had ordered it to stay clear of Japanese territo
ry.
The USS San Joaquin County, an LST (landing ship,
tank), remained '.00 to 200 yards offshore from the Marine
air base at Iwakuni through '964 and perhaps later, ac
cording to two officers who were stationed on the ship.
The presence of a vessel with a cargo of nuclear weap
ons violated a mutual security treaty that forbade the
United States to deploy nuclear weapons in Japanese terri
tory.

Thousands mourn Bangladesh leader
Dacca, Bangladesh — Hundreds ot thousands of
mourners streamed through the streets ot this crowded,
dirt-poor capital yesterday in a funeral procession tor
slain President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh, and the gov
ernment announced the deaths of three leaders of the
abortive rebellion that took his life.
Zia's death leaves a leadership vacuum that could even
tually lead to a struggle tor power and reduce the degree of
political stability he had established. Bangladeshi and
Western sources said. Combined with a leveling off of in
ternational development aid this year, the sources said,
Zia s murder also casts a gloomy pall over prospects for
continuing the country's painfully slow but steady eco
nomic progress ot recent years.

New York — The stock market staged a broad retreat
yesterday amid conflicting signals on the course of in
terest rates and lingering concern over the tax-cut im
passe between House Democrats and President Ronald
Reagan.

gained 26.24 points over the previous five sessions,
tumbled 0.48 yesterday to close at 987.48.
