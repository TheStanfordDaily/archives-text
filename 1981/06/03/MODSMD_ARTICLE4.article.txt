Things are looking good for Stan
ford Hospital heart-lung transplant
patients Mary Gohlke and Charles
Walker. Gohlke was released from the
hospital Monday and Walker was
transferred from the intensive care
unit to a private room on a general
ward yesterday, according to hospital
officials.
"I'm glad I went through with the
operation," Gohlke said. "I'd do it

again. I've a ways to go before I get
my strength back, but I'm working on
that."
Gohlke, 45, became the world's
fourth heart-lung transplant recipient
85 days ago. The other recipients re
ceived transplants between 1968 and
1971, but none lived for more than 23
days after the operation. A recently
discovered drug, cyclosporin A, great
ly increases the chances that trans

plant recipients will be able to recover
fully and lead a normal life.
"I'm working to get back to my
family, my job." said Gohlke. She was
advertising executive of the Mesa
(Arizona) Tribune. She plans to live in
the Stanford area for two to three
more months so that doctors can
further adjust medication doses and
watch for any signs of rejection of her
new heart and lungs.
Walker, 30, is now in satisfactory
condition and riding an exercise bi
cycle, lifting light weights, and walk
ing up and down stairs in an effort to
build up his strength.
"I'm so thankful for the heart-lung
program," he said. "It hasn't been
easy, but I feel so hopeful. This is
about the best I felt in my life I've
been off oxygen tor days. I feel I ve a
whole new lease on life. The doctor
told me I didn't just get a pair of lungs,
I got a Rolls Royce of lungs."
The operations are the culmination
of more than two years of experimen
tal work on monkeys, conducted by a
cardiovascular team headed by Dr
Bruce Reitz
The operation is still experimental,
said Reitz, and only time and ex
perience will tell if it will be done rou
tinely. For now, he said, the Stanford
team plans to do four of the operations
per year.
Costs for the operation are esti
mated to be between $75,001 and
$100,000, including hospitalization.
