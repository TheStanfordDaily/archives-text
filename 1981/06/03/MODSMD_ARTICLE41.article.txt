"Gloomy job outlook for liberal arts
graduates," (Daily, May 29) con
tained several erroneous figures. The
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter reports that of 946 liberal arts stu
dents and alumni registered at the
CPPC, 44 reported obtaining em
ployment. Including graduate school
enrollees, 66 percent of registrants

were placed.
The May 27 story on the Stanford
Shopping Center also contained an er
roneous figure. The rents collected at
the shopping center range irom $5 to
$40 per square toot per year, not per
month. The Daily regrets the errors.
