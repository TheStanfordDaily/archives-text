# 'Daily' banquet
## 
### 
That long-awaited evening of revel
ry is (finally) here. Meet at the Daily
office at 6 p.m. tonight and we'll
carpool to Mui Kiang, where several
chefs have labored for days to produce

veritable feast for Daily staffers and
their guests. Pay Seth $5 for the privi
lege of attending. No money â€” no
food. And set aside time afterwards to
recall the volume over liquid re
freshments in the finest journalistic
tradition.
