## 
### Carl Johnston 
Anybody who thinks ASSU Guest
Prof. John Anderson doesn't have a
sense of humor should think again, es
pecially after the farewell address he
gave Monday night in Annenberg
auditorium.
"I will never compromise my view
of the intelligence of Stanford stu
dents. but I wish they'd stop asking me
what it was like to star on Mission Im
possible. I'm really getting tired of
walking through White Plaza hearing,
'Man from Glad, Man from Glad,' "
the former Congressman and presi
dential candidate said.
"I've really enjoyed my awesome
stay in California," said Anderson. "It
was like, wow, mellow, and like I real
ly got psyched out by the vibes. I know
it's like hard for Californians to get
turned on by my thrill, Thoreau, who
lived beside a pond all his life without
water skis amd a snorkel, but I still dig
the mellow California atmosphere."
According to his daughter, Diane
Anderson, the former Congressman

was "just tired of giving speeches
about the same old serious stuff. He
wanted do something different."
"He's had a reputation for being a
professor and giving lectures where
the subject matter was really dry. He
wanted a change .... It was no big
deal."
"I know that when he was offered
the (ASSU) guest professorship (last
January) he was very excited. He
likes young people, and it meant a lot
for him to be here."
Other topics addressed in the
speech included the former can
didate's "frustrated" efforts to be
come a senator — of the ASSU. He also
talked about his losing battle against
Kennedy — President Donald Ken
nedy — to become president of Stan
ford.
Anderson gave the crowd of over 00
people gathered to hear the final
speeches of ASSU Guest Profs. Andre
Burnett, David Brower and Anderson
some of the benefit of his political ex
perience:

'' Do you ever get the feeling that the
only reason we have elections is to find
out if the polls were right 9 When a fel
low you know in school knows nothing
and thinks he knows everything, send
him into a political career."
According to John Halamka, An
derson's research assistant, Anderson
wanted to give a speech that would
leave a mark at Stanford. Many of
those who attended the lecture were
apparently impressed, giving him a
standing ovation.
"He wanted the speech to have an
intimacy that couldn't be achieved if
he gave a more formal speech,"
Halamka said. With that in mind,
Halamka, who has been Anderson's
research assistant this quarter and
was a member of the Guest Pro
fessorship Board that named An
derson to the post, wrote the speech
along with freshman Trey Ellis.
"We wrote it. He (Anderson) read
it, and loved it," said Halamka. "He
told me he never had so much fun with
a speech before."
