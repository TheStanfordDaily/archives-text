# AIAW tennis starts today

### Steve Odell 
After a two-week lay-off, the Stanford women's tennis
team will open up the 198 AIAW National tennis cham
pionships with the No. 15 ranked Arizona Wildcats today at
4 p.m. PDT, in Tempe. The team competition runs through
next Saturday, and the individual goes half for four days
alter that The Cards, seeded second heading into the tour
ney. will be aiming for their first national title since 1978,
when they had Kathy Jordan, Diane Morrison, and Susie
Hagey.
But like a hurdler running in a grueling four-day mara
thon, Stanford will have many obstacles in their quest to
duplicate the men's feat ot being able to lay claim to being
the best team in the land.
The main obstacle to the title for the Cards will be, of
course, USC, now gunning for their third straight AIAW
championship. The Trojans have won 64 straight dual
matches, boast a 30-0 record on the season, and have
dumped the Cardinals three times already this year.
But Stanford coach Frank Brennan has other worries as
well. For one, there's the injury status ot his club. Elise
Burgin, just starting to recover from a pinched nerve in
her back, suffered a neck injury on Monday. Susy Jaeger
has been hampered by sore teet all year long. And Michelle
Weiss was on her back in bed for a week and a half with
pneumonia.
Then there's the weather. The Arizona temperature was
supposed to be up to around 110, but it has only been a
"cool" 100 thus far this week. Playing four matches in four
days is hard enough, especially in the sizzling Arizona sun.
And finally, there's the three matches the Cards have to
win simply to get the chance to play the Trojans for the
title. If they win their opening match, the Cards would
probably then face Miami, then third-seeded UCLA in the
semi-finals before attempting to end the Trojans three
year dominance ot the sport.
But the situation is far from bleak. "It'd be a tremen
dous upset if we do it," acknowledged Brennan. "But ev
eryone is playing well. I'm optimistic. I'm very happy with
where we are right now."
Brennan sees the two weeks off as beneficial to his
squad. "It's been good for us," he said. "Health has been
our main problem, and it's allowed us to rest up. We're
close enough to the end of the season, so we're not going to
get out of shape that much, either."
The Cardinal health report reads like this : Elise Burgin
— In her words, she's "ninety" percent. "I can still feel
the neck," she said from her hotel room in Tempe, "but I'll
be OK. I would have to wake up tommorrow and not be able
to move at all, before I wouldn't play."
Susy Jaeger — optimism here, also. "She's playing very
well right now," said Brennan. "Her injury's a little more
complicated, though, so I'd term her status as 'limited
duty.' She'll probably play either singles or doubles, but
not both."
Jaeger is looking forward to the chance to play. "It (the
toot) is better than it has been," said Jaeger last night.

"but it's definitely not 100 percent. It's hard because 1
haven't been playing a lot But considering that tor awhile,
I was wondering it I would even make it down here, I'm
happy. Hopefully, everybody will be healthy to give us the
best shot at it."
Michelle Weiss — most likely she will not see action
"She's practicing again," Brennan said, "but whether
she'll be able to get into any kind of shape or not, I just
don't know. She's still very weak."
As tor the heat, Stanford's second year coach doesn't
teel that it will present any grave problems for the Cards,
either. "I don't think it'll have any effect," he said. "For
one thing, everybody else will have to play in it. And this
team is composed of players who have played all over the
world, in all types of climates. They shouldn't be bothered
by it."
Then there are the Cards' opponents. Assuming they get
by the tirst two rounds, which they should, Stanford would
face the women from Westwood in the semi-finals.
The Bruins are 23-4 on the year, with a couple of losses
each to Stanford and Southern Cal. They have also beaten
Stanford once, in Los Angeles, 6-2. Brennan called the
match-up "pretty much dead even."
UCLA is led by No. 1 singles player Kathrin Keil, who
sports an excellent 25-2 record, her only two losses being to
the Carinals' Alycia Moulton and USC's No. 1, Anna Maria
Fernandez. Only a freshman, she will be the number one
seed in the individual part of the tournament.
Bruin coach Gayle Godwin also sees the competition as
a toss-up. "It's basically going to come down to whatever
team is a little physically stronger and able to stand up bet
ter in the heat," she said.
Brennan plans to go with the revamped doubles align
ment he used two weeks ago when Stanford swept the pairs
competition at the Farm from the Bruins. This includes
Burgin and Moulton at No.', Caryn Copeland and Donna
Rubin in the No. 2 position, and Gayle Chan and either Susy
Jaeger (it she is able) or Sue Rasmussen plugging at the
No. 3 slot.
Godwin has made some changes for the national tourney
in her doubles line-up as well. Kathy O'Brien and Helena
Manset, who previously played at No. 2, have been moved
up to No.l; Ann Henricksson is being paired up with
freshman Karen Dewis at N0.2, and Keil, who usually
plays with Henricksson at one, is being moved down to No.
3 to team with Shelly Solomon (Harold's sister).
"I think it balances our teams out a little better." God
win explained. "It splits up Ann and Keil and gives us a lit
tle more strength all down the line."
If and when the Cards beat the Bruins, can they begin to
worry about USC. "It'll take a great effort from ev
erybody," said Brennan, explaining what he thinks it will
take to upset the Trojans. "We're not outclassed at any
position, though, and they all could go either way. We
could win all six or lose all six. Obviously, that won't hap
pen, but there's not any match that we can't win."
