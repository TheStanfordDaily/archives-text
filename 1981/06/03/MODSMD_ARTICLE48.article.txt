# Brooks will sign with Rangers
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” Herb Brooks,
who guided the 1980 United States
Olympic hockey team to a gold medal,
has agreed to contract terms to coach
the New York Rangers of the National
Hockey League.
Although the Rangers would not
confirm the agreement. The As
sociated Press learned Monday that
the team will announce the hiring of
Brooks later this week.
Brooks, 43, will work under Rangers
Director of Operations Craig Patrick
who, ironically, was Brooks' assistant
on the Olympic team.
Patrick took over as coach of the
Rangers on Nov. 22, 1980 when Fred

Shero resigned, but was reluctant to
continue in both roles. He actively
sought Brooks to coach the team for
several weeks following Shero's resig
nation, but Brooks was unable to get a
release from his contract as coach of
an amateur club in Davos. Switzer
land. And the Rangers played well un
der Patrick, making a surprising run
to the Stanley Cup semifinals after fin
ishing 13th in the overall league stand
ings.
Patrick, who reportedly earned less
than $100,0)0 as coach-director of op
erations last season, had expressed a
desire to hire a coach prior to next
week's NHL entry draft. It is likely
that Brooks will command a salary at

least equal to what Patrick makes as
front office boss of the Rangers.
Prior to the Lake Placid Olympics,
Brooks' major coaching achieve
ments were at the University of Min
nesota. He led the Gophers to three
NCAA titles in seven seasons.
Brooks is a disciplinarian who
works his players hard in practice in
order to have them fully prepared for
games. He also is known for being
aloof and not a strong communicator.
That type of coaching style, some
NHL people have said, could cause
him problems in dealing with pro
fessional athletes. Others have noted,
though, that Brooks has gotten results
wherever he has coached.
