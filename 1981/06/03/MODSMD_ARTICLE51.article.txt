## Get Cards back in Roses: how to cheat your way to Pasadena 
### 
As I have been strolling around the Stanford campus
the past few days, trying to avoid collisions with coeds
on rollerskates and trying desperately to find out if any
ot the new Dollies speak English, I have been giving
much thought to the big issue that confronts your
school. This, incidentally, is not ethnic housing, despite
all the breathtaking editorials in the Daily. Nor is it the
question ot whether the athletes around here should be
nicknamed the Cardinals or the Stanford Tontos.
There is only one thing that really counts around
here, now that the interior decorators have finished
with Andy Geiger's office and the Beta-Max is hooked
up, enabling Andy to tape (General Hospital every after
noon. 1 am referring to the problem ot getting the Ton
tos. uh. Cards into another Rose Bowl.
I would think that the surest way to do this would be
cheating, one of the things that has always made col
lege sports great.
There is far too much emphasis on academics at
Stanford, and not enough on the more challenging area
of cheating. From my discussions around campus —
you have to get people to take the Sony Walk-Man ear
phones out to hare a discussion — it seems that students
spend too much time aspiring to be the Harvard of the
West when, in fact, you should really want to be the USC
ot the North.

1 don't think that the Tontos should have to tax them
selves on such thrilling courses as Humor in Com
munications, Latin American History, and Sociology-I.
You have just got to use the USC Method if you want to
get back to the Rose Bowl. There have got to be more
courses where credits come out ot a garage in Encino.
A slush fund would be good, too. Bring in some outlaw
tackles who can't spell Kansas.
Once you get past the first million dollar deficit for
an athletic program, my thought is this: what's another
$500,000? It's time for Stanford to start using the im
aginative bookkeeping they use at USC.
We're talking about priorities here. If you want to
compete with NFL franchises like the Trojans — why
does A 1 Davis want to bring pro football back to the Los
Angeles Coliseum when it's already there? — it's time
for some creativity around the athletic department.
It's basically time to cheat.
Along these lines, I have a few suggestions:
TRANSCRIPT DOCTORING: You do run some
risks here, as we found out last season when the Pacif
ic- 0 shrunk to the Pac-5. If a few more schools take out
their erasers, we could be discussing the Pac-None next
season but, what the heck? Take a chance.
Transcript doctoring is fun, once you get the hang of
it. You can play at home. The whole family can join in
It's really easy, for example, to turn a "3" into an "8."

Or an "F" into an "A."
As Dick Vermeil, the old UCLA coach once said,
•'There are a lot worse things (than doctoring a tran
script) Dick Vermeil went to a Rose Bowl. Dick Ver
meil went to a Super Bowl.
Anyway, it's something to think about.
A NHW ATHI.KTIC STUDY PROGRAM: I don't
know about you. but as a passionate Tonto fan. I don't
want John Elway wasting his time on such course as
Ideas and Technology in Western Culture. I want his
mind clear to read a zone, and see a blitz coming To
that end. here are some new courses I think Tonto foot
ball players should be taking:
1 ) General Hospital-101. All you have to do to audit
this course is watch the show every afternoon, the way
Andy does There will be an essay final If you can fig
ure out what is going to happen with Luke and Laura,
you pass.
2.) The Dutch Goose. Keep a diary on your pleasant
evenings there. Describe the elegant decor. Play some
pinball It John Anderson can play pinball at the Goose,
so can Darrin Nelson. We'll go pass tail on this one. At
least once during the semester, you've got to earn a
free pinball game.
3.) Fake ID's. This will serve as a science course.
Take your own picture. Laminate those babies. If you

can run your ID past a waitress at the Sundance Mining
Company at the end of the semester, you pull an A.
4 i Windsurfing. I would think this one is self-ex
planatory
•H'.Xlnß Cdl.l.KdE TR.W'SFERS I want guys
who can't get past writing their names correctly on the
College Boards. I want big people who think good clean
frat fun is bench pressing a coed. I want somedetensive
oacks who are probably wanted in five states. I want
running backs who learned their tricky moves stealing
hubcaps and purses.
There are those with crude minds that might see par
allels with USC here.
FR. \NK Kl 'SH Bring him in as an assistant to Paul
Wiggin. We've got to start building men around here.
Have Kush cuft a tew guys around Slap some punters.
Pull Elway's hair
Remember Frank Kush won a lot of games at Arizo
na State.
I think all of this is something to build on.
Tell the Dollies I'll see them in Pasadena. Go Tontos.
