# Shines in first year at the Farm
## Only the beginning for freshman Lyons 
### Margie Neasham 
Ellen Lyons began running in 977 to
lose weight and improve her tennis
game.
Last weekend she went to Austin,
Texas to represent Stanford in the
AIAW National Track Cham
pionships.
She began by running three miles a
day and lost 30 pounds. The goal then
became to improve her running ability
so she could beat her 3-year old sister
in a race around the golf course in her
hometown in Idaho. Lyons improved
far beyond that goal. She is now one of
the best women distance runners in
the nation.
The Stanford women's track coach.
Laurel Treon, called Lyons one of the
strongest runners she has ever had the
chance to work with. "She's excep
tionally talented, extremely dedi
cated, and very competitive." Treon
said

As a competitor and a sports-wom
an, Treon commented that "Ellen is
respected by her teammates tor her
ability, comraderie, and her sense of
humor.
Her friends admire her for her wit
as well as talent, though they hear
very little from her about the latter.
"We never know when or where she is
racing, or how well she has done,"
commented roommate Carol Shapiro.
"Humble" was the word most fre
quently used by her friends.
Dedicated is another adjective that
kept coming up in conversations about
Lyons. She runs 10 to 12 miles a day
during the running seasons (both cross
country and track) and 10- 8 miles
during the summer. Her diet pre
cludes meat, but she that she eats a lot
of everything else. At 5-foot-7, 120
pounds, it is hard to imagine that she
eats as much as she suggests.
Lyons was one of the top female run

ning recruits in the nation in 980, af
ter winning the Kinney National High
School Cross Country championships
At Stanford she has shattered course
and stadium records. The freshman
has also improved one thing that de
tracts from her talent — her form
"It's my arm, it just doesn't do what
it's supposed to." she explained.
Besides correcting her style, the
main goal Lyons has is simply "to gain
more speed." She already runs the
mile in 4:53 and the 10,0)0 meters in a
little over 34 minutes. Her idol?
Former Oregon distance runner Steve
Pretontaine.
Although Lyons says that she thinks
publicity is "0.K.," her sister,
Shirley, would tend to disagree
"When Ellen was just beginning to
gain recognition in Boise, a big story
came out abouut her entitled Ellen
Lyons — A symbol of what running can
do.' When Ellen first saw it in the

morning, she cried Oh no.' and locked
herself in the bathroom for an hour "
Unlike many athletes. Lyons would
rather just run and compete than have
the crowds and the pomp and circum
stance around She loves the competi
tion, but she loves the training at least
as much.
As is the case for most distance
runners, her chief competition is
herself. Last weekend, though, she
faced some of the United States' best
runners — the Shea sisters, Betty Joe
Springs, and teammate Kim
Schnurpfeil in the AIAW National
track meet Unfortunately, Lyons de
veloped a sideache and finished a dis
appointing eleventh in the 10,003.
Still, she has come a long way.
From an overweight tennis player to
one of the best runners in the nation in
a little over three years. That is quite
a distance to travel, and Ellen Lyons
has put in the miles to prove it.
