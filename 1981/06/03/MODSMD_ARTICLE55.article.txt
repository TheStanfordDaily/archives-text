# Sexist softballers down 'Daily'
## 
### ASSU 
After being portrayed (and not without cause
ed.) as an impotent organization for the entire
year, the ASSU called out The Stanford Daily last
Saturday for a final showdown on the softball field
to demonstrate the relative strength of each or
ganization.
Asserting their newly found unity, the ASSU
proved itself to be a powerhouse by humiliating
the wimpy Daily Hacks by a score of 26-8
Emotions ran high as these two teams took the
field in their first direct showdown of the new ad
ministrations. The stakes were big: an ASSU
written article describing the game against a Dai
ly written resolution adopted by the ASSU Senate
and endorsed by the Council ot Presidents.
Due to their typically unreliable sources, the
Hacks were entirely unprepared to face the un
relenting superiority of the ASSU team. Led by a
barrage ot home runs and extra base hits, the
ASSU team, which contained only males in notice
able contrast to the more aesthetically pleasing
Daily squad, broke open an 8-7 ballgame in a dis
play ot power that could neither be misin
terpreted nor misquoted, even by the dull-witted

Hacks.
The onslaught continued after the Hacks re
fused an opportunity to succumb with respect
ability to the ten-run slaughter rule, thus resulting
in the lopsided score And all this happened de
spite efforts by the Hacks to first change the size
ot the ball and later alter the distance between the
basepaths. (Distance between hasepaths' Ir\
bases — ed.)
The unbeatable ASSU team was carefully
chosen from a field of high-powered, strong
willed and dedicated servants of the Stanford stu
dent community, under the managerial direction
of Bambi Markel. Mariann Byerwalter. Tracy
Minkin. Cynthia Matthewson and Caroline Cheng
(none of u ho managed to make it to the actual
name ed.) The players were: Tom Kohn. Andy
Benn. Phil Holland. Kevin Aoyama, Jim
Grundberg. Mike Reilly. Dave Phelps, Dragan
Popov and Fred Buhl.
Afterwards, there was rejoicing and celebra
tion at the ASSU office, where copies of the Daily
Hack were spread across the floor to mop up
spilled champagne. <Can't take any more of this
