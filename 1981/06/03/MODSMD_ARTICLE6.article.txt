# More minorities, women to teach
## 
### Peter Finch 
Five new women professors, includ
ing two with tenure, have been hired
tor the 198 -1982 academic year. In ad
dition, five members of minority
groups and two women already on the
faculty will be given tenure next year,
according to Provost Albert Hastorf.
"We're not through tor the season,
either," Hastorf said. "We hope there
are more (new faculty recruits) com
ing down the line."
Stanford now has 98 women in what
Hastort called "tenure track" ap
pointments, twice the number in 1970.
At present, 38 women here have
tenure, compared to a total of 24 a dec
ade ago.
Additionally, 76 minority group fac
ulty members are eligible for tenure,
compared with 50 in 1972. Today there
are 49 tenured minority professors
here, there were 20 in 1972.
Hastorf gave credit to several task
forces set up by then-Provost Donald
Kennedy for helping improve the fig
ures.
'Vigorous' searches important
"They were a great help," he said,
adding that the most important aspect
ot any affirmative action program is
"conducting vigorous and thorough
searches."
"The eligible pool can be very small
in some of these cases and you've got
to look very hard for possible can
didates," he said.
Linguistics Prot. Elizabeth
Traugott chaired one ot Kennedy's
task forces. It was the official purpose
of her group, she said, "to identify sen
ior women (at other universities) who
might possibly be good additions to
our faculty."

Women taculty were heavily re
cruited, she said, because "ol the
some 72 faculty members given tenure
between 974 and 1979, only two were
women We found that to be somewhat
of an imbalance
Traugott said she wasn't certain
that this year's hirings were a direct
result of her task force's work, but
that they might have come as an in
direct result.
"(We created) a lot of discussion on
the subject," she said. ' We wanted a
general feeling (in all departments)
that when you have a quality can
didate for a position, you ought to go
out and get it."
Affirmative action programs
"backfire if you just go alter token x's
and y's," she said. ' But we put quality
as a first priority and affirmative ac
tion as a second."
The creation of a University Com
mittee on Faculty Affirmative Action
headed by Psychiatry Prof. Arthur
Bienenstock and the selection ot af
firmative action representatives from
each department should help the proc
ess in the future, she said.
Bienenstock agreed that his com
mittee would be helpful, but declined
to give any specific actions it will
take.
"We plan to report next fall to the
Faculty Senate," he said. ' Right now
we're in the middle ot deliberations,
discussing a number ot possible plans
for the University, but it's a bit pre
mature to give any examples now."
The 1980-1981 academic year has
been "steady" tor minority graduate
student enrollment here, according to
Vice-Provost for Graduate Studies
Gerald Lieberman.
