## L'Heureux the writer emerges 
### Mike Hale 
About halfway between the
Hoover Institution and the Engi
neering building sits the office
from which John L'Heureux
directs the English Dept.'s
Creative Writing Program.
L'Heureux writes, too, when he
can take the time away from ad
ministering and teaching (he's
an associate professor of Eng
lish), but the fact that he has
published 10 works of poetry and
fiction in the last 17 years seems
to be a secret well kept from the
University at large.
L'Heureux's 10th book, a col
lection of short stories titled De
sires, appeared last month, and
it is so good that it should outlive
any productions of the English
Dept.'s more notorious neigh
bors. But fiction's public image
being what it is, and tastes at
Stanford being what they are,
you may never hear the book
mentioned outside the Quad (or
the Bookstore, where you should
go immediately and buy a
copy). So it is with a certain
sense of public mission that I un
dertake this review.
There are any number of rea
sons why students here would
enjoy reading Desires. One
story. "Brief Lives in Califor
nia," is a slice from the life of a
Stanford undergraduate; anoth
er involves a female statistics
professor at a "major West
Coast university" who has af
fairs with students and does
kinky things in swimming pools.
The empathic possibilities are
endless. And if L'Heureux's
work attains legitimacy in aca
demic circles, as it certainly de
serves to. Desires will be emi
nent term paper fodder, with its
allusions to and parallels with
Wallace Stevens, Katharine
Perkins Gilman, Boethius, etc.
Beyond all this, however, lies
the best reason ot all: the sheer
pleasure of reading prose as
well-crafted as L'Heureux's.
L'Heureux achieves, in many
of these stories, a marvelous
combination of immediacy and
detachment; at the same time
as he makes us completely rec

ognize, and live in, a character,
he is far above the story, analyz
ing the character and his life.
Reading the stories, you feel
that you are undergoing this
analysis yourself. It can be a
harrowing experience. In one of
the collection's best stories,
"The Anatomy of Bliss," a
woman expresses her unhappi
ness and insecurity by covering
the inside walls of her house
with meaningless writing. The
story, a modern, third person
version of Oilman's "The Yel
low Wallpaper," told in a series
of vignettes (resembling
Oilman's diary entries) is just
as frightening and convincing as
that feminist classic.
Perhaps the best story in De
sires is "The Priest's Wife."
Subtitled "Thirteen Ways of
Looking at a Blackbird," it
gives glimpses ot a former
priest's marriage to, separation
from, and reconciliation with a
woman who has "a face like a
woman in a novel,"and wants to
write novels herself; the
glimpses take the form of thir
teen numbered sections, each of
which has some connection to
the mood, or language, or idea
of the corresponding section ot
the Wallace Stevens poem. The
device works, and the story a a
whole is a minor miracle of
style. The 13th section begins:
"Time passed for them.
There may have been children,
a boy and a girl, adopted. There
may have been a dog. There
may have been. . but the snow
falls and everything recedes
into uncertainty, except that we
die and we do not wish to die.
"'lt's snowing,' she said.
'"And it's going to snow,' he
said."
Everything works together —
the tone, the texture of the
prose, the direct allusion to
Stevens — to pull the reader
toward an epiphany typical of
L'Heureux's short fiction.
Not all of the stories are as
successful as these two. The
stories in Desires fall into two
groups; one group, of which
"The Anatomy of Bliss" is typi

cal, consists of stories involving
straightforward, realistic char
acters living slightly bizarre, or
at least out of the ordinary,
lives: Morgan Childs, the
statistics professor in "Wit
ness," who develops the stig
mata on her wrists, or Gene Sul
livan in "Answered Prayers,"
who is possessed by the priest he
kills in a car wreck. These
stories themselves could hardly
be called typical American re
alism, but they achieve their
rather surreal quality through a
judicious selection of details
from the real. On the other
hand, there are stories such as
"Roman Ordinary," in which
Pope Paul VI does a sword
dance above his own bones ev
ery night, and"The Anatomy of
Desire," about a soldier whose
skin is peeled off by the enemy.
These stories are parables, and
in them L'Heureux is trying to
express many of the same
things as in the more realistic
stories, but the expression
doesn't seem as effective.
A point that must be raised is
the importance of the Catholic
religion to L'Heureux's fiction.
I hesitate to raise it, because I
know nearly nothing about the
rituals of the Catholic church or
the tenets of (strictly) Catholic
thought, yet I enjoyed Desires,
so in one sense it isn't really im
portant; but in an absolute sense
it is crucial, especially in the
"parable" stories. L'Heureux
was a Jesuit for 16 years, leav
ing the Society in '970 (he was
ordained a priest in '966), and
his years of intensive training in
philosophy and theology work
their way into everything he
writes. Catholicism is present
either explicitly, in the form of
nuns and priests, or implicitly,
or both, in nearly all of these
stories. This may be why I don't
respond equally to all af them;
there are levels to L'Heureux's
fiction which are inaccessible to
me (and would be to most peo
ple), and I have no way of telling
whether they are worth plumb
ing or not. I suspect that they
are.
