# Human oddities: yours, mine, Chappie's

Psychologists are fond of
saying that humor results from
"an uninterrupted defense
mechanism" — in other words,
we only laugh at the people and
things we feel smugly superior
to; we laugh at, not with. The
editors of the "human oddities"
issue of the Chaparral have ar
rived at very much the same
conclusion in this issue's in
troduction:
When someone laughs at a
joke about someone poor, or
stupid, or crippled, there is no
malice in the laughter. It is
pure, it is wholesome. There is
laughter, not to hide a secret in
adequacy, but to exalt and af
firm the spirit.
Indeed, the popularity of
"college humor," of magazines
like the Chappie and National
Lampoon, is based on the pre
mise that no subject is exempt
from the slings and arrows of
outrageous parody. Racism,
sexism, obscenity, drugs,
masturbation, kinky sex (espe
cially kinky sex) — nothing is
taboo in humor magazines. The
only stipulation is that there
must be some weary stereotype
to work over, a redneck, a nym
phomaniac or a nigger to insult,
so we can feel safely and secret
ly superior.
Macmuffin, a fast-food trag
edy in three acts, is a deft
parody of Shakespeare's Mac
beth, and unlike the Chappie's
regular brand of humor, it suc
ceeds without resorting to infan
tile jokes about sex, violence or
alcohol. Macmuffin works, first
of all, by appealing to a common
high school experience, our
struggle with the pomposity and
ponderous language of
Shakespeare; and it also dis
parages something that we all
love to sneer at, fast food. Then,
there's the juxtaposition of two
outrageously dissimilar ele
ments, Shakespeare and
McDonald's, and the pun of
Macbeth/ Mcmuffin. Not to
mention a fine job by author Jay
Martel of mating fast-food im
agery with Elizabethan blank
verse ("Would that I had a
small coke with which to wash
the guilt of cheesy trech'ry"),
and clever punning with
McDonald's slogans: "We do it

all for you, arched ambition "
Great stuff, and the dialogue be
tween Macmulfin and Lady
Filet O'Fish is by itself worth
the price of an issue:
MAC Lady Filet!/ How fares
my tender fish sandwich?
LAI), (iolden brown, my Lord,
with the news of late./
And has thou heard?
With Mavor McCheese/

Have we for lunch been
order'd.
MAC. Tis true then. But dar'st
I yank the/ Sweating pat
ty from its limp bun ?/ No,
I cannot. Tis too foul a
deed/ For a light snack
such as I to perform.
Alas, the rest of the issue isn't
nearly so funny, and much of it
is completely irrelevant to the
theme of human oddities. They
might have called it the "Beach
Blanket Bingo issue'' tor all the
connection that "human od
dities" has with a moronic piece
called "Green Asphalt," ap
parently about vegetables run
over on highways, or with
Blame I r s Magazine, a silly and

uninspired parody of Us maga
zine. Hlame Us tails on two
levels: a magazine parody
works only if it satirizes the ma
terial of the target publication,
and Hlame Us is a magazine de
voted to the people who cause
disasters like plane crashes and
major black-outs. Where's the
logical connection to Us? Also,
the graphic design of Hlame Us

is so unrealistic and so unlike
that of the real Us, it takes a
very careful reader to discover
that it's supposed to be a maga
zine parody at all. The one
amusing article is about Harold
Transgorian, the only high
school senior to score a perfect
'600 on the SAT, because all the
questions are about his favorite
TV shows and the contents of his
bureau drawers; but what does
it have to do with either Blame
l r s or human oddities?
The two forays into fiction.
"Oxbow" (a wrestler's son who
doesn't want to be a wrestler)
and "Another Hiller" (some
thing about "spontaneous disin
tegration"), are so far from

making any kind of point, funny
or otherwise, that it seems the
authors had nothing in mind
when they wrote them
There is, thankfully, another
bright spot in the issue, a comic
strip called "Don Mallard" that
tor once has something to do
with human oddities. It's a
sleazy re-telling of the Walt Dis
ney story, and Don Mallard is a
bum with an enormous Donald
Duck mouth who is hired with a
bunch of other malformed
street characters to dress up
like animals and parade around
in G-rated movies I'm not sure
what the point ot all this is sup
posed to be, but the dialogue by
Doug Steiner is funny and natu
ralistic, and the art by Bruce
Handy is at least up to the stan
dards of National Lampoon's
"funny papers." Of course, this
is the kind of humor where
you're laughing at someone less
fortunate than you, but what the
hell — it's still funny.
Perry Vasquez's new-wave
graphics are clean and interest
ing, if not always an appropriate
reflection of the issue's content.
I do get tired of crayoned photos
(a la Andy Warhol or Saturday
Night Live), and sometimes it
looks so ludicrous that it's ac
tually funny, as in the crudely
retouched photos in "Dorian
Gray's Scrapbook" which
wouldn't be nearly so funny if
they were more realistic. It's a
bit unfortunate that the two
most attractive things in the is
sue are the full-color cover and
the art deco Wet Magazine ad,
neither of which were done by
Stanford students (Derek
Mueller, the artist who did the
cover, graduated last year).
The outside of the issue looks
great, though.
As Robert Benchly said, de
fining and analyzing humor is a
pastime ot humorless people, so
I'll let you make your own de
cision as to whether the "human
oddities" issue is worth a buck
or not.
For my part, although I think
Chaparral is inclined to treat its
issues as vast inside jokes pub
lished and promoted at student
expense, I'm forced to admire
them for their brash, unswerv
ing determination and occasion
al sparks of brilliance.
