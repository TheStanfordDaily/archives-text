## Magic's 'Hotel' is best play to come along in months 
### Stephen Nash 
It's tempting to just say that
Memory Hotel" by Wolfgang
Bauer is the most exciting piece
of theatre to come along in
months. Ideally, nothing more
should be said, since any de
scription of the play is bound to
destroy some of the pleasure of
seeing it. The thrill of unravell
ing all its mysteries shouldn't be
undercut any more than is
absolutely necessary.
"Memory Hotel" explores
the memory ot a man named
Toni. who is staying in a luxury
hotel in Jamaica. He had been
told that he was dying of cancer,
and he was spending the last
part of his life enjoying himself
Something traumatic happened
to him. but he can't remember
what it was. and all he has left
are fragments of memories.
These fragments — a room-ser
vice breakfast, a party, a phone
call — flash through his head
again and again, not always in
chronological order. His memo
ry tor facts is not perfect,
either, a repeated fragment is

often slightly changed at each
reappearance — through slight
variations in dialogue, in the
position of a piece of furniture,
in the movements of the charac
ters. etc
There's also the problem that
Tom confuses similar events
which are not necessarily re
lated Independent incidents
blend into one another, creating
resonances through parallel im
agery. As the play continues,
the audience is gradually able to
come up with an explanation ot
what happened In that sense it
is a magnificent mystery story
But it's also an exploration ot
human memory, with all its
fascinating unpredictability.
"Memory Hotel" is currently
having its first English lan
guage production at the Magic
Theatre. The Magic Theatre has
produced other plays by Bauer,
the most recent being "Magnet
ic Kisses" and "Shakespeare
the Sadist." "Memory Hotel''
was translated by Martin and
Renata Esslin.
Bauer is a member ot the

Graz group ot Austrian writers,
of whom the best known is Peter
Handke (author ot "The Left-
Handed Woman"). The group
forms an important part of the
thriving cultural life in Germa
ny and Austria today. Many
young authors are bringing their
left-wing political and social
ideas into their work, and are
using form and style ag
gressively to cut through the
complacency of their au
diences.
Bauer was first noticed in the
sixties with his second play.
"Magic Afternoon" — a stoned,
sexually violent interlude with
four bored young people. From
the start, he has been an
abrasive writer, making ex
tensive use of street language,
casually portraying violence
and sex, and having a con
siderable contempt for the au
dience.
In this current work, the
coarseness, sexuality, and vio
lence still remain; but the con
tempt seems to have softened
Instead ot disdaining the au
dience. the play challenges by
avoiding a conventional plot and
a fixed set of events.
The techniques have many
parallels in literature. The most
deliberate seems to be the "new
novel" of Robbe-Grillet. Espe
cially similar is his book "The
Labyrinth." In it. a soldier must

deliver a package in a city
where one street corner looks
very like another As a result, it
is unclear whether the soldier is
going in circles, whether he is
someplace new, or whether a
scene is being described a sec
ond time. Robbe-Grillet also ex
ploits separate but overlapping
images. For example, the pic
ture described at the beginning
of the book is of a later scene
from the soldier's travels, and
the distinction between the two
is heavily blurred. All these par
allels in imagery, and the par
allels between the structure ot
the novel and the structure of
the town, make form the princi
ple subject of Robbe-Grillet's
novels. A sense ot what is hap
pening. both in terms of struc
ture and in terms of plot, only
emerges toward the end of the
books.
More familiar (but tar more
accidental) is the conventional
mystery story. Here the crime
occurs at the beginning, often
very much out ot context and
with many details unexplained.
Only as the suspects are ques
tioned, with their conflicting
perceptions of the crime, does
any real story emerge. And only
at the very end is the full ex
planation ot the events given.
It is certainly no accident that
Robbe-Grillet and Bauer (in
this play, at least) choose plots

which, in a more conventional
form, could easily be mysteries.
The basic materials are the
same in both, only the change in
emphasis between form and
content distinguishes them.
Robbe-Grillet and Bauer use
distinctive but flexible images
as motits, and weave them to
gether into larger structures
which resonate in our minds and
which gradually evoke more
and more evocative interpreta
tions of the story. This is very
similar to the way in which a
Sonata movement is put togeth
er in a classical symphony. Both
of them also turn time in on
itself, so that there is no restric
tion on how events can be paired

together, thus allowing the reso
nances to be more powerfully
emphasized.
The major distinction be
tween Bauer and Robbe-Grillet
is in point of view. Robbe-
Grillet's novels are highly ob
jective. often just a sequence of
cool, detailed descriptions,
much as it seen at a distance
through a zoom lens. In con
trast. "Memory Hotel" is com
pletely subjective, being the
record of a man's memory to
gether with all its prejudices
and factual errors.
The feeling for structure is
carried over into the sound
track (designed by Marian
Wilde). The music and sound ef

fects suggest images and events
(such as a storm, the ocean, or a
party) which are sometimes un
related to the current action on
stage, but refer instead to
events in other sections of the
play. Even the music used
before the play begins is signifi
cant. It is slow, jazz tune which
is played again and again, and
which appears late in the play
during the party scene as a fea
ture of the story.
"Memory Hotel" was
directed by John Lion, the gen
eral director of the Magic
Theatre. Throughout, the play
maintains its momentum and
its sense of mystery.
