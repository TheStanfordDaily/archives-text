# Rooftop single due
## 
### David Schmelzer 
One of several popular Stanford bands is making a move to
widen its base. Most of the members of Rooftop Magic are
graduating this year and they've decided to make giving the
band a shot at success the tirst priority ot their lite in the real
world. As a part of that effort, they've cut their first single.
"Strange New Birds." which will be released by Third Rail
liecords on June 7 and should be available in stores around the
Stanford area.
The song, and its flip side "Highly Hopeful." both have a
'60s sound, with a vocal style not unlike that of Peter, Paul,
and Mary. Both songs here have lead vocals by a woman
(Leslie Moulton, who even sounds a bit like Mary) and harmo
nies by men on the choruses. Rooftop Magic is straight
forward instrumentallv, with two guitars, a bass, a piano, and
drums, although they did add what song-writer guitarist Jim
Ferrell calls "little experiments that seemed to work" on
"Strange New Birds" â€” using "backwards guitar, funny
echoes, and piano noises." Ferrell notes that '60s remakes
and even some originals from that time are very popular now
as a reponse to new wave. Although he considers Rooftop
Magic a straight rock n' roll band, he says. "If we sound 967,
that's okay . . . Maybe we're the next wave "
Right now. Rooftop Magic is going to try to become popular
on the Bay Area club circuit and make their breaks from
there. As they say in song, they're "Highly Hopeful," and
their tirst single could start them on their way.
