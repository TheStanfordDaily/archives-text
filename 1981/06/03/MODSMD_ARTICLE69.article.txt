# John Lydon a.k.a. Rotten is no burn-out
## 
### Tony Kelly 
O.K. kids, it's quiz time. Re
member the Sex Pistols, the ori
ginal punk band? Remember
Johnny Rotten, the anarchic,
terminally pissed-off singer and
"song" writer? For a pair ot
tickets to the next Dead Ken
nedys show (second prize: 2
pairs), guess: Where Is He
Now?
a) Dead, having killed
himself while practicing safety
pin acupuncture.
b > Hosting a talk show in Can
ada.
c) Playing the Las Vegas
circuit as Wayne Rottino.
Wrong em boyo. Just be
cause Neil Young says so
doesn't mean that Johnny has
burnt out or faded away. In fact,
since 1979. he's been using his
real name — John Lydon — and
leading a band called Public Im
„ age Ltd.
Formed with Clash co-found
er Keith Levene (another must
know for trivia buffs), the cor
poration was founded on the pre
mise that "Rock and roll is
dead. The Sex Pistols killed it.
We're doing something totally
different." Though this sounds
like a pile of "only band that
matters" dinosaur biscuits, be
forewarned that Public Image
Ltd., or PiL, is different. By far.
On their first two albums (the
debut is only available as an im
port), PiL torged a fright
eningly new sound sitting
squarely on the border of music,
threatening to fall into the void
ot industrial noise. Bassist Jah
Wobble and any one of a number
of anonymous drummers

thumped out an amazing array
of pulsing Dial-a-Riffs, while
Levene sent his guitar
screeching through chord after
neck-snapping chord. Over the
counterpoint, Lydon sang even
more passionately (and dis
cordantly ) than on any old Sex
Pistols raveup, letting his emo
tions carry him through the
song. The result, like a fan once
said of the Velvet Underground,
is like the first cigarette after a
tonsillectomy.
But while the PiL formula
had been set in a sort of post
punk mold on their debut LP and
developed into a whole "new
psychedelia" school of music on
last year's Second Edition, it
all seemed curiously safe.
Though PiL was still as ex
hilarating as ever, they were
now secure in their invention,
proved on the import live album
I'aris Au Frintemps (yes, it's
French). It became clear that
Lydon and Levene wanted a
change.
Change came quickly and
massively. Jah Wobble was
fired from the band, as was
drummer of the month Martyn
Atkins. Amid rumors of break
up, a new album with Lydon,
Levene, and (strictly as hired
help) Atkins was recorded.
Titled The Flowers of Romance,
it features a stripped-down PiL,
once again experimenting in its
own unique, forbidding way.
The Flowers of Romance is a
shocking record, even for Pub
lic Image Ltd. The dominant
sound on the album is drums and
voice — nothing more. Keith
Levene has about as much

chance here as the aforemen
tioned Mr. Young in a Sing Like
Caruso contest. The result, de
spite the many many overdubs
and electronic gadgets, is a very
primitive-sounding record. Not
primitive/Sex Pistols, but
primitive/ancient. If Sophocles
had had his tragedies set to mu
sic, I daresay the soundtrack
would be much like The Flowers
of Romance.

But let's not give the im
pression that this article's being
written on some rock or some
thing. John Lydon cannot sing —
It's true. Nonetheless, he won a
number of 980 critics' polls as
best vocalist, and here he shows
why. The key here is passion.

not prettiness — and Lydon is
more passionate than ever when
the song is a straight dialogue
between him and Atkins'
crashing down. The opening
track, "Four Enclosed Walls,"
begins with an electronic swell
that leads into a sort ot ritual
chant. Then, the drums take up
the chant as Lydon literally
screams in Renaissance terms
about a "new crusade." Pow
erful, atonal on the tirst listen,
but hypnotic in its intensity.
Levene makes his debut on
"Track 8," mixed way down in
an apparently unselfish desire
to create truly new music. The
lyrics, though, are vintage punk
— anti-love, anti-women: "The
suffering suffragette/Spread
her body naked and silly/A
bulbous heap batting her eye
lids." Mmmm, ecstasy. All over
San Francisco, listeners are on
their knees in front of their re
ceivers, wildly turning up their
bass controls.
Despite the lyrics, though,
Lydon is purging himself in his
hatred, not others. In the follow
ing cut, "Phenagen," he snarls,
"Empty promises help to
forget." The title track,
rumored to be a belated
farewell song to Sid Vicious
(Whose first band was named by
Lydon The Flowers of Ro
mance), cries "I can't depend
on these so-called friends." The
next song, "Under the House,"
a psychological tale of a
monstrous memory, shows the
most chilling use of the
Lydon/Atkins dialogue on the
record, as both drums and
voices come back to haunt the

singer in Gregorian-chant style.
As side one ends, one can't help
but be affected, almost bruised,
by the punishing and compelling
production.
Side two is more erratic in
this sense, as Lydon's lyrics be
come more topical and a little
less personal. At the same time,
though, the two best songs on
the album are hidden here.
"Banging the Door," the least
opaque of the compositions,
combines a dirge-like bass line
with the usual creative pound
ing of Atkins.
Keith Levene (having gone to
the 7-1 on the corner for more
Twinkies), returns in full power
on "Go Back," showcasing his
creativity again as Lydon at
tacks the current panacea of
conservatism in modern Eng
land: "Have a cup of tea, good
days ahead." Appropriately,
PiL is back in full strength when
they address the outside world,
continuing John Lydon's
portrayal of Johnny Rotten the
rock anti-hero in John Lydon the
individual. Though The Flowers
of Romance in some ways is a
record where Public Image Ltd.
buys a TV and turns the color
knob all the way to black and
white, the introspection gives
more of a basis for the primitive
cry of tear, anguish, and all-out
rage that John Lydon screams
than any other album in music.
At the same time, don't trust
anyone who tells you that PiL is
the future of rock and roll. The
sound is still dark, loud, often
unattractive — but it means
something. Is it rock? No. Could
it be art? Frame your copy now.

primitive/Sex Pistols, but
primitive/ancient. If Sophocles
had had his tragedies set to mu
sic, I daresay the soundtrack
would be much like The Flowers
of Romance.

But let's not give the im
pression that this article's being
written on some rock or some
thing. John Lydon cannot sing —
It's true. Nonetheless, he won a
number of 980 critics' polls as
best vocalist, and here he shows
why. The key here is passion.

not prettiness — and Lydon is
more passionate than ever when
the song is a straight dialogue
between him and Atkins'
crashing down. The opening
track, "Four Enclosed Walls,"
begins with an electronic swell
that leads into a sort ot ritual
chant. Then, the drums take up
the chant as Lydon literally
screams in Renaissance terms
about a "new crusade." Pow
erful, atonal on the tirst listen,
but hypnotic in its intensity.
Levene makes his debut on
"Track 8," mixed way down in
an apparently unselfish desire
to create truly new music. The
lyrics, though, are vintage punk
— anti-love, anti-women: "The
suffering suffragette/Spread
her body naked and silly/A
bulbous heap batting her eye
lids." Mmmm, ecstasy. All over
San Francisco, listeners are on
their knees in front of their re
ceivers, wildly turning up their
bass controls.
Despite the lyrics, though,
Lydon is purging himself in his
hatred, not others. In the follow
ing cut, "Phenagen," he snarls,
"Empty promises help to
forget." The title track,
rumored to be a belated
farewell song to Sid Vicious
(Whose first band was named by
Lydon The Flowers of Ro
mance), cries "I can't depend
on these so-called friends." The
next song, "Under the House,"
a psychological tale of a
monstrous memory, shows the
most chilling use of the
Lydon/Atkins dialogue on the
record, as both drums and
voices come back to haunt the

singer in Gregorian-chant style.
As side one ends, one can't help
but be affected, almost bruised,
by the punishing and compelling
production.
Side two is more erratic in
this sense, as Lydon's lyrics be
come more topical and a little
less personal. At the same time,
though, the two best songs on
the album are hidden here.
"Banging the Door," the least
opaque of the compositions,
combines a dirge-like bass line
with the usual creative pound
ing of Atkins.
Keith Levene (having gone to
the 7-1 on the corner for more
Twinkies), returns in full power
on "Go Back," showcasing his
creativity again as Lydon at
tacks the current panacea of
conservatism in modern Eng
land: "Have a cup of tea, good
days ahead." Appropriately,
PiL is back in full strength when
they address the outside world,
continuing John Lydon's
portrayal of Johnny Rotten the
rock anti-hero in John Lydon the
individual. Though The Flowers
of Romance in some ways is a
record where Public Image Ltd.
buys a TV and turns the color
knob all the way to black and
white, the introspection gives
more of a basis for the primitive
cry of tear, anguish, and all-out
rage that John Lydon screams
than any other album in music.
At the same time, don't trust
anyone who tells you that PiL is
the future of rock and roll. The
sound is still dark, loud, often
unattractive — but it means
something. Is it rock? No. Could
it be art? Frame your copy now.

O.K. kids, it's quiz time. Re
member the Sex Pistols, the ori
ginal punk band? Remember
Johnny Rotten, the anarchic,
terminally pissed-off singer and
"song" writer? For a pair ot
tickets to the next Dead Ken
nedys show (second prize: 2
pairs), guess: Where Is He
Now?
a) Dead, having killed
himself while practicing safety
pin acupuncture.
b > Hosting a talk show in Can
ada.
c) Playing the Las Vegas
circuit as Wayne Rottino.
Wrong em boyo. Just be
cause Neil Young says so
doesn't mean that Johnny has
burnt out or faded away. In fact,
since 1979. he's been using his
real name — John Lydon — and
leading a band called Public Im
„ age Ltd.
Formed with Clash co-found
er Keith Levene (another must
know for trivia buffs), the cor
poration was founded on the pre
mise that "Rock and roll is
dead. The Sex Pistols killed it.
We're doing something totally
different." Though this sounds
like a pile of "only band that
matters" dinosaur biscuits, be
forewarned that Public Image
Ltd., or PiL, is different. By far.
On their first two albums (the
debut is only available as an im
port), PiL torged a fright
eningly new sound sitting
squarely on the border of music,
threatening to fall into the void
ot industrial noise. Bassist Jah
Wobble and any one of a number
of anonymous drummers

thumped out an amazing array
of pulsing Dial-a-Riffs, while
Levene sent his guitar
screeching through chord after
neck-snapping chord. Over the
counterpoint, Lydon sang even
more passionately (and dis
cordantly ) than on any old Sex
Pistols raveup, letting his emo
tions carry him through the
song. The result, like a fan once
said of the Velvet Underground,
is like the first cigarette after a
tonsillectomy.
But while the PiL formula
had been set in a sort of post
punk mold on their debut LP and
developed into a whole "new
psychedelia" school of music on
last year's Second Edition, it
all seemed curiously safe.
Though PiL was still as ex
hilarating as ever, they were
now secure in their invention,
proved on the import live album
I'aris Au Frintemps (yes, it's
French). It became clear that
Lydon and Levene wanted a
change.
Change came quickly and
massively. Jah Wobble was
fired from the band, as was
drummer of the month Martyn
Atkins. Amid rumors of break
up, a new album with Lydon,
Levene, and (strictly as hired
help) Atkins was recorded.
Titled The Flowers of Romance,
it features a stripped-down PiL,
once again experimenting in its
own unique, forbidding way.
The Flowers of Romance is a
shocking record, even for Pub
lic Image Ltd. The dominant
sound on the album is drums and
voice — nothing more. Keith
Levene has about as much

chance here as the aforemen
tioned Mr. Young in a Sing Like
Caruso contest. The result, de
spite the many many overdubs
and electronic gadgets, is a very
primitive-sounding record. Not
primitive/Sex Pistols, but
primitive/ancient. If Sophocles
