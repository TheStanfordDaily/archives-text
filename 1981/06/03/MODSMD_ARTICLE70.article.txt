# And that's not all...
## Joffrey even funny this time 
### Mary Walp 
The Joffrey Ballet once again appears in
San Francisco, and last Friday, the com
pany proved its versatility, exhibited ex
cellent dancing, and even showed a sense of
humor
The program opened with Gerald
Arpino s Smt< Saint-Saens. A modern,
playful ballet which held a few surprises for
the audience. Teasing little shoves between
the dancers set a playful tone without ever
becoming trite There are several more se
rious sequences, one lovely slow pas de
(len\ in particular. An uplifting dance by
four of the men was extremely impressive
and the ensemble's dances were well
danced as well as well choreographed.
Arpino manages to maintain enough simi
larity in each dancer's movement without
ever becoming too uniform or tedious. The
unexpected appearance of other dancers on
the stage keeps the ballet interesting, for
the actual moment when the other dancers
appear is often unnoticed.
"Pas Redouble," the ballet's finale was
enjoyably unpredictable. The entire com
pany was on stage, divided into complemen
tary halves. The halves move in and out of
each other, always promising to begin danc
ing in unison, but playfully skirting away
from any boredom.
Fanfarita, another Arpino work, fol
lowed. This ballet successfully parodies
gymnastic ballets, a result of Arpino's per
fectly timed choreography and the dancers'
execution. The ballet opens with Luis
Fuente, dressed in sequins and black, enter
ing on stage while clicking a pair of
castanets to accentuate his every move. He
manages to convince the audience that even
the act of pointing his toe is phenomenal,
just as his jumps and turns are. Arpino has
inserted every balletic cliche at some point
in Fanfarita, but doesn't go overboard with

cuteness. The exaggerated pauses in thepa.s
dr den \ v the women's fluttering black lace
tans, and the affected arms and part de bras
are all here.
h'anfarita's success lies in Arpino's
choreography He knows when to stop
There are plenty of ballets that mock the
classical traditions, yet they fail because
the choreographer gets carried away with
slapstick But in Fanfarita, just as I was be
ginning to hope that Arpino wouldn t ruin his
delightful humor by extending the ballet

t here are plenty of bullets
that mock the classical
traditions, yet they fail
because the choreographer
gets curried mvny with the
slapstick. Hut in Fanfarita,
just as / was hoping that
Arpino wouldn't ruin his
delightful humor by
extending the ballet much
longer, the finale appeared

much longer, the finale appeared, complete
with repeated phrases of turns, big jumps,
and "look at me" balances.
lii'tiirn to the Strange Land, a beautiful
modern ballet choreographed by the Stut
tgart Ballet's Jiri Kylian, was next on the
program. Two men and one woman open the
ballet, intertwined in one corner of the
stage. Beatriz Rodriguez melts into the men
before the three begin a flowing dance while
holding hands. When they finally do sepa

rate, the sense of fluidity and connection be
tween the dancer's remains Two equally
beautiful pas de deuxs follow, with a final
pas de truis ending the ballet A feeling of
unity exists between the dancers in this
ballet, and. when it ends, a feeling of satis
faction and completeness.
The work is full of amazing lifts and turns
throughout, yet these technical accomplish
ments of the dancers donot detract from the
emotional level of the ballet Rather than
making the viewer aware of the dancers'
abilities, the choreography complements
the feeling.
The evening ended with Cakewalk, pro
viding the required bright and dancey finale
to the evening However, rather than being
a refreshing end, it proved that a little
slapstick goes a long way. It is colorful, gay.
and lively. Nice, but interminably long This
ballet was a little much to endure after hav
ing already seen the similar, yet less
elementary Fanfarita.
The ballet depicts a Southern ball; focus
ing upon the dancing, the entertainment,
and even the heartbreak of a wallflower It
is bright and tun, but depends too much on
skipping and the smiles of the dancers. A
magician produces Venus, a horse, and a
pair of lovers from thin air, who then frolic
about the stage and disappear At another
time, four couples dance together happily
while a girl in a peach dress dances for
lornly about center stage, hoping for a beau
Cute, but so what?
Cakewalk started out slowly, but even
tually, at least, the dancers seemed to be en
joying themselves. If this ballet had not had
to compete with Fanfarita and had been
shortened somewhat, it would have been
thoroughly enjoyable. As it was, however,
an otherwise wonderful evening at the
ballet was ended on a rather tedious note.

The Joffrey Ballet once again appears in
San Francisco, and last Friday, the com
pany proved its versatility, exhibited ex
cellent dancing, and even showed a sense of
humor
The program opened with Gerald
Arpino s Smt< Saint-Saens. A modern,
playful ballet which held a few surprises for
the audience. Teasing little shoves between
the dancers set a playful tone without ever
becoming trite There are several more se
rious sequences, one lovely slow pas de
(len\ in particular. An uplifting dance by
four of the men was extremely impressive
and the ensemble's dances were well
danced as well as well choreographed.
Arpino manages to maintain enough simi
larity in each dancer's movement without
ever becoming too uniform or tedious. The
unexpected appearance of other dancers on
the stage keeps the ballet interesting, for
the actual moment when the other dancers
appear is often unnoticed.
"Pas Redouble," the ballet's finale was
enjoyably unpredictable. The entire com
pany was on stage, divided into complemen
tary halves. The halves move in and out of
each other, always promising to begin danc
ing in unison, but playfully skirting away
from any boredom.
Fanfarita, another Arpino work, fol
lowed. This ballet successfully parodies
gymnastic ballets, a result of Arpino's per
fectly timed choreography and the dancers'
execution. The ballet opens with Luis
Fuente, dressed in sequins and black, enter
ing on stage while clicking a pair of
castanets to accentuate his every move. He
manages to convince the audience that even
the act of pointing his toe is phenomenal,
just as his jumps and turns are. Arpino has
inserted every balletic cliche at some point
in Fanfarita, but doesn't go overboard with

cuteness. The exaggerated pauses in thepa.s
dr den \ v the women's fluttering black lace
tans, and the affected arms and part de bras
are all here.
