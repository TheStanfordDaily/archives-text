# Great Buildings: apart from crowd, epitome of power pop
## 
### Tony Kelly 
Let's get one thing straight,
buckos. Despite my admitted
leanings in musical taste
toward El Nuevo Wavo, I have
never really thought of musical
style as being the essential in
gredient of good music. As I'm
writing this, for example, I'm
listening to Jimi Hendrix play a
fairly jazzy jam session. Not
quite what you expected from a
guy who likes Public Image,
right? That's just the point —
when one is dealing with great
artists, the format doesn't mat
ter. Hell, I'd listen to David
Bowie if he played salsa.
Where style really does mat
ter is in that rare occasion when
a group or artist comes along
that just perfectly defines a
style of music. The Sex Pistols,

tor example, were not the lirst
punk band, not were they the
most outrageous. But they at
tacked the music world with
such force, boldness, and cha
risma that people had to take no
tice. In that way, they symbol
ized the punk movement so that
no one else could deign to reach
the top. The same thing hap
pened with the Velvet Under
ground and psychedelia, or the
Stooges and 1960s heavy metal
( give a listen to Raw Power and
see what I mean). But recently,
no one has provided that sort of
focus to a form of 1980s music.
At least, not until I heard
Great Buildings' first album,
Apart From the Crowd. Los An
geles, though still considered
the top crop of pop slop, has not
had a new band achieve real

popularity since the Knack, and
certainly not a good debut rec
ord since way before them (un
less you count Wall of Voodoo's
EP, but that's another story).
And they still don't have popu
larity — Apart From the Crowd
is in no danger ot needing ox
ygen in its climb up the
Billboard charts. I didn't even
buy this record myself — my
brother back home found it,
bought eight (eight?) copies and
sent one to me, telling me how
they were so outstanding and
all. For my response, we were
talking skeptical. But after
hearing Great Buildings tor the
first time, I can see why he
bought so many copies. And I
agree.
Great Buildings play what is
known both affectionately and

derisively as "power pop" —
well-crafted songs with steady
beats, clean guitars, and hooks,
hooks, hooks. The songs above
all sound young and fresh, from
the clean verse/bridge/chorus
structure to the hum-in-the
shower melodies. Obviously,
there's a lot to like. But all too
often, power-pop is a euphe
mism tor inane songs straight
from the Zody's Bargain Base
ment school of writing.
This is where Great Buildings
are different, and live up to
their album title Apart From
the Crowd. The subject of their
songs, like most rock and roll, is
love. But while most rock bands
still write the I-wanna-jump
your-spine and You-broke-my
heart-you-evil-whoredog lyrics,
Great Buildings leave the de
cisions to the listener. The open
ing song, "Hold on to Some
thing," has lead vocalist Danny
Wilde singing "I've got you to
deny myself once/just ignore
the fronts that keep me from
you." Hmm, a little deeper than
usual . . . Those fronts are ex
plored a little more in " . . . And
the Light Goes On": "empty
faces wander on the
street/everyone I meet/is split
ting at the seams." In such a
world of pretension, Wilde again
and again offers the choice to
the listeners: it's me or The Pit.
Later in the same song, he tells
us the point of the album:'' May
be I'm dreaming but dreams
can come true/it's all up to you
— evermore." It's not great art,
but it's honest.
Danny Wilde's singing is the
same way. He never forgets
that he is singing, so he doesn't
miss a note and even forms
some nice three-part harmonies
with guitarist Philip Solem and
bassist lan Ainsworth (lan? A
band from L A.?). But at the
same time, you also never
forget that he cares about his
subject. On'' Dream That Never
Dies," he turns journalistic a la
Paul Weller of the Jam into a
cry of self-affirmation. On

"Maybe It's You," Wilde closes
out side one with a simple decla
ration ot Great Building's view
point: "And I'm not blind,
though I wish I were sometimes
to ease the anger." These guys
aren't hiding amazing for any
group, let alone a Los Angeles
pop band on their first record.
And now side two comes
along, and I'm running out of ad
jectives. One can only praise
and laud so much, and even
tually all favorable and positive
words are used up, leaving a sin
gle underlying conclusion as
precipitate: This Is Good, Buy

It.
Beyond that, let it suffice to
say that side two ot Apart From
the Crowd is softer than the
first, as Great Buildings opens
up and breathes in between the
raveups. But the commitment is
still there, especially on the
closing title track. "Apart
From the Crowd" is a story of a
person hiding from fear by lead
ing a "normal" lite: "In every
heart a hidden sorrow/Just last
the night, forget tomorrow." By
attacking the false aspects of
life head-on. Great Buildings'
also break out of the crowd ot

young pop bands seeking to be
come the new Knack (as it the
old Knack was anything worth
copying).
More than anything else,
Apart From the Crou d reminds
me ot the Kinks of the '60s,
where every album had at least
three masterpieces on it. I count
five here, and that makes Great
Buildings not just a successor to
the throne ot power-pop, but
possibly the epitome ot the form
itself. In other words, this is
good, almost perfect tor the
style. Buy it.

guy who likes Public Image,
right? That's just the point —
when one is dealing with great
artists, the format doesn't mat
ter. Hell, I'd listen to David
Bowie if he played salsa.
Where style really does mat
ter is in that rare occasion when
a group or artist comes along
that just perfectly defines a
style of music. The Sex Pistols,

tor example, were not the lirst
punk band, not were they the
most outrageous. But they at
tacked the music world with
such force, boldness, and cha
risma that people had to take no
tice. In that way, they symbol
ized the punk movement so that
no one else could deign to reach
the top. The same thing hap
pened with the Velvet Under
ground and psychedelia, or the
Stooges and 1960s heavy metal
( give a listen to Raw Power and
see what I mean). But recently,
no one has provided that sort of
focus to a form of 1980s music.
At least, not until I heard
Great Buildings' first album,
Apart From the Crowd. Los An
geles, though still considered
the top crop of pop slop, has not
had a new band achieve real

popularity since the Knack, and
certainly not a good debut rec
ord since way before them (un
less you count Wall of Voodoo's
EP, but that's another story).
And they still don't have popu
larity — Apart From the Crowd
is in no danger ot needing ox
ygen in its climb up the
Billboard charts. I didn't even
buy this record myself — my
brother back home found it,
bought eight (eight?) copies and
sent one to me, telling me how
they were so outstanding and
all. For my response, we were
talking skeptical. But after
hearing Great Buildings tor the
first time, I can see why he
bought so many copies. And I
agree.
Great Buildings play what is
known both affectionately and

derisively as "power pop" —
well-crafted songs with steady
beats, clean guitars, and hooks,
hooks, hooks. The songs above
all sound young and fresh, from
the clean verse/bridge/chorus
structure to the hum-in-the
shower melodies. Obviously,
there's a lot to like. But all too
often, power-pop is a euphe
mism tor inane songs straight
from the Zody's Bargain Base
ment school of writing.
This is where Great Buildings
are different, and live up to
their album title Apart From
the Crowd. The subject of their
songs, like most rock and roll, is
love. But while most rock bands
still write the I-wanna-jump
your-spine and You-broke-my
heart-you-evil-whoredog lyrics,
Great Buildings leave the de
cisions to the listener. The open
ing song, "Hold on to Some
thing," has lead vocalist Danny
Wilde singing "I've got you to
deny myself once/just ignore
the fronts that keep me from
you." Hmm, a little deeper than
usual . . . Those fronts are ex
plored a little more in " . . . And
the Light Goes On": "empty
faces wander on the
street/everyone I meet/is split
ting at the seams." In such a
world of pretension, Wilde again
and again offers the choice to
the listeners: it's me or The Pit.
Later in the same song, he tells
us the point of the album:'' May
be I'm dreaming but dreams
can come true/it's all up to you
— evermore." It's not great art,
but it's honest.
Danny Wilde's singing is the
same way. He never forgets
that he is singing, so he doesn't
miss a note and even forms
some nice three-part harmonies
with guitarist Philip Solem and
bassist lan Ainsworth (lan? A
band from L A.?). But at the
same time, you also never
forget that he cares about his
subject. On'' Dream That Never
Dies," he turns journalistic a la
Paul Weller of the Jam into a
cry of self-affirmation. On

"Maybe It's You," Wilde closes
out side one with a simple decla
ration ot Great Building's view
point: "And I'm not blind,
though I wish I were sometimes
to ease the anger." These guys
aren't hiding amazing for any
group, let alone a Los Angeles
pop band on their first record.
And now side two comes
along, and I'm running out of ad
jectives. One can only praise
and laud so much, and even
tually all favorable and positive
words are used up, leaving a sin
gle underlying conclusion as
precipitate: This Is Good, Buy

It.
Beyond that, let it suffice to
say that side two ot Apart From
the Crowd is softer than the
first, as Great Buildings opens
up and breathes in between the
raveups. But the commitment is
still there, especially on the
closing title track. "Apart
From the Crowd" is a story of a
person hiding from fear by lead
ing a "normal" lite: "In every
heart a hidden sorrow/Just last
the night, forget tomorrow." By
attacking the false aspects of
life head-on. Great Buildings'
also break out of the crowd ot

young pop bands seeking to be
come the new Knack (as it the
old Knack was anything worth
copying).
More than anything else,
Apart From the Crou d reminds
me ot the Kinks of the '60s,
where every album had at least
three masterpieces on it. I count
five here, and that makes Great
Buildings not just a successor to
the throne ot power-pop, but
possibly the epitome ot the form
itself. In other words, this is
good, almost perfect tor the
style. Buy it.


Let's get one thing straight,
buckos. Despite my admitted
leanings in musical taste
toward El Nuevo Wavo, I have
never really thought of musical
style as being the essential in
gredient of good music. As I'm
writing this, for example, I'm
listening to Jimi Hendrix play a
fairly jazzy jam session. Not
quite what you expected from a
guy who likes Public Image,
right? That's just the point —
when one is dealing with great
artists, the format doesn't mat
ter. Hell, I'd listen to David
Bowie if he played salsa.
