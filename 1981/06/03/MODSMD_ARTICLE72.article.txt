# More on 'Equus'
## 
### 
(editors' note) due to the un
precedented response to Mike
Hole s review of the Company 's
production of Equus, the Daily
has decided to print letters to
the editor on the entertainment
pane. Here is a sampling of the
many received (letters subject
to editing):
Why write?
I have often wondered why
the Daily reviewers write their
reviews. I think the purpose of a
review is to help readers decide
whether to go to the per
formance in question. But the
Daily's reviewers seem to be
unaware that what they write
might have a purpose beyond
the pleasure their cleverness
gives them. Of course, it's eas
iest to be clever when you're
being critical, so they have a
strong tendency to rip apart per
fectly fine shows.
Mike Hale's review of Equus
(May 26) is a case in point. He is
unable to distinguish between "I
don't like this" and "This is
bad.'' He calls Equus "a thor
oughly uninteresting play, a su
perficial, misogynistic mess
... a play for people who don't
really enjoy plays. ..." A pub
lic description like this of what
the judges of the Tony awards
called the Best Play in 1975 re
quires more than unsupported
assertion to hold up.
Personally, I don't like Equus
either, but I thought this produc

tion of it superb. The acting was
mostly good, and Paul Edwards
as Dr" Dysart was outstanding
The evening I saw it (May 25) it
got a standing ovation. How
could that be if it's as bad as
Hale says?
Hale's vitriolic attack on The
Company's production of Equus
is totally unjustified. It is unfair
to everyone involved in it.and
worse, is unfair to the many peo
ple who may be dissuaded by it
from seeing a show they might
enjoy a great deal.

There are tew things I find
more self-indulgent and boring
than a critic who lances a beau
tiful work merely to demon
strate his own incisive (ahem),
analytical capabilities. In his
review of The Company's pro
duction of Peter Shaffer's
Equus (Daily, May 26), Mike
Hale gives a rather cursory dis
cussion of Shaffer's gripping
drama, calling it "uninterest
ing" and "superficial." This
shows absolutely no apprecia
tion for the true questions which
the play addressed.
While nominally centered
around a clinical analysis of the
psychopathology of a young boy.
the play forces the audience to
grapple with several issues

which elusively slip from the
physical world of day to day lite
into the less concrete (and less
comfortable) world of mental
and emotional functioning
Martin Dysart, the psychiatrist,
is faced with the realization that
"normalcy" is just that — a so
cietal definition ot appropriate
behavior which is based only on
a group norm and does not re
flect an absolute standard of
mental well-being.
Hale chose not to discuss cer
tain major points in the play.
For example, Dysart realizes he
can re-channel this boy's pas
sionate, but misdirected behav
ior, but at what cost 9 As he
states, "passion may be de
stroyed by a doctor, but not
created."
In his attempts to truly under
stand the boy, and to act as a
healer, not merely a jailer. Dys
art discovers his own well
trained incapacity for passion
ate behavior, as well as the in
credible and trightening mar
riage of inexactitude and power
inherent in the psychiatric pro
tession.
A full discussion ot the tre
mendous psychiatric and social
dilemmas outlined in the play
(most ot which seemed to es
cape Hale ) could go on for many
pages, but a few words with re
gard to the production itself are
in order Hale feels that the play
is not one for people who "enjoy
plays." that it was not a pleas
urable experience. I hardly tind
mvselt giggling gleefully at the
corpse-strewn ending of
Hamlet, yet that play is certain
ly an enjoyable (and an impor
tant) experience.

Hale also objects to the fact
that Martin Dysart s speeches
are "just talk." That is true of
most monologues, whether
Shaffer's or Shakespeare's
They remain "just talk" or just
poetry until the audience can in
ternalize their messages, and be
moved by their implications. All
that plain talk was enough to
send me. and a substantial por
tion of the audience, out of the
theater with sweaty palms,
weak knees and a racing mind.
The drama was heightened by
the sound effects, notably the
eerie computer-generated mu
sic and the forbidding clomping
of the hooves of the beautifully
choreographed horses.
The Company's production is
not flawless; it is hampered at
times by uneven acting and Cub
berly's poor acoustics. This
group has. however, carried off
a courageous, vivid, and moving
production of a difficult, pro
found. and emotionally mature
dramatic work. To The Com
pany: BRAVO. To Hale: re
maining unmoved by Equus
would move me to examine my
own capacity for passionate be
havior.

When I read Mike Hale's re
view of Equus in the May 26th
Daily, I was appalled The Daily
has long been infamous for its
method of reviewing campus
shows. Their seemingly ran

dom. incomprehensible method
for choosing which plays to pub
licize and review and which
ones to ignore has become one of
the greatest intellectual mys
teries facing much of the Stan
ford community. Why one show
is reviewed and another is not;
why one is publicized extensive
ly. one with only a post-show
picture, and one not at all; why
some plays are reviewed, the
reviews written and never pub
lished ; and why a show must be
reviewed on the Sunday or Mon
d a y preceding the
show, at a dress or technical re
hearsal for the review to appear
in Thursday's paper (if you are
really lucky) or the following
week, after the show has closed
— all when the producers have
checked into procedure and
often hounded the Daily office to
an equal degree is beyond the
understanding of most people in
the theatrical community. As a
whole, people have put up with
his treatment because there
was apparently no way to alter
the situation.
Unfortunately, it seems that
the Daily has taken this accep
tance as a green light to do any
thing they feel they can get
away with — including the print
ing of a review like the one for
F.quus . . It is clear from this
review that Mr. Hale cannot
separate the extreme distaste
he has tor the script from the
production itself. I recognize
that a reviewer is entitled to his
own opinion of both a play and a
production, but for the Daily to
print a review by someone who
has such strong feelings against
the play itself that his mind is

closed to the production, defeats
the purpose of reviewing a
show It seems to me that some
one who was capable of viewing
the show with an open mind,
whether he liked, disliked, or
was completely indifferent to
the play, must have existed. It is
not only unfair to the people who
worked so hard to produce the
show, but also, and more im
portantly, it is unfair to those
who depend upon the review to
give an accurate and unbiased
opinion ot the production if the
reviewer cannot deliver that.
If I believed that Mr. Hale
simply disliked the production
or could have reviewed it with
an open mind, despite his feel
ings toward the script, I would
be the first person to admit that
he has a right to that opinion,
even though I strongly disagree
with him. It is not right, how
ever, for either he or the Daily
to pretend any production of this
play could have satisfied this
man, and that is what is implied
by the printing of the review. If
the Daily expects to be con
sidered a responsible news
paper it also has the duty to act
like one and to provide its read
ership with unbiased reporting.
No one would stand for a mem
ber ot the KKK writing an arti
cle about a speech by Jesse
Jackson, or a draft evader re
porting on the Vietnam War, so
why should they be expected to
accept someone with a closed
mind to a script reviewing a pro
duction of that script?

(editors' note) the Daily's en
tertainment prints public
ity photos and releases for cam
pus and non-campus events as
space permits. All shows for
which a reviewer can be found
(who is not involved with the
show, or best friends with some
one who is) are reviewed. The
depart ment s staff is not large
, sometimes there is simply no
writer available. Fhe editors of
this volume have published all
solicited reviews of campus
shows, and the Daily, like any
publication, is not obliged to
print unsolicited material.
( ampus shows are often re
viewed on the Sunday or Mon
day preceding opening night, at
a tech or dress rehearsal, as a
service to and at the request of
the producers or directors. He
cause entertainment runs only
in luesday's and Thursday's
Daily, and because deadline for
those pages is two nights pre
ceding the day of publication,
preview shows must be re
viewed in order that the review
be published before the show
has finished its run. The opin
ions expressed on the entertain
ment pages are solely those of
the critics, and do not necessar
ily represent those of the enter
tainment editors or the Daily.
