## Des Alpes is just like home (if you're from Germany) 
### Mindy Mayer 
Over the course of the four
years or so that it takes to get
through undergraduate life,
people inevitably develop favor
ites, places that become so fa
miliar and welcoming that they
seem like old friends. For me,
Des Alpes is one of those restau
rants: its friendliness and its
good, moderately-priced food
make it one of the homiest
places I know.
Des Alpes is a family-run op
eration at which the German
virtues of domesticity —
warmth, unpretentiousness,
and abundant food — reign su
preme. The decor is under
stated (to put it kindly), but
cozy: high-backed carved
chairs, frilly curtains, and
wood-panelled walls (a la Swiss
Chalet) hung with antique color
prints and cuckoo clocks that g"o
off from time to time during din
ner.
The back room is especially
nice: apparently Des Alpes
needed room for their wine sup
ply and hit upon the idea of let
ting the customers admire it.
Result: an entire back wall
tilled with wine racks, and on
the other three walls, old prints
of grape varieties. Des Alpes

also plays classical music of the
Handel/Mozart variety.
As to that most important of
German domestic virtues:
good, filling food Des Alpes is
one of the last restaurants
around still serving table d'hote
meals — meals that include, for
one price, soup or salad, an en
tree, vegetables, dessert, and
coffee. Granted the proffered
dessert is ice cream; still, dar
ing to turn their backs on a la
carte in these days of inflation is
a gallant gesture.
Des Alpes' kitchen is not so
much German as pan-European
with German and Austrian lean
ings (whatever that means). Al
though (or perhaps because)
there are only seven entrees, all
are very good. They range ii.
complexity from the humbh
and underestimated bratwurst
to Chicken Breast a la Ex
celsior, an elaborate affair in
volving pate, mushrooms, and a
port wine sauce. In general,
however, Des Alpes doesn't
bother with elaborateness —
its specialty is hearty peasant
food.
Dinner typically begins with
sourdough bread, butter, and a
choice of homemade soup or
salad. On my last visit, the soup

was carrot — an improbable
blend of carrots, cream, and
stock that turned out to be very
good. The salad was good too.
with slices of cheese and but
termilk dressing.
A word on the entrees, if
you're anything of a fish afi
cionado, order the salmon in
hollandaise sauce ($7.95). You
may wonder what all that rich
sauce is doing on the fish (the
fish is undoubtedly wondering
the same thing), but you won't
regret it.
As to the other entrees, I ve
never had anything at Des Alpes
that was less than very, very
good. The Beet Roulade ($7.95)
is not only delicious, it's
creative — imagine beef,
pounded thin, rolled around
mustard, onions, pickles, and
bacon, and then covered with a
rich gravy. It sounds slightly
strange, but actually it's a good,
slightly bitter, very filling dish
— in short, good hearty peasant
tood. It's served with cooked red
cabbage, which in my opinion is
the best thing that Des Alpes
makes; it's slightly sweet, and
for that reason complements
the beef perfectly.
Another all-star entree is the
Swiss bratwurst ($5.25), served

plain in all its naked glory
(Freudians will have a field
day, and should bring cameras)
along with the red cabbage.
There are also two chicken dish
es, steak, and (for the very very
cautious) peanut butter and jel
ly sandwiches at $1.95.
All entrees are served with
vegetables that are as carefully
cooked as the entrees. For once,
you'll probably eat the zucchini
and leave the bread.
As long as you're having Aus
trian food, you ought to have
Austrian wine. We were recom
mended a bottle of Magic Flute
(terrible name) which only cost
about $6 and was as good as
some of California's good
chenin hlancs. (Beltramo's car
ries it.)
Ice cream comes with the
meal, but ice cream's a bore, so
I chose the apple-spice cake
($1.35) — crumbly and rich, and
even better with ice cream (it
came with the meal, I couldn't
help it) on top. More good
peasant food.
A word on the service. The
last time I was at Des Alpes I ov
erheard a conversation. "I like
the heel of the bread best," a
woman at the next table said.
"Oh really?" said the waitress.

"I'll bring you some." Seconds
later a basket filled with heels
of bread arrived Later the
same night I heard a man men
tion that he didn't like garlic, an
essential ingredient in Des
Alpes' vegetables. Not long al
terwards I heard the chef shout
(Des Alpes is a familiar place)
"vegetables without garlic
ready." Service like this is not
only unusual — it's beyond the
call of duty to all but the most
determined hausfraus
Des Alpes is a family restau
rant, with all that that implies.
The decor isn't chic or especial
ly romantic, the clientele isn't
composed of students and young
professionals (the one person I
recognized when I was last
there turned out to be the clerk
from my local post office), and
the menu features peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches (die sand
wichen peanut und jellich?).
But it's also comparatively
inexpensive; the food is wonder
ful, hearty, and simple; and the
service is the friendliest I've
ever seen. It's like being home,
and when you're away from
home that's nice.
