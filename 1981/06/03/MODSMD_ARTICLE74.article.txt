SCENE ONE. Yi'ir I amity restau
rant, early evening. The credits begin
to roll by.
Aerial shot of restaurant, surroun
dings — University Avenue, light
evening traffic, passers-by. Numer
ous tables are set up in a small court
yard; about half the tables are full.
Sn itch to a street level view of the
building. It is a large building dating
back to the 19205, with a movie mar
quee on the front.
Zoom in on courtyard. The tables
are adorned with flowers; at the oc
cupied tables, patrons sample a
large variety of foods — sandwiches,
tostadas, salads, casseroles, and
burgers. Several of the customers'
comments can be heard over the gen
eral drone of the setting.
"I wonder how come we can't hear
the tratfic on University from here.
We're close to it, but isolated at the
same time."
"I'm really surprised. I've always
come here for the movies, but I never
thought the food would be any good. "
"The sole vin blanc I ordered is im
pressive. The wine and cheese sauce
is light, and quite good. I'm glad we
came on a day when it was on the spe
cialty menu. And the zucchini and
tomatoes it came with are a lot more
filling than the parsley you get at a lot
of restaurants. I must admit, though,
I have tasted more exciting rice."
"My eggplant toscana is a touch
oily, but not too much to spoil it."
Focus on a particular table where a
couple is eating appetizers.
He: This clam chowder is kind of
heavy on the potatoes, but it's still en
joyable. How's your salad?
She: I like the vinaigrette dressing

It's too bad the salad isn't a little larg
er. But it comes with the special en
trees — not a bad deal, really.
A slightly longer shot reveals the
chairs the couple are sitting in — low
director's chairs with names im
printed on the back. Names such as
(ireta Carbo, Mick Jagger, and
David Howie are immediately vis
ible. On the right, a musician begins
setting up his speakers and amplifier
in the courtyard.
Switch to moving camera which

follows a waiter inside the building.
Inside, additional tables are visible,
along with a bar and the theater
itself. Zoom in on traitress speaking
with several people looking at menus.
Waitress: If you're going to see the
movies tonight, you can get a $1 dis
count with every $5 dinner.
Customer: Great!
Waitress: The additional cost of the
movie tickets will be added to your
check.
Sn itch to outdoor camera, focus on

a couple eating dessert.
He: This rum cake is fantastic. I
guess I made a good choice — there
really were quite a few things to
choose from.
She: You're right. I'm pleased with
my espresso. I'd heard it was good
here, and I'm not disappointed. Even
so, next time, I think I'll try the
cheese cake. Or maybe I'll get a scoop
of Bud's ice cream. Or maybe . . .
,4s her voice trails off, the camera
pulls bach to University Avenue. A
small group of people are looking at
the menu posted in front of the res
taurant. Comments can again be
heard.
"There are lots of things to choose
from. Even for vegetarians like me."
"The entrees look pretty good. And
the $4 to $5 price range isn't bad at all.
The specials are a bit more ex
pensive, though."
"I'm glad they take credit cards;
I'm flat broke."
"Why don't we stop by the bar after
the movie?"
"I used to just see movies here.
Now I just eat."
Zoom in on a group of people walk
ing down the sidewalk past the res
taurant. They make hand motions
toward the restaurant as they pass.
First Man: I was here just last night.
Its the best place to go for dinner and
a couple of movies.
Second Man: That sounds like an ex
pensive evening.
First Man: Well, our bill was less
than $25. That's not cheap, I know, but
tor two dinners and four movies, I
thought it was reasonable.
Camera focuses on Redford as he
enters the restaurant, and the real
story begins.
