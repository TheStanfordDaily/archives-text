# A 						family's venture into vegetarianism

### Vince Waldman 
The weather here is fantastic Everybody knows that, and more
than a tew prospective Ivy Leaguers have been seduced by Stan
ford's application-brochure pictures of bikinied sunbathers lying by
the pool in January.
For the paradise that we call the Peninsula, alfresco dining would
seem ideally suited; and indeed there are many restaurants with
outdoor eating areas. It's peculiar, though, how these places tend to
be located on isolated back streets or along the noisy, gas-fumed
corridor of El Camino.
H
There are few examples of the European-style outdoor cafe, lo
cated along a busy street where you can watch the people go by. In
part, of course, that's because there are so few interesting walking
streets here (or anywhere in the auto-crazy West — that's why S':n
Francisco is so popular).
For example, you'd never find the Blue Sky Cafe by walking with
the crowds. It's located on a quiet — some might say dead — back
street in central Mountain View, across from a parking lot But it is
a charming establishment nonetheless, operating out of an old
house which has been remodeled to provide several different at
mospheres.
The kitchen is open to the front room, which is bright and familial
— the cook will talk with you. complimenting your menu choices;
another room is darker and more secluded Outside are three
redwood tables protected by large yellow umbrellas; this is al
fresco dining suburban style, but it's still lovely.
The quiet, sunny surroundings are appropriate, since the Blue
Sky is dedicated to the nonviolent ways of vegetarianism. Anna
McNiel, her daughters Betsy and Karen, and friends opened it on
March 2 in order — in the words of the menu — "to offer you de
licious, healthful alternatives to the meat-eating diet."
They take this credo seriously. Karen was apologetic about the
use of (non-fertile) eggs in many of the dishes; and after a few ef
forts to offer fish and poultry, they gave up because no one in the
kitchen wanted to cook it. "White sugar is poisonous to our sys
tems," says Karen, so instead of sugar, a small pot of honey sits on
each table. They're even growing some of their own vegetables in
the back.
They do buy some commercial products, however, both because
of cost and because they believe some "organic" products are ac
tually less nutritious. Economic reality also asserts itself in the
beverage selection, since they sell not only fruity blender drinks
($1.85), juice, and other drinks typically found at health food stores,
but also beer (Coors, Henry Weinhard. Anchor Steam) and wine.
The vegetarian restriction still leaves a lot of room for variety
The lunch menu offers tofu and steamed vegetables in tamari-gin
ger sauce over brown rice ($2.75); cottage pie, an unusual and tasty
combination of vegetables in a pie crust topped with sour cream
($2 75); and sandwiches including tofu ($2.65), sesame burgers
($2.65). and broiled mushroom ($3.20). The mushroom sandwich is
served on a very heavy sesame roll, with good mushrooms and
sauteed onions — a bit too much mayonnaise, though. Soups and
salads are also available.
At dinner some of these items recur, at higher prices (but includ
ing soup or salad). Other unusual items include eggplant almond
enchiladas and eggplant curry (each $4 95). Daily specials are also
offered.
Desserts include cheesecake and carrot cake ($1.50 each). They
were out of the cheesecake, but they swear it is excellent. The car
rot cake was very heavy — it has a high proportion of whole wheat
flour — and highly seasoned with cloves.
A caveat: the portions are not especially large, and vegetarian
food is not particularly filling Those with large appetites may come
away still hungry
At breakfast, omelets, eggs, granola, and french toast are served
along with the übiquitous tofu and vegetables. They even have grits
and gravy, which seems entirely appropriate to the Blue Sky Cafe's
warm, home-style sensibility.
