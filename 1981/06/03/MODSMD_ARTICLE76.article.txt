The Graduate ****
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
"Plastics."
Mike Nichols directed. Dustin
Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and
Katharine Ross star.
— Jim Mattson
Citizen Kane *****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Kane's reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. There are few master
pieces to which the term "fun"
can be applied, but this is one. Or
son Welles, who directed, starred,
and co-wrote, infused this master
work of the sound era with a sense
of pure joy in the capabilities of
the medium. Image and sound
work together as they do in no oth
er movie; it is a cinematic Chinese
puzzle, and part of the pleasure it
gives is from this sense of partici
pation in unearthing the secrets of
Charles Foster Kane and of film
itself. Welles gives a marvelous
performance, as do his co-stars
Everett Sloane. Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Com
mingore, and many others. A mov
ie worth failing a final for.
Plays next Tuesday.

Taxi Driver ****
Fox, Redwood City
Martin Scorsese directed Rob
ert DeNiro in this disturbing,
bloody, nightmarishly beautiful
evocation of American alienation.
DeNiro plays the titular taxi
driver who responds to the vio
lence he sees all around him by
trying to become even more vi
olent than everyone else. The only
morally pure character in the film
is the twelve-year-old prostitute
played by Jody Foster; the girl re
mains untouched by the horror of
her life because she believes that
she is climbing up the ladder to the
American dream. Success in our
society. Scorsese suggests, comes
only from abandoning everything
that makes one human.
Plays tomorrow through Satur
day.

Raging fluW***W
Fox, Redwood City
Raging Rull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse. But on every level direc
tor Martin Scorsese throws ob
stacles in our path that prevent us
from becoming involved with the
film's characters. Scorsese and
star Robert De Niro have done
something very strange: they
have created a hero < based on the
life of famous middleweight Jake
La Motta) who does not respond on
any level to our attempt to locate
him on the human scale: he is im
penetrable. Raging Rull is all
about passion, yet in some ul
timate and important way the pas
sion never reaches us. even when
Jake's blood spatters the spec
tators at the last fight. As much as
I admire the film's technique, I
have to confess I don't like it very
much.
Plays tomorrow through Satur
day with Taxi Driver.

The Four Sea»ons * .
Palo Alto Square
A tiresome movie about seven
tiresome people who become more
tiresome as the movie progresses.
Alan Alda wrote and directed this
gimmicky comedy/drama about
middle-aged angst; his per
formance is nice, but the movie
just doesn't hold together. The
"revelations" he gives us about
his characters — played, for the
most part nicely, by a cast that in
cludes Carol Burnett, Rita
Moreno, and Sandy Dennis — seem
middle-aged, too.

Atlantic City ****
Palo Alto Square
In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on the
Boardwalk, the older buildings —
remnants of a past grandeur and a
more recent decay — tumble to the
ground. In the vision of director
Louis Malle and screenwriter John
Guare, the environmental trans
formation reflects the disorienting
change that has seized the lives of
the people of the city. Atlantic
City 's people try with varying
degrees of success to cope with
this anomie. Somewhat surpris
ingly, Malle ends on an optimistic
note. It is possible, we see, for
some people to adjust to new con
ditions and to make a new life out
of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives
The film features fine per
formances by Burt Lancaster.
Susan Sarandon, and Kate Reid.
— Vince Waldman
A Hard Dav'i Sight ★★★★
Century 21. San Jose
This one s worth the ride into
San Jose to see. It features the four
Beatles at a time when they were a
teenybopper phenomenon and
before they had become "respect-

able." Richard Lester, straight
from directing television com
mercials, directed this one as if
the Beatles were another product
to sell: his genius was for recog
nizing that the commodity to be
sold was personality. The Beatles
might have been the most likeable
product ever to hit the shelves. A
Hard Day's Night would have to
be included on anyone's list of
great musicals. It takes musical
conventions, ties them into knots,
and then unwraps them again: this
is a musical that owes as much to
the newsreel as to Broadway.

The Searchera ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Few men had a better feel for
the western film than director
John Ford; he made films that
were equal parts myth and acutely
observed reality. This stunning
western is one of his very best.
John Wayne stars as a man whose
niece (played by a very young
Natalie Wood) has been kidnapped
and raised by Indians; his pride is
so great that he decides that he
would rather see the girl dead than
"ruined" by people he views as
savages. We are shocked, yet we
cannot turn away from his charac
ter. Ford's artistry is for forcing
us to try to understand a character
even when he seems most incom
prehensible.
Plays tonight only with The
Wild Runeh.

Bringing lip Baby ***+
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the great American di
rectors — Howard Hawks —
directed two of the great Ameri
can actors — Cary Grant and
(Catherine Hepburn — in one of the
great American comedies. Hep
burn plays a screwball heiress,
Grant is a paleontologist, and
Baby is a leopard. Another movie
worth failing a final for.
Starts tomorrow. Double-billed
with George Cukor's Adam s Rib,
which stars Hepburn, Spencer
Tracy, and Judy Holliday.

Swept Away *
Fox, Redwood City
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, mean-tempered,
enormously obvious tale about a
rich woman who is shipwrecked on
a desert island with a communist
sailor. Neither of the characters is
well-enough developed to justify
the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on-screen.
You might take some pleasure out
of the beautiful tropical scenery,
but that's not enough to make this
tract on social Darwinism beau
tiful. Giancarlo Giannini stars.
Plays tonight only with another
Wertmuller film, Seven Beauties.
-J.M.
The Wild Bunch ★★★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sam Peckinpah's 1969 film did
for Westerns what Bonnie and
Clyde had done for gangster mov
ies: it removed the distance be
tween the mythic heroes and the
audience by interposing a vivid,
bloody reality. The doomed pro
tagonists of this picture, who are
unfortunate enough to have out
lived their era, suffer pain and
death as no previous Western he
roes ever did, and the movie is per
haps as controversial now, a dozen

years later, as it was on its first re
lease. Those of us who admire it
champion The Wild Bunch as a
work of astonishing beauty, an im
passioned, Goyaesque epic. Star
ring William Holden, Ernest
Borgnine, Warren Oates, and
Strother Martin.
Plays tonight only with The
Searchers.

Old Mill, Mountain View
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable to
render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot to
do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's lovely
"epic" photography isn't enough)
for seeing the movie rather than
staying home and rereading the
book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds. But
her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine

£xca/i6ur***
Park, Menlo Park v;
By turns magnificent arid pre
posterous, luminous and opaque,
this film of the Arthurian legend ia
a tribute to director John.
Boorman's freakish talent. Bad
writing wars with classical, pain
terly tableau battles and scenes in
which the fairy-tale grandeur of
the movie catches us up in the ro
mantic whirl of the story. The act
ing is highly variable: Nicol Wil
liamson is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin; Paul Geoffrey plays Sir
JPercival feelingly; Helen Mirren,
as Morgana, has some high witchy
moments ; and most of the other
principals are dwarfed by the stat
ure of characters they are
playing, though Nigel Terry reads
Arthur's lines well — even mov
ingly.
