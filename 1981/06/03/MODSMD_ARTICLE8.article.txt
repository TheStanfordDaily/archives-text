The ASSU Senate Monday night approved the 1981-82
budget and appointed members to direct next year's Cot
fee House operations.
Next year's budget includes provisions for ASSU officer
salary increases and for increasing the number of assis
tant financial managers from two to six.
ASSU Councial of Presidents members will each re
ceive $3500 annually, an increase of $600 over the salary of
the previous presidents. (The current Council ot Presi
dents has decided to refer to themselves individually as
"ASSU presidents" rather than "Council ot Presidents
members ") The senate chair will also receive $3500 be
cause the chair really does do as much work as the COP
members," said Mark Epstein, chair of the senate finance
committee
The financial manager will receive $8362 for a year term
and four month training period. The University pays half
ot the financial manager's salary. These salaries include
compensation for tuition because officers do not take full
class loads
"This is not really a salary increase," said ASSU Presi
dent Chris Greene "It is a cost-of-living increase."
The senate added four assistant financial managers to
incoming Financial Manager Cynthia Mathewson's staff.
They will oversee service projects and coordinate ac

tivities of the Academic Organization Board and Publica
tions Board. Each assistant financial manager will re
ceive $1440, according to Epstein.
Although the four assistants have been working since
late .lanuarv. their salaries were not included in the cur
rent budget.
The appointment of additional officers is subject to re
view in the tall "to make the budget as flexible as pos
sible." according to Greene. "We are trying to review the
budget and salaries in the fall to make them reflect the
goals we establish over the summer," said Epstein.
Mathewson said the assistants will be retained as long
as projects occupy their time; "and there's a lot to do."
In its role as the stockholder of the Coffee House in Tres
idder Union, the senate appointed Greene to head the Cof
fee House Board and Mathewson as the board's chief fi
nancial officer
The senate also placed the names of four organizations
on the fall tee assessment ballot. Legal Counseling, the
Boathouse, the Pulications Board, and the Graduate Stu
dents Association were approved for participation in the
election. These fee assessment proposals were defeated in
this quarter's election, and the senate approved the spe
cial tall election last month to provide another opportunity
for these and other organizations to obtain funds
