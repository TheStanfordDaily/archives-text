## French voters will decide strength of Socialist-Communist alliance 
### Washington Post 
Paris — Formal negotiations
for an electoral alliance be
tween the dominant French So
cialist Party and the severely
weakened Communist Party in
France's forthcoming legisla
tive elections opened last week
with the Socialists setting the
toughest conditions they have
ever made.
The Socialists have de
manded that the Communists
not back the Soviet Union on key
foreign policy issues and have
said they must be prepared to go
along with the government,
rather than criticize it from the
inside, if the Communists are to
have Cabinet posts.
The talks between the two
parties take place against the
background of what Com
munists freely admit to be their
greatest disarray in decades
prompted by their party's loss
in the recent presidential elec
tions of a quarter of its tradi
tional vote of about 20 percent
Tactics contested
The leadership and tactics of
party chief and presidential
candidate Georges Marchais
are contested openly in party
circles. At a recent meeting of
militants in the Paris worker
suburb of Gentilly, Marchais is
reliably reported to have said
that after the legislative elec
tions there would have to be an
internal debate on responsi
bility for the party's decline and
that he would accept discussion
of his own leadership style.
Some veteran Communist
Party workers say in private
that they fear their party's de
cline and its reduction to a
marginal factor in French poli
tics may be irrevocable. If so,
that would be the most impor
tant political change in France
since World War 11, when the
party's resistance record gave
it lasting prestige.
The main issue in the Social
ist-Communist negotiations,
but one that is unlikely to be set
tled until after the election re
sults are in. is whether the Com
munists will get posts in the
Cabinet tormed after the voting
The dominant view among top
Socialists associated with Pres
ident Francois Mitterrand is

that it is better to have the Com
munists in than out, where they
could benefit from the freedom
of forming the leftist opposition
to the government to regain lost
ground
Mitterrand is a veteran of the
pre-de Gaulle Fourth Republic,
when members of so-called
Third Force governments like
himself were prey to the devas
tating convergent opposition of
the Communists from the left
and the Gaullists from the right
— a situation that could easily
be reproduced if the Com
munists so choose. The
Gaullists and other center-right
groups took advantage of Com
munist strength to try entrench
themselves in power per
manently by using the Com
munist menace as the standard
electoral argument against lef
tist victories That was the sig
nificance of Gaullist novelist
adventurer Andre Malraux's fa
mous dictum: "Between us and
the Communists, there is noth
ing."
Foreign reaction
The top Socialists are aware
that the U.S. government would
be likely to view Communists in
the French government, even if
they had only a few minor posts,
with deep suspicion.
Moreover, the Socialist lead
ers have no ready answer to the
argument likely to be made in
Washington that, even if letting
the Communists into the gov
ernment might make sense in
France, it would set a devas
tating example in Italy, Spain
and Portugal — the countries of
southern Europe in which U.S.
diplomacy has expended great
quiet effort to keep the impor
tant Communist parties ex
cluded from a share of power.
French External Relations
Minister Claude Cheysson, who
is paying his first foreign call as
minister to Washington this
week, is known to want to ex
plain the Mitterrand position on
the Communists to the Ameri
cans. But he is understood to be
under constraints against doing
so in public because of the deli
cate electoral situation here.
Mitterrand loyalists say the
most the Communists are likely

to get is three or four relatively
minor posts such as culture,
youth and sports and transport
alter the voting June 14 and 21.
Drop Moscow support
Socialist Party First Secre
tary Lionel Jospin publicly re
iterated Monday that the Com
munists must drop their support
lor Moscow on such key ques
tions as Poland. Afghanistan
and the Soviet SS-20 missiles
aimed at Western Europe. He
said the Communists also must
accept ministerial solidarity —
meaning that the Communist
Party cannot both be in the gov
ernment and tree to criticize it.
The other big issue is how
many seats in parliament the
Socialists in effect concede The
Communists are reliably said to
have started out in informal
talks by asking that the Social
ists support all 86 Communist
incumbents in the 49'-member
National Assembly. The Social
ists say they refused. Mitter
rand was so far out ahead of
Marchais. even in many tradi
tionally Communist districts,
that the Socialists are expected
to take away about half of the
Communist seats.
By the choice of strong can
didates. the Socialists have al
ready served notice.in effect
that they plan to extend no fa
vors to Communist pro-Soviet
hard-liners.
Compromise likely
Prominent Communist dissi
dents say their party's leader
ship is willing to make any
number of concessions to get
into the government, just so that
it can tell party members that it
has something to show tor the
past five years of zig-zags in the
party line that finally wound up
reducing it to ' 5 4 percent of the
vote, the electoral level of 1936.
Public opinion polls show the
Communist Party slipping even
lower than 15 percent in June,
but most analysts assume that it
can regain as much as half of its
losses if it campaigns well, scor
ing perhaps 17 or 18 percent.
Marchais and the group
around him are challenged by
the mutually conflicting opposi
tions of the liberals who opposed
the Communist sabotage of the

Socialist-Communist alliance
that prevented a leftist legisla
tive victory in '978 and by the
pro-Soviet hard-liners who op
posed the electorally unproduc
tive Marchais app? J 1 to work
ing-class racism. The only in
terest the two groups share is in
eliminating Marchais. Since
they cannot make a credible al
liance. the center group behind
Marchais seems likely to stay in
control, with or without him.
