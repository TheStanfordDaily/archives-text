It Happened One Night ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Frank Capra's Depression clas
sic reflected a new era in comedy.
Fast-talking, shrewd, and op
timistic, it proved that Americans
could take something like econom
ic disaster right in stride. Capra
always worked to show that, left to
their own devices, people will re
veal themselves as inherently
good, and his movies come close to
making you believe it. Here, Clark
Gable and Claudette Colbert star
as an unlikely pair of lovers.
Thrown together by a bus acci
dent, they try to get through the or
deal with their morals and sense of
humor intact.
Double-billed through Wednes
day with Design for Living.
— Jim Mattson
M*A *S*H ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Robert Altman (Nashville)
directed this terrific anti-war war
comedy. Blood — from casualties
of the Korean war, mostly — splat
ters the walls of the operation
rooms like juice squirts from ripe
oranges, while doctors Donald
Sutherland and Elliot Gould cover
just about everything else with
wisecracks. This is a silly, beau
tifully irreverent view of warfare:
it presents all generals as fools and
all objectives as petty ones. As the
spate of "serious" war/anti-war
movies we've had lately indicates,
irreverence can do more to de
mythologize warfare than can any
dozen message pictures ("thou
shalt not play Russian roulette,"
and all that).
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
Private Benjartiin.

Private Benjamin ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A Goldie Hawn-production of a
Goldie Hawn star vehicle. The
movie is a big-budgeted "Perils of
Goldie." Hawn plays a know-noth
ing rich girl who loses her hus
band, meets the reality of the
army, grows up, becomes inde
pendent thinking. Hawn's talents
are considerable, but she's lost
much of her perspective here —
many of her best sequences are
pushed beyond the breaking point.
Director Howard Zieff (Hearts of
the West) has a nice comic touch,
but he stumbles badly when the
movie takes a romantic turn.
Plays Saturday and Sunday:
double-billed with M*A *S*H.

A Hard Day'* Night ★★★★
Century 21, San Jose
This one's worth the ride into
San Jose to see. It features the four
Beatles at a time when they were a
teenybopper phenomenon and
before they had become "respect
able." Richard Lester, straight
from directing television com
mercials, directed this one as if
the Beatles were another product
to sell: his genius was for recog
nizing that the commodity to be
sold was personality. The Beatles
might have been the most likeable
product ever to hit the shelves. A
Hard Day's Night would have to
be included on anyone's list of
great musicals. It takes musical
conventions, ties them into knots,
and then unwraps them again: this
is a musical that owes as much to
the newsreel as to Broadway.

The African Queen ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
This is the story of the romance
between Humphrey Bogart a low
life character by choice, and
Katharine Hepburn, a confirmed
Christian spinster. The
matchmaker is a boat named,
quite aptly, the African Queen.
The script, written by James
Agee, is witty and tight; the same

holds true for John Huston's direc
tion.
The African Queen is
enormously appealing. The happy
combination of superb players,
screenplay and direction makes
this a uniquely likable film.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Beat the Devil.

Design for Living ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Ernst Lubitsch directed tale of
a menage a trois; it may be the
most entertaining bit of fluff Hol
lywood ever produced. Ben Hecht
adapted Noel Coward's play for
the screen, but don't be surprised
when the movie is much more
Hecht than Coward. Everything
but the names were changed. The
wonderful cast is headed by Gary
Cooper, Fredric March, and
Miriam Hopkins; Edward Everett
Horton leads the supporting
players.
Plays through Wednesday with
It Happened One Night.

Stir Crazy ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Or: Abbott and Costello Go to
Prison. This comedy, written by
Bruce Jay Friedman and directed
by Sidney Poitier, is intended to be
a take-off on Cool-Hand Luke,
with a little of From Here to
Eternity tossed in. Richard Pryor
and Gene Wilder play buddies who
are mistakenly identified as bank
robbers and thrown into the clink,
where a mean warden spots Wil
der's skill at riding the mechanical
bull and plans to have him win the
annual rodeo. The movie is just a
mess of gags from other movies,
some of them so ancient they die of
exhaustion before our eyes; they
are also clumsy and mistimed.
The two stars have their moments,
but they're required to repeat the
same lunatic routines over and
over.
Plays Friday. Triple-billed with
Richard Pryor: in Concert and Sil
ver Streak.

Excalibur+++
Park, Menlo Park
By turns magnificent and pre
posterous, luminous and opaque,
this film of the Arthurian legend is
a tribute to director John
Boorman's freakish talent. Bad
writing wars with classical, pain
terly tableau battles and scenes in
which the fairy-tale grandeur of
the movie catches us up in the ro
mantic whirl of the story. The act
ing is highly variable: Nicol Wil
liamson is a humorous, exuberant
Merlin; Paul Geoffrey plays Sir
Percival feelingly; Helen Mirren,
as Morgana, has some high witchy
moments; and most of the other
principals are dwarfed by the stat
ure of the characters they are
playing, though Nigel Terry reads
Arthur's lines well — even mov
ingly.

The Elephant Man ★★★★
Fox, Redwood City
I kept putting off seeing this
movie — I think I expected it to be
preachy and all about "human
dignity." (Human dignity tends to
make better editorials than mov
ies.) When I finally got around to
going, I was immensely gratified
to discover that The Elephant
Man isn't preachy at all — it's
pure magic.
The film is based on the life of
John Merrick, a victim of a de
forming disease in nineteenth-cen
tury England. Director David
Lynch has created a film that's
equal parts Dickens and Mary
Shelley. We empathize with this
"monster," and we're appalled at
the cruelty of the society in which
he finds himself. Lynch's style is
anything but realistic: his movie
has the look and feel of a great
fairy tale. As played by John Hurt,
Merrick is imbued with sweetness
and gentle grace.
Plays Friday and Saturday with
the 1979 version of Dracula.

Beat the Devil ★★★
Fox, Redwood City
John Huston directed this very
odd knock-about comedy. It's nev
er entirely clear what's happen
ing, or why. In its own screwy way,
the film is often funny and some;
times endearing. The script, by
Truman Capote, is said to have
been written the night before and
handed to the actors on the set,
which probably explains the some
what more-than-usually bemused
expression Humphrey Bogart af
fects throughout. Jennifer Jones,
here a blond, co-stars.
Double-billed Sunday and Mon
day with The African Queen.
