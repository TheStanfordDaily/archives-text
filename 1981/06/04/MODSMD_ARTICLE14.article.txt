# Alouette: fine French cuisine, but take your parents
## 
### Vince Waldman 
On the Peninsula the French
restaurants almost all seem to
follow one of two patterns:
either they are very elegant and
serve the classic, heavy dishes
that define traditional French
cooking in this country, or they
attempt to evoke a provincial
atmosphere and emphasize
lighter meats (though they usu
ally drown the meat in the same
heavy sauces).
Alouette is a good example of
the latter, country-French style
which is so common around
Palo Alto. It is extremely in
formal : the hostess and many of
the waiters wear blue jeans, and
the place is so small that in
timacy is inevitable. About fif
teen tables are crowded into a
room that would comfortably
hold ten. (The menu advises you
to "Please keep an eye on your
coat and hat.) There are also a
few outdoor tables in back.
Still, it is very pretty. A large,
glass storefront window and in
terior brick walls decorated
with ivy give the sensation of
outdoor eating indoors. The
wallpaper is a rose-colored
floral pattern; the same pattern
appears on the back of the one
page menu.
The whole place exudes an
aura of sweetness. Appropriate
ly, then, we were recommended
a bottle of Macon-Villages Pinot
Chardonnay ($12.50) to go with
our orders of rabbit and fish. A
full-bodied white, it was un
deniably delicious but rather too
sweet to cut through the
thickness of the creamy sauces
they put on the food; it was near
ly a dessert wine. The wine list
is small and eclectic, with vin
tages ranging from about $9 to
about $20. as well as a domestic

house wine at $2 a glass.
Dinner comes with bread
(served cold, which is not dis
turbing given that most places
that serve bread hot do so by
putting it in the microwave),
soup, salad, and a small portion
of very nicely cooked vegeta
bles. The soup was vichysoisse,
but tasted more of light cream
and leeks than of potato (we
weren't sure it was vichysoisse
until we asked): unusual but
very good. The salad was an
eggy vinaigrette with butter
letuce. The menu also includes a
few standard appetizers: esca
rgots ($3.75), pate ($3.00), onion
soup ($2.50).
The menu lists only five en
trees, and there are a few un
listed daily specials as well. The
menu emphasizes lighter, coun
try-style preparation: coq au
vin ($10.25), veal a I'estragon
(in light cream and tarragon,
$12.95), lamb in spice and
tomato ($12.95); one of the daily
specials, however, was Beel
Wellington.
The rabbit in mustard sauce
and white wine ($10.50) was
quite good, although (like the
soup) the sauce seemed to em
phasize creamy texture over
flavor. The rabbit itself was ten
der and succulent We also or
dered croustade de poisson Ar
moricaine ($'.2.50), fish in
lobster sauce served in pastry,
This is the most complicated un
dertaking on the menu, and by
the casual standards of Alouette
is almost flamboyant: the fish
arrives in a pastry shell
(breadlike rather than flaky)
shaped like a fish. The kitchen
lives up to the challenge. The
presentation was charming, and
the lobster sauce was delicious.
The desserts ($2.50) are su

perb: the chocolate mousse was
wonderfully rich and powerfully
flavored; the vacherin glace,
ice cream in pastry was equally
excellent.
The service, unfortunately,
was harried and perfunctory.
We came on a Friday night and
the restaurant filled up quickly;
perhaps it is better on other
nights. But, after all, the room
is so small that the waiters can
see every table at once: they
ought therefore to be aware of
their customers' needs.
The small size also makes it
possible for the customer to see
that other tables are receiving
much better treatment while he
is nearly ignored. The hostess
was very considerate and came
back several times to check on
our progress; but our waiter

always seemed preoccupied.
Water was never brought (other
tables got it, and when you're
paying $20 a meal you shouldn't
have to ask). The wine list was
dropped on our table as the
waiter headed over to converse
with another party. The wine
itself was placed un
ceremoniously on the table,
opened quickly and poured even
before I'd had an opportunity to
go through the ritual of smelling
the cork (the waiter also failed
to remember which one of us
had ordered the wine and thus
placed the "tasting" glass in
front of the wrong person). At
the adjoining table, we ob
served, the wine was brought in
a silver bucket, covered with a
napkin.
I only mention this because it

seems to be a fault common to a
number of the area's more ex
pensive establishments: they
seem to feel that students don't
have to be treated with the same
degree of solicitude as others.
This is especially unfair given
the increasing costs of educa
tion, which are making it harder
and harder for the average stu
dent to afford costly meals.
Even so, all the food at
Alouette is very fine; and the at
mosphere — if you are favored
with good service — is charm
ing. It might make a nice place
to go to celebrate graduation —
especially if you take your pa
rents along.

and white wine ($10.50) was
quite good, although (like the
soup) the sauce seemed to em
phasize creamy texture over
flavor. The rabbit itself was ten
der and succulent We also or
dered croustade de poisson Ar
moricaine ($'.2.50), fish in
lobster sauce served in pastry,
This is the most complicated un
dertaking on the menu, and by
the casual standards of Alouette
is almost flamboyant: the fish
arrives in a pastry shell
(breadlike rather than flaky)
shaped like a fish. The kitchen
lives up to the challenge. The
presentation was charming, and
the lobster sauce was delicious.
The desserts ($2.50) are su

perb: the chocolate mousse was
wonderfully rich and powerfully
flavored; the vacherin glace,
ice cream in pastry was equally
excellent.
The service, unfortunately,
was harried and perfunctory.
We came on a Friday night and
the restaurant filled up quickly;
perhaps it is better on other
nights. But, after all, the room
is so small that the waiters can
see every table at once: they
ought therefore to be aware of
their customers' needs.
The small size also makes it
possible for the customer to see
that other tables are receiving
much better treatment while he
is nearly ignored. The hostess
was very considerate and came
back several times to check on
our progress; but our waiter

always seemed preoccupied.
Water was never brought (other
tables got it, and when you're
paying $20 a meal you shouldn't
have to ask). The wine list was
dropped on our table as the
waiter headed over to converse
with another party. The wine
itself was placed un
ceremoniously on the table,
opened quickly and poured even
before I'd had an opportunity to
go through the ritual of smelling
the cork (the waiter also failed
to remember which one of us
had ordered the wine and thus
placed the "tasting" glass in
front of the wrong person). At
the adjoining table, we ob
served, the wine was brought in
a silver bucket, covered with a
napkin.
I only mention this because it

seems to be a fault common to a
number of the area's more ex
pensive establishments: they
seem to feel that students don't
have to be treated with the same
degree of solicitude as others.
This is especially unfair given
the increasing costs of educa
tion, which are making it harder
and harder for the average stu
dent to afford costly meals.
Even so, all the food at
Alouette is very fine; and the at
mosphere — if you are favored
with good service — is charm
ing. It might make a nice place
to go to celebrate graduation —
especially if you take your pa
rents along.

Lytton in Palo Alto; it is open
Tuesday through Saturday
from 6 p.m. Phone 327-4187).
On the Peninsula the French
restaurants almost all seem to
follow one of two patterns:
either they are very elegant and
serve the classic, heavy dishes
that define traditional French
cooking in this country, or they
attempt to evoke a provincial
atmosphere and emphasize
lighter meats (though they usu
ally drown the meat in the same
heavy sauces).
Alouette is a good example of
the latter, country-French style
which is so common around
Palo Alto. It is extremely in
formal : the hostess and many of
the waiters wear blue jeans, and
the place is so small that in
timacy is inevitable. About fif
teen tables are crowded into a
room that would comfortably
hold ten. (The menu advises you
to "Please keep an eye on your
coat and hat.) There are also a
few outdoor tables in back.
Still, it is very pretty. A large,
glass storefront window and in
terior brick walls decorated
with ivy give the sensation of
outdoor eating indoors. The
wallpaper is a rose-colored
floral pattern; the same pattern
appears on the back of the one
page menu.
The whole place exudes an
aura of sweetness. Appropriate
ly, then, we were recommended
a bottle of Macon-Villages Pinot
Chardonnay ($12.50) to go with
our orders of rabbit and fish. A
full-bodied white, it was un
deniably delicious but rather too
sweet to cut through the
thickness of the creamy sauces
they put on the food; it was near
ly a dessert wine. The wine list
is small and eclectic, with vin
tages ranging from about $9 to
about $20. as well as a domestic

house wine at $2 a glass.
Dinner comes with bread
(served cold, which is not dis
turbing given that most places
that serve bread hot do so by
putting it in the microwave),
soup, salad, and a small portion
of very nicely cooked vegeta
bles. The soup was vichysoisse,
but tasted more of light cream
and leeks than of potato (we
weren't sure it was vichysoisse
until we asked): unusual but
very good. The salad was an
eggy vinaigrette with butter
letuce. The menu also includes a
few standard appetizers: esca
rgots ($3.75), pate ($3.00), onion
soup ($2.50).
The menu lists only five en
trees, and there are a few un
listed daily specials as well. The
menu emphasizes lighter, coun
try-style preparation: coq au
vin ($10.25), veal a I'estragon
(in light cream and tarragon,
$12.95), lamb in spice and
tomato ($12.95); one of the daily
specials, however, was Beel
Wellington.
