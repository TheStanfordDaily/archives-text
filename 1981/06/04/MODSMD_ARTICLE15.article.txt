LA TOUR
525 University Avenue -
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,

you feel an atmosphere of ex
clusivity._ Happily, this ex
clusivity does not make the ser
vice and food pretentious. Ser
vice is formal yet good-natured
and not oppressive; attentive
without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseling de Saint Jacques
aux pintes d'asperges (mousse
of scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus spears — $6.50) and
guilette d huitres au Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in

pastry - $6.95) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered. Noisette d'Agneau au
Porto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $13.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the pres
entation of this dish.
A good cross-section of des
serts includes hot or cold Souffle
Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse au choco
lat and selected cheeses.
