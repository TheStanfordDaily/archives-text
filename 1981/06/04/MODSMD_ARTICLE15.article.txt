LA TOUR
525 University Avenue -
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,

you feel an atmosphere of ex
clusivity._ Happily, this ex
clusivity does not make the ser
vice and food pretentious. Ser
vice is formal yet good-natured
and not oppressive; attentive
without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseling de Saint Jacques
aux pintes d'asperges (mousse
of scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus spears — $6.50) and
guilette d huitres au Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in

pastry - $6.95) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered. Noisette d'Agneau au
Porto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $13.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the pres
entation of this dish.
A good cross-section of des
serts includes hot or cold Souffle
Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse au choco
lat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one oth
er, L'Auberge is the kind of res
taurant you'd expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents and well-chosen
selection selection of traditional
continental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill for
two, it would be just as easy to
keep the tab down to $30, wine
included, and still enjoy and ex
ceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings. Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favor
ites — 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
louis and Chicken Saute with
artichokes only begin to suggest
all the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Suzette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional
waiters and very old-fashioned
heavy white linen compensate

for what would otherwise be an
uninteresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous proportions, fair prices and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade soup
or house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and cov
ered with a light wine sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character
of the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.

Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONES
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range
in price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Capnnadda
al tono (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare
(marinated squid with shrimp)
reflect the important influence
of the sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian res
taurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case,
the waiter's advice is worth
heeding, split the pasta dish.
The Agnolotti alia crema (round
disks of pasta stuffed with
chicken, cheese and ham),
Gnocchi Verdi al sugo (small
potato flower dumplings),
Guanciali al Funghi (pillows of
pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings.
Our top recommendation is
Panzotti alia crema di noci stile
maluelina (stuffed pasta with
ricotta and walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main
courses fills our Modesto's

menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in be
tween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers
and candlelight and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and break (sl2 for two;
$6.50 for one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal. Cheesecake, assorted

cakes and pastries (all $1.60),
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50 easily
triumph over your calorific con
science.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an equal
ly elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for din
ner from 5:30 p.m.; for lunch
from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;
and for Sunday Brunch from 10
a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, devoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Madalena's offers a continen
tal menu; pasta is served un
blushingly alongside Scampi
Hordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine, ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a
la carte, such as spinach ($5.50
for two), mushroom ($5),
Caesar ($5.50 for two) and But
ter Lettuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole
Floretine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken AI Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars)
are in for a new treat — an en
tire bar!

Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegeta
bles, including shredded car
rots, onions, celery, cabbage,
bean sprouts and cilantro, are
next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and casu
al, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The services is
courteous, and made somewhat
more charming by the fact that
no one spoke English very well.
Col. Lee's might be just the
ticket you are looking for some
thing truly unusual.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisines, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork, which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at
most other places.

The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialities." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE GOOD EARTH
185 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-9449
Daily 7:30 AM-10:30 PM
For those whose taste buds
crave something other than
dorm food. The Good Earth res
taurant on University Avenue
provides a pleasant switch, with
its unique variety of natural
food dishes served in a com
fortable dining atmosphere.
Setting The Good Earth apart
fro its area copetitors is its re
fusal to serve many over
processed and chemically com
posed foods, replacing them
with a diversity of vegetables,
fruits, herbs and other natural
ingredients.
The restaurant's use of only
choice ingredients has not lim
ited its selection of meals, but
on the contrary has opened up a
creative array of dishes — ev
erything from omelettes to
tostadas; and from salads to

shakes.
Hot and cold sandwiches,
soups, salads, and meat, vegeta
ble, shrimp and chicken en
trees, are among the menu
selections for lunch and dinner.
In addition, six types of fruit and
yogurt shakes, daily baked
pastries, and assorted desserts
are available for those with a
sweet tooth. Various teas,
juices, wines and beer accom
pany Good Earth dishes.
Green ferns hang lazily over
the tables against a background
of wood paneled walls. This
creates a relaxed and easy
going atmosphere for those who
enjoy eating and talking in an
unrushed manner. One of the
most surprising characteristics
of the Good Earth is the diver
sified crowd that regularly at
tends the restaurant.
As far as prices are con
cerned, a McDonald's it is not.
Yet in view of the type of food
served and the relatively large
portions given, the prices ap
pear to be somewhat reasonable
with possible exceptions in the
entree section. Prices run about
$3 to $4 for sandwiches. $3 to $5
for salads, and $5 to $7 for en
trees.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD RE
STAURANT
321-3724
Mon.-Thurs. 11:30 AM-10:30
PM
Fri. 11 AM - 11 PM
Sat. 4:30 PM - 11 PM

Sun. 4 PM - 10 PM
From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it
is by no means small. The build
ing itself contains three elegant
ly furnished dining rooms and a
cocktail lounge. Off to the side
of the main building is a fresh
fish market, which is open six
days a week.
Monti's specializes in
Eastern seafoods, which are im
ported to ensure freshness.
These include Maine lobster,
cherry stone claims, and blue
point oysters. Everything on the
menu is available in their fish
market. The menu is not limited
to Eastern seafood, however. It
is in fact quite extensive, offer
ing Continental dinners in addi
tion to their wide variety of
seafood.
Most of the fish offered on the
menu is breaded, sauteed or
poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only the
true flavor of the fish, but the
bones as well).
The portions are pretty good
sized and are served with salad
or vegetables, and potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and din
ner; Saturday and Sunday they
serve only dinner. For those in
terested in entertainment. Fri
day and Saturday they have
what Monti calls their "sing
along" in the cocktail lounge.
