# Running through the Stanford experience
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
From a senior's perspective,
life is like jogging shoes. You
want to move forward, but you
have to keep stopping to retie
the knots. This and other re
flections floated through my
mind during an evening run
through my Stanford memory
several days ago.
I watched the sky all day. I
wanted Stanford springtime
sun. For only the brightest day
light cools correctly into the te
quila sunrise orange that is
Stanford spring sunsets. In
describable beauty.
The day was perfect. The eve
ning fulfilled my expectations. I
knew the sun's last rays would
be playing glorious tricks on the
Quad's walkways. I wanted one
ot my last campus runs to be
beautiful. And inspirational. I
knew I would have few prob
lems garnering memorable fuel
tor the final Daily article.
I decided to organize my men
tal trek through this personal
yearbook. The first lap was de
voted to my freshman year. As I
rounded the Ombudsman's of
fice I saw the boxes in the hall of
my freshman dorm and I heard
the 1001 questions and introduc
tions that are more a part of Ori
entation week than all the tours
and speeches can ever be.
"What's your name?" "Where
else did you apply?" So many
questions. So much excitement.
Beginnings are confusing.
My pace was picking up by the
time I hit history corner. I tried
to discipline my mind. Concen
trate, Koehn. Remember the

classes you took fall quarter.
Remember discovering Plato
and differentiation. This tactic
failed. People, feelings and mo
ments kept creeping into the
scholarly framework of this re
construction.
As I jogged around the in
evitable construction in the
front of the Quad, I remem
bered wasting time in the book
store — a freshman luxury. Mid
night talks in dorm halls. The
first trip to San Francisco. The
panic of the first paper. In
tradorm romances.
The books came back into
mental focus as I recalled that
first winter quarter. College
and its intellectual demands be
comes home for many frosh that
second quarter. I remembered
the Renaissance pretty clearly.
I also recall discovering the ben
efits of coffee. I learned to hate
rain and Meyer library. I was
ready for spring that year.
I avoided a collision at geolo
gy corner and smiled as I
thought about my first spring
here. Camp Stanford. "Mellow
ing out on the sundeck." Barbe
ques in the dorm courtyards. I
read Darwin in the sun with in
terest but without the seri
ousness that characterized my
winter quarter work.
I was feeling good, working
up a sweat by the second lap and
sophomore year. Today's physi
cal condition was better than
my memory of the mental state
which characterized the second
year at Stanford. Sophomore
slump and confusion usurped

recollections of friends, frat
parties and classes. "What
should I major in? What do I
want to do here at Stanford?"
Appropriately enough, I jog past
the political science building as
I recall how many hours I spent
breezing through Courses and
Degrees those fourth and fifth
quarters.
Econ 1 and practicality in
trude in sophomores' lives. Ma
jors, summer internships and
the future moved in on my Stan
ford set of priorities — friends,
classes, coffee and the candy
counter. Broadening can be ex
citing in its confusion. I re
member discovering the Stan
ford world outside of academ
ics. The Stanford Daily. Speak
ers' Bureau. Juggling books,
friends, extracurricular work.
I still managed to party a bit.
I made a lot of lists. I learned
the Stanford way of life that
year.
I am slipping behind in my
mental browsing. I have passed
the Asian Languages Depart
ment and I haven't yet made it
to my junior year. I try to con
centrate on year Three. Comp
sci and a thermos of coffee. Life
off campus away from the fast
lanes. I threw myself into my
books and learned a lot about po
litical science, economics,
Shakespeare and the art of stu
dying effectively. My shoe is un
tied. I try to slip into that com
fortable, "I've been running for
half an hour and I am into it "
pace. 1 can't name the plays we
read. In place of The Tempest, I
see myself talking to a house

mate over Good Earth Tea. I
hear a long distance phone con
versation with an old Daily edi
tor.
I am trucking by MemChu as I
recall discovering the AIC and
graduate school admissions
tests. Thinking about going ov
erseas. "Can I afford the time
and the money? Why do I want
to go? Where is the Overseas
Studies Office anyway?" I had
so many options last spring. All
alternatives seemed appealing.
I am behind my schedule as I
stride into my senior year. I
have only just passed that in
nocuous fountain behind the
church as I recall my last year
here. I don't mind being ahead
of my feet. Florence was great.
Vivoli. Drinking cappucino with
a friend outside a Renaissance
castle. Let's Go Europe became
the Norton Anthology of this
campus. Learning history by
seeing and feeling it.(Camp)
Stanford jp Italy is an exciting
existence.
I am not anxious to begin the
final lap. The future looms
ominously ahead during winter
quarter of senior year. I re
member long lines outside of the
CPPC. Cover letters competed
with classwork for my time. I
had no time for bookstore
browsing and I walked fast past
the relaxed frosh talking
through the midnight hours in
my dorm hallway. I made more
lists and became more con
fused. I spent alot of time
watching my post office box.
My shoe is untied. As I stop
to retie it, I notice a cat sitting

in a pool of fading sunlight. He
looks as contemplative as the
seniors in early morning lines at
the career center. From a per
sonal perspective, history re
peats itself. I feel like a
sophomore as I finish my knot. I
am not sure exactly where I am
going in terms of a lifetime ca
reer. I have a direction to run in,
shoes to wear. I will try and
move forward. I hope I don't
lose the ability to step outside
myself and my jogging and re
assess, evaluate and tie another
knot.
Enough reflection, I decide,
as I cut through the inner Quad.
I see Friday night happy hours
at Casa Maria. I taste burgers
at the 0. I see my freshman
roomie's face at an Easter egg
hunt at the Mausoleum before I
remember I have a paper due
tomorrow. (I still feel panic.)
I am running out of the Quad
now. Streisand is sappy but
right. It is the laughter you re
member. The classes and the
academics are the basic
framework for the incredible,
unique, endlessly, fascinating
men and women that are Stan
ford. It is from the people and
their interaction that my most
effective education has come.
And it is these people that make
leaving Stanford and its sunsets
so difficult. Beginnings are con
fusing. And exciting. I hope I tie
tight knots. (Nancy Koehn is a

tend the Kennedy of

From a senior's perspective,
life is like jogging shoes. You
want to move forward, but you
have to keep stopping to retie
the knots. This and other re

mind during an evening run
through my Stanford memory
several days ago.
I watched the sky all day. I
wanted Stanford springtime
sun. For only the brightest day
light cools correctly into the te
quila sunrise orange that is
Stanford spring sunsets. In
describable beauty.
The day was perfect. The eve
ning fulfilled my expectations. I
knew the sun's last rays would
be playing glorious tricks on the
Quad's walkways. I wanted one
ot my last campus runs to be
beautiful. And inspirational. I
knew I would have few prob
lems garnering memorable fuel
tor the final Daily article.
I decided to organize my men
tal trek through this personal
yearbook. The first lap was de
voted to my freshman year. As I
rounded the Ombudsman's of
fice I saw the boxes in the hall of
my freshman dorm and I heard
the 1001 questions and introduc
tions that are more a part of Ori
entation week than all the tours
and speeches can ever be.
"What's your name?" "Where
else did you apply?" So many
questions. So much excitement.
Beginnings are confusing.
My pace was picking up by the
time I hit history corner. I tried
to discipline my mind. Concen
trate, Koehn. Remember the

classes you took fall quarter.
Remember discovering Plato
and differentiation. This tactic
failed. People, feelings and mo
ments kept creeping into the
scholarly framework of this re
construction.
As I jogged around the in
evitable construction in the
