# Twins at Stanford: it's not as easy as it looks
## 
### Chris Keith Blackman 
Well, friends, it's that time of
the year again whem most sen
iors get teary-eyed and sen
timental trying their best to
keep down the lumps in their
throats which seem to get big
ger as commencement day
draws nearer. It's a time when
most of us become nostalgic as
we look through photo albums,
Quads, and old Stanford Dailies
and ask ourselves, "My God,
how could it all have passed so
quickly?"
For most of us it's the realiza
tion that the Stanford ex
perience is over. However,
frankly speaking, as far as we
are concerned the end could not
have come sooner. As you see,
we are identical twins and for us
the Stanford experience has
been a little different — no, very
different. Because of the un
avoidable circumstances sur
rounding our conception we
have been forced to lead lives
here at Stanford far different
from "normal students."
This is for all of you who used
to approach us at parties,
meals, Sunday flicks, the Book
store, football games, and even
at the urinals with those hor
rible questions that made us cr
inge: "Gee, this may sound real
ly stupid, but are you guys by
any chance brothers?" or "Isn't
it a trip that you both got into
Stanford?" "You guys must get
tired of being asked the same
question all the time." Well, of
course it sounds stupid, no, it's
not a trip that we're both at
Stanford, of course we get tired
of being asked the same ques
tions all the time. We've been
polite for long enough, now the
truth comes out, now the cat
comes out of the bag, now we
spill the beans. Oh, to have been
able to lead a normal existence

at Stanford.
It would have been so nice to
have been able to sit in Tresi
dder like normal students and
discuss real issues with friends,
issues like Reagan's budget, the
situation in Iran, the Oakland
A's, or the Stanford mascot. But
we'll never know the feeling.
You see, we were too busy dis
cussing other issues with
friends, things like how our pa
rents were able to tell us apart,
which of us was taller, who had
the bigger gap between his teeth
(once and for all, Keith does), or
why we were majoring in the
same thing.
Oh to have had people come
up to us and say, "Hi, Keith" or
"Hi, Chris" instead of, "Hi,
Keith-Chris" or "Hi, Chris-
Keith" or that classic, "Now
wait a minute, don't tell me, let
me guess."
If only people had taken the
time to really know us instead of
ripping our shirts off each time
they saw us to see which one had
the pendant on his gold chain
(Keith does, but Chris is seri
ously considering adding one).
And all that morbid talk of carv
ing our initials into our fore
heads. We just might have con
sidered it, if all the other 8 000
students had done the same
thing.
It would have been nice to
hear friends talk about inviting
Keith to the party, or inviting
Chris to the party, but no, it was
always "let's invite the twins."
Of course it was nice to have
so many more friends than we
would have had being one per
son, but then to have gotten all
those strange looks from people
who couldn't understand why
one of us didn't acknowledge
them failing to realize that it
was Keith and not Chris they
had met the day before.

Oh, to have been able to avoid
the ritual on the first day of
class when the professor goes
frantic wondering aloud how
he's ever going to be able to tell
us apart and the conversation
that ensues between students
and professor making us objects
of careful inspection: "I hope
you guys keep wearing the same

shirts."
Now don't get us wrong.
There was one good time, when
Chris had to grow a beard for a
play and for almost a whole
quarter people could actually
tell us apart — well most of the
time.
Are we bitter? Do we hold

grudges against those of you
who never once could tell us
apart? Have we been ir
reversibly traumatized? No
friends, we've loved every
minute of it!
(Keith and Chris Blackman are
graduating seniors who both
majored in Communications.)

each other apart.
