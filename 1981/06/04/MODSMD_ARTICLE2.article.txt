exercises and diploma award
cercmonies. Other class day ac
tivities include the plaque
laying of the time capsule, the

ception at President Donald
Kennedy's house.
Reverend John Quinn,
archbishop of San Francisco
and former chairman of the
Catholic Bishops Conference,
will give the sermon this yiar at
the nonsectarian service to be
held in the inner quadrangle.
Quinn was chosen by Dean
Robert Hamerton-Kelly of Me
morial Church and the four sen
ior class presidents (Ina Cole
man, Jamie Halper, Bill Kem
meries and Mary Ellen Reilly).
According to Reilly, "Kelly
suggested him as our choice and
we overwhelmingly accepted
him."
Kelly emphasized that the
area clergyman was "the most
important bishop in the United
States" as chairman of the

Catholic Bishops Conference. "I
assumed that if he was avail
able no one would object," he
said. "The main question was
whether we could get him."
Since the speaker last year
was a rabbi and the service in
formally rotates religious lead
ers, selecting Quinn "seemed
like the logical choice," said
Kelly. Thus, the committee
asked him to be part of Stan
ford's "distinguished ecu
menical tradition," he said.
Halper also cited the commit
tee's desire to alternate re
ligions. He emphasized that
Quinn is "a renowned clergy
man."
According to Kelly, Quinn's
acceptance letter emphasized
the high quality of both the Uni
versity and past baccalaureate
speakers. "He probably also
had a spot on his calendar!"
said Kelly.
