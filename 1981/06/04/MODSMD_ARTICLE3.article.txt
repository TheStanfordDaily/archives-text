Former Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, the
man who engineered the release
of the 52 hostages in Iran, will be
the featured speaker at the 198'
commencement exercises June
14.
Christopher was chosen unan
imously by a committee consist
ing of President Donald Ken
nedy, the four senior class presi
dents, and faculty, graduate stu
dents and undergraduate stu
dent representatives. He was
given complete freedom in his
speech topic.
"We're looking forward to

4 Warren Christopher has the tact of a true
diplomat, the tactical skills of a great
soldier, and the selfless dedication of a
citizen statesman. 9

having him speak," Senior
Class President Bill Kem
meries says of Christopher. "I
think he'll have some very pro
found topics to bring up, and
hopefully will touch on his own
opinions concerning current for
eign policy and where it's
headed."
Christopher will be speaking
at 10 a.m. to an expected full
house at Frost Ampitheatre,
where the exercises will be
held. "As many as Frost can
hold will be there," Kemmeries
said.
Christopher, 55, graduated
from Stanford Law School in
1949, where he served as the
first editor-in-chief of the Stan
ford Law Review. As editor, he
became a close friend of
classmate Shirley Mount, who
later became Shirley
Hufstedler, the U.S. Secretary
of Education during the Carter
administration.

A native of Scranton, North
Dakota, he did his under
graduate work at USC, the Uni
versity of Southern California,
where he graduated magna cum
laude in '945, while still on ac
tive duty in the Navy.
For the last 30 years, Christ
opher has alternately practiced
law and worked in government.
He arrived in Washington in
1949 to serve as a law clerk to
former Supreme Court Justice
William Douglas, and moved to
Los Angeles in '950 to work for
the law firm of O'Melveny and
Myers, and went on to become a
partner in 1958. He later served

as president of the Los Angeles
County Bar Association.
From t963-65 Christopher
headed the California Coordi
nating Council for Higher
Education, while serving as spe
cial counsel to former Governor
Edmund Brown, and in 1965 in
vestigated the Watts riots as
vice-chairman of the McCone
Commission.
Two years later, he became
deputy attorney general in the
Johnson administration, and in
1973 was one of four men nomi
nated to the position of special
prosecutor in the Watergate af
fair, but declined the offer.
In 1970 Christopher devised a
legal plan for severing the Stan
ford Research Institute from
the University. The research
faculty now is known as SRI In
ternational. A member of the
Trilateral Commission, he also
served on the Law School Board
of Visitors and on the Stanford

Board of Trustees from 1972 to
1979 when he resigned upon ap
pointment as deputy secretary
of state.
Christopher was recently re
appointed to the Board, and will
serve a five-year term.
He was also a trustee at Oc

cidental College.
When former President Jim
my Carter awarded Christopher
the Medal of Freedom as a trib
ute to his brilliant diplomacy in
dealing with the hostage situ
ation, Carter said: "Warren
Christopher has the tact of a
true diplomat, the tactical skills

of a great soldier, the analytical
ability of a fine lawyer, and the
selfless dedication of a citizen
statesman."
It is not wonder that the vote
choosing the former deputy sec
retary of state to speak at 1981
Commencement was unani
mous.
