# MSU outclasses SU
## 
### Leslie Sullivan 
I have recently returned from
a quarter at Montana State Uni
versity and I'm mad as hell.
For the 40,000 sacrifices mine
and yours have made to put us
through this resplendent institu
tion, many of us would have
done better had we ignored
Hargadon's tidings and headed
for Bozeman, Montana.
I am convinced that had I
gone to MSU, I would be a more
knowledgeable, socially mature
and moral person than I am to
day. In other words, I would be
"better educated." Further,
this disparity can be attributed
not to the relative splendor of an
obscure state college, but rath
er to the gross failings of Stan
ford University and her stu
dents.
On the whole, Stanford pro
fessors would rather not teach.
Of course, there are the excep
tions. but the publish or perish
ethic seems pervasive here.
What Nobel prize winner would
actually enjoy lecturing Physics
23 to a bunch of ambitious pre
meds when research would win
him more recognition and bring
Stanford more luster?
While at Stanford, I couldn't
help but sense this resentment.
First of all, office hours are
paltry at best. Once you've
finally arranged an audience
with the exalted instructor,
many mere mortals feel an ir
repressible urge to genuflect in
his presence.
Like Stanford, MSU is a re
search institution; unlike Stan
ford teaching and the under
graduate are respected.
Example; my physics course
at Montana was no smaller than
my physics courses here, and
yet Dr. MSU corrected all tests
because he wanted "to see the
connection between my
teaching and students' work."
Additionally, lecture sum
maries, weekly prof.-led review
sessions, study guides and re
view sheets were not considered
nobel, benevolent gestures on
his part, but part of a job well
done.
Similarly, not only were of
fice hours numerous, but one of
fice hour that stretched into 80
minutes as we conquered rela
tivity theory ended with
"Thanks for dropping by, Les."
What really amazed me was
that the said Dr. MSU was not
noted for his teaching; he was
regarded as average.
Now we tackle social maturi
ty. Predictably, competitive
Stanford does little to foster so

cial or moral growth. Very few
students at Stanford know how
to share or even consider shar
ing a worthy endeavor. With the
exception of six friendships,
almost every relationship I've
observed or have been party to
at Stanford has embodied an ele
ment of utility or even profit
seeking.
Sharing of ideas, support,
concern and other intangibles
eludes this typical Stanford ex
change. The buddy exchange is
similar in its depth. Homework
assignments, trips to the "0" or
library, conversation at parties
are the currencies of exchange
here — the intangibles men
tioned above are merely in
cidental to the utility of buddy
contacts.
Perhaps college-kids in gen
eral selfishly apply a profit
motive to their personal lives. I
didn't find this to be the case
with my less wealthy high
school friends nor with most
MSU students. Many of them
learned early on that in order to
survive adversity, you have to
share both the material and the
intangibles.
Unfortunately, most of us
Stanfordites are spoiled. We've
never known real adversity and
have never had to give up much
for the good of others. In fact,
many of us base our decisions,
from political to personal, on
what is best for us and our pre
cious careers without regard for
the good of society nor for the
good of those we care about.
I'm no saint. I entered Stan
ford an idealistic bleeding heart
and I'm leaving Stanford a
cynical, materialistic Re
publican. But having been to
MSU, I can now see the vul
garity of my values. Whereas at
Stanford, very few of my friend
ships achieved a sharing of
those intangibles; compassion,
support and genuine concern
characterized more than a few
of my friendships during my
quarter at MSU. Again, it's not
that Montanans are possessed of
loftier spirits; instead, I'd ven
ture that in less affluent circles,
people are more likely to come
before profit and personal gain.
Thank God Stanford is an
ivory tower with a moral code of
its own. I would hate to go out
into a real world regulated by
the selfish, superficial motives
that drive us, the sons of the
wealthy few

ating senior.)

I have recently returned from
a quarter at Montana State Uni
versity and I'm mad as hell.
For the 40,000 sacrifices mine
and yours have made to put us
through this resplendent institu
tion, many of us would have
done better had we ignored
Hargadon's tidings and headed
for Bozeman, Montana.
I am convinced that had I
gone to MSU, I would be a more
knowledgeable, socially mature
and moral person than I am to
day. In other words, I would be
"better educated." Further,
this disparity can be attributed
not to the relative splendor of an
obscure state college, but rath
er to the gross failings of Stan
ford University and her stu
dents.
On the whole, Stanford pro
fessors would rather not teach.
Of course, there are the excep
tions. but the publish or perish
ethic seems pervasive here.
What Nobel prize winner would
actually enjoy lecturing Physics
23 to a bunch of ambitious pre
meds when research would win
him more recognition and bring
Stanford more luster?
While at Stanford, I couldn't
help but sense this resentment.
First of all, office hours are
paltry at best. Once you've
finally arranged an audience
with the exalted instructor,
many mere mortals feel an ir
repressible urge to genuflect in
his presence.
Like Stanford, MSU is a re
search institution; unlike Stan
ford teaching and the under
graduate are respected.
Example; my physics course
at Montana was no smaller than
my physics courses here, and
yet Dr. MSU corrected all tests
because he wanted "to see the
connection between my
teaching and students' work."
Additionally, lecture sum
maries, weekly prof.-led review
sessions, study guides and re
view sheets were not considered
nobel, benevolent gestures on
his part, but part of a job well
done.
Similarly, not only were of
fice hours numerous, but one of
fice hour that stretched into 80
minutes as we conquered rela
tivity theory ended with
"Thanks for dropping by, Les."
What really amazed me was
that the said Dr. MSU was not
noted for his teaching; he was
regarded as average.
Now we tackle social maturi
ty. Predictably, competitive
Stanford does little to foster so

cial or moral growth. Very few
students at Stanford know how
to share or even consider shar
ing a worthy endeavor. With the
exception of six friendships,
almost every relationship I've
observed or have been party to
at Stanford has embodied an ele
ment of utility or even profit
seeking.
Sharing of ideas, support,
concern and other intangibles
eludes this typical Stanford ex
change. The buddy exchange is
similar in its depth. Homework
assignments, trips to the "0" or
library, conversation at parties
are the currencies of exchange
here — the intangibles men
tioned above are merely in
cidental to the utility of buddy
contacts.
Perhaps college-kids in gen
eral selfishly apply a profit
motive to their personal lives. I
didn't find this to be the case
with my less wealthy high
school friends nor with most
MSU students. Many of them
learned early on that in order to
survive adversity, you have to
share both the material and the
intangibles.
Unfortunately, most of us
Stanfordites are spoiled. We've
never known real adversity and
have never had to give up much
for the good of others. In fact,
many of us base our decisions,
from political to personal, on
what is best for us and our pre
cious careers without regard for
the good of society nor for the
good of those we care about.
I'm no saint. I entered Stan
ford an idealistic bleeding heart
and I'm leaving Stanford a
cynical, materialistic Re
publican. But having been to
MSU, I can now see the vul
garity of my values. Whereas at
Stanford, very few of my friend
ships achieved a sharing of
those intangibles; compassion,
support and genuine concern
characterized more than a few
of my friendships during my
quarter at MSU. Again, it's not
that Montanans are possessed of
loftier spirits; instead, I'd ven
ture that in less affluent circles,
people are more likely to come
before profit and personal gain.
Thank God Stanford is an
ivory tower with a moral code of
its own. I would hate to go out
into a real world regulated by
