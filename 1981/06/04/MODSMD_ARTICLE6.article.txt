# Reflections on education bright
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
When the letter came with a
return address marked Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, for a
moment I thought I had been
promoted. Perhaps Herant
thought it necessary to solicit
me for a position in Building
One — that monastery tucked
away in a corner of the Quad. At
that point, my post graduate
plans had not yet been con
firmed and the prospect of
spending a few more years grac
ing the Cardinal pavement en
ticed me as I tossed down the
Journal in favor of the very
thick letter.
Alas, it was no offer of tenure,
nor employment; I was not
being asked to head up a union or
to lead a task force. No one de
sired my presence at a senior
brunch. Instead, out folded the
Senior Survey, a rather com
prehensive set of evaluative
measures to rate "the Stanford
experience."
A warm letter from our
fearless Drs. Kennedy and
Katchadourian requested an
honest appraisal of both my un
dergraduate program and in
teractions with faculty and staff
and an assessment of my "text
book" ability to function in sev
eral disciplines.

Additionally, this potential
pat-on-the-back package asked
a very important question which
I intend to answer here and now.
The entire back flap was re
served for my introspective re
ply to the following: "We would
greatly value knowing about
your conception of what con
stitutes or identifies an
educated person and how you
assess yourself in this regard.
Several things popped into
mind (yet to be determined how
educated this mind is, so bear
with me): The ability to: com
ment on the significance of the
size of David's hands as he tow
ers over the Florentine tourists ;
distinguish between Platonic
and Aristotelian philosophies of
justice; finish I.E. t.33's New
Corp. in less than 24 hours;
digest and analyze Faulkner;
express any emotional, intellec
tual or political sentiment
both verbally and on paper; ap
preciate cultural and geograph
ic differences; define the dif
ference between opinion and
prejudice and recognize their
presence in personal reactions.
After this stream of con
sciousness parade subsided and
I took a moment to reflect on my
Stanford education, I realized
that I regretted very few things

about this institution or the
education it has endowed me
with.
I do admit to a void or, at
least, a weakness in my pursuit
in some of the more scholarly
fields; I wish / had been coerced
into taking Western Culture as a
frosh to develop an earlier ap
preciation of the subjects I dis
covered late in my academic
metamorphosis.
Although I accomplished
most of my learning outside the
classroom, it was learning pro
vided through the auspices of
Stanford. I learned from a
SCIRE internship with the t'aio
Alto City Council that taught me
more about urban affairs and
political decision-making than
any poli-sci class; I learned
more about management skills
through R.A.ing in a frosh house
than I suspect is offered in many
of our industrial engineering
seminars; I practiced writing
and subject analysis as reporter
covering an incredibly vibrant
and full campus; the subjects
ranged from a Nobel prize win
ning sperm bank to the facts of
solar energy design.
Opportunites like these run
rampant at Stanford.
What I began to appreciate
early on was that my education
was a total package. If I did not
have the discipline at 19 or 20 to
pack off to Meyer for my aca
demic works, the only ration
alization I permitted myself
was to compensate with other
educating processes.
Stanford is an unfair institu
tion. The distractions are so
great for a student with open
eyes and minimal energy that
studies are ridiculously easy to
postpone
And problems do exist here.
The advising system is in
famously horrendous. My ad
visor welcomed me fall quarter
with the comment "Oh, I
thought you graduated last

year."
The campus is isolated. If not
for the occasional reminders of
the real world we so ambitiously
prepare our resumes for, this
paradise could easily be publi
cized as a Club Med resort.
The students, in general, are
from middle to upper-middle
class backgrounds and those
who aren't attire themselves in
fairly good disguises. We at
tempt to assume studious pos
that is truiy a country club with
some very haughty members.
But, back to the question: Do
I consider myself an educated
person? Well, I've read a re
spectable number of classics

without using Cliffnotes; I can
tell the difference between Me
dieval and Renaissance paint
ings; I can identify and recite
complete geneologies for most
Greek mythological figures;
and, on good days, balance my
check book.
Most significant in my esti
mation is the ability and desire
to continue learning. Stanford
University has sharpened my
appetite and strengthed my
tools so that the march out of
from an institution bulin no way
will it indicate a graduation
from education.

sired my presence at a senior
brunch. Instead, out folded the
Senior Survey, a rather com
prehensive set of evaluative
measures to rate "the Stanford
experience."
A warm letter from our
fearless Drs. Kennedy and
Katchadourian requested an
honest appraisal of both my un
dergraduate program and in
teractions with faculty and staff
and an assessment of my "text
book" ability to function in sev
eral disciplines.

Additionally, this potential
pat-on-the-back package asked
a very important question which
I intend to answer here and now.
The entire back flap was re
served for my introspective re
ply to the following: "We would
greatly value knowing about
your conception of what con
stitutes or identifies an
educated person and how you
assess yourself in this regard.
Several things popped into
mind (yet to be determined how
educated this mind is, so bear
with me): The ability to: com
ment on the significance of the
size of David's hands as he tow
ers over the Florentine tourists ;
distinguish between Platonic
and Aristotelian philosophies of
justice; finish I.E. t.33's New
Corp. in less than 24 hours;
digest and analyze Faulkner;
express any emotional, intellec
tual or political sentiment
both verbally and on paper; ap
preciate cultural and geograph
ic differences; define the dif
ference between opinion and
prejudice and recognize their
presence in personal reactions.
After this stream of con
sciousness parade subsided and
I took a moment to reflect on my
Stanford education, I realized
that I regretted very few things

about this institution or the
education it has endowed me
with.
I do admit to a void or, at
least, a weakness in my pursuit
in some of the more scholarly
fields; I wish / had been coerced
into taking Western Culture as a
frosh to develop an earlier ap
preciation of the subjects I dis
covered late in my academic
metamorphosis.
Although I accomplished
most of my learning outside the
classroom, it was learning pro
vided through the auspices of
Stanford. I learned from a
SCIRE internship with the t'aio
Alto City Council that taught me
more about urban affairs and
political decision-making than
any poli-sci class; I learned
more about management skills
through R.A.ing in a frosh house
than I suspect is offered in many
of our industrial engineering
seminars; I practiced writing
and subject analysis as reporter
covering an incredibly vibrant
and full campus; the subjects
ranged from a Nobel prize win
ning sperm bank to the facts of
solar energy design.
Opportunites like these run
rampant at Stanford.
What I began to appreciate
early on was that my education
was a total package. If I did not
have the discipline at 19 or 20 to
pack off to Meyer for my aca
demic works, the only ration
alization I permitted myself
was to compensate with other
educating processes.
Stanford is an unfair institu
tion. The distractions are so
great for a student with open
eyes and minimal energy that
studies are ridiculously easy to
postpone
And problems do exist here.
The advising system is in
famously horrendous. My ad
visor welcomed me fall quarter
with the comment "Oh, I
thought you graduated last

year."
The campus is isolated. If not
for the occasional reminders of
the real world we so ambitiously
prepare our resumes for, this
paradise could easily be publi
cized as a Club Med resort.
The students, in general, are
from middle to upper-middle
class backgrounds and those
who aren't attire themselves in
fairly good disguises. We at
tempt to assume studious pos
that is truiy a country club with
some very haughty members.
But, back to the question: Do
I consider myself an educated
person? Well, I've read a re
spectable number of classics

without using Cliffnotes; I can
tell the difference between Me
dieval and Renaissance paint
ings; I can identify and recite
complete geneologies for most
Greek mythological figures;
and, on good days, balance my
check book.
Most significant in my esti
mation is the ability and desire
to continue learning. Stanford
University has sharpened my
appetite and strengthed my
tools so that the march out of
from an institution bulin no way
will it indicate a graduation
from education.

When the letter came with a
return address marked Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, for a
moment I thought I had been
promoted. Perhaps Herant
thought it necessary to solicit
me for a position in Building
One — that monastery tucked
away in a corner of the Quad. At
that point, my post graduate
plans had not yet been con
firmed and the prospect of
spending a few more years grac
ing the Cardinal pavement en
ticed me as I tossed down the
Journal in favor of the very
thick letter.
Alas, it was no offer of tenure,
nor employment; I was not

to lead a task force. No one de
