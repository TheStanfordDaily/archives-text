# Mast alumni content with field of undergrad study
## 
### Louise Solomon 
Although the job market has
become increasingly more
structured and specialized, it
appears that many recent Stan
ford alumni are happy with
their fields and with the way in
which their undergraduate
education has served them.
Of the forty alumni contacted
through the Bowman Alumni's
Contact Service, no one ex
pressed the desire to major in a
different subject if given the op
portunity to do it again. None
theless, many of them did ex
press the need for a com
prehensive education with ex
posure to both the technical sci
ences and liberal arts. And all of
them agreed that the working
world was much different from
college life and from their pre
vious visions of it.
"I really think its a tragedy
that people don't spend time de
veloping their own self and mor
al sense," said Pat Ashley, an
attorney for the firm Cooper,
White and Cooper. "College is
the time to be making those de
cisions and to be making them
based on great thinkers. It's a
chance to read others and to ac
cept or reject their
philosophies," said Ashley, who
graduated with a degree in his
tory in 1972. "It's a time for fig
uring out life, you can't make
those decisions if you've got
your head in a pre-professional
book," she said.
"It's astounding to me how
many 'well-educated' people
don't know anything about the
world outside of their own little
corner," Ashley said. "The
problem with that is that we're
all called upon to make de
cisions that have moral, politi
cal, and economic implica
tions," Ashley said.
Expressing a common com
plaint, Ashley added,"Once you
start working there's not
enough time to read
philosophers. You don't want to
put your head to something like
that."
"I understand because I was
part of that. But in the long run

it's good to get a taste of all
things — something in another
area may enhance your life."
Ashley said, addressing the
questionable advantage of pre
professional training. "If you
can afford the time and the mon
ey to take an education which
doesn't automatically lead to
making a living — that is an op
portunity, a luxury," said Ste
phen Poohar, who majored in
philosophy and graduated in
1973.
Every one should devote at
least a third of his program to
liberal arts," said Bruce
Kearney who graduated in 1974
with a degree in math/science
and now works as an operations
research analyst. "Scientists
and engineers seem to have a
different mind-set from other
people. They think in concrete,
logical terms," Poohar said.
"They tend to be very right
eous. In the humanities you'll
meet people who are different
from yourself and you'll realize
you can't judge them," he said.
On a differing note, Jim Van
ides, a mechanical engineer
who graduated in 1978, said, "If
a guy is really interested in en
gineering, there's no point in
making him take a lot of liberal
arts stuff," "Instead, he should
take classes that expose him to
more communication, team
work, and problem-solving
skills," said Vanides.
Only the engineering gradu
ates complained that within
their majors too great an em
phasis was placed on theoretical
classes and too little on prac
tical or directly applicable
work.
Vanides said that more direct
interaction with industry would
be helpful to students. "In
school you get the idea that engi
neering is all analysis. In fact,
very few engineering jobs are
over SO percent analysis; re-
Search and development aver
ages about 20 percent; manu
facturing only five to ten per
cent," said Vanides.
"I still call on the knowledge
gained from about 50 percent of

the classes required for my ma
jor. The other 50 percent were
too theoretical to be useful,"
said Kearney. "It's not as if I
could have chosen a job that
would have used more theory.
What I wanted were courses for
being an operations reserch an
alyst or an engineer," Kearney
said.
"A lot of colleges other than
Stanford go to great lengths to

make sure that students get
practical work experience. But
Stanford leaves it up to students
to decide what they're going to
do."
"Most of what I took as an un
dergraduate hasn't helped me at
all," said Shelby Siegal, a sys
tems programmer who got his
degree in mathematical sci
ences in 1975. "It was a good
background; I'm glad to have

gotten over it, but I would like to
see more practical classes," he
said.
"Engineering school makes
engineering majors take too
many classes. It's really too
bad," said Jim Stolz, an elec
trical engineer who graduated
in 1976. "That's not the purpose
of undergraduate education,"
he said, "I would like to know
more about art and music."
