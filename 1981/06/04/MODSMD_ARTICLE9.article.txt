# Quarter of class pledges money to Stanford
## 
### 
More than 400 graduating sen
iors contributed a total of
$26,487 in this year's Senior
Pledge Program.
Of the 489 pledges made, the
average gift was $75 104 seniors
pledged unspecified amounts,
and 27 percent of this year's 1700
graduating seniors participated
in the program.
The Senior Pledge Program
is a student organized, student
run volunteer fundraising ef
fort. The program asks all sen

iors to make pledges payable
over the first three years after
graduation. Donations are made
by filling out a pledge card. All
pledges are kept confidential.
Among the varied campus in
terests supported by the fund
are sports, overseas campuses
and the performing arts. Ac
cording to an informational
brochure published by the
pledge program, tuition ac
counts for only 49 percent of the
cost of an education here â€” the

rest is made up from private
donations. Last year 50 percent
of the annual fund came from
donations of $50 or less.
A $25 donation could cover the
cost of, among other things, one
day's tuition for an under
graduate, two swimsuits for the
swim team, a year's journal
subscription, or 20 color trans
parencies for the art depart
ment.
The booklet states that many
seniors hesitate to pledge be

job prospects, or because they
job prspects, or because they
plan to attend graduate school.
In comparable Eastern schools
with senior pledge programs,
however, up to 68 percent of the
seniors there pledge donations.
Seniors may specify a partic
ular school or department
which is to receive their dona
tions, as well as specific clubs or
campus organizations. Un
restricted gifts are encouraged,
however, since the monies can

then be diverted to those areas
of greatest need.
Seniors who contribute to the
fund are not asked to make oth
er gifts during the time of the
pledge, but pledge program vol
unteers will continue to offer in
formation on phone appeals or
other University volunteer fun
draising activities. Seniors are
also encouraged to keep in touch
with the University by joining
the Alumni Association.
