# ASSU recycling service saves all year long
## 
### 
Those big green bins outside
your dorm are not pretty
trashcans â€” they're tor recycl
ing.
But many summer conferees
and treshmen may be un
familiar with the ASSU Recycl
ing Center and their work with
efficient waste disposal which
conserves resources and
energy, raises community
awareness and reduces the need
to use the Palo Alto landfill.
The center collects about
35.0)0 aluminum cans each
month which are then sold to

Adolph Coors Co. The center
basically recycles paper,
cardboard, aluminum and
glass; magazines, carbon pa
per. phone books, glued boxes
and waxed cardboard cannot be
handled, however.
' Our paper company has
agreed to recycle magazines
and phone books only if they are
brought directly to the center."
Co-Manager Betsy Jordan said
"The center gets nothing out of
it. It takes a lot of chemicals to
break down the glue and the
glossy paper, and is a complex.

messy process.
The government cites a 95
percent energy savings from the
use of recycled aluminum cans.
The center also collects 15
tons of glass and 40 tons of mix
ed paper per month. Mixed pa
per is the lowest grade and com
mands the lowest price. The
center also recycles white pa
per and computer paper. "We
get almost seven times as much
for computer paper as we do for
the mixed." Jordan said.
She said that much of the re
cycled mixed paper is made into

cardboard to make detergent
and cereal boxes, depending on
the grade ot the paper. Higher
grade paper goes back into high
grade paper and cardboard.
The center maintains approx
imately 600 bins throughout
campus during the regular aca
demic year, but fewer are
needed in the summer months
when student dorms are empty.
Set-ups usually include two pa
per bins, one aluminum bin and
one glass bin, and are not in
tended for use as garbage cans.
Last year the project ran a

slight deficit. "Last year we lost
$80)0 but we did well this year as
far as income. But we had to buy
a new truck and ran into a large
expense there, "Jordan said.
Revenues for last year were
$29,000. Expenses totaled
$38,000 with almost $20,000
going for staft wages, according
to Jordan.
The center is located near the
firehouse. behind the credit
union on Pampas Lane. Hours
are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Saturday. Call 497-09 5
