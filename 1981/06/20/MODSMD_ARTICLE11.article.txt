# Maddalena's for excellence in Continental cuisine
## 
### Mindy Mayer 
I tried very hard, as I wrote
this review, to tind something
bad to say about Maddalena's.
Something really mean and
astute that would show them
that there was room tor im
provement, like that waiters
weren't supposed to roar with
laughter when customers asked
what a Bernaise sauce was, or
that it was redundant to call
something "soup de jour ot the
day." But to no avail; even the
price (about $50 tor a tull dinner
for two without wine), though it
was high, was commensurate
with the quality of the food. So I
gave up. If Maddalena's does
anything wrong, it's fine with
me. Other restaurants probably
envy their mistakes.
For those who have no clue as
to what I'm talking about, Mad
dalena's is probably the best
French and Continental restau
rant in the Stanford area. It's a
place for quiet, romantic din
ners. It's a place to take skep

tics — if they aren't converted
to good food here, give up. And
it's a place not only to eat well,
but to relax — unlike most of the
other expensive spots around
town, you feel at Maddalena's
as though you're supposed stay
that last halt hour to finish the
wine or coffee and talk. You
would feel almost rude leaving
right after dessert.
All this may give you the im
pression that it's a sleepy little
restaurant. It isn't. It's well
filled every night and noon
(though the seating arrange
ment ensures that it will never
be crowded) and, despite its ro
mantic atmosphere, is a regular
place for celebrations. The
night I was there, in fact,
Hewlett and Packard employ
ees had commandeered one of
the restaurant's two rooms, and
were busy, next door, getting
happily drunk and singing ten
member choruses of "Yester
day." You would expect the
maitre d' and waiters to bristle

at such a display of raucous
ness, right? Not at all—they
looked as pleased and amused
as the Packarditea.
It takes more than wine to
make people that happy. Mad
dalena's owes much ot its repu
tation — and all of its relaxing
effect — to its decor. It's
absolutely beautiful, and an
epitome of elegance. The main
dining room is dark and
spacious, and is furnished with a
few beautiful antique pieces;
large, colorful paintings and
posters, all individually lit,
hang above diners' heads. In the
center of the room there is a
well, from which hangs the
breathtaking crystal chandelier
that has become the restau
rant's hallmark; around the
well is a balcony dining area —
and also, incidentally, the spot
from which musicians (I have
seen harpists and guitarists) oc
casionally play. In addition,
Maddalena's has, at the back of
the second story, a private din

ing room. It comes complete
with its own separate entran
ceway, a fact which has always
conjured up images of faintly il
licit trysts.
The heart of the restaurant,
however, is stage center ot the
downstairs bottom room.
Throughout dinner waiters here
show off their consummate ar
tistry: cherries are flambeed.
Caesar salad dressings pre
pared, and meat carved. It's
fascinating to watch, but the
nice thing is, you don't have to;
although there's a constant bus
tle around the table, the waiters
are careful to be inobtrusive.
Before I talk about the dinner.
I should mention a coincidence.
Maddalena's chef, John Santos,
used to be the head chef at Stan
ford's faculty club. Apparently
he liked the job, but became fed
up in the '60s when a student,
protesting the faculty's
bourgeois taste for good food,
threw a brick through his kitch
en window. That was that, Mr.
Santos said, and he left.
Nobody's throwing any bricks
at Maddalena's. The dinners are
not only wonderful, they are
varied. There are all manner of
shellfish appetizers (oysters,
clams, prawns, etc.), six dif
ferent kinds of salad to choose
from, 24 entrees, including sev
eral pasta dishes and the first
vegetarian plate I have ever
seen in a restaurant of this
caliber, and an unlimited
number of desserts. Unlimited,
I say, because the waiter, mis
taking my indecision for
boredom, insisted that he make
a dessert especially for me.
To start, my partner and I
shared a Maddalena's Salad
($7.50), a combination of hearts
of lettuce, mushrooms, bacon,
and baby shrimp that was so
good it literally stopped «)J con
versation. As far as I'm con
cerned, Maddalena's wins the
area vinaigrette award — no
mean feat considering the com
petition
The entrees we ordered were
Prawns Bordelaise ($14.25) and
the special of the evening, an in
dividual rack of lamb in a lamb
sauce. Both were conversation
stoppers (the evening was a
quiet one), and both wonder
fully light. The prawns were
served in a red wine and garlic

sauce, which I indelicately
mopped up with my bread. (The
bread, it should be mentioned, is
French rather than the usual
sourdough, and served with
sweet butter.) The lamb was in
credibly tender, cooked until the
outside was crusty and the in
side still rare, and served in a
dark, delicate sauce. Mad
dalena's other entrees include a
number of classic veal, beef,
and chicken dishes, various
pasta dishes (mostly at pesto),
sole, salmon and red snapper
dishes, and — something that
few restaurants in the area offer
— Bouillabaise
The vegetables that come
with the entrees should win an
other award: carrots, string
beans, and potatoes were
cooked until just barely tender,
and served glazed in butter —
great. If simplicity bores you,
you can order any of Mad
dalena's special vegetable dish
es: sauteed artichoke hearts
($3.75), mushroom caps sauteed
in sherry (also $3.75), or
Creamed Spinach alia Moscato
($3.50).
Finally, the desserts. I can't
tel! you how flattering it is to
have someone offer to make a
dessert just for you. I was ready
to marry that waiter on the spot.
What's more, he made it look
like fun — with a few dextrous
movements, he whipped togeth
er a sauce of brown sugar and
banana liqueur, poured it over
chunks of banana, and served
the whole thing on top of ice
cream. It was all I could do to
not propose. My partner had the
Chocolate Mousse ($2 75), a
feather-light creation filled
with flecks of bitter chocolate —
another victory.
And so the evening passed
without my being able to find
one* fault. But I have plans:
when I'm about to leave Palo
Alto, if I'm feeling profligate,
I'm going to try once again to
find something bad to say about
Maddalena s. I doubt it I'll have
much luck.
