# Service a problem at Alouette
## 
### Vince Waldman 
On the Peninsula the French
restaurants almost all seem to
follow one of two patterns:
either they are very elegant and
serve the classic, heavy dishes
that define traditional French
cooking in this country, or they
attempt to evoke a provincial
atmosphere and emphasize
lighter meats (though they usu
ally drown the meat in the same
heavy sauces).
Alouette is a good example of
the latter, country-French style
which is so common around
Palo Alto. It is extremely in
formal : the hostess and many of
the waiters wear blue jeans, and
the place is so small that in
timacy is inevitable. About fif
teen tables are crowded into a
room that would comfortably
hold ten. (The menu advises you
to "Please keep an eye on your
coat and hat.) There are also a
few outdoor tables in back.
Still, it is very pretty. A large,
glass storefront window and in
terior brick walls decorated
with ivy give the sensation of
outdoor eating indoors. The
wallpaper is a rose-colored

floral pattern; the same pattern
appears on the back of the one
page menu.
The whole place exudes an
aura of sweetness. Appropriate
ly, then, we were recommended
a bottle of Macon-Villages Pinot
Chardonnay ($12.50) to go with
our orders of rabbit and fish. A
full-bodied white, it was un
deniably delicious but rather too
sweet to cut through the
thickness of the creamy sauces
they put on the food; it was near
ly a dessert wine. The wine list
is small and eclectic, with vin
tages ranging from about $9 to
about $20, as well as a domestic
house wine at $2 a glass.
Dinner comes with bread
(served cold, which is not dis
turbing given that most places
that serve bread hot do so by
putting it in the microwave),
soup, salad, and a small portion
of very nicely cooked vegeta
bles. The soup was vichvsoisse.
but tasted more of light cream
and leeks than of potato (we
weren't sure it was vichvsoisse
until we asked): unusual but
very good. The salad was an
eggy vinaigrette with butter

letuce. The menu also includes a
few standard appetizers: esca
rgots ($3.75), pate ($3.03), onion
soup ($2.50).
The menu lists only five en
trees. and there are a few un
listed daily specials as well. The
menu emphasizes lighter, coun
try-style preparation: coq au
rin ($10.25), veal a Vestragon
(in light cream and tarragon,
($12.95), lamb in spice and
tomato ($12.95); one ot the daily
specials, however, was Beet
Wellington.
The rabbit in mustard sauce
and white wine ($10.50) was
quite good, although (like the
soup) the sauce seemed to em
phasize creamy texture over
flavor. The rabbit itself was ten
der and succulent. We also or
dered vmustadp dr poisson Ar
morirainc (12.50), fish in lobster
sauce served in pastry. This is
the most complicated under
taking on the menu, and by the
casual standards of Alouette is
almost flamboyant: the fish ar
rives in a pastry shell (breadlike
rather than flaky) shaped like a
fish The kitchen lives up to the
