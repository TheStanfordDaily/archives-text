La Fortuna
3180 Middlefield Rd.
Redwood Citv
365-9510
If you want both hot food and a
"hot" time, La Fortuna should
be high on your list.
Inexpensive, genuine Mexi
can food is served up in a homey
atmosphere here. The modest
decor, consisting of Mexican
paintings and natural wooden
furnishings, adds to the authen
ticity of the popular estab
lishment.
La Fortuna opened on El
Camino 27 years ago, but has op
erated in Redwood City tor the
past 20 years.
It is difficult not to feel im
mediately comfortable at La
Fortuna. We recognized several
Stanford students at this eatery.
Many families also seemed to
be enjoying the festive at
mosphere.
Our waitress was not overly
fluent in English, but she served
our orders correctly.
Fortunately we asked for wa
ter — the cooking here may
seem a little spicy for the un
initiated palate. Beverages in
clude Mexican beer, American
beer, tea, soft drinks and Mexi

can hot chocolate.
Our spicy dinner began with a
Mexican restaurant standard —
a small wooden bowl of tortilla
chips, accompanied by an ex
tremely peppery tortilia sauce.
Tortilla chip aficionados should
savor the chips, however, since
the bowl is not refilled.
We began our meal with
nachos. The traditional Mexi
can appetizer was a spicy blend
of beans, cheese and chile pep
pers atop thick chips. The
cheese was good but needed
slightly more melting.
Next on the agenda were
small salads garnished with
radishes, tomatoes and pepper.
After the spicy beginning to
the meal, we welcomed the
bland corn and flour tortillas
which accompanied our entrees
— they were warm and de
licious.
Entree choices range from
low-cal steak to burritos to
enchiladas to tacos to tostados
to chile rellenos. In addition,
breakfast is served anytime.
Entrees, attractively placed
on large oval dishes, were pre
pared to order and served quick
ly. Customary Mexican hot rice
and beans accompanied each
meal — they were a steaming

asset to the main courses. The
beans were saucy, smooth and
topped with parmesan cheese.
Another of our choices, the
hot enchiladas verdes, was an
extremely peppery blend of
cheese, green peppers and on
ions. The enchiladas were made
with a green tomato and hot
green chile sauce and topped
with avocado slices.
The cheese enchilada was an
other fine example ot authentic
Mexican cuisine.
Bunuelos with sugar and cin
namon and bunuelos with Mexi
can syrup are the dessert offer
ings.
About 60 people almost filled
the one-room restaurant. The
atmosphere was bustling and
busy, and no one had to wait tor
a table. No reservations are
needed. Takeout orders are also
available but do not include
tostaditas and tortillas.
The overall air here seemed
cheerful, as we listened to the
buzz of loud voices. We saw a
tape deck by the cash register
but no music was playing on our
visit.
In all, you are guaranteed to
leave La Fortuna in fine spirits.
But be forewarned that your
breath may not be at its best af

ter sampling this spicy cuisine.
Balkan Village
4898 El Camino Real
Los Altos
968-7251
The delightful Greek cuisine
is only part of what you will ex
perience at Balkan Village. The
lively and friendly atmosphere
of a Greek "taverna" has been
successfully recreated by the
owners, Louie and Peggy Gun
dunas. The emphasis at Balkan
Village is not just on assuring
that the customer is pleasantly
stuffed but, in the European
tradition, making sure he is also
fully entertained.
For an appetizer we had the
flaming saganaki cheese which
turned out to be an excellent
choice. Kasseri cheese is cov
ered with lightly fried flour. It is
then flambeed in rum and
doused with lemon juice.
Dinners range from $8.50 to
$12.95 and include soup or salad,
coffee and dessert. The primari
ly Greek dishes include ev
erything from mousaka (baked
meat with eggplant) to
dolmades (meat wrapped in
grape leaves).
My entree choice, the chef's

special ($1.95), included
shishkebab. keftethes (Athe
nian meatballs),
spanakotiropita (spinach
pastry) and dolmades. All en
trees were served with rice pilaf
and a vegetable. The portions of
meat were disappointingly
small but quite good. The
dolmades were particularly
savory.

The area is filled with sub
marine shops. But eastern-style
submarines (hoagies) and
cheese steaks are hard to find.
Captain Cosmo's sandwiches
should ease easterners' hoagie
withdrawal symptoms and offer
others an alternative to the
standard sub.
Hot and cold Cosmo sand
wiches include steak, roast
beef, cheese steak, Canadian
bacon and cheese. Cosmo's can
be ordered in regular size or 9-
to 10-inch super size. Subs are
available on white, wheat, light
rye, dark rye and soft French
rolls.
Captain Cosmo's also otfers
hot dogs for the less adven
turesome and pizza burgers tor
the submarine gourmet. We fell

cial and a hot garden cheese

grilled onions, lettuce and
tomatoes. Like all hot cosmos,
it took about 10 to 15 minutes to
prepare.
The garden cosmo, also a
manageable size, contained the
two cheeses of my choice (jack
and Cheddar), the same fresh
vegetables and the captain's
special sauce.
The large beer selection is an
other specialty at Captain Cos
mo's. Beers include Heineken,
Beck's, Molson Golden. Coors,
Lowenbrau, Miller's and Bud's.
Other beverages include fruit
juices, soft drinks, mineral wa
ter and wine.

ing. old-fashioned photos and
ads framed on the walls and soft
James Taylor background mu
sic blend to create a com
fortable atmosphere.
For such a casual at
mosphere. the delicious food
was exquisitely prepared. Hen
ry's specialties are veal and
fish. My guest and I both or
dered veal (We were drinking
red wine — and besides, how

often do we get to eat a good
meat dish living on a University
meal plan?) I had one of the spe
cials — Escalope of Veal with
Tarragon. The veal was superb.
It was extremely tender and
bathed in a light, mild tarragon
sauce.
My guest had the Emince of
Veal Zurichoise — thin strips of
veal sauteed with shallots,
mushrooms and Madeira, all in
a creamy brown sauce. Again, it
was a delicious dish.
Both veal dishes were served
with carrots, stringbeans and an
outstanding potato pastry.
Pomme Duchesse. Only John
Peterson, the chef, knows its
special seasoning.
As far as fish goes, Henry's
specials are brought in tresh
trom various parts of the coun

specials that evening, were

How many different ways can
omelettes be prepared" 1 We
thought about 20 — until we saw
the 350 combinations listed in
The Cookbook's menu.
And according to Stanley
Roberts, vice-presi
dent general manager of the
three Cookbook restaurants, the
kitchen really offers more than
1000 omelettes, all made with
tour extra-large eggs. Un
surprisingly, Roberts said that
The Cookbook in Pruneyard
uses 35,000 eggs per week.
The amazingly large menu

features several hundred en
trees which are served from 7
a.m. to 0 p.m. seven days a
week. Breakfast, lunch and din
ner entrees are available
throughout the day.
Roberts hopes to appeal par
ticularly to students with the
long hours and casual at
mosphere of the establishment.
The Cookbook even sports pic
tures of Stanford on its walls.
Gingham curtains, small booths
and wooden tables seemed de
signed tor a pleasant dining at
mosphere.
Somewhat overwhelmed by
the huge menu, we decided on
the crabmeat Victorian sand
wich and the Mexican scramble
from our gingham-aproned
waitress.
The crabmeat Victorian
($4.35) consisted of chilled
shredded crabmeat on an Eng
lish muffin, alfalfa sprouts and
a tresh pineapple slice, topped
with melted cheddar cheese.
The crab tasted unfresh. We
found the sandwich to be slight
ly bland, but fruit and potato
salad attractively com
plemented the dish.
The Mexican scramble
($3.95) was a rather unique
combination. (We had expected
a traditional egg dish with a
spicy sauce.) Three eggs with
green beans and onions were
served in a bowl and topped with
cheddar. The interesting mix
ture is not for anyone squeamish
about tasting green beans in an
omelette. The dish is served
with hash browns.
Although we hungrily antici
pated the cornbread which Rob
erts said accompanies all
meals, ours never arrived. But
we did receive an abundant dish
ot onion rings ($.95).

We felt gluttonous but could
not resist the dessert descrip
tions. A mouth-watering, rich
German chocolate cake with
coconut icing ($1.15) and a bowl
ot fresh watermelon, grapes
and melon topped otf our meal.

For those interested in a less
calorific ending, coffee ground
on the premises is also avail
able. Other beverages range
from freshly squeezed orange
and grapefruit juice to hot choc
olate to wine.

La Fortuna
3180 Middlefield Rd.
Redwood Citv
365-9510
If you want both hot food and a
"hot" time, La Fortuna should
be high on your list.
Inexpensive, genuine Mexi
can food is served up in a homey
atmosphere here. The modest
decor, consisting of Mexican
paintings and natural wooden
furnishings, adds to the authen
ticity of the popular estab
lishment.
La Fortuna opened on El
Camino 27 years ago, but has op
erated in Redwood City tor the
past 20 years.
It is difficult not to feel im
mediately comfortable at La
Fortuna. We recognized several
Stanford students at this eatery.
Many families also seemed to
be enjoying the festive at
mosphere.
Our waitress was not overly
fluent in English, but she served
our orders correctly.
Fortunately we asked for wa
ter — the cooking here may
seem a little spicy for the un
initiated palate. Beverages in
clude Mexican beer, American
beer, tea, soft drinks and Mexi

can hot chocolate.
Our spicy dinner began with a
Mexican restaurant standard —
a small wooden bowl of tortilla
chips, accompanied by an ex
tremely peppery tortilia sauce.
Tortilla chip aficionados should
savor the chips, however, since
the bowl is not refilled.
We began our meal with
nachos. The traditional Mexi
can appetizer was a spicy blend
of beans, cheese and chile pep
pers atop thick chips. The
cheese was good but needed
slightly more melting.
Next on the agenda were
small salads garnished with
radishes, tomatoes and pepper.
After the spicy beginning to
the meal, we welcomed the
bland corn and flour tortillas
which accompanied our entrees
— they were warm and de
licious.
Entree choices range from
low-cal steak to burritos to
enchiladas to tacos to tostados
to chile rellenos. In addition,
breakfast is served anytime.
Entrees, attractively placed
on large oval dishes, were pre
pared to order and served quick
ly. Customary Mexican hot rice
and beans accompanied each
meal — they were a steaming

asset to the main courses. The
beans were saucy, smooth and
topped with parmesan cheese.
Another of our choices, the
hot enchiladas verdes, was an
extremely peppery blend of
cheese, green peppers and on
ions. The enchiladas were made
with a green tomato and hot
green chile sauce and topped
with avocado slices.
The cheese enchilada was an
other fine example ot authentic
Mexican cuisine.
Bunuelos with sugar and cin
namon and bunuelos with Mexi
can syrup are the dessert offer
ings.
About 60 people almost filled
the one-room restaurant. The
atmosphere was bustling and
busy, and no one had to wait tor
a table. No reservations are
needed. Takeout orders are also
available but do not include
tostaditas and tortillas.
The overall air here seemed
cheerful, as we listened to the
buzz of loud voices. We saw a
tape deck by the cash register
but no music was playing on our
visit.
In all, you are guaranteed to
leave La Fortuna in fine spirits.
But be forewarned that your
breath may not be at its best af

ter sampling this spicy cuisine.
Balkan Village

968-7251
The delightful Greek cuisine
is only part of what you will ex
perience at Balkan Village. The
lively and friendly atmosphere
of a Greek "taverna" has been
successfully recreated by the
owners, Louie and Peggy Gun
dunas. The emphasis at Balkan
Village is not just on assuring
that the customer is pleasantly
stuffed but, in the European
tradition, making sure he is also
fully entertained.
For an appetizer we had the
flaming saganaki cheese which
turned out to be an excellent
choice. Kasseri cheese is cov
ered with lightly fried flour. It is
then flambeed in rum and
doused with lemon juice.
Dinners range from $8.50 to
$12.95 and include soup or salad,
coffee and dessert. The primari
ly Greek dishes include ev
erything from mousaka (baked
meat with eggplant) to
dolmades (meat wrapped in
grape leaves).
My entree choice, the chef's

special ($1.95), included
shishkebab. keftethes (Athe
nian meatballs),
spanakotiropita (spinach
pastry) and dolmades. All en
trees were served with rice pilaf
and a vegetable. The portions of
meat were disappointingly
small but quite good. The
dolmades were particularly
savory.

it took about 10 to 15 minutes to
prepare.
The garden cosmo, also a
manageable size, contained the
two cheeses of my choice (jack

vegetables and the captain's
special sauce.
The large beer selection is an

cials — Escalope of Veal with
Tarragon. The veal was superb.
It was extremely tender and
bathed in a light, mild tarragon
sauce.
My guest had the Emince of
Veal Zurichoise — thin strips of
veal sauteed with shallots,
mushrooms and Madeira, all in
a creamy brown sauce. Again, it
was a delicious dish.
Both veal dishes were served
with carrots, stringbeans and an

How many different ways can
omelettes be prepared" 1 We
thought about 20 — until we saw
the 350 combinations listed in
The Cookbook's menu.
And according to Stanley
Roberts, vice-presi
dent general manager of the
three Cookbook restaurants, the
kitchen really offers more than
1000 omelettes, all made with
tour extra-large eggs. Un
surprisingly, Roberts said that
The Cookbook in Pruneyard
uses 35,000 eggs per week.
The amazingly large menu

features several hundred en
trees which are served from 7
a.m. to 0 p.m. seven days a
week. Breakfast, lunch and din
ner entrees are available

Roberts hopes to appeal par
ticularly to students with the
long hours and casual at
mosphere of the establishment.
The Cookbook even sports pic
tures of Stanford on its walls.
Gingham curtains, small booths
and wooden tables seemed de
signed tor a pleasant dining at
mosphere.
Somewhat overwhelmed by
the huge menu, we decided on
the crabmeat Victorian sand
wich and the Mexican scramble
from our gingham-aproned
waitress.
The crabmeat Victorian
($4.35) consisted of chilled
shredded crabmeat on an Eng
lish muffin, alfalfa sprouts and
a tresh pineapple slice, topped
with melted cheddar cheese.
The crab tasted unfresh. We
found the sandwich to be slight
ly bland, but fruit and potato
salad attractively com
plemented the dish.
The Mexican scramble
($3.95) was a rather unique
combination. (We had expected
a traditional egg dish with a
spicy sauce.) Three eggs with
green beans and onions were
served in a bowl and topped with
cheddar. The interesting mix
ture is not for anyone squeamish
about tasting green beans in an
omelette. The dish is served
with hash browns.
Although we hungrily antici
pated the cornbread which Rob
erts said accompanies all
meals, ours never arrived. But
we did receive an abundant dish
ot onion rings ($.95).

We felt gluttonous but could
not resist the dessert descrip

La Fortuna
3180 Middlefield Rd.
Redwood Citv
365-9510
If you want both hot food and a
"hot" time, La Fortuna should
be high on your list.
Inexpensive, genuine Mexi
can food is served up in a homey
atmosphere here. The modest
decor, consisting of Mexican
paintings and natural wooden
furnishings, adds to the authen
ticity of the popular estab
lishment.
La Fortuna opened on El
Camino 27 years ago, but has op
erated in Redwood City tor the
past 20 years.
It is difficult not to feel im
mediately comfortable at La
Fortuna. We recognized several
Stanford students at this eatery.
Many families also seemed to
be enjoying the festive at
mosphere.
Our waitress was not overly
fluent in English, but she served
our orders correctly.
Fortunately we asked for wa
ter — the cooking here may
seem a little spicy for the un
initiated palate. Beverages in
clude Mexican beer, American
beer, tea, soft drinks and Mexi

can hot chocolate.
Our spicy dinner began with a
Mexican restaurant standard —
a small wooden bowl of tortilla
chips, accompanied by an ex
tremely peppery tortilia sauce.
Tortilla chip aficionados should
savor the chips, however, since
the bowl is not refilled.
We began our meal with
nachos. The traditional Mexi
can appetizer was a spicy blend
of beans, cheese and chile pep
pers atop thick chips. The
cheese was good but needed
slightly more melting.
Next on the agenda were
small salads garnished with
radishes, tomatoes and pepper.
After the spicy beginning to
the meal, we welcomed the
bland corn and flour tortillas
which accompanied our entrees
— they were warm and de
licious.
Entree choices range from
low-cal steak to burritos to
enchiladas to tacos to tostados
to chile rellenos. In addition,
breakfast is served anytime.
Entrees, attractively placed
on large oval dishes, were pre
pared to order and served quick
ly. Customary Mexican hot rice
and beans accompanied each
meal — they were a steaming

asset to the main courses. The
beans were saucy, smooth and
topped with parmesan cheese.
Another of our choices, the
hot enchiladas verdes, was an
extremely peppery blend of
cheese, green peppers and on
ions. The enchiladas were made
with a green tomato and hot
green chile sauce and topped
with avocado slices.
The cheese enchilada was an
other fine example ot authentic
Mexican cuisine.
Bunuelos with sugar and cin
namon and bunuelos with Mexi
can syrup are the dessert offer
ings.
About 60 people almost filled
the one-room restaurant. The
atmosphere was bustling and
busy, and no one had to wait tor
a table. No reservations are
needed. Takeout orders are also
available but do not include
tostaditas and tortillas.
The overall air here seemed
cheerful, as we listened to the
buzz of loud voices. We saw a
tape deck by the cash register
but no music was playing on our
visit.
In all, you are guaranteed to
leave La Fortuna in fine spirits.
But be forewarned that your
breath may not be at its best af

ter sampling this spicy cuisine.
Balkan Village
4898 El Camino Real
Los Altos
968-7251
The delightful Greek cuisine
is only part of what you will ex
perience at Balkan Village. The
lively and friendly atmosphere
of a Greek "taverna" has been
successfully recreated by the
owners, Louie and Peggy Gun
dunas. The emphasis at Balkan
Village is not just on assuring
that the customer is pleasantly
stuffed but, in the European
tradition, making sure he is also
fully entertained.
For an appetizer we had the
flaming saganaki cheese which
turned out to be an excellent
choice. Kasseri cheese is cov
ered with lightly fried flour. It is
then flambeed in rum and
doused with lemon juice.
Dinners range from $8.50 to
$12.95 and include soup or salad,
coffee and dessert. The primari
ly Greek dishes include ev
erything from mousaka (baked
meat with eggplant) to
dolmades (meat wrapped in
grape leaves).
My entree choice, the chef's

special ($1.95), included
shishkebab. keftethes (Athe
nian meatballs),
spanakotiropita (spinach
pastry) and dolmades. All en
trees were served with rice pilaf
and a vegetable. The portions of
meat were disappointingly
small but quite good. The
dolmades were particularly
savory.
Captain Cosmo's

The area is filled with sub
marine shops. But eastern-style
submarines (hoagies) and
cheese steaks are hard to find.
Captain Cosmo's sandwiches
should ease easterners' hoagie
withdrawal symptoms and offer
others an alternative to the
standard sub.
Hot and cold Cosmo sand
wiches include steak, roast
beef, cheese steak, Canadian
bacon and cheese. Cosmo's can
be ordered in regular size or 9-
to 10-inch super size. Subs are
available on white, wheat, light
rye, dark rye and soft French
rolls.
Captain Cosmo's also otfers
hot dogs for the less adven
turesome and pizza burgers tor
the submarine gourmet. We fell
somewhere in between and or
dered the Captain Cosmo spe
cial and a hot garden cheese

grilled onions, lettuce and
tomatoes. Like all hot cosmos,
it took about 10 to 15 minutes to
prepare.
The garden cosmo, also a
manageable size, contained the
two cheeses of my choice (jack
and Cheddar), the same fresh
vegetables and the captain's
special sauce.
The large beer selection is an
other specialty at Captain Cos
mo's. Beers include Heineken,
Beck's, Molson Golden. Coors,
Lowenbrau, Miller's and Bud's.
Other beverages include fruit
juices, soft drinks, mineral wa
ter and wine.
Henry's

The restaurant itself is a low

bar-like decor. Low-hanging
lights, a high wood-beamed ceil
ing. old-fashioned photos and
ads framed on the walls and soft
James Taylor background mu
sic blend to create a com
fortable atmosphere.
For such a casual at
mosphere. the delicious food
was exquisitely prepared. Hen
ry's specialties are veal and
fish. My guest and I both or
dered veal (We were drinking
red wine — and besides, how

often do we get to eat a good
meat dish living on a University
meal plan?) I had one of the spe
cials — Escalope of Veal with
Tarragon. The veal was superb.
It was extremely tender and
bathed in a light, mild tarragon
sauce.
My guest had the Emince of
Veal Zurichoise — thin strips of
veal sauteed with shallots,
mushrooms and Madeira, all in
a creamy brown sauce. Again, it
was a delicious dish.
Both veal dishes were served
with carrots, stringbeans and an
outstanding potato pastry.
Pomme Duchesse. Only John
Peterson, the chef, knows its
special seasoning.
As far as fish goes, Henry's
specials are brought in tresh
trom various parts of the coun
try. In fact, the Swordfish
Maitre'D was flown in that day

specials that evening, were
Salmon Ciboulette. Halibut Pro

How many different ways can
omelettes be prepared" 1 We
thought about 20 — until we saw
the 350 combinations listed in
The Cookbook's menu.
And according to Stanley
Roberts, vice-presi
dent general manager of the
three Cookbook restaurants, the
kitchen really offers more than
1000 omelettes, all made with
tour extra-large eggs. Un
surprisingly, Roberts said that
The Cookbook in Pruneyard
uses 35,000 eggs per week.
The amazingly large menu

features several hundred en
trees which are served from 7
a.m. to 0 p.m. seven days a
week. Breakfast, lunch and din
ner entrees are available
throughout the day.
Roberts hopes to appeal par
ticularly to students with the
long hours and casual at
mosphere of the establishment.
The Cookbook even sports pic
tures of Stanford on its walls.
Gingham curtains, small booths
and wooden tables seemed de
signed tor a pleasant dining at
mosphere.
Somewhat overwhelmed by
the huge menu, we decided on
the crabmeat Victorian sand
wich and the Mexican scramble
from our gingham-aproned
waitress.
The crabmeat Victorian
($4.35) consisted of chilled
shredded crabmeat on an Eng
lish muffin, alfalfa sprouts and
a tresh pineapple slice, topped
with melted cheddar cheese.
The crab tasted unfresh. We
found the sandwich to be slight
ly bland, but fruit and potato
salad attractively com
plemented the dish.
The Mexican scramble
($3.95) was a rather unique
combination. (We had expected
a traditional egg dish with a
spicy sauce.) Three eggs with
green beans and onions were
served in a bowl and topped with
cheddar. The interesting mix
ture is not for anyone squeamish
about tasting green beans in an
omelette. The dish is served
with hash browns.
Although we hungrily antici
