# Wine country awaits nearby; bring a friend
## 
### 
Not that visiting wineries is
the only thing to do in Northern
California, but there really
aren't to many places that don't
have at least one winery nearby.
Seems like any little jaunt to the
countryside can include a brief
stop tor local conversation and a
tew taste treats.
Spring is the most beautiful
time of the year to travel around
the vineyards because the hills
are green, the vines are just
starting to sprout shoots on their
twisted, gnarled trunks and wild
mustard is everywhere.
Frankly, the whole scene is so
damn romantic that I simply
cannot be held responsible it you
take one of these trips with
someone of the opposite sex and
later find yourself overly in
volved. Discipline and mental
rigidity are difficult to maintain
while frolicking in the Chesbro
Reservoir after an afternoon of
tasting wine in the Hecker Pass.
Several wineries exist within
a few miles ot Stanford should
gasoline be a problem. These
places are quite small though
and it would be prudent to call
them ahead of your visit to
make sure that someone will be
around.
Usually, these three wineries
are open one weekend each
month. Page Mill Winery

(94B-0958) is on Page Mill Road
not far beyond the freeway.
Sherrill Cellars (851-1932) is un
der the Post Office in Woodside,
and Woodside Vineyards
(851-7475) is half a mile up Kings
Mt. Road toward Huddart Park.
All three of these wineries re
flect the family operation ap
proach which is starting to
blossom all over the United
States. They do not make very
much wine and are able to sell it
all at the winery without the
added expense ot going through
distributors and retailers.
Likewise, they can make
wines the way they like them
rather than trying to please the
median tastes ot the mass mar
ket. Hence their wines tend to be
very distinctive and thus good
examples from which to learn
about the intricacies of grape
growing and wine making. All
three winemakers are charm
ing, knowledgeable people who
make visits a real delight.
Most tourists interested in
wine want to visit Napa Valley
because of its widespread repu
tation. Unfortunately, the
crowds drawn by the reputation
make most visits somewhat of
an ordeal.
You won't be invited to taste
the best wines and you won't be
lieve how long it takes to get

back if you have to come across
the Golden Gate Bridge late on a
Sunday afternoon. My sugges
tion for visiting Napa is to go
during the week.
A much closer and more hos
pitable trip is to go south and see
the range of wineries operating
in the Santa Clara Valley. Big
ones like Paul Masson and
Mirassou have nice tour pro
grams and elegant tasting
rooms. They make several ex
cellent wines (mostly from
grapes grown in the Salinas Val
ley) in addition to the mass
merchandised, rather pedestri
an products which comprise
most of their large volume.
A visit to either of these facil

ities provides an interesting
contrast to the tiny, family
wineries of the Hecker Pass:
technology and corporate capi
tal versus love of the soil and
hands stained red from the pro
duction of an important part of
the family's diet.
Hecker Pass is about 45
minutes driving time from Stan
ford. Once there, several
wineries are within walking dis
tance ot each other. Picnic
areas are convenient and the
gently rolling hills make bicycle
exploration ot the area very
pleasant. The wineries all have
tasting rooms, but they are not
the tourist spectacles that have
turned Napa into another Dis
neyland.

To get to Hecker Pass, drive
south on Highway 101 and con
tinue into the town of Morgan
Hill rather than taking the left
hand jog that would put you out
on the freeway. Drive through
Morgan Hill and turn right on
Highway 152 toward Watson
ville (there is a mushroom farm
at that corner). Follow that
road all the way around to
where it dead ends in Hecker
Pass Road.
At that point you can turn to
your left and visit Live Oak or
Bertero, turn to your right and
visit Hecker Pass or Fortino, or
walk straight ahead and catch
the very entertaining and eccen
tric Thomas Kruse.

are open one weekend each
month. Page Mill Winery

(94B-0958) is on Page Mill Road
not far beyond the freeway.
Sherrill Cellars (851-1932) is un
der the Post Office in Woodside,
and Woodside Vineyards
(851-7475) is half a mile up Kings
Mt. Road toward Huddart Park.
All three of these wineries re
flect the family operation ap
proach which is starting to
blossom all over the United
States. They do not make very
much wine and are able to sell it
all at the winery without the
added expense ot going through
distributors and retailers.
Likewise, they can make
wines the way they like them
rather than trying to please the
median tastes ot the mass mar
ket. Hence their wines tend to be
very distinctive and thus good
examples from which to learn
about the intricacies of grape
growing and wine making. All
three winemakers are charm
ing, knowledgeable people who
make visits a real delight.
Most tourists interested in
wine want to visit Napa Valley
because of its widespread repu
tation. Unfortunately, the
crowds drawn by the reputation
make most visits somewhat of
an ordeal.
You won't be invited to taste
the best wines and you won't be
lieve how long it takes to get

back if you have to come across
the Golden Gate Bridge late on a
Sunday afternoon. My sugges
tion for visiting Napa is to go
during the week.
A much closer and more hos
pitable trip is to go south and see
the range of wineries operating
in the Santa Clara Valley. Big
ones like Paul Masson and
Mirassou have nice tour pro
grams and elegant tasting
rooms. They make several ex
cellent wines (mostly from
grapes grown in the Salinas Val
ley) in addition to the mass
merchandised, rather pedestri
an products which comprise
most of their large volume.
A visit to either of these facil

ities provides an interesting
contrast to the tiny, family
wineries of the Hecker Pass:
technology and corporate capi
tal versus love of the soil and
hands stained red from the pro
duction of an important part of
the family's diet.
Hecker Pass is about 45
minutes driving time from Stan
ford. Once there, several
wineries are within walking dis
tance ot each other. Picnic
areas are convenient and the
gently rolling hills make bicycle
exploration ot the area very
pleasant. The wineries all have
tasting rooms, but they are not
the tourist spectacles that have
turned Napa into another Dis
neyland.

To get to Hecker Pass, drive
south on Highway 101 and con
tinue into the town of Morgan
Hill rather than taking the left
hand jog that would put you out
on the freeway. Drive through
Morgan Hill and turn right on
Highway 152 toward Watson
ville (there is a mushroom farm
at that corner). Follow that
road all the way around to
where it dead ends in Hecker
Pass Road.
At that point you can turn to
your left and visit Live Oak or
Bertero, turn to your right and
visit Hecker Pass or Fortino, or
walk straight ahead and catch
the very entertaining and eccen
tric Thomas Kruse.
