# Getting away to local splendors
## 
### 
There will always be days and
weekends when you'll want to
get out from under the shadow
of Hoover Tower. There will
also be moments when you will
want to get away but will only
have the time or means to go a
few miles.
Whatever the case, you can
get away from it all at a count
less number of fun, beautiful
and interesting places in

Northern California. Some are
just down the street, while oth
ers are across the state, but
almost all have such enjoyable
features that after a visit to one
or more, you will probably re
turn thinking that life at Stan
ford only begins on the Farm.
For the birds
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-minute
bike ride away, lie the Palo Alto

Bavlands, a favorite stop-over
for birds traveling on the Pacif
ic Flyway. These birds, includ
ing egrets, willets, ducks and
more ducks, feed closest to the
shore at the ebb of a very high
tide. An interpretive center at
the Baylands (329-2506) sched
ules films and lectures about
Bay ecology, and all visitors are
welcome to take their own tour
over the marshlands on miles of
inter-connecting wooden walk
ways.
The Stanford foothills behind
Lake Lagunita offer good views
of the Bay, a place to go on a
mini-hike and many lovely spots
tor picnicking. A number of
stairways over the fence adja
cent to Junipero Serra Blvd.

enable you to pick your own
trail.
Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, but if you can find a
phone bill, or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address, you
can get in to enjoy the open
spaces. Dusk is the time to
watch the small groups of deer
that teed on the watered green

grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering
trails.
For those who enjoy amuse
ment parks. Marine World-
Africa USA is a 60-acre park
that features performing jungle

and sea animals. It is located
north of Stanford on Highway
10' , in Redwood City (365-7446).
Santa Clara thrills
South of campus, near Santa
Clara, the Marriott Corporation
has its five-year-old, mammoth
Great America theme park,
which sports many wild "thrill"
rides tor the strong of stomach
and brave at heart.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mountain Road in Woods
ide, is only 30 minutes away
from campus by car. Drivers
and bicyclists who want to take

a scenic route to the park should
drive out Sand Hill to Portola
Road, turn right and then con
tinue on Old Country Road to
Woodside Road. Turn right
there, and then left on Kings
Mountain. The park offers na
ture trails, volleyball courts,
picnic areas and other recrea
tional tacilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches, but
in this area, they are mainly tor
surfing and sunning; even the
best of swimmers should be
wary of the cold waters and
strong undertow.
Before you head for the
ocean, check the weather re
port. The beaches are often
foggy, even when Stanford is
roasting. In mid-winter, how
ever, you can often enjoy a sun
ny day on an uncrowded stretch
of sand.
Highway 1 between Halt
Moon Bay and Santa Cruz is
dotted with spectacular, clitf
bordered beaches; some of the
favorite include San Gregorio
and Pomponio. (For those who
prefer to sun without a suit,
there's the public beach at Bon
ny Doone, 10 miles north of San
ta Cruz, and the private beach
one mile north of the state beach
at San Gregorio.)
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent
elephant seals at Ano Nuevo
beach, to which they migrate
during the mating season. And if
you simply must go ocean swim
ming, the beaches in the Santa
Cruz area and south are rela
tively safe — but still cold.
Hiking nearby
For day trips or longer, Big
Basin, home of tine stands of
California Redwoods and wild
lite, is just an hour and a halt
away by car, or tour to five
hours by bike. Head up Page
Mill Road to Skyline Boulevard,
then turn left, keeping your eyes
open for signs to Big Basin and
breathtaking views of moun
tains and the sea. It's a right
turn on Highway 9 and then
down Highway 236 to the park
headquarters. From there, hun
dreds of miles of trails can lead
you to mountain peaks or down
to the ocean.
Or, take four hours by car to
drive down to Point Lobos Pre
serve, a beautiful seascape area
complete with sea otters, ocean
spray, and hiking trails. Point
Lobos is approximately seven
miles past Carmel, itself a
charming place to visit if you
like to shop. In addition, the
nearby town of Monterey is tull
of California history, dating
from the days of Spanish mis
sions and later, John Stein
beck's novels.
