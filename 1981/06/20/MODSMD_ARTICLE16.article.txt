# Getting away to local splendors
## 
### 
There will always be days and
weekends when you'll want to
get out from under the shadow
of Hoover Tower. There will
also be moments when you will
want to get away but will only
have the time or means to go a
few miles.
Whatever the case, you can
get away from it all at a count
less number of fun, beautiful
and interesting places in

Northern California. Some are
just down the street, while oth
ers are across the state, but
almost all have such enjoyable
features that after a visit to one
or more, you will probably re
turn thinking that life at Stan
ford only begins on the Farm.
For the birds
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-minute
bike ride away, lie the Palo Alto

Bavlands, a favorite stop-over
for birds traveling on the Pacif
ic Flyway. These birds, includ
ing egrets, willets, ducks and
more ducks, feed closest to the
shore at the ebb of a very high
tide. An interpretive center at
the Baylands (329-2506) sched
ules films and lectures about
Bay ecology, and all visitors are
welcome to take their own tour
