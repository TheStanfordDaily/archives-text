# Parcourse FITness can be fun... but don't get lost
## 
### 
Not all courses here are
classes — ask runners of the
Perrier. fitness course around
Roble and Lake Lagunita.
The balanced, self-guiding
Parcourse system was dedi
cated officially last Oct. 31,
making Stanford one of 200 com
munities with the trail.
The University paid $2000 tor
the initial construction. Lack of
funding stalled production in
1978 until Bruce Nevins, presi
dent of Perrier and an alumnus
of the Graduate School of Busi
ness, footed the rest of the bill.
The entire set-up cost $6400.
Course description
Similar to (but more scenic
than) the Olympic Gamefield at
Angell Field, the Parcourse is
heartily recommended for those
interested in cardiovascular fit
ness. Exercises include warm
ups and stretching, strengthen
ing and toning.
Each of the 18 "holes" (ex
ercise stations) works the heart
and blood vessel network and a
different muscle group of the
skeleton system. The first sta
tions (in front of Roble) concen
trate on stretching. Subsequent
"holes" work on the lower and
upper body.
Resist the impulse to skip
measuring your heart rate at
the start of the trail, since the

check provides a good measure
of cardiovascular conditioning.
You should rate well it you aim
for FIT, the Parcourse acronym
for frequency, intensity and
time of your training exercise.
The trail is challenging to
both novices and Parcourse ad
dicts. Each "hole" offers start
ing, sporting and championship
par suggestions. Starting par
for chin-ups, for example, is
only one
Timin \ the run offers another
gauge of improvement. The
course runs about IV2 miles and
takes about 25 minutes to com
plete — if all goes well and ac
cording to schedule. Un
fortunately for some first-tim
ers. this time estimate assumes
both a certain minimal level of
fitness and a sense of direction.
Despite warnings bv veteran
Parcourse runners and the in
structional signs with arrows
pointing to the rest of the
course, we managed to get lost.
If you are a novice, be wary of
the jumping jacks station. Oth
erwise, you may join us in need
ing to run an additional mile be
tween the fifth and sixth sta
tions.
Peak times — when trail traf
fic is heavy — are Sunday morn
ings and right before dinner. Al
legedly, running the course en

hances the taste of meals.
We found the stations to be a
relief since they are relatively
stationary. The sit-up hole even
provides a wooden seat. Need
less to say, this was a favorite
station.
The high bar is just that: high.
But, as in most of the other sta
tions, there are three height or
difficulty options. So, barring
any major arm disorders, you
should be able to chin-up and
take it. Just strengthen your re
solve along with your muscles.
There will be time to beam
later if you finish the last station
without losing your balance on
the slender board.
We also appreciated the close
placement of the first stations
which helped us "warm up" to
the course both physically and
psychologically. (Our "tone"
improved in the same manner!)
"Total exercise" can be em
barrassing, however. Some of
the exercises, such as kicking
the legs from side repeatedly,
are performed along Campus
Drive. One student even re
ported seeing a Peeping Tom
lurking near the toe-touch sta
tion.
Overall, the exercise pro
gram is tit for an amateur new
to the athletic field or for a pro.
So, of course you should dash

over to Roble and begin a firm
campaign to combat flab. With
a flexible schedule — and body
— you can enjoy the Parcourse
. . . or so rumor has it!
If you are like me and have to
jog your memory to recall the
last time you ran, decide to
sweat it out. I stretched my im-

agination — and body — and am
still alive.
Afterwards, you can shower
yourself with water and praise.
And if all this fails to entice you,
remember that the course ends
near The Store. Whether you de
cide to buy the water produced
by the course's sponsor is up to
you.
