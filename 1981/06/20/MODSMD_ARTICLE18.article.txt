Have you ever thought you'd
like to see the real "Golden
Spike?" Are you an avid con
chologist or mineralogist?
If so, you can find such treas
ures right here on campus.
Listed below are some little
known or often forgotten places
to visit when you feel in need of a
study break or want to do some
nearby exploring.
The Physics Explorama on
the second floor of the Varian
Physics Lab is a do-it-yourself
physics museum, with experi
ments and changing displays
that invite visitor participation.
The Explorama is open week
days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., tele
phone 497-4233.
The University Museum of
Art, located between Hoover
Tower and the Quad, houses
smaller, changing exhibits. Ad
mission to the museum, open 0
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Friday, and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday, also is tree.
The Museum also houses col
lections of early American art,
oriental jade. Leland Stanford
Junior's toys, a fantastic 9 -
piece exhibit of Rodin
sculpture, and yes, the actual
"Golden Spike." which Leland
Stanford Sr. and his fellow rail
road magnates pounded into the
rails upon the completion of the
transcontinental railroad.
Tours are available Thursday at
2:15 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m.
For a quiet place to stroll or
just to sit and think, you might
visit the Stantord family

Mausoleum, or the nearby cac
tus gardens, both found in the
northeast section of the
Arboretum. It's different . . .
and actually quite lovely.
And, perhaps for rainy days,
anyone who's ever combed a
beach will enjoy the conchology
(sea shell) collection tucked up
under the eaves on the third
floor of Geology Corner (in the
Quad, room 341). You can stop
by from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday
through Friday, except during
lunchtime. Telephone 497-2537 it
is recommended that you call
ahead to check.
Another collection — thanks
again to the Geology Dept. —
may be found upstairs in
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build

ing, right outside the library,
where a display of spectactriw
minerals from all over the
world is on view.
In the lobby of the Coffee
House in Tresidder, you can
often find a photograph exhibit
that features the work of local
artists. The exhibits usually in
clude landscapes and "human
interest" candid shots in black
and white.
And the University's Rare
Book Collection is kept in the
Bender Room of the Main Li
brary — a cluttered, interesting
browsing room filled with an
tiques. The Bender Room is
open Monday through Friday, 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday 9
a.m. to noon, 497-4054.
