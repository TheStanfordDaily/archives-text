# Attractions in the City
## 
### 
San Francisco probably has
more to commend it than any
other city in the United States.
It has so much geographical,
cultural and ideological diver
sity, so many unique aspects, so
many positive attractions, that
it is difficult to think of a city
which rivals it.
Many students have made the
City their favorite Friday or
Saturday night destination.
Some go up to drink, some go up
to dance, but the majority go up
just to 1,1 cruise around." Ev
eryone has his favorite street or
square but the following are
among the most frequently vis
ited attractions:
Cable Cars: Three different
lines serve the City. The fare is
50 cents, and you can ask for a
transfer, which is good on any
cable car, street or bus.
Powell-Hyde starts at the
turntable at Powell and Market,
climbs Nob Hill, turns west and
turns around at Victorian Park,
next to Ghirardelli Square

Powell-Mason starts at Mar
ket Street, goes up Nob Hill and
through North Beach to Bay
Street, near Fisherman's
Whart.

Because ot San Francisco's
role in the development of rock
music, the Bay Area has an ex
tremely good reputation in the
music industry. Bands and ar
tists ot varying size and tame
usually include a spot in the
area on their itineraries.
What follows is a summary of
the main arenas and pavilions in
the area that host touring music
performers:
Cow Palace. A large, general
purpose auditorium that fea
tures performers likely to draw
crowds of more than 10,000. Ca
pacity: about 13,000. Geneva
and Santos, San Francisco (otf
Bayshore Blvd., near
Brisbane).
Oakland-Alameda County
Coliseum Stadium and Arena.
Bill Graham's Days on the
Green, which usually feature
four or five big name per
tormers. are held at the stadi
um, which can hold 60,000, give
or take a few. The arena is of the
basketball and hockey variety
and has a capacity of about
6,000. Fair acoustics. Hegen
berger Road and Highway 17.
Zellerbach Auditorium. Very
nice. An acoustically superb

auditorium on the UC-Berkeley
campus near Bancroft Ave. The
auditorium tends to have the
more mellow variety of enter
tainers.
Greek Theatre. Designed in
the shape of an ancient Greek
amphitheatre, this gift of the in
imitable William Randolph
Hearst is built out of slabs of
granite, which bounce the sound
around and. on hot days, reflect
the heat. Capacity: about 9000
In the rear of the campus, next
to the stadium.
Paramount Theatre. A very
comfortable and enjoyable
place to hear good music. Ca
pacity: approximately 3200.
Broadway and West Grand.
Oakland.
Berkeley Community
Theatre. Not as new as
Zellerbach but newer than Par
amount. Excellent acoustics.
Capacity: approximately 3500.
Ashton and Grove, Berkeley.
Concord Pavilion. An in
teresting combination of out
door reserved and "festival"
seating, the pavilion has a cov
ered section ot seats and a sepa
rate, surrounding grass area.
The sound in the reserved seats

is sometimes too loud, because
the music has to be heard in the
festival area. Capacity: approx
imately 5000 . 2000 Kirker Pass
Road, Concord.
Center for the Performing
Arts. Perhaps the best
auditorium in the Bay Area, it is
less than eight years old. Capac
ity: about 3000. Almaden and
Park. San Jose.
Circle Star Theatre. The re
volving stage of this theatre-in
the-round usually earns the
scorn ot performers, but the
theatre's acoustics are more
than adequate. Capacity: ap
proximately 2000. 1717 In
dustrial Road. San Carlos.
Frost Amphitheater. Right
here on the Stanford campus.
Frost will seat about 0,000 in a
beautiful alcove behind Memo
rial Auditorium. It has at
tracted performers such as
Harry Chapin and Joan Baez in
the past, but its future is
clouded by the recent demise of
ASSU Special Events and the at
tendant confusion over who can
stage concerts in the Am
phitheater. Rumor has it that
activity there will resume this
summer.
