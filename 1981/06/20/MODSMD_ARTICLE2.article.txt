Welcome to Stanford, and welcome to the Summer
Visitor's Guide, a publication of somewhat illusory
timeliness bringing information and. I hope, pleasure
to its readers.
As its name implies, the guide is aimed at those of
you who are new to the University, those visiting pro
fessionals, students and professors not yet ac
quainted with the ways and means of traversing these
illustrious 8800 acres. And so it is that I have included
those timeless (it not timely) articles which, one
hopes, will at least introduce to you some of the
area's finer points of interest.
In addition to a hands-on guide to campus culture,
you will tind information about those places of in
terest located off-campus as well. Restaurants, con
cert halls, parks for hiking and amusement,
museums — and a special article entitled "City of
wonder: something for everyone," which highlights
those major San Francisco attractions of interest to
everyone who gets as near to them as Palo Alto — all
are included as part of a visitor's guide to this
marvelous place.
