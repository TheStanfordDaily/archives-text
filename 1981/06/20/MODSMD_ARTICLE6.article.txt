# Stanford history profile: from quake to fire
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
ot 189 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises ... the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono di
versified by thickets ot
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its fa
vorable climate assured by its
situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant ot Endowment
with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent ot Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect,
Fi Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfleld site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the toot
hills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical
tor later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen

eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained
for the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Collidge, to de
velop this concept in the style of
his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European Roman
esque, which is characterized
by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short col
umns with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 2
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and
three engineering buildings, En
cina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready tor
the University's opening on Oc
tober ', 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jor
dan said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White ot
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beau
tiful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning ot April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mil
lions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel
ot Memorial Church, and the
concussion blew out tho front
wall. The rose window and the
huge Venetian mosaic of toe
Sermon on the Mount that had
graced the facade lay as rubble
in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure ot the outer quad —
01 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short ot completion. None of
these was replaced.

Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt,
pursuing a construction project
that was begun in 886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
Tho construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved Dy toe Board ot
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised tor the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the foot
hills.
The areas designated for light
use lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research

in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 7 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by the
president and his staft, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the outer
quad was completed in 903, the
same year that Memorial
Church was dedicated.

The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers ot no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality
of the soul, the existence ot an
all-wise and benevolent

Creator, and that obedience to
His laws is the highest duty of
man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans, the cen
tral site now occupied by the
church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford

Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permission

"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.

the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven
ice. but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was nev
er rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover Me
morial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World
War I when he headed the Com
mission tor Relief in Belgium.

relief work placed him in a posi
tion to document the war. Hoo
ver shipped crates of material
to the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the liter
ary foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this in
stitution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on
Benito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record on
Adolf Hitler and the Nazi move

ment extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems ot social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall
(auditorium), dedicated in 937
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I, the
auditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal
point of the plaza is a tall, free
form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco
sculptor Aristides Demetrios.

ot Donald Bertrand Tresidder.
alumnus and fourth president ot
the University, contains the
usual student union facilities ot
food service, small store,
lounge and student government
offices.
The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its quarters in '959. The $21
million structure consists ot
three sections — the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown li
brary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the
classrooms and moot court; the
James Irvine Gallery, which

The University's "front door",
contains the faculty and student
meeting rooms and lounges;
and 600-person Kresge
Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains a
unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral,
redwoods, streams and pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of ionospheric
and interplanetary radio in
vestigations. Its scientists
made the first radar contact
with the sun.

planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million ma

chine, financed by the Atomic
Energy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Univer
sity drew to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet the
needs engendered by its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
Now, however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building
projects tor the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new mu
sic facility behind Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction has begun on a new $25
million, 800-student dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event last year necessitated
more construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was

gutted by fire. Construction es
timated at a cost of $1.4 million
is underway.
But construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend large
ly on the beneticience of Univer
sity donors (including the feder
al government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.
Stanford may not always be
as lucky as it was last year, for
instance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate and
replant the "Oval" in front of
the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con
tinue to build right through the
00th anniversary of that day in
886 when Senator Stanford de
cided to locate his new univer
sity on the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its quarters in '959. The $21
million structure consists ot
three sections — the hospital,

teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown li
brary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the
classrooms and moot court; the
James Irvine Gallery, which

The University's "front door",
contains the faculty and student
meeting rooms and lounges;
and 600-person Kresge
Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains a
unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral,
redwoods, streams and pools.

smasher on 460 acres along Sand

chine, financed by the Atomic
Energy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Univer
sity drew to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet the
needs engendered by its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
Now, however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building
projects tor the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new mu
sic facility behind Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction has begun on a new $25
million, 800-student dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event last year necessitated
more construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was

gutted by fire. Construction es
timated at a cost of $1.4 million
is underway.
But construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend large
ly on the beneticience of Univer
sity donors (including the feder
al government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.
Stanford may not always be
as lucky as it was last year, for
instance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate and
replant the "Oval" in front of
the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con
tinue to build right through the
00th anniversary of that day in
886 when Senator Stanford de
cided to locate his new univer
sity on the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
ot 189 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises ... the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono di
versified by thickets ot
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its fa
vorable climate assured by its
situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant ot Endowment
with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent ot Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect,
Fi Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfleld site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the toot
hills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical
tor later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen

eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained
for the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Collidge, to de
velop this concept in the style of
his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European Roman
esque, which is characterized
by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short col
umns with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 2
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and
three engineering buildings, En
cina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready tor
the University's opening on Oc
tober ', 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jor
dan said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White ot
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beau
tiful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning ot April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mil
lions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel
ot Memorial Church, and the
concussion blew out tho front

main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White

The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its quarters in '959. The $21
million structure consists ot
three sections — the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown li
brary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the
classrooms and moot court; the
James Irvine Gallery, which

The University's "front door",
contains the faculty and student
meeting rooms and lounges;
and 600-person Kresge
Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains a
unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral,
redwoods, streams and pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm

varied programs of ionospheric
and interplanetary radio in

The Stanford Linear Ac

smasher on 460 acres along Sand

chine, financed by the Atomic
Energy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Univer
sity drew to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet the
needs engendered by its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
Now, however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building
projects tor the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new mu
sic facility behind Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction has begun on a new $25
million, 800-student dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event last year necessitated
more construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was

gutted by fire. Construction es
timated at a cost of $1.4 million
is underway.
But construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend large
ly on the beneticience of Univer
sity donors (including the feder
al government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.
Stanford may not always be
as lucky as it was last year, for
instance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate and
replant the "Oval" in front of
the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con
tinue to build right through the
00th anniversary of that day in
886 when Senator Stanford de
cided to locate his new univer
sity on the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
ot 189 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises ... the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono di
versified by thickets ot
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its fa
vorable climate assured by its
situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant ot Endowment
with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent ot Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect,
Fi Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfleld site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the toot
hills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical
tor later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen

eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained
for the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Collidge, to de
velop this concept in the style of
his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European Roman
esque, which is characterized
by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short col
umns with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 2
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and
three engineering buildings, En
cina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready tor
the University's opening on Oc
tober ', 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jor
dan said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White ot
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beau
tiful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning ot April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mil
lions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel
ot Memorial Church, and the
concussion blew out tho front
wall. The rose window and the
huge Venetian mosaic of toe
Sermon on the Mount that had
graced the facade lay as rubble
in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure ot the outer quad —
01 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short ot completion. None of
these was replaced.

Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt,
pursuing a construction project
that was begun in 886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
Tho construction has taken
place on approximately 5000

Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Univer
sity drew to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet the
needs engendered by its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
Now, however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building
projects tor the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new mu
sic facility behind Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction has begun on a new $25
million, 800-student dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event last year necessitated
more construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was

gutted by fire. Construction es
timated at a cost of $1.4 million
is underway.
But construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend large
ly on the beneticience of Univer
sity donors (including the feder
al government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.
Stanford may not always be
as lucky as it was last year, for
instance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate and
replant the "Oval" in front of
the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con
tinue to build right through the
00th anniversary of that day in
886 when Senator Stanford de
cided to locate his new univer
sity on the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
ot 189 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises ... the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono di
versified by thickets ot
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its fa
vorable climate assured by its
situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant ot Endowment
with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent ot Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect,
Fi Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfleld site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the toot
hills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical
tor later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen

eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained
for the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Collidge, to de
velop this concept in the style of
his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European Roman
esque, which is characterized
by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short col
umns with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 2
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and
three engineering buildings, En
cina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready tor
the University's opening on Oc
tober ', 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jor
dan said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White ot
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beau
tiful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning ot April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mil
lions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel
ot Memorial Church, and the
concussion blew out tho front
wall. The rose window and the
huge Venetian mosaic of toe
Sermon on the Mount that had
graced the facade lay as rubble
in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure ot the outer quad —
01 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short ot completion. None of
these was replaced.

Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt,
pursuing a construction project
that was begun in 886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
Tho construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved Dy toe Board ot
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised tor the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the foot
hills.
The areas designated for light
use lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research

in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 7 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by the
president and his staft, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the outer
quad was completed in 903, the
same year that Memorial
Church was dedicated.

"inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the sand
stone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers ot no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality
of the soul, the existence ot an
all-wise and benevolent

Creator, and that obedience to
His laws is the highest duty of
man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans, the cen
tral site now occupied by the
church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford
.», am. Ms vriUuw tier
termined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permission
to copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are

the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven
ice. but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was nev
er rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover Me
morial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World
War I when he headed the Com
mission tor Relief in Belgium.
Struck with the thought that his
relief work placed him in a posi
tion to document the war. Hoo
ver shipped crates of material
to the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the liter
ary foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this in
stitution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on
Benito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record on
Adolf Hitler and the Nazi move

ment extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems ot social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial

(auditorium), dedicated in 937

contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I, the
auditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal
point of the plaza is a tall, free

The Stanford School of Medi
cine moved from San Francisco
into its quarters in '959. The $21
million structure consists ot
three sections — the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million facil

buildings: the Robert Crown li
