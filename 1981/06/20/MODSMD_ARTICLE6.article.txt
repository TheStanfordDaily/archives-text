# Stanford history profile: from quake to fire
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
ot 189 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises ... the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono di
versified by thickets ot
chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its fa
vorable climate assured by its
situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant ot Endowment
with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent ot Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect,
Fi Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfleld site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the toot
hills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the Bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt
the flat site was more practical
tor later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen

eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained
for the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Collidge, to de
velop this concept in the style of
his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Rich
ardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European Roman
esque, which is characterized
by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short col
umns with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 2
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and
three engineering buildings, En
cina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready tor
the University's opening on Oc
tober ', 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jor
dan said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White ot
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beau
tiful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning ot April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mil
lions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel
ot Memorial Church, and the
concussion blew out tho front
wall. The rose window and the
huge Venetian mosaic of toe
Sermon on the Mount that had
graced the facade lay as rubble
in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure ot the outer quad —
01 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short ot completion. None of
these was replaced.

Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt,
pursuing a construction project
that was begun in 886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
Tho construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved Dy toe Board ot
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised tor the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the foot
hills.
The areas designated for light
use lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research

in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 7 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by the
president and his staft, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the outer
quad was completed in 903, the
same year that Memorial
Church was dedicated.

The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers ot no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality
of the soul, the existence ot an
all-wise and benevolent

Creator, and that obedience to
His laws is the highest duty of
man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans, the cen
tral site now occupied by the
church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford
.», am. Ms vriUuw tier
termined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permission
to copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
