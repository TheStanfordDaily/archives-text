# Rodin: timeless art
## 
### 
The marble pillars, the co
lonnades and staircases, the
sense of timelessness. and the
cool stillness that fills the foyer
of the Stanford University
Museum of Art are impressive.
But the step beyond the over
elaborate entrvway and into the
small room at the end ot the hall w
— the Auguste Rodin exhibit —
is overwhelming.
At first one is struck by the
contrast of bronze against stark
white bases and stark white
walls. However, this sense ot
dark upon light lasts only a few
moments betore it is swept
away by the figures themselves.
Every piece seems to be in
motion. A quick glance around
the room, and one teels sur
rounded by a crowd of reching,
reclining and entwining figures
which embody the magic ot
Rodin in every gesture.
The gallery is named alter
B.G. Cantor, who donated 90
pieces to the museum in 1974.
Stanford was one of three reci
pients of Cantor's efforts to in
sure the placement of the
world's largest private collec
tion (127 pieces* in museums
that would use it for teaching
and research.
Stanford's exhibit includes
textual and photographic mate-

rial, providing background to
Rodin's life, context to his art.
and giving emphasis to the di
versity of his work.
In many ways Rodin was a
traditionalist, working within
his 19th century classical
heritage. Yet he is often called
the father of modern sculpture.
Museum docent Lynn Gibbons,
said, "he single-handedly re
vitalized the sculpture tradition
of his time ."
With incredible anatomical
accuracy. Rodin used straining
muscles, often ot only partial
figures, to capture vigorous mo
tion. Rodin celebrated the crea
tion of a work of art itself, often
leaving signs ot modeling or
remnants of the casting process
as integral parts ot the piece.
According to Albert Elsen.
art professor at Stanford.
"Rodin made the naked human
torm respond to a host of feel
ings through gesture and move
ment that had no precedent in
the history of sculpture." He de
scribes him as a "psychologist
of the body," an "observer of in
stinctive gesture." and an "in
terpreter of the flesh "
Rodin sculpture may not
always be aesthetically pleas

ing and cannot be simply pas
sively enjoyed. His works pulse
with lite and evoke response.
The figures invite you to walk
around and look from all angles.
Rodin's figures are often
fragmentary — torsos, hands or
busts — emitting as much "life"
as his fully expressed works.

Rodin believed. "True beauty
is like God. and a fragment ol
beauty is beauty complete."
This philosophy is manifest in
all of his partial works.
Rodin believed that "True ex
pression alone has style." The
Stanford exhibit is proof that he
managed to capture and

eternalize this beliet in his
bronze.
The museum is open Tuesday
through Friday from 0 a.m. to 5
p.m. and weekends from 1 to 5
p.m. This summer, part of the
exhibit will be in Washington on
loan, but most of the collection
will still be here.
