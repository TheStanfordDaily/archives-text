# San Francisco: many species in the nightclub genus
## 
### 
Newark has discos. Cleveland
has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriott's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium
capable of accommodating Led
Zeppelin. Seattle has a really
big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless)
acts like Aerosmith in there.
Los Angeles has two stadiums
capable of accommodating
Aerosmith if you count Anaheim
(the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies. albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office me
tropoli go to pains to see that
this is true. Quality of per
formance aside, it just goes to
show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get
what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except night
clubs. that is. San Francisco's
nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac
Killer, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community out
side New York State lines. The
City has more nightclubs than
L.A., for instance, which holds
somewhere near eight times as
many inhabitants, and it offers
more variety than L.A., for ex
ample, which holds eight times
as many human beings. No one
knows why this is true, of
course, except tor the occasion
al smartass who argues that San
Franciscans are a race of su
premely intelligent hippie

freaks — whatever the reason,
it remains a True Fact that
nightclubs here are thriving.
There are, again, many spec
ies in the nightclub genus. We
have, for example, sleazy dives
where you can simulate living in
Detroit, and more than our
share of establishments cater
ing to the Carol Doda crowd.
And if you went to Exeter, no
need to worry, there are ex
clusive places, where obloquy
and scorn await a tool without a
tie.

an Francisco's nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer, distinguish
this city from every inhabited community
outside ISeiv York State lines.'

And between these extremes
— hold your breath — the City
has upwards of a billion zillion
"miscellaneous" nightclubs,
ranging all the way from the
red-velvet-and-Frank Gorshen
posh of the Fairmont Hotel to
the jump-up-and-down, para
lyzed-tor-life, what-kind-of-fun
ny-pills-did-you-say-they-were?
Oh-my-god they're-turning
into-reptiles contentment of
Mabuhay Gardens. San Francis
co, in short, has many, many es
tablishments designed to pro
vide you with entertainment
and/or dancing and/or grounds
for imbibing at night.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to
go. It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
visitor's guide doesn't at least

include a guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw
the noose. . . .
Did I happen to hear someone
out there ask for nightclub ad
vice? You in the back with cal
culator in one hand and
Michelob in the other? Very
good. There arc several such es
tablishments between here and
Marin County that could do with
special mention — if you insist. I
will force myself to reveal the
location of a few.
The Great American Music

Hall, the Old Waldort, the Key
stone Berkeley, the Keystone
Palo Alto. Keystone Korner and
Christo's come instantaneously
to mind, which leaves out a few,
but we'll probably get to them in
just an instant or two.
Excuse me, do I see another
hand'.' You in the warm-up suit?
Yes. I do suppose it's true that a
laundry list won't help much,
owing to considerable diversity
as to what in reality constitutes
a truly mythical experience
beyond anyone's wildest
dreams. I see your point. Some
people value dancing space
more than they value perfect
acoustics, and that does make it
difficult to give worthwhile ad
vice. Almost makes it im
possible. in tact.
But wait. Most people here
have never even been to a night

club, and tor that reason it
would do you good if I listed
what you should look for. There
are immutable principles in any
business. So go grab a pencil, or
grab a friend with a pencil, and
write down all of the following.
IMease'' What follows are the
rules by which one should judge
a nightclub (examples in
cluded).
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame-quotient
stars. High fame-quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with
high boredom-quotient warm
up acts — you must remember
that nightclubs depend on medi
um-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high
fame-quotient" — the point is
that you ought not wait all year
for your favorite group. They'll
sell out anyway, if they play in a
nightclub, so what true clubbers
ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
tough tor a great many people.
It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is im
portant, and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored
dials and switches, most of hu
manity is unable to tell a good
sound system from a dixie cup
on a string. It follows from that
that although sound systems
vary in nightclubs, to most peo
ple it doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The

Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit ol featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a fvorite haunt
for Peter Tosh/Patti
Smith Warren Zevon types — it
is surprising how badly the mu
sic is mixed. ("Mixing" is re
lated to amplification which has
to do with electricity. OK 9 i And
Great America's beautiful gold
leaf interior can sometimes
send a trumpet solo into an ear
in a disconcerting moment But
both places simply don't need
perfect acoustics, because
there are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz
club. (Keystone Korner for ex
ample. That's a jazz place, and
one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect
acoustics — they have it be
cause they need it; but other
places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essen
tial to know what kind of crowd
you like. There's a world of dif
ference between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest ot mankind as we know it,
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or
else it could destroy an evening.
And Mabuhay is a perfect ex
ample. There is music, to be
sure — though neo-fascists pre
