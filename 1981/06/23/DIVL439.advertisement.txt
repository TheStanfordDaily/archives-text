Did yon know
we can find
a breast cancer
as small as the
head of a pin?
Such a tiny cancer can
almost always be cured.
Mammography, a technique
of low-dose breast x-ray, can
detect a cancer long before a
lump can be felt. While it is
still highly curable.
If you are over 50 or
have special reasons to be
concerned with breast
cancer, ask your doctor
about mammography.
