# Christopher talks on talk

### Karen Springen 
Graduation weekend was
highlighted by featured speaker
iormer Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, the
annual Baccalaureate Service,
the senior class luncheon and
diploma award ceremonies.
The University's ninetieth
commencement exercises took
place Sunday, June 14 in Frost
Amphitheater. About 12,500
trustees, faculty, guests and
graduates from the class of 1981
overfilled the outdoor arena as
President Donald Kennedy con
ferred approximately 1700
bachelor's diplomas and 1600
advanced degrees.
After an invocation by Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, dean of Me
morial Church, and the recogni
tion of endowed professorships,
Stanford's renowned alumnus of
the law school, Christopher
gave his address, "On the Vir
tues of Talking." Christopher
spoke primarily of the practice
of direct communication as a
tool of foreign policy. He em
phasized that talking receives
less attention than it deserves
since it "makes things actually
happen."
Christopher cited the release
of the 52 hostages in Iran as an
example of the successful use of
talk to replace the force of
arms. "Indeed, the hostage
crisis was a compelling vindica
tion of talking as a central ele
ment in our foreign relations."
he said. "I have been reinforced
in the conviction that the long,
difficult, and often frustrating
course we followed was the
right course for America,"he
added.
Nuclear war
He emphasized the role of
talk in clarifying the position of
the United States "In a world
that nuclear war could make a
wasteland, no one can afford the
miscalculations isolation might
bring," he said.
"As a matter of sound princi
ple. to facilitate talking. I think
we should aim to establish diplo

matic relations with every
country, based on an objective
judgment whether the people
claiming to be the government
actually have control, unci
whether they are willing to live
up to minimum diplomatic stan
dards."
Christopher also referred to
growing international in
terdependence. "The develop
ing countries are a group to be
reckoned with — and spoken
with Economically, no less
than politically, we need each
other," he said.
Values
He concluded, "One hopes
that all of you have also learned
a set of principles and practices,
values and ideals, that will
serve you the rest of your days.
As you apply them, I am confi
dent that your lives will be pro
ductive . . . that the community
you choose will be strengthened
. . and that the world we share
will be enriched."
Christopher was chosen unan
imously by a committee consist
ing of Kennedy, the four senior
class presidents, and faculty
and student representatives.He
graduated from Stanford Law
School in 1949, where he served
as the first editor-in-chief of the
Imw Review.
He served as a law clerk to
former Supreme Court Justice
William Douglas in 1949, and
went on to become a partner of
the law firm O'Melveny and
Myers in 1958 He was recently
reappointed to the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
Kennedy's greeting
Kennedy welcomed the au
dience in a light-hearted
manner. He reflected, for ex
ample, on his past year as a
"freshman president."
He gave graduates two pieces
of advice, however — not to let
others tell them what to think
about, and to pursue learning
beyond utility. "At the heart of
the matter are values." He par
ticularly emphasized the goal of
"education as opposed to train

ing."
Kennedy warned that th«>
quality of people entering the
fieid of education is declining.

quitable distribution of physi
cians. These femarks were
prefaced, however, by his claim
that the media's labelling of the
generation as careerist and ma
terialistic is superficial. "It was
not the young who structured
these career incentives,'' he
said.

Class Day

luncheon, Saturday, June 13, in

admissions; Assoc. Political
Science Prof. Nan Keohane,
former chair of the Faculty Sen
ate; and Herant Katchadourian,
dean of undergraduate studies.
About 3800 seniors and guests
attended the luncheon.
Hargadon cited the Univer
sity's growing applicant pool.
About 9900 people applied as
freshmen for the graduating
class of 1981 while more than
14,000 applied for this fall's en
tering class.
Keohane. who left to assume
her new post as president of
Wellesley last week, said she
will miss both the strong com
munity of women here and hav
ing male undergraduates in
class. She emphasized the need
for cooperation between men
and women if challenges, such
as combining marriage and ca
reers, are to be met.

And Katchadourian em
phasized the leader's influential
role as a broker rather than the
traditional commander on the
battlefield. "To be truly effec
tive in today's world, you will
often have to forego personal
acclaim," he said.

delivered in the Inner Quad Sat
urday morning, Archbishop
John Quinn of San Francisco
cited three things that last:
faith, hope and love.

Wessells of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences ad
dressed Phi Beta Kappa stu
dents Friday night, June 12. He
concentrated on the danger of
the wedding of rich, extremely
conservative theological groups
with politics. He said, for exam
ple, that groups such as the Mor
al Majority pose more potential
threat than the Communist Par
ty.
