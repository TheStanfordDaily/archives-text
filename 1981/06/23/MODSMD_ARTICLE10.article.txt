# 'The Transition' in transition
## 
### J. Raymond Mills 
The Transition, Tresidder
Union's cafeteria, is undergoing
a $220,000 "complete aesthetic
remodeling" that will provide
the Stanford community with a
pleasant place to eat, study or
gather for discussion when it is
completed sometime before the
beginning of the fall quarter.
But until then patrons will
have to choose from a limited
menu being offered in the eating
facility on a abreviated time
schedule and dine in the swelter
ing heat of an unusually hot
summer sun.
Marcel's baked goods shop
and Servomation, the two food
services that usually do busi
ness within the Transition, are
currently operating on a small
scale from tables inside from
7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. A con-,
tinental breakfast set-up is the
temporary substitute for
Marcel's usual array of fresh
baked cookies and pastries,
while Servomation offers a
small selection of hot breakfast
and lunch items and a salad bar
inside, as well as a hamburger
grill from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00
p.m. on the front patio.
Greg Larson, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder and remodeling
coordinator, said that ev
erything possible is being done
to lessen the inconvenience
caused by the renovation
project, now in its third week.
"We're trying to minimize the
disruption to the Stanford com
munity," he said "We com
pleted most of the work during
the break between spring and
summer quarters so that as few
people as possible would be af
fected. Hopefully the present
limited operations will
eliminate strains on the Coffee
House."
According to manager Steve
Weiss, business at the Coffee
House has not slowed down sig
nificantly since the end of the
regular school year. "We ex
pected a slow-down last week
but we didn't get it. We're sus
taining the same volume of cus
tomers and sales and our lunch
rush is just as busy as before the
summer break," he said.
The Store, a convenience
market located behind the Tran
sition, is also reporting unusual

ly high sales volume for this
time of year, especially during
lunch hours, according to man
ager John Hyde. "We get a lot of
gripes from people who come to
purchase snacks here rather
than enduring the heat and long
lines for hamburgers." On the
other hand, officials at Tres
idder expect the utility offered

by the new cafeteria to be well
worth the present sacrifices.
The remodeling process will
increase the seating capacity by
56 spaces, bringing the tolal to
350. Approximately 70 percent
of the seats in the new cafeteria
plan will be designed for small
group seating in order to ac
commodate the one or two per
son seating demands that were
observed while the renovation
was in the planning stages.
Steps are also being taken to
improve poor lighting that has
been a major problem for the
Transition in the past. Solar va
por lamps are being installed
and incandescent bulbs which
were used in the past are being
replaced by elipsoidal reflector
lamps. Tresidder director Ellie
Oppenheim noted that solar va
por lamps are "extremely
energy efficient" and will offer
much more light at a fraction of
the costs for incandescent light
ing. The lamps will be pointed

upward to create an effect Op
penheim refered to as "ceiling
in light".
The painting of the Transition
is already completed and fea
tures beige, tan, and brown tints
in an "earth tones" decor that
blends well with the new light
ing plans and the quarry tile
walkways and color coordinated

carpets now being installed.
In addition to improvements
in the physical surroundings,
new service procedures that
will include an "alternative
point of service" for quick foods
in the rear of the facility are
planned. This arrangement will
allow for a "service window"
that would allow people to
purchase foods quickly without
having to enter the building.
This new area will be open long
er than the main service area
and will probably have a menu
that includes quiche and crepes.
Funding for the Transition re
modeling project comes from
Tresidder Union reserves, mon
ey set aside to replenish build
ings and equipment. According
to Oppenheim, savings reserves
for the renovation have been
being collected for three or four
years and the remodeling itself
would not lead to future price in
creases.

But until then patrons will
have to choose from a limited
menu being offered in the eating
facility on a abreviated time
schedule and dine in the swelter
ing heat of an unusually hot
summer sun.
Marcel's baked goods shop
and Servomation, the two food
services that usually do busi
ness within the Transition, are
currently operating on a small
scale from tables inside from
7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. A con-,
tinental breakfast set-up is the
temporary substitute for
Marcel's usual array of fresh
baked cookies and pastries,
while Servomation offers a
small selection of hot breakfast
and lunch items and a salad bar
inside, as well as a hamburger
grill from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00
p.m. on the front patio.
Greg Larson, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder and remodeling
coordinator, said that ev
erything possible is being done
to lessen the inconvenience
caused by the renovation
project, now in its third week.
"We're trying to minimize the
disruption to the Stanford com
munity," he said "We com
pleted most of the work during
the break between spring and
summer quarters so that as few
people as possible would be af
fected. Hopefully the present
limited operations will
eliminate strains on the Coffee
House."
According to manager Steve
Weiss, business at the Coffee
House has not slowed down sig
nificantly since the end of the
regular school year. "We ex
pected a slow-down last week
but we didn't get it. We're sus
taining the same volume of cus
tomers and sales and our lunch
rush is just as busy as before the
summer break," he said.
The Store, a convenience
market located behind the Tran
sition, is also reporting unusual

ly high sales volume for this
time of year, especially during
lunch hours, according to man
ager John Hyde. "We get a lot of
gripes from people who come to
purchase snacks here rather
than enduring the heat and long
lines for hamburgers." On the
other hand, officials at Tres
idder expect the utility offered

by the new cafeteria to be well
worth the present sacrifices.
The remodeling process will
increase the seating capacity by
56 spaces, bringing the tolal to
350. Approximately 70 percent
of the seats in the new cafeteria
plan will be designed for small
group seating in order to ac
commodate the one or two per
son seating demands that were
observed while the renovation
was in the planning stages.
Steps are also being taken to
improve poor lighting that has
been a major problem for the
Transition in the past. Solar va
por lamps are being installed
and incandescent bulbs which
were used in the past are being
replaced by elipsoidal reflector
lamps. Tresidder director Ellie
Oppenheim noted that solar va
por lamps are "extremely
energy efficient" and will offer
much more light at a fraction of
the costs for incandescent light
ing. The lamps will be pointed

upward to create an effect Op
penheim refered to as "ceiling
in light".
The painting of the Transition
is already completed and fea
tures beige, tan, and brown tints
in an "earth tones" decor that
blends well with the new light
ing plans and the quarry tile
walkways and color coordinated

carpets now being installed.
In addition to improvements
in the physical surroundings,
new service procedures that
will include an "alternative
point of service" for quick foods
in the rear of the facility are
planned. This arrangement will
allow for a "service window"
that would allow people to
purchase foods quickly without
having to enter the building.
This new area will be open long
er than the main service area
and will probably have a menu
that includes quiche and crepes.
Funding for the Transition re
modeling project comes from
Tresidder Union reserves, mon
ey set aside to replenish build
ings and equipment. According
to Oppenheim, savings reserves
for the renovation have been
being collected for three or four
years and the remodeling itself
would not lead to future price in
creases.
