# Registration packs slim in summer
## 
### Karen Springen 
Before you dissect and throw away your registration
packet today, remember that student volunteers assembled
about 3000 of them on Sunday morning. Each reg pack con
sisted of a Chappie calendar, an information sheet on the
counseling services offered by the Bridge, and an leaflet
about the Daily.
Fall quarter reg packs contain almost 40 inserts. About
10.000 are assembled since the number of students enrolled is
far greater than during summer quarter.
Members of Alpha Phi Omega, the University service club
which oversees preparation of reg packs each year, the
Bridge and the Daily assembled the information bulletins.
About 10 volunteers were involved in stuffing the summer
quarter packs. In contrast, about 150 students participated in
the assembly-line process fall quarter.
Former president of Alpha Phi Omega, Dave Yob, said,
"Summer's always light." Last summer's packs included
only four inserts.
He attributed the overall heavy interest in reg packs last
fall to the fact that it was an election year.
Alpha Phi Omega has been active at the University since
1926. said Yob. He added that ASSU has assumed many of the
previous duties of the club but that reg pack stuffing remains
an Alpha Phi Omega responsibility.
