## Jerry Russell Arms stategy shows US values

When Secretary of State Alexander Haig testi
fied that "there are worse things than nuclear
war," he was fully aware that nuclear war would
mean 140 million Americans dead, most of our
cities and industries vaporized, and much of our
farm\and permanently irradiated. What kind of
thing does Haig think would be worse than nuclear
war? The implicit answer is "communism."
I hesitate to condemn conservatives' fears of
the Soviet Union as simple paranoia. Anyone who
has read Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Gulag
Archipelago knows that the Soviet leadership
sometimes has little regard for human freedom
and human life. If the Soviet politboro could find a
way to lord it over the United States, and if the
cost to them were not too high, they would like to
steal our wealth and freedom.
Along with freedom from Soviet domination,
armament advocates value the appearance of
courage, strength, and power that comes with nu
clear weaponry. Courage and strength are possi
bly the greatest virtue of popular American cul
ture. In classrooms and on football fields, in polit
ical contests and courtroom fights, on the job and
in the bedroom, we learn the lesson: the trophies
and medals, the good jobs and nice houses, the
love of women and the acclaim of men, all belong
rightfully to the strongest and the cleverest. Is it
any wonder, then, that we think we can achieve
success in the international realm by possessing
the biggest bombs 9
Finally, many arms advocates are deeply re
ligious people, convinced that the ultimate goal of
life can be fulfilled only after death. For these
people, "giving in to the Russians" can indeed be
a fate worse than death; it might mean a for
feiture of eternal life.
Haig has been quoted as believing that there is a
real, corporeal devil, presumably colored red,
walking on the earth, and that it is a great duty to
seek out and destroy the devil, with nuclear weap
ons if necessary. President Ronald Reagan is said
to believe in Biblical prophecy. Secretary of the
Interior James Watt has argued that his proposed
rape of America's nature preserves is irrelevant
because we are living in the "end times," and
Jesus will return before the ill effects of his pol : -
cies become apparent.
In a previous column {Daily, March 3) I offered
the opinion that Biblical fundamentalism is re
sponsible for many ills of the body politic. I would
like to reiterate the fact that the Bible is a milita
ristic tract which offers tremendous encourage
ment to hot and cold warriors. In Number 31, God
is portrayed as masterminding a raid by the Is
raelites against the hapless Midianites Every
man. woman, and child in the Midianite city was
exterminated, with the exception of 32,000 young
virgin women who were raped and enslaved. I can
think of no more prototypical examples of the hor
rors of nuclear war. except that modern nuclear
warriors will be denied the dubious opportunity to
rape young womenfolk.
I don't doubt that the advocates of weapons pro
liferation are sincere in their religious devotion.
Furthefmorf, I share their values of strength.

courage and freedom.
However, I wonder how free I can really claim
to be in a nation where I am forced, at gunpoint if
necessary, to pay taxes to support weapons of
mass destruction. I wonder how free anyone will
be in the post-nuclear-war period, when possibly
70 million Americans will be left alive to cope with
a poisoned, radioactive world.
Advocates of arms control and disarmament
make a deadly error when they allow public de
bate on weapons issues to be restricted to ques
tions of nuclear technology and the consequences
of nuclear war. Many of the issues involved are
not scientific and technical, but moral and spiritu
al.
No one wants a nuclear war. Indeed, the very
possibility of nuclear holocaust is widely re
garded with fear and loathing, even by many of
the advocates of new weapons systems like the
MX missile, the B-l bomber, and the cruise mis
sile.
Although we would all like to believe that the
government will be able to keep the missiles safe
ly in their silos, the rhetoric advanced in favor of
the government's policy is far from reassuring.
Such phrases as "Peace through strength."
"Mutually Assured Destrution (MAD)," "Coun
terforce and Countervalue," and "First-strike
capability" have the unmistakable ring of Or
wellian doublespeak. Indeed, many advocates of
arms control and disarmament believe that the
actions of our governments are completely at log
gerheads with the survival of civilization.
Because of the emotional intensity of the issue,
there is a real tendency on the part of disarma
ment advocates to dismiss their opponents as Or
wellian monsters. This is unfair because many
supporters of the government's nuclear weapons
program are sincere, committed and intelligent.
In order to understand and respond to their posi
tion, it is necessary to go beyond their official
rhetoric, and examine their basic moral system,
their values, their hopes and fears. Disarmament
advocates must listen to the so-called
"merchants of death," not only when they make
official pronouncements, but also when they
speak in their churches and everyday lives.
It is not courageous, but cowardly, to rely on nu
clear weapons to keep us free. The main effect of
nuclear weapons is to hold millions of innocent So
viet women and children hostage, threatening
them with incineration. Our real enemy is not the
Soviet people, but a few contemptible tyrants in
the Politboro (and, possibly, a few would-be
tyrants of our own.)
Finally, I seriously question the value of a re
ligion whose holy book contains such clear incite
ments to genocide, and whose followers condone
the ultimate in violence.
Because the genocidal character of nuclear
weapons is incompatable with even the conserva
tives' ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of hap
piness, disarmament should be high on everyone's
list of priorities.
