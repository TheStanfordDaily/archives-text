## Human rights aid: levy fine on murder 
### 
An unsavory but friendly gov
ernment turns to the United
States for rescue. It is an old in
glorious story, and it has usually
turned out badly. One recalls
the effort to shore up the
Somozas of Nicaragua, the Shah
of Iran, and the anti-Communist
rulers of South Vietnam. Aid to
all of these was wasted to the
discredit of the United States,
which shouldered the op
proprium of backing markedly
undemocratic regimes.
Now the same melancholy sit
uation looms in regard to
Guatemala. The government of
Romeo Lucas Garcia is beset by
a guerrilla insurrection. The
Cubans are said to be assisting
and arming the insurgents — it
would be remarkable if they did
not do so as far as they can, not
only because of their general in
terest in promoting anti-capital
ist and anti-U.S. movements but
because they have a special en
mity for the Guatemalan gov
ernment.
If the guerrillas should
triumph it would be a
geopolitical setback for the
United States. Hence it is pro
posed to furnish the rightist gov
ernment the arms denied it by
the Carter administration.
But the government of Lucas
Garcia is one of the meanest in
this hemisphere. Rightist
squads and security forces
murder about 100 people month
ly and occasionally have
massacred dozens of Indians.
Most victims are apparently un
connected to the guerrillas in
the bush; teachers, health work
ers, and labor or cooperative
leaders are especially marked
for death. Any Indian trying to
organize his people is a target.

The Guatemalan authorities
cheered the victory of President
Ronald Reagan perhaps even
more passionately than the Re
publican National Head
quarters, and the Reagan ad
ministration would like to help
them deal with an anti-Ameri
can insurgency. But the dubious
morality of doing so gives
pause.
There is an answer, however.
The administration might open
a credit for the Guatemalans to
procure, say, $40,000,000 of heli
copters, tanks, rockets, and so
forth, with the condition that the
credit would be reduced by
$40,000 for each murder of an un
armed civilian by government
affiliated forces, unless per
petrators were duly punished.
There could be no real objection
to such a condition; the donor is
certainly justified in placing
conditions to reduce the politi
cal cost of the aid and to make it
more effective — the repres
sions probably do more than
anything else to fuel the in
surgency.
If each murder cost the mili
tary $40,000, their number
would probably rapidly de
crease, or if the murderers were
not under the high command, an
effort would be made to bring
them to justice.
American ideals should not
conflict with American security
needs. They do not have to if the
nation uses its resources ration
ally. Combatting Communism
should not mean dancing to the
tune of unscrupulous and short
sighted dictators and oligarchs.
