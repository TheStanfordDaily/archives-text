## A 						year of reality shakes his complacency 
### 
"I'd love to change the world,
But I don't know what to do. So
I'm leaving it up to you. "
How many of us are using
those words as our security
blanket? How many of are look
ing forward to carrying those
words home with us over the
summer? Looking forward to
the comforting warmth of
homes and parents, friends and
lovers?
I know I am.
I began to breathe reality a
little bit this year, and it didn't
smell very good. I wish I could
back to the summer of a year
ago, a summer of hope and
sweet promises . . .
But obviously it won't be the
same. I'm getting to a point
where I can't stay out of the way
of the world anymore.
Wait a moment. Perhaps
that's not true. Perhaps I can go
back and be safe again. Maybe it
can be the same.
Yet, I guess it can. And that
frightens me — the seductive
ness of the easy securities of the
not-so-distant past. As much as I
might like to go back, I can't let
myself.
Last summer was wonderful.
An easy job, good friends, and,
near the end, the enchantment
of blossoming love. And I was
really psyched to go off to Stan
ford. Everything was flushes
and full-houses.
But then, I was only seven
teen.
Now I'm eighteen. Not much
different, but different nonethe
less.

Perhaps I could say that I
have discovered evil in the
world this year. That would cer
tainly account for some
changes.
But it's not really the truth.
Evil has still never fully touched
me, touched my life. I feel it
now only through newspapers,
television . . . But it's coming
closer.
(I wonder if I'm walking
toward it.)
Perhaps I could stay away
from it. Perhaps I could go on
and never say anything more —
shape my opinions to keep me
out of trouble, shape my actions
to keep me away from evil.
But is that living?
This has been a year of hints
at real life. Hints of the feel of
struggling after dreams, hints
of the taste of battle, hints of the
frustrations of stalemate and of

the bitterness of defeat.
From this I would run, run
back to a world that knew only
gentle hopes and gentle fears.
I've got to say NO!
I won't run.
I won't hide.
I'll go forward, not back.
This year for the first time I
risked some opinions, brought
forward some ideas that didn't
quite jibe with what the world
expected of me. And it felt good.
But I am still more afraid
than courageous; still afraid to
put my whole weight behind
anything. Who am I, I ask my
self, to venture assertions about
how things are, and how things
should be?
Surely someone else knows
better than I do why there is
poverty . . .
. . . why there is war . . .
. . . why there is no love . . .

Maybe someone else does
know better. But I've got to have
faith in what I believe. I can't be
afraid to act, to risk being
wrong — or being right.
Funny, though — this column
is a microcosmic example of the
conflict I'm trying to describe.
I've tried not to offend anybody;
I've tried to appeal to ev
erybody's feelings by not at
tacking anyone's ideas.
I don't want to attack any
body.
I don't want to piss anyone
off.
I want to love everybody, and
be loved by everybody.
I don't want to believe in evil,
I want to believe in love.
But I'm trying to believe in
love in a world that cheapens
love, that ties it to bad sex and
bad marriages, plastic gods and
paper nations . . .

I'm trying to believe in life in
a world which cheapens life.
So what am I to do? I guess I
have to find a way to mix the
love of summers with the
storms of the seasonal world.
Find a way to live with love, and
with evil as well.
I am not a child anymore. I
can no longer live a child's life,
playing games in a house built
by someone else. I have to start
creating my own house, my own
world.
It's no piece of cake. Some
times I despair; sometimes I
am just numb. But sometimes I
am alive and excited. I have
breathed reality, and it smells
of sweetness too. I may still
doubt sometimes — doubt my
self, doubt everything — but
now I know which way is up.
. . . I'm on my way.

shape my opinions to keep me
out of trouble, shape my actions
to keep me away from evil.
But is that living?
This has been a year of hints
at real life. Hints of the feel of
struggling after dreams, hints
of the taste of battle, hints of the
frustrations of stalemate and of

the bitterness of defeat.
From this I would run, run
back to a world that knew only
gentle hopes and gentle fears.
I've got to say NO!
I won't run.
I won't hide.
I'll go forward, not back.
This year for the first time I
risked some opinions, brought
forward some ideas that didn't
quite jibe with what the world
expected of me. And it felt good.
But I am still more afraid
than courageous; still afraid to
put my whole weight behind
anything. Who am I, I ask my
self, to venture assertions about
how things are, and how things
should be?
Surely someone else knows
better than I do why there is
poverty . . .
. . . why there is war . . .
. . . why there is no love . . .

Maybe someone else does
know better. But I've got to have
faith in what I believe. I can't be
afraid to act, to risk being
wrong — or being right.
Funny, though — this column
is a microcosmic example of the
conflict I'm trying to describe.
I've tried not to offend anybody;
I've tried to appeal to ev
erybody's feelings by not at
tacking anyone's ideas.
I don't want to attack any
body.
I don't want to piss anyone
off.
I want to love everybody, and
be loved by everybody.
I don't want to believe in evil,
I want to believe in love.
But I'm trying to believe in
love in a world that cheapens
love, that ties it to bad sex and
bad marriages, plastic gods and
paper nations . . .

I'm trying to believe in life in
a world which cheapens life.
So what am I to do? I guess I
have to find a way to mix the
love of summers with the
storms of the seasonal world.
Find a way to live with love, and
with evil as well.
I am not a child anymore. I
can no longer live a child's life,
playing games in a house built
by someone else. I have to start
creating my own house, my own
world.
It's no piece of cake. Some
times I despair; sometimes I
am just numb. But sometimes I
am alive and excited. I have
breathed reality, and it smells
of sweetness too. I may still
doubt sometimes — doubt my
self, doubt everything — but
now I know which way is up.
. . . I'm on my way.

"I'd love to change the world,
But I don't know what to do. So
I'm leaving it up to you. "
How many of us are using
those words as our security
blanket? How many of are look
ing forward to carrying those
words home with us over the
summer? Looking forward to
the comforting warmth of
homes and parents, friends and
lovers?
I know I am.
I began to breathe reality a
little bit this year, and it didn't
smell very good. I wish I could
back to the summer of a year
ago, a summer of hope and
sweet promises . . .
But obviously it won't be the
same. I'm getting to a point
where I can't stay out of the way
of the world anymore.
Wait a moment. Perhaps
that's not true. Perhaps I can go
back and be safe again. Maybe it
can be the same.
Yet, I guess it can. And that
frightens me — the seductive
ness of the easy securities of the
not-so-distant past. As much as I
might like to go back, I can't let
myself.
Last summer was wonderful.
An easy job, good friends, and,
near the end, the enchantment
of blossoming love. And I was
really psyched to go off to Stan
ford. Everything was flushes
and full-houses.
But then, I was only seven
teen.
Now I'm eighteen. Not much
different, but different nonethe
less.

Perhaps I could say that I
have discovered evil in the
world this year. That would cer
tainly account for some
changes.
But it's not really the truth.
Evil has still never fully touched
me, touched my life. I feel it
now only through newspapers,
television . . . But it's coming
closer.
(I wonder if I'm walking
toward it.)
Perhaps I could stay away
from it. Perhaps I could go on
and never say anything more —
shape my opinions to keep me
out of trouble, shape my actions
to keep me away from evil.
