Irish conditions
I have been sent a copy of the
long column about Northern Ire
land by Tom Friedberg (Daily,
May 27). He says on the one
hand, at the beginning of a para
graph, that there is now com
plete religious liberty in the
British Empire (we no longer
claim to have an empire),and on
the other, at the end of the same
paragraph, that anti-Catholi
cism is as British as ham
burgers are American.
Friedberg asserts that only
two of Northern Ireland's six
counties have Protestant ma
jorities, where the reverse is

true. He argues that the Protes
tants in Northern Ireland are
not truly Irish although they
have been there 400 years which
presumably is rather longer
than Friedberg's ancestors
have been in this country.
I will not comment at length
on the article, but there is one
particular statement I would
like to correct. Friedberg
argues that there is not equal
protection under the law for
Catholics and for Protestants in
Northern Ireland and that 90
percent of an unspecified
number of people interned
without charge are Catholic.
Both statements are without
foundation.

The law is applied equally to
"loyalists" and to "re
publicans" and there are "loy
alists" as well as "republicans"
serving sentences for terrorist
offences.
Nobody is interned without
charge in Northern Ireland.
When the violence first erupted
there, the extrajudicial process
of detention was used. However,
this was phased out and nobody
has been detained without trial
in Northern Ireland since 1975.
All those now serving sentences
have been charged and con
victed before an open court.
