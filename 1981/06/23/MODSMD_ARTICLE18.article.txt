## Pulitzer hoax exaggeration not aberration 
### 
Fortunately, the fallout from
Janet Cooke's faked Pulitzer
Prize story has finally settled.
What bothered me was not her
hoax so much as the pompous
outrage emanating from all
levels of the national press.
For weeks I have had to listen
to newspeople from news
papers, magazines and tele
vision explain what damage the
"Jimmy" story caused the "in
tegrity" of the press — its only

mainstay. Some even cry that
the incident has thrown the
press back decades. Please,
does anyone believe all that?
Ask any businessman, sports
figure, or politician (off the rec
ord) to judge the veracity of the
press. Anyone who is often in
volved in news stories can re
late embellishments, distor
tions, mistakes, and outright
lies. Small issues become front
page news; major, if dull,
stories become lost in the fine

print. The Janet Cooke affair
was not an aberration, but
merely an exaggeration.
I am not trying to say that ev
erything one reads today is
false, but it is certainly not all
true — especially when truth, as
often happens, depends so much
upon context and interpreta
tion.
The irony of the story is pre
cisely that these hoaxes do keep
people from believing ev
erything they read. And what
has been most frustrating, in
deed a little frightening, during
the aftermath of the "Jimmy"
story is that I have been told
dozens of times that I should be
lieve everything I read. Such
trust, I am told, is the goal of the
press. This, they claim, is what
enables the press to be the pro
tectors of my liberties in a free
society.
Let's be serious. Veracity has
become the primary goal of
journalism only during this cen
tury. Many tum-of-the-century
newspapers, for example, were
epitomes of "yellow journal
ism." Truth was secondary to
circulation. Is this to say that
Americans' freedom went un
protected for over 100 years? Of
course not.
Paradoxically, the press is a

major defense of freedom pre
cisely because they can print
whatever they care. Liberty is
preserved not because the pa
pers are always right, but be
cause they can dissent.
What people need to under
stand is not that the press knows
the truth, but that it is free. In a
world of uncertainties, anyone
would prefer occasional fabri
cations to a central authority
which is always, and officially
"correct."
Thomas Jefferson, who possi
bly more than any other Ameri
can president felt the abuses of
a free press, nonetheless re
mained its staunch supporter
for precisely this reason. "The
firmness with which the people
have withstood the late abuses
of the press . . . show that they
may safely be trusted to hear
everything true and false, and to
form a correct judgement be
tween them." Competition, not
integrity, is the mainstay of a
free press.
Janet Cooke inadvertently
helped point this out, although
one might not realize it, for all
the self-righteous banterings.
