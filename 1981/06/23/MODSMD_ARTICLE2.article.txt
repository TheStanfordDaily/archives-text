# CIR: suspend proxies
## 
### Carl Johnston 
The University should not
participate in shareholder
proxy votes at all next year, the
Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility recommended June
11. The commission called in
stead for a detailed study of
Stanford's ethical responsi
bilities as an investor.
According to Assoc. Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who co
chairs the advisory com
mission, proxy vote decisions
have consumed a tremendous
amount of the commission's
time but have produced rela
tively few concrete results.
Hiller stressed that the decision
to withdraw from proxy voting
would not be "a step back" for
the University. The reason that
the CIR called for a
moratorium, he said, was to
give the commission time to
seek more effective ways of
dealing with proxy issues and in
vestment responsibility.
"The feeling of frustration
was enormous," said Heller,
noting that proxy resolutions
are at times so loosely worded
or unrealistic that the com
mission could not support the

resolution even if it agreed with
the issues in principle.
Even "succesful" proxy reso
lutions receive only between 3
and 6 percent of the
shareholders' votes, said
Heller. The effect of such a
weakly supported resolution on
management decisions is often
"like water off a duck's back,"
according to Heller.
Voting on shareholder proxies
has been a way for the Univer
sity to voice opposition to what
it sees as oppressive or danger
ous policies of corporations.
This May the commission en
dorsed two proxy resolutions,
involving U.S. Steel and the
Mobil Corporation, that would
decrease American corporate
involvement in South
Africa.The commission also
made recommendations con
cerning four other resolutions
involving Chile, South Africa
and nuclear power.
In its report, however, the
commission questioned the ef
fectiveness of proxy votes. In a
majority report, eight of the
commission's 12 members said
that "as a method of influencing
corporate behavior, the proxy
process seems very weak in
deed."
The amount of time the com
mission has to make proxy de
cisions is "wildly unrealistic"
and most resolutions are "shod

oornpi/i that srorps of proxy
within a very brief period each

The commission, an advisory
group of faculty, students, staff,
and alumni, co-chaired by
Heller and Larry Horton, direc
tor of government relations, dis
cussed its recommendations
with the Board of Trustees Sub
committee on Investment Re
sponsibility. No action on the
recommendations is likely until
fall.
During the moratorium, Stan

ford would not vote its proxy on
any shareholder resolutions —
neither for, nor against, nor abs
tain.
According to Heller, if the
recommendation is passed, the
CIR will investigate the ques
tion "what does it mean to be an
ethical investor 0 " Once the
committee has established what
is and what is not ethically prop
er for University investments,
the commission can act accord
ingly. according to Heller.
Other suggestions in the re
port include:
• The commission should con
tinue to vote but only on selected
issues, delegating responsi
bility to study sections that spe
cialize on given subjects, i.e.
South Africa, South America or
Stanford landholdings in Santa
Clara County.
• Write to the managements of
Stanford-held corporations and
present them with a "laundry
list" of ethical concerns.
• Also write to the activist
shareholders who write proxy
resolutions in order to acquaint
them with the resources avail
able at Stanford to help them
write more effective resolu
tions.
• Broaden the scope of the com
mission's concern beyond equi
ty investments, where Univer
sity ownership is a small frac
tion of the total, to include real
estate and veniurv capUaA, Vn
which the VJnWerslty may have

Three additional members of
this year's advisory com
mission agreed with the basic
concerns expressed in the ma
jority report, but suggested ex
ceptions to a complete
moratorium might be made.
"It is more principled and
more prudent to have the com
mission retain the ability to deal
selectively with proxy resolu
tions during the time broader is-
sues and alternative mecha
nisms are being considered,"
they noted.
"It would be an error — in
principle, in tactics, and in ap
pearance to terminate or sus
pend the voting of proxies,"
they argued.
The remaining member said
"proxy voting. . .is not a useful
or efficient way of exercising
Stanford's role as an ethical in
vestor," but doubted a "theo
retical study will offer the Uni
versity practical conclusions."

Three additional members of
this year's advisory com
mission agreed with the basic
concerns expressed in the ma
jority report, but suggested ex
ceptions to a complete
moratorium might be made.
"It is more principled and
more prudent to have the com
mission retain the ability to deal
selectively with proxy resolu
tions during the time broader is-
sues and alternative mecha
nisms are being considered,"
they noted.
"It would be an error — in
principle, in tactics, and in ap
pearance to terminate or sus
pend the voting of proxies,"
they argued.
The remaining member said
"proxy voting. . .is not a useful
or efficient way of exercising
Stanford's role as an ethical in
vestor," but doubted a "theo
retical study will offer the Uni
versity practical conclusions."
The University should not
participate in shareholder
proxy votes at all next year, the
Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility recommended June
11. The commission called in
stead for a detailed study of
Stanford's ethical responsi
bilities as an investor.
According to Assoc. Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who co
chairs the advisory com
mission, proxy vote decisions
have consumed a tremendous
amount of the commission's
time but have produced rela
tively few concrete results.
Hiller stressed that the decision
to withdraw from proxy voting
would not be "a step back" for
the University. The reason that
the CIR called for a
moratorium, he said, was to
give the commission time to
seek more effective ways of
dealing with proxy issues and in
vestment responsibility.
"The feeling of frustration
was enormous," said Heller,
noting that proxy resolutions
are at times so loosely worded
or unrealistic that the com
mission could not support the

resolution even if it agreed with
the issues in principle.
Even "succesful" proxy reso
lutions receive only between 3
and 6 percent of the
shareholders' votes, said
Heller. The effect of such a
weakly supported resolution on
management decisions is often
"like water off a duck's back,"
according to Heller.
Voting on shareholder proxies
has been a way for the Univer
sity to voice opposition to what
it sees as oppressive or danger
ous policies of corporations.
This May the commission en
dorsed two proxy resolutions,
involving U.S. Steel and the
Mobil Corporation, that would
decrease American corporate
involvement in South
Africa.The commission also
made recommendations con
cerning four other resolutions
involving Chile, South Africa
and nuclear power.
In its report, however, the
commission questioned the ef
fectiveness of proxy votes. In a
majority report, eight of the
commission's 12 members said
that "as a method of influencing
corporate behavior, the proxy
process seems very weak in
deed."
