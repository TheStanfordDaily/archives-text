# Students develop a bright idea

Andrew Carnegie and How
ard Hughes took risks in start
ing their own businesses — and
their innovative daring paid off.
Two Stanford student en
trepreneurs are hoping their ef
forts will be successful as well.
Brett Kingstone and George
Hara are marketing a patented
fiber process to replace large
neon light displays. Two signs
are already up in Tokyo and the
new device should be marketed
on the West Coast next year,
said Kingstone.
Kingstone, who graduated
this year with a B. A. in econom
ics and political science, han
dles sales and marketing for the
fiber optics device. Hara, who
switched from the MBA pro
gram in the Graduate School of
Business to become a master's
candidate in electrical engi
neering, researched and de

veloped the system. He pat
ented the device last summer
after inventing the fiber optics
lighting system in Japan with
his brother, Kent Hara.
Kingstone and Hara, with in
put from Stanford business and
engineering professors, are
creating an essentially multi
national corporation, Gekee
Fiber Optics, to promote and
implement use of the device.
Gekee Corporation will receive
products through Gekee Hold
ing Ltd., an exempted company
based in the Bahamas, an inde
pendent state, for tax purposes.
According to Kingstone, the
device has potential for use in
wide thin-wall TV or video
screens, computer output de
vices, telecommunications out
put devices, large size
scoreboards for stadiums, auto
mation control panels, and traf
fic indicators. But their initial
target is the sign market since
the manufacturing for this type
of lighting is working already,
he said.
The three major components
of the system include optical
fiber means and dot matrices,
light sources and mechanical or
semiconductor control units

which can be combined with a
microcomputer to control the
length of waves, patterns, color
tones and fine tuning.
"Fiberoptics are very thin
strands which you can bend and
move," said Kingstone.
"We believe it's going to be
the wave of the future for light
ing," said Kingstone. "It's real
ly on a boom phase." He com
pared the innovation to the ad
vent of the computer age.
He said fiberoptics are
cheaper and easier to use than
other systems and that the de
vice has "thousands of applica
tions."
Hara and Kingstone met
working on a project in an in
dustrial engineering class win
ter quarter. Kingstone said the
venture gives him an excellent
opportunity to explore the high
tech field.
He is now awaiting the late-
July publication of his book, The
Student Entrepreneur's Guide,
which was reviewed by the New
York Times Book Review in
March.
The partners will travel to
Japan in late September to over
see the quality of fiberoptics
production.
