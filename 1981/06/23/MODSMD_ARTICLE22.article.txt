# Layoffs cut quarter of research library staff

The Research Libraries Group (RLG)
Board of Governors last December
created a special committee to restruc
ture the organization's financial base
and assess its program goals. Since then,
the committee has met three times and
according to the group's house publica
tion, RLG News, Issue 3/4, the commit
tee secured "unprecedented capital con
tributions from RLG's member institu
tions." An additional $5.5 million in
grants and loans from foundations
across the country "complete the fund
ing requirements set forth in RLG's
prospectus of January 1979," according
to the report.
Four months later the University an
nounced the intended layoff of 25 to 33
percent of RLG's staff: library coordi
nators. computer programmers, sys
tems analysts, support staff, technical
writers, and marketing personnel. The
reason given — "financial considera
tions."
The magnitude of the impending per
sonnel cutbacks (it is the largest single
layoff since 1976, when closure of the
Stanford Press put 50 people out of work)
and the complexities of the organiza
tion's financial operations, not surpris

ingly, have raised concerns among some
who would have done well to look into the
structure of RLG and its growth in the
past five years.
RLG is a cooperative of 25 research in
stitutions (with its headquarters here)
which works to improve the man
agement and availability of library re
sources among major research institu
tions. Five years ago the group set about
implementing major changes in both the
software for the computer based biblio
graphic systems, and the program under
which the systems were developed. The
Research Libraries Information
Network includes both the bibliographic
system and the program, and is a major
component of RLG's operation.
In order to accommodate the needs of
the growing consortium (membership
has nearly doubled since 1979), and ex
tend the efficiency of increasingly so
phisticated computer technology to
RLG's informational system, a com
prehensive financial and programming
plan was established to enable RLG to in
crease the capacity of the RLIN system.
According to David Weber, director of li
braries. and University representative
to RLG's Board of Governors, "a busi
ness plan" was designed which would

build the staff over the next three years,
and redesign the software and increase
its capacity. RLG's staff grew from
fewer than 40 employees to almost 100.
"The RLIN software as it existed
three, four, and five years ago was good
in some respects, but it had not been built
for long term efficiency and sharing of
files among a score of research librar
ies." Weber said.

News Analysis

"What had to be done was to build a
staff to a greater capacity. If we look
back three years ago, what RLG was
faced with was a five year effort, the
first three years of which were to be
taken up with the design of software
components. This has already been
achieved."
Weber said that he doesn't believe the
cutbacks in personnel at RLG have been
properly understood in the context of this
long-term plan. "I do not believe that the
newspaper (account of the impending
personnel cuts) put RLG in the right
light. It seems to have ignored this sever
al-year development plan,
"Anyone who works with the develop
ment of sophisticated on-line component

systems will know that you cannot
project everything with perfect finality.
It is a demanding intellectual task —
writing analytic documents, that is
amalgamations of the requirements of
all RLG members, systems program
mers which are experts at developing
rules by which data is manipulated
within the machine — and then an equal
ly complex task — writers for applica
tions programs which translate per
formance specifications done by ana
lysts into operations processes the sys
tem can understand.
"You can have a map as to where you
are going, but you cannot know with pre
cision how many months it will take."
"RLG will keep its operating staff
from now on," Weber said. "But ev
eryone knew that its extra staff would
not continue."
Laying off the additional staff does not
mean there won't be further develop
ment, Weber said. The current budget is
broken down into three parts, and in
cludes a substantial portion for develop
ment of new systems. "The third compo
nent of the budget which will balloon up
wards will depend on those extra sys
tems which the members wish de
veloped." he said.
