# New ASSU senate starts off with summer meetings
## 
### Karen Springen 
For the first time, the ASSU
senate will conduct regular
meetings throughout the sum
mer. The newly formed Com
mittee of the Senate, consisting
of five regular senators and
about 14 senate-designees, will
meet tentatively every other
week.
According to Mark Epstein,
chairman of the finance com
mittee. the system will enable
the senate to effectively use the
reform which moved elections
to spring quarter. The reform,
initiated in the spring of 1980,
was designed to enable summer
work on the ASSU. "It's going to
give us a big jump on next
year." said Epstein.
Senator Jon Blum, a
sophomore, said the reform was
r 'so new" last year that the old
ASSU was unable to make use of
the opportunity to work during
the summer. He stressed the
benefits of the present system.
"We'll be able to start right
right in," he said. "We won't
waste time."
He added that senators will
keep in contact with their de
signees so the transition in the
fall will run smoothly. Senators
also plan to communicate with
college students from their
home towns. This will enable
them to get fresh input on the

operation procedures of other
university student govern
ments.
Senators who were unable to
remain on campus this summer
appointed senate-designees.
The senate has established an
office on publicity. "We're plan
ning a very extensive advertis
ing campaign for the fall," said
Epstein. "We're working
toward changing our image."
He emphasized that the sen
ate is not an "in-bred" organiza
tion. Rather, it is striving
toward involvement from a di
verse group of students. "It's
good to have new blood in our or
ganization." he said.
"What we're really trying to
do is reach out to students," said
Epstein. With increased student
input, the senate will be taken
more seriously than before, he
said.
And according to senator Jon
Blum, a sophomore, the ASSU is
trying to get permission to have
a representative speak along
with Herant Katchadourian,
dean of undergraduate studies,
and President Donald Kennedy
during freshman orientation.
Blum emphasized, "We ran in
hopes that we'd get something
done. All the senators this year
are dedicated to accomplishing
something."

Projects include a proposed
change in the fee assessment
structure. Epstein criticized the
current procedure in which
groups must ask for $12,000
when they apply for a fee
assessment. "We also would
like organizations that just need
$2000. $3000 and $4000." he said.
Ideas include making fee
assessments non-refundable
and assessing one amount on the
PTR.
An election on about four fee
assessments will be held four
weeks into fall quarter, said
Blum.
He added that a faculty
statistician will help organize
the election which should al
leviate past problems with the
process.
Faculty Day
Senators are working with the
Office of Residential Education
and Food Service on the possi
bility of putting on a Faculty
Day to encourage faculty and
student interaction. Each dorm
might be given tickets to invite
about seven faculty members to
dinner.
Other senate projects include
looking at the by-laws and con
stitution and planning Harvest.
Harvest is a festival held during
freshman orientation in which
the ASSU and various student

groups present information on
their activities in White Plaza.
Junk sale
Recent efforts included the
"Dump Your Junk" sale in
White Plaza June 10, initiated
by the COP. Students sold or ex
changed unwanted lamps,
chairs, stereos and other items.
Other sponsors included the sen
ior class, Students Against
Waste, and the recycling club
According to COP member
Dragan Popov, the event may
become an end-of-the-year trad
ition. He called the sale a ser
vice since "so much is thrown
out at the end of the year." He
added. "If someone brought
something, it was sold auto
matically."
Junior Barbara Levenson,

who worked on the sale, said the
group hopes the project will con
tinue. She expressed hopes for a
household exchange center dur
ing the year.
COP projects
All four COP members are on
campus this summer. Popov
said that bicycle safety, extend
ing the Marguerite route, and
investigating alternatives to the
present food service system are
a few areas in which the COP
will concentrate its efforts. Dif
ferent task forces are estab
lished to report on each of these
issues.
