# Dorm decorations needn't be dull, dingy, or dreary
## 
### Karen Halbo 
You've just come on campus,
have fought your way through
the frightening spectacle of
arena registration, and have
now arrived at your dorm, or
trailer, your new home for the
summer.
As you blindly wind your way
down the long, non-descript cor
ridors, and bluster around the
trailer court trying to find one
that looks different from the
rest (they wouldn't give you one
just like everyone else's!) you
finally hit the one with the ap
propriate number on it.and re
alize that you are about to enter
the place in which you will at
tempt to survive the sweltering
summer quarter.
It is the epitome of a dorm.
Even the trailers manage to
look non-descript, and the only
interesting thing about the place
are the people who have been as

signed to be your roommates
(more on this later). The place
is dull, and totally without char
acter. This is your dorm room,
or your trailer, and here are
some ways to improve it:
Above all, a room should be
decorated slowly. Go ahead and
slap up some posters to cover
the blank walls, but try to think
about where each poster goes,
and if it fits that spot.
Some more things one can put
on the walls: flags, pictures,
hanging rugs, and Indian
bedspreads. The Indian
bedspreads are especially fun —
they billow something like a
parachute when placed on the
ceiling, and give the room a
very 'cozy' look.
Speaking of ceilings, there
are a myriad of possibilities
when it comes to hanging things
from them. Plants always look
good, while wind chimes,

stuffed animals on springs (for
pulling, and watching bounce up
and down), mobiles, and beads
all work well.
Beads can also be used to give
the bed a look of privacy, along
with sheets — just tack up a
make-shift tent around the bed.
For students with room
mates, there are several types
of dividers one can devise. The
nicest is an oriental stand-up
screen, but for those who can't
afford (or find) these, there are
some other alternatives.
A table or bookcase properly
placed can help divide a room.
For a ceiling to floor divider,
take a sheet (or an Indian
bedspread) and wrap a portion
of it around a strip of molding (a
yardstick will do). Then, with
tacks or small nails, hammer
this to the ceiling. The sheet will
drop down without sagging, and
divide the room.
If the room does not already
have one, a rug is a necessity.
Cheap bathroom rugs are avail
able almost anywhere. Nice
small rugs can be found at Pier 1
Imports in the Town and Coun
try shopping center.
Piles of pillows on a bed or
floor are great for lounging, and
make a room very comfortable
for entertaining, while bean
bags make great easy chairs.
Every dorm room has a win
dow (and the trailers have them
too). Usually there are some
tacky curtains to go along with
it. Depending on the view, and
whether or not it gets direct sun
light, one can cover a window
with a shade, hang a minor
jungle of plants around it,
dangle colored or multi-faceted
glass crystals in front of it to
make patterns in the sunlight.
Glass beads can also be used
for this, but they are rather dif
ficult to hang up so as to not in
terfere with the drapes.
All decorations should blend
in with the general setting —
and although they are not deco
rations, TVs. fishtanks, stereos
and refrigerators are all stan
