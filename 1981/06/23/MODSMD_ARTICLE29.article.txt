# Luxurious local parks provide relaxation

As the temperature climbs,
and you feel the sweat begin to
pour down your face, you may
find yourself wondering, "what
is there to do at Stanford besides
study?"
Aside from swimming (in the
pools and in the fountains), or
running (around the Oval if you
are out of shape, circling the
campus on Campus drive if you
are so-so, up to the Dish if you're
a pro), or hanging out at the
Bookstore (to see how many
items they've managed to put
some sort of Stanford logo on),
there is always a visit to the
Stanford museum, a trip to all
the knicky-knacky shops in Palo
Alto, or a visit to the expensive,
but ultra-modern Stanford
Shopping Center.
All of these activites can en

tertain the inquisitive Stan
fordite, but for those world
weary souls who seek the
solitude of some woodsy local
park, or wish to watch children
swinging peacefully on a play
ground swingset (or perhaps
would like to do some swinging
themselves), here's a guide to a
few of the local parks and play
grounds.
Burgess Park — a large and
beautiful park with a play
ground, swimming pool, tennis
courts, and a baseball field at
one end, a recreation center,
community theater and several
administration buildings in the
middle, and a city hall, a li
brary, a police station and a
scenic stream and lake (which
makes a splendid explor
ing/wading pool) at the other
end. There is a community pool

which costs $.50 to use.
All sorts of summer recreation
programs are available for the
more adventurous: why not
take a pottery or jazzercize
class with a friend?.
The park is located at Alma
and Ravenswood Avenue, in
Menlo Park. To get there from
Stanford, take Palm Drive out
to the El Camino Real, turn left,
and go a little less than a mile to
Ravenswood Ave, and turn
right. One block down on the
right is the park, and the first
street on the right is Alma.
There are plenty of parking lots,
bike racks, and drinking foun
tains. (Also, there are candy
and drink machines in the lobby

of the recreation center).
Rinconada Park - another big
park that doubles as a communi
ty center, with large shaded
lawns, a playground, tennis
courts and a swimming pool. At
the park is the Lucie Stern Com
munity Center, which happens
to be the 'home base' of the Palo
Alto Players (one of the best
live theater groups in the area).
There are also various classes
offered at the community cen
ter, although most are for Palo
Alto residents only.
The park is located at 1305
Middlefield Road, in Palo Alto.
To get there from Stanford, take
Galvez Street out and follow it
across the El Camino until it be

comes Embarcadero. Then fol
low Embarcadero to Mid
dlefield Road, take a left, and
the park is directly on the right.
El Camino Park — a small,
woodsy park, that is actually a
succession of small green lawns
under the large trees along the
San Francisquito Creek. The
park begins at El Camino Real,
across from the Stanford Shop
ping Center, and meanders
along next to the creek, on Palo
Alto Avenue. During the hot
summer months the creek be
comes little more than a trickle,
but the trees and green lawns
make it a great resting and
reading spot for the hiker or
biker who likes to explore.
