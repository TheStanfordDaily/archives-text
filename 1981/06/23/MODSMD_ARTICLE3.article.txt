# Grad stipends boosted by 16%, but is it sufficient?

Graduate student stipends will rise by 16 per
cent next year, bringing the total to $3750 above
tuition. Additional research and teaching assis
tant posts will allow graduate students to earn up
to $600 more annually.
Although this action may cover the effect of this
year's inflation, it does not make up for the
erosion of previous years, according to a report of
the Committee on Graduate Studies presented to
the Faculty Senate June 11.
The Faculty Senate in its final session of 1961-82
was divided cn the C-GS recommendation that
stipends rise at least as fast as inflation in 1962-83.
Vice-Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies
Gerald Lieberman said that it was still early to
reach a "definitive answer" on graduate
stipends.
Although plans for the future remain un
determined, Social Sciences Graduate Students
Association member Eric Berg, also a member of
C-GS, indicated that he was pleased the adminis
tration has at least decided to try and tackle the
problem. He added that "the issue will be around
for a while because there hasn't been any clear
resolution," but that in time an acceptable solu
tion might be found.
The June 11 C-GS report gives reasons for cur
rent problems. In 1967 a Ford Foundation grant of
$4 million allowed the University to implement its
Four-Year Guaranteed Assurance program All

students admitted to a doctoral program in hu
manities or social sciences were guaranteed four
years of support. For financial reasons, the
number of admissions allowed to each depart
ment continues, with three exceptions, to be con
trolled by the graduate dean.
Although the equal support program worked in
its early stages, problems such as over-admission
of students, rising tuition costs and inflation have
created serious problems. After a relatively
steady real rate of income over several years, re
cent high inflation has lowered the purchasing
power of graduate students.
The C-GS report does not propose grants to cov
er all graduate student expenses. It suggests that
the student "must make a certain effort at self
help," but that this should not exceed what is al
ready incorporated in the Humanities Fellows
Plan program. Thus the C-GS "proposes an effort
be made to restore stipends to a level that will al
low graduate students to spend most of their time
pursuing graduate study."
The C-GS has indicated that aid must be main
tained in order to prevent a drastic cut-back in the
population of qualified graduate students This is
especially true in the humanities and social sci
ences Other alternatives such as the accumula
tion of long-term debt might dissuade applicants
in times when trends in academic employment
are discouraging And in order to fulfill President
