# Grad stipends boosted by 16%, but is it sufficient?

Graduate student stipends will rise by 16 per
cent next year, bringing the total to $3750 above
tuition. Additional research and teaching assis
tant posts will allow graduate students to earn up
to $600 more annually.
Although this action may cover the effect of this
year's inflation, it does not make up for the
erosion of previous years, according to a report of
the Committee on Graduate Studies presented to
the Faculty Senate June 11.
The Faculty Senate in its final session of 1961-82
was divided cn the C-GS recommendation that
stipends rise at least as fast as inflation in 1962-83.
Vice-Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies
Gerald Lieberman said that it was still early to
reach a "definitive answer" on graduate
stipends.
Although plans for the future remain un
determined, Social Sciences Graduate Students
Association member Eric Berg, also a member of
C-GS, indicated that he was pleased the adminis
tration has at least decided to try and tackle the
problem. He added that "the issue will be around
for a while because there hasn't been any clear
resolution," but that in time an acceptable solu
tion might be found.
The June 11 C-GS report gives reasons for cur
rent problems. In 1967 a Ford Foundation grant of
$4 million allowed the University to implement its
Four-Year Guaranteed Assurance program All

students admitted to a doctoral program in hu
manities or social sciences were guaranteed four
years of support. For financial reasons, the
number of admissions allowed to each depart
ment continues, with three exceptions, to be con
trolled by the graduate dean.
Although the equal support program worked in
its early stages, problems such as over-admission
of students, rising tuition costs and inflation have
created serious problems. After a relatively
steady real rate of income over several years, re
cent high inflation has lowered the purchasing
power of graduate students.
The C-GS report does not propose grants to cov
er all graduate student expenses. It suggests that
the student "must make a certain effort at self
help," but that this should not exceed what is al
ready incorporated in the Humanities Fellows
Plan program. Thus the C-GS "proposes an effort
be made to restore stipends to a level that will al
low graduate students to spend most of their time
pursuing graduate study."
The C-GS has indicated that aid must be main
tained in order to prevent a drastic cut-back in the
population of qualified graduate students This is
especially true in the humanities and social sci
ences Other alternatives such as the accumula
tion of long-term debt might dissuade applicants
in times when trends in academic employment
are discouraging And in order to fulfill President
Donald Kennedy's intent to give a high priority to
the development of the humanities here, a re
spectable number of graduate students must be
preserved.
The C-GS recommendations were as follows: to
increase the 1982-83 stipends to at least keep pace
with inflation; to put a high priority on fund-rais
ing for graduate fellowships; to develop graduate
student housing as one means for easing the finan
cial burden; to assign high priority to the need for
sustaining and reinforcing graduate support when
reviewing requests for improvement expen
ditures.
The C-GS proposal used ideas from
Lieberman's White Paper on graduate student fi
nancial support and a position paper by the SSGSA
and the Stanford Fellows Association (SFA) on
the same subject.
According to Lieberman's paper, several possi
bilities exist for maintaining a one-tiered fellow
ship system without a "substantial influx of new
general funds into the operating budget." He sug
gests the possibilities of cutting fourth-year sup
port. which would free $200,000 to be redistributed
among the students of the other three years; cut
ting first-year aid which would release $808,000 in
funds for possible use in supporting second-, third
and fourth-year students; reducing the number of
admissions. But a reduction could force the de
partments "below the level at which it is possible
to maintain a first-class operation." Admission to
certain departments could be arranged (as is cur
rently in effect at the University of California at
Santa Cruz) on a biannual basis; a totally need
based program could be instituted. This is already

the policy used in the Business, Law and Medical
schools.
Lieberman concluded in his White Paper that
"in this austere era" the most appropriate action
would be to "provide a stipend for all students
(hopefully competitive with the top schools), but
set them at a level which will permit students to
enroll at Stanford with the aid of other resources
(e.g. spouse's earnings, loans, parental contribu
tions or by availing themselves of opportunities to
do additional teaching or research." Kennedy
agreed in his April 3 statement to the Academic
Council that faced with " rampant inflation " and
"massive federal withdrawal" from graduate
student funding the University cannot sustain full
support for doctoral candidates, and that we
should now come to recognize that reality."
The SSGS and SFA naturally opose this con
clusion. They contend that the University's at
tempts to maintain graduate stipends as a "con
trollable cost" are unjust. According to their posi
tion paper of May 8: "The dual functions of the
University are teaching and research; the only
truly indispensable elements of the University are
students and teachers."
Graduate students play a major role in the oper
ation of the University. They do often invaluable
research, and also teach, grade and assist in un
dergraduate courses. It should, therefore, accord
ing to the position paper, be a priority of the ad
ministration's to maintain its commitment to
graduate financial aid. The alternatives proposed
by Lieberman, according to the SSGSA and SFA,
put excess pressure on graduate students, and
"slow students' progress toward the degree
markedly."
Graduate student stipends will rise by 16 per
cent next year, bringing the total to $3750 above
tuition. Additional research and teaching assis
tant posts will allow graduate students to earn up
to $600 more annually.

sustaining and reinforcing graduate support when
reviewing requests for improvement expen
ditures.
The C-GS proposal used ideas from
Lieberman's White Paper on graduate student fi
nancial support and a position paper by the SSGSA
and the Stanford Fellows Association (SFA) on
the same subject.
According to Lieberman's paper, several possi
bilities exist for maintaining a one-tiered fellow
ship system without a "substantial influx of new
general funds into the operating budget." He sug
gests the possibilities of cutting fourth-year sup
port. which would free $200,000 to be redistributed
among the students of the other three years; cut
ting first-year aid which would release $808,000 in
funds for possible use in supporting second-, third
and fourth-year students; reducing the number of
admissions. But a reduction could force the de
partments "below the level at which it is possible
to maintain a first-class operation." Admission to
certain departments could be arranged (as is cur
rently in effect at the University of California at
Santa Cruz) on a biannual basis; a totally need
based program could be instituted. This is already

the policy used in the Business, Law and Medical
schools.
Lieberman concluded in his White Paper that
"in this austere era" the most appropriate action
would be to "provide a stipend for all students
(hopefully competitive with the top schools), but
set them at a level which will permit students to
enroll at Stanford with the aid of other resources
(e.g. spouse's earnings, loans, parental contribu
tions or by availing themselves of opportunities to
do additional teaching or research." Kennedy
agreed in his April 3 statement to the Academic
Council that faced with " rampant inflation " and
"massive federal withdrawal" from graduate
student funding the University cannot sustain full
support for doctoral candidates, and that we
should now come to recognize that reality."
The SSGS and SFA naturally opose this con
clusion. They contend that the University's at
tempts to maintain graduate stipends as a "con
trollable cost" are unjust. According to their posi
tion paper of May 8: "The dual functions of the
University are teaching and research; the only
truly indispensable elements of the University are
students and teachers."
Graduate students play a major role in the oper
ation of the University. They do often invaluable
research, and also teach, grade and assist in un
dergraduate courses. It should, therefore, accord
ing to the position paper, be a priority of the ad
ministration's to maintain its commitment to
graduate financial aid. The alternatives proposed
by Lieberman, according to the SSGSA and SFA,
put excess pressure on graduate students, and
"slow students' progress toward the degree
markedly."
Graduate student stipends will rise by 16 per
cent next year, bringing the total to $3750 above
tuition. Additional research and teaching assis
tant posts will allow graduate students to earn up
to $600 more annually.
Although this action may cover the effect of this
year's inflation, it does not make up for the
erosion of previous years, according to a report of
the Committee on Graduate Studies presented to
the Faculty Senate June 11.
The Faculty Senate in its final session of 1961-82
was divided cn the C-GS recommendation that
stipends rise at least as fast as inflation in 1962-83.
Vice-Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies
Gerald Lieberman said that it was still early to
reach a "definitive answer" on graduate
stipends.
Although plans for the future remain un
determined, Social Sciences Graduate Students
Association member Eric Berg, also a member of
C-GS, indicated that he was pleased the adminis
tration has at least decided to try and tackle the
problem. He added that "the issue will be around
for a while because there hasn't been any clear
resolution," but that in time an acceptable solu
tion might be found.
The June 11 C-GS report gives reasons for cur
rent problems. In 1967 a Ford Foundation grant of
$4 million allowed the University to implement its
Four-Year Guaranteed Assurance program All

students admitted to a doctoral program in hu
manities or social sciences were guaranteed four
years of support. For financial reasons, the
number of admissions allowed to each depart
ment continues, with three exceptions, to be con
trolled by the graduate dean.
Although the equal support program worked in
its early stages, problems such as over-admission
of students, rising tuition costs and inflation have
created serious problems. After a relatively
steady real rate of income over several years, re
cent high inflation has lowered the purchasing
power of graduate students.
The C-GS report does not propose grants to cov
er all graduate student expenses. It suggests that
the student "must make a certain effort at self
help," but that this should not exceed what is al
ready incorporated in the Humanities Fellows
Plan program. Thus the C-GS "proposes an effort
be made to restore stipends to a level that will al
low graduate students to spend most of their time
pursuing graduate study."
The C-GS has indicated that aid must be main
tained in order to prevent a drastic cut-back in the
population of qualified graduate students This is
especially true in the humanities and social sci
ences Other alternatives such as the accumula
tion of long-term debt might dissuade applicants
in times when trends in academic employment
are discouraging And in order to fulfill President
Donald Kennedy's intent to give a high priority to
the development of the humanities here, a re
spectable number of graduate students must be
preserved.
The C-GS recommendations were as follows: to
increase the 1982-83 stipends to at least keep pace
with inflation; to put a high priority on fund-rais
ing for graduate fellowships; to develop graduate
student housing as one means for easing the finan
cial burden; to assign high priority to the need for
sustaining and reinforcing graduate support when
reviewing requests for improvement expen
ditures.
