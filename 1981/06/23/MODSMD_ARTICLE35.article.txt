# Registration's rush...
## 
### Karen Halbo 
All Stanford students have to suffer
through that archaic ritual the University
calls 'arena registration.' Getting through
registration, is, in and of itself, a feat, but the
students who survive the process in heat
wave weather, and braved the lines on a
scorching Monday when the Maples Pavillion
fans weren't working, should feel especially
proud.
Registration may not be the best way to

spend an afternoon, but most students accept
registration as something one simply must
go through, like adolescence and the
measles. However, as we all know, some
cases (of adolescence, measles, or even reg
istration) can be worse than others, and for
the students who had to trek across campus
to seek out department authorizations and
other bureaucratic necessities, yesterday
must have certainly felt like an acute case of
registrationitis.
