## Pixote: an enfant terrible 
### Jiri Weiss 
"Have you seen my film?"
asked a bearded man in his 30 s
with a strong Portugese accent.
Unfortunately at that time I
hadn't, and so I said a polite
"no" and walked away. I regret
not having been able to con
gratulate Hector Babenco on his
new film Pixote shown during a
week-long San Francisco festi
val of Brazilian cinema that
ended last Tuesday.
The film deals with the lives

of juvenile delinquents in the
slums of Sao Paolo, but they
could just as well be in other
cities in the developing world
where unemployment and popu
lation growth go unchecked. But
a native of any large U.S. city
who is familiar with the ever-

present social problems will
easily identify many parallels.
During a brief prologue
Babenco explains the scope of
the problem: not only is 50 per
cent of Brazil's population
younger than 21 but three mil
lion children are homeless. Peo
ple younger than 18 are prac
tically immune from criminal
prosecution in Brazil, so chil
dren are easy targets for ex
ploitation by adult criminals.

The worst punishment juve
nile delinquents can receive is a
few months in an overcrowded
reform school no better then the
slums they left. Gang rapes,
beatings and thefts as well as
brutality by the officials are
common in Brazilian reform

schools. There, in spite of the ef
forts of well-meaning middle
class volunteers, the only thing
children learn is to become bet
ter criminals.
The film's story begins at one
of these "reform schools" and
follows the story of Pixote, an
abandoned 10-year-old boy with
a rather sad expression that
could be mistaken for in
nocence. But he is far from that.
After a murder investigation
into the death of a rich man who
had been pushed under the
wheels of a car leads to police
brutality and death of one of
Pixote's friends the atmosphere
of the school grows extremely
tense. The school and the police
attempt a cover up but their
young inmates revolt and set the
place on fire, and later most
successfully escape.
Pixote and his group of three
friends survive on the streets
through theft — they steal
purses, briefcases, grocery
bags and through the connec
tions of Lilica, "a queen" who
has a black lover, get into big
time drug trafficking.
They travel by freight train to
Rio de Janeiro and learn the
business the hard way. Most of
their cocaine is stolen from
them. They use the remainder

to buy a prostitute who has just
aborted her fetus with a long
knitting needle.
Together they lure customers
into an abandoned apartment
and rob them. There is no com
passion or respect for human
life in any of them. Life for them
is very cheap. They steal a
man's car, lock him in the trunk
and abandon him when they
have had their fun.
Pixote. without flinching,
knifes a woman who double
crosses them. Even his acciden
tal shooting of his best friend
leaves Pixote cold. Pixote is
only 10 years old but he has al
jadv killed threp oeople.
And yet these kids have a
strange sort of affection for
each other, at moments — when
they are off guard — they be
have just like kids.

For someone who has not
lived that kind of a life it is dif
ficult to understand and even
more difficult to believe that
there are 10-year-olds who be
have like Pixote and friends. So
it is to Babenco's credit that he
does not get sentimental or mor
alistic.
Another thing which makes
the film believable is Babenco's
casting. He found the actors for
the film right on the streets and
let them play themselves, which
they do with perfect self-as
surance. Pixote played by
Fernando Ramos da Silva is
simply superb.
It is not possible to walk away
from Babenco's film unaf
fected. He offers no answers,
just presents the young delin
quent's view of reality which is,
for most of us, as distant as the
reality of Calahari Bushmen.
