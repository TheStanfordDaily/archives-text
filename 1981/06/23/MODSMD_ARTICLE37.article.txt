# Praise of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' misplaced
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
At the beginning of Raiders of
the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford —
looking much like Bogart in
Treasure of the Sierra Madre, in
a rumpled fedora and grizzled
beard and moustache — tramps
through a Peruvian jungle and a
booby-trapped cave in search of
a priceless religious icon.
Tarantulas cling to his jacket, a
skull flies at him. he races from
a gargantuan boulder and slides
under a descending wall in the
nick of time — and the audience,
wrung from one climax to an
other, cheers loudly when he es
capes.
The sequence is undeniably
exciting, and yet one may quar
rel with it: the filmmakers
neither explain the origin of the
dangers (where did those taran
tulas come from? who released
the skull? is the boulder a natu
ral phenomenon or an ad
versary's trick?) nor allow any
of them to develop — Ford sim
ply skips from one to the next.
It's as if we'd walked into a
movie at the climax — at sever
al climaxes, all edited together.
We don't know who this charac
ter is, so we only root for him be
cause he looks like a hero — and
because he's played by Harrison

Ford whose performances in
Star Wars and The Empire
Strikes Back assure him the im
mediate recognition from au
diences.
Raiders of the Lost Ark is a
tribute to the adventure serials
of the thirties and forties (it's
set in 1936) as well as the TV se
rials and comics of the fifties.
The story idea — a quest by
competing Americans and Na
zis for the ark that reputedly
contains the Ten Command
ments — was thought up by
George Lucas, who directed
American Graffiti and Star
Wars and produced The Empire
Strikes Back, and Philip Kauf
man, director of the 1978 re

make of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers. Lawrence Kasdan,
who wrote Empire, worked the
story into a screenplay. Lucas
produced it, and Steven
Spielberg, maker of The Sug
arland Express, Jaws, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind
and 1941, directed it.
A collaboration of Holly
wood's wunderkind — and it has
been acclaimed by the over
whelming majority of critics as
a cliffhanger classic, the
greatest of all Saturday matinee
pictures — thought the two-hour
lines in the wilting June heat at
test to the fact that Raiders does
not require good press to make a
fortune at the box office But I

must confess to a traitorous re
sistance to all those good vibra
tions : I didn't care for the movie
very much.
I can understand the desire to
pay homage to the kind of enter
tainment from which one de
rived so much pleasure as a
child, but that's not enough of a
reason to make a movie; one
has to use that inspiration as a
jumping-off point.
When Philip Kaufman re
made Don Siegel's scary 1956
Body Snatchers, he wasn't con
tent to duplicate it; he updated
the plot and altered the setting
from a sleepy western town to
San Francisco, and this shifting
of gears enabled him to simulta
neously uncover new satiric

targets and locate the causes of
fear of late-seventies movie
watchers.
No such building on old mate
rial goes on in Raiders.
Spielberg and Kasdan don't
parody the logic of old movie ad
ventures; they try to recapture
it. The character Ford plays,
archaeologist Indiana Jones,
slides into hopeless peril after
hopeless peril, but he always
emerges unscathed a moment
or two later. Tumbling into a pit
crammed with poisonous
snakes, he simply scatters them
with a torch; there isn't much
suspense, because he solves the
difficulty before we can begin to
feel the heat. And this blank in-
vulnerability is extended to
Indy's paramour, Marion
(Karen Allen), who at one point
seems to perish in an explosion
and then turns up unharmed fif
teen minutes after, when only
the most unimaginative (and
unlikely) explanation is offered
for her escape.
If Spielberg and Kasdan ap
peared to be having fun with this
goofball impiausability, one
could accept it, but they em
brace it, out of affection. It's
retrogressive moviemaking.
It is not sufficient, I think, to
want to make the fastest, most
hair-raising version of a kind of
movie that belongs to another
era — but even on a structural
level there is much to dispute in
Raiders. It moves as quickly as
it does because Spielberg and
Kasdan don't waste time on
character — attractive, in
gratiating Karen Allen is only
given one note to play her per
formance on (perky) and rough
hewn, pissed-off Indy Jones
owes more to Harrison Ford's
talents than to any depth in the
script — and don't bother to de
velop their ideas.
Raiders is all climaxes, and
so even when they're clever —
when Jones flees from that
monster rock, or climbs back in
side a truck that he's been
thrown from — we don't ex
perience the same thrill that
Empire gave us. Raiders
achieves a weird balance: it's
exciting on the surface but dull
at its center.
Spielberg brought Raiders in
nearly two weeks ahead of
schedule on a relatively low
budget of twenty million
dollars. In the wake of box office
disasters like Heaven's Gate
and Spielberg's own 1941, that
may seem like the prime virture
for a director. But the problem
with Heaven's Gate wasn't the
money as much as the con
fusion. Cimino, a gifted director
with a fine eye, lost sight of
what he's started out trying to
do, and there was no one around
to keep him on track. (Ap
ocalypse Now suffered from
comparable chaos, but its finan
cial success keeps Hollywood

mouths shut.) 1941 was killed by
the worst word-of-mouth since
Cleopatra; audiences didn't
hate it — they didn't go to see it.
I felt dismayed when, after
seeing Raiders, I read this quote
of Spielberg's in Newsweek's
cover story by David Ansen: "I
needed this picture to exorcise
myself from a kind of technolog
ical rut I was falling into —
where I wouldn't walk away
from a shot until it was 100 per
cent of what I intended ... To
be able to walk away and say, 'I
think that was good enough for
what we're trying to do here,'
was the most important film
school lesson a professional pro
duction has ever taught me."
In an interview with Michael
Sragow in Rolling Stones, he
says, "... I realized that what
could be a turn-on for me could
wreck a gravy-train movie. Why
impose production values — vis
ual noise? I just worked to tell
the story."
I'm sure that the reception af
forded 1941 was a dreadful blow
to Spielberg, but doesn't he re
alize that his cut-rate approach
to Raiders violates the unspoken
code that was clearly in opera
tion in Jaws and Close Encoun
ters, which were the work of a
loving, unstinting director?
At the end of Raiders, when
the ark is opened and the as
sembled look on God, the pay
off is a cheat, partly because the
mysticism has been undercut all
along by the skeptical tone of
the adventure scenes and partly
because what results is
gruesome and sour.
In Close Encounters, a re
ligious fantasy in which an ele
ment of mystical wonder was
built into the film from the be
ginning, the revelation was as
emotionally satisfying as any in
movies. For all the hype about
the adolescent boys' tale spirit
of Raiders of the Lost Ark, I
could discern none of it —
though Steven Spielberg is the
filmmaker who has most close
ly approached a child's per
ception of magic in his other pic
tures. Raiders was made in ac
quisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

I'm sure that the reception af
forded 1941 was a dreadful blow
to Spielberg, but doesn't he re
alize that his cut-rate approach
to Raiders violates the unspoken
code that was clearly in opera
tion in Jaws and Close Encoun
ters, which were the work of a
loving, unstinting director?
At the end of Raiders, when
the ark is opened and the as
sembled look on God, the pay
off is a cheat, partly because the
mysticism has been undercut all
along by the skeptical tone of
the adventure scenes and partly
because what results is
gruesome and sour.
In Close Encounters, a re
ligious fantasy in which an ele
ment of mystical wonder was
built into the film from the be
ginning, the revelation was as
emotionally satisfying as any in
movies. For all the hype about
the adolescent boys' tale spirit
of Raiders of the Lost Ark, I
could discern none of it —
though Steven Spielberg is the
filmmaker who has most close
ly approached a child's per
ception of magic in his other pic
tures. Raiders was made in ac
quisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.
At the beginning of Raiders of
the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford —
looking much like Bogart in
Treasure of the Sierra Madre, in
a rumpled fedora and grizzled
beard and moustache — tramps
through a Peruvian jungle and a
booby-trapped cave in search of
a priceless religious icon.
Tarantulas cling to his jacket, a
skull flies at him. he races from
a gargantuan boulder and slides
under a descending wall in the
nick of time — and the audience,
wrung from one climax to an
other, cheers loudly when he es
capes.
The sequence is undeniably
exciting, and yet one may quar
rel with it: the filmmakers
neither explain the origin of the
dangers (where did those taran
tulas come from? who released
the skull? is the boulder a natu
ral phenomenon or an ad
versary's trick?) nor allow any
of them to develop — Ford sim
ply skips from one to the next.
It's as if we'd walked into a
movie at the climax — at sever
al climaxes, all edited together.
We don't know who this charac

Ford whose performances in

Raiders of the Lost Ark is a
tribute to the adventure serials
of the thirties and forties (it's
set in 1936) as well as the TV se
rials and comics of the fifties.
The story idea — a quest by
competing Americans and Na
zis for the ark that reputedly
contains the Ten Command
ments — was thought up by
George Lucas, who directed
American Graffiti and Star
Wars and produced The Empire
Strikes Back, and Philip Kauf
man, director of the 1978 re

make of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers. Lawrence Kasdan,
who wrote Empire, worked the
story into a screenplay. Lucas
produced it, and Steven
Spielberg, maker of The Sug
arland Express, Jaws, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind
and 1941, directed it.
A collaboration of Holly
wood's wunderkind — and it has
been acclaimed by the over
whelming majority of critics as
a cliffhanger classic, the
greatest of all Saturday matinee
pictures — thought the two-hour
lines in the wilting June heat at
test to the fact that Raiders does
not require good press to make a
fortune at the box office But I

must confess to a traitorous re
sistance to all those good vibra
tions : I didn't care for the movie
very much.
I can understand the desire to
pay homage to the kind of enter
tainment from which one de
rived so much pleasure as a
child, but that's not enough of a
reason to make a movie; one
has to use that inspiration as a
jumping-off point.
When Philip Kaufman re
made Don Siegel's scary 1956
Body Snatchers, he wasn't con
tent to duplicate it; he updated
the plot and altered the setting
from a sleepy western town to
San Francisco, and this shifting
of gears enabled him to simulta
neously uncover new satiric

targets and locate the causes of
fear of late-seventies movie
watchers.
No such building on old mate
rial goes on in Raiders.
Spielberg and Kasdan don't
parody the logic of old movie ad
ventures; they try to recapture
it. The character Ford plays,
archaeologist Indiana Jones,
slides into hopeless peril after
hopeless peril, but he always
emerges unscathed a moment
or two later. Tumbling into a pit
crammed with poisonous
snakes, he simply scatters them
with a torch; there isn't much
suspense, because he solves the
difficulty before we can begin to
feel the heat. And this blank in-
vulnerability is extended to
Indy's paramour, Marion
(Karen Allen), who at one point
seems to perish in an explosion
and then turns up unharmed fif
teen minutes after, when only
the most unimaginative (and
unlikely) explanation is offered
for her escape.
If Spielberg and Kasdan ap
peared to be having fun with this
goofball impiausability, one
could accept it, but they em
brace it, out of affection. It's
retrogressive moviemaking.
It is not sufficient, I think, to
want to make the fastest, most
hair-raising version of a kind of
movie that belongs to another
era — but even on a structural
level there is much to dispute in
Raiders. It moves as quickly as
it does because Spielberg and
Kasdan don't waste time on
character — attractive, in
gratiating Karen Allen is only
given one note to play her per
formance on (perky) and rough
hewn, pissed-off Indy Jones
owes more to Harrison Ford's
talents than to any depth in the
script — and don't bother to de
velop their ideas.
Raiders is all climaxes, and
so even when they're clever —
when Jones flees from that
monster rock, or climbs back in
side a truck that he's been
thrown from — we don't ex
perience the same thrill that
Empire gave us. Raiders
achieves a weird balance: it's
exciting on the surface but dull
at its center.
Spielberg brought Raiders in
nearly two weeks ahead of
schedule on a relatively low
budget of twenty million
dollars. In the wake of box office
disasters like Heaven's Gate
and Spielberg's own 1941, that
may seem like the prime virture
for a director. But the problem
with Heaven's Gate wasn't the
money as much as the con
fusion. Cimino, a gifted director
with a fine eye, lost sight of
what he's started out trying to
do, and there was no one around
to keep him on track. (Ap
ocalypse Now suffered from
comparable chaos, but its finan
cial success keeps Hollywood

mouths shut.) 1941 was killed by
the worst word-of-mouth since
Cleopatra; audiences didn't
hate it — they didn't go to see it.
I felt dismayed when, after
seeing Raiders, I read this quote
of Spielberg's in Newsweek's
cover story by David Ansen: "I
needed this picture to exorcise
myself from a kind of technolog
ical rut I was falling into —
where I wouldn't walk away
from a shot until it was 100 per
cent of what I intended ... To
be able to walk away and say, 'I
think that was good enough for
what we're trying to do here,'
was the most important film
school lesson a professional pro
duction has ever taught me."
In an interview with Michael
Sragow in Rolling Stones, he
says, "... I realized that what
could be a turn-on for me could
wreck a gravy-train movie. Why
impose production values — vis
ual noise? I just worked to tell
the story."

with a fine eye, lost sight of
what he's started out trying to
do, and there was no one around
to keep him on track. (Ap
ocalypse Now suffered from
comparable chaos, but its finan
cial success keeps Hollywood

mouths shut.) 1941 was killed by
the worst word-of-mouth since
Cleopatra; audiences didn't
hate it — they didn't go to see it.
I felt dismayed when, after
seeing Raiders, I read this quote
of Spielberg's in Newsweek's
cover story by David Ansen: "I
needed this picture to exorcise
myself from a kind of technolog
ical rut I was falling into —
where I wouldn't walk away
from a shot until it was 100 per
cent of what I intended ... To
be able to walk away and say, 'I
think that was good enough for
what we're trying to do here,'
was the most important film
school lesson a professional pro
duction has ever taught me."
In an interview with Michael
Sragow in Rolling Stones, he
says, "... I realized that what
could be a turn-on for me could
wreck a gravy-train movie. Why
impose production values — vis
ual noise? I just worked to tell
the story."
I'm sure that the reception af
forded 1941 was a dreadful blow
to Spielberg, but doesn't he re
alize that his cut-rate approach
to Raiders violates the unspoken
code that was clearly in opera
tion in Jaws and Close Encoun
ters, which were the work of a
loving, unstinting director?
At the end of Raiders, when
the ark is opened and the as
sembled look on God, the pay
off is a cheat, partly because the
mysticism has been undercut all
along by the skeptical tone of
the adventure scenes and partly
because what results is
gruesome and sour.
In Close Encounters, a re
ligious fantasy in which an ele
ment of mystical wonder was
built into the film from the be
ginning, the revelation was as
emotionally satisfying as any in
movies. For all the hype about
the adolescent boys' tale spirit
of Raiders of the Lost Ark, I
could discern none of it —
though Steven Spielberg is the
filmmaker who has most close
ly approached a child's per
ception of magic in his other pic
tures. Raiders was made in ac
quisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.
