# Praise of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' misplaced
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
At the beginning of Raiders of
the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford —
looking much like Bogart in
Treasure of the Sierra Madre, in
a rumpled fedora and grizzled
beard and moustache — tramps
through a Peruvian jungle and a
booby-trapped cave in search of
a priceless religious icon.
Tarantulas cling to his jacket, a
skull flies at him. he races from
a gargantuan boulder and slides
under a descending wall in the
nick of time — and the audience,
wrung from one climax to an
other, cheers loudly when he es
capes.
The sequence is undeniably
exciting, and yet one may quar
rel with it: the filmmakers
neither explain the origin of the
dangers (where did those taran
tulas come from? who released
the skull? is the boulder a natu
ral phenomenon or an ad
versary's trick?) nor allow any
of them to develop — Ford sim
ply skips from one to the next.
It's as if we'd walked into a
movie at the climax — at sever
al climaxes, all edited together.
We don't know who this charac
ter is, so we only root for him be
cause he looks like a hero — and
because he's played by Harrison

Ford whose performances in
Star Wars and The Empire
Strikes Back assure him the im
mediate recognition from au
diences.
Raiders of the Lost Ark is a
tribute to the adventure serials
of the thirties and forties (it's
set in 1936) as well as the TV se
rials and comics of the fifties.
The story idea — a quest by
competing Americans and Na
zis for the ark that reputedly
contains the Ten Command
ments — was thought up by
George Lucas, who directed
American Graffiti and Star
Wars and produced The Empire
Strikes Back, and Philip Kauf
man, director of the 1978 re

make of Invasion of the Body
Snatchers. Lawrence Kasdan,
who wrote Empire, worked the
story into a screenplay. Lucas
produced it, and Steven
Spielberg, maker of The Sug
arland Express, Jaws, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind
and 1941, directed it.
A collaboration of Holly
wood's wunderkind — and it has
been acclaimed by the over
whelming majority of critics as
a cliffhanger classic, the
greatest of all Saturday matinee
pictures — thought the two-hour
lines in the wilting June heat at
test to the fact that Raiders does
not require good press to make a
fortune at the box office But I

must confess to a traitorous re
sistance to all those good vibra
tions : I didn't care for the movie
very much.
I can understand the desire to
pay homage to the kind of enter
tainment from which one de
rived so much pleasure as a
child, but that's not enough of a
reason to make a movie; one
has to use that inspiration as a
jumping-off point.
When Philip Kaufman re
made Don Siegel's scary 1956
Body Snatchers, he wasn't con
tent to duplicate it; he updated
the plot and altered the setting
from a sleepy western town to
San Francisco, and this shifting
of gears enabled him to simulta
neously uncover new satiric

targets and locate the causes of
fear of late-seventies movie
watchers.
No such building on old mate
rial goes on in Raiders.
Spielberg and Kasdan don't
parody the logic of old movie ad
ventures; they try to recapture
it. The character Ford plays,
archaeologist Indiana Jones,
slides into hopeless peril after
hopeless peril, but he always
emerges unscathed a moment
or two later. Tumbling into a pit
crammed with poisonous
snakes, he simply scatters them
with a torch; there isn't much
suspense, because he solves the
difficulty before we can begin to
feel the heat. And this blank in-
