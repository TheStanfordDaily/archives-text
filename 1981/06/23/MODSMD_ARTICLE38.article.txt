## Edmunds is Cool in 'Twangin'

Sorry, summer campers. No instant judgments
of Dave Edmunds' talents are going to be offered
here. If you want that, I suggest you go home and
read Roiling Stone, and maybe that will teach you
not to complain. It's impossible to consider Dave
Edmunds on the same assembly line level as most
rock musicians. For above all. Dave Edmunds is
one of rock's all-time Cool Guys.
A Cool Guy in rock is an easier thing to describe
than to define. At least in this article, it means a
musician who has a sense of respect and care for
music, and a sense of humor to know what's im
portant and what isn't. Here are some more
clues: Bruce Springsteen is a Cool Guy. Bruce
Springsteen fans, by and very large, are not. The
Clash, despite their flaws, are cool. Tom "it's all
just pop music anyway" Petty will never be re
motely cool, though he wishes he could be
It's difficult to find a Cool Woman due to the
lack of candidates, but Chrissie Hynde comes
close.
Under these guidelines. Dave Edmunds is the
coolest of the Cool. What make Dave Edmunds
cool is an unfailing devotion to the spirit of rock
music. In the psychedelic era of 1967-70. Edmunds
was in a group called Love Sculpture, making a
reputation as one of the second-level guitar heroes
of the age. (If you've heard "Sabre Dance,"
though, you may dispute that "second level" tag).
After leaving that group. Cool Dave scored a
No. 1 U.S. hit single with "I Hear You Knocking"
(remember that?), revealing a shift in his music
from psychedelia to rockabilly, the root music of
everyone influential in early rock and roll. Some
where along the way. Edmunds hooked up with
popmeister Nick Lowe, owner of a few hits
himself and also acertifiably Cool Guy. Out of this
partnership born in the beer halls and pubs of Eng
land came Rockpile, a chameleon-like band
whose only consistent quality was quality itself.
Over the years of Rockpile's existence, span

ning Lowe's Pure Pop For Now People and
Labour of Lust LPs, Edmunds' Get It, Tracks on
Wax plus 4, and Repeat When Necessary albums,
and the group sown Second Pleasure in 1980, the
group proved equally adept at both modern pop
tunes and obscure rock raveups, establishing
themselves as a Cool Band in the process.
However. Rockpile isn't around anymore, hav
ing broken up in the wake of their greatest suc
cesses in quality and sales. Which means that Cool
Dave Edmunds is back on his own with an album
recorded with Rockpile before Seconds of Pleas
ure, entitled Twangin'. . . And once again, the
most striking characteristic of the record is that
is reflects perfectly the style and talent of Ed
munds and of the late lamented Rockpile.
What this means, to the reader unschooled in
modern musicology, is that Twangin'. . . has
nothing approaching what could be called a "bad
song." There are a couple of Lowe-ish pop tunes
that you may not expect, to be sure — "Something
Happens" sounds too much to me like Labour of
Lust's "Big Kick, Plain Scrap" to be coincidence
with Nick Lowe hanging around, and Mickey
Jupp's "You'll Never Get Me Up (In One of
Those) doesn't seem to fit anywhere for any rea
son (yes, it is about airplanes). But they're still
catchy tunes, helped immensely by Edmunds'
readily stirring voice. Besides, the pop songs are
easily overshadowed by the couple of Everly
Brothers/Buddy Holly throwbacks ("It's Been So
Long." "I'm Gonna Start Living Again If It Kills
Me") and the outstanding rockabilly raveups that
make up the bulk of Twangin'. . . The single
"Almost Saturday Night," though not the best
song on the LP, is the most quintessentially Ed
munds — a definite rockabilly rhythm behind a
truly singing guitar or two, topped by a layered
vocal punctuated by an infectious shout of the
chorus. This is rock music at its most innocent and
exciting level, and Rockpile (and Dave Edmunds)
make it look so easy to enjoy that one can't help
but have a good time with the music. That makes
Twang in'. . . a fitting epitaph for Rockpile, a
good album in its own right, and Dave Edmunds a
Cool Guy once Again.
