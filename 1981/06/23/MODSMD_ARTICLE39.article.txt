# 'Yes' to Netherworld
## 
### Dan Shoemaker 
For years now. Great Britain
has been turning out
progressive rock fusion bands
like Pink Floyd, Genesis, UK
and King Crimson. It seemed as
though the United States would
never be able to do the same.
Not, that is, until now.
The name of the band is Neth
erworld. and if you have heard
them, you'd swear that they are
British. The truth of the matter
is that they come from the south
Bay Area, which means that you
can occasionally see them live,
performing songs from their re
cently released album In the
Following Half-Light.
This is a remarkable album,
the likes of which one might ex
pect from such past masters of
progressive rock as Pink Floyd

or Genesis. That should be a big
tip-off for those of you who like
the Bee Gees to stay away from
this one. I doubt that Nether
world will ever make it big on
AM radio.
Perhaps the best way to de
scribe this work is to define
what it is not. It is not music to
dance to, nor is it particularly
happy. Although a few of the
songs, like "Isle of Man" and
"A Matter of Time," sound very
pleasant and melodic, even
these have an undercurrent of
vague discontent.
Most of the music is dark,
brooding and disturbed, hinted
at by such song titles as "Son of
Sam" and "Maybe If They Bum
Me."
Netherworld are five musi
cians who write complex, con
voluted songs that, although
structured, are not confined to
the mundane regimens of com
mercial rock music. Particular
ly noteworthy is the fact that the
band is not afraid to play around
with a tricky vocal line, and
does so to great effect on the
songs "Straight Into Infinity"
and "Sargasso."
Netherworld's precise,
layered sound and obtuse lyrics
are bound to put some people in
mind of vintage Genesis, but
Netherworld is definitely a
group with a fresh approach all
its own. In the Following Half-
Light is a phenomenal record
that seems to get better every
time I hear it, and though it isn't
for everybody, I highly recom
mend it to people who like music
that goes beyond bip-bop.
