If you think the summer is
going to be long and hot you may
be right, but Student Arts at
Stanford (STARTS) promises to
make it less so. STARTS has or
ganized a series of classes, lec
tures, concerts and excursions.
While the emphasis seems to
be on jazz, with a jazz lecture
series, a jazz dance class and
workshop and jazz concerts
there are rock as well as classi
cal concerts planned.
Special events during the
summer includc a violin and pi
ano recital to be given by Leon
Spierer, concertmaster of the
Berlin Philharmonic and pianist
Anna Fujita-Teng and an exibi
tion of Russian artists now in ex
ile.
Classes include crochet,
guitar, caligraphy, exercise,
ballroom and jazz dance, and
drawing for non-artists. Ex
cursion highlights include an af
ternoon in Stern Grove with the
San Francisco Ballet, and trips
to the Lick Observatory and
Alcatraz.
