# Too much Stern in China
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
It is difficult to figure out why
some films get critical acclaim
while others pass by unnoticed.
Two films playing in the area
have been, in my opinion, gross
ly overrated.
The first, From Mao to
Mozart, the hour and half long
Academy-Award-winning
documentary on Isaac Stern's
visit to the People's Republic of
China in 1979, would be more ap
propriately named From Isaac
Stern to Isaac Stern. The film is
more Isaac than China.
True, Stern is fascinating to
watch. He certainly knows what
he is talking about when he
picks up a violin. He has a pas
sion for music and an intuition,
a sixth sense that inspires the
musicians around him. But
while Stern may live music he is
also a showman. The trip to Chi
na is also a trip for his ego.
Where else can he find au
diences of thousands sitting at
the edge of their seats starved
for the music which was denied
them for so long, audiences
hanging on every note and word
of advice he has to offer?
Stern went to China with his
family and pianist David Golub
not for a concert tour but to '' say
hello through music." They
went to offer advice and instruc
tion. It is a pity he did not do it
with more humility and dis
cretion.
It is difficult not to feel com
passion for some of the young vi
olinists who are scolded not in
the privacy of a classroom but
on a stage with thousands
watching. Surprisingly, though,
Stern is good at putting the ter
ror-stricken musicians at ease.
He is able to make them laugh at
themselves.
"There must be life in each
note," he tells a young boy at the
Shanghai conservatory, "You
are a very musical boy. Why
don't you do what your heart
tells you; what your ear tells

you?"
But the other side of Stern's
character must have given his
hosts headaches. When his
group arrives at Shanghai, the
city port with European past
evident in its architecture, he
and Golub decide that the con
cert hall's grand piano is just
not good enough for a concert.
When Stern is told that no oth
er piano exists he sheepishly
suggests to his hosts that they
will have to fly in a piano from
Beijing in a military cargo
plane overnight. His hosts con
fer in whispers and explain that
the army has no experience
moving pianos but Stern insists.
The next morning a truck ar
rives with an acceptable piano
from a local radio station.
As for the view of China that
we get from the film, there are
plenty of the endless platitudes,
the toasts of friendship that go
along with the tour of the For
bidden City and a lesson on eat
ing with chop sticks. But there is
also an interesting glimpse of
the persecution during the cul
tural revolution that began in
1966.
The effects of the cultural
revolution are evident in the
quality of music among musi
cians in their early 20s who
were learning when the schools
were closed and western music
forbidden.
Prof. Tan Shuzhen of the
Shanghai Conservatory tells of
his 14 month imprisonment in a
dark closet over a septic tank.
But worse than imprisonment
was the humiliation that he and
his colleagues felt when they
were branded criminals. Ten
professors commited suicide.
"They could not stand the hu
miliation of the mind," Shuzhen
explained in his softspoken
voice.
The second overrated film is
Nikita Mikhalov's Oblomov. So
praised by many critics, it is
plodding and heavy handed. The

film follows Ivan Goncharov's
novel of the same title perhaps
too closely.
The novel, which was written
in the middle of 19th century, is
contemporary enough. It is
about a melancholy young
nobleman, Oblomov, who does
not know what to do with his life.
He decides to do nothing. Life is
just too strenuous and bother
some.
Oblomov's only friend Stoltz
has a character diametrically
opposed to Oblomov's. Stolz is
an officer and a vegetarian who
believes in living every con
ceivable second to the fullest.
Stoltz despairs at the sight of his
lethargic childhood friend and
decides to remedy the situation.
Stoltz sets Oblomov up with
Olga, a good friend. The medi
cine has an immediate effect on
the patient. Oblomov falls pas
sionately in love and it seems in
spite of Oblomov's clumsiness
that Olga falls in love with him.
Oblomov's life is transformed
overnight. He has a purpose at
last.
Unfortunately, when it comes
to the facts of life Oblomov ends
up on the weak side: he doesn't
quite know what to do, and Olga
is not about to thiow herself
away.
Unfortunately for Mikhalov,
film is a visual medium. With
the endless shots of Oblomov
sleeping on his living room
couch while the narrator drones
on, you may well catch the
dreaded disease of Oblomovism
before you even leave the
theatre.
There are also unbearable
flashbacks to Oblomov's child
hood which seemed to be filled
with the order not to wake up his
sleeping "mummy." Is that
meant to be an explanation for
his love of sleep? I hope not.
There are a few good mo
ments in the film. Oleg Tabakov
as Oblomov gets some laughs
but those came mostly from the
predominantly Russian au
dience when I saw the film dur
ing the San Francisco film festi
val. The film, like so many other
Soviet films, is plagued by over
acting and excessive length —
21/2 hours.

the toasts of friendship that go
along with the tour of the For
bidden City and a lesson on eat
ing with chop sticks. But there is
also an interesting glimpse of
the persecution during the cul
tural revolution that began in
1966.
The effects of the cultural
revolution are evident in the
quality of music among musi
cians in their early 20s who
were learning when the schools
were closed and western music
forbidden.
Prof. Tan Shuzhen of the
Shanghai Conservatory tells of
his 14 month imprisonment in a
dark closet over a septic tank.
But worse than imprisonment
was the humiliation that he and
his colleagues felt when they
were branded criminals. Ten
professors commited suicide.
"They could not stand the hu
miliation of the mind," Shuzhen
explained in his softspoken
voice.
The second overrated film is
Nikita Mikhalov's Oblomov. So
praised by many critics, it is
plodding and heavy handed. The

film follows Ivan Goncharov's
novel of the same title perhaps
too closely.
The novel, which was written
in the middle of 19th century, is
contemporary enough. It is
about a melancholy young
nobleman, Oblomov, who does
not know what to do with his life.
He decides to do nothing. Life is
just too strenuous and bother
some.
Oblomov's only friend Stoltz
has a character diametrically
opposed to Oblomov's. Stolz is
an officer and a vegetarian who
believes in living every con
ceivable second to the fullest.
Stoltz despairs at the sight of his
lethargic childhood friend and
decides to remedy the situation.
Stoltz sets Oblomov up with
Olga, a good friend. The medi
cine has an immediate effect on
the patient. Oblomov falls pas
sionately in love and it seems in
spite of Oblomov's clumsiness
that Olga falls in love with him.
Oblomov's life is transformed
overnight. He has a purpose at
last.
Unfortunately, when it comes
to the facts of life Oblomov ends
up on the weak side: he doesn't
quite know what to do, and Olga
is not about to thiow herself
away.
Unfortunately for Mikhalov,
film is a visual medium. With
the endless shots of Oblomov
sleeping on his living room
couch while the narrator drones
on, you may well catch the
dreaded disease of Oblomovism
before you even leave the
theatre.
There are also unbearable
flashbacks to Oblomov's child
hood which seemed to be filled
with the order not to wake up his
sleeping "mummy." Is that
meant to be an explanation for
his love of sleep? I hope not.
There are a few good mo
ments in the film. Oleg Tabakov
as Oblomov gets some laughs
but those came mostly from the
predominantly Russian au
dience when I saw the film dur
ing the San Francisco film festi
val. The film, like so many other
Soviet films, is plagued by over
acting and excessive length —
21/2 hours.
It is difficult to figure out why
some films get critical acclaim
while others pass by unnoticed.
Two films playing in the area
have been, in my opinion, gross
ly overrated.
The first, From Mao to
Mozart, the hour and half long
Academy-Award-winning
documentary on Isaac Stern's
visit to the People's Republic of
China in 1979, would be more ap
propriately named From Isaac
Stern to Isaac Stern. The film is
more Isaac than China.
True, Stern is fascinating to
watch. He certainly knows what
he is talking about when he
picks up a violin. He has a pas
sion for music and an intuition,
a sixth sense that inspires the
musicians around him. But
while Stern may live music he is
also a showman. The trip to Chi
na is also a trip for his ego.
Where else can he find au
diences of thousands sitting at
the edge of their seats starved
for the music which was denied
them for so long, audiences
hanging on every note and word
of advice he has to offer?
Stern went to China with his
family and pianist David Golub
not for a concert tour but to '' say
hello through music." They
went to offer advice and instruc
tion. It is a pity he did not do it
with more humility and dis
cretion.
It is difficult not to feel com
passion for some of the young vi
olinists who are scolded not in
the privacy of a classroom but
on a stage with thousands
watching. Surprisingly, though,
Stern is good at putting the ter
ror-stricken musicians at ease.
He is able to make them laugh at
themselves.
"There must be life in each
note," he tells a young boy at the
Shanghai conservatory, "You
are a very musical boy. Why
don't you do what your heart
tells you; what your ear tells

you?"
But the other side of Stern's
character must have given his
hosts headaches. When his
group arrives at Shanghai, the
city port with European past
evident in its architecture, he
and Golub decide that the con
cert hall's grand piano is just
not good enough for a concert.
When Stern is told that no oth
er piano exists he sheepishly
suggests to his hosts that they
will have to fly in a piano from
Beijing in a military cargo
plane overnight. His hosts con
fer in whispers and explain that
the army has no experience
moving pianos but Stern insists.
The next morning a truck ar
rives with an acceptable piano
from a local radio station.
As for the view of China that
we get from the film, there are
plenty of the endless platitudes,
the toasts of friendship that go
along with the tour of the For
bidden City and a lesson on eat
ing with chop sticks. But there is
