Khomeini dismisses Bani-Sadr
Tehran, Iran — Iran's religious leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, yesterday dismissed President
Abolhasan Bani-Sadr after an overwhelming vote in
parliament Sunday that he was incompetent to hold of
fice.
Later the ayatollah said on Tehran Radio that he had
taken the decision "with great regret," but that the
president "was thinking only of himself and not of Is
lam."
Khomeini said he had tried to prevent "this sort of
problem," but in spite of all his efforts Bani-Sadr had
not understood when the ayatollah asked him to "cut
himself off from the hypocrites."
The ayatollah said he had "sympathy" with the
former president - -defeated in a lengthy conflict with
the clergy-dominated parliament - but Bani-Sadr
lacked "political sense." He advised him not to "seek
the protection of foreign wolves" and said that it was
not too late for Bani-Sadr to denounce as atheists
'those who have issued statements against Islam."
Khomeini praised parliament which, he said, "will
resist all deviations," despite the large majority of the
Fundmentalist Islamic Republican Party, he insisted,
"parliament is made up of independent people and is
dominated by no party or group."

ing a controversial and long-delayed assessment of the
late Chairman Mao Zedong in an attempt to balance
his achievements and mistakes, venerating him as a
great revolutionary but abrogating most of his policies.
Taken together, Hua'sreplacement, along-expected
but still difficult move, and the formal Mao reassesse
ment will mark the end of the Maoist era in China. Seri
ous differences on both questions delayed the meeting

SSS warns draft non-registrants
Washington — The Selective Service System has
mailed its first warning letters to young men who failed
to register for a possible military draft, officials dis
closed vesterdav.

Selective Service Deputy Director Brayton Harris
said 150 letters were mailed Friday in the agency's first
attempt at enforcement.
Special registration periods were held last summer
and in January in which some 5.5 million young men
signed up, Harris said. He estimated that as many as
250,000 failed to register.
Men are required to register at local post offices
within 30 days of their 18th birthday. Failure to do so is
a felony carrying a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine
and five years in prison.
Although there is no draft now, registration is being
conducted to establish a pool of names and addresses
for use in the event of national emergency.
Harris said the letters sent Friday went to people
about whom the agency had received complaints. For
example, he said, a parent might complain that his son
signed up, but that one of his buddies had not.
Settlement averts air strike
Washington — Hundreds of thousands of relieved
travelers flew America's skies yesterday after a con
tract dispute was settled with air traffic controllers
just two hours before a threatened strike that could
have grounded more than half of the commercial
flights.
The tentative agreement, reached after all-night
bargaining, was a victory for President Reagan, who
declared last week the government would not offer any
more money than the $40 million package it placed on
the table weeks ago.
The union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers
Organization, originally sought $770 million. But, under
pressure from the administration and Congress, it
agreed to the government figure after redistributing
the money within the package. The actual figure is $39.3
million.
Chapman pleads guilty
New York — Mark Chapman, saying he was heeding
orders from God, pleaded guilty yesterday to the
murder of former Beatle John Lennon and cut off a trial
that could have revealed his reasons for pumping four
bullets into one of the greatest stars of modern music.
Acting Justice Dennis Edwards accepted the plea,
which was made moments before jury selection for the
murder trial was to begin in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan. Edwards set Aug. 24 for sentencing.
Lawyers said Edwards promised Chapman would re
ceive at least 20 years in prison. But the 26-year-old
former mental patient must first undergo a psychiatric
exam, and if found insane, the plea could be thrown out
and Chapman sent to a mental institution.

Baseball talks cancelled
New York —A brief ray of hope in the 11-day-old ma
jor league baseball strike dissolved today when federal
mediator Kenneth Moffett canceled a scheduled re
sumption of negotiations.
Moffett had announced this morning an agreement
by both sides to resume negotiations at 3:30 p.m. Tues
day in New York's Doral Inn. Then, about three hours
later, the meeting was called off and the mediation ser
vice said no further talks were planned.
Talks in baseball strike broke off Friday with Moffett
declaring that no further negotiations would beheld un
til one side or the other indicated a willingness to move
on the issues. If he had any indication of that, it was
short-lived and ended abruptly.
Nixon can be sued
Washington — A deadlocked Supreme Court yester
day permitted former President Richard Nixon and
three of his highest-ranking aides to be sued in federal
court for violating the constitutional rights of Morton
Halperin, a former White House national-security aide.
But the Supreme Court failed to settle the broad con
stitutional question of whether an American president
and his advisers are absolutely immune from personal
damage suits. The justices agreed to try to decide this
issue again in the fall by reviewing another, separate
lawsuit filed against Nixon.
Halperin's home telephone was wiretapped for 21
months in the early days of the Nixon administration,
during and after his service in the White House. When
the wiretap was disclosed during the 1973 criminal trial
of Daniel Ellsberg, Halperin filed a lawsuit charging
Nixon; Henry Kissinger, his secretary of state; John
Mitchell, the attorney general, and H.R. Haldeman, the
White House chief of staff, with violating his rights.
