# China softens on US— Taiwan arms
## 
### Washington Post 
Beijing — From the sound
and fury of China's propaganda
mill since Alexander Haig left
last week, one might think the
American secretary of state had
eaten more crow than Peking
duck during his three days of
talks here with Chinese leaders.
On the day Haig left, Beijing
broadly hinted that it was re
thinking its anti-Soviet policy
that has pushed China closer to
the United States since 1979.
Then it warned again of the dire
consequences that could arise
from President Ronald Rea
gan's continued support of arms
sales to Taiwan.
This hard-line talk, however,
belies the more relaxed ap
proach Beijing apparently
adopted in talks with U.S. of
ficials. Despite threats before
the visit, Beijing did not insist
on a cutoff of U.S. arms to
Taiwan as a condition of further
developing Sino-American rela
tions.
While still grumbling about
U.S. arms transfers to Taiwan
when the talks ended, Beijing
nevertheless moved closer to a
military relationship with the
United States by agreeing to
send a high-level delegation to
Washington in August to discuss
purchases of U.S. lethal weap
ons.
"When dealing with the Chi
nese, you have to distinguish be
tween their position and the im
plementation of their position,"
observed a diplomat who has ne
gotiated with Beijing for years.
The diplomat said Beijing
often stakes out extreme posi
tions on touchy issues, then soft
ens its stand if compromise
serves its interests best ; never
theless, it continues to state the
original position as official poli
cy.
A Chinese official said
privately just before Haig's vis
it, "There is a difference be
tween theory and practice. We
would like in theory to have no

(U.S.) sales of weapons to
Taiwan. But we live in a prac
tical world."
Just what persuaded China to
take a more flexible stance dur
ing the talks remains un
disclosed. Chinese sources in
dicated that while Haig refused
to rule out future arms sales to
Taiwan, he stressed that Wash
ington would do nothing to sacri
fice the larger strategic in
terests it shares with Beijing,
especially containing the Soviet
advance in Asia.
