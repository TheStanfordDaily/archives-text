Islamabad, Pakistan (AP) —
The United States has agreed to
give Pakistan $3 billion in eco
nomic aid and military sales
credits over the next six years,
Foreign Minister Agha Shahi
said last week.
He said Washington also
agreed "urgently" to sell the Is
lamic nation an undisclosed
number of F-16 fighter-bomb
ers.
The aid package, worked out
during weekend talks with U.S.
Undersecretary of State James
Buckley, must be approved by
the U.S. Congress.
Shahi told a news conference
that "our Islamic friends" will
help Pakistan pay for the "ur
gently required" defense equip
ment. Informed sources said he
was referring to Saudi Arabia, a
close ally of this non-aligned na
tion.
About half of the $3 billion will
go for military equipment, a re
duction from the 80 percent pre
viously planned, Shahi said.
A joint statement issued at
the end of the Shahi-Buckley
talks said the U.S. diplomat
"specifically disclaimed any
American interest in military
bases (in Pakistan) or in estab
lishing any new alliances."
It said the two men discussed

the threat to regional security
posed by the presence of "for
eign" troops in neighboring Af
ghanistan. That referred to an
estimated 85,000 Soviet soldiers
who entered Afghanistan in De
cember 1979 to help that coun
try's Marxist government bat
tle Moslem rebels.
Buckley left Islamabad Mon
day to visit an Afghan refugee

camp in the southwestern prov
ince of Baluchistan.
The United States cut off aid
to Pakistan in 1979 because
American intelligence reports
said Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-
Haq's military regime was ac
quiring nuclear arms capabili
ty, which violated U.S. nuclear
non-proliferation laws. The
Reagan administration has

asked Congress to exempt Paki
stan from those laws.
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman David Pas
sage said the administration
believes a stronger, more self
confident Pakistan would be
more capable of withstanding
pressures from the presence of
the Soviet troops in Afghan
istan.
