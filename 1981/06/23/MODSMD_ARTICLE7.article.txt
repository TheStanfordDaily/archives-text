# Israeli election is too close to

Tel Aviv, Israel (AP) — With Menachem Begin
pulling ahead of Shimon Peres in the polls, the Is
raeli premiership may end up going to the one who
scrambles hardest for the support of the splinter
parties competing in the June 30 election.
At least six obscure factions stand to gain
enough of the 120 seats in parliament to give them
muscle in the arduous coalition-building process
likely to follow.
Every one will count if the polls are right and
Begin s Likud bloc as well as Peres' Labor Party
both win 40-odd seats.
No party has ever won a majority in the
Knesset, or parliament, and shaky coalition gov
ernments are a fact of Israeli life.
But never has the Israeli electorate been so
skittish or the outcome of an election so in doubt
as this year.
Political analysts who just six months ago pre
dicted a thumping victory for Peres are now be
ginning to paint a scenario in which neither Likud

nor Labor will be able to form a coalition that can
deal with such complex issues as the Palestinian
question and the triple-digit inflation rate.
If no government can be formed in the 42 days
officially allotted by the president to the premier
designate, another election will have to be held
before the year is out.
Likud is promising to expand Jewish presence
in the West Bank of the Jordan, strengthen the
peace treaty with Egypt and maintain its laissez
faire economic polices.
Labor wants to trade the Arab-populated parts
of the West Bank for peace with Jordan while
tightening controls over the economy to share the
pie more equitably between rich and poor.
The splinter groups range from the leftist Shelli
party advocating Palestinian statehood under Is
rael's arch enemy, the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization, to far right Tehiya which wants to tear
up the peace treaty with Egypt, halt Israel's with
drawal from Sinai and annex the West Bank.
