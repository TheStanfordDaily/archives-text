# Congress works on new immigration policy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Rancho Bernardo, Calif. —
Pointing to an "emerging con
sensus" among congressmen,
the chairmen of the House and
Senate subcommittees on Im
migration and Refugee Policies
said Saturday that lawmakers
are close to developing a com
prehensive national policy that
could deal with the nation's
meddlesome immigration prob
lems.
The ingredients of that na
tional policy would probably be
made more clear next week
when the Reagan adminis
tration is expected to unveil its
recommendations on how to
deal with the massive flow of il
legal aliens and refugees into
the United States, they said.
Agreement on such critical is
sues as employer sanctions, in
creased enforcement, national
identification cards, amnesty
and a guest worker program,
clearly indicate that lawmakers
are focusing in on the thorny im
migration problem, according
to Rep. Romano Mazzoli, (D-
Ky. )and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-
Wyo.)
Simpson, who chairs the Sen
ate subcommittee on Immigra
tion and Refugee Policy said
that in order for the national im
migration policy to work it has
to include increased enforce
ment, employer sanctions and a
counterfeit-proof identification
card.
"If we don't have all three, we
ain't got nothing. Only then can
we start talking about amnes
ty," he said.
Simpson and Mazzoli, who
chair the House subcommittee
on Immigration and Refugee
Policies, made their comments

at a national immigration con
ference that also was attended
by U.S. ambassador to Mexico
John Gavin.
Gavin told the gathering that
the recent meeting at Camp
David between President
Ronald Reagan and Mexican
President Jose Lopez Portillo
had included much discussion
about the problem of illegal mi
gration into the United States.
The meeting, according to
Gavin, was more for the
purpose of establishing better
rapport between the two na
tions. He did say that the Rea

gan administration is "close to
developing a pilot guest worker
program."
The guest worker program
would allow Mexican workers to
come into the United States on a
temporary basis to fill jobs that
Americans are not interested in
doing.
Mazzoli said that reaction in
Washington to the guest worker
program has been checkered,
and that the more critical issues
at hand are employer sanctions,
a national identification card
and developing a ceiling for the
number of immigrants that are

allowed to come into the United
States each year.
Mazzoli said public pressure
and growing public awareness
of the immigration problems
demand a national policy. He
cautioned, though, that polls
showing anti-migration senti
ments throughout the country
might lead to the exclusion of
humane considerations within
the policy.
He said "If we have a guest
worker program, we'd have to
condition workers to the point
where they would not stay (for a
long-term period)." He echoed
Simpson's comments that a na

tional immigration policy can
not be developed in a piecemeal
approach. "It has to be a pack
age approach," he said.
One major item of concern is
the high number of legal immi
gration visas that are issued
yearly but the relatively few
who enter the United States
with the purpose of finding em
ployment.
Both Mazzoli and Simpson
said the massive influx of refu
gees from places like Southeast
Asia and the Carribeean are
also going to necessitate a ma
jor revision of the refugee poli
cy act of 1980.
