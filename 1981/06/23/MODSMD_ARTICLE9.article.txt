# Schools treat pregnant teens badly
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Santa Monica, Calif. — Schools, by law,
can no longer expel students for being preg
nant. But they often encourage pregnant
teen-agers to drop out, either by ignoring
them altogether or providing token pro
grams, usually aimed at keeping their
swelling stomachs out of sight, a report by
the Rand Corp. says.
Research psychologist Gail Zellman, who
conducted the 2 1/2 year study of 30 schools
across the country says the implications of
the educational system's not-so-benign neg
lect are wide: about 1 million adolescents
get pregnant each year, and more than half
choose to keep their babies. But 80 percent
drop out of school, compared with a dropout
ri i of 9 percent for other teen-agers.
High school dropouts are more likely to
end up on welfare, and the offspring of
adolescent mothers have a higher mortality
rate or, if they survive, may show deficits in
intelligence, school achievement and over
all adjustment, statistics show.
Title IX of the 1972 Education Amend
ments prohibits expulsion or exclusion of
pregnant students from programs, courses

and extracurricular activities. Few
schools, however, responded to that law "in
a positive, constructive manner," Zellman
says, because it did not mandate special
programs.
Rand researchers interviewed 121 teen
agers and examined exiting programs in 11
school systems that were attempting to deal
with the problem of pregnant dropouts.
The programs served from 24 to 350 young
mothers a year, drawing from enrollments
of from under 10.000 to more than 200,000,
and used a variety of approaches :
Some pulled pregnant teen-agers out of
regular school until their babies were born,
providing courses and services in a separate
physical setting. These were usually located
in rundown inner-city facilities and tended
to emphasize parenting and child-develop
ment courses at the expense of academic
standards.
Others, which Zellman favors, tried to in
tegrate health and child-care services into
the regular school schedule right up to grad
uation. The system most often loses stu
dents by requiring them to transfer in and
out of regular schools.

The other, in St. Paul, Minn., is primarily
oriented toward pregnancy prevention and
medical care, placing medical clinics in
high school and providing child care.
Most of the special programs, which cost
from the same to as much as nine times the
usual expenditure per pupil, are publicly
funded, either through state special educa
tion funds or by individual school districts.
Critics argue that pregnancy programs
are a misuse of funds that would otherwise
go for handicapped or disabled students,
Zellman said, but proponents counter that
helping the girls through a "temporary dis
ability" carries a long-term payoff — their
finishing school and staying off the welfare
rolls.
Zellman found that the teen-agers studied
did not match the stereotype of teen parents
— low-income, low-achieving, often minor
ity, with few prospects for the future.
Their backgrounds were diverse; most
said they would not become pregnant or
would have abortions if they had it to do
over, and nearly all had made their de
cisions about parenthood without help from
the school.
