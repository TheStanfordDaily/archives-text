"Not too long ago
I was speechless.
Now I'm teaching Ben
how to talk"

Cancer of the
larynx is one of the
most treatable
cancers. If
discovered in time, 9
out of 10 patients are
curable. Of these,
two-thirds learn to
speak again, thanks
to a rehabilitation
program of the
A CS. Early
detection and
prompt treatment
can save your life
and your voice.
