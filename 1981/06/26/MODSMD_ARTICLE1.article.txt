# Supreme Court approves men-only draft
## Congress can exclude women from registration, service 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Supreme
Court yesterday upheld the na
tion's military draft law, reject
ing arguments that it is un
constitutional because it applies
to men and not to women.
Dividing 6-3, the court de
cided that it should show special
deference to the judgment of
Congress on military or national
defense issues. Its ruling over
turned a decision last year by a
three-judge federal court in
Philadelphia, which held that
Congress, in requiring only men
to register for the draft, had im
properly engaged in sex dis
crimination.
Here, Stanford Students
Against Conscription (SAC)
member John Stacy said the
main importance of the ruling
was that it "removed another
obstacle to the draft. The mat
ter had to be dealt with so that
there was no question about the
constitutionality of regis
tration."

He said that SAC has had
"strong participation by women
all along and we expect this will
continue" despite the fact that
women are no longer liable to
registration.
SAC member Dennis Florig
said "consciousness of the draft
issue has been fading. But every
time it hits the news, conscious
ness is raised."
"This is not merely a case in
volving the customary defer
ence accorded congressional de
cisions," Justice William Rehn
quist for the court."The case
arises in the context of Con
gress' authority over national
defense and military affairs,
and perhaps in no other area has
the court accorded Congress
greater deference."
That reasoning provoked a
heated retort from Justice
Thurgood Marshall, who main
tained in a dissenting opinion
that the federal draft statute vi
olated constitutional guaran
tees of the equal protection of

the laws.
"Even in the area of military
affairs, deference to con
gressional judgments cannot be
allowed to shade into an abdica
tion of this court's ultimate re
sponsibility to decide constitu
tional questions," Marshall
said.
Brennan, White also dissent
Justices William Brennan
and Byron White also dissented.
Those joining Rehnquist's opin
ion were Chief Justice Warren
Burger and Justices Lewis
Powell, Potter Stewart, John
Paul Stevens and Harry Black
mun.
The decision ends a year of
uncertainty over the legitimacy
of the 1980 male-only regis
tration program, which was in

stituted by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan. As a re
sult of the ruling, the Depart
ment of Justice can now begin to
prosecute young men who have
failed to register for the draft.
A Department of Justice
spokesman said yesterday that
the department had not decided
whether or to what extent it
would prosecute men who failed
to register.
The Selective Service System
has not recommended any indi
viduals to the Department of
Justice for prosecution. But on
June 19. it wrote to 150 young
men who had not yet registered,
in effect warning them that if
they failed to do so soon, their
names would be sent to the Jus

tice Department.
According to the Selective
Service System, approximately
5.77 million young men have
registered for the draft out of an
eligible base of 6.3 million. Men
are now required to register
within 30 days of their 18th
birthday. Under the law, failure
to register may be punished by
up to five years in prison and a
$5000 fine.
Although there have been re
curring complaints among
some military and con
gressional leaders about the all
volunteer Army, President
Ronald Reagan has said that he
will try to make the volunteer
force work and has not moved to
reinstitute the draft.
