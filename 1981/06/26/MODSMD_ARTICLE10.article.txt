# Cliveden House offers strong summer studies
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
All quarters are created
equal, but some quarters are
created more equal than others;
the summer quarter has begun,
and in case you haven't noticed,
there is a distinct paucity erf stu
dents. This shortage is com
plemented by a markedly ab
breviated course list, even in
the reknowned Overseas Stud
ies Program. Yes, it is summer,
and Cliveden stands alone as the
sole sunny offering .
Yet this was not always the
case. In 1958 Overseas Studies
was born. Its popularity grew,
and campuses began to spring
up in all corners of Europe,
funded by the then-mighty
dollar. England, then Florence
and Tours, etc., until Stanford
was as well represented as any
American university.

A depressing tumble for the dollar on the
foreign exchange markets drastically
increased the cost of running such a vast
num berof campuses.

In those days of Liberal
Education, students were still
willing to broaden their horizons
for a whole two quarters. The
programs were designed to last
for six months, from September
to March and from March to
September.
Although the structure of the
programs was much more rigid
than it is today, there was no
shortage of volunteers. Num
bers kept growing until they
reached a peak between 1967
and 1970, with about 800 students
abroad during the year. This
made a total of 1600 student
quarters abroad (as all pro
grams ran two quarters).
As the 1970s rolled in, though,
fewer students opted for foreign
studies, and by 1973 the Over
seas Studies Program was run
ning at a mere 69 percent of ca

pacity. At the same time, a de
pressing tumble for the dollar
on the foreign exchange mar
kets drastically increased the
cost of running such a vast
number of campuses. These two
factors combined presented an
incentive to trim excesses. A
1974 budget cut, halving Over
seas Studies' receipts from the
University's General Funds (65
percent of their budget ori
ginates from this fund) made
the cutbacks a necessity.
The whole program was
restructured. Instead of 1900
student quarters, the program
offered only 900. This has al
lowed the program to run very
efficiently, at approximately 98
percent of capacity. One of the
major alterations was the in
troduction of the single quarter
option, which allowed students

with heavy on-campus commit
ments, such as football players
and engineers, to take advan
tage of this unique opportunity.
Although the budget cut
helped to streamline overseas
operations, however, it prac
tically eliminated the summer
studies program. Only Cliveden
emerged from this assault on
funding, and is still in existence
today.
There are several reasons for
Cliveden's survival. During the
summer Cliveden offers a
"focused program." It treats
specific themes of special in
terest to pre-professionals, such
as health care, delivery and
public policy for pre-meds, and
comparative aspects of Anglo-
American Law, for pre-law stu
dents. Demand for these cur
ricula is high, since in the sum

mer, anyone can attend without
interfering with some vital
three-course series, or any oth
er required set of courses. Ac
cording to Corb Smith of the Ov
erseas Studies Office, "since
summer-focus programs at
tract students in important
numbers, there is a future for
them;" there is, however "one
real kicker, they cost us more
money. Professional school fac
ulty ask more than those in the
humanities and social science
departments." He still remains
optimistic, though.
As for Cliveden itself, its
future seems more precarious.
Cliveden, one of England's
stately homes, left to the Na
tional Trust (an organization for
the preservation of historical

landmarks) by the Astor family,
has been leased to Stanford "on
quite favorable terms," accord
ing to Smith. The major cost has
been maintenance. Stanford has
had to replumb, reheat, rewire
and reinsulate the building. But
now that these considerable
capital expenditures are out of
the way, the rent is low. For this
reason Overseas Studies has
lived with many disadvantages
and deferred moving for as long
as possible.
To find another home for a
program in Britain — Oxford
and London are the two top can
didates — would cost the Over-

seas Office " half as much again
for half the number of stu
dents," says Smith. Thus the re
luctance to find new quarters is
very understandable. There
would, however, be many ad
vantages in moving.
Cliveden is located 45 minutes
to an hour away from London
and Oxford. This isolates stu
dents, and as one newly re
turned Clivedenite complains,
this isolation "made it very dif
ficult to meet English people
one's own age." Being so far

away from the center of town
also prevents one from taking
full advantage of cultural
events.
The main problem, however,
lies in attracting British facul
ty. It is no easy job luring pro-,
fessors to outlying regions, an j
hour away from their cosy lairs,'
and as the program hinges on
British participation, some
thing needs to be done.
The possibility of locating the
summer-focus program in an
other country has been just
about ruled out. Much of its ap
peal lies in the fact that there is
no language requirement, and

that in-depth study, and even in
ternships, are possible. Tackl
ing linguistic obstacles could
only detract from the efficiency
of the program.
So it seems Britain will re
main the home of the sole real
summer program (there is a mi
nor archaeological expedition to
Peru, but funding for this comes
from elsewhere). Cliveden is a
beautiful place, but it seems as
if Stanford's only palace will
soon have to be deserted.

case. In 1958 Overseas Studies
was born. Its popularity grew,
and campuses began to spring
up in all corners of Europe,
funded by the then-mighty
dollar. England, then Florence
and Tours, etc., until Stanford
was as well represented as any
American university.

A depressing tumble for the dollar on the
foreign exchange markets drastically
increased the cost of running such a vast
num berof campuses.

In those days of Liberal
Education, students were still
willing to broaden their horizons
for a whole two quarters. The
programs were designed to last
for six months, from September
to March and from March to
September.
Although the structure of the
programs was much more rigid
than it is today, there was no
shortage of volunteers. Num
bers kept growing until they
reached a peak between 1967
and 1970, with about 800 students
abroad during the year. This
made a total of 1600 student
quarters abroad (as all pro
grams ran two quarters).
As the 1970s rolled in, though,
fewer students opted for foreign
studies, and by 1973 the Over
seas Studies Program was run
ning at a mere 69 percent of ca

pacity. At the same time, a de
pressing tumble for the dollar
on the foreign exchange mar
kets drastically increased the
cost of running such a vast
number of campuses. These two
factors combined presented an
incentive to trim excesses. A
1974 budget cut, halving Over
seas Studies' receipts from the
University's General Funds (65
percent of their budget ori
ginates from this fund) made
the cutbacks a necessity.
The whole program was
restructured. Instead of 1900
student quarters, the program
offered only 900. This has al
lowed the program to run very
efficiently, at approximately 98
percent of capacity. One of the
major alterations was the in
troduction of the single quarter
option, which allowed students

with heavy on-campus commit
ments, such as football players
and engineers, to take advan
tage of this unique opportunity.
Although the budget cut
helped to streamline overseas
operations, however, it prac
tically eliminated the summer
studies program. Only Cliveden
emerged from this assault on
funding, and is still in existence
today.
There are several reasons for
Cliveden's survival. During the
summer Cliveden offers a
"focused program." It treats
specific themes of special in
terest to pre-professionals, such
as health care, delivery and
public policy for pre-meds, and
comparative aspects of Anglo-
American Law, for pre-law stu
dents. Demand for these cur
ricula is high, since in the sum

mer, anyone can attend without
interfering with some vital
three-course series, or any oth
er required set of courses. Ac
cording to Corb Smith of the Ov
erseas Studies Office, "since
summer-focus programs at
tract students in important
numbers, there is a future for
them;" there is, however "one
real kicker, they cost us more
money. Professional school fac
ulty ask more than those in the
humanities and social science
departments." He still remains
optimistic, though.
As for Cliveden itself, its
future seems more precarious.
Cliveden, one of England's
stately homes, left to the Na
tional Trust (an organization for
the preservation of historical

landmarks) by the Astor family,
has been leased to Stanford "on
quite favorable terms," accord
ing to Smith. The major cost has
been maintenance. Stanford has
had to replumb, reheat, rewire
and reinsulate the building. But
now that these considerable
capital expenditures are out of
the way, the rent is low. For this
reason Overseas Studies has
lived with many disadvantages
and deferred moving for as long
as possible.
To find another home for a
program in Britain — Oxford
and London are the two top can
didates — would cost the Over-

seas Office " half as much again
for half the number of stu
dents," says Smith. Thus the re
luctance to find new quarters is
very understandable. There
would, however, be many ad
vantages in moving.
Cliveden is located 45 minutes
to an hour away from London
and Oxford. This isolates stu
dents, and as one newly re
turned Clivedenite complains,
this isolation "made it very dif
ficult to meet English people
one's own age." Being so far

away from the center of town
also prevents one from taking
full advantage of cultural
events.
The main problem, however,
lies in attracting British facul
ty. It is no easy job luring pro-,
fessors to outlying regions, an j
hour away from their cosy lairs,'
and as the program hinges on
British participation, some
thing needs to be done.
The possibility of locating the
summer-focus program in an
other country has been just
about ruled out. Much of its ap
peal lies in the fact that there is
no language requirement, and

that in-depth study, and even in
ternships, are possible. Tackl
ing linguistic obstacles could
only detract from the efficiency
of the program.
So it seems Britain will re
main the home of the sole real
summer program (there is a mi
nor archaeological expedition to
Peru, but funding for this comes
from elsewhere). Cliveden is a
beautiful place, but it seems as
if Stanford's only palace will
soon have to be deserted.
