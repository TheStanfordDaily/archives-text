# 'Flicks' manager optimistic
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
Even though this is merely
summer quarter, the great
Stanford institution, the Sunday
flicks, remains with us. Al
though it has suffered financial
losses over the past couple of
summers, Brian Boorstein, the
new manager, is optimistic
about at least breaking even this
year. "We have a good line-up,
and it should attract a good au
dience." He also added: "It
doesn't matter if we make a
loss, anyway; we've had sur
passes during the rest of the
year."
The flicks have done excellent
business this year, due to good
film selection and careful nego
tiation with distributors, and
Boorstein hopes to continue this
pattern. He has spent con
siderable time poring over
lists of individual films and
packages for his summer
choices, and has come up with a
creditable selection: M.A.S.H.,
Summer of '42, A Little Ro
mance, Take The Money and
Run, The Last Picture Show,
Kentucky Fried Movie and
Harold and Maude.
None of them are hot, new re
leases, but they could be de
scribed as established favor
ites. According to Boorstein,the
new releases, as shown during
the regular year cost four times
as much; with summer-time au
diences of about 500. it isn't
feasible to show any. "The phi
losophy during the year is to go
for the biggest and the best; in
the summer it is to get the best
and most enjoyable for the mon

ey," Boorstein said.
The selection policy is not
written down in any handbook,
nor is there a fixed committee
to vote on possible choices.
Each new manager has his own
technique. Boorstein makes a
list of movies that he considers
interesting and appealing
within a certain budget. He then
tries to feel out public opinion,
asking various people for their
input. This 'random committee'
provides him with valuable re
actions. This quarter he had
planned to screen Carnal
Knowledge, but after much
negative feed-back he opted for
Harold and Maude instead.
The flicks are in good finan
cial shape; although they only
charge students $1 admission,
attendance has been so high that
they are running a profit; this
money is channelled back into
the ASSU and is used to fund oth
er projects, or help the flicks in
less prosperous times — the
summer included.
Boorstein stated that "the
flicks are primarily a service to
the student; for that reason,

even if they make a loss, the stu
dent has a right to them." This
does not mean that every
effort is not made to keep the
books in the black. Over the
summer there will be only one
showing of each movie, at eight
o'clock; cutting the extra show
ing should save several hundred
dollars in projectionists' fees.
Extending the $1 admission to
everyone, although primarily
aimed at conferees and un
registered students, is likely to
attract more community mem
bers as well. Boorstein said that
as he didn't expect long lines
that would inconvenience regu
lar students, he saw no reason
not to include everyone in the $1
price.
There seems to be no reason
why Boorstein's optimism
shouldn't be realized. This sum
mer's movies are varied and ap
pealing. Don't devote your
whole Sunday night to the
books; give yourself a break, re
lax. eat popcorn, throw paper
planes, at the Sunday flicks; you
might even want to see the mov
