# Summer students seek sun, fun and...jobs
## 
### Karen Springen 
Housing requests and sum
mer enrollment have remained
consistent with the figures from
last year. But the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC) reports a significant in
crease in the number of students
coming in for job assignments
this summer as compared to
other summers.
Mary Wolf, assistant to the di
rector of the CPPC, said,
"There are definitely more peo
ple using the office than there
have been in past summers."
She speculated that the rise may
be bee e people are seeking
more e-professional ex
perienc. han in previous sum
mers. She added that stipends
are not meeting the financial
needs of graduate students. The
increase in applicants is across
the board, however.
"For the first time we have a
shortage of jobs," she said. "We
just can't keep up with (the de
mand)," she said. The center
posts 10 or 15 new job listings
each day, or about 250 jobs ev
ery month. But over 60 students
fill out job request forms per
day. "We just can't keep up with
it," said Wolf.
During the summer, the
CPPC usually expects 30 to 35
daily requests. (Fall and winter
are peak quarters — 60 to 80 stu
dents come in to the center each
day.) Wolf said the CPPC has
had more registrants this year
"all-around," not just in the
summer. She said signs of in
creased use of the center in
clude "running out of ID cards
two months early."
According to Wolf, tem
porary jobs, such as bartending
for $7.50 an hour, go most quick
ly. Technical jobs also are in
high demand. Housework is the
hardest position to fill. Clerical
work, traditionally unpopular,
is being snapped up now.
Off campus jobs are higher
paying than those at the Univer
sity. But, said Wolf, "(students)
still would prefer to have jobs on
campus for $3.50 an hour."
The CPPC usually gears de
velopment activities toward in
ternships. However, that this
may have to change if demand
continues at its present level,
according to Wolf.
Housing
The summer housing office in
Wilbur received almost 1000 ap
plications for the summer,
which is close to the number

sent to the office last year. The
University offers housing in
Crothers Memorial, Wilbur
Hall, Manzanita trailer park
and Mirrieles for the summer.
Manzanita and Mirrielees are
open only to regular Stanford
students. Both residences had
more applicants than spaces
available.
Patty Sullivan, an office as
sistant in summer housing, esti
mates that close to 50 openings
are available in Crothers Me
morial and Wilbur Hall. Walk
ins registering for activities in
short, intensive programs, will
temporarily fill these spaces.
Many students also live in
non-University housing both on
and off campus. Other resi
dences open for the summer in
clude Theta Chi, Theta Xi and
Sigma Chi.
Why stay?
Students cite a variety of rea
sons, generally geographical
and job-related, for remaining
on campus.
Junior Stosh Wolk said, "I
stayed because I live 8000 miles
away (in New Zealand)." He
added, "It's winter at home — I
like summer."
Other students wanted the ex
perience of working in a dif
ferent environment from other
summers. Senior Harold Mont
gomery said, "I wanted to work
away from home." His job with
a consulting firm here gives him
the opportunity to build new
contacts and to start business
projects in a new way, he said.
"This wasn't necessarily where
the best opportunity was, but it
is new and different," he added.
Junior Celeste Kruzic gave
yet another reason for staying
on campus. "We don't have
Yogurt Village at home!" she
said.
About the same number of
people applied for summer ses
sion courses as last year, said
Cecilia Corey of the special reg
istration and summer session
office. While 1016 applications
were received last year, 1122
were submitted this year.
(These numbers represent peo
ple coming to the University for
the summer only.)
Enrollment figures will not
be compiled until the end of Au
gust. Last year, however, the to
tal number of credit students
was 3426. And 570 terminal grad
uate students, 523 post-doctoral
students and 142 auditing stu
dents were registered as well.

contacts and to start business
projects in a new way, he said.
"This wasn't necessarily where
the best opportunity was, but it
is new and different," he added.
Junior Celeste Kruzic gave
yet another reason for staying
on campus. "We don't have
Yogurt Village at home!" she
said.
About the same number of
people applied for summer ses
sion courses as last year, said
Cecilia Corey of the special reg
istration and summer session
office. While 1016 applications
were received last year, 1122
were submitted this year.
(These numbers represent peo
ple coming to the University for
the summer only.)
Enrollment figures will not
be compiled until the end of Au
gust. Last year, however, the to
tal number of credit students
was 3426. And 570 terminal grad
uate students, 523 post-doctoral
students and 142 auditing stu
dents were registered as well.
Housing requests and sum
mer enrollment have remained
consistent with the figures from
last year. But the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC) reports a significant in
crease in the number of students
coming in for job assignments
this summer as compared to
other summers.
Mary Wolf, assistant to the di
rector of the CPPC, said,
"There are definitely more peo
ple using the office than there
have been in past summers."
She speculated that the rise may
be bee e people are seeking
more e-professional ex
perienc. han in previous sum
mers. She added that stipends
are not meeting the financial
needs of graduate students. The
increase in applicants is across
the board, however.
"For the first time we have a
shortage of jobs," she said. "We
just can't keep up with (the de
mand)," she said. The center
posts 10 or 15 new job listings
each day, or about 250 jobs ev
ery month. But over 60 students
fill out job request forms per
day. "We just can't keep up with
it," said Wolf.
During the summer, the
CPPC usually expects 30 to 35
daily requests. (Fall and winter
are peak quarters — 60 to 80 stu
dents come in to the center each
day.) Wolf said the CPPC has
had more registrants this year
"all-around," not just in the
summer. She said signs of in
creased use of the center in
clude "running out of ID cards
two months early."
According to Wolf, tem
porary jobs, such as bartending
for $7.50 an hour, go most quick
ly. Technical jobs also are in
high demand. Housework is the
hardest position to fill. Clerical
work, traditionally unpopular,
is being snapped up now.
Off campus jobs are higher
paying than those at the Univer
sity. But, said Wolf, "(students)
still would prefer to have jobs on
campus for $3.50 an hour."
The CPPC usually gears de
velopment activities toward in
ternships. However, that this
may have to change if demand
continues at its present level,
according to Wolf.
Housing
The summer housing office in
Wilbur received almost 1000 ap
plications for the summer,
which is close to the number

sent to the office last year. The
University offers housing in
Crothers Memorial, Wilbur
Hall, Manzanita trailer park
and Mirrieles for the summer.
Manzanita and Mirrielees are
open only to regular Stanford
students. Both residences had
more applicants than spaces
available.
Patty Sullivan, an office as
sistant in summer housing, esti
mates that close to 50 openings
are available in Crothers Me
morial and Wilbur Hall. Walk
ins registering for activities in
short, intensive programs, will
temporarily fill these spaces.
Many students also live in
non-University housing both on
and off campus. Other resi
dences open for the summer in
clude Theta Chi, Theta Xi and
Sigma Chi.
Why stay?
Students cite a variety of rea
sons, generally geographical
and job-related, for remaining
on campus.
Junior Stosh Wolk said, "I
stayed because I live 8000 miles
away (in New Zealand)." He
added, "It's winter at home — I
like summer."
Other students wanted the ex
perience of working in a dif
ferent environment from other
summers. Senior Harold Mont
gomery said, "I wanted to work
away from home." His job with
a consulting firm here gives him
the opportunity to build new
contacts and to start business
projects in a new way, he said.
"This wasn't necessarily where
the best opportunity was, but it
is new and different," he added.
