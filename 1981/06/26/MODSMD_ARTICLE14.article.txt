## A
						view from Japan: Gun control is not enough 
### 
Since the attempt to as
sassinate President Ronald
Reagan on March 30, I have
heard through the media what
the American people think of
gun control. As a Japanese soci
ologist, I would like to share
some thoughts on "violence,"
which I see as a disease in
digenous to American society,
as well as on prescriptions to
cure it.
1 am struck by certain con
trasts between Japanese and
American society. The Great
Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi,
who united Japan in the 16th

century, enforced a law widely
known as "Katana-Gari" or
"hunting the sword." He con
fiscated all dangerous weapons
from the people.
Thus a traaition was estab
lished that continues to this
day: it is illegal in-Japan for or
dinary citizens to keep guns or
swords.
In addition to this, thanks to
the relatively stable social or
der and dependable police or
ganization. there is no feeling of
danger which would xlrive the
Japanese to protect themselves
bv their own hands.

American society differs
from Japanese society in a
number of wavs_. The feeling of
belongingness to a common
community is much weaker
among Americans than among
Japanese: that is. there have
been more serious social
cleavages according to region,
class, ethnic affiliation, or gen
eration, partly because the
United States has undergone
rapid growth while absorbing
waves of immigrants from ev
ery corner of the globe.
Furthermore, in their values.
Americans are more individ
ualistic, materialistic, and
achievement-oriented than the
Japanese. In accordance with
their "individualism." which
holds that government interven
tion into societal and individual
matters is inherently un
desirable. many Americans be
lieve that they have a constitu
tional right to keep weapons in
order to maintain their own se

curity.
I would further like to suggest
that another important factor
which contributes to this socie
ty's vulnerability to violence is
"body-worship."
Americans seek to achieve a
strong and apparently beautiful
human body, which symbolizes
such personal virtues as
strength, youth, health,
achievement. etc* Thus, every
year, as summer approaches,
millions of Americans, old and
young, male and female, com
mute to "health centers" to
make their bodies healthy and
beautiful. May such "body-wor
ship" be related to violence?
The relationship is not entirely
incongruous if one sees that the
highly visible destruction of the
body may mean the rejection of
those values symbolized by it.
For these reasons, it seems to
me doubtful that you will be able
to reduce violence appreciably
simply through immediate en
forcement of gun-control legis
lation. Putting the constitu
tional debate aside, there would

be serious debates over costs
and benefits; for example, the
cost of regulation, the emer
gence of a black market, how ef
fectively gun control would pre
vent crime, and so forth, and the
consent and cooperation of the
American people as a whole
cannot be expected
Furthermore, if, as I have su.
gested the source of violence
lies at the very heart of <\mer
can values, a reduction in vr
lence will not result from lim:
ing access to the means of vio
lence alone.
Having said this, I do not wish
to be understood as arguing thai
nothing should be done. On tne
contrary. I hope that you Ameri
cans will start with a piece
meal approach to this difficult
social problem, striking a bal
ance between establishing the
basic moral principle Of societ\
on the one hand and conducting
a scientific cost-benefit
analysis on the other.
