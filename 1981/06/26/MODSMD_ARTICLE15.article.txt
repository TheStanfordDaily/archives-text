The Secretary of State has
vehemently expressed his de
termination to halt Soviet ex
pansionism in the Third World.
Much alarm has been raised
over Soviet influence in sundry
countries. The United States is
not prepared to allow strategic
waterways and vital raw mate
rials to fall under hostile domi
nation. To hinder this is a major
purpose of a military budget ap
proaching $200 billion.
Yet the administration calm
ly and with no apparent com
pensating gains has handed the
Communists or pro-Soviet
forces in the Third World a won
derful propaganda victory and
has given neutral or sympa
thetic forces cause to doubt the
motives of the United States.
For nearly everyone in the
Third World aware of the issue,
the lone United States vote
against recommending restric
tion of promotion of infant for
mulas will be ample evidence of
a cynical preference for the
profits of multinational corp
orations over the health of the
Third World babies.
The action of the World
Health Organization was only a
recommendation that coun
tries are free to implement or
disregard, and it sought only to
reduce persuasion of mothers to
switch from breast to bottle, not
to hinder sale of formula to
mothers who need it. Practical
ly everyone concerned with the
problem (except manufac
turers) seems to agree that use

of formula under the usual un
sanitary conditions is likely to
be disastrous. Politically en
gaged people know all this, and
the Voice of America can hardly
persuade them that the reasons
for the American position are
not ruthlessly commercial.
Does it matter what they
think? Everywhere that the So
viets have advanced in the Third
World it has been with the con
currence and support of a sec
tion of the population convinced
of the evils of capitalism. Even
in Afghanistan, it was a pro-So
viet party that started the trou
ble by seizing power in 1978.
The Soviets could not main
tain their presence in any coun
try where they do not have an
overwhelming military poten
tial (as they have in Eastern Eu
rope) unless considerable num
bers of people believed that the
United States is more threaten
ing ("imperialistic") than the
Soviet Union.
More missiles, submarines,
rapid displacement forces, and
so forth, are doubtless useful in
causing the Soviet leaders to be
cautious in their undertakings.
But how many Tridents, costing
how many billions, are required
to offset in the minds of the
Third World peoples and leaders
the doubts raised by America's
apparent unconcern about the
health of babies?
