## Unborn sperm 
### 
Having come into the world
as an accident myself. I have
something to say about the
rights of the fertilized egg.
While loudly defending the
rights of the fertilized egg,
haven't people overlooked an
equally important life? 1 am
speaking, of course, of the
rights of our haploid brothers,
who struggle through a myriad
of obstacles to accomplish the
miracle of conception.
If Congress has time to confer
personhood upon the fertilized
egg couldn't they also allow the
same rights to our haploid
brothers, the forgotten sperm?
Think of the struggling sperm
helplessly bombarding an in
visible sheild, using up all of its
tiny reserve in a hopeless effort
to follow its natural path toward
a receptive egg and, if fate
would have it, to form the
diploid generation.
Why make such a fuss about
the rights of a few cells. Haploid
or diploid, they are both part of
the reproductive scheme and,
with a little luck, could become
Doctors of Philosophy some
day.
