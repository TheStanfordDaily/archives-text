## Israel should use politics, not military might 
### 
For the past 33 years, the
United States and Israel have
enjoyed a special relationship.
Israel is our strongest ally in the
Middle East, and it is also the
only true democracy in that re
gion. But in recent months the
Israelis have taken a number of
actions that have made it more
and more difficult for the Unit
ed States to maintain its his
torically close relationship with
Israel.
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's policy of expanded set
tlements in the occupied territo
ries, his declaration that Jeru
salem is the official capital of
Israel, and his expulsion of Arab
mayors for the West Bank have
all heightened tensions in the
Middle East, while producing no
appreciable benefits for Israel's
security.
The Israeli strike on Iraq's
nuclear reactor can only en
hance the role of violence in the
region. The attack threatens to
undermine the fragile peace
that has prevailed during the
Syrian missile crisis.
Taking advantage of its tem
porary military superiority, Is
rael was able to carry out the
bombing without fear of retalia
tion or direct reprisal. But how
long can such a situation last?
Even with continued U.S. as
sistance, the Israelis will in
evitably find themselves one
day in a situation in which they
can no longer execute military

operations with impunity. And
when that day arrives, the Is
raelis may wish they had given
greater emphasis to political,
rather than military, solutions
to their problems.
This is not to suggest that Is
rael is the only source of in
stability in the region. Syria and
Iraq have been implacably
hostile toward Israel, Libya
continues to ferment terrorism
and unrest, and Jordan has re
fused to join in the peace proc
ess. Moreover, intra-Arab dis
putes and other conflicts, such
as Iraq's aggression against

OPINIONS

Iran and Libya's invasion of
Chad, would remain even if Is
rael ceased to exist.
Nevertheless, it is the Israelis
who have constantly resorted to
the use of force whenever they
perceive a potential threat to
their security. Far too often,
they have never given mean
ingful diplomacy a chance.
Yet from Israel's standpoint
the time for diplomacy has nev
er been better. Because Israel
still possesses regional military
superiority, it now has a kind of
political leverage that it may

not have in the future. And, as
the peace treaty with Egypt
demonstrates, political security
is an indispensable prerequisite
for military security in the
Middle East.
Clearly, the latest incident
was more complicated than
most. Iraq's claims of "peace
ful intentions" for its 40-mega
watt were at best dubious.
However, the same thing
holds true for many other coun
tries: Pakistan, Libya, Argen
tina, Brazil, South Korea and
South Africa. Israel itself is sus
pected of having already ac-

quired one or more nuclear
weapons. Are we to bomb the
nuclear facilities in each of
these countries as well? Is that
the kind of non-proliferation pol
icy we want to have?
A sounder course of action
would be to strengthen the non
proliferation regime that now
exists, including tighter export
controls and more rigid safe
guards. Iraq, unlike Israel, has
ratified the 1968 Non-Prolifera
tion Treaty, which requires the
Iraqis to submit their nuclear
facilities to full-scope safe

guards. It is very likely that this
international system of inspec
tions and safeguards, even in its
present state, would have been
able to detect any attempted di
versions of uranium for weap
ons purposes. Had such diver
sions actually occurred, ap
propriate measures could have
been taken at that time.
Furthermore, Israel failed to
pursue an indirect diplomatic
solution with France. There is
reason to believe that the new
Mitterrand government might
have cut off. or at least reduced,
French nuclear assistance to

Iraq.
Finally, and most fundamen
tally, we must recognize that
nuclear proliferation is. by its
nature, a political and not a
technical problem. So long as
underlying Arab-Israeli ten
sions induce Iraq and other Arab
countries to obtain nuclear
weapons, Israel will have only
delayed the inevitable. This il
lustrates why the Israelis must
greatly increase their efforts —
including a more realistic ap
proach to the Palestinian issue
— to achieve a comprehensive

peace settlement. The recent
air strike will only hamper
these efforts.
The timing of the raid is
somewhat of a mystery. Begin
has asserted that it was neces
sary to bomb the reactor before
it became operational — which
he claims would have been this
July — in order to avoid spread
ing radioactive fallout over
Baghdad. Many experts, how
ever, disagree with Begin.
It may be that the upcoming
Israeli elections played some
role in the decision to move now.
Although it is unlikely that elec
toral politics were a central fac
tor in the timing of the raid, it is
clear the Begin was aware of the
domestic political benefits that
would accrue from such an op
eration.
In any event, the air strike
has created an unpleasant prob
lem for the United States. The
United States has had, and will
continue to have, a crucial stake
both in the survival of Israel and
in helping to bring a just and
lasting peace to the Middle
East. It is imperative, there
fore. for the U.S. government to
do everything possible to pre
vent Israel from taking any
further actions that would be
contrary to its own long-term in
terests and inimical to the pros
pects for peace.

would be to strengthen the non
proliferation regime that now
exists, including tighter export
controls and more rigid safe
guards. Iraq, unlike Israel, has
ratified the 1968 Non-Prolifera
tion Treaty, which requires the
Iraqis to submit their nuclear
facilities to full-scope safe

guards. It is very likely that this
international system of inspec
tions and safeguards, even in its
present state, would have been
able to detect any attempted di
versions of uranium for weap
ons purposes. Had such diver
sions actually occurred, ap
propriate measures could have
been taken at that time.
Furthermore, Israel failed to
pursue an indirect diplomatic
solution with France. There is
reason to believe that the new
Mitterrand government might
have cut off. or at least reduced,
French nuclear assistance to

Iraq.
Finally, and most fundamen
tally, we must recognize that
nuclear proliferation is. by its
nature, a political and not a
technical problem. So long as
underlying Arab-Israeli ten
sions induce Iraq and other Arab
countries to obtain nuclear
weapons, Israel will have only
delayed the inevitable. This il
lustrates why the Israelis must
greatly increase their efforts —
including a more realistic ap
proach to the Palestinian issue
— to achieve a comprehensive

peace settlement. The recent
air strike will only hamper
these efforts.
The timing of the raid is
somewhat of a mystery. Begin
has asserted that it was neces
sary to bomb the reactor before
it became operational — which
he claims would have been this
July — in order to avoid spread
ing radioactive fallout over
Baghdad. Many experts, how
ever, disagree with Begin.
It may be that the upcoming
Israeli elections played some
role in the decision to move now.
Although it is unlikely that elec
toral politics were a central fac
tor in the timing of the raid, it is
clear the Begin was aware of the
domestic political benefits that
would accrue from such an op
eration.
In any event, the air strike
has created an unpleasant prob
lem for the United States. The
United States has had, and will
continue to have, a crucial stake
both in the survival of Israel and
in helping to bring a just and
lasting peace to the Middle
East. It is imperative, there
fore. for the U.S. government to
do everything possible to pre
vent Israel from taking any
further actions that would be
contrary to its own long-term in
terests and inimical to the pros
pects for peace.

For the past 33 years, the
United States and Israel have
enjoyed a special relationship.
Israel is our strongest ally in the
Middle East, and it is also the
only true democracy in that re
gion. But in recent months the
Israelis have taken a number of
actions that have made it more
and more difficult for the Unit
ed States to maintain its his
torically close relationship with
Israel.
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's policy of expanded set
tlements in the occupied territo
ries, his declaration that Jeru
salem is the official capital of
Israel, and his expulsion of Arab
mayors for the West Bank have
all heightened tensions in the
Middle East, while producing no
appreciable benefits for Israel's
security.
The Israeli strike on Iraq's
nuclear reactor can only en
hance the role of violence in the
region. The attack threatens to
undermine the fragile peace
that has prevailed during the
Syrian missile crisis.
Taking advantage of its tem
porary military superiority, Is
rael was able to carry out the
bombing without fear of retalia
tion or direct reprisal. But how
long can such a situation last?
Even with continued U.S. as
sistance, the Israelis will in
evitably find themselves one
day in a situation in which they
can no longer execute military

operations with impunity. And
when that day arrives, the Is
raelis may wish they had given
greater emphasis to political,
rather than military, solutions
to their problems.
This is not to suggest that Is
rael is the only source of in
stability in the region. Syria and
Iraq have been implacably
hostile toward Israel, Libya
continues to ferment terrorism
and unrest, and Jordan has re
fused to join in the peace proc
ess. Moreover, intra-Arab dis
putes and other conflicts, such
as Iraq's aggression against

OPINIONS

Iran and Libya's invasion of
Chad, would remain even if Is
rael ceased to exist.
Nevertheless, it is the Israelis
who have constantly resorted to
the use of force whenever they
perceive a potential threat to
their security. Far too often,
they have never given mean
ingful diplomacy a chance.
Yet from Israel's standpoint
the time for diplomacy has nev
er been better. Because Israel
still possesses regional military
superiority, it now has a kind of
political leverage that it may

not have in the future. And, as
the peace treaty with Egypt
demonstrates, political security
is an indispensable prerequisite
for military security in the
Middle East.
Clearly, the latest incident
was more complicated than
most. Iraq's claims of "peace
ful intentions" for its 40-mega
watt were at best dubious.
However, the same thing
holds true for many other coun
tries: Pakistan, Libya, Argen
tina, Brazil, South Korea and
South Africa. Israel itself is sus
pected of having already ac-

quired one or more nuclear
weapons. Are we to bomb the
nuclear facilities in each of
these countries as well? Is that
the kind of non-proliferation pol
icy we want to have?
