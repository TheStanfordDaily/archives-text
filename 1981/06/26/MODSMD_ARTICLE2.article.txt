The search is still on for a
University sophomore who has
been missing for more than sev
en months. The latest develop
ment is the posting of a $10,000
reward for his safe return.
John Jacob Klein, also known
as King Brett Lauter, was last
seen in early December, 1980,
and according to Sgt. Mike
Dowe of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Department, there
have been no substantial clues
or leads to his whereabouts.
"We have an open case," he
said.
Recently, notices offering a
$10,000 reward for information
leading to the safe return of
Klein have been put up around
the Stanford Post Office. The
posters describe the missing
student and include a request to
contact Klein's mother,

Charlote Lauter of Chicago.
According to Chris
Wullschleger, records secre
tary of the Stanford Police Ser
vices, Klein's bike was dis
covered outside the Bank of
America in the Stanford Shop
ping Center last December.
"There is nothing to indicate
foul play," she said, adding that
Klein's father was the first to
contact the Stanford police.
San Mateo County sheriff's
deputies have talked to more
than 40 people who Klein's
mother had suggested as close
ties, said Dowe. But Klein ap
parently had no close friend
ships.
Mrs. Lauter urges anyone
with information regarding her
son's whereabouts to call her in
Chicago at (312 ) 329-9522.

four occasions during the past two weeks.
