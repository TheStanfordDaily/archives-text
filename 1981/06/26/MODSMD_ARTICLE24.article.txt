# Year-round selling in White Plaza
## 
### Karen Springen 
Can you imagine White Plaza
without vendors? What would
you do if you had to go all the
way to the shopping center to
buy a flower?
According to Larry Davidson,
assistant director of Tresidder
in charge of White Plaza, the
vendors have been selling non
commercial items there for
more than 10 years. Vendors
basically govern themselves.
"They are not scheduled," said
Davidson. But if an event, such
as Harvest or the Spring Faire,
iis scheduled, Tresidder in
forms the vendors that they can
not set up that day.
David Anderson, who makes
and sells hand-made jewelry
with his wife, said. "It's a pretty
easy-going situation as long as
no one takes advantage of it."
He has sold his crafts in White
Plaza for about four years. They
set up their table about two or
three times a week.
"We needed a place to pres
ent what we had to sell," he
said Stanford afforded the op
portunity. The Andersons make
14-karat gold, sterling silver
and brass jewelry in their work
shop at home.
Restrictions
According to Anderson, the
University's major stipulation
is that items should be hand
made, not commercial. And
they not compete with
products sold in the Bookstore,
the Store or Tresidder Union.
Because of this requirement,
food is not sold < except, for the
fruit outside of the Dookstore).
Vendors cannot set up opera
tion on the grass in the middle of
the Plaza or in any way which
would obstruct the path of fire
trucks.
Anderson cited a sense of
community among the vendors

"It's very easy-going." He
added. "We kind of police
ourselves." He said the vendors
have a "running gripe with the
ones who try to sell commercial
items."
He emphasized that few ven
dors. with the exception of the
fruit and flower stand opera
tors, sell five days a week.
"There are a lot of times I don't
come out because it's slow,"
said Anderson. Most people
keep their tables set up from
about 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Lunch
time is generally busiest.
Saies
Vendors claim business is dif
ficult to predict. "A lot of times
it depends on weather," said
Anderson. It also depends on the

time — unsurprisingly, fewer
students stop and browse during
dead week and finals. But he
added that the University is a
year-round place.
Number of vendors
No specific number of tables
per day or week exists since
vendors set their own days and
hours. And these are highly flex
ible although most have days
they usually sell their wares
During the summer, business
also slacks off and fewer crafts
people venture from their
homes to Stanford.
According to Lindy Kurle.
who sews and sells dance and
active wear, an average of five
to 15 vendors set up during the
year. She emphasized, however.

that the number varies con
siderably.
Kurle has been coming to
White Plaza about once a week
— usually on Mondays or
Thursdays — for 10 years. She
has changed her merchandise
along with the mood of cus
tomers who generally are in
terested in "whatever is in
vogue." she said Ten years ago,
people liked leather crafts, she
said. "They are more into casu
al now."
Like most of the others. Kurle
sells her hand-made products in
White Plaza for wholesale
prices. In addition, she manu
factures for shops which mark
up the price. For example, she
sells cotton spandex dancing

tights and spring shirts for $12.
She also makes bathing suits
from the fabric.
Kurle began making the
leotards last August. She said
Julie Weston, who helped
choreograph and costume for
West Side Story. suggested the
idea.
Atmosphere
Although some students
might not agree with their
assessment, both Anderson and
Kurle cited the "relaxed" at
mosphere here. "It's a great
place to be." said Anderson.
"For us it's a way of life," he
added.
Anderson said it is rare for a
school to even allow this type of
operation.
