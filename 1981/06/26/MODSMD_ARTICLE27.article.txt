THE GOOD EARTH
185 University Avenue Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth on University
Avenue provides a unique varie
ty of natural food dishes served
in a comfortable dining at
mosphere.
The restaurant's use of only
choice ingredients has not lim
ited its selection of meals, but
on the contrary has opened up a
creative array of dishes — ev
erything from omelettes to
tostadas; and from salads to
shakes.
Hot and cold sandwiches,
soups, salads, and meat, vegeta
ble, shrimp and chicken en

trees, are among the menu
selections for lunch and dinner.
In addition, six types of fruit and
yogurt shakes, daily baked
pastries and assorted desserts
are available to those with a
sweet tooth.
Green ferns hang lazily over
the tables against a background
of wood panelled walls, creating
a relaxed and easy-going at
mosphere.
The prices appear to be some
what reasonable with possible
exceptions in the entree section.
Prices run about $3 to $4 for
sandwiches, $3 to $5 for salads,
and $5 to $7 for entrees.
LE POT
AU FEU 1149 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park 322-4343
Le Pot au Feu provides what
one would imagine France has
to offer — if one hadn't been
there. But, this is by no means
an insult. The decor could be de
scribed as "Late Eclectic" or
mavbe even "Friendlv Clutter"

due to its variety, but it is not ov
erdone. I found the ambience
very friendly and easy-going.
As for the food, it is definitely
French. Ranging from its rich,
tasty pea soup, to its light, per
fectly prepared salmon en
croute, or Beef Wellington. The
chef has specials every day
which are well worth trying.
The accessories are also very
good. The salad, although
simple, has a wonderfully nutty
flavored dressing. And pastries
are light and tasty.
The service is by no means
Gallic, but it does adopt the best
points of California friend
liness, while still remaining
quite professional.
Prices hover around $35 to $40
a couple, including wine, and
that is most definitely money
well spent.
RAMONA'S
541 Ramona St. Palo Alto
326-2220
Few people question the fact
that Ramona's makes some of
the best pizza near campus. It
offers pizzas in an amazing
number of varieties, all of which
are smothered in a generous
amount of cheese and the de
sired toppings. Having eaten
there many times I can't re
member having a pizza that was

less than very good (that is true
for the Calzone, whole wheat
crust filled with a delicious
combination of mozzarella
cheese, tomato sauce, linguica,
Italian sausage, mushrooms
and onions, as well).
Prices run from about $3.50
for a small pizza with tomato
and cheese, to about $12 for a
fully loaded 16 incher. The por
tions at these prices represent
excellent value.
This restaurant's problems
lie in its popularity. There is
almost always a 20 to 30 minute
wait, and never enough room to
sit down while waiting. The at
mosphere is jovial, though, and
one almost always runs into at
least a couple of friends. My
greatest complaint lies in the
service: half of the time it's
slow, the other half it verges on
the non-existent.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGOLI
AN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cuisine.

Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was intoduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the "
Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars)
are in for a new treat — an en
tire bar!
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegeta
bles, including shredded car
rots, onions, celery, cabbage,
bean sprouts and cilantro, are
next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot, and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and casu
al, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one
spoke English very well. Col.
Lee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
trulv unusual.

COLONEL LEE'S MONGOLI
AN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cuisine.

Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was intoduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the "
Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars)
are in for a new treat — an en
tire bar!
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegeta
bles, including shredded car
rots, onions, celery, cabbage,
bean sprouts and cilantro, are
next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot, and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and casu
al, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one
spoke English very well. Col.
Lee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
trulv unusual.

THE GOOD EARTH
185 University Avenue Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth on University
Avenue provides a unique varie
ty of natural food dishes served
in a comfortable dining at
mosphere.
The restaurant's use of only
choice ingredients has not lim
ited its selection of meals, but
on the contrary has opened up a
creative array of dishes — ev
erything from omelettes to
tostadas; and from salads to
shakes.
Hot and cold sandwiches,
soups, salads, and meat, vegeta
ble, shrimp and chicken en

trees, are among the menu
selections for lunch and dinner.
In addition, six types of fruit and
yogurt shakes, daily baked
pastries and assorted desserts
are available to those with a
sweet tooth.
Green ferns hang lazily over
the tables against a background
of wood panelled walls, creating
a relaxed and easy-going at
mosphere.
The prices appear to be some
what reasonable with possible
exceptions in the entree section.
Prices run about $3 to $4 for
sandwiches, $3 to $5 for salads,
and $5 to $7 for entrees.
LE POT
AU FEU 1149 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park 322-4343
Le Pot au Feu provides what
one would imagine France has
to offer — if one hadn't been
there. But, this is by no means
an insult. The decor could be de
scribed as "Late Eclectic" or
mavbe even "Friendlv Clutter"

due to its variety, but it is not ov
erdone. I found the ambience
very friendly and easy-going.
As for the food, it is definitely
French. Ranging from its rich,
tasty pea soup, to its light, per
fectly prepared salmon en
croute, or Beef Wellington. The
chef has specials every day
which are well worth trying.
The accessories are also very
good. The salad, although
simple, has a wonderfully nutty
flavored dressing. And pastries
are light and tasty.
The service is by no means
Gallic, but it does adopt the best
points of California friend
liness, while still remaining
quite professional.
Prices hover around $35 to $40
a couple, including wine, and
that is most definitely money
well spent.
RAMONA'S
541 Ramona St. Palo Alto
326-2220
Few people question the fact
that Ramona's makes some of
the best pizza near campus. It
offers pizzas in an amazing
number of varieties, all of which
are smothered in a generous
amount of cheese and the de
sired toppings. Having eaten
there many times I can't re
member having a pizza that was

less than very good (that is true
for the Calzone, whole wheat
crust filled with a delicious
combination of mozzarella
cheese, tomato sauce, linguica,
Italian sausage, mushrooms
and onions, as well).
Prices run from about $3.50
for a small pizza with tomato
and cheese, to about $12 for a
fully loaded 16 incher. The por
tions at these prices represent
excellent value.
This restaurant's problems
lie in its popularity. There is
almost always a 20 to 30 minute
wait, and never enough room to
sit down while waiting. The at
mosphere is jovial, though, and
one almost always runs into at
least a couple of friends. My
greatest complaint lies in the
service: half of the time it's
slow, the other half it verges on
the non-existent.
