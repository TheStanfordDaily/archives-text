## New Orleans jazz on 4th of July 
### Jiri Weiss 
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band will make its 15th annual
Stanford appearance at the
Lively Art's all American picnic
and concert in Frost Am
phitheater on July 4.
The celebration, as in past
years, is a family-style picnic
with an afternoon of old-fash
ioned games.
The band plays tradition New
Orleans Jazz — or "Jass," as it
was called — music that has not
changed much since the 20's.
But surprisingly their music,
which for most of us belongs to
old scratchy 78's, is alive and
very much appreciated here, so
much so that the band has be
come a Stanford tradition.
,When I went to hear the
band's concert last year at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium the au
dience clapped to the rhythm as
the band filled the hall with this
warm and unpretentious music
that traces its origins to turn-of
the-century saloons and street
parades.
It is enough to see the beat-up
tuba and worn piano and drums
that are yello ,r * from age to set
the mood for a New Orleans jazz
experience.
The atmosphere is very relax
ed. When you see the band enter
the stage playing one by one,
you think of your grandfather
and old movies, but a few
minutes convince you that jazz
has ageless vitality. Most of the
players are over 60 but when
they are at their instruments, it
is impossible to tell their age.

trumpet, his white socks draw
ing attention, stomps the
rhythm with his foot and they
are off. The trumpet leads and
each instrument in turn has its
solo, except the tuba which
keeps the rhythm jumping.
There is Willie Humphrey Jr.,
Percy's brother, on clarinet,
Narvin Kimball on banjo,
Joseph "Cie" Frazier on drums,
Frank Demond on trombone and
James "Sing" Miller on piano.
The band ended their per
formance as they do every year
with their final, "When the
Saints Go Marching In." They

got off the stage and marched
around motioning the audience
to follow them around the
auditorium. The audience gave
them a standing ovation.
All of the players are veter
ans of New Orleans Jazz. "A
player in his 40s is considered
young," said David Jaffe, who
doubles up as both the manager
of Preservation Hall and the
tuba players.
All of the musicians in The
Preservation Hall Jazz Band
have music in their blood.
Percy Humphrey comes from
a family of music teachers and
performers. He also owned his
own orchestra in the '20s. He is
self-assured.
"Cie" Frazier has an inno
cent look in his eyes until his
turn comes to play.
Frank Demond claims it took
him ten seconds to drop his suc
cessful architectural career in
Newport Beach to join the band
full time.
Narvin Kimball has music in
his family too. His father, Hen
ry, was one of the all-time great
New Orleans bass players.
Before he was twelve, Marvin
made something that resembled
a ukulele out of a cigar box. At
fifteen his father bought him a
banjo. Marvin likes to show off,
and he has something to show.
What you end up admiring
most is the great sense of show
manship that each player has
built up over the years. Each
plays with the audience and
knows how to keep their in
terest. This includes winking,
pointing, grinning and even
making an occasional comment
to the audience during the per
formance.
After each solo the audience
applauds enthusiastically, mak
ing for many worn-out hands at
the end of the performance.
The concert lasted well over
two hours. "As long as my lips
hold up it's all right," Percy
Humphrey explained. He still
loves the music, even though it
has not changed much since he
started playing nearly 60 years
ago.

"Sing" Miller got his first job
at sixteen as a banjo player and
taught himself piano. He has a
soft singing voice. Each mem
ber's individual character
shows through, but the team
work of the group is admirable.
The man responsible for
keeping New Orleans Jazz alive
is David Jaffe. As a young jazz
buff he took over the newly
opened Preservation Hall in
New Orleans, and since 1961 the
hall has closed for only one night
a year with performances by
new bands interspersed with
those of the regular performers.
New musicians are constant
ly being trained, so jazz can
probably look forward to a long
and fruitful life.
The Hall spends about half
their time on the road, they have

played in all 50 states and just
arrived from Hawaii for their
performances here. Later this
year they will venture across
the seas for a three-week en
gagement in Paris, which is al
ready sold out.
The University has been a

stopover for the band every
summer since the mid-60s. "We
have played more concerts here
than any place outside of New
Orleans," Jaffe said. He at
tributes the Hall's reputation to
their record of sold-out per
formances here.

a ukulele out of a cigar box. At
fifteen his father bought him a
banjo. Marvin likes to show off,
and he has something to show.
"Sing" Miller got his first job
at sixteen as a banjo player and
taught himself piano. He has a
soft singing voice. Each mem
ber's individual character
shows through, but the team
work of the group is admirable.
The man responsible for
keeping New Orleans Jazz alive
is David Jaffe. As a young jazz
buff he took over the newly
opened Preservation Hall in
New Orleans, and since 1961 the
hall has closed for only one night
a year with performances by
new bands interspersed with
those of the regular performers.
New musicians are constant
ly being trained, so jazz can
probably look forward to a long
and fruitful life.
The Hall spends about half
their time on the road, they have

played in all 50 states and just
arrived from Hawaii for their
performances here. Later this
year they will venture across
the seas for a three-week en
gagement in Paris, which is al
ready sold out.
The University has been a

stopover for the band every
summer since the mid-60s. "We
have played more concerts here
than any place outside of New
Orleans," Jaffe said. He at
tributes the Hall's reputation to
their record of sold-out per
formances here.

The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band will make its 15th annual
Stanford appearance at the
Lively Art's all American picnic
and concert in Frost Am
phitheater on July 4.
The celebration, as in past
years, is a family-style picnic
with an afternoon of old-fash
ioned games.
The band plays tradition New
Orleans Jazz — or "Jass," as it
was called — music that has not
changed much since the 20's.
But surprisingly their music,
which for most of us belongs to
old scratchy 78's, is alive and
very much appreciated here, so
much so that the band has be
come a Stanford tradition.
,When I went to hear the
band's concert last year at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium the au
dience clapped to the rhythm as
the band filled the hall with this
warm and unpretentious music
that traces its origins to turn-of
the-century saloons and street
parades.
It is enough to see the beat-up
tuba and worn piano and drums
that are yello ,r * from age to set
the mood for a New Orleans jazz
experience.
The atmosphere is very relax
ed. When you see the band enter
the stage playing one by one,
you think of your grandfather
and old movies, but a few
minutes convince you that jazz
has ageless vitality. Most of the
players are over 60 but when
they are at their instruments, it
is impossible to tell their age.

rhythm with his foot and they

each instrument in turn has its
solo, except the tuba which
keeps the rhythm jumping.
There is Willie Humphrey Jr.,
Percy's brother, on clarinet,
Narvin Kimball on banjo,
Joseph "Cie" Frazier on drums,
Frank Demond on trombone and
James "Sing" Miller on piano.
The band ended their per
formance as they do every year
with their final, "When the
Saints Go Marching In." They

got off the stage and marched
around motioning the audience
to follow them around the
auditorium. The audience gave
them a standing ovation.
All of the players are veter
ans of New Orleans Jazz. "A
player in his 40s is considered
young," said David Jaffe, who
doubles up as both the manager
of Preservation Hall and the
tuba players.
All of the musicians in The
Preservation Hall Jazz Band
have music in their blood.
Percy Humphrey comes from
a family of music teachers and
performers. He also owned his
own orchestra in the '20s. He is
self-assured.
"Cie" Frazier has an inno
cent look in his eyes until his
turn comes to play.
Frank Demond claims it took
him ten seconds to drop his suc
cessful architectural career in
Newport Beach to join the band
full time.
Narvin Kimball has music in
his family too. His father, Hen
ry, was one of the all-time great
New Orleans bass players.
Before he was twelve, Marvin
made something that resembled
a ukulele out of a cigar box. At
fifteen his father bought him a
banjo. Marvin likes to show off,
and he has something to show.
What you end up admiring
most is the great sense of show
manship that each player has
built up over the years. Each
plays with the audience and
knows how to keep their in
terest. This includes winking,
pointing, grinning and even
making an occasional comment
to the audience during the per
formance.
After each solo the audience
applauds enthusiastically, mak
ing for many worn-out hands at
the end of the performance.
The concert lasted well over
two hours. "As long as my lips
hold up it's all right," Percy
Humphrey explained. He still
loves the music, even though it
has not changed much since he
started playing nearly 60 years
ago.
