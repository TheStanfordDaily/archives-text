# Boys' Town reacts sharply to cuts
## 
### Carl Johnston 
Faced with the loss of its pri
mary source of funds, the Stan
ford Boys' Town Center's soci
ological research programs will
be drastically cut back this sum
mer ; only 16 percent of the pro
fframß oriffinally scheduled will
be implemented.
Of the 22 programs planned,
the Center can afford to fund
only four or five of them, ac
cording to Joyce Sanders, an ad
ministrative assistant at the
Center. Twenty-five faculty
members will lose their Boys'
Town salaries this summer and
22 graduate students will not re
ceive stipends. Office support
staff has also been severely cut,
forcing secretaries and admin
istrators to seek jobs in other
departments of the University.
Sanders, who received a two
month lay-off notice herself last
May, said however, "I don't feel
shafted by the University, but
both the University and I feel
shafted by Boys' Town."
No final decisions or specific
plans have been announced as
yet on how to acquire funding
for the Center for the coming ac
ademic year.
Stanford Boys' Town Center
was cut off from its source of

funding last December when
Father Flanagan's Boys' Home
of Nebraska refused to honor its
25-year contract with the Uni
versity to fund research on the
of deprivation on the life
chances of children. Income
from t/ie JESojyfli ' FTomr jamoiintmi
to $640,000 last year. The Stan
ford Center has not received any
money from the Boys' Home
since January.
Currently the matter is tied
up in a complicated legal battle
between Stanford and the Ne
braska-based charitable foun
dation for abused or wayward
children.
On March 16, the University
filed suit against Boys' Town,
claiming that the multi-million
dollar contract Boys' Home
signed with the University was
"valid, binding and en
forceable." However, in May,
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court ruled that the case should
not be heard in California. Uni
versity Counsel John Schwartz
then filed suit again, this time in
Omaha, Nebraska, where the
Boys' Home is headquartered.
The Boys' Home has until Mon
day to respond to the charges.
After that, it may take between
seven and nine months for the

case to make its way into the
courtroom, according to
Rodney Johnson, legal counsel
for the University.
Until Stanford's case is de
cidcd, however, Boys' Town
Center will have to cut back on
its* m im trait /<n<f
seek other funding sources.
"We're disappointed at the
slow progress of the case," said
Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, assistant director of
the Center.
This June the University
drew on emergency resources
to give the Center $175,000 —
enough to make it through the
end of the school year, ex
plained Vice President of Man
agement and Budget Ray Bac
chetti.
Now that the school year is
over, however, Boys' Town is
beginning to experience severe
difficulties.
Some cuts include studies
on sleep patterns in infants, on
stress among adolescents and
also research on youth, work
and schooling.
A study conducted by Psy
chology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
on the impact of cult religions
on young people will also be cut.
However, a four-year study
on the effects foster homes have
on adjudicated abused and neg
lected children will not be
curtailed at all. according to the
program head, Law School
Prof. Michael Wald. This pro
gram has received enough mon
ey from the Edna McConnel
Clark and Walter Johnson Foun
dations to finish their research,
which is currently in the third
year of a four-year study.
"Three years of work would
have been washed up if we
didn't do the fourth year," said
Wald. Wald noted that the foster
homes study is the single largest
program at Boys' Town Center.
Dornbusch noted that top
priority for funding is being giv
en to ongoing research projects.
"Everyone (meaning Univer
sity Controller Kenneth
Creighton and Center Director
Psychology Prof. J. Merril
Carlsmith, Dornbusch ex
plained) is united in trying to
work out things as best we can to
reduce the impact of the cut
backs."

plans have been announced as
yet on how to acquire funding
for the Center for the coming ac
ademic year.
Stanford Boys' Town Center
was cut off from its source of

funding last December when
Father Flanagan's Boys' Home
of Nebraska refused to honor its
25-year contract with the Uni
versity to fund research on the
of deprivation on the life
chances of children. Income
from t/ie JESojyfli ' FTomr jamoiintmi
to $640,000 last year. The Stan
ford Center has not received any
money from the Boys' Home
since January.
Currently the matter is tied
up in a complicated legal battle
between Stanford and the Ne
braska-based charitable foun
dation for abused or wayward
children.
On March 16, the University
filed suit against Boys' Town,
claiming that the multi-million
dollar contract Boys' Home
signed with the University was
"valid, binding and en
forceable." However, in May,
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court ruled that the case should
not be heard in California. Uni
versity Counsel John Schwartz
then filed suit again, this time in
Omaha, Nebraska, where the
Boys' Home is headquartered.
The Boys' Home has until Mon
day to respond to the charges.
After that, it may take between
seven and nine months for the

case to make its way into the
courtroom, according to
Rodney Johnson, legal counsel
for the University.
Until Stanford's case is de
cidcd, however, Boys' Town
Center will have to cut back on
its* m im trait /<n<f
seek other funding sources.
"We're disappointed at the
slow progress of the case," said
Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, assistant director of
the Center.
This June the University
drew on emergency resources
to give the Center $175,000 —
enough to make it through the
end of the school year, ex
plained Vice President of Man
agement and Budget Ray Bac
chetti.
Now that the school year is
over, however, Boys' Town is
beginning to experience severe
difficulties.
Some cuts include studies
on sleep patterns in infants, on
stress among adolescents and
also research on youth, work
and schooling.
A study conducted by Psy
chology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
on the impact of cult religions
on young people will also be cut.
However, a four-year study
on the effects foster homes have
on adjudicated abused and neg
lected children will not be
curtailed at all. according to the
program head, Law School
Prof. Michael Wald. This pro
gram has received enough mon
ey from the Edna McConnel
Clark and Walter Johnson Foun
dations to finish their research,
which is currently in the third
year of a four-year study.
"Three years of work would
have been washed up if we
didn't do the fourth year," said
Wald. Wald noted that the foster
homes study is the single largest
program at Boys' Town Center.
Dornbusch noted that top
priority for funding is being giv
en to ongoing research projects.
"Everyone (meaning Univer
sity Controller Kenneth
Creighton and Center Director
Psychology Prof. J. Merril
Carlsmith, Dornbusch ex
plained) is united in trying to
work out things as best we can to
reduce the impact of the cut
backs."
