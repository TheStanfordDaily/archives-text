San Francisco Stories, (Vol. I, No. II)
George Matchette, Robert Monson & Charles
Rubin, eds.
103 pp. $3.25
By Gail Edmonson Schares
Although its title suggests otherwise, this col
lection of short fiction is not limited to stories
about San Francisco. The title refers, instead, to
stories written by nine Bay Area writers.
According to its editors, the goal of this series
of books is to print the best of previously un
published short fiction by local authors. If the sec
ond issue is representative of the series, the edi
tors are well on their way to accomplishing that
goal.
The range and style of work assembled in San
Francisco Stories varies widely but the quality of
writing and literary technique are uniformly high.
Two of the authors who published stories in the
second issue, David Mac Donald and Thomas
Trebitsch Parker, have taught fiction-writing and
freshman English at Stanford. One contriubtor,
Ethan Canin, is an undergraduate at Stanford.
Charlotte Painter's "Home Movie" humor
ously depicts the "perfect" Los Angeles rela
tionship. Her characters include John Everhart, a
psychiatrist with a fettish for home movies, and
voluptuous Gina, a Body Confrontation Therapist.
The perfect seduction, the perfect marriage,

and the perfect birth of their child are all subjects
of John's Super (movie camera and Painter's
skillful ridicule.) In the end, it is the ever-present
movie camera that saves the "perfect" marriage
from divorce.
David Mac Donald's "Wake," set in Nova Sco
tia, is a deep and moving tale about two brothers.
When Graham, the older brother left home as a
young man, he took with him a cherished memory
of his brother Rory â€” "a boy of 15 with thick curly
hair, strong and brash for that age, moody and
loyal . . . Rory had promise." Graham returns
home 17 years later to a different reality and the
loss of his vision of promise.
"The Social Fabric," by Thomas Parker, is a
story about human nature told through the eyes of
a laundromat. Parker uses the character of Mr.
Peterson, a regular customer at Adanac laun
dromat for 18 years, to weave his tale.
Parker's writing must be skillful; one is in
evitably charmed by the shiftless Mr. Peterson,
who admits himself to be "less than a roaring suc
cess."
San Francisco Stories provides the reader with
a balance of both light-hearted and more re
flective stories well-suited to summer reading.
For those especially interested in short fiction
and new writers, the book is a provocative forum
for new material.
