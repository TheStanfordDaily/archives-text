For those newcomers who
may need an idea of where to eat
and for those oldtimers who
may need to refresh their mem
ories, here is a collection of con
densed reviews based largely on
full critiques that have ap
peared in the Daily.
The following are restaurants
that have met strict standards
of excellence in the eyes and on
the tongues of our reviewers
who took into account not only
food, but presentation, service
ana ambience as well. Prices
are oniy approximate, and are
included only as a rough guide.
LA TOUR
University Avenue Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor ot a rather
out-of-place looking buiiding on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Many claim that it is the
best restaurant on the Peninsu
la. and they are probably right.
Service is formal yet good-na
tured and not oppressive: atten
tive without fawning, and per
fectly complements the delica
cy of the food.
As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques
aux pintes d'asperges, ( mousse
of scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus spears — $6.50) and
(juilette d'huitres au Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are

offered. Noisete d'Agneau au
Porto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $13.75) was truly exceptional.
Elegant French-style beans and
a nicely broiled tomato give a
colorful and textural balance to
the presentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of des
serts includes hot or cold Souf
fle au Grand Marnier, straw
berries. hot apple tart, mousse
au chocolat and selected
cheeses.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices and
great atmospftere more lhan
compensate Entrees are priced
between $6 and $11 and come
with a choice of homemade soup
or house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, consisted of two
large pieces of sole resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and cov
ered with a light wine sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character

of the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere between
a French country inn and an ex
clusive British club. You can re
lax in a pampered world of
starched linen, fresh flowers,
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is. but
it's the ambience, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandivavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($12.50 for
two: $6.50 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
A wide variery of excellent
deserts are also available.
MADDALENA'S CONTINEN
TAL
544 Emerson Palo Alto 326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, devoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any French or Ital
iangourmet, or anyone else for
that matter!
Maddalena's offers a con
tinental menu; pasta is seved
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex

cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unususual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguini alia Vongole.
Maddalena's a la carte salads
such as spinach ($5.50),
mushroom ($5), Caesar ($5.50
for two) and Butter Lettuce
with Seafood ($4.95) are ex
cellent.
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole Flor
entine with Shrimp ($10.50) to
Chicken A 1 Forno Arturo
($8.25).
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully

painted screens and chan
deliers. It was a very aesthetic
experience.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road Los Altos
948-2696
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisines, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the Mu
Shu pork, which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at
most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied, with more than 150 a la
carte items for lunch and din
ner; one can't go wrong with
any of their "specialities." And
if there's a dish not on the menu,
Chu will prepare it specially if
