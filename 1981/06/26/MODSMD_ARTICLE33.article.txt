Brown appoints high court justice
San Francisco — Allen Broussard, presiding judge of
the Alameda County Superior Court, was nominated
yesterday by Gov. Edmund Brown as the second black

old Broussard in a news conference at the governor's
San Francisco office.
Broussard, a former law associate of Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson, enjoys a "wide measure of respect
in...the law enforcement community, the defense bar
and among judges," Brown told reporters.
The governor refused to give specifics of the selec

some respects a very close judgment."
Reagan happy with surprise victory
Los Angeles — An exuberant President Ronald Rea
gan applauded Republican congressmen and "31
courageous members of the Democratic Party" yes
terday for delivering an unexpected procedural victory
on his package of spending cuts.
"Twenty-four hours ago our defeat seemed almost
certain," the delighted president told about 1.500 mem
bers of the California Taxpayers Association.
"The simple truth is that Congress heard the voice of
the people and they acted to carry out the will of the
people."
House passage of Reagan's austerity budget was vir
tually assured when the House rejected, by 217-210, an
attempt by Democratic leaders to split the budget cut
package into several parts.
Reagan, who said he had planned to use the forum to
issue a "real stern message about the games that were
being played in Washington," instead found himself
"extremely pleased and gratified" by the House ac
tion He said, "I have never felt better in these last five
months."
The president, who had taken personal command of
an intense, last-minute lobbying campaign that carried
the day in the House, urged Congress to "move quickly

now to put our spending cuts to a vote. Certainly there's
no reason to delay" beyond July 4, he said.
Reagan also praised the Senate Finance Committee
for voting 19-1 to endorse tax cuts "that are virtually
identical to those I embraced earlier this year."
Deputy White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes
said that it was during a telephone conversation with
Sen. Robert Dole, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, that Reagan learned of his victory in the
House. Before his midday speech to the taxpayers
group, the president telephoned the Republican leader
ship to extend his congratulations.
