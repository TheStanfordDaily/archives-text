## 
### 
Robert Sheeran, a 22-year-old graduating senior,
drowned in DeGuerre Pool late in the evening of Com
mencement Day, following the unauthorized entry of a
group of students into the complex.
Sheeran apparently lost consciousness while swim
ming and sunk to the bottom of the pool where he was
found by his four companions.
Capt. William Wullschleger of Stanford Police Ser
vices reports that the students dialed the 911 dispatch
number after discovering Sheeran about 10:30 p.m. on
June 14.
Two students who knew CPR attempted to revive
Sheeran, but were unsuccessful, as was a team of para
medics who arrived shortly after receiving the call.
The paramedics brought Sheeran to the Stanford hos
pital where he died at 12:06 a.m. Monday, according to
the Santa Clara County coroner's office.
The pool had closed at 5 p.m. on Sunday. According to
Wullschleger, the lifeguard then took the key to Theta
Xi, the fraternity house where Sheeran lived. Ap
parently the students used this key to gain access to the
25-meter pool during the unauthorized time.
