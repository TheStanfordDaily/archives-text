# Math library suffers closings during heat

### J. Greene 
Temperatures as high as 96
degrees led to the closing of the
Mathematics Library on at
least four occasions during the
past two weeks, according to Li
brarian Mary Lewis. The li
brary is located in the attic of
Math Corner and has no air con
ditioning.
Dale Canelas, Associate Di
rector of Public Services for the
University libraries, has or
dered that the library be closed
if the temperature remains
above 93 degrees for one hour,
although there is no official poli
cy on the matter. High tem
peratures have been a more or
less annual problem since the li
brary opened in 1964 and espe

cially since its remodelling
about two years ago, according
to Canelas and Lewis.
An inspection of the ventila
tion system in early June turned
up a few minor problems such
as stuck dampers, but their cor
rection is not expected to "re
sult in a significant improve
ment in the system's per
formance." The cost of mod
ification to improve the system
was estimated at $10,000 —
20,000.
"There are no plans at pres
ent to improve the situation,"
Canelas said, citing "other de
mands on library funds." The
cost of a new air conditioning
system would be well over
$100,000.
