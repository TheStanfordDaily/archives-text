# American firms dump toxic waste overseas

By The Associated Press
Cambridge, Mass. — American corpo
rations are increasingly looking over
seas for places to-dispose of unwanted
hazardous wastes, and U.S. officials and
environmentalists warn that unless
there are stricter rules the result may be
disasters in health and foreign affairs.
"There is a worldwide search under
way to find somewhere abroad that can
be America's garbage bin," said Jacob
Scherr. an attorney with the Natural Re
sources Defense Council, a Washington
lobbying group.
"This is obviously not in America's
best interests. The potential is good for
exporting another Love Canal," he said,
referring to the .area of Niagara Falls,
N Y. where chemical dumping has been
blamed for health problems.
Sen. Daniel Inouve (D-Hawaii) also
used the Love Canal analogy earlier this
year in urging tighter restrictions on
what Americans are permitted to ship
overseas. Environmental damage
abroad caused by the dumping of U.S.
waste would "hurt our international stat
ure and harm our foreign policy in

terests," the senator
While there are thousands of different
hazardous wastes being generated by
American industry, only two —
polyohlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and
dioxin, one of the deadliest compounds
made by man — require approval before
export, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency.
Treatment facilities
The growing interest in shipping waste
abroad is prompted in part by the lack of
treatment and disposal facilities in the
U.S., said Richard Golob, whose World
Information Systems research organiza
tion in Cambridge studies the problem.
"We're seeing increasing evidence of
a flow of waste from here into developing
countries, which usually don't have the
facilities to safely handle it," said Golob.
Golob and government officials say it
is impossible to tell exactly how much
American waste winds up abroad But
several recent attempts to export waste
have come to light.
In March, Mexican authorities jailed
American expatriate Clarence Nugent
on charges of importing toxic chemicals

— 42 barrels of PCBs — and violating
Mexican health regulations.
Publicity surrounding Nugent's arrest
has caused Mexico's Office on Environ
mental Improvement to take a new look
at the enforcement of a law enacted last
October which closed the country's
border's to chemical wastes.
Last year Nedlog Technological Ser
vices Inc. of Arvada. Colo., which re
cycles waste from mines and industrial
firms, tried to ship waste to Sierra Leone
and reportedly was willing to pay the
African nation $25 million.
Nedlog president Dr. Jim Wolf con
firmed the company wanted to ship the
waste. He blamed adverse publicity for
making the operation "not feasible."
There also have been unsuccessful at
tempts in recent years to send hazardous
leftovers from the paint industry to
Haiti, highly toxic PCBs to Taiwan and
South Korea, and sewage sludge to Col
ombia, Antigua and Brazil.
Not illegal
Shipping dangerous waste abroad
often is not illegal — or even very dif
ficult. Sue Patterson, international rela

tions officer of the State Department's
office of environment and health, said
the government requires only that a
company give four weeks notice before
exporting hazardous materials. The U.S.
then quickly informs the foreign country
that it may soon receive a shipment of
deadly cargo, she said.
"So far there hasn't been a major
problem of sending the waste to coun
tries with no facilities," she said. "But
yes, we're worried about it. Over the
years, as companies have to transport
their waste farther in the United States
for disposal, in many cases it may be
cheaper to bring it to a ship on the East
Coast and just send it off some place."
Inouye wants tougher regulations. He
has introduced legislation to amend the
Export Administration Act of 1979 to in
clude export limits on all waste listed by
the EPA as hazardous, plus sewage
sludge and residues from waste treat
ment plants. An exporter would have to
obtain a license from the secretary of
commerce, who would issue it only if the
government of the importing country
agreed to receive the shipment.
