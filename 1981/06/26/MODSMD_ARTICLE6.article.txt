## Rostow approved as ACDA director Hardline on arms control revealed 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Testimony giv
en Monday by Eugene Rostow,
President Ronald Reagan's
choice to head the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency
(ACDA), reflected how dramat
ically the Reagan adminis
tration's approach to nuclear
arms control with Moscow dif
fers — at least orally — from
what Congress and the public
were accustomed lo in past ad
ministrations. Rostow was ap
proved as ACDA director bv a
10-1 vote in the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Tuesday.
In the Nixon. Ford and Carter
administrations, during which
the first and second Strategic
Arms Limitation (SALT) ac
cords with the Soviets were ne
gotiated, Congress could usual
ly find doves as well as hawks
among officials ranging from
the military Joint Chiefs of Staff
to the civilian head of the arms
control agency.
But in the Reagan adminis
tration, every top civilian of
ficial — including the president
and his top White House aides,
Secretary of State Haig, De
fense Secretary Weinberger,
ACDA director-designate
Rostow and retired Lt. Gen.
Rowny, the designate for arms
control negotiator — are not
only outspoken hardliners but
are on record against the kinds
of agreements negotiated by the
three previous administrations.
Anti-Soviet rhetoric
The Senate committee isn't
used to hearing a stream of
hardline anti-Soviet rhetoric
from the arms control agency,
which, for most of its 20-year
history, has been what commit
tee chairman Charles Percy (R
-111.) called Tuesday an "offset"
to those who just wanted to
"arm, arm, arm." But that is
what it got Monday when
Rostow laid out for the record
how the Reagan administration
looks at these crucial issues.
A •.
Rostow said now that Con
gress has agreed to the adminis
tration's massive defense re
building program, "it is now
possible and desirable for us to

resume the search for balanced
and verifiable arms control
agreements." He then set forth
tough conditions for the new
talks he said the administration
wants. "The Soviet drive for
empire is accelerating in
momentum and is becoming
more and more difficult to con
tain." he said.
Containment
Then ne unveiled the first spe
cific administration pitch to the
allies to join in a revitalization
of the 1947 Truman Doctrine of
containment, of Moscow as a
necessary basis for arms con
trol.
"The Western nations have
more than enough power and
potential power to accomplish
that goal. What has been lacking
is a shared perception of the
problem and the political will to
deal with it,"he said. By pursu
ing a policy of containment, he
added, the West also "should be
able to convince the Soviet
Union that the imperatives of
survival in the nuclear age de
mand strict and reciprocal re
spect ... for world order and
international use of force."
Second-strike capability
The United States, he
stressed, must have as its min
imal goal "a clear, credible and
unchallengeable second-strike
nuclear capability," meaning

the ability to retaliate after
being attacked, and no nego
tiation would be allowed to in
terfere with that.
The administration contends
the United States no longer has
second-strike capability, which
is of importance for two rea
sons, Rostow argued.
The first is that a retaliatory
missile force acts as a deterrent
to protect the United States and
its allies against nuclear attacK
or the threat of it.
The second is that secure nu
clear forces "permit us to use
military force in defense of our
interests with comparative
freedom if it should become
necessary. ... " In other words,
a rebuilding of nuclear forces
will allow use of conventional
forces with greater confidence.
Rostow also suggested that,
even before formal negotiations
with Moscow, the two nations
may need to discuss new ways of
verifying the dimensions of
each superpower's nuclear
arsenal. As weapons get more
complex, and new cruise and
mobile missiles that are hard to
spot and count enter the
arsenal, techniques other than
so-called "national means of
verification," which means spy
satellites, may be necessary, he
said.
