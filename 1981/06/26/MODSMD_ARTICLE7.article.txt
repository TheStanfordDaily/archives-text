The ministers agreed Monday that the name of each
passport holder's country would appear above the words "Eu

be phased in beginning in 1985.

for the passport, which member countries agreed to earlier
this year.
The purpose of the passport is to give citizens of the 10 Com
mon Market countries a common travel identity as a symbol
of European unity.
