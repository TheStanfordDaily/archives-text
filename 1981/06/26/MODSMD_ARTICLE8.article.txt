Londonâ€” British unemploy
ment rose to a 50-year high of
2,680,977 in June, or 11.1 percent
of the work force, the govern
ment announced Tuesday. This
was double the jobless toll when
Conservative Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher took office
in May 1979.
Employment Secretary
James Prior said 3 million job
less was possible by the end of
the year. Thatcher would not
confirm the forecast but told the
House of Commons the June fig
ures were "deplorable," and
added: "Inevitably, unemploy
ment will rise during the com
ing months."
She said the Department of

Employment figures showed a
slowdown in the underlying un
employment rate, but drew La
bor jeers when she tried to
ascribe much of the problem to
teen-agers leaving school at a
time when few people are reach
ing retirement age.
Thatcher said in the long term
her monetarist policy, en
couraging the streamlining of
industry, would bear fruit.
"It is necessary to get rid of
over-manning if industry is to be
competitive," she said. "The
irony is that it does give rise to
unemployment in the early
stages. Nevertheless it has to be
done if we are to have any hope
of expanding business in the
long term."
