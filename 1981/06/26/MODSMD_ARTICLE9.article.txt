# Reaganites cut support for solar research
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” In a sharp re
duction of the federal govern
ment's role in solar energy, the
Reagan administration has or
dered the dismissal of 370 of the
959 employees at the Solar
Energy Research Institute in
Golden, Colo., and has fired its
director, Denis Hayes.
In addition, the institute's
budget will be cut to $50 million
for the fiscal year starting Oct.
1, a 50 percent reduction from
current spending levels, the De
partment of Energy said Tues
day.
The four-year-old research

institute has been conducting a
wide range of research ac
tivities and demonstration
projects to convert the sun's
energy into heat and electricity,
and to make liquid fuels from
crop residues and urban gar
bage.
The Reagan administration
believes most of the develop
ment work should be carried out
by private industry, with the

government's role restricted to
high risk, exotic research
projects. Furthermore the De
partment of Energy has sched
uled sharp cuts in spending for
solar and conservation pro
grams, while increasing the
budget for research in nuclear
power.
Conservation can be achieved
through "realistic price sig

nals," with people using less
energy because it costs more,
said Maria Oharenko, of the De
partment of Energy. The re
moval in January of federal
price controls on crude oil
helped provide the right signal,
she said.
For solar energy, "near-term
development should be left to
the private sector," she said.
