| 10^COPY SERVICE
No longer will users need to fill their pockets with change in order to make
photocopies. A new copy service was installed on July Ist in the Stanford Univer
sity Libraries. Copy machines located throughout the Green Meyer, and branch
libraries now operate with a COPICARD (or coins if desired). The COPICARD, a
plastic card similar in appearance to a credit card, eliminates the need for the
right change and also makes multiple copying faster.
The plastic card, 2 x 3 in size, contains a magnetic strip programmed with the
number of copies purchased. To make copies, the card is simply inserted in the
u/k nB, num ' :)er °* Co P' es needed is selected and the print button pushed.
When the copies are made, the number of copies is subtracted automatically from
the value on the card, and the number displayed lets users know the remaining
value of the card.
(Personal COPICARDS can be purchased either at the Customer Service Desk at
the Stanford Bookstore, the Library Photocopy Center (107, West Green), the
otocopy Center (basement, Graduate School of Business), and the Nuts and
Mug lounge in Terman during normal business hours. Postage-paid orders by
check, Master Card or VISA can be placed using forms available at each copier.
COPICARDS are available in various denominations ranging from 100 to 5000
copies with the higher quantities receiving more of a discount.
$7.50 for 100 copies (7.5# per copy)
$21.00 for 300 copies (70 per copy)
$31.25 for 500 copies (6.250 per copy)
$50.00 for 1000 copies (50 per copy)
$237.50 for 5000 copies (4.750 per copy)
Coin vended copies are 100 per copy.
During the past academic year, COPICARD machines have been installed all over
the country. A new copying process by COPICO, the system combines credit card
usage for regular users and coin operation for occasional users. U.C. Berkeley,
University of Chicago and Cal State Chico are only a few of the variety of libraries
I successfully using the system. The COPICARD will save faculty, staff, and student
time since multiple copies can be made faster. Take advantage of this new copy
service today.
