Guam_
counted
The rampaging typhoon
that smashed Guam on
May 22,1976 isn't on the
front pages anymore. But
it will be a long time before
the people of Guam forget
it. And it will be a long time
before Red Cross forgets it
Because we were there.too.
Believe it or not, Guam
was only one of 30.000
in the last 12
months\ here we were
called on for help.
Which is the reason our
disaster funds are disas
trously low. And an impor
tant reason why we need
your continued support
Help us. Because the
things we do realty help In
your own neiahborhood.
We're
counting on
you.
