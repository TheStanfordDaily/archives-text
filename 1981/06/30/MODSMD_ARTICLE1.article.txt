# Music building to add arch to mall
## Fall start slated for annex 
### Karen Springen 
Construction of a new music
building adjacent to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium is slated to begin
early this December. The $6.3
million building is estimated to
be completed in August of 1983,
according to Clifford Morse,
project manager of the office of
project management.
The new structure will face
Lathrop House on the south side
and the post office on the nurui.
Morse said that existing build
ings and vegetation will not be
destroyed during the course of
the new construction.
Planning of the building
began in August of 1979 after
John Braun, a previous donor,
indicated interest in helping to
finance the project, said Morse.
The annex will be called the CF
Braun Music Center after fami

ly member Carl Braun (the
family does not want the initials
punctuated).
John Gilliland, manager of
the office of development, said
the amount of the "name gift"
has not been disclosed to the
public.
The building will bridge
across Lasuen Street in order to
retain that area as an open mall,
naaH Mors** Rut he citod faculty
concern about the danger of
being hit by errant bicyclists.
He called the architecture a
"linear design idea," since its
bridge structure will arch up
and over Lasuen. This will keep
the area clear for bicyclists
rather than create obstructions.
The portion of the music cen
ter spanning Lasuen will include
an archway glazed with clear

glass. Red tile roofing will cover
the entire edifice.
Morse said the top of the
building will be "about as high
as the roof of Storey House" (He
added that Storey House reno
vation will be completed in late
1982).
Morse said the purpose of the
building is to provide
classrooms, practice rooms,
regular faculty offices,

storage and a study area. The
upper floor will house primarily
faculty offices.
John Planting, adminis
trative services manager of the
music department, said,
"There has been a history of
promises to build the building
since the 19405."
He emphasized that the new
building will accommodate only

about two-thirds of music de
partment needs. Because of
this, the new music center will
be supplemented by the con
tinued use of the Knoll and
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
music department has used the
Knoll since 1947 when the de
partment was founded. Tem
porary facilities, such as the
trailers behind the Knoll, will no
longer be needed, however.
"The first thing the new
building will do is free Dink
from rehearsals," said Plant
ing. The University symphony
and wind ensemble will re
hearse in the new center, allow
ing Dinkelspiel to accomodate
additional performances. The
flat-floored rehearsal hall build
ing will serve primarily for in
strumental rehearsals. Future
plans, which are dependent on

donations, include building a
choral rehearsal area and a
stage shop. "We don't need pro
gramatic approval, just mon
ey," said Planting.
Marquis Associates were the
architects of the CF Braun Mu
sic Center. "Each project we
use different architects," said
Morse. A committee of eight
faculty and staff members,
formed in late 1979, has over
seen the entire project including
the approval of the architect.
Morse called the committee
"broad-based." Members in
clude A 1 Cohen, chairman of the
music department, and Susan
Schofield, assistant provost.
The builder has not been
chosen yet. Documents for bid
ding will be issued in early Sep
tember, said Morse. Ground
breaking will take place this
autumn as well.
