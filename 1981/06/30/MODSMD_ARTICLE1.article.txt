# Music building to add arch to mall
## Fall start slated for annex 
### Karen Springen 
Construction of a new music
building adjacent to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium is slated to begin
early this December. The $6.3
million building is estimated to
be completed in August of 1983,
according to Clifford Morse,
project manager of the office of
project management.
The new structure will face
Lathrop House on the south side
and the post office on the nurui.
Morse said that existing build
ings and vegetation will not be
destroyed during the course of
the new construction.
Planning of the building
began in August of 1979 after
John Braun, a previous donor,
indicated interest in helping to
finance the project, said Morse.
The annex will be called the CF
Braun Music Center after fami

ly member Carl Braun (the
family does not want the initials
punctuated).
John Gilliland, manager of
the office of development, said
the amount of the "name gift"
has not been disclosed to the
public.
The building will bridge
across Lasuen Street in order to
retain that area as an open mall,

concern about the danger of
being hit by errant bicyclists.
He called the architecture a
"linear design idea," since its
bridge structure will arch up
and over Lasuen. This will keep
the area clear for bicyclists
rather than create obstructions.
The portion of the music cen
ter spanning Lasuen will include
an archway glazed with clear

glass. Red tile roofing will cover
the entire edifice.
Morse said the top of the
building will be "about as high
as the roof of Storey House" (He
added that Storey House reno
vation will be completed in late
1982).
Morse said the purpose of the
building is to provide
classrooms, practice rooms,
regular faculty offices,

upper floor will house primarily
faculty offices.

music department, said,
"There has been a history of
promises to build the building
since the 19405."
He emphasized that the new
building will accommodate only
