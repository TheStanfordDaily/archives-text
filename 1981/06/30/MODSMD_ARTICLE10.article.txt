# A 						table of contents for Green and Meyer
## General libraries offer more than books 
### David Ream 
Off in one of the many quiet
corners on the second floor of
Green Library, not a sound may
be heard but the steady flow of
the air conditioners.
Green is the central library
here, acting as the "head
quarters" for more than 40 loca
tions of the University's
network of libraries.
Green's main function is the
storing of the University's gen
eral collection of books. About
1.5 of Stanford's 4 million vol
umes are housed in Green. In
addition to this extensive collec
tion, much of Green's ground
floor accomodates a large Ref
erence Room, 30,000 volumes
strong (not including current is
sues of about 2000 periodicals).
Green also houses the Govern
ment Documents Department,
the Department of Special Col
lections, the Central Map Col
lection, and the University
Archives.
Green is not the only general
library on campus, however.
Only a few yards away is Meyer
Memorial Library, which con
tains approximately 120,000 vol
umes of general undergraduate
interest. As the undergraduate
library, Meyer generally serves
more students daily than Green,
whose clientele consists largely
of graduate students and faculty
(in addition to undergraduates)
who tend to spend more time on
their visits due to the types of
projects they are involved in.
Meyer provides language
labs, audio-visuai services, and
seminar rooms. It is also the
place to ho for undergraduate
course reserve reading
Green and Meyer both lend
books for one month at a time.
Fines are collected rather
strictly after a short grace peri
od. The lending policies vary at
other campus libraries.
For those students who need
help with researching, whether
as a requisite to getting a term
paper finished or just to save
time, various services are of
fered at Green, Meyer, and
most other campus libraries to
assist in locating material
quickly.
Meyer offers a Term Paper

Advisory Service (TPAS),
available during all quarters.
All one needs to do to take ad
vantage of TPAS is fill out an ap
plication form available from
the Meyer reference desk. An
appointment will then be ar
ranged with the librarian most
qualified to assist in your sub
ject. By using TPAS, you can
find out which research tools to
use, how to use them best, and
which of the many other librar
ies may be of use.

Green and many other librar
ies here offer a more specific
service for researchers, the
Computer Search Service. This
service provides a com
puterized search for literature
that is relevant to one's subject
guidelines.
The service is available to
any student, faculty, or staff
member from most reference
staffs throughout the University
libraries. The fee for a retro
spective search ranges from $10

to $30. A search of current mate
rial to update a retrospective
search costs from $5 to $10.
If, after utilizing all available
research services, one still
comes up empty-handed, all is
not lost. Stanford and the Uni
versity of California at
Berkeley offer what is called
the Gutenberg Express, a fleet
of two 11-passenger vans that
travel a one hour and 15 minute
route between the two cam
puses four times daily Monday

through Friday. The vans leave
Stanford from the north side of
Green behind Hoover Tower and
arrive at the West Gate of the
Berkeley campus.
Departure times from both
sites are 8:30 and 10:30 a.m.,
and 1:15 and 3:15 p.m. Either a
Program Borrower's Card or a
Bus Pass is needed to board.
Bus passes may be obtained
from the Green Priviledges
Desk at least a day in advance.
Also, it is advisable to make a
reservation at the Priviledges
Desk; passengers are admitted
on a first come, first served
basis.
Other services offered by the
general libraries are calcu
lators (Meyer Loan Desk),
study carrels (inquire at Meyer
Loan Desk), microfilm readers
(Green, Meyer, and all research
branches), and manual and
electric typewriters (Green and
Meyer).
SURE (Students United for
Rape Elimination) offers a bi
cycling-escort service to all stu
dents and staff. Escorts will
travel up to one mile off campus
between 8 p.m. and midnight,
Sunday through Thursday and
will arrive within 5 minutes of
receiving a call (the number is
497-3217). All libraries open at
night supply phones for those
who need an escort.
