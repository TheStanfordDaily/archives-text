# Stanford summer theater workshop
## Dedicated students devote summer to theater 
### Jane Wollenberg 
Are you living in a dorm with
neighbors (or worse yet, a
roommate) whom you have yet
to see? Perhaps the person is
one of the 34 members of the
Stanford Summer Theater
workshop company.
What else could keep people
out of the beautiful California
sun from 9-12, 1-5, and 7-11, six
days a week (and an occassional
Sunday) ? The answer is not sim
ply that they are stage-struck
theater addicts. Producing
eight shows in eight weeks re
quires that those 'stage-struck'
people put in many hours of
work.
The company players become
tirm believers in the old maxim
that for every person on stage

there are at least two more peo
ple working backstage, and that
for every hour of performance,
there are countless hours ot re
hearsal and training.
For the members of the com
pany, an average day (every
Monday through Friday) begins
with the members lying on their
backs on the dusty stage floor of
Memorial Auditorium at 8:45
for the morning movement
class. At 10:00 they go off in a
variety of directions to one of
the several different classes of
fered in make-up, voice, or act
ing. The remainder of the day is
spent sewing costumes, building
sets, focusing lights, or in re
hearsals for the next show.
Evenings are reserved for re
hearsals and performances. Be

tween classes, work calls, re
hearsals, and performances,
their mornings, afternoons, and
nights are taken up by their
work in theater. One person in
volved in last year's workshop
said it's "a 60 hour a week com
mitment."
The eight plays, which are the
ultimate goal of this time and
energy, are selected tor their
entertainment and educational
value. They include comedies,
tragedies, song and dance —
something for everyone. This
season includes two full-length
plays.
The first, Criminal Minds by
Robin Swicord, begins in mid-
July. In Criminal Minds, the
main character Eddie Ray is an
ex-convict, who, along with his
girlfriend and a fellow ex-con,

Renfroe, lives at a deserted
miniature golf course. In the
play, Ray is scheming up "the
perfect crime"and has hopes of
having Renfroe execute it for
him.
The second show is a southern
gothic comedy which runs early
August. The Miss Firecracker
Contest is by Beth Henley, win
ner of last year's Pulitzer Prize
for her play Crimes of the
Heart. The Miss Firecracker
Contest is the tale of a girl
trying to redeem her lost repu
tation by winning a beauty con
test. Trying to help her are her
two cousins, and her
seamstress, Popeye Jackson.
The other six shows are part
ot the Drama at 12 series
(which are performed in the
Nitery in the Old Union) on
Wednesdays and Thursdays at
noon, and Fridays at noon and
midnight. The noontime shows
are designed to tit into the lunch
hour — hopefully starting
promptly at 12:07 and finishing
a few minutes before 1:00.
The first of the Nitery shows
is John Millington Synge's
Riders to the Sea. It is the tragic
tale of an indigent family ot fish
ermen struggling for existence
on the Aran Islands off Ireland.

Director Jim Carmody, a gradu
ate student at Stanford, grew up
in Ireland. He said he hopes to
incorporate realistic and folk
elements, as well as traditional
Celtic music, into the produc
tion.
The rest of the Nitery series
consists of several other shows,
including The Chinese Restau
rant Syndrome, the story of the
reunion ot two young women
over lunch in a Chinese restau
rant, God, a Woody Allen "neo
classic" farce and Mrozek's
Charlie, a parable play about
political contormity in a total
itarian state.
After Charlie, Terrance
McNally's Noon will be per
formed. This is a contemporary
one-act about tive people who
answer five different ads solic
iting various types of sexual
partners and arrive at the same
time. The season ends with
Summer's End, an original
dance show which is conceived,
directed, and choreographed by
Diane Waller, a member ot the
company staff.
So next time you see that
roommate or dormmate who
always comes dragging in after
11:00 p.m., remember to ask if
they belong to the company.


Andrea Bahman and Lisa Jacobson, two members
of the 1981 summer theater company, perform in a
scene from 'Hooters,' a play performed by the thea-

ter company last year. The theater company is pres
enting eight plays this summer.
