## Low registration rate a solace after Court ruling 
### 
For those who mourn the
passing of each hurdle on the
way to the resumption of a mili
tary draft, last week was a
doubly-disappointing time —
speckled with one notable bright
spot.
On Monday, the Selective Ser
vice System announced that it
had mailed out the first round of
warning letters to American
men who allegedly violated the
year-old draft registration law.
Then, on Thursday, the U.S. Su
preme Court ruled that the Con
stitution permits Congress to
discriminate against men
and/or women (pick one, or
both, depending on your point of
view) by singling out just males
for registration, and presum
ably the draft.
But, in between these two des
olate announcements came a
more heartening (and less pub

licized) revelation: Selective
Service conceded that just 69
percent of men born in the first
quarter of 1963 had registered
for the draft.
The first item signaled Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's intention
to forsake his campaign prom
ise and continue with regis
tration; the second indicated
the Court's willingness to forget
the equal protection guarantee
of the Fifth Amendment in mat
ters of "national defense." For
tunately, the last item estab
lished that the young people of
this country, who hold the ul
timate veto over any kind of
draft legislation, are unwilling
to accept the latest surge of
American militarist sentiment.
The Selective Service has, for
the moment, only sent warnings
to the few men who have been
"informed upon" by private

citizens. Just 150 men have so
far been contacted and only 500
more letters are planned, out of
the more than 500,000 non
registrants the Selective Ser-

the possibility of reviving the draft free of
the prospect that the Constitution might
require the inclusion of women.

vice acknowledges exist. The
letters offered the men second
chances to register for the draft
before prosecution would be in
itiated, but warned that if they
did not comply within 15 days,
their names would be forwarded
to the Justice Department.
"We have a commitment
from them (Justice Depart-

ment) that they will go about be
ginning prosecutions," said
Joan Lamb, the public affairs
officer of Selective Service.
Such a commitment could only

come with the approval of top
Reagan administration of
ficials.
But more important than the
latest moves of the Selective
Service System was the Su
preme Court sex discrimination
decision. Its main consequence,
as the New York Times account
of the ruling states, is, "It al
lows policy makers in Congress
and the White House to consider
the possibility of reviving the
draft free of the prospect that
the Constitution might require
the inclusion of women."
The Court, in a 6-3 decision
written by Justice William Ren
quist, chose to accede to the will
of Congress in upholding male
only registration.
"Whenever called upon to
judge the constitutionality of an
Act of Congress," Renquist
wrote, "the Court accords
great weight to the decision of
Congress . . . ' This is not, how
ever, merely a case involving
the customary deference ac
corded Congressional decisions.
The case arises in the context of
Congress' authority over na
tional defense and military af
fairs, and perhaps in no other
area has the Court accorded
Congress greater deference."
But as Justice Thurgood
Marshall noted in his scathing
dissent, the Court had ignored
an important precedent. Ac
cording to Craig v. Boren (1976),
gender-based discrimination by

Congress can only be justified if
it serves an important gov
ernmental objective.
Marshall rightly concluded,
"The Government's task in this
case is to demonstrate that ex
cluding women from regis
tration substantially furthers
the goal of preparing for a draft
of combat troops. Or to put it an
other way, the Government
must show that registering
women would substantially im
pede its efforts to prepare for
such a draft." That, the Govern
ment clearly could not do.
Renquist also stated that the
primary goal of a draft would be
to induct combat soldiers, and
noted that federal law and mili
tary policy bar women from
combat. Therefore, he main
tained, Congress was justified
in restricting registration (and
presumably a draft) to men. But
here again the majority opinion
is flawed — as Marshall said in
his dissent, only two-thirds of
the demand for conscripts
would be in combat positions.
But one could at least take
heart in the official recognition
last week that the nation's
young men are increasingly re
sisting the Government's at
tempts to register them for a
possible draft. The Selective
Service's official figures (which
independent bodies such as the
Boston Globe have found to be
inflated) state that 95 1/2 per
cent of the men born in 1960 and
1961, 87 percent of the men born
in 1962, and just 69 percent of the
men born in the first quarter of
1963 have registered.
"With continuous regis
tration and withovA. a AxalV,
that's par for the course, as
serted Selective Service spokes
woman Lamb, of the 69 percent
figure. She compared the situ
ation to that of 1974-75, when in
ductions had been discontinued
but registration was main
tained, and only 64 percent of
eligible men registered. But the
comparison is grossly unfair: in
'74, many people mistakenly be
lieved that registration had al
ready ended, while today, ev
eryone knows registration is in
place.
Besides, in '74, the era of
draftcard burnings had just
ended, anti-Vietnam sentiment
was still high, and Watergate
was happening. A better com
parison would be with the early
days of the Vietnam War, when,
according to Lamb, compliance
was between 98 and 99 percent.
In the face of recurrent head
lines suggesting that a full
fledged draft is on its way, what
is to be done? Anti-draft ac
tivism has been, and continues
to be the most effective weapon
students have at their disposal.
Letters and phone calls to
government officials, while not
exactly powerful, don't hurt
either. And finally, as the69 per
cent compliance rate indicates,
those registration-age youth
who do precisely nothing are
making their voices of opposi
tion to the draft heard as well.

heart in the official recognition
last week that the nation's
young men are increasingly re
sisting the Government's at
tempts to register them for a
possible draft. The Selective
Service's official figures (which
independent bodies such as the
Boston Globe have found to be
inflated) state that 95 1/2 per
cent of the men born in 1960 and
1961, 87 percent of the men born
in 1962, and just 69 percent of the
men born in the first quarter of
1963 have registered.
"With continuous regis
tration and withovA. a AxalV,
that's par for the course, as
serted Selective Service spokes
woman Lamb, of the 69 percent
figure. She compared the situ
ation to that of 1974-75, when in
ductions had been discontinued
but registration was main
tained, and only 64 percent of
eligible men registered. But the
comparison is grossly unfair: in
'74, many people mistakenly be
lieved that registration had al
ready ended, while today, ev
eryone knows registration is in
place.
Besides, in '74, the era of
draftcard burnings had just
ended, anti-Vietnam sentiment
was still high, and Watergate
was happening. A better com
parison would be with the early
days of the Vietnam War, when,
according to Lamb, compliance
was between 98 and 99 percent.
In the face of recurrent head
lines suggesting that a full
fledged draft is on its way, what
is to be done? Anti-draft ac
tivism has been, and continues
to be the most effective weapon
students have at their disposal.
Letters and phone calls to
government officials, while not
exactly powerful, don't hurt
either. And finally, as the69 per
cent compliance rate indicates,
those registration-age youth
who do precisely nothing are
making their voices of opposi
tion to the draft heard as well.

For those who mourn the
passing of each hurdle on the
way to the resumption of a mili
tary draft, last week was a
doubly-disappointing time —
speckled with one notable bright
spot.
On Monday, the Selective Ser
vice System announced that it
had mailed out the first round of
warning letters to American
men who allegedly violated the
year-old draft registration law.
Then, on Thursday, the U.S. Su
preme Court ruled that the Con
stitution permits Congress to
discriminate against men
and/or women (pick one, or
both, depending on your point of
view) by singling out just males
for registration, and presum
ably the draft.
But, in between these two des
olate announcements came a
more heartening (and less pub

licized) revelation: Selective
Service conceded that just 69
percent of men born in the first
quarter of 1963 had registered
for the draft.
The first item signaled Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's intention
to forsake his campaign prom
ise and continue with regis
tration; the second indicated
the Court's willingness to forget
the equal protection guarantee
of the Fifth Amendment in mat
ters of "national defense." For
tunately, the last item estab
lished that the young people of
this country, who hold the ul
timate veto over any kind of
draft legislation, are unwilling
to accept the latest surge of
American militarist sentiment.
The Selective Service has, for
the moment, only sent warnings
to the few men who have been
"informed upon" by private

citizens. Just 150 men have so
far been contacted and only 500
more letters are planned, out of
the more than 500,000 non
registrants the Selective Ser-

vice acknowledges exist. The
letters offered the men second
chances to register for the draft
before prosecution would be in
itiated, but warned that if they
did not comply within 15 days,
their names would be forwarded
to the Justice Department.
"We have a commitment
from them (Justice Depart-

ment) that they will go about be
ginning prosecutions," said
Joan Lamb, the public affairs
officer of Selective Service.
Such a commitment could only

come with the approval of top
Reagan administration of
ficials.
But more important than the
latest moves of the Selective
Service System was the Su
preme Court sex discrimination
decision. Its main consequence,
as the New York Times account
of the ruling states, is, "It al
lows policy makers in Congress
and the White House to consider
the possibility of reviving the
draft free of the prospect that
the Constitution might require
the inclusion of women."
The Court, in a 6-3 decision
written by Justice William Ren
quist, chose to accede to the will
of Congress in upholding male
only registration.
"Whenever called upon to
judge the constitutionality of an
Act of Congress," Renquist
wrote, "the Court accords
great weight to the decision of
Congress . . . ' This is not, how
ever, merely a case involving
the customary deference ac
corded Congressional decisions.
The case arises in the context of
Congress' authority over na
tional defense and military af
fairs, and perhaps in no other
area has the Court accorded
Congress greater deference."
But as Justice Thurgood
Marshall noted in his scathing
dissent, the Court had ignored
an important precedent. Ac
cording to Craig v. Boren (1976),
gender-based discrimination by

Congress can only be justified if
it serves an important gov
ernmental objective.
Marshall rightly concluded,
"The Government's task in this
case is to demonstrate that ex
cluding women from regis
tration substantially furthers
the goal of preparing for a draft
of combat troops. Or to put it an
other way, the Government
must show that registering
women would substantially im
pede its efforts to prepare for
such a draft." That, the Govern
ment clearly could not do.
Renquist also stated that the
primary goal of a draft would be
to induct combat soldiers, and
noted that federal law and mili
tary policy bar women from
combat. Therefore, he main
tained, Congress was justified
in restricting registration (and
presumably a draft) to men. But
here again the majority opinion
is flawed — as Marshall said in
his dissent, only two-thirds of
the demand for conscripts
would be in combat positions.
