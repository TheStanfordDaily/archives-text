## Fundamentalism different from militarism 
### 
Although I agree with Jerry Russell (Dai
ly, June 23) that arms control advocates
ought to try to understand the "basic moral
system" of those who favor the increased
production and deployment ol nuclear
arms, I cannot agree with some of the argu
ments he uses to support that conclusion. In
trying to uncover the moral beliefs ot men
like Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of
the Interior James Watt. Russell has made
some highly questionable statements about
the nature of fundamentalism and has
slipped into a largely uncritical method of
biblical interpretation.
Mr. Russell contends that biblical fun
damentalism is responsible, to some
degree, for the present interest in increas
ing rather than reducing the size ot our nu
clear arsenal. He asserts that advocates of
such an increase, as religious believers, are
"convinced that the ultimate goal of life can
only be fulfilled after death," and are there
fore more concerned with defeating the
godless forces of communism than preserv
ing western civilization. Finally, he finds
evidence that the Bible is a "militaristic
tract" which "contains . , . clear incite
ments to violence."
Let me address these points in order.
First. I think there is no doubt that many
fundamentalists sympathize with the basic
goals of the so-called New Right, which in
clude re-establishing America as the
world's most powerful nation. But I don't
think we can say that fundamentalism has
brought this interest in military might into
existence. At most, a fundamentalist orien
tation to the Bible may be a contributing
factor to the complex of attitudes which
make up a military "hardliner."
On the second point, Mr. Russell thinks
that fundamentalists who favor increased
arms expenditures are acting out of a belief
that a better world awaits them upon their

exit from this one. We should take note of
the tact that a surprisingly large number of
fundamentalists have shown themselves to
be extremely comfortable in the present
world. According to James Barr, a noted
student of fundamentalism, "the acute re
ligiosity of the fundamentalist does not alter
the fact that in another sense he almost fully
accepts the secular and economic structure
of that world."
Indeed, far from thinking of the world as
unreal and expendable, men like Alexander
Haig (who is, by the way, no fundamen
talist, but a Roman Catholic) seem to think
of it as an enormous power base, from which
they can rise to positions ot importance in
business, the military, and government.
Thirdly, Mr. Russell believes that the fun
damentalist is acting out of sincere devotion
to the Bible, which he feels is a "tremen
dous encouragement to hot and cold war
riors." We should realize, however, that the
Bible is a remarkably diverse collection of
writings composed over almost a millenium
by authors of varying historical and theolog
ical interests. Surely there is a great deal of
bloodshed in its pages. But to use the pas
sages in which this occurs as evidence for
the militaristic nature of the Bible is to fol
low the same uncritical approach which fun
damentalists follow.
The problem is not that the Bible is a mili
taristic tract; the problem is that a large
number of people have made the mistake of
thinking that it is one. As a matter of fact
the Bible is open to quite the opposite in
terpretation as well. Until at least the early
fourth century many Christians thought
that the message of Jesus actually pro
hibited participation in the Roman army.
Indeed, pacificism has continued to be a
Christian option up to our own time.
I think that it would be more to the point if
we looked at the fundamentalists' support
for the arms race in the light of their gener

ally uncritical approach to the Bible and the
world.
Fundamentalist faith is based in part on
the absolute inerrancy of the Bible. Those
who hold this attitude will find it difficult
not only to question the authority of the
Bible, but also to adopt a critical view of
anything perceived as given from above. It
is an article of our civil religion that Ameri
ca should be strong and fight communism.
Fundamentalists have taken on this belief in
a largely uncritical way, and used it as a
platform in their new political program.
If we listen to the advocates of nuclear
arms, as Mr. Russell rightly advises us to
do, I believe we will hear, in the rhetoric
about strength and honor and freedom, the
voices of many people, fundamentalists and
non-fundamentalists alike. The common
characteristic of these people is not a belief
in the Second Coming or the inerrancy of the
Bible.
The common characteristic is fear, the
very human fear of facing a universe on the
brink of meaninglessness, and ot challeng
ing the social and economic systems which
we ourselves have made, and which offer us
but fragile security and the threat of ul
timate extinction.

damentalists follow.
The problem is not that the Bible is a mili
taristic tract; the problem is that a large
number of people have made the mistake of
thinking that it is one. As a matter of fact
the Bible is open to quite the opposite in
terpretation as well. Until at least the early
fourth century many Christians thought
that the message of Jesus actually pro
hibited participation in the Roman army.
Indeed, pacificism has continued to be a
Christian option up to our own time.
I think that it would be more to the point if
we looked at the fundamentalists' support
for the arms race in the light of their gener

ally uncritical approach to the Bible and the
world.
Fundamentalist faith is based in part on
the absolute inerrancy of the Bible. Those
who hold this attitude will find it difficult
not only to question the authority of the
Bible, but also to adopt a critical view of
anything perceived as given from above. It
is an article of our civil religion that Ameri
ca should be strong and fight communism.
Fundamentalists have taken on this belief in
a largely uncritical way, and used it as a
platform in their new political program.
If we listen to the advocates of nuclear
arms, as Mr. Russell rightly advises us to
do, I believe we will hear, in the rhetoric
about strength and honor and freedom, the
voices of many people, fundamentalists and
non-fundamentalists alike. The common
characteristic of these people is not a belief
in the Second Coming or the inerrancy of the
Bible.
The common characteristic is fear, the
very human fear of facing a universe on the
brink of meaninglessness, and ot challeng
ing the social and economic systems which
we ourselves have made, and which offer us
but fragile security and the threat of ul
timate extinction.

Although I agree with Jerry Russell (Dai
ly, June 23) that arms control advocates
ought to try to understand the "basic moral
system" of those who favor the increased
production and deployment ol nuclear
arms, I cannot agree with some of the argu
ments he uses to support that conclusion. In
trying to uncover the moral beliefs ot men
like Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of
the Interior James Watt. Russell has made
some highly questionable statements about
the nature of fundamentalism and has
slipped into a largely uncritical method of
biblical interpretation.
Mr. Russell contends that biblical fun
damentalism is responsible, to some
degree, for the present interest in increas
ing rather than reducing the size ot our nu
clear arsenal. He asserts that advocates of
such an increase, as religious believers, are
"convinced that the ultimate goal of life can
only be fulfilled after death," and are there
fore more concerned with defeating the
godless forces of communism than preserv
ing western civilization. Finally, he finds
evidence that the Bible is a "militaristic
tract" which "contains . , . clear incite
ments to violence."
Let me address these points in order.
First. I think there is no doubt that many
fundamentalists sympathize with the basic
goals of the so-called New Right, which in
clude re-establishing America as the
world's most powerful nation. But I don't
think we can say that fundamentalism has
brought this interest in military might into
existence. At most, a fundamentalist orien
tation to the Bible may be a contributing
factor to the complex of attitudes which
make up a military "hardliner."
On the second point, Mr. Russell thinks
that fundamentalists who favor increased
arms expenditures are acting out of a belief
that a better world awaits them upon their

exit from this one. We should take note of
the tact that a surprisingly large number of
fundamentalists have shown themselves to
be extremely comfortable in the present
world. According to James Barr, a noted
student of fundamentalism, "the acute re
ligiosity of the fundamentalist does not alter
the fact that in another sense he almost fully
accepts the secular and economic structure
of that world."
Indeed, far from thinking of the world as
unreal and expendable, men like Alexander
Haig (who is, by the way, no fundamen
talist, but a Roman Catholic) seem to think
of it as an enormous power base, from which
they can rise to positions ot importance in
business, the military, and government.
Thirdly, Mr. Russell believes that the fun
damentalist is acting out of sincere devotion
to the Bible, which he feels is a "tremen
dous encouragement to hot and cold war
riors." We should realize, however, that the
Bible is a remarkably diverse collection of
writings composed over almost a millenium
by authors of varying historical and theolog
ical interests. Surely there is a great deal of
bloodshed in its pages. But to use the pas
sages in which this occurs as evidence for
the militaristic nature of the Bible is to fol
low the same uncritical approach which fun
damentalists follow.
The problem is not that the Bible is a mili
taristic tract; the problem is that a large
number of people have made the mistake of
thinking that it is one. As a matter of fact
the Bible is open to quite the opposite in
terpretation as well. Until at least the early
fourth century many Christians thought

hibited participation in the Roman army.
