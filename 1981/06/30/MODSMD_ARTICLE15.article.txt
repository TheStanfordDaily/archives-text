## Reverend Falldown: damned are the liberals 
### 
"Behold, I bring you tidings
of great joy, for born unto Stan
ford this day is a force so pow
erful that the sinful will writhe
for forgiveness and the Right
wing Reactionaries will find a
haven of electoral success. "
Reverend Jerry Falldown
Let us pay. Stanford now
possesses a cause so noble, a
force so altrustic, that Eastern
Universities can only dream of a
handful of dust from Stanford
soil: Stanford's own branch of
the Moral Majority. Impressed
and concerned, the Daily re
quested an interview with the
Reverend Falldown to discuss
the Fundamental glory of SUM
MA, the Stanford University
Moral Majority Association.
Daily: Well Reverend, where
exactly on Campus will the As
sociation be based?
Falldown: You're not with
one of those girlie magazines
are you? Damned are those who
interfere in the private lives of
good men.
Daily: No, we're an independ

ent newspaper.
Falldown: Good, good. Now
to that question. The Associa
tion has a unique location on
campus. It's always to the right
of you.
Daily: How do you plan to im
plement SUMMA on campus.
Falldown: Well sir, let me tell
you. This campus is crawling
with liberal commie pinko sex
offenders. Right now we're in
volved in litigation with the uni
versity to release the names of
all unmarried students who
have taken Humbio 10: Human
Sexuality.
Daily: But what could you do
with such a list?
Falldown: Give it to God,
long distance, after 11:00 p.m.
when the rates are cheaper.
Daily: But what would God do
with it?
Falldown: You, sir, have no
Bible schooling. Let me read a
passage from Matthew, the Ser
mon on the Mount. "Blessed be
those middle aged conservative
men that decide the fate of

women's bodies. Blessed be the
conservatives, for they shall in
herit the wealth of the poor.
Damned are those feminists
who are attempting to destroy
the fabric of the family. Blessed
be those women who are
barefoot and pregnant. Blessed
are those who are of the rightist
fringe as is the Lord thy God. All
others shall burn!"
Daily: I never knew that God
was a reactionary Republican.
Falldown: Yup, he's been a
registered reactionary ever

rafters are crawling with it. . .
but I have a solution.
Daily: Will it work?
Falldown: Do you know the
difference between steers and
bulls?
Daily: AH. Well, that's, ah,
very nice. What other plans do
you have for Stanford?
Falldown: Well, we're plan
ning a complete review of the
Stanford administration, just
like we did with Congress. The
last Kennedy was a liberal, and
once a sinner, always a sinner.

ported ERA. You know, of
course, that you've lost the
Kingdom of Heaven that we
promise to all of our members.
Daily: But I remember read
ing somewhere that only the
smallest minority are fit for the
eternal kingdom, not a Majori
ty-
Falldown: Alas, you've
missed the point. God is what
ever we want him to be. Look at
it this way: we interpret the
Bible and call the shots in poli
tics. That's what the Moral Ma-
