farm and is straight and up
right. She studies hard, and as a
sleepless Eremite she earns a

Then the inevitable occurred.
Walking by the lake after an ex
hausting final, she spotted the
Row of Knowledge of Decadent
Merriment. A single Zete hissed
from behind the row, "Like to

Daily: But Donald Kennedy is
a God-fearing upright man.
Falldown: Do you really think

Falldown: They're Baby
