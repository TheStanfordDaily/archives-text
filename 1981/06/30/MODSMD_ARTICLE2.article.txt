# Polls show election to be close
## Israelis undecided over Begin, Peres 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israelis
will vote today in an election
which the polls predict will pro
duce no decisive majority for
either Prime Minister Men
achem Begin or challenger
Shimon Peres.
A poll published yesterday in
the Haaretz newspaper showed
Peres' Labor Party leading Be
gin's Likud Bloc by 43 seats to 40
in the 120-seat Parliament.
On Sunday the Jerusalem
Post published results of a poll
taken last Thursday by the Mod
iin Ezrahi Applied Research
Center which put Labor and
Likud even at 42 seats each.
If the latest surveys are ac
curate, they mean victory
would go to whoever can pull to
gether a coalition from the half
dozen splinter factions likely to
pick up seats — a process that
could last weeks.
Several factors raised addi
tional doubts about the election
outcome, despite the polls
(whose accuracy has been spot
ty in past elections here). One of
them is purely seasonal — about
10 percent of eligible voters are
expected to be out of the country
on vacation today — the height
of summer holiday time here.
Because most who can afford

travel abroad are likely to be
middle-class and upper middle
class voters who would natural
ly lean toward the moderate
Peres, the Labor Party leader
appealed to them to stay home
long enough to vote.
Begin s largest single bloc of
support, according to demo
graphers who have studied his
following in recent weeks,

comes from the lower classes,
especially Moroccan and other
so-called "Oriental" or
"ethnic" Jews, few of whom
travel out of the country.
Ironically, following a cam
paign that the weekly magazine
Newsview called "the nastiest
in the history of electioneer
ing," Peres and Begin seem
almost to have reversed the

roles they played four years ago
when Begin's right wing Likud
coalition toppled the Labor Par
ty, which had ruled Israel in one
coalition government after an
other since the young state was
founded more than 30 years ago.
The issue in the elections of
1977 was not Begin, who was an
outsider with virtually no per
sonal following then.
