# More of the same 007: fast women, fast cars
## 
### 
By Karen Halbo and Peter
Wallace
If you like fast cars, fast
women, and fast-moving chase
scenes, the new James Bond 007
movie. For Your Eyes Only is a
must.
From the opening credits,
with the trademark gun-sight
shot and the standard pop theme
song, to the obligatory implied
sex scene near the end. the au
dience is caught up in vintage
Bond magic.
At the begining of the movie
the Bond "magic" is but a mere
glimmer as the standard plot is
established: Bond must save
Britain from sure disaster — a
key coding device of the British
fleet (referred to as the AT AC
system) is lying in the Mediter
ranian Sea, and — of course —
the Russians are out to get it.
But Bond quickly moves to
high gear. He tracks down an as
sassin who has just knocked off
one of Britain's key agents —
the one who was salvaging the
sunken ATAC system.
On his way to find the assassin
we see the latest of the fabulous
"Bond-mobiles" — a stunning
Lotus Esprit Turbo.
As Bond watches, the as
sassin is paid off, and then shot
by a hidden sexy on-looker,
Melina, played by actress Carol
Bouquet. Melina turns out to be
the daughter of the dead agent
as well as the latest of those leg
endary Bond beauties.
Bond and Melina head for the
Lotus to make their escape, but
while the horror-striken au
dience watches, unsuspecting
"bad guys" attempt to break in
to that beautiful machine, and
are consequently blown to bits
as the car explodes.
Luckily for Bond, Melina has
a car, and soon the two arc rao-

ing down treacherous mountain
roads in a beat-up yellow Volks
wagen, with trained assassins,
who just happen to be terrible
drivers, in pursuit.
Narrowly avoiding calamity
at every turn, Bond leads the
gunmen to their deaths before
calmly remarking to Melina, "I
don't believe we've been proper
ly introduced; the name is
Bond, James Bond."
From there to the Alps, from
the Alps to the Mediterranean,
the cat-and-mouse chase (with
Bond and the villans alternating
as pursuer and pursued) con
tinues. It ends at a monastery
surrounded by steep, plummet
ting cliffs — accessible only by
helicopter and an ancient basket
gondola.
For Bond fans, this film is a
return to the classic Bond for
mula that contributed to the
genre's popularity in the '60s.
Bond's arch-enemy Blofeld is
disposed of in the opening
scenes. We see no more of either
him, or the multitude of Star
Wars-type gadgetry and techno
logical fantasy that abounded in
the Bond flicks of the last dec
ade, instead we see a Bond who
is neither a superman, nor a
clown.
For Your Eyes Only also con
tains some surprising moments
as far as women are concerned.
Bond has been changed by wom
en's lib.
The difference is that James
has learned to say "no." He not
only turns down the amorous ad
vances of an adolescent Lynn-
Holly Johnson, but (for those
who keep score) he accepts 'the
attentions' of only two women
during the course of the entire
film
