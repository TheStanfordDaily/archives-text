# Discreet smarm of the bourgeoise
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The Four Seasons is about
three couples who vacation to
gether: Jack (Alan Alda), a
lawyer who is quick to judge
others but resistant to criticism
of himself, and who keeps his
temper under WASP-tight con
trol, and Kate (Carol Burnett),
a magazine editor; Danny (Jack
Weston), a dentist whose
thousand and one phobias are all
fronts for his fear of death, and
Claudia (Rita Moreno), a
painter; Nick (Len Cariou),
who throws over his wife Annie
(Sandy Dennis), whose creative
drive is stuck at vegetable pho
tography, for a younger, pret
tier stewardess, Ginny (Bess
Armstrong).
The movie, which was
scripted and directed by Alda,
pursues these people, who are
either insufferably dull or im
mensely irritating, through four
seasonal holidays — in a country

cottage in the spring, on a boat
in the summer, on a parents'
weekend at their children's col
lege in the fall, and skiing in the
winter — as Victor Kemper's
self-consciously picturesque
photography serves up the ap
propriate landscape and the fit
ting movement of Vivaldi's
Four Seasons pounds on the
soundtrack. (As one of my
friends complained, it's enough
to make you hate Vivaldi.)
The Four Seasons is the kind
of self-pitying, self-serving
comedy-drama no actor could
survive. It presents its charac
ters as boobs who get on each
other's nerves and then asks you
to love you them because they
are vulnerable and need each
other.
Most of the comedy is based
on their incompetence at the
various sports they attempt —
couldn't Alda think up some bet
ter comic ideas than the old

mired anchor and ski accident
ploys? — or on the obstacles
that their egos and obsessions
set up in the path of their friend
ship.
There's an antique sex farce
routine about the inability of
two of the couples to sleep at
night because Nick and Ginny's
lovemaking is so joyously loud.
The subtext of this gag is dis
turbing: Alda seems to be sug
gesting that sex is something
adults ought to outgrow by
middle age (we never see either
of the other couples making
love).
The entire Nick-Annie-Ginny
subplot is a set-up that doesn't
make sense. Nick is treated by
his friends as a callous son of a
bitch because he has dumped
Annie, but five minutes of Sandy
Dennis' methody whine makes
you wonder what took him so
long. Our first glimpses of Gin
ny are colored by the wide-eyed
naivete and dumb-dumb
dialogue Alda has written for
her; we see her as Nick's
friends do — as a silly little girl
— because Alda paints her that
way. When she turns out to be
more sensible and intelligent
than anyone else, we're sup
posed to experience the same
revelation that they share, and
perhaps castigate ourselves,
too, for being so nearsighted,
but it's Alda who is guilty — of
dishonest screenwriting.
Alda keeps sending out mixed
signals about his characters:
they're ridiculous and yet their
ridiculousness is supposed to
touch us in some way.
Denny's paranoia is an object
of laughter until Ginny becomes
upset over the lightness with
which it's being treated by the
others, and then suddenly we're
supposed to feel the poignancy
of his fear.
The message is that friends
are a pain in the ass but we need
them to stave off loneliness in
our old age. Alda doesn't sug
gest that friends might serve
any nobler purpose — like being
supportive or providing intellec
tual stimulation or forcing us to
confront our weaknesses.
The only character in the film
who attempts to bring problems

out into the open is Jack, and he
is portrayed as so self-right
eous, judgmental and repressed
that Alda clearly doesn't expect
us to applaud his efforts —
which are immediately rejected
by the others.
In the 1976 Vincent, Francois,
Paul and the Others, Claude
Sautet showed us a similar band
of self-contented upper middle
class buddies trying to calm the
seas of inner turmoil; his com
passion for his characters and
the extraordinary grace with
which he choreographed the
pattern of their existence re
deemed the banality at the heart
of his conception. The Four Sea
sons, with its Kodak com
mercial tableaux of grown-ups
on vacation forcing themselves
to laugh at the childish fun
they're having, is in love with its
own banality.

The only character in the film
who attempts to bring problems

out into the open is Jack, and he
is portrayed as so self-right

that Alda clearly doesn't expect
us to applaud his efforts —
which are immediately rejected
by the others.
In the 1976 Vincent, Francois,
Paul and the Others, Claude
Sautet showed us a similar band
of self-contented upper middle
class buddies trying to calm the
seas of inner turmoil; his com

which he choreographed the
pattern of their existence re
deemed the banality at the heart

they're having, is in love with its
own banality.
The Four Seasons is about
three couples who vacation to
gether: Jack (Alan Alda), a
lawyer who is quick to judge
others but resistant to criticism
of himself, and who keeps his
temper under WASP-tight con
trol, and Kate (Carol Burnett),
a magazine editor; Danny (Jack
Weston), a dentist whose
thousand and one phobias are all
fronts for his fear of death, and
Claudia (Rita Moreno), a
painter; Nick (Len Cariou),
who throws over his wife Annie
(Sandy Dennis), whose creative
drive is stuck at vegetable pho
tography, for a younger, pret
tier stewardess, Ginny (Bess
Armstrong).
The movie, which was
scripted and directed by Alda,
pursues these people, who are
either insufferably dull or im
mensely irritating, through four
seasonal holidays — in a country

cottage in the spring, on a boat
in the summer, on a parents'
weekend at their children's col
lege in the fall, and skiing in the
winter — as Victor Kemper's
self-consciously picturesque
photography serves up the ap
propriate landscape and the fit
ting movement of Vivaldi's
Four Seasons pounds on the
soundtrack. (As one of my
friends complained, it's enough
to make you hate Vivaldi.)
The Four Seasons is the kind
of self-pitying, self-serving
comedy-drama no actor could
survive. It presents its charac
ters as boobs who get on each
other's nerves and then asks you
to love you them because they
are vulnerable and need each
other.
Most of the comedy is based
on their incompetence at the
various sports they attempt —
couldn't Alda think up some bet
ter comic ideas than the old

mired anchor and ski accident
ploys? — or on the obstacles
that their egos and obsessions
set up in the path of their friend
ship.
There's an antique sex farce
routine about the inability of
two of the couples to sleep at
night because Nick and Ginny's
lovemaking is so joyously loud.
The subtext of this gag is dis
turbing: Alda seems to be sug
gesting that sex is something
adults ought to outgrow by
middle age (we never see either
of the other couples making
love).
The entire Nick-Annie-Ginny
subplot is a set-up that doesn't
make sense. Nick is treated by
his friends as a callous son of a
bitch because he has dumped
Annie, but five minutes of Sandy
Dennis' methody whine makes
you wonder what took him so
long. Our first glimpses of Gin
ny are colored by the wide-eyed
naivete and dumb-dumb
dialogue Alda has written for
her; we see her as Nick's
friends do — as a silly little girl
— because Alda paints her that
way. When she turns out to be
more sensible and intelligent
than anyone else, we're sup
posed to experience the same
revelation that they share, and
perhaps castigate ourselves,
too, for being so nearsighted,
but it's Alda who is guilty — of
dishonest screenwriting.
Alda keeps sending out mixed
signals about his characters:
they're ridiculous and yet their
ridiculousness is supposed to
touch us in some way.
Denny's paranoia is an object
of laughter until Ginny becomes
upset over the lightness with
which it's being treated by the
others, and then suddenly we're
supposed to feel the poignancy
of his fear.
The message is that friends
are a pain in the ass but we need
them to stave off loneliness in
our old age. Alda doesn't sug
gest that friends might serve
any nobler purpose — like being
supportive or providing intellec
tual stimulation or forcing us to
confront our weaknesses.
