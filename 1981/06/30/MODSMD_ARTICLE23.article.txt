## Dance duet is tame without gusto 
### Cory Foster 
From the name of the com
pany, Strong Wind and Wild
Horses, we especially hope the
dancers will escape banality by
surpassing the energy and
dynamics suggested. And we
are doubly disappointed when
we find that they not only fail to
meet the energy of their name,
but they also lack any kind of
daring that would show that
they have found the confines of
their style. There is no story to
tell, no theme to follow, no
challenge to set us thinking.
Shirley Jenkins and Erik
Whitmyre have recently left
Bill Evans' Company to give
fuller expressions to their own
ideas. It is therefore curious
that several of the dances on
last Friday night's program
were originally choreographed
while the duet was still with Bill
Evans' group. Stylistically, the
more recent dances were not
that much different from
earlier ones. We must wonder if
the break with Bill Evans was
justified.
As an audience, we might for
give all the similarity in move
ment motifs in the dances if
Shirley and Erik could have
made the performance interest

ing enough with virtuosity. But
they had an off night and their
turns and leaps were often in
complete.
None of the pieces seemed to
make anything of their abilities.
Instead of carrying us away
through their dance, we
watched them trip into some
basic, easily avoided, traps of
dancing.
In general, they used facial
expression too much. To use this
device at all is dangerous, it
should be controlled if used at
all. With their indulgent and sor
rowful dance came the pained
and tight expression. All the
movement took on the quality of
the face, and of course it all
turned out to be the same. No
dynamics, no real feeling â€”
mush.
Another trap for Shirley and
Erik was the music. Their sig
nature piece, "Strong Wind and
Wild Horses" was done to a
Jean-Luc Ponty melody that we
have all heard, over and over
again. A nice melody with which
they danced very literally.
Practically each beat had a
step, and each crescendo in
sound had a crescendo in move

ment.
Predictable and boring. Cute
ness and anticipated repetition
were two other typical flaws.
Indigo, was one of the pieces
choreographed for Bill Evans
and meant for a larger group.
The music was old blues flavor
and the dance was lively and up
beat. But again, they brought
nothing new to the stage either
rhythmically or choreo
graphically. This piece, how
ever, had the advantage of dem
onstrating Shirley's prowess in
Jazz-dancing.
