Beheshti killed in Iran blast
Beirut, Lebanon — Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti, the
No. 2 man of Iran's revolutionary regime, and at least 25
others were killed Sunday by an explosion that blew up the
ruling Islamic Revolutionary Party's headquarters in
Tehran during a meeting of party leaders, Tehran Radio
has announced.
Others killed included Transport Minister Musa Kalan
tari and a number of members of the Majlis, the Iranian
parliament.
The government radio station said the bomb was planted
by "mercenaries connected to the U.S.A."
Beheshti, 52. was widely believed to be the most pow
erful active politician in Iran, second only to the ailing
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He was president of the
Iranian Supreme Court and was the leader of the Islamic
Republican Party, which controls the Majlis and the gov
ernment.
Since the overthrow of the late shah, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, in 1979, Beheshti gradually amassed political
power at the expense of his rival, Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr,
who was ousted as president just a week ago. Beheshti was
widely believed to be the man most responsible for Bani-
Sadr's downfall.
China replaces Hua Guofeng
Peking — China's Communist Party yesterday formally
ended the era of Mao Tse-tung, replacing the late party
chairman's chosen heir, Hua Guofeng, with an advocate of
Deng Xiaoping's modernization campaign.
The party Central Committee issued a communique an

nouncing Hua's long-expected resignation as leader of the
party and his replacement by Hu Yaobang, 66, a close as
sociate of Vice Chairman Deng, China's most powerful
leader.
The chairmanship switch amounts to a seal of approval
by the party leaders on Deng's political alignment with the
West and his efforts to strengthen China's economy and
forge a modern nation.
Deng's leadership has tried to cast aside what it de
scribed as Mao's unrealistic economic policies in favor of
trying to improve living standards and ending divisive po
litical policies.
Hua, criticized for adherence to the now-discarded
Maoist line, was demoted to party vice chairman, ap
parently the most junior of six such posts. He has been
largely out of sight for past seven months.
Deng was named to another of Hua's posts — chairman
of the key military commission — a job that diplomatic
sources said he had been handling since November.
Reagan talks tough before NAACP
Denver — President Ronald Reagan, facing the most un
receptive audience since his inauguration, told the NAACP
yesterday that "government is no longer the strong draft
horse of minority progress."
After a restrained welcome from 5000 convention dele
gates and a scolding from their chairperson, the president
asserted that government aid programs to minorities have
failed and urged the civil rights group to "hitch up a fresh
horse" — namely free enterprise.
Reagan said his tax and budget cuts will "move us
toward black economic freedom because it is aimed at lift

ing the entire country and not just parts of it."
Margaret Bush Wilson, chairperson of the 400,000-mem
ber organization, introduced the president by declaring
that "the NAACP does not'necessarily subscribe to the
views that are about to be expressed."
She also noted the flap which surrounded then-candidate
Reagan last year when he failed, unlike the other major
White House contenders, to appear at the 1980 convention
of the National Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People — because his invitation had been misplaced.
Reagan, who was sitting on the platform, appeared non
plused when Wilson recalled, "There was some confusion
about our invitation to our honored guest last year as you
may remember, but then, he was only a candidate for the
presidency of the United States."
New leeway in Miranda warnings
Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday re
instated the murder conviction of a California man in a rul
ing that gives new leeway to police in advising suspects of
their rights before they are questioned.
The court ruled that police officers need not read the
precise words of the so-called "Miranda warning" before
interrogating a suspect as long as they make it clear that
the suspect has a right to a lawyer.
Today's weather
