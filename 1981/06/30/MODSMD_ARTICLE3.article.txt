# Californians urged to share 'brain power' technology

Calling this area's burgeon
ing computer science technolo
gy "a treasure envied by the en
tire world," French author and
theoretician Jean-Jaques
Servan-Schreiber said Friday
that California will play the key
role in "a revolution to engulf
the whole planet.
"You have invented the sci
ence of sciences. The challenge
is whether the west, led by Cali
fornia, will accept transfer of
technology — knowledge, not
hardware — all over the world
or whether, this being your last

treasure, you will keep it for
yourselves," he said.
Servan-Schreiber, a former
member of the French Radical
Party and author of The World
Challenge in which he argues in
favor of technology transfer, re
ceived a polite but often cool re
sponse from his Commonwealth
Club audience in San Francisco.
Conservative audience
He told the largely Re
publican group that the politics
of the current administration,
although not in line with his own
political feelings, are a "super
ficial thing" in relation to tech

nology transfer. Rather, he
claimed, the key point revolves
around the benefits to be gained
from the dissemination of in
formation on a global scale.
"Ten times more than oil or
gas or coal, the most valuable
resource is brainpower — it's
the only resource we need for
creativity and development,"
Servan-Schreiber said.
During the question and an
swer session, the audience tried
to pin down Servan-Schreiber to
a more specific analysis of the
benfeits to be gained from this
technology transfer.
One question involved the
capital intensive nature of com
puter technology which, its au
thor pointed out, would seem of
limited value to the Third
World's labor intensive econo
mies of which the French social
scientist spoke.
Servan-Schreiber responded,
"Cheap manpower does not ex
ist anymore except for robots.
Right now in California your sci
entists are tackling the problem
of how human beings are going
to be adapted to fit the new
challenge. The freedom from
drudgery gained by computers
will lead to creativity."
He linked the technology
transfer question to a world
economy currently experienc
ing severe problems and said

transfer represented "an inven
tion of the scope of the Roose
veltian invention of the '30s; the
only kind which can solve the
world-wide problem."
Another question centered on
how population control should
or could be linked to the author's
conception of the technology
revolution. He said that there
can be no such thing as popu

lation control imposed on il
literate countries because half
of most families' children die
and the families must continue
to reproduce in order to get
more workers who can help sup
port the unit.
Raising the level of existence
for residents of these Third
World countries will make this
practice unnecessary, he said.
Throughout the 40-minute
presentation, Servan-Schreiber
returned to the theme of Califor
nia as a "center of reconcil
iation for technology.
"The center of the debate is at
Stanford, at Berkeley, in Palo
Alto. It is also at MIT which I
guess should be in California,
too," he said, as the audience
laughed. "No other laboratories
in the world can surpass these
scientists.
