# Ground spraying on for Medflies
## 
### Andres Fajardo 
Mediterranean fruit fly mag
gots found Thursday and Friday
in the quarantined area of the
Peninsula, the first discovered
since January, move eradica
tion efforts into a new phase.
After the very promising
eradication month of May,
Medfly officials had predicted
that ground-based spraying
could have been finalized June
1. However, Jerry Scribner,
deputy director of the state De
partment of Food and Agricul
ture (DFA) and Medfly project
director, said Friday ground
spraying was to be renewed to
day.
In addition, Scribner stated
that the chances of using the
controversial aerial spraying of
the pesticide malathion were in
creased. "I will probably be
asking the Medfly technical
committee to return to Califor
nia , for an emergency meet
ing on the possibility of aerial
application."
According to Scribner, the
maggots were found in three
separate square-mile quadrants
of the quarantined area. On
Thursday, a maggot was found
in an apricot sample from
SI y A In IVfountjiin
View. On Friday, maggots were
found in fruit samples from
View Street in Mountain View
and on Templeton Drive in Sun
nyvale. Scribner described the
findings as "a real surprise and
a great disappointment. We nev
er found anything in those areas
before this. We have spent mil
lions in dollars, employed
thousands of people; it has been
a Herculean eradication effort,

but the fly is still breeding."
Scribner revealed that 43
female flies, no fertile males,
and many sterile flies have been
caught in traps. "Theoretically,
there should be no breeding, " he
said.
Scribner said that of the three
areas where the maggots were
found, the two Mountain View
sites belonged to the "Mountain
View Gap," an area which has
not had fruit stripping and re
moval. All three areas had not
been previously ground
sprayed.
The discoveries last week, as
Scribner told the Peninsula
Times Tribune, bring the Med
fly officials "closer to the de
cision on aerial spraying with
malathion." Earlier, Scribner
had said discovery of three or
more Medfly larvae "would be
compelling evidence that the
current effort cannot assure
eradication without the addition
of aerial application." Aerial
spraying was laid aside by the
state because of public outcry
and other methods of eradica
tion were employed.
Another occurence Friday
that affected the Medf\y pro
gram was the decision by the
(m 112 « DF*A to frt I it the*
quarantine site of Santa ciara
County to include southern San
Mateo County up to Redwood
City. This decision overrode the
3-2 (four abstensions) recom
mendation by the committee of
insect scientists that acts as ad
viser to the Medfly project
against enlarging the quaran
tine area. Scribner emphasized
that even though Redwood City
is not considered infested, and
that non-infested areas are
rarely quarantined, it was a
move to reassure such large
fruit customers as Texas and
Japan that every possibility was
being considered for eradicat
ing the Medfly.
Scribner outlined Friday the
effectiveness of the four meth
ods used so far in the attempt to
defeat the Medfly:
•Quarantine: "This has been
very successful. No maggots
have been found outside the new
quarantine area since the effort
began."
•Fruit removal: "The effec
tiveness of this is hard to say.
Most fertile fruit flies were
caught in the area from which
fruit had been removed because
the (Medfly's) pupae had al
ready dropped to the ground . "
•Ground spraying: "This
would appear to be very suc
cessful as we have not found any
maggots in areas that have been
sprayed." Scribner went on to
remark that 62,000 backyards
have been sprayed six times
each.
•Sterile fly release:"We really
don't know whether or not this is
working The theory is that if
you catch 100 sterile flies for ev
ery wild (fertile) one, then you
should be reaching eradication.
We have achieved that quota but
the signs do not show eradica
tion. We are in the process of
disproving that theory." Over
three billion sterile flies have
been released since July, 1980
(both ground release and aerial
release) with 4,000 traps having
been set.
