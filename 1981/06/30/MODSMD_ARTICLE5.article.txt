# Supreme Court studies Iranian hostage settlement
## Did Carter exceed the limits of presidential authority? 
### Los Angeles Times 
It may be the final irony of the presi
dency of Jimmy Carter. For most of his
tour years in the White House, Carter
found himselt denounced tor being too
weak a chief executive, particularly in
foreign affairs. Now. however, Ameri
can corporations are claiming that, dur
ing the final hours of his administration.
Carter stretched the powers of the presi
dency beyond their constitutional limits.
Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court
took up the question of whether Carter
exceeded his authority as president in
reaching the agreement that won the re
lease of the 52 American hostages trom
Iran. That settlement, signed in Algiers
just before Carter left office in January,
canceled all attachments tiled against
Iranian assets in the United States and
transferred from U.S. courts to an in
ternational tribunal the financial claims
ot American companies.
The American firms challenging this
agreement contend that Carter had no
right to agree to do this. Once their
claims against Iran were filed in U.S.
courts, these tirms say, the president
was powerless to stop them from pro
ceeding. The Supreme Court's decision
should be handed down fairly quickly,
probably within the next two to three
weeks.
The companies challenging the Carter
agreement are among the thousands ot
American fi/ms that rushed to do busi

ness with Iran in the mid-1970s when the
Shah of Iran and his government were
looking for ways to spend the billions of
dollars in oil revenues they were amass
ing. In 1979, atter the shah fled the coun
try, these tirms found it much harder to
operate in Iran, and the new revolu
tionary government sought to terminate
contracts with some American firms.
When Carter froze Iranian assets in
this country atter the seizure ot the
American hostages, many companies
went to court, seeking to attach these as
sets as guarantee of repayment for mon
ey they claimed was owed to them.
In the short run, the Supreme Court's
ruling will determine whether $3 billion
to $4 billion in American assets may be
transferred out of the United States. Un
der the terms of the Algiers agreement,
$1 billion in Iranian assets will go to the
international tribunal to help pay Ameri
can claims. The rest will revert to Iran,
which has agreed to replenish the tribun
al's funds whenever they fall below $500
million.
Presidential authority
In the long run, the Supreme Court de
cision could help determine just how far
a U.S. president's power extends in the
field of foreign relations. Does the presi
dent have broad constitutional authority
to regulate commercial transactions be
tween American companies and foreign
governments or corporations? If there
are limits on the president's authority,

can the line be drawn so that his ability to
resolve some pressing international
crisis is not handicapped?
It is not inconceivable that the Su
preme Court could place limits on the au
thority ot the president; it has done so
before. The most important and famous
instance was the court's 1952 ruling that
President Harry Truman overstepped
his constitutional powers when he took
over the nation's steel mills in an effort
to prevent a strike and maintain steel
output during the Korean War.
But the Reagan administration (which
decided after taking office to carry out
Carter's agreement with Iran and to de
fend it in court) has marshaled other pre
cedents. Department ot Justice lawyers
are arguing that the steel-seizure case
involved merely the president's author
ity over domestic affairs, not foreign re
lations — and, they say, the scope of the
president's constitutional authority in
the latter area is much greater.
Furthermore, the Department of Jus
tice's lawyers argue that presidents
have frequently acted to settle claims
disputes with foreign governments, and
the Supreme Court has repeatedly sus
tained such actions. In 1936 and in 1942,
the Supreme Court upheld the Litvinov
Pact, the executive agreement under
which President Franklin Roosevelt
granted diplomatic recognition to the So
viet Union.
The Supreme Court may try to avoid

deciding these broad constitutional ques
tions. A more limited question that the
justices will examine is whether
Carter's agreement was a legitimate ex
ercise ot the power Congress granted
him when it enacted the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Possible outcomes
If the Supreme Court upholds the Al
giers settlement, the American com
panies will lose their chance to attach
Iranian assets in the United States. Most
tirms would have to take their claims
against Iran to the international tribun
al.
If, on the other hand, the Supreme
Court rules that the Carter agreement
was invalid, the consequences could be
messy. The financial disputes between
the U.S. firms and Iran would remain un
resolved. The companies could try to go
forward in American courts.
The Algiers agreement would fall
apart, and Iran could argue that the Unit
ed States breached the agreement it ne
gotiated. Other nations with substantial
assets in the United States — Saudi Ara
bia, for example — might think twice
about the long-term safety of their hold
ings here. President Ronald Reagan
meanwhile, might find it harder to nego
tiate an agreement with a foreign gov
ernment.
Those concerns have prompted the
Reagan administration to defend
Carter's pact.

Iranian assets in the United States and
transferred from U.S. courts to an in
ternational tribunal the financial claims
ot American companies.
The American firms challenging this
agreement contend that Carter had no
right to agree to do this. Once their
claims against Iran were filed in U.S.
courts, these tirms say, the president
was powerless to stop them from pro
ceeding. The Supreme Court's decision
should be handed down fairly quickly,
probably within the next two to three
weeks.
The companies challenging the Carter
agreement are among the thousands ot
American fi/ms that rushed to do busi

ness with Iran in the mid-1970s when the
Shah of Iran and his government were
looking for ways to spend the billions of
dollars in oil revenues they were amass
ing. In 1979, atter the shah fled the coun
try, these tirms found it much harder to
operate in Iran, and the new revolu
tionary government sought to terminate
contracts with some American firms.
When Carter froze Iranian assets in
this country atter the seizure ot the
American hostages, many companies
went to court, seeking to attach these as
sets as guarantee of repayment for mon
ey they claimed was owed to them.
In the short run, the Supreme Court's
ruling will determine whether $3 billion
to $4 billion in American assets may be
transferred out of the United States. Un
der the terms of the Algiers agreement,
$1 billion in Iranian assets will go to the
international tribunal to help pay Ameri
can claims. The rest will revert to Iran,
which has agreed to replenish the tribun
al's funds whenever they fall below $500
million.
Presidential authority
In the long run, the Supreme Court de
cision could help determine just how far
a U.S. president's power extends in the
field of foreign relations. Does the presi
dent have broad constitutional authority
to regulate commercial transactions be
tween American companies and foreign
governments or corporations? If there
are limits on the president's authority,

can the line be drawn so that his ability to
resolve some pressing international
crisis is not handicapped?
It is not inconceivable that the Su
preme Court could place limits on the au
thority ot the president; it has done so
before. The most important and famous
instance was the court's 1952 ruling that
President Harry Truman overstepped
his constitutional powers when he took
over the nation's steel mills in an effort
to prevent a strike and maintain steel
output during the Korean War.
But the Reagan administration (which
decided after taking office to carry out
Carter's agreement with Iran and to de
fend it in court) has marshaled other pre
cedents. Department ot Justice lawyers
are arguing that the steel-seizure case
involved merely the president's author
ity over domestic affairs, not foreign re
lations — and, they say, the scope of the
president's constitutional authority in
the latter area is much greater.
Furthermore, the Department of Jus
tice's lawyers argue that presidents
have frequently acted to settle claims
disputes with foreign governments, and
the Supreme Court has repeatedly sus
tained such actions. In 1936 and in 1942,
the Supreme Court upheld the Litvinov
Pact, the executive agreement under
which President Franklin Roosevelt
granted diplomatic recognition to the So
viet Union.
The Supreme Court may try to avoid

deciding these broad constitutional ques
tions. A more limited question that the
justices will examine is whether
Carter's agreement was a legitimate ex
ercise ot the power Congress granted
him when it enacted the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Possible outcomes
If the Supreme Court upholds the Al
giers settlement, the American com
panies will lose their chance to attach
Iranian assets in the United States. Most
tirms would have to take their claims
against Iran to the international tribun
al.
If, on the other hand, the Supreme
Court rules that the Carter agreement
was invalid, the consequences could be
messy. The financial disputes between
the U.S. firms and Iran would remain un
resolved. The companies could try to go
forward in American courts.
The Algiers agreement would fall
apart, and Iran could argue that the Unit
ed States breached the agreement it ne
gotiated. Other nations with substantial
assets in the United States — Saudi Ara
bia, for example — might think twice
about the long-term safety of their hold
ings here. President Ronald Reagan
meanwhile, might find it harder to nego
tiate an agreement with a foreign gov
ernment.
Those concerns have prompted the
Reagan administration to defend
Carter's pact.
It may be the final irony of the presi
dency of Jimmy Carter. For most of his
tour years in the White House, Carter
found himselt denounced tor being too
weak a chief executive, particularly in
foreign affairs. Now. however, Ameri
can corporations are claiming that, dur
ing the final hours of his administration.
Carter stretched the powers of the presi
dency beyond their constitutional limits.
Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court
took up the question of whether Carter
exceeded his authority as president in
reaching the agreement that won the re
lease of the 52 American hostages trom
Iran. That settlement, signed in Algiers
just before Carter left office in January,
canceled all attachments tiled against
Iranian assets in the United States and
transferred from U.S. courts to an in
ternational tribunal the financial claims
ot American companies.
