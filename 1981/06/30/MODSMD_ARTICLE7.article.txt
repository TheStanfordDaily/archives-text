# S. Africa jails press, labor leaders

Johannesburg â€” South
African authorities detained
two black journalists and
searched the house of another
last week in what appeared to be
another crackdown on the
black-oriented press and the
black journalists union, the Me
dia Workers Association of
South Africa.
The new clampdown also ap
peared to be aimed at student
opposition leaders.
South African police arrested
Zwelakhe Sisulu, former presi
dent of MWASA and former
news editor of the black-ori
ented Sunday Post, and Wantu
Zcntile, president of the Con.
gress of South African Students.
The Sunday Post and its com
panion paper, the Post, were
closed by the authorities in Jan
uary, a month after Sisulu and
another MWASA leader,
Marimuthu Subramoney, were
issued government "banning"
orders that prevent them from
working as journalists tor three
years.
The day before the arrest of
Sisulu, police searched the
Soweto home of Willie Bokala,
who is copy editor on the Post's

successor, the Sowetan, and a
MWASA member.
Also that week, the Sowetan's
news editor, Thami Mazwai,
who is national secretary of
MWASA, was arrested by police
at a friend's house in the Orlan
do west township near Johan
nesburg. A group of white and
black trade unions condemned
Mazwai's detention as part of an
"onslaught" against unions that
constituted a "tacit admission
by the government of the labor
movement's effectiveness."
Several other union leaders are
currently being held without
trial.

The arrests of labor leaders
appear to reflect a growing re
alization by the white-minority
government of the increasing
power wielded by the black la
bor unions.
Black workers have gone on
strike with regularity in South
Africa over the past two years in
such important economic sec
tors as the auto industry, win
ning concessions and in some
cases recognition from com
pany management. However,
relatively few of the labor or
ganizations have been allowed
to register with the authorities
and thus gain official recogni
tion.
