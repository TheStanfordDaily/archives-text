# Communists' influence to be negligible
## French pro—NATO shift likely 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — The foreign policy of
France under its new Socialist
government is going to be more
clearly defined and more openly
stated, more visibly pro-NATO
and more actively in search of
improved relations with the
Third World.
Therefore, diplomatic ob
servers here said, it is expected
to be a more positive foreign
policy from the standpoint of the
United States. The inclusion of
four Communists in the new
Cabinet appears to have caused
the Reagan administration to
question what kind of ally

France is going to be under
President Francois Mitterrand.
But if Washington is having
trouble reading Paris these
days, the Kremlin must be just
as confused.
The French Communist Par
ty has been forced to give up a
succession of hard-line, pro-
Moscow foriegn policy positions
in order to gain admission to the
Socialist Cabinet. As a conse
quence, the Soviet Union was
last to applaud that develop
ment, even though it is the first
time since 1947 that Com
munists have been admitted to a
Western European government.
"In terms of the Atlantic Al
liance, the United States cannot
have a more reliable partner
than France," the new minister
of external relations, Claude
Cheysson, has said.
Gone, then, are the days of
former President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing's hesitant
and leisurely response to the So
viet invasion of Afghanistan and
his surprise meeting soon after
ward in Warsaw with Leonid
Brezhnev, the Soviet leader.
Moreover, the French Com
munists, who endorsed the Af
ghan venture in 1980, are now
part of a government demand
ing Soviet withdrawal.
Gone, also, it would appear,
are the days when France's re
lationship with its allies in the
North Atlantic Treaty Or

ganization involved endless
diplomatic haggling. Charles de
Gaulle instilled in France an
anti-NATO virus that subsided
only gradually under Giscard
d'Estaing but seems now to
have been eliminated.
This does not mean that
France under a Socialist presi
dent is about to reenter the
NATO military structure or
again place its forces in West
Germany under NATO com
mand. But it does appear to
mean that there will be a great
deal more cooperation from
France.
Under the new regime Mitter
rand will be the supreme au
thority in foreign policy mat
ters, but the minister of ex
ternal relations — a new title
given to Cheysson's position —
will be the active formulator
and guiding hand in the conduct
of foreign affairs.
Cheysson has about him none
of the anti-Americanism that
has often poisoned Franco-
American relations.
The fact that there are Com
munsits in the French govern
ment is expected to have no ef
fect at all on French foreign pol
icy. If anything, the way Mitter
rand has brought the Com
munists into his government —
on his terms — can be expected
to strengthen Cheysson's hand
in taking a hardline with the So
viet Union.
