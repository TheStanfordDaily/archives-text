# Food service up 10 percent in fall
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
Whenever food is involved,
things only seem to go one way
— up, whether it be your waist
line measurements or your
blood pressure or your favorite
souffle.
Unfortunately, it's the same
for the University this year, too,
except that its list includes food
costs, wages and salaries, re
pairs, maintenance and over
head which is prompting — you
guessed it — a rise in this fall's
student board bills.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner
every day and brunch and din
ner on weekends will cost $5%
this autumn, a 10 percent jump
from last year's $540 "A" plan.
Edward Scoles, director of
housing and food service, called
the increase "inevitable" as
food service costs have risen
and the upward trend is ex
pected to continue in 1981-82.
"We expected that food
prices would probably go up by
12 percent; a labor contract will
raise labor costs by eight per
cent, plus a further cost of living
increase in November will bring
the total hike to 11 percent. Re
pair costs should rise at 10 to 12
percent and other auxiliaries
such as utilities could rise by as
much as 25 percent," said
Scoles.
There seems to be no way to
avoid the high cost of food ser
vice in its present form. Stu
dents living in dorms have some
leeway in their personal costs —
they may buy only lunch and
dinner ("B" plan). Row resi
dents may opt for a special 10
meal per week program ("C"
plan). The price seems rather

steep as plans will range from
$6.83 to $8.87 per student per
day, but Scoles still called it "a
good deal.
"It's a heck of a deal for the
price. There is a choice of en
trees, salad, juices, etc. If
you tried to buy the same
amount at Tresidder, you
couldn't come close to it for the
price," he said.
Whether or not you agree with
Scole's definition of a good deal,
Maxine Anderson, food service
manager, said the quality of
food used "is not prime, but
very close to it.
"We don't want to lower qual
ities or standards used, espe
cially at the prices paid for
board," she said, adding that
food service does attempt to of
fer the best quality at the lowest
possible prices.
Revenue from summer con
ferences is also used to sub
sidize the regular year's hous
ing and food service. But with
food costs of $27 a day per con
ferree for the conferences, stu
dents only benefit by about $10
per student per year for food
and board from this program.
What, then can be done to
lessen the burden on the stu
dent? Suggestions have in
cluded making food service op
tional, or having a cafeteria
style operation, in which stu
dents pay for each item they
consume. Both Scoles and Norm
Robinson, the Associate Dean of
Residential Education, how
ever, emphasize the importance
of residential education here
and want meals included in the
overall format of the Univer
sity's living arrangements.
