# Mao criticized by Chinese
## 
### 
From The Daily Wire Services
Beijing — The Chinese Com
munist Party,symbolically
closing the door on an era of rev
olutionary turmoil, issued an
historic document Tuesday con
demning the "gross mistakes"
of the late Mao Tse-tung and re
dedicating itself to building "a
modern socialist China.''
The report drafted by the Cen
tral Committee after months of
divisive debate criticizes the
party for failing to check Mao's
power, condemns Mao's Cul
tural Revolution, rebukes Hua
Guafong, his hand-picked suc
cessor, and places the party
firmly on the path of the new re
form measures guiding China
today.
Coming as it did, a day before
the party's 60th anniversary and
a day after the ousting of party
chairman Hua, the document
was being hailed by Chinese of
ficials as a seminal treatise.
The most significant sections
of the 119-page document deal
with Mao's legacy. This is the
first time China's fractious
leadership has rendered an "of
ficial" judgment on the man
who founded the Chinese Com
munist Party 60 years ago, led it
to victory in 1949 and then ruled
the nation until his death in 1976.
Mao's policies criticized
Although the report criticizes
Mao for policies as far back as
1957, it saves its harshest
censure for the "gross mis
takes" he made in leading the
Cultural Revolution, a dis
astrous 10-year campaign
aimed at reinjecting revolu
tionary vigor in a party Mao felt
had grown slothful and dec
adent.
The movement that per
secuted thousands of party of

ficials and threw the nation into
chaos before it ended in 1976
"was responsible for the most
severe setback and heaviest
losses suffered by the party, the
state and the people since the
founding of the People's Re
public," the document said.
A consensus on the issue has
been extremely difficult to
achieve because a large number
of officials still in the military
and bureaucracy prospered dur
ing the upheaval and fear that a
condemnation of Mao's role, in
effect, jeopardizes their current
positions.
Although even the most loyal
Maoists were willing to concede
in general terms that the Cul
tural Revolution had been a dis
aster, they resisted inner-party
moves to criticize specific inci
dents that could have exposed
their own roles during the peri
od, according to diplomatic
sources with good Chinese con
tacts.
Pragmatists
Countering this so-called lef
tist bloc were those who had suf
fered grievously — intellec
tuals, scientists, veteran
cadres, and particularly some
of the pragmatists now running
China such as Vice Chairman
Deng Xiaoping.
Deng, who was purged from
power by Mao, is now the domi
nant political force in China.
Significantly the document
portrays him as having been the
spokesman of "correct leader
ship" all along.
Monday's ouster of Hua and
Tuesday's reassessment of
Mao's place in revolutionary
history cap a four-year drive by
Deng to de-emphasize ideology
and put China on a more prag
matic course of industrial mod

ernization. Hua was replaced as
chairman by party General Sec
retary Hu Yaobang, a close as
sociate of Deng.
The document issued Tuesday
represents a compromise, re
proaching Mao for his "entirely
erroneous appraisal" of China's
political situation at the time,
for "his personal arbitrariness"
that shut out debate in the party
and for giving power to his wife,
Jiang Qing, and her "Gang of
Four" associates.
But the criticism stops short
of analyzing specific events and
concludes that Mao's Cultural
Revolution "was the error of a
great proleterian revolutionary
. . . who confused right and
wrong and the people with the
enemy."
Successes noted
Noting his success as a liber
ation fighter, founder of the par
ty and the author of a Marxisit
theoretical school, the docu
ment said, "If we judge his ac
tivities as a whole, his contribu
tions to the Chinese revolution
far outweigh his mistakes."
The Central Committee, the
party's most important repre
sentative body, further
mitigated Mao's role by shifting
partial blame to the party itself.
It said the party had failed to
stop "overconcentration of
power" in the hands of one man.
In an extraordinary self
criticism for a ruling com
munist regime, the report as
serted that "our party has both
the courage to acknowledge and
correct its mistakes and the
detrermination and ability to
prevent repetition of serious
mistakes of the past. It is im
permissable to overlook or
whitewash mistakes.

Pragmatists

From The Daily Wire Services
Beijing — The Chinese Com
munist Party,symbolically
closing the door on an era of rev
olutionary turmoil, issued an
historic document Tuesday con
demning the "gross mistakes"
of the late Mao Tse-tung and re
dedicating itself to building "a
modern socialist China.''
The report drafted by the Cen
tral Committee after months of
divisive debate criticizes the
party for failing to check Mao's
power, condemns Mao's Cul
tural Revolution, rebukes Hua
Guafong, his hand-picked suc
cessor, and places the party
firmly on the path of the new re
form measures guiding China
today.
Coming as it did, a day before
the party's 60th anniversary and
a day after the ousting of party
chairman Hua, the document
was being hailed by Chinese of
ficials as a seminal treatise.
The most significant sections
of the 119-page document deal
with Mao's legacy. This is the
first time China's fractious
leadership has rendered an "of
ficial" judgment on the man
who founded the Chinese Com
munist Party 60 years ago, led it
to victory in 1949 and then ruled
the nation until his death in 1976.
Mao's policies criticized
Although the report criticizes
Mao for policies as far back as
1957, it saves its harshest
censure for the "gross mis
takes" he made in leading the
Cultural Revolution, a dis
astrous 10-year campaign
aimed at reinjecting revolu
tionary vigor in a party Mao felt
had grown slothful and dec
adent.
The movement that per
secuted thousands of party of

ficials and threw the nation into
chaos before it ended in 1976
"was responsible for the most
severe setback and heaviest
losses suffered by the party, the
state and the people since the
founding of the People's Re
public," the document said.
A consensus on the issue has
been extremely difficult to
achieve because a large number
of officials still in the military
and bureaucracy prospered dur
ing the upheaval and fear that a
condemnation of Mao's role, in
effect, jeopardizes their current
positions.
Although even the most loyal
Maoists were willing to concede
in general terms that the Cul
tural Revolution had been a dis
aster, they resisted inner-party
moves to criticize specific inci
dents that could have exposed
their own roles during the peri
od, according to diplomatic
sources with good Chinese con
tacts.
