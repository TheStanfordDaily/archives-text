# Trails provide paths to better bicycling

Stanford's campus abounds in
bike paths, those paved trails
separated from auto traffic.
Roads in most other places have
bike lanes, a shoulder of the
road separated from traffic by a
white line and the words "bikes
only" painted on the lane.
Riding out Campus Drive op
posite Wilbur Hall, the bike path
that turns onto Bowdoln Avenue
leads to the University's resi
dential area. The area is criss
crossed with paved paths for pe
destrians. These are often un
suitable for bikes because of
their roughness, narrowness
and tendency to lead seemingly
nowhere. It may be a good idea
to stay on the road here.
Continuing through this resi
dential area leads to Page Mill
Road, the southern boundary of
campus. The Industrial parks of

Hewlett-Packard (HP) and
Varian Associates open their
gates on weekdays, and the cas
ual biker can take a spin around
their grounds. Varian has green
lawns and a fountain; HP is
mostly asphalt, with a beautiful
view of the foothills.
Back on campus, a small park
amongst the faculty houses pro
vides bikers with a spot to stop
and rest, stroll and admire the
view.
To get there, one follows May
field Avenue from Campus
Drive away from the post office.
The road eventually veers to the
right and up a large hill.
Turning right at Cedro Way
brings one up a sharp incline. At
the top is the circular Lathrop
Drive, and the park is in the
middle of it. Lock bikes to the
trees near the playground and
walk up to the highest point for a

spectacular view of the hills.
The amateur biker can make
several trips off campus in any
where from a couple of hours to
an entire day. About half an
hour from campus is the Palo
Alto Baylands, 1500 acres of
public recreation area next to
the 23,000-acre National Wild
life Refuge.
The Baylands offer a duck
pond, a nature interpretive cen
ter and a system of boardwalks
across the marsh. The
boardwalks are owned by
PG&E but are available for pe
destrian use.
Getting to the Baylands is an

easy, three-mile trip along Em
barcadero Road. The sidewalks
along Embarcadero are desig
nated bike paths, but one must
be watchful for pedestrians. At
W. Bayshore Road, just past the
entrance to Highway 101, bi
cycles use a bike lane until the
entrance to the area to the left
at the end of the road.
Few people visit the area on
weekdays, and any amateur bi
cyclist can make the trip.
Another six-mile round trip,
frequented by at least one stu
dent bicyclist, is Alameda de las
Pulgas. This route offers nu
merous side roads. Several of

fer views of the Bay from the
top.
Alameda de las Pulgas is ac
tually the continuation of
Junipero Serra Boulevard on the
north side of Sand Hill Road.
From the intersection of Cam
pus Drive and Mayfield Avenue,
one follows Mayfield west
toward Highway 280, turns right
on Junipero Serra, then bears
right onto Santa Cruz Avenue.
This leads to an intersection in
which Willow Road, on the
right, becomes Sand Hill road.
Pursuing straight through the
intersection, Santa Cruz Avenue
veers off to the right, along with
its bike route. Alameda de las
Pulgas picks up the straight
way. Bikes and cars share the
roadway, but the road is wide in
the most trafficked areas.
Past Bud's Ice Cream and
The Dutch Goose tavern, two
student hangouts, the biker
rides through a rural area in
Atherton along wooded lands be
tween foothills and horse
pastures. The pastures are
golden and dried now, a beau
tiful sight above the blue Bay.
Three miles down the road,
just past Woodside Road (High
way 84), Alameda becomes nar
row, windy and fairly unsafe for
bicyclists. Amateurs of all
levels can make this trip, al
though it is more difficult than
the Baylands possibly because
of hills and having to share the
roadway with cars.
This next, longer route is best
for more experienced bikers, al
though anyone can do it with
enough time and water. This is
an 18-mile loop right off campus
that really lets one "get away"
for a few hours. It begins at
Alpine Road, which is at the end
of Junipero Serra Boulevard,
where that boulevard becomes
Santa Cruz Avenue. Instead of

bearing right to get onto Santa
Cruz, one turns around to the
left and is on Alpine Road.
Six miles later, Alpine Road
turns right and becomes Portola
Road, in Portola Valley, a
cool, wooded area. In another
six miles, Portola Road turns
left, but the bike route goes
straight onto Sand Hill Road. A
last six-mile stretch brings one
to the intersection with Santa
Cruz Avenue. To the right will
be Junipero Serra and soon the
left turn onto Campus Drive.
Biking gear
For longer routes, Bicycle
Outfitters, at 973 Fremont Ave.
in Los Altos, suggest wearing
running shoes, shorts that are
long in the leg, and a loose-fit
ting cotton top. It is a good idea
to have some way to carry wa
ter and a water bottle with a
cage that fits on the bike frame
itself runs about $8.
Bike shops also recommend
that bikers who take regular
trips carry basic tools — such as
spare tube, tire pump, patch kit
and tire irons — and know how
to use them. Bicycle Outfitters
has a Tube and Lube clinic Sat
urday mornings at 9 a.m. for $2
to teach repair skills. Persons
interested should call to reg
ister.

merous side roads. Several of

fer views of the Bay from the
top.
Alameda de las Pulgas is ac
tually the continuation of
Junipero Serra Boulevard on the
north side of Sand Hill Road.
From the intersection of Cam
pus Drive and Mayfield Avenue,
one follows Mayfield west
toward Highway 280, turns right
on Junipero Serra, then bears
right onto Santa Cruz Avenue.
This leads to an intersection in
which Willow Road, on the
right, becomes Sand Hill road.
Pursuing straight through the
intersection, Santa Cruz Avenue
veers off to the right, along with
its bike route. Alameda de las
Pulgas picks up the straight
way. Bikes and cars share the
roadway, but the road is wide in
the most trafficked areas.
Past Bud's Ice Cream and
The Dutch Goose tavern, two
student hangouts, the biker
rides through a rural area in
Atherton along wooded lands be
tween foothills and horse
pastures. The pastures are
golden and dried now, a beau
tiful sight above the blue Bay.
Three miles down the road,
just past Woodside Road (High
way 84), Alameda becomes nar
row, windy and fairly unsafe for
bicyclists. Amateurs of all
levels can make this trip, al
though it is more difficult than
the Baylands possibly because
of hills and having to share the
roadway with cars.
This next, longer route is best
for more experienced bikers, al
though anyone can do it with
enough time and water. This is
an 18-mile loop right off campus
that really lets one "get away"
for a few hours. It begins at
Alpine Road, which is at the end
of Junipero Serra Boulevard,
where that boulevard becomes
Santa Cruz Avenue. Instead of

bearing right to get onto Santa
Cruz, one turns around to the
left and is on Alpine Road.
Six miles later, Alpine Road
turns right and becomes Portola
Road, in Portola Valley, a
cool, wooded area. In another
six miles, Portola Road turns
left, but the bike route goes
straight onto Sand Hill Road. A
last six-mile stretch brings one
to the intersection with Santa
Cruz Avenue. To the right will
be Junipero Serra and soon the
left turn onto Campus Drive.
Biking gear
For longer routes, Bicycle
Outfitters, at 973 Fremont Ave.
in Los Altos, suggest wearing
running shoes, shorts that are
long in the leg, and a loose-fit
ting cotton top. It is a good idea
to have some way to carry wa
ter and a water bottle with a
cage that fits on the bike frame
itself runs about $8.
Bike shops also recommend
that bikers who take regular
trips carry basic tools — such as
spare tube, tire pump, patch kit
and tire irons — and know how
to use them. Bicycle Outfitters
has a Tube and Lube clinic Sat
urday mornings at 9 a.m. for $2
to teach repair skills. Persons
interested should call to reg
ister.
Stanford's campus abounds in
bike paths, those paved trails
separated from auto traffic.
Roads in most other places have
bike lanes, a shoulder of the
road separated from traffic by a
white line and the words "bikes
only" painted on the lane.
Riding out Campus Drive op
posite Wilbur Hall, the bike path
that turns onto Bowdoln Avenue
leads to the University's resi
dential area. The area is criss
crossed with paved paths for pe
destrians. These are often un
suitable for bikes because of
their roughness, narrowness
and tendency to lead seemingly
nowhere. It may be a good idea
to stay on the road here.
Continuing through this resi
dential area leads to Page Mill
Road, the southern boundary of
campus. The Industrial parks of

Hewlett-Packard (HP) and
Varian Associates open their
gates on weekdays, and the cas
ual biker can take a spin around
their grounds. Varian has green
lawns and a fountain; HP is
mostly asphalt, with a beautiful
view of the foothills.
Back on campus, a small park
amongst the faculty houses pro
vides bikers with a spot to stop
and rest, stroll and admire the
view.
To get there, one follows May
field Avenue from Campus
Drive away from the post office.
The road eventually veers to the
right and up a large hill.
Turning right at Cedro Way
brings one up a sharp incline. At
the top is the circular Lathrop
Drive, and the park is in the
middle of it. Lock bikes to the
trees near the playground and
walk up to the highest point for a

spectacular view of the hills.
The amateur biker can make
several trips off campus in any
where from a couple of hours to
an entire day. About half an
hour from campus is the Palo
Alto Baylands, 1500 acres of
public recreation area next to
the 23,000-acre National Wild
life Refuge.
The Baylands offer a duck
pond, a nature interpretive cen
ter and a system of boardwalks
across the marsh. The
boardwalks are owned by
PG&E but are available for pe
destrian use.
Getting to the Baylands is an

easy, three-mile trip along Em
barcadero Road. The sidewalks
along Embarcadero are desig
nated bike paths, but one must
be watchful for pedestrians. At
W. Bayshore Road, just past the
entrance to Highway 101, bi
cycles use a bike lane until the
entrance to the area to the left
at the end of the road.
Few people visit the area on
weekdays, and any amateur bi
cyclist can make the trip.

frequented by at least one stu
dent bicyclist, is Alameda de las
Pulgas. This route offers nu
