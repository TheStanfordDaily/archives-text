## Take your last look at pre-MX Nevada 
### 
If you're traveling overland
this summer between Salt Lake
City and Northern California,
and you have a few extra hours
and miles to burn, treat yourself
to something different. Just out
side of Wendover, where 1-80
meets the Nevada-Utah border
and comes up out of the Great
Salt Lake Desert, it intersects
U.S. 93. Head south on 93 and
then turn west when you in
tersect U.S. 50 at Ely.
This route provides a close-up
view of places like McGill. Ely,
Eureka. Austin, Fernlev, and
Fallon, towns that are full of
small-town Americans who run
ranches, cut hair, work for the
railroad, pump gas, buy grocer
ies, and hunt deer.
There is an abundance of
beautiful and desolate territory
on both sides of the two-lane
highway. Being surrounded by
all this land is what makes Ne
vada's small towns unique.
Take a good look around,
breathe the air, talk to some of
the people, listen to the quiet
desert.
The next time you pass
through, those places may be
profoundly changed.
Before traveling this route, I
had in my mind a picture of Ne
vada terrain as a flat and barren
wasteland, dotted with a few In
dian reservations, rattlesnakes
and nuclear test sites.
But just out of Wendover,
U.S. 93 climbs up to White Horse
Pass, the first of several sum
mits over six thousand feet you
must mount en route to Califor
nia. You find all along the way
that you are either crossing
mountains or gazing at them
from a valley floor. It is lovely
dark brown, dark green, sun
dried country, full of sage and
grasses and silence.
Approaching McGill, in the
eastern part of the state, my
friend and I wereaware of a tall
smokestack which, when we
passed through, was spewing a
foul-looking effluent that
clashed with the clear blue sky.
Even though the plume was
very narrow and didn't seem to
be settling on the town, it was
still unnerving there in the
middle of the desert.
When we stopped for gas in
town I asked the man who
helped us what it was.
"Copper refinery," he re
plied, and I remembered hear

ing about the prodigious
amounts of pollution these
plants generated. I told him I
was surprised the government
hadn't put this place out of busi
ness.
"Well, the copper here is all
gone," he said, "but they're still
in business — they refine ore
they bring in from other
places."
I thought that was pretty
harsh, having to put up with the
bad end of someone else's cop
per ore.
"We don't mind, it brings jobs
to this county."
Had they ever noticed any ill
effects on the health of the folks
in McGill?
"Not that I ever heard of," he
assured me, and, pointing to the
stack, frowning, he added:
"That doesn't bother me —
what bothers me is that MX
missile."
Suddenly the smokestack
looked much less offensive.
'' I guess they're going to put it
over there somewhere," the gas
station man said, waving
toward the eastern hills. "Some
beautiful country up there . . .
deer, rabits, bobcats, coyotes
... be a real shame to tear it
up."
As we followed the setting sun
west on U.S. 50, trying to outrun
dusk, we kept our eyes open not
only for cattle, known to stray
from unfenced land onto the
road, but also for deer and rab
bits. Standing outside the car to
take pictures, we wondered if,
20 years hence, we'd be
able to hear the whirr of an un
derground railroad.
We wondered why it's neces
sary to build a transportable
missile system when the idea is
not to use the things anyway. I
daresay the gas station man
would concur that if we're not
going to use them, they might
just as well be stationary. I
guess there are empires to be
built and tinker toys to be made
for the little boys in Washing
ton.
Surrounded by the over
whelming desert silence, I de
cided to recommend the trip, so
that other people would become
convinced that there is no good
reason to interrupt that peace
ful absence of sound.

If you're traveling overland
this summer between Salt Lake
City and Northern California,
and you have a few extra hours
and miles to burn, treat yourself
to something different. Just out
side of Wendover, where 1-80
meets the Nevada-Utah border
and comes up out of the Great
Salt Lake Desert, it intersects
U.S. 93. Head south on 93 and
then turn west when you in
tersect U.S. 50 at Ely.
This route provides a close-up
view of places like McGill. Ely,
Eureka. Austin, Fernlev, and
Fallon, towns that are full of
small-town Americans who run
ranches, cut hair, work for the
railroad, pump gas, buy grocer
ies, and hunt deer.
There is an abundance of
beautiful and desolate territory
on both sides of the two-lane
highway. Being surrounded by
all this land is what makes Ne
vada's small towns unique.
Take a good look around,
breathe the air, talk to some of
the people, listen to the quiet
desert.
The next time you pass
through, those places may be
profoundly changed.
Before traveling this route, I
had in my mind a picture of Ne
vada terrain as a flat and barren
wasteland, dotted with a few In
dian reservations, rattlesnakes
and nuclear test sites.
But just out of Wendover,
U.S. 93 climbs up to White Horse
Pass, the first of several sum
mits over six thousand feet you
must mount en route to Califor
nia. You find all along the way
that you are either crossing
mountains or gazing at them
from a valley floor. It is lovely
dark brown, dark green, sun
dried country, full of sage and
grasses and silence.
Approaching McGill, in the
eastern part of the state, my
friend and I wereaware of a tall
smokestack which, when we
passed through, was spewing a
foul-looking effluent that
clashed with the clear blue sky.
Even though the plume was
very narrow and didn't seem to
be settling on the town, it was
still unnerving there in the
middle of the desert.
When we stopped for gas in
town I asked the man who
helped us what it was.
"Copper refinery," he re
plied, and I remembered hear

ing about the prodigious
amounts of pollution these
plants generated. I told him I
was surprised the government
hadn't put this place out of busi
ness.
"Well, the copper here is all
gone," he said, "but they're still
in business — they refine ore
they bring in from other
places."
I thought that was pretty
harsh, having to put up with the
bad end of someone else's cop
per ore.
"We don't mind, it brings jobs
to this county."
Had they ever noticed any ill
effects on the health of the folks
in McGill?
"Not that I ever heard of," he
assured me, and, pointing to the
stack, frowning, he added:
"That doesn't bother me —
what bothers me is that MX
missile."
Suddenly the smokestack
looked much less offensive.
'' I guess they're going to put it
over there somewhere," the gas
station man said, waving
toward the eastern hills. "Some
beautiful country up there . . .
deer, rabits, bobcats, coyotes
... be a real shame to tear it
up."
As we followed the setting sun
west on U.S. 50, trying to outrun
dusk, we kept our eyes open not
only for cattle, known to stray
from unfenced land onto the
road, but also for deer and rab
bits. Standing outside the car to
take pictures, we wondered if,
20 years hence, we'd be
able to hear the whirr of an un
derground railroad.
We wondered why it's neces
sary to build a transportable
missile system when the idea is
not to use the things anyway. I
daresay the gas station man
would concur that if we're not
going to use them, they might
just as well be stationary. I
guess there are empires to be
built and tinker toys to be made
for the little boys in Washing
ton.
Surrounded by the over
whelming desert silence, I de
cided to recommend the trip, so
that other people would become
convinced that there is no good
reason to interrupt that peace
ful absence of sound.
