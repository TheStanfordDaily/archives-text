## Mark Kramer Think before arming China 
### 
During his recent visit to the People's Republic
of China (PRC), Secretary of State Alexander
Haig announced that the Reagan Administration
intends to lift existing restrictions on the sale of
military equipment to the PRC. Not surprisingly,
the announcement of such an important decision,
combined with the subsequent leak about a joint
ly-operated U.S.-Chinese electronic monitoring
station in western China, has touched off con
siderable debate in this country.
Clearly, there are good reasons for maintaining
strong, cooperative ties with the Chinese. China
serves as a valuable counter to Soviet ex
pansionism; China, along with Japan, is the most
important country in East Asia; and the Chinese
may eventually serve as a significant source of oil
and raw materials for the West.
Moreover, a strictly "even-handed" approach
vis-a-vis Moscow and Beijing is obviously no
longer feasible, and decisions on Sino-American
relations should, in general, be made on their own
merits and not be dictated by Soviet paranoia.
Nevertheless, it is not yet evident that selling
sophisticated weaponry is the best way either to
enhance our relations with the Chinese or to pro
mote China's security. There are a number of un
answered questions that must be taken into ac
count before any final decisions on sales are
made.
First, is it possible the Chinese may at some
time use American-supplied arms in ways
detrimental to U.S. interests? After all, no one ten
years ago would have predicted the formation of a
pseudo-alliance between the United States and
China, and it may well be that Chinese policy
could undergo an equally dramatic change within
the next ten years. Moreover, even now American
interests in East Asia do not always coincide with
those of the Chinese, as was exemplified by Chi
na's invasion of Vietnam in 1979.
Second, how likely is it that we might ex
perience a recurrence of the "Iran syndrome?"
When selling advanced weapons systems to a less
er-developed country such as China, the United
States almost inevitably finds that it must make a
broad commitment to the recipient's overall de
fense modernization program — by providing
technicians, advisers, spare parts, etc.
As a result, the U.S. government may become
extensively involved in the domestic politics of
the recipient nation and may also become identi
fied with a particular regime (in this case, with
that of Deng Xiaoping). The problem is that this
increased influence entails a greater risk of an
anti-American backlash if the current regime
should suddenly lose power or reverse its course.
Third, do we really feel that potential arms
sales can bolster China's security, or are we
merely playing a new version of the "China
card?" Unless U.S. policy is designed to recognize
China as important for its own sake, and not just
as a convenient anti-Soviet foil, we will be unable
to develop a solid and lasting foundation for Sino-
American ties.

Fourth, can we realistically assume that U.S.
supplies of arms to China would not be offset by a
Soviet countermove? It seems likely that the Sovi
ets would use a U.S.-China arms relationship as a
pretext for further building up their own force
levels along the Sino-Soviet border and strength
ening their garrisons on the Kuriles. The net re
suit might be decreased security for China in the
long term.
Fifth, if we proceed with military sales to Chi
na, will we risk losing the remainder of our
dwindling leverage over Moscow's policy in
Eastern Europe? Several observers have sug
gested that part of the reason for the Soviet's
hesitation in invading Poland has been their fear
that such an invasion might provoke expanded
military and strategic cooperation between China
and the West.
While any final decision on arms sales to China
should be based on many factors in addition to pos
sible Soviet reactions in Eastern Europe, we
should not ignore the fact that by actually going
ahead with the sales we will lose the leverage we
have had up until now of threatening to sell the
arms.
Sixth, how will possible sales affect China's
non-Communist neighbors? Given the history of
Chinese domination in East Asia, the sale of F-16s
or other high-performance aircraft to the PRC
may be perceived by Japan, South Korea, and oth
er American allies in the region as a potential
threat to their security. On the other hand, it may
well be that they would welcome such sales be
cause of their concerns about Soviet hegemonic
ambitions in the area. In either case, it is impor
tant that we obtain the viewpoints of all our allies
in the region.
Finally, how many and what kind of arms will
the United States be willing to sell and China be
willing to buy? Because the Chinese have limited
financial resources, they might want to make only
a symbolic purchase of two or three F-16s. In this
case, we would have to decide whether the sym
bolic significance of the sale outweighed the se
curity risk inherent in the transfer of such sophis
ticated aircraft. If, on the other hand, China
wanted to make much larger purchases, we would
have to give even closer scrutiny to the other ques
tions raised above.
It will be essential for the Reagan Adminis
tration to examine and answer each of these ques
tions before taking any further action on arms
sales to China. The decision to lift restrictions on
military sales was not a routine matter or "a nor
mal part of the process of improving our relations
there." It was, instead, a decision of critical im
portance, with potentially far-reaching implica
tions for U.S.-Soviet and Sino-Soviet relations.
That is why we must be particularly sure that
what appears expedient now will not become a
source of grave regret in the future.
