## Living with nukes: civil defense the key. . . 
### 
A nuclear war would be the
end of mankind! No one can win
a nuclear war! Civil defense is
useless!
None of these statements is
new. Not one of them is right.
But a related statement may be
new, surprising and correct.
Civil defense could well be the
cheapest, most humane and
most effective way to deter nu
clear war.
A 1975 study of the American
National Academy of Sciences
has shown that an all-out nucle
ar war between the two super
powers will leave the rest of the
world practically unscathed.
The opposite statement has
been proved only by endless rep
etition. The Soviets and I prefer
statements that are the result of
scientific analysis. However,
the American public seems to
be more strongly influenced by
prejudiced opinions. This situ
ation is not without its dangers.
If one considers the welfare of
all to be the highest good, then

surely no one can win a nuclear
war. Perhaps in that case, no
one can win any war. But there
are those for whom the highest
good is power. Our shrinking
globe is developing toward a
stage of interdependency in
which power is above the com
monweal.
An all-out nuclear war could
be the end of the United States
as a political entity, even as a
set of ideas; the Soviet
Union could emerge as the one
center where all essential de
cisions are made. In this sense,
the Soviets could win a nuclear
conflict.
That the Soviet Union could
survive and be the center of the
human universe in the horror
filled post-nuclear war era is
due to a great extent to one fac
tor: their preparedness in civil
defense. This alone could limit
the loss of human life in the So
viet Union to considerably less
than what they suffered in

World War 11, a fact in which the
Soviets take pride. The loss of
cities or harvests would be in
significant — the Soviets, if
their people and a few of their
weapons survived, could de
mand and get food, machinery,
whatever they needed to re
establish themselves. The Sovi
et empire not only would not be
destroyed; it could become
larger and stronger than before.
There is a peculiar conse
quence of all this: Civil defense
in the United States could well
become the most powerful de
terrent of nuclear war. The
leaders in the Kremlin are cal
culating, conservative, "scien
tific." The Marxist movement
claims a nineteenth century
"scientific" cause-and-effect
foundation that considers a
communist victory inevitable.
Consequently, the communist
leaders avoid gambles.
If the United States survived
a nuclear war, the future for the

Soviet empire would be dubious.
An American society in which
every survivor would have lost
someone dear would be a terri
fying threat to the perpetrators
of the destruction. Even in a
weakened state, the U.S.A.
would be an incalculable men
ace to its enemies. The Soviets
cannot afford to start a war
which would merely hurt us —
they need to know that they can
destroy us.
Civil defense, which would
cost a mere one percent of our
military expenditures, could
ensure our national survival. If
we saw that the Soviets were
evacuating their cities, we
could do the same even faster.
Our civilian society is rich, and
we can more easily provide the
wherewithal to weather the
storm than the rickety Soviet
Union whose only strength (and
at the same time enormous
strength) resides in its military
component.

Yet civil defense in the United
States requires planning. Our
great reserves of civilian
wealth will remain unuseable in
case of need unless we face the
unthinkable and plan. The pecu
liarity is that thinking and plan
ning may change what is un
thinkable (and seems, at the
same time, unavoidable) into
something provided against and
thereby avoided.
As long as Americans remain
alive and organized, those who
have attacked us can never be
safe. Our aim should not be to
win a nuclear war. Our aim
must be to avoid it. Mutual as
sured destruction will not do be
cause it is not assured. Mutual
assured survival is the best
guarantee of a peaceful future
that might become increasingly
secure and, if you want to
dream, even increasingly free.
