# Beyond Crim Law to the courts
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
If the California State Bar's President Robert
Raven had been enrolled in Professor John Kaplan's
Criminal Law course last quarter, he probably
would have done quite well.
This may seem obvious — despite Kaplan's in
famous multiple-choice final — but the two lawyers
seem to share a similar commitment to statistical
evidence rather than theoretical despair in discuss
ing crime in America. Like many of the students in
Poli Sci 183, Raven's Commonwealth Club audience
in San Francisco yesterday was intrigued and often
surprised by facts he presented about "Crime Con
trol and the Courts; Who's Failing Who?" which run
contrary to popular beliefs.
Sensational, media-saturated cases have riveted
attention and criticism on the judiciary and neg
lected other parts of the criminal justice system,
Ravens said, but law enforcement agencies and
prosecutors must share the responsibility as reform
targets.
"The courts can try only those defendants the po
lice have arrested for criminal behavior and the
prosecutors have charged for those crimes ... for
every 100 crimes committed, only six persons are
arrested," he said.
"The odds of getting away with crime are better
than they are at the track," the Boalt Hall graduate
said, claiming the only reasonable way to lower the
rate of crime is to improve the apprehension and
identification of criminals rather than attacking the
courts.
In 1976, the United States had an imprisonment
rate of 215 per 100,000 in population, the highest in
the world and still rising. However, polls continue to
show Americans think we are among the most leni
ent nations, according to Kaplan's textbook Crimi
nal Justice.
"The notion that we are soft on crime is just not
true," Raven maintained. "California now in

carcerates a higher proportion of its men, women
and children than the national average. In fact, Cali
fornia's incarceration rate is higher than any other
advanced nation in the world except South Africa
and the Soviet Union."
Rather than increasing a punishment's severity,
Raven said, the certainty of the punishment is what
constitutes a deterrence to crime. Improving this
certainty, however, would require what the public
perceives as too costly a solution — hiring more law
enforcement personnel, improving crime labs,
etc. . .
"Our politicians are well aware of the public's re
luctance to pay for an increase in government anti
crime efforts, while court reforms are politically
popular as anti-crime efforts," he said.
"Governor Brown's ambitious proposal to spend 5
billion dollars on crime control remains ensnarled in
the state legislature and its eventual passage seems
unlikely ... the Reagan administration has not
shown any willingness to make a Pentagon-sized
budget expenditure of federal funds on an anti-crime
crusade," he said.
Raven claimed that hidden costs plague the stat
utes which legislatures pass to placate the public's
"mad as hell" mood about crime.
"Court reform measures, sentencing en
hancement and habitual offender statutes — if
enacted without corresponding commitments to
provide more judges, prosecutors or courtrooms
and to build or renovate prisons — appear to cost no
money, so the public does not object," he pointed
out.
One such statute has been proposed by state sena
tor Paul Gann, former Proposition 13 crusader, who
has introduced an initiative labeled a "victim's bill
of rights." According to Raven.it would "gut a gen
eration's worth of rights extended to criminal sus
pects by the California courts." While it would bring
about an increase in trials and imprisoned criminals, the
results would cost a tremendous amount of money but
would not be covered by a "tax plank."
The Gann initiative would also eliminate plea bargain
ing for all felony cases. This practice, which allows crimi
nals to plead guilty in exchange for lower prison sentences
— a process which speeds up the flow through the courts —
has been sharply attacked by "get tough groups."
According to the State Bar President, plea bargaining is
simply a necessity as the average trial takes 1800 minutes
while the average plea bargain negotiation occupy 15
minutes in the courtroom.
If the bargain results in leniency, he said, blame should
fall on the shoulders of the prosecutors who are given too
much discretion in their recommendations, not the judges
(who accept the recommendations).
Kaplan confirms the statistic that to drop the current
percentage of defendants who plead guilty rather than be
tried (90 percent) to 80 percent, it would amount to a doubl
ing of judicial manpower and facilities, including twice as
many judges, court staff and jurors. Meanwhile it costs an
average of more than $13,000 per year to maintain a con
vict in prison.
Ravens discounted questions involving the exclusionary
rule and mental capacity defenses, calling them the kinds
of cases which generate widespread media attention, yet
have little impact on the crime rate.
"I'd like to see us return to the days when you could talk
to your neighborhood Irish cop over the back fence,"
Raven said with a smile, making the point that witnesses
and even victims contribute to the crime problem by
withholding information and failing to file charges against
offenders.
"We are in the market for solutions, not snake oil," he
concluded, urging his audience to''see the criminal justice
system as a whole and spend the money needed for crime
prevention and enforcement."
