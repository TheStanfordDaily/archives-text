# Beyond Crim Law to the courts

### Joan O'Connell 
If the California State Bar's President Robert
Raven had been enrolled in Professor John Kaplan's
Criminal Law course last quarter, he probably
would have done quite well.
This may seem obvious — despite Kaplan's in
famous multiple-choice final — but the two lawyers
seem to share a similar commitment to statistical
evidence rather than theoretical despair in discuss
ing crime in America. Like many of the students in
Poli Sci 183, Raven's Commonwealth Club audience
in San Francisco yesterday was intrigued and often
surprised by facts he presented about "Crime Con
trol and the Courts; Who's Failing Who?" which run
contrary to popular beliefs.
Sensational, media-saturated cases have riveted
attention and criticism on the judiciary and neg
lected other parts of the criminal justice system,
Ravens said, but law enforcement agencies and
prosecutors must share the responsibility as reform
targets.
"The courts can try only those defendants the po
lice have arrested for criminal behavior and the
prosecutors have charged for those crimes ... for
every 100 crimes committed, only six persons are
arrested," he said.
"The odds of getting away with crime are better
than they are at the track," the Boalt Hall graduate
said, claiming the only reasonable way to lower the
rate of crime is to improve the apprehension and
identification of criminals rather than attacking the
courts.
In 1976, the United States had an imprisonment
rate of 215 per 100,000 in population, the highest in
the world and still rising. However, polls continue to
show Americans think we are among the most leni
ent nations, according to Kaplan's textbook Crimi
nal Justice.
"The notion that we are soft on crime is just not
true," Raven maintained. "California now in

carcerates a higher proportion of its men, women
and children than the national average. In fact, Cali
fornia's incarceration rate is higher than any other
advanced nation in the world except South Africa
and the Soviet Union."
Rather than increasing a punishment's severity,
Raven said, the certainty of the punishment is what
constitutes a deterrence to crime. Improving this
certainty, however, would require what the public
perceives as too costly a solution — hiring more law
enforcement personnel, improving crime labs,
etc. . .
"Our politicians are well aware of the public's re
luctance to pay for an increase in government anti
crime efforts, while court reforms are politically
popular as anti-crime efforts," he said.
"Governor Brown's ambitious proposal to spend 5
billion dollars on crime control remains ensnarled in
the state legislature and its eventual passage seems
unlikely ... the Reagan administration has not
shown any willingness to make a Pentagon-sized
budget expenditure of federal funds on an anti-crime
crusade," he said.
Raven claimed that hidden costs plague the stat
utes which legislatures pass to placate the public's
"mad as hell" mood about crime.
"Court reform measures, sentencing en
hancement and habitual offender statutes — if
enacted without corresponding commitments to
provide more judges, prosecutors or courtrooms
and to build or renovate prisons — appear to cost no
money, so the public does not object," he pointed
out.
One such statute has been proposed by state sena
tor Paul Gann, former Proposition 13 crusader, who
has introduced an initiative labeled a "victim's bill
of rights." According to Raven.it would "gut a gen
eration's worth of rights extended to criminal sus
pects by the California courts." While it would bring
