## . . .or bilateral unconditional surrender? 
### 
The speakers droned on and
on. The evening was hot, the air
conditioning in the Stanford law
school auditorium barely ap
parent. The audience only half
filled the hall; they stirred list
lessly.
The specter of atomic war
and its horror: death for mil
lions; obliteration of mankind,
total destruction of civilization.
The words poured forth through
the loud speakers and filled the
open spaces; but few seemed
stirred, surprised or shocked.
Applause was meager and occa
sional.
I dozed, listening, but only
half-hearing. Megatons, half
lives, decisive capability, first
strikes, second strikes, MX mis
siles, obscene suggestion of lim
ited atomic warfare, more ob
scene suggestions of first strike
possibility.
Suddenly the air cleared and
there came a visitation, how
either of us, the U.S. or the Sovi
ets, might actually win a nucle
ar war.
Losing our patience with the
Russians, we secretly decide to
launch a first strike attack.
Reagan gets on the Hot Line
with Brezhnev. "Comrade Com
missar," he says, "we have de
clared war on you — and lost.
Send in your commissars and
take charge. We'll turn over to
them the Army, Navy, Airforce
and Marine Corps, the FBI and
the CIA, the NSA, Medicare and
Social Security, inflation and
supply side economics, our gas
guzzling automobile industry
and delapidated steel plant.
"Your magnificent per
formances in Afghanistan and
Poland inspire us."
"We promise you that Sena
tor Kennedy, Vice-President
Bush, Senators Baker, Prox

mire and Long, Speaker Tip
O'Neil, the UAW, Teamsters,
farm workers, southern fun
damentalists, Reggie Jackson,
Billie Martin, Ex-Presidents
Nixon, Ford and Carter will all
join in helping you hand pick a
politburo to serve you.
"But — there are problems
you should be aware of. For ex
ample, there are the Constitu
tion and the Bill of Rights.
Americans are attached to them
and grow ornery when politi
cians attempt to trim them
down to someone's idea of a
more proper size.
"And then there is an even
more disturbing situation about
which you should alert your
commissars — namely, wide
spread proliferation of Saturday
night specials and the tendency
of Mafia guerrillas to grow pa
triotic when they see the possi
bility of their turf being in
vaded. In time these could be
more threatening than a mixed
task force from our armed ser
vices.
"But the victory is yours.
Come and enjoy it."
A fly buzzed and made a run
at my nose and the scene
shifted. This time it was
Brezhnev on the phone with
Reagan. "Comrade President,"
he said, "we have declared war
on you — and lost. We sur
render. We look forward to the
arrival of your civilian govern
ment team.
"With your experience with
blacks, Chicanos, Latinos and
Indians, you should have no
trouble handling the dozens of
nationalities and ethnic groups
which people our land from the
Baltic Sea to the Chinese
border, many of whom con
stantly clamor, in more than 16
languages, for national inde

pendence. We shall alert them
to prepare for integration,
school busing and melting pot
process."
"Our vast collectivized farms
will be delighted to be taken
over by your multi-national cor
porations and perhaps finally
they will begin to yield enough
grain so that we can stop
purchasing from that interna
tional cartel led by your great
country, which has been respon
sible for the ruble drain on our
economy and kept our people on
short rations.
"And the Hunts, send them to
us. How they could teach us how
to truly corner the caviar in
dustry! And you transporation
experts — our rail lines
stretching across tens of
thousands of miles from the
Polish border to the Western
Pacific could only benefit from
your vast skills in keeping the

trains running by intensive con
solidation.
"But beware, our borders are
beset with minorities clamoring
for national independence, and
our rich heritage of anarchism
and revolution may come alive
with a rebirth of bomb throwers
and saboteurs. Your overseers
should be forewarned."
"Comrade Reagan, we await
your delegation with bowed
heads."
And, then, the curtain lifted
and there were Brezh and Ron
nie holdings hands and leading a
chorus of all the peoples of the
world in singing :
"Free at last, oh Lord, free at
last."

Brezhnev on the phone with
Reagan. "Comrade President,"
he said, "we have declared war
on you — and lost. We sur
render. We look forward to the
arrival of your civilian govern
ment team.
"With your experience with
blacks, Chicanos, Latinos and
Indians, you should have no
trouble handling the dozens of
nationalities and ethnic groups
which people our land from the
Baltic Sea to the Chinese
border, many of whom con
stantly clamor, in more than 16
languages, for national inde

pendence. We shall alert them
to prepare for integration,
school busing and melting pot
process."
"Our vast collectivized farms
will be delighted to be taken
over by your multi-national cor
porations and perhaps finally
they will begin to yield enough
grain so that we can stop
purchasing from that interna
tional cartel led by your great
country, which has been respon
sible for the ruble drain on our
economy and kept our people on
short rations.
"And the Hunts, send them to
us. How they could teach us how
to truly corner the caviar in
dustry! And you transporation
experts — our rail lines
stretching across tens of
thousands of miles from the
Polish border to the Western
Pacific could only benefit from
your vast skills in keeping the

trains running by intensive con
solidation.
"But beware, our borders are
beset with minorities clamoring
for national independence, and
our rich heritage of anarchism
and revolution may come alive
with a rebirth of bomb throwers
and saboteurs. Your overseers
should be forewarned."
"Comrade Reagan, we await
your delegation with bowed
heads."
And, then, the curtain lifted
and there were Brezh and Ron
nie holdings hands and leading a
chorus of all the peoples of the
world in singing :
"Free at last, oh Lord, free at
last."

The speakers droned on and
on. The evening was hot, the air
conditioning in the Stanford law
school auditorium barely ap
parent. The audience only half
filled the hall; they stirred list
lessly.
The specter of atomic war
and its horror: death for mil
lions; obliteration of mankind,
total destruction of civilization.
The words poured forth through
the loud speakers and filled the
open spaces; but few seemed
stirred, surprised or shocked.
Applause was meager and occa
sional.
I dozed, listening, but only
half-hearing. Megatons, half
lives, decisive capability, first
strikes, second strikes, MX mis
siles, obscene suggestion of lim
ited atomic warfare, more ob
scene suggestions of first strike
possibility.
Suddenly the air cleared and
there came a visitation, how
either of us, the U.S. or the Sovi
ets, might actually win a nucle
ar war.
Losing our patience with the
Russians, we secretly decide to
launch a first strike attack.
Reagan gets on the Hot Line
with Brezhnev. "Comrade Com
missar," he says, "we have de
clared war on you — and lost.
Send in your commissars and
take charge. We'll turn over to
them the Army, Navy, Airforce
and Marine Corps, the FBI and
the CIA, the NSA, Medicare and
Social Security, inflation and
supply side economics, our gas
guzzling automobile industry
and delapidated steel plant.
"Your magnificent per
formances in Afghanistan and
Poland inspire us."
"We promise you that Sena
tor Kennedy, Vice-President
Bush, Senators Baker, Prox

mire and Long, Speaker Tip
O'Neil, the UAW, Teamsters,
farm workers, southern fun
damentalists, Reggie Jackson,
Billie Martin, Ex-Presidents
Nixon, Ford and Carter will all
join in helping you hand pick a
politburo to serve you.
"But — there are problems
you should be aware of. For ex
ample, there are the Constitu
tion and the Bill of Rights.
Americans are attached to them
and grow ornery when politi
cians attempt to trim them
down to someone's idea of a
more proper size.
"And then there is an even
more disturbing situation about
which you should alert your
commissars — namely, wide
spread proliferation of Saturday
night specials and the tendency
of Mafia guerrillas to grow pa
triotic when they see the possi
bility of their turf being in
vaded. In time these could be
more threatening than a mixed
task force from our armed ser
vices.
"But the victory is yours.
Come and enjoy it."
A fly buzzed and made a run
at my nose and the scene
shifted. This time it was
Brezhnev on the phone with
Reagan. "Comrade President,"
he said, "we have declared war
on you — and lost. We sur
render. We look forward to the
