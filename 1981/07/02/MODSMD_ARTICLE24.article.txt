# The
						Santa Cruz beach and boardwalk
## Spend a day of fun in the sun 
### 
Santa Cruz would be just an
other sleepy little university
town, much like Irvine, Davis,
or Palo Alto (except a bit closer
to the beaches), if it wasn't for
the Santa Cruz Boardwalk.
The Boardwalk is a half-mile
long stretch of souvenier shops,
food stands, an arcade, bumper
cars, an old fashioned merry-go
round (complete with a brass
ring), a ferris wheel, a water
splashing log ride, a horrifying
and rickety old wooden roll
er coaster , countless other

rides, and crowds of sunburned
people.
The rollercoaster is ranked
by professional thrill-seekers as
the fourth scariest in the nation
because of its sharp drops and
sloping curves.
The log ride ranks right up
there with the best of them —
it's got a great roller-coaster
drop and under the hot Santa
Cruz sun, getting soaked at the
end is the best part of the ride.
Along with enjoying the
Boardwalk's manv entertain

ments, you don't want to miss
the extensive arcade. Although
parts of the Boardwalk are
being remodeled, the big room
at the north end is open, and full
of all sorts of mechanical de
lights.
To start your tour of the
Boardwalk ride in one of the
gondolas that traverse the
beachfront.
Once you've had your fill of
popcorn and hair-raising rides
you can wander down to the
beach and lie in the sun.

Clockwise from at left: The water is always running
at the boardwalk's spectacular log ride. On the right
edge of the picture are the wooden tracks of the
famed Big Dipper' — the rickety boardwalk roll
ercoaster. Upper left: The rising loops of the old
wooden roller coaster look out over the sand onto the
beach. In the right of the picture is the gondola that
takes riders from one end of the boardwalk to the
other. Upper right: The loops of the log ride pass
over the boardwalk autorama, where riders drive

small 'sport cars.' Above: A gorgeous stretch of
sand, next to a gently rolling surf. What more could
one want? Below: If you want a change of scene
from the sunny beach and boardwalk, take a bus up
the hill to the University of California at Santa Cruz.
U.C. Santa Cruz has some beautiful wooded walking
paths, and lots of beautiful sculptures scattered
about the campus. This giant 'squiggle' is on the
field next to College Five, overlooking the city of
Santa Cruz and the ocean.
