# Roaring Camp railroad winds through the woods
## 
### 
Add the Redwoods to your
travel log. There's more to see
in Santa Cruz than sand and the
Pacific Ocean.
The Roaring Camp and Big
Trees Narrow-Gauge Railroad
is an original old-fashioned
steam-powered passenger train
through the redwood forests of
Santa Cruz County. It's a relax
ing means to see the wooded
area — there's no need to feel
railroaded into spending time on
this tourist attraction

The camp itself is located
along the Henry Cowell
Redwoods State Park.
The train, circa 1880, lumbers
through forests to Indian Creek.
Grizzly Flats and Bear Moun
tain. It climbs several steep
railroad grades before stopping
at Bear Mountain Passengers
may continue on their original
train or stop over to hike or pic
nic at the mountain.
The railroad returns to the de
pot, the Roaring Camp, which
offers a chuckwagon barbecue

and a General Store. Hungry
riders can purchase old-time
candies, toys, gifts, ham
burgers, hot dogs, soft drinks
and ice cream.
The direct sunlight during the
wait at the depot is deceptive.
Both open and enclosed cars are
available. Most of the journey is
through the shade of the forest
so you may want to bring a
sweater.
Don't expect privacy — the
ride is popular and crowded
The cars were filled on our
weekday visit.
The rails are spaced three and
one-half feet apart as opposed to
the traditional four and one-half
foot area between rails. The re
sulting narrow-gauge track
enables the train to climb steep,
windy areas of the mountainous
forest.
According to the conductor,
Cathedral Grove is the most
popular site along the trip. The
tall trunks of the trees here give
the impression of columns. The
scenic grove is the only place
along the trip in which passen

gers leave the train.
People sit in the giant log
bench or in the soft bed of pine
needles of the grove while the
conductor relates anecdotes and
recounts the history of the camp
which opened to tourists in 1958.
He said, for example, that the
grove is occasionally used for
wedding ceremonies. He then
asked his captive audience
whether, as "captain" of the
train, he could officially per
form the wedding rites.

are also offered through the
summer every Saturday night
from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. The fes
tivity includes a steam train ex
cursion, chuckwagon barbecue
dinner, entertainment and
