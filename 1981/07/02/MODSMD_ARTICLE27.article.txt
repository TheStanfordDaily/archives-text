# South of Stanford lies the greatest little town, S.C.
## 
### 
To most Stanford students,
the letters "S.C." conjure up vi
sions of those Southern Califor
nia Trojans. But they lose their
negative connotation once
you've been to another Califor
nia "S.C." — Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz is a unique town.
So avoid spending the whole day
on the beach — you don't want
skin cancer anyway.
We began our escape from the
University to Santa Cruz at 8
a.m. Although we drove, alter
nate means of transportation,
such as the bus, are available.
For those who consider Half
Moon Bay a major excursion,
Santa Cruz may seem like the
North Pole (albeit warmer).
But the drive, barring disaster,
should take only about an hour.
Santa Cruz seems to have
been created for the total vaca
tion. Although the town does
boast a library, its emphasis is
definitely on fun in the sun So
enjov the hedonistic environ
ment — eat, drink, play, relax,
and work on achieving the ul
timate tan The means for all
are available
The Boardwalk
The Boardwalk is a kid s
dream. If you didn t get
to go on enough rides when you
were young, you have the
chance to make up for it here!
Rollercoasters and fun rides
abound — and so do the soft ice
cream dealers. Plenty of addic
tive carnival games are also
available.

If your beach paraphenalia is
limited — or consists solely of a
towel for Lake Lagunita sunning
— you might want to consider
renting equipment. The Fun
Spot, at 35 Front Street across
from the Santa Cruz Wharf,
rents surfboards, mopeds, and
other beach "necessities." The
renting option is relatively inex
pensive (compared to buying)
and offers ample opportunity
for experimentation.
Something else you may no
tice is that activities seem nev
er-ending in Santa Cruz. The
Miss California Pageant, for ex
ample, came and went last Sat
urday, June 20. (Tickets were
$25. anyway.) But plenty of
swimsuits are still visible live
and in color on the beach for
those who missed the competi
tion which was televised state
wide.
Don't harbor too many re
grets, but you also missed the
Third Annual Santa Cruz Har
bor Festival and Boat Show, the
biggest of the year. Area boat
and yacht dealers sponsored the
event held June 5 - 7.
Future events
Independence Day kicks off
July festivities in Santa Cruz
The community celebration of
fers a Softball tournament,
swimming, a barbecue and a
pancake breakfast. Interna
tional soccer games will take
place the same day.
From July 11 to 12, an annual

miniature show will be held in
the Civic Auditorium. The
Felton Fine Arts Festival is an
other mid-July program.
Santa Cruz does not leave its
visitors hungry. The Felton Cov
ered Bridge Annual Pancake
Breakfast is a "down-home"
celebration sponsored by the
Felton Volunteer Fire Depart
ment.
On July 25, over 60 Northern
California and Nevada dogs will
compete in the sectional finals
of the canine frisbee cham
pionships. They will leap three
to six feet to catch the flying
discs.
And on July 27, a Wharf-to-
Wharf race will feature world
class runners, former Olym
pians and other runners. The
route will run from the Munici
pal Wharf to Capitola Wharf.
By consulting any of the many
newspapers in the area, you
should find events of interest. In
addition to the well-known Good
Times entertainment maga
zine. papers serve feminists,
students, health fanatics, and
iust about anvone else.
