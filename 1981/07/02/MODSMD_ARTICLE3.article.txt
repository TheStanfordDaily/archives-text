# Begin fails to win plurality vote
## Begin may form coalition 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem — Although he ap
parently failed by one parlia
mentary seat to win a plurality
over his Labor alignment op
position in Israeli national elec
tions, a political twist left
Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin in position yesterday to hold
on to the reins of government.
After a claim of victory early
yesterday morning, the prime
minister moved to begin
bargaining with some of his old
coalition partners — the leading
religious parties — over their
terms for continued support of
his Likud bloc government for
another four years.
The official election results

from hand-counted ballots will
not be available until next week,
but the most recent com
puterized projections here
based on more than 50 percent of
the country's 4397 voting sta
tions gave the alignment of La
bor Party leader Shimon Peres
49 seats in the new Knesset (par
liament) against 48 for Begin's
Likud.
But in the process of casting
more than 80 percent of their
votes for the two major parties
Israeli voters killed off a
number of centrist minor
parties that had been the tradi
tional coalition partners of La
bor, leaving only Likud's re
ligious party allies with the
clout necessary for either party
to form a viable governing coali
tion.
Religious parties
All three religious groupings,
which between them appear to
have won 13 Knesset seats, had
previously announced their
preference for joining a coali
tion with Begin. Labor party
leaders conceded privately that
it was highly unlikely that the
religious groupings would
switch their support to Peres
despite his apparent plurality of
the votes.
"At this point they will go to
the highest bidder, and Likud is
the highest bidder," said Meron
Mezini, a leading Labor party
member.
Begin met yesterday after
noon with National Religious
Party leader Dr. Yosef Burg to
begin negotiating the terms of
their future relationship.
Although Burg's NRP lost six
of its former 12 seats in the
Knesset due to defections of its
own voters to other religious
groups and to the Likud, the nar
row spread between Begin's 48
seats and the 61 seats necessary
to control the 120-seats Knesset
put Burg and two other religious
party leaders in a stronger posi
tion than they have enjoyed pre
viously. It is only with their sup
port that either Begin or Peres
could make a coalition.
'Kingmaker' Burg
Thus Burg, who is now Be
gin's interior minister and chief
negotiator in the stalled auton
omy talks with Egypt, has been

cast in the role of kingmaker.
His six Knesset seats make
NRP the third ranking party in
the new Parliament.
Two other religious parties
that already have announced a
preference for Likud have seven
seats between them, enough to
boost Likud's total support to
the key majority number of 61.
Agudat Yisrael has five seats,
and religious affairs minister
Aharon Abu-Hatziera's Tami
Party, an ethnic splinter of the
NRP, has two.
In addition, the extreme
right-wing Tehiya Party, which
would like to see the peace trea
ty with Egypt abrogated, ap
parently won two seats and
former defense minister Moshe
Dayan's new Telem Party got
one. Given enough incentive by
Begin, both could support his
government in the Knesset.
Weak majority
However, Labor party lead
ers and many political ob
servers here cautioned that the
Begin majority in the Knesset
could prove weak and short
lived, based on such a narrow
vote spread and dependent upon
the support of minor parties
that already have begun feud
ing. Because of his split from
the NRP, for example, Abu-
Hatziera's Tami grouping
alrady has been damned by
Burg who announced that he
would not tolerate it in a coali
tion.
It will be difficult for Begin to
thread them together to form a
new government and probably
even harder to hold them in line
on crucial votes once his new
government is in power.
