The Second World War had just
ended, and mixed in with the
bright hopes for the future was a
lingering doubt about whether
what America had gained in
"progress' could ever replace the
old ways that had been lost. Frank
Capra (Mr. Smith does to Wash
ington, It Happened One Night)
directed this masterful com
edy/fantasy/drama Like the era
that produced it, It's a Wonderful
Life is a fascinating, disturbing
mixturftof confidence and regret.
The happy ending is delightful be
cause it comes as the end of a com
edy-veiled nightmare, This is
Capra's masterpiece and one of
James Stewart's finest films.
Stewart stars as a very good
man driven to the verge of suicide
when all his fine plans seem to be
ruined. A messenger from heaven
stops him in his attempt and then
shows him how different the lives
of his family and friends would
have been had he never lived.

Breaker Morant ***
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer War.
He and two other Australian sol
diers are court martialled for kill
ing a German priest; they are sac
rificial lambs, served up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account of
their trial, and the events which
led up to it, is an extremely "well
made" movie, stuffed full of pret
ty scenery and historical signifi
cance; while it never quite catches
fire, it stays well above the
boredom threshold.

Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the thirties and
forties (it's set in 1936) as well as
the TV serials and comics of the
fifties. It represents the combined
efforts of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed; George
Lucas (Star Wars) and Philip
Kaufman (Invasion of the Body
Snatchers) wrote the script. It has
been acclaimed by the overwhelm
ing majority of critics as a cliff
hanger classic. But I must confess
to a traitorous resistance to all
those good vibrations: I didn't
care for the movie very much.
Raiders achieves a weird balance:
it's exciting on the surface but dull
at its center. For all the hype about
its adolescent boys' tale spirit, I
could discern none of it. Raiders
was made in acquisitive spirit; it's
a tradesman's movie.

Clash af the

The Elephant Man
New Varsity, Palo Alto
I kept putting off seeing this
movie — I think I expected it to be
preachy and all about "human
dignity." (Human dignity tends to
make better editorials than mov
ies.) When I finally got around to
going. I was immensely gratified
to discover that The Elephant
Man isn't preachy at all — it's
pure magic.
The film is based on the life of
John Merrick, a victim of a de
forming disease in nineteenth-cen
tury England. Director David
Lynch has created a film that's
equal parts Dickens and Mary
Shelley. We empathize with this
"monster," and we're appalled at
the cruelty of the society in which
he finds himself. Lynch's style is
anything but realistic: his movie
has the look and feel of a great
fairy tale. As played by John Hurt,
Merrick is imbued with sweetness
and gentle grace.
Starts next Thursday with
Lynch's first film. Eraserhead.

The Postman Always Kings
Twice **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Pnstman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Chinatown.

Superman 11 ***
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the original;
it. will usually delight those who
found the original's smart-alecky
second half more appealing. Rich
ard Lester (A Hard. Day's Night,
The Three Musketeers) directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
book punch that moves it along as
speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
peats his role as the man of steel;
Margot Kidder is, once again, a
sassy, sexy Lois Lane.

Ordinary People * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num
bers Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life
right out of this picture. Redford is
better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially good
With Mary Tyler Moore and
Donald Sutherland.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
A Separate Peace.
— Ron Lillejord
Taxi Driver ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Martin Scorsese directed Rob
ert DeNiro in this disturbing,
bloody, nightmarishly beautiful
evocation of American alienation.
DeNiro plays the titular taxi
driver who responds to the vio
lence he sees all around him by
trying to become even more vi
olent than everyone else. The only
morally pure character in the film
is the twelve-year-old prostitute
played by Jody Foster; the girl re
mains untouched by the horror of
her life because she believes that
she is climbing up the ladder to the
American dream. Success in our
society, Scorsese suggests, comes
only from abandoning everything
that makes one human.
Plays tonight and Friday with
Raging Bull.

Electric Horseman ***
Fox, Redwood City
Almost constructed as the vis
ual equivalent of a Willie Nelson
song. The fact that Nelson is one of
the co-stars only enhances the
warm, nearly uneventful, yet
somehow quietly thoughtful feel
ing of this Robert Redford-Jane
Fonda star vehicle. The per
formances, especially Redford's,
are fine. Sidney Pollack s direc
tion is, thankfully, economical,
and the movie ultimately wins you
over by voiding overt messages
and, in spite of its pre-fab ele
ments, maintaining its charm and
good nature throughout.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Eyewitness.

Chinatown ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski directed this
fine, violent, nightmarish evoca
tion of the '30s Los Angeles under
world Faye Dunaway plays a
woman who has a terrible secret.
Jack Nicholson plays the detective
who must help her. Both per
formers give astounding per
formances. Nicholson, especially,
makes us feel the unwholesome
ness that accompanies this Cali
fornian wasteland.
There are no "good' characters
in this film; they are all predators
or, at best, not particularly sym
pathetic victims. Polanski brings
out the worst in all of us; his genius
is a disturbingly bitter one.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with The Postman Always Rings
. Twice.

The Kids Are Alright
Old Mill, Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma
chine—as the years tick by we see
the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live
Rock" by heart, is that it ultimate
ly becomes an examination of the
creation of a public image. Which
came first : our generation or The
Who?
Late show this weekend.

Raffing
New varsity, Palo Alto
Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse. But on every level direc
tor Martin Scorsese throws ob
stacles in our path that prevent us
from becoming involved with the
film's characters. Scorsese and
star Robert De Niro have done
something very strange, they
have created a hero (based on the
life of famous middleweight Jake
La Motta) who does not respond on
any level to our attempt to locate
him on the human scale: he is im
penetrable. Raging Bull is all
about passion, yet in some ul
timate and important way the pas
sion never reaches us, even when
Jake's blood spatters the spec
tators at the last fight. As much as
I admire the film's technique. I
have to confess I don't like it very
much.
Plays tonight and Friday with
Taxi Driver.
