# Ives highlights 'Chamber Music'
## 
### Annie Maccoby 
Chamber Music West gave its
third concert Friday night with
a performance that, while un
even, displayed some fine
playing.
The program began with the
seldom-played Brahms Sonata
in E-flat Major for viola and pi
ano. Brahms is particularly
challenging as an opener, de
manding both depth and
momentum. The intensity was
there — in splashes; the con
tinuity was not.
Deft phrasing and some
sparkling lyrical passages dis
played Kim Kashkashian's am
ple talent in the allegro
amabile. As a violist,
Kashkashian is master of the
legato; her final ritardos were
particularly resonant, and the
last notes of the movement,
caught by the breeze, swept up
against the rim of the open hall.
Unfortunately, the keyboard
in a string duo is vulnerable, and
a strong pianist is a must. Paul
Hersh failed to consistently
complement the richness of the
viola. His passages often fell
flat. While echoing the
sharpness of Kashkashian's
staccato phrases in the third
section of the second move-

ment, Hersh remained through
out accompanist rather than full
partner.
His one-dimensional playing
did not respond to
Kashkashian's sweeping cres
cendos in the allegro ap
passionato. Only at the close of
the andante con moto, with the
difficult synchronized twists of
the allegro, did the piece
achieve the density that is
Brahms.
A curious, but brilliant sequel
to the Brahms was the Ives Pi
ano Trio, performed by Nich
olas Mann, Laurence Lesser,
and Nathan Schwartz. Ives' suc
cess as a composer is nowhere
more evident than in this piece,
by type and temperment well
suited to the summer mood.
Ives pays tribute to American
creativity, blending innovation
and humor.
The musicians caught the

spirit and weave of the piece:
snatches of jigs and familiar
American tunes twisted into ab
stract and complicated time
patterns. The shifts in pace, the
pauses, the interplay between
violin and cello, created an un
derlying sense of suggestion and
surprise.
Mann's violin was especially
fluid, and at one point the clash
between violin and cello created
a waterfall effect.
Taken at a racing tempo, the
presto was highlighted by light
piano passages from Schwartz.
The shifting melodies and wa
tercolor themes finally ran to
gether in the third movement,
tied together and wrapped up in
a final note — a question mark.

The trio blended technical
precision and scope, which was
lacking in the Brahms, but an
ticipated in the Mendelssohn.
As a finale, the Mendelssohn
Octet for Strings in E-flat Ma
jor moved at a fine clip, led by
the inspired energy of the first
violinist, Masuko Ushioda. Her
focused concentration seemed
to pull the musicians tightly to
gether, injecting the piece with
a sustained energy which con
tinued throughout. The
synchronized manipulation of
dynamics in the allegro mod
erato, the haunting themes in
the andante, the airy touch of
the scherzo: here was a unity
and clarity contained within this
circle of eight.
