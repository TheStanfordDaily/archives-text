## ‘News Boy’: no focus, uneven acting 
### Stephen Nash 
Arch Brown got his start
making porno films — a me
dium renowned for its single
mindedness of purpose and
its episodic form.As Susan
Sontag acknowledges in her
essay "On Pornography", it
is possible to see a "fuck
film" and maintain one's in
tellectual self-respect.
The passage from kissing
to heavier sex, the natural
development from foreplay
to climax, and the unity of
subject matter give porno its
rhythm and structure.
Brown, in switching from
porn to comedy, has lost not
only the subject matter of
porn but also the structure.
Brown's new play "News
boy" at Theatre Rhinoceros
in San Francisco is about a
young masters student who
is just "coming out."
Tim is visiting New York
City to get advice from his
former college friend Hank
who is always off at one cos
tume bar or another. So Tim
falls in love with the next
best thing. Hank's roommate
Bill.
The situation is com
plicated by Tim's father who
is running for political office
on an anti-gay platform, and
by Bill's friends Milt and
Red, a political activist and
his flamboyant lover.
With all these characters
and their diverse lifestyles
and complex relationships, it
is very easy for Brown to

bring up many topics in his
play. In it we find cynicism
about the latest Village fads,
social statements about
coming out, philosophizing
about the nature of jealousy,
and criticism of anti-gay at
titudes.
The play is full of many de
lightful and often very funny
scenes, and it is hard not to
be captivated by the antics of
Hank and Red. But that's
about all that happens. A lot
of topics are brought up and
then abandoned, almost un
explored. This is frustrating
and leaves the play without
momentum and focus.
The story centrally con
cerns Tim, but so many other
topics are added that the end
ing of the play is hardly no
ticeable — it is just another

event. This is very similar to
the style of porn, but the con
text of theatre comedy is
very different, and this re
quires that compensations be
made in the text.
The sub-plot involving
Tim's politician father is de
veloped in a series of TV
newscasts. Using video in
combination with another
medium has been popular
lately (as in the newer films
of Fassbinder or "Winter
play" at the Magic Theatre
last fall). Here, unfortunate
ly, nothing much is made of
the contrast in texture be
tween video and live action.
The direction by Alan
Estes is not sufficient to
focus the play. Individual
scenes, especially humorous
ones, come off very well. The

problem is that little hint is
given of the relative im
portance of different charac
ters and events.
The acting is also of mixed
quality. Curt Crider as the
forever-cruising Hank is
very funny as he switches
from one Village cliche to an
other, and Thomas Mark
gives a sensitive per
formance as Bill. On the oth
er side, Jordan Lee as Tim's
father gives an idiosyncratic
performance which makes
very little sense.
"Newsboy" by Arch
Brown plays Thursday
