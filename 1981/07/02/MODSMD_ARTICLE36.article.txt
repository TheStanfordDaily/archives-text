# New Orleans at the Old Mill
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
A little bit of New Orleans in
Mountain View, right? Well sort
of. As our waitress told us "The
owners went to New Orleans
and borrowed a lot, but they
weren't trying to copy it exact
ly." The result is a rather
unique and charming restaurant
in Bay Area Cajun style which
doubles as a nightclub and disco
(soon to be a cabaret).
Located in the Old Mill Mall,
on San Antonio Road, it is as
antithetical to normal mall
eateries as could be imagined.
The place is huge. It is divided
into a bar, a disco lounge — all
the way in the back — as well as
a large main dining room
tastefully decorated in subdued
colors and very conducive to in
timate dining.
We ate out on the "porch," lo
cated right on the edge of the

Old Mill's delightful ornamen
tal lake. The atmosphere was
noticeably different from in
side, but even with the in
formality the elegance re
mained.
The Old Mill is exquisitely ar
ranged and Bourbon Street has
taken full advantage of it. When
you eat on the water's edge it is
hard to believe that you are in
the heart of Silicon Valley. Your
imagination is free to wander to
more romantic places. . .
Our meal was as tastefully
prepared as the surroundings. A
selection of three types of
Oysters ($4.95): Rockefeller,
Angels on Horseback — oysters
wrapped in bacon, and plain
oysters. All were sublime espe
cially the Rockefeller where
spinach and light hollandaise
sauce blended perfectly with
their natural flavor.
Steamed clams ($6.95) were
brought out in a very light broth,
capturing the full maritime
flavor of the shellfish. The
Creole chowder ($1.50) was so
rich and thick that it could
almost be a meal in itself, but

don't stop after that, the best is
yet to come.
Although the restaurant's
aspirations are not completely
New Orleans, the shrimp Creole
($7 95) was authentic, and as
good as any I've tasted in that
southern gastronomical haven.
Succulent shrimp were
smothered in a vegetable sauce
whose spiciness complemented
the shrimp without overpower
ing.
The other entree was not as
spectacular. Tuurnedos Rue
Bourbon — ($9.95) Medallions
of tenderloin, sauteed shrimp,
broccoli, and hollandaise sauce
— lacked a continuity of flavor.
Each ingredient was cooked to
perfection, and yet the en
semble, although visually very
aesthetic, seemed not to
achieve its full potential.
Other entrees such as Cajun
Steak Etouffe - ($7.95) sirloin
smothered in Creole sauce, Lou
isiana Breast of Chicken ($6.95)
sauteed with olives, artichoke
hearts, avocadoes, cream sauce
and white wine, and salmon in a

spicy barbecue sauce ($8.95) —
all sound fascinating and are
sure to lure me back.
Bourbon Street's desserts
were a delight — a perfect finale
for an excellent meal. Bananas
Foster ($2.50), bananas flam
beed in liqueur and served over
French Vanilla ice cream, was

heavenly. And the Hot Bread
Pudding ($1.95) with Bourbon
Sauce almost equalled it.
Service was friendly and at
tentive, and helped rank this
meal among the best that I've
enjoyed in the Stanford area.
For food and ambience, a defi
nite winner.
