# RESTAURANTS
## Restaurant mixes dining styles 
### Stuart Leaf 
You will find yourself just as
comfortable with a jacket and
tie as in informal attire at
Hugo's Market restaurant. The
restaurant captures the essence
of subdued elegance, without
the formality of many finer con
tinental restaurants.
One of the managers likes to
think of Hugo's as a family res
taurant, and yet the majority of
its clientele are business people.
This seeming contradiction is
carried through the whole meal.
The menu caters to a sophisti
cated palate, and yet for dessert
there is a soft ice cream ma
chine and trappings to make
one's own sundae. For me this
juxtaposition of different styles

added to the low-key feeling in
the restaurant and enhanced my
enjoyment of the meal.
Overall, the standard of the
food was very high. The soups
were a little below this average,
however. The oi.ion soup was
rich and flavorful, but could
have used a slightly thicker
coating of cheese. The chicken
gumbo once again was tasty, but
would have been better with
more spices.
The salad bar was a real
treat. Once I had stopped filling
my plate to the brim I sat down
to enjoy the selection of melon,
pineapple, shrimp, calamari,
guacamole, mushrooms a la
fjrec, and salad. I was sad that I
had appetite enough to sample

only a small number of the
choices available.
Next came the entrees. My
Indonesian "Rack of Lamb,"
marinated in sate spices,
roasted with honey glaze and
served with a peanut butter
sauce, was succulent and ten
der. My date's Poached Pacific
Salmon with hollandaise sauce

was fresh and wonderfully light.
The accompanying vegetables,
however, although color-coordi
nated, added nothing to either
entree.
The only anxiety I felt during
the meal was in choosing an en
tree. All sounded tempting, and
I found it hard to pass up the
Danish duckling in a light sauce
with prunes, the sauteed
abalone, the Tarragon Chicken,
the barbecued giant prawns
New Orleans style, among oth
ers.
My selection turned out to be
superb, however, which has
whetted my appetite for further
exploration in the future.
Dessert, as I mentioned, was

a do-it-yourself sundae, and was
good as such things go. After
dessert, our waitress brought
around a tray of cordials with
the compliments of the house. I
felt this to be a nice touch with
which to bring the meal to a
close.
The wine list accompanying
the menu has recently been im
proved, and provides an ex
cellent selection of California
wines. Service was excellent:
friendly, helpful, efficient and
professional. Prices for entrees
(including salad bar, vegeta
bles, dessert and cordial) range
from $12.95 to $19.95, and con
sidering the quality of all
aspects of the restaurant, this is
by no means excessive.
