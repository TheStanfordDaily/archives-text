Delivery of F-16s to Israel scheduled
Washington — The Reagan administration will deliver
six F-16 jet fighters to Israel later this month, although a
shipment of four of the sophisticated aircraft scheduled
for last month remains suspended, a White House spokes
man said yesterday.
Spokesman Larry Speakes said the delivery of the six,
scheduled for July 17, would not be affected by the sus
pension announced June 10 in the wake of Israel's destruc
tion of an Iraqi nuclear reactor.
But Speakes and another spokesman indicated that with
nearly three weeks remaining before the delivery date,
and a study going on as a result of the raid, there was time
for the decision to be changed.
President Ronald Reagan announced the suspension
three days after Israel used U.S.-supplied F-15s in its bom
bing run on the reactor near Baghdad. He said Israel may
have commited a substantial violation of U.S. law by using
the jet airplanes in the raid.
Pending the completion of a study of the incident, he
withheld the shipment of four F-16s that had been sched
uled for delivery June 12.
"There's no decision on these and no timetable,"
Speakes said of the four. "The shipment of the F-16s is still
being withheld pending completion of that study."
Asked whether the next six scheduled for delivery would
be unaffected by the suspension, he said "You're right.
They're not."
Pressed about whether he was sure of his answer, he re
plied "yes."
Court changes car search rules
Washington — In a pair of farewell opinions by Justice
Potter Stewart, the Supreme Court attempted yesterday
to define the circumstances under which police may
search containers, plastic bags and other items they find
inside a person's automobile.
The high court decided 6-3 in a California case that law
enforcement officials generally need a warrant to search a
closed, wrapped, opaque container they find in a car. In a
separate case from New York, however, the justices de
cided 6-3 that police do not need a warrant to search such
items when they have already gathered enough evidence
to arrest the owner of the item.
The main opinions for the court in both of these cases
were written by Stewart, who is retiring Friday after
more than 22 years as a justice. The opinions were the final
ones Stewart will draft for the court, although he may file
his own personal views in some remaining cases.
Stewart's finale was far from harmonious. Six of the
nine justices said they could not understand or accept the
legal distinctions Stewart tried to make between the two
search cases.
Three of these justices — William Rehnquist, Harry
Blackmun and John Stevens — said they thought the court
ought to give police general authority to search all items
they find in a car without obtaining a warrant. The other
three — Justices William Brennan. Thurgood Marshall
and Byron White — said they thought the court ought to
ban all such searches by police without a warrant.
Some of these justices complained that the two new de
cisions will only cause more confusion for the police and
the public about what sort of police conduct is and is not
legal. Several justices suggested the court might change
the law regarding police searches in the near future.
The only two members of the court who voted with Stew
art in both the cases were Justice Lewis Powell and Chief

Justice Warren Burger. Even these two justices indicated
they disagreed strongly with some of Stewart's legal rea
soning.
Organized crime linked to drug bust
Monterey — A major marijuana smuggling ring with
ties to organized crime on the East Coast was cracked yes
terday when federal authorities arrested 21 people and
seized $45 million in marijuana, officials said.
U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Dave Cipra said
six people were arrested when law enforcement agents
seized a fishing boat at Moss Landing in Monterey Bay that
allegedly had taken on a shipment of 12 tons of marijuana
from a "mother ship" off the California coast.
Nine people were arrested when guardsmen from the
cutter Morganthau boarded the Kyoto, a Japanese trawler
under British registry, several hours after the fishing boat
at Moss Landing was seized, Cipra said.
The Kyoto was being brought to San Francisco with the
crew aboard, he said.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles, federal and local authorities
arrested five people identified by Cipra as the alleged ring
leaders of a plan to move an East Coast drug smuggling
operation to the West Coast.
' 'The investigation revealed that the attempted smuggl
ing operation was conducted by a well-known organization
with organized crime ties. The organization was in the
process of moving its operation to the West Coast," Cipra
said.
Cipra said the arrests and seizures culminated an eight
month joint investigation by the Coast Guard, the U.S.
Customs Office, the FBI, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration and state and local narcotics departments,
Woman leads Court candidate list
Washington — Sandra O'Connor, a prominent Arizona
jurist with Republican political credentials, has emerged
as a leading candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy that
will be created tomorrow when Justice Potter Stewart re
tires.
Well-placed administration officials confirmed that
O'Connor, who received a high ranking from the Arizona
Bar Association and was third in the Stanford law school
class in which Justice William Rehnquist finished first,
had been interviewed for the job. She is believed to be the
only potential nominee interviewed so far. Her name is on
a "short list," mostly of women, being considered by top
White House aides and Attorney General William Smith.
"She hasn't been chosen yet, but she's close," said one
source.
O'Connor, a 51-year-old judge of the Arizona Court of
Appeals, has enjoyed a meteoric rise through the state's
political and professional circles, impressing colleagues
with her intellect, demeanor, organizational abilities and
conservative views. She received one of the highest rat
ings of any judge evaluated in a 1980 state bar poll — 90
percent favorable.
Weather
Low clouds and locally dense fog along the coast extend
ing locally inland nights and mornings. Chance of coastal
drizzle. Otherwise variable high clouds through Friday.
Lows in the 50s. Highs near 60 along the coast to near 80

Pending the completion of a study of the incident, he
withheld the shipment of four F-16s that had been sched

"There's no decision on these and no timetable,"
Speakes said of the four. "The shipment of the F-16s is still
being withheld pending completion of that study."
Asked whether the next six scheduled for delivery would
be unaffected by the suspension, he said "You're right.
They're not."
Pressed about whether he was sure of his answer, he re

Court changes car search rules
Washington — In a pair of farewell opinions by Justice
Potter Stewart, the Supreme Court attempted yesterday
to define the circumstances under which police may
search containers, plastic bags and other items they find
inside a person's automobile.
The high court decided 6-3 in a California case that law
enforcement officials generally need a warrant to search a
closed, wrapped, opaque container they find in a car. In a
separate case from New York, however, the justices de
cided 6-3 that police do not need a warrant to search such
items when they have already gathered enough evidence
to arrest the owner of the item.
The main opinions for the court in both of these cases
were written by Stewart, who is retiring Friday after
more than 22 years as a justice. The opinions were the final
ones Stewart will draft for the court, although he may file
his own personal views in some remaining cases.
Stewart's finale was far from harmonious. Six of the
nine justices said they could not understand or accept the
legal distinctions Stewart tried to make between the two
search cases.
Three of these justices — William Rehnquist, Harry
Blackmun and John Stevens — said they thought the court
ought to give police general authority to search all items
they find in a car without obtaining a warrant. The other
three — Justices William Brennan. Thurgood Marshall
and Byron White — said they thought the court ought to
ban all such searches by police without a warrant.
Some of these justices complained that the two new de
cisions will only cause more confusion for the police and
the public about what sort of police conduct is and is not
legal. Several justices suggested the court might change
the law regarding police searches in the near future.
The only two members of the court who voted with Stew
art in both the cases were Justice Lewis Powell and Chief

Justice Warren Burger. Even these two justices indicated
they disagreed strongly with some of Stewart's legal rea
soning.
Organized crime linked to drug bust
Monterey — A major marijuana smuggling ring with
ties to organized crime on the East Coast was cracked yes
terday when federal authorities arrested 21 people and
seized $45 million in marijuana, officials said.
U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Dave Cipra said
six people were arrested when law enforcement agents
seized a fishing boat at Moss Landing in Monterey Bay that
allegedly had taken on a shipment of 12 tons of marijuana
from a "mother ship" off the California coast.
Nine people were arrested when guardsmen from the
cutter Morganthau boarded the Kyoto, a Japanese trawler
under British registry, several hours after the fishing boat
at Moss Landing was seized, Cipra said.
The Kyoto was being brought to San Francisco with the
crew aboard, he said.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles, federal and local authorities
arrested five people identified by Cipra as the alleged ring
leaders of a plan to move an East Coast drug smuggling
operation to the West Coast.
' 'The investigation revealed that the attempted smuggl
ing operation was conducted by a well-known organization
with organized crime ties. The organization was in the
process of moving its operation to the West Coast," Cipra
said.
Cipra said the arrests and seizures culminated an eight
month joint investigation by the Coast Guard, the U.S.
Customs Office, the FBI, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration and state and local narcotics departments,
Woman leads Court candidate list
Washington — Sandra O'Connor, a prominent Arizona
jurist with Republican political credentials, has emerged
as a leading candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy that
will be created tomorrow when Justice Potter Stewart re
tires.
Well-placed administration officials confirmed that
O'Connor, who received a high ranking from the Arizona
Bar Association and was third in the Stanford law school
class in which Justice William Rehnquist finished first,
had been interviewed for the job. She is believed to be the
only potential nominee interviewed so far. Her name is on
a "short list," mostly of women, being considered by top
White House aides and Attorney General William Smith.
"She hasn't been chosen yet, but she's close," said one
source.
O'Connor, a 51-year-old judge of the Arizona Court of
Appeals, has enjoyed a meteoric rise through the state's
political and professional circles, impressing colleagues
with her intellect, demeanor, organizational abilities and
conservative views. She received one of the highest rat
ings of any judge evaluated in a 1980 state bar poll — 90
percent favorable.
Weather
Low clouds and locally dense fog along the coast extend
ing locally inland nights and mornings. Chance of coastal
drizzle. Otherwise variable high clouds through Friday.
Lows in the 50s. Highs near 60 along the coast to near 80

Delivery of F-16s to Israel scheduled
Washington — The Reagan administration will deliver
six F-16 jet fighters to Israel later this month, although a
shipment of four of the sophisticated aircraft scheduled
for last month remains suspended, a White House spokes
man said yesterday.
Spokesman Larry Speakes said the delivery of the six,
scheduled for July 17, would not be affected by the sus
pension announced June 10 in the wake of Israel's destruc
tion of an Iraqi nuclear reactor.
But Speakes and another spokesman indicated that with
nearly three weeks remaining before the delivery date,
and a study going on as a result of the raid, there was time
for the decision to be changed.
President Ronald Reagan announced the suspension
three days after Israel used U.S.-supplied F-15s in its bom
bing run on the reactor near Baghdad. He said Israel may
have commited a substantial violation of U.S. law by using
the jet airplanes in the raid.
Pending the completion of a study of the incident, he
withheld the shipment of four F-16s that had been sched
uled for delivery June 12.
"There's no decision on these and no timetable,"
Speakes said of the four. "The shipment of the F-16s is still
being withheld pending completion of that study."
Asked whether the next six scheduled for delivery would
be unaffected by the suspension, he said "You're right.
