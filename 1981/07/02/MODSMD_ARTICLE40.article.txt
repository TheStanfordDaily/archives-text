# Mayotte's wins end

### 
Stanford star Tim Mayotte lost Tuesday in the
Wimbledon quarterfinals to Australia's Rod
Frawley.
Mayotte was narrowly defeated after two close
tie-breakers in a serve-and-volley duel, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6,
6-3.
The Stanford junior's defeat followed a series of
outstanding performances throughout the week that
caught the attention of the tennis world. 20-year-old
Mayotte turned pro last month.
