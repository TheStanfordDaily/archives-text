## Kenya's population boom hurts development 
### Washington Post 
Nairobi. Kenya — Kenya has
achieved the dubious distinction
of becoming the first country to
record a 4 percent annual rate of
natural increase, a figure that
means its 16 million population
will double in 18 years.
Population specialists say the
rapid growth is Kenya's most
serious development problem
and they cite "staggering,
mind-boggling" difficulties
ahead for one of Africa's more
advanced and better governed
countries.
Though 4 percent may not
sound like much, it means, at an
individual level, that the aver

age Kenyan woman has 8.1 chil
dren. Surveys show that no mat
ter how many children a typical
woman here has, she wants
more.
The population growth rate
could wipe out this East African
country's plans for long-term
economic advancement be
cause it means the economy has
to expand by 4 percent a year
just to stay even. It grew by only
2 percent last year.
In the last two years Kenya,
known for its agriculture, has
been unable to feed itself and
this year it will import more
than half a million tons of grain,
partly because of drought. In

1981 there will be almost 650,000
more mouths to feed than in
1980. Even the most optimistic
of forecasts for agricultural ad
vancement project that Kenya
will have to import food for
most of the decade.
Soaring birthrates
Many African countries face
similar difficulties in the future
because of soaring birthrates
twinned with declining agricul
tural output.
"Kenya has serious problems
right now," said Spencer
Silberstein, a population expert
for the U.S. Agency for Interna
tional Development. Pressures
on land in some areas of Kenya,
he said, are approaching that of
Bangladesh or Indonesia, whose
birthrates are now declining.
Kenya's rate is increasing.
Zimbabwe is second to Kenya
in Africa, with a growth
rate of about 3.4 percent —
meaning the population will
double in just over 20 years.
In some respects, Kenya, one
of Africa's most advanced
countries, is a victim of its own
progress. It maintains better
statistics than most countries
on the continent so others could
be growing as fast without
knowing it.
Lower death rate
More importantly, population
is increasing at a faster rate
than in other African nations be
cause the death rate is lower.
Life expectancy is 56 years, the
highest in mainland
Africa. The country's death rate
of 14 per 1000 and infant mortal
ity rate of 83 per 1000 are the
lowest on the continent, accord
ing to the Washington-based
Population Reference Bureau.
However, there are 53 births
for every 1000 people, the
highest rate in the world. By
contrast, the U.S. figure is 16.

Silberstein noted that Kenya
is one of the few African coun
tries to have embarked on a
family planning program. "Ser
vices have greatly expanded,
but the results have not," he
said, adding that "there is still
no vigorous government pro
gram."
Only about 3 percent of Ken
yan women practice any
modern method of birth control
and most of those use it to space,
not limit, children.
Salvator Kanani, the Ministry
of Health official in charge of
family planning, said the pro
gram was first announced in
1967. In 1972 a study was carried
out. In 1975 a mother-child
health program was started.
Last year another study was
completed but it has not yet
been presented to the Cabinet.
No family planning budget
There is still no separate
budget for family planning; so
far efforts are almost entirely
informational with little dis
tribution of birth control de
vices.
Since the program was an
nounced in 1967, the population
has shot up from about 10 mil
lion to 16 million and the growth
rate has soared from about 3.5
percent to a World Bank esti
mate of 4 percent.
Kanani disputed the 4 percent
figure, saying he thought it was
about 3.5 percent, but he pro
vided no evidence.
President Daniel Arap Moi,
who has seven children, fre
quently tells people at rallies
that they should limit their off
spring to the number they can
support.
Wider context
African officials often point
out that the population problem
must be examined in a wider
context.

"Dishing out contraceptive
devices is not the answer on its
own," said Simon Mazorodze,
Zimbabwe deputy minister of
health, in a recent interview.
"People want more children
for insurance for their old age,
because of the high infant death
rate" and to provide workers on
their farms, Mazorodze said.
"Public education and increas
ing the standard of living is the
answer." he said.
A Western diplomat in Nairo
bi disagreed with this approach.
"You can't have family plan
ning without birth control de
vices," he said. "Availability,
is the key," he said.
The problem is that, in many
parts of Africa, numbers trans
late into political power. In Ken
ya, where tribal politics has
always been important, the
population of Kikuyu, the larg
est tribe, increased by almost 50
percent between the 1969 and
1979 censuses, while the popu
lation of Luos, their rivals, only
rose by about 25 percent.
Also as a result of the popu
lation growth the sluggish econ
omy must create 260,000 new
jobs a year. By the year 2000, if
present trends continue, there
will be a need for 560,000 new
jobs a year. In a country where
50 percent of the population is
under 15 (it is 22 percent in the
United States), the number of
school children will more than
double to 7.1 million by the end
of the century.
Arable land per capita in the
high and medium agricultural
areas has almost halved since
independence in 1963 to about 1.5
acres per person. At current
rates of growth it will be down to
two-thirds of an acre, hardly
viable for a farm, by the year
2000.

omy must create 260,000 new
jobs a year. By the year 2000, if
present trends continue, there
will be a need for 560,000 new
jobs a year. In a country where
50 percent of the population is
under 15 (it is 22 percent in the
United States), the number of
school children will more than
double to 7.1 million by the end
of the century.
Arable land per capita in the
high and medium agricultural
areas has almost halved since
independence in 1963 to about 1.5
acres per person. At current
rates of growth it will be down to
two-thirds of an acre, hardly
viable for a farm, by the year
2000.
Nairobi. Kenya — Kenya has
achieved the dubious distinction
of becoming the first country to
record a 4 percent annual rate of
natural increase, a figure that
means its 16 million population
will double in 18 years.
Population specialists say the
rapid growth is Kenya's most
serious development problem
and they cite "staggering,
mind-boggling" difficulties
ahead for one of Africa's more
advanced and better governed
countries.
Though 4 percent may not
sound like much, it means, at an
individual level, that the aver

age Kenyan woman has 8.1 chil
dren. Surveys show that no mat
ter how many children a typical
woman here has, she wants
more.
The population growth rate
could wipe out this East African
country's plans for long-term
economic advancement be
cause it means the economy has
to expand by 4 percent a year
just to stay even. It grew by only
2 percent last year.
In the last two years Kenya,
known for its agriculture, has
been unable to feed itself and
this year it will import more
than half a million tons of grain,
partly because of drought. In

1981 there will be almost 650,000
more mouths to feed than in
1980. Even the most optimistic
of forecasts for agricultural ad
vancement project that Kenya
will have to import food for
most of the decade.
Soaring birthrates
Many African countries face
similar difficulties in the future
because of soaring birthrates
twinned with declining agricul
tural output.
"Kenya has serious problems
right now," said Spencer
Silberstein, a population expert
for the U.S. Agency for Interna
tional Development. Pressures
on land in some areas of Kenya,
he said, are approaching that of
Bangladesh or Indonesia, whose
birthrates are now declining.
Kenya's rate is increasing.
Zimbabwe is second to Kenya
in Africa, with a growth
rate of about 3.4 percent —
meaning the population will
double in just over 20 years.
In some respects, Kenya, one
of Africa's most advanced
countries, is a victim of its own
progress. It maintains better
statistics than most countries
on the continent so others could
be growing as fast without
knowing it.
Lower death rate
More importantly, population
is increasing at a faster rate
than in other African nations be
cause the death rate is lower.
Life expectancy is 56 years, the
highest in mainland
Africa. The country's death rate
of 14 per 1000 and infant mortal
ity rate of 83 per 1000 are the
lowest on the continent, accord
ing to the Washington-based
Population Reference Bureau.
However, there are 53 births
for every 1000 people, the
highest rate in the world. By
contrast, the U.S. figure is 16.

Silberstein noted that Kenya
is one of the few African coun
tries to have embarked on a
family planning program. "Ser
vices have greatly expanded,
but the results have not," he
said, adding that "there is still
no vigorous government pro
gram."
Only about 3 percent of Ken
yan women practice any
modern method of birth control
and most of those use it to space,
not limit, children.
Salvator Kanani, the Ministry
of Health official in charge of
family planning, said the pro
gram was first announced in
1967. In 1972 a study was carried
out. In 1975 a mother-child
health program was started.
Last year another study was
completed but it has not yet
been presented to the Cabinet.
No family planning budget
There is still no separate
budget for family planning; so
far efforts are almost entirely
informational with little dis
tribution of birth control de
vices.
Since the program was an
nounced in 1967, the population
has shot up from about 10 mil
lion to 16 million and the growth
rate has soared from about 3.5
percent to a World Bank esti
mate of 4 percent.
Kanani disputed the 4 percent
figure, saying he thought it was
about 3.5 percent, but he pro
vided no evidence.
President Daniel Arap Moi,
who has seven children, fre
quently tells people at rallies
that they should limit their off
spring to the number they can
support.
Wider context
African officials often point
out that the population problem
must be examined in a wider
context.

"Dishing out contraceptive
devices is not the answer on its
own," said Simon Mazorodze,
Zimbabwe deputy minister of
health, in a recent interview.
"People want more children
for insurance for their old age,
because of the high infant death
rate" and to provide workers on
their farms, Mazorodze said.
"Public education and increas
ing the standard of living is the
answer." he said.
A Western diplomat in Nairo
bi disagreed with this approach.
"You can't have family plan
ning without birth control de
vices," he said. "Availability,
is the key," he said.
The problem is that, in many
parts of Africa, numbers trans
late into political power. In Ken
ya, where tribal politics has
always been important, the
population of Kikuyu, the larg
est tribe, increased by almost 50
percent between the 1969 and
1979 censuses, while the popu
lation of Luos, their rivals, only
rose by about 25 percent.
Also as a result of the popu
lation growth the sluggish econ
