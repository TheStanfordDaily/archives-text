# McNamara pleads for strong U.S. foreign aid

### Associated Press 
Washington â€” The move by
an austerity-minded Congress
to cut foreign aid to the poorest
nations threatens U.S. security
in an increasingly interdepen
dent world, says retiring World
Bank President Robert
McNamara.
McNamara, defense secre
tary during the Vietnam War
years of the Kennedy and John
son administrations, concluded
his 13-year career at the bank
Tuesday with a plea for the
House to restore nearly $2
billion in previously committed
aid.
In a farewell interview,
McNamara declared that "If
they ( poor countries) fail to pro
duce the food and energy they
are capable of, the pressure on
scarce supplies of food and
energy will raise prices; it will
stimulate inflation in our coun
try."
"If they have economic dis
order, it translates into political
disorder, and political disorder
in various parts of the world ov
erflows and affects us
strategically," he said.
McNamara acknowledged it
is natural for Americans and
Congress to take a dim view of
foreign aid when food stamps.
Social Security and other popu
lar domestic programs are
being cut to fight inflation.
Americans fail to realize,
however, "that these expen
ditures are very much in their
own interest," he argued.
"They fail to recognize what
has happened in the last 10 to 15
years. The world in this very
short time has changed dramat
ically, particularly for the Unit
ed States . . . Our economy is

much more dependent today
than it was 10 or 15 years ago on
the strength of the economies
elsewhere in the world, includ
ing the developing world. One
third of our trade is with the de
veloping world."
McNamara, who plans to be
on boards of corporations and
non-profit institutions, presided
over one last meeting of the 139-
nation bank Tuesday.
McNamara's concern stems
from a House decision Friday,
when it approved a 1982 federal
budget, to reduce a three-year
U.S. contribution to IDA
through 1983 from $3.24 billion to
$1.34 billion.
The House action, unless re
versed, would renege on a com
mitment made by the Carter ad
ministration two years ago, and
continues a 20-year trend of de
clining U.S. foreign aid.
