# Supreme Court decides on women's rights
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington — "Tragic" is the adjective
most often used by those who espouse equal
ity of the sexes to describe two new and im
portant Supreme Court decisions.
In successive days last week, the court
ruled that women can be excluded from mil
itary draft registration and the draft and
that divorced women have no right to share
their ex-husbands' military retirement pay.
Leaders in the women's rights movement
say the court is simultaneously telling wom
en their place is in the home and that, in eco
nomic terms, work in the home accounts for
nothing.
Actually, American women generally
have found a friend in the nation's highest
court since conservative Chief Justice
Warren Burger took office 12 years ago.
The decisions announced Thursday and
Friday of last week are more a reflection of

the extraordinary deference the current
court is willing to give Congress in military
matters than any contempt toward societal
gains by "women.
Earlier this month, for example, the
court provided women with a powerful new
right to sue employers who allegedly pay
them less because of sex bias.

The court ruled for the first time in an Or
egon case involving jail matrons that wom
en can file and win wage-discrimination
lawsuits without proving that they perform
the same jobs as men who get paid more.
Overall, the 1980-81 court term about to
end has not been as successful as recent
terms for those who want to see expanded
legal rights for women.

The court did strike down as unconstitu
tional a Louisiana "head and master law
that allowed husbands, but not wives, to
have exclusive control over jointly owned
property.
But it also ruled that "statutory rape
laws are not invalid just because they make
it a crime for men to have sex with an under
age girl but do not make it a crime for wom
en to have sex with under-age boys.
In two decisions, the court carved out
further exceptions to a woman's right to
have an abortion.
In one, the justices said states may out
law abortions not performed in hospitals af
ter the first three months of pregnancy.
In the other, they ruled that under certain
circumstances states may require that pa
rents be notified when their teen-age daugh
ters seek abortions.
