### Washington Post 
Washington — In the pan
demonium that reigned over the
House floor last Friday night, a
handwritten note was enacted
into law that, for the time being
at least, levels the National Sci
ence Foundation and obliterates
research funds for three other
federal agencies.
A few words scrawled at the
top of a page in President Rea
gan's substitute budget pro
posal called for striking a por
tion of the budget proposal to in
sert different material. What
was deleted was NSF's budget,
as well as the research budgets
of the Department of Energy,
the Environmental Protection
Agency, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Adminis
tration and the Federal Emer
gency Management Agency.
The substitute material con

tained a revised budget only for
the Department of Energy.
That left NSF and three re
search budgets as clippings on
the floor. At first congressmen
and agency officials were as
sured that the deletion was a
mistake that would be corrected
by a quick technical amend
ment, but it became clear that
while the deletion did inad
vertently wipe out a couple of
small business programs, drop
ping the agencies was no acci
dent. It was a Republican mean
euver to strip these budgets out
of the large package.
The science budgets were not
actually killed by the action last
week, but they now must come
up as separate bills before the
Congress. That makes them far
more vulnerable than when they
were safely tucked into the re
cesses of the big budget bill.
