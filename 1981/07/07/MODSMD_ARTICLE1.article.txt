# Exercise, enjoying the area mark their recovery
## Transplant patients recuperating 
### Gail Edmondson Schares 
Stanford Hospital heart-lung
transplant patients Mary Gohlke
and Charles Walker continue to do
well, according to cardiovascular
surgeon Dr. Bruce Reitz.
Gohlke and Walker are the
world's fourth and fifth heart
lung transplant recipients.
Gohlke was released from the
hospital June 1, 11 weeks after her
transplant operation. Walker was
discharged June 17, six weeks af
ter receiving a new heart and
lungs.
"I feel super — I can't believe
it!" Walker said in a phone in
terview Friday evening. Before
the operation, the 30-year-old
mortician from Binghamton,
N.Y. could barely make it to his
car without getting out of breath.
He now strolls with ease through
Stanford Shopping Mall and ped
dles three and a half miles per day
on a stationary bicycle.
Walker is looking forward to
trying out a new bicycle he re
ceived as a gift during his hospital
stay. He is also eager to learn how
to swim and play tennis.
Several nurses from Stanford
Hospital have planned a sightsee
ing trip to San Francisco for
Walker and his mother. "I'm anx
ious to see the city. I've never
been there before," he said.
Walker has not only new-found
strength, but also a new ap
pearance. "Before the operation,
my eyes were bloodshot all the
time. Now I have really beautiful
blue eyes. I never knew that
before," he said.
Like many heart transplant pa
tients, Walker was excited to see
his fingers, toes and lips become
pink and healthy-looking again.
"It's so great not to have purple
lips and red eyeballs," he said.
Gohlke, a 45-year-old news
paper advertising executive from
Arizona, is also recovering well.
According to Reitz, she walks
blocks and blocks each day, and is
lifting weights. "For someone of
her age, her strength and activity
levels are almost normal." Reitz
said.
Gohlke has experienced a slight
tremor or shakiness of the hands
as a side effect of the medication
she must take. According to her
physicians, however, this effect
should disappear within a few
months.
"We see a slight tremor in most
all heart transplant patients,"
said transplant nurse Pat Gam

berg, "It's a well-known side ef
fect of Cyclosporin-A."
After her release from the hos
pital, Gohlke went shopping with
her mother, bought herself a new
dress, and went out to lunch.
"Mary is cheerful and delighted
with herself," said Max Jennings,
executive editor of the Mesa (Ari
zona) Tribune.
Jennings, a close friend and co
worker, is in touch with Gohlke on
a daily basis. "She told me that if
she needed a second transplant,
she would do it all over again," he
said.
Gohlke and Walker both have
the drive and determination to
live that doctors look for in select
ing transplant candidates. "The
whole thing is attitude and coop
eration. You have to be a fighter
to make it through," said Walker.
Like Gohlke. Walker said he
would go through the operation

again if he had to.
Walker doesn't seem to mind
being recognized in public these
days. "If people can see how well
I'm doing, maybe they will donate
their organs too,"Walker stated.
Gohlke and Walker will remain
in the Stanford area for follow-up
care at least until September.
Follow-up includes physical ther
apy and two weekly visits to an
out-patient clinic at Stanford Hos
pital.
Doctors will continue to watch
closely for any signs of infection
or rejection of the new tissue by
the body's defense cells.
"The main problem they face
right now is infection," Reitz
said. So far, neither Gohlke nor
Walker has had any trouble with
infections.
Rejection of the new tissue is a
lesser but on-going concern.

Gohlke had two bouts with rejec
tion during her hospital stay and
has had none since then, accord
ing to Reitz. Walker has had none
at all.
"This experience is fairly typi
cal," Reitz explained, "Half our
regular heart transplant patients
have 1-2 episodes of rejection and
half have none at all.
Reitz has stressed that the op
eration is still considered ex
perimental. "We need at least
several years more experience
before we can say this is a reason
able procedure."
But according to Reitz, the op
erations for Gohlke and Walker
can be considered successful
when they have returned home
and are leading a normal life
again, or as close to that as pos
sible.

dress, and went out to lunch.
"Mary is cheerful and delighted
with herself," said Max Jennings,
executive editor of the Mesa (Ari
zona) Tribune.
Jennings, a close friend and co
worker, is in touch with Gohlke on
a daily basis. "She told me that if
she needed a second transplant,
she would do it all over again," he
said.
Gohlke and Walker both have
the drive and determination to
live that doctors look for in select
ing transplant candidates. "The
whole thing is attitude and coop
eration. You have to be a fighter
to make it through," said Walker.
Like Gohlke. Walker said he
would go through the operation

again if he had to.
Walker doesn't seem to mind
being recognized in public these
days. "If people can see how well
I'm doing, maybe they will donate
their organs too,"Walker stated.
Gohlke and Walker will remain
in the Stanford area for follow-up
care at least until September.
Follow-up includes physical ther
apy and two weekly visits to an
out-patient clinic at Stanford Hos
pital.
Doctors will continue to watch
closely for any signs of infection
or rejection of the new tissue by
the body's defense cells.
"The main problem they face
right now is infection," Reitz
said. So far, neither Gohlke nor
Walker has had any trouble with
infections.
Rejection of the new tissue is a
lesser but on-going concern.

Gohlke had two bouts with rejec
tion during her hospital stay and
has had none since then, accord
ing to Reitz. Walker has had none
at all.
"This experience is fairly typi
cal," Reitz explained, "Half our
regular heart transplant patients
have 1-2 episodes of rejection and
half have none at all.
Reitz has stressed that the op
eration is still considered ex
perimental. "We need at least
several years more experience
before we can say this is a reason
able procedure."
But according to Reitz, the op
erations for Gohlke and Walker
can be considered successful
when they have returned home
and are leading a normal life
again, or as close to that as pos
sible.

Stanford Hospital heart-lung
transplant patients Mary Gohlke
and Charles Walker continue to do
well, according to cardiovascular
surgeon Dr. Bruce Reitz.
Gohlke and Walker are the
world's fourth and fifth heart
lung transplant recipients.
Gohlke was released from the
hospital June 1, 11 weeks after her
transplant operation. Walker was
discharged June 17, six weeks af
ter receiving a new heart and
lungs.
"I feel super — I can't believe
it!" Walker said in a phone in
terview Friday evening. Before
the operation, the 30-year-old
mortician from Binghamton,
N.Y. could barely make it to his
car without getting out of breath.
He now strolls with ease through
Stanford Shopping Mall and ped
dles three and a half miles per day
on a stationary bicycle.
Walker is looking forward to
trying out a new bicycle he re
ceived as a gift during his hospital
stay. He is also eager to learn how
to swim and play tennis.
Several nurses from Stanford
Hospital have planned a sightsee
ing trip to San Francisco for
Walker and his mother. "I'm anx
ious to see the city. I've never
been there before," he said.
Walker has not only new-found
strength, but also a new ap
pearance. "Before the operation,
my eyes were bloodshot all the
time. Now I have really beautiful
blue eyes. I never knew that
before," he said.
Like many heart transplant pa
tients, Walker was excited to see
his fingers, toes and lips become
pink and healthy-looking again.
"It's so great not to have purple
lips and red eyeballs," he said.
Gohlke, a 45-year-old news
paper advertising executive from
Arizona, is also recovering well.
According to Reitz, she walks
blocks and blocks each day, and is
lifting weights. "For someone of
her age, her strength and activity
levels are almost normal." Reitz
said.
Gohlke has experienced a slight
tremor or shakiness of the hands
as a side effect of the medication
she must take. According to her
physicians, however, this effect
should disappear within a few
months.
"We see a slight tremor in most
all heart transplant patients,"
said transplant nurse Pat Gam

berg, "It's a well-known side ef
fect of Cyclosporin-A."
After her release from the hos
pital, Gohlke went shopping with
her mother, bought herself a new
dress, and went out to lunch.
"Mary is cheerful and delighted
with herself," said Max Jennings,
executive editor of the Mesa (Ari
zona) Tribune.
