# Peninsula railroad, bus routes serve Stanford area
## Sans trans? Unnecessary with Sam Trans 
### Clint Powell 
For adventuresome students
who want to explore the Bay Area,
but don't have personal transpor
tation, there is hope. Two easy
ways to venture up the Peninsula
to San Francisco and beyond are
the Southern Pacific (SP) rail
road and the San Mateo County
Transit buses.
The SP Peninsula daily route
connects San Jose, San Francisco
and 24 stops in between. From the
Palo Alto depot, at the intersec
tion of University Ave. and El
Camino Real (5-10 minutes from
Tresidder Union by bicycle), $2.55
for a one-way ticket will get you to
San Francisco in just under an
hour.
A somewhat more tedious but
less expensive option for city
bound travelers is the San Mateo
County Transit service, which op
erates an "express" (the 7F line)
to the airport and San Francisco.
The average run from the Stan
ford shopping Center to the Trans
bay Terminal at First and Mission

in the city takes about 75 minutes,
and costs $1.10.
Economy vs. time, and the
quality of the trip up the Peninsu
la are the main considerations in
choosing between the SP and
SamTrans. The train ride, more
than twice as expensive as the
bus, provides a much more scenic
view of the Peninsula's rolling
hills. You'll know you've been on a
train, however — the jarring and
screeching of the old railroad cars
are reminiscent of the iron horses
of a century ago.
SamTrans' streamlines buses
are much smoother on the road
and are better suited to the aver
age student's pocketbook. Al
though the view along the El
Camino-Bayshore Freeway route
taken by the express bus isn't ex
actly postcard quality, the sav
ings on fare may make the longer
ride worth it.
Both the SP and SamTrans are
well integrated into the overall
Bay Area transit system. BART,
which links up San Francisco with

Oakland and the rest of the East
Bay, is just a block away from the
bus depot in San Francisco, and a
5-minute bus ride away from the
SP station. The Transbay Termi
nals is sort of a transportation
clearinghouse — buses serving
Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin
and San Francisco counties are
available there.
In the South Bay, the main car

riers are SamTrans and the Santa
Clara County Transit service,
which operates buses between
San Jose, Menlo Park and Fre
mont. Both lines stop on the Stan
ford campus in front of the Quad,
and special services such as sen
ior citizen's discounts and wheel
chair access are provided.
Information on all routes, fares
and special services is readily

available — schedules for San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties
can be found at the information
desk on the second floor of Tres
idder. For the more adven
turesome, Tresidder also has a
pamphlet entitled the Bay Area
Regional Transit Guide, which
provides information on all the
various services throughout the
area.
