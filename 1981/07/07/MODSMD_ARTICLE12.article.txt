## Educating teachers key to better education 
### Claire Silberman 
The quality of teachers and
teaching has been under attack
recently. One must ask, however,
how this evaluation has been
made and if it is a fair one.

Stanford is deeply involved in
the educating of educators. The
School of Education here is
considered one of the best in the
country, and the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) is the only one of its kind
— it offers both a teaching creden
tial and a masters in education in
one year.
According to Anna Richert,
program administrator for
STEP, the general decline in
education is due in part to a de
cline in public support for educa
tion. With the proposed federal
budget cuts now being considered

by Congress, teacher morale and
confidence are low, and this in
turn provides for a bad self-im
age. As the average age of teach
ers rises, fewer new ideas are in
troduced into teaching, and a kind
of generation gap develops be
tween teacher and student.
J. Myron Atkin, dean of educa
tion, said that historical factors
account for the decline. In the
past, said Atkin, an exceptional
group of teachers — mostly wom
en — was available to the school
districts that wanted them. Today
that group is diminishing, accord
ing to Atkin, largely because
there are more options open to
women in the entire job market.
Therefore, teaching today is ac
tually just reaching its "average"
level, he said.
Another historical factor has
been the enormous diversification
of students attending public
schools that has taken place dur

ing the last 30 years. More minor
ity groups — ranging from the
poor to blacks to the handicapped
— are being taught than ever
before, and the public school sys
tem as a whole has not been able
to adjust to this influx.
With more minority students in
the student body, public schools
are caught in a bind. Because pub
lic schools seek to foster equality
among students, teachers' efforts
may be channelled away from the
relatively well-off, and usually
more advanced, students, to the
less well-off. Therefore, parents
of the former group are more like
ly to send their children to private
schools.
Atkin said that the nation must
rediscover some consensus, or na
tional vision, in order to eliminate
the image of public education as
"error-prone" and 'villainous.' If
this vision is a unifying one, he
said, public education will be

brought back into the spotlight.
Otherwise, the fragmentary trend
could continue through such plans
as tax-credits for parents with
children in private schools. In this
case, public schools will probably
continue to deteriorate as special
interest groups gain influence.
Atkin said that educational pro
grams today are very well-inten
tioned, even if they are not always
able to achieve their goals.
"There are no villains in this
piece," he said.
Government wants to allow ev
eryone the right to an education,
but in so doing, there are some se
rious side-effects. First, the re
sponsibility of the teacher is
lessened as government pre
scribes more and more programs.
However, Atkin said, the opposite
should be happening: teachers,
principals, and local school
boards are best able to know the
needs of their districts, and there

fore legislation should be de
signed to help them handle ex
panded tasks themselves. Such in
creased responsibility would up
grade the teaching profession and
would also require better teach
ers in order for the system to
function well.
An important point to be con
sidered is that of the school as a
major instrument of social
change, especially in race-related
areas. Atkin said this presents a
'moral dilemma': to what extent
are children being used to solve
their parents' problems? Oppo
nents of busing, for example,
often blame schools for society's
racial problems, said Atkins.
Richert added, if students are
not performing well, people are
quick to blame those who play the
most visible role in their educa
tion — their teachers.
