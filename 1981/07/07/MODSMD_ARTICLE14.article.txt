## An underground economist surfaces 
### 
I am an underground econo
mist. I am a sick man, I am a dis
eased man, but I don't understand
my disease. I went to the KFC
(Kentucky Fried Chicken), but
having no MPC (Marginal Pro
pensity to Consume), I went to the
JIB (Jack in the Box). I ordered
an ice cream. I was demanding,
but they weren't supplying. "No
ice cream," they told me. "Try
the Foster's Old Fashion
Freeze."
"The what?" I queried with a
lack of understanding.
"The FOFF."
"Oh yeah," I responded
Then it hit me. The truth, the
guiding light. Economics doesn't
depend on demand. It depends on
supply. The ice cream theory . . .
Wow, I thought to myself. I bet I
can write this up and make mil
lions. I drew a curve on a napkin:

I spent a year in Southern Cali
fornia testing my theory. Novem
ber, December, hardly any
drownings, hardly any ice cream
supply. June, July. August supply
up, drowning up. September,
great ice cream left over from the
past three months, but few drown
ings. I knew that I was right,
somehow I'd seen that curve
before, but I couldn't fathom
where. I turned around and glared
at the blonde in the string bikini
behind me. I knew I'd seen that
curve before, and now I'd found it.
I made further study for a few
months. Then she left me.
I was the underdog. The other
economists didn't believe me. I
spent years finding evidence that
the curve worked in virtually ev
ery situation: rutabaga cul
tivation, termite mound construc
tion, even tax cuts!

Well, I finally sold. When
Ronald Reagan needed a few ad
visors I found myself among the
nation's elite, forming the new
budget. "It's all a matter of supp
ly," I told them. "Social services,
who needs 'em. You don't supply
money and the people make due.
It increases their incentive to
work. If they don't have any mon
ey, they'll be creative. Just think
of the possibilities. They could use
Brillo pads as a non-Dairy
creamer, Vienna sausages for
golf balls, and pet Coke bottles to
entertain the kids. So we'll change
things a little bit. After all, we
know what's best for the nation."
I took my little curve out of my
pocket. I scratched out the units
and explained my theory. "Incen
tives, it's all a matter of incen
tives. If someone is going to
starve, he or she will have such in
centive that food will spontane
ously appear. It's all a matter of
psychology. When you put two
sock into the drier, does only one
come out? Of course not. You only
think so. When you lose a social
security or welfare check from
the government, do you really
lose money? Of course not. You
only think so."
I told a parable to elucidate my
point. "A chemist, a physicist,
and an economist were stranded
on a desert island with only a sin
gle can of tuna for sustenance,
the chemist said, 'Well, I'm really
hungry, but it will have to wait.
We'll simply set up an electrolysis
reaction and dissolve the edges of
the can to get it open.' The physi
cist interjected, 'No, we'll simply
focus the sunlight through my

glasses lens perpendicular to the
best heat conducting point on the
can and the increased pressure,
resulting from the increased tem
perature, will open the can.' The
economist slyly looked at both of
them and said, 'You both are mak
ing this far too difficult. Just as
sume you have a can opener.' "
„ The next attack was on wasted
government spending. The people
said there was waste, the Presi
dent said there was waste, and by
God I'd find that waste and give
'em the waste they wanted.
The GSA alone went through
500,000 paper clips a day, need
lessly tossed out with 70 tons ox
waste paper. I pulled out my
curve, I scratched on new units.
The President agreed.
We hired a new work force to
take all those paper clips off that
waste paper before it went to the
incinerator. Net effect: we saved
an estimated 500 million dollars,
allowing a 97 percent tax cut.
Well, the future was cut out for
us. We eliminated taxes; we
eliminated wasted government
spending; we cut services to the
bone; but the budget remained the
same. "Of course," I said as I
filled by pockets with crisp 100's,
"it's all a matter of supply."

budget. "It's all a matter of supp
ly," I told them. "Social services,
who needs 'em. You don't supply
money and the people make due.
It increases their incentive to
work. If they don't have any mon
ey, they'll be creative. Just think
of the possibilities. They could use
Brillo pads as a non-Dairy
creamer, Vienna sausages for
golf balls, and pet Coke bottles to
entertain the kids. So we'll change
things a little bit. After all, we
know what's best for the nation."
I took my little curve out of my
pocket. I scratched out the units
and explained my theory. "Incen
tives, it's all a matter of incen
tives. If someone is going to
starve, he or she will have such in
centive that food will spontane
ously appear. It's all a matter of
psychology. When you put two
sock into the drier, does only one
come out? Of course not. You only
think so. When you lose a social
security or welfare check from
the government, do you really
lose money? Of course not. You
only think so."
I told a parable to elucidate my
point. "A chemist, a physicist,
and an economist were stranded
on a desert island with only a sin
gle can of tuna for sustenance,
the chemist said, 'Well, I'm really
hungry, but it will have to wait.
We'll simply set up an electrolysis
reaction and dissolve the edges of
the can to get it open.' The physi
cist interjected, 'No, we'll simply
focus the sunlight through my

glasses lens perpendicular to the
best heat conducting point on the
can and the increased pressure,
resulting from the increased tem
perature, will open the can.' The
economist slyly looked at both of
them and said, 'You both are mak
ing this far too difficult. Just as
sume you have a can opener.' "
„ The next attack was on wasted
government spending. The people
said there was waste, the Presi
dent said there was waste, and by
God I'd find that waste and give
'em the waste they wanted.
The GSA alone went through
500,000 paper clips a day, need
lessly tossed out with 70 tons ox
waste paper. I pulled out my
curve, I scratched on new units.
The President agreed.
We hired a new work force to
take all those paper clips off that
waste paper before it went to the
incinerator. Net effect: we saved
an estimated 500 million dollars,
allowing a 97 percent tax cut.
Well, the future was cut out for
us. We eliminated taxes; we
eliminated wasted government
spending; we cut services to the
bone; but the budget remained the
same. "Of course," I said as I
filled by pockets with crisp 100's,
"it's all a matter of supply."

Ice cream supply
I am an underground econo
mist. I am a sick man, I am a dis
eased man, but I don't understand
my disease. I went to the KFC
(Kentucky Fried Chicken), but
having no MPC (Marginal Pro
pensity to Consume), I went to the
JIB (Jack in the Box). I ordered
an ice cream. I was demanding,
but they weren't supplying. "No
ice cream," they told me. "Try
the Foster's Old Fashion
Freeze."
"The what?" I queried with a
lack of understanding.
"The FOFF."
"Oh yeah," I responded
Then it hit me. The truth, the
guiding light. Economics doesn't
depend on demand. It depends on
supply. The ice cream theory . . .
Wow, I thought to myself. I bet I
can write this up and make mil
lions. I drew a curve on a napkin:

I spent a year in Southern Cali
fornia testing my theory. Novem
ber, December, hardly any
drownings, hardly any ice cream
supply. June, July. August supply
up, drowning up. September,
great ice cream left over from the
past three months, but few drown
ings. I knew that I was right,
somehow I'd seen that curve
before, but I couldn't fathom
where. I turned around and glared
at the blonde in the string bikini
behind me. I knew I'd seen that
curve before, and now I'd found it.
I made further study for a few
months. Then she left me.
I was the underdog. The other
economists didn't believe me. I
spent years finding evidence that
the curve worked in virtually ev
ery situation: rutabaga cul
tivation, termite mound construc
tion, even tax cuts!

Well, I finally sold. When
Ronald Reagan needed a few ad
visors I found myself among the
nation's elite, forming the new
budget. "It's all a matter of supp
ly," I told them. "Social services,
who needs 'em. You don't supply
money and the people make due.
It increases their incentive to
work. If they don't have any mon
ey, they'll be creative. Just think
of the possibilities. They could use
