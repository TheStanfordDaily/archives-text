## Accept my message: it's a Gift 
### 
It was only a few months ago that I first dis
covered that I possess The Gift, that special in
sight into God's strange design that blesses — and
curses — so few. The revelation came south of
Taos, New Mexico, where a former friend named
Onesto Stubbs (he's dead now) and I were driving
along in the Firebird enjoying the hot weather and
the scenery.
Suddenly Onesto screamed, and to our horror a
small dog bounced off our speeding fender. I
slammed on the brakes and walked back to where
the limp puppy lay in the road.
"Poor little poochie," Onesto said.
"So cute and innocent," I murmured sadly.
Just then we both noticed something else: a dent
in the front bumper. Not big, but still significant.
"Did you see what that little booger did to our
nice car?" whispered Onesto, his face turning red.
Onesto offered to get out the BB gun and plug the
corpse a few times as a sort of obligatory retribu
tion, but I had a better idea Getting a rope out of
the trunk, we tied one end to the grubby little
mongrel and the other end to the rear bumper.

Then we proceded to town, dragging our new pet
behind us a high speed, shouting out the window,
"Hurry up, Spike! C'mon boy! You're falling be
hind! Show em some speed, Spike! Giddyup!"
We paraded like that, through the middle of
town, drawing many stares — old Rotarians and
overfed Miss Lonelies who couldn't dissassociate
the spirit from the flesh.
"Hey, it's okay! He's dead anyway!" We re
assured the onlookers, but things started to look a
little hairy with some senior citizens outside the
A&P so we cut the rope and escaped into the moun
tains.
That night as the mist rolled up the canyon I
wondered: Was I trying to give people a message?
Did I have something special to say?
And suddenly I knew. I was Chosen. I had the
Gift.
This column — which will appear regularly as
long as the spineless cretins who run this paper
don't geek out completely — is my gift to you.
