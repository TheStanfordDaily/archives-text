## Civil defense concept dangerous nonsense 
### 
Edward Teller's assertion
(Daily, July 2) that civil defense
will enable the USSR to emerge
from all-out nuclear war "larger
and stronger than before" strikes
me as dangerous nonsense. Non
sense because the United States
could — with only a fraction of its
nuclear arsenal -r destroy every
Soviet industrial center and its
surrounding area, and kill at least
100 million Soviets in the initial
blasts and fall-out.
There is simply no way the So
viet Union could survive all-out
nuclear war with only "insignifi
cant" losses. One need only try to
imagine millions upon millions of
Soviets evacuating their homes in
the sub-zero weather of a Russian

winter, remaining underground
for weeks, and emerging into a
devastated landscape containing
nothing but contaminated
corpses.
How could the few sickened and
hungry survivors "demand and
get food, machinery, whatever
they needed to re-establish them
selves" — especially with all
their ports and transportation fa
cilities destroyed?
The Soviet leaders themselves
envision no such possibility. All
available evidence indicates that
Soviet civil defense efforts are in
tended only to deal with the rela
tively small threat of a nuclear at
tack by China.
In urging a civil defense build
up by the United States (so that
"if we saw that the Soviets were
evacuating their cities we could
the same even faster"), Dr.
Teller is encouraging a dangerous
policy.
If the United States could
launch a major civil defense ef
fort, the Soviets would have every
reason to view it as a seriously
threatening move, a clear indica
tion that we consider nuclear war
winnable and might well under
take a first strike. At the same
time, the American people would
be further gulled into accepting
nuclear war as "thinkable." If we
can survive, why not?
Former Ambassador George
Kennan answered the question
"Why not?" in a recent article in
the New York Review of Books.
Nuclear weapons, he said, are
"something with which you de
stroy indiscriminately the lives,
the substance, the culture, the
civilization, the hopes, of entire
peoples . - something with which
in a moment of petulance or panic
you perpetrate upon the helpless
people of another country such
fearful acts of destructin as no
sane person would ever wish to
have upon his conscience."
Dr. Teller's arguments for
"civil defense" serve only to
downplay the enormous threat to
mankind these arsenals contain.
This threat can only be lessened
through an agreement between
both superpowers to reduce nucle
ar arms — not by digging bomb
shelters or planning evacuation
routes through the suburbs.
