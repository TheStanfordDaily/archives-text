Geography should count. A
great power ought to be able to ex
ercise most influence in its im
mediate vicinity, where it has ad
vantages of easy transportation
and communications, and mili
tary presence. It consequently
must be accounted a singular fail
ure of American foreign policy
that an island 90 miles from
our shores has for 20 years
held to a hostile course, despite

the fact the two countries have
complementary rather than con
flicting interests and have no real
reason to quarrel.
The United States has obviously
failed to make good use of its
means of influence in the part of
the world where it is strongest.
If a small country sits next to
Soviet power centers, one would
assume it would for practical rea
sons remain on good terms with
the giant, even though it differs
ideologically, as does Finland.
One would also expect the Soviet
Union to endeavor to influence the
smaller country by maximizing
its diplomatic presence, promot
ing cultural exchanges, and in
creasing trade, perhaps joint ven
tures.

At least, the Soviet Union would
make it advantageous for the
small country to remain on good
terms â€” as it has done in the case
of Finland.
The United States, on the con
trary, has done just the opposite
in relation to Cuba, withdrawing
its diplomatic presence, cutting
off travel by Americans to the is
land, and embargoing trade. It
would seem that U.S. policy was

designed to remove its influence
and to compel Cuba to rely on the
Soviet Union. The only rationale
for this procedure would be that it
would lead the Cubans to rise and
cast down their dictator. Such an
expectation came from the good
old days when a cold shoulder
from Uncle Sam was enough to
cause the immediate fall of a Cen
tral American or Caribbean gov
ernment, but it was naive from
the beginning. In any case, two
decades have shown its fatuity;
isolation has only facilitated the
communization of the island, and
the trade embargo has given
Fidel Castro the best excuse for
all manner of failures beyond
those caused by the cutoff of trade
with Cuba's natural partner.

There is no need to make any
gifts to a regime that has made
anti-U.S. positions its way of life.
But if the U.S. placed no obstacles
in the way of tourism and trade
with Cuba, it seems clear that
strong current would rapidly
erode holes in Cuban com
munism. The potential income
from swarms of American tour
ists would be an irresistible temp
tation and would make it very dif

ficult to maintain the devil-image
of the United States.
As a trading partner, the Unit
ed States is vastly more attrac
tive than the Soviet Union, with
its shortages, poor quality, lim
ited variety of goods, slow de
liveries, red tape, and bureau
cratic inefficiency.

In all probability, if trade were
made quite free, in short order at
least half of Cuba's foreign trade
would be with the United States
and the Cubans would be trying to
lure a large volume of U.S. invest
ment.
This would not mean that
Castro would fall, but he would
probably become much more like
traditional Latin American dic
tators.
But if Castro's positions would
be weakened by opening his king
dom to U.S. influence, why would
he permit such a thing? If he did
not, he would take on the onus for
hurting his economy. It would be
the easier course for Castro's gov
ernment, and he would be under
great pressure if he tried to resist.
The chief argument against
thus using U.S. influence is a per
verse one: that it would lessen
Cuban dependence on the Soviet
Union and hence relive the Soviets
of a burden of some $2 billion per
year to keep the Cuban economy
afloat. But the Soviets obviously
feel it is well worth the money to
keep Cuba in their camp, and it

would be worth many billions per
year to the U.S. not to have an ene
my power on the doorstep. The
end of Cuban radicalism would be
a formidable plus for hemispheric
security and a big step backward
for the Soviet empire.
In 1972, President Richard Nix
on, in perhaps the most successful
single act of his presidency, ended
a generation of sterile hostility
and boycott of the People's Re
public of China by going to Bei
jing. China has not become a free
or democratic country, but it has
moved far from its revolutionary
Maoist passions and is de facto
one of the most important allies of
the U.S. in containing Soviet ex
pansionism.
There is no need for such a dra
matic gesture as a presidential
weekend in Havana, but it is time
to put to use the great potential in
fluence of the United States in its
backyard.
