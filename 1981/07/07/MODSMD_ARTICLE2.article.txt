University President Donald
Kennedy will leave for Washing
ton, D.C. Thursday to protest the
deletion of the National Science
Foundation (NSF) budget from
the legislative packet approved
by the House on June 26.
Kennedy "was appalled" upon
learning of the omission, said
Robert Freelen, associate vice
president for public affairs.
Although the House did not end
funding for the NSF it will now

come up separately before Con
gress and will therefore be more
subject to reductions than when it
was part of the original budget
proposal.
"The University received ap
proximately $35,000,000 from the
NSF this year which represents a
third of the research volume,"
said Sponsored Projects Office
Director Earl Cilley. However,
Cilley didn't react to the House ac
tion "with a great sense of con
cern." He believes that Congress

"has a pretty clear understanding
of the kinds of programs NSF is
heavily involved in ... It is a
worry though," he added.
"If the funds are cut, it would
be incredibly short-sighted and
critical to our educational pro
grams here," said Biology Dept.
Chairman Robert Schimke. "A
substantial cut in NSF funds
would be extremely serious." Of
the major areas, plant sciences
and population biology-ecology
would be the most adversely af
fected since other departments,
such as molecular biology, also
receive funds from the National
Institutes of Health.
Chemistry Dept. Chairman
John Brauman agreed that a cut
in NSF funds would have a "dra
matic effect." "About half of our
total research support comes
from them. It would cause our re
search productivity to be signifi
cantly impaired and the number
of graduate students we keep on
stipend would have to be de
creased."
In the psychology department,
25 percent of the graduate stu
dents depend on NSF funds. In ad
dition. approximately SO percent
of the research grants come from
the NSF, according to psychology
administrative assistant Linda
Heider.
Harvard, which received $12.4
million from the NSF last year, is
also upset about the possible loss
of funds according to The
Harvard Crimson. Associate
Dean of Research Richard Leahy
stated, "It is very hard to ration
ally explain a cut like that at a
critical juncture in the progress
of research."
