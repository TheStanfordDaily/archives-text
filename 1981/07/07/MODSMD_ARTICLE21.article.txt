## 'Bloolips' in SF: an anachronism 
### Stephen Nash 
Bloolips is a collection of six
British men who have combined
aspects of music hall, per
formance art, and radical street
drag into crazy, cabaret-style en
tertainments. They are currently
performing at the Boarding
House in San Francisco after a
successful season in New York.
They won an Obie for their in
novative costumes, and were
written about in everything from
American Jewish Life to the New
York Times (as well as all the
more expected places like the Vil
lage Voice and New York Native.)
Here in San Francisco, their work

seems tired and hopelessly out of
context — possibly because of
their performance space, but
more probably because they have
misjudged the local political and
artistic scene.
Bloolips calls its current work
"Lust in Space." It starts out in a
nuclear laundromat with jokes
about Queen Elizabeth's laundry,
but spends most of its time on the

moon with an evening of cultural
exchange. This includes a series
of musical numbers such as the
Cheese Number, starring Jane
Fondue and Miss Cottage Cheese,
and also encounters with James
Pond, a Russian folk-dance
troupe, and Miss Havisham from
"Great Expectations."
The music for the show consists
of well-known tunes ("In the
Mood," "Rock Around the
Clock," the "Alleluia" chorus)
with new lyrics which consist in
most part of simplistic comments
about sex roles and other pop top
ics. The script and the costumes
are used to parody masculine and

feminine stereotypes. Nothing is
very profound — wearing junk
store women's clothing, carrying
around pink triangles, and men
tioning gay lib are supposed to be
radical and shocking all by them
selves.
If this show were local and new,
there would be little more to say
about it. But it has been imported
from New York, the performers

are from England, and the group
has been widely praised on the
East coast (the press packet
comes with about twenty New
York reviews). Why should this
show seem so empty in San Fran
cisco?
Part of it may be the location.
The Boarding House is a night
club with a real stage, pro
fessional lighting, fancy drinks,
well-dressed people, and ex
pensive prices. Bloolips comes
out of street drag and punk per
formance art. Their work is bet
ter suited to alternate spaces such
as 80 Langton, with an audience
that lives in South-of-Market lofts

rather than Haight-Ashbury Vic
torians.
Another factor might be the ar
tistic climate. I haven't been to
New York lately, and I certainly
not up on the latest in New Wave
sensibilities — a few years ago,
everyone had a point of view;
now, sensibilities are all the rage.
It could be that Bloolips fits very

nicely into that world. Out here,
the best performance art is in
trospective, mystifying, and well
crafted. Bloolips' inane jokes and
amateurish performance style
doesn't stand a chance against it.
The most important reason that
this show fails may well be the po
litical climate of San Francisco.
For Bloolips to be shocking, open
ly gay people and drag have to be
shocking. Here, where last week's
Gay Freedom Day parade is the

city's biggest event, and where
the Sisters of Perpetual In
dulgence (a group of radical gay
men who dress up as nuns) are an
established part of the political
scene, Bloolips is an
anachronism. More radical and
intelligent statements are being
made daily on the streets and at
City Hall than are being made on
the stage at the Boarding House.
"Lust in Space" is a show
which relies on the audience for
its effect. Maybe New Yorkers
are still hung-up about what cos
tumes they wear on the streets, or
about whether the performer
they're watching on stage is gay
or straight. Out here, it all seems
rather passe.
