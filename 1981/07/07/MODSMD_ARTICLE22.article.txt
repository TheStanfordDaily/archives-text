# Punk is alive and vomiting at Mabuhay Gardens
## 
### Charles Buckley Tony Kelly 
Punk Rock — Spitting, vomit
ing, thrashing, everything
you've-heard-about-it-is-true
punk rock. Many rock and roll
PhDs wrote it off as dead not so
long ago. Such are the dangers of
academia. Anyone who happened
to attend the Dead Kennedys'
show at the Mabuhay Gardens
last Thursday night was clearly
aware that punk is still alive and
kicking.
The combination of a Fab Mab
crowd and the Dead Kennedys
was enough to prove that earth
quakes are not the biggest danger
in San Francisco. It surely would
have been more safe and com
fortable to have been on Broad
way in 1906 than last Thursday
night.
The evening's festivities began
with a Texas-based band (punks
from Texas? Right. . .) called the
Dicks, who played nine straight
songs about "killing rich people"
(their words). The only word that
comes to our collective minds
about the Dicks is "Sucko." This
is known in the trade as "critical
insight."
The Dicks were followed by an
other Texas band called the
Stains, who seem to have trav
elled to San Francisco to prove
that they're not only the worst
band in Texas, but in the rest of
the United States as well. It was
as if Fab Mab owner Dirk "The
Jerk" Dirksen has pulled out four
members of the audience and told
them to supply a two-chord bar
rage poor enough to make one ap
preciate Dick-music.
Throughout both acts, the au
dience proved to be equally, if not
more irritating than either of the
bands. Though the back tables
were full of many long-hair types
(you know who you are) who were
busy listening to CSNY in the
summer of 1976 and thus trying to
make up for lost time, the dance
floor near the stage housed a
prime collection of skinheads,
nazi youths, and leather-clad pill
poppers. Fun bunch, eh?
The two intrepid cub reporters
in the audience, encouraged by
the "Over 18 Only" sign at the
door, had originally intended to
stand near the stage. They how
ever quickly changed their minds,
scurrying off to seats at the side of
the floor, and missing out on the

pushing, shoving and kicking that
could render them incapable of
relating their experiences. Self
preservation? Never a thought.
This is known in the trade as
"journalistic dedication."
In deference to club owner
Dirksen, he did his best to keep
things out of control. At one point
between sets in which Dirk was
searching for a word to describe
his customers, one astute chap
helped him out by shouting
"Animals, fucking animals!" in a
proud, gutteral voice. Who needs
a thesaurus at the Fab Mab?
Dirksen proved to be far from
an expert on animal psychology,
however, ordering a few punk
groupies to quit sitting on the
stage so that other less sedate
folks could have more room to get
up on the stage and dive headfirst
back into the audience. Far be it
from Dirk's power to stand in the
way of the latest punk trend.
Another crowd-pleasing man
oeuvre was Dirksen's claiming
that the Dead Kennedys would
"be on in five minutes" at least
three times over a half-hour span.
Just when everyone was hot and
bothered enough to get really vi
olent, the Dead Kennedys took the
stage. This is timing.
The DKs opened with a series of
new, unrecorded songs that, sim
ply put, did not work — either be
cause they were unfamiliar, or
because they were truly weaker
punk thrashes.
One sign of originality early on
was the introduction of one song
as "Nazi Punks, Fuck Off," hint
ing at a mild dissatisfaction at the
violent scenery in front of the
band. Like the rest of the first
songs, however, its tribal-stomp
music only egged the Nazi punks
further in their headbanging au
dience warfare.

Throughout the set, lead vocal
ist and onetime SF mayoral con
didate (he placed fourth out of 10)
Jello Biafra busied himself with
his usual/legendary frenzied the
atrics. Jello's headlong dives into
the crowd earned the most points
for style, mainly due to the fact
that he continued to "sing" as he
dove.
Actually, Jello is a finer vocal
ist than your typical punk
screamer — he has at least a pass
ing acquaintance with the words
"on key." Though one doesn't
necessarily know what Biafra is
saying, at least one can tell that
he is truly singing.
It wasn't until the second half of
the set, though, when the DKs
began to play material of their
"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegeta
bles" LP, that the music picked
up enough to satisfy the few in the
crowd who bothered to listen in
stead of fight. "Police Truck,"
featuring EB Ray's James Bond
style guitar licks, turned the band
into more than just a rhythm sec
tion for Jello. The hour-long set
reached its peak near the end with
its pairing of the Dead Kennedys
two biggest selling singles, "Holi
day in Cambodia" and "Califor
nia Über Alles."
More than any other Biafra
composition, "Holiday in Cam
bodia" is the quintessential Dead
Kennedys song, — challenging the
middle-class security of a fash
ionably liberal college student
(hm. .
Play ethnicky jazz to parade
your snazz/on your five grand
stereo! Hraggin' that you know
how the niggers feel cold/and the
slums got so much soul/what you
need is a holiday in Cambodia.
Fortunately, the music doesn't
bury the lyrics here, as the band
wisely avoid traditional punk

cliches in favor of a tighter, even
melodic sound.
At the end of "Holiday," EB
Ray and bassist Klaus Fluoride
fell into an old-time blues riff as
Jello ad-libbed a sarcastic im
personation of President Ronald
Reagan. As the interlude
progressed, it became clear that
the group had updated its onetime
ode to Governor Jerry Brown,
"California Über Alles." Rather
than dwell on a "suede/denim se
cret police" of Zen fascists forc
ing all to "jog for the master
Race" — as in the Brown version
— the new lyrics are directed
more toward the current reality
of people who are more concerned
with the Giants than El Salvador.
The song, and its revis on, proves
further the lack of sar red cows in
punk rock.
Finally, for the encore came
the DKs new single "To Drunk to
Fuck," currently topping the
charts in England despite a BBC

ban (wonder why. . .). Though ob
viously not calculated to go over
big on American Bandstand, its
rhythm-and-blues base is far eas
ier to handle than the usual tom
my-gun guitar, and as such it
belongs with the band's best
songs.
To see that the Fab Mab was
still in one piece when the Dead
Kennedys left the stage was
something of a surprise. Ap
parently, the animals in the au
dience had enough respect for
harmless rebellion so as not to de
stroy the place completely. Aside
from the bruises, the mob had
been given a representative eve
ning of punk rock, featuring one
awful band, one mediocre one,
and one fine group in the Dead
Kennedys. One could say that the
punk spirit of 1976 came back to
life Thursday night, but the more
likely truism is that it's always
been there for whomever wanted
to dive in — head first, of course.

crowd and the Dead Kennedys
was enough to prove that earth
quakes are not the biggest danger
in San Francisco. It surely would
have been more safe and com
fortable to have been on Broad
way in 1906 than last Thursday
night.
The evening's festivities began
with a Texas-based band (punks
from Texas? Right. . .) called the
Dicks, who played nine straight
songs about "killing rich people"
(their words). The only word that
comes to our collective minds
about the Dicks is "Sucko." This
is known in the trade as "critical
insight."
The Dicks were followed by an
other Texas band called the
Stains, who seem to have trav
elled to San Francisco to prove
that they're not only the worst
band in Texas, but in the rest of
the United States as well. It was
as if Fab Mab owner Dirk "The
Jerk" Dirksen has pulled out four
members of the audience and told
them to supply a two-chord bar
rage poor enough to make one ap
preciate Dick-music.
Throughout both acts, the au
dience proved to be equally, if not
more irritating than either of the
bands. Though the back tables
were full of many long-hair types
(you know who you are) who were
busy listening to CSNY in the
summer of 1976 and thus trying to
make up for lost time, the dance
floor near the stage housed a
prime collection of skinheads,
nazi youths, and leather-clad pill
poppers. Fun bunch, eh?
The two intrepid cub reporters
in the audience, encouraged by
the "Over 18 Only" sign at the
door, had originally intended to
stand near the stage. They how
ever quickly changed their minds,
scurrying off to seats at the side of
the floor, and missing out on the

pushing, shoving and kicking that
could render them incapable of
relating their experiences. Self
preservation? Never a thought.
This is known in the trade as
"journalistic dedication."
In deference to club owner
Dirksen, he did his best to keep
things out of control. At one point
between sets in which Dirk was
searching for a word to describe
his customers, one astute chap
helped him out by shouting
"Animals, fucking animals!" in a
proud, gutteral voice. Who needs
a thesaurus at the Fab Mab?
Dirksen proved to be far from
an expert on animal psychology,
however, ordering a few punk
groupies to quit sitting on the
stage so that other less sedate
folks could have more room to get
up on the stage and dive headfirst
back into the audience. Far be it
from Dirk's power to stand in the
way of the latest punk trend.
Another crowd-pleasing man
oeuvre was Dirksen's claiming
that the Dead Kennedys would
"be on in five minutes" at least
three times over a half-hour span.
Just when everyone was hot and
bothered enough to get really vi
olent, the Dead Kennedys took the
stage. This is timing.
The DKs opened with a series of
new, unrecorded songs that, sim
ply put, did not work — either be
cause they were unfamiliar, or
because they were truly weaker
punk thrashes.
One sign of originality early on
was the introduction of one song
as "Nazi Punks, Fuck Off," hint
ing at a mild dissatisfaction at the
violent scenery in front of the
band. Like the rest of the first
songs, however, its tribal-stomp
music only egged the Nazi punks
further in their headbanging au
dience warfare.

Throughout the set, lead vocal
ist and onetime SF mayoral con
didate (he placed fourth out of 10)
Jello Biafra busied himself with
his usual/legendary frenzied the
atrics. Jello's headlong dives into
the crowd earned the most points
for style, mainly due to the fact
that he continued to "sing" as he
dove.
Actually, Jello is a finer vocal
ist than your typical punk
screamer — he has at least a pass
ing acquaintance with the words
"on key." Though one doesn't
necessarily know what Biafra is
saying, at least one can tell that
he is truly singing.
It wasn't until the second half of
the set, though, when the DKs
began to play material of their
"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegeta
bles" LP, that the music picked
up enough to satisfy the few in the
crowd who bothered to listen in
stead of fight. "Police Truck,"
featuring EB Ray's James Bond
style guitar licks, turned the band
into more than just a rhythm sec
tion for Jello. The hour-long set
reached its peak near the end with
its pairing of the Dead Kennedys
two biggest selling singles, "Holi
day in Cambodia" and "Califor
nia Über Alles."
More than any other Biafra
composition, "Holiday in Cam
bodia" is the quintessential Dead
Kennedys song, — challenging the
middle-class security of a fash
ionably liberal college student
(hm. .
Play ethnicky jazz to parade
your snazz/on your five grand
stereo! Hraggin' that you know
how the niggers feel cold/and the
slums got so much soul/what you
need is a holiday in Cambodia.
Fortunately, the music doesn't
bury the lyrics here, as the band
wisely avoid traditional punk

cliches in favor of a tighter, even
melodic sound.
At the end of "Holiday," EB
Ray and bassist Klaus Fluoride
fell into an old-time blues riff as
Jello ad-libbed a sarcastic im
personation of President Ronald
Reagan. As the interlude
progressed, it became clear that
the group had updated its onetime
ode to Governor Jerry Brown,
"California Über Alles." Rather
than dwell on a "suede/denim se
cret police" of Zen fascists forc
ing all to "jog for the master
Race" — as in the Brown version
— the new lyrics are directed
more toward the current reality
of people who are more concerned
with the Giants than El Salvador.
The song, and its revis on, proves
further the lack of sar red cows in
punk rock.
Finally, for the encore came
the DKs new single "To Drunk to
Fuck," currently topping the
charts in England despite a BBC

ban (wonder why. . .). Though ob
viously not calculated to go over
big on American Bandstand, its
rhythm-and-blues base is far eas
ier to handle than the usual tom
my-gun guitar, and as such it
belongs with the band's best
songs.
To see that the Fab Mab was
still in one piece when the Dead
Kennedys left the stage was
something of a surprise. Ap
parently, the animals in the au
dience had enough respect for
harmless rebellion so as not to de
stroy the place completely. Aside
from the bruises, the mob had
been given a representative eve
ning of punk rock, featuring one
awful band, one mediocre one,
and one fine group in the Dead
Kennedys. One could say that the
punk spirit of 1976 came back to
life Thursday night, but the more
likely truism is that it's always
been there for whomever wanted
to dive in — head first, of course.

Punk Rock — Spitting, vomit
ing, thrashing, everything
you've-heard-about-it-is-true
punk rock. Many rock and roll
PhDs wrote it off as dead not so

to attend the Dead Kennedys'
show at the Mabuhay Gardens
last Thursday night was clearly
aware that punk is still alive and
kicking.
