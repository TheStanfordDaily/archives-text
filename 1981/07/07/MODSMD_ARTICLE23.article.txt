Social Security fund may go broke
Washington — Social Security's retirement fund will go
broke by the end of next year and the Medicare program
could topple within the decade unless taxes are raised or
benefits slashed, according to the three cabinet officers
who serve as trustees of the system.
In their annual report, the trustees said particular ur
gency surrounds the old age and retirement trust fund,
which "would become unable to pay timely benefits by late
1982" without major help from Congress.
The report underscored President Ronald Reagan's call
for major reductions in Social Security benefits, including
a hefty penalty for early retirement, as a means to keep the
pension and health insurance system solvent. It was com
piled by Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweicker, Labor Secretary Ray Donovan and Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan.
The three cabinet members rejected any notion that the
retirement fund's short-range problems can be handled by
borrowing from the other two trust accounts, Medicare
and disability.
Even if the three funds were combined, monthly retire
ment checks couldn't be paid by 1985 if the economy should
falter again, they said. Under a worst-case scenario, they
added, the end could arrive in 1983.
Strike called over sexist payscales
San Jose — Municipal workers striking over equal pay
for women attempted to cripple services yesterday in the
city that calls itself the "feminist capital" of the United
States.
At issue in the strike is equal pay for work traditionally
done by women that is comparable to, if not necessarily the
same as, work traditionally done by men.
A $500,000 study commissioned by the city found ine
quities in women's salaries compared to those for men
doing comparable work.
Mayor Janet Hayes, who heads a 7-5 majority of women
on the City Council, said it was too early to determine the
effect of the strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
She said about 1000 employees failed to show up for work
yesterday.
But William Callahan, spokesman for the 2000 members
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees Local 101, said the strike appeared to be "very
effective" on its first business day.
"At this point people are not on the job," said Callahan,
"and as far as we can determine there are no services at
City Hall."
The city offered $1.3 million to bring pay for women up to
parity with men. The union, however, has demanded $3.2
million over four years.
The union also is asking a general salary increase of
more than 10 percent. City officials offered 6 percent.

Male strikers appeared to support their female coun
terparts.
More than 200 hurt in Liverpool riots
Liverpool — Shopkeepers, some armed with axes and
hammers, kept vigil in the smoldering ruins of this city's
Toxteth district yesterday after hundreds of marauding
youths staged what was described as the worst rioting ever
in England.
The rioting left at least 186 police and "dozens" of civil
ians injured and 70 people jailed.
"Most of us did not think that these kinds of things could
happen in our country," Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said after a weekend of violence turned the
streets into a battleground.
Peter Wright, deputy Merseyside police chief, said there
was evidence of "some orchestration" of the rioting and
one police official, who asked not to be identified, said "a
number" of those arrested were from outside the area.
Shopkeepers cleaning up yesterday spoke of "or
ganized" gangs of youths — some as young as 10 years old
— brandishing machetes and meat cleavers.
"These madmen want to see the blood of policemen
splattered across the streets of Liverpool," said one resi
dent who asked not to be identified. "It is not race hate. It is
just vicious hatred of the police."
Plan proposed to end Irish fast
London — A settlement to end the four-month-old hunger
strike by Irish nationalist prisoners in British-ruled
Northern Ireland has been drafted by a mediating Irish
Catholic church group following significant concessions by
British officials and the protesting prisoners in secret,
around-the-clock negotiations.
The Irish Commission for Justice and Peace of the Ro
man Catholic church in Ireland has proposed making the
draft public "within 24 hours in the form of a commission
statement to be responded to by both sides," said one
source close to the commission.
A positive public response by the British government
and the prisoners could then end the hunger strike in time
to prevent the death of Joe McDonnell, 30, a convicted Irish
nationalist terrorist who has refused food for 59 days.
But British and Irish government sources with knowl
edge of the negotiations warned that agreement could still
be blocked by one or two differences between the two sides
or by divisions among the protesting prisoners and Irish na
tionalist leaders outside the prison.
Brouhaha over Wimbledon dinner
New York — John McEnroe said yesterday that his in
vitation to the Wimbledon champions dinner was
withdrawn by the All-England Club.
But the chairman of the All-England Club, in effect, de

nied the allegation.
Stanford alumnus McEnroe, who defeated Bjorn Borg
4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 to win the 104 th All-Enghnd title, snap the
Swede's 41-match victory string and end his five-year dom
ination, met reporters briefly at the National Tennis Cen
ter after practicing for this week's United States-Czecho
slovakia Davis Cup match.
The younger McEnroe, who also won the doubles crown,
said he asked to make a brief appearance at the Saturday
night affair because he was tired and wanted to spend time
with his family.
The Wimbledon club, however, wanted McEnroe to
spend the entire evening at the private dinner, and when he
refused, they withdrew their invitation, McEnroe said.
Chris Evert Lloyd, the women's singles champion, told
the dinner audience about her American com
patriot: "I have to make two speeches, one for myself and
one for you know who. 1 do not have his vocabulary and, as
an American, I wish to apologize for him."
If the All-England Club's disciplinary recommendations
are approved, McEnroe may have to pay $14,750 in fines
and could be suspended for as long as a year.
Du Pont to buy Conoco oil firm
New York — E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., the nation's
biggest chemical concern, agreed yesterday to acquire
Conoco Inc., the ninth-biggest oil firm, for $7.3 billion in
cash and stock. The merger would be the largest in corpo
rate history.
The agreement is designed to thwart an unfriendly at
tempt by Seagram Co., the Montreal-based distiller, to ac
quire a 41 percent controlling interest in Conoco. A Sea
gram spokesman said the company had no comment on the
proposed friendly merger between the giant U.S. oil and
chemical companies.
The boards of directors of Du Pont and Conoco already
have approved the merger but it still requires a vote by Du
Pont stockholders.
