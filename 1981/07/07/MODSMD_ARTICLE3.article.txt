# Zimbardo links paranoia, deafness
## Prof uses hypnotism to show effects of hearing loss 
### Marianne Villanueva 
The Stanford professor fa
mous for his standing-room
only Psychology 1 lectures has
found a way to induce paranoia
in a group of seemingly healthy
students here.
Philip Zimbardo, professor of
social psychology, has long
studied the conditions that pro
duce serious emotional dis
turbances. He has done ex
tensive studies on children's
anxiety, shyness, vandalism
and the negative effects of pris
on environments.
He uses innovative research
methods. In his study of van
dalism, he planted "aban
doned" cars on New York
streets and filmed respectable,
middle-class New Yorkers in
the act of stripping and destroy
ing the marked cars. In his
study of prison environments,
he created a prison in a base
ment at Stanford and showed
normal, healthy, college stu
dents exhibiting marked person
ality changes. In his latest ex
periment, he induced paranoia
in a group of Stanford students
by creating temporary hearing
loss.

In an interview on July 2, Zim
bardo said that the relationship
between hearing loss and para
noia caught his interest because
of recent research findings in
England. Research there
showed that "about half of the
elderly people who were hospi
talized for paranoia" — a condi
tion which Zimbardo described
as "a persistent but unfounded
belief that the world is a hostile
place . . . and that other people
are plotting to do you harm" —
were "shown to have hearing
loss, whereas people hospi
talized for other kinds of mental
problems didn't have hearing
loss." Zimbardo said that his
study was the to first test the
findings in a systematic, ex
perimental way.
To create temporary hearing
loss in his subjects, Zimbardo
used hypnosis, a method he has
used in many previous experi
ments. In order to conceal the
true purpose of the test, he told
his subjects that he was examin
ing the role of hypnosis in
creative problem-solving He
then divided them into three
groups.
The first group was selected

as the one that would suffer
temporary hearing loss but not
be told about it. The second
group was told that they might
have some temporary hearing
problems. The third group, a
control group, was hypnotized
but was not programmed to suf
fer from hearing loss.
Soon, the students suffering
from hearing loss started be
coming "more irritated,
agitated, hostile, and unfriend
ly." When tested with standard
personality measuring tech
niques, they exhibited definite
signs of paranoia.
As a result of his experiment,
Zimbardo is convinced that
many partially deaf people who
are institutionalized because
they are though to suffer from
"mental disorders" might im
prove if their hearing dif
ficulties were fully understood.
This is particularly true for the
elderly. Zimbardo said that psy
chiatrists and clinical psy
chologists should take the possi
bility of hearing loss into ac
count when diagnosing elderly
persons as paranoid
Zimbardo said that people
must be "more sensitive" to the

ways in which they explain dis
appointments or failures be
cause, very often, the roots of
"madness" can be found in such
explanations.
Everyone experiences some
frustration in his life, said Zim
bardo. Some people rationalize
their frustrations by blaiming
their failures on the physical en
vironment, on their health, or on
other people. Those people who
consistently blame their frus
trations on biological reasons
are "psychosomatic." Those
people who consistently blame
their frustrations on other peo
ple are the ones most likely to be
paranoid.
Zimbardo said that he de
signed his experiment so that
his subjects would tend towards
"social explanations" — name
ly, see causes of frustration in
other people and not in them
selves.
"Next year, I plan to do addi
tional research, but more
broadly on the general question:
what are the conditions that
lead a normal person to begin to
develop pathological reac
tions," he said.
