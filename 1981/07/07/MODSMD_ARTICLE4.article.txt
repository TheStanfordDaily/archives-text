Washington — Congress is set to pare housing
aid in a budget-cutting package that will reduce
the number of new federally subsidized homes and
apartments and cost the poor more to live in them.
Critics of the proposals predict the rent in
creases will force some families to double or triple
up — or be left homeless in the most extreme
cases.
Moreover, both the Senate and the House have
moved to make it tougher for families to qualify
for any housing aid. Families whose income is
more than 50 percent of the median income in the
local area would be ineligible. The cutoff now is 80
percent.
Kate Crawford, associate director of the Wash
ington-based Low Income Housing Coalition, esti
mates that rent increases proposed in the budget
plan would affect 10 million people who live in 3.3
million housing units.
The House and the Senate, in adopting separate
spending-cut measures last week, agreed substan
tially on the thrust of new legislation designed to
slow the costly growth of federal housing subsidies
that began in the mid-1970s Both houses are aim
ing to cut about $12 billion in spending authority for
housing programs in the next fiscal year.
There are some differences in figures in the two

packages and a disagreement over rent controls
that must be ironed out by Senate-House nego
tiators when Congress returns from their Fourth
of July holiday.
Supporters of the reductions in spending for
housing assistance say their plan fills the Reagan
administration's inflation-fighting prescription
and will be fairer and more efficient than current
policy.
The Senate Budget Committee, in its report on
the package, said the "principal purposes are to
reduce the rapid growth of costs in subsidized
housing and to better target the programs so that
limited housing funds are available for those most
in need. "
The Senate bill would provide $17.8 billion to
subsidize 150,000 new or rehabilitated housing
units in fiscal 1982, which begins Oct. 1. The House
bill is a little larger, adding an estimated 158,000
units at a cost of $18.3 billion.
By comparison, Congress authorized 517,000
subsidized units in 1976 and 230,000 last year.
Both houses approved a provision to raise the
amount of net income a family will be required to
put toward rent for publicly assisted housing. It
would rise from 25 percent now to 30 percent over
the next five years.
But critics of the program say the bite out of the
income of poorer families could be more substan
tial.
