# Term characterized by judicial restraint
## Summary of major Supreme Court rulings of 1980-81 
### Associated Press 
Washington — The Supreme
Court's just-completed 1980-81
term likely will be remembered
most for a decision upholding the
nation's male-only military draft.
But other such familiar themes
as abortion, parental rights, court
access, free speech and religious
freedom all played a part in the
nine-month term.
As in recent years, no dominant
social philosophy was in evidence.
Rather, judicial restraint pre
vailed. Today's court remains
most comfortable "fine-tuning"
existing legal doctrines and defer
ring to the federal government's
two other branches and the states
when possible.
Here are summaries of most of
the major rulings announced by
the nation's highest court in its
1980-81 term:
Religious freedoms
—The Ten Commandments
cannot be posted in public schools.
—A worker who quits a job be
cause of religious beliefs is en
titled to collect unemployment
compensation.
—States may restrict religious
groups such as the Hare Krishna
sect from soliciting donations and
distributing literature from cer
tain public areas.
Free speech
—States are free to allow tele
vision, radio, and photographic

coverage of criminal trials over a
defendant's objection.
—Candidates for federal office
have a "right of access'* to buy
advertising time on television and
radio during a political campaign.
And it's up to the federal govern
ment, not the broadcasters, to de
termine when that campaign has
begun.
—Cities may ban billboards
carrying "commercial" advertis
ing but apparently may not ban
those billboards bearing political
or"non-commercial "messages.
—"Nude" dancing is a form of
constitutionally protected ex
pression. It cannot be banned by
broadly worded zoning laws.
—A federal law banning the
placement of unstamped material
in private home mailboxes does
not unduly interfere with free
speech rights.
Abortion
—States may require doctors to
notify the parents of "immature"
or dependent teen-aged girls when
those girls seek abortions.
—States also may outlaw abor
tions not performed in a hospital
after the first three months of
pregnancy.
Parents and children
—Parents do not have an auto
matic constitutional right to a
free lawyer when the state tries to
take away their children.
—Men defending against pater

nity suits have a right to a free
blood test.
Government regulation
—Federal regulators do not
have to show that industry costs
are justified by the resulting
health benefits when imposing
standards for worker exposure to
toxic materials, such as cotton
dust.
—When setting water-pollution
limits the Environmental Protec
tion Agency does not have to con
sider the economic capability of
individual businesses within an in
dustry to meet those limits.
—The Equal Employment Op
portunity Commission can de
mand an employer's records and
then give those records to employ
ees who are alleging on-the-job
bias.
Court access
—Persons victimized by illegal
water pollution cannot sue the
polluters for money damages.
—Federal courts are author
ized to hear labor disputes once le
gally required arbitration has
fallen through.
Environment
—Stringent federal regulations
on strip mining of coal are con
stitutional.
—Illinois and Michigan cannot
sue Milwaukee and other Wiscon
sin entities in federal court for
polluting Lake Michigan.
Official immunity
—A judge's immunity from
being sued for his or her de
cisions, even corrupt ones, does
not shield co-conspirators.
—No "punitive" damages can
be collected against local govern
ments whose officials violate a
person's civil rights.
—Former President Richard
Nixon and two of his closest assis
tants must pay for illegally spying
on a national security aide and his
family. But the case, resolved by

a 4-4 vote, did not definitively de
cide whether presidents and their
top aides are absolutely immune
from such lawsuits.
Civil rights
—An individual can sue the gov
ernment for civil rights violations
caused merely by an official's
negligence.
States rights
—In upholding Montana's 30
percent severance tax on coal
mined within its borders, the
court gave states a legal right to
cash in to the fullest on their natu
ral resources.
Politics
—The financial agreement that
led to the release earlier this year
of 52 American hostages from
Iran and by July 19 will free more
than $2 billion in Iranian assets
from this country was legally val
id. The court said then-President
Jimmy Carter was authorized to
make the deal.
—Wisconsin's "open primary,"
in which Democrats and Re
publicans can cross party lines to
vote, cannot bind either political
party's convention delegates to
its results.
Criminal justice
—Police need a search war
rant, not just an arrest warrant,
before entering a home to arrest a
non-resident.
—Police with a valid search
warrant for a home can detain ev
eryone on the premises until that
search is completed.
—Once a criminal suspect has
invoked his right to have a law
yer's help before answering any
questions from police, no further
questions can be asked unless the
suspect initiates the renewed con
versation with police.
—Police officers most often
need a search warrant before they
can search containers in the car's
trunk. But officers who stop a car

and make an arrest do not need a
warrant when those same con
tainers are in the car's passenger
compartment.
— Police may make in
vestigatory stops based on "cir
cumstantial evidence." They do
not have to meet the more str
ingent standard of having "proba
ble cause" to suspect criminal ac
tivity.
Death penalty
—A criminal defendant facing a
possible death penalty must be
warned of his right to remain si
lent prior to psychiatric testing if
the test results are used after con
viction to help choose between life
and death.
The sexes
—The Military Selective Ser
vice Act, which provides for
male-only draft registration and
conscription, does not foster un
constitutional sex discrimination
against men. The women's rights
movement claimed that the ruling
perpetuates an antiquated view of
women in society.
—Statutory rape laws aimed at
punishing only males who have
sex with underaged females are
constitutional.
—Military retirement pay is
not subject to state divorce laws
that require ex-spouses to share
all assets.
—Women in jobs held primarily
by women can sue on charges that
their salaries are being dis
criminatorily held down. For the
first time, the court said women
can file and win wage-bias law
suits without proving that they
perform the same jobs as men
who get paid more.
—So-called "head and master"
laws that allow husbands, but not
wives, to have exclusive control
over jointly owned property are
invalid.

Civil rights
—An individual can sue the gov
ernment for civil rights violations
caused merely by an official's
negligence.
States rights
—In upholding Montana's 30
percent severance tax on coal
mined within its borders, the
court gave states a legal right to
cash in to the fullest on their natu
ral resources.
Politics
—The financial agreement that
led to the release earlier this year
of 52 American hostages from
Iran and by July 19 will free more
than $2 billion in Iranian assets
from this country was legally val
id. The court said then-President
Jimmy Carter was authorized to
make the deal.
—Wisconsin's "open primary,"
in which Democrats and Re
publicans can cross party lines to
vote, cannot bind either political
party's convention delegates to
its results.
Criminal justice
—Police need a search war
rant, not just an arrest warrant,
before entering a home to arrest a
non-resident.
—Police with a valid search
warrant for a home can detain ev
eryone on the premises until that
search is completed.
—Once a criminal suspect has
invoked his right to have a law
yer's help before answering any
questions from police, no further
questions can be asked unless the
suspect initiates the renewed con
versation with police.
—Police officers most often
need a search warrant before they
can search containers in the car's
trunk. But officers who stop a car

and make an arrest do not need a
warrant when those same con
tainers are in the car's passenger
compartment.
— Police may make in
vestigatory stops based on "cir
cumstantial evidence." They do
not have to meet the more str
ingent standard of having "proba
ble cause" to suspect criminal ac
tivity.
Death penalty
—A criminal defendant facing a
possible death penalty must be
warned of his right to remain si
lent prior to psychiatric testing if
the test results are used after con
viction to help choose between life
and death.
The sexes
—The Military Selective Ser
vice Act, which provides for
male-only draft registration and
conscription, does not foster un
constitutional sex discrimination
against men. The women's rights
movement claimed that the ruling
perpetuates an antiquated view of
women in society.
—Statutory rape laws aimed at
punishing only males who have
sex with underaged females are
constitutional.
—Military retirement pay is
not subject to state divorce laws
that require ex-spouses to share
all assets.
—Women in jobs held primarily
by women can sue on charges that
their salaries are being dis
criminatorily held down. For the
first time, the court said women
can file and win wage-bias law
suits without proving that they
perform the same jobs as men
who get paid more.
—So-called "head and master"
laws that allow husbands, but not
wives, to have exclusive control
over jointly owned property are
invalid.
Washington — The Supreme
Court's just-completed 1980-81
term likely will be remembered
most for a decision upholding the
nation's male-only military draft.
But other such familiar themes
as abortion, parental rights, court
access, free speech and religious
freedom all played a part in the
nine-month term.
As in recent years, no dominant
social philosophy was in evidence.
Rather, judicial restraint pre
vailed. Today's court remains
most comfortable "fine-tuning"
existing legal doctrines and defer
ring to the federal government's
two other branches and the states
when possible.
Here are summaries of most of
the major rulings announced by
the nation's highest court in its
1980-81 term:
Religious freedoms
—The Ten Commandments
cannot be posted in public schools.
—A worker who quits a job be
cause of religious beliefs is en
titled to collect unemployment
compensation.
—States may restrict religious
groups such as the Hare Krishna
sect from soliciting donations and
distributing literature from cer
tain public areas.
Free speech
—States are free to allow tele
vision, radio, and photographic

coverage of criminal trials over a
defendant's objection.
—Candidates for federal office
have a "right of access'* to buy
advertising time on television and
radio during a political campaign.
And it's up to the federal govern
ment, not the broadcasters, to de
termine when that campaign has
begun.
—Cities may ban billboards
carrying "commercial" advertis
ing but apparently may not ban
those billboards bearing political
or"non-commercial "messages.
—"Nude" dancing is a form of
constitutionally protected ex
pression. It cannot be banned by
broadly worded zoning laws.
—A federal law banning the
placement of unstamped material
in private home mailboxes does
not unduly interfere with free
speech rights.
Abortion
—States may require doctors to
notify the parents of "immature"
or dependent teen-aged girls when
those girls seek abortions.
—States also may outlaw abor
tions not performed in a hospital
after the first three months of
pregnancy.
Parents and children
—Parents do not have an auto
matic constitutional right to a
free lawyer when the state tries to
take away their children.
—Men defending against pater

nity suits have a right to a free
blood test.
Government regulation
—Federal regulators do not
have to show that industry costs
are justified by the resulting
health benefits when imposing
standards for worker exposure to
toxic materials, such as cotton
dust.
—When setting water-pollution
limits the Environmental Protec
tion Agency does not have to con
sider the economic capability of
individual businesses within an in
dustry to meet those limits.
—The Equal Employment Op
portunity Commission can de
mand an employer's records and
then give those records to employ
ees who are alleging on-the-job
bias.
Court access
—Persons victimized by illegal
water pollution cannot sue the
polluters for money damages.
—Federal courts are author
ized to hear labor disputes once le
gally required arbitration has
fallen through.
Environment
—Stringent federal regulations
on strip mining of coal are con
stitutional.
—Illinois and Michigan cannot
sue Milwaukee and other Wiscon
sin entities in federal court for
polluting Lake Michigan.
Official immunity
—A judge's immunity from
being sued for his or her de
cisions, even corrupt ones, does
not shield co-conspirators.
—No "punitive" damages can
be collected against local govern
ments whose officials violate a
person's civil rights.
—Former President Richard
Nixon and two of his closest assis
tants must pay for illegally spying
on a national security aide and his
family. But the case, resolved by

a 4-4 vote, did not definitively de
cide whether presidents and their
top aides are absolutely immune
from such lawsuits.

ernment for civil rights violations
caused merely by an official's
