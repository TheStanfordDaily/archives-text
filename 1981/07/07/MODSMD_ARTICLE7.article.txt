## Polish economic collapse foreseen 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's
planning minister, predicting an
unprecedented 15 percent drop in
national income this year, last
week warned of economic col
lapse unless reforms are in
troduced immediately.
The forecast was made to a spe
cially convened.'session of par
liament as prime ministers from
all 10 Soviet bloc countries met in
Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, to
study the economic impact of the
Polish crisis. Poland's economic
plight has vast'y complicated at
tempts by the Communist trading
organization Comecon to coordi
nate the five-year plans of its
member countries.
The session of heads of govern
ment is an annual tradition in
Comecon but has assumed extra
significance this year in view of
developments in Poland. Accord
ing to official figures, Poland
failed to deliver almost $40 mil
lion worth of coal, coke, sulphur
and other supplies contracted for
by its Comecon partners in 1980.
The trend has worsened this year.
The seriousness of the crisis
was underlined in Warsaw by the
new Polish planning minister,
Zbigniew Madej, in his first ad
dress to parliament, which was
called to consider government
proposals for economic reform.
He disclosed that production was
18 percent lower in May than the
same month last year, and 10 per
cent lower in January.
The expected 15 percent drop in
national income means that Po
land's national income will de
cline for the third year in suc
cession. It fell by 2.3 percent in
1979 and by 4 percent in 1980.
After enjoying high growth
rates in the 1960s and early '70s,
all Comecon countiries are now
entering a period of slow growth,
lower than at any time since

World War 11. This has coincided
with the end of cheap energy, as
the Soviet Union gradually raises
the price it charges for oil and nat
ural gas to world levels.
While no other Communist
country is yet in such dire straits
as Poland, all suffer from similar
economic problems. These in
clude outdated technology, a bias
toward unprofitable heavy in
dustries like steel, inefficient ag
riculture, a high rate of foreign in
debtedness, and a clumsy price
structure.
Meanwhile, partly because of
what has happened in Poland, it
has proved virtually impossible
for Comecon countries to coordi
nate their five-year plans — the
key economic mechanism in
Eastern Europe — with any
degree of efficiency. The failure
of Polish factories to meet de
livery targets has become a re
curring complaint throughout the
region.
In his address to parliament,
Madej indicated that — even by
the most optimistic estimates —
it will take Poland at least five
years to get back to the 1978 level
of national income.
He added: "Unless we start on
economic reform immediately,
from today, nothing can save us
from catastrophe, from a total
breakdown of our economy."
The presentation of a workable
economic reform program has
also been set as a prior condition
by private Western banks for
rescheduling Poland's hard cur
rency debt. Poland owes a total of
around $26 billion to Western
creditors, of which $3.1 billion is
due this year.
Parliament is considering pro
posals to streamline the top
heavy economic bureaucracy by
reducing the number of ministries
and giving individual factories
greater responsibility.

Meanwhile the length and
number of lines in Warsaw and
other cities grows constantly.
Cigarette and alcohol coupons are
being issued in some regions to
supplement the existing rations
for meat, butter, suger, rice and
grains.
Economists agree that a key
element in the economic reform
is an overhaul of the chaotic price
system — but this issue is also ex
tremely sensitive politically. An
increase in meat prices an
nounced exactly a year ago
sparked widespread labor unrest
and led to the formation of the in
dependent trade union Solidarity.

economic reform immediately,
from today, nothing can save us
from catastrophe, from a total
breakdown of our economy."
The presentation of a workable
economic reform program has
also been set as a prior condition
by private Western banks for
rescheduling Poland's hard cur
rency debt. Poland owes a total of
around $26 billion to Western
creditors, of which $3.1 billion is
due this year.
Parliament is considering pro
posals to streamline the top
heavy economic bureaucracy by
reducing the number of ministries
and giving individual factories
greater responsibility.

Meanwhile the length and
number of lines in Warsaw and
other cities grows constantly.
Cigarette and alcohol coupons are
being issued in some regions to
supplement the existing rations
for meat, butter, suger, rice and
grains.
Economists agree that a key
element in the economic reform
is an overhaul of the chaotic price
system — but this issue is also ex
tremely sensitive politically. An
increase in meat prices an
nounced exactly a year ago
sparked widespread labor unrest
and led to the formation of the in
dependent trade union Solidarity.

Long lines and strict rationing in Poland are becoming more and
