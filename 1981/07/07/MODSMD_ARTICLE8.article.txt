# Japan's government stays small
## 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — Developers of the
mini-car and the mini-television
set, the Japanese also seem to
have perfected the mini-govern
ment.
In 1967 they set a limit - 506,571
— on the nuiiiber of white-collar
workers the central government
could employ.
Fourteen years later, despite a
larger population and a rapidly
expanding economy, the limit still
stands at 506,571, and Japan is
spending a lower percentage of its
gross national product on govern
ment than any Western nation. In
fact, Japan's bureaucracy has be
come slightly smaller over the
years and the current trend is to
keep it that way.
Japan's feat is unusual in an
age in which Western de
mocracies have been ruled by
Parkinson's Law that bureaucra
cies must inevitably grow.
Moreover, the Japanese ex
perience does not stem from any
public outrage over lazy and inef

ficient bureaucrats. Indeed, the
civil servant here is a person of
enormous prestige, enjoying the
trust and confidence of the public.
Civil service is an elite profession
that routinely draws the best and
the brightest from the highest
ranking universities.
It was Japan's bureaucracy
that directed and molded the ex
traordinary economic advance of
the 19605. Senior civil servants
draft most of the legislation
passed by the parliament and ex
ert political influence in almost
every sphere.
"The Japanese bureaucrat is
both competent and powerful,"
says Masaru Nishio, professor of
public administration at Tokyo
University. "It is very different
from the United States, where the
top elites from college go into
business."
That confidence, para
doxically, may be one reason that
the number of public servants in
Japan is so low. The job of paring
the payrolls each year to stay
within the legal limit is left to a

public body, the administrative
management agency. Each year,
that agency tells the government
ministries how many employees
they can budget for in the coming
year.
Public payrolls are also
slimmed by a process within the
powerful Ministry of Finance,
which has overall budget control.
The ministry promulgates what
in the United States would be
known as "sunset laws" that re
quire periodic review of all gov
ernment subsidies and aid pro
grams. After a period, usually
five years, each program is ex
amined to see whether it is doing
what it is supposed to do. Usually,
the ministry's rulings stick.
Furthermore, politically, the
government has been controlled
for 20 years by the conservative,
business-oriented Liberal Demo
cratic Party, which has a vested
interest in low taxes and low pub
lic expenditures. Businessmen
work comfortably with bureau
crats here, but they also act to
guarantee that their profits are
not undercut by high taxes.
Japan's tax rate is considerably
lower than those in the United
States and Western Europe.
As a result, the levels of many
public services in Japan are low
by comparison. School and col
lege classes are large — an
elementary classroom with 40
children is common. Surprisingly
in a country whose private sector
glitters with success, public sani
tation and sewage facilities are
not up to Western standards.
