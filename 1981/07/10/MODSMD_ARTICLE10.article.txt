### Washington Post 
As the final returns trickled in tffis week reveal
ing a narrow victory for Israel's Likud party, Is

Gaza Strip.

News Analysis

Analysis of the election returns and the ideol
ogical makeup of Israel's 10th Knesset (par
liament), which will be sworn in in two weeks, in
dicates that Israel's policies on the question of the
occupied territories and their 1.3 million Arab in
habitants are likely to become more unyielding as
a result of the balloting.
For one thing, Begin's rightist Likud Bloc in
creased its number of seats in the Knesset from 43
to 48. Within the Likud — the nucleus that appears
able to form a coalition majority of 61 members of
parliament — the relatively moderate Liberal
Party faction has become more conservative with
a resurgence of power by its -younger, more
hawkish wing, resulting in what appears to be a
less compromising Likud core.
All indications are that Begin's coalition will be
limited to the Likud, the National Religious Par
ty, the ultraorthodox Agudat Yisrael Party and
the religious-oriented Tami party, a splinter of
the National Religious Party. None of these ele
ments has a history of flexibility on the question of
the occupied territories.
On the other side of the Knesset aisle, the Labor
Party also reflects a more hawkish character
than it did after the 1977 election in spite of — or,
perhaps, because of — its 50 percent increase in
members. Labor jumped from 32 to 48 Seats in this
election.
Although the Labor Party since 1967 has ad
vocated in its campaign platforms that it would
return roughly two-thirds of the West Bank to Jor

dan in exchange for a peace treaty and the right of
Israel to maintain strategic settlements along the
Jordan River, the list of candidates this year re
flects a distinct turn to the right on the issue of se
curity.
"If anything, the election showed a clear move
ment. to (ho rifiHt on foreign polipy and security. If
Labor wants to do better in the next election, it
must move to the right," Yohanan Ramati, chair
man of the foreign relations committee of the
Likud's rightist La'am faction, said in an in
terview.
"The consensus of Israel is that we will be in
capable of defending ourselves if we agree to any
territorial compromise. The sooner the United
States realizes that, the closer you will be to un
derstanding the true sentiment of this country,"
Ramati said.
Public opinion polls consistently appear to sup
port that view.
In a survey last month, Hanoch Smith, Israel's
leading public opinion analyst, found that 34 per
cent of the sample favored the hard-line settle
ment position of the ultra-nationalist ,Gush
Emunim (Bloc of the Faithful) organization.
Smith's polls also show that virtually the entire
electorate is against territorial compromise in
Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and that only
about 10 percent favor withdrawal from any part
of the West Bank, even in return for peace with
Jordan.
Coming at a time when renewal of the auton
omy negotiations is expected to revive an interest
by the United States in the Palestinian issue —
which the Reagan administration has put on a
back burner until now — a hard-line stance by the
new government and Knesset, coupled with a
tighter daily administration of the West Bank and
Gaza, would appear to promise sharp differences
in the months ahead between Israel and the Unit
ed States over the future Of the occupied territo
ries.
