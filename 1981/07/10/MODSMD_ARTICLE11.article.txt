# Lebanon: no end to crisis
## 
### Washington Post 
Cairo — A special Arab
League committee suspended
its efforts to find a solution to
Lebanon's political turmoil Sun
day after failing to obtain any
commitment from the Christian
Phalangist Party to sever its
links with Israel.
Syrian Foreign Minister
Abdel Halim Khaddam told re
porters after the talks were
halted in the Lebanese resort
town of Beiteddine that the com
mittee had adjourned until July
25 because the issue of Christian
ties to Israel had not been set
tled.
The committee, made up of
the foreign ministers of Syria,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Arab
League Secretary General
Chadli Kleibi of Tunisia, was re
portedly insisting that the
Phalangists renounce their
links to Israel as a condition for
an overall settlement to the po
litical strife and sectarian vio
lence plaguing Lebanon for six
years.
The Phalangist leaders have
refused to make such a pledge
before the Christian community
is given explicit guarantees for
its safety and political rights as
part of a comprehensive settle
ment.
Despite three meetings of the
Arab League committee since
the latest trouble began in April
with fighting between Christian
militia and Syrian forces, there
is still no indication the various
Lebanese factions have come

closer to an accord.
But the committee has
brought about a cease-fire in
Beirut and the lifting of the 3-
month-long Syrian siege of
Zahle, the predominantly Greek
Catholic city in central Lebanon.
In effect, however, Lebanon
is back where it was before the
Syrian siege began April 1, with
an uneasy cease-fire prevailing
throughout most of the country.
The only major change has
been the introduction in April of
Syrian ground-to-air missiles
into Lebanon for the first time
following the shooting down
near Zahle of two Syrian heli
copters by Israeli warplanes.
Israeli Prime Minister Men
achem Begin has repeatedly
said Israel will destroy the mis
siles itself if Syria does not re
move them.
His threats caused fears of an
Israeli-Syrian military confron
tation that prompted the Rea
gan administration to send spe
cial envoy Philip Habib to the
roginn in May and aaain in June
to ease the crisis.
While Habib failed to arrange
any compromise over the mis
siles, his presence in the Middle
East for five weeks helped keep
the situation from deteriorating
further.
The future of the Syrian mis
siles — still in the Bekaa valley
but reportedly in new sites — re
mains unclear. Much is likely to
depend on what the new Israeli
government does once it is
formed and installed.
