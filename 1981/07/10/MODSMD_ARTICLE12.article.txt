# Executives become students for a week
## 
### Heather Baird 
They're executives in one of
the top three positions in a For
tune 1000 company or its foreign
equivalent. They've been there
at least 10 years. Their job in
volves pressure and prestige.
They manage people and capi
tal. Fringe benefits include ex
pense accounts, vacations,
notoriety and power. How does
a company reward such a loyal
(or aggressive) employee?
Stanford's Business School
and Stanford Alumni Associa
tion have a ready answer: The
Stanford Summer Executive
Programs.
For anywhere from $2600 for
13 days to $9200 for eight weeks
(the company pays) a diligent
and deserving executive can
combine an exposure to today's
management trends and the
business world outside his office
with the luxuries of being a rath
er pampered student.
"It's great! There are no ex
ams. no grades," said Jay Can

trell of Portland, Oregon. Com
pared to undergraduate fare,
the executives get laundry ser
vice, and steak and lobster for
dinner (sometimes). Announce
ments of tennis, golf, swimming
and wine country tours vie for
space in Lagunita's lobby with a
bulletin board announcing this
week's "Anonymous MBA
Hint:" hot tubbing. The daily
New York Times and Wall
Street Journal are free, as is
plenty of booze for the first two
weeks. (After that they're on
their own for Thursday night
parties and cocktail get-togeth
ers.)
"You have to remember that
four bare dorm walls can get
awfully boring," said Cantrell.
With all this excess, what do
participants learn? Why do
companies like General Motors,
United Airlines, Wells Fargo
Bank and Anheuser Busch pay
so much money to take their top
memoers out of the daily grind
for a spell?

"It broadens a narrow back
ground; I'm exposed to areas
my normal daily routine doesn't
allow," says Gary Foss of Hay
ward, California, in his third
week of the eight week pro
gram; "not to mention that not
having to work takes a lot of the
pressure off," he added.
"It brings you up to the cut
ting edge," said Cantrell.
Starr Wheeler of Los Angeles
said she appreciated the chance
to interact with corporate ex
ecutives as peers, beyond the
protective realms of com
petitive organizations. "You get
truth," she said, "and the lec
tures give the basis for discuss
ing various opinions of the
world."
All of the participants in
terviewed agreed that the
chance to spend time in dis
cussion groups and talking over
meals with people in their same
position is one of the highlights
of the program.
One-third of the 190 members

of the eight-week class are for
eign. "It's definitely geared to
U.S. economics," said Tor
Jemtland of Norway, though
"subjects like inflation — ev
eryone talks about that."
Only four women are in the
eight-week program.
"The problem has much more
to do with today's corporate
world and the existing political
male-female power struggle
than the Executive Program,"
says Wheeler, one of the female
participants. "Ten years from
now a third of the class will be
women. The question is: are the
corporations really putting the
money behind women now?"
Courses cover topics such as
what the future will be like for
business, how to use computers
to make decisions, and how to
continue succeeding when to
day's people in power have to
depend more and more on other
people. They examine the in
ternational political economy,
how people behave within or

ganizations, and economic
trends relating to inflation,
energy, and the Federal Re
serve Policy.
The shorter seminars focus
more narrowly: on small busi
ness management, or financial,
organizational or marketing
management. The eight-week
program is a mini-version of the
MBA program. Its graduates
are eligible to join the Business
School Alumni Association.
One food service employee
described the executive partici
pants as "typical Stanford stu
dents. They are intelligent,
articulate, and highly
motivated," he said. "They
seem to spend most of their
time talking about business ex
cept after dinner when they've
had a few."
Without a tie or Business sun
in sight, the executives sit be
hind large name placards in
their classes. Their books are
marked in yellow, they scribble
notes from off the blackboard.
They frequently interrupt pro
fessors and volunteer answers.
They make jokes about tactics
they use to bluff for time in the
real world, and laugh a lot.
Though Harvard and Wharton
offer similar programs, Stan
ford's Executive Programs
have more qualified applicants
than thev can accomodate.

What's the lure?
"In simple terms, I learned
about leasing, which companies
are good to invest in, how to pre
dict future markets — and wow!
A bunch of us went down and
tried to ride that mechanical
bull in town! I'm still sore,"
said Cantrell at the end of his
two week session.
"You pick out the plums. If
you can come away with just
one new idea it's all been worth
while." said Dee Dorsey of La
Jolla, California.

What's the lure?
"In simple terms, I learned
about leasing, which companies
are good to invest in, how to pre
dict future markets — and wow!
A bunch of us went down and
tried to ride that mechanical
bull in town! I'm still sore,"
said Cantrell at the end of his
two week session.
"You pick out the plums. If
you can come away with just
one new idea it's all been worth
while." said Dee Dorsey of La
Jolla, California.
They're executives in one of
the top three positions in a For
tune 1000 company or its foreign
equivalent. They've been there
at least 10 years. Their job in
volves pressure and prestige.
They manage people and capi
tal. Fringe benefits include ex
pense accounts, vacations,
notoriety and power. How does
a company reward such a loyal
(or aggressive) employee?
Stanford's Business School
and Stanford Alumni Associa
tion have a ready answer: The
Stanford Summer Executive
Programs.
For anywhere from $2600 for
13 days to $9200 for eight weeks
(the company pays) a diligent
and deserving executive can
combine an exposure to today's
management trends and the
business world outside his office
with the luxuries of being a rath
er pampered student.
"It's great! There are no ex
ams. no grades," said Jay Can

trell of Portland, Oregon. Com
pared to undergraduate fare,
the executives get laundry ser
vice, and steak and lobster for
dinner (sometimes). Announce
ments of tennis, golf, swimming
and wine country tours vie for
space in Lagunita's lobby with a
bulletin board announcing this
week's "Anonymous MBA
Hint:" hot tubbing. The daily
New York Times and Wall
Street Journal are free, as is
plenty of booze for the first two
weeks. (After that they're on
their own for Thursday night
parties and cocktail get-togeth
ers.)
"You have to remember that
four bare dorm walls can get
awfully boring," said Cantrell.
With all this excess, what do
participants learn? Why do
companies like General Motors,
United Airlines, Wells Fargo
Bank and Anheuser Busch pay
so much money to take their top
memoers out of the daily grind
for a spell?

"It broadens a narrow back
ground; I'm exposed to areas
my normal daily routine doesn't
allow," says Gary Foss of Hay
ward, California, in his third
week of the eight week pro
gram; "not to mention that not
having to work takes a lot of the
pressure off," he added.
"It brings you up to the cut
ting edge," said Cantrell.
Starr Wheeler of Los Angeles
said she appreciated the chance
to interact with corporate ex
ecutives as peers, beyond the
protective realms of com
petitive organizations. "You get
truth," she said, "and the lec
tures give the basis for discuss
ing various opinions of the
world."
All of the participants in
terviewed agreed that the
chance to spend time in dis
cussion groups and talking over
meals with people in their same
position is one of the highlights
of the program.
One-third of the 190 members

of the eight-week class are for
eign. "It's definitely geared to
U.S. economics," said Tor
Jemtland of Norway, though
"subjects like inflation — ev
eryone talks about that."
Only four women are in the
eight-week program.
"The problem has much more
to do with today's corporate
world and the existing political
male-female power struggle
than the Executive Program,"
says Wheeler, one of the female
participants. "Ten years from
now a third of the class will be
women. The question is: are the
corporations really putting the
money behind women now?"
Courses cover topics such as
what the future will be like for
business, how to use computers
to make decisions, and how to
continue succeeding when to
day's people in power have to
depend more and more on other
people. They examine the in
ternational political economy,
how people behave within or

ganizations, and economic
trends relating to inflation,
energy, and the Federal Re
serve Policy.
The shorter seminars focus
more narrowly: on small busi
ness management, or financial,
organizational or marketing
management. The eight-week
program is a mini-version of the
MBA program. Its graduates
are eligible to join the Business
School Alumni Association.
One food service employee
described the executive partici
pants as "typical Stanford stu
dents. They are intelligent,
articulate, and highly
motivated," he said. "They
seem to spend most of their
time talking about business ex
cept after dinner when they've
had a few."
Without a tie or Business sun
in sight, the executives sit be
hind large name placards in
their classes. Their books are
marked in yellow, they scribble
notes from off the blackboard.
They frequently interrupt pro
fessors and volunteer answers.
They make jokes about tactics
they use to bluff for time in the
real world, and laugh a lot.
Though Harvard and Wharton
offer similar programs, Stan
ford's Executive Programs
have more qualified applicants
