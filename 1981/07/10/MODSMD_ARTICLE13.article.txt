# Summer brings more foreign students
## 
### Brad Armstrong 
Summer residents of Univer
sity housing are probably being
greeted in the shower each
morning by hellos in Japanese,
Chinese, Spanish, German, Ital
ian and French dialects, for
about 40 percent more foreign
students enroll here during the
summer than during the regular
academic year.
As during the other three
quarters of the year, regular
academic classes draw substan
tial numbers of foreign students
to Stanford during the summer.
The University's open summer
admissions policy partially ac
counts for the rather large in
flux of foreign students in the
summer; this policy enables
more students, from high school
to graduate to professional
levels, to come to Stanford on a
short-term basis to take courses
of particular interest or need to
them.
Another substantial element
of the increased foreign student
population at Stanford during

the summer is participation in
the English for Foreign Stu
dents program. According to its
coordinator, Beverley Mc-
Chesney, the program, which is
divided into five separate ses
sions, involves about 200 people
over the course of the summer,
all of whom have had at least

some prior training in English.
One session, which begins in
June and lasts eight weeks, is an
intensive English course con
sisting only of graduate stu
dents in the fields of engineer
ing, education and related so
cial sciences. In another course,
foreign graduate students under
Fullbright Scholarships from

the Institute for International
Education participate in a si.ni
lar intensive program in Eng
lish.
In addition, a third compo
nent of the program involves
supplementary English classes,
also offered during the regular
academic year, which more ad-

vanced students may take in
conjunction with other classes
outside the program. This par
ticular segment of the program
is not intended to constitute an
intensive English program.
Two more segments of the

program begin on July 17. Mc-
Chesney said a five-week in
tensive session, open to anyone
but comprised mostly of gradu
ate students and professionals,
begins on this date. Few of the
participants in this portion of
the program remain in the Unit
ed States for any extended peri
od of time after the program
ends: almost all, said Mc-
Chesney, return to their native
countries.
Also on July 17, Volunteers in
Asia (VIA), an exchange group
of 42 to 45 young Japanese, be
gins a four-week run of English
classes. Unlike the intensive
English segments of the pro
gram which consist of language
classes from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
participants in the VIA program
take linguistics classes in the
morning and participate in so
cial and cultural activities in the
afternoon; in addition, rather
than taking a fifth week of lan

guage training, VIA students
travel for a week in the United
States after their stay here.
Besides regular summer
quarter classes, the English for
Foreign Students program and
VIA, other activities at Stanford
during the summer attract a
host of foreign visitors. Another
exchange program, known as
Youth for Understanding,
brings a number of young
Japanese to Stanford in August
for a wide variety of linguistic,
cultural and social activities.
Though not contributing to
the foreign student population
at Stanford, many of the Stern
Hall conferences have foreign
participants from academic,
business and professional fields.
These conferences include the
United States-Japan Con
ference on Asymmetric Reac
tions and the Plasticity of
Metals at Finite Strain.
