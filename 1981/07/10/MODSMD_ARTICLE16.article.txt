Draft names
I write to express my strong
opposition to $B 246, the .pro
military bill written by State
Senator John Schmitz (R-Coro
na del Mar), which would re
quire California secondary
schools and community colleges
to supply Information (names
and addresses) to the Selective
Service.
If this measure it also passed
in the State Assembly, our
schools will become an em
ployment agency for the U.S.
military.
The Berkeley school board,
yielding to heavy pressure from
the community, voted unani
mously to allow draft counsel
ors access to the high school stu
dents of that enlightened city. It
is of the greatest importance
that our young men be per
mitted to hear arguments for
and against conscription and
that all of our youth learn as
much as possible about the pres
ent state of the art of war.
How many of our 18-year-olds
realize that daily casualties in
the event of war are expected to
run close to 50,000? Do these
children know that they will be
trained to handle "small" tac
tical nuclear weapons, the size
of the 1945 Hiroshima bomb?
To paraphrase Lady Mac-
Beth, when shall we, as a coun
try, ever wash the blopd of those
dreadful days from our hands? I
would tend to believe that
absolution for our sins will not
readily be obtained by starting
World War 111.

Sicky
I have just read Joel Achen
bach's article (Daily, July 7).
I think, if the story.is true,
that he is one of the sickies. How
anyone can do what he did is just
a little beyond my com
prehension. Let me assure him
that I am not an animal lover. In
fact, I don't like them around
me. But his story left me feeling
very sad. At one time people felt
compassion for accidents such
as that one, and whatever
message he received I cannot
imagine.
Hereafter, if >Achenbach's
choice is such a sadistic one, I
shall avoid his articles as

siduously.

Not humorous
This article not only says
absolutely nothing, it is not in
the least humorous and it is in
sulting and offensive to those
who read the Daily believing
they are going to read some
thing worthwhile.
In the two years I have been
here, I have never read such a
low level article in the Daily. I
find it unfortunate that the Dai
ly must resort to such-desperate
means to fill space. There are
many creative, humorous and
informative ways to fill space in
a paper without having to resort
to such senseless, negative and
empty words.
It is most disheartening to
read that this column will con
tinue to appear, because it cer
tainly ' downgrades the stan
dards of the Stanford Daily.
K Also, I hope that this mentali
ty is not an example of Stanford
summer students but only a
poor exception.

Editor's note:
We received twice as much
mail in response to Achen
bach's harmless, if puerile,
piece as we did for any two other
columns combined.
Perhaps that ratio is also an
accurate indicator of summer
Stanford's mentality.
(iun control, the arms race
and (iuatemala are all issues
that affect human beings, real
people (as well as pups). Vile
thoughts and disgusting behav
ior, however, do not seem to
draw the same brand of right
eous approbrium from the
readers of this page when they
are cloaked in the robes of na
tional policy and geopolitical
theory.
