## Guatemala needs social reform 
### 
According to Guatemalan President Romeo
Lucas Garcia, "Violence is an allergy one must
learn to live with."
President Ronald Reagan, in his recent move to
discuss resumption of military aid to Guatemala,
seems ready to endorse General Lucas' casual at
titude toward the chronic terrorism and violent re
pression in that country.
In 1977, the Guatemalan government shrugged
off assistance from the United States that was con
tingent' on President Jimmy Carter's policy of re
spect for human rights.
The Reagan administration is now reportedly
willing to resume military aid to Guatemala to
combat a "major insurgency/' Even if we are de
termined to live with the "allergy of violence," in
Guatemala, military assistance is not likely to be
effective unless the Garcia government under
takes fundamental social and economic reforms.
The government elite and their business sup
porters insist that Guatemala is free of the condi
tions that led to the uprisings in neighboring coun
tries
Although Guatemala is one of the most wealthy
and most industrialized of the six Central Ameri
can nations, the benefits of Guatemalan society
are as poorly distributed as anywhere in the hemi
sphere.
As late as 1975, the average annual income for a
rural Guatemalan was estimated at only $89. Sev
enty-five percent of the population still live below
the poverty line.
Land distribution compounds this situation; 26
percent of the rural population owns no land and 90
percent lives on-plots too small to provide a min
imal standard of living.
Social conditions reflect economic realities.

Over half the adult population is illiterate.
Malnutrition is widespread, and housing condi
tions are appalling.
At thejieart of Guatemala,'s social problems is
the continued exploitation of the Mayan Indians
The Indians, who make up more than half the popu
lation, have long remained passive in the face of
political upheaval. Thus, no government has faced
the issue of social reform.
The Guatemalan elite has long feared the poli
ticization of the Indians. Economic repression and
political terrorism have now sparked the Indians'
interest in change.
In the past three years, 5000 Guatemalans have
been murdered. According to a report by Amnesty
International, most of the victims are poor city
people and Indians.
Leftist guerrillas have now begun to recruit the
Indians who are caught in the middle of a no-win
political and economic situation. The "major in
surgency" Reagan seeks to control with American
weapons is this new and threatening coalition of
leftist forces and Maya Indians.
The United States has no place supporting a re
gime that regards violence as a way of life and the
preferred response to social unrest.
But ethical considerations aside, unless real im
provements are made in Indian conditions, the
potential appeal to over half the country's popu
lation of guerrilla movements will increase steadi
ly. The very- regime Reagan wants to support has
no chance of success until it confronts the massive
dilemma of social and economic iqequity in
Guatemala.
