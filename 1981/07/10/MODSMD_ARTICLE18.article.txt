## Gail Edmondson Schares Social Security must be solvent 
### 
President Ronald Reagan v has
taken a political beating for his
recent proposals to cut Social
Security benefits. His action has
been branded a betrayal of hard
working, middle-class Ameri
cans.
But contrary to popular as
sumption, the Social Security
system was not founded on the
idea that what a worker paid in
over a lifetime would finance
his own retirement.
The current $60 billion deficit
which threatens to bankrupt the
system has resulted from Con
gress's improving benefits far
beyond the system's ability to
pay for them.
If Americans now desire a to
tal insurance system, which is
not what Social Security was de
signed to be, they will have to
pay for it through increased
payroll taxes. If Social Security
is to remain in principle a sup
plemental service, it must be

restored to solvency through
benefit cuts.
Without some kind of im
mediate action, the Old Age and
Survivors Insurance (OASI)
program will stop issuing
checks next year. Social Secur
ity's trust funds, Disability In
surance and Hospital Insur
ance, will run short of money
when the baby boom generation
reaches retirement age, around
the year 2020.
The threat of OASI's im
mediate bankruptcy combined
with Reagan's desire for a bal
anced budget by 1984 have
prompted the current adminis
tration to adopt a hastily pre
pared and unsatisfactory sched
ule of benefit cuts.
Early retirement cuts which
were designed as an incentive toJ
continued working would act in
stead as a severe penalty for the
majority of retirees: 55 percent
of those retiring early are too ill
to work longer ; 14 percent have
lost their jobs and cannot find
work.
Concern over the OASI
bankruptcy and an unbalanced

budget also obscure the fun
damental issue of complete vs.
supplemental pension plans.
Once Americans choose either
option, the methods of restoring
the Social Security system to
health will become much
clearer.
No matter which option
Americans choose, the first or
der of business in Washington ia
to resolve the immediate crisis
so long term solutions can be
carefully weighed and balanced
against each other.
Interfund borrowing would
provide a reprieve from the im
pending financial crisis and
avoid placing the burden of im
mediate cuts on the elderly of
this generation.
It is imperative that the extra
time provided by a transfer of
funds be used to reevaluate the
kind of retirement plan Ameri
cans desire and are willing to
support through payroll taxes.
