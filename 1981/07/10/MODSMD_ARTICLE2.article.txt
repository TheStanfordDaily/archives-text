# Reagan names Stanford alumna to Supreme Court
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
The nomination of Stanford
Law School graduate Sandra
Day O'Connor to the U.S. Su
preme Court marks quite a coup
for that school's class of '52. Not
only can it boast of graduating
the first female nominee in the
court's 191-year-history, but —
pending Senate approval —
O'Connor will join William
Rehnquist as the second Su
preme Court Justice to come
from what a Stanford professor
once called "the dumbest
class" he had ever taught.
The late George Osborne, an
expert in real estate law, re
portedly once slammed down a
book, told O'Connor's class it
was the dumbest he had ever
taught. . . and didn't come back
for two weeks.
However, after President
Ronald Reagan announced his
selection of the 51-year-old Ari
zona Appeals Court Judge and
former San Mateo County pros
ecutor on Tuesday, nothing but
praise came from University
faculty and administrators.
"It's a superb appointment.
Marvelous for the country, for
Stanford, and for the Law
School," said Law School Dean
Charles Meyers this week. "She
is a woman of great ability, tre
mendous balance and good polit
ical understanding."
O'Connor's appointment has
sparked some controversy na
tionwide, as women's groups,
supporters of the Equal Rights
Amendment and right-to-life
activists analyze the judge's
record on issues like ERA and
abortion.
While an Arizona state sena
tor, O'Connor supported a
measure legalizing abortion and
voted against a resolution urg
ing Congress to pass an anti
abortion consitutional amend
ment. These votes have sparked
concern among conservative
groups like the Moral Majority
which have charged Reagan
with disregarding the plank in
the Republican platform which

called for a "respect for tradi
tional family values and the
nnnoitity of human nr._ * •
Gerald Gunther, nationally
prominent constitutional law
scholar notes, however, "Per
haps the best thing that's hap
pened is that the right-to-life
people oppose O'Connor. She
seems by all reports to be a per
fectly qualified, conservative
philosophy judge."
Even as White House staffers
sift through mail and answer
phone calls which they admit
have constituted mainly
negative reactions to the Rea
gan nominee, here at Stanford
one allegation about her back
ground has prompted something
of a controversy as well.
Most reports about
O'Connor's nomination claim
she was third in her class, with
Rehnquist ranked first. It seems
that since her appointment was
announced Tuesday, both the
Law School and the University's
news service have received nu
merous calls by people asking
who was second in the class, as
well as a few calls questioning
whether or not O'Connor really
was third.
University News and Publica
tions' Director Bob Beyers said
yesterday, however, that de
spite these reports the Law
School does not use class stand
ings and has no comment on
either of these matters. A Law
School spokesperson confirmed
that they do not have any in
formation on class standing for
O'Connor and Rehnquist's
class.
As fate would have it,"the
only guy who probably knows is
on vacation," Beyers said. As
sociate Dean of the Law School
Keith Mann was the head of the
Order of the Coif in 1952, and
Beyers said he thinks Mann may
have information on the class
standings of that honorary soci
ety's members. O'Connor was
elected to the Order of the Coif;

she also served on the Law Re
view board of editors.
ing, University President
Donald Kennedy called her "an
outstanding Stanford student
and an outstanding trustee
(from 1976 to 1980, she served on
the Board). We're very proud of
her."
