## Strip your fruit trees or face pesticide shower 
### 
Governor Jerry Brown has, to
his great credit, postponed the
potentially dangerous
Malathion aerial spraying pro
gram which was promoted so
fervently by the agriculture in
dustry as well as the California
state senate. In its place, Brown
has invoked a massive fruit
stripping and spraying pro
gram, to begin immediately.
A brief background will be
helpful. The Mediterranean
fruit fly, with the potential to
damage about 30 percent of Cal
ifornia's agriculture industry,
has recently been seen in many
areas which were quarantined
for the purpose of its contain
ment. These areas include Stan
ford University and the rest of
Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Mountain
View and Santa Clara; at the
last count (yesterday after
noon), 107 fly maggots had been
found.
The state agricultural board,
understandably dismayed at the
prospect of a boycott of Califor
nia's fruit and vegetables by
Texas and Florida (both former
Medfly hosts) has insisted that
the only way to wipe out the in
sect is with aerial applications
of the poison Malathion in a
molasses-type bait. Their pro
posal is to spray the insecticide
— from low-flying helicopters in
the pre-dawn hours — over ap
proximately 200,000 people in
the quaratined area. The target
area could include as many as
half a million people.
Against recommendations
from a "technical committee,"
that is, a loaded deck of "ex
pert" entomologists with heavy
agricultural affiliations, Brown
has wisely opted to make the
most of a fruit stripping and
ground spraying program which
was clearly successful in the
areas in which it was conscien
tiously engaged.
But the problem with the cur
rent emergency stripping and
spraying program is that it is
being handled with a strange
combination of indifference and
panic. The unstated message
from the Medfly project seems
to be that aerial spraying will
take place anyway. As of yester
day afternoon, they had no in

telligible plan for fruit collec
tion, for helping understaffed
areas, for dispersing informa
tion.
The media has been re
markably unhelpful in the pro
gram as well. With the excep
tion of KTVU (Channel 2), all of
the television news covering the
Medfly project has been biased
toward aerial spraying.
"It might not even be harm
ful!," enthused Gary Rebstock
of KPIX (Channel 5), before
giving about six seconds of the
opposite view to Dr. Mark Ef
fron of Stanford Medical School.
Effron's view — that Malathion
might, in fact, be a birth defect
risk — was given such short
shrift by Channel 5 that one
could hardly remember what
his objection was. And KRON's
Evan White, smiling smugly
and shrugging at what he per
ceived as Brown's whimsy in in
stituting the emergency pro
gram, can claim neither objec
tivity of news presentation nor
adequate public service.
Other problems abound. A lot
of homeowners resist the fruit
stripping program. Those who
are not simply lazy see the re
newed ground attack on the fly
as an invasion of privacy or
property. These people are also
not frightened of aerial
spraying to support Brown's
project, thinking simply that
he's using a less effective tech
nique "when what we need is a
quick, total eradication of the
Medfly."
But the irony is that aerial
spraying would not be quick. It
might not be total. And it may
well be harmful, according to a
number of Stanford Medical
School physicians and re
searchers.
At the technical committee's
testimony in Los Gatos on Tues
day, Charley Poucher, who was
in charge of Florida's "eradica
tion" programs in the early
1960 s, drawled proudly about
his success there. "We used
aerial spraying and wiped out
the fly in '58," he said. "We used
it again in '62. It worked again in
'63. And we eradicated the fly
again with aerial spraying in
'66."

Poucher thus introduced a
key point that Jerry Scribner,
manager of the Medfly eradica
tion program here, tried to sup
press. Later that day it was
learned that aerial spraying of
Malathion in Texas took 18
months, at higher concentra
tions than would be used here,
before it became effective.
As Poucher accidentally
showed, no one quite knows how
to handle the insect. But if you
think that Malathion, sprayed
from helicopters, would quickly
eliminate the problem, you
couldn't be further from the
truth. It would take at least ten
applications at intervals of ten
days before the state would even
try to judge its success. And
Wednesday's San Francisco
Chronicle reported that it could
take up to two years.
If you also think that aerial
spraying of Malathion would

spare you from stripping fruit,
think again. Since the poison
does not affect the larve already
in the fruit, if that fruit were not
discarded, the overhead
spraying program could not suc
ceed.
The Medfly program has
always been a little out of con
trol. Even now, no clear criteria
have been established for the
point at which aerial spraying
could be halted: "When we find
no more flies," Scribner has
said. What we can say for the
ground program is that it would
comprise six sprayings after the
fruit has been stripped, and we
would at least know where the
insecticide would be.
Brown has set Monday, July
13, as the deadline for fruit re
moval. At the risk of sounding
apocalyptic, we haven't much
time.
If the fruit stripping program

doesn't work, if people don't co
operate, it will be virtually im
possible to stop overhead
spraying. And that means it will
be impossible to avoid those
sticky droplets of insect bait,
which, but for the fact that they
damage the paint on cars, aren't
supposed to be too harmful.
Pick fruit off of trees. Cancel
plans for the beach — instead,
climb ladders, help neighbors
with fruit removal, call the
Medfly project (358-3673) for
more information about what
you can do. This weekend is one
of those rare times when being
passive is far more harmful
than being active.
Please, extend yourself —
otherwise, look forward to a
long spell of early morning
Malathion showers.

comprise six sprayings after the
fruit has been stripped, and we
would at least know where the
insecticide would be.
Brown has set Monday, July
13, as the deadline for fruit re
moval. At the risk of sounding
apocalyptic, we haven't much
time.
If the fruit stripping program

doesn't work, if people don't co
operate, it will be virtually im
possible to stop overhead
spraying. And that means it will
be impossible to avoid those
sticky droplets of insect bait,
which, but for the fact that they
damage the paint on cars, aren't
supposed to be too harmful.
Pick fruit off of trees. Cancel
plans for the beach — instead,
climb ladders, help neighbors
with fruit removal, call the
Medfly project (358-3673) for
more information about what
you can do. This weekend is one
of those rare times when being
passive is far more harmful
than being active.
Please, extend yourself —
otherwise, look forward to a
long spell of early morning
Malathion showers.

Governor Jerry Brown has, to
his great credit, postponed the
potentially dangerous
Malathion aerial spraying pro
gram which was promoted so
fervently by the agriculture in
dustry as well as the California
state senate. In its place, Brown
has invoked a massive fruit
stripping and spraying pro
gram, to begin immediately.
A brief background will be
helpful. The Mediterranean
fruit fly, with the potential to
damage about 30 percent of Cal
ifornia's agriculture industry,
has recently been seen in many
areas which were quarantined
for the purpose of its contain
ment. These areas include Stan
ford University and the rest of
Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Mountain
View and Santa Clara; at the
last count (yesterday after
noon), 107 fly maggots had been
found.
The state agricultural board,
understandably dismayed at the
prospect of a boycott of Califor
nia's fruit and vegetables by
Texas and Florida (both former
Medfly hosts) has insisted that
the only way to wipe out the in
sect is with aerial applications
of the poison Malathion in a
molasses-type bait. Their pro
posal is to spray the insecticide
— from low-flying helicopters in
the pre-dawn hours — over ap
proximately 200,000 people in
the quaratined area. The target
area could include as many as
half a million people.
Against recommendations
from a "technical committee,"
that is, a loaded deck of "ex
pert" entomologists with heavy
agricultural affiliations, Brown
has wisely opted to make the
most of a fruit stripping and
ground spraying program which
was clearly successful in the
areas in which it was conscien
tiously engaged.
But the problem with the cur
rent emergency stripping and
spraying program is that it is
being handled with a strange
combination of indifference and
panic. The unstated message
from the Medfly project seems
to be that aerial spraying will
take place anyway. As of yester
day afternoon, they had no in

telligible plan for fruit collec
tion, for helping understaffed
areas, for dispersing informa
tion.
The media has been re
markably unhelpful in the pro
gram as well. With the excep
tion of KTVU (Channel 2), all of
the television news covering the
Medfly project has been biased
toward aerial spraying.
"It might not even be harm
ful!," enthused Gary Rebstock
of KPIX (Channel 5), before
giving about six seconds of the
opposite view to Dr. Mark Ef
fron of Stanford Medical School.
Effron's view — that Malathion
might, in fact, be a birth defect
risk — was given such short
shrift by Channel 5 that one
could hardly remember what
his objection was. And KRON's
Evan White, smiling smugly
and shrugging at what he per
ceived as Brown's whimsy in in
stituting the emergency pro
gram, can claim neither objec
tivity of news presentation nor
adequate public service.
Other problems abound. A lot
of homeowners resist the fruit
stripping program. Those who
are not simply lazy see the re
newed ground attack on the fly
as an invasion of privacy or
property. These people are also
not frightened of aerial
spraying to support Brown's
project, thinking simply that
he's using a less effective tech
nique "when what we need is a
quick, total eradication of the
Medfly."
But the irony is that aerial
spraying would not be quick. It
might not be total. And it may
well be harmful, according to a
number of Stanford Medical
School physicians and re
searchers.
At the technical committee's
testimony in Los Gatos on Tues
day, Charley Poucher, who was
in charge of Florida's "eradica
tion" programs in the early
1960 s, drawled proudly about
his success there. "We used
aerial spraying and wiped out
the fly in '58," he said. "We used
it again in '62. It worked again in
'63. And we eradicated the fly
again with aerial spraying in
'66."

Poucher thus introduced a
key point that Jerry Scribner,
manager of the Medfly eradica
tion program here, tried to sup
press. Later that day it was
learned that aerial spraying of
Malathion in Texas took 18
months, at higher concentra
tions than would be used here,
before it became effective.
As Poucher accidentally
showed, no one quite knows how
to handle the insect. But if you
think that Malathion, sprayed
from helicopters, would quickly
eliminate the problem, you
couldn't be further from the
truth. It would take at least ten
applications at intervals of ten
days before the state would even
try to judge its success. And
Wednesday's San Francisco
Chronicle reported that it could
take up to two years.
If you also think that aerial
spraying of Malathion would

spare you from stripping fruit,
think again. Since the poison
does not affect the larve already
in the fruit, if that fruit were not
discarded, the overhead
spraying program could not suc
ceed.
The Medfly program has
always been a little out of con
trol. Even now, no clear criteria
have been established for the
point at which aerial spraying
could be halted: "When we find
no more flies," Scribner has
said. What we can say for the
ground program is that it would
comprise six sprayings after the
fruit has been stripped, and we
would at least know where the
insecticide would be.
Brown has set Monday, July
13, as the deadline for fruit re
