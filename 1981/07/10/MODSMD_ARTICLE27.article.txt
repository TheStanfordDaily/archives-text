The Elephant Man
New Varsity, Palo Alto
I kept putting off seeing this
movie — I think I expected it to be
preachy and all about "human
dignity." (Human dignity tends to
make better editorials than mov
ies.) When I finally got around to
going, I was immensely gratified
to discover that The Elephant
Man isn't preachy at all — it's
pure magic.
The film is based on the life of
John Merrick, a victim of a de
forming disease in nineteenth-cen
tury England. Director David
Lynch has created a film that's
equal parts Dickens and Mary
Shelley. We empathize with this
"monster." and we're appalled at
the cruelty of the society in which
he finds himself. Lynch's style is
anything but realistic: his movie
has the look and feel of a great
fairy tale. As played by John Hurt,
Merrick is imbued with sweetness
and gentle grace.
Tonight only with Lynch's first
film, Eraserhead.

Clash of the Titans
Park Theater, Menlo Park
The acting is wooden and the
mythology suspect, but the special
effects, and the set pieces involv
ing them, are often magical. They
were created by Ray Har
ryhausen, the man who did the ef
fects for Jason and the Argonauts.
Harryhausen is the cinema's
greatest practitioner of stop-mo
tion animation, the same tech
nique that made the eighteen-inch
high King Kong threaten New
York. Harryhausen's puppet char
acters in Clash of the Titans in
clude a flying horse and, most
spectacularly, a Medusa that
would do any monster-maker
proud. This movie should be great
for kids: it's heroic and not too vi
olent.

The Kids Are Alright ★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma
chine—as the years tick by we see
the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live
Rock" by heart, is that it ultimate
ly becomes an examination of the
creation of a public image. Which
came first: our generation or The
Who?
Late show this weekend.

/f'n a Wonderful Life
Memorial Church Film Series
Wednesday Evening, 320 Geology
Corner
The Second World War had just
ended, and mixed in with the
bright hopes for the future was a
lingering doubt about whether
what America had gained in
"progress" could ever replace the
old ways that had been lost. Frank
Capra (Mr. Smith does to Wash
ington, It Happened One Night)
directed this masterful com
edy/fantasy drama. Like the era
that produced it, It's a Wonderful
Life is a fascinating, disturbing
mixture of confidence and regret.
The happy ending is delightful be
cause it comes as the end of a com
edy-veiled nightmare. This is
Capra's masterpiece and one of
James Stewart's finest films.
Stewart stars as a very good
man driven to the verge of suicide
when all his fine plans seem to be
ruined. A messenger from heaven
stops him in his attempt and then
shows him how different the lives
of his family and friends would
have been had he not been present.

Superman //★★*
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the original;
it will usually delight those who
found the original's smart-alecky
second half more appealing. Rich
ard Lester (A Hard Day's Night,
The Three Musketeers) directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
book punch that moves it along as
speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
peats his role as the man of steel;
Margot Kidder is, once again, a
sassy, sexy Lois Lane.

For Your Eyes Only**
Palo Alto Square
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal. It's
not as bloated as the last Bond ex
travaganza (Mdonraker) and it'B
perhaps the least sadistic of any
Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to be
growing tired of the role (or per
haps he's merely stopped trying:
the producers plan to replace him
with a younger model soon). He
perks up momentarily — as does
the movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his

112 Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
' iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the rest
of the film, For Your Eyes Only
might have passed for entertain
ment instead of an exercise in
cinematic stasis.

The Stunt Morn****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the old theme of reality ver
sus illusion, but in an astonishingly
witty new setting. The director,
Richard Rush, reverses every au
dience expectation in this
audacious, kinetic comedy about
making movies. Peter O'Toole
gives an imaginative, self-de
lighted performance as Eli Cross,
a filmmaker who revels in risks.
Steve Rails back plays the stunt
man. The cast also includes Allen
Goorwitz (who used to be called
Allen Garfield) in another good
performance and Barbara
Hershey (who used to be called
Barbara Hershey Seagull).
Starts next Thursday with
Thief.

Stir Crazy*
Fox, Redwood City
Or: Abbott and Costello Go to
Prison. This comedy, written by
Bruce Jay Friedman and directed
by Sidney Poitier, is intended to be
a take-off on Cool-Hand Luke,
a little of From Here to
Eternity tossed in. Richard Pryor
and Gene Wilder play buddies who
are mistakenly identified as bank
robbers and thrown into the clink,
where a mean warden spots Wil
der's skill at riding the mechanical
bull and plans to have him win the
annual rodeo. The movie is just a
mess of gags from other movies,
some of them so ancient they die of
exhaustion before our eyes; they
are also clumsy and mistimed.
The two stars have their moments,
but they're required to repeat the
same lunatic routines over and
over.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
double-billed with Silver Streak.

Raiders of the Lost Ark*
Palo Alto Square
Haiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the thirties and
forties (it's set in 1936) as well as
the TV serials and comics of the
fifties. It represents the combined
efforts of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jatv*) directed; George
Lucas (Star Wars) and Philip
Kaufman (Invasion of the Body
Snatehers) wrote the script. It has
been acclaimed by the overwhelm
ing majority of critics as a cliff
hanger classic. But I must confess
to a traitorous resistance to all
those good vibrations: I didn't
care for the movie very much.
Raiders achieves a weird balance:
it's exciting on the surface but dull
at its center. For all the hype about
its adolescent boys' tale spirit, I
could discern none of it. Raiders
was made in acquisitive spirit; it's
a tradesman's movie

Melvin and Howard
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The so-called "Mormon will"
story is the inspiration for
Jonathan Demme's Melvin and
Howard, an imaginative re
construction of the meeting be
tween Melvin Dummar (Paul Le
Mat) and Howard Hughes (Jason
Robards).
There aren't any stock charac
ters in this movie; everyone has
idiosyncracies, but Demme and
scriptwriter Bo Goldman don't
condescend to any of them. The
major characters have been won
derfully drawn — and Demme and
Goldman have been fortunate in
their cast. As Lynda. Dummar's
first wife, Mary Steenburgen has
the perfect outlet for her spacy
sexiness. Jason Robards towers
over the movie, even though he ap
pears only briefly at the beginning
and (in a flashback) at the end. No
actor has ever managed to look so
eccentric and so tragic at the same
time
Plays Saturday through Mon
day with Cnal Miner's Daughter.

History of the World, /'art One
★ ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
History is receiving more
criticism than any other Mel
Brooks film for its tastelessness.
It's tasteless, all right — the au
dience I saw it with greeted the
Spanish Inquisition sequence with
hostile murmurs of protest — but,
worse than that, it's simply not all
that funny. We've all heard
Brooks' fart jokes and Jew jokes
and queer jokes before, and he
doesn't seem to think he needs to
add anything to them to make
them fresh enough to laugh at.
Ironically, History may be
Brooks' best looking movie —
maybe he took a summer course in
film composition. Albert
Whitlock's matte work, which
gives Roman skylines to the studio
back lot, is quite beautiful.
Madeline Kahn, as Nympho,
Nero's empress, gives the movie's
funniest performance.
