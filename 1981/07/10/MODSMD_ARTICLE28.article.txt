# 'Canonball': a senseless run
## 
### Chris Mai 
Nothing new. The usual car
chase. The usual smirking Burt.
A skeletal plot without any de
tail whatsoever: a ruleless race
across America's highways.
And that is exactly the problem
with the Cannonball Run — no
plot. Yates' script could have
been written on the back of a
brown paper bag.
A string of juvenile pranks
links this long car ad together.
Before a word is spoken, a sleek,
black Lamborghini races down
a highway with a helpless po
liceman in pursuit. The car —
we don't know who drives it —
stops at a' "55" sign, and out step
a pair of shapely legs (Farrah
Fawcett's. we soon see). She
paints a red X on the 55 and then
she and the car speed off. The
audience — composed mostly of
10 to 14-year-olds — laughed
when I saw the movie. Person
ally, I was disgusted. After all,
thousands of people die every
year because of a similar dis
respect for the law.
Ah, but then there is Burt and
his sidekicks and a whole crew
of celebrities. Perhaps pro
ducer Ruddy and director
Needham thought they could

salvage this flick by hiring a
bevy of recognizable faces. Burt
Reynolds is C.J. — enough said
of his deplorable performance
— and Dom DeLuise is once
again his crony: a neurotic dum
my who in emotional fits turns
into "Captain Chaos" (nothing
is more silly than an overweight
man parading around in a cape
and mask). Roger Moore plays
Seymour Goldfarb, a spoiled
brat who thinks he's really Rog
er Moore (007 music is in the
background whenever we see
Seymour's roadster). Farrah
Fawcett is "Beauty," an air
head who loves trees because,
she says, you can lie under them
at night and "Fuck your brains
out." Old timers Dean Martin
and Sammy Davis Jr. are a pair
of drunken phony priests chas
ing after anything resembling a
girl. Jamie Farr, from
M'A'S'H, plays an Arabian
shiek who is not nearly as funny
as Corporal Klinger and who
drives, what else, a Rolls
Royce.
Adrienne Barbeau and Tara
Buckman are two bombshells
who wile their way out of traffic
tickets by pulling out their

drivers licenses from strategic
areas of their form fitting jump
suits. The cast also includes
Terry Bradshaw, Mel Tellis,
Molly Picon (a fine actress
