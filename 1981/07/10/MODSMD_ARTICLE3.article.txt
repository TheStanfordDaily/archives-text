# Air spraying nixed; U.S. may quarantine
## 
### Andres Fajardo 
Governor Edmund Brown,
Jr., has nixed the controversial
aerial spraying of the pesticide
malathion over heavily popu
lated areas of the Santa Clara
Valley in favor of ground
spraying, tighter quarantine
regulation and sterile fruit fly
release as the fight against the
Mediterranean fruit fly con
tinues.
"There's no justification in
my opinion to impose a quaran
tine on the state of California
and I will fight it as far through
the courts as necessary,"
Brown said Wednesday in San
Jose.
His decision came despite the
unanimous recommendation of

the Medfly Technical Review
Committee to employ aerial
spraying.
In response to Brown's an
nouncement, sources at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in
Washington said the federal

government has decided to
quarantine produce infested by
the Medfly in California. No de
tails of the order were avail
able, but one source told the As-
OUCiM iw«i JT *1 cow * iliv MM
tine would cover the shipment of
"host" crops that are infested
by the Medfly. Officially, how
ever, the department said no de
cision had been made.
University President Donald
Kennedy said Wednesday he

was "gratified" that Brown had
decided against aerial spraying
although he thought malathion
presented a minimal health haz
ard.
"Throughout this past week I
have been concerned about es
calation on campus of fear over
the risk to humans of aerial
spraying," said the former head
of the Federal Food and Drug
Administration.
Kennedy added that con
cerned academic departments
had persuaded him that "impor
tant experiments would be high
ly vulnerable to disruption by
aerial spraying."
Brown has called:
•All yard areas within the 660
square mile quarantine area are
required to have all fruit and
vegetables — including pyra
cantha — placed in sealed
plastic bags by Monday. Failure
to do this, Brown emphasized,
will result in a fine or arrest.
•Tighter quarantine restric
tions began yesterday with ran
dom roadside inspections. The
quarantine area spreads from
Ralston Road in Redwood City
and San Carlos in San Mateo
Alameda County in the north, to
Metcalf Road in San Jose in the
south.
•Ground spraying will begin
Monday.
•Sterile fruit fly release will
continue.
