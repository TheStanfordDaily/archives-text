# 'Moscow' better than Hollywood
## 
### Wayne Wolf 
Modern Soviet films don't get
much play in the United States.
The filmgoer is more likely to be
familiar with Potemkirx and
Ten Days that Shook the World
than with any Soviet film made
since World War 11.
It was surprising, therefore,
to see a new Soviet film, Mos
cow Does Not Believe in Tears,
win this year's Oscar for best
foreign language film. The com
petition was stiff, and it was
hard not to wonder what the
Academy knew that you didn't.
What they knew is that Mos
cow Does Not Believe in Tears
is an engaging film about bal
ancing the conflicting demands
of work, love and social pres
sures. This is a theme that is be
coming popular in America and
has been tackled by films such
as It's My Turn. But director
Vladimir Menshov has suc
ceeded in finding some answers

pretend to be a Moscow sophisti
cate to be happy. Luckily, she
finds, "life begins at 40."
This all has some of the flavor
of the"it isn't so bad to be poor"
stories common in the Depres
sion. But the film is far from
dogmatic, and this theme does
not become a burden. The film
is a masterpiece of balance. The
characters, the plot, the 1950s
setting and all the other ele
ments are blended together to
serve the story.
Well-sketched characters are
a highlight of the film. It is a
pleasure to make their acquain
tance, and many are not far re
moved from our experience.
Katrina's uncle and aunt are a
pair of middle-aged, rotund peo
ple complete with spoiled
Pekinese. They would be as ap
propriate leaving Park Avenue
for a summer in Miami as they
are going on a trip to the
Crimea. Ludmilla, Katrina's


Jane Lenoir, flutist, Denis Harper, oboist, and Keith
