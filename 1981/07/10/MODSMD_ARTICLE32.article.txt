# Au Chamberlin: a restaurant worthy of a celebration
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
If you have just finished a
project or if you want to cele
brate your birthday you proba
bly deserve an evening out at Au
Chambertin, possibly the Pen
insula's finest French restau
rant.
The setting is comfortable,
several small rooms are espe
cially designed to encourage in
timate conversation. We were
seated in the "library," an
almost private area with only
four tables, and were at ease as
soon as we sat down.
The ambience reflected a
carefully created sense of
elegance, a setting attractive to
the most distinguished clientele
— on an average evening at
least a couple of company presi
dents are among the guests —
and yet not overpowering to
anyone.
Unlike its counterparts in Eu
rope, Au Chambertin provides
a superb meal and setting,
without the unpleasant side-ef
fect of putting you on display. A
meal at Au Chambertin is a per
sonal experience and because of
the deliberate attempt to com
partmentalize, there is never a
feeling of being part of a crowd.
Only the piped-in music de
tracts from the mood.
On arriving at the restaurant
I was almost hoping to deflate
its image of excellence, but
found absolutely no grounds to
do so. I am unable to complain
that the food was bland and ov
errated, that service was stuffy
and snobbish, that the at
mosphere was contrived, be
cause every aspect of the res
taurant bordered on or achieved
perfection.
The Mausseline de Saint-
Jacques aux Points d'Asperges,
a mousse of scallops in lobster

sauce with asparagus ($6.25),
was light and aromatic, the
quintessence of a mousse. The
Feuillete d'Huitre au Curry,
baked oyster in a curry sauce in
pastry ($6.25), although slightly
singed, was delicious: the
pastry flaky and the filling
zesty.
Both soups excelled. The
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee,
baked onion soup with cheese
($3.25), was delicate yet explod
ing with flavor and covered with
a very generous layer of cheese.
The Bisque de Homard, lobster
bisque ($3.75) coated my palate
with a light cream, just suggest
ing the delicate aroma of the
lobster. Unlike most bisques,
my last spoonful was as pleas
urable as the first, and my
palate aroused not over
whelmed
Most meals reach a peak and
then slowly fade away. But after
two courses at Au Chambertin I
was still on an upward slope and
the summit was nowhere in
sight. Both of our entrees were
superb. The Noisette d'Agneau
au Porto, lamb in port wine
sauce( $14.95), was beautifully
presented, with broccoli and
puffed potatoes.
Although correctly propor
tioned for aesthetic display,
the portion of lamb was on the
small side considering the
price. But this just forced me to
savor each bite more assiduous
ly. The meat was cooked to per
fection, just pink, and the sauce,
although rich, fully set off the

flavor of the meat.
The prawns in lobster sauce,
Langoustines au Gratin ($14.75)
appeared in more abundance, a
half dozen very large ones. But
quantity was not the focal point,
and it is the quality that de
serves attention. The prawns
were juicy , with superb texture
and equally excellent flavor.
For those of you looking up
more synonyms for excellent in
your thesaurus, I'm sorrv I've
used them all. As a writer, Au
Chambertin provides me with a
real challenge, trying to find
enough positive adjectives. It is
a far easier job to attack with
mordant vitriol than to provide
a restaurant with ethereal
praise, and alas I'm faced with
the latter, and the meal is not
yet over. . .
A sixth sense, or something,

had told me of my potentially
voracious appetite during the
initial ordering It took little
arm-twisting for my companion
to consent to ordering Souffle
au Grand Marnier — prepared
only for two. and with auvanced
notice — for dessert Needless
to say that was no mistak 3
Two small souffles emerged
risen to fully twice the height of
their disnes, ana into wmch our
waitress poured a rich, creamy
Creme Anglaise (thick custard)
heavily laced with the orange li
queur. I only wish that my souf
fles could always be as light and
airy as these.
The meal was accompanied
by a Robert Mondavi Fume, and
a Beaujolais Village, selected
with the expert guidance of one
of the owners, from a very in
teresting wine list, which cov

ered a wide range 01 wine tastes
and budgets, from middle range
California wines to Grand Cru
Bordeaux.
Our waitress was very friend
ly, as were the owners, who
circulated freely, chatting with
the clientele, and making sure
that everything was more tnau
satisfactory.
As one owner said, "after a
long dav at work, oeoole don't
want to have to put on a snow,
they want to relax and enjoy
themselves", and this synthesis
of the finesse of French Haute
Cuisine, and some of Califor
nia's more relaxed attitudes
helps to create a wonderful eve
ning out.
