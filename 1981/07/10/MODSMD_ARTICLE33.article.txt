## East European art in exile 
### Jiri Weiss 
An exhibit of contemporary
East European artists in exile
will open on Sunday at
Memorial Union. It is a group" 1
show rather then an exhibit withjg
a unifying theme according to 1
Shelley Kamarov, a former cos
tume designer for the Leningrad
ballet who organized it together
with Student Arts at Stnaford
(STARTS). m
"I look for the level of art — it
doesn't matter what style it is," y
she said with a charming Rus
sian accent for which, for some
unknown reason, she ap
pologizes.
"What is interesting about
the exhibit is that all these peo
ple come from the same back
ground and yet their works _
range from the sentimental ana*
realistic to the very modem,!! i;
Kamarov said.
"They are of different ag£&3(
and work in different medi- j
ums," she continued, but like
other European artists they
share a classical background!
The painters tend to work more
with oils and watercolor then
American artist who concen
trate on acrylics.
The artists whose work will
be on display are some of the
most prominent in Eastern Eu
rope, according to Kamarov.
They include Michael

i Chem>»kin,
TUHpantfv, sculptor Patiiciu
MateesCu and Igor Med. |All
have left their countries ? be
cause of what they felt were re
strictions on their creative tal
ents.

Art and worked in advertising
and commercial art in the Sovi
to the U.S. in 1975, Moross has'"
taken up silkscreening. Some of
his works appear in the current
edition of American Artists of
Renown.
Tanya Kornfeld, who emi
grated from Soviet Union to Is
rael, has had her work exhibited
all over the U.S. as part of a
travelling exhibition "12 from
the Soviet Underground."
Sergei Tivetsky studied under
Vladimir Veissberg in Moscow
while worked as illustrator. In
1978 he organized the unofficial
group of artists known as
"Four." Today his paintings en
joy a worldwide reputation.
Tivetsky came to the U.S. one
year ago just a few years after
his brother Aleksei, who mar
-q,ed an American living in Mos-
to pay a duty
when they try to take works of
art out of the country, its like
buying the works from the gov
ernment," Sergei said with a
grin. "That's because in the So
viet Union everything belongs to
everybody — but they still
would not let me exhibit."
The art that East European
artists have to offer is highly in
tellectual — a type of art which
is gaining recognition in this
country, according to Kamarov
who' works for a Los Angeles

gallery.
"The intellectual level of art
is very important," Kamarov
said, something that some of the
more highly experimental con
temporary art does not give the
public. "People are tired of ex
periments, they want to know
what they can get out of it,"
Kamarov said.
"There are three different
kinds of people that walk into a
gallery. There are the interior
designers who give us a
dimension and ask what will fit.
The second group are the people
who want to invest. . . and the
third are people who think about
art and who say 'I want to live
with this piece of art.'"
Kamarov said that she was
encouraged that most of the
people she has to deal with are
from the third category.
The formal opening of the ex
hibition at 3pm on Sunday at
Tressider lounge includes a con
cert of Bach and Chopin with
two Russian musicians, Emilia
Makovoz on the piano and Abe
Spector guitar.

Sergei Tivetsky studied under

while worked as illustrator. In
1978 he organized the unofficial
group of artists known as
"Four." Today his paintings en
joy a worldwide reputation.
Tivetsky came to the U.S. one
year ago just a few years after
his brother Aleksei, who mar
-q,ed an American living in Mos-
to pay a duty
when they try to take works of
art out of the country, its like
buying the works from the gov
ernment," Sergei said with a
grin. "That's because in the So
viet Union everything belongs to
everybody — but they still
would not let me exhibit."
The art that East European
artists have to offer is highly in
tellectual — a type of art which
is gaining recognition in this
country, according to Kamarov
who' works for a Los Angeles

gallery.
"The intellectual level of art
is very important," Kamarov
said, something that some of the
more highly experimental con
temporary art does not give the
public. "People are tired of ex
periments, they want to know
what they can get out of it,"
Kamarov said.
"There are three different
kinds of people that walk into a
gallery. There are the interior
designers who give us a
dimension and ask what will fit.
The second group are the people
who want to invest. . . and the
third are people who think about
art and who say 'I want to live
with this piece of art.'"
Kamarov said that she was
encouraged that most of the
people she has to deal with are
from the third category.
The formal opening of the ex
hibition at 3pm on Sunday at
Tressider lounge includes a con
cert of Bach and Chopin with
two Russian musicians, Emilia
Makovoz on the piano and Abe
Spector guitar.

An exhibit of contemporary
East European artists in exile
will open on Sunday at
Memorial Union. It is a group" 1
show rather then an exhibit withjg
a unifying theme according to 1
Shelley Kamarov, a former cos
tume designer for the Leningrad
ballet who organized it together
with Student Arts at Stnaford
(STARTS). m
"I look for the level of art — it
doesn't matter what style it is," y
she said with a charming Rus
sian accent for which, for some
unknown reason, she ap
pologizes.
"What is interesting about
the exhibit is that all these peo
ple come from the same back
ground and yet their works _
range from the sentimental ana*
realistic to the very modem,!! i;
Kamarov said.
"They are of different ag£&3(
and work in different medi- j
ums," she continued, but like
other European artists they
share a classical background!
The painters tend to work more
with oils and watercolor then
American artist who concen
trate on acrylics.
The artists whose work will
be on display are some of the
most prominent in Eastern Eu
rope, according to Kamarov.
They include Michael

i Chem>»kin,
TUHpantfv, sculptor Patiiciu
MateesCu and Igor Med. |All
have left their countries ? be
cause of what they felt were re
strictions on their creative tal
ents.
Chemiakin who is already
well kndwn in Europe and Japan
is a master printmaker whose

, -stylized,, stippled figures hint at
