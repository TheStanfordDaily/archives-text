# Summer theatre

Can anybody be an artist and
a student at the same time?
Probably not. Sure, some might
be able to forget about class and
spend eight hours a day in the
painting or music studio, on a
stage, at the typewriter â€” wher
ever. But when finals week
rears an ugly head that looks
strangely like that of whoever's
paying your tuition, it's time to
study or die. And you study.
But the Drama Department's
Summer Theater Workshop of
fers an alternative. In this pro
gram, 35 summer students and
15 faculty and staff members
get together for one purpose: to
put on plays. Eight plays in
eight weeks to be exact.
The workshop is valuable,
says Managing Director
Michael Ramsaur, because it
gives the student direct theatri
cal experience with few or no
outside distractions. "Most peo
ple average 10hours (of work) a
day here," he says. "It's meant
to be like real theater, with no
student hassles. You don't have
to go home at night and study for
your econ final."
Along with the actual produc
tion of plays, there are classes
offered in acting, movement,
make-up, and voice. Students
may take any or none of the
classes, but all those partici
pating in the workshop can re
ceive at least eight units of cred
it.
And there's plenty of work to
be done outside class, with re
hearsals and set work through
out every afternoon and eve
ning. Plays are cast and crew
assignments given at the begin
ning of the workshop, and it's
nothing but effort after that.
Ramsaur, who chose the sum
mer's productions, says he tried
to pick shows with "few prob
lems," so that two weeks for a
small stage show (at the Nitery)
and three weeks each for the
two major shows (at the Little

Theater) would not be un
reasonably short production pe
riods.
This summer's main offer
ings are Criminal Minds, by
Robin Swicord, and Beth Hen
ley's The Miss Firecracker Con
test. Criminal Minds, which
opens July 15th, is the story a
couple, Eddie and Billie Marie,
who break a criminal named
Renfroe out of prison and try to
get him to pull a job for them.
Eddie, who has just gotten out of
the prison himself, knows that
whatever Renfroe's criminial
skill is, he has done something
big, so big "you couldn't get the
guards to talk about it."
But Renfroe can't remember
what he did, and it's up to Billy
Marie to help him remember.
Of course the two fall in love,
but there's a nice twist to the en
ding.
The workshop's production of
The Miss Firecracker Contest is
what Ramsaur believes to be
the West Coast premiere of this
play by Pullitzer Prize-winning
author Henley. Miss Fire
cracker is described as a "south
ern gothic comedy" about a
young woman with the prov
erbial checkered past who
wants to win the Miss Fire
cracker contest and leave the
town of Brookhaven in "a
crimson blaze of glory." She
makes it to the finals, but. . .
Ramsaur says that the main
priority of the workshop is not
only to give the students broad
experience, but also to put on
high quality shows. While there
are no auditions for admission
to the program, there is an ap
plication process, and students
are chosen for their roles based
on their abilities and experience
when they enter the workshop.
Thus some students may act
more than others, some may re
ceive greater production re
sponsibilities, and so forth.
But, he stresses, "We are
very aware that we're a school,
not a professional theater.


Renfoe (Troy Schmit) shows Billy Marie (Drue Bralove) how to
play miniature golf while her boyfriend Eddie (Marc Chelemer)
looks on in disapproval in Robin Swicord's play Criminal Minds.
