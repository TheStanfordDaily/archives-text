# Sheppard not seductive enough
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Michelle Swanson, the direc
tor of Magic Theatre's produc
tion of Sam Shepard's play
Seduced, reported that she had
feelings of "inadequacy" when
she heard that she was chosen
for the task. It is, after all, her
debut at the theatre. The fact
that the Pulitzer-Prize-winning
playwright-in-residence was
looking over her shoulder did
not help.
Judging from the quality of
the production, she had no rea
son to question her competence.
If anyone should have had
qualms it was the playwright.
The production is well staged
and well acted, up to the high
standard of other Magic
Theatre productions, but there
is so much unexplored potential
in the play's main character
Henry Hackamore that
"Seduced" leaves you with an
empty feeling — your expecta
tions unfulfilled.
The topic is ambitious — the
character of Henry Hackamore
is based rather closely on the
enigmatic multi-billionaire
Howard Hughes, who retired
into seclusion from his role as
playboy, movie mogul, aircraft
designer and pilot, not necessar
ily in that order.
Hughes lived out his last
years in a paranoid delusion
completely cut off from the out
side world, a shrivelling
skeleton with tuffs of unkempt
white hair and beard looking
like the "cross between a pris
oner of war and an Indian
fakir," that Shepard makes him
out to be.
For all his wealth and power
Hughes lived in fear for his life.
He survived on cans of
Campbell's soup and had himself
whisked away at night from one
secret location in Latin Ameri
ca to another. But his greatest
obsession was with infection —
the invisible microscopic ene
my.

In spite of all that has been
written on Hughes the man,
his motives remain a mystery,
making him perfect material
for a playwright. It is a pity that
Shepard gives us only a few
clues where there should be an
explanation. He leans too much
on the obvious, on what we al
ready know intuitively about
Hughes. His love of power —
"Nothing is harmless till it's
squashed," Hackamore says —
his fear of the outside world, of
other people and of death.
Shepard's play opens with the
bored Hackamore humming to
himself while spreading paper
towels all over his mostly naked
body to prevent dust from settl
ing on it — these Hackamore an
tics are the most humorous
parts of the play. Robert Elross
(Hackamore) steals the show.
But it is not enough.
Hackamore lets himself be
taken in by his childish but de
vious servant and bodyguard
Raul (Dennis Ludlow). Raul
succeeds in making himself the
only contact with the outside
world that Hackamore has left.
Finally, after years of hate, af
ter years of slaving, of obeying
Hackamore's every whim the
trap is set and Raul forces his
master at gunpoint to sign his
wealth away. How much better
the play would be if it were not
so predictable — if Hackamore
were a little more shrewd, as
Hughes must have been.
Hackamore could be a wonder
ful Shavian character if only
Shepard would let him.
Hackamore seems complete
ly resigned to his fate except for
a fleeting moment of desire
when he gets convinced that two
of his "women," Miami and
Luna, will save him from
himself. He has two of them
flown in — in separate jets —

and makes them perform a
striptease. This, together with
the "genius" blood that pours
into his veins from one of those
suspended bottles, makes him
regain some of his former
strength.
Hackamore orders his flying
jacket, goggles and gloves (or
rather replicas of them) and
makes a feeble attempt at con
vincing himself that he will fly
singlehandedly right to Vegas —
the city that he owns almost en
tirely.
But he is too far gone. In the
closing scene when the tables
turn and Raul gets everything,
Hackamore plays a pretend
game of airplane — making all
of the motions of his once virile
self but on his reclining chair.
As the bullets from Raul's gun
hit he shouts "I am dead to the
world, but I never been born,"
whatever that is supposed to
mean — I can't figure that one
out.
Shepard is not unintelligent,
on the contrary he is the Ameri
can version of Tom Stoppard —
the language of his dialogues
may be much plainer and much
more straightforward, but he
shares with Stoppard the love
ofphilosophical problems.
There are always the interest
ing questions. For example,
Hackamore is confused about
who he is, who gives the orders.
Then there are the questions of
what is illusion and what is re
ality.
But Shepard falls into the
same trap as his English col
league. He is a mind teaser. He
heightens the expectations of
the audience and then leaves
them without allowing them to
climax. Hackamore's problems
are never carried to their con
clusion.


Miami (Kathy Baker) and Luna (FrancineLembi) act out episodes from their lives at the request of
Henry Hackamore (Robert Elross).
