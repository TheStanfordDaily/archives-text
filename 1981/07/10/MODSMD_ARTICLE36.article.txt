# Berkeley Rep can use more daring
## 
### Mike Hale 
People who grumble about
the predominance of the A.C.T.
in the local theater-going mind
will be happy to know that an
other Bay Area theater group is
making a bid for the big time.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre is kicking off its first
season in a new location, on Ad
dison one-half block from Shat
tuck in downtown Berkeley.
They have instituted rotating
repertory, with seven plays
planned for the coming season,
and are currently presenting
British playwright Alan
Ayckboum's trilogy The Nor
man Conquests in a 10-week
summer season.
Anyone concerned with the
general health of the arts can
only applaud Berkeley Rep's
ambitious program of ex
pansion, and wish the group the
best of luck. Already, however,
negative effects of that ex
pansion are appearing. These
effects are most obvious in the
selection of plays for the 1981-82
season. Of the seven plays, five
are "classics" of one sort or an
other: Shakespeare, Chekhov,
Shaw, Miller, and The Diary of
Anne Frank. A sixth. Christ
opher Hampton's Savages, is a
British National Theatre prod
uct from 1973. The closest thing
to a new play in the bunch is The
Belle of Amherst, whicu pre
miered in Seatt'a in 1976.
Berkeley Rep seems to be com
peting with A.C.T. for a "least
adventurous" award; it is, in
fact, looking more and more
like an A.C.T. clone.
The Norman Conquests is a
case in point. The three plays
were a hit in the West End, and a
hit again on Broadway (in 1975),
and were broadcast over PBS,
so now they're safe for
Berkeley. The production I saw
of the third play, Round and
Round the Garden, summed up
the whole Berkeley Rep ap
proach. It was so slick that only
the garden wall kept the whole
cast from sliding right off the
stage.
It was also very enjoyable, of
course — slick things almost
always are. Sitting in the beau
tiful new Mark Taper Mainstage
auditorium before the show was
a treat in itself, and while wait
ing one could examine Warren
Travis's lovely set. The garden
was created from five sets of
hanging screens, painted in
greens and reds, various
benches, and many, many pots
of flowers (which were avail
able for sale after the show).
It's centerpiece was a bench in
the shape of a wheelbarrow,
which figured heavily in the ac

tion — what there is of it. Round
and Round the Garden is main
ly talk (often very witty talk),
punctuated with occasional
bursts of wild action in which
the bench cum wheelbarrow is
thumped and jumped upon and
wheeled about the stage. The
play demands the sort of slick
production Berkeley Rep gives
it. Split-second timing and clear
reading are the primary virtues
here.
The play makes great de
mands on the strictly comic
abilities of its cast, and for the
most part the Berkeley Rep cast
met the challenge. Charles
Dean is excellent as Norman,
the "lovable" underaChiever
who tries to seduce both of his
sisters-in-law. The role is a dan
gerous one. for we must be
made to believe that three dif
ferent, intelligent women, with
widely varying personalities,
could all be attracted to an as
sistant librarian who lies and
cheats and gossips and drinks
too much. Dean convinces us,
and carries several scenes,
though threatened by the trite
ness of other portrayals. Espe
cially good is Anne Swift, who
plays Norman's wife Ruth.
Ruth must be a cut above the
rest of the cast in class and wit
(she married Norman for love,
and supports him), and Swift
makes her that and more, giving
a stunning performance.
The structure of The Norman
Conquests has been much dis
cussed. The three plays, all of
which are full-length and meant
to be presented on different
nights, cover the same time pe
riod (Saturday night to Monday
morning), but each is limited to
one part of a country estate: one
takes place upstairs, one down
stairs, and one (Round and
Round the Garden) in the
garden.
They can be seen in any order,
but they must all be seen.
Round and Round the Garden
fizzles near the end, because a
large chunk of the action takes
place indoors Sunday night. Un
fortunately, the complexity
gained through the trilogy de
vice is a complexity of plot only.
Ayckbourn's defenders see
him as a new, more enjoyable
Pinter, but is much more in the
line of Noel Coward or Phillip
Barry. Ayckbourn's forte is
drawing room comedy, and he
would have been better off if he
had never thought of the trilogy
gimmick; The Norman Con
quests. while it could have made
one very good, very funny play,
isn't really worth making three
trips and paying for three
tickets.
