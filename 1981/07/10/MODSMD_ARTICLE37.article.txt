Thatcher lashes out at 'greed'
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lashed
out at urban rioters yesterday, calling their actions a
"spree of naked greed." Her government was considering
drafting a new Riot Act to deal with violence that has bro
ken out in English cities for six straight nights.
In a heated session at the House of Commons the prime
minister's comments were greeted with repeated shouts
of "You stupid woman!" by Labor Member of Parliament
Eric Heffer, who represents a constituency in Liverpool.
That northern industrial city Sunday night experienced
riots that police described as the worst in 200 years.
The angry Heffer at times was physically restrained by
Labor Deputy Whip Walter Harrison.
Thatcher disputed assertions that unemployment and
urban decay were the cause of the rioting in London's
Southall and Wood Green sections and in the northwest
cities of Manchester and Liverpool. Hundreds of police
and young people were injured and millions of dollars in
damage was done to homes and businesses.
"There are many poor societies which are scrupulously
honorable in everything they do and would not sink to sonje
of the things we have seen," she said.
Thatcher said she agreed with a Daily Mirror editorial
— which she read — that said the violence "had nothing to
do with ... problems of bad housing and unemployment. It
was a spree of naked greed."
A chorus of Laborites joined Heffer in heckling the
prime minister.
"Your policies are ripping away the fabric of our socie
ty," said legislator Bob Brown of Newcastle.
Officials haggle over Conoco sale
Washington — Officials of the Department of Justice
and the Federal Trade Commission are in the midst of a
highly political and potentially bitter battle to determine
which agency will review E.I. du Pontde Nemours & Co. s
proposed $7.3 billion acquisition of Conoco Inc., sources
said yesterday.
Both agencies, citing expertise in the chemical and pe
troleum markets, proposed reviewing what would be the
largest corporate merger in American history during a
private meeting of agency officials yesterday, the sources
stated.
Justice Department representatives reportedly told
FTC staff members that the case is viewed as a major test
of the Reagan administration's willingness to approve
mergers, particularly among companies in different in
dustries. "This is clearly a big test case for Justice," one
source said.
The case is viewed as "symbolic of the administration's
efforts to put their imprint on enforcement of the antitrust
laws," said one high-level source.

Begin responds to Haig note
Washington — A toughly worded note from Secretary of
State Alexander Haig to Israeli Prime Minister Men
achem Begin concerning Israel's use of U.S. warplanes to
bomb an Iraqi nuclear reactor last month provoked a bit
ter response from Begin in a meeting with U.S. Am
bassador Samuel Lewis, sources said yesterday.
The issue, which reflects the depths of feeling on both
sides about the controversial air strike in Iraq, is extreme
ly sensitive, and officials are reluctant to discuss it or to
provide precise details.
U.S. loosens human rights policies
Washington — The administration, countering criticism
from congressional liberals angered by a decision to stop
opposing international development bank loans to four
Latin American military regimes, yesterday reiterated
its determination to continue dismantling the activist hu

man rights policies of former president Jimmy Carter.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig testily defended the
banking decision on grounds that the four countries have
shown "dramatic, dramatic reductions" in abuses of hu
man rights, and the White House enunciated a new policy
on arms transfers that failed even to mention human
rights.
The State Department also took the unusual step of pub
licly chastizing the American chairman of the Inter-Amer
ican Human Rights Commission because he had written an
article mentioning rights violations in Chile.
