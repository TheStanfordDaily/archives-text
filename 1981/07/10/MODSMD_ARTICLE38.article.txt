# Panel says fetus is human
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — A Senate subcommittee decided yester
day, by a 3-2 party-line vote, that human life begins at con
ception and a fetus is entitled to the legal rights of a human
being.
The move was the first congressional step toward ending
eight years of legalized abortions in the nation. But final
action on the controversial legislation, which is commonly
known as the "Human Rights Bill" — a major goal of anti
abortion forces — apparently will be delayed until next
year.
In approving the human life bill, conser, atives on the
Senate Judiciary Separation of Powers Subcommittee
agreed to delay a vote in the full 18-member committee un
til hearings are held on a constitutional amendment ban
ning abortion.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the Senate Judiciary
constitution subcommittee he chairs will not hold hearings
on the anti-abortion amendment until this fall and as a
"practical" matter final action on either measure won't
occur until next year.
This allowed both sides of the issue to declare victory.
"It's definitely a win for us," said John Mackey of the Ad
Hoc Committee in Defense of Life, an anti-abortion group.
"It's the first substantive piece of legislation on abortion
ever to be reported out of subcommittee."
Yet, National Abortion Rights Action League spokes
woman Marguerite Beck-Rex also claimed a victory : "The

battle is back where it started — on the constitutional
amendment."
Anti-abortion forces designed the human life bill as a
maneuver to circumvent the 1973 Supreme Court decision
that voided most laws against abortion. The bill could be
passed by a simple majority, rather than the two-thirds
majority required for a constitutional amendment.
