# Reagan goals require 100,000 more troops
## Army hints draft needed 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Army has told Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger in a secret re
port that almost 100,000 more soldiers will be
needed to carry out President Ronald Rea
gan's military strategy and that it doubts they
can be recruited under "the volunteer con
cept," suggesting a draft may be required.
The report is the Program Objective Memo
randum detailing the Army's manpower and
weapons plans for fiscal years 1983 through
1987 and requesting money to carry them out.
Citing Reagan's plan to expand the Rapid
Deployment Force — designed to rush to emer
gencies in the Persian Gulf — as part of new
demands for officers and troops, the report
said the Army should grow to 870,000 by fiscal
1987. That would be about 96,000 above its cur
rent force and 83,700 more than the number ex
pected in uniform by the end of fiscal 1982.
The Army's civilian work force also would
expand under the new five-year plan, from
381,700 in fiscal 1982 to 412,900 in fiscal 1987.
In discussing its plan to field a force of
870,000 by 1987, the Army report said: "This
growth is necessary to support substantial
force structure increases and will require ex
traordinary manpower policies to include sig
nificant augmentation to the Volunteer Con
cept."
Although the words "draft" and "conscrip
tion" were not used in asking for such augmen
tation, several Pentagon sources said the
Army is counting on a draft eventually, wheth
er or not that is officially admitted.
Asked if what he has called the "new" mili
tary strategy will require conscription, Wein
berger said through his spokesman Wednesday
that "the draft is not anything anybody is con
sidering." Although he could disapprove any
Army requests to resume the draft, Wein

berger has left himself the loophole of resort
ing to it if the all-volunteer system fails to at
tract enough soldiers.
The volunteer force replaced the draft in
1973 as part of the backlash after the Vietnam
war. The military services are currently re
cruiting enough volunteers to fill their ranks,
although leaders have warned that the pool of
available young men and women will shrink in
this decade. If the economy improves, fewer
young people are expected to join the military
since civilian jobs will be available.
The volunteer force has been criticized
heavily in Congress, with a growing number of
lawmakers contending that it costs too much,
puts too much of the defense burden on minor
ities and the poor and is providing 9-to-5 sol
diers who see the military as just another job,
not an obligation.
Although Reagan opposed draft registration
and the draft during his campaign, he has not
moved to repeal the registration requirement
enacted under President Carter. To avoid a re
turn to the draft, Reagan has vowed to improve
life in the volunteer force through higher pay
and other benefits.
The administration Wednesday announced
the formation of a high-level manpower task
force that officials acknowledged could lead to
recommendation of some type of draft to aug
ment or replace the volunteer force.
The official said the other military services
also will need more people to carry out the ad
ministration's military strategy. He estimated
a 10 percent increase would be required by
1985, meaning 200,000 additional officers and
troops for the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps unless civilians or reservists fill
some of the active-duty billets. The United
States now has 2,031,395 men and women on ac
tive duty.
