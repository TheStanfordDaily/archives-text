## Block grants give states control 
### 
This article is the second of a
series of articles on the emer
ging 1982 budget.
By The Associated Press
Washington — With a few.
brief paragraphs, Congress is
moving to unwrite some of the
most important social legisla
tion of the 19705, replacing it
with blocks of money that the
states will have broad freedom
deciding how to spend.
The block grant proposals —
part of President Reagan's
budget-cutting package — will
affect programs ranging from
day care to foster care, from
homemaker services for the old
and handicapped to protective
services for abused children and
battered wives. 0

Budgetl982

The block grants will give
states control over whethfer to
spend money on maternal and
child health- programs, water
fluoridation, rat control and aid
to communities facing court
ordered desegregation.
Reagan has described the
block grant approach as "an in
termediate step" in his
"dream" of turning back to the
states the authority over social,
programs and the tax revenues
to pay for them.
However, Congress is not yet

ready to go as far as the presi
dent would like.
While Reagan proposed block
grants for nearly all health and
education programs, the House
and Senate kept many as "cate
gorical" programs, meaning
that Washington can still tell the
states how to spend the money.
Despite such victories, Rea
gan critics contend the block
grants heading for con
gressional passage will devas
tate an array of important so
cial service programs.
They say the Reagan "ap
proach will touch off a scramble
for the money and tempt states
to divert funds intended for the
"truly needy" to other state
needs, such as state tax cuts and
roadbuilding.
"The administration is in the
process of dismantling all the
requirements that federal mon
ey go to people who are truly
needy insteadbf those that have
political clout," said John Carr,
spokesman for the Ad Hoc
Coalition on Block Grants, a
group representing labor, liber
al and religious organizations*.
Carr argued that block grants
could wreak political havoc in
state legislatures, with one
needy group pitted against an
other in a battle for a reduced
pot of federal money.
Conservatives, however, are
welcoming the block grant ap
proach, saying it will "defund

the left" and reduce the clout of
liberal special interest groups in
Washington.
"Block grants will require the
special interest groups to work
in 50 locations to affect policy
changes instead of in Washing
ton, D.C. alone," declared a
coalition of 80 conservative or
ganizations, including the Moral
Majority and Conservative
Caucus.
The block grant approach is
contained in both the House and
Senate versions of Reagan's
budget-cutting plan. The House
and Senate passed separate bills
last month and a conference
committee must now iron out
differences in the two bills.
But since both bills contain
similar approaches to block
grants, the concept is virtually
certain to be included in any leg
islation that wins final con
gressional approval, expected
in August.
In one paragraph in the hasti
ly drafted House Republican
budget proposal, some of the
major liberal victories of the
last decade are wiped out.
"The following provisions of
law hereby are repealed,"
starts the paragraph.
The victims that follow in
clude "Title XX of the Social Se
curity Act," a $3.1 billion pack
age of federal programs de
signed to help the nation's poor,
elderly, handicapped, battered

wives and abused children.
Title XX, enacted in 1975, pro
vides money to states for day
care, job counseling, transpor
tation to hospitals, foster care,
vocational rehabilitation and
protection of children and
abused adults. Last year, the
program aided an estimated 11
million people.
The House bill would also re
peal child abuse laws passed in
1974 and 1978, and major sec
tions of the 1974 Community Ser
vices Act.
Republicans estimate that
those targeted programs would
have cost a total of billion
next year.
In their place, the House
would approve $3.1 billion — re
flecting about a 16 percent cut.
The money would be divided

among the states which could
then decide whether to continue
appropriations for the various
social programs.
Critics note that no cap is
placed on "administrative
costs," raising fears that state
governments might use their
grants to pay state salaries and
thereby free state money for
other purposes.
States would also conduct
their own audits on how the fed
eral money is spent.
Although the House bill states
that appropriations would be
continued for three years at the
$3.1 billion level, block grant op
ponents contend that the admin
istration might well come back
next year and seek even deeper
cuts.

ordered desegregation.
Reagan has described the
block grant approach as "an in
termediate step" in his
"dream" of turning back to the
states the authority over social,
programs and the tax revenues
to pay for them.
However, Congress is not yet

ready to go as far as the presi
dent would like.
While Reagan proposed block
grants for nearly all health and
education programs, the House
and Senate kept many as "cate
gorical" programs, meaning
that Washington can still tell the
states how to spend the money.
Despite such victories, Rea
gan critics contend the block
grants heading for con
gressional passage will devas
tate an array of important so
cial service programs.
They say the Reagan "ap
proach will touch off a scramble
for the money and tempt states
to divert funds intended for the
"truly needy" to other state
needs, such as state tax cuts and
roadbuilding.
"The administration is in the
process of dismantling all the
requirements that federal mon
ey go to people who are truly
needy insteadbf those that have
political clout," said John Carr,
spokesman for the Ad Hoc
Coalition on Block Grants, a
group representing labor, liber
al and religious organizations*.
Carr argued that block grants
could wreak political havoc in
state legislatures, with one
needy group pitted against an
other in a battle for a reduced
pot of federal money.
Conservatives, however, are
welcoming the block grant ap
proach, saying it will "defund

the left" and reduce the clout of
liberal special interest groups in
Washington.
"Block grants will require the
special interest groups to work
in 50 locations to affect policy
changes instead of in Washing
ton, D.C. alone," declared a
coalition of 80 conservative or
ganizations, including the Moral
Majority and Conservative
Caucus.
The block grant approach is
contained in both the House and
Senate versions of Reagan's
budget-cutting plan. The House
and Senate passed separate bills
last month and a conference
committee must now iron out
differences in the two bills.
But since both bills contain
similar approaches to block
grants, the concept is virtually
certain to be included in any leg
islation that wins final con
gressional approval, expected
in August.
In one paragraph in the hasti
ly drafted House Republican
budget proposal, some of the
major liberal victories of the
last decade are wiped out.
"The following provisions of
law hereby are repealed,"
starts the paragraph.
The victims that follow in
clude "Title XX of the Social Se
curity Act," a $3.1 billion pack
age of federal programs de
signed to help the nation's poor,
elderly, handicapped, battered

wives and abused children.
Title XX, enacted in 1975, pro
vides money to states for day
care, job counseling, transpor
tation to hospitals, foster care,
vocational rehabilitation and
protection of children and
abused adults. Last year, the
program aided an estimated 11
million people.
The House bill would also re
peal child abuse laws passed in
1974 and 1978, and major sec
tions of the 1974 Community Ser
vices Act.
Republicans estimate that
those targeted programs would
have cost a total of billion
next year.
In their place, the House
would approve $3.1 billion — re
flecting about a 16 percent cut.
The money would be divided

among the states which could
then decide whether to continue
appropriations for the various
social programs.
Critics note that no cap is
placed on "administrative
costs," raising fears that state
governments might use their
grants to pay state salaries and
thereby free state money for
other purposes.
States would also conduct
their own audits on how the fed
eral money is spent.
Although the House bill states
that appropriations would be
continued for three years at the
$3.1 billion level, block grant op
ponents contend that the admin
istration might well come back
next year and seek even deeper
cuts.

part of President Reagan's
budget-cutting package — will
