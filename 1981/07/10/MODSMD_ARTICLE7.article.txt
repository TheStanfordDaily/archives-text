# Reagan administration will be slow to bust Big Biz
## 
### 
(This week, the Keagan adminis
tration dropped two antitrust
suits filed by the Carter adminis
tration, signalling a significant
shift in the role government will
play in limiting the size of large
corporations.
If hile some existing cases will
still be prosecuted, the Reagan
team at the Justice Department
has all but ceased any new trust
busting. Following is an analysis
of the administration's posi
tion.)
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Ever since the
days of Theodore Roosevelt, the
old trust-buster, at the turn of
the century, the federal govern
ment has ridden herd on the ten
dency of Big Business to form
monopolistic combines.
As T.R. put it: "We do not
wish to destroy corporations,
but we do wish to make them
subserve the public good." His
policy became the guiding stan
dard for generations of federal
antitrust lawyers.
But now, although corpo
rations are still growing bigger
and stronger, enforcement of
the nation's antitrust laws is
being scaled back by the Reagan
administration with scarcely a
murmur of protest.

Attorney General William
French Smith spelled out the
new approach in unmistakable
terms in a recent speech. While
declaring that "federal anti
trust law forms the constitution
of our economic liberties,"
Smith said that he would "spare
no effort in also eliminating an
ticompetitive governmental
practices."
The result of the shift, accord
ing to its supporters, could be a
significant drop in the cost of
doing business for some large
firms and renewed competitive
muscle for American com
panies operating overseas.
Concentrations of power
Opponents of the new ap
proach — those that remain vo
cal — continue to warn that an
"anti-antitrust movement"
could lead to dangerous concen
trations of economic power in
the boardrooms of relatively
few corporations, leaving con
sumers at their mercy.
But these critics of the shift in
U.S. policy are a tiny minority.
They have been overwhelmed
by advocates of change who
make two points:
First, Department of Justice
policy makers have finally
caught up with 20 years of in

tellectual debate in which tradi
tional views of antitrust en
forcement have been effective
ly attacked by advocates of less
interference.
Second, the realities of com
peting in worldwide markets
have changed so much, and the
ability of U.S. corporations to
compete has become so impor
tant to the nation's economic
health, that antitrust enforcers
are having second thoughts
about the wisdom of stringent
enforcement overseas. Com
pared with "Japan Inc.," even
the biggest U.S. firms do not
seem so large.
In opposition, antitrust sup
porters from the Carter admin
istration era still contend that
vigorous enforcement "is more
relevant today than ever."
But even they acknowledge
that a major overhauling of
traditional policy is needed,
such as restricting the ability of
private parties to file treble
damage suits and doing away
with dual enforcement of anti
trust laws by both the Depart
ment of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission.
New direction
So far, the new direction in
antitrust has taken this shape:

•A revision, now under way,
of the Department of Justice's
guidelines on permissible
mergers. The changes, which
Smith said "some may consider
drastic," are expected to in
crease the minimum levels of
concentration allowed in a mar
ket.
•Serious consideration of
eliminating so-called "dual en
forcement" of the antitrust
laws by the Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Com
mission. Budget Director David
Stockman earlier proposed tak
ing the FTC out of antitrust, but
the idea was shelved. It is ex
pected to reappear on Capitol
Hill later this year.
•A department's request to
courts to modify or vacate any
of the 1,200 antitrust judgments
and decrees of the past that it
feels have begun to hinder rath
er than promote competition.
•Reduction of the kinds of
mergers about which com
panies must give enforcement
authorities advance notice, as
well as cuts in the amount of in
formation that must be pro
vidfed.
Intense merger activity
The administration's de
cisions were announced at a

time of intense corporate
merger activity. DuPont this
week announced its intention to
acquire Conoco for $7.3 billion.
That would be the largest
merger in American history, if
the government decides to per
mit it.
According to figures com
piled by the W. T. Grimm Co. of
Chicago, corporate mergers
were up 46 percent in the first
quarter of this year from 1980
levels, and are expected to be
continuing at about that rate
when second-quarter figures
are released.
"There's no question that
businesses see a more favorable
atmosphere for mergers and ac
quisitions," said one Washing
ton lawyer who specializes in
antitrust law and asked to be
anonymous.
As an example of what he sees
as the errors of the old trust
busting approach, Attorney
General Smith cited the as
sumption that competition is
synonymous with a large
number of competitors in an in
dustry. The disappearance of
some competitors "should not
be taken as indisputable proof
that something is amiss in an in
dustry," Smith said.

suits filed by the Carter adminis

corporations.

team at the Justice Department
has all but ceased any new trust
busting. Following is an analysis
of the administration's posi
tion.)
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Ever since the
days of Theodore Roosevelt, the
old trust-buster, at the turn of
the century, the federal govern
ment has ridden herd on the ten
dency of Big Business to form
monopolistic combines.
As T.R. put it: "We do not
wish to destroy corporations,
but we do wish to make them
subserve the public good." His
policy became the guiding stan
dard for generations of federal
antitrust lawyers.
But now, although corpo
rations are still growing bigger
and stronger, enforcement of
the nation's antitrust laws is
being scaled back by the Reagan
administration with scarcely a
murmur of protest.

Attorney General William
French Smith spelled out the
new approach in unmistakable
terms in a recent speech. While
declaring that "federal anti
trust law forms the constitution
of our economic liberties,"
Smith said that he would "spare
no effort in also eliminating an
ticompetitive governmental
practices."
The result of the shift, accord
ing to its supporters, could be a
significant drop in the cost of
doing business for some large
firms and renewed competitive
muscle for American com
panies operating overseas.
Concentrations of power
Opponents of the new ap
proach — those that remain vo
cal — continue to warn that an
"anti-antitrust movement"
could lead to dangerous concen
trations of economic power in
the boardrooms of relatively
few corporations, leaving con
sumers at their mercy.
But these critics of the shift in
U.S. policy are a tiny minority.
They have been overwhelmed
by advocates of change who
make two points:
First, Department of Justice
policy makers have finally
caught up with 20 years of in

tellectual debate in which tradi
tional views of antitrust en
forcement have been effective
ly attacked by advocates of less
interference.
Second, the realities of com
peting in worldwide markets
have changed so much, and the
ability of U.S. corporations to
compete has become so impor
tant to the nation's economic
health, that antitrust enforcers
are having second thoughts
about the wisdom of stringent
enforcement overseas. Com
pared with "Japan Inc.," even
the biggest U.S. firms do not
seem so large.
In opposition, antitrust sup
porters from the Carter admin
istration era still contend that
vigorous enforcement "is more
relevant today than ever."
But even they acknowledge
that a major overhauling of
traditional policy is needed,
such as restricting the ability of
private parties to file treble
damage suits and doing away
with dual enforcement of anti
trust laws by both the Depart
ment of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission.
New direction
So far, the new direction in
antitrust has taken this shape:

•A revision, now under way,
of the Department of Justice's
guidelines on permissible
mergers. The changes, which
Smith said "some may consider
drastic," are expected to in
crease the minimum levels of
concentration allowed in a mar
ket.
•Serious consideration of
eliminating so-called "dual en
forcement" of the antitrust
laws by the Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Com
mission. Budget Director David
Stockman earlier proposed tak
ing the FTC out of antitrust, but
the idea was shelved. It is ex
pected to reappear on Capitol
Hill later this year.
•A department's request to
courts to modify or vacate any
of the 1,200 antitrust judgments
and decrees of the past that it
feels have begun to hinder rath
er than promote competition.
•Reduction of the kinds of
mergers about which com
panies must give enforcement
authorities advance notice, as
well as cuts in the amount of in
formation that must be pro
vidfed.
Intense merger activity
The administration's de
cisions were announced at a

time of intense corporate
merger activity. DuPont this
week announced its intention to
acquire Conoco for $7.3 billion.
That would be the largest
merger in American history, if
the government decides to per
mit it.
According to figures com
piled by the W. T. Grimm Co. of
Chicago, corporate mergers
were up 46 percent in the first
quarter of this year from 1980
levels, and are expected to be
continuing at about that rate
when second-quarter figures
are released.
"There's no question that
businesses see a more favorable
atmosphere for mergers and ac
quisitions," said one Washing
ton lawyer who specializes in
antitrust law and asked to be
anonymous.
