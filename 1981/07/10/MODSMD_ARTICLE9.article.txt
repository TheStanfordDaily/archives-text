# Fledgling nonwhite unions strike in S. Africa
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Port Elizabeth, South Africa
— South African non-white
workers, poorly paid and often
discriminated against on the
factory floor, are forming their
own unions now and showing a
new militancy in Port Eliz
abeth, a major seaport and in
dustrial center.
Until 1979, South Africa's
black workers and those of mix
ed race, called Coloreds, were
not permitted to organize ex
cept as affiliates of white
unions. Now, only a small frac
tion of them are organized, but
already they are challenging
Port Elizabeth's leading in
dustrial firms, including sever
al American firms.
In recent months they have
called their members out on
strike at the American plants of
Ford, General Motors, and
Firestone.
The non-whites have made
considerable gains since Prime
Minister Pieter Botha an
nounced in September, 1979,
that all workers, regardless of
color, would be permitted to or
ganize unions, and declared that
there would no longer be any job
discrimination on racial
grounds.
Restrictions
Before then, there were a
wide range of restrictions
against nonwhite workers. By
law they could not join white

unions or strike. With few ex
ceptions, they could hold jobs
requiring only rudimentary
skills; the better jobs were re
served for whites.
Still, however, no more than 5
percent of the non-whites are
believed to be organized in ef
fective unions; striking is still
illegal in most circumstances,
and employers still tend to react
to strikes by firing the strikers.
The two unions involved in the
Port Elizabeth unrest are
further hampered by their own
divisive struggle for control
over essentially the same group
of workers. One union is made
up of Coloreds and the other of
blacks who broke away to form
a rival union.
This is seen as a result of the
minority white government's
efforts to divide and weaken the
non-whites. Over the years, the
blacks, Coloreds, and Asians
have come to distrust one anoth
er almost as much as the whites.
Yet there have been some
positive changes for the two
Port Elizabeth unions. One of
the two is the Motor Assemblers
and Component Workers Union,
made up of blacks and headed by
a man named Government Zini,
40; the other is the National
Union of Motor Assembly and
Rubber Workers, Black and Col
ored workers headed by Freddie
Sauls, 41.
Some of Sauls' people had

walked out at Ford in late 1979
over the case of a black
draftsman named Thomarile
Botha, who was told that he
would have to stop taking part in
political activities or resign. He
resigned. Hundreds of workers
went on strike in protest.
By the time Sauls arranged a
settlement, many of his fol
lowers had defected to the rival
union being organized by Zini.
Zini rejected the terms ar
ranged by Sauls, and his work
ers remained out until mid-Jan
uary.
Both unions agreed to roughly
the same terms — reinstate
ment of the strikers and restora
tion of the draftsman Botha to
his job, but by this time Botha
had been detained in connection
with his political activity and
banned — a sort of house arrest
— for five years.
For a relatively weak union,
Zini's attracts a good bit of at
tention from the government se
curity police. Five of its of
ficials have been detained in re
cent weeks, though none has
been formally charged.
This leaves Zini and Dennis
Neer, the general secretary, as
the only top officials still free.
Both Zini and Neer work at the
Ford plant and do their union
work at night in a dingy office
across from the Port Elizabeth
court building. Zini admits to
being short of funds and has

sought support from American
and European unions.
Demotions
After the most recent strike
at Ford, Zini and Neer were de
moted. Both were returned
from the division to the as
sembly line. This, they said,
meant a 50 percent pay cut.
Fred Ferreira, Ford's in
dustrial relations director, con
firmed the demotions. He said it
has become company policy not
to entrust responsible company
jobs — such as training — to
union leaders because of the
likelihood of divided loyalty.
Ford is regarded here as one
of the more enlightened em
ployers. It has an integrated

work force and conforms, Fer
reira said, with the so-called
Sullivan Code of Principles for
improving conditions among the
workers despite discriminatory
laws.
The government is sensitive
about black unions becoming
politicized, and the security po
lice frequently crack down on
black labor activity. The police
are particularly watchful here
and in East London, another
port in the area known as the
Eastern Cape.
The black leader, Steve Biko,
was fatally injured during po
lice interrogation here in 1977.

The two unions involved in the
Port Elizabeth unrest are
further hampered by their own
divisive struggle for control
over essentially the same group
of workers. One union is made
up of Coloreds and the other of
blacks who broke away to form
a rival union.
This is seen as a result of the
minority white government's
efforts to divide and weaken the
non-whites. Over the years, the
blacks, Coloreds, and Asians
have come to distrust one anoth
er almost as much as the whites.
Yet there have been some
positive changes for the two
Port Elizabeth unions. One of
the two is the Motor Assemblers
and Component Workers Union,
made up of blacks and headed by
a man named Government Zini,
40; the other is the National
Union of Motor Assembly and
Rubber Workers, Black and Col
ored workers headed by Freddie
Sauls, 41.
Some of Sauls' people had

walked out at Ford in late 1979
over the case of a black
draftsman named Thomarile
Botha, who was told that he
would have to stop taking part in
political activities or resign. He
resigned. Hundreds of workers
went on strike in protest.
By the time Sauls arranged a
settlement, many of his fol
lowers had defected to the rival
union being organized by Zini.
Zini rejected the terms ar
ranged by Sauls, and his work
ers remained out until mid-Jan
uary.
Both unions agreed to roughly
the same terms — reinstate
ment of the strikers and restora
tion of the draftsman Botha to
his job, but by this time Botha
had been detained in connection
with his political activity and
banned — a sort of house arrest
— for five years.
For a relatively weak union,
Zini's attracts a good bit of at
tention from the government se
curity police. Five of its of
ficials have been detained in re
cent weeks, though none has
been formally charged.
This leaves Zini and Dennis
Neer, the general secretary, as
the only top officials still free.
Both Zini and Neer work at the
Ford plant and do their union
work at night in a dingy office
across from the Port Elizabeth
court building. Zini admits to
being short of funds and has

sought support from American
and European unions.
Demotions
After the most recent strike
at Ford, Zini and Neer were de
moted. Both were returned
from the division to the as
sembly line. This, they said,
meant a 50 percent pay cut.
Fred Ferreira, Ford's in
dustrial relations director, con
firmed the demotions. He said it
has become company policy not
to entrust responsible company
jobs — such as training — to
union leaders because of the
likelihood of divided loyalty.
Ford is regarded here as one
of the more enlightened em
ployers. It has an integrated

work force and conforms, Fer
reira said, with the so-called
Sullivan Code of Principles for
improving conditions among the
workers despite discriminatory
laws.
The government is sensitive
about black unions becoming
politicized, and the security po
lice frequently crack down on
black labor activity. The police
are particularly watchful here
and in East London, another
port in the area known as the
Eastern Cape.
The black leader, Steve Biko,
was fatally injured during po
lice interrogation here in 1977.
Port Elizabeth, South Africa
— South African non-white
workers, poorly paid and often
discriminated against on the
factory floor, are forming their
own unions now and showing a
new militancy in Port Eliz
abeth, a major seaport and in
dustrial center.
Until 1979, South Africa's
black workers and those of mix
ed race, called Coloreds, were
not permitted to organize ex
cept as affiliates of white
unions. Now, only a small frac
tion of them are organized, but
already they are challenging
Port Elizabeth's leading in
dustrial firms, including sever
al American firms.
In recent months they have
called their members out on
strike at the American plants of
Ford, General Motors, and
Firestone.
The non-whites have made
considerable gains since Prime
Minister Pieter Botha an
nounced in September, 1979,
that all workers, regardless of
color, would be permitted to or
ganize unions, and declared that
there would no longer be any job
discrimination on racial
grounds.
Restrictions
Before then, there were a
wide range of restrictions
against nonwhite workers. By
law they could not join white

unions or strike. With few ex
ceptions, they could hold jobs
requiring only rudimentary
skills; the better jobs were re
served for whites.
Still, however, no more than 5
percent of the non-whites are
believed to be organized in ef
fective unions; striking is still
illegal in most circumstances,
and employers still tend to react
to strikes by firing the strikers.
