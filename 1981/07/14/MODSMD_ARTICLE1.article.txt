# Aerial spraying commences
## Reagan Cabinet threatens quarantine, bans use of Moffett 
### 
From the Daily wire services
The California Supreme
Court, after a desperate at
tempt by attorneys represent
ing Santa Clara County and
three cities within the county to
stop spraying early this morn
ing, refused to block aerial
pesticide application against
the Mediterranean fruit fly.
The ruling cleared the way for
an airborne assault against the
fruit fly. That was to begin at 2
a.m. this morning when a heli
copter loaded with malathion
was to spray the first 17 of 117
square miles targeted for
spraying in the next two
months.
But late last night the state
said that full-strength spraying
would not begin until tomorrow
at 12:01 a.m., for reasons that
are partly security, partly be
cause of a number of changes
that had to be made.
The state said it would only do
test flying from 9 p.m. to mid
night last night. After midnight,
when the full application was to
begin, the state said it would use

"just a small amount" of aerial
spray over "a few square
miles." The state had planned
to spray over 17 square miles.
The Supreme Court decision
came shortly after Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Bruce Allen also refused to
grant an injunction.
Governor Jerry Brown was
forced Friday to renege on his
previous plea for an extensive
ground program by ordering
aerial spraying after the secre
tary of the U.S. Agriculture De
partment (USDA), John Block,
threatened to quarantine all af

fected fruits and vegetables
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger on Sunday refused
to permit use of Moffett Naval
Air Station as a staging ground
for the aerial spraying attack on
the Medfly. Weinberger, who is
from Hillsborough, cited the
protests and said he didn't want
to be involved, said California
Agricultural Director Richard
Rominger.
The USDA announced yes
terday that the quarantine area
had been enlarged to include all
of Santa Clara, San Mateo, and
Alameda counties.
