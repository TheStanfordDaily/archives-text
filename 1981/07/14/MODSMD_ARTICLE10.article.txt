## 
### Washington Post 
Mexico City — The most pop
ular hero of the Nicaraguan rev
olution resigned from the Sand
inista government in Managua
and left Nicaragua last week for
Panama, causing consternation
among many Nicaraguans and
raising speculation that strains
within the Sandinista leadership
are starting to show.
Eden Pastora, 43, became in
ternationally famous as "Com
mandante Zero" while leading
the takeover of the Nicaraguan
National Palace in 1978 that
marked a beginning of the end
for the Somoza dictatorship.
Pastora said in his officially re
leased letter of resignation as
vice minister of defense that he
was leaving to fight in other rev
olutions.
"I am going to the trenches
where the duty of an interna
tionalist combatant conducts
me," said the letter to armed

forces commander Humberto
Ortega.
The statement did not specify
where Pastora intended to fight,
but Guatemala and El Salvador
were clearly implied. "I cannot
tolerate seeing peasants burned
alive in embassies, nor can I to
lerate seeing priests shot while
they conduct masses or in the
conduct of their Christian
duties. I cannot tolerate seeing
the killing by hunger of defense
less people in brother nations
while I cannot fire my revolu
tionary rifle," the letter said.
The Sandinista National Di
rectorate issued a statement
last week saying it would not ac
cept Pastora's resignation or
that of the vice minister of the
interior, Jose Valdivia, who ac
companied him. But
Nicaraguan immigration of
ficials said both men, accom
panied by about 10 other people
whose names were not im

mediately available, had left
the country.
Surprise and sorrow marked
the reaction of many
Nicaraguans. "We all feel it
very much," said one young
woman who works in the gov
ernment.
The letter suggested what
many Nicaraguans have sus
pected, that Pastora was not
happy with his role as an admin
istrator, even though he was in
charge of building up the
militias into a force of more
than 100,000.
"He was always more of a
guerrilla than a desk person,"
said a diplomat.
