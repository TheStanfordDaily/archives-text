# Village residents protest malathion spraying
## 
### Craig Janeen Costa 
"Warning! This may be im
portant to your safety!" This
statement headlined a flyer
which was recently distributed
to residents of Escondido Vil
lage by a group of concerned
students. The flyer and ar
ranged courtyard meetings gen
erated considerable local public
interest in the alleged dangers
of aerial spraying of malathion.
Many students and their fami
lies were led to openly protest
the spraying, which is part of
the plan to eradicate the Medi
terranean fruit fly in the Santa
Clara Valley.
Barbara and Mike Hecht and
Susan Shepherd, graduate stu
dents in linguistics, organized
meetings and distributed writ
ten information. Barbara Hecht
said that the reaction of stu
dents was one of "concern and

total outrage." Many individ
uals began making plans to
leave the area during the
spraying periods, if at all pos
sible.
Students were warned that
potential dangers posed to hu
man health include birth de
fects, fetal malformations,
spontaneous abortions, cancer
and infertility, according to two
University pharmacologists.
Allen McGrath, a physician in
Los Gatos, stated that the risk is
particularly great for children
and the elderly, whose livers
may not be able to metabolize
the substance adequately. Oth
ers in a high-risk category in
clude persons suffering from
respiratory conditions such as
bronchitis, asthma and em
physema, or who have heart ail
ments, he said.
While the reaction against

aerial spraying may seem like
hysteria to some, others felt
that simply not enough was
known about the effects of
malathion to warrant such ac
tion at this time. Sumner
Kalman and Helen Blau, phar
macologists here, both in
dicated that extensive studies
should be conducted before any
large-scale spraying program
was undertaken.
"No such study has ever been
done with malathion, and I think
it would be unconscionable not
to carry out this type of survey
now," said Kalman.
While the various local city
councils have called repeatedly
for an environmental impact
study to be prepared prior to
aerial spraying of the area,
state officials claim that the
Medfly problem is an emer
gency which warrants waiving

the usual requirement of such a
study. Students reacted to calls
for health and environmental
studies and to indications by
Jerry Scribner, director of the
Medfly Project, that no clear in
formation is available on poten
tial hazards by campaigning
against aerial spraying at least
until such studies could be con
ducted.
Pregnant women and Stan
ford families 'with small chil
dren felt that they had been
placed in a powerless position.
Medfly project officials warned
that children should not touch,
ingest, or play on surfaces
sprayed with malathion, yet the
spraying will occur every six to
10 days for about 75 days.
Scribner said the chemical
would be toxic for 14 days. The
flyer distributed on campus
stated "malathion can be in
gested, absorbed through the
skin, as well as inhaled. Make
absolutely certain that young
children don't put anything in
their mouths that might have
been sprayed. Don't let them
play in the sand or on play equip
ment. Hose off any outside toys,
equipment, cars and bicycles."
Stanford students with young
children felt it would be im
possible to keep children in
doors and out of danger for the
two to three summer months
during which the spraying
would be conducted. The alter
native of leaving the area was
simply not available to many
students and spouses who attend
summer classes or hold jobs.
Project officials also reported
possibilities of damage to paint
on cars. As the number of poten
tial hazards and forms of dam
age grew, Stanford residents
began to protest formally.
Many people attended meet
ings, made phone calls, and
demonstrated actively against
the use of aerial spraying in our
area. Students flocked in num
bers to the Mountain View/Los
Altos City Council meeting and
to the Palo Alto City Council
meeting July 6.

Scribner presented the facts
of the planned program at the
meeting in Mountain View, and
the information was then re
layed to the Palo Alto meeting
The Palo Alto City Council
unanimously resolved to fight
aerial spraying through the le
gal system, taking it to the Unit
ed States Supreme Court if nec
essary, and to contact Governor
Jerry Brown personally as well
as through letters and tele
grams.
The resolution met with ap
plause from the students and
other concerned citizens who
stayed through the 4V2-hour
meeting to hear the Council's
discussion of the Medfly situ
ation.
Probably the most effective
demonstration occurred at the
Medfly Technical Review Com
mittee meeting July 7. Stanford
students, spouses, and children
wore protest signs and ex
pressed vocally their opinions in
an attempt to dissuade the com
mittee from pursuing aerial
spraying.
Students also carried out a
telephone campaign, contacting
State Assemblymen and Sena
tors, Brown, and President
Donald Kennedy.
Their phone calls were gener
ally received graciously, al
though by mid-afternoon last
Tuesday, the governor's office
would only accept votes cast in
favor of or against the spraying.
Students who phoned Brown's
office earlier in the day said
they had been able to speak to
aides and to express their com
ments and the nature of their
dissent against the spraying. By
Tuesday afternoon, Brown had
phoned the Medfly Project
Committee and asked them to
postpone their decision until he
could speak to them the next
day.
On Wednesday, Brown an
nounced he would not consider
aerial spraying at this time be
cause of the potential dangers to
"children and pregnant worn

en." But Friday, due to a threat

and vegetables in the state.
Brown reversed his decision.
While some of the other
elected officials who were
phoned said they were opposed
to the use of aerial spraying
now, others were unwilling to
take a stand.
Ron Katz, aide to Senator Dan
O'Keefe, for example, said that
the issue was "not ground
spraying or aerial spraying" but
the way in which the program

had been handled. He indicated
that Senator O'Keefe had pro
tested the lack of local citizen
and local public official input
into the direction and man
agement of the Medfly project.
While O'Keefe's first concern
was with "guarantees of the
public health and safety," Katz
said, the Senator was not neces
sarily against aerial spraying.
Assemblyman Byron Sher said
he advocated the use of aerial
spraying "only as a last resort."

stayed through the 4V2-hour
meeting to hear the Council's
discussion of the Medfly situ
ation.
Probably the most effective
demonstration occurred at the
Medfly Technical Review Com
mittee meeting July 7. Stanford
students, spouses, and children
wore protest signs and ex
pressed vocally their opinions in
an attempt to dissuade the com
mittee from pursuing aerial
spraying.
Students also carried out a
telephone campaign, contacting
State Assemblymen and Sena
tors, Brown, and President
Donald Kennedy.
Their phone calls were gener
ally received graciously, al
though by mid-afternoon last
Tuesday, the governor's office
would only accept votes cast in
favor of or against the spraying.
Students who phoned Brown's
office earlier in the day said
they had been able to speak to
aides and to express their com
ments and the nature of their
dissent against the spraying. By
Tuesday afternoon, Brown had
phoned the Medfly Project
Committee and asked them to
postpone their decision until he
could speak to them the next
day.
On Wednesday, Brown an
nounced he would not consider
aerial spraying at this time be
cause of the potential dangers to

and vegetables in the state.
Brown reversed his decision.
While some of the other
elected officials who were
phoned said they were opposed
to the use of aerial spraying
now, others were unwilling to
take a stand.
Ron Katz, aide to Senator Dan
O'Keefe, for example, said that
the issue was "not ground
spraying or aerial spraying" but
the way in which the program

had been handled. He indicated
that Senator O'Keefe had pro
tested the lack of local citizen
and local public official input
into the direction and man
agement of the Medfly project.
While O'Keefe's first concern
was with "guarantees of the
public health and safety," Katz
said, the Senator was not neces
sarily against aerial spraying.
Assemblyman Byron Sher said
he advocated the use of aerial
spraying "only as a last resort."
"Warning! This may be im
portant to your safety!" This
statement headlined a flyer
which was recently distributed
to residents of Escondido Vil
lage by a group of concerned
students. The flyer and ar
ranged courtyard meetings gen
erated considerable local public
interest in the alleged dangers
of aerial spraying of malathion.
Many students and their fami
lies were led to openly protest
the spraying, which is part of
the plan to eradicate the Medi
terranean fruit fly in the Santa
Clara Valley.
Barbara and Mike Hecht and
Susan Shepherd, graduate stu
dents in linguistics, organized
meetings and distributed writ
ten information. Barbara Hecht
said that the reaction of stu
dents was one of "concern and

total outrage." Many individ
uals began making plans to
leave the area during the
spraying periods, if at all pos
sible.
Students were warned that
potential dangers posed to hu
man health include birth de
fects, fetal malformations,
spontaneous abortions, cancer
and infertility, according to two
University pharmacologists.
Allen McGrath, a physician in
Los Gatos, stated that the risk is
particularly great for children
and the elderly, whose livers
may not be able to metabolize
the substance adequately. Oth
ers in a high-risk category in
clude persons suffering from
respiratory conditions such as
bronchitis, asthma and em
physema, or who have heart ail
ments, he said.
While the reaction against

aerial spraying may seem like
hysteria to some, others felt
that simply not enough was
known about the effects of
malathion to warrant such ac
tion at this time. Sumner
Kalman and Helen Blau, phar
macologists here, both in
dicated that extensive studies
should be conducted before any
large-scale spraying program
was undertaken.
"No such study has ever been
done with malathion, and I think
it would be unconscionable not
to carry out this type of survey
now," said Kalman.
While the various local city
councils have called repeatedly
for an environmental impact
study to be prepared prior to
aerial spraying of the area,
state officials claim that the
Medfly problem is an emer
gency which warrants waiving

the usual requirement of such a
study. Students reacted to calls
for health and environmental
studies and to indications by
Jerry Scribner, director of the
Medfly Project, that no clear in
formation is available on poten
tial hazards by campaigning
against aerial spraying at least
until such studies could be con
ducted.
Pregnant women and Stan
ford families 'with small chil
dren felt that they had been
placed in a powerless position.
Medfly project officials warned
that children should not touch,
ingest, or play on surfaces
sprayed with malathion, yet the
spraying will occur every six to
10 days for about 75 days.
Scribner said the chemical
would be toxic for 14 days. The
flyer distributed on campus
stated "malathion can be in
gested, absorbed through the
skin, as well as inhaled. Make
absolutely certain that young
children don't put anything in
their mouths that might have
been sprayed. Don't let them
play in the sand or on play equip
ment. Hose off any outside toys,
equipment, cars and bicycles."
Stanford students with young
children felt it would be im
possible to keep children in
doors and out of danger for the
two to three summer months
during which the spraying
would be conducted. The alter
native of leaving the area was
simply not available to many
students and spouses who attend
summer classes or hold jobs.
Project officials also reported
possibilities of damage to paint
on cars. As the number of poten
tial hazards and forms of dam
age grew, Stanford residents
began to protest formally.
Many people attended meet
ings, made phone calls, and
demonstrated actively against
the use of aerial spraying in our
area. Students flocked in num
bers to the Mountain View/Los
Altos City Council meeting and
to the Palo Alto City Council
meeting July 6.

Scribner presented the facts
of the planned program at the
meeting in Mountain View, and
the information was then re
layed to the Palo Alto meeting
The Palo Alto City Council
unanimously resolved to fight
aerial spraying through the le
gal system, taking it to the Unit

Jerry Brown personally as well
