## Larry Ausubel Draft leak timed to minimize protest 
### 
Have you noticed how many
draft-related news items have
appeared in the press since mid-
June? In the past three weeks
I've counted six, considerably
more than I had seen in the en
tire half-year period from Janu
ary to June.
Included among these items:
the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
the current (all-male) draft reg
istration law; the Selective Ser
vice System mailed out its first
batch of letters warning non
registrants of prosecution; the

Army leaked a secret memo
randum concluding that mili
tary manpower needs will re
quire a "significant augmenta
tion to the Volunteer Concept"
(i.e., a draft); and the Reagan
administration formed a high
level task force which officials
acknowledged could lead to the
recommendation of a draft.
But while the sheer concen
tration of these ominous hap
penings since June is certainly
startling, it should not come as a
complete surprise.

The timing of this latest round
of draft-related announcements
and events fits into a broad pat
tern which the Carter adminis
tration initiated and the Reagan
administration is continuing.
Government policymakers,
seeking to avoid the sharp dis
plays of student dissent which
frequently accompany draft
legislation and military adven
turism, are acting at times
when students are mostly not
congregated together.
It is hardly coincidental that
after enacting draft regis
tration last year, the govern
ment scheduled the mass regis
tration period for 19- and 20-
year-old men during late July
and early August - flat in the
middle of summer vacation.
Nor is it accidental that the reg
istration period for men born in
1962 was held in the first week of
January, when the nation's stu
dents were on winter recess or
just in the process of returning
to school.
So it is in the same spirit of
stifling student dissent that the
government chose mid-June as
the starting point for a plethora
of announcements suggesting
the inevitability of the onset bf a
draft.
Just about any of the recent
draft items would have
prompted a chorus of outcries
from the nation's colleges, and
certainly the complete collec
tion of announcements would
have drawn a bitter reaction.
Not so during the summer, gov
ernment officials rightly rea
soned, since the bulk of students
have scattered to their respec
tive homes.
The officials wished to avoid a
recurrence of what had hap
pened in the winter and spring of
1980, when a resurgence of stu
dent demonstrations followed
Carter's call for a resumption of
draft registration. Thousands of

students staged rallies on their
college campuses, and Washing
ton, D.C. was host to the largest
rally since Vietnam days.
Moreover, the officials re
membered the Vietnam War,
when massive demonstrations
in large part had forced the gov
ernment to end the unpopular in
tervention. Government of
ficials learn from experience.
This is not to necessarily sug
gest that the government lead
ership will push for the enact
ment of a draft bill before school
resumes in September. While
that does remain a real possi
bility, officials more than likely
will wait until next summer for
that. The top military brass
have come out strongly in favor
of resuming the draft and Con
gressional leaders are fairly re
ceptive to the idea, but the Rea
gan administration still appears
to be split on the issue of con
scription.
In any case, there do remain
some hopeful signs. At many
campuses, activist groups are
continuing to meet and act, de
spite the summer lull.
And in coming days, San
Francisco and several other
American cities will be the sites
of large demonstrations against
intervention in Central America
and against a military buildup
at home.
It is true that government of
ficials have learned much from
the past, and are today seeking
to prevent the recurrence of
demonstrations against their
military policies.
But we the people have
learned a more important les
son: the tragic consequences of
a draft in the hands of a govern
ment prone to foreign adven
turism; and our ability to stop
it.

to school.
So it is in the same spirit of
stifling student dissent that the
government chose mid-June as
the starting point for a plethora
of announcements suggesting
the inevitability of the onset bf a
draft.
Just about any of the recent
draft items would have
prompted a chorus of outcries
from the nation's colleges, and
certainly the complete collec
tion of announcements would
have drawn a bitter reaction.
Not so during the summer, gov
ernment officials rightly rea
soned, since the bulk of students
have scattered to their respec
tive homes.
The officials wished to avoid a
recurrence of what had hap
pened in the winter and spring of
1980, when a resurgence of stu
dent demonstrations followed
Carter's call for a resumption of
draft registration. Thousands of

students staged rallies on their
college campuses, and Washing
ton, D.C. was host to the largest
rally since Vietnam days.
Moreover, the officials re
membered the Vietnam War,
when massive demonstrations
in large part had forced the gov
ernment to end the unpopular in
tervention. Government of
ficials learn from experience.
This is not to necessarily sug
gest that the government lead
ership will push for the enact
ment of a draft bill before school
resumes in September. While
that does remain a real possi
bility, officials more than likely
will wait until next summer for
that. The top military brass
have come out strongly in favor
of resuming the draft and Con
gressional leaders are fairly re
ceptive to the idea, but the Rea
gan administration still appears
to be split on the issue of con
scription.
In any case, there do remain
some hopeful signs. At many
campuses, activist groups are
continuing to meet and act, de
spite the summer lull.
And in coming days, San
Francisco and several other
American cities will be the sites
of large demonstrations against
intervention in Central America
and against a military buildup
at home.
It is true that government of
ficials have learned much from
the past, and are today seeking
to prevent the recurrence of
demonstrations against their
military policies.
But we the people have
learned a more important les
son: the tragic consequences of
a draft in the hands of a govern
ment prone to foreign adven
turism; and our ability to stop
it.
