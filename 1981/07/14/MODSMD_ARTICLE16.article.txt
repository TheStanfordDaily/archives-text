Don't help murder
Although the war in El Salvador
is no longer front-page news it
continues relentlessly — in two
forms. Government troops
equipped with U.S. helicopter
gunships, fighter jets, and artil
lery are ravaging the coun
tryside, hunting for guerrillas
but slaughtering peasants.
Menawhile, right-wing forces
continue to torture and murder
Salvadoran citizens, seemingly
at random.
Almost daily the press re
ports the discovery of new vic
tims, their bodies mutilated.
Often they are teenagers; many
are hospital workers. In early
July, 28 peasants were
massacred in cold blood and
buried in a mass grave, while
army troops looked on. It was
not the first such massacre; the
death toll of Salvadorans is now
22,000.
The military junta that rules
El Salvador has financed its
bloody crimes with nearly $200
million in military and econom
ic aid from the United States.
But that amount has not been
enough to wipe out the opposi
tion. Now the U.S. ambassador
to El Salvador, Deane Hinton,
has announced that he will re
quest even more funds to equip
and train El Salvador's army.
Two Congressional commit
tees voted last April to cut off
military aid to El Salvador un
less President Ronald Reagan
could certify that its govern
ment "is achieving substantial
control over its armed forces, so
as to end the indiscriminate tor
ture and murder of its own
citizens by these forces . . .
Obviously the Reagan admin
istration has made no attempt
to demand compliance with this

condition. In any case, such a
demand would be fruitless,
since the Salvadoran govern
ment itself is complicit in the
terror.
The former ambassador to El
Salvador, Robert White, recent
ly revealed evidence showing
that the murder of four Ameri
can church workers last winter
was authorized by the highest
military authorities. So far no
official has dared to prosecute
the suspects.
The atrocities committed by
the government of El Salvador
have only increased since the
Congressional action. Sending
more assistance of any kind to
the junta would at this point
make the United States directly
responsible for the torture and
murder of innocent people.
The Reagan administration
clearly has no conscience when
it comes to human rights. Con
sequently the rest of us must act
for him in demanding that Con
gress refuse all future aid to El
Salvador and end U.S. involve
ment in the deliberate torment
of El Salvador's people.

Light a candle
The feeling I got when I read
the Editor's note (Daily, July
10) was that it was an attempted
"put-down" by a pseudo in
tellect. I hope that was not the
intent.
In any case, let me say that I
think you missed the point in
each of the complaints; namely,
to do something like dragging
even a dead puppy behind a car
is not normal, desirable behav
ior. We all know that there real
ly are sick minds that will read
this sort of action (even though
it may be tongue-in-cheek) and
go out and commit a similar or
more heinous act!
I resent your bringing gun
control and Guatemala into the
response. That is a different
matter. Are we supposed to only
concern ourselves with the
"biggies?" If we have no com
passion for ANY animal (even if
it cannot tell us in our language
of its pain), then how can we by
sympathetic to the suffering of
fellow human beings whether
they are in Guatemala or they
are being gunned down here in
the United States!
I think I understand what you
are saying when you say
Gun control, the arms race and
Guatemala ... do not seem to
draw the same brand of right
eous opprobrium from the
readers ..." I'm sure we are
all just as concerned, whether
pro or con, about each issue.
I cannot police the entire
earth — neither can the United
States. I do not have the time,
energy, nor the money to do that
— neither does the United
States. "To light just one little
candle" means to begin with the
smallest, most insignificant (to
some people) actions.

The editor of the opinions
page receives a pile of letters
expressing outrage at what he
terms "Achenbach's harmless,
if peurile piece" (Daily, July
10), yet rather than sense the
outrage over his own poor edito
rial judgement, he bemoans
only that other more germane
opinions lack such energetic and
concerned readership.
You miss the point. The Daily
readers are saying that Achen
bach's column is at least one
source of "vile thoughts and dis
gusting behavior" which can be
trivially eradicated. Your own
misreading of the writing on
this wall bespeaks your juve
nility.
