## Give cuts a chance — jobs foster self-respect 
### 
There is a lot of talk going
around Washington today about
the ominous effects of Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's proposed
cuts in welfare programs and
proposed tax breaks for busi
ness. Progressive Senators and
Representatives argue that
our cities are in desperate need
of social programs in order to
lift urban citizens from poverty
and despair. Reducing funds in
welfare programs, they con
tend, will only aggravate the
current situation. Is the
progressive view an accurate
assessment of Reagan's pro

gram?
The proponents of increasing
welfare programs take the posi
tion that such programs offer
deprived citizens in our cities an
opportunity to raise them
selves. Undoubtedly many peo
ple have indeed benefited from
such programs. But such a posi
tion must be looked at in terms
of its overall implications.
The advocates of social pro
grams also argue that basic hu
man needs such as food, shelter
and medical care should be met
by the government. Certainly
every citizen has a right to such

necessities. Our founding
fathers probably bit off a little
more than they could chew,
however, when they said in the
preamble to our constitution:
"(government should) provide
for the general welfare." I
would argue that the general
welfare of the American people
is best provided by jobs and em
ployment opportunities.
Creating these employment
opportunities is the point of the
Reagan administration's tax
cuts. These tax cuts will serve
as an incentive for business to

engage in real investment, in
vestment meaning new con
struction and re-juvenation of
old facilities, not just the simple
transaction of stocks or secur
ities.
Funds from businesses that
normally would have gone to
Washington in the form of tax
payments will now be in the
hands of the local busi
nessperson. As a result, the se
quence of paying taxes to Wash
ington and Washington paying
money to social programs into
the cities will be reduced. Who
knows how much of this money

is lost or mis-handled within the
giant Washington bureaucracy.
A tax break for business means
less revenue will have to make
the inefficient trip from busi
ness to Washington back to the
community.
It is true that in recent years
industries have not been invest
ing within our major cities. To
reverse this trend, Reagan
should include in his tax pro
posals special provisions that
would make business invest
ment more attractive within our
cities. This could be done by al
lowing industries that are com
mitted to investing within our
cities faster depreciation time
scales and allowances.
Regardless of whether Rea
gan actually makes such pro
visions in his tax proposals,
greater employment op
portunities are sure to result be
cause of his program. Busi
nesses will demand labor to
meet their construction obliga
tions. And with the onset of
more jobs, a positive sequence
of events will occur. More peo
ple having jobs means less peo
ple dependent on welfare pro
grams and assistance. People
who are employed generally en
joy a greater sense of responsi
bility and accomplishment than
those who are reliant upon wel
fare payments.
Essentially, the Reagan ap
proach to the problems suffered
by our cities can be seen as a
shift from increasing welfare
programs to increasing em
ployment opportunities. We
must give his program a
chance. I think Mayor Pete
Wilson of San Diego summed it
up best in a recent address to the
Commonwealth club in San
Francisco: "The best social
program ever devised by man is
a job — a job in the private sec
tor."
