## Low but unstable oil prices benefit no one 
### 
We have learned in this
modern age that the old adage
that what goes up has to come
down does not apply to space
rockets or prices. Yet even in in
flationary times, if market
forces operate, prices may drop
or even collapse. This is espe
cially true of raw materials.
Prices of copper, silver, cocoa,
sugar, and many other com
modities have fallen to half or
less of their historic highs in the
past year or so.
Now the price of the biggest
item in international trade,
crude oil, has fallen on spot
markets by about 20 percent and
may tumble drastically.
The countries of OPEC from
the end of 1973 until recently
have been in the happy condition
that the less they produced the
more money they took in. They
have had the good luck of the
Iranian revolution, which vir
tually removed that major ex
porter, and the Iraqi-Iranian
war, which nearly removed Iraq
also.
But OPEC pushed prices to
the point that consumers began
seriously conserving energy, of
turning to substitutes, and de
mand fell off. At the same time,
it has become even more dif
ficult for the producers to sus
tain prices by cutting produc
tion because their spending hab
its and plans become continual
ly bigger and their surpluses
shrink. Several major petrole
um exporters, such as Venezue
la, Mexico, Nigeria, and Indo
nesia, have problems with their
balance of payments and are

hence under pressure to export
more.
But whereas previously ex
porting less brought in more
money, now exporting more
brings in less. Unless they can
manage to allocate production
— and OPEC has never been
able to do anything except raise
prices — they may have slid
from the happy up escalator to
the unhappy down escalator.
Unhappy, that is for them.
For us, it sounds like a relief
from a multitude of woes if the
price of petroleum sinks. But we
should consider the conse
quences if it should go to $20 or
conceivably $10 per barrel —
still about five times the price
before the merry ride began.
The utilities that have con
verted from oil to coal would
have to reconvert, or lose a
great deal of money. Depression
could stalk the coalfields.
Gasohol would be a lost cause.
Geothermal energy would cease
to be economic. Solar energy
would languish, and solar heat
ing would for the most part be
come extravagantly expensive.

Cities would lament having in
stalled plants to burn trash to
generate power.
It is a good bet that cheap gas
oline would rather quickly
tempt Americans back to their
love affair with the big car. De
troit, having nearly gone
bankrupt retooling to make fuel
efficient vehicles, would have to
turn around to retool again to
make more of the thirsty
dinosaurs, leaving the industry
in a state of near collapse.
The oil companies have
started up much high-cost pro
duction in the central part of the
United States, in deep water off
shore, and in Alaska, all of
which would lose a lot of money
if the price of oil dropped great
ly-
Perhaps the situation could
be more or less saved by re
stricting imports, but this would
be an unpleasant solution. It
would require Americans to pay
prices for petroleum products
much higher than the world
level in order to subsidize the
rapid consumption of the na
tional petroleum resources.

It seems quite probable that
petroleum prices, once set by a
corporate oligarchy, and then
by OPEC, have entered a time
of unfortunate instability. Oil is
not fundamentally different
from other commodities; unless
it can be effectively cartelized,
it may become somewhat like
wheat, producers of which pro
duce more to earn more, there
by contributing to oversupplv
and reducing prices.
But whereas gyrations of the
prices of wheat are hard on a
small minority, great instabili
ty of the price of the world's big
gest energy source is hard on
the world economy in many
ways, making difficult a wide
range of economic calculations
beyond those mentioned here.
It is probably time for the
United States to think of joining
OPEC to help keep up prices.
More seriously, it is or soon
will be time for consuming and
producing nations to get togeth
er to keep petroleum prices sta
bilized for the general benefit.

cially true of raw materials.
Prices of copper, silver, cocoa,
sugar, and many other com
modities have fallen to half or
less of their historic highs in the
past year or so.
Now the price of the biggest
item in international trade,
crude oil, has fallen on spot
markets by about 20 percent and
may tumble drastically.
The countries of OPEC from
the end of 1973 until recently
have been in the happy condition
that the less they produced the
more money they took in. They
have had the good luck of the
Iranian revolution, which vir
tually removed that major ex
porter, and the Iraqi-Iranian
war, which nearly removed Iraq
also.
But OPEC pushed prices to
the point that consumers began
seriously conserving energy, of
turning to substitutes, and de
mand fell off. At the same time,
it has become even more dif
ficult for the producers to sus
tain prices by cutting produc
tion because their spending hab
its and plans become continual
ly bigger and their surpluses
shrink. Several major petrole
um exporters, such as Venezue
la, Mexico, Nigeria, and Indo
nesia, have problems with their
balance of payments and are

hence under pressure to export
more.
But whereas previously ex
porting less brought in more
money, now exporting more
brings in less. Unless they can
manage to allocate production
— and OPEC has never been
able to do anything except raise
prices — they may have slid
from the happy up escalator to
the unhappy down escalator.
Unhappy, that is for them.
For us, it sounds like a relief
from a multitude of woes if the
price of petroleum sinks. But we
should consider the conse
quences if it should go to $20 or
conceivably $10 per barrel —
still about five times the price
before the merry ride began.
The utilities that have con
verted from oil to coal would
have to reconvert, or lose a
great deal of money. Depression
could stalk the coalfields.
Gasohol would be a lost cause.
Geothermal energy would cease
to be economic. Solar energy
would languish, and solar heat
ing would for the most part be
come extravagantly expensive.

Cities would lament having in
stalled plants to burn trash to
generate power.
It is a good bet that cheap gas
oline would rather quickly
tempt Americans back to their
love affair with the big car. De
troit, having nearly gone
bankrupt retooling to make fuel
efficient vehicles, would have to
turn around to retool again to
make more of the thirsty
dinosaurs, leaving the industry
in a state of near collapse.
The oil companies have
started up much high-cost pro
duction in the central part of the
United States, in deep water off
shore, and in Alaska, all of
which would lose a lot of money
if the price of oil dropped great
ly-
Perhaps the situation could
be more or less saved by re
stricting imports, but this would
be an unpleasant solution. It
would require Americans to pay
prices for petroleum products
much higher than the world
level in order to subsidize the
rapid consumption of the na
tional petroleum resources.

It seems quite probable that
petroleum prices, once set by a
corporate oligarchy, and then
by OPEC, have entered a time
of unfortunate instability. Oil is
not fundamentally different
from other commodities; unless
it can be effectively cartelized,
it may become somewhat like
wheat, producers of which pro
duce more to earn more, there
by contributing to oversupplv
and reducing prices.
But whereas gyrations of the
prices of wheat are hard on a
small minority, great instabili
ty of the price of the world's big
gest energy source is hard on
the world economy in many
ways, making difficult a wide
range of economic calculations
beyond those mentioned here.
It is probably time for the
United States to think of joining
OPEC to help keep up prices.
More seriously, it is or soon
will be time for consuming and
producing nations to get togeth
er to keep petroleum prices sta
bilized for the general benefit.
