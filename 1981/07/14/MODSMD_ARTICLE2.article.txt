# Stanford spared from spraying, but it's still a possibility here

Stanford and north Palo Alto
weren't aerially sprayed with
malathion early this morning
because no Medfly larvae have
been found here yet.
Dr. Irene Brown, formerly a
lecturer in Human Biology and a
researcher at Jasper Ridge,
said it makes biological sense
that no larvae have been dis
covered here, because the Medf
ly will go to where it has the
most things to eat. Los Altos
Hills and the area further south
used to be orchards, and have a

much higher proportion of fruit
trees than in north Palo Alto.
The Medfly's attraction to that
area can be seen in the larvae
discoveries plotted on maps
which the Medfly project people
used to plan the aerial spraying.

According to Brown, two
fugitive larvae deposits were
discovered in Redwood City
and Redwood City, but
biologists and State Agriculture
Department officials agree that

ground spraying will sufficient
ly eradicate them. The aerial
spraying is aimed at the largest
concentrations of Medfly larvae
discovered to date.
Whether Stanford and north
Palo Alto will remain out of the
aerial spraying range depends
on how many, if any, larvae are
discovered here. With 5000 traps
along the Peninsula, the Medfly
Project people are continually
watching the larvae pattern,
and can change the aerial spray
targets at any time.
