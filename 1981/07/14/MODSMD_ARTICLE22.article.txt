# 'La Mancha' aspires beyond community theatre but fails
## 
### Tony Kelly 
Community theatre has always had an air of
paradoxical ambition about it, combining a tradi
tional desire for professionalism with an ob
sessive quest not to offend anyone by being too
bold. Quite a bit like dormitory food service, ex
cept you don't show a meal card. Within these lim
its, Theatreworks' current version of Man of la
Mancha at the Lucie Stern Center in Palo Alto is a
fine presentation, well worth an evenings' time.
Obviously, Palo Alto's Theatreworks organiza
tion is aching to escape the "community theatre"
label that condemns many Peninsula groups to
permanent cult status and a misspelled entry in
Bay Area Events.
In addition to the lengthy subscription ad in the
program, Director Robert Kelley walked onstage
before the play to further push contributions to
Theatreworks and parenthetically mentioned
that Man of la Mancha is his favorite musical.
Hooray for incidental information, three cheers

for overkill. All this selling of the program to an
already sold-out crowd seemed not only redun
dant, but even a little self-congratulatory for a
show about to begin.
When the cast of la Mancha took the stage,
though, the selling began in earnest, with the show
suffering as a result. I have never seen a produc
tion of Man of la Mancha before, but watching
this one gave me a distinct case of deja vu — it
looks like a re-creation of a Broadway production,
whether or not it actually is one. Very smooth,
very flashy, very slick — it was a surprise that the
cast didn't slide right off the stage into the au
dience.
John Ingram's portrayal of Miguel de
Cervantes/ Don Quixote, partially because of his
high visibility onstage, falls deepest into this trap.
Ingram plays Quixote as a modern showman, act
ing as a knight in an enervating pastime. But he
certainly doesn't carry himself as a knight, real or
otherwise.
What we see is a modern actor, with modern
manners and posture, telling us he is a 16th cen
tury gentleman. As a result, the Don Quixote that
emerges is not the heroic Man of la Mancha, but
something more closely resembling the kid down
the block your parents liked more than you: "Why
can't you be more like that nice Quixote boy next
door?"
If there's any heroism in this Quixote, the au
dience has to imagine it.
Lesser examples of the same flaws abound
elsewhere in the production — an overacted scene

here, a drop in concentration there, too much
makeup everywhere. In each case, despite the
seeming intention of director Kelley and
Theatreworks to present the musical as straight
forwardly as possible, the audience has to work to
glean anything useful out of all the production val
ues.
An audience to a professional production
shouldn't have to work that hard to believe a per
formance. There is a commmunication gap that
Theatreworks has to bridge in their own quest
toward dramatic legitimacy.
At the same time, to be that close to getting out
of "community theatre" is an achievement in
itself. Man of la Mancha serves far better to
prove how far Theatreworks has progressed than
how far they have to go. In terms of design, the
musical is outstanding — B.J. Fredrickson's set
depicting a prison of the Spanish Inquisition is
both functional and aesthetically worthwhile — a
surprisingly rare combination in musicals.

Dominated in the center by a large tower and
drawbridge, the construction shows unusual
depth as the musical progresses, refuting the in
itial worries about sight lines and acoustics pre
sented by such an obstacle. John Rathman's
muted lighting design shows off the scene strik
ingly, though some indiscreet uses of spotlights
fail to serve the actors as well.
The orchestra, conducted by musical director
Vern Older, supplied the play with some fine mo
ments at badly needed intervals, especially in its
creative uses of volume at appropriate times. The
same is not the case for the choreography by
Diane Silven — or rather the lack of choreo
graphy. Characters seem to move out of rest
lessness onstage, not out of desire or logic.
Above all, the presentation of Man of la Man
cha is just that — a presentation. Theatreworks
isn't out to change anyone's preconceptions about
theatre, musicals, or Don Quixote — the sole
purpose is to entertain a community as pro
fessionally as possible in a local atmosphere. That
is community theatre in a nutshell, and Man of la
Mancha succeeds easily on a community theatre
level.
Getting past that state, though, demands more
than just high hopes and ambitions of bringing a
little bit of Broadway to Palo Alto. Until that fact
is realized and more originality is encouraged
over slick production values, Theatreworks will
have to labor under its present ill-fitting yoke as
the dramatic equivalent of food

Diane Silven — or rather the lack of choreo
graphy. Characters seem to move out of rest
lessness onstage, not out of desire or logic.
Above all, the presentation of Man of la Man
cha is just that — a presentation. Theatreworks
isn't out to change anyone's preconceptions about
theatre, musicals, or Don Quixote — the sole
purpose is to entertain a community as pro
fessionally as possible in a local atmosphere. That
is community theatre in a nutshell, and Man of la
Mancha succeeds easily on a community theatre
level.
Getting past that state, though, demands more
than just high hopes and ambitions of bringing a

the dramatic equivalent of food

Community theatre has always had an air of
paradoxical ambition about it, combining a tradi
tional desire for professionalism with an ob
sessive quest not to offend anyone by being too
bold. Quite a bit like dormitory food service, ex
cept you don't show a meal card. Within these lim
its, Theatreworks' current version of Man of la
Mancha at the Lucie Stern Center in Palo Alto is a
fine presentation, well worth an evenings' time.
Obviously, Palo Alto's Theatreworks organiza
tion is aching to escape the "community theatre"
label that condemns many Peninsula groups to
permanent cult status and a misspelled entry in
Bay Area Events.
In addition to the lengthy subscription ad in the
program, Director Robert Kelley walked onstage
before the play to further push contributions to
Theatreworks and parenthetically mentioned
that Man of la Mancha is his favorite musical.
Hooray for incidental information, three cheers

for overkill. All this selling of the program to an
already sold-out crowd seemed not only redun
dant, but even a little self-congratulatory for a
show about to begin.
When the cast of la Mancha took the stage,
though, the selling began in earnest, with the show
suffering as a result. I have never seen a produc
tion of Man of la Mancha before, but watching
this one gave me a distinct case of deja vu — it
looks like a re-creation of a Broadway production,
whether or not it actually is one. Very smooth,
very flashy, very slick — it was a surprise that the
cast didn't slide right off the stage into the au
dience.
John Ingram's portrayal of Miguel de
Cervantes/ Don Quixote, partially because of his
high visibility onstage, falls deepest into this trap.
Ingram plays Quixote as a modern showman, act
ing as a knight in an enervating pastime. But he
certainly doesn't carry himself as a knight, real or
otherwise.
What we see is a modern actor, with modern
manners and posture, telling us he is a 16th cen
tury gentleman. As a result, the Don Quixote that
emerges is not the heroic Man of la Mancha, but
something more closely resembling the kid down
the block your parents liked more than you: "Why
can't you be more like that nice Quixote boy next
door?"
If there's any heroism in this Quixote, the au
dience has to imagine it.
Lesser examples of the same flaws abound
elsewhere in the production — an overacted scene

here, a drop in concentration there, too much
makeup everywhere. In each case, despite the
seeming intention of director Kelley and
Theatreworks to present the musical as straight
forwardly as possible, the audience has to work to
glean anything useful out of all the production val
ues.
An audience to a professional production
shouldn't have to work that hard to believe a per
formance. There is a commmunication gap that
Theatreworks has to bridge in their own quest
toward dramatic legitimacy.
At the same time, to be that close to getting out
of "community theatre" is an achievement in
itself. Man of la Mancha serves far better to
prove how far Theatreworks has progressed than
how far they have to go. In terms of design, the
musical is outstanding — B.J. Fredrickson's set
depicting a prison of the Spanish Inquisition is
both functional and aesthetically worthwhile — a
surprisingly rare combination in musicals.

Dominated in the center by a large tower and
drawbridge, the construction shows unusual
depth as the musical progresses, refuting the in
itial worries about sight lines and acoustics pre
sented by such an obstacle. John Rathman's
muted lighting design shows off the scene strik
ingly, though some indiscreet uses of spotlights
fail to serve the actors as well.
The orchestra, conducted by musical director
Vern Older, supplied the play with some fine mo
ments at badly needed intervals, especially in its
creative uses of volume at appropriate times. The
same is not the case for the choreography by
Diane Silven — or rather the lack of choreo
graphy. Characters seem to move out of rest
lessness onstage, not out of desire or logic.
