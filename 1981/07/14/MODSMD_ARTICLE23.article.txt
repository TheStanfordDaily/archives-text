# A
						hilarious 'Sexual Perversity' at the Bedini Theatre
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
You have only one more
weekend to see Bedini Theatre's
production of David Mamet's
one act Sexual Perversity in
Chicago. The Bedini theatre
looks like an unlikely place to go
for an excellent performance.
First it is located on Balboa and
41st Ave. in San Francisco — an
unlikely location in an empty
residential area.
If it had not been for the rath
er seductive photograph that ar
rived in the mail I may not have
gone myself.
The building can hardly be
called a theatre. There is a sky
light right above the audience
and first five rows of seats are
covered with what looks like
huge plastic garbage bags. The
curtain has several holes in it
and the actors have to walk
through the audience to leave.
The Bedini Theatre should
learn from the more established
companies and improve their
packaging — just seeing the
theatre makes you expect a low
quality performance.
On the night when I saw the
production there were only
about fifteen people in the au
dience. It is a pity that these
small productions often get
completely ignored by the press
as this one has been, according
to one of the actors.
Perhaps the problem is with

the uneven quality. Bedini's
double bill is a perfect example
— after the first few lines of
Why Hanna's Skirt Won't Stay
Down by Tom Eyen I was very
tempted to walk out. Just to give
you an idea of what the play is
about the program gives the
time that the action takes place
at "Five minutes to seven. Yes
terday, today, but hopefully not
tomorrow."
Hanna's Skirt is set in the fun
waxhouse on Coney Island. Han
na, the main character — the
one that almost made me leave
after the first couple of minutes
of her fast paced delivery — has
a job standing over a "breeze
hole" — one of those air jets that
lift young ladies skirts at faires.
The play is yet another ex
ploration of empty relationships
and existential mishmash. Han
na is from Springfield, Illinois.
She goes to the big city out of
boredom and invariably falls in
love with men from Arizona.
She ends up with one abor
tion after another. . .
if there is a point to the play it
is beyond this reviewer. But
Joanne Sullivan who starts of
being so obnoxious grows into
the part of Hanna and so it is
worth sitting through if only in
anticipation of the second half
of the evening.
Sexual Perversity in Chicago
deals with relationships on a

much higher plane. The story is
about a young romance between
Deborah and Dan that turns
sour because the characters
cannot escape the stereotypes
drummed into them by their
best friends.
Dan's best friend Bernie is a
jaded "cool" guy out to hunt
"broads." He has a very cynical
view of the opposite sex — a
quality he shares with Debora's
roomate and best friend Joan —
Joan mistrusts all men.
When Deborah and Dan fall in
love both friends become
jealous. They independently
give Dan and Deborah's rela
tionship anywhere from two
weeks to a month, and they are
right. Deborah and Dan fail to

understand each other and so
their relationship falls apart.
Dan and Bernie end up on the
beach together watching "tits
and ass" and making com
ments. Dan has transformed
himself from an innocent babe
to another Bernie.
If you find this kind of lan
guage offensive you shouldn't.
There is nothing offensive about
it. It's just that Bernie never
quite managed to grow up. To
him this kind of language means
power (shades of Watergate
perhaps?).
The play is very tight and in
novative — Mamet managed to
squeeze 34 scenes into a one act
some of them do not consist of
more than a couple of lines of

dialogue which are very effec
tive in explaining the charac
ters. The only problem with this
method is that you can get a lit
tle disoriented if you don't fol
low the program and keep a
track of the scenes.
Bernie, played by Craig
Leland, with his inner-city ac
cent and white suit looks like a
cock examining his hens when
he walks into a single's bar. But
as he paces carefully inhaling
the smoke from his cigaret,
looking to impress and waiting
for the appropriate moment to
make his move, chinks appear
in his macho image. Bemie's
cigaret drops on the floor and
the young lady of his choosing
refuses to be impressed by his
made up story of being "a
meteorologist for TWA." In
fact, both Bernie and Dan work
in an office pushing paper.
Only superlatives can be used
for the performance of the rest
of the cast: Russell Smith fits
the role of the shy but growing
up-fast Dan, equally good are
Karen Cole as Deborah and
Randi Merzon as Joan.
The production makes good
use of the very limited re
sources available — the bare
minimum of lighting and
scenery.
The production closes after
performances this Friday, Sat
urday and Sunday at 3944
Balboa St. in San Francisco.

Deborah (Karen Cole) is all taken up with Dan (Russel Smith) as his
best friend Bernie (Craig Leland) looks — ehm — on with interest.
