# 'Cafe Trilogy': three brief encounters over cappuccino
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Cafe Trilogy by Deborah
Rogin is a set of three inter-re
lated one-act plays all set in a
North Beach coffee house. The
setting of the Bare Stage in
Berkeley production is simple
and members of the cast are on
stage before the play formally
begins. This prepares the au
dience for a series of casual and
folksy encounters with a few av
erage people who have dropped
in for their afternoon cappuc
cino — much like encounters in
a real coffee house.
But the characters in these
plays aren't easy to get to know.
This makes the first two olays
unsatisfying to watch.
The first play, "A Martyr to
our Times," is a chance meet
ing between two old friends,

Gretchen Dußois and Ralph
White. Gretchen and Ralph
were in high school together,
but have been out of touch since
the Berkeley protests of the late
60s. Gretchen is now a suc
cessful conceptual artist who
sells her all-black canvases to
the Bank of America. Ralph is a
well-paid ad-agency executive
who is mired in all the cliches of
modern therapy.
"They Call Me Death Who
Know Me" is the most serious of
the three plays. In it, Zoe Sim
mons is a Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author whose son has re
cently died. She is being
harassed by Tony Martelli, a
young Italian man who has seen
her on the Dick Cavett show and
who bears some resemblance to
her son.

"Leaving" is a conversation
between two lovers. Jack is an
out-of-work actor preparing for
an audition in a Western play on
its way to Nevada. He has had
some recognition, but is now
trying unsuccessfully to escape
from typecasting. He is also
having an affair with Betty Sim
pson White, Ralph's wife from
the first play. Her familiarity
with wealth and power, thanks
to her father, sets up many bar
riers between them.
The speed and anonymity of
city life has resulted in a special
form of encounter: momentary,
intimate connections between
strangers. Conversations in
buses, pickups in bars, shared
tables in restaurants — these
are all examples of the casual
contacts which help us to build a

sense of community with people
we may never see again.
These encounters all begin in
about the same way, with time
filling questions whose answers
don't really matter. Where do
you live? What's your name?
What do you do for a living? It's
only later that they turn into
something more than a job in
terview. The person you're with
suddenly becomes special when
you find out that he collects both
baseball cards and recordings of
Verdi operas.
The trouble with these one
act plays is that there aren't
enough quirky details about the
people in them. The intimacies
that reveal character are miss
ing. In the first play, for exam
ple, Ralph's mumblings about
his "hostile space" and his
"oral fixation" tell us little
more about him than the suit he
is wearing. And in the second
play, the mention of murder, su
icide, and incest is completely
out of scale — something like
Crime and Punishment re
written as a short story. Details
like these are too extreme for a
one-act play.
The third play is much more

successful because the charac
ter of Jack has considerably
more depth. His nostalgic ram
blings about all the small towns
where the Greyhound buses stop
and the anecdote about him
making faces at the monkeys at
the zoo (to give just two ex
amples) tell us a great deal
about him.
This partially explains why
the performances in the third
play are the most interesting.
Nancy Anderson gives a beau
tifully timed performance as
Betty White, and Harvey Cowen
(as Jack) is good at showing off
the many facets of his role. In
the other plays, the actors have
very little to work with in order
to define their characters.
The idea of one-act plays
based on encounters in a coffee
house is good, but Cafe Trilogy
is not the ideal realization of it.
The writing in general is on too
large a scale for one-act plays,
and it is difficult to relate to the
characters because the au
dience doesn't know enough
about their idiosyncracies.
"Cafe Trilogy" is currently
playing at The Hare Stage, 2320
Dana Street, Berkeley. Call
