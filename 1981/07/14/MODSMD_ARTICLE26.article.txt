Urban violence in Britain persists
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ap
pealed to Britons yesterday to settle their differences
after 10 days of urban violence. Her home secretary
said convicted rioters would be put in army camps if
there was no room for them in Britian's overcrowded
jails. Moments after the Prime Minister issued her
plea for peace, a protestor threw a tomato, narrowly
missing her.
Home Secretary William Whitelaw said he was de
termined to see riot suspects brought swiftly before
magistrates. He said plastic bullets, water cannon and
armored vehicles will be available to the nation's po
lice chiefs if they need them.
Thatcher spoke in Liverpool, scene a week ago of the
bloodiest rioting in the current violence. London and six
other English cities, as well as Dundee, Scotland, were
hit by new disturbances Sunday night.
"We have to try and get over it,"the Prime Minister
told a press conference after meeting with community
leaders at Liverpool City Hall. "We have to pick up the
pieces and build afresh."
The worst of the rioting Sunday night and yesterday
morning was in Leicester, in the English Midlands,
where large groups of shouting youths — police said 300
in all — battled bobbies and looted stores in the city's
predominantly black highfields area.
Five police officers were hurt and 20 rioters ar
rested, police said.
Other outbreaks were reported in the Midlands cities
of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Coventry and Derby;
in West London's Notting Hill district; and in High
Wycombe. 30 miles northwest of the capital.

The rioting in Dundee was the first to break out in
Scotland in the current wave. Sixteen people were ar
rested as youths hurled firebombs at police vehicles
and smashed shop windows.
Fights break out, nationalist dies
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Sniper attacks and
street fights broke out after the death of a sixth Irish
nationalist hunger striker yesterday and an estimated
100,000 Protestants marched throughout Northern Ire
land in an annual, centuries-old show of strength.
Four British soldiers, one policeman and one civilian
were wounded in gun and bomb attacks in Belfast and
Londonderry, the province's second-largest city. None
of the injuries was believed serious.
Security forces quelled the rioting with volleys of
plastic bullets, authorities said, and the violence was
far less intense than the widespread riots that followed
each of the deaths of the other five hunger strikers at
the Maze prison.
Martin Hurson, a 27-year-old Irish Republican Army
guerrilla, died before dawn in the 45 day of his hunger
strike. Britain's Northern Ireland Office said Hurson
"took his own life by refusing food and medical atten
tion."
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, claimed Hurson
was "murdered" and urged the British immediately to
negotiate directly with the prisoners who seek what
amounts to political status for Irish nationalists jailed
in Northern Ireland.
Hurson was sentenced in 1977 to 20 years for
possession of explosives and conspiracy to murder se
curity forces.

Brown admits to fc bad judgment'
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown, facing accusa
tions that his aides attempted to thwart a state probe,
said yesterday he and his staff were "guilty of bad
judgment, mistakes and sloppy practices," in the use of
a state-funded computer system in the governor's of
fice.
But, Brown said "it is clear to me that the state com
puter was never used for campaign-related purposes,
and that no law was violated."
Brown's comments came in the wake of a 149-page
investigative report released Wednesday by the state
Fair Political Practices Commission, accusing aides to
the governor of destroying and altering evidence to im
pede the panel's probe.
The governor characterized charges of coverup on
the part of his staff as "absolutely false — nothing more
than shabby innuendo," and said there was no "de
liberate action by my staff to impede the investigation
or thwart the commission in its work."

Thatcher spoke in Liverpool, scene a week ago of the
bloodiest rioting in the current violence. London and six
other English cities, as well as Dundee, Scotland, were
hit by new disturbances Sunday night.
"We have to try and get over it,"the Prime Minister
told a press conference after meeting with community
leaders at Liverpool City Hall. "We have to pick up the
pieces and build afresh."
The worst of the rioting Sunday night and yesterday
morning was in Leicester, in the English Midlands,
where large groups of shouting youths — police said 300
in all — battled bobbies and looted stores in the city's
predominantly black highfields area.
Five police officers were hurt and 20 rioters ar
rested, police said.
Other outbreaks were reported in the Midlands cities
of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Coventry and Derby;
in West London's Notting Hill district; and in High
Wycombe. 30 miles northwest of the capital.

The rioting in Dundee was the first to break out in
Scotland in the current wave. Sixteen people were ar
rested as youths hurled firebombs at police vehicles
and smashed shop windows.
Fights break out, nationalist dies
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Sniper attacks and
street fights broke out after the death of a sixth Irish
nationalist hunger striker yesterday and an estimated
100,000 Protestants marched throughout Northern Ire
land in an annual, centuries-old show of strength.
Four British soldiers, one policeman and one civilian
were wounded in gun and bomb attacks in Belfast and
Londonderry, the province's second-largest city. None
of the injuries was believed serious.
Security forces quelled the rioting with volleys of
plastic bullets, authorities said, and the violence was
far less intense than the widespread riots that followed
each of the deaths of the other five hunger strikers at
the Maze prison.
Martin Hurson, a 27-year-old Irish Republican Army
guerrilla, died before dawn in the 45 day of his hunger
strike. Britain's Northern Ireland Office said Hurson
"took his own life by refusing food and medical atten
tion."
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, claimed Hurson
was "murdered" and urged the British immediately to
negotiate directly with the prisoners who seek what
amounts to political status for Irish nationalists jailed
in Northern Ireland.
Hurson was sentenced in 1977 to 20 years for
possession of explosives and conspiracy to murder se
curity forces.

Brown admits to fc bad judgment'
Sacramento — Gov. Jerry Brown, facing accusa
tions that his aides attempted to thwart a state probe,
said yesterday he and his staff were "guilty of bad
judgment, mistakes and sloppy practices," in the use of
a state-funded computer system in the governor's of
fice.
But, Brown said "it is clear to me that the state com
puter was never used for campaign-related purposes,
and that no law was violated."
Brown's comments came in the wake of a 149-page
investigative report released Wednesday by the state
Fair Political Practices Commission, accusing aides to
the governor of destroying and altering evidence to im
pede the panel's probe.
The governor characterized charges of coverup on
the part of his staff as "absolutely false — nothing more
than shabby innuendo," and said there was no "de
liberate action by my staff to impede the investigation
or thwart the commission in its work."
