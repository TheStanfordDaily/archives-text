Washington— The Defense Department's
(DOD) secret report to Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, suggesting an increase in the size
of the army, is an indication of the Reagan ad
ministration's recognition of the failure of the
all-volunteer army, according to Rep. Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey, R—Menlo Park, long-time
opponent of the volunteer system.
McCloskey called the report a "floating of
the first trial balloon" of a reinstitution of a
mandatory draft.
The DOD reported that nearly 100,000 more
soldiers would be required if Reagan's pro
posed military strategies are to be carried out,
adding that such a large addition will probably
not be found through "the voluntary concept."
The increase of the army to nearly 870,000 by
fiscal year 1987 is being proposed to meet crisis
situations in the Persian Gulf.
McCloskey feels that the reemergence of
this issue brings to the fore his proposal for a
National Youth Service (NYS), as he claimed
that it is "the only alternative to the draft yet
presented."

The Congressman's proposal would give ev
eryone the choice of serving in the military or
civilian capacity, "granting substantial col
lege benefits to those choosing the more
arduous task."
McCloskey said his plan would offer a solu
tion to the present poor quality of the army, re
placing a force characterized by poverty and a
reading ability around the sixth grade level,
with a "broad cross-section of talented young
Americans."
Larry Ausubel of Stanford Against Conscrip
tion said, "I would agree with Representative
McCloskey that it was a floating of a trial
ballon by pro-draft forces that would like to see
a draft as soon as possible; however, I would
strongly disagree with those who feel that a
draft or mandatory national service is de
sirable at this time. At the root of the issue is
the government's contention that we need a
larger military. We already have armed forces
of more than 2 million men and women. Gov
ernment officials wish to enlarge the military
so that it may be used for foreign adventurism,
not national defense."
