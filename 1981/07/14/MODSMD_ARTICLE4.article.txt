# Residents march, protest malathion
## 
### Karl Schoenberger 
Accusations that the
malathion spraying is
motivated by the economic con
cerns of agri-business and angry
calls for civil disobedience high
lighted a rally held at Rin
conada Park in Palo Alto on
Sunday. More than 200 area resi
dents gathered there /or a
■ Malathion Teach-In" to learn
more about pesticides and pro
test the aerial spraying.
Richard Moore, a computer
programmer who acted as a
"concerned individual" in or
ganizing the teach-in, said that
he was disappointed by the
small turnout.
The decision to hold the teach
in, the result of a spontaneous
effort to coordinate the many
grass roots organizations in the
area that are mobilizing against
aerial spraying, was not made
until Saturday morning, and
most publicity was by word of
mouth.
Speakers ranging from Palo
Alto Mayor Alan Henderson to
activist Bonnie Parke were re
cruited on the spur of the mo
ment to participate, and all
criticized the use of aerial
spraying, claiming that not
enough research has been done

on the health effects of
malathion, that the medfly does
not really pose a threat to Cali
fornia agriculture, and that the
government is acting ir
responsibly.
People took turns speaking
into a microphone in the center
of the crowd, and offered such
ideas as sending telegrams to
President Ronald Reagan,
blockading the supply trucks
loaded with malathion, sleeping
outdoors to dare helicopter pi
lots to spray unsheltered people,
calling in "sick with malathion"
while staying away from work
in protest, putting up tarps to
protect organic gardens, and,on
the humorous side, raising
medflys in "secret fruit fly
farms" to release later in the
Central Valley as retaliation.
A small group left the
Park after the teach-in to march
to Rep. Paul McCoskev's <R
Menlo Park) district ottice, and
about twenty protestors later
regrouped and walked on from
there to the Caltrans depot near
De Anza College in Cupertino,
where state officials were
rumored to have had malathion
in storage for eventual use by
helicopters.
