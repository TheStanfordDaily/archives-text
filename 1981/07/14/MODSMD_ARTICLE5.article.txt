## PACs gaining clout 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Arlington, Va. —
"PAC,"which sounds like just
another trivial acronym, in fact
stands for an increasingly in
fluential participant in cam
paign politics - the Political Ac
tion Committee.
Political Action Committees
could eventually supersede
Democratic and Republican
campaign organizations in fun
nelling independent funds into
congressional campaigns.
PACs as fund-raising or
ganizations are unfettered by
post-Watergate laws limiting
expenditures by candidates. Us
ing sophisticated direct-mail
techniques, they can raise mil
lions to be spent as they wish —
for specified candidates or, as
the National Conservative Po
litical Action Committee
(NCPAC) does regularly, for
"negative" campaigns against
incumbents even before they
have opponents.
Significantly, PACs are also
usually controlled by special in
terest groups. For example, ac
cording to Federal Election
Commission records, PACs of
the savings and loan industry,
which is seeking billions of
dollars in tax breaks, con
tributed a half-million dollars in
1979 and 1980 to two-thirds of the
current members of Congress.
Recently Congressional com
mittees have approved legisla
tion to create tax-free savings
cerUttcaX.es.The estimated an
nual loss of tax revenues, how
ever, would be at least $4 billion.
Ralph Nader's Congress
Watch says independent PACs
spent more than $16 million in

the 1980 elections, $13 million of
which came from the right side
of the spectrum. The propor
tions will change in 1982 with the
arrival of the new liberal
groups. But they have a long
way to go. Conservative direct
mail expert Richard Viguerie
estimates conservatives have
an 11-year head start, and many
liberals agree.
A year away from the
midterm elections, liberals are
regrouping, attempting to win
back the votes they've lost in the
past four years by emulating
conservative organizations. The
Progressive Political Action
Committee, PROPAC, is one of
five new liberal groups based on
the NCPAC example.
NCPAC, which spent $4 mil
lion in 1980, achieved its promi
nence as cornerstone of the
ascendant New Right because
its founder, Terry Dolan, was
one of the first to understand
and take advantage of the new
rules and combine them with
Viguerie's computerized fund
raising technology. Last fall's
conservative sweep, which
turned out of office four of the
six senators NCPAC had
marked for defeat, gave them
new credibility.
NCPAC (pronounced
"nickpack") takes credit for
the defeat of four prominent lib
eral senators — George McGov
ern of South Dakota, Frank
Church of Idaho, Birch Bayh of
Indiana and John Culver of
lowa.
But its strategy of negative
advertising — foes call it dis
torted — leads even some Re
publicans, including National

Chairman Richard Richards, to
suggest the strategy hurts the
party more than it helps by
creating an anti-NCPAC
backlash.
There's no question the ads
can be cutting. Anti-Church and
McGovern spots a year before
their elections showed empty
missile silos, implying the in
cumbent favored stripping na
tional defenses. One showed a
target over McGovern's fa'ce.
And there will be more to
come. Dolan hopes to spend be
tween $5 million and $6 million
next year and is considering

targets as big as Sen. Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd of West Virginia.
On the left, there's calculated
imitation of Dolan's methods.
PROPAC, for example, has
singled out for defeat Sens. Or
rin Hatch of Utah, Jesse Helms
of North Carolina, S.I. Hay
akawa of California and Har
rison Schmitt of New Mexico.
'If we're being shot at with a
weapon we have to shoot back
with a comparable weapon,"
says Lesley Israel, one of the

group's political coordinators.
PROPAC is run from the pub
lic relations office of Victor
Kamber, a former AFL-CIO of
ficial, and has ties to women's
organizations, civil liberties
and environmental groups and
other liberal constituencies.
Dolan has pulled com
mercials off the air from time to
time, like one that said Sen.
Church had voted for a pay raise
when in fact he'd voted against.
He says: "There's nothing in
our maier\a\s lhat vsn t true
we're doing is educating the
electorate."
