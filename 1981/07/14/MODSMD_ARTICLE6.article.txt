Washington — A government commission
opened hearings this week to determine
'' whether any wrong was committed in the in
ternment of 120,000 persons of Japanese an
cestry during World War 11.
The commission's legal mandate also calls
for recommendation of "appropriate reme
dies" for those citizens, permanent resident
aliens and others of Japanese ancestry thrown
into camps by President Franklin Roosevelt s
executive order No. 9066 of Feb. 19,1942.
The order was issued at a time of what his
torians later called hysteria on the West Coast
over the possiblity of an invasion by Japan. The
United States declared war on Japan on Dec. 8,
1941, the day after Japanese planes attacked
the U.S. Pacific Fleet at its base in Pearl Har
bor, Hawaii.
The commission also was directed by Con
gress to "review directives of United States
military forces requiring the relocation and, in
some cases, detention in internment camps of
American citizens, including Aleut civilians,
and permanent resident aliens of the Aleutian
and Pribilof Islands."
The Japanese American Citizens League,
founded in 1930, has been the chief proponent

for the establishment of the commission,
which it described last month as "a means of
educating the American public about events of
1942 and as a means of seeking significant re
medial measures" from Congress.
The league has called on Congress to "enact
safeguards and provide a lasting memorial so
that arbitrary governmental repression will
never again victimize any group of people in
the United States."
"The mass expulsion and incarcerations of
Americans of Japanese ancestry stands as a
dangerous precedent for all Americans. Re
dress for the victims of those governmental
abuses is in the best interest of all the people
and in the finest tradition of American jus
tice," the league said.
The league said a "totally inadequate com
pensation amount of BV2 cents on the dollar for
property losses alone" was paid by the govern
ment in 1948 and "loss of freedom, loss of in
come, death, injuries, loss of increased land
values, mental suffering, were not covered."
When President Ford rescinded Executive
Order 9066 in 1976 he acknowledged: "We now
know what we should have known then — not
only was the evacuation wrong, but Japanese-
Americans were and are loyal Americans."
