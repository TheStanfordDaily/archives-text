# Cuts in federal benefits especially affect nonworkers
## 
### Associated Press 
With the dust nearly settled in the
wake of the hurried congressional work
on President Reagan's reductions in fed
eral benefit programs, it is now clear
that those who will be hardest hit are
those outside the mainstream of working

Budget 1982

America.
Welfare recipients, Social security
beneficiaries and those out of work will
lose significant amounts of income.
"It may be that one or two of these
things might be tolerable to poor peo
ple," said Ron Gibbs, a welfare special

ist for the National Association of Coun
ties. "But taken together with food
stamps, welfare payments, day care and
other cuts, it's going to be very hard."
For the approximately 3.7 million wel
fare families, one painful impact will be
the partial elimination of an incentive in
tended to encourage welfare recipients
to get a job.
Under current law, part of a working
welfare recipient's salaries are de
ducted from his or her benefits. But as an
incentive to work, $30 and one-third of
the monthly income are exempt when the
computation is made.
While some other work incentives
have survived, including a minimum
credit for daycare, the $30 and one-third
income version will disappear four
months after a person signs up for wel

fare.
Countering this proposal is a require
ment that states set up "workfare" pro
grams requiring welfare recipients to
hold some kind of job to be eligible for
benefits.
Other changes
Among other changes is the elimina
tion of welfare benefits for women for
the first six months of pregnancy.
Welfare benefits would also be pro
hibited for anyone who went on strike or
who voluntarily quit a job or refused to
accept a new job without an acceptable
reason.
Anyone owning property worth more
than $1000, excluding a house and one
car, would be ineligible for benefits.
Partially because President Reagan
has made a separate proposal for reduc

ing some Social Security benefits, Con
gress made no major changes in the sys
tem during the budget-cutting process
The budget legislation does, however,
gradually eliminate the long-standing,
$2.2-billion program which provides ex
tra help for families with college stu
dents.
Students now receiving Social Secur
ity benefits will lose one quarter of their
payments beginning next year. Students
beginning college after June 1982 would
get no benefits.
Also eliminated was a $122 montly
minimum benefits provision which is de
signed to save $1 billion next year, but
which has been criticized because the
change could cost more to implement
than it will save in unpaid Social Security
checks to about 3 million people.
