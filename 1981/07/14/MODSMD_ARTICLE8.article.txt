# Activist West German church adds to dissent
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn — Growing militancy
and political activism within
West Germany's powerful Prot
estant Evangelical Church has
injected a potent element into
the country's already turbulent
political arena, putting some
clergy at odds with prominent
Social Democrats, who tradi
tionally have looked to the Prot
estant church as their religious
wellspring.
Of crucial importance in the
controversy is opposition within
the church to a new generation
of NATO missiles — a key part
of future alliance defense
strategy in Western Europe.
The missiles were a chief
target of a four-day gathering in
Hamburg in June that included
120,000 leaders and members of
the Evangelical Church — West
Germany's major Protestant
federation, grouping the Lu
theran, United and Reformed
churches and representing
nearly half of the country's pop
ulation.
While dramatizing the degree
of political unrest in West Ger
many today, the conference also
underscored an important fea
ture of the peace movement
here — the support it draws
from religious argument and
from some in the Protestant
church.
In April, both Schmidt and
President Karl Carstens —
members of opposing political
parties — attacked Protestant
church officials, accusing them
of misusing their office by in
terfering in politics and siding
with the antimissile protest.
Political resposibilities
The West German church is
particularly sensitive to its po
litical responsibilities as a re

suit of the Nazi past. "We have
been strongly influenced by the
experience under the Third
Reich, by the sense that the
church then did not do enough
when the government was de
veloping," explained Cornelius
van Heyl, chairman of the Prot
estant synod and a church spe
cialist on security issues. "We
feel we have a responsibility
now when dangerous and in
human developments appear."
To some church officials, the
new NATO missiles appear to
be just such a development. The
weapons are viewed not simply
as a further expansion of the
arms race but as an especially
menacing one since, it is
argued, they could allow the su
perpowers to limit a nuclear
war to Europe.
Institutional legitimacy
Government officials are es
pecially concerned about
church participation in the
peace movement because it has
given it institutional legit
imacy, making more difficult
the government's attempts to
dismiss opposition to the mis
siles as youthful idealism, radi
cal protest or political op
portunism.
The government's feud is
chiefly with Protestant clergy
who have traditionally been
friend and religious tutor of
West Germany's ruling Social
Democratic Party rather than
with Catholics, who historically
have opposed the Socialists.
Schmidt used an interview in
April with a West German Prot
estant publication to launch his
drive against the anti-missile
campaigners. He said that if the
Western allies had turned the
other cheek during the Stalin
era, Soviet divisions would now

be stationed along the Rhine,
which runs through the central
part of West Germany.
The Bible
Peace groups have gone to the
Bible to find one of their favor
ite arguments for renouncing
the NATO decision: Christ's
Sermon on the Mount, which ad
vises turning the other cheek to
aggressors.
Schmidt maintains that while
it is suitable as a guidepost for
individual behavior, the sermon
is an inadequate prescription
for political leaders who must
bear responsibility for the se
curity of nations.
Last week, debating critics in
a television broadcast, Schmidt
said the Sermon on the Mount
has practical limitations.
"You can't make it so easy
for yourselves," he said, "that
you say, 'I will put up with
someone else building up arms
and missiles that are directed
against my town and against
other towns, I will stand back on

the ground that God will look af
ter me.' You can't do that."
Protestant officials like to re
call the welcome they got from
an earlier Socialist government
when in the 1960s the church
supported Bonn's detente policy
with Eastern Europe. Church
officials say the government ap
pears to favor church involve
ment only when pastors side
with official policy.
Sweet and sour relationship
Relations between church
and state in Germany have a
long history of contention mixed
with cooperation.
In a trade-off of functions that
blurs the constitutional inde
pendence of church and state,
the government collects taxes
for support of German churches
while the churches operate hos
pitals, schools and nursing
homes.
Protestants and Catholics
each claim about 43 percent of
the West German population.
Traditionally, the two have dif

fered in their approach to public
policy. The Catholics tend to
pursue specific policy aims,
such as opposing abortion, ob
scenity and divorce and favor
ing religious schools. The Prot
estants have keyed their politi
cal activity to such broader is
sues as German reunification,
labor-management relations
and civil liberties.
The church's recent activism
has been interpreted by some
critics as an effort by some cler
gy to appear more relevant in a
period of declining church at
tendance.
Heyl disputed this, saying:
"The theme of peace does not
make the church full. Just the
opposite. It causes tension and
that is not popular."
Whether tutoring pacifists,
solacing housing protesters or
blessing environmentalists,
church officials have been fre
quently in evidence in West Ger
man politics recently.

Bonn — Growing militancy
and political activism within
West Germany's powerful Prot
estant Evangelical Church has
injected a potent element into
the country's already turbulent
political arena, putting some
clergy at odds with prominent
Social Democrats, who tradi
tionally have looked to the Prot
estant church as their religious
wellspring.
Of crucial importance in the
controversy is opposition within
the church to a new generation
of NATO missiles — a key part
of future alliance defense
strategy in Western Europe.
The missiles were a chief
target of a four-day gathering in
Hamburg in June that included
120,000 leaders and members of
the Evangelical Church — West
Germany's major Protestant
federation, grouping the Lu
theran, United and Reformed
churches and representing
nearly half of the country's pop
ulation.
While dramatizing the degree
of political unrest in West Ger
many today, the conference also
underscored an important fea
ture of the peace movement
here — the support it draws
from religious argument and
from some in the Protestant
church.
In April, both Schmidt and
President Karl Carstens —
members of opposing political
parties — attacked Protestant
church officials, accusing them
of misusing their office by in
terfering in politics and siding
with the antimissile protest.
Political resposibilities
The West German church is
particularly sensitive to its po
litical responsibilities as a re

suit of the Nazi past. "We have
been strongly influenced by the
experience under the Third
Reich, by the sense that the
church then did not do enough
when the government was de
veloping," explained Cornelius
van Heyl, chairman of the Prot
estant synod and a church spe
cialist on security issues. "We
feel we have a responsibility
now when dangerous and in
human developments appear."
To some church officials, the
new NATO missiles appear to
be just such a development. The
weapons are viewed not simply
as a further expansion of the
arms race but as an especially
menacing one since, it is
argued, they could allow the su
perpowers to limit a nuclear
war to Europe.
Institutional legitimacy
Government officials are es
pecially concerned about
church participation in the
peace movement because it has
given it institutional legit
imacy, making more difficult
the government's attempts to
dismiss opposition to the mis
siles as youthful idealism, radi
cal protest or political op
portunism.
The government's feud is
chiefly with Protestant clergy
who have traditionally been
friend and religious tutor of
West Germany's ruling Social
Democratic Party rather than
with Catholics, who historically
have opposed the Socialists.
Schmidt used an interview in
April with a West German Prot
estant publication to launch his
drive against the anti-missile
campaigners. He said that if the
Western allies had turned the
other cheek during the Stalin
era, Soviet divisions would now

be stationed along the Rhine,
which runs through the central
part of West Germany.
The Bible
Peace groups have gone to the
Bible to find one of their favor
ite arguments for renouncing
the NATO decision: Christ's
Sermon on the Mount, which ad
vises turning the other cheek to
aggressors.
Schmidt maintains that while
it is suitable as a guidepost for
individual behavior, the sermon
is an inadequate prescription
for political leaders who must
bear responsibility for the se
curity of nations.
Last week, debating critics in
a television broadcast, Schmidt
said the Sermon on the Mount
has practical limitations.
"You can't make it so easy
for yourselves," he said, "that
you say, 'I will put up with
someone else building up arms
and missiles that are directed
against my town and against
other towns, I will stand back on

the ground that God will look af
ter me.' You can't do that."
Protestant officials like to re
call the welcome they got from
an earlier Socialist government
when in the 1960s the church
supported Bonn's detente policy
with Eastern Europe. Church
officials say the government ap
pears to favor church involve
ment only when pastors side
with official policy.
Sweet and sour relationship
Relations between church
and state in Germany have a
long history of contention mixed
with cooperation.
In a trade-off of functions that
blurs the constitutional inde
pendence of church and state,
the government collects taxes
for support of German churches
while the churches operate hos
pitals, schools and nursing
homes.
