# OECD predicts slow economic recovery
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — Economic recovery
in the major industrial coun
tries will be delayed until late
next year, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and De
velopment has forecast.
Six months ago, the OECD ex
pected that a turnaround in the
world economy would be under
way by now, but improvement
has been impeded at least in
part by the U.S. policy of bat
tling inflation through strict
controls on its money supply.
In a carefully worded, mid
year forecast of world economic
developments issued last week,

OECD economists suggested
that the Reagan administration
has put too much emphasis on
directing economic activity
through monetary controls.
Since the last OECD forecast
in December, the value of the
dollar has increased 20 percent
against European currencies.
This change has had the effect
of raising oil prices for OECD
members because most oil bills
are paid in dollars. To defend
their own currencies, the Eu
ropeans have raised their own
interest rates, even though their
economies might benefit more
by cheaper money and more ec
onomic growth.
"Monetary and fiscal policy
should be conducted in a com
plementary fashion, taking due
account of both international
constraints and implications in
an interdependent world," the
OECD report said.
For an improvement in world
economic activity, the report
added, it might be better for
Washington to further tighten
government spending and relax
its monetary controls to permit
interest rates to fall.
In general, the OECD fore
cast that the world industrial
economy would grow by only 1
percent this year and 2 percent
next year.
The projection for U.S.
growth this year was only 2.5
percent with another 1 percent
to be added in 1982, a lower level

than the Reagan administration
has forecast.
American growth is crucial to
the OECD area since the United
States accounts for 35 percent of
total output.
West European growth is
projected at an even lower rate,
with a decline this year and 2
percent growth next year.
The OECD projected that un
employment in the United
States would remain at 7.75 per
cent through 1982, because of
sluggish growth, and that it
would rise in Europe to more
than 9 percent.
A minority of members, led
by France, wants the industrial
countries to adopt a policy of ex
pansion in order to reduce un
employment. France's new, so
cialist government, headed by
Francois Mitterrand, already
has initiated a reflationary poli
cy.
The majority of OECD mem
bers, including the United
States and Great Britain, con
tinue to use monetary controls
to restrict growth and reduce in
flation.
In the longer run, the Europe
ans could benefit from lower
currency values, which have the
effect of reducing the cost of
their exports and may increase
unit sales. This will stimulate
their economies, since foreign
trade accounts for a large share
of their output.
