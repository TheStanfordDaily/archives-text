The urban riots continue . . .
British youths overturn a car as they rampage through the
streets of south London. Wednesday's riots marked the 13th
straight night of rioting in Britain involving more than 30
cities and towns and causing tens of millions of dollars in
damage. Nearly 1000 police officers have been injured. Part
of the cause for the rioting appears to be frustration among
working class youths overhigh unemployment and lack of job
opportunities. The violence has also been linked to racial ten
sions.
