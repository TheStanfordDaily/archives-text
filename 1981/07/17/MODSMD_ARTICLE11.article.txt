# Polish Communist Party holds first secret elections
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Delegates
to Poland's extraordinary Com
munist Party congress yester
day started electing a new lead
ership by secret ballot for the
first time in the Soviet bloc.
Under usual communist pro
cedures, candidates for such
posts are selected beforehand
by the leadership and then ap
proved unanimously by open
show of hands at the congress.
The most remarkable fact
about the choice of candidates
this time is that only 12 percent
are members of the outgoing
central administration. Even
assuming that most of them get
re-elected, this means that the
new Polish Central Committee
will be made up overwhelming
ly of new faces.
The first task of the new Cen
tral Committee will be to pro
pose candidates for party lead
er, to be elected by the con
gress. The outgoing first secre
tary, Stanislaw Kania, is ex
pected to face as many as half a
dozen opponents representing
both the reformist and hard-line
factions in the party. At the
start of the congress, Kania told
delegates that when it came to
elections, no better system had
yet been divised than the secret
ballot.
After scarcely 10 months of
practice, Poland's Communist
Party — in common with the
rest of the nation — is still learn
ing how to make democratic
procedures work. That is one
reason why procedural argu
ments at this congress have
been heated and have even, in
the view of some participants,
detracted attention from the
primary purpose of extricating
Poland from its political and ec
onomic crisis.
Asked about the lengthy floor
fights, one of the delegates,
Dominik Horodynski, who is
editor in chief of the prestigious
literary magazine Kultura, said
he believed they were inevitable
in Poland's present situation.

"These fights could go on for
hours. Nobody is likely to at
tempt to curb them. It is a result
of our hunger for full democracy
and having our own say in ev
erything."
Not all votes are held in se
cret — and this gives the leader
ship a possibility of influencing
the results. Simple procedural
questions are decided by open
show of hands during which a
delegate is less likely to court
attention by going against the
leadership's wishes.
And of course Kania, like the
chief executive of any power ap
paratus, is hardly a political in
nocent. One-man, one-vote may
be a democratic mechanism,
but he knows how to use it to his
own advantage.
At a Central Committee
meeting last month, Kania was
able to isolate his hard-line
challengers by calling for an
open vote on whether to proceed
with a motion of confidence in
individual Politburo members.
Ironically, the same trick failed
to work a second time at the con
gress when the delegates turned
down a proposal to immediately
re-elect him first secretary.
Kania's vote-winning magic
was broken.
The Polish party congress is
certainly much freer than pre
vious such meetings, but it
would be wrong to depict it as an
exercise in Athenian-type de
mocracy. As at an American po
litical convention, many forces
are at work behind the scenes.
Votes are traded in return for
jobs, and the reputations of
some of the candidates are
blackened by slurs.
