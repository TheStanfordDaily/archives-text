# Ian Smith's white minority party wins two key elections
## Political tensions mount in Zimbabwe 
### Los Angeles Times 
Salisbuty, Zimbabwe — Election victories by
lan Smith's party have brought Zimbabwe's pre
dominantly black government to the brink of
crisis in its relations with the white minority.
Several black Cabinet members in the govern
ment of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe have
called for Smith's deportation because of his
criticism of Mugabe's rule.
In two recent Parliamentary elections, can
didates of Smith's Republican Front Party easily
defeated the nominees of a new white political
party that had the support of Mugabe. The seats
are guaranteed for white representatives by Zim
babwe's new constitution.
In the latest Smith victory, British Brigadier
John Probert won by better than two to one over
Chris Mercer, a Salisbury lawyer representing
the newly formed Democratic Party. The contest
was in a well-to-do white suburb.
Earlier this month, Andre Holland, who
founded the Democratic Party after a falling-out
with Smith, lost resoundingly to another Re
publican Front candidate, Geoff York, in a farm
ing area east of Salisbury.
Smith, who as prime minister declared unilat
eral independence from Britain in 1965 and defied
a worldwide trade and political boycott that fol
lowed, finally gave in to limited black rule in 1979
and to complete black rule last year.
Mugabe, a guerrilla leader in the bitter seven
year war against the Smith regime, was elected
prime minister overwhelmingly 15 months ago in
British-supervised elections at which voting
rights were extended for the first time to all
blacks over 18.
The Smith party is the only white political
group represented in Parliament, filling all 20
seats guaranteed for whites by the Zimbabwe con
stitution. The guarantee lasts seven years. Eighty
seats are filled by blacks.
Initially, Smith approved of the Mugabe gov
ernment.
"I did say all whites were pleasantly surprised
when (Mugabe) came in because we had thought
he was sort of a Marxist ogre," Smith said in an
interview. "He announced a policy of reconcil
iation instead of recrimination. But when is he
going to back up his words with deeds? Why are
his ministers seeming to undermine his efforts?"
In the past several months, Smith has become

increasingly critical of the Mugabe government,
reverting to condemnation of black rule.
Avoiding direct criticism of Mugabe, whom he
sees in private occasionally, Smith has centered
his attack on black Cabinet ministers, particular
ly Finance Minister Enos Nkala.
Smith has asserted that the economy is being
mismanaged and as a result inflation will proba
bly rise to 20 percent or 30 percent this year.
Nkala, in turn, said in an interview that he is
"fed up" with unreasonable criticism from Smith
and that if the former prime minister does not
stop his "alarmist" talk, he could be deported.
Nkala was jailed under the Smith regime for his
anti-government activities. "I was in detention
for 14 years and would feel nothing if the position
is reversed," Nkala said.
How seriously Mugabe is taking the threats of.
his Cabinet ministers toward Smith is unknown.
But political observers believe that Mugabe, only
"first among equals" in his Socialist Party's Cen
tral Committee, probably cannot afford to repri
mand his outspoken anti-Smith Cabinet ministers.
In the interview, Smith said he is delighted with
the support shown his party's candidates in the re
cent elections.
"The RF (Republican Front Party, which was
known as the Rhodesian Front Party when Smith
was prime minister) has not lost an election
among whites since 1962," Smith said, beaming.
He said the Mugabe policies, while moderate at
first, are becoming more socialistic at the ex
pense of the whites. He believes that what he
called insults to the whites being voiced on gov
ernment-controlled radio and television and in
government-owned newspapers could accelerate
the emigration of whites.
There are about 200,000 whites in Zimbabwe
(down from 270,000) compared to 7.2 million
blacks. Mugabe has decried this white flight and
continues to press his policy of reconciliation in an
attempt to convince whites that they and their
skills are needed and wanted.
Smith said the white departures are hurting
most in the area of civil service, education and
health services.
Jauntily, Smith concluded: "We are living in in
teresting times. Every other black African coun
try is bankrupt. The only way to escape that fate
here is to retain a high percentage of whites."

British-supervised elections at which voting
rights were extended for the first time to all
blacks over 18.
The Smith party is the only white political
group represented in Parliament, filling all 20
seats guaranteed for whites by the Zimbabwe con
stitution. The guarantee lasts seven years. Eighty
seats are filled by blacks.
Initially, Smith approved of the Mugabe gov
ernment.
"I did say all whites were pleasantly surprised
when (Mugabe) came in because we had thought
he was sort of a Marxist ogre," Smith said in an
interview. "He announced a policy of reconcil
iation instead of recrimination. But when is he
going to back up his words with deeds? Why are
his ministers seeming to undermine his efforts?"
In the past several months, Smith has become

increasingly critical of the Mugabe government,
reverting to condemnation of black rule.
Avoiding direct criticism of Mugabe, whom he
sees in private occasionally, Smith has centered
his attack on black Cabinet ministers, particular
ly Finance Minister Enos Nkala.
Smith has asserted that the economy is being
mismanaged and as a result inflation will proba
bly rise to 20 percent or 30 percent this year.
Nkala, in turn, said in an interview that he is
"fed up" with unreasonable criticism from Smith
and that if the former prime minister does not
stop his "alarmist" talk, he could be deported.
Nkala was jailed under the Smith regime for his
anti-government activities. "I was in detention
for 14 years and would feel nothing if the position
is reversed," Nkala said.
How seriously Mugabe is taking the threats of.
his Cabinet ministers toward Smith is unknown.
But political observers believe that Mugabe, only
"first among equals" in his Socialist Party's Cen
tral Committee, probably cannot afford to repri
mand his outspoken anti-Smith Cabinet ministers.
In the interview, Smith said he is delighted with
the support shown his party's candidates in the re
cent elections.
"The RF (Republican Front Party, which was
known as the Rhodesian Front Party when Smith
was prime minister) has not lost an election
among whites since 1962," Smith said, beaming.
He said the Mugabe policies, while moderate at
first, are becoming more socialistic at the ex
pense of the whites. He believes that what he
called insults to the whites being voiced on gov
ernment-controlled radio and television and in
government-owned newspapers could accelerate
the emigration of whites.
There are about 200,000 whites in Zimbabwe
(down from 270,000) compared to 7.2 million
blacks. Mugabe has decried this white flight and
continues to press his policy of reconciliation in an
attempt to convince whites that they and their
skills are needed and wanted.
Smith said the white departures are hurting
most in the area of civil service, education and
health services.
Jauntily, Smith concluded: "We are living in in
teresting times. Every other black African coun
try is bankrupt. The only way to escape that fate
here is to retain a high percentage of whites."
