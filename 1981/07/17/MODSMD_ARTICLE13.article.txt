"The Stanford Hospital sys
tem represents excellence in
health care, and it is excellent
because of your quality," said
Dr. James Silverman, officially
welcoming Stanford's new in
terns at the Second Annual
House Staff Reception last Fri
day.
"You are a highly selected
group taken from a previously
highly selected group," Silver
man said, injecting them with
confidence to tackle the rough
year ahead.
A medical internship is the
final stage of a doctor's formal
training. Stanford's new interns
have all been accepted to vari
ous residency training pro
grams which will take between
three to five years to complete.

"Basically, you will exist for
the rest of your medical career
on what you learn here," Silver
man said.
The reception, which took
place at Fairchild Auditorium,
brought together faculty and
staff of all disciplines.
Dr. Robert Chase, Emile
Holman Professor of Surgery,
was guest speaker at the recep
tion.
The highlight of the lecture
was Chase's discussion of robot
ic limbs and wheelchairs. Ac
cording to Chase, 'smart wheel
chairs' are being developed
which can be programmed to
follow a walking person or turn
a corner at the nod of the user's
head.
"The controls are activated
by ultrasonic sensors," Chase

explained, "Sensors can track
any movements of the head left
or right."
Chase also presented slides il
lustrating the use of a robotic
arm which picked up a tele
phone receiver and held it to the
ear of its creator, David Jaffee,
in response to his voice com
mands. "Jaffe is currently re
fining the robotic arm so it will
become less expensive and
more easily marketable,"
Chase said.
Chase also discussed ad
vances in X-ray techniques re
sulting from the use of micro
chip technology and the
ramifications of Dr. Henry
Kaplan's work with monoclonal
antibodies. "These are the in
gredients of a dream with real
possibilities," Chase said.
