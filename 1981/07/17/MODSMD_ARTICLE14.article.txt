# Phone sex survey harasses Peninsula women
## 
### Karl Schoenberger 
A rash of Bay Area women have phoned the Medical
Center recently to inquire about a mysterious caller
who identifies himself as a doctor conducting a survey
on sex for the University. According to a spokesperson
for the Medical Center, the caller may be the same man
who has been plaguing women in the area with a sex
survey hoax for as long as four years.
Recent calls have centered in the Pacifica area, al
though some complaints have originated in the East
Bay. The male caller uses different names and oc
caisionally says he is associated with Planned Parent
hood.
The women phoning Stanford and Planned Parent
hood have all reported a similar pattern — the man
seems legimate at first and politely asks general ques
tions that elicit lenghtly and detailed responses. He be
gins with topics such as birth control and toxic shock
syndrome, and then asks increasingly personal and sen
sitive questions about their sexual habits.
The caller is not overtly obscene, but apparantly
seeks the effect of making women uncomfortable with

clinically professional but highly embarrassing ques
tions. He asked some women questions about oral sex
and sodomy, said a Med Center source.
Don Thomas, of the Center's personnel management
office, said that there are at present "no related studies
involving outside contact" here. "However, we're
trying to see if there is any possibility of anyone here
actually making the calls," he said. Planned Parent
hood also said that no sex survey is being conducted by
their organization.
None of the women harassed by the caller could be
reached for comment.
Connie Upman, a secretary at the Center's
gynecology and obstetrics department, talked to some
of the women phoning to see if the survey was legimate.
She said the women were confused by the caller and up
set that they had been tricked into cooperating to the
end.
Andrea White of the Pacifica office of Planned Pa
renthood, who also received several inquiries from vic
tims of the hoax, said women she spoke to needed re
assurance. She said the women "felt they'd been

trapped and humiliated by the questions." Most of
them had quickly become suspicious and hung up on the
man, she said.
Descriptions of the man's phone manner and style of
questioning match very closely those of a man reported
to have made similar calls as long as four years ago.
The San Bruno Herald reported in September 1979
that a man had called several women in northern San
Mateo County and identified himself as Dr. Peter
Townsend, claiming that he was conducting a sex sur
vey for Planned Parenthood and the University.
Even then, the nuisance calls had been reported for
several years previously, centering in San Francisco
until they stopped temporarily when a city newspaper
printed a warning, according to the Herald.
Several different offices in the Stanford Hospital ad
ministration said they have received inquiries about
the survey, but no central file or record of the phone
calls has been kept here.
The University and Planned Parenthood advise
women receiving calls from anyone claiming to be con
ducting a sex survey to hang up immediately.
