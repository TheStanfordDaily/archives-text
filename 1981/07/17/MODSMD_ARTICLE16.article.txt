## Gail Edmondson Shares Recognize limit to neonatal care 
### 
Medi-Cal's recently an
nounced $100 million budget
shortfall is just one indication of
a fast-approaching era of medi
cal limits.
There are no longer enough
government dollars to treat ev
ery patient for every ailment.
Politicians, health adminis
trators and doctors all face the
problem of evolving a cost-bene
fit approach to the delivery of
health care.
The first step toward solving
the problem of limited re
sources at any level — local,
state or national — is to probe
the "gray areas" of current
medical practice. One such area
is the treatment of extremely
premature infants.
An ethical gray zone now ex
ists in which society must con
sider at what cost and at what
risk doctors should try to
salvage a fetus which has al
ready been deprived of almost
half its time in the womb.
Pro-life groups will undoub
tedly ajgue in favor of the medi
cal heroics that are keeping
alive ever-younger newborns,
but the question is, "Who will
pay?"
Each year. 39,000 infants are
born weighing less than 1500
grams (3.2 pounds). Until the
mid-1970'5, 80 percent of
these "preemies" did not sur

vive.
Doctors can now save two
thirds of the premature infants
bonr weighing between 1000 and
1500 grams, but those that sur
vive are often seriously dam
aged with epilepsy, mental re
tardation, blindness, cerebral
palsy and other neurological im
pairments.
The technology to save pre
mature infants is progressing
faster than the technology to
prevent damage to the nervous
system during those crucial ear
ly weeks outside the womb.
The cost to society for the
care and treatment of each
"preemie" in an intensive care
nursery averages $1500 to $2000
a day. The length of stay ranges
from several weeks to more
than a year.
Once the damaged child is
sent home, the family must as
sume a lifetime financial
burden. Parents protesting this
burden have begun to file
"wrongful life" lawsuits in

which the doctor is blamed for
saving a life that should not
have been saved — and the pa
rents are winning.
Nevertheless, the battle to
save premature infants goes on
at a tremendous pace. The coun
try's top neonatology units are
now working to keep alive
fetuses as young as 24 weeks -
babies born four months early.
Society can no longer afford
to support medical heroics that
cost $800,000 a year and do only a
half-way job. The policy of
trying to save 20,000 preemies a
year that eventually die, or are
severely damaged, limits the
resources for other children
with a more promising outlook.
Hesitant as this country is to
rein in "progress," the time
has come to draw the line in de
fining what kind of life is really
worth preserving.
