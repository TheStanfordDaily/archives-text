## Always can pull plug on alienating aliens 
### 
With cool savoire faire, I
wiped my brow and left the con
fines of the stifling anteroom. I
had been cured, but what about
the millions of other Americans
still suffering from the same af
fliction? I could only wince and
ponder the debilitating disease
of my past.
It all began with space in
vaders. "The first game's
free," I remember a savage,
satanic figure taunting. "Here's
a quarter."
"Big deal," I thought to my
self as I slipped it into the slot.
Suddenly, aliens were ev
erywhere, threatening the well
being of mankind. Smitten in
one blow, I turned away, de
jected. I had lost, but there was
always another chance, another
game to play in the galactic bat
tle for truth, justice, and the
American way. It was worth an
other quarter; it was my duty.
Shot after shot, I tolerated the
alien offensive, lying in wait to
spring an atomic blitzkrieg on
their unwary ships. 2000, 3000,
10,000 points of aliens
anihiliated, but they just kept
coming. My fuel was getting low
and my nerves were like piano
wire. I couldn't hesitate now,
but there was a force towering
over me that I couldn't control.
"I'm sorry, sir, but for the
fifth time, we're closed," said
the 6'5" manager pulling me
away from the hyperspace but
ton.
"But the future is on the
line," I shouted as he pushed me
out the door. "The future. . ."
Later that night, dressed in
black, I made my way through
an air shaft into the anteroom of
doom for another confrontation.
My strength was drawn, my
wallet was empty, but thanks to
an all-night teller and a change
machine, I refueled my quarter
supply. My bank account
floudered, but I still had 162
more chances to vanquish the
invasion.
Who could I blame for my ob
session, this duty which pre
empted even my basic bodily
functions? NERDS, yes nerds.
Who else could plot to build such
a machine? Those nerds I
laughed at and ridiculed by day
were my nemesis by night.
Those nerds were being paid
$92,000 a year to sit at a

computer terminal and create
invaders, hyperspace,
asteroids, and cosmic forces all
geared to my personal destruc
tion.
Nerds, nerds, why did I laugh
at them when they were re
sponsible for my decay, regres
sion and bondage to a task so vi
tal that my life was secondary in
perspective? I was hardcore
and the nerds had the last laugh.
I had lost my supplies, 161
quarters. I had died 161 times.
The Earth had succumbed 161
times in a single night. I had this
chance, I couldn't blow it.
I slid in the last quarter, cool
ly and forcefully; nerds or no
nerds this victory would be
mine.
Aliens to the right of me, al
iens to the left of me, into the
time warp of death, I rode unat
tended. .Laser cannon,
asteroids, my fingers worn to
the bone. I remembered the
adage of starfighters in battle
deaf and dumb, Quam tempis
fugit cum habendus esses
odium. (How time flies when
you're having fun) It didn't mat
ter to me now. I was going for
the gusto. I had it within me. I
had the force.
Finally, victory, 100,000
points, past the 38th space par
allel. The earth was saved.
Then something unexpected
happened. "Please enter your
initials you are the new cham
pion" flashed on the screen. I
followed the instructions, blind
ly-
Fool, I thought, fool. The al
iens now had my name. They
had been watching me all along
and now I had given them my
name so on their next return
they could seek me out when
wouldn't be expecting an at
tack.
Then again, this screen was
probably a monitor for the Kbb
to eliminate those skilled
enough to pilot starfighters in
the next war against de
mocracy. I shook, I shuddered,
they had me right where they
wanted me. It took a side
stepping of my moral system,
was ungodly, but I did wha
needed to be done. I pulled the
plug. . .

ter to me now. I was going for
the gusto. I had it within me. I
had the force.
Finally, victory, 100,000
points, past the 38th space par
allel. The earth was saved.
Then something unexpected
happened. "Please enter your
initials you are the new cham
pion" flashed on the screen. I
followed the instructions, blind
ly-
Fool, I thought, fool. The al
iens now had my name. They
had been watching me all along
and now I had given them my
name so on their next return
they could seek me out when
wouldn't be expecting an at
tack.
Then again, this screen was
probably a monitor for the Kbb
to eliminate those skilled
enough to pilot starfighters in
the next war against de
mocracy. I shook, I shuddered,
they had me right where they
wanted me. It took a side
stepping of my moral system,
was ungodly, but I did wha
needed to be done. I pulled the
plug. . .

With cool savoire faire, I
wiped my brow and left the con
fines of the stifling anteroom. I
had been cured, but what about
the millions of other Americans
still suffering from the same af
fliction? I could only wince and
ponder the debilitating disease
of my past.
It all began with space in
vaders. "The first game's
free," I remember a savage,
satanic figure taunting. "Here's
a quarter."
"Big deal," I thought to my
self as I slipped it into the slot.
Suddenly, aliens were ev
erywhere, threatening the well
being of mankind. Smitten in
one blow, I turned away, de
jected. I had lost, but there was
always another chance, another
game to play in the galactic bat
tle for truth, justice, and the
American way. It was worth an
other quarter; it was my duty.
Shot after shot, I tolerated the
alien offensive, lying in wait to
spring an atomic blitzkrieg on
their unwary ships. 2000, 3000,
10,000 points of aliens
anihiliated, but they just kept
coming. My fuel was getting low
and my nerves were like piano
wire. I couldn't hesitate now,
but there was a force towering
over me that I couldn't control.
"I'm sorry, sir, but for the
fifth time, we're closed," said
the 6'5" manager pulling me
away from the hyperspace but
ton.
"But the future is on the
line," I shouted as he pushed me
out the door. "The future. . ."
Later that night, dressed in
black, I made my way through
an air shaft into the anteroom of
doom for another confrontation.
My strength was drawn, my
wallet was empty, but thanks to
an all-night teller and a change
machine, I refueled my quarter
supply. My bank account
floudered, but I still had 162
more chances to vanquish the
invasion.
Who could I blame for my ob
session, this duty which pre
empted even my basic bodily
functions? NERDS, yes nerds.
Who else could plot to build such
a machine? Those nerds I
laughed at and ridiculed by day
were my nemesis by night.
Those nerds were being paid
$92,000 a year to sit at a

computer terminal and create
invaders, hyperspace,
asteroids, and cosmic forces all
geared to my personal destruc
tion.
Nerds, nerds, why did I laugh
at them when they were re
sponsible for my decay, regres
sion and bondage to a task so vi
tal that my life was secondary in
perspective? I was hardcore
and the nerds had the last laugh.
I had lost my supplies, 161
quarters. I had died 161 times.
The Earth had succumbed 161
times in a single night. I had this
chance, I couldn't blow it.
I slid in the last quarter, cool
ly and forcefully; nerds or no
nerds this victory would be
mine.
Aliens to the right of me, al
iens to the left of me, into the
time warp of death, I rode unat
tended. .Laser cannon,
asteroids, my fingers worn to
the bone. I remembered the
adage of starfighters in battle
deaf and dumb, Quam tempis
fugit cum habendus esses
odium. (How time flies when
you're having fun) It didn't mat
ter to me now. I was going for
the gusto. I had it within me. I
had the force.
Finally, victory, 100,000
points, past the 38th space par
allel. The earth was saved.
