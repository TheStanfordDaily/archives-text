## The
						real world: not a spectator sport 
### 
This country's fascination
with things European must
make us the private laughing
stocks of sociologists ev
erywhere. How can one explain
an envious worship of a country
that we fought for decades to es
cape and is currently on the
verge of economic collapse?
England (the term "Great Brit
ain" somehow doesn't seem ap
propriate) is a diseased land —
torn by racism, class division,
the failure of the welfare state

and fascist reactions to that fail
ure. It doesn't "run" so much as
fall forward, pushed by other
European nations in search of
an expendable "point man" and
pulled by the weight of its top
heavy history. The Elephant
Man of Western Europe.
And we watch the freak show
transfixed, descending like vul
tures from time to time to pick
up on particularly trendy parts
of the British culture. We listen
to primarily English bands on
American radio, wearing
clothes designed by fashionable
British shops, falling in love
with the lilting accents of dist
inguished English actors.
In this all-encompassing
thirst for entertainment, poli
tics becomes as much of an at
traction as the cultural specta
cle. This view, though, of other
cultures as fodder for our own is
a mistake in priorities — an er
ror which, if we choose to con
tinue it, could result in grave
threats to our own country's sta
bility.
Suppose our own U.S. elec
tions become public spectacles.

We would vote for the most en
tertaining candidate. Wouldn't
such capricious ballot choices
wreak havoc on our govern
ment? Now think: how far are
we from that state?
In England, panic laws are
being introduced, living up to
their names not by enforcing
peace, but by inciting violence.
Even if the battles do end soon,
the scars on the British national
psyche will last far longer than
the significant damage to the
cities.
So if these events are so
crucial to Britain's existence,
how did they come about? Are
the riots symptomatic of the
final crash to the ground of the
welfare state?
Is it proof of the foolhardy
elitism of the Thatcher govern
ment? Is it evidence of the low
er-classes' tendency to stay low
er-class by repeatedly destroy
ing itself?
It could be all these reasons.
But more likely, it is none of
them.
The rioters of England are not
fighting for a theory of cause.

but out of simple boredom
Time and again, in all reports of
the violence in London or Liver
pool or Leicester, a young
fighter says, "There's nothing
else to do." "I'm just bored.
"We did it for a laugh."
A laugh. Meanwhile across
the Atlantic, we struggle to
analyze and to find a scapegoat
for our problems. Trying to
ascertain a right or wrong or af
fix blame in society's conflicts
is useless pedantry, and in fact
causes further deterioration.
Ask the police in England, who
are being attacked more and
more for each riot weapon the
government gives them. Per
haps if we can see this insatiable
need for theory and confronta
tion as the cause of Britain's se
rious crises, and if we take a
look at our own brewing tem
pests — draft registration and
nuclear weapons (among other
things) — we can somehow
learn from our neighbor's trou
bles and see Britain not as a
curio or a tragedy, but as a
warning.
