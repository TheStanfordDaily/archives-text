Bless strippers
The student volunteers help
ing campus residents last week
end with tough jobs in tree strip
ping deserve high praise.
In my case, three people did a
Herculean labor on a 30 ft. holly
tree. It fought back every inch
of the way.
Heartfelt thanks to Stephen
Downs and Ruth and Jeff Un
sicker. Anne Downs babysat
lots of children. Bless her, too.
