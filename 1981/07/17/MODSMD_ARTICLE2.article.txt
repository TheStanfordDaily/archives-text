Officials battling the Medi
terranean fruit fly infestation
added 25 square miles yesterday
to the area to be sprayed — the
latest area targeted for
spraying is north of Palo Alto, in
south San Mateo County.
Although it is not definite yet
that the campus will be sprayed,
University President Donald
Kennedy stated last night, "I
know the area (targeted for
spraying) has been shifting.
We've predicated our assump
tions on the fact that it's likely
for us to eventually be included
in the area."
Kennedy also stated, "I don't
think anything known on the
medical effects (of the
malathion spraying) can give
campus residents any cause for
concern."
Worries about the Jasper
Ridge biological preserve
should prove groundless, as
Kennedy did say that officials
"certainly don't need to spray
that, and they have indicated
they won't."

The expansion of the areas to
be sprayed was announced after
bait laced with malathion
clogged helicopter pumps and
the aerial spraying mission
bogged down once again early
yesterday morning.
Gov. Jerry Brown has sent a
letter to President Ronald Rea
gan asking that three California
counties be declared disaster
areas. White House spokes
woman Kama Small said the
Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency was reviewing
the letter, and would turn in
their recommendation to the
president.
Designation as a federal dis
aster area would make low-in
terest loans available to people,
businesses and local govern
ments that suffer losses be
cause of the infestation and the
fight against it.
"I want the president to share
in this," Brown told reporters at
a news conference after releas
ing the text of his letter to Rea
gan. "The medfly is not local
ized by the boundaries of Cali
fornia."
