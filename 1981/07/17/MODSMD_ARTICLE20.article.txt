Eat fruit
Now that it seems inevitable
that Ronny Wonderful is going
to get back at Palo Alto and
Stanford for not taking part in
the "mandate" in last Novem
ber's election, we ought to pre
pare outselves for the full brunt
of the ground and/or air attack.
We're in for a difficult strug
gle. Secretary of Agriculture
John Block, who is heading up
the attack, is a tough character.
Rumor has it that he responded
to the constant inquiries to the
lack of information about the
long term health effects of the
spraying of Malathion with a
curt "Let them eat fruit!"
My suspicion is that the Moral
Majority, having found out that
women's rights-supporting

Sanlra O'Connor got her start
right here at Stanford, started
investigating the campus and
found the former director of the
FDA who tried to take away
their saccharin (which was
theatening to many Moral Ma
jority members whose only per
missible indulgence is sweets).
Digging deeper, they found
hundreds of signatures of "lib
eral, immoral, effete intellec
tuals" on petitions favoring
women's rights and gay rights,
and calling for respect for hu
man rights in both pro-com
munist and (heaven forbid)
anti-communist regimes and
for the ouster of Secretary of the
Interior James Watt.
They figured that the half-life
of the radiation from nuking us
'til we glowed was a little too

long, so spraying us with
malathion until our
chromosomes are altered was
the obvious means of attack.
The best thing you can do
when a Moral Majority member
comes to your door in the guise
of a ground sprayer and asks you
if you "suffer from tolerance"
is not to be weak-kneed but to
stand firm and say, "Yes, I 'suf
fer from tolerance' and my
heart bleeds for those who are
unnecessarily restricted from
equal protection under the
law."

Stuart Leaf's effusive yet ig
norant review of Au Cham
bertin (Daily, July 10) is a
potential misservice to your
readers. I wonder about the
credentials of a critic who can
say "unlike its counterparts in

Europe, Au Chambertin pro
vides a superb meal and setting
without the unpleasant side-ef
fect of putting you on display."
An experienced francophile my
self, I have no idea to what he is
referring. Perhaps he should
have told us.
If one reads carefully ("al
though slightly singed. .
..covered with a generous
layer of cheese," "coated my
palate with a light cream,"
. .portion of lamb was on the
small side, considering the
price," . .heavily laced with
the orange liqueur"), the true
qualities of the restaurant are
revealed: it presents poorly pre
pared and over-salted dishes in
sauces that are too heavy at
prices that must be considered
outrageous.
If there were company presi
dents there, as suggested by
Leaf (How did he know? Did
they wear name tags?), I sus
pect it was their last visit. My

firm planned a dinner at Au
Chambertin. Our reservations
for a private room, made weeks
in advance, were not honored. It
took over one hour to get our
first course and a second hour to
get our second. The service was
both slow and ungracious
(plates passed over people's
heads, etc.) The soup was so sal
ty as to be inedible. The wine
was marked up far beyond nor
mal levels of comparable res
taurants ($l2-$l5 for a $3.75 bot
tle at retail). In sum, a mi
serable dining experience.
Mr. Leaf also failed to tell
readers that the cooking is not
French, but rather unsubtle
Vietnamese interpretation of
French. With all the excellent
restaurants — especially
French restaurants — in the
area, it would be a shame to
waste both an evening and a siz
able sum of money at Au Cham
bertin.

dents there, as suggested by
Leaf (How did he know? Did
they wear name tags?), I sus
pect it was their last visit. My

firm planned a dinner at Au
Chambertin. Our reservations
for a private room, made weeks
in advance, were not honored. It
took over one hour to get our
first course and a second hour to
get our second. The service was
both slow and ungracious
(plates passed over people's
heads, etc.) The soup was so sal
ty as to be inedible. The wine
was marked up far beyond nor
mal levels of comparable res
taurants ($l2-$l5 for a $3.75 bot
tle at retail). In sum, a mi
serable dining experience.
Mr. Leaf also failed to tell
readers that the cooking is not
French, but rather unsubtle
Vietnamese interpretation of
French. With all the excellent
restaurants — especially
French restaurants — in the
area, it would be a shame to
waste both an evening and a siz
able sum of money at Au Cham
bertin.
