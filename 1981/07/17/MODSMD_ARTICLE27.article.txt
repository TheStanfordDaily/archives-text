# Spend a Sunday at the best of the best
## 
### Heather Baird 
Sundays in San Francisco are
when the City shows its heart
most readily. After the glamour
of the night before with its jostl
ing crowds and honking horns,
Ghirardelli Square and Pier 39
process tourists as usual and the
rest of the City lies calm. It
stretches out, waiting to be dis
covered, like a cat waiting to be
petted, already beginning to
purr with pleasure.
To see what the residents love
most about their home, set aside
an entire Sunday to hang out
where they hang out. Sundays
are best spent in twos or threes.
You can see more, move more
spontaneously, and blend into
the ambience of the City's fa
vorite places.
A few accessories are a must:

tion may be your best activity
guide â€” it's current and thor
ough; bring plenty of quarters
for jukeboxes and bus fare (50
cents); and don't forget good
walking shoes and a map.
The best Sunday mornings be
gin in the cafes. San Francis
cans use their cafes as a retreat
from an often frantic and crazy
world. People preoccupy them
selves with reading, drawing,
writing, staring out the window,
or commenting on what ev
eryone else is doing. Conversa
tions are like those struck up in
a library across a table. Bar
gawking disappears and people
are relaxed, congenial and ac
cessible.
A cafe is also a great place to
eavesdrop. The best ones have a
homey, lived in feeling, rather
than flourescent lights and cold
formica. The chairs are
wooden, often mistmatched,
and there are lots of them at ev
ery table. They play good music
and display a lot of local art.

For the best of the best,
where the locals like to mingle,
try:
Cafe Trieste, 609 Vallejo. It's
the most popular cafe in North
Beach (the Italian section
around the comer from Carol
Doda's blinking lights), where
aspiring poets and leftover ar
tists, as well as some successful
authors, discuss the esoterics of
UFOs and pastel paints. Punks
show up frequently here and the
giant picture windows warm up
from lots of sun and place you
nearly on top of the sidewalk.
You could possibly make eye
contact with all of San Francis
co by sitting here long enough.
Only opera on the Jukebox, and
all Italian at that. Use the caf
fein buzz to march straight up
Vallejo and see the City's stun
ning urban landscape of people

and cars.
Mario's Cigar Store, A Bohe
mian Cafe, on Columbus and
Kearny.lt's been there for ages
and is just as comfortable as oid
leather on soft shoes. Mario,
who serves pastries if you're
hungry, knows his customers by
name; they all live in the neigh
borhood. Across the street is
Washington Square, a friendly
park where older folks chat for
hours after mass. You will also
find it a good place to do
cartwheels after you've had too
many cappucinos.
Cafe La Boheme, 3318 24th
Street (In the Mission) Lots of
people reading lots of news
papers sitting in lots of sunlight
spend their Sunday mornings
here. Spanish spoken on the
streets outside.
Mission Blue Cafe, corner of
Folsom and Bessie. A collec
tively run neighborhood gather
ing place, there are lots of pub
lic announcements posted here.
It's in an old Victorian on anoth

er good hill for view-climbing.
La Petit Cafe, 2164 Larkin
(Russian Hill) and Acme, 3917
24th Street (Noe Valley) These
are in the rare breed of new
cafes which figured out how to
make themselves feel lived in.
Light colored wood makes them
both feel warm and inviting.
Books to browse in at La Petit.
Blue checkered tablecloths at
Acme.
After lollygagging your morn
ing out watching people and
reading the paper, it's time to
choose the day's entertain
ments. Here's a few that can't
be missed:
Stern Grove is an outdoor am
phitheater on 19th Avenue
nestled in among the eucalyptus
trees. Every Sunday at 2 p.m.
they have FREE summer con
certs, ranging from the San
Francisco Ballet and Sym
phony, to our own local Back in
the Saddle. Not only is the enter
tainment first rate, the au
dience is there to have a ball.
Pick up a bottle of wine and
roast chicken at a grocery store
for an instant high class picnic.
You have only one more week
to see the Tiffany exhibit a t the
De Young Museum in Golden
Gate Park. Residents go back
for seconds on viewing, and the
De Young has it's very own out
door cafe for reflecting on Luis
Tiffany's genius with glass.
Plus on Sundays, the park is
closed to cars and you can rent
bikes, skates and even rowboats
to play in the park.
The entire Phillips collection
of Impressionism from Wash
ington D.C. is at the Palace of
the Legion of Honor in Lincoln
Park. Exquisite.
For the die-hard beer and
burger set, the deck of the Mis
sion Rock Resort on the water at
817 China Basin Road is one
more intriguing place to hang
out for an afternoon, along with
fishermen, punks, old ladies and
young lovers.
As late afternoon lolls along,
it may be time for tea or coffee.
Surprisingly enough the real
deals are the St. Francis Hotel
and the Stanford Court Hotel
which serve tea for free in their
lobbies around 4 p.m.
The Grand Piano, 1672 Haight
Street and The Clarion, 2118
Mission, are both like being in
someone's living room. They
have classical music, large din
ing room tables, sofas and little
nooks and crannies from which

you can peer out.
If you want some really bright
colors and flashier pace,The
Cafe Flore, 2298 Market offers a
commanding view of the South
of Market/Castro street gay

Stern Grove is an outdoor amphitheater on
19th Ave. nestled in among the eucalyptus
trees. Every Sunday at 2 p.m., they have free
summer concerts, ranging from the San
Francisco Ballet and Symphony to Back in
the Saddle.

scene, as does a stroll up Polk
Street, north of O'Farrell.
Dinner on a Sunday should be

relaxed, not cost too much, and
taste good, say local con
noisseurs. Little Joes, 325 Co
lumbus Ave. has a line coming
out the door any evening of the
week. Go early. Dress casually.

One dish is enough to satisfy two
moderate appetites.
The Chestnut Street Bar and
Grill, 2231 Chestnut, serves
many kinds of hot and cold sand
wiches, and the kind of good
food your grandmother cooks on
Sundays: pork chops, canneloni,
Irish Stew. The bar is delightful,
and there's quite a few more
pubs down the street.
The Bookplate, 2080 Chestnut,
is a cafe and bookstore which
serves simple meals of soups,
salads and crepes, often with a
classical guitarist strumming
away as you sip, nibble or read.
For the most comfortable
nightlife for gearing up to face
Monday, try Bajones, 1062
Valencia, for good jazz; Ivan
Alexanders, 1981 Union Street,
for soul music; Gullivers Pub,
348 Columbus, for loud music;
The Rite Spot, 2099 Folsom, for
the best juke box (they serve
dinner too); and the book
browsing scene at City Lights
Bookstore, 261 Columbus Ave
nue the cornerstone of North
Beach arts.
If you still have energy for one
last glimpse, one of the last
native strongholds is Marina
Safeway, 15 Marina Boulevard.
After 10:30 p.m., popcorn,
peanut butter popcorn, peanut
butter and Ferrier have been
the basis of many a meani
ngful relationship.
Where did you say you lived
again?


The Marina is another place tourists often miss; happy Sundays are often spent by natives flying kites, running the parcourse or simply
strolling by the water, relaxing and enjoying the sights.


It's shipped and sold all over the world, but to find the original
Bud's Ice Cream, you have to go to 24th and Castro Street in the City.
Lines often wind around the corner and half way up the street. . .rain
or shine.
