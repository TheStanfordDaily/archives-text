# 'Let's just...' is no way to see The City
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
"Let's go to the City."
All of us have heard it. Most of
us have said it. The lucky among
us have done it. So it only fol
lows that if you take four Daily
staffers, one of them a native
San Franciscan to boot, and
wave a "work day" in the City in
front of their faces, presto! You
get an instant travel guide,
right?
Well, not quite.
This is the story of a common
experience among those who
venture to Baghdad by the Bay
— best termed "let's just go and
see what happens."
Surprisingly enough, San
Francisco is the kind of City you
can approach with a theme in
mind, for instance galleries or
neighborhoods or Irish pubs, but
you can also wander around
aimlessly and still have a good
time. And, almost without fail,
the experiences you have will
surprise you, whether they in
volve people or places or some
of the City's things.
Looking back, I think we all
piled into the little red Datsun
and tooled up 280 with the idea
that the City would unfold
before us like the pink section of
Sunday's Examiner/Chronicle
But unfortunately from the
start we suffered from a lack of
focus. Did we want to do one of
the proverbial "things only the
natives know about" pieces; or
perhaps "fun you can have in
the city on the cheap"; or rather
should we try to give readers an
overview, stopping briefly in

different neighborhoods and
general areas of the city like
downtown, north beach, the
mission, the park?
The closer we got to the City,
the more we began to realize
that we had some decisions to
make (freeway offramps have
that funny effect on motorists).
"I know this great place on
Lombard where you can get ter
rific hamburgers and see some
local color," chirped the native.
Ah, at last a concrete sugges
tion and direction. We followed
Van Ness Avenue past the car
showrooms, took a left on Lom
bard — no not the crooked part
— past the hundreds of motels,
and as fate would have it, there
was a parking space across the

street from Clown Alley, the
open 24 hour home of the almost
perfect hamburger.
We ordered some of those
near-perfect specials (each less
than $2.00 and they really are
good), bought a 6-pack of beer to

go with them at a local grocery
store (a move which Carl later
tagged "a tactical error") and
headed for the pond in front of
the Palace of Fine Arts around
the corner to plan our day.
The first part of our musings
centered on how good the $21.00
lunch for four was that we had
just bought. What's that, you
say, I though the place was good
and cheap . . . isn't that kind of
high for hamburgers? Well, yes
and no.
You see, in our excitement
over finding a parking place we
neglected the small matter of
putting change in the parking
meter — thanks to Governor
Jerry Brown, that added a $10.00
tax to our otherwise cheap

meal.
(Editors note: If you get no
other salient information from
this story, at least take heed to
this advice — be careful where
and how you park. Since propo
sition 13 dented the budget a
bit, the city has raised parking
violation fines and steeped up
efforts to tag offenders. The
minimum ticket is $10.00.)
The Palace houses the Ex
ploratorium — a full day's
project in itself which offers a
veritable scientific amusement
park to intrigue every age group
and scientific inclination. The
park in front offered a lovely
backdrop for a midday meal, as
well as prompted a whatever of
largely unappetizing jokes
about the pigeons and various
smells which wafted by.
Okay, what are we going to
do. We were still on the fence be
tween neighborhood reviews
and an on the cheap guide.
"Let's just (famous last words)
go to the Legion of Honor right
now," someone suggested.
So, aided by the native's con
sistently poor sense of direc
tion, we drove around, got lost
but eventually got on the right
track, turned and parked in
front of the Legion. A beautiful

ocean view opened before us.
However the entrance fee to the
Impressionist exhibit was rath
er steep we thought, and in the
generally cheapskate journal
istic tradition, we decided even
before we discovered it was
closed that we could just get in
formation. We never really
got that but we did waste time
playing around the statues.
Again the native chirped,
"How about the Cliff House!"
"Yes, great, I've never been
there, said Julie."l hear they've
got fake rocks on the side of the
mountain near there because
the real ones were gong to fall
So we followed Geary to the
Cliff House. For a short time as
we wound around the Great
Highway which passes in front
of the Cliff House, we
speculated on just which rocks
were fake . . soon we knew for
sure. They actually have about
the same subtlety as a Dis
neyland ride backdrop.
We popped into the Cliff
House along with busloads of
tourists, sat down and decided
we weren't getting anywhere.
But the view was great, the
drinks relatively cheap (about
$1.50) and we fooled around
some more. Repeatedly.
"We really must get or

ganized," we said. After a round
of drinks, another Greyhound
had unloaded in front and a
hoard of leisure suits and chil
dren in t-shirts proclaiming
"San Bernadino is for lovers"
and"I got hissed at the Idaho
snake pit"
"Let's just (oh no, here we go
again) go downtown and see
what happens," said Carl im
mediately set upon by the
frenzied driver and unfairly ver-

ingredients: the fresh peach had a fresh peach, Bud\s

bally assaulted and lectured on
the horrors of downtown and
Union Square parking.
Finally we did go to the
Vorpal gallery downtown. A
beautiful gallery off of Grove
Street about a block up north of
Davies Hall. It featured a
Jesse Allen exhibit. The sur
realistic paintings seemed quite
appropriate considering some
of the classic San Francisco

sights we had seen along the
way along Castro and Market
streets.
Suddenly we realized, we only
had time for one more thing . . .
what to do.
"Let's just" (I swear I'm
going to scream at the next per
son who says that,") yelled the
driver). By this time the
tacitical error of the lunchtime
beers' mellowing effect which
made decision-making rubbery,
was giving way to late afternoon
crankiness which made decision

making irritation-laced.
However, the adage, when all
else fails, eat consumed us and
we found ourselves magically
transported to the original
Bud's Ice Cream on 24th and
Castro Streets in the City's Noe
Valley. You can debate the mer
its of Swensen's or Yogurt Vil
lage or Sally's or Baskin Rob
bins or wherever you go to sat
isy your late-night ice cream
fetishes, but we concurred for

once on our trip and "let's just"
say the ice cream was superb.
Still costing $.75 for one
scoop, Bud's cones are bigger
than any you will get around
here, the ice cream is hand
packed with the best ingre
dients; the fresh peach had a
fresh peach, Bud's Oreo Cookie
flavor made you want to screw
the top off the cone and scrape
out the filling and Carl had a

sundae with all the extras which
could dash to pieces the
willpower of even the most ar
dent dieter.
As we walked back to the car,
we made a startling discovery
— we had had a great time! De
spite the lack of planning, lack
of focus to our meanderings,
lack of anything coherent to say
about anything we had done, we
had had a great time!
"But how do we write a story
about what we did?" I asked.
"Well, let's just say. .

largely unappetizing jokes
about the pigeons and various
smells which wafted by.
Okay, what are we going to
do. We were still on the fence be
tween neighborhood reviews
and an on the cheap guide.
"Let's just (famous last words)
go to the Legion of Honor right
now," someone suggested.
So, aided by the native's con
sistently poor sense of direc
tion, we drove around, got lost
but eventually got on the right
track, turned and parked in
front of the Legion. A beautiful

ocean view opened before us.
However the entrance fee to the
Impressionist exhibit was rath
er steep we thought, and in the
generally cheapskate journal
istic tradition, we decided even
before we discovered it was
closed that we could just get in
formation. We never really
got that but we did waste time
playing around the statues.
Again the native chirped,
"How about the Cliff House!"
"Yes, great, I've never been
there, said Julie."l hear they've
got fake rocks on the side of the
mountain near there because
the real ones were gong to fall
So we followed Geary to the
Cliff House. For a short time as
we wound around the Great
Highway which passes in front
of the Cliff House, we
speculated on just which rocks
were fake . . soon we knew for
sure. They actually have about
the same subtlety as a Dis
neyland ride backdrop.
We popped into the Cliff
House along with busloads of
tourists, sat down and decided
we weren't getting anywhere.
But the view was great, the
drinks relatively cheap (about
$1.50) and we fooled around
some more. Repeatedly.
"We really must get or

ganized," we said. After a round
of drinks, another Greyhound
had unloaded in front and a
hoard of leisure suits and chil
dren in t-shirts proclaiming
"San Bernadino is for lovers"
and"I got hissed at the Idaho
snake pit"
"Let's just (oh no, here we go

the horrors of downtown and

Finally we did go to the
Vorpal gallery downtown. A
beautiful gallery off of Grove
Street about a block up north of
Davies Hall. It featured a
Jesse Allen exhibit. The sur
realistic paintings seemed quite
appropriate considering some
of the classic San Francisco

sights we had seen along the
way along Castro and Market
streets.
Suddenly we realized, we only
had time for one more thing . . .
what to do.
"Let's just" (I swear I'm
going to scream at the next per
son who says that,") yelled the
driver). By this time the
tacitical error of the lunchtime
beers' mellowing effect which
made decision-making rubbery,
was giving way to late afternoon
crankiness which made decision

making irritation-laced.
However, the adage, when all
else fails, eat consumed us and
we found ourselves magically
transported to the original
Bud's Ice Cream on 24th and
Castro Streets in the City's Noe
Valley. You can debate the mer

say the ice cream was superb.

could dash to pieces the
willpower of even the most ar
dent dieter.
As we walked back to the car,
we made a startling discovery
— we had had a great time! De
spite the lack of planning, lack
of focus to our meanderings,
lack of anything coherent to say
about anything we had done, we
had had a great time!
"But how do we write a story
about what we did?" I asked.
"Well, let's just say. .

"Let's go to the City."
All of us have heard it. Most of
us have said it. The lucky among
us have done it. So it only fol
lows that if you take four Daily
staffers, one of them a native
San Franciscan to boot, and
wave a "work day" in the City in
front of their faces, presto! You
get an instant travel guide,
right?
Well, not quite.
This is the story of a common
experience among those who
venture to Baghdad by the Bay
— best termed "let's just go and
see what happens."
Surprisingly enough, San
Francisco is the kind of City you
can approach with a theme in
mind, for instance galleries or
neighborhoods or Irish pubs, but
you can also wander around
aimlessly and still have a good
time. And, almost without fail,
the experiences you have will
surprise you, whether they in
volve people or places or some
of the City's things.
Looking back, I think we all
piled into the little red Datsun
and tooled up 280 with the idea
that the City would unfold
before us like the pink section of
Sunday's Examiner/Chronicle
But unfortunately from the
start we suffered from a lack of
focus. Did we want to do one of
the proverbial "things only the
natives know about" pieces; or
perhaps "fun you can have in
the city on the cheap"; or rather
should we try to give readers an
overview, stopping briefly in

different neighborhoods and
general areas of the city like
downtown, north beach, the
mission, the park?
The closer we got to the City,
the more we began to realize
that we had some decisions to
make (freeway offramps have
that funny effect on motorists).
"I know this great place on
Lombard where you can get ter
rific hamburgers and see some
local color," chirped the native.
Ah, at last a concrete sugges
tion and direction. We followed
Van Ness Avenue past the car
showrooms, took a left on Lom
bard — no not the crooked part
— past the hundreds of motels,
and as fate would have it, there
was a parking space across the

street from Clown Alley, the
open 24 hour home of the almost
perfect hamburger.
We ordered some of those
near-perfect specials (each less
than $2.00 and they really are
good), bought a 6-pack of beer to

go with them at a local grocery
store (a move which Carl later
tagged "a tactical error") and
headed for the pond in front of
the Palace of Fine Arts around
the corner to plan our day.
The first part of our musings
centered on how good the $21.00
lunch for four was that we had
just bought. What's that, you
say, I though the place was good
and cheap . . . isn't that kind of
high for hamburgers? Well, yes
and no.
You see, in our excitement
over finding a parking place we
neglected the small matter of
putting change in the parking
meter — thanks to Governor
Jerry Brown, that added a $10.00
tax to our otherwise cheap

meal.
(Editors note: If you get no
other salient information from
this story, at least take heed to
this advice — be careful where
and how you park. Since propo
sition 13 dented the budget a
bit, the city has raised parking
violation fines and steeped up
efforts to tag offenders. The
minimum ticket is $10.00.)
The Palace houses the Ex
ploratorium — a full day's
project in itself which offers a
veritable scientific amusement
park to intrigue every age group
and scientific inclination. The
park in front offered a lovely
backdrop for a midday meal, as
well as prompted a whatever of
largely unappetizing jokes
about the pigeons and various
smells which wafted by.
Okay, what are we going to

"Let's go to the City."
All of us have heard it. Most of
us have said it. The lucky among
us have done it. So it only fol
lows that if you take four Daily
staffers, one of them a native
San Franciscan to boot, and
wave a "work day" in the City in
front of their faces, presto! You
get an instant travel guide,
right?
Well, not quite.
This is the story of a common
experience among those who
venture to Baghdad by the Bay
— best termed "let's just go and
see what happens."
Surprisingly enough, San
Francisco is the kind of City you
can approach with a theme in
mind, for instance galleries or
neighborhoods or Irish pubs, but
you can also wander around
aimlessly and still have a good
time. And, almost without fail,
the experiences you have will
surprise you, whether they in
volve people or places or some
of the City's things.
Looking back, I think we all
piled into the little red Datsun
and tooled up 280 with the idea
that the City would unfold
before us like the pink section of
Sunday's Examiner/Chronicle
But unfortunately from the
start we suffered from a lack of
focus. Did we want to do one of
the proverbial "things only the
natives know about" pieces; or
perhaps "fun you can have in
the city on the cheap"; or rather
should we try to give readers an
overview, stopping briefly in

different neighborhoods and
general areas of the city like
downtown, north beach, the
mission, the park?
The closer we got to the City,
the more we began to realize
that we had some decisions to
make (freeway offramps have
that funny effect on motorists).
"I know this great place on
Lombard where you can get ter
rific hamburgers and see some
local color," chirped the native.
Ah, at last a concrete sugges
tion and direction. We followed
Van Ness Avenue past the car
showrooms, took a left on Lom
bard — no not the crooked part
— past the hundreds of motels,
and as fate would have it, there
was a parking space across the

street from Clown Alley, the
open 24 hour home of the almost
perfect hamburger.
We ordered some of those
near-perfect specials (each less
than $2.00 and they really are
good), bought a 6-pack of beer to

go with them at a local grocery
store (a move which Carl later
tagged "a tactical error") and
headed for the pond in front of
the Palace of Fine Arts around
the corner to plan our day.
The first part of our musings
centered on how good the $21.00
lunch for four was that we had
just bought. What's that, you
say, I though the place was good
and cheap . . . isn't that kind of
high for hamburgers? Well, yes
and no.
You see, in our excitement
over finding a parking place we
neglected the small matter of
putting change in the parking
meter — thanks to Governor
Jerry Brown, that added a $10.00
tax to our otherwise cheap

meal.
(Editors note: If you get no
other salient information from
this story, at least take heed to
this advice — be careful where
and how you park. Since propo
sition 13 dented the budget a
bit, the city has raised parking
violation fines and steeped up
efforts to tag offenders. The
minimum ticket is $10.00.)
The Palace houses the Ex
ploratorium — a full day's
project in itself which offers a
veritable scientific amusement
park to intrigue every age group
and scientific inclination. The
park in front offered a lovely
backdrop for a midday meal, as
well as prompted a whatever of
largely unappetizing jokes
about the pigeons and various
smells which wafted by.
Okay, what are we going to
do. We were still on the fence be
tween neighborhood reviews
and an on the cheap guide.
"Let's just (famous last words)
go to the Legion of Honor right
now," someone suggested.
So, aided by the native's con
sistently poor sense of direc
tion, we drove around, got lost
but eventually got on the right
track, turned and parked in
front of the Legion. A beautiful

ocean view opened before us.
However the entrance fee to the
Impressionist exhibit was rath
er steep we thought, and in the
generally cheapskate journal
istic tradition, we decided even
before we discovered it was
closed that we could just get in
formation. We never really
got that but we did waste time
playing around the statues.
Again the native chirped,
"How about the Cliff House!"
"Yes, great, I've never been
there, said Julie."l hear they've
got fake rocks on the side of the
mountain near there because
the real ones were gong to fall
So we followed Geary to the
Cliff House. For a short time as
we wound around the Great
Highway which passes in front
of the Cliff House, we
speculated on just which rocks
were fake . . soon we knew for
sure. They actually have about
the same subtlety as a Dis
neyland ride backdrop.
We popped into the Cliff
House along with busloads of
tourists, sat down and decided
we weren't getting anywhere.
But the view was great, the
drinks relatively cheap (about
$1.50) and we fooled around
some more. Repeatedly.
"We really must get or

ganized," we said. After a round
of drinks, another Greyhound
had unloaded in front and a
hoard of leisure suits and chil
dren in t-shirts proclaiming
"San Bernadino is for lovers"
and"I got hissed at the Idaho
snake pit"
"Let's just (oh no, here we go
again) go downtown and see
what happens," said Carl im
mediately set upon by the
frenzied driver and unfairly ver-

bally assaulted and lectured on
the horrors of downtown and
Union Square parking.
Finally we did go to the
Vorpal gallery downtown. A
beautiful gallery off of Grove
Street about a block up north of
Davies Hall. It featured a
Jesse Allen exhibit. The sur
realistic paintings seemed quite
appropriate considering some
of the classic San Francisco

sights we had seen along the
way along Castro and Market
streets.
Suddenly we realized, we only
had time for one more thing . . .
what to do.
"Let's just" (I swear I'm
going to scream at the next per
son who says that,") yelled the
driver). By this time the
tacitical error of the lunchtime
beers' mellowing effect which
made decision-making rubbery,
was giving way to late afternoon
crankiness which made decision

making irritation-laced.
However, the adage, when all
else fails, eat consumed us and
we found ourselves magically
transported to the original
Bud's Ice Cream on 24th and
Castro Streets in the City's Noe
Valley. You can debate the mer
its of Swensen's or Yogurt Vil
lage or Sally's or Baskin Rob
bins or wherever you go to sat
isy your late-night ice cream
fetishes, but we concurred for

once on our trip and "let's just"
say the ice cream was superb.
Still costing $.75 for one
scoop, Bud's cones are bigger
than any you will get around
here, the ice cream is hand
packed with the best ingre
