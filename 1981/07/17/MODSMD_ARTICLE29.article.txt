# Clean-cut Dartmouth Club — S.F.'s prep place
## 
### Heather Baird 
On the corner of Filmore and
Greenwich Avenues in San
Francisco squats the Balboa
Cafe, a low white bar with green
trim and a green neon light
hanging over the corner of the
sidewalk. Months ago it was the
"in" piace to be on a Friday
night in San Francisco, with

wall to wall men and women
with loosened ties, jackets slung
over shoulders, and dresses
with varying heights and depths
of slits.
But of late the Balboa's popu
larity has flickered like its
neons and this week it's "out."
Officially — or so says San
Franrisri) magazine. Its patrons
have shed their evening dress
and donned chino pants and polo
shirts to go skipping chummily
in their topsider shoes across
the street to the Dartmouth So
cial Club.

chatting about the stock market
over light gin and tonics.
If the Dartmouth Club's clien
tele were 17 years old and
playing dress-up, we might
laugh. But they're not; they
range in age from newly 21 to
the mid-life crisis set.
The atmosphere inside is a
cross between a pool hall, a
school cafeteria and an ice
cream parlor. It is large and
brightly lit — very brightly lit.
It is loud, with laughter and the
resounding blump of glasses on
the oak tables bouncing about

the green plastic lampshades
and the menus posted on pillars.
Preppie is comfortable. To be
clean cut, fresh scrubbed and
wearing the right clothes is to be
accepted, a part of the group.
The ultimate in preppie dress
ing is not to be as unique as pos
sible, or eccentric, or ex
travagant. It's not even to deftly
arrange parts of the preppie
look with other ways of dress
ing. The highest fashion a prep
pie can achieve is to have as
many pieces of the preppie uni
form on at one time as possible.
Across the hatless heads and
ribboned pony tails of the
Dartmouth, on the far side of
the room, hangs a gleaming
Harley Davidson motorcycle.
During the '60s it was the road
worn sign of a flamboyant indi
vidualism looking for new ideas
for a world it wasn't happy with.
The preppie set regards it as a

piece of expensive art, paying
homage to a time gone by, infer
ring that the time at hand is
more meaningful, if only be
cause it's more lucrative.
Humanitarian concerns have
never made a lot of money, but
they demand that people ask
questions. The preppie fad is lin

ing its followers up with money
and silence.
Like the Harley, the questions
which monitor society would be
better off back in circulation
Preppie needs to fragment. Per
haps they could start by wearing
purple, and turning down the
lights at the Dartmouth Social
Club. That way at least no one
would notice that everybody's
wearing the same thing.
