# Post ace explains Asian policy
## 
### Karl Schoenberger 
Washington Post State De
partment correspondent Donald
Oberdorfer told a handful of
Asia scholars at Stanford's Hoo
ver Pavilion Tuesday, that
while the Beagan adminis
tration may not have a "but
toned-down, thought-through
and calculated" strategy for
Asia, it has established "broad
global policies" which serve as
general policy orientation for
the Asian sphere.
Oberdorfer, who travelled
with Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig on his 16 day trip to
China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations

(ASEAN) conference in Manila
this June, summarized these
global policies as the "over
arching anti-Sovietism" of the
* administration, a "greater em
phasis on the military and se
curity aspects" of international
relationships, and a greater
degree of "ecnomic na
tionalism" with cuts in aid pro
grams
In keeping with a tradition he
called the "pendulum swing of
American foreign policy," the
Reagan administration has re
acted to Jimmy Carter's foreign
policy by removing many of the
restraints against arm sales and
downgrading the importance of

human rights, he said.
"This global orientation
translates into policy decisions
and responses to particular situ
ations in the Asian arena," said
the former Post Japan cor
respondent and Vietnam press
corps veteran.
Secretary Haig's trip to China
was most important because of
Haig's announcement during
the trip that the U.S. would con
sider selling arms to the main
land Chinese.
While the military terms of
the arm sales decision are yet to
be resolved, it has profound im
portance in diplomatic and po
litical terms, changing China
from the status of an enemy to
what Haig referred to as a
"close friend" of the U.S.,
Oberdorfer said.
"But despite all the rhetoric
about the Soviet threat, the Chi
nese have msde large scale re
ductions in their military
budget, cutting it by around 20
percent over the past year in fa
vor of their modernization pro
gram," he pointed out.

Haig responded to this fact by
telling the press that the admin
istration understands that
"each country has to have its
own pattern of development,"
but that it does not necessarily
"have to agree with it,"
Oberdorfer said.
Following the China visit,
Secretary Haig and his en
tourage of aides, secret ser
vicemen and reporters, includ
ing Oberdorfer, went to Manila
for the ASEAN conference,

where tensions over possible
arms sales to China doming ted.
The Southeast Asians sought as
surances that the U.S. had no in
tention of stepping back from
the region after building up
Japan and China as military
surrogates.
Vietnam and Cambodia re
main the focal point of tension
and conflict in the area, and, ac
cording to Oberdorfer, Haig's
remarks to the ASEAN con
ference were "explicitly anti-
Vietnamese."
