# Xerox costs double

Just as the days of the penny
gumball are gone, so are the
days of the five cent xerox copy
at Stanford.
Effective July 1, a single copy
from the new Copico machines
in the libraries increased from
five to 10 cents. According to
Dick Smith, assistant director
of libraries, the University li
braries were in the position of
operating at a loss or raising the
price to ten cents a copy when
the Xerox machine contract
ended June 30. No company
would accept the contract for

five cents, but Copico offered
the cheapest system, he said.
Purchase of a copicard, a small
plastic card which contains a
magnetic strip programmed
with the number of copies
purchased, offers an alternative
less expensive than coin
payment through sliding
payment. Copies are made by
inserting the card into the ma
chine, selecting the number of
copies needed and printing the
print button. The machine auto
matically subtracts the number
of copies from the value on the
card.
