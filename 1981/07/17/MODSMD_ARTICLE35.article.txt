Clash of the Titan****
Park Theater, Menlo Park
The acting is wooden and the
mythology suspect, but the special
effects, and the set pieces involv
ing them, are often magical. They
were created by Ray Har
ryhausen, the man who did the ef
fects for Jason and the Argonauts.
Harryhausen is the cinema's
greatest practitioner of. stop-mo
tion animation, the same tech
nique that made the eighteen-inch
high King Kong threaten New
York. Harryhausen's puppet char
acters in Clash of the Titans in
clude a flying horse and, most
spectacularly, a Medusa that
would do any monster-maker
proud. This movie should be great
for kids: it's heroic and not too vi
olent.
— Jim Mattson
Superman II
Menlo Cinema. Menlo Park
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the original;
it will usually delight those who
found the original's smart-alecky
second half more appealing. Rich
ard Lester (A Hard Day's Night,
The Three Musketeers) directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
book punch that moves it along as
speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
peats his role as the man of steel,
Margot Kidder is. once again, a
sassy, sexy Lois Lane.

Take the Honey and Run***
Sunday. Memorial Auditorium
A haphazard movie filled
haphazardly with haphazard
jokes. Woody Allen plays a mild
mannered bank robber driven to
ruin by bad penmanship. Obvious
ly. there's a lot here we can all
identify with. Take the Money and
Run is often instructive, and more
often it's funny, which makes it a
pretty good way to spend Sunday
evening.
- J.M.

The Great Santini **
Fox, Redwood City
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so good ... but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
%ith Ordinary People.

The Canterbury lales
Fox. Redwood Citv
Pier Paolo Pa'solini directed
this version of Chaucer's master
work with an eye for scatological
detail. Pasoloni. Incredibly, seems
to have missed Chaucer's best
jokes, and what he presents is fp
neither Illuminating nor funny.
This movie makes Chaucer seem
like a writer of Cliff's Notes far
those whose chosen medium is m
bathroom walls. If you need a re
fresher course in flatulent humor,
this isthe movie for you. If not, you
might lfke to consider spending
Some time with the original.
Plays next Tuesday and
Wednesday with Pasolini's The
Arabian Nights.

Ordinary
This movie puts its tasteful, Icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn Some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num- 112
bers. Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never finest
you feel that you've really cap-|
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the 3TI
script tends to squeeze the life »
right out of this picture. Redford is
better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayaLpf the
troubled youth is especially good.

History of the World, Part One
Old Mill. Mountain View
History is receiving more
criticism than any other Mel
Brooks film for its tastelessness.
It's tasteless, all right — the au
dience I saw it with greeted the
Spanish Inquisition sequence with
hostile murmurs of protest — but,
worse than trot, it's simply not all
that fanny. We've all heard
Brooks' fart jokes and Jew jokes
and queer Jokes before, and he
doesn't seem to think he needs to
add anything to them to make
than fresh enough to laugh at.
Ironically, History may be
Brooks' best looking movie —
maybe he took a summer course in
film composition. Albert
Whitlock s matte work, which
gives Roman skylines to the Studio
back lot, is quite beautiful.
Madeline Kahn, as Nympho.
Nero's empress, gives the movie's
funniest performance.

I perhaps the least sadistic of any

growing tired of the role (or per

"Mhe movie itself — for a terrific,

Raiders of the Lout Ark*

Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the thirties and
forties (it's set in 1936) as well as
the TV serials and comtet of the
fifties. It represents the combined
efforts of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood; Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed; George
Lucas (Star Wars) and Philip
1 Kaufman (Invasion of the Body
Snatchers > wrote the script. It has
been acclaimed by the overwhelm
ing majority of critics as a cliff
hanger classic. But 1 must confess
to a traitorous resistance to all
those good vibrations: { didn't
care for the movie very much.
Raid' r s achieves a weird balance ;
it's exciting on the surface but dull
at its center. For all the hypeabout
its adolescent boys' tale spirit, 1
could discern none of It. Raiders
was made in acquisitive spirit; it's

This movie puts its tasteful, Icy

you're there to really learn Some

practicing catharsis by the num- 112

in crisis, the movie never finest
you feel that you've really cap-|

Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master

often it's funny, which makes it a
pretty good way to spend Sunday

The Great Santini **
Fox, Redwood City
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so good ... but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
%ith Ordinary People.

The Canterbury lales
Fox. Redwood Citv
Pier Paolo Pa'solini directed
this version of Chaucer's master
work with an eye for scatological
detail. Pasoloni. Incredibly, seems
to have missed Chaucer's best
jokes, and what he presents is fp
neither Illuminating nor funny.
This movie makes Chaucer seem
like a writer of Cliff's Notes far
those whose chosen medium is m
bathroom walls. If you need a re
fresher course in flatulent humor,
this isthe movie for you. If not, you
might lfke to consider spending
Some time with the original.
Plays next Tuesday and
Wednesday with Pasolini's The
Arabian Nights.

Ordinary
This movie puts its tasteful, Icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn Some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num- 112
bers. Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never finest
you feel that you've really cap-|
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the 3TI
script tends to squeeze the life »
right out of this picture. Redford is
better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayaLpf the
troubled youth is especially good.
With Mary Tyler Moore and
Donald Sutherland^?*®
Plays tonight ami tomorrow
with TV 112 in:at Santini

History of the World, Part One
Old Mill. Mountain View
History is receiving more
criticism than any other Mel
Brooks film for its tastelessness.
It's tasteless, all right — the au
dience I saw it with greeted the
Spanish Inquisition sequence with
hostile murmurs of protest — but,
worse than trot, it's simply not all
that fanny. We've all heard
Brooks' fart jokes and Jew jokes
and queer Jokes before, and he
doesn't seem to think he needs to
add anything to them to make
than fresh enough to laugh at.
Ironically, History may be
Brooks' best looking movie —
maybe he took a summer course in
film composition. Albert
Whitlock s matte work, which
gives Roman skylines to the Studio
back lot, is quite beautiful.
Madeline Kahn, as Nympho.
Nero's empress, gives the movie's
funniest performance.

For Your £y«* Only **
Palo Alto Square M
This Bond movie's limited am
not as bloated as ex
travaganza (Moonraker) and it's
I perhaps the least sadistic of any
Bond movie - which doesn't
mean, of coarse, that it's not
sadistic, Roger Moore seems to be
growing tired of the role (or per
haps he's merely stopped trying:
the producers plan to replace him
with a younger model soon). He
perks up momentarily — as does
"Mhe movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his '
Lotos for a Citroen. If the mov-
O'eniakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the rest
of the film, For Your Ryes-Only
might have passed for entertain
ment instead of an exercise in
cinermtic stasis.

Haskell Wexler, who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect —we've never
been so rinse to these people
| before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) bat it's hard
not to get caught up with thehr en
thusiasm and conceqT SjM
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people. They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. Jackson Browne, the
% Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott
r Herron.
Late show this weekend. pf

The Stunt Man★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the old theme of reality ver
sus illusion, but in an astonishingly
witty new setting. The director,
Hfeltftcd Rush, reverses every au
dience expectation in this
audacious, kinetic comedy about
making movies. Peter oToole
give* an imaginative, self de
lighted performance as Eli Cross,
a filmmaker who revels in risks,
and Steve Railsback plays the
«unt man. The cast also includes
Allen Goorwitz iwho used to be
called Allen Garfield) and
Barbara Hershey (who used to be
called Barbara Hershey Seagull).
Plays tonight only, with Thief.

Raiders of the Lout Ark*
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the thirties and
forties (it's set in 1936) as well as
the TV serials and comtet of the
fifties. It represents the combined
efforts of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood; Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed; George
Lucas (Star Wars) and Philip
1 Kaufman (Invasion of the Body
Snatchers > wrote the script. It has
been acclaimed by the overwhelm
ing majority of critics as a cliff
hanger classic. But 1 must confess
to a traitorous resistance to all
those good vibrations: { didn't
care for the movie very much.
Raid' r s achieves a weird balance ;
it's exciting on the surface but dull
at its center. For all the hypeabout
its adolescent boys' tale spirit, 1
could discern none of It. Raiders
was made in acquisitive spirit; it's
a tradesman's movie.
