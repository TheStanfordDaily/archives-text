# Night's white satin becomes jaded polyester

### Tony Kelly 
I want there to be more
progressive music, really I do.
Honest. I even liked the Moody
Blues for a while — of all people.
Sure, some perhaps most of
their 1960s transcendental pop
was pretentious, but the 60s mu
sic audience had pretty high am
bitions too. And there's no dis
puting that "Tuesday After
noon" and "Nights in White
Satin" are simply great songs.
But now things are different.
The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and
Yes are all dead bands, figur
atively and in some cases liter
ally. Bob Dylan turned 40 May
24. The kids of 1965 who thrilled
to "Go Now" have become pa
rents worried about the musical
heroes of their children.
As for the Moody Blues, not
only are they still around but
they are having the best success
of their careers with a hit single
and a Top 3 selling album, Long
Distance Voyager. Another
death of the 60s theory is shot
down.
But are these the same Moody
Blues? Well, they are the same
people, or most of them — ori
ginal Mellotron doodler Mike
Pinder has split in favor of Pa
trick Moraz who continues his
tour of duty in every
progressive band this side of
Netherworld.
But there's Justin Hayward
still writing most of the songs,
with an occasional assist from
John Lodge.
There's Graeme Edge vague
ly in the distance on drums, car
rying his obligatory one-song
per-album with him (it must be
in his contract) and "Fay" Ray
Thomas helping out on flutes
and harmonicas.
The famous Moody Blues
monolith of sound is still
around, featuring the standard
choirs of deep-voiced angels on

pharmaceuticals.
But there's something else
stowed away with the Moodies
on Long Distance Voyager,
playing with the band just as
prominently as any regular
member. That something is con
tempt — an obnoxious, elitist
deceit that leaves the listener
not only disappointed, but
cheated.
Voyager is the Moodies' first
album since 1978's Octave,
itself made as a comeback
album for the group. Nothing
wrong here — Eric Clapton
makes comebacks every year,
and no one complains. But the
Moody Blues are so conscious of
their return that their constant
recognition of the fact robs the
LP of any soul it could possibly
have.
The most obvious example of
this newfound arrogance is in
the hit single, "Gemini
Dream." The song absolutely
reeks of Top 40, with the
Moodies' traditional bombast
tranquilized in an ELO-ish dis
co/synth pop fluff — chipmunks
replacing the drugged-out choir
in the chorus.
More disturbingly, the lyrics
celebrate a triumphant return
combined with a condescending
plea for continued recognition:
"Came back for you/Glad to
see/That you came too."
I suppose that purists — a
Moody Blues purist is a dedi
cated soul indeed — could argue
that the lyrics fit in with the
loosely tied concept of a voy
ager's return, but travellers
don't talk about "lights going
up" on the road, stage fright and
"rocking and rolling through the
night."
The Moodies aren't in a good
position to talk about rock and
roll either, but the parallel is too
painfully obvious to ignore.
To make things worse, the

whole album is like that, from
the strident demands of "22,000
Days" (featuring lyrics such as
"This time feel the flow and get
it right" — Werner Erhard, take
notes) to the Ray Thomas suite
closing the LP, "Veteran Cos
mic Rocker." The title of the
last song says more than
enough.
In each and every song, the
smooth-as-satin music fades to
a dull polyester, jaded by the
cynical, demanding lyrics of
Hayward and Lodge that are a
far cry from the early Gidget
goes-metaphysical days of the
Moodies.
And even that wouldn't be so
bad under the right circum
stances. Making a comeback
like the Moody Blues have is an
achievement, and they have the
right to make Long Distance

Voyager an impassioned decla
ration of triumph.
But for some reason, the pro
duction of the record inten
tionally buries every moment of
passion in the songs. "In My
World", a Hayward ballad that
closes Side One, begins with a
weepy guitar that begs for a
drum — a big bad bass drum
that will either save the tune or
blow it all down in the process.
Sure enough, the drum does
come in about halfway through
buried way down in the mix. The
same thing happens to Hay
ward's guitar in "Meanwhile"
and Graeme Edge's vocals in
"22,000 Days."
The production trivializes
emotion, as do the lyrics to
songs like "22,000 Days" — "It's
not a lot". . . hmph. Then there
is Lodge's simple diagnosis of
the cause of a romantic breakup

as "Talking Out of Turn."
The overwhelming indif
ference of the Moody Blues on
the LP implies the real theme of
the album: we may not be wise,
but we're smart, and we got
ours.
Of course, one can't really
deny the Moodies their satisfac
tion of surviving into the 80s and
doing it prosperously.
This is pop music, after all —
you buy the record, bend over,
put it on the turntable, the band
takes it from there, and if you
don't like it we can talk about it.
But because they don't even
bother to claim any other pos
sible explanation for Long Dis
tance Voyager, listening to the
Moody Blues is like hiring a
maid that short-sheets your bed.
Buy Long Distance Voyager
and face north, Jack.

in his contract) and "Fay" Ray
Thomas helping out on flutes
and harmonicas.
The famous Moody Blues
monolith of sound is still
around, featuring the standard
choirs of deep-voiced angels on

pharmaceuticals.
But there's something else
stowed away with the Moodies
on Long Distance Voyager,
playing with the band just as
prominently as any regular
member. That something is con
tempt — an obnoxious, elitist
deceit that leaves the listener
not only disappointed, but
cheated.
Voyager is the Moodies' first
album since 1978's Octave,
itself made as a comeback
album for the group. Nothing
wrong here — Eric Clapton
makes comebacks every year,
and no one complains. But the
Moody Blues are so conscious of
their return that their constant
recognition of the fact robs the
LP of any soul it could possibly
have.
The most obvious example of
this newfound arrogance is in
the hit single, "Gemini
Dream." The song absolutely
reeks of Top 40, with the
Moodies' traditional bombast
tranquilized in an ELO-ish dis
co/synth pop fluff — chipmunks
replacing the drugged-out choir
in the chorus.
More disturbingly, the lyrics
celebrate a triumphant return
combined with a condescending
plea for continued recognition:
"Came back for you/Glad to
see/That you came too."
I suppose that purists — a
Moody Blues purist is a dedi
cated soul indeed — could argue
that the lyrics fit in with the
loosely tied concept of a voy
ager's return, but travellers
don't talk about "lights going
up" on the road, stage fright and
"rocking and rolling through the
night."
The Moodies aren't in a good
position to talk about rock and
roll either, but the parallel is too
painfully obvious to ignore.
To make things worse, the

whole album is like that, from
the strident demands of "22,000
Days" (featuring lyrics such as
"This time feel the flow and get
it right" — Werner Erhard, take
notes) to the Ray Thomas suite
closing the LP, "Veteran Cos
mic Rocker." The title of the
last song says more than
enough.
In each and every song, the
smooth-as-satin music fades to
a dull polyester, jaded by the
cynical, demanding lyrics of
Hayward and Lodge that are a
far cry from the early Gidget
goes-metaphysical days of the
Moodies.
And even that wouldn't be so
bad under the right circum
stances. Making a comeback
like the Moody Blues have is an
achievement, and they have the
right to make Long Distance

Voyager an impassioned decla
ration of triumph.
But for some reason, the pro
duction of the record inten
tionally buries every moment of
passion in the songs. "In My
World", a Hayward ballad that
closes Side One, begins with a
weepy guitar that begs for a
drum — a big bad bass drum
that will either save the tune or
blow it all down in the process.
Sure enough, the drum does
come in about halfway through
buried way down in the mix. The
same thing happens to Hay
ward's guitar in "Meanwhile"
and Graeme Edge's vocals in
"22,000 Days."
The production trivializes
emotion, as do the lyrics to
songs like "22,000 Days" — "It's
not a lot". . . hmph. Then there
is Lodge's simple diagnosis of
the cause of a romantic breakup

as "Talking Out of Turn."
The overwhelming indif
ference of the Moody Blues on
the LP implies the real theme of
the album: we may not be wise,
but we're smart, and we got
ours.
Of course, one can't really
deny the Moodies their satisfac
tion of surviving into the 80s and
doing it prosperously.
This is pop music, after all —
you buy the record, bend over,
put it on the turntable, the band
takes it from there, and if you
don't like it we can talk about it.
But because they don't even
bother to claim any other pos
sible explanation for Long Dis
tance Voyager, listening to the
Moody Blues is like hiring a
maid that short-sheets your bed.
Buy Long Distance Voyager
and face north, Jack.

I want there to be more
progressive music, really I do.
Honest. I even liked the Moody
Blues for a while — of all people.
Sure, some perhaps most of
their 1960s transcendental pop
was pretentious, but the 60s mu
sic audience had pretty high am
bitions too. And there's no dis
puting that "Tuesday After
noon" and "Nights in White
Satin" are simply great songs.
But now things are different.
The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and
Yes are all dead bands, figur
atively and in some cases liter
ally. Bob Dylan turned 40 May
24. The kids of 1965 who thrilled
to "Go Now" have become pa
rents worried about the musical
heroes of their children.
As for the Moody Blues, not
only are they still around but
they are having the best success
of their careers with a hit single
and a Top 3 selling album, Long
Distance Voyager. Another
death of the 60s theory is shot
down.
But are these the same Moody
Blues? Well, they are the same
people, or most of them — ori
ginal Mellotron doodler Mike
Pinder has split in favor of Pa
trick Moraz who continues his
tour of duty in every
progressive band this side of
Netherworld.
But there's Justin Hayward
still writing most of the songs,
with an occasional assist from
John Lodge.
There's Graeme Edge vague
ly in the distance on drums, car
rying his obligatory one-song
per-album with him (it must be
in his contract) and "Fay" Ray
Thomas helping out on flutes
and harmonicas.
