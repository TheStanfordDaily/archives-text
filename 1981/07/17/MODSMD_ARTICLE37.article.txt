## The
						not so proud 'Popover' 
### Joan O'Connell 
Were it only the coffee shop
for an Ethan Allen furniture
store, The Proud Popover res
taurant would be perfect. From
the pseudo-pewter flatware to
the Currier & Ivish portraits on
the wall, it's colonial, conserva
tive and quaint.
Unfortunately, decor does not
a restaurant make. And food as
heavy and blandly spiced as the
maple wood tables on which it's
served, in addition to service de
livered with a colonial tax col
lector's indifference, do not a
good review inspire.
The Proud Popover, located
in the Stanford Shopping Center,
is one of a nationwide chain of
eating establishments. I haven't
seen the others, but this one
seems to have trouble making
up its mind as to just what kind
of restaurant it wants to be. It's
too cramped and inexpensive to
be elegant, yet too pretentious
to be fun.
After being seated I thought
we had been handed a children's
menu by mistake, as cartoon
popovers cavorted about a
puzzling line-up which featured
sweet drinks, fried appetizers-, a
daily special popover selection
(on our night it was chicken
curry) and hearty meat and
potatoes dishes, a good variety
of salads and quiches, deli sand
wiches, ice cream drinks anc

"no id required" desserts.
There had been no mistake,
but the cutesy menu really
didn't fit the surroundings.
While waiting for an order of
potato skins appetizers, we
were asked if we wanted
"drinks or something." Before
we even had a chance to ask for
a wine list — most of the patrons
were drinking the house chablis
or burgundy so there may not
even be one — the wine glasses
were wisked away and we were
advised to have our soup and
salad while waiting for the
"skins cause they take a while
to do."
Main courses are in the $4-6
range and are served with a
choice of clam chowder, a
garden salad or spinach salad.
The clam chowder was quite
salty; the spinach salad was
adequate, as (eventually) were
the skins, but they were nothing
outstanding. Depending on your
appetite, the food can definitely
be described as hearty and safe
ly described as heavy.
As we made our way through
two average sized portions of a
chicken curry popover and a
three-cheese quiche, I imagined
how much more I would enjoy
the meal if there had been an At
lantic stosm blowing outside,
soaking the horse which was
waiting to transport me to the
Old North Church to warn Paul

Revere . . .instead of just a
summer breeze wafting through
Medfly combat zone of the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
The food is not heavily spiced
and I must say the chicken curry
was actually very delicately
done. The quiche, too, was tas
ty, but there was little distinc
tion between the flavor of the
three cheeses — your basic
cheddar, swiss and cream.
The house special, the
popover, was very good. It
added a lot to the chicken curry
and could also be ordered as a
side dish with butter and honey.
At The Proud Popover a fill
ing meal for two can be had for
less than $20, even with'' wine or
something." And I must admit
that while I personally don't en
joy eating and listening to the
life story of other parties seated
at practically abutting tables,
the atmosphere is pleasant, es
pecially near the bar area.
However, it doesn't manage
to pull off what a restaurant like
Marie Callender's does so well,
namely offer a good selection of
tasty food, a fun atmosphere
and an excellent specialty.
While the thought of French ap
ple or strawberry cream pies
might safely carry you over just
about anything, popovers on the
side just don't have the same ef
fect.
