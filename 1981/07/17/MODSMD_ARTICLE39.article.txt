# Pukka Sahib dining

If you're fed up with dreaded
veal at Wilbur, greas-o-burgers,
and co-ed pizza, it is time to dis
cover the true meaning of curry
at India House restaurant at 350
Jackson Street in San Francis
co.
The moment you enter the or
nately carved wooden door you
will be engulfed in the subtle but
exotic aromas of a distant land;
here begins your adventure in
Indian cuisine.
Quiet pervades, although you
gradually become aware of the
classical sitar music playing
softly in the background. A mys
terious turbaned man leads you
through arched doorways into a
room filled with heads, skins,
and tapestries of Bengal tigers.
Even before the meal begins,
you feel like a pukka sahib.
The extensive menu at India
House provides a large selection
for both the connoisseur of Indi
an cuisine and the uninitiated
amateur. The list includes five
curry specialities, six vege
tarian dinners and five tandoori
preparations. The tandoor is an
Indian clay oven which is used to
cook a variety of foods; Indian
bread, chicken, lamb, and dif
ferent kinds of kebabs. This
process seals in the goodness of
the food and produces a suc
culent flavor.
Prices range from $1.25 for
appetizers to a Royal Feast for
two at $34.50. The average en
tree costs about $11.00 and in
cludes salad (with an unique
mustard based house dressing),
rice, a choice of desserts, and
coffee or tea.
One of the most exciting extra
elements is the condiment tray.
The pleasure of Indian food is
heightened by the addition of
condiments. India House pro
vides eight: grated coconut,
ground peanuts, chow-chow, on
ions, raisins, hot sauce, quar
tered limes, and Major Grey's
imported mango chutney from
Calcutta.
The most important thing

about Indian food is the flavor.
Every bite can be different, de
pending on your particular
taste. As Sarwan Gill, the owner
of India House, explained "cur
ries can have as many dis
tinctive bouquets as wine." Ev
ery cook will use a different
combination of spices to make
their curry. "But, it is still pos
sible to be a connoisseur of cur
ries, just as you can of the other
good things in life," said Gill.
"You must savour curry, first
with anticipation caused by the
aroma, and then with the flavor
and aftertaste.
The best way to prime your
palate is with a chilled pewter
tankard filled with a Pimm's
Cup No. 1, the original gin sling,
a mild but refreshing specialty.
Or you could try the famed
Gimlet of the Orient. The rec
ommended drink with curry
dishes is a large bottle of Lieb
fraumilch or several bottles of
cool beer.
We chose the Pimm's Cup on
the suggestion of Tito Sandhu,
our waiter, and this lasted the
entire dinner. Before our meal,
Sandhu escorted us into the
kitchen to view the huge hand
built hive-shaped tandoor. On
our way back from this im
promptu excursion, we met a
few of the India House employ
ees. They are all scholars from
Pakistan and India, working
towards degrees at colleges in
the Bay Area.
We began with an appetizer,
Keema Samosa ($1.50), a deli
cate and flaky pastry filled with
steaming chunks of minced
meat and garnished with a spicy
cumin flavored sauce. De
licious.
Naomi enjoyed Tandoori
prawns ($14.00) while Estelle
opted for the Khorma, "a rather
more important lamb curry"
and house specialty at $12.25.
Seven or eight large and juicy
prawns came sizzling on a bed of
sweet onions from the kitchen.
The Khorma was served piping
hot in a covered ceramic dish.
But our experiment in in
ternational cuisine was not
over, we still had dessert. The
traditional Indian desserts
which were included in our meal
were nothing short of perfect.
Estelle had Kheer, a light Indi
an rice pudding, and Naomi
chose Gulab Jaman, fried milk
balls soaked in syrup with
cardamon and rose water. They
were just as strange and won
derful as they sound.
