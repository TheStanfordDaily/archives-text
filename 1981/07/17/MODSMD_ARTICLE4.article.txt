# Med Center returns $1.5 million

### Carl Johnston 
Amid charges that the Uni
versity Medical Center "double
billed" its patients and used
public health services to sub
sidize its teaching activities, the
Med Center has announced it
will reimburse Medicare for
$1.5 million in overcharges for
years 1975 through 1977.
The settlement follows an in
vestigation by the federal De
partment of Health and Human
Services (HHS) audit agency.
The investigation found that
the Med Center had overstated
its physicians' costs by more
than $5 million during the years
1975 through 1978. The $1.5 mil
lion represents Medicare's esti
mated overpayment to the med
ical facility.
According to University At
torney Karl Hitchner, however,
the return of the money is an un
usually large but routine adjust
ment to the Medicare account.
It represents approximately 2.6
percent of Medicare's total re
imbursements to Stanford for
those years.
HHS will not require the med
ical teaching facility to pay
either penalties or interest on
the misappropriated funds.
"There's a lot of give and take
in these matters," said
Hitchner, adding that adjust
ments with Medi-Cal and Medi
care often amount to millions of
dollars.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, presi
dent of Local 7402 of the Union of
American Physicians and Den
tists, in a press conference at
tended by Bay Area newspapers
and television, however, said
that the payment amounted to
an admission of fraud by the
Med Center.
Weinman hailed the decision,
saying that the Med Center
"had been caught with its fin
gers in the jelly jar and cookies
in its pockets."
Part of these overstatements
reflect a policy of "double bill

ing'' by the Med Center, accord
ing to Weinmann.
Hitchner said that the over
payment was due to a faulty
method of accounting for physi
cians' time at the Med Center.
This method has since been re
placed, according to Hitchner.
The Med Center made a simi
lar settlement with Medi-Cal in
1979 for $300,000. However, this
settlement may be renegotiated
by Medi-Cal in accordance with
the HHS report's recommenda
tions. The report said that the
Med Center owes the state Med
ic Cal program $653,000 —
$353,000 more than was ad
mitted by the previous settle
ment.
Much of the controversy
stems from the Med Center's
billing of state and federal
health assistance programs for
indirect administrative costs in
addition to the direct costs of
treating a patient. Income from
these additional administrative

charges is then used to subsidize
the teaching facilities at the
Medical School. Weinmann,
who represents a union of
private physicians and dentists
in San Jose, claimed that the use
of money intended for the care
of elderly people should not be
used to subsidize a medical
teaching facility.
The Med Center was in
vestigated by the state Depart
ment of Health Services (DHS)
in 1978. The DHS found that
Stanford's method of calcu
lating the amount of physician's
efforts at the Med Center was
very inaccurate, but that the
Med Center had violated no fed
eral or state regulations.
Weinmann, at a press con
ference in San Jose Wednesday,
scolded the Med Center, saying
"You'd not believe people of
that stature would be willing to
bill twice for a service rendered
only once."
