# 'Criminal Minds' not a memorable experience
## 
### Tahirih Lee 
The Stanford Summer Thea
ter had the dubious honor of
presenting the world premiere
of Robin Swicord's Criminal
Minds on Wednesday, July 16.
A play about memory loss and
the imprisonment of recollec
tion, Criminal Minds treats the
members of the audience as if
they share the chronic for
getfulness of Renfroe, the play's
central character. The vari
ations on this theme are thin and
may have nicely filled a one-act
play, but cannot sustain a three
act one.
Two escaped convicts, Ren
froe and Eddie Ray, hide out
with Eddie's girlfriend Billie
Marie in a miniature golf course
in Panama City Beach, Florida,
during the off-season.
Eddie Ray, the "sleazy" one,
plans to take advantage of Ren
froe's complete lack of short
term memory by using him as a
helpless tool in a future criminal
act. Renfroe becomes attracted
to Billie Marie, and because he
feels love for her he assumes
they must be married — emo
tion seems to be the only thing
that sticks in his mind. He even
forgets Billie Marie's name
over and over again.
Billie Marie can't stand in
troducing herself over and over
and telling Renfroe who he is, so
she insists that Renfroe write
things down on the only thing
available — golf score cards. At
one point when Renfroe threat
ens to leave he bids Billie Marie
farewell saying "Thanks for the
memories!" and stuffs the
cards into his pocket.
Technical aspects of the show
won both first and last place
awards for success. Designer
John Rathman met the
challenges of a functional min
iature golf course both techni
cally and artistically. Drawing
inspiration from the script,
Rathman arranged a jnemory
worn collection of carnival junk
into a treat for the eye that
matched the childish romping of
the plot.
He seems to have discovered
as Renfroe did, that, as far as
art is concerned one must sim
ply "follow ones tastes and hope
for the best." The best is what
we got.

The sound effects were not as
fortunate. Instead of enhancing
the set, they rudely jarred the
audience into wondering who
was fiddling with wrong buttons
up in the sound booth.
As for the acting, Troy Schmit
successfully maneuvered his
character Renfroe through the
implausible twists and pitfalls
of his complete memory loss.
The implausibility of this handi
cap did not stand in the way of
his disarming the audience with
his sharp comedic timing and
Robin Williams antics.
His brimming rapport with
the audience overflowed a few
times as Schmit could not hold
back smiling at himself. Yet it
was the easy conviction of his
childlike innocence that was the
greatest acting achievement of
the evening.
Admittedly, Schmit limited
himself to stiff jerky move
ments, and his vacuous double
takes lost sponteneity. He con
tinued to dominate the play even
when not a part of the action,
partly due to the lack of life
elsewhere.
Drue Bralove as Billie Marie
and Marc Chelemer as Eddie
Ray had more lines, but less im
pact. They tried to make up for
the lack of artistic control by
shouting and tensely wringing
their hands.
Bralove's dumpy but
dignified pin-up-girl-turned-sec
retary offers moments that ring
true. Her melodramatic variety
of pace and volume was in
teresting at first, but like her
shocking pink dress, dulled as it
lost its novelty. Too often her
voice locked into a high-pitched
pleading tremor.
Chelemar was not com
fortable on stage as the dark,
six-foot-two, macho conniver.
His slicked hair and painted
dress shoes couldn't hide the
fact that Chelemar didn't know
what to do with his hands, how
to articulate and sustain a Flori
da accent, and how to smoke a
cigar.
Many of the drawbacks lay in
the direction and the script. Di
rector Leigh Sealy always ar
ranged the actors so that the two
speaking were together and the
third off by himself.
The blocking was often

stilted, relying on robot-like
face-to-face positions, backing
up slowly, and sudden stopping
in one's tracks.During an impor
tant speech of Eddie Ray, his
back was turned to the audience
while Billie Marie's reactions
were easily seen.
Another shortcoming is that
Sealy often allows Schmit to in
terpret Renfroe's memory loss
as aimlessness. Billy Marrie's
and Eddie Ray's emotional
transitions are also neg
lected.The director sadly
skimmed over the potential in
Billie Marie's reaction to her

discovery of her lover's true na
ture. In addition, at the end of
the play heavy, restrained
breathing is substituted for a
true climax of passion between
Billie Marie and Eddie Ray.
The script's witty references
to Renfroe s loss of memory are
cute, but overdone, such as Ed
die Ray's warning "you can't
expect him to forget ev
erything!" and"it was love at
first sight — over and over and
over ..." Worse, the lines de
generate by the end of the play
into tasteless cliches about
female immorality.

After two hours of overstate
ment and repetition the play
culminates in a surprise ending
that is frustratingly brief.
Criminal Minds is Robin
Swicord's second play. The
young Los Angeles playwright is
currently revising the play — no
wonder — as well as working on
several film and television
scripts, including Stock Cars
For Christ. Her first play, Last
Days of the Dixie Girl Cafe en
joyed an Off-Broadway run.
The production runs
Wednesday through Saturday
at 8:00 PM this week and next

ens to leave he bids Billie Marie
farewell saying "Thanks for the
memories!" and stuffs the
cards into his pocket.
Technical aspects of the show
won both first and last place
awards for success. Designer
John Rathman met the
challenges of a functional min
iature golf course both techni
cally and artistically. Drawing
inspiration from the script,
Rathman arranged a jnemory
worn collection of carnival junk
into a treat for the eye that
matched the childish romping of
the plot.
He seems to have discovered
as Renfroe did, that, as far as
art is concerned one must sim
ply "follow ones tastes and hope
for the best." The best is what
we got.

The sound effects were not as
fortunate. Instead of enhancing
the set, they rudely jarred the
audience into wondering who
was fiddling with wrong buttons
up in the sound booth.
As for the acting, Troy Schmit
successfully maneuvered his
character Renfroe through the
implausible twists and pitfalls
of his complete memory loss.
The implausibility of this handi
cap did not stand in the way of
his disarming the audience with
his sharp comedic timing and
Robin Williams antics.
His brimming rapport with
the audience overflowed a few
times as Schmit could not hold
back smiling at himself. Yet it
was the easy conviction of his
childlike innocence that was the
greatest acting achievement of
the evening.
Admittedly, Schmit limited
himself to stiff jerky move
ments, and his vacuous double
takes lost sponteneity. He con
tinued to dominate the play even
when not a part of the action,
partly due to the lack of life
elsewhere.
Drue Bralove as Billie Marie
and Marc Chelemer as Eddie
Ray had more lines, but less im
pact. They tried to make up for
the lack of artistic control by
shouting and tensely wringing
their hands.
Bralove's dumpy but
dignified pin-up-girl-turned-sec
retary offers moments that ring
true. Her melodramatic variety
of pace and volume was in
teresting at first, but like her
shocking pink dress, dulled as it
lost its novelty. Too often her
voice locked into a high-pitched
pleading tremor.
Chelemar was not com
fortable on stage as the dark,
six-foot-two, macho conniver.
His slicked hair and painted
dress shoes couldn't hide the
fact that Chelemar didn't know
what to do with his hands, how
to articulate and sustain a Flori
da accent, and how to smoke a
cigar.
Many of the drawbacks lay in
the direction and the script. Di
rector Leigh Sealy always ar
ranged the actors so that the two
speaking were together and the
third off by himself.
The blocking was often

stilted, relying on robot-like
face-to-face positions, backing
up slowly, and sudden stopping
in one's tracks.During an impor
tant speech of Eddie Ray, his
back was turned to the audience
while Billie Marie's reactions
were easily seen.
Another shortcoming is that
Sealy often allows Schmit to in
terpret Renfroe's memory loss
as aimlessness. Billy Marrie's
and Eddie Ray's emotional
transitions are also neg
lected.The director sadly
skimmed over the potential in
Billie Marie's reaction to her

discovery of her lover's true na
ture. In addition, at the end of
the play heavy, restrained
breathing is substituted for a
true climax of passion between
Billie Marie and Eddie Ray.
The script's witty references
to Renfroe s loss of memory are
cute, but overdone, such as Ed
die Ray's warning "you can't
expect him to forget ev
erything!" and"it was love at
first sight — over and over and
over ..." Worse, the lines de
generate by the end of the play
into tasteless cliches about
female immorality.

After two hours of overstate
ment and repetition the play
culminates in a surprise ending
that is frustratingly brief.
Criminal Minds is Robin

young Los Angeles playwright is

Days of the Dixie Girl Cafe en
joyed an Off-Broadway run.

The Stanford Summer Thea
ter had the dubious honor of
presenting the world premiere
of Robin Swicord's Criminal
Minds on Wednesday, July 16.
A play about memory loss and
the imprisonment of recollec
tion, Criminal Minds treats the
members of the audience as if
they share the chronic for
getfulness of Renfroe, the play's
central character. The vari
ations on this theme are thin and
may have nicely filled a one-act
play, but cannot sustain a three
act one.
Two escaped convicts, Ren
froe and Eddie Ray, hide out
with Eddie's girlfriend Billie
Marie in a miniature golf course
in Panama City Beach, Florida,
during the off-season.
Eddie Ray, the "sleazy" one,
plans to take advantage of Ren
froe's complete lack of short
term memory by using him as a
helpless tool in a future criminal
act. Renfroe becomes attracted
to Billie Marie, and because he
feels love for her he assumes
they must be married — emo
tion seems to be the only thing
that sticks in his mind. He even
forgets Billie Marie's name
over and over again.
Billie Marie can't stand in
troducing herself over and over
and telling Renfroe who he is, so
she insists that Renfroe write
things down on the only thing
available — golf score cards. At
one point when Renfroe threat
ens to leave he bids Billie Marie
farewell saying "Thanks for the
memories!" and stuffs the
cards into his pocket.
