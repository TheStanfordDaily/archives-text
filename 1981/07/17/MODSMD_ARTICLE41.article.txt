# No deserters from 'Stripes' army
## 
### Chris Mai 
Producer Ivan Reitman has
created another comedy hit:
Stripes is in the same rollicking
tradition as his earlier smash
Animal House. In fact, Stripes
is one of those few comedies
that is so much fun that it seems
too short.
Writers Leon Blum, Dan
Goldberg, and Harold Ramis
have created a script filled with
every enlistee's dreams. After
all, what buck private wouldn't
like to reply "That's a fact,
Jack!" to his commanding of
ficer and then get rewarded for
saying it? Or, what hard-luck
draftee wouldn't like to meet
some gorgeous army girls —
m.p.'s no less — who twice bale
them out of trouble?
The cast is smooth enough to
carry off the many hilarities.
The jokes don't seem forced;
the action, however crazy, is all
in character. Bill Murray, a Sat
urday Night Live veteran, leads
the cast as John Winger. A guy
who can't do many push-ups (a
major sin in the army), he bucks
all the rules and has the curious
knack of being able to get people
to go along with his wild
schemes.
Warren Oates is a convincing

version of every soldier's best
friend and worst enemy — the
drill sergeant. The same Harold
Ramis who co-authorized the
script (as well as the scripts to
Animal House, Meatballs, and
Caddy shack — plays Bill Mur
ray's sidekick, Russell Zisky, a
guy John cons into enlisting in
the army.
The rest of the cast are most
ly newcomers, such as P.J.
Soles and Sean Young as the two
m.p. 's who fall in love with John
and Russell, John Candy as a 250
pound "mean fightin' machine"
named Dewey Oxberger who
has great fun in the mud wrestl
ing pit, and John Larroquette as
Captain Stillman who like to
play with his real platoons as
much as with his toy soldiers.

I'm glad to report that Stripes
goes against the ballooning Hol
lywood notion of jamming the
cast with a bevy of familiar per
formers at the expense of the
characters, the plot, and the
jokes.
Neither the characters, nor
the jokes or the action — ludi
crous though it may be — over
power one or the other. All fits
well. The army — Stripes style
— isn't bad at all. After all,
beyond the free haircut, the new
clothes, and the brisk fresh air
marches, there are fancy
trucks, weekend leaves, and. . .
If the army were exactly as it
was in Stripes, the Pentagon
wouldn't even need to consider
the draft. Any fun-loving guy or
gal would volunteer.


A new ploy to make the military a better place? It's love and not war in the "Stripes" army
