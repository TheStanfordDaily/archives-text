Destruction of address cards investigated
Los Angeles — The Los Angeles County district attorney began an
official inquiry yesterday into the destruction last December of 3000
name and address cards by staff members of Gov. Jerry Brown's
campaign office.
The state Fair Political Practices Commission had asked the Los
Angeles and Sacramento county district attorneys to review evi
dence that Brown's aides had altered or destroyed documents and
withheld others in an effort to thwart a commission investigation.
The commission said the 3000 three-by-five-inch cards were from
an index of Brown's political supporters and were crucial to de
termining whether a computer mailing system the governor had
leased with state money was used for political purposes.
Polish Party congress holding elections
Warsaw — Delegates to Poland's extraordinary Communist Par
ty congress yesterday started electing a new leadership by secret
ballot for the first time in the Soviet bloc.
A final list of 380 candidates for 270 members and deputy mem
bers of the decision-making Central Committee was drawn up on
the third day of the congress following lengthy haggling between
different groups of delegates. In addition, another 235 candidates
are fighting for 160 seats on the party's control and auditing com

missions.
Israel hits Lebanon, fourth strike in a week
Jerusalem — For the fourth time in six days, Israeli warplanes
struck deep into Lebanon yesterday, bombing Palestinian guerrilla
positions and destroying five bridges spanning Lebanon's two ma
jor rivers.
Although the air strikes were described as pre-emptive, and not
retaliatory, they followed by about two hours a warning by Deputy
Defense Minister Mordechai Zippori that Israel intended to
"avenge'' the deaths of three civilians killed during a Palestinian
Katyusha rocket attack Wednesday.

second straight advance.
