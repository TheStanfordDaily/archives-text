Pop singer Harry Chapin, shown here performing last spring
in a concert in Frost Amphitheater, was killed yesterday when
his car was hit by a tractor-trailer on the Long Island Ex
pressway. During a distinguished career, Chapin recorded 11
albums and such popular hits as "Cats in the Cradle" and
"Taxi." He was 38.
