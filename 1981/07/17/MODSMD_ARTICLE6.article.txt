# PA will vote on gay rights
## 
### Cici Oremland 
Palo Alto voters will decide
next November whether or not
their city needs an ordinance to
protect gay rights, the City
Council decided last week.
The proposed ordinance re
places a similar advisory meas
ure that was to have been put on
the November ballot.
At issue are the rights of the
gay members of the Palo Alto

community against discrimina
tion because of their sexual
preference.
These rights include preven
tion of discrimination in hous
ing, employment and in provid
ing general goods and services.
The council voted 6 to 3 to put
the issue on the ballot. The dis
senting votes, cast by Fred Eye
rly, Gary Fazzino and Anne
Witherspoon, were in response
to the Council's lack of endorse
ment for the measure.
The proposed measure was
also not endorsed by the City's
Human Relations Commission
who had created a special task
force to research the problem
and develop the proposed or
dinance.
However, "the Commission
does endorse the idea of the
measure," said Steve Harris,
community member of the task
force and representative of gay
residents.
Commission Chairman Ray
Wilbur, who voted against send
ing the ordinance to the City
Council, has publicly stated that
to do so without the endorse
ment of the council is "highly ir
regular." He was unavailable
for comment.
The originally proposed ad

visory and subsequently pro
posed ordinance were in re
sponse to a county-wide defeat
of a June 1980 referendum prop
osing a similar anti-discrimina
tion measure for Santa Clara
County. Another such measure
was defeated by San Jose vot
ers.
But according to Harris, the
referendum lost in Palo Alto by
only 250 votes. "So we feel we
have a real chance of winning,"
he said.
Extensive research was done
in the community to determine
if an ordinance to protect gay
citizens was necessary, rather
than just an advisory.
"There are real fears (among
gay people) . . . you could lose
your job or apartment," said
Harris.
He said many Palo Alto gays
are still "in the closet" and that
acts of discrimination occur.
Harris related one personal
story in which he suspected he
was being discriminated
against when he was asked to
leave his apartment. He said he
had been a "model" tenant.
Representatives of the gay
community, the City Attorney's
office and members of the City
Council, aided the task force in
developing an ordinance that
they feel would be fair to all res
idents.
The ordinance would make it
illegal to discriminate against
anyone in Palo Alto because of
sexual preference in: real es
tate transactions, employment,
membership in unions and job
training programs and in
furnishing goods and services.
Employers with five or more
workers would be required to
post prominently a sign stating
that the city prohibits dis
crimination based on sexual
preference. Failure to post the
notice would incur a $50 find for
the first offense.
But the ordinance would not
apply to domestic and child care
services. The ordinance ex
empts situations in which a
worker is in a home occupied by
the employer or his family.
Businesses with fewer than
five employees would also be
exempted.
Harris said the task force rec
ommended an ordinance rather
than an advisory to better
enable the voters a coice in pres
enting their views. He said an
advisory would give the City
Council a carte blanche in shap
ing the ordinance.
Harris also cited one political
reason the gay community
would prefer an ordinance over
an advisory.
Mayor Alan Henderson voted
for putting the measure on the
ballot because he said he has
always supported equal rights.
But other council members
fear the controversial turmoil
that will probably surround the
measure.
