# PA will vote on gay rights

### Cici Oremland 
Palo Alto voters will decide
next November whether or not
their city needs an ordinance to
protect gay rights, the City
Council decided last week.
The proposed ordinance re
places a similar advisory meas
ure that was to have been put on
the November ballot.
At issue are the rights of the
gay members of the Palo Alto

community against discrimina
tion because of their sexual
preference.
These rights include preven
tion of discrimination in hous
ing, employment and in provid
ing general goods and services.
The council voted 6 to 3 to put
the issue on the ballot. The dis
senting votes, cast by Fred Eye
rly, Gary Fazzino and Anne
Witherspoon, were in response
to the Council's lack of endorse
ment for the measure.
The proposed measure was
also not endorsed by the City's
Human Relations Commission
who had created a special task
force to research the problem
and develop the proposed or
dinance.
However, "the Commission
does endorse the idea of the
measure," said Steve Harris,
community member of the task
force and representative of gay
residents.
Commission Chairman Ray
Wilbur, who voted against send
ing the ordinance to the City
Council, has publicly stated that
to do so without the endorse
ment of the council is "highly ir
regular." He was unavailable
for comment.
The originally proposed ad

visory and subsequently pro
posed ordinance were in re
sponse to a county-wide defeat
of a June 1980 referendum prop
osing a similar anti-discrimina
tion measure for Santa Clara
County. Another such measure
was defeated by San Jose vot
ers.
But according to Harris, the
referendum lost in Palo Alto by
only 250 votes. "So we feel we
have a real chance of winning,"
he said.
Extensive research was done
in the community to determine
if an ordinance to protect gay
citizens was necessary, rather
than just an advisory.
"There are real fears (among
gay people) . . . you could lose
your job or apartment," said
Harris.
He said many Palo Alto gays
are still "in the closet" and that
acts of discrimination occur.
Harris related one personal
story in which he suspected he
was being discriminated
against when he was asked to
leave his apartment. He said he
had been a "model" tenant.
