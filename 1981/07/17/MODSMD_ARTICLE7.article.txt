## Record high interest rates: What goes up must come down? 
### Associated Press 
New York — When the presi
dent meets next week at the
summit in Ottawa with the
heads of other industrial na
tions, he'll have to be more con
vincing than he has been about
this country's high interest
rates.

Business Analysis

A few days ago, he sought to
reassure Western European
leaders, worried because those
rates tend to worsen their infrac
tion and draw investment mon
ey away from their economies,
that the rates are a short-term
phenomenon.
His secretary of state and his
treasury secretary also have of
fered similar assurances in the
past few days, leaving little
doubt that lower rates are
eagerly hoped for.
But now there appears to be
more hope than certainty in
those assurances and forecasts.

Does anyone really under
stand them?
Speaking with reporters early
this week, William Niskanen, a
member of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers,
conceded that the persistence of
high rates had him and his col
leagues confused and puzzled.
All along, the adminis
tration's forecast of lower in
terest rates has been based on
expectations that confidence in
a more stable economic future
would assure lenders and en
courage them to accept lower
yields.
It hasn't happened. There has
been evidence of rising hopes,
as expressed in the forecasts of
lower rates by important
bankers, but that's as far as it's
gone. Hope seems to be a level
below confidence.
As Niskanen indicated, there
is much confusion about this sit
uation. The inflation rate has re
ceded some, but interest rates
have not, and the gap between
the two is the widest in memory.

Assuming, for example, that
the overall inflation rate is
around 10 percent, why did New
York Telephone Co. this week
have to offer 15.625 percent to
encourage individuals and in
stitutions to buy its bonds?
That spread between inflation
and interest rates is about twice
the usual size, and it has per
sisted for many weeks. During
this time, confident that a more
normal pattern would assert
itself, some of the best-in
formed of bankers have fore
cast a decline in interest
charges.
"Interest Rates and Infla
tion: Something's Got to Give,"
said the headline of one econom
ic forecasting service nearly
seven weeks ago. It declared
that the gap had to be closed,
that either interest rates would
drop or inflation would worsen.
The odds, it said, were that in
terest rates would give. But
since then neither has hap
pened.
