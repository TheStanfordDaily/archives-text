# Pollution hurts crops
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington — Air pollut
ants determined safe for hu
mans are claiming billions of
dollars from America's
farms, researchers told Con
gress last week. One con
gressman termed the loss a
"quiet theft of food and
fiber."
Walter Heck, a researcher
at North Carolina State Uni
versity, said that if areas of
the United States met a cer
tain standard for ozone, the
losses to crop production
would be $1 billion to $2
billion. That would represent
2 percent to 4 percent of total
production, he said.
But, he said, "most sec
tions of the country are
above the standard and thus
current national losses are
probably higher than , these
estimates."
Efficiently curbing crop
damage from pollution could
ease consumer price in
creases and improve farm

income by cutting production
costs, analysts have said.
The major cause of the
crop damage, the study said,
is ozone, a pollutant formed
primarily when
hydrocarbons from fuels
react with the sun's rays.
But, it said, acid-rain and air
borne sulfur dioxide and ni
trogen dioxide also are sub
tlety reducing crop yields
across the nation.
"We're just on the
threshold of losses and most
farmers associate them with
other problems," Heck said.
"There's no reason for them
to understand that it's air
pollution."
The study said there has
been some work in identi
fying species of various
crops like corn and soybeans
that are more resistant to the
effects of air pollution. Tests
of an experimental chemical
spray that could protect
plants from ozone damage
also are under way, he said.
