# Congress wrestles to deregulate communication industry
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — In the spring of 1976, an
obscure bill innocuously named "The
Consumer Communications Reform
Act" was introduced in Congress and
quickly attracted the sponsorship of 192
senators and representatives. The legis
lation, unobtrusively drafted and pro
moted by the American Telephone & Tel
egraph Co., would have guaranteed
AT&T's historic monopoly over the tele
phone business, just as that lucrative in
dustry was opening up to competition.
Although the bill eventually died —
competitors labeled it a brazen power
grab — it startled a somnolent Congress
into taking a look at the mysterious
world of high-technology communica
tions. Today, five years, hundreds of
hearings and a thousand witnesses later,
Congress finds itself mired in the most
complex regulatory reform effort in his
tory.
Rewriting basic laws governing the
overlapping industries of telephones, tel
evision, newspapers, computers, satel
lites and electronics is a heady business.
It involves asserting congressional
power over a huge sector of the economy,
a $300 billion market; and it entails a
massive restructuring of AT&T, the
largest company on earth with 1 million
employees, 3.5 million stockholders and
72 million customers.
Communications law has remained es
sentially unchanged since the 1934 Com
munications Act, written to regulate
communications systems that seem
almost primitive today. The "Bell Bill"
of 1976 awakened Congress to the im
plications of the new technology, which
until then it had left to the governance
mainly of the courts and the Federal
Communications Commission, an inde
pendent regulatory agency.
Flushed with its success in deregulat
ing trucking, railroads and airlines, Con
gress has turned to a far more difficult
task: deciding how to let a mammoth
company — which dominates a market
far more than any railroad, airline or
trucking company — expand beyond
simple phone service into computers,
data processing and even electronic Yel
low Pages in a controversial effort to be
come the nation's total communications
network.
At stake is nothing less than "the con
trol of information in a democratic socie
ty," says Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.),
chairman of the House tele
communications subcommittee. "In the
economy of the 1980s, more than half of
our gross national product is based on the
development, storage, transfer and use
of information."
Explosive political pressures are
mounting around the issues. President

Reagan's closest advisers are urging
him to drop the government's seven
year-old suit against AT&T, the biggest
antitrust case in history.
The Defense Department, which de
pends on AT&T for military communica
tions, is championing the company's
cause in the name of national security.
And, at a time when the Japanese and
Europeans are energetically trying to
surpass the United States in tele
communications, industry says the legis
lation will affect America's global eco
nomic power for decades.
Paving the way for its lobbying cam
paign, AT&T's 23 political action com
mittees gave $622,252 to candidates dur
ing the last election — more than twice
as much as the PACs of any other corpo
ration in America.
The Communication Workers of
America, the union that covers AT&T
employees, supports the company's leg
islative position and gave another
$449,720.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), re
cently said that in 30 years in Congress he
had never seen such "outlandish efforts"
from all sides to influence legislation.
Despite the grandiose scope, for the
public, telecommunications is still a
sleeper issue, much like energy in the
19605. "Everyone who has a telephone, a
television set or a radio is affected,"
says Sen. Harrison Schmitt (R-N.M.) a
co-sponsor of Senate legislation. "But so
far the user is a passive bystander."
Probably few more than a dozen mem
bers of Congress understand the com
plexities of the legislation.
Senate bill
A major Senate bill would allow AT&T
to move into the lucrative fields of com
puters and data processing, which it had
foresworn in a 1956 settlement of a gov
ernment antitrust suit. The bill also
would deregulate key portions of the tel
ephone industry, including the manufac
turing and supply of,equipment and cer
tain long-distance services. Today the
communications business is overwhelm
ingly dominated by AT&T, which con
trols about 90 percent of the market.
AT&T's competitors, which range
from tiny telephone equipment firms to
highly specialized electronics outfits to
ITT and Exxon, contend that unshackling
a giant, regulated monopoly to compete
in the free market will touch off corpo
rate star wars in which small and large
companies alike would be destroyed.
The consequent stifling of competi
tion, they say, would hurt the consumer
by inhibiting innovative research and
raising prices.
The latest in-joke among the com
munications crowd at conventions and
law firms is the appearance of T-shirts

and bumper stickers with the slogan
"Reach Out and Crush Someone," a
takeoff on Ma Bell's long-distance ad
campaign, "Reach Out and Touch Some
one."
Central to economy
Hardly a business in America will be
unaffected by the outcome. Data com
munications, the information system
whereby computers talk to each other
through telephone wires, microwaves or
satellites, is the central nervous system
of the economy.
Farmers now call up weather and
price information on home computers
before planting crops. Doctors diagnose
patients and do medical research
through computers.
Bridge building and international
banking, petroleum exploration and
newspapers — all depend on electronic
data processing. Without computers and
communications to handle payroll and
Social Security checks, guide missiles
and submarines, track criminals and
court cases, the government would vir
tually come to a halt.
If AT&T can also make computers and
market data software — the information
packages that travel over its telephone
wires — "it has Orwellian implica
tions," Alan Pearce, a tele
communications economist, told the
House subcommittee.
The idea of an unregulated subsidiary
to include data communications, tele
phone equipment and certain long-dis
tance business — everything but basic
phone service — has already been ap
proved by the FCC, but is being fought
ferociously in the courts.
Without waiting for Congress to act,
AT&T already has begun to restructure
itself. "Baby Bell," as its subsidiary has
been dubbed, would take 100,000 employ
ees and up to $15 billion in assets from the
parent company.
Opponents fear, however, that Bell
will use the enormous revenues from its
regulated phone service, guaranteed by
the rate-payers to Bell operating com
panies, to subsidize the new unregulated
company.
Corporations such as MCI and South
ern Pacific, which have survived
ferocious competition with Bell in the
long-distance and equipment markets
thanks to the FCC, fear the new sub
sidiary will wipe them out by impeding
their access to Bell's local phone
networks.
The solution for many of these oppo
nents is to break AT&T into smaller com
panies, which is what the Justice Depart
ment has been trying to do since 1974, al
leging that Bell has followed a pattern of
illegal monopolistic practices to stifle
competition and force other companies

out of business.
Newspaper companies, including The
Washington I'ost, are also opposed to the
bill that would set up a second subsidiary
to allow AT&T to offer its Yellow Pages
over home computers.
Newspapers are just getting into the
electronic business. Washington Po.it
and New York Times stories, for in
stance, are offered on Compuserve, an
Ohio data bank that links home com
puters across the country by telephone.
If Bell can offer a constantly updated
Yellow Pages, amounting to an elec
tronic ad section, over its own lines,
would newspapers, offering their own
ads electronically, be able to compete
with the owner of the network they use
Would Bell eventually want to add stock
tables, sports scores, movie listings and
even news?
AT&T officials say they have no in
terest in supplanting newspapers, and
that it would be unfair to confine their
Yellow Pages, a $2.3 billion a year busi
ness, to the print medium if electronic in
formation is the wave of the future.
Brilliant research
The bill's sponsors, citing such ad
vances as Bell Laboratories' invention of
the transistor, contend it would be crazv
to lock the company that has done some
of the most brilliant electronics research
in history out of the booming data com
munications market.
They argue that technology is moving
so fast that it makes no sense for the law
to draw artificial barriers between com
puters and the lines or microwaves that
connect them. Touchtone phones use the
same digital bits as computers to trans
mit the human voice. Long-distance
switching takes place through com
puters. Computers are connected to each
other by telephones that transmit data
The House held hearings on the issues
last month, but is proceeding far more
cautiously than the Senate. When Rep
Wirth submits the subcommittee bill in
the fall, it is likely to have far stricter
rules for the separation of Bell's new
subsidiary and it may well outlaw the
company's electronic Yellow Pages.
Meanwhile, Wirth acknowledges.
"The politics are mammoth."
Many computer companies, including
IBM, have failed to join in the crusade
against AT&T. "Bell spends $15 billion a
year on outside equipment," Biddle said
"Many companies don't want to be pub
lic in their opposition. You don't bite the
hand that feeds you — even if it is about
to choke you." Nonetheless, the fact that
in five years the committees have been
unable to get a bill to the floor of the
House or Senate is evidence of how fierce
the opposition is.

trol of information in a democratic socie
ty," says Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.),
chairman of the House tele
communications subcommittee. "In the
economy of the 1980s, more than half of
our gross national product is based on the
development, storage, transfer and use
of information."
Explosive political pressures are
mounting around the issues. President

Reagan's closest advisers are urging
him to drop the government's seven
year-old suit against AT&T, the biggest
antitrust case in history.
The Defense Department, which de
pends on AT&T for military communica
tions, is championing the company's
cause in the name of national security.
And, at a time when the Japanese and
Europeans are energetically trying to
surpass the United States in tele
communications, industry says the legis
lation will affect America's global eco
nomic power for decades.
Paving the way for its lobbying cam
paign, AT&T's 23 political action com
mittees gave $622,252 to candidates dur
ing the last election — more than twice
as much as the PACs of any other corpo
ration in America.
The Communication Workers of
America, the union that covers AT&T
employees, supports the company's leg
islative position and gave another
$449,720.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), re
cently said that in 30 years in Congress he
had never seen such "outlandish efforts"
from all sides to influence legislation.
Despite the grandiose scope, for the
public, telecommunications is still a
sleeper issue, much like energy in the
19605. "Everyone who has a telephone, a
television set or a radio is affected,"
says Sen. Harrison Schmitt (R-N.M.) a
co-sponsor of Senate legislation. "But so
far the user is a passive bystander."
Probably few more than a dozen mem
bers of Congress understand the com
plexities of the legislation.
Senate bill
A major Senate bill would allow AT&T
to move into the lucrative fields of com
puters and data processing, which it had
foresworn in a 1956 settlement of a gov
ernment antitrust suit. The bill also
would deregulate key portions of the tel
ephone industry, including the manufac
turing and supply of,equipment and cer
tain long-distance services. Today the
communications business is overwhelm
ingly dominated by AT&T, which con
trols about 90 percent of the market.
AT&T's competitors, which range
from tiny telephone equipment firms to
highly specialized electronics outfits to
ITT and Exxon, contend that unshackling
a giant, regulated monopoly to compete
in the free market will touch off corpo
rate star wars in which small and large
companies alike would be destroyed.
The consequent stifling of competi
tion, they say, would hurt the consumer
by inhibiting innovative research and
raising prices.
The latest in-joke among the com
munications crowd at conventions and
law firms is the appearance of T-shirts

and bumper stickers with the slogan
"Reach Out and Crush Someone," a
takeoff on Ma Bell's long-distance ad
campaign, "Reach Out and Touch Some
one."
Central to economy
Hardly a business in America will be
unaffected by the outcome. Data com
munications, the information system
whereby computers talk to each other
through telephone wires, microwaves or
satellites, is the central nervous system
of the economy.
Farmers now call up weather and
price information on home computers
before planting crops. Doctors diagnose
patients and do medical research
through computers.
Bridge building and international
banking, petroleum exploration and
newspapers — all depend on electronic
data processing. Without computers and
communications to handle payroll and
Social Security checks, guide missiles
and submarines, track criminals and
court cases, the government would vir
tually come to a halt.
If AT&T can also make computers and
market data software — the information
packages that travel over its telephone
wires — "it has Orwellian implica
tions," Alan Pearce, a tele
communications economist, told the
House subcommittee.
The idea of an unregulated subsidiary
to include data communications, tele
phone equipment and certain long-dis
tance business — everything but basic
phone service — has already been ap
proved by the FCC, but is being fought
ferociously in the courts.
Without waiting for Congress to act,
AT&T already has begun to restructure
itself. "Baby Bell," as its subsidiary has
been dubbed, would take 100,000 employ
ees and up to $15 billion in assets from the
parent company.
Opponents fear, however, that Bell
will use the enormous revenues from its
regulated phone service, guaranteed by
the rate-payers to Bell operating com
panies, to subsidize the new unregulated
company.
Corporations such as MCI and South
ern Pacific, which have survived
ferocious competition with Bell in the
long-distance and equipment markets
thanks to the FCC, fear the new sub
sidiary will wipe them out by impeding
their access to Bell's local phone
networks.
The solution for many of these oppo
nents is to break AT&T into smaller com
panies, which is what the Justice Depart
ment has been trying to do since 1974, al
leging that Bell has followed a pattern of
illegal monopolistic practices to stifle
competition and force other companies

out of business.
Newspaper companies, including The
Washington I'ost, are also opposed to the
bill that would set up a second subsidiary
to allow AT&T to offer its Yellow Pages
over home computers.
Newspapers are just getting into the
electronic business. Washington Po.it
and New York Times stories, for in
stance, are offered on Compuserve, an
Ohio data bank that links home com
puters across the country by telephone.
If Bell can offer a constantly updated
Yellow Pages, amounting to an elec
tronic ad section, over its own lines,
would newspapers, offering their own
ads electronically, be able to compete
with the owner of the network they use
Would Bell eventually want to add stock
tables, sports scores, movie listings and
even news?
AT&T officials say they have no in
terest in supplanting newspapers, and
that it would be unfair to confine their
Yellow Pages, a $2.3 billion a year busi
ness, to the print medium if electronic in
formation is the wave of the future.
Brilliant research
The bill's sponsors, citing such ad
vances as Bell Laboratories' invention of
the transistor, contend it would be crazv
to lock the company that has done some
of the most brilliant electronics research
in history out of the booming data com
munications market.
They argue that technology is moving
so fast that it makes no sense for the law
to draw artificial barriers between com
puters and the lines or microwaves that
connect them. Touchtone phones use the
same digital bits as computers to trans
mit the human voice. Long-distance
switching takes place through com
puters. Computers are connected to each
other by telephones that transmit data
The House held hearings on the issues
last month, but is proceeding far more
cautiously than the Senate. When Rep
Wirth submits the subcommittee bill in
the fall, it is likely to have far stricter
rules for the separation of Bell's new
subsidiary and it may well outlaw the
company's electronic Yellow Pages.
Meanwhile, Wirth acknowledges.
"The politics are mammoth."
Many computer companies, including
IBM, have failed to join in the crusade
against AT&T. "Bell spends $15 billion a
year on outside equipment," Biddle said
"Many companies don't want to be pub
lic in their opposition. You don't bite the
hand that feeds you — even if it is about
to choke you." Nonetheless, the fact that
in five years the committees have been
unable to get a bill to the floor of the
House or Senate is evidence of how fierce
the opposition is.
Washington — In the spring of 1976, an
obscure bill innocuously named "The
Consumer Communications Reform
Act" was introduced in Congress and
quickly attracted the sponsorship of 192
senators and representatives. The legis
lation, unobtrusively drafted and pro
moted by the American Telephone & Tel
egraph Co., would have guaranteed
AT&T's historic monopoly over the tele
phone business, just as that lucrative in
dustry was opening up to competition.
Although the bill eventually died —
competitors labeled it a brazen power
grab — it startled a somnolent Congress
into taking a look at the mysterious
world of high-technology communica
tions. Today, five years, hundreds of
hearings and a thousand witnesses later,
Congress finds itself mired in the most
complex regulatory reform effort in his
tory.
Rewriting basic laws governing the
overlapping industries of telephones, tel
evision, newspapers, computers, satel
lites and electronics is a heady business.
It involves asserting congressional
power over a huge sector of the economy,
a $300 billion market; and it entails a
massive restructuring of AT&T, the
largest company on earth with 1 million
employees, 3.5 million stockholders and
72 million customers.
Communications law has remained es
sentially unchanged since the 1934 Com
munications Act, written to regulate
communications systems that seem
almost primitive today. The "Bell Bill"
of 1976 awakened Congress to the im
plications of the new technology, which
until then it had left to the governance
mainly of the courts and the Federal
Communications Commission, an inde
pendent regulatory agency.
Flushed with its success in deregulat
ing trucking, railroads and airlines, Con
gress has turned to a far more difficult
task: deciding how to let a mammoth
company — which dominates a market
far more than any railroad, airline or
trucking company — expand beyond
simple phone service into computers,
data processing and even electronic Yel
low Pages in a controversial effort to be
come the nation's total communications
network.

foresworn in a 1956 settlement of a gov
ernment antitrust suit. The bill also
would deregulate key portions of the tel
ephone industry, including the manufac
turing and supply of,equipment and cer
tain long-distance services. Today the
communications business is overwhelm
ingly dominated by AT&T, which con
trols about 90 percent of the market.
AT&T's competitors, which range
from tiny telephone equipment firms to
highly specialized electronics outfits to
ITT and Exxon, contend that unshackling
a giant, regulated monopoly to compete
in the free market will touch off corpo
rate star wars in which small and large
companies alike would be destroyed.
The consequent stifling of competi
tion, they say, would hurt the consumer
by inhibiting innovative research and
raising prices.
The latest in-joke among the com
munications crowd at conventions and
law firms is the appearance of T-shirts

and bumper stickers with the slogan
"Reach Out and Crush Someone," a
takeoff on Ma Bell's long-distance ad
campaign, "Reach Out and Touch Some
one."
Central to economy
Hardly a business in America will be
unaffected by the outcome. Data com
munications, the information system
whereby computers talk to each other
through telephone wires, microwaves or
satellites, is the central nervous system
of the economy.
Farmers now call up weather and
price information on home computers
before planting crops. Doctors diagnose
patients and do medical research
through computers.
Bridge building and international
banking, petroleum exploration and
newspapers — all depend on electronic
data processing. Without computers and
communications to handle payroll and
Social Security checks, guide missiles
and submarines, track criminals and
court cases, the government would vir
tually come to a halt.
If AT&T can also make computers and
market data software — the information
packages that travel over its telephone
wires — "it has Orwellian implica
tions," Alan Pearce, a tele
communications economist, told the
House subcommittee.
The idea of an unregulated subsidiary
to include data communications, tele
phone equipment and certain long-dis
tance business — everything but basic
phone service — has already been ap
proved by the FCC, but is being fought
ferociously in the courts.
Without waiting for Congress to act,
AT&T already has begun to restructure
itself. "Baby Bell," as its subsidiary has
been dubbed, would take 100,000 employ
ees and up to $15 billion in assets from the
parent company.
Opponents fear, however, that Bell
will use the enormous revenues from its
regulated phone service, guaranteed by
the rate-payers to Bell operating com
panies, to subsidize the new unregulated
company.
Corporations such as MCI and South
ern Pacific, which have survived
ferocious competition with Bell in the
long-distance and equipment markets
thanks to the FCC, fear the new sub
sidiary will wipe them out by impeding
their access to Bell's local phone
networks.
The solution for many of these oppo
nents is to break AT&T into smaller com
panies, which is what the Justice Depart
ment has been trying to do since 1974, al
leging that Bell has followed a pattern of
illegal monopolistic practices to stifle
competition and force other companies

out of business.
Newspaper companies, including The
Washington I'ost, are also opposed to the
bill that would set up a second subsidiary
to allow AT&T to offer its Yellow Pages
over home computers.
Newspapers are just getting into the
electronic business. Washington Po.it
and New York Times stories, for in
stance, are offered on Compuserve, an
Ohio data bank that links home com
puters across the country by telephone.
If Bell can offer a constantly updated
Yellow Pages, amounting to an elec
tronic ad section, over its own lines,
would newspapers, offering their own
ads electronically, be able to compete
with the owner of the network they use
Would Bell eventually want to add stock
tables, sports scores, movie listings and
even news?
AT&T officials say they have no in
terest in supplanting newspapers, and
that it would be unfair to confine their
Yellow Pages, a $2.3 billion a year busi
ness, to the print medium if electronic in
formation is the wave of the future.
Brilliant research
The bill's sponsors, citing such ad
vances as Bell Laboratories' invention of
the transistor, contend it would be crazv
to lock the company that has done some
of the most brilliant electronics research
in history out of the booming data com
munications market.
They argue that technology is moving
so fast that it makes no sense for the law
to draw artificial barriers between com
puters and the lines or microwaves that
connect them. Touchtone phones use the
same digital bits as computers to trans
mit the human voice. Long-distance
switching takes place through com
puters. Computers are connected to each
other by telephones that transmit data
The House held hearings on the issues
last month, but is proceeding far more
cautiously than the Senate. When Rep
Wirth submits the subcommittee bill in
the fall, it is likely to have far stricter
rules for the separation of Bell's new
subsidiary and it may well outlaw the
company's electronic Yellow Pages.
Meanwhile, Wirth acknowledges.
"The politics are mammoth."
Many computer companies, including
IBM, have failed to join in the crusade
against AT&T. "Bell spends $15 billion a
year on outside equipment," Biddle said
"Many companies don't want to be pub
lic in their opposition. You don't bite the
hand that feeds you — even if it is about
to choke you." Nonetheless, the fact that
in five years the committees have been
unable to get a bill to the floor of the
House or Senate is evidence of how fierce
the opposition is.
Washington — In the spring of 1976, an
obscure bill innocuously named "The
Consumer Communications Reform
Act" was introduced in Congress and
quickly attracted the sponsorship of 192
senators and representatives. The legis
lation, unobtrusively drafted and pro
moted by the American Telephone & Tel
egraph Co., would have guaranteed
AT&T's historic monopoly over the tele
phone business, just as that lucrative in
dustry was opening up to competition.
Although the bill eventually died —
competitors labeled it a brazen power
grab — it startled a somnolent Congress
into taking a look at the mysterious
world of high-technology communica
tions. Today, five years, hundreds of
hearings and a thousand witnesses later,
Congress finds itself mired in the most
complex regulatory reform effort in his
tory.
Rewriting basic laws governing the
overlapping industries of telephones, tel
evision, newspapers, computers, satel
lites and electronics is a heady business.
It involves asserting congressional
power over a huge sector of the economy,
a $300 billion market; and it entails a
massive restructuring of AT&T, the
largest company on earth with 1 million
employees, 3.5 million stockholders and
72 million customers.
Communications law has remained es
sentially unchanged since the 1934 Com
munications Act, written to regulate
communications systems that seem
almost primitive today. The "Bell Bill"
of 1976 awakened Congress to the im
plications of the new technology, which
until then it had left to the governance
mainly of the courts and the Federal
Communications Commission, an inde
pendent regulatory agency.
Flushed with its success in deregulat
ing trucking, railroads and airlines, Con
gress has turned to a far more difficult
task: deciding how to let a mammoth
company — which dominates a market
far more than any railroad, airline or
trucking company — expand beyond
simple phone service into computers,
data processing and even electronic Yel
low Pages in a controversial effort to be
come the nation's total communications
network.
At stake is nothing less than "the con
trol of information in a democratic socie
ty," says Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.),
chairman of the House tele
communications subcommittee. "In the
economy of the 1980s, more than half of
our gross national product is based on the
development, storage, transfer and use
of information."
Explosive political pressures are
mounting around the issues. President

Reagan's closest advisers are urging
him to drop the government's seven
year-old suit against AT&T, the biggest
antitrust case in history.
The Defense Department, which de
pends on AT&T for military communica
tions, is championing the company's
cause in the name of national security.
And, at a time when the Japanese and
Europeans are energetically trying to
surpass the United States in tele
communications, industry says the legis
lation will affect America's global eco
nomic power for decades.
Paving the way for its lobbying cam
paign, AT&T's 23 political action com
mittees gave $622,252 to candidates dur
ing the last election — more than twice
as much as the PACs of any other corpo
ration in America.
The Communication Workers of
America, the union that covers AT&T
employees, supports the company's leg
islative position and gave another
$449,720.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), re
cently said that in 30 years in Congress he
had never seen such "outlandish efforts"
from all sides to influence legislation.
Despite the grandiose scope, for the
public, telecommunications is still a
sleeper issue, much like energy in the
19605. "Everyone who has a telephone, a
television set or a radio is affected,"
says Sen. Harrison Schmitt (R-N.M.) a
co-sponsor of Senate legislation. "But so
far the user is a passive bystander."
Probably few more than a dozen mem
bers of Congress understand the com
plexities of the legislation.
Senate bill
A major Senate bill would allow AT&T
to move into the lucrative fields of com
puters and data processing, which it had
foresworn in a 1956 settlement of a gov
ernment antitrust suit. The bill also
would deregulate key portions of the tel
ephone industry, including the manufac
