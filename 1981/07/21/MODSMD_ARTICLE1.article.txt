# Public hearings scheduled on East Palo Alto incorporation
## 
### Gail Edmondson Schares 
East Palo Alto's drive for in
corporation took a step forward
last Friday when the county's
consultants completed a study
of factors affecting the bound
aries of that community.
A Sphere of Influence study
had to be completed before San
Mateo's Local Agency For
mation Commission (LAFCO)
would hold public hearings on
incorporation. The first public
hearing is now set for August
sth.

LAFCO will play a prominent
role in shaping the fate of East
Palo Alto. Based on information
to be presented at upcoming
hearings, the five LAFCO com
missioners will decide whether
it is best for East Palo Alto to in
corporate, to be annexed to an
adjacent city like Menlo Park,
or to remain as it is, an unin
corporated pocket in the south
east corner of the county.
If the commissioners do not
accept East Palo Alto's applica
tion for incorporation, the issue
will never reach the county
board of supervisors or the vot
ers in next April's county elec
tion.
Residents and community
leaders of EZast Palo Alto have
been trying to win political and
economic separation from San
Mateo county for the past 14
years.
"I have an ear to the com
munity and 99 percent of the
people here are asking, When is
it going to happen?' " said
Carmaleit Oakes, convenor for
the East Palo Alto Citizens
Committee on Incorporation
(EPACCI).
Proponents of incorporation
claim East Palo Alto cart govern
itself more effectively than the
county can. "The strongest
argument for incorporation is
that we would have a cen
tralized, local entity looking out
for the citizens of this communi

ty," said East Palo Alto Mayor
Barbara Mouton.
"Take this medfly fiasco,"
Mouton said, "As it stands now,
we had no vehicle to get any
message or warning out to the
people. Menlo Park and East
Palo Alto used city workers to
go door to door and hand out
leaflets about the spraying."
Community leaders are frus
trated by fragmented and unac
countable decision-making at
the county level, according to
East Palo Alto municipal coun
cilman Berkeley Driessel.
"When you have a complaint,
they send you from office to of
fice over in Redwood City. By
the time you arrive at the right
place, the office is closed,"
Oakes said.
Both Mouton and Driessel
agree that by the time federal
and state grants to the poor
filter down through numerous
county offices, there is often lit
tle or no money left for East
Palo Alto.
Residents of East Palo Alto
say localized government would
be more responsive to such com
munity concerns as un
employment.
"We will enlist people from
our own community to do city
jobs instead of using outside
people like the county does,"
Oakes said. Presently, even un
skilled positions are filled by
outsiders, according to Mouton.
Desire for self-determination
is another key factor in the drive
for incorporation. "In the best
tradition of American de
mocracy, we have an in
alienable right to govern
ourselves," Oakes said. "The
whole business of incorporating
a city is that of self-de
termination," Driessel said.
Previously, the greatest ob
stacle to incorporation was a
study commissioned by the
county which indicated that
East Palo Alto could not raise
enough in property tax revenues
to pay for the services a new

city must provide.
According to California law, a
new city must spend the same
amount of money on services as
that spent by the county prior to
incorporation.
LAFCO's executive officer
Sherman Coffman says more re
cent studies have shown that fi
nancially, incorporation is
feasible.
The city would need to collect
additional $37 to $50 in property
taxes per year from each house
hold to make incorporation a fis
cally sound proposal, according
to Driessel. That figure includes
a reserve fund for the new city,
he said.
"Up until the SRI study, I
wasn't convinced that the rev
enues could be raised, " Driessel
said. "I didn't get involved until
someone could convince me
there was money to run a city."
The SRI study, published in No
vember 1980, was one of the first
to conclude that incorporation
was possible.
