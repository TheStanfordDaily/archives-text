# Lebanon could receive defense assistance from Arab nations
## 
### Washington Post 
Sidon, Lebanon — Perhaps the strongest im
pression this reporter has had during a week of
events here is just how wide-open and defenseless
Lebanon and its Palestinian guerrilla encamp
ments are to Israeli air and sea attacks.

News analysis

The helplessness seems summed up in the pic
ture — often witnessed here this past week — of
embittered Palestinian guerrillas firing wildly
with their AK-47 assault rifles into the air in the
slim chance of hitting a passing Israeli jet.
For the past 10 days, Israel has shown the world
the devastation it can sow here with its airpower,
bombing heavily populated areas of downtown
Beirut, cutting bridges throughout southern Leba
non and hitting other targets of its choosing, such
as the Zahrani refinery depots.
The result has been more than 1150 casualties,
including noa r-l_v 2SO doa tha. thr* vast rrtnjrtri t\r rtf
them Palestinian and Lebanese civilians; the
partial severing of southern Lebanon from the
rest of the country; a potentially crippling gaso
line shortage; and another full-scale national
crisis.
In the same period, Israel suffered four dead
and about 50 wounded from Palestinian rockets
and artillery fired on villages across northern Is
rael.
The Israeli military has expressed great con
cern over the half-dozen batteries of SAM-6 sur
face-to-air anti-aircraft missiles that Syria
brought into Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley in
late April. Prime Minister Menachem Begin s
government has claimed the missiles are restrict
ing operations against the Palestinians and pose a
threat to Israel's security.
The Syrians have 22,000 troops here under the
auspices of an Arab peacekeeping force. They
said they sent in the missiles to protect the troops
after Israeli warplanes shot down two Syrian heli
copters during fighting with Lebanese Christian
militia forces.
There was no indication last week though that
these missiles were any deterrent or threat to Is

rael's might. Indeed, aside from the Bekaa re
gion, Israeli warplanes and gunboats seemed to
have pretty much a free run of all Lebanon, able to
strike where and when they will with near total
impunity.
Syria claims to have shot down two Israeli jets
during Friday's attacks on Beirut and southern
Lebanon, but there has been no confirmation of
this report by Israel or any other source.
The latest Israeli attacks have set off an outcry
among the Lebanese themselves, who are deman
ding that the government and other Arab nations
do something to defend the country against Is
rael's promised escalation of war against the
Palestinian guerrillas here.
While it is too early to say what the outcome
will be, there is a good chance the raids will serve
to accelerate the flow into Lebanon of heavier
arms to shield Lebanon and the Palestinians from
Israel. Already, Lebanese leftist groups have
asked for SAM-6 missiles, like those Syria brought
into the Bekaa, to defend the capital from further
r~r-.fi.-li rmtUm.

Lebanon and the placing of its military forces at
the disposal of the Lebanese government. The of
fer was made by Libya's chief diplomatic repre
sentative here, Abdul Kader Gouka, in a meeting
with Lebanese Premier Shafik Wazzan, according
to the pro-Libyan daily As Safir.
Libya had earlier pledged to provide Lebanon
with SAM-6 missiles, if it wanted them, and has
already delivered to the Palestinians SAM-9s and
SAM-7s.
There are urgent calls for a joint Arab strategy
to halt the Israeli attacks. Saudi Arabia has de
manded that a July 25 meeting of an Arab commit
tee originally set up to seek a solution to the Leba
nese internal political crisis, should now deal first
with the Israeli challenge. Other Arab leaders are
calling for Arab League defense ministers to hold
an emergency session.
None of this may give birth to a joint Arab
strategy in defense of Lebanon. But it may well
lead to the sanctioning of greater Syrian and Lib
yan involvement here as well as the arrival of
ever more sophisticated arms from the Soviet
bloc.

There are urgent calls for a joint Arab strategy
to halt the Israeli attacks. Saudi Arabia has de
manded that a July 25 meeting of an Arab commit
tee originally set up to seek a solution to the Leba
nese internal political crisis, should now deal first
with the Israeli challenge. Other Arab leaders are
calling for Arab League defense ministers to hold
an emergency session.
None of this may give birth to a joint Arab
strategy in defense of Lebanon. But it may well
lead to the sanctioning of greater Syrian and Lib
yan involvement here as well as the arrival of
ever more sophisticated arms from the Soviet
bloc.
