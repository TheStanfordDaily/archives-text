# Lack of funding
## Radio telescope inactive for two years 
### Andres Fajardo 
What has been known to most
observers as the "big dish" and
as a symbol of the advanced sci
entific state of Stanford Univer
sity is now, in the words of one
aide to Professor Taylor How
ard a member of the Stanford
Center for Radar Astronomy,
possibly on its way to being "a
dead object" in the future.
Despite its illustrious re
search history, the 150-foot ra
dio telescope in the Stanford

hills has been standing idle for
the last two years.
According to Dr. Von
Eshleman, professor of elec
trical engineering and a mem
ber of the joint Stanford Re
search Institute, the main rea
son for the big dish's inactivity
is a lack of funds. "If there is no
research money. Alas, there are
better systems that can be
used."
While during the late 1960s
and early 1970s the telescope

was used extensively, new
methods of solar system data
gathering are slowly outdating
the dish. And to compound this
already major barrier to future
deployment, recent housing de
velopment in the area has
caused interference.
"On principle, the dish could
be dismantled and moved to a
more favorable site. And this is
similar to the case where such a
radar dish is being moved from
Alaska to Iceland. But there is

no sound financial support for
such an action," said
Eschleman. He also pointed out
that work is being done in re
lated areas with similar struc
tures but that they are much
larger.
John Schlobohm, the as
sociate director of the Radio
Physics Laboratory at SRI In
ternationa, concurs with
Eshleman that the big dish
could only be dismantled and
moved at a great expense (Ac
cording to Schlobohm, SRI has
the dish on a facilities contract
from the federal government.)
Schlobohm expects the dish to
be used again. "But you can't
expect it to be used day in day
out for research," he said.
Schlobohm mentioned that if it
is to be used in the future, it will
not be used for tracking, as it
has previously. One reason giv
en by Sclobohm for this predic
tion is that such work can be bet
ter carried out on larger dishes
of the size of one 220-foot radio
telescope in Southern Califor
nia.
Built in the early 1950s by the
Air Force, the big dish was used
for communications work. In
1961, when the Stanford group

began its work with it, the scien
tists connected the dish to the
most powerful radio trans
mitter in the world at the time
(half a million watts).
Research was performed to
develop methods of earth to
spacecraft radio signals to ob
tain data on the features of other
planets.
About 10,000 hours of data
were compiled by work on the
dish with the Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and
9 space flights. The information
gathered through these projects
about the space environment
was used in constructing subse
quent spacecraft.
During the Apollo era the dish
helped map the surface of the
moon.
According to one of Howard's
aides, the latest and last use of
the big dish was two years ago.
"It was put back into action for
the Voyager operation. It did
succeed at what it was recom
misioned to do (communicate
with one of the Voyager space
craft) but it was done at great
expense . . . There will never be
the funds to do that again.
Besides, there are just better in
struments now," she said.


Although the running path that's nicknamed 'the
Dish' has become more popular and well-used, the

into disuse during the past two years.
