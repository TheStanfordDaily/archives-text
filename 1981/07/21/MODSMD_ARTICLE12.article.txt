# Non-registered students must pay for use of facilities here

Students who are enrolled
here fall, winter and spring
quarters cannot use DeGuerre
pool in the summer unless they
have a summer student ID or
purchase a pool card for $15.
According to Suzanne Carey,
assistant director of athletics,
IDs are checked at the squash
and racquetball courts as well.
Students must have a "continu
ing student" stamp on their
card to use these facilities in the
summer. But anyone may use
the fields, she said.
Carey said that the Univer
sity has an obligation to reserve
the relatively scarce amount of
facilities for use by the Univer
sity community. "Recreation is
becoming more and more popu
lar," she said. "There are a lim
ited number of courts, and there
has always been a limited use of
the pools."
One DeGuerre employee esti
mated that more than 400 people
use the pool each day and only
faculty and staff have free
passes to use the pool during the
summer.
ASSU Senator Mark Epstein
said this leads to an environ
ment more friendly to faculty
and staff than to students.
The ticket office said lack of
insurance for non-registered

students created the need to ex
clude them. But Bob Beth, di
rector of insurance, said the
University is self-insured. "If
someone is injured they may
claim against us," he said.
Rather the charge probably
provides a source of income to
maintain the pool, he said.
According to junior Debbie
Zeitman, who is not registered
for summer quarter, "If you're
paying any money to the Univer
sity, even if it's only during the
regular school year, you should
be allowed to use the facilities
for free. You shouldn't have to
be registered during the sum
mer. I think it's good for the peo
ple visiting Stanford to have in
teraction with the regular stu
dents. I'm very resentful be
cause I think I pump enough
money into this University."
She also criticized the com

parable exclusion of non-sum
mer students from University
library privileges.
She suggested an ID card,
which students not enrolled dur
ing summer quarter could
purchase for a minimal fee,
which would entitle them to use
all Unversity facilities during
the summer.
Epstein emphasized the lack
of a clear policy. "I think the
University has a more substan
tial obligation to the students,"
he said.
According to Bette Robert
son, ticket director, students
who are not registered summer
quarter may purchase pool
cards for $15. Family cards are
also available for $42. A card en
titles the bearer to swim from 2
p.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and
from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. on week
ends.
