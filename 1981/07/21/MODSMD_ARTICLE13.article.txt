Stanford students wishing to
take advantage of local recrea
tion programs often never get
around to finding out just what
is being offered and when the
various programs are available.
The Daily presents this in
formation about the Sierra
Club in hopes of encouraging
students to experiment, and ex
plore while at the University
this summer.
The Sierra Club Loma Prieta
Chapter, which covers San
Mateo, Santa Clara, and San
Benito counties, is, according to
Conservation Coordinator Mary
Kyle McCurdy, the third largest
chapter in the United States
(there are 53 Sierra Club chap
ters in the U.S.), and the Loma

Prieta chapter is one of the most
active because it holds a
variety of club activities.
"The Bay Area in general has
people that are very aware en
vironmentally," McCurdy
stated in a recent interview,
"and this is reflected in the
area's Sierra Club members."
Of all the cities within the
Loma Prieta zone, Palo Alto
contains the largest single city
membership of the chapter,
with approximately 4000 of the
more than 13,000 total.
To keep its members in
formed and entertained, the
Sierra Club has a whole slate of
summer activities planned.
Membership is $25 per year ($l2
per year for students and sen
iors) but non-members are wel

come to most activities.
