I make a habit of scanning the obscured recesses of our not-so
venerable Bay Area press. Sometimes the information I find buried
in the back of each section near the ad-line is as enlightening as the
stuff on the front page.
Unless you do the same, you may not know that Mexico's ruler,
Jose Lopez Portillo, has passed a dangerous censorship decree on
the media of his country. And if you didn't see that, you've missed a
golden opportunity to see how the bad guys win.
Included in the decree are bans on "writings, drawings, paint
ings, impressions, advertisements emblems or photographs . . .
that directly or indirectly induce or foment vices." i.e. porno
graphy; anything that is "contrary to the public morality and
education," i.e. anything from sex to ouija boards; "adventures in
which eluding the laws and respect of established institutions, the
protagonists obtain success in their business," i.e. conceivably any
thing from J. Gabriel Marquez to a Clint Eastwood picture; and,
finally, tales in which characters "directly or indirectly degrade or
rebuff the Mexican people, their abilities, customs and traditions,"
i.e. a writer like Jorge Luis Borges, who is a great artist that de
spises Mexico and says so.
The press in this country sees it as a move to get a few lascivious
girlv magazines off the streets of Mexico City. In world news terms,
it is strictly page 17 material. Maybe that is so, but, to my mind, it
also represents something much more ominous, much more fright
ening — on both sides of the border.
Under guidelines as broad and vague as those specified by
Portillo, anybody who publishes anything with which the 'president'
does not agree stands to lose their right to publish for up to one year.
Such a person will also likely go to jail.
There are so many possible ugly consequences of such a law that
it is disheartening to think about them at all. What, for example,
does this mean for our own foreign news services in that country?
V.'ill journalists — American journalists — risk jail every time they
write a story that Portillo considers unflattering to his people (or
himself)?
Who cares? I do. And so should every member of the free press
and every person who knows the value of free expression.
This is another case in which an arbitrary right-wing third world
ruler, has enstated himself as his country's arbiter of morals, good
taste and public virtue at the expense of his own people. He is being
encouraged by the spirit of President Ronald Reagan's "hands-off"
policy on human rights topics as well as a pervasive world con
servatism. It is an act of intellectual cannibalism.
Yet, Portillo fears no adverse outside reaction to his cowardly
despotism, and I am afraid his arrogance has been gratified.
I also see it as another case in which the American press has be
come so callous to our barbaric foreign policy and the cruelty of our
allies that it sometimes doesn't take the time or lend the space to
note their atrocities any more. It does not — except in the San Fran
risen Chronicle — even protest the plight of brother journalists so
close to our borders — except to give it a four-inch space on page 17
in a certain other publication.
If the end of the world ever comes, I think it will probably be an
nounced quieUv on page V7 oi 'your morning newspaper — some
place unobtrusive, where it won't break your line of vision as you
leaf through to find the sports or Lfoonesbury. It's not that anybody
is trying to hide anything, I don't believe. It's just that sometimes
budding catastrophes are so huge that they miss the front page — as
we learned from the Iranian revolution, which was such a 'surprise'
to those who missed page 17 the night before.
Other stories that strike home more closely are also missed by
the press. For example, on the front page of July 10's Daily was a
Washington Post report of a secret letter to Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger from the Department of the Army. It said that
military conscription would be required in order to carry out Presi
dent Reagan's defense plans.
We at the Daily were shocked to find that this item was not car
ried at all by the Los Angeles Times, San Francico Chronicle, San
Francisco Examiner or the Peninsula Times-Tribune. The only
newspaper to publish the story was the San Jose Mercury where it
was placed — can you guess where? As a filler on page 11.
The Washington Post, apparently, had better sense. They played
it as their second lead story.
There is, of course, a saying about people — such as myself — who
live in glass houses. I regretfully admit that the Daily did not run the
story about Portillo either. We don't have enough space each day to
cover breaking world news regularly. It means thai sometimes we
too miss the "big news."
But then, I'm afraid that we have little to fear from the big news.
It's the "small stuff" that worries me.
The small stuff is dangerous because we assume it's not impor
tant. The press pays no attention to it in part because the readers
pay no attention. And it's lack of attention that sometimes lets a
story move from page 17 to page 1 — usually after a situation has
gotten out of hand.
So, if you've ever wondered how the bad guys win, you can proba
bly find the answer on page 17 at the bottom. It's all there — tomor
row's disasters and heartaches — waiting for a chance to move up.

I make a habit of scanning the obscured recesses of our not-so
venerable Bay Area press. Sometimes the information I find buried
in the back of each section near the ad-line is as enlightening as the
stuff on the front page.
Unless you do the same, you may not know that Mexico's ruler,
Jose Lopez Portillo, has passed a dangerous censorship decree on
the media of his country. And if you didn't see that, you've missed a
golden opportunity to see how the bad guys win.
Included in the decree are bans on "writings, drawings, paint
ings, impressions, advertisements emblems or photographs . . .
that directly or indirectly induce or foment vices." i.e. porno
graphy; anything that is "contrary to the public morality and
education," i.e. anything from sex to ouija boards; "adventures in
which eluding the laws and respect of established institutions, the
protagonists obtain success in their business," i.e. conceivably any
thing from J. Gabriel Marquez to a Clint Eastwood picture; and,
finally, tales in which characters "directly or indirectly degrade or
rebuff the Mexican people, their abilities, customs and traditions,"
i.e. a writer like Jorge Luis Borges, who is a great artist that de
spises Mexico and says so.
The press in this country sees it as a move to get a few lascivious
girlv magazines off the streets of Mexico City. In world news terms,
it is strictly page 17 material. Maybe that is so, but, to my mind, it
also represents something much more ominous, much more fright
ening — on both sides of the border.
Under guidelines as broad and vague as those specified by
Portillo, anybody who publishes anything with which the 'president'
does not agree stands to lose their right to publish for up to one year.
Such a person will also likely go to jail.
There are so many possible ugly consequences of such a law that
it is disheartening to think about them at all. What, for example,
does this mean for our own foreign news services in that country?
V.'ill journalists — American journalists — risk jail every time they
write a story that Portillo considers unflattering to his people (or
himself)?
Who cares? I do. And so should every member of the free press
and every person who knows the value of free expression.
This is another case in which an arbitrary right-wing third world
ruler, has enstated himself as his country's arbiter of morals, good
taste and public virtue at the expense of his own people. He is being
encouraged by the spirit of President Ronald Reagan's "hands-off"
policy on human rights topics as well as a pervasive world con
servatism. It is an act of intellectual cannibalism.
Yet, Portillo fears no adverse outside reaction to his cowardly
despotism, and I am afraid his arrogance has been gratified.
I also see it as another case in which the American press has be
come so callous to our barbaric foreign policy and the cruelty of our
allies that it sometimes doesn't take the time or lend the space to
note their atrocities any more. It does not — except in the San Fran
risen Chronicle — even protest the plight of brother journalists so
close to our borders — except to give it a four-inch space on page 17
in a certain other publication.
If the end of the world ever comes, I think it will probably be an
nounced quieUv on page V7 oi 'your morning newspaper — some
place unobtrusive, where it won't break your line of vision as you
leaf through to find the sports or Lfoonesbury. It's not that anybody
is trying to hide anything, I don't believe. It's just that sometimes
budding catastrophes are so huge that they miss the front page — as
we learned from the Iranian revolution, which was such a 'surprise'
to those who missed page 17 the night before.
Other stories that strike home more closely are also missed by
the press. For example, on the front page of July 10's Daily was a
Washington Post report of a secret letter to Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger from the Department of the Army. It said that
military conscription would be required in order to carry out Presi
dent Reagan's defense plans.
We at the Daily were shocked to find that this item was not car
ried at all by the Los Angeles Times, San Francico Chronicle, San
Francisco Examiner or the Peninsula Times-Tribune. The only
newspaper to publish the story was the San Jose Mercury where it
was placed — can you guess where? As a filler on page 11.
The Washington Post, apparently, had better sense. They played
it as their second lead story.
There is, of course, a saying about people — such as myself — who
live in glass houses. I regretfully admit that the Daily did not run the
story about Portillo either. We don't have enough space each day to
cover breaking world news regularly. It means thai sometimes we
too miss the "big news."
But then, I'm afraid that we have little to fear from the big news.
It's the "small stuff" that worries me.
The small stuff is dangerous because we assume it's not impor
tant. The press pays no attention to it in part because the readers
pay no attention. And it's lack of attention that sometimes lets a
story move from page 17 to page 1 — usually after a situation has
gotten out of hand.
So, if you've ever wondered how the bad guys win, you can proba
bly find the answer on page 17 at the bottom. It's all there — tomor
row's disasters and heartaches — waiting for a chance to move up.
