English question
After reading Tony Kelly's
article (Daily, July 17) I am left
wondering exactly what, point
he was trying to make.
He begins by criticising
Americans for a cultural
fascination with things Europe
an, and then goes on to describe
the impending downfall of
Great Britain via its rioting
working class. The connection
between these seems to me to be
tenuous at best.
Where does Kelly, 6000 miles
removed from the riots, get his
penetrating insight when people
on the spot admit that they are
unable to understand them?
Lest I sound flippant, I do
agree that the riots are the most
serious problem to face Eng
land for many years, but as to
whether they represent dis
satisfaction with the Welfare
State or the Thatcher govern
ment, I would have to opt for the
latter. (Note that the Conserva
tive Party is not as sympathetic
toward welfare states as it
might be.)
I should point out that gangs
of skin-heads are not a new
phenomenon, rather a return to
the situation in the late sixties. I
can remember, as a kid growing
up in England, being terrified to
travel home from school on the
train late at night, as the skin
heads would invade the stations
and tear them apart. This is not
in any way intended to diminish
the impact of the riots but rath
er to show that there have
always been violent under
currents in England.
Kelly theorizes that the kids
riot out of simple boredom — I
would have thought an Ameri
can, if anyone, could understand
the "riot mentality." People
suddenly realize they won't be
held responsible for their ac
tions, so why not go out and
raise hell — and sure it relieves
the tedium.
One only has to look at the
New York black-out to see how
easily this can happen.
In terms of treating England
as a "model" democracy it is
absurd to say that Americans
should learn from the events in
England. Why should the Eng
lish not have learned from the
example of the American race
riots in the '60s? The English do
not have the draft; they have
gun control; and, apart from the
riots, rates of violent crime and
homicides are negligible in
comparison with most Ameri
can cities — is this a bad exam
ple?
Finally, skin-heads are not
punks, artists, haute cuisine or

actors with "posh" accents, so
just what were you trying to
say, Tony Kelly?

The point
The point of my column (Dai
ly. July 17) is not that England is
failing as a democracy, but
rather that the United States
would do far better to look upon
the urban rioting with genuine
concern instead of benign recog
nition. For all our insatiable in
terest in England, we are still
appallingly superficial in our
view of foreign crises as enter
tainment. In this way, we are
making the same mistakes as
the skinheads who raise hell for
a hobby.
It doesn't really matter
whether you blame either the ri
oters or the government for the
violence. In fact, to do so is to
opt for a closed set of views, ig
noring the flaws of both sides
and destroying any possible
message the entire situation
could have on individual lives.
In addition, Simon Bending's
defense (Daily, July 21) of vio
lence as a constant under
current in Britain and America
says more about the real dan
ger, both foreign and domestic,

than any analysis I can make.

I am afraid that Charles
Bernstein's misleading and ar
rogant letter (Daily, July 17)
might be a disservice to the Dai
ly readers. Having lived almost
my whole life in Europe, includ
ing six months this year in
France, I do have reasonable
background for comparisons
made in my review. I love food,
have taught haute cuisine, and
have enjoyed many of Europe's
finest restaurants.
I am sorry that Bernstein's
experience at Au Cnambertin
did not coincide with mine; I re
spect his opinion, although he
does limit its credibility by de
liberately misinterpreting ob
vious compliments in order to
carry out a vendetta for a bad
meal to which he was subjected.
No matter what Bernstein's
credentials, I would like to point
out that his superiority complex
may well be misplaced.

No matter what Bernstein's
credentials, I would like to point
out that his superiority complex
may well be misplaced.

English question
After reading Tony Kelly's
article (Daily, July 17) I am left
wondering exactly what, point
he was trying to make.
He begins by criticising
Americans for a cultural
fascination with things Europe
an, and then goes on to describe
the impending downfall of
Great Britain via its rioting
working class. The connection
between these seems to me to be
tenuous at best.
Where does Kelly, 6000 miles
removed from the riots, get his
penetrating insight when people
on the spot admit that they are
unable to understand them?
Lest I sound flippant, I do
agree that the riots are the most
serious problem to face Eng
land for many years, but as to
whether they represent dis
satisfaction with the Welfare
State or the Thatcher govern
ment, I would have to opt for the
latter. (Note that the Conserva
tive Party is not as sympathetic
toward welfare states as it
might be.)
I should point out that gangs
of skin-heads are not a new
phenomenon, rather a return to
the situation in the late sixties. I
can remember, as a kid growing
up in England, being terrified to
travel home from school on the
train late at night, as the skin
heads would invade the stations
and tear them apart. This is not
in any way intended to diminish
the impact of the riots but rath
er to show that there have
always been violent under
currents in England.
Kelly theorizes that the kids
riot out of simple boredom — I
would have thought an Ameri
can, if anyone, could understand
the "riot mentality." People
suddenly realize they won't be
held responsible for their ac
tions, so why not go out and
raise hell — and sure it relieves
the tedium.
One only has to look at the
New York black-out to see how
easily this can happen.
In terms of treating England
as a "model" democracy it is
absurd to say that Americans
should learn from the events in
England. Why should the Eng
lish not have learned from the
example of the American race
riots in the '60s? The English do
not have the draft; they have
gun control; and, apart from the
riots, rates of violent crime and
homicides are negligible in
comparison with most Ameri
can cities — is this a bad exam
ple?
Finally, skin-heads are not
punks, artists, haute cuisine or

actors with "posh" accents, so
just what were you trying to
say, Tony Kelly?

The point
The point of my column (Dai
ly. July 17) is not that England is
failing as a democracy, but
rather that the United States
would do far better to look upon
the urban rioting with genuine
concern instead of benign recog
nition. For all our insatiable in
terest in England, we are still
appallingly superficial in our
view of foreign crises as enter
tainment. In this way, we are
making the same mistakes as
the skinheads who raise hell for
a hobby.
It doesn't really matter
whether you blame either the ri
oters or the government for the
violence. In fact, to do so is to
opt for a closed set of views, ig
noring the flaws of both sides
and destroying any possible
message the entire situation
could have on individual lives.
In addition, Simon Bending's
defense (Daily, July 21) of vio
lence as a constant under
current in Britain and America
says more about the real dan
ger, both foreign and domestic,

than any analysis I can make.

Francophiles
I am afraid that Charles
Bernstein's misleading and ar
rogant letter (Daily, July 17)
might be a disservice to the Dai
ly readers. Having lived almost
my whole life in Europe, includ
ing six months this year in
France, I do have reasonable
background for comparisons
made in my review. I love food,
have taught haute cuisine, and
have enjoyed many of Europe's
finest restaurants.
I am sorry that Bernstein's
experience at Au Cnambertin
did not coincide with mine; I re
spect his opinion, although he
does limit its credibility by de
liberately misinterpreting ob
vious compliments in order to
carry out a vendetta for a bad
meal to which he was subjected.
No matter what Bernstein's
credentials, I would like to point
out that his superiority complex
may well be misplaced.
