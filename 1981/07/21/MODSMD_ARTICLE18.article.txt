## Demos are shirking their duty as opposition 
### 
Currently, the Democratic
party, as the "opposition" par
ty, is not fulfilling its role in the
American political system. It
should be a group questioning
and examining the proposals of
the governing party, the Re
publicans, and providing the
public with an alternative point
of view to legislation being de
bated in this country.
The most recent example of
the Democrats' failure to do this
is the budget. The request for a
more thorough look at the pro
posals being put forth by the ad
ministration does not call for an
automatic denunciation of those
proposals by the Democrats,
but it does call for knowing what
the proposals are and what their
effects will be.
One might argue that the
Democrats tried to do this, and
that it was not their fault that
the budget passed without ade
quate debate. But whether you
blame it on lack of leadership,
party disorganization, or the
Dixiecrats, the fact still re
mains that the Democrats
failed in their responsibility to
explore the ramifications of the
different proposals and to make
those facts public.
The Democratic party and
Congress as a whole have denied
the American public their right
to know what effects the cuts
will have by moving the legisla
tion through the House so quick
ly. This point transcends the
question of the Democrats fail
ure to initiate and maintain de
bate in the House; it takes us
back to the high school govern
ment lesson about the three
branches of government and
how the checks and balance sys
tem work. That class would not
use the budget legislation as an
example.
Congress allowed the admin
istration to monopolize the de
bate and essentially dictate to it
what it would pass. Clearly,
there was a lack of information
and scrutiny concerning the
budget and its effects, especial

ly considering the gravity and of
the changes being considered.
Keeping the lessons of
the budget in mind, one should
realize that in the near future
many more proposals will be
put forth that will just as radi
cally alter or eliminate the pro
grams of the past. We must
ensure that the same chain of
events that occurred with the
budget does not occur again and
that all potentialities of any leg
islative change are made clear
before debate is closed. This is
not to say that programs like af
firmative action, AFDC, Social
Security, the Voting Rights Act,
and food stamps are perfect.
They were not and are not the
panacea to the country's prob
lems, but they were and are at
least attempts, and partly suc
cessful attempts, to solve those
problems.
In view of that, it is amazing
how small and ineffective the
resistence has been to the dis
mantling of the programs of the
New Deal and the Great Socie
ty. The Democratic party, as
the alternative to the Re
publicans in the two party sys
tem, though needing to realize
that times have changed and
that some programs have not
worked or have been abused,
must not succumb to the admin
istration's "mandate" (which
was questionable anyway) un
less they truly believe that it is
the best way to solve the ills fac
ing America today.
The Democrats must focus
attention on the fact that prob
lems still exist today that need
to be dealt with carefully and
compassionately. Poverty, dis
crimination by race and sex, un
affordable and inadequate
health care, and the problemfi
associated with the elderly, are
all characteristic of inexcusable
conditions that currently exist
in many Americans' lives. The
public still feels strongly about
these issues and is willing to
support programs that deal with
solving them.

In 1980, Americans did not
vote against altruism and hu
manitarianism when they voted
for Reagan; what Americans
voted against was the abuse and
mismanagement they per
ceived existing in many of the
programs.
The Democrats, therefore,
must not try to fight for the sta
tus quo. New ideas and creative
revisions of existing programs
will be much more effective, in
ensuring that all people are giv
en a fair shake, than arguing for
what exists.
The proposed Republican
solutions to our country's ail
ments have problems too, only
they are much more severe.
Scaling down, phasing out, or

eliminating existing programs,
characteristics of Republican
policy, ignores the fact that this
will merely lead us back to
square one: the position that led
to the creation of the programs
in the first place. The free mar
ket, laissez-faire approach of
the past that often led to prob
lems is now being presented as a
solution to the problems.
The Democratic party's
charge should be to look for
new, creative ideas or construc
tive modifications of existing
programs. They should not have
to give in to inferior proposals
because of lack of a viable alter
native. Democrats must take
the initiative to press issues to
the forefront and not be a group

that merely responds to the ac
tions of the Republicans.
Finally, the Democrats must
rigorously examine and ques
tion the proposals that the He
publicans do bring up if the best
interest of the country is to be
served.
Only through this type of mul
tiple-advocacy in making de
cisions can we insure that the
best possible policies will be im
plemented and that the individ
ual rights and freedoms, and the
strides that have been made in
eradicating many social ills in
the past few decades, will be
maintained and advanced.
