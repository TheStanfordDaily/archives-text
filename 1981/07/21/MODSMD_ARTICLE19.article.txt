## Stern brings friendship, music 
### 
I saw the movie From Mao to
Mozart — Isaac Stern Visits
China twice in two consecutive
days last week.
I love the movie. Before I saw
it, I guessed it would be a good
movie, but it's even better than
what I expected. It reminds me
of a lot of things of my dear
country and people. It tells what
the Chinese people think about,
how they live and work, through
an aspect of their music ac
tivities. It introduces a very
kind and intelligent American
artist helping the Chinese peo
ple to learn more about a com
mon and real American. It is
just like a bridge to connect the
two countries in a more natural
and friendly way.
Look, the magnificent Tian
an-Men Square, the heavy bi
cycle traffic and the busy peo
ple ... I feel as if I were one of
the pedestrians walking along
the broad Chang-Ang avenue in
Peking.
Look, the high blue sky, the
undulating green mountains and
the wide, clear river, passing

are just like what I used to see
through the window on the train
from Peking to Shanghai. . .
Then the pictures of the mov
ie turn to Shanghai: I see the big
colorful posters on the side of a
busy street in Shanghai. Ah!
This is Huahai avenue. Only sev
eral blocks toward the west,
there is my parents' apartment!
My heart is beating faster. I get
so excited, just like I would be
on the way back to my family.
I like Isaac Stern, the com
bination of a kind Jewish grand
pa and outstanding American
violinist. I like his amiable smil
ing eyes, his simple dress and
easy manner. I appreciate his
deep understanding of music,
his exceptional skill with his in
strument, and his warm and sin
cere rojarhinf of Chinp<u> voting
people.
I also enjoy seeing all my peo
ple in the movie, the elder pro
fessors with experiences, the
younger teachers and artists
working enthusiastically and,
especially, the very lovely ten
year-old students who have ex
traordinary talent.
I like the cooperation of the
Chinese and the foreign artists,
the echo of the Chinese students
and the American instructor.
There are several marvelous
statements Isaac Stern makes
to the students:
"The instrument is not impor
tant. It is not music itself . . .
We are not to use music to play
instruments, but instruments to
play music."

"You need to make every
note come alive, to sing using
your heart, your ear and brain,
to state what you want to say."
"Like painting, music has
color. It is not only black and
white. It has some colors that
painting doesn't have."
When I hear these profound
statements, I am fascinated and
moved. When I see the students
follow the instruction and try
their best to correct their stiff
motion and to increase the feel
ing communication in their per
formance, a smile bursts from
my heart accompanying the
beautiful music from the stage.
I admire the teacher who
points out the problems ac
curately, and I am proud of the
students who respond to the Vn
structions rapidly and correct
ly-
One and a half hours is a long
time, but I am so involved in the
movie that I forget the time un
til the huge letters E,N,D, ap
pear on the screen.
On the way home, I am still
meditating. Let us forget the
miserable parts of the past
years in China. Let us take a
bright view of China's new
future. I am confident in the de
velopment of my country. The
hope is in the industrious and in
telligent people. The hope is em
bodied in the spirited young gen
eration.
Best wishes for the friendship
between China and America!
