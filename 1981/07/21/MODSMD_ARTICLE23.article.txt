# Single copy 10 cents
## New copying system in University libraries 
### Karen Springen 
Just as the days of the penny
gumball are gone, so are the
days of the five cent photocopy
at Stanford.
On July 1, a single copy from
the new Copico machines in the
libraries increased from five to
10 cents. According to Dick
Smith, assistant director of li
braries, the University libraries
were in the position of operating
at a loss or raising the price to
ten cents a copy when the Xerox
machine contract ended June
30. No company would accept
the contract for five cents, but
Copico offered the cheapest sys
tem, he said.
Purchase of a copicard, a
small plastic card which con
tains a magnetic strip pro
grammed with the number of
copies purchased, offers an al
ternative less expensive than
coin payment. Copies are made
by inserting the card into the
machine, selecting the number
of copies needed and printing
the print button. The machine
automatically subtracts the
number of copies from the value
on the card.
Smith emphasized that since
the new system is run by Copico,
it operates at no cost to the Uni
versity. So the libraries here
merely administer the con
tract.
Smith said that 31 machines
will be installed by fall quarter.
Thirty are in operation now, in
cluding eight machines in
Meyer and 10 in Green Library.
Under the old system, only 20
machines were in University li
braries.
Copicard advantages
Smith said the new system
has three main advantages. A
Copico employee is on campus
full-time to repair the ma
chines ; the number of machines
has increased, which provides
better service; and the copicard
is less expensive than other co
pying systems.
"We also find that the copy
quality is clearer," he added.
"And I think that people will
find the card copying more con
venient than finding nickels and
dimes in their pockets."
Purchasing cards
According to Bill Shop
perberg, a Copico installer,
cards may be purchased at the

photocopy center in Green, the
customer service center at the
Bookstore, the Nuts and Mug
snack shop in Terman, and the
photocopy center at the busi
ness school.

"/ think that people will find the card
copying more convenient than finding
nickels and dimes in their pockets."

Smith added that students
may also purchase cards at reg
istration. (The company is
working on a machine which
will vend the cards, but this op-

tion is not available yet.) An op
erating Copico machine may be
on display in Maples Pavilion
during registration so students
will be able to familiarize them
selves with the new system.

While each coin vended copy
costs 10 cents, purchase of a
copicard enables the buyer to
get copies at a reduced rate: by
paying for 1000 copies in ad

vance, one may get the old rate
of five cents per copy. Purchase
in advance of 100 copies gets the
buyer a rate of seven and one
half cents per copy, while
purchase of 5000, for $237.50,
merits a rate of 4.75 cents each,
a savings of 0.25 cents per copy
over the old rate. This rate is the
lowest available.
No system for refunds on
purchased cards is set up.
Cards purchased here may be
used on all Copico machines. "If
you buy a card here, you can use
it at Berkeley," said Smith.

The University of Chicago
and the University of Texas also
use Copico machines.
Student reaction
Junior Bill Frank said of the
copicard, "It beats carrying
five pounds of dimes around."
Regarding the price, Pete
Wallace, a summer student
here, said, "If you type your ma
terial into a terminal at For
sythe Hall, you can get your
copies, using their printer, for
about a penny and a half per
copy."
