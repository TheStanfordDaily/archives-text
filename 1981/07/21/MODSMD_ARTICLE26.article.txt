# 'City of contrasts'
## Geopolitical opposition characterizes center in Berlin 
### Cameron Smith 
Berlin, West Germany — It's
not a boring time to be in Berlin.
Particularly for 14 recently
arrived students at the Univer
sity's overseas study center
here, this huge, snow-covered
city of contrasts can be almost
overwhelmingly.
One factor, of course, is the
unique geo-political situation of
Berlin — divided in half by a
wall built by East Germany in
1961 and thus creating
showcases for two opposing po
litical-economic systems.
Add to that the cooling of
East-West relations in the light
of the Polish and Afghan situ
ations, a wave of violent housing
riots and the recent fall of the
city government following a
major financial scandal, and
you've got plenty to rap about in
a local bier kneipe.
But for now, as Berliners
struggle to put their city govern
ment back together, 14 Stanford
students struggle to master
their German well enough to
survive and figure out what's
going on.
"It's inexhaustible, all the
things to do," said sophomore
Elaine Holliman. "I don't feel
trapped. It's a totally cos
mopolitan city and you're on
your own," she added.
The Berlin study center
which began in 1975, "offers the
opportunity to live at the wa
tershed between East and West

. . . on the brink between two
world-systems, Western-capi
talist-democracy and Soviet
bloc-socialism," said Assistant
Director Karen Kramer.
Although access to East Ber
lin for one-day trips is relatively
easy, it has recently become

"fo live. . .on the brink between two world
systems, Western-capitalist-democracy and
Soviet-bloc-socialism "

more expensive. In an apparent
move to limit the flow of
Western visitors into East Ber
lin, the East German govern
ment last summer — during the
height of the Polish worker
strikes — quadrupled the
amount of West German marks
one must exchange for East
German marks each visit from
6.50 to 25 DM, on top of the usual
five mark visa fee.
For students on a budget, that
means only occasional trips.
But it also serves to illustrate
one of the reasons junior Andy
Hirsch gave for why he chose to
study in Berlin: "East-West
tensions are felt first here."
Despite the higher exchange
rate, some students have al
ready begun exploring East
Berlin's social life and making
acquaintances there.
"You go over expecting it to

be totally alien from the 'free
world'; then you find out the
people aren't really all that dif
ferent," said junior Elena
Woodard. "They enjoy drinking
and laughing," she added.
Woodard noted that some East
Germans seem "a little de-

fensive at first" because they
fear Westerners "might pity
them. But after a bottle of wine,
they open up," and often speak
critically about their govern
ment.
In addition to visits to East
Berlin, students can obtain spe
cial visas permitting up to 30
one-day visits almost anywhere
in East Germany, without hav
ing to pay the five mark visa fee.
The center has also secured
"special arrangements with the
East German government to
take several extremely cheap
trips to areas not normallly ac

cessible, such as Weimar,
Dresden, Potsdam and the Harz
area," said Kramer.
Travel to other parts of
Eastern Europe is also ac
cessible from Berlin, located in
the middle of East Germany.
The center is currently planning
a field trip to Prague, Czecho
slovakia in May.
In West Berlin itself, says
Kramer, "the opportunity to
mix in with the culture is more
developed" than at other Stan
ford overseas campuses. The
center is housed in the Villa
Muthesius, where most of the
students live with German
roommates. Students studying
for two quarters normally live
at least one quarter in private
residences or in a German
dormitory, and in any case,
must fend for themselves with a
bi-weekly food allowance.
Named after the Berlin
architect Hermann Muthesius
and completed in 1912, the villa
survived World War II only to be
virtually destroyed by a gas ex
plosion in the 19505. Since then
the city of Berlin — which rents
the villa to Stanford — has re
stored the villa and its gardens

at a cost of three million marks
($1.5 million) to its original
form, reminiscent of an English
country house.
The program includes classes
in German language, history
and the arts taught by Stanford
and local faculty during Winter
and Spring quarters. Next
Autumn, due to a new fund-rais
ing effort, the center will add a
program for engineering and
science students in preparation
for paid internships with West
German firms during Winter
quarter.
Students with sufficient lan
guage proficiency can take
classes at Berlin's Free Univer
sity (FU) or Technical Univer
sity <TU) during Spring quar
ter, or, if they qualify they can
study full-time at either univer
sity including during Autumn
quarter. There are currently
three Stanford students study
ing full-time at the FU.
The program also provides an
annual scholarship to a former
participant for one year of study
at the FU. This year's recipient
is 1980 graduate Scott Campbell,
who is studying problems of ur
banization and focusing on Ber
lin's explosive housing-shortage
problem.
Berlin, the former capital of
Imperial and Nazi Germany,
has historically been a center of
European culture, a tradition
which is alive and well, as stu
dents in Kramer's theater-going
class are discovering.
"German theater is a lot
more experimental, active and
dynamic," said Holliman. She
feels that Berlin theaters are
concerned not just with enter
taining audiences, but more "to
involve them in all aspects
through an entire theatrical
adaptation."
Countless museums, art gal
leries, historical sights and mu
sical performances round out
the scope of choices for the
seeker of culture.
And then there's the night
life, as many students pointed
out. The city offers literally
thousands of night clubs, stu
dent kneipes, bais and cafes
catering to every imaginable
musical, political or sexual in
terest.
"The beer is so good here,"
commented junior Mark Kuo, a
studio art/photography major.
Kuo pointed out, however, one
disadvantage to Berlin, at least
for winter quarter partici
pants: "It's cold," he said.
Other disadvantages include

the physical separation of Ber
lin from West Germany and
Western Europe, and the rela
tive difficulty of traveling in the
East German regions surround
ing the city.
Some students also told of in
itial difficulties breaking
through the somewhat cold, re
served exterior of many Ger
mans. Sophomore Steve Kauf
man suggested that Germany's
particularly traumatic, war
torn past may have helped place
social barriers between people,
a phenomenon which he said he
has observed primarily in older
people.
"There are more barriers
here and that's the hardest thing
for an American to deal with,"
he said. But Kaufman, who re
cently joined a fencing club, had
this to say about younger Ger
mans: "They are incredibly
friendly. The fencing club's
president immediately pro
vided me with every thing I
needed and did all he could to
make me feel welcome."
Divisions certainly exist here
— between East and West,
young and old, Germans and the
mostly Turkish foreign labor
force, and perhaps most of all,
between the past and the pres
ent.
These divisions are also what
make Berlin such a fascinating
city of contrasts and contradic
tions.

wall built by East Germany in
1961 and thus creating
showcases for two opposing po
litical-economic systems.
Add to that the cooling of
East-West relations in the light
of the Polish and Afghan situ
ations, a wave of violent housing
riots and the recent fall of the
city government following a
major financial scandal, and
you've got plenty to rap about in
a local bier kneipe.
But for now, as Berliners
struggle to put their city govern
ment back together, 14 Stanford
students struggle to master
their German well enough to
survive and figure out what's
going on.
"It's inexhaustible, all the
things to do," said sophomore
Elaine Holliman. "I don't feel
trapped. It's a totally cos
mopolitan city and you're on
your own," she added.
The Berlin study center
which began in 1975, "offers the
opportunity to live at the wa
tershed between East and West

. . . on the brink between two
world-systems, Western-capi
talist-democracy and Soviet
bloc-socialism," said Assistant
Director Karen Kramer.
Although access to East Ber
lin for one-day trips is relatively
easy, it has recently become

"fo live. . .on the brink between two world
systems, Western-capitalist-democracy and
Soviet-bloc-socialism "

more expensive. In an apparent
move to limit the flow of
Western visitors into East Ber
lin, the East German govern
ment last summer — during the
height of the Polish worker
strikes — quadrupled the
amount of West German marks
one must exchange for East
German marks each visit from
6.50 to 25 DM, on top of the usual
five mark visa fee.
For students on a budget, that
means only occasional trips.
But it also serves to illustrate
one of the reasons junior Andy
Hirsch gave for why he chose to
study in Berlin: "East-West
tensions are felt first here."
Despite the higher exchange
rate, some students have al
ready begun exploring East
Berlin's social life and making
acquaintances there.
"You go over expecting it to

be totally alien from the 'free
world'; then you find out the
people aren't really all that dif
ferent," said junior Elena
Woodard. "They enjoy drinking
and laughing," she added.
Woodard noted that some East
Germans seem "a little de-

fensive at first" because they
fear Westerners "might pity
them. But after a bottle of wine,
they open up," and often speak
critically about their govern
ment.
In addition to visits to East
Berlin, students can obtain spe
cial visas permitting up to 30
one-day visits almost anywhere
in East Germany, without hav
ing to pay the five mark visa fee.
The center has also secured
"special arrangements with the
East German government to
take several extremely cheap
trips to areas not normallly ac

cessible, such as Weimar,
Dresden, Potsdam and the Harz
area," said Kramer.
Travel to other parts of
Eastern Europe is also ac
cessible from Berlin, located in
the middle of East Germany.
The center is currently planning
a field trip to Prague, Czecho
slovakia in May.
In West Berlin itself, says
Kramer, "the opportunity to
mix in with the culture is more
developed" than at other Stan
ford overseas campuses. The
center is housed in the Villa
Muthesius, where most of the
students live with German
roommates. Students studying
for two quarters normally live
at least one quarter in private
residences or in a German
dormitory, and in any case,
must fend for themselves with a
bi-weekly food allowance.
Named after the Berlin
architect Hermann Muthesius
and completed in 1912, the villa
survived World War II only to be
virtually destroyed by a gas ex
plosion in the 19505. Since then
the city of Berlin — which rents
the villa to Stanford — has re
stored the villa and its gardens

at a cost of three million marks
($1.5 million) to its original
form, reminiscent of an English
country house.
The program includes classes
in German language, history
and the arts taught by Stanford
and local faculty during Winter
and Spring quarters. Next
Autumn, due to a new fund-rais
ing effort, the center will add a
program for engineering and
science students in preparation
for paid internships with West
German firms during Winter
quarter.
Students with sufficient lan
guage proficiency can take
classes at Berlin's Free Univer
sity (FU) or Technical Univer
sity <TU) during Spring quar
ter, or, if they qualify they can
study full-time at either univer
sity including during Autumn
quarter. There are currently
three Stanford students study
ing full-time at the FU.
The program also provides an
annual scholarship to a former
participant for one year of study
at the FU. This year's recipient
is 1980 graduate Scott Campbell,
who is studying problems of ur
banization and focusing on Ber
lin's explosive housing-shortage
problem.
Berlin, the former capital of
Imperial and Nazi Germany,
has historically been a center of
European culture, a tradition
which is alive and well, as stu
dents in Kramer's theater-going
class are discovering.
"German theater is a lot
more experimental, active and
dynamic," said Holliman. She
feels that Berlin theaters are
concerned not just with enter
taining audiences, but more "to
involve them in all aspects
through an entire theatrical
adaptation."
Countless museums, art gal
leries, historical sights and mu
sical performances round out
the scope of choices for the
seeker of culture.
And then there's the night
life, as many students pointed
out. The city offers literally
thousands of night clubs, stu
dent kneipes, bais and cafes
catering to every imaginable
musical, political or sexual in
terest.
"The beer is so good here,"
commented junior Mark Kuo, a
studio art/photography major.
Kuo pointed out, however, one
disadvantage to Berlin, at least
for winter quarter partici
pants: "It's cold," he said.
Other disadvantages include

the physical separation of Ber
lin from West Germany and
Western Europe, and the rela
tive difficulty of traveling in the
East German regions surround
ing the city.
Some students also told of in
itial difficulties breaking
through the somewhat cold, re
served exterior of many Ger
mans. Sophomore Steve Kauf
man suggested that Germany's
particularly traumatic, war
torn past may have helped place
social barriers between people,
a phenomenon which he said he
has observed primarily in older
people.
"There are more barriers
here and that's the hardest thing
for an American to deal with,"
he said. But Kaufman, who re
cently joined a fencing club, had
this to say about younger Ger
mans: "They are incredibly
friendly. The fencing club's
president immediately pro
vided me with every thing I
needed and did all he could to
make me feel welcome."
Divisions certainly exist here
— between East and West,
young and old, Germans and the
mostly Turkish foreign labor
force, and perhaps most of all,
between the past and the pres
ent.
These divisions are also what
make Berlin such a fascinating
city of contrasts and contradic
tions.
Berlin, West Germany — It's
not a boring time to be in Berlin.
Particularly for 14 recently

sity's overseas study center
here, this huge, snow-covered
city of contrasts can be almost
