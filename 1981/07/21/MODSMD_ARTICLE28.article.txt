# Mexican oil linked to economy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Mexico City — The hard line
taken by Mexico to keep the
price of its oil up appears to
have won some success, but the
economy is still suffering from
a series of oil-induced shocks
following a sudden trans
formation from a seller's mar
ket to a buyer's market.
Mexican oil exports have
dropped by about half — 700,000
barrels a day — since early
June, and is only now beginning
to recover.
The result has been a curtail
ment ot government spending,
enormous pressure on the peso
and. moit significant, a loss of
confidence in the "oil weapon"
as the salvation of Mexico.
Much of the cutback has been
the result of reduced demand by
U.S. oi! companies, and Mexi
can President Jose Lopez
Portill did Friday that many
of then, may be "pruned" — re
moved ermanently — from the
list of buyers.
The ;-_*ason, he said, is that
Mexico prefers to deal with
countri s instead of private
companies and finds itself un

able to sell to friendly countries
— Italy, for example — because
of existing contracts with
American companies, among
others.
At a breakfast meeting with
American and other foreign re
porters, Lopez Portillo insisted
that the change in the oil market
is only temporary.
The Mexican chief executive
also said he would "fight like a
dog," a phrase he repeated
three times, to maintain the sta
bility of the peso. He used the
word malinchista (traitor) to
describe those he accused of
weakening the national econo
my by buying dollars with their
pesos.
Lopez Portillo expressed sat
isfaction with an agreement
concluded last Thursday in Par
is under which the government
controlled Compagnie Fran
caise des Petroles decided to re
new purchases of 100,000 barrels
of Mexican oil per day.
The agreement was a vindica
tion of Mexico's $2 per barrel
price increase in late June after
a reduction of $4 in early June.
The reduction, for which the

public was unprepared, came as
a shock and forced the resigna
tion of Jorge Diaz Serrano as di
rector of Pemex.
In an effort to regain public
confidence and assert his coun
try's position as an oil power,
Lopez Portillo announced the $2
increase. Cabinet ministers
hinted that buyers who backed
off might be blacklisted.
Mexico apparently won the
agreement by the French to buy
its oil at a price of about $32.60 a
barrel for a mixture of Isthmus
and Maya crude.
The French, like others of
Mexico's oil customers, are said
to have complained of the dif
ficulty in refining the heavier
Maya crude, and there is
speculation a deal was worked
out to include more Isthmus
light oil in the mixture.
Heading the Mexican
bargaining team in Paris was
the new director of Pemex,
Julio Moctezuma Cid. Upon his
departure from Mexico last
week, he expressed confidence
that by mid-August Mexico
could be exporting up to 1 mil
lion barrels of oil a day. Over the
