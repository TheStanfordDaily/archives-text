Room-to-room inspections
for waterbeds and refrigerators
in student residences are ten
tatively scheduled to begin fall
quarter, said COP member
Fred Buhl. The Energy Sur
charge Advisory Committee has
recommended energy sur
charges of $18 for half-sized re
frigerators and $80 to $140 for
waterbeds.
But Energy Director John
Eaton emphasized the proposal
is still in the planning stage. "So
far nothing definitive has been
established," he said.
According to Eaton, an ad-

visory committee has been es
tablished to gain input from the
student side. "I wanted to get
student feeling," he said. "Any
final decision that's made is
going to be approved through
both res-ed and housing."
ASSU opposes 'implementation*
The ASSU is opposing the
room-to-room searches, accord
ing to Buhl. "The energy con
servation aspect is good. The
problem is the implementa
tion," he said. Individual room
inspections now are conducted
only to check for room damage.
Buhl said door-to-door
searches violate the Fundamen

tal Standard, set up in 1906 to es
tablish standards of student
conduct. It states: "Students at
Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and
the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens. Fail
ure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the Uni
versity."
"The rights of all members of
the University community are
endangered by a policy that as
sumes non-compliance and dis
honorable behavior," said
Buhl.
