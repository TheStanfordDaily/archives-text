## Bay Area choreographers put on a superb show 
### Rebecca Weitz 
In just a little over an hour
last weekend, the audience at
the Margaret Jenkins Dance
Studio experienced five very
different but equally impressive
original dance works.
The pieces were a part of the
Fourth Annual Choreographers'
Concert of the San Francisco
Bay Area Dance Coalition. The
works we saw during one of the
three days of performances had
made it through a carefully
selected two-stage audition
process. The 97 submissions
were narrowed down to 30 by ex
perienced Bay Choreographers
and later to 11, six of which will
be shown on July 25 at the
Herbst Theatre.
Many aspects of performance
were considered — music,
dynamics, the use of space, set
ting, costumes, as well as the
dancers' ability to execute the
movement. But what is always
important is how all of those
facets work together to create
whatever it is that is intended to
be communicated.
Ultimately, it is the ac
tualization of the intent that the
successful choreographer
claims, whether the intent be a
concrete idea, a pure movement
theme, a special mood, a feel
ing, a quality, or any combina
tion of these elements.
The dramatization of a cer
tain state of being seemed to be
an "intent" or a focus for two of
the dances. "Trace Minerals,"
the first piece on the program, a
solo choreographed by Tandy
Beal and danced by Kathleen
McClintock, dealt with the
evocation of a mood. McClin
tock, in a comfortably fitting
pink unitard traveled smoothly
and gracefully through space
occasionally brushing among
pieces of silver foil hanging
from the ceiling.
The music, by Keith Jarret,
with its continuous and even pi
ano sounds joined by a
melodious, almost lyrical sax
ophone. moved with the dancer.
The foil shimmered and cast re
flections on the back wall. Mc-
Clintock's serene smile con
tributed to the prevailing feel
ing of calm exuberance.
"Brace" danced by Betsy
Kagan and choreographed by
her and Deborah Slater was an
other piece that captured a dis
tinct quality of movement, ex
cept that this time the mood was
not so pleasant. The dancer's
constrained, segmented move
ments did not take her far from
a low black table slanted at a

slight angle which made up the
whole set.
To me, the table represented
a couch in a psychiatrist's office
which gave me a sense of psy
chological torture from the
piece. Slater said that one was
supposed to bring one's own ex
perience, imagination and in
terpretation in watching and un
derstanding the dance. She said
that the dance was about limita
tions, having them and living
with them.
The dancer, who was wearing
a white brace around her torso,
had actually had a back injury
and had to wear a brace not too
long ago. Her movements were
slow, absorbing and tense and
there was a sense of quiet anger
behind the controlled, isolated
movements.
A Shakuhachi flute excerpt
was the chosen music, ap
propriately selected for its
beauty, its sparseness and nev
er-ending quality. Surprisingly
enough, Slater said that the
brace allowed the dancer to do
things that she could not do
without the brace. So, "Brace"
was also about freedom found in
limitations.
The most well-received dance
of the night was the piece called
"Mama Would You Hold My
Heart A Minute?" The work re
flected choreographer Sara
Mann's background in im
provisation. Much of the dance
was formed by Mann giving a
task to the dancers — having
them improvise and then pass
ing judgement on their efforts.
The dancers — two men and two
women — seemed to be ev
erywhere at once.
Banterings, mutterings and
bits of song ditties about food,
about past relationships, sexual
happenings or the lack of them
were only part of the dialogue
that came shooting through at
the audience during the dance.
The piece stood in marked
contrast to the unimodality and
focused concentration of some
of the other pieces. Movements
were on many different levels,
some were fast and jerky, oth
ers sustained and fluid. Most of
the time, all kinds were occur
ring simultaneously in different
parts of the stage.
Although some people who
saw the dance may have felt
there was too much going on at
once to properly absorb any de
tails, this bombardment of stim
uli was the effect Mann was
trying to achieve. People inter
rupting one another, cutting one
another off, listening and not lis

tening, connecting and not con
necting is the stuff life is made
of. The title was fitting as all ex
pression was prompted by the
heart and not held in check by
any means. The constant action
in the dance was wonderfully
exciting.
That piece may have been the
audience's favorite, but my fa
vorite was the last piece on the
program, Leslie O'Brien's
"(RHE)Volutions." In a loose
all-white costume, O'Brien
began her piece downstage right
illuminated by light beams from
the other side.
I got the feeling that she was
being pulled in one direction and
that perhaps a part of her
wanted to go in another direc
tion — but that was only one part
of the dance, the Revolt part.
The "volutions" or turning
came from O'Brien's study of a
ceremony of the Melevi Sect of
Sufism called the "Whirling
Dervishes" in which spinning
plays a large role in entering
mystical trances.
The circles that O'Brien
made with various parts of her
body and through space were
beautiful movements. The in
tense repeating rhythm of the
music by Philip Glass and Eric
Muhler contributed much to the
hypnotic and magical effect.
Whether her piece really
"evolved'' remains a question.
O'Brien's performance was
excellent. She was so believably
entranced that it was easy to be
come involved in the trance,
too. In terms of what the judges
were looking for, the spatial de

sign, dynamics, music and cos
tume helped realize the con
c e p I . I think
"(RMEi Volutions" won the
prize
The judges' biographies are
as varied and interesting as
those of the choreographers;
many of them are dancers and
choreographers themselves. To
mention a few, Bella Levitsky
and Jeff Slayton run their own
company, Marc Wilde was a co
founder of the Pacific Ballet
Company and Narrye Caldwell

worked with some big names in
post-modern dance and music,
Yvone Rainer, Viola Farber,
John Cage and Philip Glass.
The evening was varied and
enjoyable and the dancers were
all very good but I am certain
the audience would have been
happy to have seen more. Since
all those who auditioned were
required to have four years of
choreographic experience, it
seems likely that there would
have been others equally well
qualified to perform.

was the chosen music, ap
propriately selected for its
beauty, its sparseness and nev
er-ending quality. Surprisingly
enough, Slater said that the
brace allowed the dancer to do
things that she could not do
without the brace. So, "Brace"
was also about freedom found in
limitations.
The most well-received dance
of the night was the piece called
"Mama Would You Hold My
Heart A Minute?" The work re
flected choreographer Sara
Mann's background in im
provisation. Much of the dance
was formed by Mann giving a
task to the dancers — having
them improvise and then pass
ing judgement on their efforts.
The dancers — two men and two
women — seemed to be ev
erywhere at once.
Banterings, mutterings and
bits of song ditties about food,
about past relationships, sexual
happenings or the lack of them
were only part of the dialogue
that came shooting through at
the audience during the dance.
The piece stood in marked
contrast to the unimodality and
focused concentration of some
of the other pieces. Movements
were on many different levels,
some were fast and jerky, oth
ers sustained and fluid. Most of
the time, all kinds were occur
ring simultaneously in different
parts of the stage.
Although some people who
saw the dance may have felt
there was too much going on at
once to properly absorb any de
tails, this bombardment of stim
uli was the effect Mann was
trying to achieve. People inter
rupting one another, cutting one
another off, listening and not lis

tening, connecting and not con
necting is the stuff life is made
of. The title was fitting as all ex
pression was prompted by the
heart and not held in check by
any means. The constant action
in the dance was wonderfully
exciting.
That piece may have been the
audience's favorite, but my fa
vorite was the last piece on the
program, Leslie O'Brien's
"(RHE)Volutions." In a loose
all-white costume, O'Brien
began her piece downstage right
illuminated by light beams from
the other side.
I got the feeling that she was
being pulled in one direction and
that perhaps a part of her
wanted to go in another direc
tion — but that was only one part
of the dance, the Revolt part.
The "volutions" or turning
came from O'Brien's study of a
ceremony of the Melevi Sect of
Sufism called the "Whirling
Dervishes" in which spinning
plays a large role in entering
mystical trances.
The circles that O'Brien
made with various parts of her
body and through space were
beautiful movements. The in
tense repeating rhythm of the
music by Philip Glass and Eric
Muhler contributed much to the
hypnotic and magical effect.
Whether her piece really
"evolved'' remains a question.
O'Brien's performance was
excellent. She was so believably
entranced that it was easy to be
come involved in the trance,
too. In terms of what the judges
were looking for, the spatial de

sign, dynamics, music and cos
tume helped realize the con
c e p I . I think
"(RMEi Volutions" won the
prize
The judges' biographies are
as varied and interesting as
those of the choreographers;
many of them are dancers and
choreographers themselves. To
mention a few, Bella Levitsky
and Jeff Slayton run their own
company, Marc Wilde was a co
founder of the Pacific Ballet
Company and Narrye Caldwell

worked with some big names in
post-modern dance and music,
Yvone Rainer, Viola Farber,
John Cage and Philip Glass.
The evening was varied and
enjoyable and the dancers were
all very good but I am certain
the audience would have been
happy to have seen more. Since
all those who auditioned were
required to have four years of
choreographic experience, it
seems likely that there would
have been others equally well
qualified to perform.

In just a little over an hour
last weekend, the audience at
the Margaret Jenkins Dance
Studio experienced five very
different but equally impressive
original dance works.
The pieces were a part of the
Fourth Annual Choreographers'
Concert of the San Francisco
Bay Area Dance Coalition. The
works we saw during one of the
three days of performances had
made it through a carefully
selected two-stage audition
process. The 97 submissions
were narrowed down to 30 by ex
perienced Bay Choreographers
and later to 11, six of which will
be shown on July 25 at the
Herbst Theatre.
Many aspects of performance
were considered — music,
dynamics, the use of space, set
ting, costumes, as well as the
dancers' ability to execute the
movement. But what is always
important is how all of those
facets work together to create
whatever it is that is intended to
be communicated.
Ultimately, it is the ac
tualization of the intent that the
successful choreographer
claims, whether the intent be a
concrete idea, a pure movement
theme, a special mood, a feel
ing, a quality, or any combina
tion of these elements.
The dramatization of a cer
tain state of being seemed to be
an "intent" or a focus for two of
the dances. "Trace Minerals,"
the first piece on the program, a
solo choreographed by Tandy
Beal and danced by Kathleen
McClintock, dealt with the
evocation of a mood. McClin
tock, in a comfortably fitting
pink unitard traveled smoothly
and gracefully through space
occasionally brushing among
pieces of silver foil hanging
from the ceiling.
The music, by Keith Jarret,
with its continuous and even pi
ano sounds joined by a
melodious, almost lyrical sax
ophone. moved with the dancer.
The foil shimmered and cast re
flections on the back wall. Mc-
Clintock's serene smile con
tributed to the prevailing feel
ing of calm exuberance.
"Brace" danced by Betsy
Kagan and choreographed by
her and Deborah Slater was an
other piece that captured a dis
tinct quality of movement, ex
cept that this time the mood was
not so pleasant. The dancer's
constrained, segmented move
ments did not take her far from
a low black table slanted at a

slight angle which made up the
whole set.
To me, the table represented
a couch in a psychiatrist's office
which gave me a sense of psy
chological torture from the
piece. Slater said that one was
supposed to bring one's own ex
perience, imagination and in
terpretation in watching and un
derstanding the dance. She said
that the dance was about limita
tions, having them and living
with them.
The dancer, who was wearing
a white brace around her torso,
had actually had a back injury
and had to wear a brace not too
long ago. Her movements were
slow, absorbing and tense and
there was a sense of quiet anger
behind the controlled, isolated
movements.
