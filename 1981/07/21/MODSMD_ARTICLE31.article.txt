## The 						'Gang of Four' in best concert I've heard 
### Tony Kelly H. Guinda 
G was in trouble. He recognized the
thudding sound of his editor's hammy
fist against a desk as easily as he did his
alarm clock in the morning. In fact, the
editor's fist was his alarm clock this
morning, waking G up from his cozy nap
in the newspaper office. Massaging his
face to remove the impressions of his
IBM Selectric pillow, G struggled to re
gain his hard-won journalistic dignity.
"Can I lick the spoon?"he said.
"Leave my yogurt alone!" said the
breakfasting editor, yanking his meal
away from the grubby clawing excuse
for a reporter before him. Christ, it's
eight o'clock and you haven't written a
thing yet. If this story doesn't get fin
ished I don't know what I'm going to do."
G was in trouble, and his experience
told him the first rule of work: if you get
in Trouble, Lie. ' Well, I got to the office
late, and I had to proofread this other re
view first. . ." Proofreading was an ac
tivity ranking just below "standing in
line" in G's list of cool things to do, and
this well-known fact sent the editor into a
frenzy as he realized G's lie.
'' What am I going to do with you, Guin
da? I need music reviews and you give
me sociological analyses of industrial
noise. And by the way, what the hell is a
Wall of Voodoo?"
"They 're this great band from Los —"
"Los Angeles bands should be quaran
tined and fumigated before going north
of Bakersfield. You remember that
Moody Blues record you reviewed for us
last week? You hated it, right?
Billboard's record charts came out the
same day, and the Moody Blues were
Number One. In the nation. In the world.
IN YOUR FACE. GUINDA!"
"Well there's no accounting for —"
Don't tell me you've got taste. Guin
da. You go to shows with audiences who
have purple hair and fleas God-knows
where and beat each other up. and you've
got taste What's the point of reviewing a
concert anyway? It all happened in the
past — you only make the reader feel
either glad he didn't go or inferior be
cause he enjoyed himself without taking
notes. Go home and get some sleep.
Guinda. The new John Denver album
just came in the mail — you can review it
when you get back. If you're lucky."
If he was lucky. If he was lucky,
thought G. there would be a leftover bot
tle of beer when he got home, and break
fast would be served. Yet even in this
splendidly comatose state, one thought

dominated Guinda's mind, and that
thought was REVIEW. Review what?
Why, that concert he went to last Tues
day, of course — he even liked it. In fact,
he would bet his newspaper paycheck
(not that G liked to gamble $1.80 at a
shot > that it was the best concert he had
ever seen.
Besides, another thought entered G's
mind — a grim, terrifying thought, suf
focating in its nature, repulsive in its
very core, brought on by the image of his
editor's face, lean and hard like a book of
rules, repeating the thought over and
over: JOHN DENVER. Like a demon
possessed. G rushed to the office type
writer and began to write.
GANG OF FOUR, The Elite Club, July
14, 1981.
Remember way back when the
Fillmore was the home of the' 'San Fran
cisco sound'' of psychedelia? When the
Dead, the Airplane, and other aspiring
transcendentalists filled the Summer of
Love with music from the corner of
Geary and Fillmore? Neither do I Bill
Graham shut down the Fillmore to rock
shows in 1968, and Lord knows what kept
him from closing down the whole city at
the same time.
For even then, the bands that played
the Fillmore were no longer the van
guard of a new sound, but merely the
tired protectors of newfound safe territo
ry. The Grateful Dead, for example,
were already one of the most ineffective
bands in the history of rock by the time
the Fillmore closed. Even a one-note
band like the Beach Boys could survive
indefinitely on the premise that even
though all they sang about was summer,
eventually the summer does come.
The Grateful Dead's reliance on
flower power never even had that
chance, and so they were relegated to
their legendary cult status out of necessi
ty more than anything else. The Fillmore
was a symptom of that musical futility,
and so its death thirteen years ago could
be more a case of euthanasia than
murder.
But now a surprising resurrection of
the Fillmore hints strongly at a second
chance both for the theatre itself and the
music played there.
Renamed the Elite Club, the theatre
reopened this month, first for a little
publicized sneak-past-the-security gig
headlined by the Dead Kennedys, and of
ficially last Tuesday for a Bastille Day
show by English rockers Gang of Four.
Besides being opening night for the
theatre itself, a number of factors en
dangered the success of the show: the

loss of bassist Dave Allen for unknown
reasons for the West Coast half of the
tour, the addition of replacement bassist
Busta (Cherry) Jones of Par
liament/Funkadeiic and Talking Heads
on a hurried gun-for-hire basis. Then
there is the fatigue of the band, the
asthma of guitarist Andy Gill and the
late move of the concert from the
spacious Zellerbach Auditorium in
Berkeley to the Elite Club in the first
place.
All in all, not a promising chain of
events.
So how did it turn out? It was the best
concert I have ever heard. And when I
say something like that, I'm not kidding.
Gang of Four were simply the perfect
band to reopen the old Fillmore, bridging
the major gaps of 1968 and today with an
ease and an intensity that is downright
frightening and exhilarating to see on
stage.
The evening began with a four-piece
band called Three Swimmers( ?) from an
equally unlikely hometown — Seattle. A
new wave band in Seattle sounds about as
easy to find as beach towels in lowa, but
if these guys are any indication, the
Northwest has been hiding something be
hind all the rain ("I knew there was a
reason for that weather!" shout con
spiracy theorists everywhere).
A rough combination of XTC and Gang
of Four, Three Swimmers give "quirky
pop" the good name it deserves after the
bastardizations of Devo, XTC, and vari
ous Numanoids. As a result I began to
think of the Elite Club as a pretty worth
while old place.
Between sets, "worthwhile" faded
away in favor of "outstanding," but the
reason wasn't on stage. In fact, the whole
intention of the intermission show was to
distract people from the roadies setting
up of equipment — something that ranks
just below "proofreading" on my list of
cool things to do.
The show was a slide presentation — a
four-screen panorama on the side wall of
the stage showing Indian artifacts
(yawn), Gary Numan (argh), the Eng
lish Beat (naah), comic books (yea) and
photos of bands at the Old Waldorf
(Yowl), including two shots of Wall of
Voodoo (orgasm). Amazingly simple,
yet effective in its presentation, the slide
show actually kept people inside the hall
during intermission, fighting their less
creative urges like thirst and waste pro
duction.
After the show, the lights soon
dimmed and Gang of Four bounded on
stage. "Paralyzed," the first cut off the

latest Gang of Four album Solid Gold,
features guitarist Andy Gill on vocals,
and his spoken delivery made the best
track on the album even more emotional
and heavy-metal oriented live. Gill ap
pears to be the major talent in Gang of
Four — his asymmetrical guitar figures
combine rhythms and melodies in con
stantly unforeseen ways, and his precise
use of timing is the key to the band.
Lead singer Jon King entered at the
end of "Paralyzed," restoring the group
to its usual form with a crackling ''The
Republic." King too has a remarkable
sense of rhythm, made all the more im
pressive by his constant motion and
energy onstage. At the end of a long tour,
he did have a problem getting up once off
the stage floor, but to count that as a dis
traction is akin to pointing out that the
Venus de Milo would look awful in a
bikini.
Throughout the set, Jones — who will
play with the Rolling Stones in Septem
ber — and drummer Hugo Burn ham
filled the gaps in the melodies with an en
cyclopedia of funky beats. Playing bass
for Gang of Four is no ea3y task, and
Busta Jones' dead-on ultracool style
added a new element to his temporary
bandmates.
Despite the preoccupation of the au
dience with pushing and shoving instead
of listening — the crowd probably ranked
just below the crawfish on the evolu
tionary ladder — Gang of Four returned
for three enthusiastic encores, the sec
ond of which sealed them in my book as
one of the most powerful bands around.
Anyone who still remembers, let alone
plays, the Velvet Underground is thought
of as a 60s doggy bag or an artsy-fartsy
aesthete, yet Gang of Four's version of
"Sweet Jane ' actually came close to
equalling the original. If only anyone else
in the audience made the implied connec
tion between Velvet Underground heavy
metal and Gang of Four Ueavy metal, or
1968 and 1981, or the Fillmore and the
Elite Club. . . then again, if no one did,
then maybe that's why there are concert
reviews. You're welcome.
A sense of accomplishment was in G's
soul; peace filled his heart. Immediately
after typing the last period in the review,
he triumphantly ripped the paper from
behind the keyboard and strode off into
the editor's office. G had beaten the
deadline, and having done so he skulked
out the back door, just as the editor's
pudgy, petulant footsteps were heard en
tering the office. Once again,, G was
saved at the nick of time. He who writes
and runs away, doesn't have to proof
read.

GANG OF FOUR, The Elite Club, July
14, 1981.
Remember way back when the
Fillmore was the home of the' 'San Fran
cisco sound'' of psychedelia? When the
Dead, the Airplane, and other aspiring
transcendentalists filled the Summer of
Love with music from the corner of
Geary and Fillmore? Neither do I Bill
Graham shut down the Fillmore to rock
shows in 1968, and Lord knows what kept
him from closing down the whole city at
the same time.
For even then, the bands that played
the Fillmore were no longer the van
guard of a new sound, but merely the
tired protectors of newfound safe territo
ry. The Grateful Dead, for example,
were already one of the most ineffective
bands in the history of rock by the time
the Fillmore closed. Even a one-note
band like the Beach Boys could survive
indefinitely on the premise that even
though all they sang about was summer,
eventually the summer does come.
The Grateful Dead's reliance on
flower power never even had that
chance, and so they were relegated to
their legendary cult status out of necessi
ty more than anything else. The Fillmore
was a symptom of that musical futility,
and so its death thirteen years ago could
be more a case of euthanasia than
murder.
But now a surprising resurrection of
the Fillmore hints strongly at a second
chance both for the theatre itself and the
music played there.
Renamed the Elite Club, the theatre
reopened this month, first for a little
publicized sneak-past-the-security gig
headlined by the Dead Kennedys, and of
ficially last Tuesday for a Bastille Day
show by English rockers Gang of Four.
Besides being opening night for the
theatre itself, a number of factors en
dangered the success of the show: the

loss of bassist Dave Allen for unknown
reasons for the West Coast half of the
tour, the addition of replacement bassist
Busta (Cherry) Jones of Par
liament/Funkadeiic and Talking Heads
on a hurried gun-for-hire basis. Then
there is the fatigue of the band, the
asthma of guitarist Andy Gill and the
late move of the concert from the
spacious Zellerbach Auditorium in
Berkeley to the Elite Club in the first
place.
All in all, not a promising chain of
events.
So how did it turn out? It was the best
concert I have ever heard. And when I
say something like that, I'm not kidding.
Gang of Four were simply the perfect
band to reopen the old Fillmore, bridging
the major gaps of 1968 and today with an
ease and an intensity that is downright
frightening and exhilarating to see on
stage.
The evening began with a four-piece
band called Three Swimmers( ?) from an
equally unlikely hometown — Seattle. A
new wave band in Seattle sounds about as
easy to find as beach towels in lowa, but
if these guys are any indication, the
Northwest has been hiding something be
hind all the rain ("I knew there was a
reason for that weather!" shout con
spiracy theorists everywhere).
A rough combination of XTC and Gang
of Four, Three Swimmers give "quirky
pop" the good name it deserves after the
bastardizations of Devo, XTC, and vari
ous Numanoids. As a result I began to
think of the Elite Club as a pretty worth
while old place.
Between sets, "worthwhile" faded
away in favor of "outstanding," but the
reason wasn't on stage. In fact, the whole
intention of the intermission show was to
distract people from the roadies setting
up of equipment — something that ranks
just below "proofreading" on my list of
cool things to do.
The show was a slide presentation — a
four-screen panorama on the side wall of
the stage showing Indian artifacts
(yawn), Gary Numan (argh), the Eng
lish Beat (naah), comic books (yea) and
photos of bands at the Old Waldorf
(Yowl), including two shots of Wall of
Voodoo (orgasm). Amazingly simple,
yet effective in its presentation, the slide
show actually kept people inside the hall
during intermission, fighting their less
creative urges like thirst and waste pro
duction.
After the show, the lights soon
dimmed and Gang of Four bounded on
stage. "Paralyzed," the first cut off the

latest Gang of Four album Solid Gold,
features guitarist Andy Gill on vocals,
and his spoken delivery made the best
track on the album even more emotional
and heavy-metal oriented live. Gill ap
pears to be the major talent in Gang of
Four — his asymmetrical guitar figures
combine rhythms and melodies in con
stantly unforeseen ways, and his precise
use of timing is the key to the band.
Lead singer Jon King entered at the
end of "Paralyzed," restoring the group
to its usual form with a crackling ''The
Republic." King too has a remarkable
sense of rhythm, made all the more im
pressive by his constant motion and
energy onstage. At the end of a long tour,
he did have a problem getting up once off
the stage floor, but to count that as a dis
traction is akin to pointing out that the
Venus de Milo would look awful in a
bikini.
Throughout the set, Jones — who will
play with the Rolling Stones in Septem
ber — and drummer Hugo Burn ham
filled the gaps in the melodies with an en
cyclopedia of funky beats. Playing bass
for Gang of Four is no ea3y task, and
Busta Jones' dead-on ultracool style
added a new element to his temporary
bandmates.
Despite the preoccupation of the au
dience with pushing and shoving instead
of listening — the crowd probably ranked
just below the crawfish on the evolu
tionary ladder — Gang of Four returned
for three enthusiastic encores, the sec
ond of which sealed them in my book as
one of the most powerful bands around.
Anyone who still remembers, let alone
plays, the Velvet Underground is thought
of as a 60s doggy bag or an artsy-fartsy
aesthete, yet Gang of Four's version of
"Sweet Jane ' actually came close to
equalling the original. If only anyone else
in the audience made the implied connec
tion between Velvet Underground heavy
metal and Gang of Four Ueavy metal, or
1968 and 1981, or the Fillmore and the
Elite Club. . . then again, if no one did,
then maybe that's why there are concert
reviews. You're welcome.
A sense of accomplishment was in G's
soul; peace filled his heart. Immediately
after typing the last period in the review,
he triumphantly ripped the paper from
behind the keyboard and strode off into
the editor's office. G had beaten the
deadline, and having done so he skulked
out the back door, just as the editor's
pudgy, petulant footsteps were heard en
tering the office. Once again,, G was
saved at the nick of time. He who writes
and runs away, doesn't have to proof
read.
G was in trouble. He recognized the
thudding sound of his editor's hammy
fist against a desk as easily as he did his
alarm clock in the morning. In fact, the
editor's fist was his alarm clock this
morning, waking G up from his cozy nap
in the newspaper office. Massaging his
face to remove the impressions of his
IBM Selectric pillow, G struggled to re
gain his hard-won journalistic dignity.
"Can I lick the spoon?"he said.
"Leave my yogurt alone!" said the
breakfasting editor, yanking his meal
away from the grubby clawing excuse
for a reporter before him. Christ, it's
eight o'clock and you haven't written a
thing yet. If this story doesn't get fin
ished I don't know what I'm going to do."
G was in trouble, and his experience
told him the first rule of work: if you get
in Trouble, Lie. ' Well, I got to the office

IN YOUR FACE. GUINDA!"
"Well there's no accounting for —"
Don't tell me you've got taste. Guin
da. You go to shows with audiences who
have purple hair and fleas God-knows
where and beat each other up. and you've
got taste What's the point of reviewing a
concert anyway? It all happened in the
past — you only make the reader feel
either glad he didn't go or inferior be
cause he enjoyed himself without taking
notes. Go home and get some sleep.
Guinda. The new John Denver album
just came in the mail — you can review it
when you get back. If you're lucky."
If he was lucky. If he was lucky,
thought G. there would be a leftover bot
tle of beer when he got home, and break
fast would be served. Yet even in this
splendidly comatose state, one thought

dominated Guinda's mind, and that
thought was REVIEW. Review what?
Why, that concert he went to last Tues
day, of course — he even liked it. In fact,
he would bet his newspaper paycheck
(not that G liked to gamble $1.80 at a

ever seen.
Besides, another thought entered G's
mind — a grim, terrifying thought, suf
focating in its nature, repulsive in its
very core, brought on by the image of his
editor's face, lean and hard like a book of
rules, repeating the thought over and
over: JOHN DENVER. Like a demon

GANG OF FOUR, The Elite Club, July
14, 1981.
Remember way back when the
Fillmore was the home of the' 'San Fran
cisco sound'' of psychedelia? When the
Dead, the Airplane, and other aspiring
transcendentalists filled the Summer of
Love with music from the corner of
Geary and Fillmore? Neither do I Bill
Graham shut down the Fillmore to rock
shows in 1968, and Lord knows what kept
him from closing down the whole city at
the same time.
For even then, the bands that played
the Fillmore were no longer the van
guard of a new sound, but merely the
tired protectors of newfound safe territo
ry. The Grateful Dead, for example,
were already one of the most ineffective
bands in the history of rock by the time
the Fillmore closed. Even a one-note
band like the Beach Boys could survive
indefinitely on the premise that even
though all they sang about was summer,
eventually the summer does come.
The Grateful Dead's reliance on
flower power never even had that
chance, and so they were relegated to
their legendary cult status out of necessi
ty more than anything else. The Fillmore
was a symptom of that musical futility,
and so its death thirteen years ago could
be more a case of euthanasia than
murder.
But now a surprising resurrection of
the Fillmore hints strongly at a second
chance both for the theatre itself and the
music played there.
Renamed the Elite Club, the theatre
reopened this month, first for a little
publicized sneak-past-the-security gig
headlined by the Dead Kennedys, and of
ficially last Tuesday for a Bastille Day
show by English rockers Gang of Four.
Besides being opening night for the
theatre itself, a number of factors en
dangered the success of the show: the

loss of bassist Dave Allen for unknown
reasons for the West Coast half of the
tour, the addition of replacement bassist
Busta (Cherry) Jones of Par
liament/Funkadeiic and Talking Heads
on a hurried gun-for-hire basis. Then
there is the fatigue of the band, the
asthma of guitarist Andy Gill and the
late move of the concert from the
spacious Zellerbach Auditorium in
Berkeley to the Elite Club in the first
place.
All in all, not a promising chain of
events.
So how did it turn out? It was the best
concert I have ever heard. And when I
say something like that, I'm not kidding.
Gang of Four were simply the perfect
band to reopen the old Fillmore, bridging
the major gaps of 1968 and today with an
ease and an intensity that is downright
frightening and exhilarating to see on
stage.
The evening began with a four-piece
band called Three Swimmers( ?) from an
equally unlikely hometown — Seattle. A
new wave band in Seattle sounds about as
easy to find as beach towels in lowa, but
if these guys are any indication, the
Northwest has been hiding something be
hind all the rain ("I knew there was a
reason for that weather!" shout con
spiracy theorists everywhere).
A rough combination of XTC and Gang
of Four, Three Swimmers give "quirky
pop" the good name it deserves after the
bastardizations of Devo, XTC, and vari
ous Numanoids. As a result I began to
think of the Elite Club as a pretty worth
while old place.
Between sets, "worthwhile" faded
away in favor of "outstanding," but the
reason wasn't on stage. In fact, the whole
intention of the intermission show was to
distract people from the roadies setting
up of equipment — something that ranks
just below "proofreading" on my list of
cool things to do.
The show was a slide presentation — a
four-screen panorama on the side wall of
the stage showing Indian artifacts
(yawn), Gary Numan (argh), the Eng
lish Beat (naah), comic books (yea) and
photos of bands at the Old Waldorf
(Yowl), including two shots of Wall of
Voodoo (orgasm). Amazingly simple,
yet effective in its presentation, the slide
show actually kept people inside the hall
during intermission, fighting their less
creative urges like thirst and waste pro
duction.
After the show, the lights soon
dimmed and Gang of Four bounded on
stage. "Paralyzed," the first cut off the

latest Gang of Four album Solid Gold,
features guitarist Andy Gill on vocals,
and his spoken delivery made the best
track on the album even more emotional
and heavy-metal oriented live. Gill ap
pears to be the major talent in Gang of
Four — his asymmetrical guitar figures
combine rhythms and melodies in con
stantly unforeseen ways, and his precise
use of timing is the key to the band.
Lead singer Jon King entered at the
end of "Paralyzed," restoring the group
to its usual form with a crackling ''The
Republic." King too has a remarkable
sense of rhythm, made all the more im
pressive by his constant motion and
energy onstage. At the end of a long tour,
he did have a problem getting up once off
the stage floor, but to count that as a dis
traction is akin to pointing out that the
Venus de Milo would look awful in a
bikini.
Throughout the set, Jones — who will
play with the Rolling Stones in Septem
ber — and drummer Hugo Burn ham
filled the gaps in the melodies with an en
cyclopedia of funky beats. Playing bass
for Gang of Four is no ea3y task, and
Busta Jones' dead-on ultracool style
added a new element to his temporary
bandmates.
Despite the preoccupation of the au
dience with pushing and shoving instead
of listening — the crowd probably ranked
just below the crawfish on the evolu
tionary ladder — Gang of Four returned
for three enthusiastic encores, the sec
ond of which sealed them in my book as
one of the most powerful bands around.
Anyone who still remembers, let alone
plays, the Velvet Underground is thought
of as a 60s doggy bag or an artsy-fartsy
aesthete, yet Gang of Four's version of
"Sweet Jane ' actually came close to
equalling the original. If only anyone else
in the audience made the implied connec
tion between Velvet Underground heavy
metal and Gang of Four Ueavy metal, or
1968 and 1981, or the Fillmore and the
Elite Club. . . then again, if no one did,
then maybe that's why there are concert
reviews. You're welcome.
A sense of accomplishment was in G's
soul; peace filled his heart. Immediately
after typing the last period in the review,
he triumphantly ripped the paper from
behind the keyboard and strode off into
the editor's office. G had beaten the
deadline, and having done so he skulked
out the back door, just as the editor's
pudgy, petulant footsteps were heard en
tering the office. Once again,, G was
saved at the nick of time. He who writes
and runs away, doesn't have to proof
read.
G was in trouble. He recognized the
thudding sound of his editor's hammy
fist against a desk as easily as he did his
alarm clock in the morning. In fact, the
editor's fist was his alarm clock this
morning, waking G up from his cozy nap
in the newspaper office. Massaging his
face to remove the impressions of his
IBM Selectric pillow, G struggled to re
gain his hard-won journalistic dignity.
"Can I lick the spoon?"he said.
"Leave my yogurt alone!" said the
breakfasting editor, yanking his meal
away from the grubby clawing excuse
for a reporter before him. Christ, it's
eight o'clock and you haven't written a
thing yet. If this story doesn't get fin
ished I don't know what I'm going to do."
G was in trouble, and his experience
told him the first rule of work: if you get
in Trouble, Lie. ' Well, I got to the office
late, and I had to proofread this other re
view first. . ." Proofreading was an ac
tivity ranking just below "standing in
line" in G's list of cool things to do, and
this well-known fact sent the editor into a
frenzy as he realized G's lie.
'' What am I going to do with you, Guin
da? I need music reviews and you give
me sociological analyses of industrial
noise. And by the way, what the hell is a
Wall of Voodoo?"
"They 're this great band from Los —"
"Los Angeles bands should be quaran
tined and fumigated before going north
of Bakersfield. You remember that
Moody Blues record you reviewed for us
last week? You hated it, right?
Billboard's record charts came out the
same day, and the Moody Blues were
Number One. In the nation. In the world.
IN YOUR FACE. GUINDA!"
"Well there's no accounting for —"
Don't tell me you've got taste. Guin
da. You go to shows with audiences who
have purple hair and fleas God-knows
where and beat each other up. and you've
got taste What's the point of reviewing a
