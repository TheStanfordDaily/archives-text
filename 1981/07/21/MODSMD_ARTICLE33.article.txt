# Pianist Adni seems carefree in life and music
## 
### Annie Macoby 
"You must perform natural
ly, instinctively, like you speak
a language," said pianist Daniel
Adni who, at age 29, brings to
music years of familiarity with
a language that has been his
ever since he performed a reci
tal of the Grieg sonata in E mi
nor in Haifa, Israel, at age 12.
The day we met Adni he was
dressed casually, blond and sun
burned from a sailing expedi
tion.
In a country where the arts
"were not held high above every
other discipline," Adni's said
his parents and teachers
carefully mapped his musical
training.
"I kept reaching the stage
when it was time to brighten my
horizons. I was very good, a real
uunderhind for Israel," Adni
described the rapid tempo of his
early years when he was de
veloping his musical scope and
technical skill. His parents de
cided to send him to study
abroad.
The initial encouragement
had come from Yehudi Menuhin
and stepped up the pace of his
early career. At 15 he went to
study with Vlado Permulter in
Paris — where he completed his
degree in only one year.
He performed his pro
fessional debut in London at age
19, without having entered a
competition. The pervasive
presence of competition as mu
sical method, Adni said, is dis
concerting. "It is ridiculous.
You cannot judge art," he said.
While Adni dismissed his
past, slices of it are still with
him, a shadow behind every

stage. With a legacy of 21 rec
ordings and 10 years of world
wide concert circuits, Adni said
that "It is not hard to begin a ca
reer; it is much, much harder to
sustain one."
The pressure is continual; the
successes loom larger and
further away. "You have to
always be very good; you are
always afraid of letting people
down."
Adni defies the mystical im
age of the "artist" with a capi
tal 'A.' His practical approach
to the piano comes off as a busi
ness rather than an art.
As a musician "you've got to
be honest, not pretentious," he
said.
Adni displayed his familiarity
with performing in his concert
last Wednesday night at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Originality strung the pro
gram together; the Grieg
sonata and the Schumann
Faschingschwank are seldom
performed.
"I don't believe in the tradi
tional meal," Adni said later.
"The standard bit of Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven is tiring. It's
important to vary the standard
course and the hors d'oeuvres."
If the objective of his pro
gram was to strike off different
perspectives of traditional com
posers, Adni clearly enjoyed de
viating from staid convention:
"The Grieg isn't a pretty piece
at all. But it is interesting. I first
learned it at age nine."
And, if past and present were
fused in Adni's playing, they
were embued with energy and

impatience.
Adni opened the program
with Debussy's Pour le Piano,
and moved rapidly into Chopin's
Fantasie in F minor, Op. 49. A
brooding piece, the Chopin is
structured as a progression,
gradually building up into a ten
sion that is relieved only in the
haunting theme that slips in and
out of a left-hand march.
Adni brought out the techni
cal weave, with deft passages —
but he did not lean into the mu
sic and draw out the melody.
The result was a medley of
sounds without scope.
Where Adni did not linger to
pull the tone out of Chopin; he
attacked, biting hard into the
piece — he failed to recreate the
broad embrace of the Fantasie.
There was a rush to Adni's
playing. His pose was comman
ding, yet he failed to grip his
pieces. He tumbled from com
poser to composer, from move
ment to movement, from
phrase to phrase. The result was
deft rhythm and brilliant pas
sages — in places.
Yet the pace quickened and
Adni was one step ahead, racing
from the Allegro moderato to
the Andante of the Grieg,
without lingering. His Grieg ex
posed an untrained energy — the

"instinct" that only at moments
adequately illuminated the ori
ginalty of his program.
Only the Schumann suc
cessfully caught and framed
Adni's impatience, revealed in a
concert that was tightly timed.
Only in that piece did Adni de
viate from his measured

minutes to translate into sing
ing, lyrical tone a language that
was otherwise only his.
A fine vehicle for Adni's
rhythm — with the condensed
themes in the Allegro, the
skipped phrases of the Scherso,
the chill of the Intermezzo; only
here was Adni in control.

"You must perform natural
ly, instinctively, like you speak
a language," said pianist Daniel
Adni who, at age 29, brings to
music years of familiarity with
a language that has been his
ever since he performed a reci
tal of the Grieg sonata in E mi
nor in Haifa, Israel, at age 12.
The day we met Adni he was
dressed casually, blond and sun
burned from a sailing expedi
tion.
In a country where the arts
"were not held high above every
other discipline," Adni's said
his parents and teachers
carefully mapped his musical
training.
"I kept reaching the stage
when it was time to brighten my
horizons. I was very good, a real
uunderhind for Israel," Adni
described the rapid tempo of his
early years when he was de
veloping his musical scope and
technical skill. His parents de
cided to send him to study
abroad.
The initial encouragement
had come from Yehudi Menuhin
and stepped up the pace of his
early career. At 15 he went to
study with Vlado Permulter in
Paris — where he completed his
degree in only one year.
He performed his pro
fessional debut in London at age
19, without having entered a
competition. The pervasive
presence of competition as mu
sical method, Adni said, is dis
concerting. "It is ridiculous.
You cannot judge art," he said.
While Adni dismissed his
past, slices of it are still with
him, a shadow behind every

stage. With a legacy of 21 rec
ordings and 10 years of world
wide concert circuits, Adni said
that "It is not hard to begin a ca
reer; it is much, much harder to
sustain one."
The pressure is continual; the
successes loom larger and
further away. "You have to
always be very good; you are
always afraid of letting people
down."
Adni defies the mystical im
age of the "artist" with a capi
tal 'A.' His practical approach
to the piano comes off as a busi
ness rather than an art.
As a musician "you've got to
be honest, not pretentious," he
said.
Adni displayed his familiarity
with performing in his concert
last Wednesday night at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Originality strung the pro
gram together; the Grieg
sonata and the Schumann
Faschingschwank are seldom
performed.
"I don't believe in the tradi
tional meal," Adni said later.
"The standard bit of Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven is tiring. It's
important to vary the standard
course and the hors d'oeuvres."
If the objective of his pro
gram was to strike off different
perspectives of traditional com
posers, Adni clearly enjoyed de
viating from staid convention:
"The Grieg isn't a pretty piece
at all. But it is interesting. I first
learned it at age nine."
And, if past and present were
fused in Adni's playing, they
were embued with energy and

impatience.
Adni opened the program
with Debussy's Pour le Piano,
and moved rapidly into Chopin's
Fantasie in F minor, Op. 49. A
brooding piece, the Chopin is
structured as a progression,
gradually building up into a ten
sion that is relieved only in the
haunting theme that slips in and
out of a left-hand march.
Adni brought out the techni
cal weave, with deft passages —
but he did not lean into the mu
sic and draw out the melody.
The result was a medley of
sounds without scope.
Where Adni did not linger to
pull the tone out of Chopin; he
attacked, biting hard into the
piece — he failed to recreate the
broad embrace of the Fantasie.
There was a rush to Adni's
playing. His pose was comman
ding, yet he failed to grip his
pieces. He tumbled from com
poser to composer, from move
ment to movement, from
phrase to phrase. The result was
deft rhythm and brilliant pas
sages — in places.
Yet the pace quickened and
Adni was one step ahead, racing
from the Allegro moderato to
the Andante of the Grieg,
without lingering. His Grieg ex
posed an untrained energy — the

"instinct" that only at moments
adequately illuminated the ori
ginalty of his program.
Only the Schumann suc
cessfully caught and framed
Adni's impatience, revealed in a
concert that was tightly timed.
Only in that piece did Adni de
viate from his measured

minutes to translate into sing
ing, lyrical tone a language that
was otherwise only his.
A fine vehicle for Adni's
rhythm — with the condensed
themes in the Allegro, the
skipped phrases of the Scherso,
the chill of the Intermezzo; only
here was Adni in control.
