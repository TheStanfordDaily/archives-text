# Acting saves 'Sent a Letter'
## 
### Becky Smith 
Another French domestic
comedy? ''I Sent A Letter To My
Love," directed by Moshe
Mizrachi, is a film about Louise
Martin, a middle-aged French
woman who cares for her in
valid brother, Gilles. They live
in a cliff-side house near a small
port town in Southern France.
Their only companion is
Yevette, a very prim young
woman who brings them fresh
bread every morning and stays
for coffee and gossip.
Louise (played by Simone
Signoret) is at a point in her life
where she realizes that she will
very likely die a spinster. Al
though she loves and is devoted
to her brother, the idea of dying
a spinster (understandably) de
presses her.
Gilles (played by Jean
Rochefort) is also middle-aged
and has equally strong desires
for companionship. But he
doesn't think women would find
a man with paralyzed legs de
sirable.
Louise decides to put an ad in
a love column. Gilles, not realiz
ing that it is his sister's ad, re
sponds to it.
A likely plot? We 11... a very
whimsical French plot. Haven't
we seen something like this
before . . .
Don't misunderstand me. The
acting is very fine. Simone
Signoret brings a wonderful
sympathy and charm to the role
of the sister. Louise.
Jean Rochefort is equally
good and very comical as the

frustrated invalid vho seeks
both high-minded lo e and base
sexual gratification
Delphine Seyrig, the prudish
baker's daughter, Yevette, is
also a very fine comic actress.
She sits demurely at the
Martin's breakfast table in con
servative dress with a promi
nent gold cross on her bosom
and talks authoritatively about
world affairs. While she daintily
applies her jam to her bread;
stories of two-headed babies,
drug rings, and poisoned fish
lying dead on beaches roll off
her tongue as sweetly as church
announcements.
The characters are all good.
The only problem with this film
is that it tends to blend in with
several other French comedies.
The same style, the love tri
angle, and the scenes with end
less dialogue.
During several breakfast
scenes, the camera movement
is reminiscent of a ping pong
tournament as the camera
swings back and forth across the
table while the actors talk and

talk, butter bread and sip coffee
from huge French coffee bowls.
The dialogue is endless. For
tunatley the acting is good.
Louise continues the cor
respondence with Gilles even
though she realizes that he
doesn't know that he is cor
responding with his own sister.
The plot is whimsical, sad and
sweet.
The relationship between
brother and sister is one of love
and devotion with a little bicker
ing now and then â€” but no pas
sion or jealousy, resentment or
incestuous questions. It's a
French comedy.
It's neat and sweet and when
things get sad they never get too
sad. No one is in real despair.
And there are the unanswered
questions. Why didn't Gilles
recognize his own sister's hand
writing? Why did Louise begin
the charade?
The plot is simple but "I Sent
A Letter To My Love" is saved
from banality by wonderful
comic touches and very fine act
ing, especially Signoret's ter
rific performance.
