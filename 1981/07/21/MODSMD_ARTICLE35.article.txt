Unions reject Postal Service offer
Washington — Two major postal unions rejected a re
vised last-minute wage contract offer from the U.S. Postal
Service last night and renewed their threats to call a na
tionwide strike.
But union and management negotiators — facing a mid
night deadline — decided to stop the clock and continue
bargaining.
"They have mutually agreed to keep talking," Nicholas
Fidandis, the federal mediator, said.
The U.S. Postal Service, seeking to avert disruption of
mail delivery, increased its wage contract offer to 600,000
postal workers late yesterday, less than seven hours
before the midnight strike deadline.
Earlier, leaders of those two unions had threatened a
strike at midnight last night unless the Postal Service in
creased its offer.
"The new wage package is substantially different and
contains new concepts," said Walter Duka, assistant post
master general in charge of communications.
"We feel that the (new) wage package ... should ad
vance the pace of negotiations," Duka said. "I think we
can still avert a strike."
Union presidents Moe Biller of the American Postal
Workers and Vincent Sombrotto of the National Letter
Carriers declared that the half-million workers they rep
resent were prepared to walk off their jobs. They said the
two sides were "on a collision course" at the bargaining
table.
Duka said, "I obviously disagree" with the unions'
assessment. "There is a legal, peaceful way for resolving
any impasse," Duka said, referring to provisions for bind
ing arbitration, an option union leaders have rejected.
"It has been our feeling that there is no sentiment for
any illegal action on the part of the vast majority" of rank
and-file postal workers, Duka said.
"We have contingency plans" for assuring continued
mail service, Duka said, declining to elaborate. In any
event, he said people should expect "business as usual" at
post offices today.
Haig defers F-16 shipment
Montebello, Quebec — The United States decided yes
terday to defer shipment of F-16s to Israel pending further
review of whether they should be sent, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig announced.
Haig said the president made the decision "essentially
in the context of the overall climate in the Middle East,"
where the level of violence has been escalating.
He said the decision was not related "in any way" to the
discussions being conducted by Special Envoy Philip
Habib, who is trying to arrange a cease-fire between Israel
and Arab forces in Lebanon.
Haig declined to describe the decision as either a "tem
porary or prolonged" delay.
Both four F-16 jet fighter-bombers due to have been
shipped in June and six others scheduled for delivery today
are affected by the president's decision, Haig said.
Making the announcement after Reagan conferred with
his top national security and foreign policy advisers, Haig
said, "The violence in the area will have a special impact"
on the president's ultimate decision on the aircraft.
Yesterday's decision to delay shipment was not linked
"to any specific action on the part of the government of
Israel," he said.
Rather, he said, it was "based on the objective reality of
the situation in the Middle East today."
President Ronald Reagan and his advisers were in Can
ada for the seventh annual economic summit conference
of major industrial democracies.

Haig said no other military equipment scheduled for
shipment to Israel would be held up.
Haig said the decision was based on "the president's
personal conviction that the United States must conduct
itself in such a way that its actions will contribute" to
peace.
Earlier, the president's national security adviser, Rich
ard Allen, said the administration was "very hopeful" of
arranging a cease-fire in Lebanon. But the prospects for a
cease-fire would not determine whether the planes would
be shipped, Allen said.
Jordan: Reagan policies dangerous
Washington — National Urban League President Ver
non Jordan said Sunday he believes President Ronald Rea
gan personally is a compassionate man, but his economic
policies "are a clear and present danger to black people."
Jordan maintained that the president's economic pre
scription will set in motion a "massive transfer of re
sources" from the poor to the rich while increasing "class
and racial segregation in America."
Even if the president's policies work, Jordan argued
that no provision has been made to assist the poor in the
period between the time when they lose federal aid like
food stamps and jobs programs and the time when the
economy picks up sufficiently to improve their condition.
"What is it that poor people are to do in the interim
while we are waiting for the 13 million jobs this package is
supposed to produce?" he asked, rhetorically.
Jordan talked with reporters before delivering a key
note address at his organization's annual convention. He
described the convention as an opportunity for the Reagan
administration, if it chooses, to reassure the poor, blacks
and other minorities about its intentions.
Vice President George Bush and five Cabinet-level ap
pointees were scheduled to discuss the administration's
views at the convention. More than 15,000 persons were ex
pected to attend the gathering.
Jordan said the Reagan budget was marked by "the
absolute absence of any compassion. " He criticized anew
the block grant concept which would consolidate pro
grams and delegate authority over who they served to the
states. Jordan said block grants are "a resurrection of the
discredited notion of states' rights, giving back to those
who tyrannized us earlier, power and funds."
Budget-cutter defends Reagan
Washington — Federal Budget Director David Stock
man accused critics of Reagan administration cutbacks on
social programs yesterday of using "careless rhetoric"
and of making "hyperanimated charges."
"Winnowing out ineffective programs does not mean
dismantling of all programs," said Stockman, who drafted
many of President Ronald Reagan's controversial spend
ing reductions, in an address to the National Urban
League's annual convention here. "But careless rhetoric
and hyperanimated charges can easily obscure that vital
point."
Though he acknowledged that the administration had es
tablished safeguards to slow the growth of the food-stamp
program, Stockman said that the federal government
would still finance 90 million meals a day for needy Ameri
cans next year.
"To suggest that the basic commitment to the program
has been abandoned is just pure fiction," he said. "Let me
suggest today that this selectivity of perception, this un
derstandable confusion of targeted reform with wholesale
abandonment of social programs, sometimes appears to
be boundless."
Stockman told the luncheon audience, which listened at
tentively but silently to his 25-minute address, that "you

would never know" that the Reagan administration had in
creased spending on such programs as Head Start, finan
cial aid for the disadvantaged for higher education, sum
mer youth employment and low-income energy as
sistance.
But Vice President George Bush, who also spoke to the
civil-rights group yesterday, repeated Jordan's criticism
and responded directly.
Bush said that some of the charges "were not only
wrong but also unfair," then added: "Let me remind the
critics that the old policies of the past have failed. The idea
that the federal government is the Moses to lead us to the
Promised Land has cruelly raised and then dashed the
hopes of millions of Americans."
In response to administration assertions that past pro
grams have failed to significantly improve the economic
condition of blacks, the league released a 176-page report
that drew the opposite conclusion. The report said that
"under-class" and working-class blacks have made signif
icant gains as a result of government efforts in such areas
as health, nutrition, education and employment. But
blacks have made less progress, according to the report,
as a result of decentralized block grants programs, the ap
proach generally favored by the administration.
Hyatt to reopen within weeks
Kansas City, Mo. — As the first victims of the Hyatt Re
gency Hotel disaster were buried yesterday, hotel officials
said they would try to reopen within a week or two and
might rebuild the walkways that collapsed into deadly
heaps of steel and concrete.
"Our intent is to open the hotel as quickly as possible,"
said Jim Dawson, a spokesman for Crown Center Re
development Corp., the owner of the $40 million, year-old
hotel. "The investigation is the first order of business.
Construction crews are working on how we'll be able to get
the debris out of the lobby."
At least five investigations are planned or under way
into what caused the worst disaster in the city's history
Friday night when two walkways weighing 45 tons each
crashed onto a lobby floor crowded with hundreds of rev
elers at a tea dance. The death count remained at 113 and
scores remained hospitalized out of the 186 who were in
jured.
The president of the redevelopment company, James
McClune, said the hotel might be reopened for business in
a week or two.
Stock takes sharp drop
New York — The stock market took its sharpest drop in
six months today as hopes for a decline in interest rates
suffered a new setback. Trading was fairly quiet.
Late Friday the Federal Reserve issued figures showing
a $6.9 billion jump in the money supply for the latest re
porting week.
The unexpectedly large increase was seen as a strong
deterrent to any plans the Fed might have had to ease up
on credit in the near future.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 18.36 to
940.54, its largest loss since it dropped 20.31 points last Jan.
20.
Declines outnumbered advances by more than a 4-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's weather
Dry through tomorrow with patchy morning fog and low
clouds. Lows in the 50s. Highs in the 80s except locally to
the mid 90s near Gilroy. Northwest windy to 15 mph in the
afternoons and evenings.
