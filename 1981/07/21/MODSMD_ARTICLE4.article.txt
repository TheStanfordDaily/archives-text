# Medfly battle moves to courts, onto campus
## Blockade by states start legal battles 
### 
From the Daily wire services
The main battlefront in the
multi-million dollar war against
the Mediterranean fruit fly
shifted yesterday from the San
ta Clara Valley of Northern Cal
ifornia to a Texas courtroom
where lawyers were fighting to
lift blockades by six southern
states against California fruits
and vegetables.
Long after his regular closing
hour, Judge Patrick Higginbot
tham of the U.S. District Court
in Dallas was meeting with at
torneys representing the state
of Texas and California
growers. The growers were
seeking a temporary restrain
ing order that would require
Texas to lift its strict embargo
against California produce.
In Los Angeles, represent

atives of several growers' or
ganizations said that the Texas
quarantine threatens the whole
agricultural industry of Califor
nia. They said they hoped a re
straining order by Higginbot
tham would prevent any at
tempts by other states to set up
their own quarantines.
At noon yesterday, Texas ag
riculture officials set up road
blocks to halt trucks carrying
California fruit and vegetables
on at least a half dozen high
ways in west Texas.
In Florida, at least nine pro
duce-laden trucks from Califor
nia were turned back, and South
Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana
and Mississippi were threaten
ing similar all-inclusive bans.
In Los Gatos, Gov. Jerry
Brown condemned the em
bargoes, suggested that they
were imposed for competitive
reasons by the Southern states.
"There is no rhyme or reason
to quarantine fruits and vegeta
bles that do not come from this
three-county area," Brown
said. He was referring to Santa

Clara, San Mateo and Alameda
counties which are infested by
the destructive pests.
Attorney Richard Lannen
represents the California Grape
and Tree Fruit League in the
District Court case in Dallas. In
asking for the restraining order,
Lannen said he understood that
the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture would issue regulations un
der the federal Plant Quaran
tine Act sometime today that
would take precedence over all
regulations or quarantines im
posed by individual states.
Lannen said that Higginbot
tham could issue a temporary
restraining order against Texas
which would override state em
bargoes until the federal regu
lations go into effect.
No such restraining order had
been issued as of yesterday eve
ning, although sources in Dallas
said that Higginbottham was
trying to get Texas' state agri
culture commissioner, Reagan
Brown, to voluntarily close
down the roadblocks.
