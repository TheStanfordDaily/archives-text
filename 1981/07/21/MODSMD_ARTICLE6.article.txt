## Defense report calls for big military build-up 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger's new
marching orders to the armed
services call for a military
buildup far beyond the big one
already revealed.
Weinberger's consolidated
"guidance" — a set of broad
strategic instructions — for the
upcoming five fiscal years en
visions some 200,000 more sol
diers, sailors and airmen, mil
lions in special breaks for the
military-industrial complex,
and a stepped-up research pro
gram, including developing
weapons needed to fight in
space.
Army leaders are prepared to
tell Congress that they do not
see how they can recruit the sol
diers needed under the five-year
plan without at least drafting
men to fill reserve units, cur
rently 190,000 short.
The Pentagon, General Ac
counting Office and defense ex
ecutives all agree that the mili
tary-industrial complex today
could not deliver in time the
weapons for the kind of long war
Weinberger wants the services
to prepare for.
Compared to the 8 percent of
the nation's gross national prod
uct that went into the Vietnam
war and the 15 percent that the
Korean war absorbed, Wein
berger asks the services to see
what it would take to gear up in
dustry to absorb half the GNP in
the event of war.
This year's GNP is about
%1.94 trillion, meaning that alter
the declaration of an emergency
Weinberger would like to have a
defense industry that could ab

sorb a military budget of about
$1.5 trillion for just one year.
This year's record-high peace
time budget is $222 billion.
The GAO said today's in
dustrial base is in such bad
shape that it "may mean that
the United States can only fight
a short war. . . . Huge gaps ex
ist between when military
stocks will be exhausted and
when production will equal
needs."
Weinberger wants a red-hot
industrial base turning out tons
of ammunition and thousands of
weapons within two to three
years after the declaration of an
emergency.
For this to happen, the gov
ernment would have to spend
billions in advance of an emer
gency to buy up and stockpile
such critical metals as
chromium, cobalt and titanium
needed in modern weapons.
Also, defense industries
would have to be prodded into
modernizing their factories
through faster depreciation al
lowance and other incentives,
costing the treasury additional
billions.
On top of buying new gener
ations of weaponry for the
Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps while preparing
the industrial base to accept an
emergency surge of orders,
Weinberger has directed the
services to keep spending mon
ey on experimental weaponry,
such as flying umbrellas for
knocking out satellites in space,
so the Soviets do not gain the ad
vantage there.
Whether the military ser

vices get all the money they
would need to carry out Wein
berger's guidance is an open
question. Already a number of
administration officials trying
to balance the federal budget by
fiscal 1984 are quailing under
the load of Pentagon bills piling
up for fiscal 1983 and beyond.
Cuts will be attempted.
There are other big questions
hanging over the Weinberger's
new guidance, such as whether
U.S. allies will go along with and
contribute to the Reagan admin
istration's expressed intent in a
confrontation to push the Sovi
ets in distant outposts where
they are vulnerable, not just at
the point of confrontation.

If deterrence fails and a long
conventional war with the Sovi
ets should break out, the gui
dance indicates that the admin
istration is counting on NATO
allies to help out in the Persian
Gulf, for Japan to help deny the
straits of the Sea of Japan to the
Soviet navy and for China
take enough aggressive action
to freeze the Soviet troops
deployed on its border.
Like the assumption that the
flow of money into the Pentagon
will continue unabated, those
foreign policy underpinnings
are subject to change without
notice.
The thrust of the Weinberger

guidance dramatizes that he
agrees with Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's recent
statement that U.S. rearma
ment must take precedence
over arms control. Draft lan
guage not embodied in the final
guidance showed how many on
the new team at the Pentagon
regard that proposition:
"Our first priority must be to
formulate and implement our
defense program so as to re
dress the current imbalance.
Consequently, our arms-control
policy should be framed to sup
port the defense program rather
than letting arms-control con
siderations drive our military
program."

regard that proposition:
"Our first priority must be to

Washington — Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger's new
marching orders to the armed
services call for a military
buildup far beyond the big one
already revealed.
Weinberger's consolidated
"guidance" — a set of broad
strategic instructions — for the
upcoming five fiscal years en
visions some 200,000 more sol
diers, sailors and airmen, mil
lions in special breaks for the
military-industrial complex,
and a stepped-up research pro
gram, including developing
weapons needed to fight in
space.
Army leaders are prepared to
tell Congress that they do not
see how they can recruit the sol
diers needed under the five-year
plan without at least drafting
men to fill reserve units, cur
rently 190,000 short.
The Pentagon, General Ac
counting Office and defense ex
ecutives all agree that the mili
tary-industrial complex today
could not deliver in time the
weapons for the kind of long war
Weinberger wants the services
to prepare for.
Compared to the 8 percent of
the nation's gross national prod
uct that went into the Vietnam
war and the 15 percent that the
Korean war absorbed, Wein
berger asks the services to see
what it would take to gear up in
dustry to absorb half the GNP in
the event of war.
This year's GNP is about
%1.94 trillion, meaning that alter
the declaration of an emergency
Weinberger would like to have a
defense industry that could ab

sorb a military budget of about
$1.5 trillion for just one year.
This year's record-high peace
time budget is $222 billion.
The GAO said today's in
dustrial base is in such bad
shape that it "may mean that
the United States can only fight
a short war. . . . Huge gaps ex
ist between when military
stocks will be exhausted and
when production will equal
needs."
Weinberger wants a red-hot
industrial base turning out tons
of ammunition and thousands of
weapons within two to three
years after the declaration of an
emergency.
For this to happen, the gov
ernment would have to spend
billions in advance of an emer
gency to buy up and stockpile
such critical metals as
chromium, cobalt and titanium
needed in modern weapons.
Also, defense industries
would have to be prodded into
modernizing their factories
through faster depreciation al
lowance and other incentives,
costing the treasury additional
billions.
On top of buying new gener
ations of weaponry for the
Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps while preparing
the industrial base to accept an
emergency surge of orders,
Weinberger has directed the
services to keep spending mon
ey on experimental weaponry,
such as flying umbrellas for
knocking out satellites in space,
so the Soviets do not gain the ad
vantage there.
Whether the military ser

vices get all the money they
would need to carry out Wein
berger's guidance is an open
question. Already a number of
administration officials trying
to balance the federal budget by
fiscal 1984 are quailing under
the load of Pentagon bills piling
up for fiscal 1983 and beyond.
Cuts will be attempted.
There are other big questions
hanging over the Weinberger's
new guidance, such as whether
U.S. allies will go along with and
contribute to the Reagan admin
istration's expressed intent in a
confrontation to push the Sovi
ets in distant outposts where
they are vulnerable, not just at
the point of confrontation.

If deterrence fails and a long
conventional war with the Sovi
ets should break out, the gui
dance indicates that the admin
istration is counting on NATO
allies to help out in the Persian
Gulf, for Japan to help deny the
straits of the Sea of Japan to the
Soviet navy and for China
take enough aggressive action
to freeze the Soviet troops
deployed on its border.
