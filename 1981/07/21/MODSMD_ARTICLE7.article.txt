# Breeder reactor overrun by costs
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Clinch
River fast breeder reactor, the
flagship research project for
the nuclear industry, is a man
agement fiasco and a growing
financial disaster, according to
a draft report prepared by a
House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee.
Congress is expected to de
cide this week whether to ap
propriate money for the Tennes
see project, which has been
bounced back and forth between
Congress and the White House
for five years. The Carter ad
ministration tried to kill the
project, but President Ronald
Reagan, an advocate of nuclear
energy, left $250 million for
Clinch River in his pared-down
fiscal 1982 budget.
But in a report timed to hit

just before the Hill vote, the
House oversight and investiga
tions subcommittee states that
the estimated cost of the project
has jumped from $669 million to
$3.2 billion — a cost overrun of
450 percent — and its much
ballyhooed technical achieve
ments may be greatly over
estimated.
Supporters of the project are
prepared to put up a stiff de
fense, laying a good part of the
blame for the cost overruns on
inflation, as well as on politics.
But other elements of the
staff report, supporters of the
demonstration reactor con
ceded, will be more difficult to
explain.
Chief among the criticisms of
the project is what the subcom
mittee staff called the most se
rious example of bad man
agement — the "unbelievably
loose," unenforceable contracts
written with Westinghouse, the
prime contractor. "It is not
clear whether this bizarre prac
tice is a symptom or a cause of
the state of disarray in the
project ... . With these con
tracts, the prime contractors
have no necessity to perform,
much less to exfcel — and they

haven't."
The staff report also charges
that the steam generators, a key
component of the reactor, have
so far failed to work leading to
further cost overruns.
In 1977, when the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission was
pulled off further safety inspec
tions on the project in a Carter
attempt to quash the project,
there were still more than 100
unresolved safety problems,
some of them enough to cause
serious accidents or even an ex
plosive core meltdown if uncor
rected.
The Department of Energy is
considering a move to cir
cumvent NRC safety require
ments as well as an updated en
vironmental iT tipact statement
required by Et-A by taking the
reactor from NRC jurisdiction
and putting it under Depart
ment of Energy jurisdiction.
The initial promise of the
breeder reactor was to make
more fuel than it burned. But af
ter 12 years of work and political
battles, the ground where the
breeder was to stand is still
empty. Parts are scattered in
warehouses, waiting.
