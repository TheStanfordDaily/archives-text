# World economy in 'stagflationary morass' says IMF
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The world's
economy is mired in a "stagfla
tionary morass" from which it
won't be able to extricate itself
for "a period of years," accord
ing to an annual world outlook to
be published this week by the In
ternational Monetary Fund.
As leaders of the major in
dustrial nations gather for their
annual economic summit in Ot
tawa, where these matters are
at the top of the agenda, the IMF
said that its "relative
pessimism" is caused by expec
tations of continuing high infla
tion, low growth and politically
painful levels of unemployment.
The over-all jobless rate for
the seven nations meeting in Ot
tawa this year will be 6.6 per
cent, well over the 5.6 percent
level of the 1975 international
recession, and threatens to
move higher. In a recent speech
in Paris, IMF Managing Direc
tor Jacques de Larosiere pre
dicted a 7.5 percent unemploy
ment level for 1982, which would
mean 25 million people out of
work.
Great uncertainty
The IMF cautioned that its
projections have been made "at
a time of great uncertainty and
of unusual problems," so that
the numbers should not be taken
"too literally." Nonetheless, in
terviews with top officials in
dicate the fund is convinced that
the broad directions suggested
are the right ones.
Although the IMF's analysis
— credited to the staff rather
than the Executive Board — en
dorses in principle the supply
side techniques of the Reagan
administration, it pointedly re
jects the administration's op
timistic forecasts for economic
recovery.
Compared to the White
House's recent estimate that
the U.S. economy would grow by
3.4 percent in real terms in 1982
(revised downward from an in
itial 4.2 percent estimate), the
IMF says that tight money poli
cies will hold the U.S. growth
rate to 2 percent next year. The
IMF also has a slightly less op
timistic view of U.S. growth
prospects for this year — 2.25
percent, against the adminis
tration's 2.6 percent.
Stagflation policies
To deal with stagflation, the
report reiterates the traditional
view within the IMF that there
are some forms of incomes poli

cies — apart from direct wage
price controls — that would be
useful. It mentions government
industry-labor negotiations on
wages in several European
countries and makes a special
bow in the direction of Japan,
where a common approach has
helped achieve a 3 percent infla
tion rate without "a severe
credit squeeze and despite a
large public sector deficit."
The report also inferentially
suggests — without naming the
United States — that managers
of monetary policy have an ob
ligation to see that interest
rates aren't pushed "too far." A
better "mix" of policy, so that
fiscal measures can take some
of the burden off monetary poli
cy, is a "relevant," if "difficut
and controversial" question.
European governments have
complained bitterly that high
U.S. interest rates have spilled
over into their economies.
Some encouraging aspects
Despite the generally gloomy
tone of the report, the staff
found "certain encouraging
aspects," in the world outlook,
mostly revolving about the oil
supply glut that is depressing
world oil prices. The report also
said most countries have made
a better adjustment to the
massive oil price boost in
1979-80 than they did to the first
one in 1973-74.
The IMF report showed that
industrial nations as a group
have been successful in finding
substitutes for oil. Thus, al
though their combined GNP last
year was up some 19 percent
from 1973, oil consumption was
about the same. In just the two
year period from 1978 to 1980,
non-oil energy consumption was
up by 7 percent while oil use was
down by 8 percent.
But the big problem remains
stagflation, primarily because
the strength of inflation and in
flationary expections have
forced most countries into the
kinds of policies — notably tight
money, creating high interest
rates — that depress activity.
That signals, the IMF said,
low growth on the order of 2 per
cent, compared to the 4 percent
pattern of 1976-79. "The policy
alternatives open to national au
thorities," the report said, are
likely to require not only con
siderable skill and de
termination but also sacrifices
by the public over a period of
years."

One problem that gets special
attention in the report is protec
tionism, although it applauds
the record of the major nations
in the 19705, when they avoided
across-the-board trade restric
tions. Many observers credit
this reasonably good record to
the pro-free-trade declarations
of the past six summits and an
ticipate similar resistance at
the Ottawa summit to any pro
tectionist initiatives.
But the IMF said that if it is
right that the general outlook
continues to suggest stagflation,
"increased vigilance and max
imum prudence in government
actions will be necessary." A
special analyis appended to the
report said that protectionist
pressures in the richer in
dustrial nations have been

mounting in the past couple of
years.
It cited, especially, the rich
nations' unwillingness to aban
don protection for textiles and
clothing industries, which have
gotten special treatment for 20
years, minimum import price
schemes for steel and more re
cent quota and other limitations
on automobiles and petro
chemicals.
Third World
Another main theme of the re
port is a series of scenarios to il
lustrate the possible financing
needs of the Third World coun
tries over the next five years.
According to the more op
timistic prediction, conditions
in the Third World will be
strained but manageable.

The assumptions are that as
the world gets toward the mid
point of this decade, the in
dustrial nations will move into a
3 percent annual real growth
pattern, while the less-de
veloped countries will continue
to grow, on the average, at a
rate of 4 percent to 5 percent. In
addition, the hope is that oil
prices will remain stable in real
terms, and that the developing
countries will wring some of the
inflation demand out
of their economies.
The pessimistic scenario as
sumes a worsening of stagfla
tion in the rich world, a further
boost in the real price of oil and
lower growth. That would have
a truly devastating effect on the
Third World countries, the re
port said.
