STOP KMT AGENTS
ON OUR CAMPUS
FACTS:
• Jan. 1981, Miss Rita Yeh was sentenced to 14
years imprisonment in Taiwan. The Kuomin
tang (KMT) regime in Taiwan alleged that she
participated in the anti-KMT activities in the
U.S. while she was a sociology student at the
Univ. of Minnesota.
• On July 3, 1981, the badly beaten body of
Prof. W. C. Chen of Carnegie Mellon Univ.,
visiting his family in Tawan, was mysteriously
found immediately after he had been interro
gated for 12 hours by the KMT secret police
KMT accused him of being an anti-KMT ac
tivist in the U.S.
WHY THESE TRAGEDIES? Recently, the sec
ret police of the KMT regime in Taiwan has
employed terrorist tactics to oppress Taiwanese
people. For many years, the secret agents of this
regime, at major universities in the U.S., have
been spying on the activities of students from
Taiwan and reporting any "deviations" back to
Taiwan. They intimidate Taiwanese on campus,
preventing them from speaking out on the
human rights issue in Taiwan. The retributions
often extend to the families of those accused.
Do you want this kind of disgusting activity to
continue on our campus? Do you want your
fellow classmates to become victims of this
kind of terrorism?
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
• Help us expose KMT agents on campus.
• Support the Taiwanese struggle for freedom
Land human rights.
