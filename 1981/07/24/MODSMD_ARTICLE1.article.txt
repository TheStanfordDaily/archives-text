# Medfly spraying to include campus
## Stanford, San Mateo will get first malathion doses sometime next week 
### Andres Fajardo 
Stanford University and a
large chunk of San Mateo Coun
ty have been added to the aerial
spray area and will undergo
their first dose of the insecticide
malathion sometime next week,
Mediterranean fruit fly project
officials said Wednesday.
University President Ken
nedy said about the spraying, "I
have acted all along on the ex
pectation that it would be
(sprayed).
"I was pretty convinced that
if they were going to spray it
would eventually include us."
According to Kennedy, some
University lands have already
been sprayed, but these were in
the original spray zone.
In addition, yesterday her

alded the first meeting of the
newly-formed Health Advisory
Committee. The Stanford-or
ganized panel is intended to
present a unified University
position on malathion and its ef
fects.
Night spraying of the area be
tween Crystal Springs Road in
San Mateo and Page Mill Road
in Palo Alto, bounded by high
ways 101 and 280, willdefinitely
begin sometime next week, ac
cording to California Food and
Agriculture Chief of Emer
gency and Special Projects Isi
Siddiqui. No specific date for
the spraying has been an
nounced.
Jasper Ridge, the Univer
sity's biological reserve, which
many Stanford scientists feared
would be endangered by direct
application of malathion, is not
to be sprayed, Siddiqui said.
Medfly-project spokesman
Bill Pope said that the exact
date and schedule for the
spraying of the Stanford area
will be decided upon and an
nounced by Monday.
The advisory committee
meeting held yesterday was
prompted by the California
Highway Patrol's suggestion to
Department of Medicine Chair
man Dr. Kenneth Melmon to
"do something" about panic
spreading among the public.
The Highway Patrol said that
conflicting health information
coming out of Stanford had un
nerved many Bay Area resi
dents.
Melmon, along with Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, Univer
sity of California Professor of
Biochemistry Bruce Ames and
San Francisco Chronicle Sci
ence Editor David Perlman,
sought to examine the existing
evidence on malathion and
reach a professional opinion
that would represent Stanford

as an institution.
The point of the meeting was
to disperse confusion caused by
such groups as the Department
of Pharmacology which issued a
statement on December 8,1980,
warning that "the fact that hu
man health may be
jeopardized. . .is reason enough
for considering other strategies
for combatting the fruit fly."
Professor of Pharmacology
Sumner Kalman later rose
before the group and said, "I
held my opinion honestly and
since the decision to spray. . .1
have taken myself out of the
public arena and tried not to
contribute to what has been de
scribed as panic."
Ames reviewed much of the
research done on the toxic
possbilities of malathion and
said,"So I suspect that there are
minor risks in spraying but
they're from helicopters
crashing into houses."
Perlman described the situ
ation of the media as one where
"an enormous flood of informa
tion (was> coming from both
sides" the tone of which swung
from reassurance to panic.
Kennedy summarized the
problem facing the committee
when he said: "It is terribly im

portant to know when to have a
consensus view to present on
behalf of the institution as op
posed to a set of more limited
views on behalf interested indi
viduals."
