# US officials reject Soviet overture for secret hot line
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — The Soviet Union
recently suggested a secret
channel of communications to
the Reagan White House in an
effort to reopen substantive con
tacts but the offer was promptly
rejected by Washington, ac
cording to well-informed
sources.
In a gambit that recalls the
secret dialogue during the first
years of the Nixon adminis
tration, the Soviets reportedly
made the overture in the ap
parent hope that a secret back
channel would draw the new ad
ministration into communica
tions on East-West relations and
arms control issues despite
President Reagan's anti-Soviet
rhetoric.
The U.S. rebuff reportedly
has led Soviet officials to take at
face value Reagan's public pro
nouncements and has strength
ened the impression here that
the United States has lost in
terest in peaceful working rela
tions with the Soviet Union.

The suggestion of a secret
back channel — an informal
method of communications that
bypasses formal channels — re
portedly was advanced by
Georgy Arbatov, the Kremlin's
top specialist on U.S. affairs, in
talks with several U.S. business
executives visiting here recent
ly. It came after the Reagan ad
ministration had spurned sever
al public offers including those
made by President Leonid
Brezhnev.
U.S.annoyed
When it was relayed to Wash
ington, Arbatov's reported ov
erture is said to have annoyed
senior U.S. officials.
The American charge
d'affaires here, Jack Matlock,
was told to see Arbatov and for
mally decline the offer. Matlock
told Arbatov the United States
would continue to rely on of
ficial channels, according to the
sources.
Both Arbatov and Matlock
have refused to discuss the mat
ter but Soviet and U.S. sources

privately substantiated the ac
count.
Kissinger precedent
Henry Kissinger, while serv
ing as then-president Nixon's
national security adviser, es
tablished a back channel of com
munications through Soviet Am
bassador Anatoliy Dobrynin. In
his memoirs, Kissinger said the
channel was designed to skirt
bureaucratic indiscipline, news
media and congressional pres
sures, and to give him direct ac
cess to Brezhnev.
The channel was used to
"privately clarify the
purposes" of the two govern
ments before major issues were
moved to the conventional chan
nels. It bypassed the secretary
of state and other senior of
ficials. When formal talks
reached deadlock, the channel
would be opened up again. Once
it included a clandestine visit to
Moscow by Kissinger to prepare
the 1972 summit.
Opportunity for Reagan
Arbatov's reported overture

may have been designed to reac
tivate this channel with himself
as the conduit and give Reagan
an opportunity to privately de
fine his purpose on Soviet-U.S.
issues, especially arms control,
without endangering his anti-So
viet reputation.
Both sides now appear eager
to put the best face on the inci
dent. Diplomatic sources here

quoted Arbatov as saying that
he had never made the overture
and U.S. diplomatic sources
suggested that the original
messages may have been
garbled.
But U.S. visitors have re
ported similar overtures by
Arbatov to open a back channel
of communication.
