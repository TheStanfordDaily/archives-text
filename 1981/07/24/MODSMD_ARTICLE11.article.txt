# GOP plans ad blitz to lobby for tax cuts
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Re
publican Party announced
Thursday that it will wage a
$500,000 media blitz to pro
mote President Reagan's tax
cut plan — the first time a
major political party ever
has bought commercials to
lobby for pending legislation,
GOP officials said.
The aim is to sell the presi
dent's program to the Ameri
can people and also persuade
them to pressure their repre
sentatives in Congress into
passing it next week.
The media blitz is an out
growth of the party's $9 mil
lion "vote Republican for a
change" television and radio
campaign last fall. That ef
fort generally was regarded
as a political success.
The message to the people
in the commercials is that
Reagan's proposed tax cut
(25 percent across-the-board
over three years) is a true

tax cut, while the plan being
pushed by House Democrats
is "no tax cut at all."
The Democratic plan calls
for a 15 percent cut over two
years that is tilted toward
the middle class, with a pos
sible third year cut if the
economy performs well.
Democrats contend that the
Reagan cut is tilted toward
upper income families.
Under the GOP media pro
gram, roughly $250,000 will
be spent to buy time on na
tionwide radio networks
starting Monday. Another
approximately $220,000 will
be used to purchase added ra
dio time in specific con
gressional districts — 20 in
eight states — where Rea
gan's strategists believe
there are wavering House
members. Roughly $30,000
will be spent on television
and radio commercials in the
Washington area.
