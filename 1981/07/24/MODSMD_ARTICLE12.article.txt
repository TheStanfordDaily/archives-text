# Graduate housing to be reallocated in the fall
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
The method for allocation of
graduate student housing is
scheduled to be restructured
this fall. According to Ted
Mitchell, director of summer
housing, this is the first step in
an attempt to discover an
equitable solution to the Univer
sity's acute graduate housing
problem.
Although at present it is only
a question of "allocating scarci
ty," said Mitchell, this should
be the first step toward a per
manent solution. At present,
once a graduate student has oc
cupied a residence, he or she is
entitled to remain in place until
the completion of studies. Be
cause of the scarcity of rooms
on campus, first year graduate

students new to the area face a
handicap in finding a residence.
The Graduate Housing Ad
visory committee has been set
up by Roger Whitney, associate
dean of student affairs and di
rector of Stanford Housing Cen
ter. It consists of Whitney; Jan
Marks, head of Escondido Vil
lage; and five students. This
committee and the Graduate
Affairs Committee of the ASSU
Senate have been questioning
various graduate student
groups.
The initial aim set by Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Lyons and
Residential Education Director
Norm Robinson was to find out
how to increase access to exist
ing housing. Graduate students
questioned were uncomfortable

with a proposal to limit the
graduate housing allocation to
one or two years. This was seen
as unrealistic in terms of the
length of graduate study. Thus
the debate veered more towards
a modified lottery system.
The present proposition is
similar to the undergraduate
system of housing allocation.
The University would set aside
enough places for all incoming
graduate students. First year
grad students have the most to
gain from a guaranteed housing
assignment.
Mitchell said that students
should not have to worry about
finding a bed to sleep in addition
to other preoccupations, such as
adapting to academic pres
sures and putting one's fi

nances in order. The main dif
ference would be that these first
year students would be filtered
into the housing system after
those in the lottery had already
been assigned.
This might provide a more
equitable division of present
housing, but does not deal with
the overall shortage. Mitchell
said, " we want to see the Uni
versity take steps to increase
the total number of spaces
available to graduate students,
and in the medium to short run,
allocating spaces in Manzanita
or in the new residences is an
important step. Long-term
plans must be made to construct
new graduate facilities."
The Graduate Committee has
proposed forming a task force to

investigate the possibility of
constructing new graduate
housing. Dean Lyons has ac
cepted this request, and will
form a committee at the begin
ning of fall quarter. The results
coming from this committee,
according to Mitchell, "depend
on who is put on the committee.
It could mean nothing. It could
mean concrete plans for con
struction within two years."
Lyons supports plans for
more housing, but requires de
tailed information regarding
exact demand, demographics,
and the sort of housing that
would be most appropriate. For
this purpose his committee will
be made up of members from all
groups potentially involved: the
