# Researchers testing a cure for hepatitis strain

Medical researchers here
may have found a cure for a liv
er disease that permanently af
flicts more than 100 million peo
ple throughout the world.
The disease is known to doc
tors as hepatitis B. It is a
chronic condition whose symp
toms, said research associate
Coleman Smith, may range any
where from fatigue and
muscular aches and pains to a
yellowing of the skin and eyes,
commonly known as jaundice.
In extreme cases, recurrent
hepatitis may lead to liver fail
ure and even death. In its
milder forms it affects tens of
thousands of Americans who be
come hepatitis carriers. These
include doctors, dentists and
nurses who can no longer prac
tice their professions.
Last month, however, Stan
ford medical researchers
launched a search for volun
teers to participate in a study
that seeks to link two drugs —
interferon and adenine arabi
noside monophosphate (Ara-
AMP) — with an effective cure
for hepatitis B.
Interferon has been called
"the wonder drug" because of
its use in the treatment of
cancer and many other viral ill
nesses. "Interferon changes the
cell so that virus production is

stopped," said Dr. Thomas
Merigan of the Division of Infec
tious Diseases. As for Ara-
AMP, Merigan said: "We knew
hepatitis was due to DNA virus,
and Ara-AMP was shown to be
active against viral disease like
herpes."
Volunteers for the study must
have hepatitis B, but the illness
"must not be terribly ad
vanced," said Smith. In addi
tion, volunteers must undergo
careful screening to ensure that
they "meet all other clinical
criteria."
Only about 10 or so persons
are presently receiving treat
ment, said Smith. Another,
much larger group is still in the
process of being screened. The
researchers hope to eventually
have 150 patients for the study.
The volunteers will be divided
into three groups. One group
will receive injections of Ara-
AMP alternating with in
terferon, the other Ara-AMP al
ternating with a placebo. A
third group of volunteers will re
ceive a placebo alone. Volun
teers will be placed in the
groups at random, and neither
they nor their doctors will know
which group the volunteers are
in.
"If the treatment proves ef
fective," Merigan said, "pa
tients who received the placebo

will be treated at the end of the
study."
The volunteers will be hospi
talized for only a few days in the
beginning of the study. After
that, they must report regularly
to the clinic for about six
months. Because the hepatitis
virus attacks the liver, liver
biopsies will be obtained at reg
ular intervals for a period of ap
proximately three years to de
termine the effectiveness of the
treatment.
Even if the treatment proves
effective, Smith said that it will
be a "long, long time, many
years" before the drugs become
available to the public.
"Interferon," he said, "is ex
tremely difficult to obtain.You
get it from the white blood cells
of normal people, and you need a
lot of blood donors to get even a
small amount."
At present, the only place you
can get interferon is the Red
Cross Blood Transfusion Center
in Helsinki, Finland, which has
been supplying the interferon
used in clinical trials in the
United States for the past nine
years, according to Merigan.
As for Ara-AMP, it is being
supplied by Warner Lam
bert/Parke Davis and Company
of Ann Arbor, Michigan, under a
special permit issued by the
Food and Drug Administration.

When asked about possible
side-effects of the treatment,
Smith mentioned "feeling tired,
and aches and pains."
"This is one of the reasons pa
tients have to be seen regu-

larly," he said, "so that if any
side-effects develop, doctors
can take steps to correct them."
The $2.6 million study is being
funded by the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Dis
eases.
