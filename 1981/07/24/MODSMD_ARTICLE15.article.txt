## Medfly motels stand vacant in the Big Apple 
### 
Ashtrays are a scarce com
modity, and a salad without
bean sprouts is cause for a scan
dal.
What passes for exercise —
jogging, bicycling, tennis, soc
cer, swimming — are outdoor
sports which weary me even on
television.
Few people seem openly in
terested in the two forms of ex
ercise which I passionately ad
vocate, neither of which re
quires being outdoors. One calls
for a disco; the other, for a part
ner (one or more, depending on
one's inclination), a reasonable
amount of privacy, and a conve
nient birth control method.
Welcome to California, the
land of bean sprouts, clean
lungs, and an inordinate fond
ness for exercise. Twenty-one
years in New York did not pre
pare me for this.
"Mellow out," I am frequent
ly advised. Mellow out? Accord
ing to my dictionary, mellow is
an adjective used to describe
fruit: "soft and well-flavored
from ripeness."
Santa Clara County, at this
moment in time, is not an aus
picious location in which to
aspire to be a piece of ripe fruit.

I have no desire to be plucked
from a tree, and placed in a con
tainer by the curb so that the
National Guard can properly
dispose of me. Mellow out? Why
bother? Have a malathion
cocktail instead. Simply stand
outside, open-mouthed, and let
the insecticide spray rain down
your throat.
What kind of wilderness is
this? Helicopters emit poison to
save the plants and harm the
people. Who will eat the fruit?
In New York, we have
cockroaches which can be an
nihilated in Roach Motels, two
per kitchen. Why not have Med
fly motels here? The general
populace, whether human,
animal or vegetable, might be
more amiable to such a method
of insecticide.
Yet none of the Northern Cali
fornians of my acquaintance ap
pear fazed by the insecticide
spraying. Perhaps they are less
inclined to consider the poten
tial health hazard involved be
cause this land, where the sun
always shines, is their home. It
is not mine.
I am accustomed to cloudy
days, rainy days, even in sum
mer. Such weather serves its

purpose; not only is it easier to
appreciate the sun when it
makes an appearance, but also
cloudy, rainy days foster in
trospection in a way that sun
shine simply cannot.
Too much sun seems to fry the
brain, disconnect certain
crucial circuits of the nervous
system. Is mellowed syno
nymous with well-fried, verging
on burnt? Or does constant sun
shine create cobwebs in the
mind?
When the weather comes in
varieties other than sunny, one
gains a different perspective on
the environment. Cobwebs do
not remain secure in the rain,
and do not exist in the cold. The
rain and cold one experiences in
San Francisco during the "rainy
season" here do not serve the
psyche as does new York win
ter.
Perhaps I would blend more
easily into the environment if I
were a laid back Californian.
Yet, I wonder, as does John
Leonard, formerly a New York
Times columnist, whether "laid
back is the same thing as being
etherized." Assuming it is, the
closest approximation of "laid
back" I have encountered is

when I am lying in bed, waiting
for my Valium to sedate me.
Hot tubs seem to be the Cali
fornia equivalent of Valium for
insomnia. However, I have no
ticed that it is extremely dif
ficult to drown in one's own bed,
whereas the quintessential Cali
fornian death is the drowning of
an overly-inebriated soul in his
hot tub.
Such a phenomena is as
unique to California as is the
California definition of a
chicken in every pot being a hot
tub in every backyard. Some
New Yorkers might deem a
country house for every Park
Avenue apartment an ap
propriate alternative.
Gatherings of Californian sin
gles are a story unto them
selves. The pick-up line, "would
you like to spend some time in
my hot tub?" while no more lu
dicrous than the corresponding
line often heard in New York,
"would you like to do some
coke?" still seems absurd when
asked in a bar.
Given the California em
phasis on physical fitness and
healthful food, consumption of
alcohol, itself a drug, seems
contradictory to the bean

sprouts-and-granola image dis
played under any other circum
stances. Consistency is lacking,
and does not appear to be a rele
vent issue in such situations.
And I wonder if the emphasis
on physical fitness which I have
observed results from an in
verse concern with emotional
health due to an absence of com
plicated thought processes —
the sun, once again. New
Yorkers are well acquainted
with rain, snow and the value of
psychiatry. One's psyche is
more important than one's mus
cle tone, as well as less prone to
sunburn.
Different sensibilities, dif
ferent Coasts. But, as Andrew
Sarris commented in last
week's Village Voice, "let's
face it, New York is still the Big
Apple." — and it doesn't have
Medflies.
(Nancy Frank, a born and
bred New Yorker, is currently a
summer visitor here. She will
graduate from Vassar College,
75 miles from Manhattan in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with a
degree in English in May '82.)
Maybe leaving Vassar will
mellow her out a little.

ficult to drown in one's own bed,
whereas the quintessential Cali
fornian death is the drowning of
an overly-inebriated soul in his
hot tub.
Such a phenomena is as
unique to California as is the
California definition of a
chicken in every pot being a hot
tub in every backyard. Some
New Yorkers might deem a
country house for every Park
Avenue apartment an ap
propriate alternative.
Gatherings of Californian sin
gles are a story unto them
selves. The pick-up line, "would
you like to spend some time in
my hot tub?" while no more lu
dicrous than the corresponding
line often heard in New York,
"would you like to do some
coke?" still seems absurd when
asked in a bar.
Given the California em
phasis on physical fitness and
healthful food, consumption of
alcohol, itself a drug, seems
contradictory to the bean

sprouts-and-granola image dis
played under any other circum
stances. Consistency is lacking,
and does not appear to be a rele
vent issue in such situations.
And I wonder if the emphasis
on physical fitness which I have
observed results from an in
verse concern with emotional
health due to an absence of com
plicated thought processes —
the sun, once again. New
Yorkers are well acquainted
with rain, snow and the value of
psychiatry. One's psyche is
more important than one's mus
cle tone, as well as less prone to
sunburn.
Different sensibilities, dif
ferent Coasts. But, as Andrew
Sarris commented in last
week's Village Voice, "let's
face it, New York is still the Big
Apple." — and it doesn't have
Medflies.

Maybe leaving Vassar will

Ashtrays are a scarce com
modity, and a salad without
bean sprouts is cause for a scan
dal.
What passes for exercise —
jogging, bicycling, tennis, soc
cer, swimming — are outdoor
sports which weary me even on
television.
Few people seem openly in
terested in the two forms of ex
ercise which I passionately ad
vocate, neither of which re
quires being outdoors. One calls
for a disco; the other, for a part
ner (one or more, depending on
one's inclination), a reasonable
amount of privacy, and a conve
nient birth control method.
Welcome to California, the
land of bean sprouts, clean
lungs, and an inordinate fond
ness for exercise. Twenty-one
years in New York did not pre
pare me for this.
"Mellow out," I am frequent
ly advised. Mellow out? Accord
ing to my dictionary, mellow is
an adjective used to describe
fruit: "soft and well-flavored
from ripeness."
Santa Clara County, at this
moment in time, is not an aus
picious location in which to
aspire to be a piece of ripe fruit.

I have no desire to be plucked
from a tree, and placed in a con
tainer by the curb so that the
National Guard can properly
dispose of me. Mellow out? Why
bother? Have a malathion
cocktail instead. Simply stand
outside, open-mouthed, and let
the insecticide spray rain down
your throat.
What kind of wilderness is
this? Helicopters emit poison to
save the plants and harm the
people. Who will eat the fruit?
In New York, we have
cockroaches which can be an
nihilated in Roach Motels, two
per kitchen. Why not have Med
fly motels here? The general
populace, whether human,
animal or vegetable, might be
more amiable to such a method
of insecticide.
Yet none of the Northern Cali
fornians of my acquaintance ap
pear fazed by the insecticide
spraying. Perhaps they are less
inclined to consider the poten
tial health hazard involved be
cause this land, where the sun
always shines, is their home. It
is not mine.
I am accustomed to cloudy
days, rainy days, even in sum
mer. Such weather serves its

purpose; not only is it easier to
appreciate the sun when it
makes an appearance, but also
cloudy, rainy days foster in
trospection in a way that sun
shine simply cannot.
Too much sun seems to fry the
brain, disconnect certain
crucial circuits of the nervous
system. Is mellowed syno
nymous with well-fried, verging
on burnt? Or does constant sun
shine create cobwebs in the
mind?
When the weather comes in
varieties other than sunny, one
gains a different perspective on
the environment. Cobwebs do
not remain secure in the rain,
and do not exist in the cold. The
rain and cold one experiences in
San Francisco during the "rainy
season" here do not serve the
psyche as does new York win
ter.
Perhaps I would blend more
easily into the environment if I
were a laid back Californian.
Yet, I wonder, as does John
Leonard, formerly a New York
Times columnist, whether "laid
back is the same thing as being
etherized." Assuming it is, the
closest approximation of "laid
back" I have encountered is

when I am lying in bed, waiting
for my Valium to sedate me.
Hot tubs seem to be the Cali
fornia equivalent of Valium for
insomnia. However, I have no
ticed that it is extremely dif
ficult to drown in one's own bed,
whereas the quintessential Cali
fornian death is the drowning of
an overly-inebriated soul in his
