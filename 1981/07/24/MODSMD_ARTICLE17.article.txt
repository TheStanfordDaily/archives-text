"Population control or race to oblivion?
"The Population Bomb.
"While you are reading these words four
people will have died from starvation. Most
of them children.
"The population bomb keeps ticking."
In 1968, these loud announcements were
splashed on the cover of a best-seller by
Stanford's premier population biologist,
Paul Ehrlich. Only the most insensitive of
souls could read the cover of The Popu
lation Homb and not open the book.
Ehrlich had resorted to a shoddy version
of yellow journalism to ensnare the reader.
His partisans argue that the trap was utili
tarian in that it presented the population
problem to the laity. Furthermore, the
reader could always shelve the book; if an
illicit trap had been set, it was victimless.
But was it? Is there no concern for
credibility? Had not Ehrlich become a
tough-talking prostitute of population

This discussion of Ehrlich's 13-year
old Population Bomb is revived in light of
Carl Johnston's editorial (Daily, July 21).
Over-population remained a "page 17" is
sue until Ehrlich applied his deft touch of
cosmetics. Once on the "front page," The
Population homb exploded into the Ameri

can psyche; suddenly, people were "con
cerned" about starving Indians and
malnutritioned Chinese. However, this
"concern" lasted but a few days — the time
necessary to generate a different eye-grab
bing issue.
The results of the move to the "front
page" were mostly negative: (1) the public
incorrectly believed it had been educated
(the poorly educated are always more dan
gerous than the uneducated), and (2) a dist
inguished scientist's reputation was
tarnished (even when reading Paul and
Anne Ehrlich's scholarly Population Re
sources Environment: Issues in Human
Ecology, I wince from the misinformation
in the Population Homb).
Each writer or institution has his (its)
unique political and philosophical outlook. A
readership is built around that ideology, and
therein a circle of confidence is developed:
the Washington Post places priority on
news from the Capitol, thus its readers have
come to expect first rate political analysis;
the Stanford Daily dissects the Army De
partment's letter outlining military con
scription instead of Jose Lopez Portillo's
censorship decree, because it too has a spe
cific readership — one that demands cov
erage of events important to students.

Similarly, Ehrlich had developed a
following in the intellectual community. By
sacrificing that community's trust to build a
wider audience, Ehrlich exposed
his Freville Fane alter ego.
Those hungry for accuracy will read
beyond the "pastry-shop-papers' page 17
fillers." They look to the "significant"
newspapers, thus the integrity of these jour
nals must be preserved. The means of main
taining this integrity is to permit the
"pastry-shop-papers" to publish their fluff.
When the reader is satiated with the sensa
tionalism and is intellectually mature, he
can always turn to the pages fulfilling their
journalistic duty.
Both the significant and the insignificant
newpaper styles provide a service. To
diminish this diversity is to take the first
step to occupational suicide. Though the de
mand for an uniformly responsible print
media is noble, it is naive idealism; the
scenario for such a mandate envisages uni
form mediocrity.
Let us treasure the few enlightened mem
bers of the writers' guild and hope they do
not succumb to the pressures of the Ehrlich
syndrome (better known, today, as the
Janet Cooke syhflromer
(Rajesh Oza lives in Morgan Hill.)
