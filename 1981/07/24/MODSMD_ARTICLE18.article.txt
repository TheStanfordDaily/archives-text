Terrorist Begin
Once again the Middle East is
about to explode. More than
ever before, there is one man
most responsible for this, Men
achem Begin, prime minister of
the state of Israel, a dangerous,
deluded fanatic and an ex-ter
rorist who has learned little.
The most significant achieve
ment of his younger days, the
blowing up of the King David
Hotel in Jerusalem and killing
scores of innocent civilians is
child's play in comparison to the
course that he has chosen for Is
rael, one of very violent con
frontation with the Arab and en
tire Islamic world.
It is very unfortunate that he
and his extremist Likud party
have been returned to power in
the recent Israeli election with
very grave consequences for the
whole world and most of all for
Israel itself. They have asked
for it, and they have got it. Be
gin's government says that they
won't negotiate with the
Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) because it is a

terrorist organization com
mitted to the extinction of the
state of Israel.
By the same token the Israel
is are a terrorist band whose
U.S.-made war planes bomb and
kill scores of Palestenians and
Lebanese every day and are
thus brazenly committed to the
destruction of Lebanon.
And Israel's treatment of the
moderate mayors of West Bank
Arab cities is atrocious by any
standards.
The only sane course for Is
rael is to start negotiating with
the PLO. The alternative is
frightening. Israel has to main
tain its technological superior
ity with the Arab countries
striving to close the gap. Israel
and its Arab neighbors will be
like two men spending their en
tire life time stabbing each oth
er to death. What a price for a
meaningless purchase of a tem
porary security bought with a
transient technological superi
ority.
The least that the United
States can do is to stop all arma
ment shipments to Israel until
Begin s government is willing to
sit and negotiate with the PLO.
As for myself, as a scientist and
engineer, I will have nothing to
do with the government and the
institutions of Israel as long as
Begin and his kind rule that
country. Former President
Jimmy Carter said correctly
that the Soviets have to pay a
price for invading Afghanistan.
Israel must pay a price too.
The scientific community in
the United States should forego
the pleasure of interchanging
information and technology
with Israel just as they have
done with the Soviets for their
rough shodding human rights.
Israel is currently committed to
the death and destruction of en
tire nations, and we share the
guilt if we just watch it passive
ly and couldn't care less.
