## Foreign policy as muddled as ever 
### 
Thus far, President Ronald
Reagan has failed to live up to
his campaign promises of de
veloping a coherent and suc
cessful foreign policy. The con
fusion and disarray that plagued
the Carter administration have
been equally or more prominent
under the new administration.
American foreign policy un
der Reagan has been character
ized by abrupt shifts in policy by
the following and self-defeating
actions:
— Soon after taking office,
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig proclaimed El Salvador as
a crucial testing ground for
American resolve. But then, as
opposition to this policy
mounted and as the focus of po
litical debate shifted to
domestic matters, the El
Salvador issue disappeared
almost as quickly as it had
emerged. Meanwhile, the ruling
junta, backed by U.S. military
aid, has stiffened its resolve not
to seek a negotiated end to the
conflict.
— The administration has
adopted a policy of tough
rhetoric toward the Soviet
Union and has encouraged our
allies to reduce their trade with
the Soviets. Yet it was only a
short time ago that Reagan suc
cumbed to domestic pressure in
lifting the U.S. grain embargo
that had been imposed after the
invasion of Afghanistan.
Moreover, the administration
recently permitted an Ameri
can track team to compete in
Leningrad — in stark contrast to
the Olympic boycott a year ago.
— After his election, Reagan
promised to discard the un
ratified SALT II treat and to be
gin new strategic arms control
negotiations with the Soviet
Union "immediately." But
now, after six months have al
ready dragged by, Eugene
Rostow, the recently-appointed
director of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, has
indicated that new strategic
arms talks may not begin until
next March or later.
— In the Middle East, Haig at
tempted to form a "strategic
consensus" focusing on the
threat of Soviet expansionism.
But he ran into problems when
he discovered that the Arab
countries in the region were
more concerned about Israel
than they were about the Soviet
Union.
— While nominally continuing
long-standing U.S. policies of
opposition to apartheid and to

South Africa's occupation of
Namibia, the Reagan adminis
tration has in fact been moving
toward a possible military rela
tionship with South Africa, ap
parently without demanding
any South African concessions
in return. Yet the adminis
tration expressed indignation
when the countries of the Or
ganization of African Unity con
demned what they see as a
greater American willingness
to tolerate racial repression and
to accept South Africa's control
of Namibia.
As these examples illustrate,
there has been incoherence in
all aspects of foreign affairs —
from international economic
policy and the Middle East to
the China-Taiwan problem and
U.S.-Soviet relations. Even in
terms of defense policy, the ad
ministration has failed to de
velop a viable strategy for car
rying out a necessary military
buildup; instead, it has merely
proposed to spend more money.
Some of the causes of this for
eign policy disarray are, of
course, beyond the adminis
tration's control; nevertheless,
most of the blame for the con
fusion must be placed directly
on the administration.
For one thing, it has become
more and more apparent in re
cent weeks that Reagan himself
is embarassingly uninformed
about a broad range of foreign
policy issues. The President be
lieves in a simple world in which
"good foreign policy is the use
of good common sense in deal
ing with friends and potential
adversaries."
Unfortunately, as Robert Os
good has pointed out, in the
absence of adequate knowledge
and a conceptual framework,
the world is too "uncommon and
unpredictable, with too many
variables and conflict to be re
solved by common sense"
alone. Although Reagan and
several of his advisers may find
it attractive to view events

through a simplified East-West
prism, they are, in the process,
overlooking many of the com
plex indigenous factors that are
actually involved in any given
situation.
Another source of at least
part of the current disarray in
American foreign policy is the
fact that no one really knows
who is in charge. Secretary
Haig's thinly concealed Presi
dential ambitions have induced
White House officials to prevent
him from becoming the "vicar"
of foreign policy he had ori
ginally hoped to be.
There have been notable
clashes between Haig and De
fense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger over Poland and over the
sale of AW ACS to Saudi Arabia.
Presidential counsel Edwin
Meese, national security ad
viser Richard Allen, and even
Agriculture Secretary John
Block have also intervened in
various foreign policy de
cisions.
This infighting and bickering
is all too reminiscent of the con
fusion that existed under Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. Evidently,
the Reagan administration has
not yet learned from the mis
takes of its predecessor in this
regard.
Reagan's failure to work out a
coherent policy framework, his
tendency to view the world in
simplistic terms, and his seem
ing tolerance of conflicts among
his advisers have created uncer
tainty and doubt among both our
allies and our adversaries.
It will be essential for the ad
ministration to develop a
purposeful and unified foreign
policy strategy — a strategy
that is consistent in its approach
yet adaptable to the needs of a
changing and complex interna
tional environment.
