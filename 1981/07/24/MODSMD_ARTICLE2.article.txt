Washington — The com
promise budget bill finalized
Tuesday night by a Con
gressional conference commit
tee contains changes in the
Guaranteed Student Loan
(GSL) and National Direct Stu
dent Loan (NDSL) programs
that may cost Stanford students
millions of dollars in lost loans.
Under the proposed measure
students whose parents earn
less than $30,000 would qualify
for GSL loans and students from
families earning more than
$30,000 could qualify for loans
only by demonstrating financial
need.
The conference report de
fined financial need as "the cost
of attendance less estimated
family contribution less esti

Also, an "origination fee" of
about 5 percent of the principal
will be instituted. This would be
deducted from the amount the
student actually receives.

are part of the budget bill that
must still be approved by both
the House and Senate, "passage
is almost virtually assured —
it's too late in the process to
make major revisions," said a
lobbyist who has been monitor
ing the budget bills closely.
The current GSL program al
lows undergraduates to borrow
up to $2500 per year and gradu
ate students $5000 from a partic
ipating bank. The federal gov
ernment guarantees the loan
and pays the interest while the
student is in school. Borrowers
need not demonstrate financial
need.
According to Robert Huff, Di
rector of financial aid , 4500
Stanford students (including
2000 graduate students) bor
rowed a total of $13-14 million
during academic year 1980-81
through the GSL program. He
estimated that one-third of
those students would be in
