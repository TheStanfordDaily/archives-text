# OSOC organizer may lose SLAC job
## 
### Cici Oremland 
When a majority of the Uni
versity's 1700 clerical workers
voted against union representa
tion earlier this year, the work
of the Office Staff Organizing
Committee (OSOC) which
championed the effort had to be
reorganized to fight different
kinds of battles.
Now it seems OSOC organizer
Joyce Tipps-Coats is fighting a
new personal battle of her own,
as a pending "reorganization"
of her office at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
may cost her her job.
Last August she filed an un
fair labor practice grievance
against the University because
of a disciplinary note added to
her performance file by her su

heavy electronics division of the
Linear Accelerator Center.
According to Tipps-Coats, the
letter said that she was using
"SLAC time for non-SLAC busi

In June she won her grievence
and the University was forced to
remove the letter from her file
and put up publicly visible no

The next day she was shown
her performance file that rec
ommended her for a zero per

tember. She had previously
been placed under the merit

earned her up to a 22 per cent
pay increase.
Other non-merit status
clericals are eligible for pay
raises of up to twelve per cent.
"Doug Dupen (Director of
Personnel at SLAC) told me
that my salary was now being
negotiated with my boss (Olsen)
and Personnel," said Tipps-
Coats.
In the meantime, University
employees have been informed
that Olsen will be retiring this
September and that Raymond
