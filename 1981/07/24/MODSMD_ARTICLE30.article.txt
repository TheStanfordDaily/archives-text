# Medical experts convene to discuss psoriasis cures

Most of the finest minds in the
field convened at the Stanford
Hospital last week for the Third
International Psoriasis Sym
posium. The research presented
gave an example of medical sci
ence in action, an attack on a
disease mounted from all sides
at once.
It was "very, very exciting,"
said Dr. Eugene Farber, chair
man of the University depart
ment of dermatology.
The symposium featured re
sults from the clinical,
epidemiological, and laboratory
sides of the field, both in
novative pioneerings and refine
ments of existing techniques,
with contributors coming from
every continent to attend.
"An excellent mix of future
and current," said Isser Brody,
M.D., who had travelled from
Sweden to describe membrane
modifications discovered
through the use of his electron
microscope.
The disease in question,
psoriasis, is a chronic, recur
rent skin disease. Skin cells in
the involved areas of the body
multiply at six to seven times
the normal rate, producing
thick, red, silvery-scaled
patches on the skin. The cause of
this process is unknown, but the
result may be severe discom

fort, disfigurement, and dis
ability for the victim. Accord
ing to Farber, "Psoriasis
doesn't take life, but it may well
ruin it."
New drug
Man-modified molecules of
vitamin A are proving capable
of controlling severe cases of
psoriasis, according to findings
presented by Dr. Constantin Or
fanos, chairman of the depart
ment of dermatology in the Free
University of Berlin, and by Dr.
Werner Bollag, head of the
cancer research laboratories of
Hoffmann-La Roche and Co. in
Basil, Switzerland.
According to Orfanos, in the
clinical studies already done,
almost 90 percent of the patients
with severe psoriasis were
helped by treatment with
aromatic retinoids ("retinoids"
is a catch-all name for vitamin
A and its naturally-occuring and
synthetic modified forms). In
general, 61 percent of psoriasis
patients have a good to excellent
response to the aromatic re
tinoid treatment, he said.
"This is one of the most excit
ing drugs in the history of
dermatology," said Farber. "It
is a major breakthrough."
East meets West
From the People's Republic
of China came a different ap
proach to the treatment of

psoriasis, the use of traditional,
herbal medicines. For the past
3000 to 4000 years, explained Dr.
Hung-chiung Li, head of the de
partment of dermatology at
Capital Hospital in Beijing, the
Chinese have practiced herbal
medicine. To treat psoriasis,
they looked for the appropriate
herb.
Tripterygium, or "Hook 7",
had been used to treat
rheumatic arthritis, and has
since been found to be useful in
treating psoriasis. The root is
powdered, boiled, and filtered.
The patient drinks half the
filtrate in the morning and the
other half in the evening.
In addition, this treatment
has been found to interact well
with Western pharmaceutical
techniques, with the combina
tion of the two approaches more
effective than either alone.
Reduced cancer risk
One difficulty in treating
psoriasis is that most of the
treatments are potentially
carcinogenic. Dr. Philip
Hanawalt, a professor of
biology here, has found a way to
reduce the cancer risk involved
in PUVA therapy (in PUVA
therapy the patient takes the
drug Psoralin, which is then ir
radiated by ultraviolet radi
ation).
By studying the PUVA proc
ess at the dinuculose nucleic
acid (DNA) level, he was able to
figure out what exactly the
Psoralin was doing and devise a

better method of administering
PUVA treatment. When, during
irradiation, the Psoralin initial
ly links to the DNA strand the
result is potentially dangerous.
Further irradiation turns this
linkage into the type useful in
treating psoriasis.
To better ensure that linkages
of the first type are turned into
linkages of the second type,
Hanawalt developed the split
dose methodology. The process
involves giving the patient an in
itial dose of PUVA, waiting six
hours for any unlinked psoralin
to be flushed from the body,
then administering a second
dose of radiation to alter all the
initial linkages.
More practical
Dr. Hans Shaefer, director of
the Centre International de Re
ceherches Dermatologiques in

France, found a way to make an
thralin, a common treatment,
more feasible for patients. In
the past patients have had to go
to a day care center where an
anthralin solution is applied to
the skin for 12 hours.
Schaefer found that, using a
slightly higher concentration of
anthralin, the same results
could be had in as little time as
10 minutes to one hour Hence,
patients can easily administer
the treatment to themselves, at
home, on a daily basis.
Foundation dedicated
One of the highlights of the
week was the formal dedication
of the International Psoriasis
Research Foundation, a non
profit research center in Palo
Alto.
