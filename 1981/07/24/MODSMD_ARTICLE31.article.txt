[ The Last Picture Show****
j Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
j This is Peter Bogdanovich's
I second movie (the first was
: Targets, a shoestring thriller he'd
j directed for Roger Corman) and
| by far his best. The knowledge of
| movie lore that would cause the di
rector's later movies — from Pa
j per Moon to Nickleodeon — to
j looked bloated and lifeless is en
i tirely in control here.
The Last Picture Show is an
I elegy for an age that's been lost.
Part of its sadness lies in the re
alization that there is no Way that
life can compete with the world
that the movies can give us. The
movie's setting, a small Texas
town in the late '50s t can't compete
with the mythic Texas the charac
ters see in the town's rundown
moviehouse. The characters are
the shadows of the myth, and as It
fades, so do they.
The cast is virtually perfect. It
includes Ben Johnson, Cloris
Leachman. Beau Bridges,
Timothy Bottoms, and Cybil
Shepherd.

The Philadelphia Story****
Fox. Redwood City
This is one of those films that
give headaches to people who try
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play — no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added. Yet,
by almost any definition. it's an ex
ceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in bring
ing it to the screen. The director
was George Cukor, a gifted
craftsman capable of bring fine
performances out of virtually any
actor And the actors aren't just
anybody: the cast includes
Katharine Hepburn, nostrils flar
ing and indignation aflame; Cary
Grant, comic sense perfectly
tuned; and James Stewart, who
drunkenly sings "Over the Rain
bow" as if he'd stake his reputa
tion on it.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Frank Capra's You Can't Take It
With You

Superman //★★*
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the original;
it will usually delight those who
found the original's smart-alecky
second half more appealing. Rich
ard Lester (A Hard Day's Night,
7 hr rhree Musketeers) directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
book punch that moves it along as
speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
peats his role as the man of steel;
Margot Kidder is, once again, a
sassy, sexy Lois Lane.

The Blues Brothers Movie*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Admittedly, there's something
innately satisfying about seeing a
shopping center destroyed, store
by store. But when director John
Landis (Animal House) attempts
to extend this aesthetic of destruc
tion over two hours, the whole ex
ercise becomes innately boring.
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are
the ostensible stars, but they're
hidden behind dark glasses and im
penetrable gags, and we never get
any feeling for who they're sup
posed to be. What we know about
their characters is what we find
out second-hand from the calamity
that's taking place all around
them. Human beings are negative
spaces in this movie — they're
something to explode buildings
around, and crash cars on top of.
It's hard not to be a little sickened
at the thought of the film's |32 mil
lion budget; it's a figure high
enough to make even slapstick
seem tragic.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Cheech & Chong's Next Mov
ie.

Raiders of the Lost /trfc *
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 183#) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts of
some of the most gifted craftsmen

in Hollywood: Steven Spielberg
(Jaws) directed; George Lucas
<Star Wars) and Philip Kaufman
(Invasion of the Body Snatchers)
wrote the script. It has been ac
claimed by the overwhelming ma
jority of critics as a cliff-hanger
classic. But I must confess to a
traitorous resistance to all those
good vibrations: I didn't care for
the movie very much. Raiders
achieves a weird balance: it's ex
citing on the surface but dull at its
center. For all the hype about its
adolescent boys' tale spirit, I could
discern none of it. Raiders was
made in acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.
— Steve Vine berg
For Your Eyes Only**
Palo Alto Square
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal. It's
not as bloated as the last Bond ex
travaganza (Moonraker) and it's
perhaps the least sadistic of any
Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to be
growing tired of the role (or per
haps he's merely stopped trying:
the producers plan to replace him
with a younger model soon). He
perks up momentarily — as does
the movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with

the Bond formula through the rest
of the film, For Your Eyes Only
might have passed for entertain
ment instead of an exercise in
cinematic stasis.

Fox, Redwood City
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable to
render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot to
do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's lovely
"epic" photography isn't enough)
for seeing the movie rather than
staying home and rereading the
book.
Teas' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds. But
her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.
Plays tonight only.

112 E»cupe from !Seic York****
' Belmont Theater, Belmont
The year is 1997; Manhattan Is
land has been walled off to form a
maximum security prison. Once a
person is sent in, there is no way
out — those who don't like the idea
of living out their lives in the pris
on may opt for execution and imm
mediate cremation on the pre
mises. Inside, the island has
turned into a nightmare world, in
habited above and below by
creatures out of bad dreams.
From the time the title credits
fade to the roll of the end credits,
Escape from New York offers vir
tually unrelenting excitement. Di
rector John Carpenter (who
directed Halloween, the first and
far and away the best of the cur
rent horror movie cycle) takes his
lightweight plot and fills it to the
bursting point with striking im
ages ami setpieces of suspense.

Windwalker **M
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wind walker is set in 1797 and
most of the actors speak in Native
American languages; its theme is
the glorification of strong, individ*
ualistic men. The Windwalker
(Trevor Howard) is an aged
Cheyenne who uses guile and
nerve to survive countless hard
ships as he guides his family south
to meet the rest of the tribe. The
film is less an action-packed ad
venture story than an evocation of
mythological certainties. It is at
times portentous, gory, and sexist.
Still, with Clint Eastwood out
making chimpanzee movies, di
rector Kieth Merril may be the
most able exponent of the conser
vative-libertarian ethos now work
ing in American film.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Three Warriors.
— Vince Waldman
The Shining*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of
the Stephen King novel supplies
neither the promised shocks
(about the best he can muster is a
|l cackling corpse in a bathtub) nor
hinted*at depths in character
ization Jack Nicholson gleefully
overplays his role as mad
man/father to telepathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife
wielding hysteria by it all is moth
er Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most interesting per
formance — she has a capacity for
expressing emotional aridness
that a better movie might have
used to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability todevote
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular.
Starts next Thursday with Al
tered State*. i
