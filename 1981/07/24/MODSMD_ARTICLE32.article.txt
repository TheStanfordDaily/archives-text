Joe Walsh stepped out of his
Eagles straitjacket for a couple
of hours Sunday night at the
Oakland Coliseum. The result
was a classy display of talent
and a very entertaining per
formance.
Seeing Walsh without think
ing about the Eagles is difficult.
"Why did he do it?" moan aging
fans of the James Gang. Those
who treasure Walsh's solo
albums search in vain around
the label of The Long Run for a
personal message scratched in
the vinyl.
The Walsh on stage in Oak
land was clearly not the same
Walsh who hooked up with "The
Band of the Seventies" five

Road" and wail loud songs like
"In the City" and "Turn to
Stone" effectively.
The center of attention, how
ever, was Walsh's guitar. Each
solo had its moments. In the
middle of "Funk 49," for in
stance, Walsh broke into
Ravel's "Bolero." Even the fa
miliar slide solo in "Rocky
Mountain Way" had some new
licks. To top it off, Walsh added
his own touches to the final en
core, a nice, tight cover of the
Beatles' "Get Back."
Joe Walsh is always enter
taining. On stage, he made sure
everyone had a good time. On
"Life's Been Good," practically
the whole house joined in.
