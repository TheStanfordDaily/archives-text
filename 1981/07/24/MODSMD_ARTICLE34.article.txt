## ‘China' quiets gastric rumblings 
### Frank Hicks 
If you suddenly crave a
bellyful of good, reasonably
priced Chinese food, and have
grown weary of the restaurants
within the immediate vicinity, a
15-minute jaunt southbound on
scenic El Camino is all it takes
to simultaneously broaden your
horizons and quieten those
gastric rumblings. Grand Chi
na, located at 5100 El Camino
Real, offers a fine selection of
Mandarin, Hunan, and Szechuan
cuisine well worth the few extra
minutes in the car.
The building itself is rather
deceptive. What appears from
the road to be an average-sized
restaurant is actually large
and spacious. It comfortably
seats more than 200 people and,
in addition to the main dining
room, offers a banquet hall and
smaller room for private
parties. The decor is simple and
attractive. A few lanterns and
paintings adorn the walls and
high, sloped ceiling.
The lighting is pleasantly sub
dued and soft music plays in the
background. Tunes like
"Spanish Eyes" and "Oh What a
Beautiful Morning" are played
so quietly and are so insipid that
they are harmless.
After a couple of glasses of
Tsingtao (a Chinese beer), we
toyed with the concept of cold
appetizers. The jellyfish with
cucumber looked awfully good,

as did the bonbon chicken, but
instead, we finally opted for the
Grand China Exotic — an as
sortment of most of the hot ap
petizers the restaurant pre
pares; the most expensive is $5.
The service was virtually in
stantaneous. The dish arrived
on an elegantly decorated lazy
susan with a small, flaming
barbecue pit on top. The selec
tion included spring rolls,
barbecued spareribs, shrimp
toast, fried wanton, and silver
wrapped chicken, all of which
were very good, especially the
juicy chicken, delicately spiced
with ginger. The piece de re
sistance, however, was the
fillets of skewered teriyaki beef
which come garnished with
pineapple and cherry. The idea
is to barbecue these yourself
over the flaming pit.
Having disposed of the ap
petizers we focused our atten
tion upon something a little
more substantial. While the
selection of main dishes is not
the most extensive I've seen of
fered in Chinese restaurants, it
is quite varied and caters to all
tastes. The average cost of a
main dish is $5; however, prices
do range as high as $9.25 for a
whole fish, and $18.00 for Peking
duck. I chose the sizzling beef
with scallops at $7.25 and my
companion decided to try the
Tsao Liu chicken ($4.95). Both
are house specialties. These

dishes were accompanied by a
large bowl of steaming rice and
a few more Tsingtaos, although
a number of good wines are
available for those so inclined.
I was going to order an addi
tional vegetable dish; however,
Mary, our waitress, assured us
that we already had more than
enough to cope with. She was
right. Tsao Liu chicken is a
traditional Mandarin dish,
made of chicken breasts
sauteed with snow pea pods, wa
ter chestnuts and tree
mushrooms, all of which are
flavored with a special wine
sauce. Although cooked to per
fection, and very enjoyable, the
chicken was completely over
shadowed by the sizzling beef
with scallops which was out of
this world.
The course consisted of suc
culent pieces of beef and
scallops sauteed in a deliciously
rich, black mushroom sauce to
gether with broccoli, scallions
and long, stringy, black things,
the name of which I have no
hope of pronouncing, let alone
spelling. Apparantly they are a
fungus — the Chinese equivalent
of a truffle — bu whatever they
are they taste great and give an
interesting twist to the dish.
Having finished as much as
we could, we belched politely,
stood up, and waddled slowly
out the door, doggie bags
clasped firmly to our chests.

Mary, our waitress, assured us
that we already had more than
enough to cope with. She was
right. Tsao Liu chicken is a
traditional Mandarin dish,
made of chicken breasts
sauteed with snow pea pods, wa
ter chestnuts and tree
mushrooms, all of which are
flavored with a special wine
sauce. Although cooked to per
fection, and very enjoyable, the
chicken was completely over
shadowed by the sizzling beef
with scallops which was out of
this world.
The course consisted of suc
culent pieces of beef and
scallops sauteed in a deliciously
rich, black mushroom sauce to
gether with broccoli, scallions
and long, stringy, black things,
the name of which I have no
hope of pronouncing, let alone
spelling. Apparantly they are a
fungus — the Chinese equivalent
of a truffle — bu whatever they
are they taste great and give an
interesting twist to the dish.
Having finished as much as
we could, we belched politely,
stood up, and waddled slowly
out the door, doggie bags
clasped firmly to our chests.
