# ‘Ecco Ristorante' better than its name indicates
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
The most off-putting part of
Ecco Ristorante is its name. For
going on a year now, I have as
siduously avoided the restau
rant, whose name conjured up
for me images of third-rate
cafeterias, and whose unap
petizing signs on El Camino
Real did nothing to dispel these
thoughts. I was very surprised,
after my natural prejudices, to
find a restaurant whose open,
airy design and melange of cas
ual and discreet decor framed a
most enjoyable repast.
I must admit, though it's a
cardinal sin for a restaurant
critic, to have had a slightly
negative predisposition on en
tering the restaurant. When, in
stead of run-of-the-mill French
or sourdough bread, hot oregano
and parmesan bread appeared, I
had the feeling that I might be
pleasantly proven wrong. I
knew for certain that this was
the case when my plate of
Carpaccio ($4.25), paper thin
slices of raw steak with mustard
sauce and parmesan, arrived on
its iced plate.
The presentation was magnif
icent, with a seemingly im
possibly thin layer of raw steak
covering a rather large plate;
between the beef and icy plate, a
tangy mustard sauce; on top a
heap of freshly grated
parmesan and a few twists of

black pepper. Even my friend
who prefers her meat cooked
until only barely distinguishable
traces of pink remain, kept in
vading my plate for piece after
piece.. .
This is not to say that her
Minestrone ($1.75) was not wor
thy of her attention; she enjoyed
it very much, finding the flavor
spicy and excellent, and only
wishing it were more "chock
full of things" than it actually
was.
I had already decided to be
piggish and order a salad, for
how can one resist the hard sell
of the menu: " We only offer one
salad. But Wow. . .What a
salad!" I was almost disap
pointed that my greed had been
taken care of — the salad is aur
tomatically included with the
entree.
The salad was quite a produc
tion — a salad bar on wheels,
whose ingredients: Romaine
and iceberg lettuce, carrots, red
cabbage, radishes, broccoli,
cauliflower, red and green pep
pers, mozzarella, prosciutto,
and croutons, are all (if one so
desires) dexterously whisked
together and tossed, with theat
rical exaggeration, by the
waiter.
Still, this act does produce a
very satisfying result. The final

product is a texturally well-bal
anced salad, whose portion is by
no means diminutive. The iced
forks added a nice touch.
By this time my stomach was
well exercised and eagerly
awaiting further offerings, es
pecially the Duckling di Tullio
($11.95), duck flavored with
honey, anise, rosemary and fen
nel seed, over which our waiter
had almost gone into a rapture
when I had asked about its mer
it. The sauce, he had assured
me, was "pure ambrosia," a
slight overstatement, but in
character with his enthusiasm.
Nonetheless, the duck was
very good , super-crisp, as I had
ordered, voluminous, and the
sauce, although a tad on the
sweet side, was quite palatable.
My associate's Veal Marsala
($12.95), thinly sliced veal
sauteed in oil and finished with
marsala wine, was also tasty.
Again the portion was generous,
and I had my chance for revenge
from the hors d'oeuvres, and
plunged my fork repeatedly into
her plate. Accompanying vege
tables, resembling a
Ratatouille were excellent, well
seasoned and not overcooked.
To prove my gluttony (and
my companion's as well) we or
dered a side dish of Fettuccini

Alfredo ($1.95), pasta covered
with heavy cream and
parmesan. It would have
seemed almost criminal to have
avoided pastas totally in a res
taurant specializing in them. A
selection of 10 different pasta
dishes are included on the
menu; all are created freshly in
the restaurant and many are
displayed at the pasta bar near
the entrance.
Our Fettucini Alfredo had en
couraging elements; the pasta
was light, reminiscent of the
fare at the wonderful mama and
papa restaurants of Milan and
Bologna. The sauce, however,
did not complement, it over
whelmed. The flavor was good,
heavily scented with parmesan,
but the cream not only made the
sauce rich, but heavy as well.
Still, I love pasta, and its good to
know that there is at least one
restaurant in the area able to
create an excellent base prod
uct.
At this point, a quick eval
uation rated the restaurant
pretty highly overall; I was
ready to order my espresso and
call it an evening when our
waiter, effervescent as always,
convinced us of the magnif
icence of the desserts. He chose
two for us, Mama Mia's Apple
Danza ($1.95), a deep dish apple
pie with ice cream and rum

raisin sauce, and Canneloni
($2.25), pastry shells filled with
sweetened cheeses, vanilla, cin
namon and cream.
The apple pie was unexciting,
rather reminiscent of Univer
sity Food Service, and the Can
noli couldn't even achieve that
standard. The crust was heavy,
the filling tasteless, and the
lumps of tutti-frutti an unex
pected and unpleasant surprise.
I wish that I had followed my in
testinal instincts and skipped
desserts.
Still I won't hold desserts too
much against Ecco; there is
enough good food preceding this
stage, and one could always fin
ish with Italian ices or fresh
fruit which I am sure would be
very good.
Service, as I mentioned, was
very enthusiastic and quite pro
fessional. The wine list offered a
wide selection of California
wines enough to suit any palate
or budget (it is the same list as
the one at Hugo's Market Res
taurant, and is a credit to the
Hyatt food and beverage man
ager).
The atmosphere was very
comfortable, the food for the
most part good, the prices not
out of line and the service
friendly. Ecco is definitely a
welcome addition to the area's
Italian restaurants.
