Israelis launch sea assault
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli troops landed from
the sea late last night near Damour and staged a
three-hour assault, after a day of Israeli air raids
in southern Lebanon and retaliatory rocket bar
rages, the Palestinian guerrilla command and
Lebanon state radio reported.
Communiques issued by the Palestinian com
mand said guerrillas repulsed the attack at the
Mediterranean town of Jiyeh, 12 miles south of
Beirut, with heavy artillery and rocket fire. The
Palestinian news agency WAFA said few Israeli
soldiers managed to reach shore and that the at
tack ended around 2:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. EDT yes
terday).
The communique said two destroyers, a sub
marine, eight gunboats and helicopters were in
volved in the landing.
WAFA said three civilians were killed when the
car they were riding in on the Damour highway
was hit by Israeli gunfire. Israeli casualties were
unknown, the news agency said.
The Palestinians said the Israelis landed at
11:45 p.m., a little more than an hour before the 8
p.m. EDT deadline set by the United Nations Se
curity Council for ending the Palestinian-Israeli
hostilites in southern Lebanon. At United Nations
headquarters in New York, Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim told the council last night that the
cease-fire had not come about.
Drilling bill rebukes Watt
Washington — The House passed an $11.2 billion
appropriation bill for the Interior Department
Wednesday that includes several rebukes to
James Watt, the Interior Secietary whose pro-de
velopment moves have caused controversy.
One of the rebuffs to Watt was a provision bar
ring him from using money in the bill to lease off
shore oil drilling rights to four areas off the
Northern California coast. The proposal to open
the areas for drilling generated heavy criticism in
California.
The bill, approved 358-46 by the Democratic
controlled House, provides money for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
It now goes to the Republican-controlled Sen
ate, where Watt's policies generally are looked
upon with more favor.
The bill also rejects Watt's attempt to use $105
million in federal land acquisition money for na
tional park improvements, although the park
money is provided from other sources.
It includes $155.6 million for land purchases, in
cluding $87.8 million for the national parks. Watt
has insisted the government should concentrate
on managing the land it has now, not buying more,
and proposed a moratorium on land purchases.
Minimum Social Security cut
Washington — House and Senate conferees
agreed yesterday to end payment of the minimum
Social Security benefit next March, even as a
House Ways and Means subcommittee was laying

plans for legislation to keep the controversial ben
efit for the 3 million people who currently receive
it.
Action on the minimum benefit, which reflects
votes taken earlier by both houses to kill it, came
as more than 250 conferees on nearly $40 billion
worth of spending cuts for next year struggled to
meet today's target date for completing their
work.
The minimum benefit of $122 a month, or more
in some cases, goes to people who did not con
tribute enough to Social Security during their ca
reers to add up to that much in monthly benefits.
Demo tax proposal dumped
Washington — Democratic senators took their
best shots at President Ronald Reagan's three
year tax-cut bill and were crushed yesterday —
the Republican-controlled Senate refused to ap
prove extra tax relief for lower- and middle-in
come families.
A 57-42 vote rejected an amendment by Sen. Bill
Bradley (D-N.J.) that would have given Reagan
the three-year tax cut he wants but also would
have shifted a share of the benefits from those
making more than $50,000 a year to those earning
less.
Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Dale
Bumpers (D-Ark.) offered a similar plan to shift
the benefits, with Kennedy calling Reagan's bill
"a bonanza for the wealthiest people in this coun
try and peanuts for the working people." The pro
posal lost, 76-22.
Awaiting Senate consideration was an amend
ment by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo ). He proposed
that instead of cutting tax rates as asked by Rea
gan, the Senate simply vote to adjust taxes each
year, starting next Jan. 1, to offset automatically
the tax "bracket creep'' caused by inflation. That
also would concentrate more relief on those earn
ing under $50,000 a year.
The Senate already has voted to "index" the tax
laws to offset inflation, but starting in 1985.
Merger targets lead market
New York — Takeover targets provided some
of the best gains as the stock market halted a
three-day slide with a mixed showing yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
34.24 points in the past three trading days, re
bounded 3.90 to 928.56.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except for low clouds
and fog along the coast spreading inland nights
and mornings. Lows in the 50s. Highs from the up
per 50s near the ocean to the 70s inland. Westerly
winds 15 to 35 mph afternoons and evenings.

the sea late last night near Damour and staged a
three-hour assault, after a day of Israeli air raids
in southern Lebanon and retaliatory rocket bar
rages, the Palestinian guerrilla command and
Lebanon state radio reported.
Communiques issued by the Palestinian com
mand said guerrillas repulsed the attack at the
Mediterranean town of Jiyeh, 12 miles south of
Beirut, with heavy artillery and rocket fire. The
Palestinian news agency WAFA said few Israeli
soldiers managed to reach shore and that the at
tack ended around 2:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. EDT yes
terday).
The communique said two destroyers, a sub
marine, eight gunboats and helicopters were in
volved in the landing.
WAFA said three civilians were killed when the
car they were riding in on the Damour highway
was hit by Israeli gunfire. Israeli casualties were
unknown, the news agency said.
The Palestinians said the Israelis landed at
11:45 p.m., a little more than an hour before the 8
p.m. EDT deadline set by the United Nations Se
curity Council for ending the Palestinian-Israeli
hostilites in southern Lebanon. At United Nations
headquarters in New York, Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim told the council last night that the
cease-fire had not come about.
Drilling bill rebukes Watt
Washington — The House passed an $11.2 billion
appropriation bill for the Interior Department
Wednesday that includes several rebukes to
James Watt, the Interior Secietary whose pro-de
velopment moves have caused controversy.
One of the rebuffs to Watt was a provision bar
ring him from using money in the bill to lease off
shore oil drilling rights to four areas off the
Northern California coast. The proposal to open
the areas for drilling generated heavy criticism in
California.
The bill, approved 358-46 by the Democratic
controlled House, provides money for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
It now goes to the Republican-controlled Sen
ate, where Watt's policies generally are looked
upon with more favor.
The bill also rejects Watt's attempt to use $105
million in federal land acquisition money for na
tional park improvements, although the park
money is provided from other sources.
It includes $155.6 million for land purchases, in
cluding $87.8 million for the national parks. Watt
has insisted the government should concentrate
on managing the land it has now, not buying more,
and proposed a moratorium on land purchases.
Minimum Social Security cut
Washington — House and Senate conferees
agreed yesterday to end payment of the minimum
Social Security benefit next March, even as a
House Ways and Means subcommittee was laying

plans for legislation to keep the controversial ben
efit for the 3 million people who currently receive
it.
Action on the minimum benefit, which reflects
votes taken earlier by both houses to kill it, came
as more than 250 conferees on nearly $40 billion
worth of spending cuts for next year struggled to
meet today's target date for completing their
work.
The minimum benefit of $122 a month, or more
in some cases, goes to people who did not con
tribute enough to Social Security during their ca
reers to add up to that much in monthly benefits.
Demo tax proposal dumped
Washington — Democratic senators took their
best shots at President Ronald Reagan's three
year tax-cut bill and were crushed yesterday —
the Republican-controlled Senate refused to ap
prove extra tax relief for lower- and middle-in
come families.
A 57-42 vote rejected an amendment by Sen. Bill
Bradley (D-N.J.) that would have given Reagan
the three-year tax cut he wants but also would
have shifted a share of the benefits from those
making more than $50,000 a year to those earning
less.
Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Dale
Bumpers (D-Ark.) offered a similar plan to shift
the benefits, with Kennedy calling Reagan's bill
"a bonanza for the wealthiest people in this coun
try and peanuts for the working people." The pro
posal lost, 76-22.
Awaiting Senate consideration was an amend
ment by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo ). He proposed
that instead of cutting tax rates as asked by Rea
gan, the Senate simply vote to adjust taxes each
year, starting next Jan. 1, to offset automatically
the tax "bracket creep'' caused by inflation. That
also would concentrate more relief on those earn
ing under $50,000 a year.
The Senate already has voted to "index" the tax
laws to offset inflation, but starting in 1985.
Merger targets lead market
New York — Takeover targets provided some
of the best gains as the stock market halted a
three-day slide with a mixed showing yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
34.24 points in the past three trading days, re
bounded 3.90 to 928.56.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except for low clouds
and fog along the coast spreading inland nights
and mornings. Lows in the 50s. Highs from the up
per 50s near the ocean to the 70s inland. Westerly
winds 15 to 35 mph afternoons and evenings.
