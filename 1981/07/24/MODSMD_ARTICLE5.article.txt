# Accidently sprayed Malathion threatens Jasper Ridge studies
## 
### Cici Oremland 
In the state's fight to
eradicate spread of the destruc
tive Mediterranean fruit fly,
about 120 acres of the Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve was
inadvertently sprayed by a
malathion-laden helicopter last
Monday on its spraying round of
Portola Valley.

The 1200 acre preserve, the
only teaching/research pre
serve owned by a university in
the country, contains no prima
ry host trees for the Medfly and
had been exempted from
spraying of malathion by state
Medfly officials.
University biologists feel
fairly certain that little damage
was done this time, but that con
tinued spraying could be
detrimental to research
projects there.
David Hollinger, a graduate
student in biology who saw the
actual spraying, said, "If it
(spraying) continues acciden
tally or on purpose, there could
be really disasterous effects (on
research studies)."
Administrative Director of
Jasper Ridge Alan Grundmann
has been working closely with
state Medfly officials to ensure
that Jasper Ridge will not be
sprayed again.
"We are literally at this mo
ment working on creating a buf
fer zone," he said.
A state public relations of
ficial, Bill Pope, said that nego
tiations with the University are
going smoothly and spraying in
Portola Valley will not continue
until steps are completed to
ensure that the ridge will not
suffer a repeat spraying.
The helicopter set to spray
areas of Portola Valley last
Monday was to use the pre
serve's southern boundary
fence as a guideline to the end of
the spraying zone. The heli
copter was to fly parallel to the
fence.
But Medfly Project Director
Jerry Scribner said that be

cause of fog conditions, the heli
copter was forced to fly per
pendicular to the fence rather
than the proposed paralleHlight
plan.
Due to the speed of the heli
copter and the time needed to
turn itself around, each of its
sweeps included some spraying
in the preserve.
Hollinger, who is doing stud
ies with oak moths on the ridge,
said he watched "horrified" as
the helicopter dropped
malathion into the preserve in
the area over his studies.
"The helicopter was flying so
fast that (even) in five seconds
it was 600 feet inside the fence,"
he said.
Before the spraying, the
biology department had decided
to monitor malathion spraying
inside the preserve by placing
white cardboard pieces at vary
ing distances along the fence.
Hollinger said he found evi
dences of malathion droplets 600
feet into the preserve, but in no
consistent pattern.
He said he will return next
Tuesday to check special traps
under the oak trees that meas
ure caterpiller droppings. And,
he will check again in a few
weeks to look for any signs in
changes in the caterpillar popu
lation.
Other insects who are nectar
hunters, such as th* Medfly, will
be more seriously affected. But
there may be secondary effects
on the butterflies as well.
Grundmann said, "Most peo
ple planning this (eradication
program) are biologists them
selves and are interested in
what (studies) we're doing."
