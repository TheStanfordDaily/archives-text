# Non registers may be prosecuted
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington â€” The Justice Department is
looking into 134 cases of young men who al
legedly have failed to register for the draft, but
any further prosecutions are temporarily on
hold, a Selective Service official said today.
Department officials said the names of the
young men under scrutiny are being relayed to
U.S. attorneys around the country for in
vestigation and possible prosecution.
The Selective Service System Deputy Direc
tor Brayton Harris, said the agency will not in
itiate any major enforcement action, however,
until Congress decides whether to allow the So
cial Security System to cooperate with Selec
tive Service in searching out the names of un
registered young men.
He said the names of the 134 young men who
allegedly failed to register were sent to the
Justice Department after citizen complaints
were received about alleged non-registration
by men born in 1960 through 1963.
A spokesman for a coalition of 66 national
and local anti-draft groups said protests are

planned at federal buildings around the coun
try "as soon as the first arrests take place."
David Cortright of the Committee Against
Registration and the Draft said that despite
Harris' statement "we believe it is only a mat
ter of time until prosecution begins."
Jim Klimaski, a former infantry officer,
said the National Lawyers Guild will offer le
gal representation to men who are prosecuted
for failing to register. The government, he
said, "is once again preparing to make crimi
nals out of young men who refuse to cooperate
with the war machine by registering for the
draft."
And Rusty Martin, of Cedar Falls, lowa,
president of the Northern lowa Student As
sociation, said that each time there is a move
toward registration, officials claim "it is not a
draft." But, he added, "Every step takes us
closer and closer." Martin said he burned his
draft card last year and that he is one of the 134
who have received Justice Department letters
warning of possible prosecution.
