## Argentina: general strike fails 
### Los Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires â€” Argentina's
major Peronist labor union
failed in its call for a nationwide
general strike Wednesday to
protest the policies of the coun
try's five-and-one-half-year-old
military regime.
According to both govern
ment and independent sources,
only about 20 percent of Argen
tina's estimated 4 million work
ers observed the"Day of Pro
test" called by the General Con
federation of Workers.
Except in the port town of
Bahia Blanca, where officials
said that the effect of the strike
had been to shut down the city,
there was no serious disruption
of life or much inconvenience
from the strike.
From the outset, the Peronist
union had intended to use the
one day work stoppage primari
ly as a political statement.
But the poor response and
lack of support from other
unions and unaffiliated workers
resulted in a political gesture no
more meaningful than the strike
itself.
If anything, the strike only
seemed to shore up the govern
ment of Gen. Roberto Viola,
who is presiding over one of Ar
gentina's worst economic and
political crisis since the March
1976 overthrow of the regime of
Isabel Peron, widow of the late
dictator Juan Peron.
The Peronist labor leaders
had decided that the failing
economy with its 150 percent in
flation, climbing unemploy
ment and collapsing industrial
base presented them with a
choice opportunity.
They also gambled that ap
parent confusion and fragmen
tation among the country's mili
tary rulers reduced the chances
of both organized and forceful
reaction by the government.
Diplomatic observers and Ar

gentine labor experts, however,
said that the calculations were
badly misdrawn. "They tried to
mount a warhorse and fell on
their butts," one diplomat said.
The union also failed to
marshal any support from Ar
gentina's other major labor
group, the anti-Peronist Na
tional Commission of Workers.
This was underlined by the
fact that even in areas where
stores were forced to close or in
dustries and services were shut
down, workers who are not
members of the Peronist union
reported to their jobs.
One Argentine labor expert
said that "for all intents and
purposes, only (the Peronist
workers) struck and there sim
ply aren't enough to make a se
rious impact."
The strike leaders also erred
in thinking that the government
could not respond effectively. In
the days before the strike, near
ly every major leader of the
Peronist union had to go into
hiding to avoid arrest, and sev
eral did not make it.
As of late Wednesday after
noon, at least 10 of the union's
officials had been arrested and
the families of several others
said that they were being
harassed by government
agents.
Also, a large and very visible
police presence in Buenos Aires
and other major cities pre
vented any public demonstra
tions.
But it was more than the fear
of repression that kept the
strike on its knees, sources said.
Any chance of a succesful strike
ended, these sources said, when
the Peronists postponed the pro
test from three weeks ago.
At that point, the government
was in deep trouble with reports
circulating that Viola would
either quit or be forced out, that
the ruling junta was torn by in

ternal rivalry and that the econ
omy was in chaos.
Further, most of the leaders
of the major rival unions were
attending an international con
ference in Europe.
If the Peronists had acted
then, one diplomat said,
"neither the government nor
the other unions would have had
the time to organize any opposi
tion."
"But by putting it off to to
day," he continues, "the Per
onists lost momentum and their
opponents had time to organize
against the strike."
Other analysts said that the
threat of a strike seemed to be a
unifying element in the govern
ment since a resurgence of Per
onist unionism is something that
nearly all elements in the mili
tary fear.
In that sense, they said, the
Peronists did the regime a favor
as a whole and Viola in particu
lar since he will be able to argue
that his firmness and direction
caused the strike to fail.
