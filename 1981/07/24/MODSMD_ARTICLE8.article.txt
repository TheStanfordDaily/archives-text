# India will buy grain to fill reserve stocks
## 
### Washington Post 
New Delhi, India — After four
years of self-sufficiency in food
grains, India has been forced
into the international market to
buy 1.5 million tons of wheat
from the United States to fill its
dwindling reserve stocks.
Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi said her government is
buying the wheat as an anti-in
flationary measure to fight the
market machinations of traders
and hoarders.
"I believe in stocking up,"
when things are inexpensive and
readily available," she ex
plained. "We don't find it neces
sary," she said later, "but we
find it expedient."
Storm of protest
The purchases aroused a
storm of protest in newspaper
editorials and from politicians,
especially since India has
boasted often of its newly won
ability to feed its 684 million
people with home-grown grain.
Moreover, India was able to get
through the 1979 drought, one of
the worst in the century,
without a famine or having to
purchase grain from abroad.
The Indian Express called the
wheat purchase "more shock
ing results of the government's
economic mismanagement."
"India's self-sufficiency in
food grains has been its most
shining achievement in the eyes
of the world. The incongruity of
our resorting to imports cannot
escape international atten
tion."
Even politicians of Gandhi's
Congress-I (for Indira) Party
complained the money should
have been spent on the Indian
farmers instead of in America.
Boycott demanded
Opposition leader A.B. Va
jpayee, the former foreign min
ister, demanded a national
boycott of the U.S. wheat, ex
claiming "The spineless Con
gress-I government is out with a
begging bowl in the United
States." He called the decision
to buy American wheat "a na
tional disgrace" and "a betray
al of the Indian farmer."
Nonetheless, it is clear here

that the Gandhi government got
a good deal for the U.S. wheat.
The purchases, at about an aver
age price of $172 a ton, were
made at a time when wheat
prices in America are de
pressed and before expected So
viet and Chinese purchases.
The total purchase price has
been reported here at about $260
million.
Record crop
The purchase comes amid es
timates of a record Indian
wheat crop of about 36 million
tons. Outside observers, how
ever, believe these reports are
unduly optimistic. U.S. satellite
photos, for instance, indicate a
crop of about 33.7 million tons.
Moreover, there are reports
that big farmers and traders are
hoarding wheat and refusing to
sell it to the government for re
serve stocks and cut-rate fair
price shops.
The government purchase
price of $162.50 a ton, about the
same as it will pay the United
States, is below the current
market price of $187.50 to $200 a
ton. In some states, sources
said, the price is as high as $250.
Real shortages
But Westerners who have
traveled through India's wheat
growing regions recently report
no signs of hoarding and say the
high market price indicates real
shortages.
The dwindling government
grain stocks came after a dis
astrous monsoon in 1979 that
forced India to dip into its re
serve stock to feed the country.
This was done, however,
without having to purchase
wheat abroad, which led Indian
officials and such intsmationnl
organization as the World Bank
to proclaim that Indian agricul
ture had escaped from the
vagaries of the weather and that
the country was now self-suffi
cient in food grains.
But a weak monsoon last year
brought a second lower-than-ex
pected wheat crop and another
call on India's reserve stock.
Before the 1979 drought, India
had more than 20 million tons of
food grains in reserve.
