# Hispanic leader criticizes policy on aliens
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington â€” The president
of the nation's largest Hispanic
citizens' group said last week
that a Reagan administration
proposal for legalizing the sta
tus of millions of undocumented
workers is "tantamount to es
tablishing serfdom."
Tony Bonilla, president of the
League of United Latin Ameri
can Citizens, said in an in
terview that the proposals the
administration plans to make
public today would benefit busi
nessmen and "put an onerous
burden" on the illegal aliens
purportedly being helped.
Bonilla said he has lobbied
against the proposals this week
on Capitol Hill and in a meeting

with Vice President George
Bush, but has been told the ad
ministration intends to send the
proposal to Congress as part of
its immigration law reform
package. Congress would have
to approve the plan.
According to administration
sources, the president agreed
last week to a Cabinet recom
mendation that would offer any
illegal alien who arrived in the
United States prior to Jan. 1,
1980, a chance to legalize his sta
tus by registering for a new
classification called "re
newable-term temporary resi
dent."
As outlined in a White House
memo obtained by The As
sociated Press, an alien with the

new status would be permitted
to live and work in the United
States for three years and the
permit would be renewable in
definitely.
After he had been in the new
classification for 10 years, an al
ien could apply for the present
"permanent resident alien"
classification, the same status
given to aliens who migrate le
gally to the United States.
To get permanent resident
status, the aliens coming from
the new classification would
have to demonstrate "minimal
English language capability."
Aliens in the new classi
fication would be required to
pay all taxes. But they would not
be eligible for unemployment
benefits, food stamps or welfare
aid. Nor would they be able to
bring spouses or children into
the country to join them, as per
manent resident aliens can.
Justice Department spokes
man Thomas DeCair defended
the proposal.
"Right now, they (illegal al
iens) are a fugitive class," he
said. "We think what we're
doing is to recognize the reality
and provide some legitimacy
for their presence here."
But Bonilla and other spokes
men for Hispanic interests dis
agreed. "What they're saying is
'Let's work them for 10 years

and then we'll see about adjust
ing their status,"' he said.
Rick Swartz, director of the
Alien Rights Project of the
Washington Lawyers' Commit
tee for Civil Rights Under Law,
said the idea of taxing aliens
without allowing them full bene
fits is "blatantly unconstitu
tional."
Swartz also criticized the pro
posal not to allow the aliens to
reunify their families. "It's
rather striking for an adminis
tration that claims to be pro
family to deny the benefits of
family to a class of black and
brown people."
He predicted that no more
than 10 percent of those eligible
for the proposed classification

would register unless Congress
substantially amended the
terms the administration has
devised.
No one is certain how many
people might be affected. The
White House memo says "up to
5 million" aliens could be
eligible for the new status, but
officials, speaking privately,
acknowledge that that figure is
only a guess.
Rep. Robert Garcia (D-N.Y.)
chairman of the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus, was critical of
the details of the administration
proposal, although he said any
legalization of the status of un
documented aliens would be "a
step in the right direction."
