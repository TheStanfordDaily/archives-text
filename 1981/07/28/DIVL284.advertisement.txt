Rename
i the Transition
and win
a meal for ten. j
The Transition, the main dining facil
ity in Tresidder Union, is about to
finish a major renovation of its
indoor eating area. And with the
imminent arrival of a new crepes
and quiche service, we are looking
to move beyond a long outdated
"Transitional" name and image.
Instead we want a name which will
convey the image of an attractive,
multi-service dining facility and
indoor/outdoor social center
TO ENTER: Send suggestions to
Marketing Coordina
tor, Tresidder Union —
or leave ideas in the
suggestion box at the
soon to be renamed
Transition." Be sure
to include your name
and phone number.
Good luck.
DEADLINE: July 3!
