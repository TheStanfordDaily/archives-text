# French Socialists begin decentralization
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — Ever since
Napoleon's time, 175 years ago,
France has been rigidly ruled by
the central government in Paris
— down to the last centime for
street repairs or painting the
school in the smallest provincial
village.

But this is about to change.
The new Socialist government,
in the most ambitious and far
reaching of its planned reforms,
has begun the first stage of a
two-year program of decen
tralization, a sweeping restruc
turing of the government to al
low cities, towns and regions to
run their own affairs without in
terference from Paris.
"We must get rid of what re
mains of the Napoleonic system
which still keeps Frenchmen on
apron strings," Prime Minister
Pierre Mauroy has said. "The
men of the chateaus are gone
now (a reference to defeated
President Valery Giscard

d'Estaing) and we must ac
complish together the historic
task, which will be first to
create a republic of citizens."
Legislation to implement the
first stage in the decentraliza
tion has been approved by the
cabinet and introduced in the
National Assembly for action
before the summer recess in Au
gust.
The bill is titled "Law on the
Rights and Liberties of the Com
munities, Departments and Re
gions." Its major effect will be
to strip away the powers of the
prefects, who are now respon
sible for all governmental func
tions in the 96 departments
(counties).
The prefectural system was
devised by Napoleon with the
dual purpose of unifying the na
tion against the "Jacobin ten
dency" to split into competing

regions and of imposing uniform
administrative control.
Napoleon also centralized the
educational system, from
elementary schools through uni
versities, and established the
Napoleonic Code as a uniform
system of justice.
Ever since, the prefects have
ruled the departments like
princes. In every department,
the prefect lives in a stately
mansion in the capital city, and
if a foreign ambassador visits
the department he always
makes a formal call on the pre
fect, in accordance with strict
protocol.
It has been the rule since
Napoleon's time that no man
can serve as a prefect of the de
partment in which he was born,
but this was breached recently
in Corsica, where President
Giscard d'Estaing appointed a

Corsican in an effort to cope
with rising terrorism and sepa
ratist sentiment.
Because some departments
are more desirable than others,
there is much competition
within the prefectural system.
For example, the prefect of the
Gronde department, who lives
in Bordeaux, has an unrivaled
wine cellar; the prefect of the
Alps-Maritime department
lives in luxury in Nice, on the
Riviera.
Prefects have two functions
— the administrative function
of supervising government ac
tivities and the political func
tion of preparing confidential
reports for Paris on local condi
tions.
In Paris, reports on possible
trouble areas, police sur
veillance activities and trends
in public opinion are digested at

the Ministry of the Interior and
a summary is prepared for the
president and his key cabinet
ministers. There has always
been a big-brother-is-watching
you atmosphere in France and
this is what is now to be stripped
away, at least in part.
The legal power df the pre
fects rests in what is known as
the right of tutelle or tutelage —
the power to veto without appeal
any decisions taken by the local
authorities in budget and ad
ministrative matters.
Every community has to sub
mit its budget and accounts to
the prefect each year. Every lo
cal regulation must have the
prefect's stamp of approval
before it can be put into force. In
some cases, the prefect must
submit local decisions to Paris
for approval — particularly
when he is in any doubt about his
own power of decision.
For example, Mayor Pierre
Pflimlin of Strasbourg adopted
a proposal by his local tourist
promotion board to purchase a
little train to take visitors on
sightseeing tours of the city's
old streets. But the request was ,
referred to Paris, which re
quired an exact plan of where
and when the train would run
before it would give its ap
proval.
In another case, Strasbourg
wanted to build a new school and
connect it with a central steam

plant for heating. But the Min
istry of Education in Paris ruled
that every French school had to
have its own central heating
system, thereby adding con
siderably to the cost of the
Strasbourg building.
When the first stage of decen
tralization is put into effect, the
prefects will not only cease to
have veto powers over local
budgets and administration —
parking regulations, road ex
tensions, municipal services
and the like.
Town councils will exercise
final authority over most of
their affairs.
