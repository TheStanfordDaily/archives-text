# Medical center to sponsor innovative clinic
## 
### Andres Fajardo 
In an institution like the Medi
cal Center, which is renowned
for its extensive and advanced
research and its academic ex
cellence, there is a danger that
basic patient care might end up
taking a back seat to medical in
vestigation and student instruc
tion.
But a new Med Center pro
gram proposed by the Stanford
Medical Group aims at

strengthening the Med Center's
commitment to basic patient
care.
Assistant Professor of Medi
cine Michael Jacobs and As
sociate Professor of Medicine
Armond Gelpi will be starting
on September 1 what Jacobs
called "a real break in tradition
for Stanford " — assigning two
members of the medical faculty
to have the primary duty of
seeing patients.

Jacobs described the practice
as being "something new ... in
the sense that we're going to
have two people on the faculty
level providing care to patients
and assuming responsibility for
the care of those patients 24
hours a day, seven days a
week."
The main target population
will be the University communi
ty. Patients will be taken "care
of in the hospital if they need to
be hospitalized, (and). . . out
side of the hospital if they are
outside of the hospital."
As a result, said Jacobs, there
will be "continuous care in a
private practice mode" with the
same type of services that a
private practitioner would pro
vide while staying "out of the
mainstream of teaching."
Gelpi portrayed the last three
decades as a period during
which "medical schools have
tended to restrict their ac
tivities to mostly teaching and
research with a shift of em
phasis away from patient care
... the program is trying to
bring this back on a small
scale."
This patient-doctor rela
tionship is very evident in the
contrasting processes of the
present Med Center and the new
group in regard to patient ad
mittance. "Many people who
come into Stanford are either
carried in because the are very
sick. . . and the need for medi
cal care is very urgent," said
Gelpi. "The other way (to enter
the hospital) is through the gen
eral medical clinic which is an
operation that emphasizes the
teaching as much as it does pa
tient care" in which the medical
students and house staff (doc
tors-in-training) are deeply in
volved in treating the patient
while the medical faculty super
vises.

The medical group, however,
will be different in that "The
first person the patient sees will
be a faculty person who will sort
of contract for long term care
. . . instead of being crisis-ori
ented . . . this will be a contrac
tual arrangement that in many
ways parallels a private prac
tice," Gelpi said. Students and
house-staff will still be in
corporated in the organization,
but in more of an 'onlooker'
role. Gelpi remarked, "We hope
that it will have the same effect

" We hope that it will have the same effect as
far as useful teaching is concerned but we
also hope that it's going to be a more
satisfying experience for the patient."

as far as useful teaching is con
cerned but we also hope that it's
going to be a more satisfying ex
perience for the patient."
Chairman of Medicine Ken
neth Melmon called the pro
gram "very innovative" and
said that it "will answer all the
criticisms about lack of long
term private patient care."
Melmon also thought that the
group will be able to smooth out
relations with clinicians while
using the new plan.
Jacobs remarked that "the
Medical Center is going to wel
come it a lot because there has
been ... a need expressed by
. . . non-Department of Medi
cine faculty wanting Depart
ment of Medicine people to take
care of their patients so they're
going to welcome that service. "
The genesis of the group, ac
cording to Jacobs, has grown
out of the constant, year after
year, request to the Department
of Medicine to provide ongoing
health care. Because of a lack of

interest on the part of the facul
ty, no such system was estab
lished previously. Now that the
two doctors have taken to the
idea and after two years in the
planning stage, the Stanford
Medical Group has become re
ality.
The group's own clinic will be
compiised of Gelpi, Jacobs,
nurse Marjorie Dunn and recep
tionist Sandy Hayashi. The med
ical staff that will assist the four
with after-hours coverage is
comprised of eight to 10 Depart

ment of Medicine members, in
cluding Melmon.
While Jacobs believes that
the group can become financial
ly independent in two years,
Gelpi said, "It's almost a
gamble. Obviously, the area
around Stanford is well supplied
with extremely competent phy
sicians. So in a sense, the Stan
ford Medical Group will offer
modest competition. Whether it
will be competitive . . . remains
to be seen. But I think the
challenge is there and the op
portunity is real and that's why
those of us who are starting the
operation are enthusiastic about
it."
The facilities for the project's
first year will be in the clinics of
the Med Center. After the
Boswell clinic building com
pletes its million-dollar renova
tion, the medical group hopes to
transfer to that site. Faculty
will be salaried by the Med Cen
ter.

nurse Marjorie Dunn and recep
tionist Sandy Hayashi. The med
ical staff that will assist the four
with after-hours coverage is
comprised of eight to 10 Depart

ment of Medicine members, in
cluding Melmon.
While Jacobs believes that
the group can become financial
ly independent in two years,
Gelpi said, "It's almost a
gamble. Obviously, the area
around Stanford is well supplied
with extremely competent phy
sicians. So in a sense, the Stan
ford Medical Group will offer
modest competition. Whether it
will be competitive . . . remains
to be seen. But I think the
challenge is there and the op
portunity is real and that's why
those of us who are starting the
operation are enthusiastic about
it."
The facilities for the project's
first year will be in the clinics of
the Med Center. After the
Boswell clinic building com
pletes its million-dollar renova
tion, the medical group hopes to
transfer to that site. Faculty
will be salaried by the Med Cen

In an institution like the Medi
cal Center, which is renowned
for its extensive and advanced
research and its academic ex
cellence, there is a danger that
basic patient care might end up
taking a back seat to medical in
vestigation and student instruc
tion.
But a new Med Center pro
gram proposed by the Stanford
Medical Group aims at

strengthening the Med Center's
commitment to basic patient
care.
Assistant Professor of Medi
cine Michael Jacobs and As
sociate Professor of Medicine
Armond Gelpi will be starting
on September 1 what Jacobs
called "a real break in tradition
for Stanford " — assigning two
members of the medical faculty
to have the primary duty of
seeing patients.

Jacobs described the practice
as being "something new ... in
the sense that we're going to
have two people on the faculty
level providing care to patients
and assuming responsibility for
the care of those patients 24
hours a day, seven days a
week."
The main target population
will be the University communi
ty. Patients will be taken "care
of in the hospital if they need to
be hospitalized, (and). . . out
side of the hospital if they are
outside of the hospital."
As a result, said Jacobs, there
will be "continuous care in a
private practice mode" with the
same type of services that a
private practitioner would pro
vide while staying "out of the
mainstream of teaching."
Gelpi portrayed the last three
decades as a period during
which "medical schools have
tended to restrict their ac
tivities to mostly teaching and
research with a shift of em
phasis away from patient care
... the program is trying to
bring this back on a small
scale."
This patient-doctor rela
tionship is very evident in the
contrasting processes of the
present Med Center and the new
group in regard to patient ad
mittance. "Many people who
come into Stanford are either
carried in because the are very
sick. . . and the need for medi
cal care is very urgent," said
Gelpi. "The other way (to enter
the hospital) is through the gen
eral medical clinic which is an
operation that emphasizes the
teaching as much as it does pa
tient care" in which the medical
students and house staff (doc
tors-in-training) are deeply in
volved in treating the patient
while the medical faculty super
vises.

The medical group, however,
will be different in that "The
first person the patient sees will
be a faculty person who will sort
of contract for long term care
. . . instead of being crisis-ori
ented . . . this will be a contrac
tual arrangement that in many
ways parallels a private prac
tice," Gelpi said. Students and
house-staff will still be in
corporated in the organization,
but in more of an 'onlooker'
role. Gelpi remarked, "We hope
that it will have the same effect

" We hope that it will have the same effect as
far as useful teaching is concerned but we
also hope that it's going to be a more
satisfying experience for the patient."

as far as useful teaching is con
cerned but we also hope that it's
going to be a more satisfying ex
perience for the patient."
Chairman of Medicine Ken
neth Melmon called the pro
gram "very innovative" and
said that it "will answer all the
criticisms about lack of long
term private patient care."
Melmon also thought that the
group will be able to smooth out
relations with clinicians while
using the new plan.
Jacobs remarked that "the
Medical Center is going to wel
come it a lot because there has
been ... a need expressed by
. . . non-Department of Medi
cine faculty wanting Depart
ment of Medicine people to take
care of their patients so they're
going to welcome that service. "
The genesis of the group, ac
cording to Jacobs, has grown
out of the constant, year after
year, request to the Department
of Medicine to provide ongoing
health care. Because of a lack of

interest on the part of the facul
ty, no such system was estab
lished previously. Now that the
two doctors have taken to the
idea and after two years in the
planning stage, the Stanford
Medical Group has become re
ality.
The group's own clinic will be
compiised of Gelpi, Jacobs,
nurse Marjorie Dunn and recep
tionist Sandy Hayashi. The med
ical staff that will assist the four
with after-hours coverage is
