# Joseph Walder: tresspass, theft in name of agriculture
## 
### 
The Medfly eradication effort
shows government at its worst:
trampling citizens' rights at the
behest of monied special in
terests. To add insult to injury,
we are paying for this abuse!
Under threat of imprison
ment. I have been forced to re
move from my garden, without
compensation, part of my per
sonal food supply. To further
coerce citizens, local govern
ments are sending out teams to
search private yards, and have
encourage people to report
neighbors who have not yet
stripped their fruit.
Well, maybe theft, trespass,
and undercover agents are all
right; after all, the federal gov
ernment has been utilizing such
methods for years!
Furthermore. I have been
subjected to a rain of potentially
hazardous material, as well as
the litany of supposed experts
denying all hazards. This ex
emplifies the most invidious
threat to our Republic: the non
questioning manner in which we
have ceded our prerogatives to
small groups of self-appointed
"protectors of the common
good."
In his book The I r nsettling of
America: Culture and Agricul
ture, Wendell Berry writes, "It
is not just possible, it is alto
gether to be expected, that our
society would produce . . . vice
presidents of pesticide corpo
rations whose children are
dying of cancer . . . The vi
ciousness of a mentality that
can look complacently upon dis
ease as part of the cost' would

be obvious to any child. But this
is the realism' of millions of
modern adults."
I suggest that this "realism"
will result in even more blatant
abrogation of citizens' rights
unless power is removed from
highly centralized governmen
tal and corporate bodies, and re
turned to the public.
