# Brad Armstrong: what's one more poison in the city?
## 
### 
A day in the life. Get up in the
morning and ingest a little cof
fee, a bunch of refined sugar and
just one or two low-tar/low-nic
otine cigarettes. Jump into your
suicide machine, cruise along
any of a number of carbon-what
ever infested avenues or free
ways while smoking just two or
three more cigarettes on the
way to work On the job. Two
cups, three bogeys and four
hours of staring into an eye-sor
ing and headache-provoking
cathode ray screen before
lunch. Over to a fast-food joint
for lunch — not just a little for
maldahyde in that stuff — com
plete with diet (i.e., embalm
ing) soda. Back to work through
the exhaust-filled streets. Out
of the heat and into the frigid
discomfort of air-conditioning.
Stare at the cathode tube some
more, only one more cup, but
five more cigarettes; what a
tough afternoon! Five o'clock.

Back on the freeway, headed
home to Medfly spray area,
Zone 6. A jog through the smog
belt blanketing the Woodside
(safe in the trees?) hills. Just a
couple of Gimlets before dinner,
a big,tenderized slab of sinewy
beef and, oh boy, a couple more
cigs. Sit down in front of the
tube with an after-dinner
primer. Click, on comes the set:
cathode flashbacks. What's a
drink without a cigarette? Ted
Koppel tells you (and you have
read everywhere) that
malathion is potentially danger
ous. Angry, nervous, in
credulous . . . you light another
cig, splash some more brandy in
a glass and yell to all within
earshot, "My God, I'll never
live to pension age if they spray
that stuff on me." True. But it
won't be all malthion's fault.
