# Robert Wesson: spray for 'agribusinessit feeds us all

### 
"Spraying with malathion
sacrifices the health of people to
agribusiness" — this cry is loud
ly and passionately raised by
many educated persons. It is a
dismal reflection of common at
titudes in our society.
It bespeaks an enormous dis
trust of technology. People are
not to be convinced by any
amount of expert testimony that
malathion is safe, although it
has been used for many years as
an agricultural and domestic in
secticide with no evidence of
harm to people, only bugs.
Spraying has been done suc
cessfully elsewhere, the concen
tration is minimal, and most
good citizens would be safely in
doors anyway during usual
spraying hours It is a weird pre
occupation for a society that
treats lightly the genuine and
massive dangers of cigarettes.
It is equally indicative of our
irrationality that agribusiness
is blamed. All production of food
for profit is "agribusiness," and
we certainly can have no more
right to ask farmers, large or
small, to operate without a prof
it than we ask people to work
without wages
It may be that agricultural
production is for one or another
reason too concentrated, but
this has nothing to do with the
spraying. Small farmers are as
much threatened by the Medfly
as big ones, perhaps more so.
And if agribusiness suffers, the
hardship is greater on the em
ployees and laborers than on the
owner.
Worst of all, those who blame
agribusiness forget about the
consumer. There won't be nec
tarines — and dozens of other
fruits and vegetables — unless
they can be economically
raised. One is reminded of the
woman who said she didn't care
what happened to the farmer be
cause there was always plenty
of food in the supermarket. If

the Medfly destroys half the
harvest, the price will probably
quadruple. But some people
would sacrifice the national diet
to their personal flutters of fear.
The readiness to damn
chemical eradication by crying
"agribusiness" is a testimony
to the anti-productive attitudes
that have seeped through the
American mind. People seem to
have forgotten that it is a good
thing to produce useful goods —
especially something so pleas
ant, wholesome, and healthy as
fruit. Producers serve buyers,
and if the producers make a
profit by so doing, let it be their
reward and the incentive for
them and others to produce
more.

The more we produce, the
better off we are and the more
resources we have to help the
needy as well as the affluent.
There often seems a feeling that
whatever is good for the large
scale producers is bad for the
people as a whole. This may be a
derivative of Marxism and the
idea of the class struggle.
Except in certain rather un
usual cases, such as venting pol
lutants or forming monopolies,
what helps business, big or
small, generally helps workers
and consumers as well.
The difference between rich
and poor countries is far less in
the resources that they possess
than in the greater freedom and
more effective guarantees for

production in the richer than in
the poorer.
Countries like Japan and
Switzerland, with practically no
natural riches, are rich by the
work of their people and the gen
eral esteem and encouragement
of production. Anything done to
hamper or impede production
makes all of us that much
poorer.
And unless the United States
can lay aside anti-productive at
titudes, it will certainly see
itself slipping even farther
down in the economic scale of
nations.
