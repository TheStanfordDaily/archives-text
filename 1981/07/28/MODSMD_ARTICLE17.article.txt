# Andres Fajardo: Everyone confused, noncooperative
## 
### 
One has to accept that the ov
erall success of the Mediter
ranean fruit fly project will be
measured by the eradication, or
the survival, of the Medfly.
However, despite the fact
that when planned carefully, the
Medfly project has run
smoothly (e.g., the current
aerial spraying), the push to rid
Santa Clara, San Mateo, and
Alameda counties on the na
tional and local levels has been
continuously plagued by three
nagging problems: non-cooper
ation, exaggeration and con
fusion.
Non-cooperation — This was
very evident last summer when
the Medfly project was in its
"larval" stage, when Medfly of
ficials had been granted time to
try a non-aerial spray attack on
the Medfly. After a call for a
massive public fruit stripping
and ground spraying effort, an
area called the "Mountain View
Gap (very close to Santa Clara,
the original core of the Medfly),
"was left with no spraying hav
ing been carried out in that zone
and very little fruit stripping."
In leaving this "gap" as such,
the officials failed to cooperate
with their own theory: Once
completely stripped and re
peatedly sprayed, the fly could
be eradicated without aerial
spraying. The current infesta
tion that began on June 26 com
menced in the infamous "Gap."
The most horrendous show of
unwillingness to collaborate on
the part of Bay Area residents
has been in the quarantine. Res
idents have lied, argued and ca
joled in order to take their pre
cious fruit with them and risk
the infestation of the San Joa

quin Valley, which supplies 50
percent of the nation's fruit.
The United States govern
ment has done little to ease the
situation. The most blatant
show of non-cooperation came
when Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger denied the
request of Medfly officials to
use Moffet Field Naval Air Sta
tion and all other federal facil
ities in the area as a landing and
fueling spot for the spray heli
copters.
Exaggeration — The good and
the bad of the insecticide
malathion have been widely ex
aggerated and swayed the pub
lic emotion from panic to blind
assurance.
University of California Pro
fessor of Biochemistry Bruce
Ames reviewed some recent
studies performed on malathion
at a Health Advisory Commit
tee meeting last week at Fair
child Auditorium and in doing so
dismissed some rumors.
About the rumored
carcinogenic effects of
malathion, Ames said, "So . . .
from all the carcinogenicity
tests, I think its a pretty clear
negative." However, Ames did
go on to say that because such
tests are performed on mice,
"nobody could ever say that"
malathion is definitely not a hu
man carcinogen.
Tests done to date on rats on
the pesticide's possible birth
defect-causing effects have
proven negative, Ames said.
On the possible mutagenicity
of malathion, Ames said the
tests gave an inconclusive re
sult of "certainly not negative,
maybe barely positive."
So, in the end, what could hap
pen when malathion is sprayed
is not really known. The evi
dence indicates, but does not as
sure, the relative safety of the
insecticide.
Here are some examples of
exaggeration of malathion and
its effects:
•At one meeting of the Medfly
Technical Review Committee,
one citizen warned the commit
tee that the public was so ad
verse to aerial spraying that if it
was approved, there would "be
rioting in the streets, and a huge
exodus." Since then, the High
way Patrol has not been flooded
by fleeing motorists, all Red
Cross refugee centers have shut
down because sparse use, and no
violent protests have taken
place.
•At the press conference dur
ing which Governor Jerry
Brown announced that he would
not approve aerial spraying, Isi
Siddiqui, of the California De
partment of Food and Agricul
ture Chief of Emergency and
Special Projects, was heard
saying "I don't know what these
people are scared of, they use it
(malathion) in their gardens all
the time. "
Confusion — This has typified
the second effort to eradicate
the Medfly. One day would bring
the news that cucumber, pyra
cantha, and corn are secondary
fruit fly hosts and do not have to
be stripped. The day after:
corn, cucumber, and pyra
cantha must be picked im
mediately.
This not only occurred with
what to strip, but when to strip
it. A July 13, 5 p.m. deadline for
stripping was set but enforce
ment was slow to come. Approx
imately one week later, Medfly
officials were saying that strip
ping was not required. Now it is.
One locally sold T-shirt de
clares the Medfly eradication
effort the "Fly Wars." Wars are
filled with non-cooperation, ex
aggeration and confusion; this
battle against the Mediter
ranean fruit fly qualifies as an
all-out war.

and very little fruit stripping."
In leaving this "gap" as such,
the officials failed to cooperate
with their own theory: Once
completely stripped and re
peatedly sprayed, the fly could
be eradicated without aerial
spraying. The current infesta
tion that began on June 26 com
menced in the infamous "Gap."
The most horrendous show of

Exaggeration — The good and
the bad of the insecticide
malathion have been widely ex
aggerated and swayed the pub
lic emotion from panic to blind
assurance.
University of California Pro
fessor of Biochemistry Bruce
Ames reviewed some recent
studies performed on malathion
at a Health Advisory Commit
tee meeting last week at Fair
child Auditorium and in doing so
dismissed some rumors.
About the rumored
carcinogenic effects of
malathion, Ames said, "So . . .
from all the carcinogenicity
tests, I think its a pretty clear
negative." However, Ames did
go on to say that because such
tests are performed on mice,
"nobody could ever say that"
malathion is definitely not a hu
man carcinogen.
Tests done to date on rats on
the pesticide's possible birth
defect-causing effects have
proven negative, Ames said.
On the possible mutagenicity
of malathion, Ames said the
tests gave an inconclusive re
sult of "certainly not negative,
maybe barely positive."
So, in the end, what could hap
pen when malathion is sprayed
is not really known. The evi
dence indicates, but does not as
sure, the relative safety of the
insecticide.
Here are some examples of
exaggeration of malathion and
its effects:
•At one meeting of the Medfly
Technical Review Committee,
one citizen warned the commit
tee that the public was so ad
verse to aerial spraying that if it
was approved, there would "be
rioting in the streets, and a huge
exodus." Since then, the High
way Patrol has not been flooded
by fleeing motorists, all Red
Cross refugee centers have shut
down because sparse use, and no
violent protests have taken
place.
•At the press conference dur
ing which Governor Jerry
Brown announced that he would
not approve aerial spraying, Isi
Siddiqui, of the California De
partment of Food and Agricul
ture Chief of Emergency and
Special Projects, was heard
saying "I don't know what these
people are scared of, they use it
(malathion) in their gardens all
the time. "
Confusion — This has typified
the second effort to eradicate
the Medfly. One day would bring
the news that cucumber, pyra
cantha, and corn are secondary
fruit fly hosts and do not have to
be stripped. The day after:
corn, cucumber, and pyra
cantha must be picked im
mediately.
This not only occurred with
what to strip, but when to strip
it. A July 13, 5 p.m. deadline for
stripping was set but enforce
ment was slow to come. Approx
imately one week later, Medfly
officials were saying that strip
ping was not required. Now it is.
One locally sold T-shirt de
clares the Medfly eradication
effort the "Fly Wars." Wars are
filled with non-cooperation, ex
aggeration and confusion; this
battle against the Mediter
ranean fruit fly qualifies as an
all-out war.

One has to accept that the ov
erall success of the Mediter
ranean fruit fly project will be
measured by the eradication, or
the survival, of the Medfly.
However, despite the fact
that when planned carefully, the
Medfly project has run
smoothly (e.g., the current
aerial spraying), the push to rid
Santa Clara, San Mateo, and
Alameda counties on the na
tional and local levels has been
continuously plagued by three
nagging problems: non-cooper
ation, exaggeration and con
fusion.
Non-cooperation — This was
very evident last summer when
the Medfly project was in its
"larval" stage, when Medfly of
ficials had been granted time to
try a non-aerial spray attack on
the Medfly. After a call for a
massive public fruit stripping
and ground spraying effort, an
area called the "Mountain View
Gap (very close to Santa Clara,
the original core of the Medfly),
"was left with no spraying hav
ing been carried out in that zone
and very little fruit stripping."
In leaving this "gap" as such,
the officials failed to cooperate
with their own theory: Once
completely stripped and re
peatedly sprayed, the fly could
be eradicated without aerial
spraying. The current infesta
tion that began on June 26 com
