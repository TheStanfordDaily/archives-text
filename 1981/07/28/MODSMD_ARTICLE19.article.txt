## Finger bowls, curtseys not included 
### 
In elementary school, report
cards had a section labeled
"shows consideration for oth
ers." With the passage of sixth
grade, that section disappeared,
presumably on the assumption
that we had mastered con
sideration. Have we?
While it is undeniably true
that children can be as cruel, if
not more so, to their peers than
can adults, sometimes it seems
that consideration and respect
for others are qualities we have
still failed to achieve.
This can be deemed a ques
tion of etiquette, albeit it has no
relation to one's ability to emply
the correct silverware at a din
ner party. It is not with knives,
forks, and fingerbowls that I am
concerned.
Those who engage in games of
athletic competition, for exam
ple, are taught that while the
goal of such an endeavor is to de
feat the opposing team, it is
common courtesy to tell the los
ing team "nice game." Such a
remark is perceived as a polite
gesture, a simple rule of eti
quette. "I'm sorry," the generic
equivalent of "Nice game," is
not only under used but also
abused. Repeat it 20 times, and
it means nothing. Say it once,
when it is called for, and those
two words can save a friend
ship.
As Anais Nin noted, "in all of
us there is a human weakness.
The friend is the one who goes
out to strengthen this weakness,
but not to attack it.
This is not to imply that it is

possible, or desirable, for all of
us to be friends; however, it is,
in this context, to suggest that
people who respect themselves
should treat other with respect
and anticipate that such respect
with be reciprocated.
Even if one is not blessed with
a sensitive nature, there are oc
casions in which an inability to
perceive the extent to which one
has insulted or been impolite to
another indicates a need to have
one's eyes and ears examined,
and perhaps one's psyche, with
the aid of a qualified therapist,
if necessary.
While we have all put our feet
in our mouths at times, some
people do not seem satisfied un
til they have swallowed and
digested their feet as well.
Therein lies the difference be
tween an accidental faux pas
and intentional rudeness or dis
respect.
On a professional level, the
adage, "keep your sex life out of
the office," extends to person
ality conflicts as well. You don't
have to love your boss to respect
her managerial abilities.
Assuming that personal opin
ions are not related to an
assessment of professional
capabilities, one's personal
views concerning a co-worker
should remain separate from
one's professional opinion. An
office is not the place to crack a
beer bottle over an ex-lover's
head.
Social and sexual etiquette
differ from professional/office
etiquette; however, the theme,

respect, remains constant. Only
its manifestation varies.
And social etiquette is more
complex than deciding who
should open the door or light a
cigarette, or when it is ap
propriate to curtsey or bow.
It is a matter of respecting
people as people, men and wom
en as equals.
When I am in the midst of an
intellectual conversation with a
man, I assume that he is in
terested in the topic under dis
cussion, in the opinions I'm
trying to convey.
It is far from complimentary,
is actually infuriating, to realize
that after a discussion of a sub
ject such as sexism in liter
ature, that the man's motiva
tion for conversing with me is
due to my gender rather than
my mind.
As far as sex is concerned,
there is something inherently
wrong with the "lay 'em and
leave 'em" syndrome, regard
less of which sex falls victim to
it. If one is mature enough to be
having sex, then one ought to be
able to acknowledge and to take
responsibility for one's actions

after the fact.
If, after a brief sexua! en
counter, one needs to fade
his/her partner into the wood
work, and cannot manage, at
least a minimal, superficial
conversation the following day,
then he/she ought to have slept
alone the preceding night.
Once again, this is a question
of treating others with respect,
of acknowledging one's partner
as a person, not as an object to
be discarded at will.
To learn the correct place
ment for finger bowls, it is easy
to consult Emily Post. How
ever, those who require an eti
quette book in order to learn to
treat others with respect have
no such recourse.
Nevertheless, a truism first
encountered in elementary
school may be of help: "Do unto
others as you would have them
do unto you." Regardless of age,
regardless of how simplistically
didactic it may seem, it is a les
son we are all well advised to ap
ply to our lives.
