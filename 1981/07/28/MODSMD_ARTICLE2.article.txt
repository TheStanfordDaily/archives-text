# Concerts may 'sail' back on Pablo Cruise
## 
### Karen Springen 
October 4 may mark the end
of a concert-less year here, if a
contract currently under nego
tiation with the rock group
a- auiu cruise is finalized.
The appearance by the local
ly-based rock group in Frost
Amphitheater will mark the
first since ASSU Special Events
was disbanded last fall after in
curring more than a $90,000 defi
cit.
According to Alumni Associa
tion Business Manager Roger
Hardy, a contract between Bill
Graham, the largest rock music
producer in the Bay Area and

the University concert commit
tee is being negotiated and
should be completed this week.
Financial risks
Public Events director Vicky
Ho", another member of the
concert committee, said
Graham will assume all finan
cial risks for the concert. She
emphasized that while Graham
is responsible for most of the
production, the committee
"cannot sidestep the responsi
bility or liability of the Univer
sity."
Holt estimated the usual cost
of a concert of similar scale at
about $60,000.

According to Tresidder Union
director Ellie Oppenheim, a
member of the concert commit
tee, the Student Alumni
Network (STAN), a class ac
tivities organization coordi
nated by the Alumni Associa
tion, will sponsor the event.
STAN will provide the Uni
versity liaison work.
The concert will be used for
fund-raising since a percentage
of proceeds will go to STAN. The
guarantee remains to be nego
tiated, but Holt said, "I'm sure
it will be a substantial sum."
Oppenheimer said the Alumni
Association will be the sponsor

and serve as the University
liaison for Graham Produc
tions. Tresidder would handle
the tickets, she said.
Student discount
Holt said the committee
strongly recommended a (lis
count for students. Tickets
should cost in the usual range of
about $8.50 to $10.50. She ex
pects concerts to continue "be
cause Stanford students want
them and will attend them."
Holt said she hopes four to
five concerts can be presented
this year, but not necessarily in
7000-person capacity Frost Am
phitheater. Rather, some con
certs may be held in less risky
sized facilities such as Memori
al Auditorium.
Experience
Holt's experience in concert
promoting includes, she said,
the fact that she produced three
Pablo Cruise concerts in St.
Louis.
But Hardy said, "No campus
group has real expertise."
Meanwhile Danny Sheer,
Graham's vice president for
productions, is a Stanford grad
uate. A member of the class of
'75, he was the head of ASSU
Special Events.
Holt emphasized that Univer
sity concert guidelines are "still
in the final stages." The pro
posal has been made, however,
for a University Committee on
Contemporary Entertainment
Events.
According to Hardy, the con
cert committee has been
charged by the University for
the right to approve the pro
posals of various campus or
ganizations. The committee is
designed to review the terms of
the contract, for example. A
group soliciting permission to
promote a concert should get
committee approval prior to ap
proaching an artist, said Hardy,
adding that groups that need to
raise money to promote their
activities will be eligible to ap
proach the committee.
The Office of Public Events
will be responsible for checking
and approving the final
guidelines and for providing
technical support.

Committee members include
Holt, Oppenheim, Supervisor of
Public Services Bill Cleveland,
ASSU financial manager Cyn

Greene. Assistant Director of
