Pounds of dimes
The new Copico plain paper
copiers in Stanford's libraries
<Daily, July 21) seem at first to
be a great idea, for who could
object to full time service, more
machines, and the "cheapest"
system. Yet this idle Stanford
students has dreamt up some
questions.
Why is it that commercial
outfits in downtown Palo Alto

can offer 5 cent (or even
cheaper) copies while a library
systems needs to charge more?
One dime and copy later, I had
to ask, "is Copico copy quality
really any clearer?"
Then another: why should
anyone carry around a plastic
card with a magnetic strip on
the back worth $50 to get the old
5 cent rate? If scratched or sub
jected to some stray field, the
owner is out of luck, since unlike

a bank card, there is no other
record of the value of the card.
And lastly, should we hope
that no clever engineer figures
out the magnetic code? (But
then maybe that's why there are
no refunds on partially used
cards?)
No thanks; I'd rather carry
around five pounds of dimes; at
least they're accepted at more
places than a few college librar
ies.

No mayor
In an article (Daily, July 21)
reference was made to the
"Mayor" of East Palo Alto.
There is NO such person.
I have lived in the area for
30 years now and have seen
great changes. As the area had
no direct link with the San
Mateo Board of Supervisors, a
Council was established to act
as a sort of "hot line." There are
five members on the Council,
they have no direct jurisdiction,
as they are only an advisory
body.
There is no Mayor, and that
is how it has been until recent
years, when the member in
charge has taken on the title,
but the community has never
honored it.
I do agree that there is a great
lack of communication between
the area and the Board of Super
visors, and the instance cited
about the Medfly is very true.
We do not know what is going
on; if there will be spraying, or
if there will be a pick-up.
We really need a workable
hot line that will lend an ins
tant and willing ear to our re
quests and suggestions
