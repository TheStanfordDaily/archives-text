# 'S.O.B' exposes Hollywood and Julie Andrews
## 
### Becky Smith 
Julie Andrews does indeed
have two breasts. And Blake
Edwards' new film 6'. (J. B. is in
deed a hilarious stab at Holly
wood . . . when he isn't lapsing
into a Mel Brooksian "excre
tion, pain, and death" humor.
Edwards, a director who left
Hollywood on "bad terms'' a
few years ago, has come back to
poke fun — with a vengeance —
at just about everybody. Ev
erybody — from the slimy stu
dio big wig (Robert Vaughn) to
the obnoxious gossip columnist

(Loretta Swit); the swinging
Hollywood doctor (Robert Pres
ton) to the corrupt talent agent
(Shelley Winters).
And in between are the pro
ducers, executive producers,
yes-men, young stars, and . . .
who else? The director (Burt
Mulligan)!
In S.O. H. all Hollywood exag
gerations come true. Everyone
is sleeping with everyone, the
studio president wears pink
panties and high heels when he
is, uhh, in bed; the talent agent
is a huge domineering lesbian;

the producers are dirty old men
who drink too much, the gossip
columnist is a real bitch with a
capital "B," and America's
sweetheart, our own Mary Pop
pins, has two breasts that she
exposes in an erotic film to re
coup several million dollars.
Here's where we come to the
plot.
Felix Farmer, successful
Hollywood director, has made a
new $35 million film. It is not
successful; not successful at all.
Felix is depressed, so de
pressed, in fact, that he tries to

comit suicide a few times.
He is snapped out of his
lethargy by an idea. He will re
make the sweet musical he has
made. He will remake it as an
erotic film. He does.
But Hollywood is not as
simple as that. Many deals and
double deals, manipulating and
blackmail go into the making of
a film. And the plot grows com
plicated.
But I won't give that away.
It's worth seeing for yourself,
because 5.0.8. is very funny.

The set designs are excellent,
the cinematography is well
done, the jokes are funny, and
the cast is great. A screenful of
well-known and talented people
look like they are having a ball
making this movie.
It's a fun and funny film, es
pecially if you are interested in
movie-making. But a word of
warning. If you don't like silli
ness, there are a few scenes that
may turn you off. But as Steve
Martin once said, "Comedy is
not pretty."
Julie Andrews does indeed
have two breasts. And Blake
