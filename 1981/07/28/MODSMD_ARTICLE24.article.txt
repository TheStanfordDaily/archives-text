Endless Love should be an in
teresting movie. It promises to
explore the problems of the '60s
generation as it deals with the
coming of age of its own chil
dren. It also offers the tempta
tion of love scenes with Brooke
Shields, the girl every Ameri
can boy wants to molest. Final
ly, the director is Franco
Zeferelli, a director of no mean
talent who has explored this
area before, in his Romeo and
Juliet.
The film fails on every count.
The story is confused and un
inspired, populated by lifeless

characters. The erotic content
is small and hardly breath
taking. Even if the film had
failed as a work of art, it should
have been able to pull in hordes
of teenagers with the promise of
forbidden sights. But it fails
even at this level. Zeferelli has
succeeded in making a thor
oughly boring film.
The story is about two high
schoolers, Jade, played by
Shields, and David, played by
Martin Hewitt. They are very
much in love, and that love turns
into obsession. When they start
sleeping together, neither set of
parents takes it well. Un
fortunately, we are never sure
why. While the secondary char-

acters make the motions neces
sary to carry forward the plot,
they have no obvious motivation
for anything they do.
For example, when Jade's pa
rents learn that she is sleeping
with David, her mother is
charmed while her father and
brother are furious. Since this is
a very liberal and liberated
family, the choosing of sides is
uninteresting. But the previous
action doesn't explain why they
should act this way, nor do the
characters explain themselves.
They just read their lines and do
what they should to set up the
rest of the story.

Not only do these characters
have no obvious inner life, they
never seem to learn. After
David sets fire to Jade's house,
hoping to be able to rescue the
family and become a hero,
Jade's father never forgives
him. He practically foams at the
mouth throughout the rest cf the
film. He is so absorbed by his
hatred that when he sees David
years later in the middle of New
York, he runs to grab him and is
killed by an auto. Why does he
act this way? Who knows? Who
cares?
This points out another prob
lem with the film; its lessons
are obscure and confusing and
everybody is obsessed by ev-

eryone else. Jade's father is ob
sessed with his hatred for the
boy who violated his daughter.
David is obsessed by his love for
Jade and driven to near mad
ness from it, and Jade is simi
larly consumed by love and can
not leave him, even after he
bums down her house and is in
volved in her father's death.
Is the lesson here that some
lucky people are blessed with a
love that can endure anything?
Or is it that such a young love is
ultimately and utterly destruc
tive? Both sound equally
absurd. In either case, the love
of Jade and David is so strongly

tied to mental illness that it is
made unpalatable, lessening
what little artistic and com
mercial value the film may
have.
Even with all its flaws, the
film might have been of some in
terest if the love scenes between
Hewitt and Shields had been in
teresting. True, they weren't
done in the soft focus that has
become so fashionable and
banal, but very little else can be
said for them. The plot is so bor
ing that it would take a lot more
to shake the audience out of its
stupor.
There is nothing special about
these scenes: just two bodies
wrapped around each other.

Zeferelli seems as interested in
Hewitt as in Shields, a disap
pointing turn of events. There
isn't even enough quantity to
make up for the poor quality.
It seems that this film is
doomed to commercial failure.
It doesn't have the depth to ap
peal to mature audiences. And

between its R rating and its fail
ure to deliver on the heavy
breathing love scenes promised,
it won't draw the teenage dating
crowd, either. While this film
should have had enough attrac
tions to satisfy enough groups, it
really isn't worth seeing even at
a bargain matinee.


But are they still smiling?

area before, in his Romeo and
Juliet.
The film fails on every count.
The story is confused and un
inspired, populated by lifeless

characters. The erotic content
is small and hardly breath
taking. Even if the film had
failed as a work of art, it should
have been able to pull in hordes
of teenagers with the promise of
forbidden sights. But it fails
even at this level. Zeferelli has
succeeded in making a thor
oughly boring film.
The story is about two high
schoolers, Jade, played by
Shields, and David, played by
Martin Hewitt. They are very
much in love, and that love turns
into obsession. When they start
sleeping together, neither set of
parents takes it well. Un
fortunately, we are never sure
why. While the secondary char-

acters make the motions neces
sary to carry forward the plot,
they have no obvious motivation
for anything they do.
For example, when Jade's pa
rents learn that she is sleeping
with David, her mother is
charmed while her father and
brother are furious. Since this is
a very liberal and liberated
family, the choosing of sides is
uninteresting. But the previous
action doesn't explain why they
should act this way, nor do the
characters explain themselves.
They just read their lines and do
what they should to set up the
rest of the story.

Not only do these characters
have no obvious inner life, they
never seem to learn. After
David sets fire to Jade's house,
hoping to be able to rescue the
family and become a hero,
Jade's father never forgives
him. He practically foams at the
mouth throughout the rest cf the
film. He is so absorbed by his
hatred that when he sees David
years later in the middle of New
York, he runs to grab him and is
killed by an auto. Why does he
act this way? Who knows? Who
cares?
This points out another prob
lem with the film; its lessons
are obscure and confusing and
everybody is obsessed by ev-

eryone else. Jade's father is ob
sessed with his hatred for the
boy who violated his daughter.
David is obsessed by his love for
Jade and driven to near mad
ness from it, and Jade is simi
larly consumed by love and can
not leave him, even after he
bums down her house and is in
volved in her father's death.
Is the lesson here that some
lucky people are blessed with a
love that can endure anything?
Or is it that such a young love is
ultimately and utterly destruc
tive? Both sound equally
absurd. In either case, the love
of Jade and David is so strongly

tied to mental illness that it is
made unpalatable, lessening
what little artistic and com
mercial value the film may
have.
Even with all its flaws, the
film might have been of some in
terest if the love scenes between
Hewitt and Shields had been in
teresting. True, they weren't
done in the soft focus that has
become so fashionable and
banal, but very little else can be
said for them. The plot is so bor
ing that it would take a lot more
to shake the audience out of its
stupor.
There is nothing special about
these scenes: just two bodies
wrapped around each other.

Zeferelli seems as interested in
Hewitt as in Shields, a disap
pointing turn of events. There
isn't even enough quantity to
make up for the poor quality.
It seems that this film is
doomed to commercial failure.
It doesn't have the depth to ap
peal to mature audiences. And

between its R rating and its fail
ure to deliver on the heavy
breathing love scenes promised,
it won't draw the teenage dating
crowd, either. While this film
should have had enough attrac
tions to satisfy enough groups, it
really isn't worth seeing even at
a bargain matinee.


But are they still smiling?
