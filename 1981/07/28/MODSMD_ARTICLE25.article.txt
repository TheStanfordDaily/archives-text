# Swashbuckling Zorro Jr. as entertaining as pop
## 
### Andres Fajardo 
By combining a zany Mel
Brooks-style continuity and a
story remarkably similar to
that of the 1934 swashbuckler
The Scarlet Pimpernel, it would
seem that Zorro, the Gay Blade
is probably just a hodge podge of
old jokes and an even older
storyline.
In Zorro, however, George
Hamilton, after a string of rath
er mediocre films (such as
Death Car on the Freeway), has
finally created a movie well
worth the admission fee.
The plot, as in the original
The Mark of Zorro starring
Douglas Fairbanks, revolves
around Don Diego Vega (Hamil
ton),a rich 19th-century
Spanish nobleman who returns
to his homeland, California, at
the request of his father, a
ranching don.
From there on, Zorro departs
from its predecessor. The Don
Diego in this picture is the son of
the original Zorro and the time
is 50 years after the father's
sword-flashing, justice-seeking
heyday.
And so, with instructions
from his now-deceased papa,
the young don meets his in
herited destiny to "defeat the

defeatless" and battle the cruel
oppression of his rival, Captain
Esteban Pasquale (Ron Lieb
man) who has brought injustice
and oppression to Don Diego's
birthplace, Los Angeles.
The love interest in Zorro is
provided by Charlotte Taylor
Wilson (Lauren Hutton), a Jane
Fonda-type political activist
urging the destitute peasants to
follow the example of their
American counterparts by over
throwing the tyrannical
Esteban.
Early in the movie the young
Zorro is put out of commission
after embarassing Esteban, the
new alcade — mayor — of Los
Angeles. Zorro sprains an ankle
after diving off a balcony and
his twin brother Ramon takes
over. Ramon, who is also played
by Hamilton, declares that
"There is no shame in being
poor, only in dressing poor,"
and goes on to liven up the
"drab" uniform of Zorro with
lace and bright colors.
While Zorro is full of the same
brand of Mel Brooks' crazy and
delightful details, it is delivered
without the overdose of bath
room jokes employed by
Brooks. Without such vulgarity,
screen story writers Hal

Dresner, Greg Alt and Don
Moriarty have constructed a
script that virtually overflows
with a constant prattle of enter
taining puns, quips and reviv
ing crispness.
There are some similarities
to The Scarlet Pimpernel — the
story of an English nobleman
who secretly saves French
aristocrats doomed to the
guillotine. The Pimpernel has
the same taste for high fashion
and adventure.
In a similar vein Ramon, dis
guised as the sensuous

Margarita Wigglesworth, tries
to steal a priceless necklace
while courting Esteban. In this
disguise he concocts a poem en
titled Ode to a Bandit to ridi
cule Esteban just as the Pim
pernel does when he ridicules
his French adversary.
Director Peter Medak fills
Zorro with colorful period dress
and costume balls, a favorite of
Florinda — Esteban's malcon
tent wife played by Brenda Vac
caro.
Zorro, despite its comical

triumph and swordplay that ri
vals both The Adventures of
Robin Hood and Scaramouche,
fails to give the character of
Esteban the effectiveness that
it deserves. Esteban is so exag
gerated that I felt like covering
my ears whenever the evil cap
tain began one of his many pro
longed fits.
However, Zorro, the Gay
Blade is refreshing: here is a
comedy, with a swashbuckling
heritage, that refrains from the
vulgarities that so often plague
its contemporaries.


Zorro (George Hamilton) crosses swords with the army of with his arch-rival, the Alcade, in "Zorro,
the Gay Blade."
