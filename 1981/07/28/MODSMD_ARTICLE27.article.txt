# 'Fireworks Rag' a mixture of the good and the bad
## 
### Mike Hale 
If the measure of a musical was the fun the cast
seemed to have putting it on, then TheatreWorks'
production of The Fireworks Rag is an unqualified
success. The opening-night audience at Palo Alto's
Lucie Stern Center was infected with the en
thusiasm of the high-spirited cast. They laughed,
yelled, and cheered throughout the performance.
There was a certain tension apparent in both au
dience and cast before the show, probably because
this was the opening night of a world premiere. The
book and lyrics of The Fireworks Rag were written
by Robert Kelley, TheatreWorks' artistic director.
It was evident that the partisan crowd wanted the lo
cal company to do well and that much more was at
stake with this production than with a Hamlet or a
Man of La Mancha. The storms of applause the
show received may have been an over-reaction to
the fact that it wasn't horrible, as many people prob
ably feared it would be.
The Fireworks Rag is, in the words of the pro
gram, "an original ragtime comedy based on the
music of Scott Joplin." What this means is that
Kelley has written lyrics for a number of Joplin's
compositions, and strung together the resulting
songs with a story set in St. Louis on the Fourth of
July, 1895, involving Joplin himself. This story is
what's wrong with The Fireworks Rag. The play is
really a revue masquerading as a musical; almost
everything that is good in it involves singing and
dancing. The plot, based on a Goldoni's II Cam
piello, is needlessly intricate; there are three dif
ferent love affairs proceeding simultaneously, and
matters are further complicated by scheming moth
ers, a brothelful of dancing whores, and frantic
preparations for the Independance Day parade. The
conventions of 18th-century Italian comedy do not,
in this case, fit in well with the musical form; be-

tween songs, the six love interests are given equal
time, with the result that none of them make a claim
on our attention. The entire business of bringing to
gether his couples does not seem to have interested
Kelley much; he appears to have had much more fun
with the two mothers. These are stock characters,
aggressive older women who are just as interested
in men as are their beautiful, marriageable daugh
ters. These two, played to the hilt by H. Teirrah
McNair and Patricia Renee Lubin, were the obvious
audience favorites. They were quite funny — Kelley
does manage witty dialogue — but there was a same
ness to the humor, constant variations on old age and
sex jokes, that quickly became numbing.
The faults of the book reflect a more basic prob
lem. one of conception. I can't be sure what Kelley
intended when he wrote The Fireworks Rag —
whether he wanted to say something about ragtime
and its origins, or to write a musical comedy using
ragtime as a background. He probably wanted both,
but has ended up right in the middle without fully
achieving either.
Despite the clunky elements, however, there is
much that is good in the show. The choreography, by
Susie Cashion and Bobbie Wynn. was excellent for a
production at this level; while heavily reminiscent
of Alvin Ailey's work (the entire show often had the
feel of an Ailey dance), it always seemed to be just
what was needed at the moment, and was danced in
fine style by Glenn Goodson and Bobbie Wynn (there
was a rigid line in the production between the dan
cers and the actors). And several of Kelley's songs
were very catchy — just right for a Broadway revue.
Especially good was "Wedding Day," a song of cele
bration done by the whole cast.
