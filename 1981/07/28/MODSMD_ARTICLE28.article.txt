Reagan 'sells' tax cut
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
asked the nation last night to turn up the
heat on Congress to pass his tax cut over a
rival Democratic plan which he branded
"just another empty promise." The choice,
he said, really amounts to "a tax cut or a tax
increase."
At the same time, he assured older Amer
icans that "you have no reason to be fright
ened' ' about the financial integrity of the So
cial Security system.
The president mentioned Social Security
only in passing in his prepared address for a
nationwide television audience.
"In any plan to restore fiscal integrity of
Social Security I personally will see that no
part of the plan will be at the expense of you
who are now dependent on your monthly So
cial Security checks," Reagan said.
As for the tax battle, Reagan declared
just two days before a scheduled showdown
vote in the House that under the Democratic
proposal, Americans would wind up paying
more — not less — to the government.
U.S. pleased with cease-fire
Washington — The Reagan adminis
tration voiced growing optimism yesterday
that the cease-fire in Lebanon will last and

disclosed it will make a decision on resum
ing shipments of F-16 jets to Israel within
two weeks.
"We expect a decision will be made by
then,'' said State Department spokesman
Dean Fischer. Officials have indicated pre
viously that if the cease-fire holds, the 10
planes now being withheld from Israel will
be delivered.
Meanwhile, President Ronald Reagan
met at the White House with his special Mid
east envoy, Philip Habib, who negotiated
the halt to the fighting between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization last
Friday.
Afterward, Habib told reporters he prob
ably will return to the Middle East on his
peace-making mission, although he wasn't
sure when. He said the cease-fire may open
the way to a broader peace accord.
FBI: Hinckley acted alone
Washington — The FBI has concluded
that John Hinckley acted alone in a March
30 shooting of President Ronald Reagan, an
FBI spokesman said Sunday.
Bureau spokesman Roger Young said
that within the last week or 10 days the FBI
had sent its second report on the investiga
tion of the wounding of Reagan outside the
Washington Hilton Hotel to Charles Ruff,

U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
Ruff is preparing the government's prose
cution of Hinckley on charges of attempting
to assassinate the president.
"The second report tied up loose ends in
our investigation and informed Ruff that the
FBI had not found any information that this
attack was a conspiracy," Young said.
Young added that federal rules requiring
that grand jury material be kept secret pre
cluded the FBI from disclosing any details
of its report on Hinckley.

terest rates sparked a strong advance in
