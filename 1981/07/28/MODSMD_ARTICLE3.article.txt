# Waste just can't go 'down the drain'
## Chemical storage scrutinized 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
A University committee is ex
amining seven possible campus
sites for construction of a
storage facility for chemical
wastes produced in laboratory
and research experiments here.
The extended search comes as a
result of local residents' pro
tests concerning a proposed site
250 yards from a nearby resi
dential area and close to the lo
cation of the undergraduate
housing project, scheduled for
completion in 1984.
In a building permit applica
tion to the Santa Clara County
Planning Commission, the Uni
versity specified a site in the
field west of the Medical Center
and the new extension of Cam
pus Drive.
But the permit application
may be changed if one of the
three sites which do not border
on residential areas is found
feasible by the committee, ac
cording to Dr. James Spudich,
chairman of the Medical
School's department of struc
tural biology, a member of the
University's investigative com
mittee and a resident in the area
adjoining the proposed site.
Spudich, who works with
some of the chemicals in ques
tion, said that "right now, they
just sit out on the shelves. The
days are gone when you just
dump these things down the

drains." The waste is now re
moved from the labratories to a
small brick shed behind the
chemistry building where it is
picked up by a contracted waste
disposal company and taken to
one of various dumping sites
"probably in Southern Califor
nia."
The problems with the pres
ent setup arise with the condi
tions of the temporary storage
and the transfer of the waste
products from the building.
Some of the substances, which
include carcinogens and various
other pathogens, are volatile
compounds which react with
water, or produce fumes which
evaporate into the atmosphere.
The danger is not great of any
accident affecting the Univer
sity population. Spudich said,
but precautions are necessary
to reduce even the slight chance
of mishap, and the effects of
such an event.
The committee has decided
that none of the sites would en
danger any nearby residents or
workers, and in fact removing
the chemicals from the labs will
reduce the possibility of acci
dent. However, they have been
deliberating for two months
without reaching a conclusion
regarding a site.
Alain Decleve, director of oc
cupational neaun anu saieiy anu
biosafety here, and chairman of

the committee, said through his
secretary that he would not
comment on the controversy be
cause the issue is still in the de
cision-making stage, and too
complicated to summarize in a
brief capsulization.
The need for a centralized
"depot" for chemical wastes is
not a new one here, but it has re
cently come into the foreground
as a pressing issue.
In February, opening the 25th
industrial affiliates program of
the Departments of Chemistry
and Chemical Engineering
here, Emmett Barkley, head of
research safety for the National
Institute of Health (NIH),
stressed the importance of safe
handling of chemical wastes. He
said, however, that there is a
conspicuous lack of evidence
that the public is endangered or
affected in any way by labora
tory research with pathogenic
(disease-causing) chemicals.
Although there are "no feder
al regulations directly ap

plicable to handling biological
materials at NIH," he said that
NIH is developing its own in
ternal guidelines for the han
dling of carcinogens and other
pathogens. These guidelines
will directly affect institutions
receiving NIH funding, such as
Stanford. In order to guarantee
continued financial support by
NIH, Stanford researchers will
have to conform to these new
guidelines.
Spudich said that further im
petus for the facility came from
pressure exerted in the past
year-and-a-half by federal regu
latory agencies such as the En

vironmental Protection Agen
cy, "They said that the Univer
sity better do something about
the situation or they would start
closing down some labs."
All of the proposed sites for
the facility have a radius of
safety, the committee found,
that does not include any
houses. This radius, said
Spudich, covers the area af
fected were the structure
"blown up."
Spudich describes the prob
lem with the site as political:
"People are very tuned into
chemical waste."
In a 1979 investigation by

state industrial hygenists into
the handling of chemicals and
chemical wastes by University
laboratories, Stanford was fined
$3585 for alleged violations of
health and safety regulations.
The investigators said that
Stanford was "pretty much the
same" as other universities.
The officials suggested at the
time the need for a central
storage facility for chemical
carcinogenic waste products,
noting that although state and
federal regulations apply to
large quantity users, they do not
specifically cover research or
teaching institutions.

cause the issue is still in the de
cision-making stage, and too
complicated to summarize in a
brief capsulization.
The need for a centralized
"depot" for chemical wastes is
not a new one here, but it has re
cently come into the foreground
as a pressing issue.
In February, opening the 25th
industrial affiliates program of
the Departments of Chemistry
and Chemical Engineering
here, Emmett Barkley, head of
research safety for the National
Institute of Health (NIH),
stressed the importance of safe
handling of chemical wastes. He
said, however, that there is a
conspicuous lack of evidence
that the public is endangered or
affected in any way by labora
tory research with pathogenic
(disease-causing) chemicals.
Although there are "no feder
al regulations directly ap

plicable to handling biological
materials at NIH," he said that
NIH is developing its own in
ternal guidelines for the han
dling of carcinogens and other
pathogens. These guidelines
will directly affect institutions
receiving NIH funding, such as
Stanford. In order to guarantee
continued financial support by
NIH, Stanford researchers will
have to conform to these new
guidelines.
Spudich said that further im
petus for the facility came from
pressure exerted in the past
year-and-a-half by federal regu
latory agencies such as the En

vironmental Protection Agen
cy, "They said that the Univer
sity better do something about
the situation or they would start
closing down some labs."
All of the proposed sites for
the facility have a radius of
safety, the committee found,
that does not include any
houses. This radius, said
Spudich, covers the area af
fected were the structure
"blown up."
Spudich describes the prob
lem with the site as political:
"People are very tuned into
chemical waste."
In a 1979 investigation by

state industrial hygenists into
the handling of chemicals and
chemical wastes by University
laboratories, Stanford was fined
$3585 for alleged violations of
health and safety regulations.
The investigators said that
Stanford was "pretty much the
same" as other universities.
The officials suggested at the
time the need for a central
storage facility for chemical
carcinogenic waste products,
noting that although state and
federal regulations apply to
large quantity users, they do not
specifically cover research or
teaching institutions.
A University committee is ex
amining seven possible campus
sites for construction of a
storage facility for chemical
wastes produced in laboratory
and research experiments here.
The extended search comes as a
result of local residents' pro
tests concerning a proposed site
250 yards from a nearby resi
dential area and close to the lo
cation of the undergraduate
housing project, scheduled for
completion in 1984.
In a building permit applica
tion to the Santa Clara County
Planning Commission, the Uni
versity specified a site in the
field west of the Medical Center
and the new extension of Cam
pus Drive.
But the permit application
may be changed if one of the
three sites which do not border
on residential areas is found
feasible by the committee, ac
cording to Dr. James Spudich,
chairman of the Medical
School's department of struc
tural biology, a member of the
University's investigative com
mittee and a resident in the area
adjoining the proposed site.
Spudich, who works with
some of the chemicals in ques
tion, said that "right now, they
just sit out on the shelves. The
days are gone when you just
dump these things down the

drains." The waste is now re
moved from the labratories to a
small brick shed behind the
chemistry building where it is
picked up by a contracted waste
disposal company and taken to
one of various dumping sites
"probably in Southern Califor
nia."
The problems with the pres
ent setup arise with the condi
tions of the temporary storage
and the transfer of the waste
products from the building.
Some of the substances, which
include carcinogens and various
other pathogens, are volatile
compounds which react with
water, or produce fumes which
evaporate into the atmosphere.
The danger is not great of any
accident affecting the Univer
sity population. Spudich said,
but precautions are necessary
to reduce even the slight chance
of mishap, and the effects of
such an event.
The committee has decided
that none of the sites would en
danger any nearby residents or
workers, and in fact removing
the chemicals from the labs will
reduce the possibility of acci
dent. However, they have been
deliberating for two months
without reaching a conclusion
regarding a site.
Alain Decleve, director of oc
cupational neaun anu saieiy anu
biosafety here, and chairman of

the committee, said through his
secretary that he would not
comment on the controversy be
cause the issue is still in the de
cision-making stage, and too
complicated to summarize in a
brief capsulization.
