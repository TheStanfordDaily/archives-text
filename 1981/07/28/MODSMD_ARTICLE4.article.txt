# Medfly larvae discovered here
## Ground spraying will soon follow malathion doses 
### Andres Fajardo 
Mediterranean fruit fly
larvae discovered on the Uni
versity campus Wednesday,
will prompt the ground spraying
of diazinon in a mile and a half
radius around the site, Medfly
project officials said yesterday,
only hours after helicopters
sprayed the campus with its
first dose of malathion.
Diazinon, a class II insec
ticide (more toxic than
malathion), is used in a
drenching of the soil that kills
any Medfly pupae that have
fallen to the ground.

The larvae were found in the
faculty residence area adjacent
to the central campus, said Uni
versity News and Publications
Service Director Bob Beyers.
According to Medfly spokes
man Richard Stefson, areas in
cluding and bordering the Medi
cal Center are considered sensi
tive and will not be ground
sprayed with diazinon or aerial
ly sprayed with malathion.
However, plants in the hospital
zone will have malathion
sprayed (from the ground) onto
their foliage.
The campus is now in aerial
spray corridor number six. an
area that spreads from Page
Mill Rd. in Palo Alto to Crystal
Springs Rd. in San Mateo and
lies between Highways 280 and
101.
Stefson said that the first
round of aerial spraying over
the University area was without
problem and that 25 square
miles were covered in three
hours, 32 minutes.
"If everything goes as
planned, corridor six could re
ceive its next spraying next
week, possibly as early as Mon
day," Stefson said.
Medfly official Bill Pope fiaid
yesterday that all areas are
sprayed every seven to 10 days,
six times each.
Bill Sousa, supervisor for
campus grounds maintenance,
said that yesterday main
tenance workers washed patios
and cars around the University.
Janine Costa, a graduate stu
dent living in Escondido Vil
lage, said that village residents
had covered their patios with
large plastic sheets provided by
the Escondido Village Office.
Costa, along with her husband
Carl, had previously protested
against possible aerial applica
tion of malathion. Now, how
ever, she described any further
protest as "pointless" and that
she would just follow the normal
precautions against the
pesticide.
No aerial spraying was held
on Sunday because officials did
not want to disrupt any weekend
recreation.
Plans to conduct daytime
aerial spraying to the west of
Highway 280 wereannounced
over the weekend.
