# Mexico enters medfly war
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Mexican officials said yester
day they have started turning
back produce trucks from Cali
fornia, calling the move a neces
sary step in preventing the
spread of a destructive fruit fly.
The extent of the ban was not
clear. A statement from Jorge
Gutierrez Samperio, director of
vegetable sanitation for the Ag
riculture Ministry, said Mexico
had banned the importation of
produce from Santa Clara, San
Mateo, Alameda and Los Angel
es counties.
However, the statement went
on to say the step is "only a pre
cautionary measure." Los An
geles county nas noi oeen in
fested with the Mediterranean

fruit fly.
The announcement came as
California workers hoping to
stop the spread of the fly fanned
out through the Santa Clara Val
ley, telling residents to strip
fruit trees quickly or face the
possibility of jail.
California Conservation
Corps workers and state Fish
and Game officers went door-to
door issuing compliance notices
giving residents 48 hours to take
the fruit off their trees, said
Richard Steffen, spokesman for
the Medfly Eradication Project.
Overall compliance with the
order in the 770-square-mile
stripping zone was estimated at
ou peiceiu mm vvcciv.
One round of aerial spraying

in the 257-square-mile spraying
zone, which is within the strip
ping area, has been completed.
Six aerial applications of
malathion over the infested
"core" area are planned.
The stripping zone is part of a
three-county quarantine area
covering 2082 square miles. No
untreated produce is allowed to
move out of the area, although
the Medfly has not been dis
covered on commercial farms.
California grows half the na
tion's produce and the Medfly,
which lays its eggs in 200 varie
ties of fruits and vegetables, is
considered a threat to the $14
billion-a-year industry, cen-
