## Cutting oil imports no longer a priority Gov't. energy policy released 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Reagan
administration unveiled its of
ficial energy policy last week,
declaring, in a break from
Carter administration prac
tices, that the free market — not
the government — should de
termine how best to produce and
distribute the nation's energy.
And. in a break with a policy
dating back to the Nixon admin
istration, the Reagan report
said that achieving a low level of
U.S. oil imports no matter what
the cost is not "a major
criterion for the nation's energy
security and economic health "
The 35-page report translated
the administration's free-mar
ket philosophy into policies on
energy production, distribution,
consumption and conservation.
The document, called the Na
tional Energy Policy Plan, is re
quired by law to be submitted to
Congress by the Department of
Energy each year.
Domestic alternatives
"Even at its current high
price, imported oil in some
cases is substantially less ex
pensive than available alter
natives,'' the report said. "The
nation would be remiss if it did
not press the search for less ex
pensive domestic alternatives.
Yet its vision would be equally
narrow if market forces were
distorted through in
discriminate subsidies for alter
natives that cost more than im

ported oil now and offer no
short-term to midterm like
lihood of being economically
competitive.''
Highlights
Other highlights of the report
and a Department of Energy
briefing:
•Nuclear power should be
brought back to a level at which
it could compete equally with
other forms of energy, but
should not be given an artificial
advantage over them.
• Renewable energy re
sources such as solar power will
probably increase in attractive
ness as subsidies for conven
tional fuels are removed and
general energy prices climb
•The free market, even in a
crisis, should determine the
type of energy to be developed,
how the energy will be dis
tributed, and at what price it
should be sold.
Nuclear energy
While the administration fa
vors removing what it sees as
unnecessary regulation of the
nuclear energy industry, and
speeding up the licensing proc
ess for nuclear power plants, of
ficials said that action would
only end past government dis
crimination against nuclear
power and allow it to compete
fairly with other industries.
"What we're trying to do is
not make nuclear (power) more
equal than the competition,"
said Benard Rusche. special as

sistant to Secretary of Energy
James Edwards. "If the market
wants to exclude nuclear, then
so be it."
Solar energy
The Republican adminis
tration requested $241 million
for solar energy in 1982 com
pared with $684 million that the
previous Democratic adminis
tration had proposed.
Federal tax credits that allow
homeowners to deduct some of
the cost of installing solar
energy systems will be con
tinued, but will be subject to
careful scrutiny to make sure
that the systems have a reason
able chance to be competitive
on their own within a reasonable
time, the report said.
Severe disruptions
The administration's belief in
the efficiency of the free market
extends even to the energy poli
cy to be used in case of severe
disruptions in oil supply, where,
the report said, chaotic condi
tions have resulted in the past
when rigid "father knows best"
approaches were followed.
"The administration realizes
that free markets will not work
perfectly during a severe dis
ruption," the report said. "In
general, however, they will
work more smoothly, with
greater certainty, and ultimate
ly more fairly than complex sys
tems of price and allocation con
trols managed by the govern
ment."
