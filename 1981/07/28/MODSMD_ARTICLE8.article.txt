# U.S. vote for Argentina loans marks new human rights policy
## 
### Washington Post 
Buenos Aires, Argentina —
Earlier this month, acting on
highly publicized and con
troversial orders from the State
Department, U.S. represent
atives to the World Bank voted
in favor of two energy develop
ment loans, totaling $300 mil
lion, for Argentina.
The votes broke a four-year
tradition of voting no or abstain
ing on loans to countries con
sidered human rights violators,
one of the hallmarks of former
President Carter's foreign poli
cy. They also added con
siderable fuel to the Washington
debate over how the Reagan ad
ministration has mapped out a
new world alignment of Ameri
ca's friends and enemies.
Both critics and supporters
have acknowledged that the Ar
gentina votes were devoid of
almost any but symbolic mean
ing. The loans, like every other
World Bank or Inter-American
Development Bank loan granted
to Argentina in recent years,
would have been approved re

gardless of the U.S. vote.
But it is the symbolism that
has mattered.
In 1977, an act of Congress
prohibited the United States
from approving almost any
World Bank or Inter-American
Development Bank loan to coun
tries exhibiting a "consistent
pattern of gross violations of hu
man rights." The act excepted
only those loans aimed at "basic
human needs. " From then until
the Argentina loan approval on
July 7, American represent
atives abstained or voted no on
all loans not involving "basic
human needs" to the four na
tions of what is known as South
America's southern cone — Ar
gentina, Chile, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
With their governments
either dominated or openly run
by the military, a history of po
litical repression throughout
much of the 1970s and a record
of complaints of human rights
violations that is unequalled in
the West, the nations of the
southern cone became the most
visible targets of Carter's hu
man rights campaign. Although
there was never a blanket direc
tive labeling the four countries
"consistent and gross vio
laters," each loan application
was studied by an interagency
working group of U.S. officials
who assessed the human rights
situation in the country in ques
tion. In every instance, during
the Carter years, the situation
was found to be bad enough —
disappearances, political pris
oners, torture, arbitrary deten
tions — that U.S. approval was
withheld.
When Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig this month defended
the U.S. decision to approve all
multinational development
bank loans to the southern cone,
he said one of the major reasons
for the switch was the im
pressive changes he believed
had taken place in the region.
"Without exception in each
case the improvement has been
dramatic," Haig said. "Now,
that improvement does not rep
resent ... a corresponding
level of complacency here in
Washington that all that must be
done has been done. But we do
not believe that it serves any
useful purpose to indulge in
isolation and public admonish
ment in the face of internal im
provements that have already
taken place."
Although there is no question
that the governments of Argen
tina, Chile and Uruguay have
almost completely stopped
"disappearances," the most
widely attacked repressive tac
tic of the 19705. Haig's claim of
"dramatic improvement" has
met with skepticism here by the
people who monitor human
rights most closely. Country by
country, here is a comparison
between 1977 and 1981:
•Argentina: At the end of
1977, the Buenos Aires-based

Permanent Assembly for Hu
man Rights received testimony
on the disappearance of 1200
people.
The cumulative total — peo
ple kidnapped or arrested who
vanished without a trace — to
day stands at about 5800 in the
assembly's records.
In 1977, the assembly's rec
ords indicate that about 3600
people were in jail under ex
ecutive power. Last January.ac
cording to public statements by
Interior Ministry spokesmen.
900 people remained under ex
ecutive power, 300 of them
without ever having been
charged.
•Chile: Of the approximately
700 disappearances reported to
the Vicariate of Solidarity, 14
took place in 1977. The last dis
appearance report the church
received was in January 1978
In 1977, following a massive
release of political prisoners the
year before, about 20 persons
were in jail on what church rec
ords show as political charges.
They now list 134 political pris
oners.
The church has received 29
reports in 1981 from people who
said they had been tortured by
the Chilean secret police. As in
Argentina, labor organizing and
political activity are illegal, and
show no signs of opening up in
the near future.
•Uruguay: In 1977, Amnesty
International estimated that
there were 5000 political pris
oners in Uruguay, and that
50,000 people had been detained
at one time or another since the
1973 military coup, giving
Uruguay the dubious distinction
of having the most political pris
oners per capita in the world.
The current number of what
human rights groups refer to as
"political prisoners" is esti
mated at between 1100 and 1500.
The male prisoners are mostly
housed at La Libertad, a prison
that a late 1980 International
Red Cross report strongly con
demned for torturing and
"bringing about the physical
and moral breakdown" of its
prisoners
Political activity has been il
legal since 1973, and former po
litical leaders are either exiled
or officially banned from work
ing in politics.
•Paraguay: In 1976, accord
ing to Washington-based ex
perts on Paraguay, the country
had 6000 political prisoners,
some of whom had been held as
long as 19 years without trial.
The number of prisoners is now
about 30, and late last year Par
aguay was taken off the U.N.'s
active list of countries most im
periling human rights. A gener
al loosening of the political
climate — fewer press restric
tions, more church activity in
caring for prisoners and
monitoring human rights —
drew praise for the Paraguayan
government even from groups
such as Amnesty International.
