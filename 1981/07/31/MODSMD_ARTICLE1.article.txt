# Third heart-lung transplant here
## 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
Following a gruelling twelve
hour operation by a team of
three Medical Center doctors
Tuesday, 28-year-old Karen
Wilson has become the third
heart-lung transplant recipient
here within the last five months.
Wilson remains in critical
condition with vital signs stable
and despite the fact that the
surgery took nearly three times
as long as the normal length of
the procedure, the outlook
seems good, said hospital
spokesman Bobbi Navickis.
Drs. Bruce Reitz, Norman
Shumway and John Wallwork
performed the procedure only
recently approved by the FDA
and the Human Subjects Com
mittee at the Center.
Wilson was bom with a heart
condition called transposition of
the great vessels of the heart —
a reversal of the two main arter
ies that enter the heart — which
caused irrevocable damage to
her lungs very early in her life.
She received two major
surgeries when she was two and
23.
The scar tissue from these op
erations caused excessive
bleeding in the Tuesday pro

cedure and resulted in its ex
tended length and difficulty. Al
though SCe surgical team had
planned on a somewhat ex
tended operation, it required
several hours more than antici
pated.
In January the patient had
suffered a cardiac arrest which
greatly limited her activities
and precluded any chance of her
living for more than a few
months. "I wanted the opera
tion because I wanted to lead a
normal life," she said. Wilson
had waited since July 2 for the
operation.
Nurse Patti Tharp, said of her
transplant patients, "They are
really shooting for quality ver
sus quantity of life, and they
know that."
Reitz, who headed the re
search team that investigated
the surgical procedure on
animals such as monkeys, said
that although he has received
hundreds of queries from physi
cians and patients asking to be
considered for the operation, its
experimental nature and the
lack of suitable donors must
limit the number of operations
to four per year at present. The
recipients are therefore chosen
with great care. "It is so hard to
know if someone is ill enough
that he is in his last three to six
months of life," he said.
Mary Gohlke, 45, the first
heart-lung transplant patient at
Stanford, has suffered only mi
nor complications since her
June 1 release from the hospi
tal. Meanwhile Charles Walker,
30, the second recipient, has
been completely free of com
plications.
Wilson said that Walker had
been of iGGense help in re
assuring her before the opera
tion, and that they have become
good friends in that time.
Living in Palo Alto, he will be
able to follow her through her
recovery from her present
critical, carefully guarded con
dition, through the "weaning"
period of self-relief in which she
