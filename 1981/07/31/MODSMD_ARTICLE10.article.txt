# Water pollution regulations struck down
## EPA did not fulfill Congressional intent 
### Washington Post 
Richmond, Va. — A federal
appeals court, in a ruling that
American industries contend
could save them as much as $2
billion, this week struck down
Environmental Protection
Agency regulations governing
the most common forms of wa
ter pollution.
The ruling, in a 2-to-l de
cision, was a major victory for
34 of the nation's largest
chemical and paper manufac
turers, food processors and
trade associations — firms such
as Du Pont, Union Carbide,
Boise Cascade and Proctor &
Gamble. They had sought to re
verse the 1979 EPA regulations
on so-called "conventional pol
lutants" on the grounds the
rules were too costly and unnec
essary.
At issue in the case was
whether the EPA can direct in
dustries to undertake extremely
costly water pollution abate
ment measures instead of less
costly measures that may not be
as effective in protecting the en
vironment. Industry lawyers
contended Congress had wanted
a greater relaxation in regu
lations than the agency was
willing to allow.
The 4th Circuit Court of Ap
peals agreed, saying that the
EPA has issued the water pollu
tion regulations without ade

quately assessing the cost of im
plementing the regulations.
That failure, the court held, was
a violation of 1977 Clean Water
Act.
Unless reversed on appeal,
the ruling means that the EPA
will be forced to redraft the reg
ulations, which were widely ap
plauded by conservationists
when they were issued two
years ago by the Carter admin
istration.
"It's a strong signal to EPA
that the courts will make it fol
low what Congress has told it to
do," said Washington attorney
Henry Diamond. He and other
industry lawyers had argued in
court that the agency and its
former administrator, Douglas
Costle, had ignored Congress's
intent as expressed in the Clean
Water Act.
At issue in the complex legal
dispute was how to control the
thousands of pounds of in
dustrial wastes and byproducts
dumped each year that are not
toxic, but are still dirty enough
to foul the nation's waterways
and kill plant and fishlife.
Prodded by the Water Pollu
tion Control Act of 1972, Con
gress believed industries gener
ally had made considerable
progress in cleaning discharges
of these effluents, which make
up the vast bulk of pollutants.
As a result, Congress

amended the law in 1977 to ease
the federal requirement that
many industries use the "best
available technology" to com
plete their cleanup. In its place,
Congress ordered EPA to for
mulate regulations ordering the
"best conventional technolo
gy," a subtle and, some experts
contend, ambiguous distinction.
EPA argued that the new law
required it only to make certain
private industry would not be
forced to spend more per pound
of pollution for clean-up than
publicly owned sewage treat
ment plants were spending. But
the companies responded,
claiming the EPA should have
taken into account the amounts
companies already had spent on
pollution control.
The dispute was not merely
technical. According to an esti
mate by the American Paper In
stitution, one of 34 parties in the
suit, the industry's cleanup plan
would have cost $200 million to
$300million, while EPA's would
have been $2 billion or more.
