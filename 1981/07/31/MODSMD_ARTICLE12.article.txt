# Judge refuses to postpone trial
## Justice Dept. may drop ATT suit 
### Associated Press 
Washington — The Reagan
administration has decided it
will drop an antitrust suit seek
ing the breakup of American
Telephone & Telegraph Co., the
biggest antitrust suit in the na
tion's history, if Congress ac
cepts a legislative alternative.
The administration suffered
its first setback Wednesday
though, when the federal judge
hearing the suit refused to re

cess the upcoming trial until
June 30, 1982 in order to give
Congress enough time to react.
U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene said the trial would re
sume as scheduled this Aug. 3
with the presentation of AT&T's
defense because "it would be in
appropriate for the court to sus
pend this lawsuit . . . simply be
cause such suspension may have
a political impact in other fo
rums."
The case, one of the most ex
pensive and complicated in his
tory, took six years to prepare
for trial.
Response uncertain
There was no indication how
the Justice Department would
respond to the judge's refusal,
or whether the department
would try to drop the suit and
wait for Congress to act.
Similarly, the scope of Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's role in
fashioning the compromise
within his administrtion and
with AT&T could not be im
mediately learned.
But according to a court tran
script of a surprise closed-door
meeting Wednesday with Judge
Greene, Assistant Attorney
General William Baxter stated:
"I can assure you that I am
speaking not just for the anti
trust division of the Department
of Justice, but for the adminis
tration and the president."
Stunned surprise
Release of the transcript and
its disclosure of the Justice De
partment's reversal on prose
cuting the suit was met with
stunned surprise and vehement
criticism by competitors of
giant AT&T, which serves more
than 80 percent of the nation's

telephones and gets 98 cents of
every dollar spent on long-dis
tance calls.
Government sources who de
manded anonymity also said the
Justice Department's willing
ness to give way to a legislative
solution showed the secretaries
of Commerce and Defense had
prevailed in their fight with the
Justice Department to scuttle
the antitrust suit, filed in 1974.
Political clout
' 'My view is that this develop
ment represents the rather for
midable political clout of AT&T,
which seems to advance its
cause irrespective of its amply
demonstrated violations of the
antitrust laws," said Herbert
Jasper, the executive vice presi
dent of the Ad Hoc Committee
for Competitive Tele
communications, a trade group
representing Bell System com
petitors.
A spokesman for Baxter,
however, told reporters late
Wednesday afternoon that an
amendment drafted for in
clusion in a telephone deregula
tion bill now pending in the Sen
ate "would afford substantially
all of the relief objectives
sought by the government."
Senator Strom Thurmond (R-
S.C.), chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, quickly
announced that he had sched
uled a hearing for Aug. 6 to view
the proposed amendments and
the Justice Department's
motivation for its flip-flop.
AT&T has contended that it
never violated antitrust laws
and that it was being second
guessed on its response to com
petition permitted under recent
regulatory rulings.
