# Inventory to increase 25 percent
## Bookstore to add branch in Palo Alto 
### Karl Schoenberger 
The Stanford Bookstore, a
non-profit corporation inde
pendent of the University, will
venture into free market com
petition by opening a branch
store to sell medical and techni
cal books and office supplies in
downtown Palo Alto early in Au
gust.
The branch store's location at
University Ave. and High St. is
little more than a block away
from Stacey's Bookstore, which
specializes in medical and tech
nical books and devotes more
than half its stock to those
fields.
Law School Prof. Jack
Friedenthal, who heads the
Stanford Bookstore's board of
directors, said that the book
store plans to pay taxes on in
come at the University Ave.
store, and after-tax profits will
be returned to the campus, pos
sibly as rebates to students.

"We have no intention of taking advantage
of our competitors on a tax basis," said
Friedenthal. "That store is not down there to
make a fortune — if's a service to the
community."

Stacey's, which moved to
University Ave. last year after
serving Palo Alto for 30 years at
a smaller store on California
Ave., does not appear overly
concerned about the Stanford
store's potential impact on its
business.
"We view the Stanford move
as healthy competition, and we
will compete," said Gene
Casaretto, group manager for
Stacey's.
Paul Peterson, an original
member of the cooperative of
former Stanford students who

established the Plowshare
Bookstore on University Ave
nue over 10 years ago, said the
Stanford move will have a
positive effect on business,
drawing more book buyers to
the area.
But the Stanford Bookstore's
presence in Palo Alto could hurt
small bookstores in the vicinity
if Stacey's is forced to shy away
from its technical specialization
and increase its concentration
in general reading matter, ac
cording to Peterson.
"If Stacey's does what it says
— not move away from their
technical stock and into trade
books — then there will be no
problem," Peterson said.
The decision Xo move down
town with medical and techni
cal books was made by the
Bookstore board of directors af
ter a year of searching for space
to expand or build anew at the
Medical School, where medical

book sales had long been carried
on in a small, cramped room ad
jacent to the student lounge.
Service there was generally
found to be inadequate.
Space was unavailable at the
Medical Center. But the Book
store was offered an excep
tionally good deal for a newly
constructed building on Univer
sity Ave.
The Halo Alto Weekly re
ported earlier this month that
one of the building's two owners
offered to sell his share to the
Bookstore.
The Bookstore, for the time
being, is renting the entire
building and plans to sublet the
top floor as commercial office
space. As for negotiations to buy
part of the building, Friedenthal
said that "our plans are not defi
nite at this time."

Medical students may suffer
a financial sting as a result of
the move, with the off-campus
sale of medical textbooks com
plicating, if not precluding the
rebates they would enjoy if the
books were sold on the non-prof
it basis of the Bookstore's cam
pus operations.
"We haven't decided how
we're going to handle it yet, but
we're trying to work out a sys
tem where we can sell medical
textbooks on campus,'' Frieden
thal said.
Arturo Molina, President of
the Stanford Medical Student
Association, said the new loca
tion may prove to be inconve
nient to some students, but
"won't be that bad.
"Hopefully we'll be able to
devise some benefit from the
move and the negative effects
will be minimal," he said.
The Medical Student Associa
tion hopes to use the old medical
bookstore as a resource center
for advising new students, ac
cording to Molina.
