# Reconstruction to be finished spring 1982
## 
### Sarah Noss 
Renovation of Storey House
will be completed by spring
quarter of 1982, two years after
a fire destroyed the third floor
of the all-female residence.
Renovation of the gutted
Storey House posed unexpected
reconstruction difficulties. The
outside facade of the original
building still exists, but a steel
frame is inside the wooden
shell.
"When we stripped the
plaster to examine the integrity
of the structure, we discovered
some faults," said Ed Scoles, di
rector of Housing and Food Ser
vices. "We examined the foun
dations and found that they
were totally inadequate for a
modern structure. Essentially,
the building was totally re
built," he said.
Storey House was built about
1905, and the last time it was re
modeled was in 1938. Re
construction after the fire has
been delayed because of some
other structural problems found
after the fire.
"The foundations weren't af
fected by the fire, but what with
today's earthquake laws, and
what with putting a new struc
ture on top of them, they had to
be fixed," said Sigrid Lorenzen
Rupp, architect of the project.
"We also found that the back
part of the second floor was a
sun deck that someone had built
rooms on to. Those walls were
structurally unsound," she said.
The history of Storey House is
largely unknown. Neither
floorplans of the building nor in

formation regarding whoever
built on the second story rooms
have been found.
These structural deficiencies
have added to the cost of the
project. The University ori
ginally budgeted $1,258,000 for
the Storey House reconstruc
tion. Now the structural repairs
have raised the costs to
$1,320,000, said Rupp.
Rupp wanted to design a
"liveable place. I hated dorms. I
wanted to make it into a place
where I would want to live. I
wanted to give it some life,
some splashes of color — no in
stitutional tans or hospital
greens. It's going to be the way I
liked to live when I was a stu
dent," she said.
According to Rupp. the rooms
will be along the outer walls of
the building to utilize the large
windows and natural lighting. It
will house 42 people. All of the
rooms, except for two singles,
will be doubles.
Storey House's proximity to
campus makes it a desirable
place to live for the handi
capped. Two double rooms
downstairs will be completely
accessible by wheelchair. And a
ramp in the back that will make
the house easily accessible from
the parking lot.
Unlike the old building, the
new house will have an enclosed
fire staircase on the side facing
the Sigma Chi house.
New wiring, electrical outlets
every 18 inches, a sprinkler sys
tem and smoke detectors will be
added throughout the house.
The best room of the house

will be the one that contains
nothing but a skylight and a
bathtub, said Rupp. "You can
get a lot of work done in there. I
used to read Winston Churchill
in the tub when I was in school
because I knew if I fell asleep I'd
drown," she said.
Each floor has two separate
bath and toilet facilities so that
the house can be used as a room
to-room coeducational dorm.
Whether or not Storey House
will continue to be an all-wom
en's dorm is sure to cause some

controversy. According to
Diana Conklin, director of the
Row, the decision will be made
this fall. About 80 percent of the
undergraduates here live in Uni
versity housing, so the demand
to live on campus is great.
But many former Storey resi
dents think that it should remain
a women's dorm. "It's an op
portunity lots of people want,"
said Gaby Willard, who lived in
Storey the year of the fire.
"Almost everyone I've talked to
thinks that it should be an all
women's dorm. So do the

fraternities next door."
"Every time I look at Storey
House it brings a tear to my eye.
I'm very emotional about it,"
said Susie Paz. The fire that de
stroyed the third floor of Storey
House in March, 1980 started
in her room.
"I always think about the fire.
When I close my eyes and think
about it I can see it and hear the
drills; I can't look at it now
without thinking of the fire,"
she said. "I wish they would
tear the whole thing down and
start anew."

portunity lots of people want,"
said Gaby Willard, who lived in
Storey the year of the fire.
"Almost everyone I've talked to
thinks that it should be an all
women's dorm. So do the

fraternities next door."
"Every time I look at Storey
House it brings a tear to my eye.
I'm very emotional about it,"
said Susie Paz. The fire that de
stroyed the third floor of Storey
House in March, 1980 started
in her room.
"I always think about the fire.
When I close my eyes and think
about it I can see it and hear the
drills; I can't look at it now
without thinking of the fire,"
she said. "I wish they would
tear the whole thing down and
start anew."
Renovation of Storey House
will be completed by spring
quarter of 1982, two years after
a fire destroyed the third floor
of the all-female residence.
Renovation of the gutted
Storey House posed unexpected
reconstruction difficulties. The
outside facade of the original
building still exists, but a steel
frame is inside the wooden
shell.
"When we stripped the
plaster to examine the integrity
of the structure, we discovered
some faults," said Ed Scoles, di
rector of Housing and Food Ser
vices. "We examined the foun
dations and found that they
were totally inadequate for a
modern structure. Essentially,
the building was totally re
built," he said.
Storey House was built about
1905, and the last time it was re
modeled was in 1938. Re
construction after the fire has
been delayed because of some
other structural problems found
after the fire.
"The foundations weren't af
fected by the fire, but what with
today's earthquake laws, and
what with putting a new struc
ture on top of them, they had to
be fixed," said Sigrid Lorenzen
Rupp, architect of the project.
"We also found that the back
part of the second floor was a
sun deck that someone had built
rooms on to. Those walls were
structurally unsound," she said.
The history of Storey House is
largely unknown. Neither
floorplans of the building nor in

formation regarding whoever
built on the second story rooms
have been found.
These structural deficiencies
have added to the cost of the
project. The University ori
ginally budgeted $1,258,000 for
the Storey House reconstruc
tion. Now the structural repairs
have raised the costs to
$1,320,000, said Rupp.
Rupp wanted to design a
"liveable place. I hated dorms. I
wanted to make it into a place
where I would want to live. I
wanted to give it some life,
some splashes of color — no in
stitutional tans or hospital
greens. It's going to be the way I
liked to live when I was a stu
dent," she said.
According to Rupp. the rooms
will be along the outer walls of
the building to utilize the large
windows and natural lighting. It
will house 42 people. All of the
rooms, except for two singles,
will be doubles.
Storey House's proximity to
campus makes it a desirable
place to live for the handi
capped. Two double rooms
downstairs will be completely
accessible by wheelchair. And a
ramp in the back that will make
the house easily accessible from
the parking lot.
Unlike the old building, the
new house will have an enclosed
fire staircase on the side facing
the Sigma Chi house.
New wiring, electrical outlets
every 18 inches, a sprinkler sys
tem and smoke detectors will be
added throughout the house.
The best room of the house

will be the one that contains
nothing but a skylight and a
bathtub, said Rupp. "You can
get a lot of work done in there. I
used to read Winston Churchill
in the tub when I was in school
because I knew if I fell asleep I'd
drown," she said.
Each floor has two separate
bath and toilet facilities so that
the house can be used as a room
to-room coeducational dorm.
Whether or not Storey House
will continue to be an all-wom
en's dorm is sure to cause some

controversy. According to
Diana Conklin, director of the
Row, the decision will be made
this fall. About 80 percent of the
undergraduates here live in Uni
versity housing, so the demand
to live on campus is great.
But many former Storey resi
dents think that it should remain
a women's dorm. "It's an op
portunity lots of people want,"
said Gaby Willard, who lived in
Storey the year of the fire.
"Almost everyone I've talked to
thinks that it should be an all
women's dorm. So do the

fraternities next door."
