# Integrated systems
## Companies finance new center 
### Gabe Newell 
The Stanford Board of
Trustees voted at their June
meeting to house the new Center
for Integrated Systems (CIS) in
Ventura Hall.
The Center has completed
fund raising plans by receiving
gifts and pledges of $9 million
from 12 companies.
The companies, including
General Electric, Fairchild,
Hewlett-Packard, Honeywell,
IBM, Northrop, Tektronix, Tex
as Instruments, TRW, Xerox,
Digital Equipment Corp., and
ITT, are leading high technolo
gy firms intensely interested in
ClS's focus of research — design
and development of miniature
silicon chips used in digital and
analog equipment.
The University and the corpo

rate sponsors look to the Center
to accelerate the electronics
technology revolution and to se
cure U.S. leadership in the field.
The Center aims to increase
dramatically the complexity of
miniature silicon chip circuitry,

The Center is "a new coupling of integrated
circuit people and computer systems people,
which should produce systems that could not
have been conceived by one or the other
alone."
— John Linvill

to design the software needed to
program, utilize the new
circuits and to turn out gradu
ates (100 Masters and 30 Ph.D.s
per year) able to design radical
ly new commuication and com
putational systems using such
circuitry.
Research for the Center is
scattered around campus. When
it is consolidated at Ventura,
the Center will begin to take on a
distinct form and purpose. It is
intended that the corporate
sponsors will play a prominent
role in ensuring that the goals of
the Center be carried out.
According to John Linvill,
professor of integrated systems
and the Center's director, the
Center is "a new coupling of in
tegrated circuit people and
computer systems people,
which should produce systems
that could not have been con
ceived by one or the other
alone."
Recent fund-raising will go
toward construction of the first

phase of ClS's laboratories and
to payment for facilities for the
Center's computer-managed
"fast turnaround facility." This
facility will allow computer and
information systems theorists
to send via the computer opera-

tional models of what they want
to integrated circuits special
ists, who will turn these models
into circuit designs, and then
through computer automated
lines into hardware.

ence's Heuristic Programming
Project, Artificial Intelligence
Lab and Very Large Scale Inte
gration Theory Group, and Ap
plied Physics Department's
Ginzton Lab will all be involved
with CIS, once it is in full swing.
The Center began formal op
erations in temporary quarters
in February 1981. Linvill, on
leave until mid-August, is Di
rector of Industrial Program
ming. and Dr. James Meindl
will be in charge of the CIS labo
ratories.
