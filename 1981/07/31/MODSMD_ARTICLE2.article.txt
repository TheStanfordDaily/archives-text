Ground spraying witn
diazinon in the far south
western, residential faculty sec
tion could begin within a week,
Mediterranean fruit fly project
official Annie Zeller said yester
day.
Zeller said that because of a
Medfly larval infestation at the
843 Alardice Way residence con
firmed on July 22, ground ap
plication of the class II pesticide
would be conducted throughout
the residence's own block and a
two-block radius surrounding
the larval find. Zeller pointed
out that no ground spraying has
been carried out.
Once begun, ground applica
tion will be repeated a total of
three times at 14 to 16 day in
tervals. The specific starting
date will be determined by the
length of time it takes Medfly
project stripping crews that are
now combing the area to clear
leftover fruit.
On another front in the battle
against the Medfly in the Uni
versity area, Project Spokes
man Bill Pope said yesterday
that the next round of aerial
spraying for corridor six, which
includes the University, will be
gin on Tuesday morning at 12:01
a.m.
In an additional incident in
volving the controversial aerial
spraying, the city of Cupertino
received numerous phone calls
from citizens claiming that they
had been sprayed with an un
scheduled dose of malathion.
City of Cupertino Medfly Co
ordinator Barbara Brown said
yesterday, "We believe that an
area (bounded by Highway 289,
Bubb Rd., and Pierce Rd.) was
sprayed that was not supposed
to be sprayed. People were an
gered because they couldn't
take the usual safety meas
ures."
Brown said that the city of
Cupertino repprted the com
plaints to the Medfly project as
soon as they received the com
plaints. The area was scheduled
to be sprayed next Wednesday.
Jim Josephson, owner of Joa

quin Helicopters, Inc., the com
pany contracted for aerial
spraying, denied the allegations
that the helicopters had over
sprayed the zone they were
working on. He also said that
residents may have confused
the exhaust of the helicopters as
being raalathion.
However, Brown said, "I
don't think there is any question
. . . that there was accidental
spraying. They were spraying
three miles from where they
were supposed to be."
