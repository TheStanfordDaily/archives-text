## KMT hoax 
### 
We, a group of Chinese stu
dents from Taiwan at Stanford,
are writing to protest an ad
vertisement which ran on page 9
(Daily, July 24). The ad.entitled
"Stop KMT agents on Our Cam
pus," was sponsored by the For
mosan Association for Human
Rights. The organization is
identified only by a post office
box number in San Jose.
For the benefit of readers, we
would like to call your attention
to several features of the ad.
(1) The ad was placed by a
non-Stanford source and is not
sponsored by any of the Chinese
communities at Stanford.
(2> The ad appears to have as
its chief motive to create an at
mosphere of suspicion and to
show discord among Chinese
students, which they may capi
talize on.
(3) This ad, which we feel
takes advantage of the limited
knowledge of our country by the
local community, provides
readers with well-edited
"facts" spiced with emotion
charged appeals in the form of
undocumented and unsubstan
tiated innuendo. Moreover it
contains no evidence of wrong
doing by the government. It at
tempts to conjure up an image
of a Chinese secret police state,
which is contrary to our knowl
edge of our government and to
our knowledge of the two cases
cited.
All of us come to Stanford to
pursue our education, not to
cause political disturbances.
We are disgusted with any at
tempt to introduce factional
strifes into our community
which has been proud of its
homogeneity. In the meantime,
we have never experienced or
heard about any harassment or
intimidation from our fellow
Chinese.
The reign of terror which
the ad claims rules the Chinese
community on campus is simply
beyond our imagination. In fact
we are the victims of a
witchhunting campaign in
vented by the ad rather than the
victims of the fictitious KMT
scare.
We ask the Stanford com

munity not to be misled by this
ad, by this campaign to dis
credit the local Chinese com
munity. We strongly advise that
readers consult unbiased
sources. We invite you to dis
cuss the issues with the mem
bers of our community.

Mellow and gnarly
Thank you, Nancy Frank.
Finally, after years of believing
that the only people who said
"get mellow" were trans
planted New Yorkers who got
ulcers worrying about whether
the "in thing" next year would
be est or rolfing, someone has
shown me the light. Suddenly I
realize that too much sunlight
has addled my brain to the point
where it's obvious to certain ad
vantaged New Yorkers that I'm
incapable of higher thought
processes, such as disco danc
ing and fucking.
And gee whiz, why can't us
Californians ever think of any
thing as dehumanizing civilized
as a good pick-up-line? It sure is
nice to know that native New
Yorkers are here for the sum
mer to tell us how unintellectual
the California winters, that
they've never experienced, are.
I mean like hey, wouldn't
Western Civilization be really
gnarly if Plato and Aristotle,
and the rest of the locals hadn't
had to live through all those cold
winters in Poughkeepsie?
It's hard to understand how
after 20 years as the most
populous state in the nation,
California still hasn't realized
that New York is the center of
the world. Nancy, I'm sorry
about all this provincialism In
the future though, when you at
tack a group's intelligence it
would be best if, just for form's
sake, you got your subject-verb
agreement right. I do hope this
letter hasn't been too mellow
for you.
