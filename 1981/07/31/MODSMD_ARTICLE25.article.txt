## Court's caprice alienates voters 
### 
Voting and participating in the political process
are fundamental rights guaranteed by our Con
stitution. But in recent years, more and more
Americans have been forfeiting that right and sit
ting out the elections. Indeed, statistics show that
in 1960 over 62 percent of the electorate voted in
the presidential election while in 1980 that figure
slipped to a little over 50 percent. Why over the
past 20 years are more Americans deserting the
political process?
Many experts argue that the registration laws
surrounding voting are primarily responsible for
this decline. Such laws, they contend, make it too
cumbersome for people to go out and vote. But the
registration laws of today are far more liberal
than they were 20 years ago. Indeed, the voting
rights act of 1965 outlawed any type of voting dis
crimination.
I think the reason behind this decline in political
participation is to be found among our institu
tions, not among registration laws. The Congress,
the Presidency, and particularly the Supreme
Court are all guilty of alienating and misrepresen
ting the views of the American people. The situ
ation today is worse than it was 20 years ago. A
few examples will illustrate my point.
America is basically a religious society with
deep religious* convictions. But a few years ago
the Warren Court outlawed prayer in the public
schools Likewise, today's Supreme Court will
probably declare unconstitutional even a non-de
nominational moment of silence in the classroom.
By interpreting the separation of church and
state clause in the Constitution in a certain way,
the Supreme Court has said in effect that it pre
fers non-religion. And where does this leave a ma
jority of Americans who hold religious beliefs?
The Court has also taken a similar stand on
forced busing. A vast majority of both whites and
blacks are opposed to court ordered busing. But

this hasn't stopped the Supreme Court from up
holding busing laws in various communities, no
matter how unpopular they happen to be.
The Supreme Court, however, is not the only
culprit alienating the American people. Political
leaders have made their contributions as well.
For example, former United States Senators
George McGovern of South Dakota and Birch
Bayh of Indiana campaigned in 1974 for fiscal con
servatism in their re-election bids. They ap
parently saw how that strategy worked for Rich
ard Nixon in his landslide victory in 1972.
But the voter was left in a vacuum in trying to
understand why McGovern's and Bayh's voting
record in the Senate did not reflect their cam
paign promises for fiscal restraint. Such an act of
duplicity fooled the voters in 1974 but not in 1980.
It is not difficult to see why many Americans
are cynical of the political process. Obviously
there are not clear-cut solutions to these prob
lems. But we can start with some generalizations
and work from there.
The Justices who serve on the Supreme Court
must be made to realize that their views are not
always in the best interests of the American peo
ple. But the Court has the luxury of not having to
answer to any constituency, and perhaps that's its
problem.
Likewise, the implications of political leaders
promising what they do not deliver is equally
alarming. True, the voters ultimately have the op
tion of voting out of office political leaders who do
not live up to their campaign promises. But the
point is they shouldn't have to. If Justices and po
litical leaders begin to respond to the estrange
ment felt by the electorate, then it might be pos
sible to reverse the ominous trend toward politi
cal apathy to one of political efficacy.
