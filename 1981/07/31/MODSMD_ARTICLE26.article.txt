## Mark Zeigler His baseball bat is just firewood 
### 
The yellow brim of my A's
cap is now almost beige, the
once bright color tarnished by a
dormant dust. My bats rest
peacefully like firewood in the
garage. The sporting page is
thin; my wallet is thick with un
spent money.
But the curious thing of it is
that my digital watch reads July
30, 1981.
The scary thing is that it's
correct.
For 42 days, 580 games, and
who knows how many potential
innings, Major League Baseball
junkies, and the American pub
lic have been showing signs of
withdrawal; or have they?
If the majority of baseball
lovers are of the same per
suasion as this author, they
would jiE6 as soon biLH their
bats, read scrawny excuses for
sports pages, allow their hats to

turn grey, and watch their
wallets become over populated
with dollar bills than attend a
strike-scarred hardball contest.
Baseball players are paid
money for their athletic en
deavors. They have just as
much right to strike as an air
controller or a postal worker.
However, a players strike ac
complishes virtually nothing.
They are not asking for a pay
raise or for increased medical
benefits. The issue at hand is the
amount and method of com
pensation, if any, that should be
awarded to a team losing a top
player to free agency.
Those involved must first re
alize that the real loser during a
strike of this sort is the fan. And
let's not forget the currently un
employed vendor who has noth
ing to show but peanuts come
the tax season.
Nevertheless, the entire
blame for such unfortunate ri
diculousness should not be
placed on either the players or
the owners. One entity is also at
fault for eight weeks and count
ing of baseball-less summer:

money.
Since the major leagues, each
with two divisions, the world of
baseball has gradually suc
cumbed to the devilish power of
gold and all the greed, self
ishness, and singlemindedness
that accompanies it.
Major League Baseball is no
longer a "world" inside the uni
verse of sport; it is an institu
tion monopolized by the
monster of professional sport
which feeds on crisp dollar bills
sprinkled with corruption and
non-competitiveness.
Even if baseball bigwigs
solve their so-called current
crisis, they will have much
more important matters on
their hands.
Some will call these past few
months without baseball the
summer that wasn't. But others
will remember it as the summer
that was — was without the
putrid stench of rotting apples
in America's favorite pie.
