## Soviets run doctors through kangaroo court 
### 
In one of the worst periods of
repression since Stalin's death
in 1953, the Soviet Union has
moved in recent months to put
an end to the last remnants of
the Soviet dissident movement.
The target of the latest
crackdown has been the Work
ing Commission to Investigate
the Use of Psychiatry for Politi
cal Purposes, a group that was
formed in January 1977 as an
outgrowth of the dissident panel
that had been monitoring Soviet
compliance with the human
rights provisions of the Helsinki
Accords. The psychiatric com
mission was established to
document the use of Soviet psy
chiatric hospitals as a means of

suppressing political dissent.
Seven members of the psy
chiatric commission —
Viacheslav Bakhmin, Irina
Grivnina, Anatoly Koryagin,
Aleksandr Lavut, Aleksandr
Podrabinek, Feliks Serebrov,
and Leonid Ternovsky — re
ceived sentences ranging from
three to 12 years in labor camps
and internal exile.
The seven were convicted on
charges of "anti-Soviet agita
tion and propaganda," but it is
clear that their only true
"crimes" were to demand
greater freedom and an end to
psychiatric abuse.
The psychiatric commission

had compiled detailed reports
on the workings of the Special
Psychiatric Hospitals scattered
throughout the Soviet Union,
and it was these reports that had
aroused the deep hostility of of
ficials in Moscow.
One of the defendants,
Aleksandr Podrabinek, had put
together an entire book expos
ing Soviet psychiatric abuses.
Although the manuscript of the
book was confiscated by KGB
agents in late 1977, it was later
circulated through the samizdat
and was published in the United
States last year.
In the book, appropriately en
titled Punitive Medicine,
Podrabinek meticulously de

scribes the practice of psy
chiatric terror — the mental
and physical torture. He also
provides a "white list" naming
200 psychiatric victims and a
"black list" naming 100 state
physicians responsible for the
abuses.
The allegations raised by
Podrabinek, which have been
confirmed by sources in the So
viet Union as well as by Soviet
psychiatrists who have emi
grated or fled to the West, in
duced the World Psychiatric As
sociation to condemn the "sys
tematic abuse of psychiatry for
political purposes in the Soviet
Union."

Official Kremlin spokesmen
have generally denied the
charges, attributing them to
"antipsychiatric and antisocial
elements." However, the chief
neuropsychiatrist at the Soviet
Ministry of Health, Dr. Zoya
Serebryakova, recently ac
knowledged that a certain
number of patients each year at
Soviet psychiatric hospitals are
admitted in connection with
"slanderous statements" and
"groundless complaints." Ap
parently, Serebryakova saw
nothing unusual or wrong about
the practice.
The trials of the seven dissi
dents were little more than a
mockery. As is so often the case
in the Soviet judicial system,
the guilty verdicts were a fore
gone conclusion.
The trials were conducted at
a court in the outer suburbs of
Moscow, apparently to dis
courage Western correspon
dents and friends of the defen
dants from attending. Defense
attorneys were not appointed
until the day the trials started.
Now that the seven members
of the psychiatric commission
have been convicted, the author
ities in Moscow have virtually
completed their brutal, four
year campaign to eliminate po
litical and religious dissent. Ev
ery major Soviet dissident —
Sakharov, Shcharansky, Nudel,
Orlove, and hundreds of others
— is now either in prison or in
forced exile.
Nevertheless, although these
courageous men and women
have been temporarily silenced,
they and their cause will never
be forgotten.
