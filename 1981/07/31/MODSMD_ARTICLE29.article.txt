## Pray that your spread always says 'butter!' 
### 
It was an ordinary day. It was
an ordinary Safeway. It was the
kind of day you just wanted to
drive the Chevy down to the
neighborhood grocery for a few
Oscar Meyer hot dogs and a
Mrs. Smith's uncooked apple
pie. But something was amiss. I
could feel it in the air.
Maybe I forgot to wash the
floors with extra strength Pine
Sol that cleans and disinfects
better than any other leading
cleaner. I ignored my intuition
and pushed on. Before the end of
this fateful day, I would lose
sight of reality and my world
would begin to crumble.
Just a 14-ounce box of Carna
tion powdered milk, that's all I
needed to complete my shop
ping list. Was it near the Lipton
Tea or the Folger's Mountain
Grown Coffee? No. Near the
Drano, which won't let you hurt
your pipes, or the Mop and Glo,
or the Endust, for a beautiful
shine you can truly see?
No. I stumbled, eyes
bloodshot, through the endless
stream of familiar friends;
Chuck Wagon, the dog food so

crunchy you can cut it with a
fork, and Parkay, the
margarine that says "butter." I
felt at home.
Then, quickly, the store had
sucked me in and trapped me in
a world of blue and white wrap
pers. An entire aisle sucked me
in; I was the only witness to the
overrun of generics into my life.
It was alien, I knew it was.
I felt lost and alone in that ge
neric aisle. Could 1 reach for a
Kleenex? No, I had to reach for
a facial tissue. Chapstick? No, I
had to grasp for a methylpara
been-based lip balm. My God, I
couldn't even make a Xerox
copy of my grocery list in this
forsaken segment of the uni
verse; I had to make an elec
trostatic photocopy. I needed a
fix, I needed relief; I needed an
Oreo, not a chocolate creme
filled cookie.
I needed a toothpaste with
paste for my teeth and gel with
real mouthwash for fresh
breath, not a dull looking box
with flouride scrawled across
the front in blue letters. This
was death, this was the end, and

not even a roll of Charmin to
cling to.
In this place of despair and
low prices my dishes wouldn't
shine so that I could see myself,
my glasses wouldn't be so spot
free that I wouldn't have to
worry, and my yogurt wouldn't
make my polyglot!
I missed the Windex shine,
the Tidy Bowl man, and the
noisiest Chips in the world.
I couldn't worry about wait
ing for my laxative to work,
hemorrhoids, or even embar
rassing age spots. Wow, I
couldn't even get a nagging
backache from overexertion or
everyday stress and strain,
I was getting an Excedrin
headache. I was going to take
three, Anacine Three, but then
my stomach flared up. I needed
the plop, plop, fizz, fizz or even
something tht absorbs 47 times
its weight in excess acid. Tum
tum-tum-tums. All I could
find was a light blue box with
anti-f latuent antacid
emblazoned on the front in dull
white lettering.
That's it! Martini and Rossi

on the Flocks. Say Yes! No, I
could have had a V-8. That's no
downstream tomato juice,
Was there no mercy? Coke
drifted into Cola. Pringles
into fried potato crisps.
It was too much to bear. I
crawled to the end of the aisle
where there was no yellow waxy
build up and a mouthwash that
kills germs as it freshens breath
triumphed over the racks.
My Gladwrap dinged again. I
was Sure of my deodorant.
I grabbed a Certs in a
catatonic state of shock. I felt
the drop of Retsyn pulse into
my veins. I was home.
