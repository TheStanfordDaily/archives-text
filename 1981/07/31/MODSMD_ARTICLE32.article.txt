The Graduate School of Busi
ness Lounge was forceably en
tered through tiles in the ceiling
Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., ac
cording to a student manager.
One thousand dollars in cash,
equivalent to a day's receipts,
was taken.
Police responded to the silent
alarm in the building but the
robber had left.
According to the student man
ager, someone familiar with the
area must have committed the
crime. He added that about one
robbery takes place in the

lounge each year, usually dur
ing the summer.
In addition, two arson at
tempts were made early this
week.
According to Stanford fire de
partment battalion chief Don
Shaw, a man was arrested and
charged with two arson at
tempts on July 24.
A witness saw the man set
fire to grass at the intersection
of Serra and El Camino. The
arsonist repeated the act about
50 yards down the road, said
Shaw.
