Butch Casxidy and the Sun
dance Kid **"*
Fox, Redwood City
This movie now seems a little
dated by the slackness of Us love
story and by the inclusion of some
double-yechy Burt Bacharach
tunes. But BCatS K manages to be
exceedingly entertaining all the
same. William Goldman's script
gives Paul Newman and Robert
Redford some pretty funny things
to say to each other. Director
George Roy HUI keeps the action
moving along briskly, for once.
And the ending, although certainly
not precedent-shattering, is
agreeably, almost heroically, anti
heroic.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
The Sting

Etcape from \eir York ***★
Belmont Theater, Belmont
The year ia 1987; Manhattan Is
land has been walled off to form a
maximum security prison. Once a
person Is sent in, there Is no way
out — those who don't like the idea
of living out their lives in the pris
on may opt for execution and imm
mediate cremation on the pre
mises. Inside, the island has
turned Into a nightmare world, in
habited above and below by
creatures out of bad dreams-
From the time the title credits
fade to the «>ll of the end credits.
Escape from New York offers vir
tually unrelenting excitement. Di
rector John Carpenter (who
directed' HMbumgn, the first and
far and away the best of the cur
rent horror movie cycle) takes his
lightweight plot and fills it to the
bursting point with striking im
ages and setpieces of suspense.

Electric Harteman ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Almost constructed as the vis
ual equivalent of a Willie Nelson
song. The fact that Nelson is one of
toe co-stars only enhances the
warm, nearly uneventful, yet
somehow quietly thoughtful feel
ing of this Robert Redford-Jane
Fonda star vehicle. The per
formances. especially Redford's.
are fine. Sidney Pollack's direc
tion is, thankfully, economical,
and the movie ultimately wins you
over by voiding overt messages
and, in spite of its pre-fab ele
ments, maintaining its charm and
good nature throughout.
Plays Saturday only with 9 to 5.

Raidert of the Lout Ark *
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts of
some of the most gifted craftsmen
in Hollywood: Steven Spielberg
i'Jowfi) directed; George Lucas
(Star Wars I and Philip Kaufman
(Invasion of the Body Snatchers)

wrote the script. It has been ac
claimed by the overwhelming ma
jority of critics as a cliff-hanger
classic. But I must confess to a
traitorous resistance to all those
good vibrations: I didn't care for
the movie very much. Raiders
achieves a weird balance: it's ex
citing on the surface but dull at its
. colter. For all the hype about its
adolescent boys' tale spirit, I could
discern none of it. Raiders was
made in acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

The Empire Strikes Back **
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even
, more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most of its sense of humor. Ev
erything has become deadly seri
ous—bigger, brighter, splashier,
and dull.
All the old performers are back,
but the best performance is given
by a green-skinned muppet
creature that, for an instant, man
ages to instill a sense of magic and
expectation. The biggest letdown
of all is the movie's ending—
jeepers, George, couldn't you
come up with something better
than that after three years of
work?

For Your Eyes Only
Palo Alto Square
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal. It's
not as bloated as the last Bond ex
travaganza (Moonraker) and it's
perhaps the least sadistic of any
Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to be
growing tired of the role (or per
haps he's merely stopped trying:
the producers plan to replace him
with a younger model soon). He
perks up momentarily — as does
the movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the rest
of the film. For Your Eyes Only
might have passed for entertain
ment instead of an exercise in
cinematic stasis.

Altered Statet *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
eo Looney Tune. It's brightly col
ored, wonderfully noisy, and utter
ly vacuous.
Ken Russell < Women in Love,
Tommy) directed; Paddy
Chayefsky (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance; from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at ail.
Plays tonight only with The
Shining.

Being There *++*
Fox, Redwood City
Hal Ashby (Coming Hume,
Hound for Glory) directed this af
fecting, gentle satire about a man
whose innocence becomes a valu
able commodity. The late Peter
Sellers plays Chance the gar
dener, this may have been his best
performance since his portrayal of
Quilty in Kubrick's Lnlita.
Being There is so tied to
Chance's deadpan, sim
plemindedly literal world-view
that the audience leaves the thea
ter a little dazed — our thought
processes have begun to slow and
stretch to match his. Shirley
MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas
(who won an academy award for
his efforts) turn in fine supporting
characterizations.
Plays tonight only with
Network.

9 to 5 *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.
Plays Saturday only with The
Electric Horseman.
— Steve Vineberg

The Shining *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick s adaptation of
the Stephen King novel supplies
neither the promised shocks
(about the best he can muster is a
cackling corpse in a bathtub) nor
hinted-at depths in character
ization Jack Nicholson gleefully
overplays his role as mad
man/father to telepathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife
wielding hysteria by it all is moth
er Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most interesting per
formance — she has a capacity for
expressing emotional aridness
thct a better movie might have
used to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular v
Plays tonight only with Altered
States.

This sequel may disappoint
those who adrrured the myth-es
tablishing prologue of I;
it will usually delight those who
found the original's smart-alecky
second half more appealing. Rich
ard Lester (A <! >■■>{ Day ;< A
The Throe Muskctc&Bj directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
book punch that moves It along as
speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
peats his roie as the man of steel;
Margot Kidder is. once again, a
sassy, sexy Lois Lane.
