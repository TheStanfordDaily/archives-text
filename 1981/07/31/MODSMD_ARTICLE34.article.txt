# 'Children of Lesser God' opens up the world of the deaf
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Mark Medoff's play Children
of a Lesser God opens up anoth
er world for us — the world of
the deaf — and for that reason
alone it is worth seeing. It is a
play about two different and in
compatible cultures, the hear
ing world and the deaf world
each trying to shape the other in
its own image with the hearing
world winning out.
At the core the play is a love
story between a speech teacher
at a state school for the deaf and
his angry young student, Sarah
— played by Linda Bove who
was the understudy for the ori
ginal Broadway production —
who refuses to learn the hearing
world's language.
The first half of the play is a
rather conventional love story
with unconventional problems
— something you would expect
to see as a movie of the week on
CBS. There is the obstinate and
proud Sarah, a deaf woman
from birth who was dismissed
until the age of twelve as men
tally retarded both by her moth
er and her doctors, and there is
her teacher, the Jewish-well
meaning-liberal James Leeds,
played in this production by
Broadway actor Peter Evans,
who falls in love with her pre
cisely because of her re
sistance.
There are the usual sorts of

ENTERTAINMENT

obstacles that their love has to
overcome — the fact that a rela
tionship between a student and a
teacher is scarcely tolerated by
the school principal as well as
the obstacle of the handicap
itself.
Sarah presents a challenge
for James. She is not his usual
eager student, epitmomized by
Lydia who hangs on James' ev
ery word figuratively as well as
literally — Lydia watches him
intently as he teaches her to pro
nounce difficult words and her
eyes are full of devotion. In fact,
Sarah fears that kind of depen
dence.
Sarah prefers to live in her
private world She doesn't mind
being a maid even with her supe
rior intelligence, "I like work
ing alone," she signs, "in my si
lence." James manages to
change that attitude — they
marry at the end of the first act
— but he never succeeds in per

suading her to learn how to read
lips and become a part of the
hearing world. This is where the
CBS movie leaves off and dra
matic development begins.
Obvious comparisons — at
least for the first act — with
Broadway productions with the
same flavor come to mind such
as The Shadow Box, for which
Gordon Davidson.the director
of this touring production of
Children, won a Tony award,
and The Elephant Man. The
Shadou: Box, a play about dying
cancer patients with its Marcus
Welby M L), overtones, shares
the same melodrama, while
Elephant Man questions the
honesty of motivation of those
that are so eager to help the
"handicapped."
The second act deals with the
struggle between James and
Sarah to make the marriage
work. As Peter Evans told me
when I spoke with him one after
noon last week in the empty
Geary theatre "they try to
make their mate fit their im
age." James never stops trying
to persuade Sarah to learn how
to speak, and she never stops us
ing him as her translator, her
mouthpiece and her only link to
the hearing world. "She wants
him to be her independence,"
Evans explained.
As Sarah gains her independ
ence through her marriage and

confidence grows, she demands
more and more. Sarah gets in
volved in a grievance complaint
against the school — the charge
is that the school is discriminta
ing in its hiring policies against
deaf teachers — and she relies
on James to communicate her
bitterness for the hearing world
for her, "I can't say what I feel
about being deaf through a hear
ing person," she finally signs to
James knowing that it will hurt.
The irony of Sarah's position
is that she has to rely on James
to articulate even this bitter
plea for independence. She com
plains of being spoken about in
the third person: she says, she
meant, she wants, "as if there
were no I. As if there were no
one in here that could under
stand," but she cannot ignore
James as an individual either.
The point Medoff makes that
sticks most in your mind when
one walks away from Children

of a Lesser God is that deaf peo
ple have to speak for themselves
and cannot rely on us hearing
people to do it for them. But
Medoff does speak for them and
it isn't clear just how authentic
his portrayal of the world of the
deaf is. But perhaps that is not a
handicap, after all some of the
best insights into the rela
tionship between the sexes have
been made by writers of the
homosexual persuasion.
Medoff, who got his M.A. in
English here, decided to write
the play in 1977 after meeting
the wife of scenic designer Bob
Steinberg who, himself a hear
ing person was nevertheless in
on the beginings of National
Theatre for the Deaf where he
fell in love with one of the ac
tresses, Phyllis Frelich.
Medoff says that he decided
to write the play not because "I
want to 'save' the deaf and earn
the undying gratitude of one of
the last available minor
ities 'but because there are no
parts in "hearing'' theatre for
deaf actors and because he
found both Steinberg and
Frelich "irresistable."
Still, the play smacks of more
then a love story — there are
those political undertones which
make you feel that a statement
is intended although everything
is left very ambiguous, includ
ing the ending.

It is a pity that the political
angle is not explored in a more
subtle way. Orin — played by
Richard Kendall — the militant
organizer who wants to start a
revolution against hearing peo
ple, lacks the kind of subtlety to
make him a true adversary to
the well-meaning and hard
working liberal James or the
cynical and evil principal, Mr.
Franklin. Orin turns out to be
only a tool for character de
velopment.
Another difficulty, this time
with characterization is the
rather unbelievable jealousy
that Sarah feels toward James
and James feels toward Orin
when the three get involved to
gether with a young and rather
unperceptive lawyer, Miss
Klein.
But Evans warns against
making much of the political
aspects of the play — he sees it
as a story of two people and

stresses the humor in Leed's
lines. There is humor but it is
the type of humor that elicits a
nervous laugh: Leeds is one of
those people for whom humor is
a form of defense.
Ignoring Evans' warning, the
most interesting political lesson
in the play is quite subtle, the
deaf students who protest the
school's hiring practices have to
speak the language of those in
power if they are to have any ef
fect — as any minority tries to
gain power has to learn.
Medoff learned a great deal
from Frelich and Steinberg. He
used their experiences as raw
material for the play. They told
him not only of their every day
concerns — how Frelich cannot
talk on the phone without her
husband acting as an in
terpreter and how Steinberg no
longer enjoys listening to Bach.
Interestingly enough neither
Frelich nor Bove share Sarah's
anger against the hearing
world. "I don't have her hostili
ty toward hearing people," said
Frelich in a New York Times in
terview, "I am proud like

Sarah, but I don't think I am as
stubborn or angry as she is."
In spite of all of the problems
of the text the performances are
solid in extremely demanding
roles.
"I knew nothing about
deafness," confessed Evans as
he talked about the role. Evans
learned sign language in a mat
ter of five weeks — most people
take years — and there were
only three weeks of rehersal
before the production opened in
Ft. Lauderdale, "Our first per
formances were nerve wrack
ing. I was not aware of how
challenging the role would be."
Evans did not realize "to
what extent an actor reacts to
voices. With Linda there was no
sound — it was like taking a sup
porting wall away." But by now
he is used to it, he has mastered
sign language and can even
sneak in private nuances to
Bove when he is on stage. He
even dreams in sign language.
Only 60 percent of the play is
signed — there are special in
terpreted performances for the
deaf — but the illusion of partic
ipating in a different world for a
hearing person is there. Unlike
film or television, theatre has a
wonderful way of making you
suspend belief, carrying you off
into an imaginary reality. So, in
this play the fact that Peter
Evans as James Leeds
articulates even the private
"conversations" between him
and Sarah — communications
that take place in silence — does
not strike you as being artificial
in the least.
