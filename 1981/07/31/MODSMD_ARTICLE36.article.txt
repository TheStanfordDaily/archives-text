# Dance Coalition puts on a festival of creation

Truly succesful works of art
have an impact on an audience.
"Smoke Signals/Spit Fire," one
of the dance pieces of the second
program of the Fourth Annual
Choreographers Concert was
one such piece.
In addition to being fine tech
nicians of movement, the dan
cers seemed infused with a
great inner spirit. Their strong
presence gave all their move
ments a sense of meaning.
The changing arrangements
of people on stage, first a pair
that quickly became a triplet,
then a quintet were especially
interesting.
One woman came on stage
moving her hands in a snake
like, S shaped pattern. She was
joined by another executing the
same movement, and then an
other, and then still another. In
perfect unison, they changed
the shape and rhythm of their

hand motions.
Though all of their move
ments were fluid, there were
many moments of stillness in
the dance. The decision of
choreographer Wendy Rogers
to use only women for this piece
contributed to the dynamic
unity of the piece.
"Interface," the third piece
of the Herbst theatre per
formance was alsoabout life and
its powers, but with a different
form. It began with a short,
sturdy woman standing over a
tall man who was curled up on
his side. She touched him almost
as if she was molding him and
then brought him to a standing
position. He was shaking. She
make him stop shaking. They
traveled slowly through space
together, always with a keen
and tense awareness of one an
other.
Somewhere in the midst of
the piece, they began to switch

roles; he became the stronger,
more manipulative one. They
looked and acted like animals
ready to pounce on the world as
well as on each other.
Hostility mounted. The music

pulsed faster and louder. And
then, as she appeared to become
paralyzed he placed her on her
back with her knees bent to her
body. With a sideways sharp
thrust of his leg, he dragged a
ways across the floor. He thrust
again, and dragged her again.
This motion was repeated sev
eral times as the lights went out
on the stage.
The strange, earthly sounds
of Sasha Matson's music helped
the interaction to take on a uni
versal quality. Like "Smoke
Signals/Spit Fire," "Interface"
was a very powerful piece.
Another piece, "Discarnate
Landscape" also involved the
creation but this time the hu
man kind. The painter waS a
painter who sat on the side of the
stage throughout most of the
dance as if the dance were his
dream — one that the audience
was witnessing.
So many different events
were taking place in the piece
that it was difficult to under
stand what they were and how
they all related to each other —
what works well in a dream may
not in a dance. People moved
underneath sheets, a woman
sang from off stage, two people
twirled flag-like items, and an
other swung material attached
to a wire. And that is only a frac
tion of the happenings.
Turning away from dances of
imagination or life forces,

"Trillium" and "Elliptical
Scherzo" were dances of pure
movement.
"Trillium," with its women
on pointe accompanied by men
was very classical. Choreo
grapher Geerge Nunes chose a
beautiful Adagio by Samual
Barber.
Although the choreographic
arrangements were interesting,
but at times too predictable.
Trillium is an herb that has
three leaves and a flower. And
so, the dancers moved in three
groups, wore lavender, green,
and blue with a green plant
diagonally across their chest.
The herb is supposed to have an
erect stem, so the dancers
fulfilled that criterion too in
their upright and graceful
manner.
The other piece, "Elliptical
Scherzo" was both very pure
and very modern. The dance in
corporated very simple actions ;
a sprightly walk, a jump, a turn
and a few other motions were in
cluded all movements in the
dance. Its simplicity was at
tractive but it ceased to be re
freshing after a while Still, it is
noteworthy that such a choreo
grapher Nancy Carp could make
it interesting.
A spoof on the traditions of
popular entertainment with
choreographer and dancer Bill
Irwin was was a perfect way to
top off the evening.

of the Herbst theatre per
formance was alsoabout life and
its powers, but with a different
form. It began with a short,
sturdy woman standing over a
tall man who was curled up on
his side. She touched him almost
as if she was molding him and
then brought him to a standing
position. He was shaking. She
make him stop shaking. They
traveled slowly through space
together, always with a keen
and tense awareness of one an
other.
Somewhere in the midst of
the piece, they began to switch

roles; he became the stronger,
more manipulative one. They
looked and acted like animals
ready to pounce on the world as
well as on each other.
Hostility mounted. The music

pulsed faster and louder. And
then, as she appeared to become
paralyzed he placed her on her
back with her knees bent to her
body. With a sideways sharp
thrust of his leg, he dragged a
ways across the floor. He thrust
again, and dragged her again.
This motion was repeated sev
eral times as the lights went out
on the stage.
The strange, earthly sounds
of Sasha Matson's music helped
the interaction to take on a uni
versal quality. Like "Smoke
Signals/Spit Fire," "Interface"
was a very powerful piece.
Another piece, "Discarnate
Landscape" also involved the
creation but this time the hu
man kind. The painter waS a
painter who sat on the side of the
stage throughout most of the
dance as if the dance were his
dream — one that the audience
was witnessing.
So many different events
were taking place in the piece
that it was difficult to under
stand what they were and how
they all related to each other —
what works well in a dream may
not in a dance. People moved
underneath sheets, a woman
sang from off stage, two people
twirled flag-like items, and an
other swung material attached
to a wire. And that is only a frac
tion of the happenings.
Turning away from dances of
imagination or life forces,

"Trillium" and "Elliptical
Scherzo" were dances of pure
movement.
"Trillium," with its women
on pointe accompanied by men
was very classical. Choreo
grapher Geerge Nunes chose a
beautiful Adagio by Samual
Barber.
Although the choreographic
arrangements were interesting,
but at times too predictable.
Trillium is an herb that has
three leaves and a flower. And
so, the dancers moved in three
groups, wore lavender, green,
and blue with a green plant
diagonally across their chest.
The herb is supposed to have an
erect stem, so the dancers
fulfilled that criterion too in
their upright and graceful
manner.
The other piece, "Elliptical
Scherzo" was both very pure
and very modern. The dance in
corporated very simple actions ;
a sprightly walk, a jump, a turn
and a few other motions were in
cluded all movements in the
dance. Its simplicity was at
tractive but it ceased to be re
freshing after a while Still, it is
noteworthy that such a choreo
grapher Nancy Carp could make
it interesting.
A spoof on the traditions of
popular entertainment with
choreographer and dancer Bill
Irwin was was a perfect way to
top off the evening.
