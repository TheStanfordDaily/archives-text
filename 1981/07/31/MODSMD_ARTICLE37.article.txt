# Jackson turns from rock to jive
## 
### Gina Arnold 
New Wave music often re
flects old wave roots, but never
has a new wave artist gone so
completely retroactive as Joe
Jackson did Tuesday night at
the Keystone Palo Alto. Jack
son, better known for his clever
new wave contributions to rock
'n' roll, commanded a full house
through his reputation alone
even though his show was a far
cry from the usual rock fare. In
his pop single "Kinda Kute,"
Jackson's description of himself
is accurate: "I'm the guy with
the big feet/but plenty of
nerve."
Jackson does indeed have
plenty of nerve (and big feet): it
takes a deal of courage to fill
houses across the country on the
basis of a rock 'n' roll reputation
and then play jazzy jive from
the Swing era. But you can't talk
of false advertising, the show
was billed as Joe Jackson's
Jumpin' Jive Revue.
Still, for a packed house to ac
cept an hour and a half of music
which is unfamiliar to most is
quite a risk for any artist to
take.
Somehow, Jackson pulled it
off. A friendly, warmhearted
crowd cheered Jackson from
start to finish as he and his six
piece band performed songs like
Glenn Miller's "Tuxedo Junc
tion" Louis Jordan's "Jack You
Dead," Cab Calloway's "San
Francisco Fan" and "Minnie
The Moocher," and many other
hits of a bygone era.
Jackson performed them all
extraordinarily well consider
ing he is young, white, and Brit
ish — the originators of these
songs were mostly older, black,
and Southern — but not well
enough. The dance floor was too
crowded to Lindy Hop, and
Jackson's attempts to mimic
the original recordings with a

black American accent, com
plete with soulfoul squints and
shakes as well as rubbery-lipped
faces didn't make it.
Not that Jackson doesn't give
good Satchmo imitations — he
does — but he should have taken
the clue from Graham Parker's
versions of the Jackson s's soul
hit "I Want You Back" and The
Supremes' "You Can't Hurry
Love," surprising punk-style re
interpretations in Parker's
raspy cockney voice.
Jackson's own lapses into his
natural long vowels sounded
fine, but his American twang
still needs work, it too is a little
peculiar. Jackson's tall, gawky
looks, his balding red head, as
well as his pop-eyed pale skin
and ill-fitting and loud dress suit
all combined into a warped and
ghastly vision of an old soul
master.
Jackson's intent was clear:
he was out to have a good time
and he didn't care about the
rest. Luckily for him his chatty
manner and cute little jive steps
made the show into one big par
ty. By the end of the show, the

crowd was howling raucously
"hidey, hidey, ho" along with
Joe.
The audience should be com
mended for their goodwilled en
thusiasm — there was not even
one cry for "Is She Really Going
Out With Him," Jackson's big
gest rock hit. But judging from
their equally warm reception of
the appalling opening act by the
Toons — who appeared to live by
H. L. Mencken's famous
statement "you'll never go
broke underestimating the in
telligence of the American pub
lic," the audience was ap
parently willing to cheer their
heads off for anything loud.
If anyone deserves success, it
is Jackson, a marginal pop star
who is willing to foresake his
previous success for something
he finds more stimulating and
more fun even if it is less com
mercial. If Joe Jackson can
bring the rest of the public round
with him the way he did at the
Keystone, then he'll be alright,
Jack. The public may very well
be smarter than H.L. Mencken
thought.
