# Jerry Garcia band: a clean, tight good time
## 
### Bill Frank 
To see Jerry Garcia play
before a capacity plus crowd
last Friday night at the Key
stone Palo Alto was an en
lightening and utterly enjoyable
experience for any music lover,
or, for that matter, anyone who
just likes to have a good time.
Appearing in his patented
black t-shirt and beige cor
duroys, the sedate, middle-aged
and bearded lead guitarist of the
Grateful Dead charmed the
crowd with his unique style of
guitar playing. Stoic and usually
expressionless, Garcia let the
cheering onlookers see his own
enjoyment by slight raisings of
the eyebrows and an occasional
barely detectable smile through
his massive facial growth.
The Jerry Garcia band, re
cently enlarged from four to
seven members, featured two
newly acquired back-up vocal
ists, and a second keyboard
player. Although the two new
vocalists added colorful backup
singing, their presence removed
some of the intimacy and rap
port that one usually feels with
"Jerry." Nevertheless when

Garcia approaches the micro
phone after a long, crystal clear
picking session, he seems to be
on stage alone.
Garcia's country-folk-rock
style can transform even the
most mundane and hackneyed
tunes into great pieces of music,
as he skillfully proved. His
opening number, the James
Taylor classic "How Sweet It
Is," was colorfully innovative, a
refreshing relief to anyone who
has heard the song as many
times as most of us have.
Throughout the song, Garcia
played with precision, driving
the crowd wild with short spurts
of banjo-style guitar playing
combined with his ruddy but
likeable voice.
After the first stanza of Bob
Dylan's "Tangled Up in Blues"
Garcia stepped back from the
mike and started to pick. With
each resounding note, the tempo
gradually increased until after
20 minutes of jamming, the
crowd was jubilantly cheering
to the astonishingly directed
riff. The atmosphere was so
lively that the Keystone could
have been mistaken for a New
Year's Eve celebration.
