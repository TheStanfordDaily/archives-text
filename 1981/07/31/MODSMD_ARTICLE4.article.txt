# City Council votes to tighten overnight parking regulations
## 
### Carl Johnston 
It's not only expensive to drive a car these days,
but even simply parking them is costly, too. In
fact, students, faculty and staff living in Palo Alto
could soon face not only fees for on-campus park
ing, but a per year tab for parking in front of
their own homes.
The new parking restrictions passed by the Palo
Alto City Council this week call for a $19 a year
parking permit fee for residents who wish to park
their cars in the street any morning between 2
a.m. and 6 a.m..
The restrictions will also apply to overnight
guests who park in the street. Residents will be re
quired to call for a free guest parking permit when
guests' cars cannot be moved on-site.
Residents in single family dwellings who want
to park their cars in the street, except in ex
empted areas downtown and in the Ventura dis
trict, will be required to buy permits. However,
residents must first prove an insufficiency of
private parking.
The move by the Council is intended to limit the
eye-sore some say is caused by the number of cars
parked in the streets of the city.
The regulations will particularly effect Stan
ford students living in houses with a number of
other students who have cars and not enough ga
rage space and driveway to accomodate them all.
The action permit idea is nothing new to Palo

Alto, however. The issue voted on Monday will re
vitalize a parking permit system begun in the '60s
under which residents were required to pay a $6
fee. The police department in Palo Alto, however,
stopped enforcing this requirement around 1976.
The $19 fee recommended by the Council will pro
vide the funds necessary to re-enforce these park
ing regulations — at a cost estimated at $65,000 a
year.
According to Jon Reider, a Stanford faculty
member living in Palo Alto, it was Stanford stu
dents, among others, who were being targeted at
the hearing Monday night. According to Ryder
many of the people pushing for enforcement of the
code lived in areas where Stanford students have
taken residence.
Reider, who testified against the measure
himself before the council said that the proposi
tion came about as a result of four or five com
plaints by Palo Alto residents. Such a small
number of complaints is not enough to justify the
sweeping measures adopted by the council. Con
tends Reider, "(the Council) is using too ex
tensive a solution to a rather minor set of com
plaints."
A local lawyer, Glynn Falcon, charging that the
rule violates civil rights, has threatened to take
the matter to court as soon as it goes into effect,
according to Reider.
Members of the City Council were not available
for comment.
