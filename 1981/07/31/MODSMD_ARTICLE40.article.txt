# 'Superman IV campy, exciting
## Reeve trashes the bad guys 
### Cabe Newell 
Superman II is campy. It is
fun. Bad guys get bashed, flags
are waved, and speeding
locomotives are thrown over
tall buildings in a single bound.
Superman II is a worthy, and
better successor to Superman.
More exciting, more humorous,
better controlled and directed
than its predecessor, Superman
II flies where Superman
stumbled.
There is a real warmth and
good humor that is the movie's
most consistent strength. Su
perman II is light, enjoyable es
capism that is suitable for just
about anyone.
Mixed in with the opening
credits, which are impressive
enough to warm even the most
jaded EE's heart, are scenes
from Superman, shown to re
fresh the audience's memory of
what has gone before. Three
baddies lead by General Zod,
seen briefly in Superman, are
back to seek revenge on Super
man.
Freed from the Phantom
Zone where they have been im
prisoned by an atomic blast, the
three immediately set out to
conquer the Earth. Meanwhile,
as Zod and Co. destroy in rapid
succession a lunar lander, a po
lice car, the large part of a
small mid-western town, and
the might of the U.S. military,
Superman and Lois Lane are off
at the North Pole.
While the Secret Service and
the presidential security forces
are getting their clocks cleaned
by the nasties from Krypton,

Lois is slipping off "to get into
something more comfortable."
And as the President of the Unit
ed States is kneeling in sub
mission to General Zod, Super
man is showing Lois the real
reason he is called the "Man of
Steel."
Zod has conquered all, and Su
perman is powerless to stop him
(dare we say impotent). He has
given up all his "superpowers"
to live with Lois Lane. What is
even worse, arch-enemy Lex
Luthor has managed to escape
from prison and discovered the
location of Superman's love nest
in the North.
The oppressed masses all
over the world call out for salva
tion, and all Superman can do is
get stomped on by an obnoxious
truck driver.
What follows is a series of
mildly improbable plot twists
that lead to a final confrontation
between the forces of evil and
good in the skies above Metropo
lis and in the icy wastes of the
North Pole. And just like in the
comics, though the final out
come is never in doubt, the ex
act way in which the forces of
good will triumph remains in
doubt right up to the time before
"Coming Soon — Superman III"
flashes on the screen.
Christopher Reeves as Super
man and Margot Kidder as Lois
Lane are the best aspects of the
movie. Reeve's portrayal of the
shy, mild-mannered reporter is
both comical and sensitive, and
blends well into his character
ization of Superman. By avoid

ing mindless, macho postur
ings, Reeves makes Superman
more than a fiat, comic-strip
character. Margot Kidder, even
though ladened with some of the
movie's worst lines, delivers a
fine performance as the brash
Lois Lane.
She projects the feeling that
behind her bitchy exterior there
lies a tough but lovable interior
that may even convince a super
hero that there is more to life
than chasing criminals.
Gene Hackman is hilarious as
the evil egomaniac and genius
Lex Luthor — "What? You
would kill me? The greatest
criminal mastermind of our
time?"
With his two cretinous side
kicks, played by Ned Beatty and
Valerie Perrine, and his simple
but large-scale plans — ! i ve~
always liked beach-front prop
erty. Make me king of Austral
ia" — Lex Luthor slithers his
way, if not into our hearts, at
least into our favor.
The movie falls down, oddly
enough, in the area of special ef
fects. With a score derived from
John Williams' original, some
scenes are visually and aurally
spectacular, yet a number of
scenes are so poorly done as to
threaten the illusion the movie
is trying to maintain.
At times one even wonders if
perhaps the men who used to
make the old Godzilla sets
haven't found a new employer.
But it is the human and not tech
nological aspects of movie-mak
ing that are what are special
about Superman 11.
