Baseball strike may be over
Santa Ana, Calif. — The end to the major league
baseball strike will be announced Sunday and play
could resume as early as Aug 10, the Register news
paper of Orange County said in a story for today's edi
tions.
All essential terms were worked out yesterday at
talks in New York City, the paper said it was told by
sources close to team owners and the Major League
Players Association.
It was agreed that players will return to organized
practices on Tuesday, receiving full salary for up to
seven days of practice before games resume. Any time
after that before play resumes would be compensated
at $35 per day expense money, the paper said.
"If that is the formula we'll use, then I'll guarantee
we'll need just seven days to work out," said Don
Baylor, the California Angels' player representative
Baylor told the paper it was obvious to a lot of people
that the strike would end about the time the major
league teams' strike insurance payments end next
week
Iranians protest at embassy
Tehran — About 200 angry Iranians yesterday dem
onstrated in front of the French Embassy here to de
mand the extradition of their ousted president,
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, who was given political asylum
in France Wednesday.
"Down with French imperialism," "French govern
ment: give back Bani-Sadr" and "Death to (French
President Francois) Mitterand," the crowd chanted.
"If the government does not return Bani-Sadr. we
will do the same thing as we did to (President Jimmy)
Carter," one of the protest speakers threatened, in an
obvious reference to the seizing of hostages at the U.S.
Embassy in November 1979.
France, which granted Bani-Sadr political asylum
Wednesday shortly after his daring escape, has re
portedly rejected Iranian demands for his extradition
The demonstrators plastered the French Embassy

walls with portraits of Iranian religious leaders and
banners in French, English and Farsi demanding the
return of Bani-Sadr.
"He must be judged in Iran: the Moslem people de
mand his extradition," the banners read.
Attempted coup made in Gambia
Abdijan, Ivory Coast — A combined force of leftist
paramilitary police and armed civilians attempted a
coup against the government of Gambia early yester
day morning while President Dawda Jawara was in
London for Prince Charles' wedding.
Jawara said in a BBC interview yesterday evening,
however, that the coup "has not succeeded yet," and
loyalist forces were reportedly still fighting the rebels
in the Gambian capital of Banjul. Jawara said he had
received reports from Banjul during the day in two tel
ephone conversations with his vice president.
Gambia's radio, which was controlled by the rebel
forces and announced victory, identified the leader of
the coup as Kukli Samba Sanyang, whose party, the
Gambian Socialist Revolutionary Party, was banned
by Jawara's government last fall following th&vas
sassination of the director of the country's 900-man po
lice force.
A group of about 300 policemen who serve a para
military function and are called the field force were re
ported to be fighting on the side of the rebels. The coun
try has no army.
Sadat to discuss PLO with Reagan
Cairo — President Anwar Sadat of Egypt intends to
place the implementation of the Camp David accords
regarding a settlement of the Palestinian issue at the
center of his talks with President Ronald Reagan in
Washington next week, according to a high-ranking
Egyptian official.
Declaring that the recent events in Lebanon proved
that "peace is urgently needed for the area," Foreign
Minister Kamal Hassan Ali said in an interview that the
main thrust of Sadat's visit would be to convince the
Reagan administration of the need to provide the
Palestinians with autonomy on the West Bank and Gaza

Strip.
"Here will be the main message to President Rea
gan," he said.
Ali also urged the Reagan administration "to recog
nize and deal directly" with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, saying this would give new impetus to the
peace process and encourage the PLO to recognize Is
rael.
Asked if Sadat would make this request formally to
Reagan, Ali said he did not expect he would and he was
only saying "what I personally hope."
Reagan lauds states rights
Atlanta — Buoyed by passage of a tax bill that will
reduce federal revenues drastically, President Ronald
Reagan yesterday called for "another great revolution
and experiment" to return federal authority to state
governments systematically.
"With our economic proposals, we are staging a
quiet federalist revolution," Reagan said in a speech to
the National Conference of State Legislatures. "It is a
revolution that promises to be one of the most exciting
and noteworthy in our generation."
The response to his speech also was relatively quiet,
but the audience laughed heartily when Reagan said, in
reference to his victory Wednesday on Capitol Hill, "I
don't know who's happiest about yesterday's events,
me or Prince Charles."
