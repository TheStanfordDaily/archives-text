# Peter Coutts condo project gets underway

Construction of 140 condominium units
on Peter Coutts Hill got underway last
week after more than a year's planning
and negotiation by University officials
and community interest groups.
According to Director of Housing Pro
grams Robin Hamill, the $19 million
project is expected to be completed in
January 1983, with some units to open as
early as next summer. The units will sell
for between $165,000 and $225,000, she
said.
The 20-acre site is located at the cor
ner of Page Mill and Peter Coutts Roads
in an area long used by Palo Alto resi
dents as recreational grounds. Hamill
said the University plans to leave open
four acres and will permit continued pub
lic access.
"We recognize the unique nature of
Peter Coutts Hill and its importance as
open space to the area, both for our own
campus residents and those in
Terrace," Hamill said.
Hamill said that because Palo Alto
real estate is among the most expensive
in the country, the University has al
located Coinvestment Monies (COIN) to

assist faculty in financing the units, and
that additional means of "creative fi
nancing" is planned.
COIN is a University sponsored, sec
ond-mortgage program designed last
year to assist faculty in financing up to
two-thirds of the cost of a home.
COIN funding could range from $4.3
million to $6.4 million annually in the
first five years, according to University
estimates.
Director of Housing Development
Frank Morrow said that it is the Univer
sity's goal to create affordable housing
with financing terms that allow incom
ing faculty to live on campus.
Those units not sold will be made
available for short-term rental to assist
in faculty recruitment. Priority will be
given to new faculty as determined by
the deans of schools and to faculty who
live beyond a 15-mile radius of Hoover
Tower,
According to Hamill, the project will
alleviate the imbalance in faculty jobs
and housing and will facilitate the re
cruitment and retention of faculty.
"What makes the housing shortage so
serious is that Stanford is competing for

faculty with institutions where housing
costs are one-sixth to one-half the cost of
housing at Stanford," she said. She noted
that currently only 53 percent of the fac
ulty live in University housing.
Originally proposed in 1971 to encom
pass 225 units and to receive federal sub
sidies, the project was revised in 1978 to
be funded solely by the University.
The new proposal was presented in
1979 by the University to College Terrace
residents, the Palo Alto City Council, and
the Palo Alto Planning Commision. As
part of the University sponsored "Open
Planning Process," a series of 14 meet
ings were held throughout more than a
year, during which the University openly
negotiated with community interest
groups affected by the proposed con
struction.
Director of Community Relations An
drew Doty addressed the University's
change in its planning process.
"Citizens' groups rightfully have much
more power than they used to. No longer
can we seek county approval without get
ting public feedback first."
Hamill called housing one of
the University's most serious
non-academic problems. "The
Peter Coutts project has taught
us to do comprehensive plan
ning and to stay ahead of the
crisis, not to respond to it," she
said.
According to Hamill, the Col
lege Terrace School District is
pleased with the new construc
tion. She said they are " de
lighted" with the project and ex
pect that incoming families will
make up for declining en

rollments of recent years.
The condominiums will be
constructed on three sides of
Peter Coutts Hill, with the open
end facing the the four acres of

undeveloped land at the top of
the hill. A recreational center
and a swimming pool will be
built at the center of the com
plex.
