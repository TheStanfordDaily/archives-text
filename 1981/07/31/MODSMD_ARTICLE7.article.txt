# Tiny Belize: independence despite dispute
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Belize City, Belize — The government of Belize,
Britain's largest remaining colony, is going ahead
this week with plans to declare itself Central
America s newest nation, despite a still un
resolved border dispute with Guatemala.
Prime Minister George Price, on his return
from talks with British officials in London, an
nounced this week that the Massachusetts-size co
lony would achieve independence Sept. 21. The an
nouncement was made at the same time by the
British Foreign Office, which said British troops
now stationed in Belize will remain for an "ap
propriate period."
The British agreement came as the little co
lony's bigger neighbor, Guatemala, was insisting
that it "would not tolerate" any unilateral decla
ration by Belize of its independence.
Guatemala has always looked on the British
territory as part of Guatemala's inheritance from

Spain after the breakup of the Spanish Empire in
the early 19th century.
Britain granted self-government to British
Honduras in 1964, and became more and more
anxious to grant full independence as the costs of
aid rose to an estimated $10 million a year. But
Price wanted a firm British commitment to keep
defense forces here, and Britain declined to give it
until an agreement could be worked out with
Guatemala.
Charging a "sellout," the Belize Action Move
ment demonstrated against the agreement. There
were days of rioting, looting and burning in which
two persons were killed. Guatemala, the group
said, deserved nothing. The chief opposition in
parliament, the United Democratic Party, which
holds five seats in the House of Assembly to 13 for
Price's People's United Party, agreed, and op
posed independence under the proposed condi
tions.
