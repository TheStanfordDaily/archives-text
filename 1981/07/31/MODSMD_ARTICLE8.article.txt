# Social scientists limited to 3 weeks
## China restricts U.S. field study 
### Washington Post 
Beijingâ€” Two years after an
agreement opening the nation to
American scholars, the Chinese
government has imposed new
restrictions on foreign social
scientists' research in such
touchy subjects as China's birth
control program and factory or
ganization.
U.S. Embassy officials here
have been told that American
anthropologists and social econ
omists planning to do several
months of field research start
ing this fall in Chinese villages

and work places will have to re
strict their site visits to three
weeks.
The Chinese Academy of So
cial Sciences, which coordi
nates the research programs,
explained that visiting scholars
consume too much of local of
ficials' time, keeping them
from the task of revitalizing
China's economy.
Foreign scholars and
diplomats, however, believe
that there are more compelling
reasons for the research
crackdown. They say Chinese
officials object to the free
wheeling and sometimes unruly
personal style of Western spe
cialists and to their aggressive
poking around in Chinese socie
ty-
The new rules will con
siderably narrow one of the ma
jor avenues of Western observa
tion into Chinese life. For the
academics, the chance to live in
Chinese villages or investigate
factory life has opened up a rich
vein of analytical material. It is
of pioneering significance to
American social scientists, who
were deprived of access to the
mainland during 30 years of
Sino-American hostility.
As part of the warming
climate of relations, Washing
ton and Beijing agreed in 1979 to
exchange scholars. The new
limits on field work apply to all
foreign social scientists work

ing in China, but its impact is
chiefly felt by the American re
searchers, who have dominated
the field since the exchange
agreement.
"The Chinese think the Amer
ican way of doing social re
search is too rash and tactless,"
said an American scholar doing
work in China. "They (the
Americans) ask too many em
barrassing questions about sen
sitive issues."
American social scientists in
turn resent the time and travel
restrictions placed on their re
search, maintaining that at
least six months of field work is
necessary to compile a mean
ingful statistical base for
analysis. They point out that
more than 2000 Chinese scholars
are currently doing research in
the United States, free to roam
wherever their curiosity leads
them.
After a brief field visit al
lowed by the new rules, scholars
will be restricted to research in
stitutes in urban areas, accord
ing to a U.S. official.
American officials who have
watched the exchange program
grow from infancy two years
ago are hopeful that the Chinese
will soften their stand. "We're
moving from a period of laissez
faire to one in which regulations
are beginning to form," said a
diplomat.
