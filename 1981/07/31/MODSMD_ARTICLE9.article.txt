## Conference on Helsinki accords adjourns amid sharp dissension 
### Los Angeles Times 
Madrid, Spain — Months be
hind schedule and still in deep
deadlock over human rights and
disarmament, the 35-nation con
ference reviewing the Helsinki
detente agreements recessed
here Tuesday until Oct. 27.
At a final plenary session, the
chief U.S. delegate, Max Kam
pelman, delivered a slashing at
tack on what he called the
"cruel relentlessness" of Soviet
repression of human rights,
which he declared had in
creased in numbers and intensi
ty since the review conference
began its work in Madrid 10
months ago.
"The United States will re
turn in October to join nearly all
of the delegations here in de
termination to bring this meet
ing to a close with positive, sub
stantial and balanced results,"
Kampelman said. "What we
need is a demonstration that the
Soviet Union intends to abide by
the provisions of the Helsinki
final act. Our people have every
right to ask what good it does to
talk about new promises when
old ones are not kept."
Soviet response
Leonid Ilychev, the Soviet
delegate who served as editor of
Pravda in Joseph Stalin's day,
followed immediately to accuse
Kampelman of "disgusting
cynicism, contempt, demagogu
ery, back-alley tactics, in
terference in the affairs of other
countries, an attempt to wreck

the conference and a demon
stration of the imperial policy of
the United States in wanting to
impose its opinions on 35 coun
tries."
But as one of the Western del
egates summarized the situ
ation: "We've got the Soviets on
the hook and we're not going to
let them off easily."
Nearly completed
Despite the deadlock and the
polemic atmosphere, the 10
months here have not been
wasted. So far, the delegates
have agreed on about 80 percent
of the text of a final document.
Most of that work covers the
less controversial aspects of
East-West relations, such as im
provements in economic coop
eration, increased cultural ex
changes and principles of politi
cal cooperation. The draft also
includes a statement in which
East and West join for the first
time in denouncing terrorism.
But on human rights, the con
ference is still arguing over the
wording of the texts concerning
reunification of families, the
right of religious worship, and a
commitment the Western na
tions want concerning bilateral
follow-up meetings on specific
human rights problems.
Journalists
Meanwhile, there is agreed
language on commitments to
improve conditions for journal
ists, including multiple entry vi
sas and the right of television re
porters to take their own cam

era crews into other countries.
With these achievements, the
conference is already far ahead
of the last review meeting held
in Belgrade in 1977-78 when it
comes to potential results.
The biggest stumbling block
still remaining concerns the
terms and arrangements for
convening a special European
disarmament conference under
the''Helsinki umbrella.'' Such a
meeting has been a prime politi
cal objective of the Soviet Union
since the Madrid talks began.
The aim of the Western powers
has been to ensure that such a
conference be limited to precise
practical objectives and that it
not become simply a forum for
Soviet disarmament propagan
da.
