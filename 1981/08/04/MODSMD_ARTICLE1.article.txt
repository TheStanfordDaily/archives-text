## Reagan warns air strikers 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Air traffic controllers illegal
ly walked off their jobs yester
day and crippled commercial
flights in the first nationwide
strike of federal workers in his
tory. President Ronald Reagan
called them lawbreakers and
gave them 48 hours to resume
work or be fired.
"I must tell those who failed
to report for duty this morning
they are in violation of the law,
and if they don't report for duty
within 48 hours, they have for
feited their jobs and will be ter
minated," Reagan declared.
"If we're all fired, I want to
know who's going to work the
airplanes," said a defiant Rob
ert Poli, president of the strik
ing 15,(300-member Professional
Air Traffic Controllers Or
ganization (PATCO), respond
ing to Reagan's ultimatum.
Secretary of Transportation
Drew Lewis called the union's
wage contract demands un
reasonable and declared that
the government would not
budge from its offer. He also
vowed not to return to the
bargaining table until the strike
was over.
Lewis said the striking con
trollers have until their local
time of l f . a.m. tomorrow to re
turn to their jobs at airport tow
ers and regional traffic centers.
"People who have not returned
at that point will be terminated
by the federal government and
will not be rehired," he said.
Lewis said that the govern
ment also has moved to im
pound the union's $3.5 million
strike fund and to remove the
union as the bargaining agent
tor the controllers.
The government won a no
strike order in the pre-dawn
hours before the strike began.
Late in the day, U.S. District
Judge Harold Green opened a
hearing on whether to issue a
contempt of court order against
PATCO.
The government said the
judge would be asked to fine
PATCO $1 million tor Monday,
$1 million on Tuesday and $1
million on Wednesday if the
strike continues. If the strike is

not settled by 5 p.m. Thursday,
the government wanted the
right to return to court and pro
pose a new fine schedule.
In addition, the government
wanted the judge to fine 11 union
leaders $1000 a day for Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday with a
similar option to return with a
new proposal.
In New York City, the Air
Transport Association, repre
senting the airline industry,
said it was asking U.S. District
Judge Thomas Piatt to impose a
tine of $50,000 an hour for the
duration of the strike plus ac
tual damages suffered by the in
dustry.
FAA officials, speaking anon
ymously, acknowledged that
tiring large numbers of con
trollers would create a severe
problem. They noted it takes
three years to produce a fully
skilled controller.
The 15,000 unionized con
trollers normally work from 23
regional centers in the United
States and Puerto Rico and at
more than 500 airports. They
monitor commercial flights
with radar and give directions
to aircraft from the moment
they take off until they land.
It is a job so tension-ridden,
the union says, that the con
trollers deserve a 32-hour work
week, extra compensation and
special treatment. The average
experienced controller now
earns about $34,000 a year.
Reagan, speaking in the
White House Rose Garden, re
called his past as a union presi
dent and declared he respects
the right of private employees
— but not government employ
ees — to strike.
He noted that controllers
promised not to strike when
they took their jobs.
"I hope you'll emphasize
again the possibility of termi
nation. because I believe that
there are a great many of those
people who have been swept up
in this and probably have not re
ally considered the fact that
they have taken an oath, the fact
that this is now in violation of
the law," Reagan told re
porters.

"I hope they will remove
themselves from the law
breaker situation by returning
to their posts."
Lewis said the government
had provided "a very satisfac
tory offer" in a bargaining ses
sion that collapsed Sunday
night. Poli called it an "insult."
Lewis said the controllers
were demanding 17 times what
their leaders agreed to last
month. That tentative contract
was rejected by 95 percent of
the union membership, leading
to new bargaining and the new
impasse.
The union sought a reduction
in the 40-hour work week to 32
hours, increased retirement
benefits and a maximum salary
that would have reached $59,000
a year — about $10,000 more
than the current maximum.

three years to produce a fully
skilled controller.
The 15,000 unionized con
trollers normally work from 23
regional centers in the United
States and Puerto Rico and at
more than 500 airports. They
monitor commercial flights
with radar and give directions
to aircraft from the moment
they take off until they land.
It is a job so tension-ridden,
the union says, that the con
trollers deserve a 32-hour work
week, extra compensation and
special treatment. The average
experienced controller now
earns about $34,000 a year.
Reagan, speaking in the
White House Rose Garden, re
called his past as a union presi
dent and declared he respects
the right of private employees
— but not government employ
ees — to strike.
He noted that controllers
promised not to strike when
they took their jobs.
"I hope you'll emphasize
again the possibility of termi
nation. because I believe that
there are a great many of those
people who have been swept up
in this and probably have not re
ally considered the fact that
they have taken an oath, the fact
that this is now in violation of
the law," Reagan told re
porters.

"I hope they will remove
themselves from the law
breaker situation by returning
to their posts."
Lewis said the government
had provided "a very satisfac
tory offer" in a bargaining ses
sion that collapsed Sunday
night. Poli called it an "insult."
Lewis said the controllers
were demanding 17 times what
their leaders agreed to last
month. That tentative contract
was rejected by 95 percent of
the union membership, leading
to new bargaining and the new
impasse.
The union sought a reduction
in the 40-hour work week to 32
hours, increased retirement
benefits and a maximum salary
that would have reached $59,000
a year — about $10,000 more
than the current maximum.
From the Daily wire services
Air traffic controllers illegal
ly walked off their jobs yester
day and crippled commercial
flights in the first nationwide
strike of federal workers in his
tory. President Ronald Reagan
called them lawbreakers and
gave them 48 hours to resume
work or be fired.
"I must tell those who failed
to report for duty this morning
they are in violation of the law,
and if they don't report for duty
within 48 hours, they have for
feited their jobs and will be ter
minated," Reagan declared.
"If we're all fired, I want to
know who's going to work the
airplanes," said a defiant Rob
ert Poli, president of the strik
ing 15,(300-member Professional
Air Traffic Controllers Or
ganization (PATCO), respond
ing to Reagan's ultimatum.
Secretary of Transportation
Drew Lewis called the union's
wage contract demands un
reasonable and declared that
the government would not
budge from its offer. He also
vowed not to return to the
bargaining table until the strike
was over.
Lewis said the striking con
trollers have until their local
time of l f . a.m. tomorrow to re
turn to their jobs at airport tow
ers and regional traffic centers.
"People who have not returned
at that point will be terminated
by the federal government and
will not be rehired," he said.
Lewis said that the govern
ment also has moved to im
pound the union's $3.5 million
strike fund and to remove the
union as the bargaining agent
tor the controllers.
The government won a no
strike order in the pre-dawn
hours before the strike began.
Late in the day, U.S. District
Judge Harold Green opened a
hearing on whether to issue a
contempt of court order against
PATCO.
The government said the
judge would be asked to fine
PATCO $1 million tor Monday,
$1 million on Tuesday and $1
million on Wednesday if the
strike continues. If the strike is

not settled by 5 p.m. Thursday,
the government wanted the
right to return to court and pro
pose a new fine schedule.
In addition, the government
wanted the judge to fine 11 union
leaders $1000 a day for Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday with a
similar option to return with a
new proposal.
In New York City, the Air
Transport Association, repre
senting the airline industry,
said it was asking U.S. District
Judge Thomas Piatt to impose a
tine of $50,000 an hour for the
duration of the strike plus ac
tual damages suffered by the in
dustry.
FAA officials, speaking anon
ymously, acknowledged that
tiring large numbers of con
trollers would create a severe
problem. They noted it takes
three years to produce a fully
skilled controller.
