### Washington Post 
Washington — The final rec
onciliation bill sent to President
Ronald Reagan last Friday will
result in more than $35 billion in
budget cuts starting Oct. 1. Cat
egory by category, the major
cuts are as follows:
Jobs
In the largest cut in the bill, in
immediate terms, the once
huge public service em
ployment program that pro
vided jobs for 300,000 people
earlier this year was
The $200 million
Young Adult Conservation
Corps was also eliminated, and
a training program for jobless
youth was preserved but had its
funding cut.

The number of jobless work
ers who will qualify in the future
for extended unemployment
benefits beyond the basic 26
weeks was reduced by eliminat
ing the national "trigger" tor
extended benefits and by requir
ing higher unemployment rates
before any state can extend
them.
Education
Guaranteed loans for college
students were reduced by less
than Reagan had proposed, with
a means test imposed only for
families with annual incomes
exceeding $30,000, instead of for
all families. Families with less
income would still be able to get
loans ot up to $2500 as a matter
of right. A 5 percent origination
fee will be required for loans.
For loans to parents of college
students, the interest rate will
be raised from 9 to 14 percent,
unless the Treasury bill rate
falls below 14 percent. Grants to
poorer college students were
also reduced.
About 30 small education pro

grams were merged into block
grants with iewer federal con
trols and less money, but all the
big programs, including $3.5
billion tor aid to disadvantaged
children, were kept separate,
giving Reagan a block grant of
less than $600 million instead ot
the $4 billion that he wanted.
Money for the Head Start pro
gram for preschoolers was re
stored atter being dropped, ap
parently inadvertently. Fund
ing of $950 million was provided,
as Reagan wanted.
Health
About 20 health programs
were merged into block grants.
Funds for some programs, like
drug abuse and mental health,
were included in the grants,
while funds tor others. like fam :
ilv planning and services for mi
grant workers, were kept sepa
rate. Programs within the block
grant wiil be cut by about 25 per
cent. for $1 billion in savings
over three years.
Medicaid payments to states
for care of the poor will be re
duced by about $1 billion a year
over the next three years. Antic
ipated spending will be cut 3
percent next year, 4 percent in
1983 and 4 5 percent in 1984
through a variety of cost-saving
devices.
Among many cost-saving
steps in the Medicare program
for the elderly was an increase
from $228 to $256 (rising to $328
in 1984) in the amount that reci
pients must pay for hospital
care before the government
starts picking up the tab.
Social Security
About $1 billion was saved for
next year by eliminating the
$122-a-month minimum benefit
under Social Security for new
retirees in December and for
current recipients next March.
This would produce a long-term
saving of $7 billion over the next
tive years. But Reagan pro
posals to cut back Social Secur
ity in other ways tor future re
tirees helped sensitize Congress
on this issue, and there is now a

move to restore the $122-a
-month floor tor the 3 million
people who are benefiting trom
it. Legislation to restore the
benefit is expected to be con
sidered in September.
Student benefits are also
phased out for adult dependents
ot Social Security recipients.
Disability provisions were
tightened to avoid duplication of
benefits.
Subsidized Housing
The number of new federally
subsidized units ot rental and
public housing will be restricted
to auout 153,000, a cut ot 40 per
cent from former president
Carter's recommendation of
260.000 units and tewer even
than the 175,000 units that Rea
gan proposed.
Rents will rise from 25 per
cent of a tenant's income to 30
percent over five years. Income
eligibility was not changed, but
the very poor would be favored
as new tenants.
Food Stamps
Cuts of $1.7 billion in the near
ly $12 billion food stamp pro
gram serving 22 million Ameri
cans will strike about 1 million
recipients from the rolls and
mean reduced benefits for an
other million. Cuts were about
$200 million deeper than Reagan
recommended. Eligibility is re
stricted to families earning 130
percent ot the poverty level.
Striking workers will be made
ineligible tor food stamps.
Puerto Rico's big food stamp
program was put into an $825
million block grant, thereby
curbing its growth.
Child Nutrition
The current $4.4 billion in sub
sidies for school lunches, break
fast feeding and day care, sum
mer meals, mothers' and in
fants' nutrition and related pro
grams was cut by $1.5 billion.
For the huge school lunch pro
gram, this will mean fewer free
meals and higher costs for those
who pay. Critics say the cuts
may end school lunch programs
in some financially strapped

school districts. Subsidies for
full-price lunches were reduced
by about 40 percent, and free
lunches will be provided only for
children of families with in
comes no higher than 130 per
cent oi the federal poverty
level. The price of reduced
price lunches is expected to
double.
Welfare
Savings of $1 billion were
made by reducing benefits and
tightening eligibility under the
aid to families with dependent
children program (AFDC), and
states will be permitted to adopt
"workfare" programs requir
ing people to take jobs in ex
change tor benefits. Reagan had
wanted mandatory "work
tare." Benefits will be denied to
striking workers.
Commerce
The Export-Import Bank,
which helps exporting in
dustries sell abroad, came out a
winner, getting about $700 mil
lion more than Reagan pro
posed.
Federal controls over busi
ness were loosened in a number
oi ways. Funds for the Con
sumer Product Safety Com
mission were cut and some of its
activities were curtailed. The
administration lost an attempt
to curb the Federal Trade Com
mission's antitrust activities.
Urban development action
grants (UDAG) that promote
commercial development in de
teriorating city neighborhoods
were continued but their fund
ing was cut.
Transportation
In addition to the extensive
cuts in mass transit aid that
Reagan had requested. Con
gress provided for the sale of the
heavily subsidized Conrail

freight system, preferably as an
entity but in pieces alter Oct. 30,
1983, if it remains unprofitable
as an entire system. Amtrak,
the subsidized rail passenger
service, is expected to retain
most ot its service instead of
confining service to the North
east corridor as Amtrak of
ficials said would happen under
Reagan's proposed cuts.
Energy
To help poor people with ris
ing energy costs. Congress kept
$1.88 billion for low-income fuel
assistance along with funds tor
home weatherization
It cut back heavily on planned
synthetic fuel development
projects, saving about $4 billion
over the long run. It also
claimed another nearly $4
biliion in savings for next year
alone from simply not counting
in the budget the expected costs
of filling the strategic petrole
um reserve.
The Clinch River breeder re
actor lives on. and so do some
energy conservation programs
that Reagan wanted to cut.
Miscellaneous
•The Legal Services Corp . a
program for the poor that Rea
gan wanted to turn over to the
states, was left untouched by
the reconciliation bill.
♦The endowments for the arts
and humanities came out worse
than before but better than Rea
gan wanted, with $119.3 million
for arts and $113.7 million for
humanities.
♦ Under advance funding re
quirements for public broad
casting, the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting was cut
back from its current funding
level of $172 million to $130 mil
lion a year tor 1984 through 1986.
