It's the new Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC)
16-minute film explaining the
center's services.
According to co-producer
(with CPPC Assistant to the Di
rector Debbie Duncan) and me
dia specialist Fritz Bottjer, the
audio visual production "in
troduces students to the CPPC
and all its services ... It ex
plains about letters of recom
mendation, gives a mock em
ployer situation; it mostly gives
a lot more information than
someone could want or could
handle But if I were a junior or
sophomore viewing the film, at
least I would know the facts
about what is available and
what I should expect in trying to
find employment."
The videotape, which pre
miered July T 4, will be shown
regularly during the school
year.
Melinda Kaewert, an employ
ee at CPPC, said the videotape
is "very effective in showing
students an overview of what's
available at the center."
Kaewart said she decided to
produce the tape because it is a
way of outreach to show people
what services we have. . to get
people to use our resources. The
whole office agreed that it
would be worthwhile."
According to Bottjer, the
belowline cost ot the videotape,
not including such things as
salaries, was $2200. The film
took 3 1/2 days to shoot.) "We
went over budget but that's to be
expected when you make a mov
ie." said Bottjer.
Though the film included a

couple months' worth of . pre
production work. Bottjer said
that the CPPC had the idea for
such an endeavor for five or six
yers.
A similar tape was made sev
eral years ago at the media cen
ter at the University of Utah
(Bottjer was able to see it last
year). "It was quite good so I
called them to get a sense of how
useful it could be. After the guy
chewed my ear off for a half an
hour telling me how great it
was, I decided that it would be a
good idea to make one that not
only improved on theirs but
which applied to Stanford.
"Our tape is a little more
broad stroke. We get the view
from a faculty person about let
ters of recommendation and
show frosh how they should con
sider plans to get to know their
field of study through em
ployment."
Participants in the videotape
consisted of over a dozen Uni
versity faculty, staff, and stu
dents, many of whom are em
ployed by CPPC.
Bottjer, who has produced
many videotapes for University
use (such as "Great Expecta
tions," a film for under
graduates), said he is "op
timistic about the use of
videotapes; it can be very
positive . . . This (the CPPC
tape) is a very positive one. It is
not to stimulate discussion. It
says. 'Here is everything. Not
all of this will help you, but
something in here will.' " Bott
jer said that he will be conduct
ing a summative consumer re
search project in September to
gauge reactions to the tape.
