# Cheerleaders kick off season
## 
### Tom Wallace 
Some may think that all
cheerleading requires is a loud
voice and a good figure. But as
216 junior high and high school
girls from as far away as San Di
ego learned at a cheerleading
camp here last week, it requires
skills ranging from athletic to
political,
"The camp's great, although
they work us to death," said
Tracy Boyd of Sacramento Val
ley High School. "I lost my
voice."
The five days of camp, spon
sored by the California Associa
tion of Directors of Activities
(CAD A), which ran from July 26
to July 30, lasted from 6 a.m. un
til 11 p.m. with much training in
between When asked what they
had learned, the Silver Creek
High School cheerleaders re
sponded, in sequence and with
official hand mo
tions" tumbling, cheers, hand
positions, skits, mounts, rou
tines."
But the girls learned more
than drills and techniques. The
camp emphasized leadership

and diplomacy as important
cheerleader skills. "We learned
how to motivate people, get
them involved," said Linda Sosa
of Silver Creek. "Most im
portantly, we learned how to get
along well with other people."
The cheerleading squads
competed for spirit sticks which
were awarded lor outstanding
performance during each day of
the camp. But other parts of the
camp involved working with
squads from rival schools. Sosa
said, "Now instead of hating
each other, we're friends."
This is one reason Jack
Ziegler, a teacher in Woodland,
said he helps with CADA-spon
sored camps. "They (the
cheerleaders) are more than
just performers," he said.
Typical day
The typical cheerleader spent
most of her day learning rou
tines and interacting with other
cheerleaders. All were required
to be up by 8 a.m. Those who
missed breakfast at Branner
food service dieted until lunch.
One San Diego cheerleader re

ported, " Not all the girls were
up in time tor a shower and
shampoo, but I was."
They practiced all day long,
largely in front of Wilbur Hall,
stopping only at noon for a
short lunch and a little relaxa
tion Workshops and skits were
held in the evenings. Lights
were to be out and cheerleaders
in bed by 11 p.m. — but some ad
mitted to talking from their
windows to charming reporters
who were hidden in bushes out
side.
The spirit squads lived in
Toyon Hall and were well
chaperoned. The cheerleaders
emphasized, "They kept out any
males trying to get in."
The cost for this exhausting
week was $107. In many cases,
part ot the camp was subsidized
by contributions from the stu
dents' schools.
Those who missed last week's
camp need not despair — anoth
er CADA- sponsored cheerlead
ing camp will be held here in two
weeks.
