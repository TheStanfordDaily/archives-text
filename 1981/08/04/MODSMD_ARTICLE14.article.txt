# Humanities center grows

A new institution was born last year to put
humanities here on par with the sciences.
According to Director lan Watt, former
chairman of the Department of English and of
the Committee on Modern Thought and Liter
ature, "During the last three decades, the
Linear Accelerator and the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences have
attracted a constant flow of scholars in the
physical and social sciences; the Stanford Hu
manities Center could surely play an impor
tant role in stimulating such interchanges in
the humanities."
The immediate concern of the Center is to
begin its fellowship program. Attracting schol
ars to do research, lectures and courses here
requires money. Watt is preparing to approach
some national foundations with specific
projects to ask for funding.
"But we're really hoping for a lot of private
donors, perhaps Stanford alumni," he said.
"What happens, though, is there are a lot of
people interested in a particular idea, a person
or a program â€” they're not really alumni but
they've had children here or something else."
But the University is giving "a good deal of
money," he said.
Watt said the fellowships must be known as a
nationwide competition. "Big names contend
for these things but it's really more valuable

for middle-level teachers who are more re
sponsive, perhaps, to the program's needs."
The Humanities Center began functioning
last spring with its first lecture series on "The
Current State of the Discipline." The speakers
examined and discussed modern perspectives
and conflicts within the various disciplines.
According to Watt, attendance was mainly fac
ulty and graduate students and people from
other campuses, but also included under
graduates.
Center fellows will mix three main ac
tivities: research; teaching regular courses
and seminars, lecturing and organizing con
ferences; and, collective studies of current
problems.
"I see in the future, when I am no longer Di
rector, a large building to provide a haven for
the mixed activities of the Center," Watt said.
"One really needs a physical locus where peo
ple get in the habit of meeting."
Watt said, "The education system, particu
larly in America, made people think their later
jobs would be endlessly challenging and in
teresting.
"There's been a change, and I think people
are getting a little more realistic," he con
tinued. "An intelligent person can learn to do
most any job in six to 12 months. Education is
what causes a person to be alive to a number of
things and is good in itself ."
