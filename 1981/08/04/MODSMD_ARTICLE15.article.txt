### Andres Fajardo 
The eager crowd tlies in and
takes their seats while tour
speakers are placed by workers
in positions so as to ofter the
maximum amount of sound to
all the listeners. Showtime
comes around and no orchestra
or band appears, nor is there
any stage for such a group. The
music begins, the audience
smiles and an occasional foot
taps in beat with the sounds
emitting trom the speakers.
Sound like something out ot a
science fiction novel?
It's not. It is a description of
one of the quarterly concerts

given by the Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA), a branch
ot the University Music Depart
ment.
According to Patte Wood, ad
ministrator for the center, the
program is interdisciplinary.
English, computer science, mu
sic and speech and hearing stu
dents are at the center, com
prised ot 30 scholars.
Wood also noted that the Uni
versity is a leader in the field of
computer music development
among the world's colleges. She
citcd other programs at MIT,
UC-San Diego, Princeton, Col
gate, and one Paris university.
According to second year stu
dent David Jatfe. Stanford "has
a lot more programs than other
universities."
Jatfe said he heard about the
center trom his computer music
instructor in Vermont. "I came
to Stanford especially for the
program "
All the music that is played
during the concerts is composed
by the students and is subse
quently programmed into the
center's computers, "Basical
ly, they (students who partici

pated) are composers with a
good music background," said
Wood. "They pick up what they
need to know about computers."
The students also have to go
through the regular music cur
riculum.
"We have had a real increase
in public interest because of the
concerts," Wood said. "There
have been capacity crowds."
The concerts are held outside
with members of the audience
sitting on chairs and blankets
with four speakers surrounding
them, creating a quadraphonic
effect as the sounds are coming
directly off the computer
