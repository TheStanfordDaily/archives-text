## O'Connor choice was Reagan's best move 
### 
It seems ironic that the most
conservative American presi
dent in the past 5") years would
be instrumental in breaking the
sex barrier surrounding the
I'nited States Supreme Court.
But that is precisely what hap
pened when President Ronald
Reagan announced a few weeks
ago that he would appoint Sand
ra Day O'Connor to the Supreme
Court The implications of this
appointment will be deep and
long lasting.
First, it proves that the Rea
gan administration is not sub
servient to the demands of ex
treme right-wing groups such as
the Moral Majority. Predic
tably. single interest groups like
the anti-abortion lobby and the
anti-E.R.A. lobby were upset
with the O'Connor announce
ment. Such groups no doubt felt
betrayed by Reagan because
they would have preferred the
appointment of a much more
conservative justice.
Second. O'Connor's appoint
ment fulfills Reagan's cam
paign promise to appoint a
woman to the Supreme Court.
There is nothing as upsetting to
the electorate as empty cam
paign promises To campaign
for a female appointment to the
Supreme Court is one thing; to
actually deliver that promise is
quite another. Indeed. Reagan's
appointment demonstrates his
accountability and goes a long
way toward enhancing his
credibility.
Third, appointing a woman to
the Supreme Court is more than
just a token move on Reagan's
part. Indeed, becoming an As
sociate Justice on the United
States Supreme Court is the pin

nacle of power within the legal
profession. Just as Thurgood
Marshall's appointment to the
Court in 1967 was a great step
forward for blacks. Sandra
O'Connor's appointment will
have a similar effect tor women
in 1981.
Fourth, appointing an individ
ual who has a moderate-to-con
servative ideology was an
astute political move. If Reagan
were to appoint a hardline con
servative to the bench,
progressive justices like
Marshall. Brennan, White, and
Blackman would be hesitant to
retire from their posts. This
would mean that Reagan might
not be able to appoint another
justice to the bench for quite
some time.
Fifth. O'Connor is highly
qualified for the position of As
sociate Justice regardless of
her sex. Consider her bio
graphy. She was admitted to the
California state bar in 1952 and
has been a Superior Court judge
for Maricopa county in Arizona
as well as a legislator in Arizo
na's state senate and assembly.
And sixth, regardless of
whether or not the United States
Senate confirms O'Connor, Rea
gan will go down in history as
the first president to actually
appoint a woman to the Su
preme Court. Politically, such a
move could bring back more
women voters to the Republican
party.
O'Connor's appointment is a
great moment for women in
general and for the Reagan
presidency as well.
