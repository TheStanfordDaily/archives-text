Is Stanford looking tor an ex
cuse to stage a showdown with
its workers? So it would seem,
judging from the attempts to
"reorganize" OSOC activist
Joyce Tipps-Coats out of her job
at SLAC (Dailx July 24).
Even assuming that the effort
is the innocent bureaucratic
streamlining which University
officials say it is, the attempt
represents an insensitivity of
startlingly gross proportions.
How long will it be until Stan
ford's workers demand an end
to such administration provoca
tions and to be treated hon
orably?

I am writing to protest a re

cent article entitled "San Fran
cisco: many species in the
nightclub genus" (Daily, July
301. Specifically, the statement
"sleazy dives where you can
simulate living in Detroit.
I am a former resident of De
troit. Michigan, born and raised
in that wonderful city.
One must actually live in De
troit and form his or her own
opinion of the City that put the
"world on wheels" and pro
duced such great musicians as
Barbara Streisand, Thelonious
Monk, Delia Reese and Dianna
Ross to name only a few. The
great technological discoveries,
industrial accomplishments,
and the fact that it is the only
city in the country having a body
of water that joins the United
States with a foreign country
speak for distinction.
Detroit boasts a library and
art museum which put San

Francisco's to shame Its sym
phony. theater, and professional
sports teams provide first class
entertainment for residents ot
the area.
Detroit has had its problems
over the years but has made
considerable progress in solving
them through the combined ef
forts of the city's many ethnic
groups.
So let's not put down one of
the most lively, well traveled,
internationally known cities in
the U.S. merely because the
American auto industry is in a
slump. It has been in slumps
before and has always managed
to come out of them, and shows
every sign of doing that now
fJetroit's a great place to visit,
live and call home.
