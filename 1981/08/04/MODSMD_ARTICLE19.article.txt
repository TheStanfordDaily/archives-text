## Private life drama opened to public scrutiny 
### 
I have a confession to make. I
feel compelled to admit that I
never sleep alone. S. has been
my nightly companion since we
first met.
Although I usually prefer to
be as discrete as possible re
garding certain aspects of my
personal lite, I realize that it is
often futile to attempt to escape
from the tentacles of the

grapevine. People are quick to
make assumptions, which fre
quently have no basis in fact and
are none of their concern even
when verified as such, regard
ing other peoples lives.
Therefore, this time, I would
like to broadcast news of my life
before the deluge of Rona-Bar
retts-in-training has an op
portunity.

The R.8.1.T. pre-professional
training program apparently
does not disciminate on the
basis of sex, race, national ori
gin, or intellectual ability. It ex
empts no one from, and offers
no immunity against being con
sidered a prospective subject on
whom the trainees may practice
such skills as claw-sharpening,
making slanderous character
judgements, general cattiness,
and dissemination of false in
formation. Anyone can be a suc
cessful gossip given sufficient
practice.
So as to assist the trainees,
enlightening them with the facts
before they create the fiction,
herein I shall disclose all details
of my life which may pertain to
their field of study.
Today is my anniversary S.
and I have been happily sharing
my bed for six weeks, since the
first day of classes this quarter.
Our reiationship began when
his shining black eyes caught
mine, and we stared, entranced,
at one another. S. seemed rather
shy, so I took the initiative and
picked him up.
Contrary to popular belief, it
is possible to find true love
within the confines of White
Plaza and adjacent buildings. S.
and I feel very privileged.
We never argue, never steal
the blankets from one another,
are not into kinkiness, and share
the same tastes in music, art,
literature, and politics. S. also
has yet to raise any objections to
my ardent feminist beliefs.
Our joint appearance on cam
pus is rare, because S. is not a
student, and his features pro
voke too many quizzical looks
for us to enjoy being in public.

Private, semi-clandestine rela
tionships become public knowl
edge more often than not here —
S. uses the dorm bathroom at
odd hours to avoid scandalizing
some of the more naive women
on my hall — and we usually pre
fer to draw minimal attention to
ourselves.
Once, though, S. and I break
tasted together in the dining
hall. As I had never attended
breakfast previously, friends
and acquaintances alike re
marked on my presence at that
hour, which precluded my at
tempt at going incognito. A few
astute observers also noticed
that I had not changed my
clothing from the preceeding
day — a mistake on my part
which provoked many sus
picious glances and veiled com
ments at the milk machine.
Judging from the whispers
and giggles which we overheard
from people at surrounding
tables, the implications of my
being with S. were clear.
After one such breakfast, S.
decided that eating breakfast in
bed was preferable, for not only
were we disconcerted by the at
tention we attracted, but also
our bed is a more relaxed set
ting for early morning hours.
Socializing at the Coffee
House one afternoon, after visit
ing the semi-deserted ASSU of
fice to hand in evaluation forms,
also proved to be an experience
not worth repeating. Although
S. and I were sharing a booth,
strangers ignored my requests
for privacy, and scrutinized S.,
so much that he felt uncom
fortable, and nearly toppled
from the seat at one point.

S. also detests the library.
During one visit to Meyer, his
godmother, presumably jealous
of my relationship with S.,
played a cruel trick on him. S.
was able neither to protest nor
to retaliate. That event almost
severed my friendship with S.'s
godmother; she had led S. into
the stacks, and left him to find
his way out, which caused me
great anxiety. S. has since re
fused to return to Meyer, will
not venture into Green either,
and no longer sees his god
mother, who spends much of her
time on campus.
S. is completely trustworthy,
totally devoted to me, con
sistently happy, and a spell
bound listener. I can tell S. my
deepest secrets without fear of
his announcing them to the
world. And although S. is much
tinier than I, and his size pre
cludes his hugging me properly,
I love him anyway.
Our relationship is secure,
and I am certain that S. will nev
er walk out on me. Actally S. is
incapable of walking. Or talk
ing. Or seeing, hearing etc. In
cidently, S. is inanimate.
And by the way — S.'s full
name is Snuffy. So put that on
the grapevine, if my personal
life is that gossip-worthy.
People never fail to talk about
other people, to gossip, dissect
the details of one's life such as
those revealed above. Such fact
or fiction, however, may serve a
piypose. It can form the basis
for endless small talk to enter
tain attendees at future cocktail
parties.
