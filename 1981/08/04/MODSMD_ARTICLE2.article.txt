# LOTS, CIT users to be shuffled but queues will still remain
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
Limited student access to
computers, a dilemma that
made queues at LOTS (Low Ov
erhead Time Sharing) computer
facility as familiar as the gas
lines of the '70s, continues to be
a growing problem here. This
fall, though a computer bor
rowed from the Business School
will still be in use, 48 new termi
nals have been purchased, and
the University's IBM 3033 com
puter in Forsythe Hall will be
opened up to students, the in
structional computer crunch
will probably remain.
And, the loan of LESS (LOTS
Extension Stopgap System), al
though timely, is not a per
manent solution, because the
LESS computer (a Dec 2060),
must be returned to the Busi
ness School at the end of the next
academic year.
In 1977, there were 32 termi
nals and about 2500 accounts at
LOTS; today there are 80 con
nected terminals and 4000 LOTS
accounts. Because of this vast
increase, the pressure on the

computer has mounted and the
load is often prohibitively high.
But Ralph Gorin, LOTS direc
tor. said "These problems stem
not from our failure at LOTS,
but from our success."
The crunch has occured for
several reasons, according to
Gorin, more classes use com
puters (now only one third of the
total class use of computers is
bv the Computer Science de
partment); and "new methods
of instruction. . are often novel
and innovative, but. . .also use
more computer time," he said.
LOTS was established in No
vember 1976 and use started in
January 1977. It was originated
in order to supplement CIT
(Center for Information and
Technology) for instructional
computing. In theory, all
teaching was to be done at
LOTS, and all research on other
computers. In reality, certain
classes remained at CIT and to
compensate for this, some re
search is now allowed at LOTS.
"To make up for this loss, and
also to increase access to com

puters, a more permanent an
swer needs to be found,'' said
Gorin.
One possible solution to the
crunch would be to allow more
instuctional computing on the
University's major IBM 3033
computer at CIT.
The 3033 has been used by de
partments, administration, and
private companies in the area,
who all pay for its use.
"Albert Hastorf, the provost,
has agreed to direct some funds
to pay for student use of the
3033,'' said Vice-Provost Ed
ward Shaw, and classes were
taught on it last spring quarter.
According to Gorin, the experi
ment has so far been successful,
and more classes will be taught
on the 3033 this coming year.
Professors ot engineering,
computer science, political sci
ence, education, and statistics
are being requested to try
teaching on the 3033. said Gorin,
but this change remains volun
tary, as it could require major
restructuring of course materi
al.
"The faculty are the most im
portant part of the University ;
students are of only transient in
fluence, and it is most impor
tant to offer a service by which
professors can effectively teach
a course," he said
The loss of the LESS com
puter can only be compensated
for if a significant number of
courses are moved to the 3033.
This June, it was proposed to
move 90,000 console hours,
30,000 per quarter, which is
more than one-half of the con
sole hours now used at LOTS,
from LOTS to the IBM 3033 at
CIT. Otherwise, the alternative
is to buy a new computer or a set
of micro-processors.
Although a micro-processor
costs less ($2OOO and up. as op
posed to $10,000 per terminal for
a major computer), "systems
available today each require a
separate storage unit (floppy
disc), and it would be unwise to
have students running around
each with their own floppy

Students sometimes wait several hours for access to LOTS. These
delays may be exacerbated when the business school computer is
removed from general student use.
discs," said Gorin.
Now, LOTS has no spare ca
pacity. The 48 new terminals
will, in theory, service the 3033
at CIT. However, in a first step
toward a major computer link
up, a switch will be set up which
will allow the 2040 (LOTS),the
2060 (LESS), and the 3033 (CIT)
all to be accessed from the same

terminal.
These special terminals will
be set up at CERAS, Terman, in
libraries, and possibly even in
some dorms. Rooms in the new
undergraduate housing project,
scheduled for completion in
1984, will also be wired so that
individual terminals can be
plugged into the system from
each student's room.

And, the loan of LESS (LOTS
Extension Stopgap System), al
though timely, is not a per
manent solution, because the
LESS computer (a Dec 2060),
must be returned to the Busi
ness School at the end of the next
academic year.
In 1977, there were 32 termi
nals and about 2500 accounts at
LOTS; today there are 80 con
nected terminals and 4000 LOTS
accounts. Because of this vast
increase, the pressure on the

computer has mounted and the
load is often prohibitively high.
But Ralph Gorin, LOTS direc
tor. said "These problems stem
not from our failure at LOTS,
but from our success."
The crunch has occured for
several reasons, according to
Gorin, more classes use com
puters (now only one third of the
total class use of computers is
bv the Computer Science de
partment); and "new methods
of instruction. . are often novel
and innovative, but. . .also use
more computer time," he said.
LOTS was established in No
vember 1976 and use started in
January 1977. It was originated
in order to supplement CIT
(Center for Information and
Technology) for instructional
computing. In theory, all
teaching was to be done at
LOTS, and all research on other
computers. In reality, certain
classes remained at CIT and to
compensate for this, some re
search is now allowed at LOTS.
"To make up for this loss, and
also to increase access to com

puters, a more permanent an
swer needs to be found,'' said
Gorin.
One possible solution to the
crunch would be to allow more
instuctional computing on the
University's major IBM 3033
computer at CIT.
The 3033 has been used by de
partments, administration, and
private companies in the area,
who all pay for its use.
"Albert Hastorf, the provost,
has agreed to direct some funds
to pay for student use of the
3033,'' said Vice-Provost Ed
ward Shaw, and classes were
taught on it last spring quarter.
According to Gorin, the experi
ment has so far been successful,
and more classes will be taught
on the 3033 this coming year.
Professors ot engineering,
computer science, political sci
ence, education, and statistics
are being requested to try
teaching on the 3033. said Gorin,
but this change remains volun
tary, as it could require major
restructuring of course materi
al.
"The faculty are the most im
portant part of the University ;
students are of only transient in
fluence, and it is most impor
tant to offer a service by which
professors can effectively teach
a course," he said
The loss of the LESS com
puter can only be compensated
for if a significant number of
courses are moved to the 3033.
This June, it was proposed to
move 90,000 console hours,
30,000 per quarter, which is
more than one-half of the con
sole hours now used at LOTS,
from LOTS to the IBM 3033 at
CIT. Otherwise, the alternative
is to buy a new computer or a set
of micro-processors.
Although a micro-processor
costs less ($2OOO and up. as op
posed to $10,000 per terminal for
a major computer), "systems
available today each require a
separate storage unit (floppy
disc), and it would be unwise to
have students running around
each with their own floppy

Students sometimes wait several hours for access to LOTS. These
delays may be exacerbated when the business school computer is
removed from general student use.
discs," said Gorin.
Now, LOTS has no spare ca
pacity. The 48 new terminals
will, in theory, service the 3033
at CIT. However, in a first step
toward a major computer link
up, a switch will be set up which
will allow the 2040 (LOTS),the
2060 (LESS), and the 3033 (CIT)
all to be accessed from the same

terminal.
These special terminals will
be set up at CERAS, Terman, in
libraries, and possibly even in
some dorms. Rooms in the new
undergraduate housing project,
scheduled for completion in
1984, will also be wired so that
individual terminals can be
plugged into the system from
each student's room.
Limited student access to
computers, a dilemma that
made queues at LOTS (Low Ov
erhead Time Sharing) computer
facility as familiar as the gas
lines of the '70s, continues to be
a growing problem here. This
fall, though a computer bor
rowed from the Business School
will still be in use, 48 new termi
nals have been purchased, and
the University's IBM 3033 com
puter in Forsythe Hall will be
opened up to students, the in
structional computer crunch
will probably remain.
