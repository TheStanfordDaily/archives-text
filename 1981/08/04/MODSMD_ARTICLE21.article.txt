## Recognize difference among repressive states 
### 
Repression is repression and
torture is torture. Tyranny is
tyranny, and we who condemn
one form ot oppression can
hardly condone others. There is
great variety, however, in the
hundred or so nations that can
be called nondemocratic, with
all degrees of unfreedom, arbi
trary rule, cruelty, and suffoca
tion. It is a gross error to say
that political freedom is, like
pregnancy, either present or

OPINIONS

absent. There are all degrees
and mixtures.
But governments are not
merely'to be laid out on a spec
trum from the least oppressive
— perhaps the Swiss — to the
most oppressive — such as those
ot Joseph Stalin and Idi Amin. of
blessed memory. Dealing with
dictatorial regimes is com
plicated by the fact that there
are two main types, the tradi
tionalist-rightist (ot which the
Argentine may be taken as a
typical example) and the radi
cal-revolutionary-leftist (ot
which Cuba and Vietnam are
typical.)
The procedures ot the two
species of dictatorships are fre
quently similar, but they are in
numerous ways antithetical.
The first rejects democracy in
the name ot traditional values,
efficiency, and social order; the
second claims to overthrow de
mocracy (or the capitalistic ec
onomic order associated with
it) in the name ot justice and the
true values of the people, and is
theoretically egalitarian.
This difference has many con

sequences. The more conserva
tive dictatorship attempts to as
sert a rather traditional and his
torically accepted kind of au
thority — and hence might be
characterized as "aimior
itarian." The radical-revolu
tionary dictatorship aspires t<?
change society completely,
hence claims total control, and
may be characterized as "total
itarian." The authoritarian
state relies mostly on persons of

upper class or at least socially
respectable background: the to
talitarian recruits persons of no
standing in the older society,
persons whose loyalty to the
new regime is assured by the
fact that it represents career
and status.
The totalitarian state is cor
respondingly much more con
cerned with doctrine as justifi
cation for social change and the
rulership of persons without
traditional position. The total
itarians are likewise much
more concerned to present
themselves as protagonists of a
universal faith and to spread
their politics if not their sway.
As a result, the totalitarian
rulers insist that everyone and
everything under their control
serve their supposedly sacred
purposes. Everyone in a com
munist state, practically speak
ing, works for the state; and the
press is constrained not merely
to retrain from undesired
criticism but to promote the
cause from the first page to the
last. Competitive ideas are
anathema, religion and

churches are tolerated onjy so
tar as it is not feasible to pro
hibit them.
In the authoritarian state, on
the contrary, there is no such
pressure. People are free to
please themselves, generally
speaking, as long as they stay
out of politics; and the economy
is loosely structured, guided
mostly bv the market and based
on private ownership. The press
is censored onlv to exclude ma-

terial subversive or critical of
the government; otherwise peo
ple talk and write freely.
Because of their fervent call
for a new order and the building
of Utopia, the totalitarians (at
least those of Marxist per
suasion) have had a remarkable
appeal to Western intellectuals.
Their credulity in the claims of
Stalinism and Maoism has been
phenomenal, and it they have
generally become mdre skep
tical it has probably been less
because of the advent of wisdom
than because heirs of th£ once
inspiring tyrants have spattered
them with mud and because
progress toward the Utopia has
been slight or negative.
The intellectual community
remains, however, determined
to believe the best of those who
claim to act on behalf of the
masses or the workers and to
forgive or condone their sins.
The faults of the authoritarians,
on the other hand, are judged
the more rigorously as they rep
resent the sort of powerful peo
ple, owners of brass hats, whom
the intellectuals are likely to re

sent in thier own society.
From the point of view of
American foreign policy, how
ever, the situation is approx
imately reversed. The total
itarians, aided and encouraged
by the Soviet Union, are the big
gest apparent menace to world
order. Their societies are much
more closed and alien to ours (a
reason for discontented intellec
tuals to regard them kindly),
and they are apparently more
fixed.
Authoritarian states, indeed,
often claim to be working gradu
ally toward a restoration of de
mocracy, as do Argentina. Bra
zil, Chile, and Uruguay. The to
talitarian states deny any such
evolutionary possibility, claim
ing that they are already su
premely democratic in a higher
sense.

From this contradiction a
clash naturally arises, as a
pragmatic administration in
Washington views the faults of
the totalitarian states very
clearly and looks away from
those of the authoritarians,
while many ot its critics do the
reverse. A rational approach re
quires due attention to the in
decencies of both species, with
recognition ot the tact that the
totalitarian persuasion presents
Doth more ot a danger and a
much broader deprivation,
Individual Argentines suffer
as much as individual East Ger
mans. but Argentina needs no
elaborate wall with minefields,
barbed wire, and guard towers
to keep its population prisoner.

Repression is repression and

great variety, however, in the

that political freedom is, like

dictatorial regimes is com
plicated by the fact that there
are two main types, the tradi
tionalist-rightist (ot which the
Argentine may be taken as a
typical example) and the radi
cal-revolutionary-leftist (ot
which Cuba and Vietnam are
typical.)
The procedures ot the two
species of dictatorships are fre
quently similar, but they are in
numerous ways antithetical.
The first rejects democracy in
the name ot traditional values,
efficiency, and social order; the
second claims to overthrow de
mocracy (or the capitalistic ec
onomic order associated with
it) in the name ot justice and the
true values of the people, and is
theoretically egalitarian.
This difference has many con

sequences. The more conserva
tive dictatorship attempts to as
sert a rather traditional and his
torically accepted kind of au
thority — and hence might be
characterized as "aimior
itarian." The radical-revolu
tionary dictatorship aspires t<?
change society completely,
hence claims total control, and
may be characterized as "total
itarian." The authoritarian
state relies mostly on persons of

upper class or at least socially
respectable background: the to
talitarian recruits persons of no
standing in the older society,
persons whose loyalty to the
new regime is assured by the
fact that it represents career
and status.
The totalitarian state is cor
respondingly much more con
cerned with doctrine as justifi
cation for social change and the
rulership of persons without
traditional position. The total
itarians are likewise much
more concerned to present
themselves as protagonists of a
universal faith and to spread
their politics if not their sway.
As a result, the totalitarian
rulers insist that everyone and
everything under their control
serve their supposedly sacred
purposes. Everyone in a com
munist state, practically speak
ing, works for the state; and the
press is constrained not merely
to retrain from undesired
criticism but to promote the
cause from the first page to the
last. Competitive ideas are
anathema, religion and

churches are tolerated onjy so
tar as it is not feasible to pro
hibit them.
In the authoritarian state, on
the contrary, there is no such
pressure. People are free to
please themselves, generally
speaking, as long as they stay
out of politics; and the economy
is loosely structured, guided
mostly bv the market and based
on private ownership. The press
is censored onlv to exclude ma-

terial subversive or critical of
the government; otherwise peo
