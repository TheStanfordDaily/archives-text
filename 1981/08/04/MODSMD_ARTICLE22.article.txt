Supreme Court
James Boucher's attack on
the United States Supreme
Court (Daily, July 31) is an out
rage. In essence, Boucher has
called for a Court which re
sponds instantly to the whim of
the populace: a Court that is
sues only*popular decisions.
Lest we assign mystical
powers to the "will ot the peo
ple," consider these historical
expressions of the public's
"democratic" mood: decades
of Jim Crow laws in the South:
brutal suppression of strikes,
justified by hysterical cries of
"Communist-inspired"; con
centration camps tor Japanese-
Americans during the Second
World War; harassment of Iran
ians in recent months.
Boucher specifically con
demns the Court for abolishing
public school prayer, on the
basis that "America is basically

a religious society ..." He has
clearly no grasp of the issue at
stake Public schools are gov
ernmental creations, and the
Constitution torbids estab
lishment of religion. This ap
plies as much to Boucher's
"non-denominational moment
of silence" as to the drug fiends
turned Jesus freaks who were
allowed to preach at my high
school in (enlightened) South
ern California.
This society already has
enough judges elected by mean
spirited citizens anxious to pre
serve the status quo, which can
be characterized, to paraphrase
George Orwell, as some people
are more equal than others Let
us hope that the Supreme Court
and other appeals courts can
rise above this morass and bring
into reality the Founding
Fathers' "self-evident" truths.
