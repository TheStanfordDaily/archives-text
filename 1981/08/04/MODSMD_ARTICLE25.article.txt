### Tony Kelly Charles Buckley 
The Psychedelic Furs in San
ta XJruz. The Psychedelic Furs?
In| Santa Cruz? Gee whiz.
Hunter S. should we have
brought along some peyote?
Richard Butler, lead
singer/songwriter tor the Furs,
looks at his companions at the
Pasatiempo Inn bar as if they
two stains on the counter
at a greasy spoon. "We're the
Psychedelic Furs. We're not
psychedelic revival. That's an
indention of journalists who
haven't got enough imagination.
They just want to put into a cate
gory and suck people into a
scene."
Mhoops. Even before our first
drinks have arrived. Butler has
made it clear that this is not
going to be one of those typical
interviews lot of catchy
phrases and snpi bon mots that
show nothing more than the
fatigue of the person being in-
'Hiroughout our con

This sort of purposeful am
biguity is the key to the Furs'
fnusic, or at least to the music
played onstage at the Catalyst,
pke any rock band, the Psy
§Nsg|lic Furs are more than the
at their parts, but imagine

the music.
Intentional or not, thsre is a
definite psychedelic influence
gnwtd, especially in the
hyprafc buildups to songs on
' ' groups' first album. Bu< just
'■ insistent are the punk sensi*

the group formed.
The band's songs reflect a
tearing down of society for the
future purpose of rebuilding, ac
cording to Butler, "You can get
down to a point of view by
negatives. You cut all the
negatives, say 'I dontlifcethat,
I don't need that" and then you
might get to a point of view,"
At the same time, the band
exists mainly because of an al
ienation felt by Butler during
the original punk movement in
Britain,"l'm disappointed in
anyone who likes to be labelled
as 'a punk.' they're preaching
about individuality and they're
all dressing exactly the same.''
In the interview Butler was
ambiguous, contradictory and
* individualist, The same terms
.. apply to Butler's ringing.
But tf he is non-musical it is ■
p in the most musical/content
since Lou Reed's da|g under- '
ground with the Velvets. Ukb'
of the song, either chant
ing along with the rhytNttj Of
slid® neatly between instl||®
ments.
The result is stirring onstage, "
especially when Butler points
accusingly at the audience
while asserting his own search
tor negatives. He demands that
they work things out for them
selves and do not depend on a
rock singer tor answers.
Meanwhile back at the bar.
Richard is becoming more dif-

fictilt to hear. No, he's not rej
mumbling to heightpr
ijfp mystery (did I hear someone

"We Love Vou"(and if you still

Man" and eat yotfr thoughts)
with a seHes of added lyrics,
Butler heightens the mystery by
storming oft the stage in what
appears to be a genuine temper

The reason why is unclear.
(More ambiguity?) The full
house at the Catalyst seemed to

the show. But where tfio stones
have deteridlated into a new
too rich to rock — Rich-

was reminiscent enough ol
David Bowte's theatrics to
make one forget that the "Thin

0m the stage in a perversely
cynical dance. Butler took comr
mand over the audience in a way
rarely seen in esoteric Bngiish
nands.
Contributing to the over
whelming effect of the show was
the truly psychedelic visual ele
ment. Throughout the per
formance, a screen behind the
band housed a series of colorful

into a modern-sounding song
like "Pulse" accompanied by a

si robe light effect.
Enjoyable as the show was. it
was easy to see why Sutler feels
that the British press fend to re

can't label us." The songs from

Ii there were any complaints
at all about the (.'a Utiys* show. it
would bt> that the show was too
well planned and went too
smoothly as if the Furs had
been doing it over and over
again each night and the show
had become overly polished.
Polished ambiguity 9 Does
that make sense? So macb for
attaching labels. Since this arti
cle is already too far past its
deadline for comfort perhaps
its better that wo head home
put or, some Fur songs, and ap
prcciate some of the finest ma
ferial coming out of England
right now. rather than to talk,
talk, talk.
