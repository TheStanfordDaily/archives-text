# A 						guide to some of the best Bay Area used record stores
## 
### Gina Arnold 
With record prices soaring
these days, record collectors
are fast becoming an obsolete
breed. Rather than giving up
popular music altogether, more
and more people are turning to
used record stores as a viable al
ternative to selling their stereos
or going broke.
Along with a plethora of tap
ing clubs, used record dealing —
buying and selling records from
stores which deal exclusively
with used trade — is a great way
to break even on your record
collecting habit.
There are many reasons for
shopping used besides mere
profiteering. For one thing,
shopping in used stores is defi
nitely more pleasant than shop
ping in Tower Records. Chain
stores like Tower are generally
roomy, clean, and plastered
with posters of ugly faces like
those of Rex Smith and Christ
opher Cross. They are also full
of unattractive teenage cus
tomers with filthy hair, Grate
ful Dead T-shirts, and more
than often than not. Black Sab
bath belt buckles.
Last but not least, chain
stores play rotten music, since
they invariably have play lists.
Used stores, on the other
hand, are full of amiable people
whose interests are often simi
lar to yours, the potential cus
tomer. They are generally
small, cramped, and not always
very nicely vacuumed, but they
have a pleasant atmosphere
conducive to browsing. They
also play better music, and usu
ally have exciting decor utili
zing posters of groups which one
might conceivably like.
If you are considering ventur
ing forth into used records land
either to buy or to sell used rec
ords, there are several factors
one must keep in mind. First,
there is the question of quality
of the records which varies, but
in general, you gets what you
pays tor.
Basically, quality depends on
price. At most stores, especially
the larger ones, like Rasputins
in Berkely, you can choose any
of six copies of a record, for
prices ranging from 99 cents to
four or five dollars, depending
on the surface quality and age of
the copy. No store we spoke to,
however, tests any of its
purchases tor skips or
scratches, relying solely on
sight tests, so prepare yourself
tor some nasty shocks no matter
how nice your "new" record
looks.
The second factor to consider
when buying or selling used rec
ords is selection. Used record
stores look for current hit rec

ords in good condition. All the
stores we spoke to offer be
tween two and three dollars for
new releases, and 25 percent
more in trade. As for ijuving
used. well, most stores have
almost as good a selection as
chain stores. They are
more comprehensive, since
chain stores much order direct
ly trom distributors and must
take a loss on anv album they
don't sell.
If you are looking for an ob
scure or out-of-print album, a
used store is a better bet. Used
stores generally have a full
catalogue of records by prolific
groups like the Rolling Stones,
whereas Tower might have the
last three hits plus Let It Bleed.
For more current albums by
popular artists like Bruce
Springsteen, you may have to
wait a tew days till it reaches
the bins.
Needless to say. used record
stores pay the most for records
by big name groups. Every
store we visited insisted they
pay the highest prices, but in
fact, we found only minor dif
ferences in prices at each store,
by pricing a group of records
ranging from new'good (Elvis
Costello) to old crummy Coun
try .loe and the Fish).
Every store stipulated that
they paid more in trade than
cash, and that they were willing
to bargain. Some stores told us
the price they were planning to
sell our record for — seldom
less than a 100 percent mark up;
and requested albums by the
Beatles. Pink Floyd, and Bruce
Springsteen, always in short
supply. A hint to the wise — you
get a lot more money if you sell
a group of records than it you
sell one at a time.
Following is a store by store
rundown of some of the used
record stores in the Bay Area.
This is not a comprehensive list
by any means, but it will do in a
pinch.
CHIMAERA RECORDS cor
ner of Lytton and Kipling, Paio
Alto. (327-1122) Chimaera rec
ords is the most nouveau rock
place in Palo Alto — or at least it
thinks it is, and has been for
years. Recently updated,
Chimaera has become less of
the hippie haunt its name im
plies and much more on top of
the music scene than it has been
in years past.
Chimaera doesn't have the
best selection either of new or
used records. The new arrivals
section is your best bet tor any
decent listening, but be tore
warned that Chimaera boasts
numerous locals who check out
the bins daily and snatch up all
that is of interest before they

have time to settle. Besides hav
mg a limited selection,
Chimaera, having had the cor
ner on the market for so long, is
also overpriced and uppity.
Four dollars for a new copy of a
so-so album isn't such a deal
elsewhere.
The salespeople at Chimaera
have a disconcerting manner of
sneering both at your purchases
and your person, as well as
being rude about records you
oring in to sell.
Still. Chimaera has one great
advantage. It gets a fair amount
of collectors records — so
called tanclub albums. If you
can stand the humiliation that
the snooty employees heap upon
your meagre purchases,
Chimaera is worth a look.
RECYCLED RECORDS, 550
Cowper St., Palo Alto.
(321-3806) Recycled Records in
Palo Alto, behind the New
Varsity on Cowper Street is as
well stocked as its sister stores
in San Francisco and has the
same intelligent and friendly
ambience. It is just over a
month old. and its newness con
tributes to its excellent selec
tion of records and singles. They
have the most comprehensive
selection ot new wave singles in
Palo Alto, among other things.
The first store in downtown
Palo Alto to challenge
Chimaera's long-time hold on
the used record business, Re
cycled has a chance of compet
ing because of its solid San
Francisco reputation and be
cause it is only two blocks from
its rival — within figurative
spitting distance. A good thing
to keep in mind when shopping
tor used records — if you can't
find it at Chimaera, try Re
cycled. You might be surprised
at the difference.
RECYCLED RECORDS, 1415
Grant St., San Francisco.
(982-5442) Recycled Records on
upper Grant Avenue was one of
the first successful used record
stores in the area, and helped,
by its professional and complete
record bind, to remove the stig
ma from used record stores in
general.
Johnny, at the Grant Street
store, informed us that Re
cycled often undersells new
wave and import singles — one
way to help support the people
who help to support them. This
kind of honest policy which does
not seek to maximize profit at
the expense ot the customer, is
the kind of thing that has made
record barter such a burgeoning
business: low-key, enjoyable,
and popular. Recycle on Grant
is in a nice area — between the
Cafe Trieste and Washington
Square Park in North Beach,

across from the Savor Tivali.
Recycled has a leg up on the
competition when it comes to
having used punk/new wave sin
gles. and current releases. They
also carry used classical and
jazz albums, with a great selec
tion in all areas.
Berkeley, however, is a dif
ferent story. The self-pro
claimed capital of the used rec
ord store industry, it houses
three of the best record stores in
California all on the same block.
Berkeley record stores are a
whole other calibre than piddl
ing old Palo Alto and even S.F.
stores. We talked to employees
at all three, and the slagging of
the competition was continuous
and good-natured.
The biggest and most famous
of these stores is RASPUTINS,
at 2333 Telegraph Ave.
(848-9004). Rasputins is the size
of a large warehouse, and there
is a whole other store down the
street just for Soul and Jazz rec
ords. At the rock store there is a
vast collection of bargain bins —
row upon row, in fact, of dollar
records. They also sell used and
new tapes. T-shirts, buttons,
magazines, singles, and all
trade got off selling used albums
can be used on anything in the
store.
Every other store in the Bay
Area that we spoke to pointed an
accusatory finger at Rasputins,
calling them unscrupulous, im
personal, and dishonest, but we
suspect that they are just
jealous of Rasputin's vastness.
Two doors down from
Rasputins and just two doors up
from campus is UNIVERSAL
RECORDS, 23091/2 Telegraph
Ave. (540-9970). The so-called
punque hangout of Berkeley,
Universal prides itself as Marc,
a punk musician of a not so well
known band Jars, told us, on

"Being the only store that
knows its customers by name."
Marc considers Universal a
haven for "anyone with non
mainstream taste," but he
forgets to mention that, if you
are over 6, the average age of
Universal's customers, or your
hair is the wrong length or color,
and your taste doesn't lean
toward Jars-like punk rock, you
will not feel very welcome here.
The hangers-out at Universal
can get downright ornery it you
look "trendy," and they vocally
express disdain at most
purchases. Universal does buy
records at good prices, and they
have the best "exotic tan club
material" (live records) North
of Isla Vista, as well as good
photographs, buttons, and mag
azines.
Around the corner from Uni
versal is LEOPOLD'S MINT
PLATTER, 2518 Durant Ave,
Berkeley, 848-2015, a used rec
ord store which also houses an
excellent taping club For an $8
membership fee, patrons can
rent any album in the store for
75 cents, to tape. Albums can be
kept tor up to five days, and
upon leaving, members are re
funded their fee or are allowed
to take one new record for free.
It's a great deal for those who
have good tape system. Both
Berrigan and Brown, and Uni
versal have similar, but more
expensive services.
The result of all these stores
and clubs may very well be driv
ing new record prices up. After
all, this is music at a discount.
No longer may the public com
plain of the high cost of records.
There are so many ways to min
imize the cost and maximize the
enjoyment of popular music,
there is now no excuse tor not
keeping abreast of current mu
sic trends!

RECORDS, 23091/2 Telegraph
Ave. (540-9970). The so-called
punque hangout of Berkeley,
Universal prides itself as Marc,
a punk musician of a not so well
known band Jars, told us, on

"Being the only store that
knows its customers by name."
Marc considers Universal a
haven for "anyone with non
mainstream taste," but he
forgets to mention that, if you
are over 6, the average age of
Universal's customers, or your
hair is the wrong length or color,
and your taste doesn't lean
toward Jars-like punk rock, you
will not feel very welcome here.
The hangers-out at Universal
can get downright ornery it you
look "trendy," and they vocally
express disdain at most
purchases. Universal does buy
records at good prices, and they
have the best "exotic tan club
material" (live records) North
of Isla Vista, as well as good
photographs, buttons, and mag
azines.
Around the corner from Uni
versal is LEOPOLD'S MINT
PLATTER, 2518 Durant Ave,
Berkeley, 848-2015, a used rec
ord store which also houses an
excellent taping club For an $8
membership fee, patrons can
rent any album in the store for
75 cents, to tape. Albums can be
kept tor up to five days, and
upon leaving, members are re
funded their fee or are allowed
to take one new record for free.
It's a great deal for those who
have good tape system. Both
Berrigan and Brown, and Uni
versal have similar, but more
expensive services.
The result of all these stores
and clubs may very well be driv
ing new record prices up. After
all, this is music at a discount.
No longer may the public com
plain of the high cost of records.
There are so many ways to min
imize the cost and maximize the
enjoyment of popular music,
there is now no excuse tor not
keeping abreast of current mu
sic trends!

With record prices soaring
these days, record collectors
are fast becoming an obsolete
breed. Rather than giving up
popular music altogether, more
and more people are turning to
used record stores as a viable al
ternative to selling their stereos
or going broke.
Along with a plethora of tap
ing clubs, used record dealing —
buying and selling records from
stores which deal exclusively
with used trade — is a great way
to break even on your record
collecting habit.
There are many reasons for
shopping used besides mere
profiteering. For one thing,
shopping in used stores is defi
nitely more pleasant than shop
ping in Tower Records. Chain
stores like Tower are generally
roomy, clean, and plastered
with posters of ugly faces like
those of Rex Smith and Christ
opher Cross. They are also full
of unattractive teenage cus
tomers with filthy hair, Grate
ful Dead T-shirts, and more
than often than not. Black Sab
bath belt buckles.
Last but not least, chain
stores play rotten music, since
they invariably have play lists.
Used stores, on the other
hand, are full of amiable people
whose interests are often simi
lar to yours, the potential cus
tomer. They are generally
small, cramped, and not always
very nicely vacuumed, but they
have a pleasant atmosphere
conducive to browsing. They
also play better music, and usu
ally have exciting decor utili
zing posters of groups which one
might conceivably like.
If you are considering ventur
ing forth into used records land
either to buy or to sell used rec
ords, there are several factors
one must keep in mind. First,
there is the question of quality
of the records which varies, but
in general, you gets what you
pays tor.
Basically, quality depends on
price. At most stores, especially
the larger ones, like Rasputins
in Berkely, you can choose any
of six copies of a record, for
prices ranging from 99 cents to
four or five dollars, depending
on the surface quality and age of
the copy. No store we spoke to,
however, tests any of its
purchases tor skips or
scratches, relying solely on
sight tests, so prepare yourself
tor some nasty shocks no matter
how nice your "new" record
looks.
The second factor to consider
when buying or selling used rec
ords is selection. Used record
stores look for current hit rec

ords in good condition. All the
stores we spoke to offer be
tween two and three dollars for
new releases, and 25 percent
more in trade. As for ijuving
used. well, most stores have
almost as good a selection as
chain stores. They are
more comprehensive, since
chain stores much order direct
ly trom distributors and must
take a loss on anv album they
don't sell.
If you are looking for an ob
scure or out-of-print album, a
used store is a better bet. Used
stores generally have a full
catalogue of records by prolific
groups like the Rolling Stones,
whereas Tower might have the
last three hits plus Let It Bleed.
For more current albums by
popular artists like Bruce
Springsteen, you may have to
wait a tew days till it reaches
the bins.
Needless to say. used record
stores pay the most for records
by big name groups. Every
store we visited insisted they
pay the highest prices, but in
fact, we found only minor dif
ferences in prices at each store,
by pricing a group of records
ranging from new'good (Elvis
Costello) to old crummy Coun
try .loe and the Fish).
Every store stipulated that
they paid more in trade than
cash, and that they were willing
to bargain. Some stores told us
the price they were planning to
sell our record for — seldom
less than a 100 percent mark up;
and requested albums by the
Beatles. Pink Floyd, and Bruce
Springsteen, always in short
supply. A hint to the wise — you
get a lot more money if you sell
a group of records than it you
sell one at a time.
Following is a store by store
rundown of some of the used
record stores in the Bay Area.
This is not a comprehensive list
by any means, but it will do in a
pinch.
CHIMAERA RECORDS cor
ner of Lytton and Kipling, Paio
Alto. (327-1122) Chimaera rec
ords is the most nouveau rock
place in Palo Alto — or at least it
thinks it is, and has been for
years. Recently updated,
Chimaera has become less of
the hippie haunt its name im
plies and much more on top of
the music scene than it has been
in years past.
Chimaera doesn't have the
best selection either of new or
used records. The new arrivals
section is your best bet tor any
decent listening, but be tore
warned that Chimaera boasts
numerous locals who check out
the bins daily and snatch up all
that is of interest before they

have time to settle. Besides hav
mg a limited selection,
Chimaera, having had the cor
ner on the market for so long, is
also overpriced and uppity.
Four dollars for a new copy of a
so-so album isn't such a deal
elsewhere.
The salespeople at Chimaera
have a disconcerting manner of
sneering both at your purchases
and your person, as well as
being rude about records you
oring in to sell.
Still. Chimaera has one great
advantage. It gets a fair amount
of collectors records — so
called tanclub albums. If you
can stand the humiliation that
the snooty employees heap upon
your meagre purchases,
Chimaera is worth a look.
RECYCLED RECORDS, 550
Cowper St., Palo Alto.
(321-3806) Recycled Records in
Palo Alto, behind the New
Varsity on Cowper Street is as
well stocked as its sister stores
in San Francisco and has the
same intelligent and friendly
ambience. It is just over a
month old. and its newness con
tributes to its excellent selec
tion of records and singles. They
have the most comprehensive
selection ot new wave singles in
Palo Alto, among other things.
The first store in downtown
Palo Alto to challenge
Chimaera's long-time hold on
the used record business, Re
cycled has a chance of compet
ing because of its solid San
Francisco reputation and be
cause it is only two blocks from
its rival — within figurative
spitting distance. A good thing
to keep in mind when shopping
tor used records — if you can't
find it at Chimaera, try Re
cycled. You might be surprised
at the difference.
RECYCLED RECORDS, 1415
Grant St., San Francisco.
(982-5442) Recycled Records on
upper Grant Avenue was one of
the first successful used record
stores in the area, and helped,
by its professional and complete
record bind, to remove the stig
ma from used record stores in
general.
Johnny, at the Grant Street
store, informed us that Re
cycled often undersells new
wave and import singles — one
way to help support the people
who help to support them. This
kind of honest policy which does
not seek to maximize profit at
the expense ot the customer, is
the kind of thing that has made
record barter such a burgeoning
business: low-key, enjoyable,
and popular. Recycle on Grant
is in a nice area — between the
Cafe Trieste and Washington
Square Park in North Beach,

across from the Savor Tivali.
Recycled has a leg up on the
competition when it comes to
having used punk/new wave sin
gles. and current releases. They
also carry used classical and
jazz albums, with a great selec
tion in all areas.
Berkeley, however, is a dif
ferent story. The self-pro
claimed capital of the used rec
ord store industry, it houses
three of the best record stores in
California all on the same block.
Berkeley record stores are a
whole other calibre than piddl
ing old Palo Alto and even S.F.
stores. We talked to employees
at all three, and the slagging of
the competition was continuous
and good-natured.
The biggest and most famous
of these stores is RASPUTINS,
at 2333 Telegraph Ave.
(848-9004). Rasputins is the size
of a large warehouse, and there
is a whole other store down the
street just for Soul and Jazz rec
ords. At the rock store there is a
vast collection of bargain bins —
row upon row, in fact, of dollar
records. They also sell used and
new tapes. T-shirts, buttons,
magazines, singles, and all
trade got off selling used albums
can be used on anything in the
store.
Every other store in the Bay
Area that we spoke to pointed an
accusatory finger at Rasputins,
calling them unscrupulous, im
personal, and dishonest, but we
suspect that they are just
jealous of Rasputin's vastness.
Two doors down from
Rasputins and just two doors up
from campus is UNIVERSAL

wave and import singles — one
way to help support the people
who help to support them. This
kind of honest policy which does
not seek to maximize profit at
the expense ot the customer, is
the kind of thing that has made
record barter such a burgeoning
business: low-key, enjoyable,
and popular. Recycle on Grant
is in a nice area — between the
Cafe Trieste and Washington
Square Park in North Beach,

across from the Savor Tivali.
Recycled has a leg up on the
competition when it comes to
having used punk/new wave sin
gles. and current releases. They
also carry used classical and
jazz albums, with a great selec
tion in all areas.
Berkeley, however, is a dif
ferent story. The self-pro
claimed capital of the used rec
ord store industry, it houses
three of the best record stores in
California all on the same block.
Berkeley record stores are a
whole other calibre than piddl
ing old Palo Alto and even S.F.
stores. We talked to employees
at all three, and the slagging of
the competition was continuous
and good-natured.
The biggest and most famous
of these stores is RASPUTINS,
at 2333 Telegraph Ave.
(848-9004). Rasputins is the size
of a large warehouse, and there
is a whole other store down the
street just for Soul and Jazz rec
ords. At the rock store there is a
vast collection of bargain bins —
row upon row, in fact, of dollar
records. They also sell used and
new tapes. T-shirts, buttons,
magazines, singles, and all
trade got off selling used albums
can be used on anything in the
store.
Every other store in the Bay
Area that we spoke to pointed an
accusatory finger at Rasputins,
calling them unscrupulous, im
personal, and dishonest, but we
suspect that they are just
jealous of Rasputin's vastness.
Two doors down from
Rasputins and just two doors up
from campus is UNIVERSAL
RECORDS, 23091/2 Telegraph
Ave. (540-9970). The so-called
punque hangout of Berkeley,
Universal prides itself as Marc,
a punk musician of a not so well
known band Jars, told us, on

"Being the only store that
knows its customers by name."
Marc considers Universal a
haven for "anyone with non
mainstream taste," but he
forgets to mention that, if you
are over 6, the average age of
Universal's customers, or your
hair is the wrong length or color,
and your taste doesn't lean
toward Jars-like punk rock, you
will not feel very welcome here.
The hangers-out at Universal
can get downright ornery it you
look "trendy," and they vocally
express disdain at most
purchases. Universal does buy
records at good prices, and they
have the best "exotic tan club
material" (live records) North
of Isla Vista, as well as good
photographs, buttons, and mag
azines.
Around the corner from Uni
versal is LEOPOLD'S MINT
PLATTER, 2518 Durant Ave,
Berkeley, 848-2015, a used rec
ord store which also houses an
excellent taping club For an $8
membership fee, patrons can
rent any album in the store for
75 cents, to tape. Albums can be
kept tor up to five days, and
upon leaving, members are re
funded their fee or are allowed
to take one new record for free.
It's a great deal for those who
have good tape system. Both
Berrigan and Brown, and Uni
versal have similar, but more
expensive services.
The result of all these stores
and clubs may very well be driv
ing new record prices up. After
all, this is music at a discount.
No longer may the public com
plain of the high cost of records.
There are so many ways to min
imize the cost and maximize the
enjoyment of popular music,
there is now no excuse tor not
keeping abreast of current mu
sic trends!

With record prices soaring
these days, record collectors
are fast becoming an obsolete
breed. Rather than giving up
popular music altogether, more
and more people are turning to
used record stores as a viable al
ternative to selling their stereos
or going broke.
Along with a plethora of tap
ing clubs, used record dealing —
buying and selling records from
stores which deal exclusively
with used trade — is a great way
to break even on your record
collecting habit.
There are many reasons for
shopping used besides mere
profiteering. For one thing,
shopping in used stores is defi
nitely more pleasant than shop
ping in Tower Records. Chain
stores like Tower are generally
roomy, clean, and plastered
with posters of ugly faces like
those of Rex Smith and Christ
opher Cross. They are also full
of unattractive teenage cus
tomers with filthy hair, Grate
ful Dead T-shirts, and more
than often than not. Black Sab
bath belt buckles.
Last but not least, chain
stores play rotten music, since
they invariably have play lists.
Used stores, on the other
hand, are full of amiable people
whose interests are often simi
lar to yours, the potential cus
tomer. They are generally
small, cramped, and not always
very nicely vacuumed, but they
have a pleasant atmosphere
conducive to browsing. They
also play better music, and usu
ally have exciting decor utili
zing posters of groups which one
might conceivably like.
If you are considering ventur
ing forth into used records land
either to buy or to sell used rec
ords, there are several factors
one must keep in mind. First,
there is the question of quality
of the records which varies, but
in general, you gets what you
pays tor.
Basically, quality depends on
price. At most stores, especially
the larger ones, like Rasputins
in Berkely, you can choose any
of six copies of a record, for
prices ranging from 99 cents to
four or five dollars, depending
on the surface quality and age of
the copy. No store we spoke to,
however, tests any of its
purchases tor skips or
scratches, relying solely on
sight tests, so prepare yourself
tor some nasty shocks no matter
how nice your "new" record
looks.
The second factor to consider
when buying or selling used rec
ords is selection. Used record
stores look for current hit rec

ords in good condition. All the
stores we spoke to offer be
tween two and three dollars for
new releases, and 25 percent
more in trade. As for ijuving
used. well, most stores have
almost as good a selection as
chain stores. They are
more comprehensive, since
chain stores much order direct
ly trom distributors and must
take a loss on anv album they
don't sell.
If you are looking for an ob
scure or out-of-print album, a
used store is a better bet. Used
stores generally have a full
catalogue of records by prolific
groups like the Rolling Stones,
whereas Tower might have the
last three hits plus Let It Bleed.
For more current albums by
popular artists like Bruce
Springsteen, you may have to
wait a tew days till it reaches
the bins.
Needless to say. used record
stores pay the most for records
by big name groups. Every
store we visited insisted they
pay the highest prices, but in
fact, we found only minor dif
ferences in prices at each store,
by pricing a group of records
ranging from new'good (Elvis
Costello) to old crummy Coun
try .loe and the Fish).
Every store stipulated that
they paid more in trade than
cash, and that they were willing
to bargain. Some stores told us
the price they were planning to
sell our record for — seldom
less than a 100 percent mark up;
and requested albums by the
Beatles. Pink Floyd, and Bruce
Springsteen, always in short
supply. A hint to the wise — you
get a lot more money if you sell
a group of records than it you
sell one at a time.
Following is a store by store
rundown of some of the used
record stores in the Bay Area.
This is not a comprehensive list
by any means, but it will do in a
pinch.
CHIMAERA RECORDS cor
ner of Lytton and Kipling, Paio
Alto. (327-1122) Chimaera rec
ords is the most nouveau rock
place in Palo Alto — or at least it
thinks it is, and has been for
years. Recently updated,
Chimaera has become less of
the hippie haunt its name im
plies and much more on top of
the music scene than it has been
in years past.
Chimaera doesn't have the
best selection either of new or
used records. The new arrivals
section is your best bet tor any
decent listening, but be tore
warned that Chimaera boasts
numerous locals who check out
the bins daily and snatch up all
that is of interest before they

have time to settle. Besides hav
mg a limited selection,
Chimaera, having had the cor
ner on the market for so long, is
also overpriced and uppity.
Four dollars for a new copy of a
so-so album isn't such a deal
elsewhere.
The salespeople at Chimaera
have a disconcerting manner of
sneering both at your purchases
and your person, as well as
being rude about records you
oring in to sell.
Still. Chimaera has one great
advantage. It gets a fair amount
of collectors records — so
called tanclub albums. If you
can stand the humiliation that
the snooty employees heap upon
your meagre purchases,
Chimaera is worth a look.
RECYCLED RECORDS, 550
Cowper St., Palo Alto.
(321-3806) Recycled Records in
Palo Alto, behind the New
Varsity on Cowper Street is as
well stocked as its sister stores
in San Francisco and has the
same intelligent and friendly
ambience. It is just over a
month old. and its newness con
tributes to its excellent selec
tion of records and singles. They
have the most comprehensive
selection ot new wave singles in
Palo Alto, among other things.
The first store in downtown
Palo Alto to challenge
Chimaera's long-time hold on
the used record business, Re
cycled has a chance of compet
ing because of its solid San
Francisco reputation and be
cause it is only two blocks from
its rival — within figurative
spitting distance. A good thing
to keep in mind when shopping
tor used records — if you can't
find it at Chimaera, try Re
cycled. You might be surprised
at the difference.
RECYCLED RECORDS, 1415
Grant St., San Francisco.
(982-5442) Recycled Records on
upper Grant Avenue was one of
the first successful used record
stores in the area, and helped,
by its professional and complete
record bind, to remove the stig
ma from used record stores in
general.
