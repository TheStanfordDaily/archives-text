Senate approves Reagan tax cut
Washington — The Senate yesterday approved
the largest tax cut in history, 67-8. after rejecting
an effort by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to
trim tax relief for the oil industry that he said
would cost the government an estimated $33
billion in revenue over the next decade.
Kennedy was defeated 55-20 in his attempt to
send the compromise bill back to a Senate-House
conference committee to lower the oil-related tax
relief.
The bill now goes to the House, which is ex
pected to adopt it by an overwhelming vote today
and send it to the White House for President
Ronald Reagan to sign into law tomorrow.
It includes a 3-year, across-the-board tax cut of
25 percent for individuals and major cuts in busi
ness taxes, for a total reduction of $750 billion be
tween now and 1986.
The bill, the cornerstone of Reagan's economic
recovery program, was adopted with large
bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and
House last week despite claims by House Demo
cratic leaders that it favored the rich.
The pleas from Kennedy and others to act
against the relief provisions for the oil industry
generally went ignored in a session yesterday
marked by heavy absenteeism because of the air
controllers' strike and the rush for adjournment
of Congress this week.
"When we are asking schoolchildren to pay
more for lunches, should we be giving away
billions of dollars to the oil companies?" Kennedy
asked in a nearly empty chamber. "When we are
asking the elderly to give up their minimum So
cial Security benefit of $122 a month, should we be
giving away $33 billion to the oil industry.?"
Polish food talks break down
Warsaw, Poland — Garbage trucks, buses and
taxis jammed Warsaw streets yesterday in a
mass protest of food shortages, and Solidarity
union talks with the government on how to solve
the crisis broke down.
"Today's round of talks have been interrupted
because of the situation in Warsaw," Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa said as he left the four-hour
meeting. Union sources said talks might resume
Thursday.
The meeting began as hundreds of vehicles
flashed lights and blared horns as they snaked
through streets. Many carried red-and-white
Polish flags, union banners and placards.

Drivers festooned vehicles with signs reading
"We Can't Work on an Empty Stomach," "If You
Want Us to Work Let Us Have Food First," "A
Hungry Nation Can Eat the Government," and
"Have Mercy On Our Children."
Police blocked convoys from driving past the
Council of Ministers where Walesa met Deputy
Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the Communist
government's labor troubleshooter.
By evening thousands of spectators gathered as
more than 100 buses and trucks sat in a
line at the city's largest intersection, after police
blocked the route to the site of the talks.

Washington — White House press secretary
James Brady, who was shot in the head when
President Ronald Reagan was wounded March 30,

nounced.

at the hospital, described the seizure as a "sudden
loss of consciousness immediately followed by a

seizure was not uncommon following brain in
juries. He said the impact on Brady could not yet
be assessed.
"It can be very serious or not serious at all," El
lis said. "They are still evaluating how it is affect
ing Mr. Brady."
Speakes said the seizure, known as a "grand
mal seizure," was treated with intravenous medi
cation and anesthesia. Ellis said the anesthesia
was being given as a relaxant.

ward in quiet trading yesterday, succumbing

recovery program, was adopted with large
bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and
House last week despite claims by House Demo
cratic leaders that it favored the rich.
The pleas from Kennedy and others to act
against the relief provisions for the oil industry
generally went ignored in a session yesterday
marked by heavy absenteeism because of the air
controllers' strike and the rush for adjournment
of Congress this week.
"When we are asking schoolchildren to pay
more for lunches, should we be giving away
billions of dollars to the oil companies?" Kennedy
asked in a nearly empty chamber. "When we are
asking the elderly to give up their minimum So
cial Security benefit of $122 a month, should we be
giving away $33 billion to the oil industry.?"
Polish food talks break down
Warsaw, Poland — Garbage trucks, buses and
taxis jammed Warsaw streets yesterday in a
mass protest of food shortages, and Solidarity
union talks with the government on how to solve
the crisis broke down.
"Today's round of talks have been interrupted
because of the situation in Warsaw," Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa said as he left the four-hour
meeting. Union sources said talks might resume
Thursday.
The meeting began as hundreds of vehicles
flashed lights and blared horns as they snaked
through streets. Many carried red-and-white
Polish flags, union banners and placards.

Drivers festooned vehicles with signs reading
"We Can't Work on an Empty Stomach," "If You
Want Us to Work Let Us Have Food First," "A
Hungry Nation Can Eat the Government," and
"Have Mercy On Our Children."
Police blocked convoys from driving past the
Council of Ministers where Walesa met Deputy
Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the Communist
government's labor troubleshooter.
By evening thousands of spectators gathered as
more than 100 buses and trucks sat in a
line at the city's largest intersection, after police
blocked the route to the site of the talks.
