# Faculty selection here complex, effective

### Andres Fajardo 
How has the University been
able to attract, solicit, and
choose a faculty that contains
nine Nobel Prize laureates,
eleven National Medal of Sci
ence winners, four Pulitzer
Prize awardees, 62 National
Academy of Science members
and 98 members of the Ameri
can Academy of Arts and Sci
ences?
The process, as described by
Vice Provost and Dean of Grad
uate Studies and Research
Gerald Lieberman, is no simple
matter. "The first thing that
has to be determined is that
there is a need for a new faculty
member in a certain depart
ment," said Lieberman.
"The department decides it
needs someone after a vacancy
is created either by someone
leaving, retiring or if another
person is needed around that de
partment." That department
then presents its request to the
dean of the particular school.

He or she listens and "decides
whether the area needs more
person power." If the dean
agrees, he or she "talks to the
provost. If he agrees, then the
department hears that answer
and the recruitment starts,"
said Lieberman.
According to Chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment Dr. Robert White, for ev
ery faculty opening in a depart
ment a different "search com
mittee" is formed with the
purpose of recruitment for the
opening. Lieberman said that
recruitment by the search com
mittee "means that the depart
ment would solicit possible ap
plicants by writing to col
leagues at other universities" to
obtain suggestions and recom
mendations. "We require that
departments advertise for the
position in professional publica
tions so that people who are
potential applicants can see the
opening. . . At which point, a
list of applicants is compiled

and reviewed."
This is done by "calling and
writing people that were given
as recommendations," said
member of the Standing Com
mittee on Academic Affairs and
Development Robert Eustis.
"Normally, we don't do that for
everyone, only for about the top
ten candidates (out of 80-100
possibilities). The top five, al
though the number can vary
(School of Education Dean
Myron Atkin put the number at
two or three for his school), are
invited to the University (for
some the trip is paid) for an in
terview" and are asked to give a
seminar "during which the
members of the committee lis
ten to the applicants' in
terests." The top group is
placed in the committee's order
of preference and the top choice
is given a tentative offer by the
department.
The list is given to the dean
who, assuming he or she ap
proves it, gives it to the provost

for approval. The list is trans
ferred to the Advisory Commit
tee. to the President and finally
arrives at the desk of the Board
of Trustees, which rarely
negates the previous recom
mendations.
"Occasionally," said
Lieberman, "a Nobel Prizewin
ner will say that he or she is
available. . . and the affected
department (at Stanford) will
say that it really wants that per
son to come to Stanford Univer
sity and that it wants to make an
offer. In that case, the dean
would probably say 'wonderful'
and the offer would be made
while skipping the whole prov
ost business."
While the process is as slow
as it is extensive and com
plicated, White described the
whole system as a "quality con
trol" which maintains a high
level of excellence through its
laborious procedure. "The pro
cedure we use in the school of
business (which is virtually
identical to that of the other
schools and the one described
above) is effective in identi
fying the best faculty in the
world. . . It is not an im
personal process." commented
Associate Dean of the School of
Business Charles Holloway.
White supports the system in
that "We have gotten more than
sufficient response. . . I think
we're successful in attracting
people we like. The salary for a

PhD is less than on the outside.
There are lucrative trade re
wards in the private industry.
Most schools have trouble (in
getting good quality faculty).
Stanford University has a good
reputation so there is no trouble
in attracting and no trouble in
choosing.
Eustis said,"Hopefully, we
make an offer to the top can
didate (in the process) and they
accept. But with housing so dif
ficult to find, it can be hard to
get the top candidate."
