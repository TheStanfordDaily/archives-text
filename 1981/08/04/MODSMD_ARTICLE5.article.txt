### Daily wire services 
Beirut, Lebanon â€” Iranian
Prime Minister Mohammed Ali
Rajai was confirmed as Iran's
new president Sunday by
Avatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
with a warning there would be
calls for his death if be betrays
the Islamic revolution
According to Pars, the
Avatollah cautioned Rajai
about his new responsibilities
saying. "Should you make a
wrong step, the very 3 million
who voted for you would shout,
Death to you.' This is the na
ture of revolution."
Rajai won the election July 24
in a landslide victory, entitling
him to the presidency which has
been vacant since Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr's impeachment in
June. Rajai, backed by Islamic
clergymen and a longtime foe of
Bani-Sadr, took 88 percent of the
vote. There were three token op
ponents.
From his exile in Paris, Bani-
Sadr has claimed that only
about 15 per cent of the Iranian
population supports Khomeini's

regime and that the election
was rigged.
Bani-Sadr was quoted as
saying in an interview with the
Sunday Times of London that he
was counting on the armed
forces which he led in battle
against neighboring Iraq to "do
their duty" and end Khomeini's
rule.
The ex-president also was
quoted as saying the leftist Mu
jahedeen Khalq underground or
ganization would continue its
assassination campaign against
Khomeini officials throughout
Iran, with Parliament deputies
the top targets.
The interview quoted Bani-
Sadr as saying he would direct
from his Paris refuge a cam
paign of nationwide strikes and
protest marches in Iran against
the fundamentalist regime. He
predicted he would return to
Iran within months.
In an interview broadcast
Sunday on state-run Tehran Ra
dio, Iran's chief military judge,
Hojatoleslam Mohammadi

Reyshahri, said Bani-Sadr's
ouster had "no impact" on mili
tary operations because he had
failed to win the army's al
legiance.
The Western-educated econo
mist escaped to France from a
hideout in Iran on Wednesday.
