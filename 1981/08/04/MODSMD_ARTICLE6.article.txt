# Poorly armed insurgents persist
## Afghanistan:a Soviet stalemate 
### Agence France-Presse 
Islamabad. Pakistan —
Eighteen months after their in
vasion Of Afghanistan. Soviet
forces are concentrating on con
trolling key points, conceding
much ot the country to the in
surgents in order to avoid heavy
losses, most observers who
have toured the country with re
oel groups agree.
Conservative reports esti
mate Soviet casualties at 40)0
killed since arriving in Decem
ber 1979 and insurgent and civil
ian casualties at hundreds of
thousands of dead and wounded.
But the high number of casu
alties does not appear to have
affected morale among the in
surgents. who have kept up at
tacks on Afghan army units —
generally with success when
government forces lacked Sovi
et air support, observers report.

At the same time, enormous
losses in material and the high
cost of maintaining its 85.000-
man force in Aghanistan have
not changed Moscow's attitude
to its presence, diplomatic ob
servers said.
Politically, the spotlight re
mains on policy differences be
tween Afghan President Babrak
Karmal's government in Kabul
and Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq's gov
ernment here.
Karmal maintains the the So
viet intervention was made nec
essary by anti-government
guerrillas who were armed in
Pakistan. Pakistan, admittedly
sympathetic to the rebels, says
the revolt was an inevitable re
sult ot the Soviets' arrival.
Bases in Pakistan
No foreigners have been en
countered among fighting men,
but the rebel groups are well es
tablished in Pakistan. Most
have set up headquarters here,
and refugees regularly come to
regain breath at international
camps and then return to the
fray.
Karmal has also accused Pa
kistan of supplying the rebels
with weapons, which Islamabad
has denied, and of permitting
the transit of arms from other
countries.
But observers agree that for
eign arms have arrived in Af
ghanistan in insufficient quan
tities to affect the present

stalemate. Sources who have
accompanied insurgents report
that many ot their weapons had
been confiscated from govern
ment troops
Lack of aid
In fact, insurgents in
Peshawar continue to complain
bitterly about the lack of aid
they have received. The chief
grievance is that without sur
tace-to-air missies their camps
are unprotected from Soviet
helicopter gunships.
Only four SAM-7 batteries
have been deployed in Afghan
istan. sources close to Western
intelligence services report, but
the missiles have been less than
successful because they were
installed by unqualified people.
Western sources estimate
that despite the boasts of the
state media the Karmal govern
ment has virtually lost the sup
port of the Afghan population —
and even much ot the army,
which has shrunk from 90.000 to
25.000 men.
Rebel fragmentation
The rebels, however, have
their own political problems.
These stem chiefly from
fragmentation. The Islamic Al
liance for the Liberation ot Af
ghanistan has been rejected by
all ot its tormer components,
and its leader, Abdul Rassul
Swiaf. has formed his own
group.
