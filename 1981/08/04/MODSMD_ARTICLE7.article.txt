# Panama's Torrijos dies in crash
## 
### Associated Press 
Panama City, Panama — Hundreds of
mourners, some weeping, filed past the closed,
flag-draped wooden casket of Gen. Omar Torrijos
on yesterday to pay homage to the man who won
the battle for Panamanian ownership of the Pan
ama Canal.
The 52-year-old leader — killed with six others
when his plane crashed into a jungle hillside Fri
day — had run this Central American country as
commander in chief of the powerful national
guard since 1969.
The funeral is scheduled for this morning, and
is to be attended by foreign leaders and represent
atives. including a delegation from the United
States.
National guard and government leaders chose
Col. Florencio Flores, the guard's chief-of-staff.
to succeed Torrijos. But foreign diplomats here

were predicting a power struggle after the funer
al.
"The government was not ready for this and
neither was the opposition," said Foreign Min
ister Jorge Illueca. "The country is not ready for
this."
Aristedes Royo is president, but he was hand
picked by Turrijos in 1978 and did the general's
bidding — although both men denied it publicly.
Real power here is wielded by the national guard,
and although little is known of Flores, he is said to
be a moderate, much like Torrijos.
The United States, which completed the
strategic Panama Canal in 1914, controlled it and
the surrounding Canal Zone until 1978. Then, Pan
ama and the United States signed treaties that
provide for a U.S.-Panamanian commission to ad
minister the waterway until the year 2000 when
the canal will be turned over to Panama.
