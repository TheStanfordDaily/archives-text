# CIA Africa plan worries House
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Members of
the House Select Committee on
Intelligence, in a move de
scribed as "rare" by govern
ment specialists, have written
to President Reagan objecting
to a Central Intelligence Agency
nlan for a covert action opera
tion in Africa, according to in
tormed sources.
Sources in both the executive
and legislative branches of gov
ernment say that while it is not
unusual for committee mem
bers to occasionally voice con
cern in closed-door meetings
with CIA officials over various
covert action schemes, it is
highly unusual for members to
put their views in writing for the
president, who ultimately must
approve or disapprove the ac
tions. Some sources said that, in

the four years since the House
committee was established,
they could think of no other case
in which members went so far.
These sources would provide
no details on the CIA operation,
its size or importance, except
that it was aimed at someplace
in Africa. They said, however,
that a number of House commit
tee members, both Democrats
and Republicans, were troubled
by both the plan itself, which
they felt was not properly
thought through, and the pro
posed secret actions.
The plan reportedly was tirst
brought to the committee by
Max Hugel, the ClA's former
deputy director for operations,
and by another high ranking CIA
otficial.
In those hearings, misgivings
about the plan were voiced to

Hugel sources say. But some
committee members either did
not have enough confidence that
their concerns would be passed
along to Casey and the presi
dent. or telt sufficiently con
cerned about the matter, to
write the president directly, the
sources add.
Under a variety of amended
federal statutes dealing with
congressional oversight ot
planned U.S. covert, or under
cover, intelligence activities,
the president must first make a
"finding" that such activities
are necessary for national se
curity and then the director of
CIA is obliged to inform the
House and Senate select in
telligence committees, which
were set up in the past tour to
five years.
