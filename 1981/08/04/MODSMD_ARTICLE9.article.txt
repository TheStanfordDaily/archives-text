# U.S. warned on refugees
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Office of
the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees has privately ad
vised the Reagan adminis
tration that the United States
may be violating international
law — and endangering
thousands of litfes — by deport
ing displaced Salvadorans to
their war-torn homeland.
Sources close to the U.N.
agency said that the interna
tional authority had sent two un
usual "aides-memoires" to the
administration, in April and in
June. Both reportedly urged the
United States to reconsider its
deportation policy and grant
temporary refuge to
Salvadorans until violence in
their Central American country

subsides.
The commission frequently
sends such cables to nations that
are known to violate human
rights or cause refugee prob
lems. But it is unusual for the
commission to cable the United
States, which has a long tradi
tion of sheltering refugees.
The Department of State has
maintained that most of the
hundreds of thousands of
Salvadorans who have" fled to
the United States in recent
years are "economic refugees"
— not political refugees fleeing
the violence that has killed
nearly 20,000 since January
1980. On that basis, the U.S. Im
migration and Naturalization
Service has been deporting '000
Salvadorans a month.
