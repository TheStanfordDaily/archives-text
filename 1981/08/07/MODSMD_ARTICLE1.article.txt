# Gene-splicing licenses may bring millions to Stanford
## 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
An unprecedented plan to
license the use of the basic gene
splicing technique could result
in several million dollars per
year in additional income for
the Office of Technology Licens
ing here.
The proposed licensing plan
would cover the whole genetic
industry both in the United
States and abroad, and allow the
University to receive royalties
on all the commercially de
veloped products that result
from the technique.
The technique was discovered
and patented by Stanford's Dr.
Stanley Cohen and Dr. Herbert
Boyer of the University of Cali
fornia at San Francisco, both of
whom relinqished their royal
ties to their respective univer
sities.
Niels Reimers, director of the
Office of Technology Licensing
here, reports that about fifty
firms have already inquired
about the license. He added that
the license will be anounced in
advertisements in the Wall
Street Journal, Nature, and Ge

netic Engineering News. Com
ments from several firms in
cluding Genetech, Cetus. Eli
Lilly, Upjohn. Dupont, and
Monsanto were sought for the
advertisement.
University President Donald
Kennedy explained, "Funds
generated through the licensing
program will help replenish the
basic research enterprise."
Royalties
The University will receive 15
percent of the royalty income
for administration expenses
The remainder will be split be
tween Stanford and the Univer
sity of California, with Stanford
funds going to the Medical
School, the Departments of
Medicine and Genetics, the
Stanford University Research
Development Fund, and the
Deans Fellowship Fund in sup
port of post-doctoral fellow
ships here.
Companies applying for
licensing would pay $10,000 in
itially and another $10,000 an
nually. They may then credit
five times these fees (up to 50
percent) against future royal
ties on their products. This plan
differs greatly from both the
huge gains experienced wnen
some biotechnical firms went
public recently and from the ar
rangements made by several
East Coast universities in their
establishment of University-run
companies to develop their dis
coveries made by their faculty.
In 1980, Harvard President
Derek Bok (a Stanford alum
nus) told The Boston Globe that
several of his school's faculty
had started a company to de
velop biotechnical products
based on funding from venture
capital. The University would
license the company (in which it
would be a minority
shareholder) to use the tech
niques developed in University
research.
The Stanford plan, on the oth
er hand, will atempt to solidify
the relationship of industry and
university, so important in past
development of discoveries re

suiting from faculty research.
This relationship has in the past
resulted in the development of
such products as the transistor
and many other devices in the
medical and technological in
dustries.
Addresssing this issue, Ken
nedy commented that the Uni
versity "has a responsibility to
attempt to pursue legitimate re
turns that its own research op
portunities and successes make
possible. That's the way we
keep the enterprise nourished
and keep it healthy. But at the
same time, it's wise to re
member that the University has
a responsibility to the research
enterprise in a more global
sense. That responsibility in
cludes maintaining the quality
of communication, openness,
access, and sharing of informa
tion that gives the enterprise
much of its vigor."
Foreign development
Concern has also been raised
regarding foreign development
of techniques discovered in the
U.S. In 1978. the U.S. Patent of
fice considered changing its
licensing policy to allow only
nonexclusive licensing of pat
ented discoveries. "If only non
exclusive licenses are avail
able, then foreign industry has
equal access in using the results
of government-funded re
search." said Reimers at the
time. Along with other oppo
nents of the change Reimers
said he felt that this wouid be
devasatating to a university's
ability to encourage industry to
invest risk capital to develop an
ambryonic invention from gov
ernment funded research.
A law recently instituted by
the International Trade Com
mission, however, forces any
one who uses the patented meth
od overseas to apply for a
license to import the resulting
products into the U.S., thus
guaranteeing a market for U.S.
industrial products. Andy
Barnes, a Stanford MBA who
will direct the licensing pro
