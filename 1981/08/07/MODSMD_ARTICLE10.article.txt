# Air transport may function below capacity for two years
## Air strike could shake economy 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's de
cision to fire the striking air traffic controllers
means that the nation's air transport system
could shrink for at least two years, curtailing
travel and making it harder to ship fruit, flowers
and all other goods.
It would take from two to three years to fully
train the 6500 new controllers needed to maintain
flights at current levels, federal officials said
Wednesday. Meanwhile, commercial air traffic
probably will move at an average 75 percent of
normal — and perhaps only 50 percent of normal
at major airports.
That means that the strike, and the president's
decision to fight it out with the riefiant controllers,
could have a rippling effect throughout the econo
my, with the greatest impact on those industries
most dependent on air traffic to handle their
goods.
While the effects eventually would be wide
spread, the first companies to suffer would be the
airlines themselves. Normally, the major sched
uled carriers do a $100 million-a-day business at
this time of year. The strike has cut that to $65
million a day.
The airline industry lost a record $225 million

last year and had hoped to recoup with profits of
$550 million to $750 million this year. That goal
now seems unlikely as a result of the controllers'
walkout.
If a settlement cannot eventually be reached,
and that prospect now seems extremely unlikely,
the air-travel business is certain to suffer a pro
longed slump.
What is more, a weakened airline industry is
likely to buy fewer new aircraft from Boeing.
Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. The ripple ef
fect of curtailed orders would then spread to the
smaller companies that serve the big aircraft
manufacturers.
While many businesses would be hurt and the
impact would vary by industry, Richard Rahn.
vice president and chief economist of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said "we would not ex
pect an overall major negative result in the econo
my."
Rahn said that the shipment of California fruits
and vegetables to the East during the winter could
be jeopardized by a reduced number of flights.
Other perishable items like flowers would also be
more difficult to move by air, he said.
Rahn predicted that the impact would be less on
personal and business travel.
