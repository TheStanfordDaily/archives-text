## 
### Associated Press 
Washington — The Reagan
administration on Wednes
day proposed a relaxation of
several air pollution regu
lations including those gov
erning emmission standards
for automobiles — actions it
acknowledged would slow
the pace of cleaning up the
nation's air
Environmental Protection
Administrator Anne Gorsuch
in'roduced the adminis
tration's "broad principles"
for amending the Clean Air
Act. the principal law con
trolling air pollution. She
said President Reagan and
his Cabinet approved the
ideas Tuesday.
Along with changing stan
dards for auto pollution, the
proposals would alter the
rules for new coal-fired
plants, do away with clean
air deadlines for some areas
of the country, and give indi
vidual states more sav in set

ting their pollution stan
dards.
Among the goals Gorsuch
outlined at a news con
ference were "uniformity
and . . . simplification" of
standards to avoid delays
and help industrial develop
ment. contrasting this with
the current "vegetable
soup" — or case-by-case ap
proach — in the current law.
Gorsuch said the adminis
tration was making few spe
cific recommendations in its
proposals. It probably would
not present its own bill but
rather work with Congress to
achieve the reauthorization
of the law due this year, she
said
The Clean Air Coalition
said the vague plan was sim
ply a mask for more specific
proposals that would hinder
the effort to rid the nation of
dirtv air.
