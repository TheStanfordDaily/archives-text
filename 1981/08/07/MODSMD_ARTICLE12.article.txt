# Corporate mergers: greater efficiency or greater empires
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The high-roll
ing bids for the oil wells and coal
fields of Conoco Inc. have re
vived a debate about the Ameri
can economic system that can
be traced to the Leginning of the
industrial age: Is there some
thing unhealthful — even sin
ister — about vast concentra
tions of corporate power?
The general viewpoint of the
Reagan administration was
stated last month by Attorney
General William French Smith,
in remarks that resonated
throughout the law firms that
counsel major companies on
mergers and antitrust prob
lems.
"We must recognize that big
ness in business does not neces
sarily mean badness and that
success should not be auto
matically suspect," Smith told
the annual meeting of the Dis
trict of Columbia Bar.
The administration will con
tinue to look closely at mergers
that involve competitors in the
same industry and will prose
cute price-fixing and other
kinds of illegal business con
duct, Smith said. But it won't be
automatically suspicious of
mergers of companies that
aren't in direct competition
with each other, he indicated.
Wary of concentration
The other side in the debate
harbors fundamental suspicion
of industrial concentration. Sen
ators Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) and Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio) say the competi
tion for control of Conoco
"seems to be just the beginning
of a long series of huge combina
tions," and they have urged the
Senate Judiciary Committee to
hold hearings on the develop
ments.
Since the passage of the Sher
man Antitrust Act in 1890, anti
trust advocates have opposed
merger trends, warning that

they reduce the number of com
petitors and thus make it easier
for big companies to dominate
markets and dictate to con
sumers. Their goal, as stated by
Judge Learned Hand of the U.S.
Court of Appeals in a major rul
ing against the Aluminum Co. of
America in 1945, is to preserve
"for its own sake and in spite of

possible costs, an organization
of industry in small units which
can effictivelv compete with
each other."
Reagan policy
The recent remarks of Smith
and the Justice Department's
antitrust chief William Baxter
raise questions about how tough
the Reagan administration will

be on mergers. Baxter has said
there will be no retreat on
horizonal mergers involving
competitors in the same in
dustry.
Baxter and Smith appeared to
take a more lenient view toward
other kinds of mergers. One is
vertical combinations of two
companies in different seg
ments of the same industry,
such as the merger of Conoco
with E.I. duPont de Nemours &
Co. Inc. A DuPont-Conoco union
will give DuPont a secure supp
ly of oil, gas and coal as raw ma
terials for its production of
plastics, synthetic fibers and
other DuPont products.
The second category includes
conglomerate mergers, the
combination of unrelated com
panies, often the acquisition of a
weaker'company by a stronger
one. The unsuccessful attempt
by the Seagram Co. of Canada to
purchase a 51 percent share of
Conoco would have resulted in a
merger of this type.
Efficiency
The Reagan administration,
backed by an increasingly in
fluential group of conservative
economists and antitrust law
yers, called the Chicago School
because its roots are at the Uni
versity of Chicago, argue that

efficiency is the indispensible
ingredient in a healthy econo
my. The efficient company wins
out in the end and the less effi
cient competitor dies in a con
test ultimately determined by
the consumers, who wind up
with the goods they want at the
lower prices the more efficient
firm can offer.
Most companies that merge
do so not because they are
trying to muscle smaller com
petitors. this theory holds, but
because they are trying to be
come more efficient.
Assessing a merger
If it is hard to determine,
looking back through history,
whether a merger helped or
hurt competition, it is much
harder for the Justice Depart
ment or the Federal Trade Com
mission to make that judgment
when a proposed merger is un
der review, says Robert
Pitofsky, a former FTC com
missioner who resigned this
year.
"As a result, antitrust en
forcement along economic lines
already incorporates large
doses of hunch, faith and intui
tion," Pitofsky said in an article
published in 1979.
