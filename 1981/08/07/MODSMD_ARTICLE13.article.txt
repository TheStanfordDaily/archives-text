### Washington Post 
New York — E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.. the nation's larg
est chemical company, Wednesday won the most expensive and
one of the most bitter corporate takeover fights in American
business history.
Despite a champagne celebration at Du Pont headquarters in
Delaware, however, the victory had its price: giant distiller
Seagram Co. will end up as Du Pont's largest stockholder and
may claim some of the chemical firm's assets in exchange of its
current and prospective holdings.
What Du Pont won was a five-week, three-way struggle for
Conoco Inc., the nation's ninth-biggest oil company and second
biggest coal company.
Du Pont bested Mobil Corp. — the nation's second-largest oil
company, whose final $8.8 billion bid was richer than Du Pont's
$7.6 billion cash and stock offer but which could not survive the
taint of potential federal antitrust challenges.
Du Pont also thwarted Seagram's attempts to acquire 51 per
cent of Conoco. Du Pont already has 55 percent of Conoco's 86
million shares in its firm control and probably will pick up more
before its offer to buy expires on Aug. 17.
