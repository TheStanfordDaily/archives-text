# Front of Quad renovated to meet new regulations

The sound of jackhammers no
longer startles students walking
through the outer Quad, nor
does the sight of a tall, white
crane standing in what used to
be Building 1-20. the building to
the left of the main entrance to
the Quad at the foot of Palm
Drive.
Since January last year,
workmen have been restructur
ing the building to provide addi

the walls and floors to comply
with current earthquake laws.

ciology department and a much
expanded Communication de
partment.
"When the University first
opened," said main supervisor
Roger Buehout, "the building
was a 1600-seat assembly hall."
Workmen tore down all but
three of the building's original
walls, deepened the original ex
cavation bv 20 feet to provide for
a sub-basement, and added an
extra floor "just under the
roof," said construction coordi

nator Robert Young
At this stage. Young said,
"We've structurally finished
the basement and sub-basement
and will start pouring the fourth
floor in another two or three
weeks."
The building will eventually
consist of six floors: four above
ground and two below. The base
ment and sub-basement will
serve as a two-story color tele
vision studio for the com
munication department, Young
said
The construction costs alone
take up $8.5 million of the
project's total budget of $11 mil

lion, said Buehout. The dif
ference, he said, is taken up by
the cost of equipment, pro
fessional services such as engi
neering and inspection, man
agement fees, the cost of "ac
tivating" the building — which
means putting it into actual use
— and the "GPI pro-rate," a
"University-imposed tax on the
building to support general plan
improvements, such as park
ing "
"If we didn't gut the building,

construction costs would have
been much lower," said
Buchout. "But compliance with
current earthquake laws re
quired a completely new struc
ture."
The building was old, and
many of its structural weak
nesses were due to what Young
called "old masonry tech
niques."
To make the building more
earthquake-resistant, the "in
side of all exterior walls were
strengthened with reinforced
concrete," said Young
However, "there's no such
thing as an earthquake-proof
building," said Buchout, which
means that when a large earth
quake hits, even the structural
ly upgraded buildings in the
Quad, such as the History Cor
ner and Building 1-20, might un
dergo heavy damage.
"All the buildings in the front
of the Quad have had renova
tion of one form or another,"
said Buchout. As for which
buildings will be up for renova
tion in the future, Buchout said
the old Engineering Corner and
the old Geology Corner were
likely candidates because
neither have as yet been reno
vated.
Young said it was "the great
desire of the trustees" to even
tually renovate the entire Quad,
but he said he did not know if it

would become a reality.
In contrast to the work on
Building 1-20, Young called the
work on Memorial Church,
which began on April 20 this
year, "a rather simple opera
tion, incidental to the installa
tion of a new organ."
The construction firm of
Ralph Larsen and Son, Inc. is
handling both projects.
Young said he was not sure
about "the allotment of space"
in Building 1-20 after its comple
tion, but he said it would be in

teresting to see "who would get
the bigger share" — the soci
ology department or the com
munication department.
Right now, it looks as though
most of the space will be going
to the communication depart
ment. The building plans in
clude "space for the addition of
other communication facil
ities" aside from the television
studio, which include 20 editing
rooms and a computerized jour
nalism lab.

"When the University first
opened," said main supervisor
Roger Buehout, "the building
was a 1600-seat assembly hall."
Workmen tore down all but
three of the building's original
walls, deepened the original ex
cavation bv 20 feet to provide for
a sub-basement, and added an
extra floor "just under the
roof," said construction coordi

nator Robert Young
At this stage. Young said,
"We've structurally finished
the basement and sub-basement
and will start pouring the fourth
floor in another two or three
weeks."
The building will eventually
consist of six floors: four above
ground and two below. The base
ment and sub-basement will
serve as a two-story color tele
vision studio for the com
munication department, Young
said
The construction costs alone
take up $8.5 million of the
project's total budget of $11 mil

lion, said Buehout. The dif
ference, he said, is taken up by
the cost of equipment, pro
fessional services such as engi
neering and inspection, man
agement fees, the cost of "ac
tivating" the building — which
means putting it into actual use
— and the "GPI pro-rate," a
"University-imposed tax on the
building to support general plan
improvements, such as park
ing "
"If we didn't gut the building,

construction costs would have
been much lower," said
Buchout. "But compliance with
current earthquake laws re
quired a completely new struc
ture."
The building was old, and
many of its structural weak
nesses were due to what Young
called "old masonry tech
niques."
To make the building more
earthquake-resistant, the "in
side of all exterior walls were
strengthened with reinforced
concrete," said Young
However, "there's no such
thing as an earthquake-proof
building," said Buchout, which
means that when a large earth
quake hits, even the structural
ly upgraded buildings in the
Quad, such as the History Cor
ner and Building 1-20, might un
dergo heavy damage.
"All the buildings in the front
of the Quad have had renova
tion of one form or another,"
said Buchout. As for which
buildings will be up for renova
tion in the future, Buchout said
the old Engineering Corner and
the old Geology Corner were
likely candidates because
neither have as yet been reno
vated.
Young said it was "the great
desire of the trustees" to even
tually renovate the entire Quad,
but he said he did not know if it

would become a reality.
In contrast to the work on
Building 1-20, Young called the
work on Memorial Church,
which began on April 20 this
year, "a rather simple opera
tion, incidental to the installa
tion of a new organ."
The construction firm of
Ralph Larsen and Son, Inc. is
handling both projects.
Young said he was not sure
about "the allotment of space"
in Building 1-20 after its comple
tion, but he said it would be in

teresting to see "who would get
the bigger share" — the soci
ology department or the com
munication department.
Right now, it looks as though
most of the space will be going
to the communication depart
ment. The building plans in
clude "space for the addition of
other communication facil
ities" aside from the television
studio, which include 20 editing
rooms and a computerized jour
nalism lab.
