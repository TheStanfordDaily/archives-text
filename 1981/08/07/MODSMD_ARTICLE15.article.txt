Milton Friedman and Thomas
Sowell to be the only woman
on the 14-member advisory

since his term as governor of
California, and headed the So
cial Security task force until
Reagan took office as president.
She turned down offers to join
the administration as Social Se
curity commissioner and as a
member of the Council of Eco
nomic Advisors earlier this
year, according to previous ac
counts in the press.
When contacted bv phone
earlier this week, Ricardo-
Campbell acknowledged the
other offers and said, "It would
be difficult for me to take a full
time job in Washington D.C. at
the moment. . . and I find that I
can have a considerable amount
of influence from Hoover."
She was influential in shaping
much of the Reagan adminis
tration's present Social Security
policy, although there are some
significant differences between
her proposals and the bill now
before Congress.
She claims she was never in
favor of cutting minimum bene-

fits, and believes that federal
employees should have to pay
into Social Security like other
American workers.
Ricardo-Campbell openly
supports the Equal Rights
Amendment, which sets her
apart from many of her far
right colleagues at the Hoover
Institution and others who are
influential with the Reagan ad
ministration
Asked if she considered
herself more of a liberal than
the rest of Reagan's inner cir
cle, she said. "I think that a true
conservative believes that so
cial issues are not part of eco
nomic conservatism — they're
aside from it.
"I don't agree to bringing in
questions of equal rights and
abortion as part of the litmus

test for a conservative."
In reference to "neo-conser
vative" groups such as the Mor
al Majority, she said "I don'tun
derstand the jump they make
from (the ERA's) equal rights
under the law too: 'this means
the destruction of the family.' "
Ricardo-Campbell said she
prefered not to discuss her view
on abortion, but commented, "I
think abortion is a personal mat
ter for a woman, and the govern
ment should stay out of it."
Ricardo-Campbell has
shaken the medical estab
lishment by advocating in
creased competition in the
health field.
She would like to see the
licensing of special health pro
fessions liberalized to reduce
costs, and health maintenance
organizations (such as Kaiser-
Permanente) encouraged to ex
pand their services.
The consumer would benefit
greatly from the advertisement
of prescription drugs on the sup

ply side, according to Ricardo-
Campbell.
"I think in a highly mobile so
ciety, the more information the
consumers have the better they
can take care of themselves."
she said.
Ricardo-Campbell recently
finished a book on health, The
Economics and Politics of
Health Care. which will be pub
lished early in 1982.
The problem of interest rates
and how to lower them is going
to be of major importance
among the issues facing the
President's Economic Policy
Advisory Board, according to
Ricardo-Campbell.
She said that, with a few ex
ceptions, she is generally in
agreement with the Reagan ad
ministration's economic poli
cies to date, adding that she
thought President Reagan's re
cent tough stance on the air traf
fic controllers' strike was wise.
"I've never seen anybody else
in a position of leadership in this
country say to the unions no, and
mean it, in big letters," she
said.
"One push on prices is
through wages, of course, and if
you get a firm stand there, you
can change consumers' expec
tations of price increases," she
said.
Ricardo-Campbell received
her PhD from Harvard Univer
sity, and has led a distinguished
career as an economist in the
public and private sectors. She
is married to W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoo
ver Institution since 1959.
Much attention has been paid
to the influence of the conserva
tive Hoover Institution on Presi
dent Reagan's political and eco
nomic policies; it is sometimes
referred to as his "private think
tank." Reagan has been an
"Honorary Fellow" there since
1975.
In addition to Ricardo-
Campbell, Sowell and Fried
man, a number of other scholars
associated with the Institution
have been appointed to a wide
range of positions in the new ad
ministration Most notable are
White House Domestic Affairs
Advisor Martin Anderson and
Special Envoy to the Middle
East Philip Habib.
