Claiming his "rights of free
dom of speech have been
thwarted," Dr. William
Shockley. Nobel prize winner
and retired University pro
fessor, has initiated a $1,250,000
libel suit against the Atlanta
Constitution newspaper.
The complaint alleges that an
article published in the southern
newspaper on July 31 of last
year gave a maliciously dis
torted report of an interview
with Shockley, the controversial
scientist who has proposed that
race influences intelligence.
Shockley claims the article
falsely represented him to the
200.000 readers of the Atlanta
Constitution as approving of
Hitler's super race programs.
These included surgical experi
ments on Jews and defectives.
In a press release issued by
Shockley July 29, he said the
article contains "widely dis
seminated distortions'' of his
motivations and humanitarian
values He continued that this
could thwart his objective of
making a contribution to the
future of humanity as great or
greater than he had made by his
transistor inventions. "Having
failed to obtain a retraction
from the paper. I concluded that
a legal rebuttal was required,"
he said.
According to Shockley, a year
elapsed between the publication
and the suit because he
"digested it, thought it over,
looked for lawyers.' He called
the attorney who is representing
him. J. Walter Cowart of Savan
nah, Georgia, "an attorney who
supported my objectives and
could develop legal means to re
fute emphatically the Atlanta
Constitution s defamatorv arti
cle."
