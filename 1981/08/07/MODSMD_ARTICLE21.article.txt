I'm going to Los Angeles — by
jet — this weekend, but not
without misgivings.
Jet flight is what it's all
about. I've known that for a long
time. It's the risk, you see, the
peril of close lingering and hor
rible death. The mid-flight day
dream that features twisted
aluminum framework, para
palegics, quadrapalegics, de
capitates strewn about the
crash sight smoldering beneath
great belches of soot an orange
flame The allure of excruciat
ing suffering that puts the real
zing in the concept of the jet set
To play with fire and get away
with it. That's really what it's
really all about. Ask John
Wayne, our hero in the White
House, he'll tell you.
An aircraft, a commercial
jet. let us say. is an amalgam of
aluminum, jet fuel and abstract
principle. It is a grand creation
of human thought It is also the
preferred tool of fools and
madmen
What other creature besides
man would subject itself to the
plain facts of jet travel — being
locked inside of 200 tons of
aluminum, rocketing at nearly
600 miles-an-hour 35.000 feet or
more above ground atop ma
chinations so powerful as to be
capable of completely in
cinerating an average human in
a single whisper of high-octane
fueled computerized fury.
This, of course, even dis
counts the forces of nature itself
which possess notably greater
freedom at high altitude than
they do in the lower, and more
habitual regions for humans.
Do wnd rafts, updrafts.
tumultuous storms, free-float
ing electricity and suspended
cloudy bergs of ice are a few of
nature's common man
ifestations in these unnatural
altitudes And yet men, armed
with no small cunning — ques
tionable logic — and an ir-

repressible, innocent boldness
like that of a clever child's has
the daring to fly, to tackle na
ture on her own terms with
schedules and timetables so
regular and mundane that one
treats the airline industry with
the same nonchalance paid to a
button manufacturer, or a jour
nalist, for that matter. But,
man. you're playing with God,
or at least that's how it seems to
me as I pack my Gideon with the
rest of my flight bag.
We never mind the conflagra
tion. the holocausts, the carnage
that make it all so thrilling. Isn't
that right. Mr. President?
Two hundred seventy-seven
in Chicago. 130 more in San Die
go, hundreds in the Canary Is
lands, and a dozen crushed sec
tions of airliners tumbled
across New Jersey turnpike:
we've seen it dozens of times at
home, on the ground. There's
the secret, the magnetic horror
of it all. The enigmatic charis
ma of fatal flame.
Well, maybe not.
This is all written of course
with tongue in cheek, but also
with both feet firmly planted on
that gangway to the friendly
skies. Friendly? You could nev
er call John Wayne friendly.
What's my safety compared to
the sacrifice of his manly lead
ership Who am I to complain?
Ah. but can he possibly know
what he's doing. Why. of course,
look at his track record for hu
man compassion in. well. El
Salvador? How about the South
Bronx 0 How about San Francis
co International Airport 0
Well, I really didn't want to
fly anyway The drive down 1-5
will give me a chance to think —
all the way to the voting booth
But if you're reading out there
Ronny, remember the Duke:
"Count yourself, hombre You
ain't so many."
