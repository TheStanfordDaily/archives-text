Disarmament
My extreme alarm and dis
may after reading "Defense Re
port calls for Big Military Build
up" (Daily, July 21) compel me
to write this letter to the Daily.
I hope many in the Stanford
community share my conviction
that now is the time for nuclear
disarmament, not for the folly
of bankrupting our country by
continuing to build more and
more unneeded nuclear arms.
There exists an "Interna
tional Peace Petition" which is
addressed to President Ronald
Reagan and Chairman Leonid
Brezhnev which "calls upon the
United States and the Soviet
Union to end the arms race
which threatens all with an
nihilation." The petition has
62 sponsors, among whom
are Bella Abzug, Daniel and
Philip Berrigan, Helen
Caldicott, the Rev Jesse Jack
son, Linus Pauling and Ramsev
Clark.
Copies of the petition mav be
obtained from: International

Peace Petition, 1127 W. Division
St., sth floor, Chicago, IL 60625.
Their telephone number is
(312)787-3916. Working with the
petition is simple. All one has to
do is collect signatures on it and
then mail it to the Chicago ad
dress just cited. One may make
as many copies of the petition as
one wishes. k
Although, unfortunately, he
will probably pay no attention to
it. I surely wish' Reagan would
listen to, and act upon, a recent
recommendation from George
Kennan. Kennan. a gentleman
who has the longest experience
of any American on Soviet af
fairs, in referring to the mad
ness of the present nuclear arms
race said, "I can see no way out
of this dilemma, other than a
bold and sweeping departure. I
would like to see the President,
after appropriate consultation
with the Congress . . . propose
to the Soviet Government an im
mediate across-the-board re
duction by 50 percent of the nu
clear arsenals now being main

tained by the two super
powers." On July 26, 1981, I
mailed (separately) to Reagan,
to Secretary of State Alexander
Haig. and to Defense Secretary
Casper Weinberger a copy of an
article in which Kennan is
quoted as making this recom
mendation.
The following quote, from Pe
ter Marshall, one-time chaplain
of the United States Senate, de
scribes what, in accordance
with my beliefs, should be the
top priority of the United States
of America:
"Bless this land we love so
much, our Father, and help her
to deposit her trust, not in ar
mies and navies, in wealth and
in material resources, or in
achievements of the human
mind, but in that righteousness
which alone exalteth a nation,
and by which alone peace can
finally come to us."
