## Latest nuke proliferation policy will backfire 
### 
President Ronald Reagan announced a nuclear non-pro
liferation policy last month whose practical effects will be
to spread nuclear bombs, subvert the Nuclear Non-Pro
liferation Treaty, destabilize allied governments, raise
energy prices and prolong dependence on foreign oil.
These unintended results arise from misunderstanding
the link between nuclear power and nuclear bombs, the ec
onomics of energy and the realities of nuclear politics
abroad
The Reagan non-proliferation policy depends first on the
very assumption Iraq has just disproved: that the atom
can be split into two roles as neatly and irrevocably as into
two parts, offering nuclear power without spreading
bombs In fact, the atom is "a-tomic" indivisible. Every
form of energy fissionable material in every kind of reac
tor can be made into powerful bombs, either directly or
when treated by processes and equipment that nuclear
power makes widely and innocently available — along
with dual-purpose skills and organizations.
Thus Iraq combined a French reactor (fueled with bomb
material, some of which the French press has reported as
missing), Italian small-scale reprocessing equipment,
Portuguese uranium and other contributions from many
sources to amass, quite legally, a nuclear complex
capable of making bombs by any of several routes, but
publicllv rationalized as "research" for an energy pro
gram
Iraq's key facilities, advertised to be under safeguards,
were in fact legally exempt from international inspection,
and even inspection of the reactor could not have detected
its use to make bombs This further proves the Pentagon's
contention, in its private dissent to the Reagan policy, that
such safeguards cannot be relied upon.
Thus Iraq has shown — like Israel, India, Pakistan,
South Africa, Taiwan. Korea and others before it — that
promoting nuclear power means promoting bombs and
hence, that phasing out nuclear power is a necessary pre
condition for non-proliferation.
Is denuclearization, however, a sufficient condition?
Can't countries bent on bombs still make them by other
means? Yes. but with vastly greater difficulty. In a non
nuclear world, all the ingredients needed to make bombs
by any method would no longer be ordlaary items of com
merce Thev would therefore be harder to get, more con
spicuous to try to get and politically far more costly to be

caught trying to get, because for the first time, they would
be unambiguously military in intent. The civilian cover
that enabled Iraq and Pakistan to get, and U.S. allies to
supply, larval bombs would be stripped away, making the
political cost to both parties generally prohibitive.
Nuclear advocates say that denuclearization is Utopian
and foolish in a world short of oil. They fail to note, how
ever, that nuclear power is uneconomic and is largely ir
relevant to the oil problem. It offers the wrong kind of
energy — too little and too late, at far too high a cost. Less
than a tenth of the world's oil generates the form of energy
— electricity — that nuclear power supplies.
Even in this limited role, new nuclear power plants are,
and have been since 1975, uncompetitive (despite subsidies
halving their apparent cost) with new and relatively clean
coal plants. (Existing but idled coal plants could more
than replace all the oil-fired plants.) Here and abroad, re
newable sources now available can also provide larger,
cheaper and faster electrical supplies than can nuclear
power.
Although the Reagan non-proliferation policy assumes
that nuclear power must and will grow rapidly worldwide,
the market says the opposite. Prospects for nuclear
growth are actually collapsing — the greatest failure of
any industrial enterprise in history. Official U.S. nuclear
forecasts for the year 2000 have fallen eightfold since 1974,
with at least 50 more reactors canceled than ordered.
Strikingly, the collapse has been virtually identical
throughout the world's market economies, including those
with no regulatory impediments to building reactors (Can
ada ) or to raising utility rates (West Germany).
Nuclear power is dying of an incurable attack of market
forces. Only in the centrally planned economies — the So
viet Union and. until the recent elections, France — have
nuclear-growth forecasts held steady. Imitating Soviet
central planning, however, Reagan is seeking to boost sub
sidies (already more than $40 billion) to nuclear power,
and to gut domestic and international programs to harness
far cheaper competitors — efficiency and renewables —
which would increase, not endanger, national security.
Yet despite all official efforts to favor reactors over
these least-cost solutions, nuclear power is and will re
main a tiny part of total energy supply.
In addition, by endorsing breeders and reprocessing
only for so-called reliable U.S. allies with advanced nude

ar programs, the president is reinforcing precisely the
double standard that has led many embittered developing
nations to threaten to quit the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (supposedly a centerpiece of the president's poli
cy). Even the flimsy paper barriers to universal bomb
building are already near collapse because the United
States, foremost among countries already having bombs,
has ignored its treaty commitments to energy-security
needs of developing countries — Reagan is slashing in
ternational programs for energy and development — and
to nuclear disarmament.
While it would have, Reagan says, "profound conse
quences for international order" for another nation to get
even one bomb, he continues to multiply a U.S. arsenal of
more than 30,000 bombs and to try to dominate the world
through implicit threats of nuclear violence. These habits
naturally inspire imitation by others. Such monumental
hypocrisy may well scuttle the whole regime, however in
adequate, of international "safeguards" and restraint.
The nuclear arms race could then quickly spread from the
two superpowers to dozens of countries, most of them
hostile to the United States.
In short, if not reversed by an informed public and by
Congress, the president's non-proliferation policy is likely
to loose upon the world vast armadas of commercial bomb
materials, undercut the treaty, perpetuate bombs as the
symbol and substance of ultimate world power, deepen our
allies domestic divisions and commercial quarrels, pro
long oil dependence and reduce the energy security of all
nations
Worse, Reagan's policy will unavoidably and incon
tinently spread bombs, innocent disguises for bombs and
ambiguous threats of bombs. These threats, as Israel and
Iraq have shown, motivate rivals to get their own bombs,
and even if no bombs are actually planned, to turn one's
own nuclear plants into an attractive nuisance inviting
preemptive attack
All this seems a high price to pay for Reagan's unwill
ingness to subordinate his emotional fondness for nuclear
power to a willingness to accept the verdict — however un
palatable - of a truly competitive marketplace. Even the
demise of cherished delusions is less painful than a nuclear
holocaust.

long oil dependence and reduce the energy security of all
nations
Worse, Reagan's policy will unavoidably and incon
tinently spread bombs, innocent disguises for bombs and
ambiguous threats of bombs. These threats, as Israel and
Iraq have shown, motivate rivals to get their own bombs,
and even if no bombs are actually planned, to turn one's
own nuclear plants into an attractive nuisance inviting
preemptive attack
All this seems a high price to pay for Reagan's unwill
ingness to subordinate his emotional fondness for nuclear
power to a willingness to accept the verdict — however un
palatable - of a truly competitive marketplace. Even the
demise of cherished delusions is less painful than a nuclear
holocaust.

President Ronald Reagan announced a nuclear non-pro
liferation policy last month whose practical effects will be
to spread nuclear bombs, subvert the Nuclear Non-Pro
liferation Treaty, destabilize allied governments, raise
energy prices and prolong dependence on foreign oil.
These unintended results arise from misunderstanding
the link between nuclear power and nuclear bombs, the ec
onomics of energy and the realities of nuclear politics
abroad
The Reagan non-proliferation policy depends first on the
very assumption Iraq has just disproved: that the atom
can be split into two roles as neatly and irrevocably as into
two parts, offering nuclear power without spreading
bombs In fact, the atom is "a-tomic" indivisible. Every
form of energy fissionable material in every kind of reac
tor can be made into powerful bombs, either directly or
when treated by processes and equipment that nuclear
power makes widely and innocently available — along
with dual-purpose skills and organizations.
Thus Iraq combined a French reactor (fueled with bomb
material, some of which the French press has reported as
missing), Italian small-scale reprocessing equipment,
Portuguese uranium and other contributions from many
sources to amass, quite legally, a nuclear complex
capable of making bombs by any of several routes, but
publicllv rationalized as "research" for an energy pro
gram
Iraq's key facilities, advertised to be under safeguards,
were in fact legally exempt from international inspection,
and even inspection of the reactor could not have detected
its use to make bombs This further proves the Pentagon's
contention, in its private dissent to the Reagan policy, that
such safeguards cannot be relied upon.
Thus Iraq has shown — like Israel, India, Pakistan,
South Africa, Taiwan. Korea and others before it — that
promoting nuclear power means promoting bombs and
hence, that phasing out nuclear power is a necessary pre
condition for non-proliferation.
Is denuclearization, however, a sufficient condition?
Can't countries bent on bombs still make them by other
means? Yes. but with vastly greater difficulty. In a non
nuclear world, all the ingredients needed to make bombs
by any method would no longer be ordlaary items of com
merce Thev would therefore be harder to get, more con
spicuous to try to get and politically far more costly to be

caught trying to get, because for the first time, they would
be unambiguously military in intent. The civilian cover
that enabled Iraq and Pakistan to get, and U.S. allies to
supply, larval bombs would be stripped away, making the
political cost to both parties generally prohibitive.
Nuclear advocates say that denuclearization is Utopian
and foolish in a world short of oil. They fail to note, how
ever, that nuclear power is uneconomic and is largely ir
relevant to the oil problem. It offers the wrong kind of
energy — too little and too late, at far too high a cost. Less
than a tenth of the world's oil generates the form of energy
— electricity — that nuclear power supplies.
Even in this limited role, new nuclear power plants are,
and have been since 1975, uncompetitive (despite subsidies
halving their apparent cost) with new and relatively clean
coal plants. (Existing but idled coal plants could more
than replace all the oil-fired plants.) Here and abroad, re
newable sources now available can also provide larger,
cheaper and faster electrical supplies than can nuclear
power.
Although the Reagan non-proliferation policy assumes
that nuclear power must and will grow rapidly worldwide,
the market says the opposite. Prospects for nuclear
growth are actually collapsing — the greatest failure of
any industrial enterprise in history. Official U.S. nuclear
forecasts for the year 2000 have fallen eightfold since 1974,
with at least 50 more reactors canceled than ordered.
Strikingly, the collapse has been virtually identical
throughout the world's market economies, including those
with no regulatory impediments to building reactors (Can
ada ) or to raising utility rates (West Germany).
Nuclear power is dying of an incurable attack of market
forces. Only in the centrally planned economies — the So
viet Union and. until the recent elections, France — have
nuclear-growth forecasts held steady. Imitating Soviet
central planning, however, Reagan is seeking to boost sub
sidies (already more than $40 billion) to nuclear power,
and to gut domestic and international programs to harness
far cheaper competitors — efficiency and renewables —
which would increase, not endanger, national security.
Yet despite all official efforts to favor reactors over
these least-cost solutions, nuclear power is and will re
main a tiny part of total energy supply.
In addition, by endorsing breeders and reprocessing
only for so-called reliable U.S. allies with advanced nude

ar programs, the president is reinforcing precisely the
double standard that has led many embittered developing
nations to threaten to quit the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (supposedly a centerpiece of the president's poli
cy). Even the flimsy paper barriers to universal bomb
building are already near collapse because the United
States, foremost among countries already having bombs,
has ignored its treaty commitments to energy-security
needs of developing countries — Reagan is slashing in
ternational programs for energy and development — and
to nuclear disarmament.
While it would have, Reagan says, "profound conse
quences for international order" for another nation to get
even one bomb, he continues to multiply a U.S. arsenal of
more than 30,000 bombs and to try to dominate the world
through implicit threats of nuclear violence. These habits
naturally inspire imitation by others. Such monumental
hypocrisy may well scuttle the whole regime, however in
adequate, of international "safeguards" and restraint.
The nuclear arms race could then quickly spread from the
two superpowers to dozens of countries, most of them
hostile to the United States.
In short, if not reversed by an informed public and by
Congress, the president's non-proliferation policy is likely
to loose upon the world vast armadas of commercial bomb
materials, undercut the treaty, perpetuate bombs as the
symbol and substance of ultimate world power, deepen our
allies domestic divisions and commercial quarrels, pro
long oil dependence and reduce the energy security of all
nations
Worse, Reagan's policy will unavoidably and incon
tinently spread bombs, innocent disguises for bombs and
