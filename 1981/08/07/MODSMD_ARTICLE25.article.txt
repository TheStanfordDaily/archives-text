## Picayune distinctions twisting foreign policy 
### 
In setting out to refute the
motley collection of fallacies
which comprise Robert
Wesson's editorial, "Recognize
Difference among Repressive
States" (Daily, Aug. 4), I find
myself in the predicament faced
by the mosquito in the nudist co
lony: I don't know where to
start. However, my appetite has
gotten the better of me, so I
shall trv to address a few of

OPINIONS

Wesson's more egregious mis
statements, drawing my ex
amples from Latin America.
I question, first of all,
Wesson's claim that "author
itarian" dictators somehow
have greater legitimacy among
their countrymen than "total
itarian" ones. Most current
Third World authoritarian
rulers derive their power, not
from some mystical tradition,
but from the brute fact of U.S.
backing. It is hard to see how the
governments of Guatemala,
Brazil, the Dominican Re
public, and Chile, which trace
their origins back to U.S.-
backed coups, can be described
as reigning by virtue of "tradi
tional and historically accepted
. . . authority."
One might also inquire wheth
er tradition in itself imparts
sanctity: Is institutionalized
murder less objectionable in
countries where it has a long, il
lustrious history?
In any case, most author
itarian ruling elites, realizing
that they owe their tenure in of
fice to their willingness to let
the U.S. government and U.S.
corporations dominate their

countries, feel much closer to
Americans than to their own
people, and are contemptuous of
their nations' cultures, tradi
tions, and inhabitants.
Secondly, I challenge
Wesson's claims that author
itarian states are preferable to
totalitarian ones because they
deny freedom only in the politi
cal sphere. What Wesson
carefully ignores is that eco-

nomic and social improvements
in countries ruled by author
itarian regimes can only come
through structural, i.e., politi
cal changes.
The fact, of course, is that po
litical repression is necessi
tated precisely by unjust eco
nomic and social conditions. A
Guatemalan Indian "legally"
robbed of his land, a Honduran
worker prevented by govern
ment terror from joining a
union, a Salvadorean woman
whose child suffers from
malnutrition and has no chance
of becoming literate — all these
people can deal with their prob
lems only through politics, and
their attempts to do so are met
by government repression.
For Wesson to assert that
these people are somehow bet
ter off than Russians because
they are denied "only" political
freedom seems, at best, dis
ingenuous. The fact that the aw
ful social and economic condi
tions such people confront stem
in large part from the need to
provide cheap labor, an export
oriented economy, and a good
investment climate for the ben
efit of American corporations

makes Wesson's argument that
much more unpalatable.
Wesson's implications that
those in authoritarian regimes
are free to leave is equally dis
ingenuous. The Sumpul River
massacre of May 1980, in which
600 unarmed refugees trying to
flee from El Salvador into Hon
duras were machine-gunned by
Salvadorean troops, probably
claimed more lives than all the

escape attempts from East Ber
lin since the wall was erected;
and it is only one of several such
massacres.
Furthermore, at this very
moment the Reagan Adminis
tration is systematically de
porting Salvadorean refugees
back to their country, where
they face almost certain death.
Perhaps the Administration
will justify its policy — which
has prompted two reprimands
from the UN refugee agency —
on the grounds that El Salvador
is "only" an authoritarian re
gime.
Refugees from totalitarian
regimes are welcome in Ameri
ca. since they serve propaganda
functions, but refugees from
friendly authoritarian regimes
are embarrassing and hence un
acceptable. In any case, poverty
effectively prevents many
would-be refugees under au
thoritarian regimes from emi
grating.
Wesson's argument is not
only intellectually wrong; it is
morally irresponsible. While
claiming to present a balanced
view, it diverts Americans'
moral attention from countries

where it can do much good — the
authoritarian regimes which de
pend on U.S. backing — to those
where it cannot — the total
itarian regimes over which we
have minimal influence.
Maybe the Reagan Adminis
tration and some corporate ex
ecutives share Wesson's feeling
that fascism is somehow less
"alien" to us than Communism,
his underlying assumption that
the status quo must be pre
served at any cost, but my guess
is that most Americans do not,
and thev should exert their full

influence in behalf of a moral
foreign policy without letting
themselves be hoodwinked by
specious scholarly distinctions.
As Wesson himself writes,
"Repression is repression and
torture is torture." Salvadorean
repression is as despicable as
Soviet repression. The dif
ference between the two lies not
in meaningless labels, but in the
fact that we support the former,
and are therefore in a position to
do something about it..

motley collection of fallacies
which comprise Robert
Wesson's editorial, "Recognize
Difference among Repressive
States" (Daily, Aug. 4), I find
myself in the predicament faced
by the mosquito in the nudist co
lony: I don't know where to
start. However, my appetite has
gotten the better of me, so I
shall trv to address a few of

OPINIONS

Wesson's more egregious mis
statements, drawing my ex
amples from Latin America.
I question, first of all,
Wesson's claim that "author
itarian" dictators somehow
have greater legitimacy among
their countrymen than "total
itarian" ones. Most current
Third World authoritarian
rulers derive their power, not
from some mystical tradition,
but from the brute fact of U.S.
backing. It is hard to see how the
governments of Guatemala,
Brazil, the Dominican Re
public, and Chile, which trace
their origins back to U.S.-
backed coups, can be described
as reigning by virtue of "tradi
tional and historically accepted
. . . authority."
One might also inquire wheth
er tradition in itself imparts
sanctity: Is institutionalized
murder less objectionable in
countries where it has a long, il
lustrious history?
In any case, most author
itarian ruling elites, realizing
that they owe their tenure in of
fice to their willingness to let
the U.S. government and U.S.
corporations dominate their

countries, feel much closer to
Americans than to their own
people, and are contemptuous of
their nations' cultures, tradi
tions, and inhabitants.
Secondly, I challenge
Wesson's claims that author
itarian states are preferable to
totalitarian ones because they
deny freedom only in the politi
cal sphere. What Wesson
carefully ignores is that eco-

nomic and social improvements
in countries ruled by author
itarian regimes can only come
through structural, i.e., politi
cal changes.
The fact, of course, is that po
litical repression is necessi
tated precisely by unjust eco
nomic and social conditions. A
Guatemalan Indian "legally"
robbed of his land, a Honduran
worker prevented by govern
ment terror from joining a
union, a Salvadorean woman
whose child suffers from
malnutrition and has no chance
of becoming literate — all these
people can deal with their prob
lems only through politics, and
their attempts to do so are met
by government repression.
For Wesson to assert that
these people are somehow bet
ter off than Russians because
they are denied "only" political
freedom seems, at best, dis
ingenuous. The fact that the aw
ful social and economic condi
tions such people confront stem
in large part from the need to
provide cheap labor, an export
oriented economy, and a good
investment climate for the ben
efit of American corporations

makes Wesson's argument that
much more unpalatable.
Wesson's implications that
those in authoritarian regimes
are free to leave is equally dis
ingenuous. The Sumpul River
massacre of May 1980, in which
600 unarmed refugees trying to
flee from El Salvador into Hon
duras were machine-gunned by
Salvadorean troops, probably
claimed more lives than all the

escape attempts from East Ber
lin since the wall was erected;
and it is only one of several such
massacres.
Furthermore, at this very
moment the Reagan Adminis
tration is systematically de
porting Salvadorean refugees
back to their country, where
they face almost certain death.
Perhaps the Administration
will justify its policy — which
has prompted two reprimands
from the UN refugee agency —
on the grounds that El Salvador
is "only" an authoritarian re
gime.
Refugees from totalitarian
regimes are welcome in Ameri
ca. since they serve propaganda
functions, but refugees from
friendly authoritarian regimes
are embarrassing and hence un
acceptable. In any case, poverty
effectively prevents many
would-be refugees under au
thoritarian regimes from emi
grating.
Wesson's argument is not
only intellectually wrong; it is
morally irresponsible. While
claiming to present a balanced
view, it diverts Americans'
moral attention from countries

where it can do much good — the
authoritarian regimes which de
pend on U.S. backing — to those
where it cannot — the total
itarian regimes over which we
have minimal influence.
Maybe the Reagan Adminis
tration and some corporate ex
ecutives share Wesson's feeling
that fascism is somehow less
"alien" to us than Communism,
his underlying assumption that
the status quo must be pre
served at any cost, but my guess
is that most Americans do not,
and thev should exert their full

influence in behalf of a moral
foreign policy without letting
themselves be hoodwinked by
specious scholarly distinctions.
As Wesson himself writes,
"Repression is repression and
torture is torture." Salvadorean
repression is as despicable as
Soviet repression. The dif
ference between the two lies not
in meaningless labels, but in the
fact that we support the former,
and are therefore in a position to
do something about it..
