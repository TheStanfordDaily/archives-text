# Relax and escape to forgotten Half Moon Bay
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
One of the most overlooked
resorts in California is Half
Moon Bay. This could be be
cause it does not offer as rugged
a coastal terrain as do the fa
mous Northern Californian and
Oregon coasts; nor are the
beaches quite as wide or as
pleasurable as those at Santa
Cruz: the redwood parks up in
the hills in no way compare to
the great national forests like
Sequoia or Redwood; golf is not
as good as at Pebble Beach; and
restaurants are not as enticing
as those in San Francisco .
Yet there are few places
which come to mind that offer
such a wide variety of ac
tivities; its offerings are not of
sheer excellence but they are
very acceptable Furthermore,
the advantage of being a mere 40
minutes (or less depending on
how you drive) from Palo Alto
and most of Silicon Valley mag
nifies its virtues manifold
When pressures build up at
school or at work, and it's time
for a break. Half Moon Bay pro
vides a good option, either for a
day trip or for a week-end stay.
The drive over the hills is most
attractive and can be done on 92
or on 84 The former brings you
right into the center of Half
Moon Bay, whereas the other
leaves you 15 miles south, with a
beautiful coastal drive ahead of
you.
Your itinerary can vary
greatly depending upon the
length of your stay, your tastes
and unfortunately, above all.

distinctly unsavory feature of
the coastline, it is its climate

Bay often shivers in the low 60s.
clouded in and buffeted by
coastal breezes Still the weath
er for fall is normally quite
good, and in the summer it is
rarely poor enough to prevent
ail outdoor activity.
The main attractions at Half
Moon Bay, for me. are its physi
cal beauty, its beaches and its
relaxed and relaxing at
mosphere. There are. however,
a number of more concrete ac
tivities which could aDpeal to
different members of the com
munity.
Firstly, some of the best sport
fishing on the coast operates out
of Princeton-on-the-Sea, a cou
ple of miles south of Half Moon
Bay: here one can go out in
search of rock cod. ling cod.
salmon or albacore on any day
of the year cxcept for Christ
mas. The cost varies between
S2O for a rock cod dav trip to $225
for an overnight quest of

albacore, to $1275 for a 15 day
excursion to Maddalena and Ali
jos. Charters are also a possi
bility as are bird watching ex
peditions and also whale watch
ing, in season The last does re
quire very early reservations
For those untempted by sea
faring adventure, there is still
plenty to do on land. Golf lovers
will delight at the Arnold
Palmer designed golf course
Its holes weave in and out be
tween newly built houses, and
some end on cliffs overlooking
the magnificent Pacific: be pre
pared to lose some balls! The
championship rating is 73.9 and
can be safely avoided by nov
ices. Others, though, wanting a
challenge and not minding
green fees, ranging from $18 to
$29 (depending on day and
time), would have a great few
hours on this course.
Otherwise for oenophiles, or
even wine lovers, a cute little
winery sticks out from the cen
ter of a field of daisies. No
vineyards drape the hillsides,
whose crops include brussel
sprouts, pumpkins (there is a
reknowned pumpkin festival
here, each year), and daisies,
among other things, but Paul
and Sandy Obester and sons
have chosen this as the locale
for their own family winery.
They bring their grapes from
Sonoma, Mendocino and Mon
terey county vineyards, and do
all the rest themselves: crush,
filter, age. bottle, cork, label,
sell, and ship. Their reds are
made with old Italian tech
niques taught to them by
Sandy's father. The whites are a
more recent addition, this does
not mean that they are any less
attractive. Some have already
won prizes for excellence If you
are interested in finding out how
a winery works, either Paul or
Sandy, who are both very friend
ly. will show you around. Ap
pointments are necessary for a
tour, but if you just want to sam
ple and buy wines, they are open
all weekends from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m
Horse riding is another op
tion There is a state horse trail
that parallels the beach for sev
eral miles: horses however, are
only rented for a time sufficient
to cover a mile or two of it. The
f rail, on a weekend, seemed ov
ercrowded and uninteresting,
and the horses were not in the
best of shape. If you are desper
ate to ride though, the people at
Friendly Acres seemed far
more caring and amicable than
their competitors next door at
the Sea Ranch.
The coast is speckled with
eight state beaches which lie

open and ready for long strolls,
or. on many fall and summer
days, for relaxation and even
swimming (for those intrepid
souls willing to brave the cold
Pacific surfK The beaches, for
the most part, are less crowded
than their cousins down south,
and the choice is wide enough to
suit all tastes in beaches. They
are all within a few miles of one
another, and a brief investiga
tion will lead you to the beach of
your choice.
North of Half Moon Bay is a
coastal wildlife reserve, which
is an ideal location for a picnic:
it is beautiful to sit at the top of
the cliff, in a sylvan glade, and
look out at the waves lapping up
the beach. The tranquility is a
great means of escapism, and
provides a perfect time for
either thinking or for forgetting
all thoughts. . .
If the activity of walking the
100 yards from your car seems
excessive, even a drive up or
down the coast would be worth
while. The coast north of Half
Moon Bay is stunning and ap
proaches the beauty of its big
ger brothers up north Down
south the scenery is less spec
tacular, but there are several
very accessible beaches: San
Gregorio, Pescadero, etc. . .
On the other hand, if you are
particularly energetic, a bi
cycle ride covering the same
area would be great excercise,
and an excellent way to get an

It is a small town, offers no

during the week, relaxing and

the hills in no way compare to
the great national forests like

as good as at Pebble Beach; and

can be safely avoided by nov

challenge and not minding
green fees, ranging from $18 to
$29 (depending on day and

hours on this course.
Otherwise for oenophiles, or
even wine lovers, a cute little
winery sticks out from the cen
ter of a field of daisies. No
vineyards drape the hillsides,
whose crops include brussel
sprouts, pumpkins (there is a
reknowned pumpkin festival

among other things, but Paul

for their own family winery.

North of Half Moon Bay is a

is an ideal location for a picnic:
it is beautiful to sit at the top of

great means of escapism, and
provides a perfect time for
either thinking or for forgetting
all thoughts. . .
If the activity of walking the
100 yards from your car seems
excessive, even a drive up or
down the coast would be worth
while. The coast north of Half

south the scenery is less spec

On the other hand, if you are
particularly energetic, a bi

In the hills south of Half Moon

In general. Half Moon Bay re
mains relatively unspoiled It is
an area that is just being dis
covered. Houses are popping up
all over, and real estate prices
have increased drastically; but
there is still that intangible feel
ing of sincerity which is so lack
ing in both Carmel and Mon

terey Restaurants are still fre
quented by the locals, and above
all locals do still exist. Even
ginally from elsewhere have
adopted the simplicity and
share the very evident com
munity spirit, which lends the
area noticeable small-town-at
mosphere.
It is a small town, offers no
thriving night-life, nor any
suave sophistication. It is un
pretentious, and, especially
during the week, relaxing and
peaceful. Those needing to be

entertained every minute of the
day should avoid the area; those
who enjoy sitting on the beach
reading, strolling in the fresh
sea air or sitting in a bar talking
to locals, would have a great
time
Half Moon Bay is so close to
Stanford that a very full day can
be spent there without having to
worry about a long trek home
Still if you have the time to be
carefree, and don't mind
splurging for a night in a hotel
(there are only two in the area),
this could be a perfect escape.
