# Two hotels — one quaint, one modern

SAN BENITO INN
MAIN STREET, HALF MOON BAY
TEL: 726-3425
Before leaving to Half Moon Bay, the San
Benito House had been recommended to me sev
eral times; it has built up the reputation of being
quaint and friendly, and I agree with this defini
tion. At the same time I feel that the inn would
not be suitable for everyone.
It is located in downtown Half Moon Bay — but
don't let this worry you, as the town is not a
burgeoning, booming metropolis like Carmel or
.Monterey. All 11 rooms are on the second floor,
as is the sauna (a slightly out of place, but still
welcome addition to the inn), and they are. with
one exception, compact.
Our room seemed to pass beyond the bounds of
quaintness. and creep into the realms of
diminutive and cramped; it was one of the
smallest, and yet the rest were not brobd
ingnagian either. The inn is modelled after the
European bed and breakfast inns, and it carries
this emulation past the point of most American
facsimiles by having some accomodations
without a private bathroom The ones with full
facilities do not have modern fixtures, but in
stead are furnished with huge bathtubs (I am
more than six feet tall, and was able to luxuriate
very comfortably at full extension). That was the
high point of our room. The rest was just too con
fined : the bed was a double, not a queen size, and
no matter how we tried we could find no floor
space capable of accomodating our open suit
case: still, Carol Reagan, the owner, assured us
that she had many people request that particular
room. Chacun a son gout, I suppose.
So if you are going to be in the area overnight,
do not suffer from claustrophobia, want to be in a
less than conventional hotel, and are willing to
forego the plastic luxuries of modern American
society, the San Benito House has a very welcom

ing atmosphere. Reagan is open and very willing
to suggest pastimes in the local area. She will pre
pare picnics for those interested, and do anything
she can to make your stay enjoyable.
I do recommend the San Benito House, but only
if you go prepared for what you will encounter,
plain and simple accomodations, and a lot of good
will.
HALF MOON BAY LODGE
COAST HIGHWAY 1
TEL: 726-6301
As one of only two hotels in Half Moon Bay, the
lodge does have a near monopoly on lodging
spaces, especially in catering to those unwilling
to forego modern amenities; it is a motor lodge in
the mold that one would expect, but it definitely
belongs to the upper echelon of this category.
It is nestled along the side of the very scenic
Half Moon Bay golf course, over which all rooms
(except for the conference rooms) face out. The
rooms are conventional, more on the capacious
side than not. and immaculate, as one would ex
pect. A welcome extra in some rooms are fire
places with actual burning logs, by whose glow
ing reddish light, intimate late evenings, or casu
al relaxing discussions both become very natu
ral. Many of the rooms in the new wing, which is
being added on this year, will have fireplaces.
We were given the conference room, a 700
square foot cavern complete with king-size bed
and fireplace. Its immensity, however, was not
off-putting, and I enjoyed my evening there im
mensely. This particular room would be perfect
either for meetings or for any type of party, as it
does have a fully equipped kitchen area.
For those who love golf, want a quiet place to
work, or just want a very comfortable night's
stay in Half Moon Bay, and can afford standard
major motel prices! $38 to $70), I recommend the
Half Moon Bay Lodge without reservation. (Do
reserve, though, if you want to be assured of get
ting a room!)
