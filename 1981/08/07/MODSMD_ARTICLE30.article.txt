mushrooms, garlic, sherry

very disappointed, then, to dis

Carol Reagan, the owner/chef

low residents. This attitude is
very much in keeping with the
small-town atmosphere that
pervades in Half Moon Bay.
As for the gastronomic quali
ties of the San Benito House . .
Brunch was excellent; San
Benito eggs, (eggs poached with
artichoke hearts and ham on
squaw bread, covered with
hollandaise sauce) was a slight
twist on the now standard Eggs
Benedict: my pancakes were
light, fluffy and apparently lim
itless in quantity, as seconds
were readily offered, and equal
ly readily accepted! Entrees
are served with fruit marinated
in wine, as well as a replen
ishable glass of Ramos Fizz
(Champagne with orange
juice.) The service is not yet
professional or elegant, but it
doesn't aim to be either On the
other hand, the waitresses are
friendly and most certainly try
their best to please
The dining room is well de
signed; high ceilinged. light,
and very countrvish; above all it
is comfortable, and caters well
to its mixed clientele, whose
dress varies from coat and tie to
jeans.
The meal started off with
prosciutto and melon; both
were superb, but as soon as my
palate was aroused, and my ap
petite whetted, none was left, . .
I only wish that there had been a
few more morsels (a second
slice of ham perhaps!).
The salad was dreary due to a
distinct dearth of dressing, and
is hardly worth mentioning.
There was a choice of two en
trees. a limited selection, but
one which allows Carol to have
full control in the kitchen. Luck
had it that both were dishes that

appeal very much to me. The
Beef Wellington, (fillet of beef,
smothered in pate and baked in
flaky pastry) was excellent. The
meat was of prime quality, and
the proportions of meat to pate
to pastry to sauce were near
perfection, and 1 almost refused
to share it with my companion
I wish I had The prawns
Provencale, (prawns cooked in
garlic, wine, and normally
tomatoes), lacked character
and were overcooked The
prawns themselves, were large
and of very high standard, but
were overly soft when served,
which was rather a shame.

Desserts comprised a whole
host of cakes, including the
lemon almond and chocolate
amaretto cakes which we con
sumed For those with a very
sweet tooth they would be ex
cellent . and all four members of
the adjacent table loved their
choices. My tastes are for
slightly less sweet desserts, but
1 emphasize that this is a purely
subjective viewpoint.
The cost of the meal was
$14 95 a person, without wine,
and is even less during the
week; then it varies between
$9.95 and $12.95.
The final meal which we
sampled, and unfortunately not
in its entirety, was a barbecue.
This included unlimited hors
d'oeuvres: shrimp canapes,
cevice. which was definitely too
salty, guacamole, and another
good dip
Because we had to leave we
missed the main course of
marinated shish kabob and
blue-fin tuna, both of which
looked super.
The menu comes complete
with wine, tax, service, and mu
sic. all for $15 a person It is
served on a newly built deck
which looks out over a very pret
ty flower and vegetable garden,
whose produce freshly supplies
all of the kitchen's needs.
This was the first barbecue
ever, and I can see it soon be
coming a favorite among regu
lars and also passers-by. In fact
all of the cuisine has the poten
tial to be very good, and given a
little time for all wrinkles to be
ironed out, this could become a
haven for those epicureans
wanting a change from the City
and Silicon Valley.

This salad arrives in a wooden
bowl along with such accom
paniments as raisins, sunflower
seeds, real bacon pieces, and
parmesan cheese, along with a

choice of dressings. The presen
tation is original, condiments
being brought out on a special
tray that fits over the salad
bowl. The makings are left on
the table, and one can create
whatever combination is de
sired, and replenish the bowl
however many times is wanted.
The list of entrees has a defi
nite preponderance of seafood,
as one would expect, although
certain land-farer's options
such as teriyaki chicken and
rib-eve steak are offered
On two trips to the restau
rant. I had different luck The
first time my companion and I
shared seafood canneloni
(crepes stuffed with fish, crab,
shrimp, onions, and mushrooms
and coated with a tomato and
cheese sauce) and poached
salmon Both were excellent,
the salmon moist and tender and
the canneloni light but rich
enough to be satisfying.
On our second visit, we were
not so fortunate. The coquille di
mare (crab, scallops, and bay
shrimp baked in a Mornay sauce
with Marsalla wine, parmesan
cheese, and breadcrumbs), al
though similar to the canneloni.
was not quite as good. The por
tion was generous and the flavor
appealing, but the texture and
savoriness were not equal to
those of the canneloni;
The prawns sauteed with

mushrooms, garlic, sherry
and lemon was somewhat un
fortunate. As they were being
served, I commented upon their
appealingly large size; I was
very disappointed, then, to dis
cover them to be inedibly salty.
The waiter reacted perfectly
and took them back without
questions, and I decided to risk
them again, only to be sorry
once again to find them very
salty. I would like to mention,
though, that dishes can often be
off on an evening, and that one
incident like this should not de
ter you from trying this very en
joyable restaurant.
For dessert we ordered
cheesecake (one piece for the
two of us) which was excellent
— rich, creamy, and not too
bland. The service was friendly,
skillful, and helpful and was
among the high points of the
evening, partially compensat
ing for my less-than-perfect en
tree.
Otherwise, the general at
mosphere was friendly, good for
either a party or a quiet evening
out I definitely recommend the
place for those spending any
time in the area, and if you are
unsatisfied with the local
seafood offerings, the Shore
Bird is certainly accessible The
ride there in daylight is very
scenic, and a short stroll along
the quay after the meal (in the
fresh sea air) i:; definitely a
verv pleasant extra.

SAN BENITO HOUSE
MAIN STREET, HALF MOON
BAY
TEL: 726-3425
Carol Reagan, the owner/chef
at the San Benito House, has
been doing a lot to make her inn
an essential part of a visit to
Half Moon Bay. She offers not
only evening meals, but Sunday
brunch and even a Sunday after
noon barbecue. She is dynamic,
very personable, and is very en
thusiastic about the whole Half
Moon Bay area. She tries not
only to advocate her own en
terprise but also those of her fel-

I he service is not professional or elegant,
but it doesn V aim to be either. On the other
hand, f/ie waitresses are friendly and fry
their best to please.

low residents. This attitude is
very much in keeping with the
small-town atmosphere that
pervades in Half Moon Bay.
As for the gastronomic quali
ties of the San Benito House . .
Brunch was excellent; San
Benito eggs, (eggs poached with
artichoke hearts and ham on
squaw bread, covered with
hollandaise sauce) was a slight
twist on the now standard Eggs
Benedict: my pancakes were
light, fluffy and apparently lim
itless in quantity, as seconds
were readily offered, and equal
ly readily accepted! Entrees
are served with fruit marinated
in wine, as well as a replen
ishable glass of Ramos Fizz
(Champagne with orange
juice.) The service is not yet
professional or elegant, but it
doesn't aim to be either On the
other hand, the waitresses are
friendly and most certainly try
their best to please
The dining room is well de
signed; high ceilinged. light,
and very countrvish; above all it
is comfortable, and caters well
to its mixed clientele, whose
dress varies from coat and tie to
jeans.
The meal started off with
prosciutto and melon; both
were superb, but as soon as my
palate was aroused, and my ap
petite whetted, none was left, . .
I only wish that there had been a
few more morsels (a second
slice of ham perhaps!).
The salad was dreary due to a
distinct dearth of dressing, and
is hardly worth mentioning.
There was a choice of two en
trees. a limited selection, but
one which allows Carol to have
full control in the kitchen. Luck
had it that both were dishes that

appeal very much to me. The
Beef Wellington, (fillet of beef,
smothered in pate and baked in
flaky pastry) was excellent. The
meat was of prime quality, and
the proportions of meat to pate
to pastry to sauce were near
perfection, and 1 almost refused
to share it with my companion
I wish I had The prawns
Provencale, (prawns cooked in
garlic, wine, and normally
tomatoes), lacked character
and were overcooked The
prawns themselves, were large
and of very high standard, but
were overly soft when served,
which was rather a shame.

Desserts comprised a whole
host of cakes, including the
lemon almond and chocolate
amaretto cakes which we con
sumed For those with a very
sweet tooth they would be ex
cellent . and all four members of
the adjacent table loved their
choices. My tastes are for
slightly less sweet desserts, but
1 emphasize that this is a purely
subjective viewpoint.
The cost of the meal was
$14 95 a person, without wine,
and is even less during the
week; then it varies between
$9.95 and $12.95.
The final meal which we
sampled, and unfortunately not
in its entirety, was a barbecue.
This included unlimited hors
d'oeuvres: shrimp canapes,
cevice. which was definitely too
salty, guacamole, and another
good dip
Because we had to leave we
missed the main course of
marinated shish kabob and
blue-fin tuna, both of which
looked super.
The menu comes complete
with wine, tax, service, and mu
sic. all for $15 a person It is
served on a newly built deck
which looks out over a very pret
ty flower and vegetable garden,
whose produce freshly supplies
all of the kitchen's needs.
This was the first barbecue
ever, and I can see it soon be
coming a favorite among regu
lars and also passers-by. In fact
all of the cuisine has the poten
tial to be very good, and given a
little time for all wrinkles to be
ironed out, this could become a
haven for those epicureans
wanting a change from the City
and Silicon Valley.

If vou're tired of Silicon Valley smog, and Spanish restaurant in Prineeton-on-the-Sea; it's a touch of
colonial architecture, take a break to the Shore Bird New England, nestled on the California coastline.
