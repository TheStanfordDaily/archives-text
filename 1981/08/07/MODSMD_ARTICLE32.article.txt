New Varsity, Palo Alto
This enormously popular anti
war comedy is probably over
rated. it sometimes gets a little
too wrapped up in the wonder of its
own whimsy for comfort But, ad
mitting that, it's still difficult to
resist Alan Bates as a World War I
soldier who. upon entering an
abandoned village, discovers that
it is still inhabitated bv the resi
dent's of the town's lunatic asy
lum. Bates falls in love with the
completely loonev but still very
charming Genevieve Bujold, and,
after an initial period of adjust

Arthur Penn (Bonnie and

schizoid but consistently intrigu

Dustin Hoffman's character when
he's well over a hundred;
flashbacks take us to the time of
his youth, which also happens to be
the time of Little Bighorn The
movie's never entirely certain
whether it wants to a be a satire or
a drama. Low comedy and dumb
jokes (some, like the running gag
about a woman who's disappointed
that she wasn't raped by the Indi

rest uneasily alongside massacre

directed this terrific anti-war war
comedy. Blood — from casualties
of the Korean war. mostly — splat
ters the walls of the operation

rooms like juice squirts from ripel
oranges, while doctors
Sutherland and Elliot Gould cover
just about everything else with
wisecracks This is a silly, beau
tifully irreverent view of warfare:
it presents all generals as fools and
all objectives as petty ones As the
spate of "serious" war/anti-war
movies we've had lately indicates,
irreverence can do more to de
mythologize warfare than can any
dozen message pictures ("thou
shalt not play Russian roulette,"
and all that).
Plays tonight only with Billy
Wilder's Stalan 17.

Escape from \eiv York ★★★★
Belmont Theater. Belmont
The year is 1997: Manhattan Is
land has been walled off to form a
maximum security prison Once a
person is sent in, there is no way
out — those who don't like the idea
of living out their lives in the pris
on may opt for execution and imm
mediate cremation on the pre
mises. Inside, the island has
turned into a nightmare world, in
habited above and below by
creatures out of bad dreams
From the time the title credits
fade to the roll of the end credits.
Escape from New York offers vir
tually unrelenting excitement Di
rector John Carpenter (who
directed Halloween, the first and
far and away the best of the cur
rent horror movie cycle) takes his
lightweight plot and fills it to the
bursting point with striking im
ages and setpieces of suspense

f or Your Eyes Only ★★
Palo Alto Square
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal It's
not as bloated as the last Bond ex
travaganza (Moonraker) and it's
perhaps the least sadistic of any
Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic Roger Moore seems to be
growing tired of the role (or per
haps he's merely stopped trying:
the producers plan to replace him

with a younger model soon). He
perks up momentarily — as does
the movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the rest
of the film, For Your Eyes Unix
might have passed for entertain
ment instead of an exercise in
cinematic stasis

Superman II ★★★
Menlo Cinema. Menlo Park
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the original:
it will usually delight those who
found the original's smart-alecky
second half more appealing. Rich
ard Lester (A Hard Day's
The Three Musketeers) directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
book punch that moves it along as
speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
peats his role as the man of steel;
Margot Kidder is, once again, a
sassv, sexv Lois Lane

The Thin Man
Festival Cinema. Palo Alto
This stylish '30s detective story
is based on the book by Dashieil
Hammett. William Powell and

Mvrna Loy play Nick and Nora
Charles, a couple who try not to let
Nick's duties as a detective get in
the way of their entertaining The
plot has enough twists and false
leads to keep everyone guessing,
and the denouement, with all the
suspects gathered together, is a
classic. W.S. Van Dyke directed
The glossy studio photography is
by James Wong Howe
Plays through Wednesday with
Laura.

Endless l.o
Bijou, Palo Alto
Melodrama reigns supreme in
this torrid tale of teenaged intem
perance Brooke Shields endlessly
loves Martin Hewitt, who burns
down her house, spends two years
in an institution, breaks parole,
causes her father's death, and
loves her endlessly, too.
Franco Zeferelli directed this
uncredited remake of Splendor in
the Crass. in which Natalie Wood,
teenagedly intemperant, allows
Warren Beattv to go all the way
with her (honest!) and goes crazy
because of it. In Zeferelli's ver
sion, going all the way means
alwavs having to say you're sorrv.
