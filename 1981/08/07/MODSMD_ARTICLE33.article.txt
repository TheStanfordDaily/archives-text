# A 						Night at the Keystone...
## 
### Mike Hale 
One of the things I found out
after I moved into my new
apartment was its proximity to
the Keystone Palo Alto. I live
closer to the Keystone than just
about anyone in town — from
my balcony 1 could, if I wish,
throw heavy objects at people as
they climb into their cars after a
show.
I've often thought that the
next time the smashing bottles
keep me awake, I'll just chuck a
dictionary over the back fence
and see what it hits.
There are healthier ways to
deal with the noise in the park
ing lot, though, such as going in
side and listening to the noise on
stage. Last Friday night I went
to hear 999, a British group
which plays what I think is new
wa/e even though the punk/new
wave distinction has never been
too clear to me. Everything to
the left of Springsteen is a more
or less homogeneous mass.
I learned about 999 from an
EE major in my sophomore
dorm who liked to pogo and sang
"Homicide" while he skipped
rope each afternoon. He played
me a couple of their albums, and
I even went so far as to search
them out in the import bins at
Tower Records; but by then I
had forgotten what they
sounded like. So I forgot about
the group for a couple of years
until their name appeared on the
marquee at the Keystone.
Things happen later at the
Keystone than they do
elsewhere in Palo Alto. When I
walked in at 10:15, the Alley
Cats, the first of the night's
three bands, were only halfway
through their set — cocktail or
ders had to be shouted into the
waitress's ear.
As it turned out, the Alley
Cats were the most enjoyable
group of the three, mainly be
cause they were the least pre
tentious. There was no obvious
politicking — I can't speak for
their lyrics, which were as in
decipherable as anyone else's.
Their overall sound was re
markably clear: the three in
struments could be dist
inguished from each other, even
with one's eyes closed.
The band was carried bv its
bassist, a woman who did most
of the singing and played an ex
tended solo during the group's
last song which was more in
vigorating than any of the heavy
metal yet to come.
Thirty hot, stuffy minutes lat
er SVT came on. There isn't
much to do between bands at the
Keystone, besides drink and try
to keep from suffocating. The
idea may be to get you so tired of
waiting that you'll be willing to
cheer for any band that's loud
enough to distract you.
SVT was loud enough to dis
tract, but also boring enough to

sedate The result was an hour
of music not really worth listen
ing to, but too unsettling to com
pletely ignore. It soon became
apparent that only the lead
guitarist could play his instru
ment with any sort of competen
cy; the drummer covered up by
twirling his drumsticks in the
air and trying to catch them
(they landed in his lap, or on the
stage in front of the drums) and
the bassist (Jack Casady, for
merly of Jefferson Airplane)
did a very convincing orangutan
imitation, slapping at the
strings of his bass and staring at
the crowd with his mouth slight
ly open.
The band produced a modified
"wall of sound" — the
haphazard drumming, muddy
guitars, and whinv vocals ail
blended together to form a sin
gle unpleasant mass. At one
point SVT launched into a cover
of Johnny Cash's "I Walk the
Line," and I waited for some of
the fabled new wave wit and iro
ny to show itself. But the band
simply plodded through the
song, as if it were any other
three minute nit of their reper
toire, neither adding to it nor
commenting upon it.
At 12:30 999 came on and
played for an hour, with encore.
Somehow, intuitively, I could
tell that this was a good new
wave group. It wasn't the songs,
really, or the playing; to me, the
Alley Cats sounded just as good,
and the only exceptional thing
about 999's songs is that a few,
such as "Homicide" and "Psy
chotic Reaction," could be
top-40 hits with a little promo
tion.
What set 999 apart, finally,
was their excellence as theater.
Three men stand across down
stage, each playing to a dif
ferent part of the audience; and
when the lead singer, in the
middle, starts running around,
he looks less silly with men oc
cupying the stage on either side
of him.
Furthermore, the two
guitarists and the bass play
er are a sort of punk pantheon;
each embodies a stereotype,
and behaves according to our
expectations. The lead singer
and guitarist, slightly over
weight and more than slightly
balding, motored around in lit
tle circles on stage yelling about
Prince Charles and Princess Di.
The second guitarist is slick,
blond, leather-jacketed, and
handsome in an adenoidal sort
of way. He struck a lot of poses
while moving less than anyone
else in the band. The bass player
— Athos to the Porthos and
Aramis of the two guitarists —
is a skeleton out of an Arbus
photograph. He wore zebra
stripe pants and moved like a
stiff puppet doing calisthenics.
Throughout 999's set the au

dience deserted the Keystone's
tables and moved up to the
dance pit, where they could mill
around or pogo into oblivion.
Most people milled, jumping up
and down only when the band led
a cheer for the rioters in Eng
land — "Let's hear it for Man
chester! Coventry! Leeds!
Birmingham! LONDON!."
The band settled down for a
very serious rendition of their
most "pop" song, "Homicide,"
and thanked the audience very
nicely when it called for an en
core.
I left at 1:30 , walked across
the parking lot taking deep
breaths of fresh air and listen
ing for helicopters, and climbed
over my back fence. I had spent
three rather nondescript hours
at a small table in a large
quonset hut, paid two dollars for
a drink and one dollar for a glass
of coffee, and had been on the
verge of heat stroke the whole
time. Now, when someone in the
parking lot keeps me awake, I'll
know what they've just gone
through.

What set 999 apart, finally,
was their excellence as theater.
Three men stand across down
stage, each playing to a dif
ferent part of the audience; and
when the lead singer, in the
middle, starts running around,
he looks less silly with men oc
cupying the stage on either side
of him.
Furthermore, the two
guitarists and the bass play
er are a sort of punk pantheon;
each embodies a stereotype,
and behaves according to our
expectations. The lead singer
and guitarist, slightly over
weight and more than slightly
balding, motored around in lit
tle circles on stage yelling about
Prince Charles and Princess Di.
The second guitarist is slick,
blond, leather-jacketed, and
handsome in an adenoidal sort
of way. He struck a lot of poses
while moving less than anyone
else in the band. The bass player
— Athos to the Porthos and
Aramis of the two guitarists —
is a skeleton out of an Arbus
photograph. He wore zebra
stripe pants and moved like a
stiff puppet doing calisthenics.
Throughout 999's set the au

dience deserted the Keystone's
tables and moved up to the
dance pit, where they could mill
around or pogo into oblivion.
Most people milled, jumping up
and down only when the band led
a cheer for the rioters in Eng
land — "Let's hear it for Man
chester! Coventry! Leeds!
Birmingham! LONDON!."
The band settled down for a
very serious rendition of their
most "pop" song, "Homicide,"
and thanked the audience very
nicely when it called for an en
core.
I left at 1:30 , walked across
the parking lot taking deep
breaths of fresh air and listen
ing for helicopters, and climbed
over my back fence. I had spent
three rather nondescript hours
at a small table in a large
quonset hut, paid two dollars for
a drink and one dollar for a glass
of coffee, and had been on the
verge of heat stroke the whole
time. Now, when someone in the
parking lot keeps me awake, I'll
know what they've just gone
through.

This musician is enjoying himself but that does not answer the ques
tion whether a DOG (Billy Graham's "Day on the Green") is a lis
tener's best friend.
One of the things I found out
after I moved into my new
apartment was its proximity to
the Keystone Palo Alto. I live
closer to the Keystone than just
about anyone in town — from
my balcony 1 could, if I wish,
throw heavy objects at people as
they climb into their cars after a
show.
I've often thought that the
next time the smashing bottles
keep me awake, I'll just chuck a
dictionary over the back fence
and see what it hits.
There are healthier ways to
deal with the noise in the park
ing lot, though, such as going in
side and listening to the noise on
stage. Last Friday night I went
to hear 999, a British group
which plays what I think is new
wa/e even though the punk/new
wave distinction has never been
too clear to me. Everything to
the left of Springsteen is a more
or less homogeneous mass.
I learned about 999 from an
EE major in my sophomore
dorm who liked to pogo and sang
"Homicide" while he skipped
rope each afternoon. He played
me a couple of their albums, and
I even went so far as to search
them out in the import bins at
Tower Records; but by then I
had forgotten what they
sounded like. So I forgot about
the group for a couple of years
until their name appeared on the
marquee at the Keystone.
Things happen later at the
Keystone than they do
elsewhere in Palo Alto. When I
walked in at 10:15, the Alley
Cats, the first of the night's
three bands, were only halfway
through their set — cocktail or
ders had to be shouted into the
waitress's ear.
As it turned out, the Alley
Cats were the most enjoyable
group of the three, mainly be
cause they were the least pre
tentious. There was no obvious
politicking — I can't speak for
their lyrics, which were as in
decipherable as anyone else's.
Their overall sound was re
markably clear: the three in
struments could be dist
inguished from each other, even
with one's eyes closed.
The band was carried bv its
bassist, a woman who did most
of the singing and played an ex
tended solo during the group's
last song which was more in
vigorating than any of the heavy
metal yet to come.
Thirty hot, stuffy minutes lat
er SVT came on. There isn't
much to do between bands at the
Keystone, besides drink and try
to keep from suffocating. The
idea may be to get you so tired of
waiting that you'll be willing to
cheer for any band that's loud
enough to distract you.
SVT was loud enough to dis
tract, but also boring enough to

sedate The result was an hour
of music not really worth listen
ing to, but too unsettling to com
pletely ignore. It soon became
apparent that only the lead
guitarist could play his instru
ment with any sort of competen
cy; the drummer covered up by
twirling his drumsticks in the
air and trying to catch them
(they landed in his lap, or on the
stage in front of the drums) and
the bassist (Jack Casady, for
merly of Jefferson Airplane)
did a very convincing orangutan
imitation, slapping at the
strings of his bass and staring at
the crowd with his mouth slight
ly open.
The band produced a modified
"wall of sound" — the
haphazard drumming, muddy
guitars, and whinv vocals ail
blended together to form a sin
gle unpleasant mass. At one
point SVT launched into a cover
of Johnny Cash's "I Walk the
Line," and I waited for some of
the fabled new wave wit and iro
ny to show itself. But the band
simply plodded through the
song, as if it were any other
three minute nit of their reper
toire, neither adding to it nor
commenting upon it.
At 12:30 999 came on and
played for an hour, with encore.
Somehow, intuitively, I could
tell that this was a good new
wave group. It wasn't the songs,
really, or the playing; to me, the
Alley Cats sounded just as good,
and the only exceptional thing
about 999's songs is that a few,
such as "Homicide" and "Psy
chotic Reaction," could be
top-40 hits with a little promo
tion.
