## ... and a Day on the Green 
### Mark Weiss 
REO Speed wagon, the latest
heirs to the throne of teenybop
per glitter rock, highlighted
producer Bill Graham's second
Day on the Green last Sunday at
the Oakland Coliseum. Also per
forming for the 60,000 fans who
packed the baseball stadium for
eight hours of quantity-over
quality rock music were .38 Spe
cial, Gamma featuring Ronnie
Montrose, UFO and Kansas.
The Day on the Green (DOG)
formula has remained vir
tually unchanged after 35
shows: strike-happy A's and
LA-happy Raiders relinquish
their turf to drug-happv teen
agers, ex-Hell's Angels and any
one else willing to fork out $15
for the privilege to push and
shove for a square foot of grass.
All parts of the stadium are fair
game/fair fight except the pre
cious baseball infield and
pitcher's mound. These areas
are roped off and patrolled by
BGP henchmen salivating in
wild anticipation of the chance
to pulverize any acid-crazed
punk trying to foul the sacred
patch of green with his pres
ence.
The show kicked off at 10:15
as .38 Special, featuring Donnie
Van Zant (brother of the late
Ronnie Van Zant of Lynyrd Sky

nyrd), played a 40 minute
set. Several Confederate flags
dotted the scene as the band,
better than the average DOG
warmup, cranked out seven
tunes.
Gamma featuring Ronnie
Montrose was next. They re
ceived an especially rousing ov
ation because of their San Fran
cisco roots. "Ready for Some
Action" and "Fight to the Fin
ish" highlighted the 55 minute
performance. However. Mon
trose dominated the show, mak
ing one wonder why the group
doesn't switch its name to
"Ronnie Montrose featuring
Gamma."
UFO is another group with
strong Bay Area appeal. Their
lively hour featured hits like
"Train" and "Too Hot to Han
dle." topped off with a rock bot
tom encore.
Four hours into the show Kan
sas took the stage. More im
portantly, at this time the sun
made its appearance from be
hind a thick cloud covering
Kansas played a 75 minute set
led by "Carry On Wayward

Son"; "Dust in the Wind" was a
notable absentee. Vocalist
Kerry Livgren's childlike stage
prancing combined with his
white shorts, socks, and shoes
made one suppose he belonged
in the same nursery as
AC/DCs Angus Young
When REO took the stage the
sun was shining warmly and the
Day on the Green was at its
best. Teenage girls shrieked,
jumped, and wiggled to every
move of their fluorescent-satin
clad heroes. The REO song list
drew heavily from their
catapult-to-stardom Hi Infideli
ty album but also included
selections from the group's pre
vious 12 (!) albums dating
back to 1971.
Singer Kevin Cronin, the
group's main attraction, told
stories between songs and
thanked the crowd for putting
him where every rock musician
wants to be. Together with
guitarist Gary Richrath and
bassist Bruce Hall, Cronin put
60,000 satisfied customers in a
mood to face the two hour traf
fic jam after the show.
