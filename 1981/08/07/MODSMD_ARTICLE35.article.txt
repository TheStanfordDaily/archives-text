# Dining chez M. Bomin
## 
### Domingo Tavella 
"La Concorde" restaurant, at
3314 Steiner Street in San Fran
cisco, while not necessarily a
Frenchman's dream, is the life
long dream of one Frenchman.
Joseph Bomin. the son of a
butcher, who came from Brit
tany to the U.S. thirty years ago.
His dream was realized a year
ago when he opened his own res
taurant. So it is not surprising
that proprietor Bomin spares no
effort to ensure that each table
receives prompt attention
He goes from table to table
chatting with his guests in his
heavily accented but pleasant
sounding English Everything in
the restaurant has his personal
touch: the murals and decora
tion are mostly his doing and he
occasionally prepares the pates
and the hams himself. The
French family touch extends to
his small and entirely French
personnel.
Times are hard, he told us,
and because La Concorde has
been open only a year it barely
scrapes by. The major papers
have ignored the restaurant —
although Herb Caen did drop in
a few times — but so far no men
tion from him. Bomin told us.
The general standard of the
food was high, and with entrees
ranging from $8 to $12 the prices
are reasonable for French food.
The hors d'oeuvres we tried
were excellent, thee scargot
maison ($3.85), with plenty of
melted butter had just the right
amount of garlic and the pate
maisun ($2.50). made by Bomin
himself, had a very good bal
ance of flavors. The only thing
that prevented this part of the
meal from being an authentic

experience was the rubberv
sourdough bread, but since this
is San Francisco perhaps that
can be forgiven.
Next came the celery and let
tuce soup which despite its
creamy and appealing con
sistency did not have the
flavorful taste we had expected.
The wine list has a fairly good
selection of medium priced
French wines.
The choice of entrees is small
but there is a carefully selected
variety of classics, including a
good assortment of fish dishes.
In the salmon with champagne
sauce ($11) two rather thin and
extremely soft salmon steaks
combined very well with the
subtle flavor of the sauce. In the
blanquette de veau(s9) the
mustard gave the sauce a touch
of originality to this classical
dish — an interesting variation
on the canonical form — made
of tender cubes of veal in cream
sauce. Other tempting entrees
included a rack of lamb(sll.sol,
sweetbreads with ham ($8.25 >,
mousse of fish with lobster
sauce (8.95) and scallops a la
l'r<)Lf'ncalisft.%).
For dessert we tried a de
licious orange custard ($1.50)
made with orange liqueur and
the mousse de cafe which, while
creamy, contained a few un
pleasant lumps of what seemed
to be instant coffee.
There were only two things
that did not quite fit into the
French experience chez Bomin:
the sourdough bread was one,
and the coffee was the other. In
stead of a strong espresso to
perk us up there was only weak
American coffee.
