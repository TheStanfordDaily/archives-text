# Sunday brunch among the ducks
## 
### Donna Helliwell 
The Custom's House Restau
rant in Foster City offers a very
tasty brunch selection every
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Don't let the distance (only 20
minutes) keep you from a
sparkling brunch on the water.
The exterior decor of the res
taurant is just a hint of what
you'll find inside. Lots of wood,
packing crates and other bits of
creatively placed ship-yard par
aphanalia. Inside, my guest and
I were seated in high backed rat
tan chairs next to a large open
window directly above the
Foster City Lagoon. Hot fresh
doughnuts were then placed on
our table while ducks paddled
by eagerly awaiting a morsel.
Most of the tables are in the
open but there are some

booths which are com
fortably nestled into huge pack
ing crates. These would afford a
little more privacy which the
closely placed tables do not. The
noise level can become a little
unsettling.
As we waited for our break
fast. munching doughnuts and
feeding the ducks, we admired
the interior decor. Burlap bags,
small crates, ropes and wooden
kegs stacked against the walls
and suspended from the roof and
ceiling fans lazily humming. I
found the decor unique and
tasteful which often does not
happen at the same time
The brunch menu is large and
refreshing. There are five spe
cial plates and a list of regular
dishes, each with an exceptional
twist to it. We began with drinks

from the bar: a "Famous
Ramos (Fizz that is)" — a de
lightfully subtle concoction of
gin, orange curacao and cream
— and the other, a peach dai
quiri. Each drink was $2.50. the
others ranged down to $1.75
For brunch, my guest ordered
"The Captain's Table." This
began with a fruit cup served
with marshmallow sauce con
taining a touch of ginger. Next,
two eggs cooked any way you
like, a top sirloin steak, pan
cakes, coffee, tea. or iced tea
and a glass of champagne; all
for $9.95. The steak was tender
and very well prepared as was
the rest of the meal.
As for their more unusual
dishes, I ordered the "Sunday
Only Potato Skins" ($5.95),
which is noted on the menu to be
one of "Ed's Favorites." (Ed is
the manager.) My brunch fea
tured a tasty blend of scrambled
eggs, bacon, sour cream and
cheddar cheese served in two
crispy potato skins, an unusual
combination and very delicious.
I ended with a cup of their ex
cellent Columbian Blend coffee
— a great way to finish off the
meal.
Every 15 minutes or so they
play a recording of a ship's horn
which could add to the at
mosphere if it were more
muted, but is a little annoying
instead.
The service was good, our
waitress was friendly, the food
was excellent.
