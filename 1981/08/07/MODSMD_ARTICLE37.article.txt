# 'Gaylord' tones down Indian cuisine for American taste
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
Some cuisines are more firm
ly established than others, such
as Chinese and French, while
others are relative newcomers
to the scene. Indian food belongs
to this latter category, especial
ly on the West Coast where Indi
an migration has been a recent
occurrence.
Not many people have had a
chance to adapt their palates to
what is a very different taste
sensation. Authentic Indian
food is for the most part spicy,
very spicy, and needs a high to
lerance level. For that reason.
Gavlord serves what I consider

RESTAURANTS

to be a toned-down version of In
dian food: one which is tasty and
gives some idea of Indian
flavorings and sauces, but
which at the same time does not
shock their palates or their sen
sibilities with too much ex
oticism.
Typical Indian restaurants in
New York and London, where
large Indian communities
thrive, tend to be small and
plainly decorated, definitely
avoiding any sense of visual or
aural aesthetics. Gaylord on the
other hand, is spacious, well
decorated, with a choice loca
tion in Ghirardelli Squire over
looking the Bay. The restaurant
tries its best to convey an at
mosphere of knowledgeable
elegance which is reflected in
prices. But Gaylord is not that
overpriced when you compare it
to the more banal Indian restau
rants which do not run much
cheaper. Portions are larger
than average and quality is also
superior.
I ordered one of the special
'feasts' which gave a balanced
idea of the various house spe
cialties. The maharajah feast
< $17.00) started with a choice of
Mulligatawny or Dal soup. As
my co-editor was ordering the
dal, I ordered the mulligatawny
but being used to a spicy blend of
lentils and chicken, I was un
pleasantly surprised with a soup
whose flavor and consistency
reminded me of Campbells

cream of chicken. Luckily, this
was the only major disappoint
ment of the meal.
The tandoori chicken, a
chicken marinated in yogurt
and spices was decent The
chicken is cooked in a tandoor —
an Indian clay oven heated by
coals — which can be seen be
hind glass at the entrance. The
chicken was underspiced and
not as tasty as I have ex
perienced elsewhere, but it still
conveyed the essence of the
dish.
Three other dishes were also
cooked in the Tandoor And all
of them were verv flavorful

The best by far was the booti
kabab. cubes of lamb well
marinated in spices and cooked
in the tandoor. The chicken
tikka — marinated chicken
cubes — was also good, as was
the seekh kabab — roasted
minced lamb mixed with on
ions. herbs and spices.
The dishes are served with
nan, leavened bread which is
cooked by being thrown onto the
inside walls of the tandoor, and
which was excellent. I ordered a
variation on the bread keema
nan which is stuffed with spicy
minced lamb, an addition I most
certainly recommend.

The dinner also included an
other traditional style of dish,
meat and vegetables simmered
in a spicy sauce. The two which I
sampled were lamb pasanda,
lamb in a mildly spiced cream
sauce with nuts, which could
have afforded to be spicier and
mattar paneer. cubed farmers
cheese with green peas in a
spiced gravy. Again the tame
ness of the sauce was slightly
disappointing. But I was as
sured that all dishes could be
made spicier if requested.
To accompany this plethora
of courses is kashmir pillau,
saffron flavored rice with vege

tables and nuts (the Indian an
swer to special fried rice*.
My revered friend and co-edi
tor was more intrepid than I,
and ordered separately from the
large and well-balanced menu.
His dal soup was thick, rich and
spicy and made me sorrier that
I had opted for the
mulligatawny. The aloo posht,
lamb in a spiced sauce with
potatoes was very good, and in
terms of Indian food, plentiful.
In true Indian fashion, he
cleared his palate with raita. a
yogurt and cucumber concoc
tion.
To finish off, we tried several

of the pastries offered. All
catered to those with a very
sweet tooth We also sampled
the kalfi, saffron flavored ice
cream with pistachios and
almonds, which was overly
frozen, causing the subtle flavor
of the nuts and saffron to be to
tally lost
Overall, the meal was satis
fying and the service good. At

first the service seemed a little
too efficient — our water and
wine glasses were refilled after
every sip, but as the meal con
tinued our waiter and bus boy
became less frantic We en
joyed their efficiency and
friendliness very much. Both
waiters and manager enjoy
communicating with cus
tomers, and they helped make
us feel verv comfortable
