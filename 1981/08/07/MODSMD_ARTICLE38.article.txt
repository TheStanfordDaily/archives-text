Reagan fires controllers
Washington — The Reagan administration,
while dismissing thousands of striking air traffic
controllers and reaffirming its vow never to hire
them back, set out yesterday to rebuild the air
traffic system despite the ousted controllers'
claims that it cannot be done without them
White House spokesman David Gergen said
that as far as President Ronald Reagan is con
cerned. "This is day one in rebuilding the sys
tem." Robert Poli. president of the Professional
Air Traffic Controllers Organization, contended
that "the system is about to collapse."
Meanwhile, leaders of big labor meeting in Chi
cago hinted that they will step up their efforts to
support the controllers' strike, which continued in
its fourth day yesterday with more than 12,000 of
the estimated 13.000 striking controllers still
away from their jobs
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland denounced
as shameful the "shackling and jailing of good
young Americans who have taken a remarkable
act of courage and exercised their rights to
withhold their services from jobs they find they
can no longer tolerate "
And there were indications that the Interna
tional Association of Machinists, who work for the
airlines keeping planes refueled and operable,
may ask their 40.000 members not to cross picket
lines.
The president's work-or-be-fired deadline
passed yesterday morning for the last of the strik
ing controllers
Florida begins medfly war
Tampa, Fla. — The first salvo in what could be
a war against the Mediterranean fruit fly in Flori
da is set for today, with state officials spraying
the chemical malathion over a six-block area of
east Tampa where three flies were found earlier
this week.
The pests, which ruin produce by laying eggs
under the skin of fruits and vegetables, were
found in a citrus tree trap in that area on Tuesday.
The flies had been dead too long for officials to de
termine if they were fertile. Since then, no other
medflies or larvae have been found.

Halwin Jones, director of the state's anti-medf
ly program, said a IVi-square-mile area also is
due for spraying on Monday.
Meanwhile, state Attorney General Jim Smith
planned to ask U.S. District Judge Lynn Higbv of
Panama City on Friday to hear a request to lift an
order that dismantled Florida's embargo against
California fruit and vegetables.
Baseball season split
Chicago — Major league owners voted 21-5 yes
terday to endorse a split season when play re
sumes Monday.
The National League vote was 9-3, and the
American League approved the plan by a 12-2 ma
jority.
Under the system, teams in first place in their
respective divisions when the strike began will
meet the winners of the second season.
If a first-half winner also wins the second half,
that team will meet the division contender with
the second-highest percentage during both halves
of the season.
Both presidents, Chub Feenev of the National
League and Lee MacPhail of the American
League, insisted the split-season plan is for the
1981 season only.
"Normally. I wouldn't be for it," MacPhail
said, "but this is a one-shot deal, and only because
of the strike problems and the unbalanced sea
son."
