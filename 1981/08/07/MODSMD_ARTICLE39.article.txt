# Strike note

### 
Students who fear their
planes home may be can
celled due to the national air
traffic controller strike, can
be assured a place to sleep
while they wait for another
flight, the summer housing
office said yesterday.
"If the plane is can
celled...yes, the students can
stay here." said Ted
Mitchell, director of the
summer housing office.
The University will levy no
extra charge to students who
stay while they wait for a
new flight.
Mitchell said maintenance
room cleaning will be post
poned until the students can
'eave.
