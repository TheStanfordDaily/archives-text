## 
### 
The third heart-lung trans
plant recipient here has become
the first to die, as 28-year-old
Karen Wilson. 28, died iast Sat
urday, only four days after re
ceiving a heart-lung transplant
at Stanford University Hospital
on July 28.
Complications encountered in
the transplant surgery led to
kidney and liver failure. Wilson
had had congential heart dis
ease since birth but a cardiac
arrest last January worsened
her condition. She received two
major surgeries when she was
two and 23, and the resulting
scar tissue caused excessive
bleeding and length irtthe trans
plant procedure.
The surgical team had
planned on a somewhat ex
tended operation because of
these factors, but the July 28
surgery lasted a total of 12
hours. Wilson lived the next four

days primarily in a comatose
condition.
The first two heart-lung
transplant recipients continue
to recover from their opera
tions. Mary Gohlke, 45, who re
ceived the first transplant on
March 9. has been briefly hospi
talized three times for minor
complications since her June 1
release.
The second transplant reci
pient, Charles Walker. 30, has
been free of complications. He
had counseled Wilson about the
waiting and recovery periods
and has been asked bv the staff
to counsel another transplant
candidate before he leaves for
his home in New York.
He and Wilson had become
friends as he followed her
through her critical, guarded
condition.
Wilson was the sixth heart
lung recipient in the world
