# Grievance filing to follow Tresidder layoff
## 
### Karen Springen 
Last Friday Tresidder Union
announced the layoff, effective
August 31, of maintenance em
ployee Cruz (Rick) Hernandez.
Cruz, an employee in the
Union for five years, had been
promoted from custodian to
maintenance person four
months ago. The new position
had been created last fall in an
attempt to start a preventive
maintenance program and to
solve some of the building's up
keep problems.
In the meantime the Univer
sity has apparently decided it
made a mistake, but Cruz's fel
low employees are saying that
be shouldn't have to pay for it.
According to Larry Davidson,
assistant director of Tresidder.
tradespeople with specialized
skills such as carpentry, plumb
ing, painting, electrical work,
and heating and cooling systems
were needed instead of a person
with general maintenance
skills.

When we created the main
tenance person position, it was
to alleviate a lot of the outside
calls," said Davidson. But, he
added, "The level and kind of
work we needed...was higher
than a maintenance person II
was classified to do."
However Linda Crouse. of the
Union of Stanford Employees
(USE), calls the layoff unjust.
Crouse, steward of the 13
maintenance and custodial
workers at Tresidder. said
Hernandez received no advance
warning that he might lose his
job and because of this. Tres
idder workers plan to file a
grievance.
"The problem is that the pro
cedure can take quite awhile. In
the meanwhile we would lose
Rick. We want some reasonable
compromise that Rick can live
with." said Crouse.
"What they're doing makes
no sense from a management
point of view," she said, main
taining that Tresidder is going

to contract skilled journeymen
for sub-journeyman work:
"They're going to hire jour
neymen (from Plants and Ser
vices ) to come up here and
change a washer."
Crouse said that because of
the amount of custodial and
maintenance work needed at
Tresidder, "We've told man
agement that the worst thing
they can do is give projects then
not give them the help to do it."
Job performance
Meanwhile employee Ahkau
Lee said Hernandez had per
formed "satisfactorily," add
ing that Tresidder management
never asked him about the quali
ty of Hernandez's work
Lee continued that Hernandez
gave up his secure custodial job
to accept another worker's
maintenance job. He said that if
Tresidder management had
doubts concerning the cont
ingency of the job they should
have told Hernandez initially.
But Davidson said Tresidder

had no such doubts when the
position was created last Octo
ber. Moreover, he is eligible to
bump other employees within
that classification. If
Hernandez does not bump an
other employee or find im
mediate employment here, he
will receive a "substantial sev
erance payment," according to
Davidson.
But Crouse maintained that
this does not ease Hernandez's
position. "If you kick someone
out of a shop (for bumping
rights >. how's that shop going to
feel about you?" she asked, add
ing, "It (bumping) still puts you
in a lousy position, although it
may be preferrable to a layoff
The fired employee told the
Daily, "I want either one I
don't really want to bump (an
other employee)."
"He has preferential treat
ment for any other job th.it
opens up in the University.'
Davidson emphasized. "We're
