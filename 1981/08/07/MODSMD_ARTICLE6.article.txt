# Turkey: a military regime or terrorism ?
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Ankara â€” It has now been 10
months since Turkey's military
seized power, suspended the
constitution, dissolved par
liament. banned all political ac
tivities and moved against the
terrorists who were killing at
the rate of 20 to 30 a day
Today, terrorism is way
down. politics are dormant and
Turkey remains the only mem
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization without a func
tioning democracy.
News Analysis
"Most Turks are still happy
that we took over when we did."
said a high-ranking official.
"They feel safer. They can walk
the streets But public opinion is
volatile. We know that the mili
tary rulers have to clear out at
some point. If they hang on too
long, the public will forget why
they came to power in the first
place."
Military takeovers
Modern Turkey has seen mili
tary takeovers before, in 1960
and 1971. But this one, last Sept.
12, shows every sign of being
more significant and reformist.
In the past, the military went
back to the barracks and re
turned the country to the politi
cians. It plans to do so again, but
this time the military men are
setting stiffer conditions, de
signed in part to ostracize key
political leaders such as former
Prime Minister Suleyman De
mirel, whose government was
toppled by the military, and pol
itician Bulent Ecevit.
If the military rulers, led by
the chief of the general staff,
Gen. Kenan Evren. have their
way, it will be many years
before either Demirel or Ecevit
holds another government post.
For the military seems to be
shaping a future for Turkey of a
modified democracy that will
be watched closely by the gener
als. "It will be the kind of de
mocracy that will suit Turkey,"
a military officer said. "We are
just not in a position to say what
kind at the moment."
New constitution
And, when the military an
nounced plans recently for a
constitutional assembly to draft
a new constitution, it specifical
ly excluded not only key politi
cians but also members of all
political parties Apart from the
constitution, the assembly will
propose new laws on elections
and political parties. The gener
als will decide the final form of
the new legislature
Politicians such as Demirel
and Ecevit are prohibited from
making political statements un
der the existing martial-law

decrees.
Human rights
There is also increasing con
cern inside and outside Turkey
on the human-rights issue.
Charges of torture, denied bv
the military, are frequent And
even Turks sympathetic to the
military and thankful that ter
rorism has been stifled think
that it is time to ease the
martial-law edict that allows
anyone to be held for 90 days
without formal charge
The military and many Turks
blame politicians for the coun
try's troubles, and in particular
for allowing the terrorism by
extremists on the left and right
to bring the country to the brink
of anarchy.
Less inflation
In addition to the progress
against terrorism, the pashas,
as generals are called in Tur
key. have had mixed luck with
the economy. They left intact
much of the austerity program
initiated by the Demirel govern
ment and inflation declined
from more than 100 percent last
year to about 30 percent or 40
percent projected for this year.
That program has been accom
panied, however, by recession
and increased unemployment.
