What are the generals plan
ning to do now ? The best guess is
that the new constitution will be
submitted to Turks for their ap
proval sometime next year, and
that elections will follow in 1983.
The constitution is likely to
make more difficult the kind of
political fragmentation and par
alysis of the past, but is also ex
pected to create a strong presi
dency, which may well be as
sumed by the military leader
Gen. Evren.

"The generals do not want to
turn things back to the politi
cians this time until they are
certain that institutional
changes will prevent the chaos
of the past." said a Cabinet min
ister "The limits on freedoms
here will just have to continue
for a while."
Collective bargaining and the
right to strike have been
banned, and leaders of the radi
cal labor union federation
known as Disk have been jailed.
In Western Europe, pressure is
building on Turkey's rulers to
return to parliamentary de
mocracy. But the generals ap
pear to be in no hurry, and so far
the Turks seem to be willing to
give them the time that they
want.
