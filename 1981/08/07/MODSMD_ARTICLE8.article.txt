# Germans hold different view on defense, Soviets

### Associated Press 
Bonn, West Germany â€” Nearly half the West German pub
lic would rather submit to Soviet domination than defend de
mocracy and risk nuclear war, the respected Allensbach In
stitute says in a report on a public opinion poll.
The institute reported 48 percent of 1300 persons questioned
in May said it was more important to preserve peace than risk
a nuclear holocaust in defense of democracy.
The findings reflect growing differences between the West
German government and the Reagan administration over de
fense spending and relations with the Soviet Union.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt told a news con
ference last week he was cutting Defense Minister Hans
Apel's request for an increase of $1.59 billion in West Germa
ny's defense spending nearly 44 percent, to $694 million. He
blamed this and other budget cuts on the Reagan adminis
tration's refusal to bring U.S. interest rates down, saying:
"I told President Reagan that unless the United States
brings its interest rates down, then we will have to cut public
spending everywhere in Europe. High interest rates in Eu
rope force us to reduce public spending and borrowing."
Schmidt's government has also reacted coolly to Reagan's
calls for curbs on trade with the Soviets. Left-leaning politi
cians have expressed fears that Washington is more in
terested in achieving military superiority than in negotiating
arms control agreements with the Kremlin.
West German newspapers devote much space to reports of
growing anti-Americanism and a loose, unofficial "peace
movement" opposed to Western defense policies.
