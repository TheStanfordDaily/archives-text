# C. Americans begin arms race
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Panama City, Panama — An
arms race and a buildup of mili
tary forces is spreading through
the nations of Central America,
military and diplomtic sources
report
Military leaders in the region
are seeking new weapons, new
planes and new sources for both
of them Some countries are
also attempting to upgrade their
capabilities of their military
forces or establish new units.
"It's like a fever." said an
American officer at a U.S base
in the Panama City Canal Zone
"It's sweeping the area "
Experts attribute the ac
celerated arms race to the in
troduction of Russian-made
heavy tanks in Nicaragua
"Now Nicaragua's neighbors
are scurrying to find anti-tank
weapons," said another U.S. of
ficer. "They're shopping for
missies now, but they will soon
be looking for the best anti-tank
weapon — another tank."
Intelligence sources say that
the Sandinista-led government
of Nicaragua, backed by Cuba
and some radical Arab states,
received as many as 100 T-54
and T-55 tanks in air shipments
earlier this summer, some re
portedly from Algeria.
"There are no other heavy
tanks in Central America,"the
second U.S. officer said "In

fact, the U.S. Army Southern
Command in the canal zone has
no armor either "
The leftist regime in
Nicaragua feels threatened by
the army of neighboring Hon
duras, as well as by armed fol
lowers of the late Nicaraguan
dictator Anastasio Somoza who
have found sanctuary in Hon
duras. So the Sandinistas are
trying to train 300.000 civilians
as militia, and are building up
their standing army of about
50,000 men, already the largest
in Central America.
With the only tank force in the
region, Nicaragua poses at least
a potential threat to its neigh
bors — although its spokesmen
insist its tanks are only for de
fensive purposes.
Also, according to a re

searcher for the International
Institute of Strategic Studies in
London, "With the type of ter
rain they have in Central Ameri
ca it would be very difficult to
use tanks. But that won't keep
them from getting them, just
for prestige reasons, or to keep
up with the other generals "
In most of the six Central
American nations — Panama.
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El
Salvador. Honduras and
Guatamela — the military is al
ready the strongest single in
stitution. And some diplomats
see the further strengthening of
the military forces as a growing
threat to the process of de
mocracy in the area.
"The one thing you can do
with tanks," said one U.S. am
bassador. "is send them to sur
round the government buildings
in a coup "
Among the developments:
•Guatemala — with what ex
perts say is Central America's
best army, about 18.000 men, the
government of Guatemala is
now seeking new planes and oth
er equipment for its running
war with four leftist guerrilla
groups based in the moun
tainous northwest.
Negotiations are under way
with the Reagan Administration
to seek ways around the still
standing human rights restric
tions of the Carter adminis
tration.
•Honduras — The govern
ment is asking U.S. help to up
grade its air force, which it
hopes could stop an armored in
vasion from Nicaragua in lieu of
anti-tank missiles. Honduras
wants a simple, all-around
fighter like the Northrup F-5.
•El Salvador — Fighting a
bloody war with leftist guer
rillas in the northern part of the
country. El Salvador is seeking
U.S. military aid. beyond the es
timated $35.7 million in arms
and training ticketed for this fis
cal year. U.S. military men say
that El Salvador desperately
needs more trained officers
•Costa Rica — Costa Rica,
the only Central American na
tion with a democratic tradi
tion, has no army, and only 5000
men in a civil and rural guard.
But shocked by attacks from
antigovernment terrorists. Cos
ta Rica is trying to upgrade the
training of its guardsmen, pay
them more, and increase by 20
percent its spending on public
security.
