# Canadians enter air traffic mess; flights delayed
## 
### 
From the Dailv wire services
Washington — Canadian air
traffic controllers boycotted
aircraft bound to or from the
United States vesterdav. forc
ing long delays in trans-Atlantic
flights as the strike by Ameri
can controllers caused its first
substantial repercussions over
seas.
Nine hours after the boycott
began, the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration announced that
controllers in Gander, New
foundland, would resume han
dling flights from the United
States but would stop again at 4
a.m. EDT.
There was no word from the
Canadian controllers on wheth
er they had suspended their
boycott. Canadian government
officials said only that they had
assembled enough controllers
to briefly operate the Gander
center and help ease the shifting
of flights to the more southern
routes.
While thousands of confused
travelers waited in air termi
nals for word of flight de
partures. Federal Aviation Ad
ministration (FAA) officials
tried to sort out confusion in
their own ranks.
An FAA spokesman first an
nounced yesterday that the
agency had temporarily halted
most air traffic between the
United States and Europe be
cause of the Canadian con
trollers' refusal to handle the
flights. Many transatlantic
flights from East Coast airports
are routed over the edge of Can
ada. But less than two hours lat
er, the same FAA spokesman
said the flights were not sus
pended and never had been.
The confusion over interna
tional flights apparently
stemmed from a three-hour
postponement of transatlantic
flights crossing Canadian air
space at Gander, Newfound
land. A spokesman for Canada's
Department of Transport said
air controllers on the late after
noon shift at Gander had re
ported for work but weren't
working, pending a legal opinion
on their right to refuse to handle
U.S. air traffic.
Meanwhile, American-based
transatlantic carriers received
government clearances to use
southerly routes, avoiding Ca
nadian airspace. Transporta
tion Secretary Drew Lewis said.
But he said the detours will
cause "significant delays" for

international travelers depart
ing from the Northeast United
States, ana that off-scheduling
probably will continue through
noon today.
Spokesmen for Trans World
Airlines and Pan American
World Airways said all of their
flights were expected to takeoff
and use the southerly routes.
Checks with officials at
Dulles International Airport,
the departure point for most
direct flights to Europe from
the Washington area, showed no
cancellation of U.S.-Europe
flights, although a Pan Ameri
can flight to London was ex
pected to be delayed by four
hours.
Some passengers at Kennedy
Airport in New York waiting for
a Scandinavian Airlines plane
found themselves facing an in
definite delay. The plane was
over England en route to pick up
U.S. passengers when it was
directed to return to Copen
hagen because Canadian con
trollers would not allow it to
enter their airspace. Many of
the U.S. passengers spent the
night in hotels.
Controllers in Australia and
New Zealand also have moved
to limit American air traffic.
Australian controllers voted
Monday to refuse to service any
direct flights to or from the
United States beginning at mid
night (10 a.m. EDT) tonight.
New Zealand controllers have
initiated a similar ban, which
will affect primarily the 11
flights a week to the United
States by Air New Zealand.
Lewis and State Department
officials said yesterday they are
working with the Canadian gov
ernment to get flights moving
again between the United States
and Canada. But a State Depart
ment aide, speaking on back
ground, said: "There's not a
whole lot we can do."
The aide said the Canadian
government "is taking a firm
stand" against its protesting
controllers, using many of the
same weapons that President
Ronald Reagan used to dis
cipline striking PATCO mem
bers.
Canadian authorities began
pulling protesting air traffic
controllers off the job at major
Canadian airports shortly after
7 a.m. yesterday, exactly a
week after the PATCO walkout
began here.

Controllers in Australia and
New Zealand also have moved
to limit American air traffic.
Australian controllers voted
Monday to refuse to service any
direct flights to or from the
United States beginning at mid
night (10 a.m. EDT) tonight.
New Zealand controllers have
initiated a similar ban, which
will affect primarily the 11
flights a week to the United
States by Air New Zealand.
Lewis and State Department
officials said yesterday they are
working with the Canadian gov
ernment to get flights moving
again between the United States
and Canada. But a State Depart
ment aide, speaking on back
ground, said: "There's not a
whole lot we can do."
The aide said the Canadian
government "is taking a firm
stand" against its protesting
controllers, using many of the
same weapons that President
Ronald Reagan used to dis
cipline striking PATCO mem
bers.
Canadian authorities began
pulling protesting air traffic
controllers off the job at major
Canadian airports shortly after
7 a.m. yesterday, exactly a
week after the PATCO walkout
began here.
