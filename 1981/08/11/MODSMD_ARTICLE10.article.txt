## Cool temperatures complicate studying

The new wing of Cecil B.
Green Library, whose problem
ridden air conditioner has
caused the building's tem
perature to cirop to a winter-like
60 degrees for most of this hot
summer quarter, will continue
to undergo repairs until Decem
ber, according to officials at the
Heating, Ventillating. Air Con
ditioning (HV AC) division of the
Operations and Maintenance
Department.
The library has received com
plaints since January from staff
and patrons because of uncom
fortable coolness, heat and stuf
finess in different parts of the
building. People have been
wearing sweaters and jackets in
the building.
"I always bring my sweater
when I go to the library," said
student Scott Smallwood. "My
friends kid me, 'Going
skiing?' " but actually it (the
cold is not that big of a deal," he
said.
"It's hard to explain in one
sentence what is wrong," said
Steve Papier, HVAC spokes
man. "Basically the problem is

in the design of the system and it
took a while to show up." He ex
plained that moisture in the con
trols have caused corrosion of
aluminum parts of the system.
"The corrosion began taking
place almost immediately from
the onset of the building's oc
cupancy (late 1979) but it took a
while for it to show up as an ef
fect," he said.
At instances during the year
the systems' air dryer failed
and let moisture into the con
trols which caused corrosion, he
added.
On July 6, installation pro
cedures began for a new $7500
air dryer. The new machine,
built by Lectrodryer of Rich
mond, Kentury, is a heat type
regenative absorption air dryer
while the former, ineffective
one was a refrigerated air
dryer.
"They (library staff) have
complained and theoretically
have seen no action. But there
has been action. We've been
trying to stop it at its source,"
said Papier.
Installation should be fin
ished in mid-September. But
then HVAC will inspect more
than 200 thermostats in the
building and determine if they
need to be cleaned or replaced,
according to HVAC Supervisor
Dick Milam. "That could take
up to a month more," said
Milam "But we have to get that
bridge constructed before we
cross it."

Will falling temperatures result in falling grades? These empty study carrels in Green Library
are notably empty during dead week.
