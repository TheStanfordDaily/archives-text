# OPINIONS
## Hope Nakamura Internee reparations needed 
### 
In the spring of 1942, over
110,000 people of Japanese an
cestry were abruptly and forc
ibly taken from their homes in
the western United States and
herded into deten
tion'concentration camps; sur
rounded by barbed wire, watch
towers and guards armed with
guns pointed inwards The
Japanese were imprisoned in
the camps for more than three
and a half years. Lives were dis
rupted, families separated,
property and educational op
portunities lost, and com
munities destroyed. There were
10 concentration camps in all,
located in the most desolate and
barren parts of the United
States.
However, no charges were
ever brought against the
Japanese for any crime or
wrongdoings; they were found
guilty by reason of race. Al
though the government claimed
the evacuation Vvas a "military
necessity." persons of Italian
and Gentian background were
largely undetained. The irr
carceration indeed stands as
one of the most blatantly racist
acts against an entire people in
U.S. history and in many ways
symbolizes the long history of
repression and resistance that
has been the experience of
Japanese Americans and other
minorities.
It should be understood also
that the camps were no isolated
incident or "mistake." Before
the camps, Japanese had to face
many anti-Asian laws, such as
the Alien Land law and anti-im
migration laws. Since the
camps, the Japanese communi
ty has had to deal with all the
physical and psychological
damage done to community and
family life, and the subsequent

destruction and dispersal of the
community through redevelop
ment. Inequalities in income,
education and job opportunities
are a reality, despite the myth
of the Japanese "model minor
ity" ; census statistics show that
30 percent of all Japanese are
still in the lowest income cate
gory.
The demand for reparations
is a call from the Japanese
American people for the govern
ment to redress the wrongs
committed Monetary com
pensation must be given to the
internees or their heirs for
losses suffered and rights vio
lated during the evacuation and
incarceration.
Many efforts have been made
since that time to obtain just
compensation for the losses suf
fered; however, just compensa
tion has never been received
from the government In 1978, a
JACL-( Japanese American
Citizens League) sponsored bill
was passed by Congress. The
bill set up a Presidential Com
mission on Wartime Relocation
and Internment of Civilians
whose duties are to hold hear
ings and determine whether or
not any wrongs were committed
and whether or not there should
be any remedies for them. The
commission will be coming to
San Francisco this week at
Golden Gate University.
It is clear that the camps
were an injustice affecting the
lives and futures of a whole peo
ple. The effects are still being
felt psychologically, physically,
and economically. On July 12,
1980, the National Coalition for
Redress and Reparations
(NCRR) was formed.
Those of us who are in the
NCCR seek monetary com
pensation — consisting of both
the establishment of a com
munity trust fund and direct in
dividual payments of at least
$25,000 Also we are striving for
education of the general public,
and the overturing of the "le
gal" basis for such incarcera
tion, which still stands in the
books today.
Those who feel that monetary
compensation should not be
made, should know that over
$400 million (1942 dollars) were
lost in property alone. Those
who believe that there was
"military necessity," should
know that President Franklin

Roosevelt initiated a study of
the Japanese American com
munities, before the evac
uation, which concluded that the
Japanese Americans posed no
threat to the United States.
Finally, those who believe
that the evacuation was made
for the safety of the Japanese
Americans should remember
that the armed guards had their
guns pointed at those interned,
ready to shoot any who strayed
too close to the barbed wire sur
rounding their "homes."

ity" ; census statistics show that
30 percent of all Japanese are
still in the lowest income cate
gory.
The demand for reparations
is a call from the Japanese
American people for the govern
ment to redress the wrongs
committed Monetary com
pensation must be given to the
internees or their heirs for
losses suffered and rights vio
lated during the evacuation and
incarceration.
Many efforts have been made
since that time to obtain just
compensation for the losses suf
fered; however, just compensa
tion has never been received
from the government In 1978, a
JACL-( Japanese American
Citizens League) sponsored bill
was passed by Congress. The
bill set up a Presidential Com
mission on Wartime Relocation
and Internment of Civilians
whose duties are to hold hear
ings and determine whether or
not any wrongs were committed
and whether or not there should
be any remedies for them. The
commission will be coming to
San Francisco this week at
Golden Gate University.
It is clear that the camps
were an injustice affecting the
lives and futures of a whole peo
ple. The effects are still being
felt psychologically, physically,
and economically. On July 12,
1980, the National Coalition for
Redress and Reparations
(NCRR) was formed.
Those of us who are in the
NCCR seek monetary com
pensation — consisting of both
the establishment of a com
munity trust fund and direct in
dividual payments of at least
$25,000 Also we are striving for
education of the general public,
and the overturing of the "le
gal" basis for such incarcera
tion, which still stands in the
books today.
Those who feel that monetary
compensation should not be
made, should know that over
$400 million (1942 dollars) were
lost in property alone. Those
who believe that there was
"military necessity," should
know that President Franklin

Roosevelt initiated a study of
the Japanese American com
munities, before the evac
uation, which concluded that the
Japanese Americans posed no
threat to the United States.
Finally, those who believe
that the evacuation was made
for the safety of the Japanese
Americans should remember
that the armed guards had their
guns pointed at those interned,
ready to shoot any who strayed
too close to the barbed wire sur
rounding their "homes."
