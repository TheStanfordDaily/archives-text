## Tax victory promises more good leadership 
### 
Without a doubt, there is a
new approach to presidential
leadership today. In terms of
presidential effectiveness, the
Reagan presidency offers a
sharp contrast to that of the
Carter presidency. President
Ronald Reagan's recent tax cut
victory in the overwhelmingly
Democratic House of Repre
sentatives demonstrates that he
must be doing something right.
In order to understand Rea
gan s success so tar it is impor
tant to do two things: first, to
examine Reagan's new ap
proach to the presidency as well
as his priorities and second, to
look at the implications of his
recent Congressional victories
Reagan acknowledges that
the job of president requires a
great deal of time and energy,
much more than the average
man or woman could possibly
handle. The key to Reagan's ap
proach is to delegate authority
among trusted aides and ad
visors. Such a method worked
well for him as governor of Cali
fornia and will probably work
well for him in the White House.
It is simply impossible, as
former President Jimmy
Carter found out, for a president
to be actively engaged in a wide
range of executive legislation.
To be successful, a president
must also express a sense of
priority. In listing his priorities,
Reagan has placed the econom
ic concerns of the nation at the
top of his agenda. As a result,
the major pieces of legislation
that Reagan has submitted to
the Congress have been econom
ic in nature.
It is easy to draw com
parisons between Reagan's and
Franklin Roosevelt's early
presidential administrations
because both men emphasized
economic matters. By sticking
to economic issues, Reagan has
been extraordinarily effective
in getting his economic plans
passed by both houses of Con

gress.
Attempting to get Reagan's
economic plans passed by the
Congress was hardly an easy ex
ercise in presidential leader
ship. Reagan was well aware
that he had to convince swing
Democrats in the House to sup
port his proposals Reagan was
willing to coddle certain key
Democrats for their political
support.
Carter rarely went to the ex
tent that Reagan did to obtain
support for executive legisla
tion. Perhaps that is why Carter
left the White House with such a
dismal record of legislative ac
complishments.
The implications of Reagan's
recent tax and budget cut vic
tories warrants further ex
amination. First, it now ap
pears that party affiliations, at
least for the Democrats, are no
longer as important as they
once were. Second, the control
over fiscal policy has shifted
from the Congress to the presi
dent via the tax and budget cut
victories. And third, Reagan
has set down a precedent bv
winning the battle of the budget
and tax cuts.
If President Reagan was suc
cessful in getting legislation
passed in the highly sensitive
area of budget cuts and tax
laws, then he should be even
more successful with less con
troversial pieces of legislation.
It is paradoxical that a con
servative Republican adminis
tration is able to get legislation
through a progressive Demo
cratic House. But if Reagan is
able to maintain the success
that characterized his first six
months, then it is likely that the
United States will have for at
least the next three and a half
years an effective executive
branch of the federal govern
ment.
