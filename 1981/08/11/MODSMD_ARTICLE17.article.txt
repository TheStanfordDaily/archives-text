## Controllers made tactical errors 
### 
Although the air traffic controllers strike is
only one week on, some generalizations suggest
themselves:
Firstly, PATCO grossly underestimated the
consequences of their decision to strike. Secondly,
and at least indirectly related to the first proposi
tion, the air traffic controllers grossly over
estimated their own presumed importance. Ap
parently their expectation was that all the Na
tion's airports and airlines would peremptorily
shut down once they walked.
Thirdly, PATCO yielded the high ground to
President Ronald Reagan in permitting him to de
fine the primary issue, namely, do federal em
ployees have the right to strike? My guess is that
most Americans would answer in the negative.
Fourthly, PATCO forced Reagan into a corner
and left him with a minimum of options — a defi
nite no-no according to the wisdom of Herb Cohen
in You Can Negotiate Anything. On January 20,
1981. Reagan took a sworn oath to obey and uphold
all the laws of the land without prejudice There
fore, if he did not act forthrightly criticism would
have been substantial.
Perhaps the most ironic point relates to the
meritorious aspect of the air traffic controllers
grievances; in contrast to the contrived nature of
strikes by other labor unions. There is no question
that their job is stressful. Yet PATCO seems to be
saying that if the government (i.e. the taxpayer)
pays them more money the stress factor will mag
ically become less formidable.
For one, at $33,000 a year, the average air traf
fic controller makes about twice the national av
erage Moreover, as pointed out by Evans and No
vak. if PATCO's demands were met some air traf
fic controllers would receive a higher salary and
work shorter hours than the Secretaries of State
and Defense. These are not among the negotiating
building blocks destined to elicit public support.
Finally, the federal government has shown that

when properly motivated things can be ac
complished with expedition. We have found out,
for instance, the following:
1. There are 9000 applications on file; and 11,000
telephone inquires have been received.
2. 400 newly trained air traffic controllers are
ready to begin work now;
3. New classes will begin August 11 and 31 at the
FA A training center in Oklahoma City.
4. Hundreds and potentially thousands of mili
tary air traffic controllers are available for as
signment and at least temporary duty at com
mercial airports.
5. Many recently retired air traffic controllers
are willing to come back to work.
6. Experienced air traffic controllers and su
pervisors have been shifted from smaller light
volume airports to major heavy-volume airports.
7. The General Accounting Office had previous
ly advised that 2000 air traffic controllers could be
dismissed without adversely affecting either
safety or service (indicating the success of PAT
CO featherbedding) saving some $460 million.
8. 60 towers will be closed and 1000 personnel
dismissed by the end of the year even without a
strike.
PATCO therefore may have done the federal
government a favor, as now the opportunity exists
to reorganize and streamline the system. In sum,
the bottom line shows Reagan holding all the high
cards. It would seem that PATCO members have
been led down the garden path and now face an un
timely and equally unwanted Waterloo.
This is indeed an unfortunate predicament.
Perhaps Reagan will be magnanimous at some
later date. Yet if he sticks to his guns an indelible
lesson will have been learned. Quite likely Calvin
Coolidge, in that big oval office in the sky, would
be pleased.
