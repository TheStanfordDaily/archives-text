## Reagan's victory may be country's Waterloo 
### 
(First of two parts)
Even before its budget and
tax cuts had received final ap
proval from the Congress, the
Reagan administration had
been expressing considerable
optimism about the prospects
for economic recovery.
"I anticipate that this econo
my, being basically healthy,
will bounce back," declared
Murray Weidenbaum, chair
man of the Council of Economic
Advisers. His assessment was
reflected in the mid-year eco
nomic review issued by the Of
fice of Management and
Budget, which took a signifi
cantly upbeat tone
There is, however, reason to
believe that at least part of this
optimism may be premature.
The future of the economy may
not be quite as rosy as the ad
ministration thinks.
Some problems, largely un
foreseen, are likely to result
from the dramatic changes in
fiscal policy that are embodied
in the new budget and tax bills.
For example :
•The inflation indexing pro
vision in the tax bill will
eliminate the problem of
"bracket creep," but it may
also be highly inflationary.
Since income tax rates will no
longer be pushed upward in real
terms by spiraling inflation,
there is a serious danger that a
more complacent public at
titude toward inflation could de
velop.
•The large income tax reduc
tions are likely to have an ad
verse impact on state revenues.
Because several state and local

taxes are tied directly to federal
tax rates, the federal tax cuts
will almost certainly mean low
er state revenues at a time when
many state treasuries are al
ready nearly bankrupt.
Beyond these relatively tech
nical matters, there is also
growing concern that the over
all Reagan economic policies
may be incapable of dealing
with the fundamental problems
of inflation and unemployment.
The economy is now in the
midst of a recession: real gross
national product fell by 1.9 per
cent during the second quarter
of 1981, and an even larger de
cline is expected in the current
quarter.
The administration's main
strategy for combating inflation
thus far — the placement of se
vere constraints on monetary
growth — has been in large part
responsible for the current re
cession.
The admistration is confident
that its monetarist policies will
bring about only a relatively
mild and short-lived recession
that w'll disappear rapidly once
the new budget and tax bills give
the economy a much-needed
boost (at a lower inflation rate)
Despite this official confidence,
however, there are grounds for
being more skeptical about the
administration's approach to in
flation.
For one thing, as many of the
i president's economic advisers
are aware, monetary policy
cannot be executed in isolation;
it must be accompanied by a
sound fiscal policy.
In the long term, therefore,

monetarist policies will be suc
cessful in curbing inflation only
if there is genuine movement
toward a balanced budget. It is
with this concept in mind that
the administration has sought
and achieved cuts of more than
$35 billion in social programs in
next year's budget.
There is a problem, however;
these reductions will be vir
tually negated by the $33 billion
increase in defense expen
ditures; furthermore, the huge
tax cuts over the next three
years will diminish incoming
revenues and thus threaten to
widen the federal deficit even
further.
On this latter point, the supp
ly-side economists in the admin
istration have argued that the
tax cuts will actually increase,
rather than decrease, tax reven
ues by promoting greater pros
perity and thus creating a larger
revenue base on which to draw
(albeit at lower rates) But they
are predicating their claims on
a theory which has worked only
on paper and which is likely to
prove far less successful in
practice.
Rudolph Penner, a leading
conservative economist at the

American Enterprise Institute,
has asserted that the adminis
tration's budget forecasts —
which project a balanced budget
by 1984 — are simply inaccurate
and that annual deficits as high
as $75 billion to $100 billion are
now likely to prevail through the
mid-1980s.
Given the problems of financ
ing such large deficits, the ad
ministration will face an un
pleasant choice: either to main
tain a tight-money policy and al
low interest rates to soar even
higher or to ease restrictions on
the money supply and risk set
ting off a new round of inflation.
Nor is the possibility of an ex
panded federal deficit the only
inflation-related problem
ahead. The 25 percent income
tax reduction will itself spur in
flation by stimulating greater
consumption, with only negli
gible increases in savings and
investment. Although the reduc
tions are heavily slanted toward
the wealthy, who are the most
likely to save and invest, ex
perience in recent years has
shown that much of the extra
money will be spent on con

sumer goods, and not, as de
sired. on savings.
At a time of low inflation, in
come tax cuts might be de
sirabie. but at the present time
— when inflation is still out of
control — the reductions could
be disastrous.
In short, we may ultimately
be heading toward a period of
either prolonged recession or
extremely high inflation (or
both) — something that this
country can ill afford.
These drawbacks to the Rea
gan economic program should
have been a major considera
tion in last month's con
gressional debate. Unfortunate
ly, they were not. The Demo
crats allowed the adminis
tration to set the parameters of
debate, and the so-called "Dem
ocratic alternative" that was
offered was, in most respects,
indistinguishable from the
President's own plan.
On Friday: A real solution to
the economic crisis, and why
Reagan won't use it.
