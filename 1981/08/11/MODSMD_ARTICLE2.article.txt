# 'Whatever happens, happens
## Dupie Press launched 
### 
By Karen Springen
So you forgot to save the one
Dupie comic strip which
capsulized your Stanford ex
perience, huh? Or the one you
read the morning of the physics
final you aced? Or the one your
whole dorm wanted printed on
T-shirts?
Well, don't despair. Dupie
fans who neglected to clip out
and save 1981 graduate Gil Mo
rales' strip can now pick up
Dupie: Life and Times of a Col
lege Student As Seen through
the Pen of Campus Cartoonist
CHI Morales, a collection of 300
cartoon strips which appeared
in the Daily during the past
three years, available at the
Bookstore and the Store.
This summer housemates
Morales and Brett Kingstone,
also Class of '81, formed their
own company. Dupie Press, and
are printing and publishing the
softcover book themselves.
They will distribute it through
out the United States, including
all the B Dalton's and Walden
bookstores in the Bay Area.
Morales cited several reasons
for publishing Dupie. "In the
worst case analysis, it would be
a good way to finish up Dupie
and wrap it up in a nutshell. In
the best case analysis, it could
be a good launching pad," he
said. In any case, he added,
"Whatever happens, happens."
Dupie has a first printing of
5000. Last Friday the Bookstore

received more than 500 copies of
the book, which sells for $4.95.
Kingstone said, "A major
publisher offered us $25,000
down for the book and a very lu
crative royalty agreement
which we turned down because
we want to own our book and
have total say in how it's mar
keted. It's much more profit
able when you publish it your
selves. We have more control
over our own company."
Kingstone said he learned
about publishing through his
own book. The Student En
trepreneur's (iuide, also avail
able at the Bookstore.
Morales concentrates on the
creative and design aspects of
Dupie Press while Kingstone
handles the business end. Mo
rales has final say in artistic and
design matters, said Kingstone
"Gil treats most financial deal
ings with total disinterest."
Dupie Press starts
The partnership was
launched when Kingstone ap
proached Morales and put up
$10,000 for the printing and the
production. "We intend to be
come a major publisher," said
Kingstone. "We've already
been approached by two people
who are interested in having us
publish their books."
He said Dupie Press is nego
tiating for second printing right
now. "We've sold out the first
printing," he said. Kingstone
said he expects that if demand

remains strong, one national
chain of bookstores alone might
take 5000 of the next printing
The partners intend to hit the
Bay Area initially and make a
strong showing, but then "make
the second printing large
enough to give us a very strong
national coverage," Kingstone
said.
But Morales emphasized, "At
this point we have to play it by
ear."
Publicity
The partners have been writ
ten up in The San Jose Mercury
and The Boston Globe. But
Kingstone said, "We were liter
ally avoiding reporters. We
didn't want any stories to run
until the book was out " He said
his book received press cov
erage from the New York Times
and the Wall Street Journal
before it was available which
caused people to to forget about
it, he said.
'' But as soon as the book is out
we're going to start beefing up
the promotion campaign," he
said.
Social commentary
According to Kingstone,
"Dupie is really unique in that
he provides much more than hu
mor. He really makes people
think. Sometimes he makes
them think about themselves,
and sometimes he makes them
think about political and social
commentary."
