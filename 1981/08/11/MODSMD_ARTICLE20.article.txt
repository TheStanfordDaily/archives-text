## Vernal disease: keep it hidden 
### 
What is a workaholic? A de
mented individual with the de
sire to lie on the beach and medi
tate upon the Communist Man
ifesto? An unkept pseudo-in
tellectual slob with the all-en
compassing urge to ski, for the
simple reason of discovering the
true meaning of inertia about a
point in linear and circular mo
tion 9
To me, there are two kinds of
workaholics. First, there are
the really self-destructive work
aholics; those who are truly a
menace to society. Then, there
are the second type, the
epicurean, happy Stanford
Workaholic who actually enjoys
his or her condition.
After years of 2 a.m. pizzas,
fingerprints blurred from the
scarring of typewriter keys, and
subsidizing Maxwell House's
Mountain Grown Columbian
blend, it's time that every Stan
ford student stops what he or
she is doing: I know it's hard,
but stop everything just for a
minute and question your fate:
label your workaholism. It's
now or never.
Do you have droopy eyes, red
from yesterday's 200 pages of
James Joyce? Of course you do.
Have you eaten a meal in more
than 32.4 seconds lately? Of
course you haven't. You are
probably type one. YOU take all
the fun out of workaholism.
That's right. YOU. Take off
your hair shirt and show your
self. You with the whip and the
Linear Algebra. You, crawling

in front of Mem Chu with an ash
covered face and a P-Chem test.
Stop your aceticism Don't
sacrifice your health to die; en
joy dying. That's right, put a sil
ly grin on your face as you page
through Aristotle Neitzsche
can be an erotic experience.
You can win, and win without
the SCHITCK center for the
Compulsive withdrawal from
Slavic Studies as they pertain to
the Political Implications of
Fingerpainting.
The HORROR, the HOR
ROR! Pull out before it's too
late. Don't let your sidewalk be
rolled in at 6:30. Work and enjoy
your work Become type two
and smile through your next
Sanka fix.
If you're already type two,
you're probably sitting on a
nude beach, reading the theory
of relativity and smiling in ec
stacy to learn that apparent
mass doesn't necessarily equal
true mass. You're probably
much better off than type one.
but you have one problem:
you're incurably weird. You
probably don't get along with
people. In front of that intellec
tual, suave interior is an ex
terior with a 24 carat gold vo
cabulary.

You are bizarre. You ask
young girls if they are in
terested in philately. You com
mit piscatorial acts on ships
bearing the American flag. You
dream of emulating your superi
ors. In mixed company you talk
about having Homo Erectus in
the family and your grandfather
who succumbed to a VERNAL
disease
The solution is simple. Keep
your mouth shut about being
anti-semantic, or your morbid
bibliophilia. Start name drop
ping instead.
Say things other people want
to hear like "You know, just the
other day when I was talking to
George Bush, he told me that
name dropping never got any
one anywhere. Anyhow, I'm
from Stanford; that's where
Milton Friedman, Paul Berg
and countless other Nobel prize
winners pass me on numerous
occasions."
Just think, glory. Can a Stan
ford workaholic type two ever
be turned down? Never. Ronald
Reagan told me so just the other
day.
