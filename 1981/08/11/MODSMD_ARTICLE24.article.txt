# Does energy bill reflect utility of utilities?

### Cici Oremland 
A utilities bill for $10,000,000.
That is what the University
will probably pay for gas and
electricity for the fiscal year en
ding this August. The projected
water bill, comparatively, will
be a bargain at only $523,000.
The cost seems outrageous.
But that appears to be the price
of those essential utilities to
day.
University officials said they
do not know how their utilities
usage compares with other sim
ilarly sized institutions. But
they do know that conservation
efforts are proving successful.
University Conservation Spe
cialist John Eaton said,
"Energy use has dropped signif
icantly since the early 70s (with
the emergence of conservation
groups). . .residential student
energy consumption is down 20
to 25 percent."

He also said greater efficien
cy at the central energy facil
ities has led to the decrease.
But overall consumption con
tinues to rise, which Director of
Utilities Gerald Ostrander
called "normal load growth."

Solar projects, even on a small scale, are
slow in achievement.

energy program manager said,
"There are the pluses and the
minuses. . There's been
progress in conservation, but
consumption continues to in
crease due to (energy demands
made by) new buildings and
equipment."
This includes, she said,
energy intensive laboratory fa
cilities and computers that
often need 24-hour power.

To help balance added energy
usages and the exorbitant cost,
the University runs two energy
conservation offices to educate
University housing residents,
department, and office users
about conservation. Through
posted newsletters, com-

parative power usage charts,
and discussions with building
energy managers, they claim
that energy waste problems are
being corrected.
But mistakes occur. When an
empty office building seems ov
erly lit at night, it may be an ov
ersight on the part of the main
tenance crew, or it may be that
the building's main electricity
switch is inaccessible or is

directly attached to the emer
gency power source and cannot
be turned off.
The University energy offices
do not neglect the possibility of
solar-powered heat and water
systems. A limited number of
buildings have been converted
to solar power. Roth House,
Synergy House and the Univer
sity food commissary are all so
lar water heated.
But solar projects, even on a
small scale, are slow in achieve
ment, said Teater.
"There is a lot of competition
for funds for conservation
projects. . .We're still renovat
ing old buildings for design er
rors in (traditional) heating and
cooling (systems) and these
projects are simpler to com
plete," she said.
Because of cost factors, the
new 800 unit dormitory building

project will not be solar water
heated immediately, but the
ineeded piping and architectural
structures necessary to convert
to solar power will be included
so conversion can be im
plemented in the future.
New water conscious efforts
have also been made in the land
scaping for the new dormitory.
The grounds will contain less
grass area and include more
native California drought resis
tant plants.
