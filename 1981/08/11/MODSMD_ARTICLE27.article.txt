# 'Annieâ€™: adorable fluff

Someone once asked W.C. Fields "How do
you like children?"
"Medium rare." he replied.
He obviously never knew seven little girls
like Bridget. Alyson, Kathleen, Senta, Sarah,
Colleen, and Deborah They range in age from
a youthful seven to an experienced 11 and are
the serious actresses who act, dance, and sing
their way through "Annie" in the Golden Gate
Theater
In their time off, they roller-skate, bowl,
swim, and continue training in voice and
dance.
On stage they are neither precocious nor ob
noxious. They dance in close to perfect unison,
they sing on key, and they never miss a cue.
The musical "Annie" is the adaptation of the
comic strip "Little Orphan Annie," the story
of a gutsy little orphan growing up in Miss Han
nigan's home for orphans somewhere below
10th Street in New York City during the great
depression.
Annie (Bridget Walsh) is an 11-year-old with
a very powerful pair of lungs. She's a cute kid
with a disconcertingly gruff voice and boy can
she belt out a tune. "Tomorrow" is a great
melody and she does it very sweetly.
In one of those fairy-tale turn of events,
billionnaire Daddy Warbucks (Harve Pre
snell) decides to take an orphan into his lovely
mansion for the Christmas holidays. Annie is
chosen. Daddy Warbucks falls for Annie's
gumption, optimism, and honesty. He proposes
to adopt her.
Although she loves him, she is determined to

find her real parents, who left her at the or
phanage when she was but a year old. Though
many imposters claim her, her real parents
don't show up. Miss Hannigan's hooligan
brother "Rooster" plans a scheme to claim
Annie and a $10,000 reward Daddy Warbucks
has offered, but his plot falls through when
Daddy Warbucks learns that Annie's real pa
rents died. Annie stays with Daddy Warbucks,
all the orphans come to the mansion for Christ
mas, and everyone lives happily ever after.
The play is about the rebirth of optimism,
the wicked getting their just desserts, good tri
umphing in the end. It's cute. Who can resist
seven throaty little voices singing "It's the
Hard-Knock Life" or "You're Never Fully
Dressed Without a Smile"? Not very many
people.
Because it's a fluff; no subplots, no subtlety
of character, all the comic gestures are over
done. Certainly stage gestures cannot be as
subtle as those in film. But even from row
double Z Miss Hannigan's (Kathleen Free
man) mood can be understood when she knocks
her head against the wall once in irritation. In
stead, she bangs her head nine or 10 times,
staggers around the stage for a good minute
and finally pulls herself straight. It is the same
schtick every time.
The orphans are adorable, the music is a lot
of fun, and the sets are very nice. But you don't
take anything with you when you leave the the
ater. Unless you got a very lousy seat and
ended up doling out six bucks for a pair of very
cheap Japanese opera glasses, which you will
probably never use again.
