# 'Wilde beest’...
## Much better live than vinyl 
### Bob Buika 
Wildebeest has always
puzzled and intrigued me. but I
never seem to be able to put my
finger on it. And so it is with
their debut EP Reckless
Dreams, just recently released
on their own GNU Records this
past month.
The band was fortunate to
have the names of John Kahn
and Jimmy Warren (the long
standing bassist and new key
boardist for Jerry Garcia's
band i running the production
and the Dead studios in San
Rafael to play in for five days.
Kahn and Warren have -added
some synthesizer fills to a few
songs, but at times the produc
tion is rather shabby for such
big names.
Wildebeest might have bene
fitted and saved a lot of monev

by doing their own production,
but that's another subject.
The five songs on the record
cover the band's range of styles
quite well, from the bluesy
ballad. "Love Gone By," to the
driving rhythms of the title
track. Wildebeest is primarily a
live band, that always plays
hard and loud with their own
touch. They have an undeniable
presence on stage, but it's hard
to put stage presence on vinyl,
and Reckless is a bit flat in parts
but there are moments of flair
and finesse.
"Love Gone By" is my favor
ite track. Its vocals are the best
on the record. Rob Leventhal
and Mecca Burns weave their
voices together into a song that
builds well, especially during
the guitar/synthesizer in

terlude. But Burns' vocals tend
to waft away in too much re
verb, and her "improvised"
screams would have been better
left out and saved for the stage.
Eventhal's slide work is tin
ny, and his solo almost falls
apart at the end — saved by a
nice sax fill.
"Cole Younger" has a catchy
riff, but it doesn't go anywhere
between verses, and slips into
chaos with some scratchy har
monica. The vocals are good but
the lyrics I can do without. If
you re going to sing about seeing
favorite whores in Texas or rid
ing with Jesse James, at least
you should give out a lyric sheet.
The band is booked at all
three Keystones in San Francis
co, Berkeley, and in Palo Alto on
September 3.
