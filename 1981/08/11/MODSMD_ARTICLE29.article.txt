# Suburbia may stink -but not in Palo Alto
## 
### Jonathan Treitel 
"Suburbia stinks," said Allen
Ginsberg back in '58. If so, the
news hasn't reached Palo Alto
yet.
"We're proud to be sub
urban," said Susan Mac Donald,
co-boss of the Printers Inc.
Bookstore on California Ave., as
she profferred a plastic cupful
of California Beaujolais — just
to prove it, she and a host of oth
er Bay Area writers have pub
lished an anthology called
Coastlight. ($9.50, Coastlight
Press.) Selections from the
book were read last Wednesday
evening at the bookstore
We milled around, chatting
with old acquaintances, and
picking at the mixed nuts, and a
quarter of an hour later the
reading began.
Kate Abbe, a Bay Area poet
resplendent in an evening dress
— and no bra — cracked a ner
vous joke about the microphone
and launched into Lowellesque
prose and poetry about the
weather, and women, and wom
en and the weather, and so on
Then bluff and bearded Bluff
Bradley declaimed his al
literative, witty, and cynical
poetry — about nothing in par
ticular — unfortunately, it
doesn't read half so good on the
page.
He too, Bradley assured me,
was trying to go beyond "the
sluggish, sybaritic, soporofic"
confines of suburbia.
Finally Susan Mac Donald
read her own gentle

metaphysical poetry: religious
poetry without the religion.
Notable was "Smart
Dithyramb," a eulogy for
whales in the style of Christ
opher Smart's address to his cat
— unfortunately not included in
Coastlight.
And that was the end.
Perhaps you're getting the
impression it's all just suburban
trivia?
Honestly, it isn't. Yet, it is
suburban, but within its limita
tions Coast light's got some
splendid writing. There are con
tributors with ages ranging
from 27 to 70, from the polished
mythology of Rob Swig art to the
collaged anecdotes of Honor
Johnson.
And there's the sturdy in
tellectualism of Virginia de
Araujo, a Stanford Ph D, who
writes with a sense for the
muscularity of poetic forms, a
la Donald Davie:
She feels the back of her own
head/a window, she feels her
cropped dark hair/part, to show
— through a mica shield — the
working brain . . .
And the surrealist imagism of
Abby Niebauer, in a style of
similar to Magrette's:
In one corner a blue bird
hangs/drying its wings, or the
sky/is breaking through the
canvas.
Yes, do browse through
Coastlight when you're next in
the bookstore. Even buy it, if
you're feeling rich.
