# Second Mountz sister gets heart transplant

### Jennifer Seymour 
Just 10 days after her older sister un
derwent surgery for the same heart dis
ease, 13-year-old Lisa Mountz received a
new heart this weekend.
The surgery, performed by Drs. Vince
Gaudianhi, Scott Mitchell. Phil Oyer and
John Wallwork of the Medical Center here,
lasted from 10 p.m. Friday until 2 a.m. Sat
urday.
Mountz, listed in critical but stable con
dition, is now breathing without the aid of a
respirator. She began breathing on her own
early Sunday morning. "She's still in

critical condition, but she's responsive and
able to talk now," reported a Med Center
spokesman. "She'll be okay. "
Lisa underwent heart surgery less than
two weeks after cardiovascular surgeons
here gave her 16-year-old sister Wendy
Mountz a new heart to rid her of the same
disease. Both girls suffered from a de
generative heart condition called idi
opathic congestive cardiomyopathy.
The two girls contracted the dangerous
heart disease within six months of each
other, Wendy was stricken in December,
Lisa in April. This is highly unusual, ac

cording to doctors who are still seeking an
explanation for the sibling sickness.
"The disease is not that rare, but it usu
ally corrects itself," explained Med Center
spokesperson Bobbi Navickis. "It could be
genetic, but there doesn't seem to be any
record of heart problems in the family. It
could be some sort of virus, but docotrs
were unable to find any evidence of active
infection in either girl."
Doctors suspect some sort of virus is
probably responsible, however. "It may
come from a suseptibility similar to when
a person develops a rheumatic heart from

having strep throat," said Navickis.
Cardiomyopathy occurs as a result of
heart damage. The heart, if unable to cor
rect the damage, will enlarge to com
pensate for the injury. "As it gets bigger,
the heart becomes inflamed and inefficient
as a pumping machine," explained
Navickis. "The heart has to work harder
and can't transport blood very well It
eventually becomes conjestive."
Wendy was the sicker of the two girls.
She had been rejected at the Mayo clinic
earlier this year because of the severity of
her condition.
