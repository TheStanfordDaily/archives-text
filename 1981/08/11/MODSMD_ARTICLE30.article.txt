# 'Eye of the Needle’: out of the ordinary thriller
## 
### Gabe Newell 
"Eye of the Needle,"
directed by Richard Marquand
and based on the novel by Ken
Follett, is a spy thriller of the
first order. A good script and su
perb acting raise "Eye of the
Needle" above the normal
shoot-em-up spy or war film.
The plot is relatively straight
forward. Faber, a Nazi spy,
nicknamed "Needle,"— played
by Donald Sutherland — was
planted in England prior to
World War II and is trying to
transmit information about
planned Allied invasion at Nor
mandy.
While attempting to ren

dezvous with a German sub
marine, Needle is shipwrecked
on Storm Island in Northern
Scotland where he meets a leg
less sheep rancher and his wife.
The wife, played by Kate
Melligan, is irresistably drawn
to the dashing and refined
stranger she has found col
lapsed on her doorstep and
Sutherland, not surprisingly is
in turn drawn to her. The sheep
rancher, embittered and
estranged from the world by his
injury, begins to suspect
Sutherland of being and doing
more than he claims.
The movie focuses on the in

terplay of these three charac
ters. Donald Sutherland's cool,
flat portrayal of the Nazi spy
bring a realism to the character
that even the pseudo-Freudian
references to Needle's child
hood that are supposed to ex
plain his motivation cannot dis
pel.
The movie departs from the
usual portrayal of Nazis as evil
and sadistic monsters.
Sutherland's character is be
lievable and almost sympa
thetic.
Here, for probably the first
time, is a Nazi who gets tired,

has doubts about himself, likes
dogs, and plays with children.
This movie is definitely the bet
ter for it.
Kate Nelligan is superb. She
manages the portray in one
short scene the desperate lone
liness of a woman isolated from
the world and the man she loves
and she is full of tight-lipped
British courage, passion or ut
ter terror with equal facility.
But her characterization, like
Sutherland's, begins to weaken
towards the end because her
motivations remain undefined
— especially the last 15 minutes.
"Eye of the Needle" is a
shocking and surprising film.
Even though the final outcome
is known from the earliest
scenes, after all the Germans
were caught unaware at Nor
mandy, the movie still manages
to leave its important questions

unanswered to the very end.
The emotional build-up
focuses on the individual fates
of the characters, rather than
those of the various factions
they represent. This turns a war
story into a much more personal
and realistic tale that makes
Eye of the Needle stand out
from other movies of its genre.
The cinematography in this
film is outstanding. The
luscious views of the English
countryside can almost be dis
tracting at times. The score, on
the other hand, is definitely dis
tracting. mainly for its occa
sional utter incongruity with
what is happening on the screen
During one particularly vi
olent confrontation, the score
was so peculiarly light and
bouncey that one kept waiting
for Julie Andrews to leap
around a corner and burst into
"The Sound of Music."
