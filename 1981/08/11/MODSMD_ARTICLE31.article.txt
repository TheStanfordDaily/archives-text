## ‘X’ rated punks in SF: violence, barbarism with purpose 
### Gina Arnold 
The thief who broke into my
car while I was attending Satur
day night's X concert at the
Russian center in San Francisco
was obviously inspired by X's
performance.
You see, the robbery, hurried
though it may have been, was
neat, clean and purposeful. One
blow to the windshield, door un
locked, and a quick onceover,
which uncovered two purses un
der the seat. No unnecessary vi
olence, nothing destroyed ex
cept that which had to be; noth
ing stolen except those vital
items. And on the pavement by
the scene of the crime, one
dime, so that the victim, (me),
could call for help.
That the incident occured af
ter X was appropriate, for X is a
band which also cleverly
mingles violence with purpose.
A perfunctory crime which still
holds traces of animal
Barbarism is the kind of feeling
which is reflected in X's music.
They are not set on performing
the randomly violent shows that
most current punk bands — es
pecially those from Los Angeles
— do. X writes about
spasmodic, meaningless vio

lence without letting rude self
indulgence interfere with their
playing. They are sparse, or
ganized. driven not by delusions
of grandeur or destruction but
by a relentless purpose and a re
lentless beat which sets them
apart from the other bands of
their kind
From the moment that X hit
the stage around midnight at the
packed Russian Center, they ex
uded a kind of good natured yet
serious aura of power Without
once overstepping their bound,
they played an intense and com
pelling set about the horrors of
the modern world to an au
dience of poseurs and punks.
Each song was tighter and
more powerful than the last, un
til the dance floor became a
trampoline for maniacs and
since the club auditorium is an
upstairs room, the wooden floor
helped to bounce people off each
other Some members of the
crowd ended up on the stage
itself, and jubilantly flung
themselves back head first.
The decidedly casual air of
the whole set-up. combined with
Exene and John Does friendly
chatter gave a rare and
amicable taint to the show

which was derided by some
punk-rockers as being "lacking
in anger." But such punks were
missing the point of the music.
In two hours and five encore
calls, X managed to get through
every song on both their alburns.
Los Angeles and the just re
leased Wild (lift. The more well
known songs, such as "White
Girl," "Los Angeles," and
"Johnny Hit And Run Paulene"
were greetpd with frenzied en
thusiasm by the crowd, and
were carried out with precision
and accuracy by the band, led by
bassist/vocalist John Doe's
frantic conducting, Exene's
weird voice, and Billy Zoom's
perfectly executed, never-end
ing guitar work
Beatific Billy, who stood
calmly surveying the crowd,
legs split wide apart, looking the
epitome of all that is cool in this
world — as anyone who has seen
Penelope Spheeris' Decline of
Western Civilization can attest

— held the whole hand together
with his sly, furious guitar lines.
X's angst; their version of a
destructive world where men in
buses shout obscenities about
Elvis Presley while others in
apartments beat up their girl
friends, is too real to be mere
posing. Because they are
honest, X doesn't need the raw
screaming viciousness most
bands rely on Like many suc
cessful Los Angeles groups,
from the Go-Go's to the Eagles,
there is a finely meshed and
carefully constructed melodic
quality to their work which per
meates even their roughest,
meanest material
It is almost as if the aura of
Hollywood, the very shadow of
the RKO tower, affects even the
blackest LA bands
X hides behind a tough,
apocalyptic exterior a brilliant
interior. This is no run of the
mill garage punk band. This
concert exposed the star uualitv

which vaulted them above othei
hard working bands with last
years critically acclaimed Lot
Angeles album
No Alternative was billec
second and played a hard fasl
set of "punkabilly," until leac
singer Johnny Genocide's new
romantic hair do began to sap
with sweat. No Alternative'?
concept — sort of Gene Vincent
on crystal meth: rockabilly cum
punk — is interesting, and work
well for a short period of time
All in all. Saturday's show
was almost worth the price ot a
smashed-in windshield, and at
least this event was in keeping
with the band in question
X is one of the few really im
portant bands to emerge in the
BO's so far — a band with an at
titude and something to say
amid a sea of ponseurs purvey
ing. in Johnny Rotten's im
mortal words "a tuneless
racket."
