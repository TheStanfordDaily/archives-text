Neutron bomb needed for 'strength'
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger said yesterday that it was necessary to go for
ward with the production of neutron weapons in order
to lay to rest the imageof "vacillation" and of a "weak,
divided America" left by the Carter administration,
which abandoned earlier plans to put the warheads into
production.
Weinberger and other officials also said that they de
cided last week to produce neutron weapons because
failure to dc so would have amounted to a conscious de
cision not to assemble a weapon whose components had
been ordered into production by Congress.
The controversial decision, disclosed over the week
end. has been denounced by Moscow and criticized by a
few U.S. allies in Europe who wondered why the United
States decided to go ahead with the weapon at this time.
The process of developing the components had got
ten to the point where we had to make a conscious de
cision not to assemble them,' a Department of State of
ficial said.
Noting that the neutron warhead is uniquely designed
to overcome the massive superiority by the Soviets in
conventional forces in Europe — especially a 3-to-i su
periority in tanks — Weinberger said that production of
the weapons has already begun.
NATO protests over neutron bomb
Paris — Governments of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization protested yesterday over President
Ronald Reagan's decision to go ahead with production
}112 the neutron bomb — even though there are no present
jlans to deploy the weapon in Western Europe.

Officially, most NATO governments continued to say
that the decision is purely an internal American affair,
avoiding any statements of support or endorsement.
However, the Danish government joined Norway in an
nouncing opposition to the decision, and observers said
political repercussions are likely to pose serious prob
lems in West Germany, Holland, Belgium and Italy.
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany came
under immediate pressure from his Social Democratic
Party in Bonn, which issued a formal statement calling
on the government "to insist during necessary alliance
negotiations that a position be taken that the weapons
not be brought to deployment in Europe."
The statement also criticized Reagan for making a
decision that it said, "will hand new arguments" to
those in West Germany who seek to provokeanti-Amer
icanism and is likelv to impede progress on East-West
arms talks.
