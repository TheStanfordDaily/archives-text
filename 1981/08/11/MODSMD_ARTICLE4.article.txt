Members of the Greenpeace organization cruise near the ex
ploratory oil-drilling rig Zapata Saratoga on Georges Bank last
week off the Massachusetts coast. The oil-drilling rig is operating
for Shell Oil to determine if there are commercially viable quan
tities of petroleum or gas beneath the fishing grounds. Opponents
of the drilling claim an oil spill could upset the delicate ecosystem
of the fishing grounds and severely damage the important fish
eries.
