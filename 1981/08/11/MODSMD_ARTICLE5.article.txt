### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Except for the
poorest nations, the world's de
veloping countries came
through the economic "con
vulsions" of the 1970s surpris
ingly well. leading to a hope that
the outcome for the 1980s will be
no worse than the past decade's
"and may indeed be somewhat
better."
That is one of the key con
clusions of the fourth annual
World Development Report,
published over the weekend by
the World Bank
This year's report is designed
to examine the international
economy and how the individual
developing countries have ad
justed to changes brought about
by external factors. Chief
among these are the problems
caused by recessions in the
richer industrial nations and by
high oil prices imposed by the
Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries (OPEC).
In essence, the report found
that the rich nations, the OPEC
group, and the "middle in
come'' developing countries
with a per capita income of
more than $370 survived the
pressures well, but that those
below the $370 per capita mark
are "being left behind, and
(are) facing a further de
terioration in their prospects."
Helen Hughes, director of the
bank's department of economic

analysis, told a press con
ference that the developing na
tions as a group had a better
growth record in the 1970s than
did the industrial nations and
had achieved "remarkable"
success in improving their abili
ty to feed their populations. In
dia. especially, was cited for a
dramatic change" in achiev
ing self-sufficiency in agricul
ture.
However, projections for eco
nomic growth in the 1980s were

not so positive. The outlook for
economic growth in the in
dustrial countries was labeled
as "somewhat worse" than was
projected in last year's report.
"Both the relative and the
absolute gaps between the
richest and poorest countries
will widen in years ahead, in
cluding the gap between middle
and low-income developing
countries." the report con
