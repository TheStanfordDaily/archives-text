Banjul, Gambia — Gambian President
Dawda J awara has hinted that the insurrection
that was put down in his country last week may
force Gambia — known in recent years for its
democracy — to be more concerned with se
curity than with domestic freedoms in the
future.
Several thousand soldiers from Gambia's
larger neighbor. Senegal, were called in to sup
press the bloody uprising.
"These events have proved that (domestic
stability) is a very fragile thing." Jawara said
at an hour-long press conference Saturday.
"We cannot toy with the security of the state." •
Jawara said he wants to integrate Gambia's
security forces with Senegal's.
Jawara added that he is still committed to
democracy but said "we have to strike a bal
ance" between political security and human
rights
Leftist civilians and part of the country's

900-member police force attempted to over
throw the government on July 30. Jawara was
in London at the time attending the wedding of
Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.
At Jawara's request and in conformity to a
16-year-old mutual defense treaty between the
two countries, Senegalese President Abdou
Diouf sent in troops on the afternoon of the
coup attempt. The Senegalese troops captured
Banjul Aug. 2 and finally chased the rebels out
of a suburban paramilitary police barracks on
Thursday.
Interviews with Gambians indicate the resi
dents of Banjul welcomed the coup with cheers
the first day. but lost their enthusiasm when
prisoners released from jail and armed by the
rebels began indiscriminate killing
Gambians said that the initial public support
for the rebels stemmed from Gambia's de
teriorating economic situation and an aus
terity budget that the government introduced
in Julv.
