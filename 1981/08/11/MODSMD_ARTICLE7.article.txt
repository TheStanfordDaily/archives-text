## New foreign policy to counter Soviet threat China builds ties in Third World 
### Washington Post 
Beijing — Juggling trade, aid
and diplomatic good will, China
has launched a wide-ranging
foreign policy offensive in the
Third World, where it believes
the Soviet Union will mount its
most important challenges in
coming years.

News analysis

Beijing is pursuing the policy
with an ecumenical flair, em
bracing Latin American gener
als and African Marxists. Chi

nese statesmen have traveled
from Rangoon, Burma, to Bue
nos Aires hoping to block or at
least neutralize Soviet in
fluence.
Although China regards itself
as a Third World nation and has
long played an active role in
Asia and Africa, it has devoted
its diplomatic energy in recent
years to building an anti-Soviet
coalition with Japan, Western
Europe and the United States.
Having secured those
strategic ties, China set out to
renew its Third World creden
tials last year, accelerating the
process after Secretary of State
Alexander Haig met with Chi
nese leaders here two months
ago.
The Haig visit produced mix
ed results. It advanced Sino-
American relations by produc
ing Washington's offer to sell
arms to Beijing. But the rela
tionship continued to stumble
over the unresolved issue of
U.S. policy toward Taiwan.
Since then, Beijing not only
has shifted its diplomatic focus
from the West to the Third
World, but also has sharply
criticized Washington for driv
ing Arabs, Africans and Asians
into the Soviet fold by support
ing "reactionary governments"
in Israel, South Africa, South
Korea and Taiwan
Although some diplomats be

lieve the diplomatic offensive
foreshadows a new Chinese
alignment with the Third World
and independence from the
West, most analysts have con
cluded that the attacks against
Washington were simply in
tended to boost China's stock
among developing nations
where American influence is
low.
Beijing's new emphasis on
the Third World springs from its
view of the Soviet Union as a
major threat bent on domi
nating the world bv encircling
China and cutting off the West
from vital natural resources,
especially oil.
Beijing feels especially vul
nerable in the Third World, fear
ing Soviet advances in the
strategically important Indian
Ocean and Horn of Africa as
well as the Persian Gulf.
The Soviets, according to Bei
jing, already have threatened
China's security by occupying
neighboring Afghanistan and by
giving arms to Vietnam to
challenge China's southern
border and prop up an anti-Chi
nese government in Cambodia
"The Soviet Union takes the
United States as its main con
tender and Europe as its
strategic point of contention
declared the Communist Party
newspaper People's Daily last
month. "However, for
time to come, it will take the
crucial areas in the Third World
as the main areas in which tu ex
pand its strength "
Beijing began formulating a
strategy to meet that challenge
last year, according to Thir ]
World diplomats, and devised a
policy that varies according to
Beijing's distance from the de
veloping nation involved.
The offensive is marked by
the flexibility that has charac
terized China's diplomacy in re
cent years, enabling Beijing to
sue for peace with India while
renewing military aid to Paki
stan, to pledge to withhold ma
terial support from communist
insurgents in Southeast Asia
while arming Khmer Rouge
guerrillas in Cambodia, and to
denounce Israeli militarism
while helping to build Zaire's
Navy.
Beijing supplies weapons to
Khmer Rouge insurgents fight
ing the Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia while supporting dip
lomatic moves by noncom
munist nations in Southeast
Asia — including the recent
United Nations conference — to
put pressure on Hanoi.
Zhao also is expected to re
new China's pledge to restrict
its relations with outlawed com
munist insurgents in Southeast
Asia to "the political and spiri
tual level."
