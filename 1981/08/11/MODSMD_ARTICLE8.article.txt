# Defense Dept. urged Reagan OK on neutron weapons

Washington — President
Ronald Reagan's recent de
cision to produce neutron weap
ons in the U.S. was apparently
forced by the competing de
mands for limited amounts of
atomic materials in the
stepped-up nuclear weapons
building program.

News analysis

The main pressure, though,
came from the U.S. Army, rep
resented by Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger in a strong
advocacy of the controversial
new generation of nuclear
weapons.
The Army's new "integrated
battlefield" strategy for Eu
rope — which involves prepar
ing American forces to fight
conventional, nuclear and
chemical battles all at once — is
highly dependent on its units
possessing neutron weapons,
according to Pentagon sources.
Reagan's decision makes the
Army's "integrated bat
tlefield" idea real for Europe
ans — which could create as big
a furor in NATO countries as did
the 1977 disclosure that the Unit
ed States was going to build neu
tron weapons.
Uneasy allies
NATO allies — particularly
West Germany, the Nether
lands and Belgium — have nev
er been at ease with the notion
that short-range nuclear weap
ons are designed for use on their
territory. In fact, NATO has
never been able to agree on tac
tics for using these weapons.
The "integrated battlefield"
is the Army's idea of how it
would work, not on American
territory, but in Western Eu
rope.

On explosion, neutron weap
ons produce killing levels of ra
diation that travel a greater dis
tance than the weapon's de
structive heat and blast effects.
In comparison, the nuclear bat
tlefield weapons now in the
hands of U.S. and NATO forces
in Europe have blast and heat
effects which far outdistance
their radiation.
Neutron advo&tes
Advocates of neutron weap
ons say they would cause less
collateral damage in heavily
populated areas of Western Eu
rope than would the nuclear
weapons now deployed there.
In addition, they say the neu
tron weapons' radiation effects
would help defend against Sovi
et tank attacks, because the ra
diation would penetrate tank ar
mor and kill the crews far more
easily than the heat and blast
from the currently deployed
weapons could destroy the vehi
cles.
Since the mid-19705, the Army
has been preparing for acquisi
tion of neutron versions of its 56-
mile-range Lance missiles and
22-mile-range, eight-inch artil
lery shells.
Timing of the decision
But the timing of last week's
decision "was driven by the pro
duction demands" of the entire
U.S. nuclear weapons program,
which is run by the Department
of Energy, sources said Sunday.
The United States is now em
barked on the greatest nuclear
weapons-building program in
its history, which includes a new
Trident I submarine-launched
missile; a new warhead for the
land-based Minuteman III; new
strategic and tactical nuclear
bombs; a new long-range, air
launched cruise missile, and
plans for the proposed MX mis
sile.

This creates competing de
mands for the limited amounts
of nuclear materials used in
these warheads and for space in
industrial facilities around the
country where these weapons
are manufactured. As a result,
the Energy Department wanted
an immediate decision on neu
tron weapons.
Carter's plan
The plan in effect when Rea
gan took office was established
by President Jimmy Carter in
1978. It called for producing all
the components of the neutron

weapons but assembling only a
portion of the Lance warhead
and eight-inch shell.
As a result, the Army was to
have received relatively low
yield nuclear weapons that
could be converted to more pow
erful neutron ones with the in
sertion of a»component that was
to be held separately.
Army generals had tried for
three years to reverse the
Carter decision. When the Rea
gan Pentagon team came into
office, the Army repeated the
arguments it had made unsuc

cessfully to the Carter adminis
tration :
Conversion of the new weap
ons to neutron ones would take
months. And if the low-yield
weapons were all the Army was
going to get, it would need more
of them because they were less
powerful than the neutron ver
sions the planning envisioned.
Weinberger's support
The generals quickly found
they had an ally in Weinberger.
They wrapped up their case by
saying that if the production de
cision were made before this
autumn, no time would be lost
from their original planning.
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig, according to sources, had
proposed a delay of the neutron
production decision until
spring.
He argued that raising the
neutron issue before then could
endanger the more important
NATO plan to deploy 572 longer
range weapons — cruise and
Pershing II ballistic missiles.
Unlike the short-range neu
tron weapons, these missiles,
although based in Western Eu
rope, would be aimed at targets
more than 1000 miles away in
the Soviet Union.
According to sources, Wein
berger opposed Haig, arguing
that a delay on producing neu
tron weapons until next spring
would upset the Energy Depart
ment's nuclear production
schedules and give opponents of
neutron weapons a new target
date.
Internal decision
The defense chief also said
that producing nuclear weapons
was an internal U.S. decision
and should not be made under
pressure from other countries,
an argument, sources said, that
appealed to Reagan.
