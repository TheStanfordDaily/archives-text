Paris — Miles-long lines of marchers converged in Paris
last Thursday, joining thousands of Hiroshima anniversary
observers worldwide in protesting the spread of nuclear
arms.
Many of the estimated 10,000 who paced themselves to a
slow drum beat under rain-darkened skies had started the
"March for Peace" in Copenhagen June 22 and carried their
message across five countries, a 745-mile route.
In cities across the United States, nuclear weaponry oppo
nents marked the 36th anniversary of the Aug. 6,1945, atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, with marches, sit-ins, pray-ins
and other activities.
About 40,000 people gathered at Hiroshima's Peace Memo
rial Park in Japan to send burning candles afloat in the
Motoyasu River and watch the release of 1500 doves, symbols
of peace.
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki reiterated Japan's pledge
never to make, keep or introduce nuclear weapons, saying,
"As the only nation which has suffered the conflagration of
nuclear weapons, there is no limit to our rage toward nuclear
war."
The U.S. bombing of Hiroshima marked the first use of
atomic weapons in warfare, and was followed three days lat
er by the A-bombing of Nagasaki, leading to Japan's sur
render in World War Two. The Japanese say about 200,000
people died in the attacks, and on Thursday, the names of 2757
Hiroshima victims who died in the past year of radiation-re
lated diseases were added to the roll of the dead.
