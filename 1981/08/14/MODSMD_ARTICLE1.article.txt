Construction begins next
month on the first part of the
new 800-unit, $36.2 million un
dergraduate housing project on
the open field next to Lagun'ta
Court.
According to project man
ager Robert Nerrie and As
sociate Dean of Student Affairs
for Residential Education Nor
man Robinson, the new housing
should take undergraduates out
of Manzanita trailers and supp
ly on-campus housing for some
of the 150 to 550 other students
whose housing needs are unmet
now.
"In essence, we are supplying
housing for only 350 new stu
dents but we are moving 450 un
dergraduates out of Manzanita
and into an environment that
will hopefully be more social."
said Robinson.

The project features three
types of housing: three inde
pendent houses, much like the
three Row houses that were
built in 1975 only slightly larger;
four buildings of four to six stu
dent suites, a concept new to the
University, and the Ann and
J.E. Wallace Sterling Housing
Quadrangle, a group of con
nected houses modeled after
Lagunita Court.
The three independent
houses, one already reserved as
the East Asian house, will hold
60 students each. They will have
their own kitchens and dining
rooms.
"This type of housing is espe
cially good for groups of stu
dents who would like to organize
themselves and have more in
teraction with each other." said
Nerrie. "We used the Row
houses as our square footage
standards but made the new
houses slightly larger."
The four suite buildings are a
new type of housing here. "With
the suites we are trying to take
the best aspect from the trailers
of living with just a few close
friends while getting rid of the
anti-social aspect of the trailers
having their own kitchens. The
students in the suites will eat in
eating clubs but live in a very
nice apartment-like at
mosphere. This type of housing
is most attractive to the up
perclassmen." said Robinson.
The connected houses, named
for the University's former
president and current chan
cellor J.E. Wallace Sterling
and his wife, will consist of four
co-ed houses of 90 students
each with a resident fellow. The
connected houses will be self
contained as a group with their
own large dining room that is
rigged for lighting and sound to
double as a multi-purpose room
for plays and dance recitals.
