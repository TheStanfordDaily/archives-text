# Traffic saftey agency will stop telling public of some auto recalls
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington — The Reagan administration,
saying it may be "irresponsible to publicize"
some automobile recalls, will not tell the public
every time one is ordered.
Raymond Peck, head of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, said this week that
the agency will issue press releases about recalls
only when they are "necessary for auto safety."
Peck said the policy was not in conflict with
Carter administration practices, but his prede
cessor, Joan Claybrook, disputed this.
"This is a change," she said. "Our policy was to
have press releases on all recalls unless the manu
facturer did it. We tried to keep the public
notified."
Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Corp. and
Volkswagen of America reportedly have con
ducted unannounced recall programs in recent
months. They have sent letters to registered
owners of the vehicles, as required by law.
Claybrook said 25 percent of owners don't re
ceive the recall notices because they have moved
or other reasons.
But Peck said there is no reason to tell the pub
lic about all recalls. "The purpose of a recall is to
have it removed from use," he added. "It is not to
create publicity or condemn manufacturers."
He said a public statement from the govern
ment helps sometimes, especially when the recall
is major or the defect a serious one. "In ap

propriate circumstances, I will do exactly what
my predecessors did," Peck said.
When the cars are fairly new, however, it is
easy to reach the owners, he said. In such a situ
ation, there is no reason to tell the general public,
he said, adding, "When there is no safety benefit,
it may be irresponsible to publicize it."
Peck, an attorney, said manufacturers know
they are open to a flood of lawsuits if they don't do
their best to tell owners about a recall. He said
this will motivate companies to pursue recalls
vigorously.
Roger Maugh, director of Ford's office of auto
motive safety, said Ford considered daybook's
policy on recall announcements to be that "she
would announce it if we didn't." Because of this,
he said. Ford announced all its recalls.
Maugh said the company decided last fall not to
announce many recalls voluntarily undertaken by
the company.
Ford conducted eight recall campaigns recent
ly without telling the news media, the Detroit
Free Press reported. These affected thousands of
new Escort and Mercury models and their sports
car derivatives, the Ford EXPand Mercury LN7,
the newspaper said.
Maugh said the automaker had not issued press
releases because the problems were considered
low risks and announcements "would induce
some alarm in the public that is unjustified. "
