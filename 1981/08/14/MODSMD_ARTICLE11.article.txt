# Solidarity calls for halt to hunger strikes, marches
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland â€” Poland's
independent trade union feder
ation Solidarity this week called
for a halt to all hunger marches
and strikes in an effort to defuse
tensions caused by growing dis
content over food shortages
here.
A union communique said
that Poland was in a "tragic
state'' and that its demand to
"cease all strikes and protests"
symbolized its constructive at
titude in the present crisis. The
union also urged its members to
work an additional eight free
Saturdays to help rebuild the
country's shattered economy.
But Solidarity vigorously de
nounced the communist govern
ment as the source of the crisis
and warned that it would call a
nationwide strike of printers for
next week if the authorities con
tinued their propaganda cam
paign against the independent
union.
The communique, issued af
ter three days of meetings by
Solidarity's national executive
committee at Gdansk, comes
before the expected visit to the
Soviet Union later this week of
Polish Communist Party leader
Stanislaw Kania.
Over the past two weeks, Po
land has experienced a wave of
popular discontent that Kania
described Tuesday as possibly

leading to the country's
"greatest ever national
catastrophe." The union action
Wednesday appeared designed
to shift public grievances away
from street demonstrations
over food shortages to more
manageable issues such as
union access to mass media.
In an apparent move to break
the impasse that followed the
collapse of government-union
talks last week. Kania was re
ported Wednesday to have
asked for what would be his first
meeting with Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, the new Roman Catho
lic primate of Poland, presum

ably to seek church mediation.
At the moment, however,
there are no indications when
direct talks will be resumed be
tween the union and the govern
ment.
The union executive commit
tee also said that it has decided
to coordinate future protests
and that regions are supporting
this move.
One potentially explosive
demonstration scheduled for
next week was a nationwide
march converging on Warsaw to
protest continued detention of
political prisoners.
