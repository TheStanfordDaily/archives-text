# S. Africa won't renew 20,000 work permits
## 
### Washington Post 
Cape Town, South Africa â€” In
a move that may add to the eco
nomic difficulties of its black
ruled neighbor, Zimbabwe,
South Africa has decided not to
renew the work permits of
20,000 Zimbabweans employed
in South Africa when the per
mits expire during the next 12 to
18 months.
A government spokesman
said the South African decision
complied with Zimbabwe's an
nounced desire to keep its na
tionals home, but the action nev
ertheless will probably be re
garded in Salisbury as one more
turn of the economic screw and
may intensify the recent sour
ing of relations between the two
countries.
In many small ways the South
African government has in
dicated an unwillingness to ex
tend more than the very min
imum of aid to Zimbabwe. In
contrast, it gave generous eco
nomic backing to the former
white minority government in
Salisbury.
South Africa has refused to
continue leasing 21 diesel
locomotives to the Zimbabwe
railroads, saying it needs them
at home. It also refused to re
new the lease of an airplane to
Air Zimbabwe, putting the
plane up for sale instead.
In May, South Africa an
nounced that its preferential
trade agreement with Zim
babwe would not be renewed
when it runs out next year.
South African Prime Minister
Pieter Botha said of this action
that he did not think cooperating
amicably with neighboring
black states meant that South
Africa "should play Father
Christmas" to them.
In explaining South Africa's

decision not to renew the work
permits. Johan Oosthuizen, a
spokesman for the Ministry of
Cooperation and Development,
which deals with black labor,
said that Zimbabwean Informa
tion Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira announced in Feb
ruary that his government
would no longer issue travel
documents to persons who
wanted to work in South Africa.
Reports at the time, however,
indicated only that
Shamuyarira discouraged Zim
babweans from seeking work in
South Africa and voiced his gov
ernment's disapproval of the
practice.
In addition, a spokesman for
the Black Sash, a South African
organization that helps blacks
through the maze of regulations
that govern their lives, said no
white employers had com
plained of Zimbabwean in
terference with travel of work
ers to South Africa.
At any rate, on July 13 South
African labor bureaus were or
dered not to renew the work con
tracts of Zimbabweans since
they would not have the re
quired travel documents,
Oosthuizen said.
"It was not a decision by our
government," Oosthuizen said.
"You cannot have employees in
your country without the con
sent of their government."
Zimbabwe, it is true, has had
a hand in the loosening of eco
nomic and labor relations be
tween the two countries. Like
its black-ruled neighbors, it has
declared its intention to reduce
its economic dependence on
South Africa. One way the black
states have sought to do this is
by decreasing the number of
their citizens who work in South
Africa
