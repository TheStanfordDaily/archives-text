# Profile—Prof. Nanney
## Organist 'pipes' music into church over 30 years 
### Marianne Villanueva 
For 34 years, Professor
Herbert Nanney of the Univer
sity music department has filled
Memorial Church with the rich,
rolling tones of its 3355-pipe
Murray Harris organ
He has played at Sunday ser
vices and at weddings, for high
school baccalaureates and for
choir concerts. And he has of
fered his services to religious
groups in "hymn-sing" and
masses.
He has also instructed stu

dents in the art of organ
playing, and lectured on such
topics as "The Music of J. S.
Bach" and"The Music of
Mozart."
When lie became the Univer
sity organist in 1947, the campus
was filled with "older, more se
rious" students who had de
ferred their studies during the
hectic war years.
Nanney said, "All the pro
fessors wore coats and ties, and
women had to wear skirts and
stockings on the Quad. We didn't

call each other by our first
names — not even out students.
It was always miss or mister.
As a boy growing up in Whit
tier, Calif ~ 13 miles southeast of
Los Angeles, he said he "en
joyed listening to the organ at
church and in movie theaters "
Those were the days of the silent
movies, when the film was ac
companied by the auditorium
filling sound of the big pipes,
played by a real live artist.
"I liked the sound of it. It had
a lot of variety, a lot of power,"
Nannev said. "As a boy I used to
take piano lessons, but it was
always in the back of my mind
that I would switch to the organ
when I got big enough."
He started playing the piano
at five, and the organ when he
was 15. "I had to wait until I was
big enough to reach the pedals."
he explained
At 21, he had become assis
tant organist at Stanford, where
he was studying for his master's
degree in music.
Shortly after having com
pleted his studies at Stanford,
he was selected to be one of six
scholars then studying organ at
the school.
"It was a highly competitive
place," he said. "Every student
there was on a scholarship, and
had been picked by a committee
because they were the best in
their particular field of music
Students were expected to work
hard and learn lots of pieces, all
of which had to be memorized

If you didn't meet these stan
dards, they could terminate
your scholarship at any time."
The two criteria which stu
dents were expected to meet
were "excellence of per
formance and the ability to give
recitals," he said
Nanney's teacher, Alexander
McCurdy, was extremely strict.
"He had an old-fashioned style
of teaching," Nanney said. "He
told you what he wanted you to
do, and without very much dis
cussion, you did it. He expected
perfection in the notes. He was
very disciplined,"
While at Curtis, Nanney
worked part-time as the or
ganist at the Ninth Presbyterian
Church of Philadelphia. There
he met his wife, Jean, who had
come "from California to be
come religion educator at the
church," he said.
Before he had completed his
studies at Curtis, the war broke
out. Nanney joined the army
and travelled to England and
France with the Medical Ser
vice Corps. He was head
quartered in Paris, and there he
played the organ and directed
the choir at the American
Cathedral. He also spent three
months taking course on "or
gan. counterpoint, and harmo
ny" at the Paris Conservatory
under Marcel Dupre.
"I was sponsored by the
American Army Education Pro
gram. so everything was free,"
he said. Smiling he added: "Af
ter the war, all those young kids
were running around with noth
ing to do. The army had to think
of something to keep them out of
trouble."
When he returned to the Unit
ed States. Nanney went back to
Curtis to complete the work for
the Artist's Diploma. He re
ceived it in 1947.
That year, he returned to
Stanford and became Univer
sity organist, a position he has
retained ever since.
Nanney has seen many
changes in Stanford over his
three decades of teaching here.
For one thing, methods of tech
ing have changed.
"The old method was when
the teacher told the student
what to do, and the student did

it. But now, we're co-learners,
particularly with the graduate
students. Teachers have
learned to be more flexible."
Each decade has brought new
changes.
"The '50s were college prank
days," Nanney said. "In the
'60s. we had the big change. It
was a disturbing period. Stu
dents were greatly concerned
about social issues, and they
didn't work too hard."
"In the '70s, we had a conser
vative trend, with more individ
ualsm. more competition," he
said.
In comparing the '60s with the
'70s, "a little mixture of the two
might be good," Nanney said
Over the years, his students
have ranged from Charles Fisk,
founder of the Charles Fisk Co
of Boston and "one of the better
organ-builders in the country to
day" according to Nanney, to
John Walker, associate musi
cian at Riverside Church in New
York.
The head of the music depart
ment at Mills College is a
former student, as is the editor
of Diapason, the national or
ganist journal. His former stu
dents can be found in the music
facilities of such schools as the
University of Washington, the
University of Seattle, San Fran
cisco State, Chico State, San
Jose State, UC-Santa Barbara
and Temple University.
Bill Ramsey, choir director
at Memorial Church, said: "He
(Nanney) is enormously gifted.
He's a fine musician, a fine im
provisor, with an excellent
sense of timing."
"He's an invariably cheerful
and supportive person," Edie
Bridges, secretary to the dean
of the chapel, said "When any
thing goes wrong — at wed
dings, for example — and there
are last-minute changes, you
just have perfect confidence
that he can bring it off with
great flair."
Nanney's skills extend to
areas other than organ-playing.
"At our staff club Christmas
parties," Bridges said, "he's
wonderful at leading groups in
singing popular songs around
the piano."

changes.
"The '50s were college prank
days," Nanney said. "In the
'60s. we had the big change. It
was a disturbing period. Stu
dents were greatly concerned
about social issues, and they
didn't work too hard."
"In the '70s, we had a conser
vative trend, with more individ
ualsm. more competition," he
said.
In comparing the '60s with the
'70s, "a little mixture of the two
might be good," Nanney said
Over the years, his students
have ranged from Charles Fisk,
founder of the Charles Fisk Co
of Boston and "one of the better
organ-builders in the country to
day" according to Nanney, to
John Walker, associate musi
cian at Riverside Church in New
York.
The head of the music depart
ment at Mills College is a
former student, as is the editor
of Diapason, the national or
ganist journal. His former stu
dents can be found in the music
facilities of such schools as the
University of Washington, the
University of Seattle, San Fran
cisco State, Chico State, San
Jose State, UC-Santa Barbara
and Temple University.
Bill Ramsey, choir director
at Memorial Church, said: "He
(Nanney) is enormously gifted.
He's a fine musician, a fine im
provisor, with an excellent
sense of timing."
"He's an invariably cheerful
and supportive person," Edie
Bridges, secretary to the dean
of the chapel, said "When any
thing goes wrong — at wed
dings, for example — and there
are last-minute changes, you
just have perfect confidence
that he can bring it off with
great flair."
Nanney's skills extend to
areas other than organ-playing.
"At our staff club Christmas
parties," Bridges said, "he's
wonderful at leading groups in
singing popular songs around
the piano."

For 34 years, Professor
Herbert Nanney of the Univer
sity music department has filled
Memorial Church with the rich,
rolling tones of its 3355-pipe
Murray Harris organ
He has played at Sunday ser
vices and at weddings, for high
school baccalaureates and for
choir concerts. And he has of
fered his services to religious
groups in "hymn-sing" and
masses.
He has also instructed stu

dents in the art of organ
playing, and lectured on such
topics as "The Music of J. S.
Bach" and"The Music of
Mozart."
When lie became the Univer
sity organist in 1947, the campus
was filled with "older, more se
rious" students who had de
ferred their studies during the
hectic war years.
Nanney said, "All the pro
fessors wore coats and ties, and
women had to wear skirts and
stockings on the Quad. We didn't

call each other by our first
names — not even out students.
It was always miss or mister.
As a boy growing up in Whit
tier, Calif ~ 13 miles southeast of
Los Angeles, he said he "en
joyed listening to the organ at
church and in movie theaters "
Those were the days of the silent
movies, when the film was ac
companied by the auditorium
filling sound of the big pipes,
played by a real live artist.
"I liked the sound of it. It had
a lot of variety, a lot of power,"
Nannev said. "As a boy I used to
take piano lessons, but it was
always in the back of my mind
that I would switch to the organ
when I got big enough."
He started playing the piano
at five, and the organ when he
was 15. "I had to wait until I was
big enough to reach the pedals."
he explained
At 21, he had become assis
tant organist at Stanford, where
he was studying for his master's
degree in music.
Shortly after having com
pleted his studies at Stanford,
he was selected to be one of six
scholars then studying organ at
the school.
"It was a highly competitive
place," he said. "Every student
there was on a scholarship, and
had been picked by a committee
because they were the best in
their particular field of music
Students were expected to work
hard and learn lots of pieces, all
of which had to be memorized

If you didn't meet these stan
dards, they could terminate
your scholarship at any time."
The two criteria which stu
dents were expected to meet
were "excellence of per
formance and the ability to give
recitals," he said
Nanney's teacher, Alexander
McCurdy, was extremely strict.
"He had an old-fashioned style
of teaching," Nanney said. "He
told you what he wanted you to
do, and without very much dis
cussion, you did it. He expected
perfection in the notes. He was
very disciplined,"
While at Curtis, Nanney
worked part-time as the or
ganist at the Ninth Presbyterian
Church of Philadelphia. There
he met his wife, Jean, who had
come "from California to be
come religion educator at the
church," he said.
Before he had completed his
studies at Curtis, the war broke
out. Nanney joined the army
and travelled to England and
France with the Medical Ser
vice Corps. He was head
quartered in Paris, and there he
played the organ and directed
the choir at the American
Cathedral. He also spent three
months taking course on "or
gan. counterpoint, and harmo
ny" at the Paris Conservatory
under Marcel Dupre.
"I was sponsored by the
American Army Education Pro
gram. so everything was free,"
he said. Smiling he added: "Af
ter the war, all those young kids
were running around with noth
ing to do. The army had to think
of something to keep them out of
trouble."
When he returned to the Unit
ed States. Nanney went back to
Curtis to complete the work for
the Artist's Diploma. He re
ceived it in 1947.
That year, he returned to
Stanford and became Univer
sity organist, a position he has
retained ever since.
Nanney has seen many
changes in Stanford over his
three decades of teaching here.
For one thing, methods of tech
ing have changed.
"The old method was when
the teacher told the student
what to do, and the student did

it. But now, we're co-learners,
particularly with the graduate
students. Teachers have
learned to be more flexible."
Each decade has brought new
changes.
"The '50s were college prank
days," Nanney said. "In the
'60s. we had the big change. It
