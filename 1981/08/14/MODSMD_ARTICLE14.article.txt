# Sports officials: the best are unnoticed

"The most satisfying officiat
ing is when the fans don't notice
the officials," said Supervisor
of Pac-10 Officials Jack
Sprenger.
Over 65 Pac-10 officials at
tended the Annual Rules Re
view and Clinic held August 8
and 9 at Jordan Hall to work
toward that goal.
"The guys who do the best job
officiating, no one ever knows
they're there," said Sprenger
"We don't get much public
ity," said Pac-10 field judge Bill
Richardson of Novato. "But we
don't want publicity. The less

we get, the better job we do."
The 65 officials, Sprenger and
other observers met eight hours
Saturday and seven hours Sun
day in order to prepare for the
upcoming football season. The
Cards start September 12
against Purdue
Sprenger said, "The purpose
of the clinic is for the officials to
be advised of the new rules.
These included 14 changed sig
nals. two new rules and numer
ous rewordings and alterations
to old rules. They also took a na
tional 100-question test as a
measure of their proficiency

and study of the rules. All this is
to prepare them for the upcom
ing season."
The clinic began with a three
hour briefing, led by veteran
referee Dave Kamanski, on the
new rules as worded in each ref
eree's new rule handbook put
out each year by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA).
The clean-cut group of men,
attired in athletic shoes, shorts
and golf shirts, made notes in
their books, laughed at periodic
wise-cracks, and asked in
telligent "What if?" questions

on the new rules.
Kamanski led the briefing be
cause Sprenger was meeting
with the Pac-10 head coaches at
the Palo Alto Hyatt House that
morning.
Other events of the clinic in
cluded a showing of an NCAA
rules promotional film, a show
ing of a rule interpretative film,
the composition of a bulletin to
be sent to the Pac-10 head
coaches and group meetings for
each of the six positions. Each
official has one specialized area
of expertise: back judge, line

judge, field judge, umpire, head
linesman or referee.
Close to half of the Pac-10 of
ficials are educators and all fall
between the ages of 35 and 57.
They make $250 per game plus
travel and lodging expenses.
"Officials are usually people
who can afford to do extracur
ricular activities," says
Sprenger. "They do it more for
the association than for the
money. Most were players dur
ing their undergraduate days."
Sprenger said he thinks most
of the officials watch pro foot
ball although he personally feels
college football is a better,
more exciting game.
"They probably watch the of
ficials during the pro games as
much as they watch the players.
They do have their favorite
teams although when they're of
ficiating they are impartial."
He said that Pac-10 referees
can do any games except their
alma mater's traditional rival
(Stanford vs. U.C.-Berkelev or
USC vs. UCLA, etc.)
