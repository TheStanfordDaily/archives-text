## Mark Kramer Wage, price controls would fight inflation 
### 
>>rcond of two parts
The drawbacks to the Reagan
economic program I described
Tuesday should have beer, a ma
jor consideration in last
month's congressional debate
Unfortunately, they were not.
The Democrats allowed the ad
ministration to set the parame
ters of debate, and the so-called
"Democratic alternative" that
was offered was, in most re
spects. indistinguishable from
President Ronald Reagan's own
plan
It would have been wiser to
delay any tax cuts until after the
federal deficit has been
eliminated and inflation has
been brought under control But
the political climate has
changed so drastically over the
past seven months that few in
Congress even bother to ques
tion the basic tenets of the ad
ministrations's economic policy
any longer.
What is particularly disturb
ing about the feeble opposition
generated by the Democrats is
that the new budget and tax cut
policies will be difficult to re
verse, even if things begin to
turn sour. The automatic index
ing provision will assure that
revenues for balancing the
budget or for financing new so
cial programs cannot be ob
tained unless Congress wants to
go through the politically unat
tractive process of setting
higher taxes
There is an inflation psy
chology in this country which
has led workers to demand
higher wages and producers to
set higher prices — in both cases
to offset anticipated inflation.
The increased wages,
moreover, put upward pressure
on prices, and the rising prices
stimulate new wage increases
The only way to put an end to
this cycle is to enact an income
and prices policy As John Ken
neth Galbraith has pointed out
in the latest issue of The New
York Review of Hooks, an in
come and prices policy is an in
dispensable component of a suc
cessful anti-inflation strategy.
Not only could wage-price
controls dissipate the inflation
psychology that has taken hold,
but thev could also strike at the

core inflation rate, which has
remained at seven to eight per
cent And. while countering in
flation. the controls would not
aggravate the debilitating un
employment caused by mone
tary and fiscal restraint.
Critics of wage-price controls
argue that mandatory re
straints would be unsuccessful
and that all they would do is
create a large bureaucracy But
these claims have not been
borne out by past experience.
The fact is that wage-price
controls have worked, including
the most recent period under
President Richard Nixon The
Nixon program dramatically
curtailed inflation; it ended in
failure only because unwar
ranted exemptions were
granted for political reasons
and because no coherent plan
was formulated for the period of
adjustment after the freeze had

been lifted.
Furthermore, although a six
month freeze on wages, prices,
profits, dividends, and interest
would be the most potent way to
attack inflation, less drastic
steps would also be effective. If,
for example, wage and price in
creases could be held at a rate
consistent with the growth of
productivity, the inflationary
spiral could soon be halted.
Numerous economists and fi
nancial analysts, ranging from
liberals such as Barry Bosworth
to conservatives such as Henry
Kaufman, have cited the need
for some version of an income
policy. Although they disagree
on the specific form that such a
policy should take, they agree
that wage-price controls, com
bined with sound fiscal and
monetary policies, are the only
long-term solution to inflation.
Of course, realistically

speaking, there is almost no
chance that Reagan will ask for
the authority to impose wage
price controls no matter how
high inflation gets Any form of
an income policy would run
counter to his professed belief in
the free market.
President Jimmy Carter
adamantly refused to seek
wage-price controls, even when
inflation rose to 20 percent; it
would be utterly naive to expect
Reagan to act any differently.
And so, the economy will un
doubtedly continue to flounder,
as interest rates, inflation, and
unemployment all rise An ad
ministration aide, exulting af
ter the tax cut victory in Con
gress. declared that "we'vewon
the battle." Little did he realize
that the real battle is still ahead.

remained at seven to eight per
cent And. while countering in
flation. the controls would not
aggravate the debilitating un
employment caused by mone
tary and fiscal restraint.
Critics of wage-price controls
argue that mandatory re
straints would be unsuccessful
and that all they would do is
create a large bureaucracy But
these claims have not been
borne out by past experience.
The fact is that wage-price
controls have worked, including
the most recent period under
President Richard Nixon The
Nixon program dramatically
curtailed inflation; it ended in
failure only because unwar
ranted exemptions were
granted for political reasons
and because no coherent plan
was formulated for the period of
adjustment after the freeze had

been lifted.
Furthermore, although a six
month freeze on wages, prices,
profits, dividends, and interest
would be the most potent way to
attack inflation, less drastic
steps would also be effective. If,
for example, wage and price in
creases could be held at a rate
consistent with the growth of
productivity, the inflationary
spiral could soon be halted.
Numerous economists and fi
nancial analysts, ranging from
liberals such as Barry Bosworth
to conservatives such as Henry
Kaufman, have cited the need
for some version of an income
policy. Although they disagree
on the specific form that such a
policy should take, they agree
that wage-price controls, com
bined with sound fiscal and
monetary policies, are the only
long-term solution to inflation.
Of course, realistically

speaking, there is almost no
chance that Reagan will ask for
the authority to impose wage
price controls no matter how
high inflation gets Any form of
an income policy would run
counter to his professed belief in
the free market.
President Jimmy Carter
adamantly refused to seek
wage-price controls, even when
inflation rose to 20 percent; it
would be utterly naive to expect
Reagan to act any differently.
And so, the economy will un
doubtedly continue to flounder,
as interest rates, inflation, and
unemployment all rise An ad
ministration aide, exulting af
ter the tax cut victory in Con
gress. declared that "we'vewon
the battle." Little did he realize
that the real battle is still ahead.
