## Neutron bomb more macho posturing 
### 
It just kills people without
traumatically damaging build
ings.
This is how the neutron bomb
has been described to us on the
anniversary of the bombing of
Nagasaki. A blunderous sense of
timing our president has — just
enought to arrogantly demon
strate that the United States
means business
Our president is off for a
vacation now. A little wood
chopping and horseback riding
Even his favorite sports con
tribute to the picture that his ad
ministration has decided to pro
mote The action of the past
months make it easy to under
stand why President Ronald
Reagan likes his image of the
true-to-the-red-white-and-blue
American cowboy, and even
more how he can enjoy the vi
olent hacking of an ax.
Raiigan has demonstrated his
hard line attitude — his you'll
see-who's-boss-around here
tone — in domestic and foreign
policy. The worldwide jitters
caused by this naive machismo
were highlighted by partici
pants' view of the Ottawa con

ference as an opportunity to
teach our president about the
real world.
We're not going to talk to
Russia unless it's on OUR terms
alone. We're going to increase
defense spending and snap our
fighting men into shape. Reagan
behaves as if he's spoiling for
the confrontation rather than
attepting any meaningful dis
course on existing problems
The U.S.S.R calls the neu
tron war head policy "can
nibalistic." Perhaps that is
going a bit far but it isn't hard to
envision Reagan as a righteous
executioner. In fact it is easy to
imagine our fine leader sending
troops to correct some real or
fictitious affront to our honour
Our cowboy in the White
House is willing to let the ad
vances of past decades slide into
obscurity. Those uppity minor
ities are just fine without a re
newal of the voting rights act It
isn't necessary to have sex dis
crimination laws clutter the
books. Women don't need an
ERA with real men around.
What does his bravado come
to? The neutron bomb doesn't
damage valuable property. Air
line losses must be carefully
assessed. "Non-interference"
is the prevailing philosophy of
the free market and therefore
social welfare problems
What it comes down to is that
"the business of America is
business" and anyone who
thought the government was
"by the people and for the peo
pie" was mistaken
Our leader's interest in build
ings over human life agrees
with his apparent philosophy of
action over insight. We are
being shown this and told that
we had better like it: A man
date, he says. And if some don't
think it is a mandate they will
probably find themselves en
gaged in one of the power strug
gle situations that our Chief Ex
ecutive seems to thrive on.
Fortunately, paternalistic
power plays tend to lead to in
solent rebellion. Unfortunately
aggravated reactions lead to an
gry struggle characterized by
mutual attempts to punish and
revenge.
