## Malathion question is power, not poison 
### 
The Medical Grand Rounds
sponsored by the Department of
Medicine on Malathion was mis
guided The statement was
made that opponents of the
spraying were unwilling to par
ticipate, claiming it was beyond
their expertise (this probably
was a slap at the pharmacology
department whose opposition
had been published widely.)
Also implied was the notion
that there were no longer com
petent opponents of the
spraying, since the great aca
demic opponents like Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
had now demurred. How clever
ly surreptitious the intimida
tions of the academic ivory tow
er.
Kennedy and Bruce Ames
then quite professionally went
about reducing the entire Medf
ly-malathion debate to a ques
tion of scientific expertise,
more specifically to the relative
toxicity and risks of malathion.
Unfortunately, this was never
the issue. One wonders if Ken
nedy believes that sacharin was
the real issue in his famous de

bate as head of the FDA. Of
course it wasn't, the issue was
then as now political power.
The defense of malathion is
the defense of diazanon without
even mentioning the latter, for
every single scientist in Califor
nia must have heard by now that
malathion doesn't kill larvae.
The defense of malathion is the
defense of an open-ended
strategy of total erradication of
the Medfly — wherever that
may lead us. as if it were even
possible statistically. The de
fense of malathion is a "reduc
tio ad absurdum" argument
that claims chronic effects and
long term chronicity is equal to
carcinogenicity.
I note with pleasure that
Bruce Ames, whose integrity is
beyond dispute, failed to men
tion low birth weights and ring
tail disease in rats heavily dosed
with malathion, failed to men
tion Pancreatic islet cell hyper
trophy in chicks causing hyper -
insulinemia, failed to mention
the broad issue of sensitization
which is the most common form
of human reactivity to synthetic

chemicals, failed to mention
that with sensitization we are
dealing with a permanent and
cumulative long term public
health burden, failed to mention
the issue of individual vari
ability which causes us to be re
latively concerned only about
newborns and other" select
groups at low doses of any
chemical.
But the main omission was
not the above, but rather that
such erudite and astute persons
as participated in this light
hearted affirmation of the
Medfly project could avoid so
easily the issue of most import:
what is the relative danger of
the Medfly itself, and what is
the most appropriate way to
deal with a relative danger of x
magnitude 9
If, as many of us believe, the
Medfly was erradicated last
winter, until the Medfly direc
tor released 20 million fertile
flies, what is to prevent us from
a repeat program?
Why has the federal govern
ment refused to licenae the
process of gamma irradiation of

fruits and vegetables from af
fected areas which can
eliminate any risk of trans
mission?
Why are we going to study ter
atogenicity in Santa Clara
County when the San Joaquin
valley has the highest pesticide
burden anywhere in America
and clearly should be included
in any study?
Why are we arguing about the
relative safety of malathion
when we know there will be mu
tants and resistant survivors no
matter how strong the toxins
used? Why aren't we discussing
who is threatened by the Medfly
and how our lives are controlled
by a government that will never
institute a decent public health
system?
Perhaps it is because Ameri
can universities are made up of
people who have no shame. You
can even ignore the Hoover In
stitution.
