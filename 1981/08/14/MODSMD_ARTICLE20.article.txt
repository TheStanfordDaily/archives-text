## Training new controllers not a strike solution 
### 
In light of the recent air traf
fic controller controversy, the
media and public opinion have
been decidedly one sided. Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's decision
to refuse negotiations for the
simplistic and impractical rea
son that the air traffic con
trollers are breaking the law is a
dangerous precedent for Ameri
can labor in general. I am dis
tressed by the treatment of the
issue and feel that a few more
questions should be addressed
and a few more facts brought to
light.
Is the so-called smooth opera
tion following the strike here to
stay? The supervisors and non
strikers working 10-hour shifts
will soon tire; stress and fatigue
can severly impair their ability
to do the job. The military con
trollers and rookies fresh out of
training are unfamiliar with the
airways they are now patrol
ling. Controllers are being
pulled out of low-traffic
"marginal" towers and placed
where there is greater demand,
but are we compromising the
safety of these smaller towers?
Do federal employees have
the right to strike? The public is
annoyed because it has been in
convenienced. Yes, the con
trollers signed an oath but under
the assumption that there would
be reasonable negotiation and
communication on both sides.
Air traffic control is a monopoly
and as a monopoly, cannot com
pete with a nonexistent private
sector.
This lack of competition pre
vents other "companies" from
keeping wages, benefits and
working conditions at a reason
able level. The government, in
refusing to negotiate, has given
air traffic controllers no weap
on to safeguard their interests
but to strike. The justice depart
ment would like to take that
away, too. Is this democracy?
We support the workers in Po
land in their struggles but point
fingers in our own backyard.
Somehow, we resent those
who make more money than we
do. especially federal employ
ees. There exists no comparable
job of an air traffic controller
with which to compare salaries
and so we have no standards.
Yet, what are the responsi
bilities of an air traffic con
troller? To a certain extent,
they are similar to that of a pi

lot's. Both are responsible for
the safe conduct of air traffic
and the safety of the flying pub
lic. Yet, a pilot is responsible for
the safety of one planeload of
passengers, an air traffic con
troller for the safety of hun
dreds. How much does a veteran
commercial pilot make?
The $33,000 salary of air traf
fic controllers so widely pub
lished is ambiguous. Is it the av
erage salary of all air traffic
controllers? Journeymen?
Those on strike? Does it include
the salaries of supervisors and
chiefs of towers who are on pa
per controllers but in essence
management? Is it the mean or
median? The starting salary of
an air traffic controller is at the
GS-5 level. That's one step
above a summer clerk-typist
with two years of college. Strik
ing air controllers claim their
average salary is $28,500. Who is
right?
Air traffic control is a
stressful job. The average
length of an air traffic control
career is only three years. The
rate of mental health problems
surpasses the national average.
A person cannot even apply to be
an air traffic controller in a tow
er or center if he or she is 29
years of age or older. A high per
centage of air traffic controllers
never finish training.
A major demand of the con
trollers often overlooked is that
of shorter working hours. Amer
ican air traffic controllers are
the only controllers in the de
veloped Western world still
working 40 hours a week. Short
ened hours benefit everybody,
especially the flying public.
Shorter hours mean better con
centration and safer flights for
all.
The federal government
claims that there are 9000 ap
pliations on file and 11,000 calls
inquiring into an air traffic ca
reer. Yet simply hiring them
and putting them to work is im
possible. Possibly one out of ev
ery 100 persons expressing in
terest make it to training school
and a large percentage in school
never make it to the towers. In
order to hire an air traffic con
troller for training, the FAA re
quires the following. 1) The tak
ing of the civil service air traffic
controller aptitude test 2) A for
mal list from the Civil Service
Commission of the names of the

highest scorers (generally those
scoring 90 and higher) 3) Sub
mission of a very complete ap
plication as well as much other
complicated paperwork 4) FBI
security clearance (includes
questioning former acquain
tances, knowing every house you
have ever lived in, whether you
came from a broken family,
were an alcoholic, who you mar
ried, divorced, etc.) 5) Medical
examination by an FAA physi
cian 6) Mental health examina
tion 7) Interview at a tower or
center 8) Recommendation let
ters 9) Application review 10) If
offered a position, acceptance
11) Two week orientation 12)
Wait for a class opening
A security clearance alone

takes four to six months. The en
tire process of hiring an air traf
fic controller trainee, from the
day he/she takes the aptitude
test to the day he/she reports to
school in Oklahoma City neces
sitates many months to one
year.
At the present, there are 11
regions with one or two officers
per region taking care of all the
employment for the entire coun
try (for example, two em
ployment officers are in charge
of the hiring process for the ap
plicants for jobs in California,
Arizona and Nevada. The Rea
gan administration would like to
consolidate the regions into five
from 11. That would mean two
officers for states or 2000 appli

cants. There simply isn't the
time, or the manpower, to hire
all these people.
Once they are hired, there are
three more years of training at
Oklahoma City and in low densi
ty towers or stations before an
air traffic controller is a full
journeyman with all the duties
and responsibilities of the air
traffic controllers now on
strike. Meanwhile, daring these
four years or so, our towers,
flight service stations and con
trol centers will be manned by
worn out supervisors/non
strikers and the military.

regions with one or two officers
per region taking care of all the
employment for the entire coun
try (for example, two em
ployment officers are in charge
of the hiring process for the ap
plicants for jobs in California,
Arizona and Nevada. The Rea
gan administration would like to
consolidate the regions into five
from 11. That would mean two
officers for states or 2000 appli

cants. There simply isn't the
time, or the manpower, to hire
all these people.
Once they are hired, there are
three more years of training at
Oklahoma City and in low densi
ty towers or stations before an
air traffic controller is a full
journeyman with all the duties
and responsibilities of the air
traffic controllers now on
strike. Meanwhile, daring these
four years or so, our towers,
flight service stations and con
trol centers will be manned by
worn out supervisors/non
strikers and the military.

of FAA Employment-Air Traf
fic Control Section.)

In light of the recent air traf
fic controller controversy, the
media and public opinion have
been decidedly one sided. Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's decision
to refuse negotiations for the
simplistic and impractical rea
son that the air traffic con
trollers are breaking the law is a
dangerous precedent for Ameri
can labor in general. I am dis
tressed by the treatment of the
issue and feel that a few more
questions should be addressed
and a few more facts brought to
light.
Is the so-called smooth opera
tion following the strike here to
stay? The supervisors and non
strikers working 10-hour shifts
will soon tire; stress and fatigue
can severly impair their ability
to do the job. The military con
trollers and rookies fresh out of
training are unfamiliar with the
airways they are now patrol
ling. Controllers are being
pulled out of low-traffic
"marginal" towers and placed
where there is greater demand,
but are we compromising the
safety of these smaller towers?
Do federal employees have
the right to strike? The public is
annoyed because it has been in
convenienced. Yes, the con
trollers signed an oath but under
the assumption that there would
be reasonable negotiation and
communication on both sides.
Air traffic control is a monopoly
and as a monopoly, cannot com
pete with a nonexistent private
sector.
This lack of competition pre
vents other "companies" from
keeping wages, benefits and
working conditions at a reason
able level. The government, in
refusing to negotiate, has given
air traffic controllers no weap
on to safeguard their interests
but to strike. The justice depart
ment would like to take that
away, too. Is this democracy?
We support the workers in Po
land in their struggles but point
fingers in our own backyard.
Somehow, we resent those
who make more money than we
do. especially federal employ
ees. There exists no comparable
job of an air traffic controller
with which to compare salaries
and so we have no standards.
Yet, what are the responsi
bilities of an air traffic con
troller? To a certain extent,
they are similar to that of a pi

lot's. Both are responsible for
the safe conduct of air traffic
and the safety of the flying pub
lic. Yet, a pilot is responsible for
the safety of one planeload of
passengers, an air traffic con
troller for the safety of hun
dreds. How much does a veteran
commercial pilot make?
The $33,000 salary of air traf
fic controllers so widely pub
lished is ambiguous. Is it the av
erage salary of all air traffic
controllers? Journeymen?
Those on strike? Does it include
the salaries of supervisors and
chiefs of towers who are on pa
per controllers but in essence
management? Is it the mean or
median? The starting salary of
an air traffic controller is at the
GS-5 level. That's one step
above a summer clerk-typist
with two years of college. Strik
ing air controllers claim their
average salary is $28,500. Who is
right?
Air traffic control is a
stressful job. The average
length of an air traffic control
career is only three years. The
rate of mental health problems
surpasses the national average.
A person cannot even apply to be
an air traffic controller in a tow
er or center if he or she is 29
years of age or older. A high per
centage of air traffic controllers
never finish training.
A major demand of the con
trollers often overlooked is that
of shorter working hours. Amer
ican air traffic controllers are
the only controllers in the de
veloped Western world still
working 40 hours a week. Short
ened hours benefit everybody,
especially the flying public.
Shorter hours mean better con
centration and safer flights for
all.
The federal government
claims that there are 9000 ap
pliations on file and 11,000 calls
inquiring into an air traffic ca
reer. Yet simply hiring them
and putting them to work is im
possible. Possibly one out of ev
ery 100 persons expressing in
terest make it to training school
and a large percentage in school
never make it to the towers. In
order to hire an air traffic con
troller for training, the FAA re
quires the following. 1) The tak
ing of the civil service air traffic
controller aptitude test 2) A for
mal list from the Civil Service
Commission of the names of the

highest scorers (generally those
scoring 90 and higher) 3) Sub
mission of a very complete ap
plication as well as much other
complicated paperwork 4) FBI
security clearance (includes
questioning former acquain
tances, knowing every house you
have ever lived in, whether you
came from a broken family,
were an alcoholic, who you mar
ried, divorced, etc.) 5) Medical
examination by an FAA physi
cian 6) Mental health examina
tion 7) Interview at a tower or
center 8) Recommendation let
ters 9) Application review 10) If
offered a position, acceptance
11) Two week orientation 12)
Wait for a class opening
A security clearance alone

takes four to six months. The en
tire process of hiring an air traf
fic controller trainee, from the
day he/she takes the aptitude
test to the day he/she reports to
school in Oklahoma City neces
sitates many months to one
year.
At the present, there are 11
regions with one or two officers

employment for the entire coun
