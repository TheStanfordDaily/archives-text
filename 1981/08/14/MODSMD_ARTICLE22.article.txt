Totalitarian
I appreciate Stephen Babb's
taking the trouble to comment
on my article about author
itarian and totalitarian states,
(Daily, Aug. 9). However, let
me try to clear up some misun
derstandings.
Babb shares the common
opinion that totalitarian states,
in compensation for political re
pression, take better care of
their citizens and are more
egalitarian than authoritarian
states. In some cases this is cor
rect. but it is not valid general
ization. For example, author
itarian Taiwan is more
egalitarian than most "social
ist" states.
Stalinist Russia and "demo
cratic" Kampuchea were hard
ly welfare-minded in slaughter
ing millions. Nowadays, the So
viet elite have unique privi
leges, including their own
speedlane on main avenues.
Castro's Cuba is often credited
with social achievements — in
health and education — but a
recent study shows that other
countries of the region have
done as well without depriving
their peoples of freedom.
The other mistake into which
many Americans fall is to gross
ly overestimate the control of
this country over non-com
munist governments. It is high
ly flattering to us to assume that
a few American businessmen,
officials, or spooks behind the
scenes can manipulate such
countries as Argentina or Bra
zil. It is also insulting to the Ar
gentines and Brazilians, how
ever, and is entirely unrealistic.
It would be difficult to point to
a single action taken by these

countries in recent years to
please the United States, and
they have done many things con
trary to the desires of Washing
ton. For example, they happily
used the grain embargo to in
crease sales to the Soviet Union.
The Argentine regime is rather
cozy with the Soviets, and it is
supported by the Communist
party.
The Brazilian government
has in the past decade brought
about a considerable reduction
of the U.S. share in its invest
ment and trade. Incidentally,
authoritarian Brazil is not far
from socialistic, as over 60 per
cent of investment is controlled
by the state.
I agree with Babb that U.S. in
fluence should be exerted in fa
vor of human decency so far as
and wherever possible. This
does not deny the fact that there
are important differences be
tween the revolutionary (or
pseudo-revolutionary) dic
tatorships and the non-revolu
tionary (or more traditional)
ones and that they represent dif
ferent problems for U.S. foreign
policy.

KMT
This letter responds to the let
ter entitled "KMT hoax" (Dai
ly, July 24).
Dr. Chen Wen-chen, an assis
tant professor of statistics at
Carnegie-Mellon University,
was found dead on July 3, 1961
after interrogation for 13 hours
by KMT Garrison Command.
His battered body — 13 broken
ribs, a fractured pelvis, rup
tured internal organs — lay on
the lawn of the graduate library

of National Taiwan University.
Rita Yeh, a former Univer
sity of Minnesota student, was
sentenced to 14 years in prison
in Taiwan after she went back
home.
Both victims were charged by
the KMT regime with being in
volved in anti-KMT activities in
the United States. How can the
KMT know of the activities in
the United States? The fact that
the KMT has spies hidden in the
United States university cam
puses to watch the Formosan
students is obvious.
The students from Taiwan
should appreciate the advertise
ment sponsored by the For
mosan Association for Human
Rights to present the facts to
both the American and the Chi
nese communities. Actually,
these facts have been discussed
in several American magazines
and newspapers. The Formosan
students should be aware of the
KMT spies, so they won't fall
into the trap set by the spies.
The Formosan students in this
country should have the free
dom to pursue what they want to
learn and the freedom to speak
out what they want to say.
The students from Taiwan
should unite to point out the
KMT spies, so they won't be the
next Yeh or the next Chen
