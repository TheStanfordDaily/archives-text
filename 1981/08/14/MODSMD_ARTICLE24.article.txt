# Championship chess play

Over 600 competitors, partici
pants in the University's largest
conference of the summer,
hunched over the 320 chess
match boards which clutter the
Grand Ballroom of Rickey's
Hyatt on El Camino.
Rickey's is hosting the annual
U.S. Open Chess Championships
this year, a competition which
has brought players from ages
16 on up— including two year
victor and local champion Jim
Christiensen — into a week long
combat of concentration in
nighttime matches which are

7 a.m. to midnight.
The U.S. Open Championship
which is held in a different city
each year, is different from oth
er Chess Chamionships in that it
is "a kind of people's forum
competition," said long-time
player Jim Marfia. The five-day
competition is open to anyone
willing to pay the $45 entrance
fee ($55 at the door) and assures
each competitor 12 games.
These fees are used to finance
prizes, as the top 10 placers re
ceive rewards. First place is
$4000 and tenth picks up $500
"The competition is not exactly

in the same league as other
matches, or golf tourneys," said
Marfia.
But the Open Championship,
which ends its sojourn in the
Bay Area Saturday morning, is
not different from other chess
matches in its style: It is, as
always, a game of pure concen
tration. "The game's complete
ly psychological," said Marfia.
"You can't use physical
force, so you use your mind.
Few understand how this works,
probably chess players even
less. They just use what works,"
explained Marfia.
