# Conferences bring 15,000 to campus
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
You've probably noticed the
steady flow of name tagged vis
itors pouring in and out of Stan
ford's buildings this summer.
But you may not know that this
stream actually represents 136
different conferences being held
here, meetings which will have
brought almost 15,000 people to
the campus by the end of Sep
tember.
Last weekend the number of
conferences on campus hit its
peak, with Stanford hosting
almost 2600 people from 31 con
ferences.
Of these, 15 are part of the on
going programs such as Upward
Bound, which educates students
that could not normally afford
to go to college, or the presti
gious Stanford Executive Pro
gram, housed in Lagunita,
which trains high-level corpo
rate managers. These run for
four to 12 weeks.
Other conferences residing
here are the one- to two-week
specials, such as the Alumni As
sociation's Summer Alumni
Program, which ended last Sat
urday after a ten-dav Western
Culture curriculum, or this
week's Bay Area Global Educa
tion Workshop and American
Electronics Association Con
ference.
The meetings vary in size
from 25 to several hundred and
bring people from as far away

as Taiwan and Arabia.
Altogether, these travelers
give the University a 53 percent
summer housing occupancy
rate, an exceptionally high fig
ure. "This is very good occupan
cy for summers in a University.
In fact, we'll gross about two
and a quarter million dollars
this summer," said Lois
Fariello, the manager of Stan
ford conferences for 20 years.
"These profits help the stu
dents because they all go right
back in to Res Ed to help pay for
room and board. Next year's
rates are even set with this prof
it budgeted in, so Stanford real
ly counts on these programs to
help keep student costs lower."
Fariello added that summer
conferences also assist Unversi
ty employees during summer
months and local merchants
who reap the benefits of visitor
generated business.
The 53 percent occupancy
rate also represents astounding
growth for Stanford's summer
events. At its beginning
in 1947, Stanford housed a
meager 317 people in one resi
dence; and just 10 years ago
Stanford sponsored only 49 con
ferences with a total of 3100 peo
ple. But in 1980 Stanford hosted
125 programs, and the number
continues to grow.
How have so many con
ferences come to be? Many
have accumulated with time.

This year 40 percent of them
are returning, some for their
20th year (such as the Stanford
Executive Program).
All groups have been initiated
by "in-house" organizations on
campus that are sponsored by
Stanford faculty members. All
arrangements must be made
well in advance: "We already
have some conferences sched
uled for 1986," said Fariello.
The luxuries of Stanford, plus
its ideal location — 20
minutes from the airport, an
hour from "scenic S.F.-by-the-

Bay" — have greatly helped to
make it become a popular con
ference choice. Conferees have
access to Stanford's libraries,
are treated to gourmet meals
provided by special kitchen
staffs, and can purchase per
mits to all other Stanford facil
ities, including pool and golf
course. Conferees live in cam
pus dorms, where house resi
dents and students can answer
questions, open doors when keys
ar forgotten, and even provide
bar services. Guests are some
times treated to Faculty Club

entertainment.
Of course, conference ar
rangements are not always
flawless:"l remember we had
one wife call from France very
upset," recounts Fariello. "She
wanted to know who this Flor
ence Moore woman was that her
husband would be living with."
Stanford's posh provisions
also do not change the fact that
Stanford's conferences remain
primarily academic in nature.
Organized and taught through
faculty departments, these can
