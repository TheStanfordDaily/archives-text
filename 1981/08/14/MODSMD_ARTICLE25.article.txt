# Conferences bring 15,000 to campus
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
You've probably noticed the
steady flow of name tagged vis
itors pouring in and out of Stan
ford's buildings this summer.
But you may not know that this
stream actually represents 136
different conferences being held
here, meetings which will have
brought almost 15,000 people to
the campus by the end of Sep
tember.
Last weekend the number of
conferences on campus hit its
peak, with Stanford hosting
almost 2600 people from 31 con
ferences.
Of these, 15 are part of the on
going programs such as Upward
Bound, which educates students
that could not normally afford
to go to college, or the presti
gious Stanford Executive Pro
gram, housed in Lagunita,
which trains high-level corpo
rate managers. These run for
four to 12 weeks.
Other conferences residing
here are the one- to two-week
specials, such as the Alumni As
sociation's Summer Alumni
Program, which ended last Sat
urday after a ten-dav Western
Culture curriculum, or this
week's Bay Area Global Educa
tion Workshop and American
Electronics Association Con
ference.
The meetings vary in size
from 25 to several hundred and
bring people from as far away

as Taiwan and Arabia.
Altogether, these travelers
give the University a 53 percent
summer housing occupancy
rate, an exceptionally high fig
ure. "This is very good occupan
cy for summers in a University.
In fact, we'll gross about two
and a quarter million dollars
this summer," said Lois
Fariello, the manager of Stan
ford conferences for 20 years.
"These profits help the stu
dents because they all go right
back in to Res Ed to help pay for
room and board. Next year's
rates are even set with this prof
it budgeted in, so Stanford real
ly counts on these programs to
help keep student costs lower."
Fariello added that summer
conferences also assist Unversi
ty employees during summer
months and local merchants
who reap the benefits of visitor
generated business.
The 53 percent occupancy
rate also represents astounding
growth for Stanford's summer
events. At its beginning
in 1947, Stanford housed a
meager 317 people in one resi
dence; and just 10 years ago
Stanford sponsored only 49 con
ferences with a total of 3100 peo
ple. But in 1980 Stanford hosted
125 programs, and the number
continues to grow.
How have so many con
ferences come to be? Many
have accumulated with time.

This year 40 percent of them
are returning, some for their
20th year (such as the Stanford
Executive Program).
All groups have been initiated
by "in-house" organizations on
campus that are sponsored by
Stanford faculty members. All
arrangements must be made
well in advance: "We already
have some conferences sched
uled for 1986," said Fariello.
The luxuries of Stanford, plus
its ideal location — 20
minutes from the airport, an
hour from "scenic S.F.-by-the-

Bay" — have greatly helped to
make it become a popular con
ference choice. Conferees have
access to Stanford's libraries,
are treated to gourmet meals
provided by special kitchen
staffs, and can purchase per
mits to all other Stanford facil
ities, including pool and golf
course. Conferees live in cam
pus dorms, where house resi
dents and students can answer
questions, open doors when keys
ar forgotten, and even provide
bar services. Guests are some
times treated to Faculty Club

entertainment.
Of course, conference ar
rangements are not always
flawless:"l remember we had
one wife call from France very
upset," recounts Fariello. "She
wanted to know who this Flor
ence Moore woman was that her
husband would be living with."
Stanford's posh provisions
also do not change the fact that
Stanford's conferences remain
primarily academic in nature.
Organized and taught through
faculty departments, these can
even involve — yes, even for
top-notch executives— getting
employment applications ac
cepted. The American Elec
tronics Association (AEA) con
ference, for example, receives
almost 200 applicants despite its
80 person limit. "We're way
over subscribed so we have to
select by application. We try to
make sure that everyone attend
ing is experienced enough that
they can contribute to the learn
ing as well as gain something,"
explained Thomas Massey,
Stanford coordinator for the
program.
For $2500 (the company
treats) the chosen managers,
who come from large corpo
rations such as Hewlett-Pack
ard and Memorex as well many
smaller electronics companies,
attend two weeks of intensive
management training classes.
'They work reasonably hard for
the classes. It surprises a few of
them. I think," said Doug King,
seminar manager for AEA."lt's
not as much of a vacation as
they think it's going to be "
With lectures all morning and
seminars or workshops in the
evening, the representatives
are kept busy. "It's like a re
fresher course and an MBA pro
gram in one," said Rex Tucker,
marketing director of San Diego
Topax Inc.
"The professors are also ex
cellent," added Bob Ferrera,
general manager of Data Prod
ucts based in Connecticut.
Tucker explained that they
were kept busy, but there was

still time for recreation
"Where do we study? The golf
course, the "vollyball
courts . . .This is the most
beautiful campus I've ever en
countered," said Tucker.
The Bay Area Global Educa
tion Program, which involves 40
representatives from Northern
California schools, is also here
this week, meeting for its sec
ond time
"It's an intensive leadership
program to let teachers in
crease international, cross-cul
tural affairs in public schools,"
said coordinator Ronald Her
ring.''lt's a very successful pro
gram. judging from last year's
results and the teachers' en
thusiasm " The Global teachers
will be staying in Stern until the
conference finishes up on Au
gust 21.
Mirrielees is housing some
members of the area's biggest
conference this summer, the
U.S. Open Chess Cham
pionships. Though Stanford has
only 35 competitors on campus,
over 500 players have entered
this competition. Matches are
played from 7 p.m. to 12 mid
night each night at Rickey's
Hyatt House.
These conferees, part of a
lengthy train of summer con
ferences, keep director Fariello
busy year round. "I'm starting
work now on '82 and '83's con
ferences," she said. "With so
many conferences and such in
teresting people, this is a full
time job. But it never gets dull."

course. Conferees live in cam
pus dorms, where house resi
dents and students can answer
questions, open doors when keys
ar forgotten, and even provide
bar services. Guests are some
times treated to Faculty Club

entertainment.
Of course, conference ar
rangements are not always
flawless:"l remember we had
one wife call from France very
upset," recounts Fariello. "She
wanted to know who this Flor
ence Moore woman was that her
husband would be living with."
Stanford's posh provisions
also do not change the fact that
Stanford's conferences remain
primarily academic in nature.
Organized and taught through
faculty departments, these can
even involve — yes, even for
top-notch executives— getting
employment applications ac
cepted. The American Elec
tronics Association (AEA) con
ference, for example, receives
almost 200 applicants despite its
80 person limit. "We're way
over subscribed so we have to
select by application. We try to
make sure that everyone attend
ing is experienced enough that
they can contribute to the learn
ing as well as gain something,"
explained Thomas Massey,
Stanford coordinator for the
program.
For $2500 (the company

the classes. It surprises a few of
them. I think," said Doug King,

With lectures all morning and
seminars or workshops in the
evening, the representatives
are kept busy. "It's like a re
fresher course and an MBA pro
gram in one," said Rex Tucker,
marketing director of San Diego
Topax Inc.
"The professors are also ex
cellent," added Bob Ferrera,
general manager of Data Prod
ucts based in Connecticut.
Tucker explained that they
were kept busy, but there was

still time for recreation
"Where do we study? The golf
course, the "vollyball
courts . . .This is the most
beautiful campus I've ever en
countered," said Tucker.
The Bay Area Global Educa
tion Program, which involves 40
representatives from Northern
California schools, is also here
this week, meeting for its sec
ond time
"It's an intensive leadership
program to let teachers in
crease international, cross-cul
tural affairs in public schools,"
said coordinator Ronald Her
ring.''lt's a very successful pro

results and the teachers' en

Mirrielees is housing some
members of the area's biggest
conference this summer, the
U.S. Open Chess Cham
pionships. Though Stanford has
only 35 competitors on campus,
over 500 players have entered
this competition. Matches are
played from 7 p.m. to 12 mid
night each night at Rickey's
Hyatt House.
These conferees, part of a
lengthy train of summer con
ferences, keep director Fariello
busy year round. "I'm starting
work now on '82 and '83's con
ferences," she said. "With so
many conferences and such in
teresting people, this is a full
time job. But it never gets dull."
You've probably noticed the
steady flow of name tagged vis
itors pouring in and out of Stan
ford's buildings this summer.
But you may not know that this
stream actually represents 136
different conferences being held
here, meetings which will have
brought almost 15,000 people to
the campus by the end of Sep
tember.
Last weekend the number of
conferences on campus hit its
peak, with Stanford hosting
almost 2600 people from 31 con
ferences.
Of these, 15 are part of the on
going programs such as Upward
Bound, which educates students
that could not normally afford
to go to college, or the presti
gious Stanford Executive Pro
gram, housed in Lagunita,
which trains high-level corpo
rate managers. These run for
four to 12 weeks.
Other conferences residing
here are the one- to two-week
specials, such as the Alumni As
sociation's Summer Alumni
Program, which ended last Sat
urday after a ten-dav Western
Culture curriculum, or this
week's Bay Area Global Educa
tion Workshop and American
Electronics Association Con
ference.
The meetings vary in size
from 25 to several hundred and
bring people from as far away

as Taiwan and Arabia.
Altogether, these travelers
give the University a 53 percent
summer housing occupancy
rate, an exceptionally high fig
ure. "This is very good occupan
cy for summers in a University.
In fact, we'll gross about two
and a quarter million dollars
this summer," said Lois
Fariello, the manager of Stan
ford conferences for 20 years.
"These profits help the stu
dents because they all go right
back in to Res Ed to help pay for
room and board. Next year's
rates are even set with this prof
it budgeted in, so Stanford real
ly counts on these programs to
help keep student costs lower."
Fariello added that summer
conferences also assist Unversi
ty employees during summer
months and local merchants
who reap the benefits of visitor
generated business.
The 53 percent occupancy
rate also represents astounding
growth for Stanford's summer
events. At its beginning
in 1947, Stanford housed a
meager 317 people in one resi
dence; and just 10 years ago
Stanford sponsored only 49 con
ferences with a total of 3100 peo
ple. But in 1980 Stanford hosted
125 programs, and the number
continues to grow.
How have so many con
ferences come to be? Many
have accumulated with time.

This year 40 percent of them
are returning, some for their
20th year (such as the Stanford
Executive Program).
All groups have been initiated
by "in-house" organizations on
campus that are sponsored by
Stanford faculty members. All
arrangements must be made
well in advance: "We already
have some conferences sched
uled for 1986," said Fariello.
The luxuries of Stanford, plus
its ideal location — 20
minutes from the airport, an
hour from "scenic S.F.-by-the-

Bay" — have greatly helped to
make it become a popular con
ference choice. Conferees have
access to Stanford's libraries,
are treated to gourmet meals
provided by special kitchen
staffs, and can purchase per
mits to all other Stanford facil
ities, including pool and golf
course. Conferees live in cam
