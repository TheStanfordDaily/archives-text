# New system to thwart thieves
## Libraries tighten security 
### Pat Carroll 
University officials hope a
soon-to-be-installed electronic
monitoring system similar to
the ones in use at airports and
department stores can help curb
the number of thefts of library
materials in Meyer Library.
According to Building
Projects Manager Phil
Leighton. an estimated five to
ten percent of the more than
150.000 volumes at Meyer are
lost each year to theft.
The system makes use of an
electronic radio field emmitted
from special tags attached to li
brary materials which, when
passed through a turnstile, will
signal to portal monitors.
Monitors then check to see if the
materials have been signed out.
but are freed from the current
practice of having to check the

bags of everyone leaving the li
brary.
Installation of the system
should be completed next week,
according to Leighton. who esti
mated the cost at more than
$10,000 This does not include
the price of tagging the more
than 150.000 volumes which
currently line the shelves of
Mever, however According to
Leighton. the cost of that will
run about 10 cents per volume.
Other users
Leighton said it is hoped that
the system will reduce the in
cidence of theft and permit con
tinued use of the facilty by per
sons outside the University
"We're trying to keep this li
brary as public as we can."
Leighton said. "A great many
people from the outside come to
use our materials — students

from Foothill and Palo Alto
High School, for example — and
our vulnerability is a source of
frustration.
"I'm sure that there will still
be some people who will figure
out a way to take advantage of
this system. " he said. "There
always are. but this system is
one means of improving access
to materials for everyone else."
Leighton said the system will
also cut down on "unintentional
forgetfulness." an infrequent,
though costly custom of absent
minded users who may walk out
of the library without realizing
that a book has not been signed
out.
Leighton said that because
this system has had a reputation
for a high number of false
alarms, University officials
waited before installing it at
Meyer until the technology was
suffiently improved to the point
of greater reliability.
"Most other libraries already
have this, or a similar system,
in use," he said. "But Stanford
has been slow in establishing
it's use here because it has had a
lot of false alarms."
Wider implementation
He said that the University is
planning to implement this kind
of system in other libraries, in
cluding Green, but no date has
been set as yet. The monitoring
system is currently in use at
Lane Medical Library, the
Graduate School of Business Li
brary and the Engineering
School Library. "Most of the
major research libraries here —
music and chemistry, for exam
ple — eventually will have this
system." Leighton said
"I think it's a great system."
student Nina Bohlen said
"Finals time is maddening with
so many people just forgetting
to check out books. . . and the
checkers don't always look very
carefully."
"But I would feel bummed if I
ever forgot to check out a book
and set the thing off It could be
embarrassing
