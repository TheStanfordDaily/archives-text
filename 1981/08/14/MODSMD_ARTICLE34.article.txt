# New area townhouses use solar energy

### Jon Kaplan 
At the grand opening of the
Los Arboles Townhouses last
Saturday, the Marek Building
Company of Los Altos was
awarded the Pacific Gas and
Electric (P.G. & E.)
Company's Suntherm award.
The honor, consisting of a
Suntherm home certificate and
a cash prize of $1980. is the
first major award for practical
water and space heating by so
lar energy in the Santa Clara
Valley.
To qualify for the Suntherm
award, a home must provide at
least 50 percent of home energy
needs. The solar-powered Los
Arboles Townhouses. according
to a recent P.G. & E. study,
will provide 73 to 89 percent of

space and hot water heating.
Don Marek, president of the
firm, adapted 13 of the 24 units
to provide passive and active so
lar heating a year ago.
In the system, designed by
Trident Energy Systems of
Davis, California, water is
pumped through collector pan
elling located on the roofs of the
townhouses and on the roofs of
the garages. Water is then
stored in a pair of insulated
tanks for each solar townhouse.
One tank supplies the domestic
hot water and the other supplies
the space heating.
To heat the house, hot water
is circulated through continuous
poly-butelene tubing embedded
in the concrete floor slabs. This
heats the slabs which heats the

house.
In summer the house can be
cooled by circulating the water
through collector panels at
night which cools the water. The
water is then stored and used
throughout the day, while the
panelling is used to heat water
for domestic use.
The townhouses are insulated
exactly the same as non-solar
houses are, with the exception
of a poly-butelene stripping
along the floor slab outside of
the house. "As opposed to
double glass paneling in the win
dows which we found to be very
cost-ineffective, the poly
butelene panelling we found to
be very cost effective," said
Merek.
Each unit is completely com

puterized. House and water
temperatures are constantly
monitored, allowing for a cons
tant room temperature. If the
panels cannot produce enough
hot water, because of poor solar
conditions or enormous
domestic hot water uses, a
back-up gas-powered heater
will automatically kick in and
provide what is needed.
"Our main problems were
primarily problems of coordi
nation," said Marek. "This is
the first solar project I've done,
but it should become easier in
the future. A great help was the
addition of Trident's prefabri
cated plumbing system. Some
thing like this would have cost
substantially more if we were to
have had a plumber assemble

it."
Such projects are profitable
because of the tax credits the
government gives the buyer.
With present inflation, the pay
back time is only about one
month, with savings of hundreds
of dollars annually even without
federal tax deductions.
Linda Weissberg, the Univer
sity energy program manager,
said "Household solar use is
only practical because the gov
ernment is indirectly subsidiz
ing the builder by giving the
buyer a tax break Since Stan
ford is a non-profit organiza
tion. we could not get this tax
break in student housing, mak
ing it completely un
economical."
Although solar energy is not
practical for student housing it
is practical for faculty housing.
The new Peter Coutts project,
faculty condominiums current
ly under construction, were de
signed for some solar heating â€”
the first major solar heating
here.
Weissberg said, "Everything
is different in the way student
housing is designed and built.
We would have to use a com
pletely different type of com
mercial grade material. Water
is also used in different ways in
student housing."
