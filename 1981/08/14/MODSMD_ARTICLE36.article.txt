I New Varsity, Palo Alto
s The movie that's represented
" romance for two generations of
I moviegoers It sports a seductive

Superman II ★★★
* Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
« This sequel may disappoint
* those who admired the myth-es
-1 tablishing prologue of the original;
bit will usually delight those who
* found the original's smart-alecky
s second half more appealing. Rich-
ard Lester (A Hard Day's Night,
The Three Musketeers) directed,
and he's lent the movie a comic
-2 book punch that moves it along as
» speedily as a morning spent with
the funnies. Christopher Reeve re
i peats his role as the man of steel;
Margot Kidder is, once again, a
1 sassy, sexy Lois Lane

5 Play it Again, Sam ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
« Herbert Ross directed Woody
* Allen and Diane Keaton in this
* movie version of the Woody Allen
I play. It all seems a little in
cestuous, and the movie is ap
parently suffering from inbreed
ing — it's slow and sickly just
when you would've thought it'd be
strongest. But Allen and Keaton
are wonderful together. The
scenes with just the two of them,
2 where you can tell they're actually
\ having a good time, redeem the
a movie
J Plays Monday and Tuesday
; with Casablanca.

The Empire Strikes Hack **
* Old Mill, Mountain View
■ The special effects are even
» more spectacular than before, but
\ this sequel to Star Wars has lost
s most of its sense of humor. Ev
! erything has become deadly seri
" ous—bigger, brighter, splashier,
' and dull.
* All the old performers are back,
but the best performance is given
* by a green-skinned muppet
' creature that, for an instant, man
! ages to instill a sense of magic and
I expectation. The biggest letdown
i of all is the movie's ending—
* jeepers, George, couldn't you
\ come up with something better
! than that after three years of
* work 0

\ Raiders is a tribute to the ad

* represents the combined efforts of

' wrote the script. It has been ac
, claimed by the overwhelming ma
« jority of critics as a cliff-hanger
' classic. But I must confess to a
■ traitorous resistance to all those
J good vibrations: I didn't care for
, the movie very much. Raiders
* achieves a weird balance: it's ex

■ center. For all the hype about its

i made in an acquisitive spirit; it's a

Clone Encounters of the Third
Kind ★★★★
Laurel, San Carlos
Steven Spielberg recut his 1977
science-fantasy, removing cum
bersome sections and adding new
footage. There's more to the mov
ie's ending, now, but the two most
striking additions are one scene
and a single shot In the new scene.
Dreyfuss explains how he grew up
with Disney's f'inocchio and we
begin to get a sense of the film's
narrative roots The new shot,
very brief and telling, shows the
great shadow of a spacecraft wed
ding the fantastic and the com
monplace as it glides over Indiana
farmlands A terrific movie.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Disnev's The Fox and the
Hound.

Harold and Maude★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and the inherent goodness of
humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined
to fall in love Bud Cort plays
Harold; Ruth Gordon is Maude.
Hal Ashby (Being There, Coming
Home) directed The script, by
Colin Higgins (9 to 5) was initially
done as a UCLA master's project
Late show this weekend

Breaking Away
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A movie this good natured is
sure to cause cancer if seen too
often or praised too highly. But, in
limited doses, Breaking Away can
be invigorating — once in a while
it's nice to be persuaded that ev
erything can turn out all right in
the end.
Dennis Christopher plays a high
school student who attempts to bi
cycle his way out of the lower
middle class. His is a curiously
aimless (and therefore strikingly
American) quest Escape, and
nothing more, is his goal While
we're watching this movie, at
least, that may be all the goal that
anyone needs.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with The Great Santini

The Maltese Falcon ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto

Plays though Wednesday with

Endless Love
Bijou. Palo Alto
Melodrama reigns supreme in
this torrid tale of teenaged intem
perance. Brooke Shields endlessly
loves Martin Hewitt, who burns
down her house, spends two years
in an institution, breaks parole,
causes her father's death, and
loves her endlessly, too
Franco Zeferelli directed this
uncredited remake of Splendor in
the Grass, in which Natalie Wood,
teenagedly intemperant, allows
Warren Beatty to go all the way
with her (honest!) and goes crazy
because of it. In Zeferelli's ver
sion, going all the way means
alwavs having to say you're sorrv

Worse than Xanadu.
Worse than Destroy All

Worse than Gidget Goes Hawai

The combination of Bo Derek in
front of the camera and John De
rek. the Rasputin of the '80s, be

a masochist could love.

For Your Eyes Only
Palo Alto Square
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal It's
not as bloated as the last Bond ex
travaganza (Moonraker) and it's
perhaps the least sadistic of any
Bond movie -- which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to be
growing tired of the role (or per
haps he's merely stopped trying:
the producers plan to replace him
with a younger model soon). He
perks up momentarily — as does
the movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the rest
of the film, For Your Eyes Only
might have passed for entertain
ment instead of an exercise in
cinematic stasis

Fame ★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
There are about three good
minutes in this one, and those
three—most of them involving
singing, dancing, and suchlike
are choice. But to get those few
nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours of I was a
Teenaged Chorus Line. All the fa
miliar faces are here: an ignorant
but-talented ghetto kid, a girl who
brings along a Jewish mcther out
of a '40s comic strip, and a lonely
but-talented homosexual son of a
famous actress. All work to prove
that it takes an incredible amount
of talent to keep those soapsuds
coming Alan Parker, who made
the world safe for stereotypes with
1978's Midniuht Express,
directed.
Starts next Wednesday with
Hair.
