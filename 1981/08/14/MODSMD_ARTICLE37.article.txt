Three 1981 graduates are marketing a different

creativity.

Events Unlimited, late spring quarter. Operating
under the motto of "extraordinary events for ex

presentation of "the ultimate date," said Breier.
When the lucky guy or gal goes into the city, he or
she is met with gifts, after dinner mints and
champagne.
