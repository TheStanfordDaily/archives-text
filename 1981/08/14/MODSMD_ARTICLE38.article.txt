# Captain's Cabin: A big fish in a small ocean
## 
### Stuart Leaf 
Perhaps my expectations are too high.
Perhaps I've been spoiled by the ex
cellent fruits de mer in France, by east
coast shellfish, and Dublin Bay prawns;
but being located a mere fog's roll away
from the Pacific ocean. I would still have
expected Palo Alto to have a plethora of
superior seafood restaurants. Up until
this point I have been very disappointed
not to find a seafood restaurant which of
fers consistently good fare, and which I
would take pleasure in frequenting.
To me. both the Fish Market and
Scott's, the area's two most popular wa
tering holes for the seafood conoscienti,
are very overrated and uneven in their
culinary performance On the other
hand, the Captain's Cabin, although not
the metaphoric cat's whiskers, seems
underrated.
It is not a fancy restaurant, nor is the
meal spectacular, but for the most part,

the fish is very fresh and professionally
prepared. Furthermore, there is rarely
the unpleasant wait that its trans-el-
Camino competitor is famous for; also,
once seated the atmosphere is far more
sedate, and in my humble opinion more
comfortable. Seating is divided between
a porch and an airy interior, both of
which seem suitably sea-faring.
Our meal was not enough to warrant
poetic flourish, but was very good, and
above all, enticing enough to draw me
back for another try.
We started with two of their seafood
cocktails, bay shrimp and freshly cooked
prawn The bay shrimp were sweet and
plentiful, and the prawns fresh, large and
well textured.
Our soups were perhaps the apex of the
meal. The Boston clam chowder was
denser than any I'd ever previously ex
perienced. and was creamy, flavorful,
and otherwise chock full of goodies. The

shrimp bisque was equally creamy, and
consisted of a lobster base, generously
complemented with small bay shrimp.
We each ordered only a cup, but even
that could almost be a meal in itself. I
wish luck to those who venture for a full
plate. . .
As always we tried to select at least
one of the chef's specials. His daily catch
included fresh salmon stuffed with
shrimp and crabmeat, a combination
which I couldn't resist. It was unpreten
tious but tasty; the flavors blended well
and the sauce was very light.
The other entree was also quite satis
fying Billed as the chef's favorite, the
Fish stew bordelaise, scallops, shrimp,
fish, crab, baby clams steamed together
in a light broth, was not disappointing.
The portion was gargantuan (big), and
the quality of the contents excellent. One
small complaint, though, was as I was
gorging my third bowl of stew, the flavor

of the broth seemed to have faded. Being
a cook myself, I know how hard it is to
keep taste buds scintillated for pro
tracted periods of time, but nonetheless,
this stew would have benefitted from a
slightly more liberal dose of seasonings.
Desserts were unexciting and un
worthy of expository prose.
Overall, however, I left the restaurant
with a positive impression. The service
was friendly and casual, the wine list ap
propriate and inexpensive, and the food
well above average. Prices were as to be
expected for seafood, ranging from $7.50
for Red Snapper to $16.95 for filet
Mignon and Australian lobster tail. So
if you too are tired of waiting for ever to
be seated at the "in" restaurants, relax
and enjoy some good fresh fish at the
Captain's Cabin.
