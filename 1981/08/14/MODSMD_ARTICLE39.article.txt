# Californiana not Gloriana rules the Renaissance Faire
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
"Hear ve, hear ye. her
majesty the queen arrives.'
exclaims a middle-aged man
wearing wire rimmed
glasses and a leather hat
with a bright red feather
sticking out of it. Her majes
ty does indeed arrive a few
minutes later and is present
ed with two men — "we have
brought before you two most
learned scholars" explains
the herald to which the queen
feigns surprise. Both schol
ars kneel, one who mutters a
few lines of praise in Latin
the other in Greek as the
whole court watches in utter
astonishment — to hear
Latin or Greek in Marin
County! Who seems to reign
here is Californiana more
than Gloriana.
Elizabeth I would proba
bly roll over in her grave if
she could hear some of the
language spoken at the Ren
aissance Pleasure Faire,
which is located among the
oaks of the Black Point For
est in Novato — about a half
hour drive north of San Fran
cisco along Highway 101 She
would hear a misplaced
"fie" here and a "verily"
there as well as sentence
construction reminiscent of

a school boy German — the
verb almost invariably
comes at the end. Nobody
seems quite comfortable
with Queen's English not
even the queen herself — this
is her second year with the
faire What saves the day is
the fact that everyone in
volved is deadly serious
about the make believe
The costumes can be
divided into three catego
ries There are the more or
less accurate copies of peri
od costumes made by the
faire's costume shop: these
are worn by the courtiers —
and must be boiling hot in the
semi-desert environment of
the "shire." There are the
cheap imitations of the
renaissance originals in
lavish polyester and felt and
a wide assortment of cos
tumes ranging that stretch
the renaissance anywhere
from the middle ages to the
19th century — one man I
saw was dressed in a Viking
outfit complete with helmet
and shield.
So, if you expect to see
genuine renaissance, you are
in the wrong place — the
faire is no BBC studio. The
arts and crafts offer a wide
assortment of California

tackiness mixed in with
some of the genuinely beau
tiful — there are the fluores
cent wax castles you can
make yourself, the stained
glass, the silver and clumsy
looking pottery together with
some beautiful Afghan
dresses — all equally over
priced. One interesting fea
ture: "the shire" seems to
have more fortune tellers,
tarot readers and
astrologers per capita than
anywhere else on this planet.
Other services include
holistic health and foot
massage.

There is a good deal of en
tertainment, most of it good.
There are musicians,
singers, dancers — I spotted
some Stanford folkdancers in
the crowd — even a Jewish
professorial looking mag
ician dressed in a purple
flowing robe who alternates
his Elizabethan English with
a Brooklyn accent.
There are some skits — we
saw a shortened version of
Hamlet that turned out to be
an uninteresting farce.
An interesting addition to

the traditional faire enter
tainment is "Drench a
Wench, Soak a Bloke." You
have a chance — for a dollar
— to kiss a wench or a bloke
of your choice if you manage
to hit them with a wet sponge
launched from a catapult.
The kisses are long lasting
and deep — though I had the
strong feeling that the men
get short changed.
The faire, which has been
going on for 15 years both
here and in the Los Angeles
area, is open weekends until
September 13.
