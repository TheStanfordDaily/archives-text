# Tug-of-war with Transition
## Coffee House may get beer patio 
### Benjamin LIoyd 
Coffee House goers may soon
enjoy their beer and wine in an
enclosed patio designed both to
handle current overflow prob
lems in the small restaurant and
to compete with an expected
move by the Transition to offer
a beer and wine facility.
The student-run and student
owned ASSU Coffee House, has
applied with the board of Tres
idder Union for funds to con
struct the enclosed patio, in re
sponse to the announced inten
tions of the Servomation com
pany. which runs the Transition,
to begin selling beer and wine
this fall.
Under the terms of the Coffee
House's liquor license, beer and
wine may not be taken outside.
"If there is no place to sit. cus
tomers wishing to buy beer or
wine will just go to the Transi
tion." said Roger Hardy, busi
ness manager of the Stanford
Alumni Association and mem
ber of the Coffee House board of
directors. "The Coffee House
board is sensitive to the prob

lem of success," he explained,
"and is anxious to compete."
Steve Weiss, manager of the
Coffee House, agreed that the
patio would help them to com
pete. but said the main argu
ment for the patio, however, is
not competition. "Basically, it
would just be a nice situation,"
he said.
Weiss is skeptical about the
future of the project. Tresidder
has so far not allocated any
funds for the construction,
which, he said, would cost be
tween $32,000 and $40,000 Tres
idder paid more than $200,000
for the Transition remodelling
Dave Jordan. Servomation's
food director for the Transition,
said that the company hadn't
used their beer license before
because they had insufficient
means of controlling sales un
der the regulations of the
license. Construction of an al
ternate point of service is under
way that will allow customers to
order and pay for their drinks at
the same place, making main
tenance of regulations far eas

ier. he said.
The addition should be opera
tive by the beginning of Autumn
Quarter, though still in the fin
ishing stages. "There are no bad
feelings between the Coffee
House and us," Jordan claimed.
The Coffee House patio would
be a walled space of 1200 square
feet by what is now the front
door to the Coffee House. One
design already submitted in
cludes a stone wall four to five
feet high topped with flower
boxes surrounding a tiled area
with lighted tables and chairs,
seating 50.
According to Hardy, it will
open up other possibilities
besides the immediate advan
tages of increased seating ca
pacity. "Down the road is an al
ternate service point that would
allow us to serve other kinds of
food."
Weiss envisions an intimate
setting that would lend itself to
small musical performances
similar to the character of the
existing facility. "We are a ser
vice organization, he said,
"and we don 't try to turn over an
immense profit. We offer a situ
ation that is unique on campus,
and I would like to feel that we
are a part of the Stanford com
munity."
Servomation is a iarge corpo
ration with many contracted
tood services including a new fa
cility in Berkeley. They have
the funds to develop new ideas
on their own and to finance any
loss they may incur in any false
move. In the past year, as the
Coffee House has introduced in
novations into their menu, the
Transition has been quick to fol
low suit following each change
with a -imilar addition to their
own menu
Weiss claimed the competi
tion that this produces is often
innocuous as some of the
change'- have proved to be fail
ures. Their sale of beer and wine
will result in additional prob
ems. he warned, stemming
from the difficulty of policing
such a large area with so many
exits A portion of Coffee House
regulars will inevitably be
drawn by the bright lights and
vide open spaces, but Weiss
hopes that his organization will
continue to attract, new cus
tomers

subject to approval bv the Tres

of their contractual agreements
with the establishments. While
ostensibly reducing competi
tion. Weiss said, this arrange
ment can somewhat limit in
novation and improvement.
The Coffee House, which has
been owned and run by students
for a year reports a 50 percent
increase in business in the past
year, and while running into a
deficit this year expects a
higher profit margin soon "We
tried some things, and some oth
er things, and now we know bet
ter what will work and what
won't," Weiss said.

The Coffee House, which has
been owned and run by students
for a year reports a 50 percent
increase in business in the past
year, and while running into a
deficit this year expects a
higher profit margin soon "We
tried some things, and some oth

won't," Weiss said.
Coffee House goers may soon
enjoy their beer and wine in an
enclosed patio designed both to
handle current overflow prob
lems in the small restaurant and
to compete with an expected
move by the Transition to offer
a beer and wine facility.
The student-run and student
owned ASSU Coffee House, has
applied with the board of Tres
idder Union for funds to con
struct the enclosed patio, in re
sponse to the announced inten
tions of the Servomation com
pany. which runs the Transition,
to begin selling beer and wine
this fall.
Under the terms of the Coffee
House's liquor license, beer and
wine may not be taken outside.
"If there is no place to sit. cus
tomers wishing to buy beer or
wine will just go to the Transi
tion." said Roger Hardy, busi
ness manager of the Stanford
Alumni Association and mem
ber of the Coffee House board of
directors. "The Coffee House
board is sensitive to the prob

lem of success," he explained,
"and is anxious to compete."
Steve Weiss, manager of the
Coffee House, agreed that the
patio would help them to com
pete. but said the main argu
ment for the patio, however, is
not competition. "Basically, it
would just be a nice situation,"
he said.
Weiss is skeptical about the
future of the project. Tresidder
has so far not allocated any
funds for the construction,
which, he said, would cost be
tween $32,000 and $40,000 Tres
idder paid more than $200,000
for the Transition remodelling
Dave Jordan. Servomation's
food director for the Transition,
said that the company hadn't
used their beer license before
because they had insufficient
means of controlling sales un
der the regulations of the
license. Construction of an al
ternate point of service is under
way that will allow customers to
order and pay for their drinks at
the same place, making main
tenance of regulations far eas

ier. he said.
The addition should be opera
tive by the beginning of Autumn
Quarter, though still in the fin
ishing stages. "There are no bad
feelings between the Coffee
House and us," Jordan claimed.
The Coffee House patio would
be a walled space of 1200 square
feet by what is now the front
door to the Coffee House. One
design already submitted in
cludes a stone wall four to five
feet high topped with flower
boxes surrounding a tiled area
with lighted tables and chairs,
seating 50.
According to Hardy, it will
open up other possibilities
besides the immediate advan
tages of increased seating ca
pacity. "Down the road is an al
ternate service point that would
allow us to serve other kinds of
food."
