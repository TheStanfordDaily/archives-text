# Guitar wars in the heat of pre-adolescent lust

### Gabe Newell 
Since Columbia Pictures and
Elektra/Asylum Records have
decided to bury every news
paper on the planet hip deep in
Heavy Metal publicity releases,
this humble reporter received
not only two free tickets to go
see the movie, but also the
soundtrack, two posters, three
stills and one letter My editor
thought that it would be nice if I
would do a review of both the
album and the movie, thereby
saving the Daily both the burden
of further press releases and the
extra $1.37 they would have paid
me for two articles.
Even though I have always
thought that heavy metal had as
much going for it as a style of
music as lizard mutilation has
as a form of religious ex
pression, I agreed (It was
either agree or do John Denver
and Dolly Parton reviews for
the rest of my life.) So off I went
to the theater, to stand in line
with the: l) leather-wearing,
chain-toting, Coors-swigging
motorcycle gang. 2) the horde of
pimply-faced, adolescent males
getting heavily into the stand
ing-around and looking-dull-and
wimpy action, and 3) the one or
two over-25 grownups with se
vere hormonal imbalances that
cause them to limp and drool
and make sage statements

about today's youth
Oh, goody, this is going to be
even more fun than I thought.
And then the movie started —
An hour and a half of sex, vio
lence, heroes, bad guys, and
women with breasts the size of
watermelons.
Believe it or not. I liked
Heavy Metal In fact, I liked it
enough to have gone back and
seen it a second time. It is
creative, humorous, fast-paced,
flashy, etc. But it is not an in
tellectually challenging film,
nor is it a movie that will appeal

to an extremely broad segment
of the population. In other
words, I have mixed feelings
The animation and the
artwork are easy to talk about.
They were very good The eight
episodes of Heavy Metal were
based on stories and art by five
different cartoonists from the
magazine of the same name.
Michael Gross, the production
designer for the film, managed
to give Heavy Metal an overall
artistic continuity while still
preserving the stylistic charac
teristics of the original stories.
Comparisons and references
to the early Disney films run
rampant through all the re
leases Columbia has sent us,
and the analogy continues in the
case of Heavy Metal. Anyone
who was turned off of the entire
idea of fantasy animation by the
various pieces of garbage that
Ralph Bakshi has been turning
out will be glad to see the care
with which Heavy Metal has
been made
The stories themselves aren't
so easy to analyze. They range
from hack-slash sword and
sorcery ("Den" and "Taarna")
to creepv-crawly horror
("B-17"), to pseudo-sci-fi cul
tural satire ("Harry Canyon").
In "Den" and "Harry Canyon"
the characterizations of the
principal heroes are quite good,

the plots are tight and interest
ing. and there is a feeling of re
ality or of a "reality" that is on
the same order as that of a non
animated film At the other ex
treme. "Taarna," the last, long
est, and weakest of the episodes,
degenerates into a mindless
cartoon of exquisitely drawn
women, battles, and scenic vis
tas. All of the episodes suffer
from the relatively flat depic
tions of extraneous characters'
personas, relying more on fan
tastic art work to pull the movie
along.
And now to the music ....
Somebody must have come up
with a pile of money to pay for
all these bands: Black Sabbath,
Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick,
Devo, Donald Fagen (of Steely
Dan), Don Felder (of the
Eagles), Grand Funk Railroad,

Sammy Hagar, Journey, Naz
areth, Stevie Nicks, Riggs, and
Trust. Whether they got their
money's worth is debatable.
Journey plays one track on
the album (one too many), and
it pretty much cinches up their
drive to win the Debbie Boone
crown of rock 'n'roll "Open
Arms" is sooooo bad that it
doesn't even deserve to be on
the same album with Cheap
Trick Basically this particular

track has nothing going for it at
all. and I doubt that it will get
much air play on even the most
Clearasil oriented AM radio sta
tions.
Grand Funk Railroad —
"Queen Bee." Black Sabbath —
"The Mob Rules." Riggs —
"Heartbeat," Sammy Hagar —
"Heavy Metal": utterly for
gettable and typical examples
of your basic heavy metal
stomp-stomp-stomp, screaming
guitar, silly lyrics song See Van
Halen's first album for the same
thing, only a lot better
Riggs' "Radar Rider" is the
opening track of the album and
the movie and it isn't half bad.
It at least got my feet tapping,
even if it was merely another
rendition of boy meets guitar
and proceeds to see how loudly
he can play it. Riggs is a new
band that hails from Atlanta,
and for those of you who like this
sort of music, their debut album
should be coming out soon on the
Full Moon/Warner Brothers
label.
Devo's "Through Being Cool"
and "Working in the Coal Mine"
— I still haven't quite figured
out why Devo is lurking around
on a heavy metal soundtrack.
"Through Being Cool" is heard
in the movie, but does not ap
pear on the soundtrack, and
"Working in the Coal Mine" is
used as filler during the final
credits, yet shows up on the

soundtrack anyhow Confusing.
Since I have always been a
closet Devo fan it was sad to see
the Spudboys continuing down
the road to formulization and
pop cliches Both songs are
catchy, will probably be mildly
popular, and are on the same
level as popcorn for their over
all texture and substance.
Donald Fagen's "True Com
panion" — if I was confused to
find Devo on this album, I was
annoyed to find Donald Fagen.
Sounding like a rehash of everv

Steely Dan song ever done,
"True Companion" had myself
and my roommates climbing
the walls of our trailer in no
time at all. After hearing the

album for the third time, we
began skipping over "True
Companion" even if it meant
getting up from a furious game
of checkers and changing the
record
Donald Felder's "Heavy
Metal (Taking a Ride)" and

"All of You," along with Cheap
Trick's "Reach Out" and"I
Must Be Dreaming" were the
best by far, of all the songs on
the album These songs are good
ole rock and roll with enough va
riety and originality to make
them worth listening to, even if
the rest of the album could be
classed under "Retreads."
Felder does get old fairly fast,

but the Cheap Trick tracks are
good for a long, long time.
The bottom line on all this is
that if you think you might like
the movie, you probably will. Ii

you know you won't like the
movie, you most definitely will
not. And if you aren't sure, go
ahead and see it Heavy Metal is
at least unusual and creative
enough that it will be a movie
that you won't regret spending
the money to see
