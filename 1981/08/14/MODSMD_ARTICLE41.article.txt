# A 						funny 'Miss Firecracker' suffers from too much plot

### Denny Dart Jiri Weiss 
A huge American flag which
serves as a curtain for the Dra
ma Department's production of
Beth Henley's two act comedy
The Miss Firecracker Contest is
lifted revealing a pair of shapely
legs from the hips down.
We see the legs tap dancing —
or rather attempting to tap
dance — on the stage to the tune
of "The Star Spangled Banner"
— some members of the au
dience let out nervous laughs
while others gaze in won

derment.
The legs occasionally bump
into a couch or a table or the red
head who belongs to them drops
her baton and stoops down to
pick it up. This is how we are in
troduced to Camelle, the cen
tral character of Miss Fire
cracker, who is eager to win the
first prize of a Fourth of July
beauty pageant. Carnelle is des
perately trying to escape her
"checkered" past which has
earned her the nickname of "hot
tamale"— her real name should
already be suggestive of some
thing. Carnelle sees the contest
as a wav of leaving both her rep-

utation and the stifling Southern
town where she has grown up
"in a crimson blaze of glory."
The irony is that the title she
is so much after does not seem
to evoke much more respect in
the town than "hot tamale" —
especially since the recent ra
cial integration laws have re
quired the organizers to include
token blacks and Chicanos.
Carnelle is perhaps the best
worked out character of the play
and Andrea Bahman makes an
excellent Carnelle. Bahman's
onlv drawback is her attractive

ness,which makes it difficult for
her to play the plain and vulgar
hussy Whenever Carnelle does
something clumsy or in bad
taste — such as dying her hair
red — Bahman still comes off as
charming.
Plays about the Fourth of
July may seem like Americana
but Henley's play is about no or
dinary small town — though it is
set in Brookhaven, Mississippi,
not far from Henley's home
town — and no ordinary fourth
of July. The play has the scan
dalous appeal of a soap opera or
a gossip magazine as we learn
more and more about Carnelle's
complicated past.
It is fortunate that Henley did

not write yet another play about
the superficiality of beauty pag
eants, but unfortunately the re
lationships are so complicated
that the action is very hard to
follow.
The play lacks focus because
it tries to be too many things at
once. Every character in the
play — except perhaps for the
innocent seamstress Popeye —
has more than their fair share of
"checkered past."
Carnelle grew up with her
cousins Delmount and Elain.
hardly your average American
family. Elain has just left her

husband and children out of
boredom and Delmount has just
served time in a mental institu
tion for sticking a broken bottle
in someone's face during a bar
room duel. Delmount, you see,
is just obsessed with beautiful
women — he even dreams about
them at night. . mostly in dis
membered parts.
Delmount is a difficult role to
play because the character has
an almost split personality: he
has to be both the violent guy
who fights with broken bottles
and tender when he deals with
his sister or Popeye. So it is not
surprising that Matthew State is
awkward at times. He is not
helped any by his preppy ap
pearance. There is not much of
small-town South to Delmount
when he smokes his pipe, ex
pounding his wisdom.
Delmount is supposed to be
unbalanced and yet he has no
problem making peace with his
sister who had refused to sign
papers for his early release
from the asylum. On top of it,
the playwright gave him all the
simultaneously awkward and
"profound" statements.
"Perfect is boring," Delmount
says at one point.

Henley does better with the
character of Elain. Underneath
Elain's sometimes casual,
sometimes frivolous veneer is
the desparation of a woman who
lacks an identity of her own. She
exists only through her husband
and her reputation as a beauty.
She sips Japanese wine casually
but her tension surfaces with
each additional glass. She can't
be as carefree as she seems
when she says that her children
can raise themselves and only a
desperate woman would have a
fling with a drunkard, Mac Sam,
who is not only dirty but has
caught venereal disease from
none other than Carnelle.
There is a problem with this
character too. The emotional
climaxes do not come off —
when Elain shouts "You al
ways bring out the worst in
me. . You always have!" as
she storms up the stairs after a
particularly emotional dialogue
with Delmount, her anger
seems contrived — otherwise

Nicole Goedhart's performance
is excellent.
Perhaps the most fatal flaw
of the play is the fact that it ends
with the most improbable ro
mance between Delmount and
Popeye. What motivation could
Delmount possibly have? Dumb
can be charming but Popeye is a
little too dumb, just a little too
immature for the connoisseur of
"classical beauty." It is never
clear where the
Popeye Delmount romance fits
in.
Elizabeth Richards seemed
sometimes more like a five
year-old than the 23-year-old
that the script called for. Did
she really have to skip on the
stage with cotton candv in her
hand?
Like a finale at a symphony
concert that threatens to end
and then goes on for a refrain,
the play had a hard time ending.
It concluded much too sweetly
as Delmount and Popeye sat on
a roof gazing at fireworks — a
modified version of You Are a
Good Man Charlie Brown end
ing.
It is a pity that Debra Skriba,
a doctoral student in drama
here and a longtime college
friend of Henley, who directed
the play did not take the play
into her hands. She could have
evened it out, — even toned it
down in some places — to make
more sense.

The supporting cast is excep
tionally good, especially John
Rathman as the cynical balloon
vendor and Christine Roum as
Tessy. The sets are well- con
structed though the stage seems
a little cramped during the sec
ond act, and both the lighting
and sound effects surpass the
other summer productions. The
idea of replaying interviews
with contestants for the Miss
California Contest is simply
brilliant.
The Miss Firecracker Contest
plays tonight and tomorrow
night at the Little Theatre. The
play is enjoyable, in spite of its
many faults.
