# Its a bird! A plane! A guerrilla mime troupe!

### Mark Weiss 
On Friday, August 7, year of
Our Lord 1981, the First Con
gregational Church of Palo Alto
was the site of a thought-inspir
ing and entertaining modern
day drama.
The cast of characters — four
hundred concerned, human
istic, free souls: less than 26 of
which were actually performing
for the San Francisco Mime
Troupe in their production of
"Factwino Meets the 'Moral
Majority.' "
The others? Regular people
like you and me. Those with a
strong sense for defending the
rights of all persons, man or
woman, rich or poor
Was it interesting? Between
chuckles one thought about so
cial issues,.human rights and
what all these other friendly
looking people seated in the
courtyard of the church will do
to help protect the good of hu
man nature
What was it all about 0
Good question.
At first glance "Factwino" is
nothing more than a moving
comic strip about a middle-aged
black wino/bum dressed in a
yellow superhero's tights
straining with the heavy task of
making people think about com
plex social issues, problems ex
aggarated by holier-than-thou
saviors like the "Moral Majori
ty." The set. a portable wooden

stage with a cardboard back
ground. is high schoolish, the
humor is vaudevillean and the
title of the play is enough to
scare most theatre fans away.
So why were the four hundred
witnesses to the event, includ
ing patrons, players and spon
sors. absolutely saturated with
satisfaction?
"We're a political theatre
group." explains Estaban
OroDexa. Mime Troupe actor
and publicist "We're not as
concerned with the mechanics
of our production as we are with
the social message we are
trying to put across to the pub
lic. We attack social issues that
are affecting this country by us
ing theater as a weapon to fight
injustice and inequality."
The Mime Troupe, a non-prof
it group founded in 1959. has per
formed this second Factperson
adventure 'the original pre
miered last summer and pitted
a woman super-heroine against
the evils of economist Milton
Friedmani in parks and
churches since July 5 and will
continue with their crusade un
til September 20. The coalition
of sponsors for the Palo Alto
event would have been enough
to give any fundamentalist a
cold sweat: Intoto, Women's In
ternational League for Peace
and Freedom, Campaign for Ec
onomic Democracy, Coalition
for Abortion Rights Equality

(CARE) and Children by Choice
Coalition.
Intoto. a Stanford-based book
ing agency specializing in in
ternationally balanced cultural
events, put together the coali
tion and acquired the use of the
church yard
The artillery used to combat
the Moral Majority was crude
but effective A Moral Majority
survey taker was stated to be
from the Reliable Bible In
stitute of Throwback Virginia
A two-headed monster named
Armageddon-man, who
possessed the power to blow up
the world when it was finished
playing mischievous games and
was either the embodiment of
governmental right or the root
of all evil — is that redundant —
was a close associate of Moral
Majority leader Jerry Falwell.
The very mention of Moral Ma
jority or Falwell would produce
a hiss from the crowd
The audience, some sitting
cross-legged on grass an arm's
reach from the stage, was com
prised mostly of t-shirt and blue
jeans class liberal types in their
twenties and thirties. It was def
initely not the University of
Southern California's five year
reunion.
"When I see something like
this it makes me happy because
Palo Alto seems to be forgetting
these types of values." said
Katherine McClearlv, a Palo

Alto woman, "Collected here
are people concerned with so
cial values rather than money.
It's a nice environment (and) it
makes me feel like I'm not a
stranger on the planet."
"I was struck by their level of
consciousness and the wav thev

pulled the audience into the
whole show." stated Fatma II
ker. a young lady from Turkey.
"Especially in this country
where there is so much more
pure entertainment than shows
with redeeming social
messages."
