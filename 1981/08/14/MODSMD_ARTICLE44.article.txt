# 'F.O.B.' examines assimilation of Chinese-Americans
## 
### Tahirih Lee 
The best off-Broadway Amer
ican play of 1980, written by a
Stanford graduate, is now
playing at San Francisco's
Asian American Theatre Com
pany. David Hwang, 24, wrote
the Obie-Award-winning play
before he graduated in 1979.
F. 0.8. was first produced in
March of that year by the Stan
ford Asian American Theatre
Project which Hwang helped to
found.
Tucked away near the corner
of California and Sixth Avenues
is the unpretentious home of the
Asian American Theatre Com
pany. The small, intimate house
sold out to a crowd perhaps 75
percent Asian, and 100 percent
curious about the words behind
the initials FOB.(not as in
watch, certainly).
We learned in the play's open
ing blackboard lecture given by
a spotlighted Chinese in tortoise
shell glasses and British tweed
attire,that FOB. stands for
"Fresh off the boat". He enu
merated with bloated academic
ceremony the characteristics of
a Chinese person newly arrived
from China: "clumsy.ugly,
greasy,. . .four-eyes,big feet,
horny. . like Lenny in Of Mice
and Men." The hilarious but
grossly loud exaggeration
hinted at what was to come: a
glimpse at the pathetic man un
derneath the glossy stereotypes
of Chinese emmigrants as

similating into American cul
ture.
Hwang sharpens the distinc
tion between the reality and the
fantasy of this situation, of this
land for Chinese people, by
dividing the action into two sep
arate stories — one realistic,
one symbolic.
These two plots develop si
multaneously until a surprise
ending twists them together, re
vealing a poetic image that is
their common link.
The realistic story involves
three young Chinese, Dale,
Grace, and Steve. Grace is
wrapping a gift in the back room
of her family's Chinese restau
rant in Torrance, California
when Steve — the "F O B." —
struts in F.0.8.-ishly and
F.0.8.-ishly asks her out on a
date Brandishing a deep voice,
rigid stances and arm postures,
Steve professes to be Guang
Gong, the famous warrior.
Dale, Grace's ultra-American
ized cousin, comes to her rescue
— the prologue s preppie pro
fessor.
The three end up eating din
ner together in the same back
room where the scattered
Heineken bottles vie with the
imposing Chinese warrior paint
ing on the wall. In the same
vein, Dale (Heineken) and Steve
(warrior) give vent to their dif
ferences in a hotsauce-eating
contest When hot words cannot
be exchanged, what does one

do 0
When the three begin an after
dinner storytelling game —
fertile ground for mingling re
ality with fantasy — Dale has
difficulty participating in the
flowery, yet strict passion of
Chinese storytelling. He re
cedes into the narration, letting
the other two warriors
dance/battle the play to its
climax.
Storybook monologues mys
teriously cut into the main
stream of the present action
with the help of red and yellow
lighting, fluid words and mo
tions. Images are spun of two
warrriors, a man and a woman,
with their grievances carved
into the flesh on their backs,
white and yellow ghosts, ghosts
that wait. . .
When bathed in yellow light.
Steve softens into an old Chinese
worker who tells a 1914 customs
official that he wants to "grow
without wrinkles into old age."
Whirling red cloth in red light.
Grace becomes the Woman
Warrior who will avenge her
family's blood with blood
Dale's monologues are ridden
with confessions of guilt about
his materialism and his
animosity toward the new Chi
nese Americans — the F.O B.'s.
"They're building an empire of
defective goods and breakable
merchandise!" he shouts
His bratty poutings border on
the cliche: he fidgets as he

moves from one spread stance
to the nex' hands thrust deep in
khaki pockets Dale is the stere
otypy ui an athletic college
macho —■ the American
equivalent of a Taiwanese
"Guang Gong"!
Kelvin Han Yee and Dennis
Dun were superb in their roles
of Dale and Steve. Yee sprinkles
his dialogue with natural
pauses, hesitations and volume
variation so natural that it
seems he is saying the words for
the first time — a difficult chore
after several weeks of per
formance.
His spontaneous rhythm is
perfect for Dale's demanding
gamut of expressions. Though
some of his dialogue is over
written, his brilliant comedic
timing manages to make
phrases like "I'm trying to help
you — I'm trying to make you
like John Travolta'" and "How
can it be fun, it's cheaper 0 "
sound fairly convincing Still, it
is his utterly sincere delivery of
"I think you learned English
faster than anyone I ever met"
to Steve that rings of the play's
true catharsis.
The most sensitive per
formance is given by Dun He
never hesitates, but flows easily
in and out of staccatto-voiced,
Bee Gee fan Steve with hands
folded politely in front of him, to
cocky, bellowing Guang Gong,
and shrivelled old man. Dun
stung the audience's eyes with

his final portrayal: defeated by
the Woman Warrior, he de
generates into a beggar who has
not eaten for a very long time
except for one egg. shell and all
His pleading is so real and we
are so close that we can feel his
spit spraying off the stage.
Grace is played by Smokev
Leung (pun intended 9 ). She ob
viously lacked vocal training
and could not match the depth
and range of expression of Yee
and Dun. Her voice often
strained to a high whine, she an
ticipated reactions and spoke
words automatically, reminding
us she was on a stage and knew
just what was coming next.
Leung assumed emotions as if
applying make up — only her
eyes squinted to a smile, only
her mouth drooped to a pout.
Her movements looked like
blocking. Part of the problem
was that Grace was not as well
defined by the playwright as the
other two roles. Her dialogue
had little punch, punctuated bv
many "y'know"s and "O.K.'s
which required more ease and
freshness in style.
All three actors have trained
at the American Conservatory
Theatre and have appeared in
previous Asian American
Theatre Company productions
F (). B. is playing through Au

Leung assumed emotions as if

Her movements looked like

was that Grace was not as well

The best off-Broadway Amer
ican play of 1980, written by a
Stanford graduate, is now
playing at San Francisco's
Asian American Theatre Com
pany. David Hwang, 24, wrote
the Obie-Award-winning play
before he graduated in 1979.
F. 0.8. was first produced in
March of that year by the Stan
ford Asian American Theatre
Project which Hwang helped to
found.
Tucked away near the corner
of California and Sixth Avenues
is the unpretentious home of the
Asian American Theatre Com
pany. The small, intimate house
sold out to a crowd perhaps 75
percent Asian, and 100 percent
curious about the words behind
the initials FOB.(not as in
watch, certainly).
We learned in the play's open
ing blackboard lecture given by
a spotlighted Chinese in tortoise
shell glasses and British tweed
attire,that FOB. stands for
"Fresh off the boat". He enu
merated with bloated academic
ceremony the characteristics of
a Chinese person newly arrived
from China: "clumsy.ugly,
greasy,. . .four-eyes,big feet,
horny. . like Lenny in Of Mice
and Men." The hilarious but
grossly loud exaggeration
hinted at what was to come: a
glimpse at the pathetic man un
derneath the glossy stereotypes
of Chinese emmigrants as

similating into American cul
ture.
Hwang sharpens the distinc
tion between the reality and the
fantasy of this situation, of this
land for Chinese people, by
dividing the action into two sep
arate stories — one realistic,
one symbolic.
These two plots develop si
multaneously until a surprise
ending twists them together, re
vealing a poetic image that is
their common link.
The realistic story involves
three young Chinese, Dale,
Grace, and Steve. Grace is
wrapping a gift in the back room
of her family's Chinese restau
rant in Torrance, California
when Steve — the "F O B." —
struts in F.0.8.-ishly and
F.0.8.-ishly asks her out on a
date Brandishing a deep voice,
rigid stances and arm postures,
Steve professes to be Guang
Gong, the famous warrior.
Dale, Grace's ultra-American
ized cousin, comes to her rescue
— the prologue s preppie pro
fessor.
The three end up eating din
ner together in the same back
room where the scattered
Heineken bottles vie with the
imposing Chinese warrior paint
ing on the wall. In the same
vein, Dale (Heineken) and Steve
(warrior) give vent to their dif
ferences in a hotsauce-eating
contest When hot words cannot
be exchanged, what does one

do 0
When the three begin an after
dinner storytelling game —
fertile ground for mingling re
ality with fantasy — Dale has
difficulty participating in the
flowery, yet strict passion of
Chinese storytelling. He re
cedes into the narration, letting
the other two warriors
dance/battle the play to its
climax.
Storybook monologues mys
teriously cut into the main
stream of the present action
with the help of red and yellow
lighting, fluid words and mo
tions. Images are spun of two
warrriors, a man and a woman,
with their grievances carved
into the flesh on their backs,
white and yellow ghosts, ghosts
that wait. . .
When bathed in yellow light.
Steve softens into an old Chinese
worker who tells a 1914 customs
official that he wants to "grow
without wrinkles into old age."
Whirling red cloth in red light.
Grace becomes the Woman
Warrior who will avenge her
family's blood with blood
Dale's monologues are ridden
with confessions of guilt about
his materialism and his
animosity toward the new Chi
nese Americans — the F.O B.'s.
"They're building an empire of
defective goods and breakable
merchandise!" he shouts
His bratty poutings border on
the cliche: he fidgets as he

moves from one spread stance
to the nex' hands thrust deep in
khaki pockets Dale is the stere
otypy ui an athletic college
macho —■ the American
equivalent of a Taiwanese
"Guang Gong"!
Kelvin Han Yee and Dennis
Dun were superb in their roles
of Dale and Steve. Yee sprinkles
his dialogue with natural
pauses, hesitations and volume
variation so natural that it
seems he is saying the words for
the first time — a difficult chore
after several weeks of per
formance.
His spontaneous rhythm is
perfect for Dale's demanding
gamut of expressions. Though
some of his dialogue is over
written, his brilliant comedic
timing manages to make
phrases like "I'm trying to help
you — I'm trying to make you
like John Travolta'" and "How
