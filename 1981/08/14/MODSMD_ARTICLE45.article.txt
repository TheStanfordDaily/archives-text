more cautious or tuition credits, saying that

Brown's staff not prosecuted
Sacramento— The Sacramento district at
torney closed his investigation of an alleged
criminal covprup by Gov. Jerry Brown's staff
yesterday, saying there is insufficient evi
dence to go to trial

Although District Attorney Herb Jackson
concluded that "no criminal liability exists"
among Brown's aides, his nine-page report on
the so-called "computergate scandal" fell
short of the complete exoneration that Brown
claimed Jackson's statement represented
Jackson, a Republican, said there was "os
tensible evidence of criminal misconduct" by
two former aides of the Democratic governor,
but that the evidence was not sufficient to go
to trial
Jackson said some statements under oath
bv former Brown aide Lynn Sante "are mis
leading by inference and may even be willful
ly misleading, but that "perjury is among
the most difficult crimes to prove" and that
merely misleading statements arp not per
jury.
