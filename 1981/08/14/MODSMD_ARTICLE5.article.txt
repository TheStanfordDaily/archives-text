## Gov't may loosen Title IX rules 
### Associated Press 
Washington â€” The Reagan
administration said this week it
is considering a sharp reduction
in the scope of a controversial
nine-year-old federal law that
bans aid to schools and colleges
practicing sexual discrimina
tion in athletic programs
The review of the "Title IX"
rules was announced by Vice
President George Bush as part
of the administration's attack
on federal regulations it con
siders unnecessary.
Today's announcement
means 30 more federal regu
lations will undergo an in-depth
"reconsideration" to see wheth
er they can be modified or done
away with.
Bush said the administration
feels guidelines on sexual dis
crimination in athletic pro
grams now provided for vir
tually all of the nation's 16.000
public school districts and more
than 3000 colleges and univer

sities are too vague and impose
excessive administrative
burdens.
Bush said at a news con
ference that the review repre
sents the administration's "on
going effort to lighten the regu
latory burden borne by Ameri
cans across the country."
The athletics discrimination
provision was included in Title
IX of a 1972 education law in
which Congress empowered the
old Department of Health,
Education and Welfare to cut off
federal aid for any school that
does not treat athletics pro
grams for both sexes equally.
HEW issued regulations to
enforce Title IX in 1975 but its
enforcement efforts have been
dogged by controversy. Sports
programs for girls and women
have grown rapidly in the face
of threats from federal civil
rights officials to cut off school
funds for Title IX violations. No
institution actually has lost any
aid.
Even before today's an
nouncement, Education Secre
tary Terrence Bell had ordered
a thorough review of how to en
force Title IX. including wheth
er it applies to colleges whose
only link to federal aid is student
aid.
