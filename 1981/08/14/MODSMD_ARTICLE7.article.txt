# Early findings show ozone damage
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Government scientists
have found the first evidence from the field
that chlorofluorocarbons — once used as
propellants in aerosol sprays and still wide
spread in American industry — may be eat
ing away at the ozone layer that protects
Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
If enough ozone is destroyed, more radi
ation could reach Earth and cause climate
changes, crop damage and many more
cases of skin cancer.
Since 1974, scientists have theorized that
chlorofluorocarbons — CFCs for short —
damage the ozone But this is the first evi
dence of actual depletion in the ozone layer.
These heretofore-unpublished scientific
findings are preliminary, and researchers
are quick to caution that the depletion is
slight However, the findings appear to con
tradict assertions of the chemical industry,
echoed by congressmen, that ozone deple
tion from chlorofluorocarbons is just a theo
ry that never has been supported by actual
study of the ozone layer itself.
CFCs were banned from most aerosol
sprays in 1978 because of concerns for the
ozone However, more than 800 million
pounds of CFCs continue to be produced in
the United States each year and used in
foam products, refrigerators, air condi
tioners and solvents
New data from satellites show that some
depletion apparently has occurred in recent
years in the area of the ozone layer most
vulnerable to CFCs — about 30 miles above
the ground, according to three scientists
with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
"This is the first real indication we've
had that there is any stratospheric deple
tion,'' said Shelby Tilford. chief of at
mospheric processes at NASA. The other
two are Robert Watson, a program scien

tist. and Lawrence Greenwood, director of
environmental observations.
They cannot establish a cause-effect rela
tionship between CFCs and the depletion,
but say that nothing else seems a likely cul
prit. They also stressed that overall ozone —
including ozone near ground level — actual
ly may have increased in the last decade.
But they said that because ozone in the up
per levels is most sensitive, any depletion
there may be an omen of larger reductions
to come.
To further study the cause-effect rela
tionship of CFCs on ozone, a Harvard Uni
versity scientist will launch a giant helium
balloon, 100 times as large as the Goodyear
blimp, that will act as a giant yo-yo in the
stratosphere. There the balloon will gather
data on chemical reactions and help estab
lish the causes of ozone depletion.
James Anderson, a Harvard professor of
chemistry, said the balloon will ascend 28
miles above Earth, and then in an hour's
time will lower an instrument packet on a
line down 12 miles and reel it back up. An
derson said he would launch the balloon,
which is paid for by a $150,000 grant from
NASA, from New Mexico within nine
months.
CFCs, often known by their Du Pont
trademark, Freon, are inert, very stable,
non-toxic and non-flammable. These virtues
also are vices, for their hardiness means
that they do not break down at ground level
but survive until they float up to the ozone
level. There, about six to 30 miles above
Earth's surface, the CFCs are thought to
react with the ozone and destroy it.
Measurements taken from balloons show
steady increases in the number of CFCs in
the stratosphere, said William Kleis, a pro
gram development scientist at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

in Boulder, Colo Ground stations also show
steady increases in CFCs at ground level,
even in isolated places in Alaska and Ha
waii, Kleis said.
The Environmental Protection Agency
published a notice in the Federal Register
last October that it might set limits on the
production of CFCs, but EPA seems to have
backpedaled since then. New EPA Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch indicated in a letter to
a Senate committee she would be suspicious
of new regulation of CFCs.
While research for alternatives is conti
nuing, largely by industry, there now is no
cheap, safe and effective substitute for
CFCs for most uses. However one variety,
known as CFC-22, contains hydrogen and is
much less damaging to ozone. While CFC-22
is not as cheap as other types, it perhaps
could be used in their place for many ap
plications, said Paul Halter, environmental
manager of the Freon Products Division of
Du Pont.
Bolstered by an extremely well-or
ganized lobby of CFC producers and users,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and Rep.
Thomas Luken (D-Ohio) have introduced
bills that would impede the EPA from plac
ing new limits on CFCs. Luken's bill has 64
cosponsors; Bentsen'shas 17.
The crux of the issue is how much ozone
the CFCs will destroy. The earliest figures
were that if production remained steady,
CFCs would deplete the ozone by about 7
percent. A National Academy of Sciences
report raised that to 16.5 percent, but now
most scientists place the figure back in the
range of 5 to 10 percent.
These are figures in the long term, up to
100 years away, and one problem that has
made actual detection of ozone depletion
difficult is that CFCs can take decades to
rise to the stratosphere and disintegrate.

that chlorofluorocarbons — once used as
propellants in aerosol sprays and still wide
spread in American industry — may be eat
ing away at the ozone layer that protects
Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
If enough ozone is destroyed, more radi
ation could reach Earth and cause climate
changes, crop damage and many more
cases of skin cancer.
Since 1974, scientists have theorized that
chlorofluorocarbons — CFCs for short —
damage the ozone But this is the first evi
dence of actual depletion in the ozone layer.
These heretofore-unpublished scientific
findings are preliminary, and researchers
are quick to caution that the depletion is
slight However, the findings appear to con
tradict assertions of the chemical industry,
echoed by congressmen, that ozone deple
tion from chlorofluorocarbons is just a theo
ry that never has been supported by actual
study of the ozone layer itself.
CFCs were banned from most aerosol
sprays in 1978 because of concerns for the
ozone However, more than 800 million
pounds of CFCs continue to be produced in
the United States each year and used in
foam products, refrigerators, air condi
tioners and solvents
New data from satellites show that some
depletion apparently has occurred in recent
years in the area of the ozone layer most
vulnerable to CFCs — about 30 miles above
the ground, according to three scientists
with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
"This is the first real indication we've
had that there is any stratospheric deple
tion,'' said Shelby Tilford. chief of at
mospheric processes at NASA. The other
two are Robert Watson, a program scien

tist. and Lawrence Greenwood, director of
environmental observations.
They cannot establish a cause-effect rela
tionship between CFCs and the depletion,
but say that nothing else seems a likely cul
prit. They also stressed that overall ozone —
including ozone near ground level — actual
ly may have increased in the last decade.
But they said that because ozone in the up
per levels is most sensitive, any depletion
there may be an omen of larger reductions
to come.
To further study the cause-effect rela
tionship of CFCs on ozone, a Harvard Uni
versity scientist will launch a giant helium
balloon, 100 times as large as the Goodyear
blimp, that will act as a giant yo-yo in the
stratosphere. There the balloon will gather
data on chemical reactions and help estab
lish the causes of ozone depletion.
James Anderson, a Harvard professor of
chemistry, said the balloon will ascend 28
miles above Earth, and then in an hour's
time will lower an instrument packet on a
line down 12 miles and reel it back up. An
derson said he would launch the balloon,
which is paid for by a $150,000 grant from
NASA, from New Mexico within nine
months.
CFCs, often known by their Du Pont
trademark, Freon, are inert, very stable,
non-toxic and non-flammable. These virtues
also are vices, for their hardiness means
that they do not break down at ground level
but survive until they float up to the ozone
level. There, about six to 30 miles above
Earth's surface, the CFCs are thought to
react with the ozone and destroy it.
Measurements taken from balloons show
steady increases in the number of CFCs in
the stratosphere, said William Kleis, a pro
gram development scientist at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

in Boulder, Colo Ground stations also show
steady increases in CFCs at ground level,
even in isolated places in Alaska and Ha
waii, Kleis said.
The Environmental Protection Agency
published a notice in the Federal Register
last October that it might set limits on the
production of CFCs, but EPA seems to have
backpedaled since then. New EPA Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch indicated in a letter to
a Senate committee she would be suspicious
of new regulation of CFCs.
While research for alternatives is conti
nuing, largely by industry, there now is no
cheap, safe and effective substitute for
CFCs for most uses. However one variety,
known as CFC-22, contains hydrogen and is
much less damaging to ozone. While CFC-22
is not as cheap as other types, it perhaps
could be used in their place for many ap
plications, said Paul Halter, environmental
manager of the Freon Products Division of
Du Pont.
Bolstered by an extremely well-or
ganized lobby of CFC producers and users,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and Rep.
Thomas Luken (D-Ohio) have introduced
bills that would impede the EPA from plac
ing new limits on CFCs. Luken's bill has 64
cosponsors; Bentsen'shas 17.
The crux of the issue is how much ozone
the CFCs will destroy. The earliest figures
were that if production remained steady,
CFCs would deplete the ozone by about 7
percent. A National Academy of Sciences
report raised that to 16.5 percent, but now
most scientists place the figure back in the
range of 5 to 10 percent.
These are figures in the long term, up to
100 years away, and one problem that has
made actual detection of ozone depletion
difficult is that CFCs can take decades to
rise to the stratosphere and disintegrate.
