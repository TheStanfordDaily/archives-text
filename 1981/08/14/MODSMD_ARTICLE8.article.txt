Rangoon, Burma â€” In the
first voluntary handover of
power in Burma's history,
strongman President Ne Win,
70, has decided to retire from
the presidency because of fail
ing health and old age.
He made the surprise an
nouncement at the final session
of the fourth ruling Burma So
cialist Program Party congress
here last week. He has led the
country, first as a military
ruler, then as its socialist presi
dent, since he overthrew the
government of U Nu nearly 20
years ago.
"I have chosen this particular
time to request permission to
retire from state leadership in
order to ensure a smooth transi
tion of power," he said.
The Burmese leader declared
that although a nation existed
for hundreds of years, "the life
span of man is limited."
"Therefore it is better to
bring about a transition in the
time of your own choice and not
wait till circumstances force
you to do so," he said.
Ne Win came to power in 1962
in the aftermath of a successful
bloodless coup.
