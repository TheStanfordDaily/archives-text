Let Us Give You
The
Business. . .
You've seen our
restaurant pages â€” a
Stanford Daily regular
which features
informative reviews and
critiques of Peninsula and
Bay Area eateries. Call
497-2554 and let one of
our experienced sales reps
show you how to take
advantage of this special
section. You'll see how
easy it is to let the Daily
give you the business.
You've never seen
anything like it. . .
A nocturnal animal, it
has seven terminal
arms and occasionally
short hands, goes to
bed late five nights a
week, writes heads,
lays pages, makes
adlines, deadlines,
cutlines and pics, eats
pizza at night and
sometimes its own
words. It's the Daily,
your newspaper.
You could love it!
