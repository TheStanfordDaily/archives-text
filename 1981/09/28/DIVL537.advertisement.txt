on registration days most students pick up their
registration materials (Permits to Register —
PTRs) at Memorial Auditorium and complete re
gistration inside Maples Pavilion. For this regist
ration we have changed the procedure of the
PTR distribution: on Monday PTRs will be avail

they will be available outside Maples Pavilion on
the Campus Drive side. Specific registration de
