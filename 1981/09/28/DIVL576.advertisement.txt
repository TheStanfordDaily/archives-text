In addition to the Economics Department offerings listed in
Courses and Degrees, 1981-82, the following courses will be
given for the first time:
ECONOMICS 160. Power, Conflict and Cooperation in Economic and
Social Systems
A game theoretic perspective on the analysis of conflict resolution in the economic and
political spheres. We review some basic concepts of Game Theory: Game description,
strategies, the role of information, cooperative vs. non-cooperative games, extensive and
normal forms, and coalitions. The course wi II provide an elementary exposition of a sample
of solution concepts: Minimax, Equilibrium, Core, Bargaining Theory and Shapley value,
concrete examples will be used in analyzing such diverse problems as oligopoly behavior,
the power of the various members of the U.N. Security council, union-management wage
negotiations, disarmament models, taxation and public policy, and the distribution of power
among coalitions in governing bodies. Prerequisites: economics 51 and one course in
calculus, or the consent of the instructor.
5 units, Win TTh 1:15-3:05 Prof. Mordecai Kurz, Director IMSSS-Economics
ECONOMICS 218. Alternative Approaches to the Theory of Techni
cal Change
This course will examine neoclassical and post-Keynesian approaches to technical
change: definitions of neutrality, learning by doing, the invention possibiliy frontier, the
technical progress function, vintage models. Against this background, Marxiasn ap
proaches will be considered, with special attention to the Okishio Theorem and its criti
cism, the bias of technical change, the concept of capitalism-specific constraints shaping
the path of technical change, the interaction of technical change and choice of technique,
and the relation of technical change to other aspects of the late-capitalist mega
corporation.
5 units, Spg Prog. David Laibman, Visiting Professor from Brooklyn College
ECONOMICS 224. Science and Technology in Economic Growth
This course will provide an examination of the roles played by the growth of scientific
knowledge and technical progress in the development of industrial societies. Particular
attention will be paid to understanding the interactions between science and technology as
well as to organizational factors which have influenced their effectiveness in contributing to
productivity growth. Upper division undergraduates may attend with consent of instructor.
5 units, Win Nathan Rosenberg, Fairleigh Dickinson Professor in Economics
Special Undergraduate Seminars
These seminars are designed for limited enrollment. Students seek
ing admission to these must sign up in Room 119, Encina Com
mons, during registration period.
192. Supply Shocks: Macroeconomic Consequences and Policy
Implications — Autumn — Jose Vinals
This seminar will focus on the macroeconomic effects of supply shocks (energy price
changes, etc.) and their policy implications. The first part of the term is devoted to the
discussion of the relevant analytical issues and to its application. We will begin with an
examination of the microecnomic foundations needed for the analysis of the effects of
supply shocks in producion. Then, we will study the short and medium-term mac
roeconomic effects of supply shocks within a general framework which accounts for both
their supply and demand consequences and which emphasizes the real and financial
interactions taking place. Once the general analytical framework is developed, we will
review the empirical evidence available, critically examining a number of models in the
light of our previous discussion. During the second part of the term, students are expected
to work on research projects which combine analytical and applied work on a specific issue
since the main emphasis of the course is to improve students' ability to construct and apply
macroeconomic models.
Prerequisites: Economics 51 and 52. Limited to 15 students.
193. Energy Analysis and Policy — Spring — Lawrence Goulder
This seminar will examine the effects of energy scarcity on economic growth, on the
composition of economic output, and on the distribution of incomes. The course will
concentrate on the U.S. economy, although there will be considerable attention to the
interactions between the U.S. economy and other sources and uses of energy in the rest of
the world. Much of the course will be devoted to presenting analytical techniques for
evaluating energy policies: students will be asked to prepare papers which apply these
techniques to assess particular programs or future scenarios. Policies to be discussed
include: oil and gas price controls and rationing, oil import quotas and tariffs, windfall profits
taxes, oil industry divestiture, incentives for energy conservation, and petrodollar recycl
ing.
Prerequisites: Economics 51 and 52, or consent of the instructor. Umit: 15.
195. Modern Economic History and Problems of Native American
Peoples — Spring — Leonard Carlson
This seminar will consider aspects of historical and modern economic and social problems
of Native American Peoples in the United States. In particular, we will consider the
historical evolution of Indian-White relationshps, changes in U S. Government policies
towards Indians, the historical context of these policies, and how Different Native American
groups responded to these policy changes. In particular we will consider the removal
policy, the formation of reservations, the allotment era, the Indian New Deal,the termina
tion policy, and more recent federal Indian policies. We will also consider current economic
problems of Native Peoples in the United States and to apply economic theory to analyze
these problems. Knowledge of economic theory will be helpful, but the course is open to
history majors and others interested in the problems of Native American Peoples.
Prerequisite: Economics 51 or consent of instructor. Limited to 15.
196. Social Choice and Welfare — Winter — Lawrence Goulder
This seminar concentrates on three basic and closely connected problems in economics:
(1) the formulation of a valid definition or conception of social welfare, (2) the selection of
legitimate and effective rules for choosing among alternative public programs intended to
improve social welfare, and (3) the evaluation of the impacts of proposed or actual public
programs on social welfare. In confronting the first problem, we shall examine the difficul
ties inherent in translating individual welfare into a measure of social well being. A number
of alternative conceptions of social welfare will be investigated from both a philosophical
and economic perspective. The public sector is often called upon to improve social well
being (however defined) by providing goods and services which the private sector does not
supply; the second basic problem above pertains to the issue of obtaining a set of attractive
and practical rules for eliciting individual preferences and deciding which goods and
services should be provided by the public sector. In considering the third problem, we will
discuss cost-benefit analysis and other techniques for measuring the effects of given
public programs on social welfare, with special attention to the information requirements of
the different techniques. Seminar participants will be required to write one research paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 141 or consent of the instructor. Limited to 10 students.
