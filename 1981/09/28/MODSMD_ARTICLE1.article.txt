# This year's freshmen most selective class yet

### Bill Beyda 
Electric, magenta, mega
lopodalic, malapropic, piggish,
shapely, and mysterious — these
are words some of this year's
freshman used to describe them
selves, University President
Donald Kennedy said in a speech
to incoming freshman last Thurs
day.
In more concrete terms, there
are more Californians than last
year, more aspiring engineers,
and fewer students interested in
natural sciences, math, and tech
nology, according to figures re
leased by the Academic Informa
tion Center (AIC) this month.
In hisaddresstofreshmen, Ken
nedy remarked, "We could have
filled the Class of '85 with people
having over 1500 as a combined
SAT score; with Californians, with
people from New York and New
England; with blondes; with the
choosers of one-syllable adjec
tives; or with the financially com
fortable.
"As a matter of fact," Kennedy
went on to say, "we could have
saved nearly three million dollars
on the tightest budget in Stanford
history merely by choosing stu
dents who could afford to pay —
and we could have done that
without reducing the average SAT
score of the class we admitted."
This year's freshman class was
more difficult to get into than any
other before it.
The University received a rec
ord-breaking 14,029 freshmen ap
plications, and ac cepted ?489,just
17.7 percent of the applicant pool,
according ? o the Office of Ad
missions.
Of the entire applicant pool,
there were more than 2000 stu
dents with 4.0 averages in high
school, and well over 7000 had a
3.5 or better average.
Of those that were admitted
here, 1555 decided to enroll (an
addition?! 70 are deferring ad
mission), resulting in a yield ratio
of about 62 percent, comparable
to past years'.
Harvard University had similar
figures, admitting 2148 of 13,846
applicants. At Harvard, however,
only about 39 percent of those ad
mitted were women, compared to
Stanford's 56 percent men and 44
percent women.
Twenty-two percent of the class

belong to minority groups — 7
percent are blacks, and 8 percent
are Chicanos, Kennedy said.
"We have an intense commit
ment to diversity in our student
body," Kennedy told the
freshmen. His words are con
firmed by the statistics on geo
graphical distribution and aca
demic interests, released by the
AIC.
Nearly 4 percent of the class is
looking fora general education,
26.4 percent is interested in the
social sciences, 16.2 percent is
planning premedical or predental
programs, and 10.7 percent is
leaning towards humanities. In
each of these areas there was less
than a 1 percent difference from
last year's entering class.
The 21.6 percent of the class in
terested in natural sciences
mathematics-technology is almost
a 2 percent drop from last year,
while those opting for engineer
ing, 20.9 percent, lepresent more
than a 3.5 percent increase over
last year.
Geographically, this year's
freshmen have a very similar
make-up to that of last year's class.
Northern and Southern Californi
ans comprise 24.4 percent 4.nd
21.8 percent of the class, respec
tively. This represents a 3 percent
increase in Northern California
freshmen and a nearly 1.5 percent
rise in students from Southern
California.
Freshmen from the rest of the
Western states comprise 17.1 per
cent of the ciass (a 1.5 percent de
cline).
Representation elsewhere is as
follows:
— 11.4 percent from the East;
— 8.7 percent from the lakes re
gion;
— 7.3 percent from the South;
— 4.5 percent from the
Midwest;
— and 4.5 percent from for -n
countries.
Seventy percent of the class of
1985 attended public high
schools, while the rest attended
independent or parochial
schools.
The memo from Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon's office
stated, "It's your average ex
cellent freshman class." Hargadon
refused any further comment.
