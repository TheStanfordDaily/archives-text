## Bechtel: How to see the world without leaving the campus 
### Diane Johnson 
For students seeking to brush up on
their foreign language skills, explore a for
eign culture or simply meet with other stu
dents and scholars from around the world,
the Bechtel International Center is just the
place.
Once inside the homey, ivy-laden, re
stored fraternity — also known as the In
ternational or l-Center — onefindsa varie
ty of international resource aids. This in
cludes a library replete with books, guides,
and how-to's for the traveler abroad as
well as spacious rooms for various social,
educational, and cultural programs.
Catherine Gamon, assistant director tor
overseas resources, described the l-Center
as "a place to hang out, to get to know
people from around the world and to learn
about different cultures on an informal
level."
Many social functions are held each
week: lunches, lectures, film series, and
discussion groups, along with Sunday sup
pers in which volunteers cook up their

own cuisine delights. The Bechtel Center
also sponsors an international festival in
the spring and a "Holiday House" at
Christmastime.
According to Gamon, one misconcep
tion of the center is that it offers services
solely for foreign students. "Most Ameri
can students aren't aware of what's avail
able. We encourage them to actively par
ticipate and make use of our resources.
Many use Bechtel to obtain travel informa
tion before going to Europe, for example,
or to explore options for study abroad."
The Bechtel Center does not organize ot
administrate campuses abroad but it can
make the going a bit more manageable,
Gamon explained.
Many students also use the center as an
advisory service for academic, personal
and emigration matters. Another service is
offered — a "language exchange" to
perfect foreign oral conversational skills.
After filling out a card, students meet at a
mutually convenient time to prompt each
other and share experiences, knowledge,
and skills.

Lee Zeigler, director of the Bechtel Cen
ter, cited many areas of expansion within
the Center during the past year, including
five to six new internships through the
University's Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education (SCIRE) and Ac
tion Research Liaison Office (ARLO) pro
grams. These range from international ca
reer programing to residential education
coordinating. Zeigler is also looking fora
person to explore needs of high schools in
the area in an effort to disseminate over
seas knowledge and awareness.
University President Donald Kennedy
"believes undergraduates should be more
aware of what's going on in the world and
the l-Center can help in implementing
that need,"Zeigler said.
The Center also coordinates the
Marshall, Rhodes, and Churchill scholar
ships and the Fulbright grants. The dead
lines for applications are Qct. 2, Nov. 13,
and Oct. 12, respectively. These scholar
ships are available to graduating seniors
and graduate students for advanced study.
