# Checking up on banking — options in the community
## 
### Jean Gregory 
New in town? Looking fora
place to put your money? Or
are you unhappy with your
present bank?
Financial institutions with a
variety of plans are within easy
biking distance of Stanford,
and many of them emphasize
personal rather than business
accounts. In this survey, institu
tions located more than a few
blocks outside Stanford's pe
rimeter as well as rates and
benefits involving large sums
of money have been omitted.
Selecting a bank
To select the right bank, one
must first consider needs.
For the rare check writer, the
charge per debit will be of little
importance. For those who
maintain a minimum balance
in an account, special benefits
are available.
Most banks now have auto
mated tellers nearby; however
some charge for their use, and
not all run 24 hours a day. For
those who receive payroll
checks from the Univerity,
direct deposit plans with Stan
ford payroll may be of interest.
Under these plans, paychecks
or portions of them are sent au
tomatically to the account.
Passbook accounts at all
banks, Savings and Loan ac
counts, and the Stanford Credit
Union draw interest or
dividends at the rate of 5 1 /i per
cent to 5V2 percent.
Checking Accounts
Checking account fees and
rates vary greatly from bank to
bank, and within each institu
tion several plans are usually
available. In general, all Savings
and Loans (S&L's) offer sV«per
cent interest compounded dai
ly on their checking accounts,
for an effective annual yield of
5.47 percent.
While banks also have in
terest-accruing checking ac
counts, minimum balance re
quirements and monthly pen
alty fees for not keeping the
minimum are generally nigh;
one exception being Wells
Fargo. Many institutions have a
hierarchy of minimium bal
ances which qualify the cus
tomer for even greater bene
fits.

Federal regulations allow
S&L's to offer interest-bearing
accounts with no minimum at
the same rates as banks. How
ever, they may not handle cor
porate checking accounts and
do not have as much lending
power as banks.

Credit unions are different
from both because members
actually own them. Member
ship is limited to people who
can meet certain require
ments, usually depending on
where he or a member of his
family works.

Fees and rates at almost all
banking institutionsare subject
to change on short notice. "It's
a competitive game," said
Angel Nawrot, a bookkeeper at
Wells Fargo bank. "When (oth
er banking institutions) change
their rates, we change ours."
Plans such as Bank of Ameri
ca's Custom accounts and Se
curity Pacific's Regular ac
counts are more complex. For
example, monthly fees de
crease with an increasing min
imum balance up to $500.
Interstate Deposits
First Interstate Bank offers an
advantage to those whose
home is elsewhere in the
western United States; the
bank's automated teller card
can be used in any of the auto
mated tellers in 13 western
states for withdrawing cash.
However, one cannot deposit
funds to a California account
from out of state.
So far, interstate deposits are
not covered by existing laws.
For interstate money transfers,
the money must be wired. This
usually takes at least 36 hours,
but the process is simplified
because of the correspon
dence between First Interstate
banks in different states.
Wells Fargo here on campus
offers interest-bearing check

ing accounts as well as three
other checking plans. The
bank's checking/interest plan
gives 5-1/4 percent interest for
a $5 monthly fee (free with $500
minimum or $1000 average
monthly). Wells Fargo also of
fers a wide variety of benefits
through their Gold account, at
a monthly fee of $5. Before
choosing an account, it is best
to estimate future expenses to
avoid spending interest on
higher fees.
Credit Union
The only institution to offer
free checking with interest and
no minimum balance is the
Stanford Federal Credit Union.
However, membership is lim
ited to those who work on Uni

versity land or in the Stanford
Industrial Park, and graduate
students who do not belong to
any other credit union. Under
graduates aie ineligible unless
they receive a Stanford payroll
check, although manystudents
here do because they have jobs
working for the food service, li
braries or the like.
Final step
A final step before opening
an account — ask someone
who banks there whether he or
she is satisfied. How smoothly
are occasional errors handled?
Is a phone call sufficient to cor
rect them? Are the employees
courteous and efficient? Rob
ert Norton, vice president and
manage- of Crocker Bank at

the Stanford Shopping Center
instructs his tellers to "treat the
customer the way you would

want to be treated."
As a customer, you should
accept nothing less. After all, it
is your money.
