## BEYOND OUR CONTROL/Editor's viewpoint Idealism usually falls short 
### 
Looking back over past volumes of The
Stanford Daily, one who has worked on the
paper for any length of time finds cause for both
inspiration and notasmall bit of
disillusionment. In particular, statements by
incoming editors lend themselves to such a dual
reaction.
For these, coming as they have at the
beginning of avolume, generally represent
idealistic sentiments. They have been excellent
statements about all that a newspaper can be.
A newspaper is a source of information, a
collage of images and a storehouse of thoughts.
It isa medium of exchange for human beings —
and a good newspaper should lead those who
look at it to read it about as actively as those who
produced it.
The newspaper is a vehicle to allow large
numbers of people to talk to each other. As
such, it should inform, delight, anger,
challenge, disappoint, and, even, inspire us:
human beings certainly do no less to each other
face-to-face.
It is the specific responsibility of The Stanford
Daily to portray a sense of the life of the
University and the world beyond. We try to do
this on our news and features pages: just as
much, though, we strive to do it with the sports,
entertainment and opinions departments, the
last of which aims to lend a credible forum to as
many voices as possible within the community.
We try to do this with all our departments,
with our photographs and our graphic arts.
Further, we are making a renewed effort this
year, with the creation of a graphics
department, to present it all in a consistent and
appealing package.
So far, so good — but now we get to the
disillusionment. It is this: as hard as we try here

(and we do), we are bound to come up short at
certain times. We will fail to tell the story
completely, or, worse, we will fail to tell it at all.
We will run too many letters espousing a certain
point of view without giving enough voice to
the other. And so on. None of this is said to serve
as an excuse or a justification; it is an
explanation, and it's also something of an
apology in advance.
People's frustrations with the Daily stem, to an
extent, from the fact that the paper has
traditionally been understaffed, and that staff
has been overworked. But they stem even more
from the fact that those who work here do so to
learn, and are bound to make mistakes in the
process, although that does not mean, in the
end, that we take our responsibility to the
community any less seriously. We are trying to
improve where we can, and strongly encourage
those who have any interest in what we do here
to come by and help us with the newspaper.
There is always work to be done and newcomers
are welcome.
Finally, if we are honest about the
disillusionment and why it happens, we can do
something to mitigate it. Please tell us, in your
view, where we fail and what we miss; again, we
can never excuse failures but we can learn from
them. We will this fall, as is our responsibility,
solicit views and hold public meetings at which
the public can discuss the Daily.
Let us know. The next time you mutter into
yourcereal bowlaboutthefailingsof The
Stanford Daily, drop us a note or give us a call to
explain them. And let us know when you like
something: that helps as well. Stanford
University will be better for that exchange.
