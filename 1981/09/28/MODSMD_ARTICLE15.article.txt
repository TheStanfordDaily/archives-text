## Welfare state: Excess spending, programs net poor results 
### 
It has become increasingly and
painfully clear in recent years that the
excesses of the welfare state — in
hundreds of social programs which
the federal government introduced
and expanded under attractive and
impressive-sounding headings such
as "The Great Society" — have been
counterproductive and must be
called a failure. They bear much of
the responsibility for an appalling de
cline in the standing of the United

States and its influence in the rest of
the world, for the country's econom
ic ills and weakened national security
in deterring potential foreign ag
gressors, and for declining safety in
our homes and on city streets.
Only a few decades ago the United
States was the richest and most pow
erful nation on earth, generally rec
ognized asaleaderandenvied bythe
people of most other countries. It no
longer is. Well-intentioned but ill
conceived policies are the cause of
Qur persistent high-rate inflation and
unemployment, excessive interest
rates, deepset social' unhappiness
and widespread friction and unrest.
Many of the measurable results of
some of the social programs adopted

or enlarged within the past quarter
century are small or negative. This is
why President Ronald Reagan in his
inaugural address of January 21,1981,
said: "Government is not the solu
tion to our problem; government is
the problem ..
The welfare state argument is not
over the question whether un
fortunate and needy people ought to
be kept from starving. This has long
been settled in the affirmative. The
question is how far the state can go in
redistributing huge amounts of in
come from productive to non
productive segments of the popu
lation without inflicting serious dam
age on the economy and on society.

While outlays' for social programs
and crime fighting multiplied, so did
major social ills and violent crime.
Public schools, whose excellence
once was a point of national price,
have been deteriorating as educa
tional standards were lowered or
abandoned — and not because they
were being financially starved. Public
expenditures per student have tri
pled in constant dollars over the past
quarter century but the skills and
knowledge of our students and grad
uates are dropping to lower levels ev
ery year.
The incidence of poverty has been
declining. But this was done not by
shifting from welfare to workfare but

by enlarging and expanding the
number and generosity of numerous
social programs — at the expense of
hardworking taxpayers.
Within the past four years the Con
gress adopted, at the recommenda
tion of the then incumbent adminis
tration, the two biggest tax boosts in
United States history which were so
well hidden that most taxpayers do
not even know that they are paying
them. But current proposals to light
en the taxes which burden our
citizens, keep savings and investment
low, and impair industrial expansion
are being fought by special interest
groups which want to maintain a
bloated government and enlarge

their share of the pie instead of help
ing to bake a bigger pie.
Much of the cost of the welfare
state was not raised by boosting tax
es, and thus caused huge budgetary
deficits that led to double-digit infla
tion. Part of the funds was obtained
by slashing defense appropriations
whose share was cut frcm two-thirds
of the federal budget to one-fourth.
In the early 19505, the government
spent about four times as much on
the military as on domestic services;
by the late 1970s it was spending near
ly three times as much on domestic
purposes as on defense. Because of
deficiencies in manpower and
equipment, the ability of our armed

forces to defend the United States
and its vital interests is now in serious
doubt. This puts our national security
in unprecedented peril.
Huge federal spending for
domestic purposes has not brought
forth social miracles. It has instead
generated resentment among those
who felt cheated when the promised
results failed to materialize as the
money was dissipated.
The excesses of the "wayward wel
fare state"in the last three decades
have yielded a poor harvest indeed.
