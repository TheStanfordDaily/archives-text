## Defensive military strategy a rational alternative 
### 
The continuing controversy over the MX
missile raises questions about the doctrine it is
supposed to strengthen: deterrence. I have
two major problems with this scheme.
First, deterrence assumes a mutual per
ception of the horrors of nuclear war and the
capabilities of competing sides which does not
exist. The supposed advantage of keeping
capability secret replaces certainty of calcu
lation with suspicion. Also, the fact that two
countries perceive nuclear annihilation to be
horrible says nothing concerning their defini
tion of horrible nor their perception of accep
table destruction. This informational and
motivational hiatus makes rational calculations
of the deterrence model a joke.
Secondly, the most important problem with
the doctrine of deterrence is its emphasis on

equality. Neither power in the nuclear com
petition can afford to fall behind because the
resulting discrepancy in power would make
the stronger side less fearful of a confrontation
with its weaker adversary, thus removing the
delicate balance provided by an equal fear of
destruction.
Put another way, the rational calculations of
one competitor have now altered substantially
from the other, the restraint of similar per
ception is gone, and with it the security of de
terrence. This is what President Ronald Reagan
means by a window of vulnerability in the 1980s
that he hopes to redress with the MX.
But because neither side can determine ex
actly what constitutes equality (given the in
formation gap), the process of equalizing
capability in fact increases suspicions and in

security which feed the fires of proliferation
rather than dampen them.
The excessive destructivetapability, or over
kill, for me demonstrates the impotence of the
doctrine of deterrence by creating a situation
where the means to an end so clearly outstrip
the ends themselves.
It should be clear that we are caught in a vi
cious circle of our own making. In my mind,
the only way to break out of it is to abandon the
model of deterrence and equality through
capability in favor of defensive strength.
The shift to a defensive posture need not
make us weak. Spiritually, it would be a sign of
great moral strength. Materially, our capability
would be strengthened by resources freed
from the old strategic programs. This would act
as a deterrent to potential invaders, but the

focus would be defensive, and the destructive
capability would be far less than a nuclear hol
ocaust.
Our actions would not need to depend — as
deterrence calculations are supposed to — on
the actions of our competitors. The United
States could take a stand of its own.
The issue is moral courage. Can we break this
vicious cycle or are we condemned to con
tinue this waste of material and spiritual energy
on so fruitless a concept? Should someone start
a nuclear war, the only difference between the
result now or under my proposal would be the
extent of destruction. Is it a victory for us to be
able to destroy such lunatics even as we are de
stroyed ourselves?
