## Viewpoint/John Halamka Jeans hasten fall of western civilization 
### 
What sinister plot of mind bending mastery is
this? What subtle seduction of the mind is being
perpetrated? Could a.seemingly harmless ingenue
really be leading a conspiracy to destroy western
civilization as we know it?
Yes, I say yes. Brooke Shields is attempting to re
sew the fabric of society with unheard of techno
logical support behind her.
Some background. Remember the days of 12
years old? Remember the fun loving frolic of yo
yo's, bubble gum and second order partial dif
ferential equations? Sure you do. What Stanford
student didn't enjoy those years playing in the
park, rolling in a meadow, or quietly proving the
General Theory of Relativity without designer
jeans covering his or her body? What has become
of those carefree innocent days?
Where once were the innocent pangs of trading
baseball cards now are the pangs of "you've got
the look that wants to come to my apartment."
has western civilization been
the age of puberty?
designer jeans — made from form fitting fabrics to
highlight the two to 12-year-old body — are the
culprit.
The decline of western civilization as we know it
begins as Sassoon replaces spellinß books, Van

Let's examine the historical context to elucidate
the powerful nature of seemingly innocent denim:
•Gregor Mendel, while experimenting with
peas wrote: "the entire pattern of the developing
individual seems to be based in the Jeans."
•James Watson, famous biologist, wrote: "The
Jeans are the SOURCE of transmission for the he
reditary characteristics and even social notions of
the control group."
Shall we stand up and support this outrage?
Stanford University doesl I quote a Stanford Ob
server article from June of this year which reads:
"Stanford will earn in excess of $10 million for its

engineering of Jeans."
So Brooke isn't in this alone! She has backup
support from scientists worldwide, not to mention
the manufacturing interests.
Even the animal market is being exploited. Ac
cording to Blood: "Jeans were extracted from rat
hemoglobin and demonstrated .. What can we
do to prevent this conspiracy from spreacfihg?
First, realize that scientific evidence dictates that
Jeans are the mind and the soul of each individual.
The designer label simply adds a control, a need to
grasp a single maker's Jean structure. What Brooke
Shields really means is "Nothing comes between
me and my Cowvins, except my mind."
Second, realize that the government is in this al
ready. When the FDA wants to take a product off
the market, "because it harms the Jeans," buy it
and uje it liberally. No manufacturing interest will
be able to stand the abuse.
Last, realize that life is not two back pockets. Life
is not a close-up of the posterior, a hockey team, a
punk jean craving fiend, or a bleached blonde in
blue denim. Life is more serious, more intellectual.
All in all, life is Bermuda shorts and basketball
sneakers.
