## Reagan's claim of 'painless' Calif, welfare cuts disputed 
### Washington Post 
Los Angeles — President Ronald Reagan
has recalled twice on nationwide television
that he dropped 350,000 people from the Cal
ifornia welfare rolls without pain to the truly
needy and deserving.
"In California," he said Thursday night,
"when I was governor and embarked upon
welfare reform, there were screams from
those who claimed that we intended to vic
timize the needy. But in a little over three
years we saved the taxpayer some $2 billion at
the same time we were able to increase the
grants for the deserving and truly needy by an
average of more than 40 percent. It was the
first cost-of-living increase they have re
ceived in 13 years."
On March 6, Reagan said, "We never had a
single case of anyone appearing and saying, 'I
am destitute. I've been cut off welfare.' "
But some California scholars and lawyers
recall it differently.
In an old controversy with new, national
implications, welfare experts say the decline
in California relief rolls in the early 1970s re
sulted mostly from a fortuitous upswing in
the state's economy.
Reagan's plans or better days?
Experts here still express admiration for
Reagan's modest success at tightening Cali
fornia's welfare procedures, but they dispute
some of his claims about how this tightening
was carried out.
Ralph Abascal, now general counsel for
California Rural Legal Assistance, said he filed
40 lawsuits in the early 1970s on behalf of wel
fare recipients about to become destitute be
cause of Reagan's program.
Abascal, asked for his reaction to Reagan's
remarks, said, "In one word? Disgust. Disgust
at the Reagan people and their manipulative
use of statistics and frustration with the press
for their inability to cut through that."
However, Robert Carleson, Reagan's wel
fare director in Sacramento, and chief wel
fare adviser in Washington, said it is actually
the president's critics who are manipulating
figures.
"Even to this day they ignore the fact that
not only did the rolls drop by about 300,000,

but the state budget analyst (and many of
Reagan's critics) predicted welfare rolls
would increase by 500,000 during that same
period," said Carleson, special assistant to the
president for policy development.
The most detailed critical analysis of his
claim occurs in a little-noticed 1976 report by
welfare experts Frank Levy, now a senior re
search associate at the Urban Institute in
Washington, and Michael Wiseman, now an
associate professor of ecnomics at the UC —
Berkeley.
Stricter standards
They concluded that, although Aid to Fami
lies with Dependent Children dropped
278,000 people from its rolls from January
1971 to August 1974, only 25 percent of that
drop could be credited to Reagan's welfare
reforms.
"The California recession peaked in 1971
and then declined through 1973 before be
coming severe again in the second half of
1974," the report said. It noted that this peri
od matched the time of sharp decline in wel
fare rolls.
In a telephone interview, Carleson said
Levy and Wiseman missed the point.
Carleson acknowledged that the improving
economy helped reduce the rolls, "but that
was our goal, to make sure the rolls did fluc
tuate with the economy."
Before Reagan toughened the income
standards for welfare clients and tightened
checking procedures, such as requiring a
monthly income report before recipients re
ceived their money, the welfare rolls in
creased whether the economy was good or
bad, Carleson said. "Everybody got real quiet
when they went up in good times," he said.
"The decline in family size should also be
attributed to the reforms," Carleson said.
Once the reform program began, "they had
to prove they really had three kids."
Wiseman called "preposterous" the claim
that Reagan's checking procedures brought
the recorded decline in welfare family size.
"In all my years," Wiseman said, "I have nev
er run into a case of the number of depen
dents being falsely reported."
