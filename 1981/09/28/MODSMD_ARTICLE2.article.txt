# Stanford rocked by spraying, budget
## 
### Carl Johnston 
It was a busy summer.
Along with the rest of the country,
the Stanford community watched
with concern the passage of Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's conservative
budget, as stagflation continued to
gnaw into the base of the economy.
The University will be affected
deeply by the events this summer,
particularly those related to the
budget. Here are some of the impor
tant stories.
Top administrators here spent
much time trying to determine how
the University might suffer or benefit
from the president's fiscal policy,
which calls for large budget and tax
cuts.
Stanford stands to lose a reported
$35 million because Congress
omitted the National Science Foun
dation from the June 26 federal

budget. NSF grants account for one
third of research funds here.
Until recently it was considered
certain that NSF would be refunded
through a separate bill before Con
gress. However, many are concerned
that the new fiscal year is about to
start and the federal administration
talks of more budget cuts, not of ad
ditional funding.
Graduate students in research are
expected to be hit hardest by the
cuts.
University President Donald Ken
nedy went to Washington several
times this summer to oppose the dis
mantlement of the NSF and other
government programs that affect
higher education.
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSI)
and National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL) will become more difficult to
obtain under the Reagan austerity
program. 4500 students here current

ly borrow more than $13 million
through the GSL program.
Under the new guidelines, it is esti
mated that one-third of these stu
dents would be ineligible because fi
nancial need must now be demon
strated.
Kennedy, however, also went to
Washington to look for benefits that
might come to the University as a re
sult of the new tax cuts. He has said
that the University should look more
actively for research funds from
private sources, including industry.
Her honor, the justice
The first woman appointed to the
Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, is a Stanford Law School
alumna, and she is the second mem
ber of the class of 1952 currently serv
ing on the Court (the other is Justice
William Rehnquist).
Although O'Connor encountered
some opposition during her Senate

confirmation hearings from right-to
life groups concerned about her
guarded views on abortion, she
breezed through the process with
hardiy a hitch. She won confirmation
by a unanimous vote, 99-0.
O'Connor was also a member of
the Board of Trustees here, serving
from 1976 to 1980. (More on
O'Connor in story above.)
Madfly
Every Monday night, for at least an
other month and perhaps for months
after that, the campus will be sprayed
from the air by helicopters carrying
weak concentrations of the pesticide
malathion.
Infestation by the Mediterranean
fruit fly in the area created a political
controversy over the use of the
pesticide â€” a debate in which Stan
ford pharmacologists took part.
