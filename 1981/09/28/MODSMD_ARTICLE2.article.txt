# Stanford rocked by spraying, budget
## 
### Carl Johnston 
It was a busy summer.
Along with the rest of the country,
the Stanford community watched
with concern the passage of Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's conservative
budget, as stagflation continued to
gnaw into the base of the economy.
The University will be affected
deeply by the events this summer,
particularly those related to the
budget. Here are some of the impor
tant stories.
Top administrators here spent
much time trying to determine how
the University might suffer or benefit
from the president's fiscal policy,
which calls for large budget and tax
cuts.
Stanford stands to lose a reported
$35 million because Congress
omitted the National Science Foun
dation from the June 26 federal

budget. NSF grants account for one
third of research funds here.
Until recently it was considered
certain that NSF would be refunded
through a separate bill before Con
gress. However, many are concerned
that the new fiscal year is about to
start and the federal administration
talks of more budget cuts, not of ad
ditional funding.
Graduate students in research are
expected to be hit hardest by the
cuts.
University President Donald Ken
nedy went to Washington several
times this summer to oppose the dis
mantlement of the NSF and other
government programs that affect
higher education.
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSI)
and National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL) will become more difficult to
obtain under the Reagan austerity
program. 4500 students here current

ly borrow more than $13 million
through the GSL program.
Under the new guidelines, it is esti
mated that one-third of these stu
dents would be ineligible because fi
nancial need must now be demon
strated.
Kennedy, however, also went to
Washington to look for benefits that
might come to the University as a re
sult of the new tax cuts. He has said
that the University should look more
actively for research funds from
private sources, including industry.
Her honor, the justice
The first woman appointed to the
Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, is a Stanford Law School
alumna, and she is the second mem
ber of the class of 1952 currently serv
ing on the Court (the other is Justice
William Rehnquist).
Although O'Connor encountered
some opposition during her Senate

confirmation hearings from right-to
life groups concerned about her
guarded views on abortion, she
breezed through the process with
hardiy a hitch. She won confirmation
by a unanimous vote, 99-0.
O'Connor was also a member of
the Board of Trustees here, serving
from 1976 to 1980. (More on
O'Connor in story above.)
Madfly
Every Monday night, for at least an
other month and perhaps for months
after that, the campus will be sprayed
from the air by helicopters carrying
weak concentrations of the pesticide
malathion.
Infestation by the Mediterranean
fruit fly in the area created a political
controversy over the use of the
pesticide — a debate in which Stan
ford pharmacologists took part.
To save the state's $14.1
billion agri-business from de
vestation by the pest,
malathion is being applied to a
1250 square mile area that skirts
the southern part of the Bay,
the San Joaquin Valley and San
ta Cruz County, a heavily set
tled area. This is being done in
spite of fears that malathion, a
suspected carcinogen, might
do more harmtohumansliving
in the area, particularly to un
born children, than would the
Medfly.
The only other urban area to
be sprayed with an aerial
pesticide was Miami, which
fought the fly in 1955.
One person particularly con
cerned about these dangers
was Medical Center pharma
cologist Dr. Sumner Kalman
who called the spraying plans
an "indefensible experiment
using humans as guinea pigs."
Gov. Jerry Brown, in a July irv
terview with the Los Angeles
Times, credited Kalman with
convincing him to reconsider
aerial spraying when the op
tion was first given to him July
8.
In what may have been his
single most costly political de
cision, Brown called for an all
out ground effort to eradicate
the fly rather than allow aerial
spraying to go ahead. Two days
later, on July 10, he was effec
tively overridden by a USDA
decision to quarantine all Cali
fornia produce unless the
spraying took place.
Spraying began on July 14,

but it wasn't until fertile
Medflies were found in San
Mateo County 10 days later
that spraying began at Stan
ford.
On campus, pregnant wom
en, many of whom lived in
Escondido Village, were per
haps most concerned about
the spraying. Malathion is sus
pected of causing defects in
unborn children.
The Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, the only teaching and
research preserve owned by a
university in the country, was
also a source for concern. Since
no host trees for the Medfly are
known to be in Jasper Ridge
area, however, the preserve
has been spared, although a
helicopter accidently sprayed
10 percent of the preserve July
19.
At the moment it is not really
known how long spraying will
have to continue. Optimists say
spraying can stop November 1.

Others say that it will continue
through next spring.
Heart-lung transplants
Three heart-lung transplants
at the Medical Center gave the
world something to wonder at.
Two of the transplantees, Mary
Gholke,4s, and Charles Walk
er, 30, were released this sum
mer and are still in good health.
The third heart-lung was per
formed on 28-year-old Karen
Wilson. The surgery was com
plicated, taking three times the
usual time for such an opera
tion. She died only four days af
ter her July 24 operation.
Genetic engineering
The unprecedented plan to
license the use of gene-splicing
genetic engineering tech
niques announced this sum
mer will not only makemillions
for Stanford, but, with its pos
sible commercial applications,
give promise of a new in
dustrial revolution.
The proposed licensing plan,

reported August 7, would cov
er the whole genetic industry
both in the United States and
abroad, and allow the Univer
sity to receive royalties on all
the commercially developed
products that result from the
technique.
The technique was dis
covered and patented by Stan
ford's Dr. Stanley Cohen, and
Dr. Herbert Boyer of the Uni
versity ofCalifornia at San Fran
cisco, both of whom relin
quished their royalties to their
respective universities.
The emphasis of this licens
ing plan is to strengthen the re
lationship of industry and uni
versity with its relatively easy
terms. Companies applying for
licensing would pay $10,000 in
itially and anotherslo,ooo an
nually. They may then credit
five times these fees (up to 10
percent) against future royal
ties on their products.

TRESIDDER UNION RENOVATION — Union Crossroads, the Tresidder Union cafeteria (formerly
"The Transition"), underwent a "complete aesthetic remodeling" which includes carpeted eating
areas, plants, increased seating capacity and improved lighting.
The University Commission
on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) recommended last June
giving up on voting proxy is
sues — at least for this year.
Voting on shareholder prox
ies has been a way for the Uni
versity to voice opposition to
what it sees as oppressive or
dangerous policies of corpo
rations in which it owns shares.
According to Assoc. Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who co
chaired the advisory com
mission, proxy vote decisions

have consumed a tremendous
amount of the commission's
time, but have produced few if
any concrete results.
Hiller stressed that the de
cision to withdraw from proxy
voting would not be a "step
back" for the University. The
reason the CIR called fora
moratorium, he said,was to
give the commission time to
seek more effective ways of
dealing with proxy issues and
investment responsibility.
This issue has a controversial
history on this campus: four

years ago 294 persons were ar
rested at a sit-in at the Old
Union protesting Stanford's in
vestment in companies doing
business with South Africa.
Boys' Town
The Boys' Town Center, cur
rently in litigation against
Father Flanagan's Boys' Home
of Nebraska which cut off
funds to the sociological re
search center last December,
began to face drastic cutbacks
in funding. This summer it was
able to fund only 16 percent of
its regular summer program.
Shockley suit
Claiming his "rights of free
dom of speech have been
thwarted," Dr. William
Shockley, a Nobel prizewinner
and retired University pro
fessor, initiated a $1.25 million
suit against the newspaper.
Shockley claimed that an
article printed in July one year
ago falsely represented him to
the 200,000 readers of the At
lanta Constitution as approving
of Hitler's super race programs.
These included surgical experi
ments on Jews and defectives.
Peter Coutts Hill
After more than a year of
tough negotiations between
University officials and com
munity groups, construction
fora $19 million condominium
project on Peter Coutts Hill
began July 24.
The badly needed new
dwelling units will not be sold
cheaply. They will sell for be
tween $165,000 and $225,000.

Chapin. shown here performing at Frost Amphitheatre last spring,
was killed in an automobile accident in July. During his dist

hit singles, including "Cat's in the Cradle" and "Taxi". He was 38
years old.

Room-to-room searches in
student residences was being
considered by the Energy Sur
charge Advisory Committee
this summer as a way to keep
tabs on students who might be
evading the new surcharge on
refrigerators or waterbeds.
After considerable objection

from members of the ASSU
nowever, the room searches,
which would have taken place
several times a year, have been
dropped from consideration.
COP-member Fred Buhl
claimed that the searches vio
late the Fundamental Standard
set up in 1906 to establish stan
dards of student conduct.

Amid charges of "double
billing" and misappropriation
of funding, the University
Medical Center agreed to re
imburse Medicare for $1.5 mil
lion in overcharges for the
years 1975 through 1977.
The settlement followed an
investigation by the federal
Department of Health and Hu
man Services (HHS) audit agen
cy.
The investigation found the
Med Center had overstated its
physicians' costs by more than
$5 million during the years 1975
through 1978. The $1.5 million
represented Medicare's esti
mated overpayment to the
medical facility.
A University attorney called
the return of the money an un
usually large but routine ad
justement to the Medicare ac
count. He denied any inten
tional wrongdoing on the Uni
versity's part, saying that the
overpayment was due to a
faulty method of accounting
for physicians' time at the Med
Center.

It was a busy summer.
Along with the rest of the country,
the Stanford community watched
with concern the passage of Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's conservative
budget, as stagflation continued to
gnaw into the base of the economy.
The University will be affected
deeply by the events this summer,
particularly those related to the
budget. Here are some of the impor
tant stories.
Top administrators here spent
much time trying to determine how
the University might suffer or benefit
from the president's fiscal policy,
which calls for large budget and tax
cuts.
Stanford stands to lose a reported
$35 million because Congress
omitted the National Science Foun
dation from the June 26 federal

budget. NSF grants account for one
third of research funds here.
Until recently it was considered
certain that NSF would be refunded
through a separate bill before Con
gress. However, many are concerned
that the new fiscal year is about to
start and the federal administration
talks of more budget cuts, not of ad
ditional funding.
Graduate students in research are
expected to be hit hardest by the
cuts.
University President Donald Ken
nedy went to Washington several
times this summer to oppose the dis
mantlement of the NSF and other
government programs that affect
higher education.
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSI)
and National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL) will become more difficult to
obtain under the Reagan austerity
program. 4500 students here current

ly borrow more than $13 million
through the GSL program.
Under the new guidelines, it is esti
mated that one-third of these stu
dents would be ineligible because fi
nancial need must now be demon
strated.
Kennedy, however, also went to
Washington to look for benefits that
might come to the University as a re
sult of the new tax cuts. He has said
that the University should look more
actively for research funds from
private sources, including industry.
Her honor, the justice
The first woman appointed to the
Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, is a Stanford Law School
alumna, and she is the second mem
ber of the class of 1952 currently serv
ing on the Court (the other is Justice
William Rehnquist).
Although O'Connor encountered
some opposition during her Senate

confirmation hearings from right-to
life groups concerned about her
guarded views on abortion, she
breezed through the process with
hardiy a hitch. She won confirmation
by a unanimous vote, 99-0.
O'Connor was also a member of
the Board of Trustees here, serving
from 1976 to 1980. (More on
O'Connor in story above.)
Madfly
Every Monday night, for at least an
other month and perhaps for months
after that, the campus will be sprayed
from the air by helicopters carrying
weak concentrations of the pesticide
malathion.
Infestation by the Mediterranean
fruit fly in the area created a political
controversy over the use of the
pesticide — a debate in which Stan
ford pharmacologists took part.
To save the state's $14.1
billion agri-business from de
vestation by the pest,
malathion is being applied to a
1250 square mile area that skirts
the southern part of the Bay,
the San Joaquin Valley and San
ta Cruz County, a heavily set
tled area. This is being done in
spite of fears that malathion, a
suspected carcinogen, might
do more harmtohumansliving
in the area, particularly to un
born children, than would the
Medfly.
The only other urban area to
be sprayed with an aerial
pesticide was Miami, which
fought the fly in 1955.
One person particularly con
cerned about these dangers
was Medical Center pharma
cologist Dr. Sumner Kalman
who called the spraying plans
an "indefensible experiment
using humans as guinea pigs."
Gov. Jerry Brown, in a July irv
terview with the Los Angeles
Times, credited Kalman with
convincing him to reconsider
aerial spraying when the op
tion was first given to him July
8.
In what may have been his
single most costly political de
cision, Brown called for an all
out ground effort to eradicate
the fly rather than allow aerial
spraying to go ahead. Two days
later, on July 10, he was effec
tively overridden by a USDA
decision to quarantine all Cali
fornia produce unless the
spraying took place.
Spraying began on July 14,

but it wasn't until fertile
Medflies were found in San
Mateo County 10 days later
that spraying began at Stan
ford.
On campus, pregnant wom
en, many of whom lived in
Escondido Village, were per
haps most concerned about
the spraying. Malathion is sus
pected of causing defects in
unborn children.
The Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, the only teaching and
research preserve owned by a
university in the country, was
also a source for concern. Since
no host trees for the Medfly are
known to be in Jasper Ridge
area, however, the preserve
has been spared, although a
helicopter accidently sprayed
10 percent of the preserve July
19.
At the moment it is not really
known how long spraying will
have to continue. Optimists say
spraying can stop November 1.

Others say that it will continue
through next spring.
Heart-lung transplants

at the Medical Center gave the
world something to wonder at.

The third heart-lung was per
formed on 28-year-old Karen
Wilson. The surgery was com
plicated, taking three times the
usual time for such an opera

ter her July 24 operation.
Genetic engineering
The unprecedented plan to
license the use of gene-splicing
genetic engineering tech
niques announced this sum
mer will not only makemillions
for Stanford, but, with its pos
sible commercial applications,
give promise of a new in
dustrial revolution.
The proposed licensing plan,

reported August 7, would cov
er the whole genetic industry
both in the United States and
abroad, and allow the Univer
sity to receive royalties on all
the commercially developed
products that result from the
technique.
The technique was dis
covered and patented by Stan
ford's Dr. Stanley Cohen, and
Dr. Herbert Boyer of the Uni
versity ofCalifornia at San Fran
cisco, both of whom relin
quished their royalties to their
respective universities.
The emphasis of this licens
ing plan is to strengthen the re

versity with its relatively easy
terms. Companies applying for
licensing would pay $10,000 in
itially and anotherslo,ooo an

five times these fees (up to 10
percent) against future royal

Madfly
Every Monday night, for at least an
other month and perhaps for months
after that, the campus will be sprayed
from the air by helicopters carrying
weak concentrations of the pesticide
malathion.
Infestation by the Mediterranean
fruit fly in the area created a political
controversy over the use of the
pesticide — a debate in which Stan
ford pharmacologists took part.
To save the state's $14.1
billion agri-business from de
vestation by the pest,
malathion is being applied to a
1250 square mile area that skirts
the southern part of the Bay,
the San Joaquin Valley and San
ta Cruz County, a heavily set
tled area. This is being done in
spite of fears that malathion, a
suspected carcinogen, might
do more harmtohumansliving
in the area, particularly to un
born children, than would the
Medfly.
The only other urban area to
be sprayed with an aerial
pesticide was Miami, which
fought the fly in 1955.
One person particularly con
cerned about these dangers
was Medical Center pharma
cologist Dr. Sumner Kalman
who called the spraying plans
an "indefensible experiment
using humans as guinea pigs."
Gov. Jerry Brown, in a July irv
terview with the Los Angeles

convincing him to reconsider
aerial spraying when the op

In what may have been his
single most costly political de

TRESIDDER UNION RENOVATION — Union Crossroads, the Tresidder Union cafeteria (formerly
"The Transition"), underwent a "complete aesthetic remodeling" which includes carpeted eating
areas, plants, increased seating capacity and improved lighting.
The University Commission
on Investment Responsibility
(CIR) recommended last June
giving up on voting proxy is
sues — at least for this year.
Voting on shareholder prox
ies has been a way for the Uni
versity to voice opposition to
what it sees as oppressive or
dangerous policies of corpo
rations in which it owns shares.
According to Assoc. Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who co
chaired the advisory com
mission, proxy vote decisions

have consumed a tremendous
amount of the commission's
time, but have produced few if
any concrete results.
Hiller stressed that the de
cision to withdraw from proxy
voting would not be a "step
back" for the University. The
reason the CIR called fora
moratorium, he said,was to
give the commission time to
seek more effective ways of
dealing with proxy issues and
investment responsibility.
This issue has a controversial
history on this campus: four

years ago 294 persons were ar
rested at a sit-in at the Old
Union protesting Stanford's in
vestment in companies doing
business with South Africa.
Boys' Town
The Boys' Town Center, cur
rently in litigation against
Father Flanagan's Boys' Home
of Nebraska which cut off
funds to the sociological re
search center last December,
began to face drastic cutbacks
in funding. This summer it was
able to fund only 16 percent of
its regular summer program.
Shockley suit
Claiming his "rights of free
dom of speech have been
thwarted," Dr. William
Shockley, a Nobel prizewinner
and retired University pro
fessor, initiated a $1.25 million
suit against the newspaper.
Shockley claimed that an
article printed in July one year
ago falsely represented him to
the 200,000 readers of the At
lanta Constitution as approving
of Hitler's super race programs.
These included surgical experi
ments on Jews and defectives.

Room-to-room searches in
student residences was being
considered by the Energy Sur
charge Advisory Committee
this summer as a way to keep
tabs on students who might be
evading the new surcharge on
refrigerators or waterbeds.
After considerable objection

from members of the ASSU
nowever, the room searches,
which would have taken place
several times a year, have been
dropped from consideration.
COP-member Fred Buhl
claimed that the searches vio
late the Fundamental Standard
set up in 1906 to establish stan
dards of student conduct.

Amid charges of "double
billing" and misappropriation
of funding, the University
Medical Center agreed to re
imburse Medicare for $1.5 mil
lion in overcharges for the
years 1975 through 1977.
The settlement followed an
investigation by the federal
Department of Health and Hu
man Services (HHS) audit agen
cy.
The investigation found the
Med Center had overstated its
physicians' costs by more than
$5 million during the years 1975
through 1978. The $1.5 million
represented Medicare's esti
mated overpayment to the
medical facility.
A University attorney called
the return of the money an un
usually large but routine ad
justement to the Medicare ac
count. He denied any inten
tional wrongdoing on the Uni
versity's part, saying that the
overpayment was due to a
faulty method of accounting
for physicians' time at the Med
Center.

reconstruction of Storey House, which was almost completely de

should be finished by next spring.
It was a busy summer.
Along with the rest of the country,
the Stanford community watched
with concern the passage of Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's conservative
budget, as stagflation continued to
gnaw into the base of the economy.
The University will be affected
deeply by the events this summer,
particularly those related to the
budget. Here are some of the impor
tant stories.
Top administrators here spent
much time trying to determine how
the University might suffer or benefit
from the president's fiscal policy,
which calls for large budget and tax
cuts.
Stanford stands to lose a reported
$35 million because Congress
omitted the National Science Foun
dation from the June 26 federal

budget. NSF grants account for one
third of research funds here.
Until recently it was considered
certain that NSF would be refunded
through a separate bill before Con
gress. However, many are concerned
that the new fiscal year is about to
start and the federal administration
talks of more budget cuts, not of ad
ditional funding.
Graduate students in research are
expected to be hit hardest by the
cuts.
University President Donald Ken
nedy went to Washington several
times this summer to oppose the dis
mantlement of the NSF and other
government programs that affect
higher education.
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSI)
and National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL) will become more difficult to
obtain under the Reagan austerity
program. 4500 students here current

ly borrow more than $13 million
through the GSL program.
Under the new guidelines, it is esti
mated that one-third of these stu
dents would be ineligible because fi
nancial need must now be demon
strated.
Kennedy, however, also went to

might come to the University as a re

that the University should look more

versity to voice opposition to
what it sees as oppressive or
dangerous policies of corpo
rations in which it owns shares.
According to Assoc. Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, who co
chaired the advisory com
mission, proxy vote decisions

have consumed a tremendous
amount of the commission's
time, but have produced few if
any concrete results.
Hiller stressed that the de
cision to withdraw from proxy
voting would not be a "step
back" for the University. The
reason the CIR called fora
moratorium, he said,was to
give the commission time to
seek more effective ways of
dealing with proxy issues and
investment responsibility.
This issue has a controversial
history on this campus: four

years ago 294 persons were ar
rested at a sit-in at the Old
Union protesting Stanford's in
vestment in companies doing
business with South Africa.

its regular summer program.
Shockley suit
Claiming his "rights of free
dom of speech have been
thwarted," Dr. William
Shockley, a Nobel prizewinner
and retired University pro
fessor, initiated a $1.25 million
suit against the newspaper.

article printed in July one year
ago falsely represented him to
the 200,000 readers of the At
lanta Constitution as approving
of Hitler's super race programs.
These included surgical experi
ments on Jews and defectives.

munity groups, construction

Room-to-room searches in
student residences was being
considered by the Energy Sur
charge Advisory Committee
this summer as a way to keep
tabs on students who might be
evading the new surcharge on
refrigerators or waterbeds.
After considerable objection

from members of the ASSU
nowever, the room searches,
which would have taken place
several times a year, have been
dropped from consideration.
COP-member Fred Buhl
claimed that the searches vio
late the Fundamental Standard
set up in 1906 to establish stan
dards of student conduct.

Amid charges of "double
billing" and misappropriation
of funding, the University
Medical Center agreed to re
imburse Medicare for $1.5 mil
lion in overcharges for the
years 1975 through 1977.
The settlement followed an
investigation by the federal
Department of Health and Hu
man Services (HHS) audit agen
cy.
The investigation found the
Med Center had overstated its
physicians' costs by more than
$5 million during the years 1975
through 1978. The $1.5 million
represented Medicare's esti
mated overpayment to the
medical facility.
A University attorney called
the return of the money an un
usually large but routine ad
justement to the Medicare ac
count. He denied any inten
tional wrongdoing on the Uni
versity's part, saying that the
overpayment was due to a
faulty method of accounting
for physicians' time at the Med
Center.
