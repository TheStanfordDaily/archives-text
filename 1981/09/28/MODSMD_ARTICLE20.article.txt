# 'Price's Pit' is Superfund trial
## 
### 
Egg Harbor Township, NJ
(AP) — For most of his 62 years,
Melvin Johnson lived next to a
landfill, a gravel dig-turned
garbage dump named Price's
Pit.
Three years ago, he lost a
kidney. Then emphysema
struck, then bladder troubles.
Melvin Johnson died this
summer, just two months
before a government attorney
called the 22-acre dump "the
most serious environmental
problem in the United States."
The US Environmental Pro
tection Agency says industrial
wastes dumped in Price's Pit in
1971 and 1972 have been silent
ly threatening the Johnsons, at
least 36 neighbors and Atlantic
City's municipal water supply
for the better part of a decade.
The chemicals include
arsenic, benzene, lead, cad
mium, chloroform, vinyl
chloride and several industrial
de-greasers. Several are known
carcinogens and all are oozing
into the great Cohansey
aquifer of the Pine Barrens,
on© of the East's purest and
most plentiful ground water
supplies.
Few knew of the danger until
two years ago.
Grime from the faucet
The Johnson family, like
their working-class neighbors
and Atlantic City officials,
many years ago sank their
fresh-water wells into the
sandy soil six miles northwest

of the Boardwalk. The water
then was clean and sweet.
Today, the Johnsons' tap
spews battleship gray. The wa
ter stains their modest bath
room tile and the linoleum
floor. It smells like horseradish
and turpentine.
Johnson, a township em
ployee, could not work in the
months before his death July
17. His widow and her at
torneys blame the water for
Johnson's medical problems,
for her own unexplained
rashes, for their daughter's
headaches and for their grand
son's need for leg braces.
The Johnson's are not alone
with their complaints.
Recently, alarmed Atlantic
City officials began scrambling
to save their 12 wells, which
supplied 90 percent of their
water needs last year — up to
15 million gallons a day for the
city's 40,000 residents and mil
lionsof gambling touristsatthe
Boardwalk's new casino hotels.
They are paying for ,a
$234,000 study to define the
Price's Pit pollution and come
up with solutions. They may
drill five emergency wells.
Most serious environmental
problem
The EPA in a lawsuit filed last
December and amended last
Monday, characterized the
landfill as the nation's most se
rious environmental problem
because of the pollution threat
to Atlantic City's water supply,

said Charles Walsh, an assistant
US attorney in Newark.
The EPA claims that nine dis
posal companies and 10 major
industrial firms, including such
giants as Procter & Gamble Co.,
Union Carbide Corp. and Hon
eywell Inc., are among those
responsible for the dumping.
The amendment to the suit
named the companies alleged
ly involved in the dumping,
thus making the suit the first le
gal action under new federal
"superfund" legislation which
established a billion-dollar
fund to clean up pollution
emergencies and hold guilty
firms financially responsible.
This past spring, US District
Judge Stanley Brotman, sitting
in Camden, heard legal and
technical testimony on the
landfill's pollution. Dr. George
Pinder, a Princeton University
civil engineering professor,
warned that the chemicals,
some in quantities thousands
of times higher than safe levels,
are now within 1000 feet of At
lantic City's Well 13, one of the
dozen sunk in 1930.
Threat to the city
Unless something is done
quickly, Pinder said, the
chemicals will pollute the well
within two years. That one well
supplies 10 percent of Atlantic
City's fresh water in the sum
mertime.
On Thursday, Brotman, rul
ing on preliminary motions,
said the landfill's present and
former owners are partly re

sponsible for the ground water
pollution. Brotman, calling
Price's Pit "a grave hazard to
human health," nevertheless
rejected EPA attempts to have
present and former owners im
mediately pay for Atlantic
City's water study and to pro
vide a pipeline for fresh water
to the Johnson's neighbor
hood.
City officials say they are
trying to raise the $500,000
neededto laya waterlinetothe
neighborhood where 37
homes are directly affected.
Authorities say toxic chemicals
have already been found in
three private wells in the area
and trace amounts have been
found in 12 more, raising con
cern over the long —term ef
fects of the contamination.
Charles Price, who was
owner of the landfill when the
chemicals were disposed of —
a legal remedy at the time —
maintains that state Depart
ment of Environmental Protec
tion officials knew of and con
doned the dumping in the ear
ly 19705. DEP officials deny this.
"It's not my fault in the first
place, but I'm getting blamed
for it," Price said this week.
"The state sent me the stuff in
the first place."
Price maintains state en
vironmental officials directed
haulers to his landfill. But Brot
man said Thursday that the
state correctly moved on sever
al occasions to stop the dump
ing.
