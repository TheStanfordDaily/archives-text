# Greely denies plot in Cody smear
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Chicago â€” The Rev. Andrew Greeley, a
Roman Catholic priest, author and soci
ologist, disclosed Friday that his private
diaries were stolen from his "sealed
archives last summer, (and) are being used
to prove that I have engineered" a plot to
embarrass and unseat Cardinal John Cody,
head of the Roman Catholic archdiocese
of Chicago.
Word of the theft is contained in an un
usual three-page statement released by
Greeley's lawyer, Patrick O'Brien. In it the
priest denies that he was responsible for
"masterminding a plot against Cardinal
Cody," the archbishop of Chicago who is
being investigated by the Department of
Justice for allegedly diverting up to $1 mil
lion in church funds to a lifelong woman
friend.
The government probe of Cody was dis
closed by the Chicago Sun-Times two
weeks ago as the paper began to publish
results of its own 18-month-long investiga
tion of the cardinal.
Cody, 73 and ailing, is the spiritual leader
of 2.4 million Roman Catholics in the larg
est archdiocese in the United States. The
newspaper detailed allegedly improper
use of church funds by the cardinal and re
vealed details of Cody's relationship with
Helen Dolan Wilson, a lifelong friend
whom the cardinal referred toas a niece or

cousin. After the newspaper's articles
began to appear, Wilson was described by
the archdiocese as "a stepcousin" and not
a blood relative.
"I did not instigate directly or indirectly
an investigation either by the United States
attorney, the Sun-Times or any other me
dia outlet," Greeley, who is on a sabbatical
in Europe, said in the statement. "I pro
vided no evidence for any investigation."
The statement was apparently released
Friday to pre-empt the planned publica
tion of Greeley's diaries by the Chicago
Lawyer, a small monthly newspaper that
serves the city's legal community.
Rob Warden, Chicago Lawyer editor,
said Friday that he "gained legal access to
information that has led me to conclude
that Greeley was involved in a plot to get
rid of Cardinal John Cody with 'the worst
kind of public scandal.' " Warden said he
would publish that material, which in
cludes portions of Greeley's diaries, today.
The controversy surrounding Greeley,
his diaries and disclosures about Cody has
been simmering behind the scenes here
almost since the first Sun-Times dis
closures because Greely is the author of a
racy best-selling novel, The Cardinal Sins,
which was published in May.
Among the novel's characters is a fic
tional cardinal who heads the Chicago
archdiocese and who bears a striking re

semblance to both Cody as he was known
before the Sun-Times disclosures and
Cody as he was depicted by the newspaper
only two weeks ago.
Greeley is also the author of The Making
of the Popes, 1978, a behind-the-scenes
look at papal politics. The book is riddled
with material that is not favorable to Cody
and Cody has been the target of caustic
newspaper commentaries penned by
Greely.
Greeley's private diaries were allegedly
obtained by Jim Winters, managing editor
of the Notre Dame magazine while he was
researching a magazine profile on
Greeley. At the time, Greeley gave Winters
access to some materials in his files, ac
cording to O'Brien. Included were tapes
Greeley had dictated and which included
unflattering remarks about Cody and
speculation on how to influence a papal
election. The tapes were made between
1975 and 1978 when Greeley was re
searching his book on papal elections,
O'Brien said.
Later Winters attempted unsuccessfully
to sell some of the material to both the
Chicago Sun-Times and to Chicago Maga
zine. Sources said that material is the same
as that the Chicago Lawyer is planning to
publish.
Winters could not be reached for com
ment.
