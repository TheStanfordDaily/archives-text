# Orientation ’81
## Freshmen oriented to spirit on the Farm 
### Douglas Jehl 
It rained their second day on
campus — and on their third,
the football team lost its third
straight game.
But this didn't dampen the
enthusiasm of the entering
freshmen who spent the
weekend touring, listening,
and carousing in that four-day
extravaganza called Freshman
Orientation.
The purpose of the weekend
was to acquaint new students
to the University. Resident
Assistants (R ■ A ,'s) and red
shirted orientation volunteers
offered limitless attention and
from the time the freshmen
first arrived on the Farm, the
volunteers made every effort
to make the new students feel
comfortable.
If the freshmen's enthusiasm
was any measure of the
weekend, it was a great
success. Many reported they
felt that Stanford was their
home, even after they had
been here only one day.
For many, it was their first
welcome which set the tone.
Bob Stocking, a freshman from
Concord, New Hampshire, said
that he got a warm reception
from the red-shirted
orientation volunteers. "It was

great to have them at the
airport clapping as we got off
the plane," he said. "It made
Californiaseem less far away."
"It already feels like home."
Others marvelled that the
R]A]'s knew their names as they
walked through the door of
their new dorm. "It was a
surprise — even after reading
thatthe R.A.'s would know
your name," Harold Hahn, a
freshman from Los Altos, said.
Another freshman felt the
same way, "I looked around
trying to see who itwasthat
knew me already," Nancy
Knowles said. She credited her
dormmates for making herfeel
at home, saying that everyone
she had met in Branner Hall
was helpful and friendly.
Although Knowles had visited
Stanford before and stayed in
Branner, she said that she still
felt a little bit apprehensive on
the way into campus. But now,
she said, she felt better
knowing it was her own.
Campus-wide, freshmen
were happy with their new
residences — at least for the
first day. Some, especially
residents of Branner and other
freshman dorms, stressed the
friendly atmosphere and the
fact that everyone was going

through the same thing.
Others preferred their four
class dorms. Hahn,wholivesin
Cedro House in Wilbur, said
about his dorm, "It seems a
little quieter and newerthan
Branner."
Orientation activites were
diverse. Some, like placement
tests, pre-med orientation, and
meetings with advisors, were
academic in nature while
others, like campus tours and
welcoming speeches, were
designed to acquaint the
freshmen with campus life.
"They sure keep you busy!"
Hahn said. He has tried to
attend all activities because "it
seems useful — otherwise
you'd never know where
things were."
Others were lessdiligentand
didn't attend everything. "I just
go to whatever seems
interesting," Pascale Roy, a
freshman from Puerto Rico,
said. Michelle Mason said that
she didn't have time to join in
all the activities because of
cross country practice. But like
the others, she felt that the
orientation program was
worthwhile. Mason praised
President Donald Kennedy's
Thursday night speech in
Memorial Auditorium as

perhaps the best part of the
week.
But along with the
seriousness, there was
wildness.
The Stanford band marched
into the Branner lounge and
treated the freshman to nearly
half an hour of rowdiness
Thursday, the freshmen's first
night on campus. It played
again Friday after the Will
Ackerman concert for
freshmen. Residents of
Branner and Larkin — fueled
by Larkin's portable keg —
yelled back and forth (B-R-A-
N-N-E-R: what does that
spell?]]]) in the line outside the
football game on Saturday.
Saturday night was party
night as dorms either paired up
with otherdormsorthrew
their own parties for freshmen.
And yesterday's highlight:
Field Day.
Most freshmen interviewed
by the Daily said they had had a
great weekend. One wished
out loud that he could have
times like that all year.
"Wouldn't it be great if we
could go to Stanford without
going to school?"
Freshmen seemed happy,
friendly, and excited to be on
the Farm.
School starts Wednesday.

felt that Stanford was their
home, even after they had
been here only one day.
For many, it was their first
welcome which set the tone.
Bob Stocking, a freshman from
Concord, New Hampshire, said
that he got a warm reception
from the red-shirted
orientation volunteers. "It was

great to have them at the
airport clapping as we got off
the plane," he said. "It made
Californiaseem less far away."
"It already feels like home."
Others marvelled that the
R]A]'s knew their names as they
walked through the door of
their new dorm. "It was a
surprise — even after reading
thatthe R.A.'s would know
your name," Harold Hahn, a
freshman from Los Altos, said.
Another freshman felt the
same way, "I looked around
trying to see who itwasthat
knew me already," Nancy
Knowles said. She credited her
dormmates for making herfeel
at home, saying that everyone
she had met in Branner Hall
was helpful and friendly.
Although Knowles had visited
Stanford before and stayed in
Branner, she said that she still
felt a little bit apprehensive on
the way into campus. But now,
she said, she felt better
knowing it was her own.
Campus-wide, freshmen
were happy with their new
residences — at least for the
first day. Some, especially
residents of Branner and other
freshman dorms, stressed the
friendly atmosphere and the
fact that everyone was going

through the same thing.
Others preferred their four
class dorms. Hahn,wholivesin
Cedro House in Wilbur, said
about his dorm, "It seems a
little quieter and newerthan
Branner."
Orientation activites were
diverse. Some, like placement
tests, pre-med orientation, and
meetings with advisors, were
academic in nature while
others, like campus tours and
welcoming speeches, were
designed to acquaint the
freshmen with campus life.
"They sure keep you busy!"
Hahn said. He has tried to
attend all activities because "it
seems useful — otherwise
you'd never know where
things were."
Others were lessdiligentand
didn't attend everything. "I just
go to whatever seems
interesting," Pascale Roy, a
freshman from Puerto Rico,
said. Michelle Mason said that
she didn't have time to join in
all the activities because of
cross country practice. But like
the others, she felt that the
orientation program was
worthwhile. Mason praised
President Donald Kennedy's
Thursday night speech in
Memorial Auditorium as

perhaps the best part of the
week.
But along with the
seriousness, there was
wildness.
The Stanford band marched
into the Branner lounge and
treated the freshman to nearly
half an hour of rowdiness
Thursday, the freshmen's first
night on campus. It played
again Friday after the Will
Ackerman concert for
freshmen. Residents of
Branner and Larkin — fueled
by Larkin's portable keg —
yelled back and forth (B-R-A-
N-N-E-R: what does that
spell?]]]) in the line outside the
football game on Saturday.
Saturday night was party
night as dorms either paired up
with otherdormsorthrew
their own parties for freshmen.
And yesterday's highlight:
Field Day.
Most freshmen interviewed
by the Daily said they had had a
great weekend. One wished
out loud that he could have
times like that all year.
"Wouldn't it be great if we
could go to Stanford without
going to school?"
Freshmen seemed happy,
friendly, and excited to be on
the Farm.
School starts Wednesday.
