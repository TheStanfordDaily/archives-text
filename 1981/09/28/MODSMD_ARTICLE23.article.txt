# New students dance and play all day

"It's like summer camp with
beer!"
This summed up the mood at
Field Day yesterday. The last
major activity in the busy orien
tation schedule, Field Day was
a time for Stanford's new stu
dents to play hard and get to
know each other.
Field day began Sunday af
ternoon with the traditional
suprise to those not yet ac
costomed to the style of the
Stanford band. When the
LSJUMB plunged into De
Guerre pool, most of the
freshmen watched in amaze
ment.
But it was the last big bash for
the 80 orientation volunteers
and after a week of planning,
organizing, and supervising,
they were in the mood to en
joy. After a short time there was
not a dry volunteer ("red shirt"
as they called themselves) in
the area.
The frosh began to loosen up
and when the saxaphone sec

tion paraded out of the pool
and up onto the lawn, the
crowd clapped along to the
music.
When the music stopped
and the band chanted, "white
punks on dope," with the sax
aphone section shouting back
at them, the startled freshman
faces seemed to be saying
"What am I doing here?"
This feeling intensified when
the volunteers began to pick
good—looking freshman girls
out of the crowd, charge them
en masse, and heave them into
the pool.
Outside the DeGuerre com
plex numerous volleyball and
ultimate frisbee matches were
in full swing. Transfer student
Heather Millar said with a grin,
"It's hard to play voleyball with
15 people on your team."
At the urging of announcer
Corby Kessler, the human pyr
amid competition began and
the "red shirts" piled on top of
each other. Their 30.98 seconds
were impresive, but with the

crowd chanting "Freshmen!
Freshmen!" the challengers
won in a swift 15.44 seconds.
The afternoon's trivia ques
tions began with one that
stummped the crowd: "What is
President Donald Kennedy's
middle name?" One girl did
know that the organ in Memo
rial Church has 3355 pipes, but
no one knew that Stanford's
president doesn't have a
middle name.
For those who were hungry,
there were plenty of soft pret
zels and Italian ice. Orientation
Coordinator Adam Elssesser
said, "We got soft pretzels to
make the New Yorkers feel at
home."
Reactions to the afternoon,
and all of orientation, were
nothing but positive. "It's real
ly exciting!"
The efforts of the orientation
staff did not go unappreciated.
One frosh praised orientation
for being so well —or-
ganized.Freshman Marybeth
Linzmeier proclaimed, "The

Branner R] A]s are doing a great
job!"
In keeping with the spirit of
camp, 345 freshmen seated
themselves in a huge circle on
the field for the "world's larg
est game of Duck, Duck,
Goose." With all of the volun
teers duck—duck —goosing,
the circle of people running
aroung the outside quickly be
came as numerous as the ring
still seated.
When the game broke up
and the crowd headed over to
the far side of the field to pick
up their box dinners, the ex
citement temporarily sub
sided.
But as soon as the chicken,
fruit and rolls had been con
sumed, the square dancing
began.
The fun was contagous and
even those just watching on
the sides couldn't resist joining
in. With the field packed and
spirits high, the square dance
was a lively conclusion to the
afternoon.
