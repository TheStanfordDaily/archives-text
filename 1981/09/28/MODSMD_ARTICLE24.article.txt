### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
The challenge of overcom
ing loneliness and isolation can
equal that of academic pres
sure for graduate students at
Stanford. To cope with the
"lonely business" of pursuing
advanced research, President
Donald Kennedy advised an
audience of 1000 new graduate
students and their spouses Sat
urday to make friends and de
velop personal support
networks.
As part of Stanford's first
graduate orientation program,
Kennedy joined Academic
Secretary Eric Hutchinson and
Dean of Graduate Studies
Gerald Lieberman at Frost Am
phitheater in welcoming the
new students
In terms of academic sup
port, Lieberman said, "You will
never have it so good." He re
minded students to seek out
faculty interaction and make
use of a recently published
graduate guide to university
resources.
Hutchinson gave a brief his
tory of the University's aca
demic and tuition policies, em
phasizing Stanford's attempts
to achieve equality of the sexes
and higher ethnic minority en
rollment. He also acknowl
edged graduate student con
cerns about housing and finan
cial support for their work.
Graduate students who at
tended orientation activities
seemed enthusiastic about
their reception at Stanford.
Mamie Cavell, an English stu
dent, was impressed by the
number of extra-curricular ac
tivities available to students.
"I'm looking forward to a good

year," she said.
Friday morning, new gradu
ate students attended work
shops including problem solv
ing and leadership discussions
which were designed to help
them become better teaching
assistants. At the same time,
their spouses were invited to a
separate orientation about ser
vices and privileges available to
families of graduate students
here.
During the Graduate In
formation Fair held Friday af
ternoon, students and their
spouses had the opportunity to
connect with a broad range of
service organizations on cam
pus.
Graduate Student Associa
tion (GSA) President Bob
Wilson said he enjoyed the in
teraction the fair made pos
sible. He noted that depart
ments alone had been pre
viously responsible for gradu
ate student orientation, leaving
many students with the feeling
that they were alone.
Social events, including a
spaghetti dinner, Encina pub
night, picnic, and barbeque at
the l-Center. were planned to
encourage interaction among
new students. A videotape
about the transition from un
dergraduate to graduate life
was presented at the Coffee
House. According to a poll
taken there, the orientation
program was well received.
Marc Sobil, a business stu
dent, said, "They do a good job
of making you feel welcome."
The organizers of the orien
tation called the effort a
"positive development" and
seemed as pleased as the stu
dents by its success.
