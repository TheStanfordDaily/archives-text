# O'Connor sworn in
## New Supreme Court Justice has roots at Stanford 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
Sandra Day O'Connor joined her
Stanford Law School classmate Wil
liam Rehnquist Friday when she was
sworn in as a justice of the United
States Supreme Court. She is the first
woman to reach that office.
O'Connor received her A B. here
in 1949 and then enrolled in the Law
School, earning her J D. in 1952.
At the Law School, she was on the
board of editors of the Stanford Law
Review, where she met her husband
to-be, fellow editor John O'Connor.
According to a Washington Post
story in July, "The 51-year-old jurist
was third in the Stanford Law School
class in which Justice William Rehn
quist finished first." Following this as
sertion, interest arose as to who was
number two, in between the two Su
preme Court justices, and at least
three people claimed the spot.
But Law School Dean Charles
Meyers said he had "no notion" of
individual rankings within the class
and that O'Connor told him she
"never knew what her class standing
was."
She did know that she was among
the top 10 in her class of 102 students,
because she was elected to the Order
of the Coif, a national academic hon
or society comprised of the top 10
percent of each law school class.
Emeritus Professor John Hurlbut of
the Law School remembers her work
from his class on contracts and evi
dence. "I had very, very high regard
for her work. She has all the quali
fications for the job."
O'Connor was not forgotten at
Stanford after she graduated. Among
those who recommended her as the
search fora new justice intensified
were Stanford Law Dean Charles
Myers, former Stanford Professor
William Baxter, now head of the Jus
tice Department's antitrust division,
and Justice Rehnquist, one of Stan
ford Law's most eminent alumni.

When the news of O'Connor's Su
preme Court appointment was an
nounced in July President Donald
Kennedy said O'Connor was "an
outstanding Stanford student and an
outstanding trustee (from 1976 »o
1980, she served on the board). We're
very proud of her."
O'Connor's began her freshman
year here at the age of 16. A woman
with great drive, she completed a"
A B. in economics in three years in
stead of the usual four.
For her first two years she lived in
Branner Hall, and was elected vice
president of the dorm. Elaine Cook, a
fellow Brannerite said O'Connor was
"very delightful, busy and dis
ciplined, but never so much as not to
have fun."
According to Cook, "Sandy took a
heavy load. She's a person who


Sandra Day O'Connor
pushes herself and she was an ex
tremely fine student,
"I have no memories of her being
an extremely political person. She
stressed academic goals and was not
much of a campus political," Cook
said.
Despite her discipline, Cook said
O'Connor was always able to stop
and enjoy. "She loved a lot of fun and
was a very popular person. She was
never a book —worm or an egg —
head."
Noting O'Connor's self command
and outstanding powers of medita
tion, Cook said, "She is first of all a
very fine thinker. But she is also a

warm and normal woman."
According to Cook life was more
formal then. "We sort of had dates.
Sandy dated a lot and had a lot of fun.
She was very popular with the males,
and had a lot of female friends as
well."
O'Connor lived in the Union (now
Old Union) her third year and was an
officer there. Her outstanding
scholarship was recognized when
she was elected to the Cap and Gown
honor society.
O'Connor has been an active Stan
ford alumna and two of her three
sons have been Stanford students.
Scott graduated in 1979 and Jay is cur
rently a sophomore.
