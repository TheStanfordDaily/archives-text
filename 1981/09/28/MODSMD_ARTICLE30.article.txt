Solidarity works at compromise
Gdansk, Poland — Lech Walesa, leader of Po
land's independent Solidarity trade union, yester
day defended a compromise agreement with the
Communist authorities over workers' self-man
agement in industry despite a storm of criticism
from some union branches.
The issue of whether or not to endorse the com
promise formula on the appointment of directors
has split the delegates at Solidarity's national con
gress, which convened Saturday after a three
week break. Solidarity's 10-man national pre
sidium has accepted the compromise and Par
liament passed the law Friday.
During the first stage of the congress, an almost
unanimous resolution was carried demanding that
both government and Solidarity plans for self
management be put to a nationwide referendum.
Many delegates argued yesterday that Solidarity
should go ahead with organizing its own referen
dum. But it seemed likely that a clear majority
would vote to respect the compromise and call off
the planned ballot.
Walesa told the delegates that although the new
law was not perfect, the union was now in a posi
tion to make workers' self-management a reality in
Poland. He said the government would retain the
power to appoint directors in huge enterprises,
but that in small and medium-size companies the
workers would have the final say.
Walesa said Solidarity should not attempt to de
stroy the existing system since this taised the pros
pect of an even worse totalitarian state than
"It is not our role to try to overthrow the govern
ment. We must protect ourselves from ourselves,"
he said.
Moderate elected Labor leader
Brighton, England — Denis Healey, a moderate,
was re-elected deputy leader of Britain's bitterly
divided opposition Labor Party last night by a
razor-thin margin over left-winger Tony Benn.
In a runoff ballot at the party's annual con
ference, Healey received 50.4 percent of the vote
to Benn's 49.6 percent in a runoff ballot at the par
ty's annual conference.
Benn's challenge was widely regarded as a
bellwether of the 80-year-old Labor Party's future
and that of British politics.
Most parliamentarians — left, right or center —
believe that the Labor Party has been tearing itself
apart over a relatively minor election, and gaining
an extremely negative image in the public eye.
This has come at a time when the Conservative
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
appears highly susceptible to attack beause of her
tight-money policies in the midst of a recession.
Benn, a 56-year-old former energy secretary, fa
vors closing all US.military bases in Britain, unilat
eral nuclear disarmament, widespread nationaliza
tion, and abolition of the House of Lords, private
schools and private medicine.
Healey, 64, a pragmatic middle-of-the-road so
cialist, has said he would not serve in a Labor ad
ministration that expelled the American military.
Hassan sees AWACS sale as vital
Washington — American and Saudi Arabian
credibility will be damaged among friendly Arab
states if the Reagan administration's effort to sell
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)
planes to Saudi Arabia is blocked by Congress,
Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan believes.
Such a defeat for President Ronald Reagan and
by extension for the Saudi royal family "would
have an immediate impact in the region at a time of
increasing polarization" between the United
States and the Soviet Union, King Hussein's young
er brother said in an interview Friday with Wash
ington Post editors, "because it is definitely a test
in terms of global security" and America's ability to
"take steps to carry out its declarations of inten
tions on global security."
His remarks contained echoes of criticisms of
the Reagan administation's stress on a strategic mil
itary US presence in the Middle East rather than on
a peacemaking role that were made in an interview
earlier in the week in Amman by Hussein, who vis
its Washington in early November.
The remarks by the prince, who has concen
trated on national and regional economic de

velopment in recent years, also suggested that Jor
dan is turning more attention to its potential role as
an intermediary between the West and the Persian
Gulf oil-producing region as the impasse on the
West Bank continues and, in his view, grows worse,
with US military aid helping "Israel come into its
own as a power that can reshape the map in the
area."
Debt goal qualified
Washington — The precise size of the budget
deficit in 1982 is not as important, David Stockman,
director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said yesterday, as making sure "the direction of the
deficit (is) steadily down this coming year and in
subsequent years."
Administration officials expect the deficit for the
1981 fiscal year, which ends Wednesday midnight,
to be close to their mid-July estimate of $55.6
billion. Stockman, asked yesterday on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation" whether aiming fora specific
deficit figure was critical, said, "You don't have to
hit 42 or 45. The point is the direction" of the defi
cit.
With no new spending cuts or tax increases, next
year's deficit would rise by several billion dollars.
Therefore, cuts considerably smaller than $13
billion could still meet the "direction of the defi
cit" criterion.
But Stockman discounted such arithmetic, not
ing that in recent years spending has turned out to
be much higher than expected at the beginning of
a year. "As we move through the year, we're going
to find further examples of unplanned spending,
overruns, bills coming due ... And so we have to
have a margin for error in this,"he said.
Stockman letter challenged
Washington — David Stockman, five-star gener
al in the budget wars, stunned Justice Department
lawyers last month by writing a letter contradicting
their courtroom defense of military draft regis
tration. Friday, Attorney General William French
Smith sent his troops into court to repudiate Stock
man's position.
But David Landau, attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging Selec
tive Service's requirement that young men give
their Social Security numbers when registering,
said he feels the damage has been done. Stock
man's letter, he says, hurts the federal position and
should result in the government's appeal being
dropped.
And some Justice Department officials said
Stockman's July 31 letter, to Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-
Ore.) threatened to undermine potential criminal
cases against 18-year-olds who have refused to reg
ister.
In the letter, the director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget attributed the recent fall-off
in registration to a lack of publicity, rather than a
failure to comply with the law.
One Justice Department official said the draft
case episode wasn't the first time Stockman and his
counsel, Michael Horowitz, have jumped into Jus
tice Department business without telling anyone
and"been just plain wrong." Stockman "after all,
went to divinity school not law school," the official
said.
Iran pushes back Iraqi siege
Tehran — A combined attack by Iranian armed
forces yesterday broke the Iraqi encircelment of
Abadan, the oil-refining city on the disputed
Arvenrud (Shatt-al-Arab) waterway between Iraq
and Iran, Radio Tehran reported.
Some 600 Iraqi troops were killed or wounded
and more than 1500 were captured in the of
fensive, the radio broadcast said.
Iraq denied that Iranian forces had recaptured
Abadan.
A commentator for the Iraqi news agency, INA[
monitored in Beirut, said that such allegations
"only aimed at covering up defeats that the Iraqi
forces are constantly inflicting on the enemy in all
sectors."
Iraqi forces still encircle Abadan, and the "racist
and ignorant forces (Iran) will not budge an inch,"
the commentator said.
The agency did not give details of Iranian casual
ties but said Iraqi armaments were also seized, and
that this "great victory" had been celebrated in

prayers along the Khuzestan front.
SF protest greets Duarte
San Francisco — As police cleared many of some
4000 protesters from outside a hotel yesterday,
some waiters refused to serve a somewhat chaotic
luncheon party for El Salvador President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, while hecklers yelled insults at
the leader.
"Duarte assassin!" three men shouted before
they were tossed out of the dining room. The sec
ond and third hecklers who said that were briefly
mauled by the luncheon crowd before they were
rescued by police and ejected.
Reporters said the small anti-Duarte faction and
the pro-Duarte demonstrators outside the hotel
started tossing unopened cans of soda pop at one
another, and several minor injuries resulted.
Yugoslav jet hijacked to Cyprus
Larnaca, Cyprus — Three Croatian hijackers,
who surrendered after their 107 hostages escaped
during a phony fire alarm, were flown to Belgrade
Sunday aboard the Yugoslav airliner they com
mandeered hours earlier.
The hijackers were brought to Larnaca aiport in
southeastern Cyprus in handcuffs and under heavy
security by local police. They were handed over to
a seven-man delegation from Yugoslavia that flew
in from Belgrade and placed on the Boeing 727
they had forced to land here at dawn.
Cypriot authorities said they did not know
whether there were any armed guards on the
plane.
The DC-9 jet that brought the official Yugoslav
delegation had taken off a few minutes earlier for
the Yugoslav capital with the 98 passengers and
nine crewmen who twarted the hijacking.
Passengers said they used a mock fire emer
gency to shield their jump to freedom. Most of the
passengers, including the Titograde soccer team,
were believed to be Yugoslavs. One was identified
as a German, but authorities did not say whether
he was from East Germany or West Germany.
"From what we understand they (the hijackers)
just gave up to police," said a Cypriot civil aviation
spokesman, who declined to be identified.
Police said the hijackers, armed with a pistol and
a knife, were Croatians. Cyprus government of
ficials said the hijackers asked for political asylum,
but were refused.
Voting rights rule under fire
Washington — A 16-year-old civil rights law
credited for encouraging hundreds of thousands
of black and other minority citizens to register to
vote comes up fora test in the House this week.
Debate on the 1965 Voting Rights Act will begin
in the Democratic-controlled House on Wednes
day.
The law now requires nine states, most of them
in the South, and some cities and counties in 13
other states to get prior approval from the Justice
Department for any redistricting plans and elec
tion rule changes. That provision would expire
next August if not extended.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, one of the nine
states covered by the so-called pre-clearance pro
vision, has said he would support extension only it
is expanded to cover all 50 states.
Supporters of extension say that would effective
ly kill enforcement of the law because the Justice
Department lacks the resources to review election
changes by every state and local government.
The law has been extended twice, but in the
conservative climate now dominating Washing
ton, it has been criticized asan unfair intrusion into
states' rights. Critics say the South has been pun
ished enough for such discriminatory practices as
poll taxes and literacy tests.
A House Judiciary subcommittee, however, has
heard testimony that practices designed to limit
black voting still exist.
Today's weather
Chance of rain during morning. Decreasing
chance of showers during the afternoon. Clearing
trend tonight and mostly fair tomorrow. Lows in
the 50s highs in the upper 60s and 70s.

whether there were any armed guards on the
plane.
The DC-9 jet that brought the official Yugoslav
delegation had taken off a few minutes earlier for
the Yugoslav capital with the 98 passengers and
nine crewmen who twarted the hijacking.
Passengers said they used a mock fire emer
gency to shield their jump to freedom. Most of the
passengers, including the Titograde soccer team,
were believed to be Yugoslavs. One was identified
as a German, but authorities did not say whether
he was from East Germany or West Germany.
"From what we understand they (the hijackers)
just gave up to police," said a Cypriot civil aviation
spokesman, who declined to be identified.
Police said the hijackers, armed with a pistol and
a knife, were Croatians. Cyprus government of
ficials said the hijackers asked for political asylum,
but were refused.
Voting rights rule under fire
Washington — A 16-year-old civil rights law
credited for encouraging hundreds of thousands
of black and other minority citizens to register to
vote comes up fora test in the House this week.
Debate on the 1965 Voting Rights Act will begin
in the Democratic-controlled House on Wednes
day.
The law now requires nine states, most of them
in the South, and some cities and counties in 13
other states to get prior approval from the Justice
Department for any redistricting plans and elec
tion rule changes. That provision would expire
next August if not extended.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, one of the nine
states covered by the so-called pre-clearance pro
vision, has said he would support extension only it
is expanded to cover all 50 states.
Supporters of extension say that would effective
ly kill enforcement of the law because the Justice
Department lacks the resources to review election
changes by every state and local government.
The law has been extended twice, but in the
conservative climate now dominating Washing
ton, it has been criticized asan unfair intrusion into
states' rights. Critics say the South has been pun
ished enough for such discriminatory practices as
poll taxes and literacy tests.
A House Judiciary subcommittee, however, has
heard testimony that practices designed to limit
black voting still exist.

Solidarity works at compromise
Gdansk, Poland — Lech Walesa, leader of Po
land's independent Solidarity trade union, yester
day defended a compromise agreement with the
Communist authorities over workers' self-man
agement in industry despite a storm of criticism
from some union branches.
The issue of whether or not to endorse the com
promise formula on the appointment of directors
has split the delegates at Solidarity's national con
gress, which convened Saturday after a three
week break. Solidarity's 10-man national pre
sidium has accepted the compromise and Par
liament passed the law Friday.
During the first stage of the congress, an almost
unanimous resolution was carried demanding that
both government and Solidarity plans for self
management be put to a nationwide referendum.
Many delegates argued yesterday that Solidarity
should go ahead with organizing its own referen
dum. But it seemed likely that a clear majority
would vote to respect the compromise and call off
the planned ballot.
Walesa told the delegates that although the new
law was not perfect, the union was now in a posi
tion to make workers' self-management a reality in
Poland. He said the government would retain the
power to appoint directors in huge enterprises,
but that in small and medium-size companies the
workers would have the final say.
Walesa said Solidarity should not attempt to de
stroy the existing system since this taised the pros
pect of an even worse totalitarian state than
"It is not our role to try to overthrow the govern
ment. We must protect ourselves from ourselves,"
he said.
Moderate elected Labor leader
Brighton, England — Denis Healey, a moderate,
was re-elected deputy leader of Britain's bitterly
divided opposition Labor Party last night by a
razor-thin margin over left-winger Tony Benn.
In a runoff ballot at the party's annual con
ference, Healey received 50.4 percent of the vote
to Benn's 49.6 percent in a runoff ballot at the par
ty's annual conference.
Benn's challenge was widely regarded as a
bellwether of the 80-year-old Labor Party's future
and that of British politics.
Most parliamentarians — left, right or center —
believe that the Labor Party has been tearing itself
apart over a relatively minor election, and gaining
an extremely negative image in the public eye.
This has come at a time when the Conservative
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
appears highly susceptible to attack beause of her
tight-money policies in the midst of a recession.
Benn, a 56-year-old former energy secretary, fa
vors closing all US.military bases in Britain, unilat
eral nuclear disarmament, widespread nationaliza
tion, and abolition of the House of Lords, private
schools and private medicine.
Healey, 64, a pragmatic middle-of-the-road so
cialist, has said he would not serve in a Labor ad
ministration that expelled the American military.
Hassan sees AWACS sale as vital
Washington — American and Saudi Arabian
credibility will be damaged among friendly Arab
states if the Reagan administration's effort to sell
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)
planes to Saudi Arabia is blocked by Congress,
Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan believes.
Such a defeat for President Ronald Reagan and
by extension for the Saudi royal family "would
have an immediate impact in the region at a time of
increasing polarization" between the United
States and the Soviet Union, King Hussein's young
er brother said in an interview Friday with Wash
ington Post editors, "because it is definitely a test
in terms of global security" and America's ability to
"take steps to carry out its declarations of inten
tions on global security."
His remarks contained echoes of criticisms of
the Reagan administation's stress on a strategic mil
itary US presence in the Middle East rather than on
a peacemaking role that were made in an interview
earlier in the week in Amman by Hussein, who vis
its Washington in early November.
The remarks by the prince, who has concen
trated on national and regional economic de

velopment in recent years, also suggested that Jor
dan is turning more attention to its potential role as
an intermediary between the West and the Persian
Gulf oil-producing region as the impasse on the
West Bank continues and, in his view, grows worse,
with US military aid helping "Israel come into its
own as a power that can reshape the map in the
area."
Debt goal qualified
Washington — The precise size of the budget
deficit in 1982 is not as important, David Stockman,
director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said yesterday, as making sure "the direction of the
deficit (is) steadily down this coming year and in
subsequent years."
Administration officials expect the deficit for the
1981 fiscal year, which ends Wednesday midnight,
to be close to their mid-July estimate of $55.6
billion. Stockman, asked yesterday on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation" whether aiming fora specific
deficit figure was critical, said, "You don't have to
hit 42 or 45. The point is the direction" of the defi
cit.
With no new spending cuts or tax increases, next
year's deficit would rise by several billion dollars.
Therefore, cuts considerably smaller than $13
billion could still meet the "direction of the defi
cit" criterion.
But Stockman discounted such arithmetic, not
ing that in recent years spending has turned out to
be much higher than expected at the beginning of
a year. "As we move through the year, we're going
to find further examples of unplanned spending,
overruns, bills coming due ... And so we have to
have a margin for error in this,"he said.
Stockman letter challenged
Washington — David Stockman, five-star gener
al in the budget wars, stunned Justice Department
lawyers last month by writing a letter contradicting
their courtroom defense of military draft regis
tration. Friday, Attorney General William French
Smith sent his troops into court to repudiate Stock
man's position.
But David Landau, attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging Selec
tive Service's requirement that young men give
their Social Security numbers when registering,
said he feels the damage has been done. Stock
man's letter, he says, hurts the federal position and
should result in the government's appeal being
dropped.
And some Justice Department officials said
Stockman's July 31 letter, to Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-
Ore.) threatened to undermine potential criminal
cases against 18-year-olds who have refused to reg
ister.
In the letter, the director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget attributed the recent fall-off
in registration to a lack of publicity, rather than a
failure to comply with the law.
One Justice Department official said the draft
case episode wasn't the first time Stockman and his
counsel, Michael Horowitz, have jumped into Jus
tice Department business without telling anyone
and"been just plain wrong." Stockman "after all,
went to divinity school not law school," the official
said.
Iran pushes back Iraqi siege
Tehran — A combined attack by Iranian armed
forces yesterday broke the Iraqi encircelment of
Abadan, the oil-refining city on the disputed
Arvenrud (Shatt-al-Arab) waterway between Iraq
and Iran, Radio Tehran reported.
Some 600 Iraqi troops were killed or wounded
and more than 1500 were captured in the of
fensive, the radio broadcast said.
Iraq denied that Iranian forces had recaptured
Abadan.
A commentator for the Iraqi news agency, INA[
monitored in Beirut, said that such allegations
"only aimed at covering up defeats that the Iraqi
forces are constantly inflicting on the enemy in all
sectors."
Iraqi forces still encircle Abadan, and the "racist
and ignorant forces (Iran) will not budge an inch,"
the commentator said.
The agency did not give details of Iranian casual
ties but said Iraqi armaments were also seized, and
that this "great victory" had been celebrated in

prayers along the Khuzestan front.
SF protest greets Duarte
San Francisco — As police cleared many of some
4000 protesters from outside a hotel yesterday,
some waiters refused to serve a somewhat chaotic
luncheon party for El Salvador President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, while hecklers yelled insults at
the leader.
"Duarte assassin!" three men shouted before
they were tossed out of the dining room. The sec
ond and third hecklers who said that were briefly
mauled by the luncheon crowd before they were
rescued by police and ejected.
Reporters said the small anti-Duarte faction and
the pro-Duarte demonstrators outside the hotel
started tossing unopened cans of soda pop at one
another, and several minor injuries resulted.
Yugoslav jet hijacked to Cyprus
Larnaca, Cyprus — Three Croatian hijackers,
who surrendered after their 107 hostages escaped
during a phony fire alarm, were flown to Belgrade
Sunday aboard the Yugoslav airliner they com
mandeered hours earlier.
The hijackers were brought to Larnaca aiport in
southeastern Cyprus in handcuffs and under heavy
security by local police. They were handed over to
a seven-man delegation from Yugoslavia that flew
in from Belgrade and placed on the Boeing 727
they had forced to land here at dawn.
Cypriot authorities said they did not know
whether there were any armed guards on the
plane.
The DC-9 jet that brought the official Yugoslav

Iran pushes back Iraqi siege
Tehran — A combined attack by Iranian armed
forces yesterday broke the Iraqi encircelment of
Abadan, the oil-refining city on the disputed
Arvenrud (Shatt-al-Arab) waterway between Iraq
and Iran, Radio Tehran reported.
Some 600 Iraqi troops were killed or wounded
and more than 1500 were captured in the of
fensive, the radio broadcast said.
Iraq denied that Iranian forces had recaptured
Abadan.
A commentator for the Iraqi news agency, INA[
monitored in Beirut, said that such allegations
"only aimed at covering up defeats that the Iraqi
forces are constantly inflicting on the enemy in all
sectors."
Iraqi forces still encircle Abadan, and the "racist
and ignorant forces (Iran) will not budge an inch,"
the commentator said.
The agency did not give details of Iranian casual
ties but said Iraqi armaments were also seized, and
that this "great victory" had been celebrated in

prayers along the Khuzestan front.
SF protest greets Duarte
San Francisco — As police cleared many of some
4000 protesters from outside a hotel yesterday,
some waiters refused to serve a somewhat chaotic
luncheon party for El Salvador President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, while hecklers yelled insults at
the leader.
"Duarte assassin!" three men shouted before
they were tossed out of the dining room. The sec
ond and third hecklers who said that were briefly
mauled by the luncheon crowd before they were
rescued by police and ejected.
Reporters said the small anti-Duarte faction and
the pro-Duarte demonstrators outside the hotel
started tossing unopened cans of soda pop at one
another, and several minor injuries resulted.
Yugoslav jet hijacked to Cyprus
Larnaca, Cyprus — Three Croatian hijackers,
who surrendered after their 107 hostages escaped
during a phony fire alarm, were flown to Belgrade
Sunday aboard the Yugoslav airliner they com
mandeered hours earlier.
The hijackers were brought to Larnaca aiport in
southeastern Cyprus in handcuffs and under heavy
security by local police. They were handed over to
a seven-man delegation from Yugoslavia that flew
in from Belgrade and placed on the Boeing 727
they had forced to land here at dawn.
Cypriot authorities said they did not know
whether there were any armed guards on the
plane.
The DC-9 jet that brought the official Yugoslav
delegation had taken off a few minutes earlier for
the Yugoslav capital with the 98 passengers and
nine crewmen who twarted the hijacking.
Passengers said they used a mock fire emer
gency to shield their jump to freedom. Most of the
passengers, including the Titograde soccer team,
were believed to be Yugoslavs. One was identified
as a German, but authorities did not say whether
he was from East Germany or West Germany.
"From what we understand they (the hijackers)
just gave up to police," said a Cypriot civil aviation
spokesman, who declined to be identified.
Police said the hijackers, armed with a pistol and
a knife, were Croatians. Cyprus government of
ficials said the hijackers asked for political asylum,
but were refused.
Voting rights rule under fire
Washington — A 16-year-old civil rights law
credited for encouraging hundreds of thousands
of black and other minority citizens to register to
vote comes up fora test in the House this week.
Debate on the 1965 Voting Rights Act will begin
in the Democratic-controlled House on Wednes
day.
The law now requires nine states, most of them
in the South, and some cities and counties in 13
other states to get prior approval from the Justice
Department for any redistricting plans and elec
tion rule changes. That provision would expire
next August if not extended.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, one of the nine
states covered by the so-called pre-clearance pro
vision, has said he would support extension only it
is expanded to cover all 50 states.
Supporters of extension say that would effective
ly kill enforcement of the law because the Justice
Department lacks the resources to review election
changes by every state and local government.
The law has been extended twice, but in the
conservative climate now dominating Washing
ton, it has been criticized asan unfair intrusion into
states' rights. Critics say the South has been pun
ished enough for such discriminatory practices as
poll taxes and literacy tests.
A House Judiciary subcommittee, however, has
heard testimony that practices designed to limit
black voting still exist.

Solidarity works at compromise
Gdansk, Poland — Lech Walesa, leader of Po
land's independent Solidarity trade union, yester
day defended a compromise agreement with the
Communist authorities over workers' self-man
agement in industry despite a storm of criticism
from some union branches.
The issue of whether or not to endorse the com
promise formula on the appointment of directors
has split the delegates at Solidarity's national con
gress, which convened Saturday after a three
week break. Solidarity's 10-man national pre
sidium has accepted the compromise and Par
liament passed the law Friday.
During the first stage of the congress, an almost
unanimous resolution was carried demanding that
both government and Solidarity plans for self
management be put to a nationwide referendum.
Many delegates argued yesterday that Solidarity
should go ahead with organizing its own referen
dum. But it seemed likely that a clear majority
would vote to respect the compromise and call off
the planned ballot.
Walesa told the delegates that although the new
law was not perfect, the union was now in a posi
tion to make workers' self-management a reality in
Poland. He said the government would retain the
power to appoint directors in huge enterprises,
but that in small and medium-size companies the
workers would have the final say.
Walesa said Solidarity should not attempt to de
stroy the existing system since this taised the pros
pect of an even worse totalitarian state than
"It is not our role to try to overthrow the govern
ment. We must protect ourselves from ourselves,"
he said.
Moderate elected Labor leader
Brighton, England — Denis Healey, a moderate,
was re-elected deputy leader of Britain's bitterly
divided opposition Labor Party last night by a
razor-thin margin over left-winger Tony Benn.
In a runoff ballot at the party's annual con
ference, Healey received 50.4 percent of the vote
to Benn's 49.6 percent in a runoff ballot at the par
ty's annual conference.
Benn's challenge was widely regarded as a
bellwether of the 80-year-old Labor Party's future
and that of British politics.
Most parliamentarians — left, right or center —
believe that the Labor Party has been tearing itself
apart over a relatively minor election, and gaining
an extremely negative image in the public eye.
This has come at a time when the Conservative
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
appears highly susceptible to attack beause of her
tight-money policies in the midst of a recession.
Benn, a 56-year-old former energy secretary, fa
vors closing all US.military bases in Britain, unilat
eral nuclear disarmament, widespread nationaliza
tion, and abolition of the House of Lords, private
schools and private medicine.
Healey, 64, a pragmatic middle-of-the-road so
cialist, has said he would not serve in a Labor ad
ministration that expelled the American military.
Hassan sees AWACS sale as vital
Washington — American and Saudi Arabian
credibility will be damaged among friendly Arab
states if the Reagan administration's effort to sell
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)
planes to Saudi Arabia is blocked by Congress,
Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan believes.
Such a defeat for President Ronald Reagan and
by extension for the Saudi royal family "would
have an immediate impact in the region at a time of
increasing polarization" between the United
States and the Soviet Union, King Hussein's young
er brother said in an interview Friday with Wash
ington Post editors, "because it is definitely a test
in terms of global security" and America's ability to
"take steps to carry out its declarations of inten
tions on global security."
His remarks contained echoes of criticisms of
the Reagan administation's stress on a strategic mil
itary US presence in the Middle East rather than on
a peacemaking role that were made in an interview
earlier in the week in Amman by Hussein, who vis
its Washington in early November.
The remarks by the prince, who has concen
trated on national and regional economic de

velopment in recent years, also suggested that Jor
dan is turning more attention to its potential role as
an intermediary between the West and the Persian
Gulf oil-producing region as the impasse on the
West Bank continues and, in his view, grows worse,
with US military aid helping "Israel come into its
own as a power that can reshape the map in the
area."
Debt goal qualified
Washington — The precise size of the budget
deficit in 1982 is not as important, David Stockman,
director of the Office of Management and Budget,
said yesterday, as making sure "the direction of the
deficit (is) steadily down this coming year and in
subsequent years."
Administration officials expect the deficit for the
1981 fiscal year, which ends Wednesday midnight,
to be close to their mid-July estimate of $55.6
billion. Stockman, asked yesterday on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation" whether aiming fora specific
deficit figure was critical, said, "You don't have to
hit 42 or 45. The point is the direction" of the defi
cit.
With no new spending cuts or tax increases, next
year's deficit would rise by several billion dollars.
Therefore, cuts considerably smaller than $13
billion could still meet the "direction of the defi
cit" criterion.
But Stockman discounted such arithmetic, not
ing that in recent years spending has turned out to
be much higher than expected at the beginning of
a year. "As we move through the year, we're going
to find further examples of unplanned spending,
overruns, bills coming due ... And so we have to
have a margin for error in this,"he said.
Stockman letter challenged
Washington — David Stockman, five-star gener
al in the budget wars, stunned Justice Department
lawyers last month by writing a letter contradicting
their courtroom defense of military draft regis
tration. Friday, Attorney General William French
Smith sent his troops into court to repudiate Stock
man's position.
But David Landau, attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging Selec
tive Service's requirement that young men give
their Social Security numbers when registering,
said he feels the damage has been done. Stock
man's letter, he says, hurts the federal position and
should result in the government's appeal being
dropped.
And some Justice Department officials said
Stockman's July 31 letter, to Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-
Ore.) threatened to undermine potential criminal
cases against 18-year-olds who have refused to reg
ister.
In the letter, the director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget attributed the recent fall-off
in registration to a lack of publicity, rather than a
failure to comply with the law.
One Justice Department official said the draft
case episode wasn't the first time Stockman and his
counsel, Michael Horowitz, have jumped into Jus
tice Department business without telling anyone
and"been just plain wrong." Stockman "after all,
