# Stanford defense sparkles but...
## Buckeyes Artfully hand Cards their third loss 24-19 
### Mike Oneal 
What did the Cardinal defense think it was doing on
Saturday in Stanford Stadium?
Don't those guys know Stanford is not supposed to
have a good defense?
Apparently not.
Toppling any doubts of Cardinal defensive potential,
guys with names like Stubblefield, Morze and Bergren
physically dominated the OSU offensive line all day as
the Cardinals lost to the Buckeyes 24-19.
Stanford had one horrendous defensive holding call
on a fourth-and-punt play at the end of the first half
which gave Ohio State the ball back at the Stanford 41-
yard line and allowed them another chance to score.
The play definitely had its impact — it may have been
the turning point of the game — but the Carols played
spectacularly up front otherwise. In fact, Stanford might
have won the game had it not been for quarterback John
Elway's injured ankle and half-back Vincent White's
fumble in the last two drives of the game.
The Cards combined for four sacks of Ohio State quar
terback Art Schlichter, made seven tackles for lost yard
age, broke up five passes and held tailback Tim Spencer
to only 91 yards rushing. They even endeared themselves
to a home crowd which has tended to look at Stanford
dafense as they would winter quartet: one of the Farm's
necessary evils.
"It's a belief," inside linebacker Don Stubblefield said
after the game. "We believe in each other."
Tnough the loss puts Stanford in an 0-3 hole for the
season, (the Cardinal's worst start since 1960 when Jack
Curtice's team started out 0-3 and finished 0-10) it also
put the team back on the right track after its loss to San
Jose State a week before. Stanford was expected to fi
nesse its way through this matchup against a huge and
physical Ohio State team, which was ranked No. 8 na
tionally, but ended up fighting with them.
The defense allowed 364 total yards total offense to a
team famous fora brutal running attack and spirting one
of the prime Herman trophy candidates at quarterback.
The offense buckled under to the OSU rush only twice
while stacking up 395 total yards itself against the No. 11
rush defense in the nation.
The Cards lost outright to a fine Ohio State team with a
spectacular quarterback in Art Schlichter but proved
they could, in fact, play evenly and well against a top-10
national power. Head coach Paul Wiggin was happy, at
least, with that.
"Our kids tried, they really did," Wiggin' said. "We
never lost our will to win. Last week was a different story.
The way we played in the fourth quarter is my biggest
source of encouragement."
Ohio State head coach Earl Bruce continued the
praise, "Stanford is a very good football team," he
said."They have a lot of offensive weapons to throw at
you. They played well and they're well coached. They
will be trouble for any team on their schedule."

Those offensive weapons didn't didn't take full shape
until the fourth quarter when, under pressure at 6-24,
Stanford took to the air and scored two touchdowns on
Elway passes to flanker Don Lonsinger and split end Mike
Tolliver. Before that, the Stanford attack looked un
characteristically impotent, using the run ineffectually
and resorting to passes in the flat primarily to Darrin
Nelson, who broke the NCAA record for career running
back receptions Saturday.
Offensive coordinator Jim Fassel said that he meant to
establish the running game so that Ohio State would
have to bring up the defensive backs who had been
dropping back all day out of respect for Elway's arm.
"They played us soft. They dropped a lot of guys back
and we thought we could run," Fassle said.
Wiggin put it this way: "We threw the ball a little more
in the second half because we were behind. Again we
tried to establish the rush. You can second-guess me, but
if you live by that (the passing) sword, you die by that
sword."
Game plan or no game plan, the Cardinals were also
having trouble moving the ball with long passes. Much
of the problem was due to Cardinal receivers dropping
the ball. On the first play of Stanford's third possession,
Chris Dresssel couldn't get a grip on a thirty-yard Elway
strike which would have put Stanford at the 50 yard-line
and in prime position to pull ahead 10-7 early in the
game.
Tolliver missed a first down catch at the OSU five yard
line on Stanford's fourth drive which was high but could
have been snagged (though he made up for it later with
his spectacular touchdown catch.) Emile Harry couldn't
get the ball all day and Lonsinger, who was steady com
ing off the bench with an injured hamstring, watched a
two-point-conversion ball slide down the front of his
shirt after catching Stanford's last touchdown.
Defensively, the Cardinal secondary was the only area
that could be called suspect. Schlichter, who was under
extreme pressure the entire game between Stanford's
rush and a sprained ankle, still managed to pass for 240
yards and two touchdowns.
Stanford's secondary was vulnerable on short patterns
across the middle and left monolithic Ohio State tight
end Brad Dwelle open for both the touchdown recep
tions. The first was an assignment mix-up in the left cor
nerof the endzone and the second found Dwelle wide
open at the five with Card defenders five yards behind
him.
Stanford's 0-3 start is definitely a problem for the
Cardinal coaching staff who now face a Pac-10 challenge
roughly akin to World War II Saturday's game reassured
them after the San Jose State fiasco that their can play
football and they can relax just a touch. John Elway re
mains cool.
"As far as I'm concerned," the unflappable young man
said Saturday, "These are all practice games. We're defi
nitely not out of it. We've got to get ready for Arizona."

physical Ohio State team, which was ranked No. 8 na
tionally, but ended up fighting with them.
The defense allowed 364 total yards total offense to a
team famous fora brutal running attack and spirting one
of the prime Herman trophy candidates at quarterback.
The offense buckled under to the OSU rush only twice
while stacking up 395 total yards itself against the No. 11
rush defense in the nation.
The Cards lost outright to a fine Ohio State team with a
spectacular quarterback in Art Schlichter but proved
they could, in fact, play evenly and well against a top-10
national power. Head coach Paul Wiggin was happy, at
least, with that.
"Our kids tried, they really did," Wiggin' said. "We
never lost our will to win. Last week was a different story.
The way we played in the fourth quarter is my biggest
source of encouragement."
Ohio State head coach Earl Bruce continued the
praise, "Stanford is a very good football team," he
said."They have a lot of offensive weapons to throw at
you. They played well and they're well coached. They
will be trouble for any team on their schedule."

Those offensive weapons didn't didn't take full shape
until the fourth quarter when, under pressure at 6-24,
Stanford took to the air and scored two touchdowns on
Elway passes to flanker Don Lonsinger and split end Mike
Tolliver. Before that, the Stanford attack looked un
characteristically impotent, using the run ineffectually
and resorting to passes in the flat primarily to Darrin
Nelson, who broke the NCAA record for career running
back receptions Saturday.
Offensive coordinator Jim Fassel said that he meant to
establish the running game so that Ohio State would
have to bring up the defensive backs who had been
dropping back all day out of respect for Elway's arm.
"They played us soft. They dropped a lot of guys back
and we thought we could run," Fassle said.
Wiggin put it this way: "We threw the ball a little more
in the second half because we were behind. Again we
tried to establish the rush. You can second-guess me, but
if you live by that (the passing) sword, you die by that
sword."
Game plan or no game plan, the Cardinals were also
having trouble moving the ball with long passes. Much
of the problem was due to Cardinal receivers dropping
the ball. On the first play of Stanford's third possession,
Chris Dresssel couldn't get a grip on a thirty-yard Elway
strike which would have put Stanford at the 50 yard-line
and in prime position to pull ahead 10-7 early in the
game.
Tolliver missed a first down catch at the OSU five yard
line on Stanford's fourth drive which was high but could
have been snagged (though he made up for it later with
his spectacular touchdown catch.) Emile Harry couldn't
get the ball all day and Lonsinger, who was steady com
ing off the bench with an injured hamstring, watched a
two-point-conversion ball slide down the front of his
shirt after catching Stanford's last touchdown.
Defensively, the Cardinal secondary was the only area
that could be called suspect. Schlichter, who was under
extreme pressure the entire game between Stanford's
rush and a sprained ankle, still managed to pass for 240
yards and two touchdowns.
Stanford's secondary was vulnerable on short patterns
across the middle and left monolithic Ohio State tight
end Brad Dwelle open for both the touchdown recep
tions. The first was an assignment mix-up in the left cor
nerof the endzone and the second found Dwelle wide
open at the five with Card defenders five yards behind
him.
Stanford's 0-3 start is definitely a problem for the
Cardinal coaching staff who now face a Pac-10 challenge
roughly akin to World War II Saturday's game reassured
them after the San Jose State fiasco that their can play
football and they can relax just a touch. John Elway re
mains cool.
"As far as I'm concerned," the unflappable young man
said Saturday, "These are all practice games. We're defi
nitely not out of it. We've got to get ready for Arizona."

THE AGONY OF DEFEAT — Don Lonsinger, a junior split end who came off the bench Saturday to
make the Card's second touchdown reception, dropped the ball shown here and ended a chance for
the following two point conversion.
What did the Cardinal defense think it was doing on
Saturday in Stanford Stadium?
Don't those guys know Stanford is not supposed to
have a good defense?
Apparently not.
Toppling any doubts of Cardinal defensive potential,
guys with names like Stubblefield, Morze and Bergren
physically dominated the OSU offensive line all day as
the Cardinals lost to the Buckeyes 24-19.
Stanford had one horrendous defensive holding call
on a fourth-and-punt play at the end of the first half
which gave Ohio State the ball back at the Stanford 41-
yard line and allowed them another chance to score.
The play definitely had its impact — it may have been
the turning point of the game — but the Carols played
spectacularly up front otherwise. In fact, Stanford might
have won the game had it not been for quarterback John
Elway's injured ankle and half-back Vincent White's
fumble in the last two drives of the game.
The Cards combined for four sacks of Ohio State quar
terback Art Schlichter, made seven tackles for lost yard
age, broke up five passes and held tailback Tim Spencer
to only 91 yards rushing. They even endeared themselves
to a home crowd which has tended to look at Stanford
dafense as they would winter quartet: one of the Farm's
necessary evils.
"It's a belief," inside linebacker Don Stubblefield said
after the game. "We believe in each other."
Tnough the loss puts Stanford in an 0-3 hole for the
season, (the Cardinal's worst start since 1960 when Jack
Curtice's team started out 0-3 and finished 0-10) it also
put the team back on the right track after its loss to San
Jose State a week before. Stanford was expected to fi
nesse its way through this matchup against a huge and
physical Ohio State team, which was ranked No. 8 na
