## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Somewhere, lost in the hoopla of
t*he great John Elway vs. Art
Schlichter quarterback showdown,
was a football game that many peo
ple actually thought was better than
the main attraction.
No matter that Ohio State won the
game 24-19 and it was a good game,
who won the main event?
Statistically, both were equally im
pressive. Elway completed 30 of 44
for 280 yards and two touchdowns
while Schlichter hit 16 of 32 for 240
yards and two touchdowns.
Likewise, both gave gutsty per
formances hobbling along on their
respective injured ankles.
But, on the scoreboard, Schlichter
prevailed.
Ohio State stormed out to a 24-6
lead in the third quarter, but that was
it for the OSU offense the rest of the
way as a spirited Cardinal defense
jammed the middle and refused to
let Schlichter run down the clock.
The Buckeyes started out their
scoring on the ground. Aftera7-play,
47-yard drive was ignited by a 31-yard
pass from Schlichter to Gary Wil
liams, Jim Gayle plunged over from
one yard out to give Ohio State the
lead for good at 7-3.
On its next possession, Ohio State
moved the bail from its own 11-yard
line down to the Stanford 15 where
Schlichter hit Cedric Anderson for

the score. The Buckeyes were caught
for holding on the play, however,
and OSU had to settle fora 45-yard
field goal by Bob Atha.
Ohio State's most important scor
ing drive came just before the half.
The Cardinal defense held the Buck
eyes and forced them to punt, but a
holding penalty on the punt gave
Ohio State a first down. Schlichter
then completed three of four passes
for the score including his first TD
throw to Brad Dwelle from 5-yards
out.
Dwelle caught his second TD
throw late in the third quarter after a
58-yard drive highlighted by a three
for-four throwing performance by
Schlichter.
"Art (Schlichter) tired out when he
had to go the whole way," said Buck
eye Coach Earl Bruce, "but he did a
great job."
"Elway-Schlichter was really a
good matchup," Bruce continued.
"Elway threw a couple of big shots for
touchdowns — one was a foul tip and
the other was a great catch.
"But don't ever count Art
Schlichter out because he'll always
come back at you. He's a strong kid
and a real tough competitor."
Both quarterbacks were impressed
with each other.
"John (Elway) has a fine arm,"
Schlichter said, "he does a lot of
things well. They used the dump pass

well and I thought we used some
things that worked well."
Elway was less reserved in his
praise.
"He (Schlichter) is a great quarter
back," Elway said, "I could tell he was
having the same problem as I had last
week — trouble pushing off, but he is
everything that has been said about
him."
Schlichter admitted that his right
ankle bothered him.
"The ankle was really sore,"
Schlichter said, "I didn't know if I was
going to play one play or the whole
game, but I definitely played in pain
the whole way."
Despite the bad ankle, Schlichter
was forced to scramble often to avoid
a strong Stanford pass rush.
"When someone's chasing you
that's a lot bigger than you are, you
don't worry about the pain too
much," he said, "I just try and help
my team win."
Win is exactly what Ohio State has
done this year and Schlichter is look
ing forward to playing someone
besides Stanford.
"We made some mistakes today,"
Schlichter concluded, "But we've
been working hard and will keep on
going. We're 3-0, that's about as
good as you can be at this point. Now
we can get back to normal games
against normal teams that mix the
pass and the run."

Elway was less reserved in his
praise.
"He (Schlichter) is a great quarter
back," Elway said, "I could tell he was
having the same problem as I had last
week — trouble pushing off, but he is
everything that has been said about
him."
Schlichter admitted that his right
ankle bothered him.
"The ankle was really sore,"
Schlichter said, "I didn't know if I was
going to play one play or the whole
game, but I definitely played in pain
the whole way."
Despite the bad ankle, Schlichter
was forced to scramble often to avoid
a strong Stanford pass rush.
"When someone's chasing you
that's a lot bigger than you are, you
don't worry about the pain too
much," he said, "I just try and help
my team win."
Win is exactly what Ohio State has
done this year and Schlichter is look
ing forward to playing someone
besides Stanford.
"We made some mistakes today,"
Schlichter concluded, "But we've
been working hard and will keep on
going. We're 3-0, that's about as
good as you can be at this point. Now
we can get back to normal games
against normal teams that mix the
pass and the run."
