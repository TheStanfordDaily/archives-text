# Stanford defense finds 76,000 friends
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
They scratched, kicked, bit and stomped their
way into 76,000 hearts Saturday, as Stanford cel
ebrated the birth of a defense.
Accepting with raised arms the kinds of elec
trifying roars that have always been reserved for
offensive acrobatics, the Cardinal defense
jelled, shall we say, against a potentially over
powering Ohio State football team.
"I heard something today, and I don't know,
maybe they were cheering for their grand
mothers or something," said Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin. "But what I thought I heard
was cheering for the defense. And we have nev
er heard that before, never."
Using grit, anger, pure adrenaline, and bene
fiting from a could-be genius named Jack
Harbaugh, a mix and match crew of seniors and
sophomores handcuffed the No. 8 team in the
nation a total of eight times in 12 posessions.
The Buckeyes mounted their last sucessful
drive with 5:02 remaining in the third quarter
and Heisman candidate Art Schlichter capped it
with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brad
Dwelle.
The Cardinal defensethen did everything but
tie the Buckeyes up and «!ing them over their
shoulders, giving quarterback John Elway the
posession time he needed for some serious
catch-up football.
In the stands, spine-tingling pandemonium.
Previously complacent when the defense took
the field, thousands of fans were suddenly roar
ing with delight. This time, the cheering had a
different ring to it. Offensive roars are short
lived, in appreciation of some brief aerial mira
cle. These were thunderous, drawn-out affairs.
What brought on this new-found mania?

Harbaugh, the defensive coordinator. He
makes them crazy.
He screams, leaps, whoops and hollers. Un
able to contain himself, he runs halfway onto
the field to congratulate his squad. His per
formance on the sidelines in Saturday's fourth
quarter was worthy of the game ball, as he
grabbed his players in huge bear hugs as they
came to the sidelines. At one point he was
knocked backwards by a giant in red and white
who was so enthused he tried to hurdle his
coach.
In only his second season as the Cardinals de
fensive engineer, Harbaugh has brought some
Big-10 intensity to the traditionally sieve-like
squad. Defensive backfield coach at the Univer
sity of Michigan from 1973 to 1979, he made
three straight Rose Bowl appearances with the
Wolverines (1977, '78, '79). In his last year there
the squad ranked 12th in NCAA total defense.
A baseball aVid football player at Bowling
Green University, Harbaugh was drafted by the
Buffalo Bills of the old American Football
League when he graduated in 1961. Aftera short
stint there he began his coaching career on the
prep school level in Ohio.
The squad he has formed at Stanford seems to
be comprised of enthusiasm but inexperience,
try-hard but lack of man-power, a few of the old
guard to make it all hang together and a lot of
heart.
Seniors Dave Morze (inside linebacker),
Doug Rogers (tackle) and Jay Summers (outside
linebacker) emerged as the leaders by the end
of Saturday's contest, shutting down the Buck
eye running game and maintaining an almost
constant pass rush on Schlichter.
Morze led statistically with seven tackles, six
assists and one Schlichter sack. He was followed

up by a shocking sophomore named Don Stub
biefield who, at inside linebacker, had six
tackles, six assists, two Schlichter sacks, and
seemed to threaten the Buckeye quarterback
on every play. Summers had three .tackles and
five assists; Rogers had three tackles as well, and
four assists.
All intensity and adrenalin aside, the Cards
were flat outmuscled by a Buckeye tailback
named Tim Spencer and an unrelenting
Schlichter who connected when he needed to,
for 240 yards and two touchdowns. As the game
progressed, the 15-yard pass over the middle
became a more reliable third-down conversion
play for the Buckeyes than their muscle.
Out-finessing the secondary across midfield
and into scoring range three times, Ohio State
was merely unstoppable inside the 20-yard line
as Spencer and fullback Jim Gayle (replacing
Vaughn Broadnax, out with an ankle injury ear
ly in the first quarter) punched out yardage by
the two's and three's.
But Spencer was held to only 91 yards, and the
entire rushing offense to 124 yards. It was a far
cry from a game last season when a UCLA
tailback named Freeman McNeil broke away
from the line for 40 yard gains and four touch
downs in the second half (UCLA 35, Stanford
21).
"You can build on what we did out there to
day," said Wiggin after Saturday's game. "We
made some positive strides as a team. We know
we can't be the special team wc want to be
without a defense. It was an emotional, all out
effort."
Doug Rogers agreed. "We were really flying
around, doing some good things. I know it's
going to get better. It's getting better now,
week by week. I just feel it."

The Buckeyes mounted their last sucessful
drive with 5:02 remaining in the third quarter
and Heisman candidate Art Schlichter capped it
with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brad
Dwelle.
The Cardinal defensethen did everything but
tie the Buckeyes up and «!ing them over their
shoulders, giving quarterback John Elway the
posession time he needed for some serious
catch-up football.
In the stands, spine-tingling pandemonium.
Previously complacent when the defense took
the field, thousands of fans were suddenly roar
ing with delight. This time, the cheering had a
different ring to it. Offensive roars are short
lived, in appreciation of some brief aerial mira
cle. These were thunderous, drawn-out affairs.
What brought on this new-found mania?

Harbaugh, the defensive coordinator. He
makes them crazy.
He screams, leaps, whoops and hollers. Un
able to contain himself, he runs halfway onto
the field to congratulate his squad. His per
formance on the sidelines in Saturday's fourth
quarter was worthy of the game ball, as he
grabbed his players in huge bear hugs as they
came to the sidelines. At one point he was
knocked backwards by a giant in red and white
who was so enthused he tried to hurdle his
coach.
In only his second season as the Cardinals de
fensive engineer, Harbaugh has brought some
Big-10 intensity to the traditionally sieve-like
squad. Defensive backfield coach at the Univer
sity of Michigan from 1973 to 1979, he made
three straight Rose Bowl appearances with the
Wolverines (1977, '78, '79). In his last year there
the squad ranked 12th in NCAA total defense.
A baseball aVid football player at Bowling
Green University, Harbaugh was drafted by the
Buffalo Bills of the old American Football
League when he graduated in 1961. Aftera short
stint there he began his coaching career on the
prep school level in Ohio.
The squad he has formed at Stanford seems to
be comprised of enthusiasm but inexperience,
try-hard but lack of man-power, a few of the old
guard to make it all hang together and a lot of
heart.
Seniors Dave Morze (inside linebacker),
Doug Rogers (tackle) and Jay Summers (outside
linebacker) emerged as the leaders by the end
of Saturday's contest, shutting down the Buck
eye running game and maintaining an almost
constant pass rush on Schlichter.
Morze led statistically with seven tackles, six
assists and one Schlichter sack. He was followed

up by a shocking sophomore named Don Stub
biefield who, at inside linebacker, had six
tackles, six assists, two Schlichter sacks, and
seemed to threaten the Buckeye quarterback
on every play. Summers had three .tackles and
five assists; Rogers had three tackles as well, and
four assists.
All intensity and adrenalin aside, the Cards
were flat outmuscled by a Buckeye tailback
named Tim Spencer and an unrelenting
Schlichter who connected when he needed to,
for 240 yards and two touchdowns. As the game
progressed, the 15-yard pass over the middle
became a more reliable third-down conversion
play for the Buckeyes than their muscle.
Out-finessing the secondary across midfield
and into scoring range three times, Ohio State
was merely unstoppable inside the 20-yard line
as Spencer and fullback Jim Gayle (replacing
Vaughn Broadnax, out with an ankle injury ear
ly in the first quarter) punched out yardage by
the two's and three's.
But Spencer was held to only 91 yards, and the
entire rushing offense to 124 yards. It was a far
cry from a game last season when a UCLA
tailback named Freeman McNeil broke away
from the line for 40 yard gains and four touch
downs in the second half (UCLA 35, Stanford
21).
"You can build on what we did out there to
day," said Wiggin after Saturday's game. "We
made some positive strides as a team. We know
we can't be the special team wc want to be
without a defense. It was an emotional, all out
effort."
Doug Rogers agreed. "We were really flying
around, doing some good things. I know it's
going to get better. It's getting better now,
week by week. I just feel it."

They scratched, kicked, bit and stomped their
way into 76,000 hearts Saturday, as Stanford cel
ebrated the birth of a defense.
Accepting with raised arms the kinds of elec
trifying roars that have always been reserved for
offensive acrobatics, the Cardinal defense
jelled, shall we say, against a potentially over
powering Ohio State football team.
"I heard something today, and I don't know,
maybe they were cheering for their grand
mothers or something," said Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin. "But what I thought I heard
was cheering for the defense. And we have nev
er heard that before, never."
Using grit, anger, pure adrenaline, and bene
fiting from a could-be genius named Jack
Harbaugh, a mix and match crew of seniors and
sophomores handcuffed the No. 8 team in the
nation a total of eight times in 12 posessions.
The Buckeyes mounted their last sucessful
drive with 5:02 remaining in the third quarter
and Heisman candidate Art Schlichter capped it
