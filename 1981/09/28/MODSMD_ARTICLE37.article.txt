## Marcus Allen makes his own Heisman bid Trojans edge Sooners for No.1 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — John Robinson com
pared his USC football team Saturday to
Sugar Ray Leonard, a beaten fighter in the
middle rounds, who came on at the end to
stop Thomas Hearns in their recent fight.
It wasn't a bad analogy because the Tro
jans, seemingly whipped by Oklahdma's
whiplash wishbone, got up from the Col
iseum grass to win in the final two seconds.
John Mazur, the sophomore quarter
back, threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to
tight end Fred Cornwell to climax USC's
surge in the fourth quarter with a 28-24
comeback victory.
By winning, USC most likely preserved
its ranking asthe No. 1 team in the country.
Oklahoma came into the game as the na
tion's No. 2 rated team and the Sooners
were on the verge of becoming No. I.They
led, 24-14, in the fourth quarter and
seemed in control of the game.
It was another showcase game for
Marcus Allen in the tailback's quest to win
the Heisman Trophy. He rushed for 208
yards on 39 carries and scored two touch
downs. Allen has now rushed for 200 or
more yards in three consecutive games,
tying an NCAA record held by four other
running backs.

"Marcus Allen is the best tailback I've
seen play on this field," said Robinson,
who has seen such great USC runping
backs as Charlie White, Ricky Bell and An
thony Davis perform at the Coliseum.
Robinson seemed disheveled in the
locker room. He was sweating profusely
and his voice was hoarse as he said:
"Marcus said in a prayer after the game
that if God stands by us, we won't blink the
rest of the season. And I said/Amen, we're
N0.1."
This was only the 10th loss for Sooner
Coach Barry Switzer in his nine seasons at
the school. He has won 84 games and he
and Robinson, who now has a 53-8-2 rec
ord, are the winningest coaches, per
centage-wise, of any who've coached five
or more years.
Oklahoma had 10-point leads twice in
the game, 17-7, in the second quarter and
24-14 early in the fourth quarter.
But Switzer said the Sooners lost the
game in the third quarter when they
fumbled three times to the Trojans. "That
was the big difference/' he said. "If we had
hung on to the ball, it could have been a
different story."
Oklahoma, always on the move, only
had two fourth down situations in the en

tire game — one in the second quarter
when the Sooners settled fora field goal
(17-7) and late in the fourth quarter when
they were protecting a 24-21 lead and
needed to control the hall
But Mazur, who was a bit unsettled
earlier, throwing too quickly, passed to
split end Jeff Simmons, who made a tough
catch on the sideline fora 26-yard gain. A
few plays later, Mazur got another first
down by sneaking for 2 yards on fourth
and one to the Sooner 24.
Allen made a diving try, but couldn't
hold Mazur's first down pass in the flat. On
second down, Allen was open in the end
zone but Cornwell, running a delay pat
tern, inadvertently tipped the ball away
from the tailback.
But Robinson called basically the same
play from the sidelines on third down.
Once again Allen went over the middle
but he was jammed by the Oklahoma de
fense. Mazur, afforded good protection,
couldn't spot an open receiver and started
to run to the corner, but he said later he
wasn't fast enough to out-run the Oklaho
ma pursuit.
So he pulled up, just as Cornwell was
coming open in the end zone. It was only
Cornwell's second catch at USC.
