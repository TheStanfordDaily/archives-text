### James Harrow 
Men's tennis coach Dick
Gould sponsored a fundraising
tennis match at the Stanford
tennis courts September 20 to
raise money for the Stanford
Tennis Professionals Endowed
Scholarship.
The event featured exhibi
tion matches between former
Cardinal tennis greats such as
reigning Wimbledon and US
Open Champion John
McEnroe, Roscoe Tanner, and
Gene and Sandy Mayer.
Admission to the matches
was $100 per ticket. The money
will go to support the new
scoreboard and a $150,000 en
dowed scholarship.
Stanford presently has five

endowed scholarships for ten
nis players, the most allowed
by NCAA regulations.
Attendance was close to
1000. Obviously elated by the
success of the event, Gould
said he plans to hold next year's
fundraiser in Maples Pavilion.
Other Stanford players in at
tendance included Nick Sa
viano, Tim Delany, Pat Dupre,
Scott Davis, and Tim Mayotte.
Davis, presently a sophomore,
is expected to fill the No. 1 sin
gles spot for the Cardinals this
season. Mayotte, NCAA singles
champion, turned pro after his
victory at the end of last season.
The exhibition featured two
singles matches and two
doubles matches, each one set

in length.
In singles, Gene Mayer sur
prised John McEnroe 6-4, and
Tim Mayotte defeated Roscoe
Tanner 6-4.
Mayotte and Davis paired up
together for the first time ever
— even when thay were team
mates they had different part
ners — but fell to Sandy Mayer
and Saviano 8-10 in a thriller of
a tie-breaker.
The excitement didn't end
there, because in the next
match Tanner and Dupre
paired up and defeated Davis
and Delany 7-4 in yet another
tie-breaker.
Gould praised all the Stan
ford players for taking time out
of their busy schedules to play

in the exhibition.
He singled out McEnroe in
particular, saying "I have never
had a player that has cared
more about his team than
John."
Gould talked candidly about
McEnroe after the match. "He
is a perfectionist, and he can't
stand an imperfectionist," he
said.
"Mac is a genius. I never had
a more intense competitor,"
he added.
Roscoe Tanner fondly re
called his days at Stanford. "It's
the perfect place for athletes,"
he said. "It's the the best school
you can possibly find. There is a
good balance between athlet
ics and academics."
