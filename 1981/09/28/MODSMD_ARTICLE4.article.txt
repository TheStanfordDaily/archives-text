Gifts and bequests to the Univer
sity for the 1980-81 fiscal year reached
a record $79 5 million, William Kim
ball, president of the Board of
Trustees, announced earlier this
month.
This year's figure is a 32 percent in
crease over last year's $60.1 million
received.
The increase is sure to play a major
role in a budget suffering heavy cut
backs in federal financial aid and re
search grants.
Across the board increases
The University increased receipts
in allfourfund-raisingcategories: liv
ing individuals, corporations, foun
dations and bequests
Living individuals raised their gift
donations from $23 million in the
1979-80 period to more than $28 mil
lion; corporate gifts jumped from
nearly $11 million in 1979-80 to about
$14.5 million for 1980-81; founda
tions and association gifts slightly in
creased by $3 million from $19 mil
lion to $22 million; meanwhile be
quests nearly doubled, jumping from
about $7 million to $13.5 million.
Reasons for the increase vary. Of
ficials in all four areas agree, how
ever, that the increase did not result
from any unusual or special fund

raising effort during 1980-81, but rath
er is the outcome of a steady and con
tinual process.
The Kennedy fartor
Fund-raising officials also point to
factors such as the leadership of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
"Stanford's constituencies are re
sponding to the leadership of Donald
Kennedy and see him as a dynamic
leader," according to Bill Daily, di
rector for the Northern California
area Major Gifts program.
"Secondly, there is the perception
that Stanford is doing imporant
things," he added.
"Stanford is really a class product,"
lean Coblentz, field staff manager for
the Annual Fund, said.
"It's easier to sell something that is
really good than something that is
marginally good. Alumni are like ev
eryone else, they want to be attached
to a winner," she said.
Coblentz also noted that it is now
easier to generate support for the
University than "when windows
were being broken and buildings
being trashed" during the 19605.
Benefits to industry
An impressive 41 percent increase
in corporate support can be at
tributable to a number of factors, ac
cording to Bruce Hinchliffe, director
of Corporate Relations.
"Some corporations wish to
strengthen basic science and private
research institutions," he said, calling
it their "enlightened self-interest" to
support universities.
"Among other reasons, they pro
vide a flow of trained scientists, engi
neers, and MBAs," he said.
According to Hinchliffe, the Uni
versity offers "a myriad of significant
academic programs" of interest to
private industry. He cited as ex
amples the engineering, earth sci
ence, and economics departments,
along with the schools of medicine
and business.
"There has been a growing em
phasis in the corporate world on the
need to take the problem of fellow
ship support seriously," Daily said.
Attracting private funds
"It has been said in the business
world that private philanthropy has
to pick upthe gap left by government
reductions."
Stanford's Corporate Relations
Department has four field workers
who are responsible for calling on
corporations, initiating new contacts,
developing existing relationships
and working with faculty members to
help them develop their research
proposals from a marketing stand
point.
Administration officials are reluc
tant either to disclose how they solic
it funds or to give particular examples
of how donations come to the Uni
versity.
Modesty the best policy?
"There are a lot of anonymous gifts
to Stanford," according to David
Fulton, Director of Communications
and Development.
"We go to great lengths to main
tain a private relationship between
the University and its donors," he
said.
The most publicized form of solic
itinggifts is the Annual Fund,which is
a process through which all Stanford

alumni are contacted each year. This
fundraising effort is organized pri
marily by a network of more than 600
volunteers, and is divided into two
groups.
Donors who have a history of gifts
of under $250 are contacted by vol
unteers by phone, while donors with
a record of over $250 are contacted
by volunteers face-to-face.
The personal touch
The Major Gifts program is an even
more personalized approach, which
Daily described as a kind of "self-so
licitation."
He said that the program concen
trates on the awareness of potential
donors about the University and em
phasizes the importance of a special
program of interest to the individual.
He said that they "let (potential
donors) know that their gift can make
a big difference."
Both Daily and Fulton noted that
this year's $5 million increase in the
living individual contributions was
not the result of a single especially
large contribution, but rather of a
substantial number of gifts in the
$500,000 range.
Meeting University priorities
Much of the money solicited from
individuals is restricted to a particular
use, such as an endowed pro
fessorship or a fellowship within a
specified department.
As examples of important pro
grams which have been supported by
individual or corporate gifts, Daily
cited the Center for Integrated Sys
tems and the Cardiovascular Re
search Center.
"You do your damnedest to get
gifts that are going to be useful,"
Fulton said. "It's terribly important in
seeking gifts from corporations and
foundations to seek gifts that match
University priorities."
The five administrators in
terviewed declined to speculate on
the success of next year's efforts, cit
ing uncertainties such as the stock
market, tax reforms and the possi
bility of continuing high inflation.

lean Coblentz, field staff manager for
the Annual Fund, said.
"It's easier to sell something that is
really good than something that is
marginally good. Alumni are like ev
eryone else, they want to be attached
to a winner," she said.
Coblentz also noted that it is now
easier to generate support for the
University than "when windows
were being broken and buildings
being trashed" during the 19605.
Benefits to industry
An impressive 41 percent increase
in corporate support can be at
tributable to a number of factors, ac
cording to Bruce Hinchliffe, director
of Corporate Relations.
"Some corporations wish to
strengthen basic science and private
research institutions," he said, calling
it their "enlightened self-interest" to
support universities.
"Among other reasons, they pro
vide a flow of trained scientists, engi
neers, and MBAs," he said.
According to Hinchliffe, the Uni
versity offers "a myriad of significant
academic programs" of interest to
private industry. He cited as ex
amples the engineering, earth sci
ence, and economics departments,
along with the schools of medicine
and business.
"There has been a growing em
phasis in the corporate world on the
need to take the problem of fellow
ship support seriously," Daily said.
Attracting private funds
"It has been said in the business
world that private philanthropy has
to pick upthe gap left by government
reductions."
Stanford's Corporate Relations
Department has four field workers
who are responsible for calling on
corporations, initiating new contacts,
developing existing relationships
and working with faculty members to
help them develop their research
proposals from a marketing stand
point.
Administration officials are reluc
tant either to disclose how they solic
it funds or to give particular examples
of how donations come to the Uni
versity.
Modesty the best policy?
"There are a lot of anonymous gifts
to Stanford," according to David
Fulton, Director of Communications
and Development.
"We go to great lengths to main
tain a private relationship between
the University and its donors," he
said.
The most publicized form of solic
itinggifts is the Annual Fund,which is
a process through which all Stanford

alumni are contacted each year. This
fundraising effort is organized pri
marily by a network of more than 600
volunteers, and is divided into two
groups.
Donors who have a history of gifts
of under $250 are contacted by vol
unteers by phone, while donors with
a record of over $250 are contacted
by volunteers face-to-face.
The personal touch
The Major Gifts program is an even
more personalized approach, which
Daily described as a kind of "self-so
licitation."
He said that the program concen
trates on the awareness of potential
donors about the University and em
phasizes the importance of a special
program of interest to the individual.
He said that they "let (potential
donors) know that their gift can make
a big difference."
Both Daily and Fulton noted that
this year's $5 million increase in the
living individual contributions was
not the result of a single especially
large contribution, but rather of a
substantial number of gifts in the
$500,000 range.
Meeting University priorities
Much of the money solicited from
individuals is restricted to a particular
use, such as an endowed pro
fessorship or a fellowship within a
specified department.
As examples of important pro
grams which have been supported by
individual or corporate gifts, Daily
cited the Center for Integrated Sys
tems and the Cardiovascular Re
search Center.
"You do your damnedest to get
gifts that are going to be useful,"
Fulton said. "It's terribly important in
seeking gifts from corporations and
foundations to seek gifts that match
University priorities."
The five administrators in
terviewed declined to speculate on
the success of next year's efforts, cit
ing uncertainties such as the stock
market, tax reforms and the possi
bility of continuing high inflation.
Senior staff writer
Gifts and bequests to the Univer
sity for the 1980-81 fiscal year reached
a record $79 5 million, William Kim
ball, president of the Board of
Trustees, announced earlier this
month.
This year's figure is a 32 percent in
crease over last year's $60.1 million
received.
The increase is sure to play a major
role in a budget suffering heavy cut
backs in federal financial aid and re
search grants.
Across the board increases
The University increased receipts
in allfourfund-raisingcategories: liv
ing individuals, corporations, foun
dations and bequests
Living individuals raised their gift
donations from $23 million in the
1979-80 period to more than $28 mil
lion; corporate gifts jumped from
nearly $11 million in 1979-80 to about
$14.5 million for 1980-81; founda
tions and association gifts slightly in
creased by $3 million from $19 mil
lion to $22 million; meanwhile be
quests nearly doubled, jumping from
about $7 million to $13.5 million.
Reasons for the increase vary. Of
ficials in all four areas agree, how
ever, that the increase did not result
from any unusual or special fund

raising effort during 1980-81, but rath
er is the outcome of a steady and con
tinual process.
The Kennedy fartor
Fund-raising officials also point to
factors such as the leadership of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
"Stanford's constituencies are re
sponding to the leadership of Donald
Kennedy and see him as a dynamic
leader," according to Bill Daily, di
rector for the Northern California
area Major Gifts program.
"Secondly, there is the perception
that Stanford is doing imporant
things," he added.
