Gifts and bequests to the Univer
sity for the 1980-81 fiscal year reached
a record $79 5 million, William Kim
ball, president of the Board of
Trustees, announced earlier this
month.
This year's figure is a 32 percent in
crease over last year's $60.1 million
received.
The increase is sure to play a major
role in a budget suffering heavy cut
backs in federal financial aid and re
search grants.
Across the board increases
The University increased receipts

dations and bequests
Living individuals raised their gift
donations from $23 million in the
1979-80 period to more than $28 mil

nearly $11 million in 1979-80 to about
$14.5 million for 1980-81; founda

quests nearly doubled, jumping from
about $7 million to $13.5 million.

"Stanford's constituencies are re
sponding to the leadership of Donald
Kennedy and see him as a dynamic
leader," according to Bill Daily, di
rector for the Northern California
area Major Gifts program.
"Secondly, there is the perception
that Stanford is doing imporant
things," he added.
"Stanford is really a class product,"
lean Coblentz, field staff manager for
the Annual Fund, said.
"It's easier to sell something that is
really good than something that is
marginally good. Alumni are like ev
eryone else, they want to be attached
to a winner," she said.
Coblentz also noted that it is now
easier to generate support for the
University than "when windows
were being broken and buildings
being trashed" during the 19605.
Benefits to industry
An impressive 41 percent increase
in corporate support can be at
tributable to a number of factors, ac
