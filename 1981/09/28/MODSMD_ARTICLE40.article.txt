# Pastorini signs with LA, Dryer waived
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — After nine days of on
again, off-again negotiations, ana less than
a day after both sides thought talks had
broken down, the Los Angeles Rams an
nounced the signing Friday of Dan
Pastorini, the free-agent quarterback who
tried out with the club last week.
In a related move, also announced at a
press conference at the Rams' office here,
General Manager Don Klosterman said the
club, acting on legal advice, waived Fred
Dryer to make room on the 45-man roster
for Pastorini.
The later move apparently ended a
strange month of mutual acrimony be
tween Dryer and Coach Ray Malavasi, who
tried to cut the 35-year-old defensive end
after the third exhibition game but found
he couldn't because of a contract clause
which says Dryer can't be cut without his
written permission.

But the Rams, saying they're prepared to
handle any legal consequences, finally cut
him anyway, leaving Dryer as angry as ever.
The Rams, said Pastorini, 32, signed two
one-year contracts, the standard kind,
with no guarantees. No figures were re
leased.
Pastorini is also supposed to collect
$150,000 a year for the next three years,
plus another $600,000 in deferred
payments, because of his guaranteed con
tract with the Oakland Raiders, who cut
him September 1. Whether he collects in
full probably will depend in part on Al
Davis, the Raiders' managing general part
ner. Davis may not feel so generous now
that Pastorini has signed with a team the
Raiders sued as part of the NFL antitrust
trial.
What are the Rams' plans for Pastorini, a
proven NFL quarterback for nine years
(1971-1979) at Houston and a big, strong

guy with the kind of gun for an arm that the
Rams have been missing since Vince Fer
ragamo jumped to Canada?
The plans are for Pastorini to suit up but
almost certainly not play tonight in Chica
go, where the Rams play the Bears in a na
tionally televised game.
After Pastorini gets in shape and learns
the plays, well, it's anybody's guess.
Malavasi says Pat Haden, who has re
covered sufficiently from last Sunday's rib
bruises to play in Chicago, is still the No. 1
quarterback.
Said Pastorini: "I'm not coming in as a
threat to Pat Haden. I want to work with
him. I'm here to help the Rams in any ca
pacity.
The only loser, ultimately, may be
Haden, who, to nobody's surprise, wasn't
happy after Pastorini finally signed.
