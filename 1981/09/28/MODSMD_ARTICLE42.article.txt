The 1981 Super Bowl champion Oakland
Raiders were shut out for the first time in
15 years yesterday as Eddie Murray booted
three field goals and an alert Detroit spe
cial team set up a 3-yard touchdown run by
Billy Sims as the Lions posted a 16-0 de
cision.
Murray's 36-yard field goal with 11 sec
onds left in the second quarter was the
only score in the first half and the second
year kicker gave Detroit a 6-0 lead on a 39-
yarder with 7:21 left in the game.
Then Oakland rookie Malcolm Barnwell
fumbled the ensuing kickoff and Detroit's
Luther Bradley recovered on the Raiders'
3-yard line. On the first play, Sims swept
around his left end and slanted into the
end zone for the touchdown.
"We had as good a special teams per
formance as I've ever seen here or any
where," said Lions Coach Monte Clark.

"And we did it against the world cham
pions, which made it all the more mean
ingful."
The Lions' Silver Rush defense was cred
ited with six sacks.
The San Francisco 49ers, who feasted on
New Orleans' misfortunes throughout the
game, went ahead on Joe Montana's 60-
yard touchdown pass to Frecidie Solomon
in the third period and beat the Saints
21-14 yesterday.
The Saints, 1-3 this season, played down
to their form of 1980, when they posted a
1-15 National Football League record. Six
times they moved inside San Francisco's
30-yard line without collecting any points.
The Saints played without regular quar
terback Archie Manning, who has a pulled
hamstring, until the fourth quarter. When
they called on him, his second pass was in
tercepted by cornerback Ronnie Lott and
returned 26 yards for the 49ers' final touch

down.
The 49ers led 21-7 after Lott's touch
down. Manning directed an 80-yard
touchdown drive in the final minutes, hit
ting fullback Wayne Wilson on a 9-yard
scoring pass with 1:09 remaining.
New Orleans rookie Dave Wilson made
his first NFL start, and he hit wide receiver
Jeff Groth on a 24-yard touchdown pass in
the first period. Earlier, the Saints had
fumbled the ball away at the 49ers' 29 and
22.
San Francisco, 2-2, tied the score in the
second period with a 69-yard touchdown
drive, with Johnny Davis scoring on a 6-
yard run.
Solomon, who caught a 20-yard pass on
San Francisco's first touchdown drive,
made his touchdown catch in the third pe
riod at about the New Orleans' 30.
