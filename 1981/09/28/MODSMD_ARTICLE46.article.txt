# Stanford hosts int'l. order and disorder symposium
## 
### Dan Fiduccia 
Stanford recently hosted an
unprecedented international
symposium on disorder and or
der as more than 150 scholars
from the sciences and human
ities met to discuss changing
concepts which may be com
mon to all disciplines.
The three-day symposium
held on campus two weeks ago
featured three Nobel
laureates, several Stanford pro
fessors, and a distinguished au
dience, as papers were pre
sented on topics as diverse as
psychotherapy, Dante, and
neurobiology.
Ian Watt, English professor
and director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, discussed
the connections between the
sciences and humanities. Watt
noted that science became im
portant because of disorder's
force on society's hierarchy.
He said that now science is
even used to explain human af
fairs, and he attributed this to
the human need for order.
Palo Alto psychotherapost
Paul Watzlawick discussed hu
man relationships, saying that
psychologists nave realized
that "relationships have a life
and property of their own,"
which are more and different
from what people bring into
them.
The enormous mistake of the
past "was to try to reduce the
properties of the relationship
to the individual mind,"
Watzlawick said.
Nobel chemistry laureate

llya Prigogine had spoken
earlier to the symposium, and
Watzlawick cited his research
as a potential significant con
tribution to understanding
how a system can change its
own structure.
Watzlawick concluded that
"therapy brings into a system
patterns of behavior that a sys
tem can not generate from
within itself. Our knowledge of
the elements of order ana dis
order will enable us to make
further progress."
Jean-Michel Oughourlian, a
professor of neuropsychiatry at
the Sorbonne, discussed the
social role of imitation, or mim
esis. He said imitators often de
sire the same objects, so that
imitation can be the cause of
conflict and misunderstanding.
The desire to imitate, however,
"is not onlya principleof learn
ing but mostly of feedback."
Though order can social
ogically stem from disorder,
this does not happen in psy
chology, Oughourlian said.
"However, some types of
psychiatric treatment could be
interpreted as an attempt to
produce therapeutic disorder
which would generate order,"
he concluded.
Edgar Morin echoed the
theme of Oughourlian and
others concerning com
munication. Morin, director of
the French national research
agency, said "the goal of learn
ing is not to discover the
world's secret, but to have a
dialogue with the world."

French Professor Rene
Girard discussed disorder and
order in a literary and an
thropological framework.
"Mythology has been de
scribed as a passage from dis
order to order," Girard said,
pointing out that "myths them
selves create order."

'Therapy brings into a system patterns
of behavior that a system cannot
generate from within itself. Our
knowledge of the elements of order
and disorder will enable us to make
further progress.'
— Paul Watzlawick,psychotherapist

Girard reviewed the Bible
and primitive tribal rituals, ex
plaining that "subsequent
thought has always seen as its
duty to make that passage eas
ier, to facilitate the passage of
disorder to order."
Francisco Varela, a biology
professor at the University of
Chile, discussed neurobiology
as seen through the ability of
the brain to perceive color.
"The key to the logic of the
operations of the brain is as a
tangled hierarchy of surface
to-surface comparisons. We're
now only beginning to have
some idea of how to express
this explicitly," said Varela.
Varela said recent trends in
neurobiology could lead tosig
nificant changes in the concep-

tualization of how the brain
functions, so much so that sci
entists might be "moving away
from the idea of the brain as a
device which takes input in the
form of information to act."
Varela concluded that "we
can understand the world in
which we are as neither sepa-

rate nor distant, but also as one
where we have no fixed refer
ence point."
Another one of the speaklers
at the symposium was Italian
Prof. John Freccero, who re
lated the works of Dante to sci
ence and the universe.
Michel Serres, a professor of
history of science at the
Sorbonne and a visiting pro
fessor here this quarter, con
cluded the symposium.
Serres' talk, in the form of a
dream, encompassed ration
alism, history, and order.
The Department of French
and Italian and the Stanford
Humanities Center jointly
sponsored and organized the

some idea of how to express
this explicitly," said Varela.
Varela said recent trends in
neurobiology could lead tosig
nificant changes in the concep-

tualization of how the brain
functions, so much so that sci
entists might be "moving away
from the idea of the brain as a
device which takes input in the
form of information to act."
Varela concluded that "we
can understand the world in
which we are as neither sepa-

rate nor distant, but also as one
where we have no fixed refer
ence point."
Another one of the speaklers
at the symposium was Italian
Prof. John Freccero, who re
lated the works of Dante to sci
ence and the universe.
Michel Serres, a professor of
history of science at the
Sorbonne and a visiting pro
fessor here this quarter, con
cluded the symposium.
Serres' talk, in the form of a
dream, encompassed ration
alism, history, and order.
The Department of French
and Italian and the Stanford
Humanities Center jointly
sponsored and organized the
symposium.
Stanford recently hosted an
unprecedented international
symposium on disorder and or
der as more than 150 scholars
from the sciences and human
ities met to discuss changing
concepts which may be com
mon to all disciplines.
The three-day symposium
held on campus two weeks ago
featured three Nobel
laureates, several Stanford pro
fessors, and a distinguished au
dience, as papers were pre
sented on topics as diverse as
psychotherapy, Dante, and
neurobiology.
Ian Watt, English professor
and director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, discussed
the connections between the
sciences and humanities. Watt
noted that science became im
portant because of disorder's
force on society's hierarchy.
He said that now science is
even used to explain human af
fairs, and he attributed this to
the human need for order.
Palo Alto psychotherapost
Paul Watzlawick discussed hu
man relationships, saying that
psychologists nave realized
that "relationships have a life
and property of their own,"
which are more and different
from what people bring into
them.
The enormous mistake of the
past "was to try to reduce the
properties of the relationship
to the individual mind,"
Watzlawick said.
Nobel chemistry laureate

llya Prigogine had spoken
earlier to the symposium, and
Watzlawick cited his research
as a potential significant con
tribution to understanding
how a system can change its
own structure.
Watzlawick concluded that
"therapy brings into a system
patterns of behavior that a sys
tem can not generate from
within itself. Our knowledge of
the elements of order ana dis
order will enable us to make
further progress."
Jean-Michel Oughourlian, a
professor of neuropsychiatry at
the Sorbonne, discussed the
social role of imitation, or mim
esis. He said imitators often de
sire the same objects, so that
imitation can be the cause of
conflict and misunderstanding.
The desire to imitate, however,
"is not onlya principleof learn
ing but mostly of feedback."
Though order can social
ogically stem from disorder,
this does not happen in psy
chology, Oughourlian said.
"However, some types of
psychiatric treatment could be
interpreted as an attempt to
produce therapeutic disorder
which would generate order,"
he concluded.
Edgar Morin echoed the
theme of Oughourlian and
others concerning com
munication. Morin, director of
the French national research
agency, said "the goal of learn
ing is not to discover the
world's secret, but to have a
dialogue with the world."

French Professor Rene
Girard discussed disorder and
order in a literary and an
thropological framework.
"Mythology has been de
scribed as a passage from dis
order to order," Girard said,
pointing out that "myths them
selves create order."

'Therapy brings into a system patterns
of behavior that a system cannot
generate from within itself. Our
knowledge of the elements of order
and disorder will enable us to make
further progress.'
— Paul Watzlawick,psychotherapist

Girard reviewed the Bible
and primitive tribal rituals, ex
plaining that "subsequent
thought has always seen as its
duty to make that passage eas
ier, to facilitate the passage of
disorder to order."
Francisco Varela, a biology
professor at the University of
Chile, discussed neurobiology
as seen through the ability of
the brain to perceive color.
"The key to the logic of the
operations of the brain is as a
tangled hierarchy of surface
to-surface comparisons. We're
now only beginning to have
some idea of how to express
this explicitly," said Varela.
Varela said recent trends in
neurobiology could lead tosig
nificant changes in the concep-

tualization of how the brain
functions, so much so that sci
entists might be "moving away
from the idea of the brain as a
device which takes input in the
form of information to act."

can understand the world in

rate nor distant, but also as one
where we have no fixed refer
