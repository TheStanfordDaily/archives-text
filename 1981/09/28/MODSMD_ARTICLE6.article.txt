# More Israelis turn to strong religion
## 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — Uri Zohar
directed movies, had his own
TV show and moved with Tel
Aviv's bright young bohemian
set. A popular comedian, his
most famous role was a parody
of a grumpy old rabbi.
Today the 46-year-old Zohar
is a rabbi himself. On the rare
occasions when he appears on
television, he exhorts Israelis to
forsake their secular ways and
become religious.
Zohar is one of several
thousand Israelis who in recent
years have become "baalei
teshuva" — the nearest thing
Judaism has to "born-agains."
Some trace the modern
teshuva movement to 1967,
when some religious sages
read messianic overtones into
Israel's sweeping six-day vic
tory over the Arabs. It picked
up momentum after the 1973
Yom Kippur War, which some
interpreted as a warning to af
fluent Israeli society to mend
its ways and rediscover God.
Ascetic practices .
As a true Baal Teshuva, or
penitent, Zohar claims to have
undergone a total inner and
outer transformation. Instead
of shorts and T-shirts, he now
wears the black_suit and hat of
the orthodox Jew. He has a
beard and long sidecurls. He
has abandoned the studio for
the yeshiva, or religious semi
nary.
He no longer drops into his
favorite beachside restaurant
— his food must be kosher. He
cannot drive, smoke or use
electricity on the sabbath. He
cannot swim at a beach where
women go. He must at a
synagogue three times daily for
prayer. He must know the Bible
virtually by heart.
In return for observing the
Bible's 613 commandments,
Zohar is revered by his peers as
almost a saint, for no one is
considered holier than one
who has come to religion after
reveling in the fleshpots of the
temporal world.
The "born-again"
phenomenon embraces all
segments of society. Penitents
include the cream — an air
force pilot — and the dregs — a
former top drug peddler. Men
and women are penitents in
equal numbers. So are young
and old, rich and poor.
Search for values
Most have the same explana
tion: a loss of faith in the values
with which they were raised.
"In the Far East I discovered
the lie of Western material
ism," said a fighter pilot who
studies in a yeshiva six days a
week and flies missions on the
seventh. The pilot, whose
name was withheld by military
censors, says he found Judaism
after trying Zen Buddhism.
Many, like Zohar, dabbled in
drugs before embracing re
ligion. At least 25 percent of all
known penitents are estimated
to have gone through move
ments like transcendental
meditation, Jews for Jesus and
the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church.
Some report they began
their penitence abroad, where

Jewish communities are gener
ally more observant of biblical
law than in heavily secular Is
rael.
Yossi Baluzi, 30, said he be
came a penitent after attending
a synagogue service in Munich,
where he was a lonely engi
neering student. Batia Lancet,
an eminent stage actress, un
derwent her transformation af
ter a rabbi's lecture in Paris.
Church vs. state
Jeanette Aviad, a Hebrew
University sociologist, believes
the movement exposes a
weakness in Israeli secular
education. Schools, she theo
rizes, are so preoccupied with
preaching the importance of
Israel as the key to Jewish sur
vival that they fail to explain
why the survival of the Jews as a
nation is so important.
"Zionism is bankrupt," said
an army chaplain who also
could not be named because of
military regulations. "It has
often helped to destroy the old
Jewish traditions. Many of
these penitents are coming to
Judaism for the first time and
are not really penitents at all
because they never left it. It
was taken from them."
Many Israeli penitents say
they grew up in pronouncedly
Zionist, rigidly anti-religious
surroundings and now feel Zi
onism is not a potent doctrine
without religion.
The total number of pen
itents is estimated anywhere
between 3000 and 16,000 if
wives and children are in
cluded. The number is not ov
erwhelming, but a dozen
yeshivot for penitents have
opened in Jerusalem in recent
years and more exist in other
cities, often offering free food
and a bed to anyone who will
attend a sermon.
Spreading ideas
Born-again Jews often seek
out converts. Uri Zohar is a big
hit on the prison circuit. Or
thodox religious politicians
have joined the trend, extract
ing a promise fromv Prime
Minister Menachem Begin to
exempt penitents from military
reserve duty during their often
traumatic spiritual transition.
The exemptions stirred pro
test from some secular Israelis,
who suggested that anyone
could get out of a burdensome
40-day tour of duty by simply
declaring himself a penitent.
Some case histories are stun
ning in their irony.
Avraham Levy, 35, once Jeru
salem's leading drug dealer,
was paroled from prison to at
tend a yeshiva. Now in his
fourth year of studies, his re
habilitation was characterized
by his judge as "astounding."
Avraham Twitold, 26, a
former police investigator,
sometimes cross-examined
Jews arrested for throwing
rocks at cars on the Sabbath. At
a recent penitents' rally,
Twitold took the stage in the
black robe of the ultra-or
thodox to berate Israelis for
driving their cars on Saturday
and "distrubing the peace of
the Sabbath."

Church vs. state
Jeanette Aviad, a Hebrew
University sociologist, believes
the movement exposes a

education. Schools, she theo

Israel as the key to Jewish sur
vival that they fail to explain
why the survival of the Jews as a
nation is so important.
"Zionism is bankrupt," said
an army chaplain who also
could not be named because of
military regulations. "It has
often helped to destroy the old
Jewish traditions. Many of
these penitents are coming to
Judaism for the first time and
are not really penitents at all
because they never left it. It
was taken from them."
Many Israeli penitents say
they grew up in pronouncedly
Zionist, rigidly anti-religious
surroundings and now feel Zi
onism is not a potent doctrine
without religion.
The total number of pen
itents is estimated anywhere
between 3000 and 16,000 if

erwhelming, but a dozen
yeshivot for penitents have
opened in Jerusalem in recent
years and more exist in other
cities, often offering free food
and a bed to anyone who will
attend a sermon.
Spreading ideas
Born-again Jews often seek
out converts. Uri Zohar is a big
hit on the prison circuit. Or

have joined the trend, extract

Minister Menachem Begin to
exempt penitents from military
reserve duty during their often
traumatic spiritual transition.
The exemptions stirred pro
test from some secular Israelis,
who suggested that anyone
could get out of a burdensome
40-day tour of duty by simply
declaring himself a penitent.
Some case histories are stun
ning in their irony.
Avraham Levy, 35, once Jeru
salem's leading drug dealer,

Jerusalem (AP) — Uri Zohar
directed movies, had his own
TV show and moved with Tel
Aviv's bright young bohemian
set. A popular comedian, his
most famous role was a parody
of a grumpy old rabbi.
Today the 46-year-old Zohar
is a rabbi himself. On the rare
occasions when he appears on
television, he exhorts Israelis to
forsake their secular ways and
become religious.
Zohar is one of several
thousand Israelis who in recent
years have become "baalei
teshuva" — the nearest thing
Judaism has to "born-agains."
Some trace the modern
teshuva movement to 1967,
when some religious sages
read messianic overtones into
Israel's sweeping six-day vic
tory over the Arabs. It picked
up momentum after the 1973
Yom Kippur War, which some
interpreted as a warning to af
fluent Israeli society to mend
its ways and rediscover God.
Ascetic practices .
As a true Baal Teshuva, or
penitent, Zohar claims to have
undergone a total inner and
outer transformation. Instead
of shorts and T-shirts, he now
wears the black_suit and hat of
the orthodox Jew. He has a
beard and long sidecurls. He
has abandoned the studio for
the yeshiva, or religious semi
nary.
He no longer drops into his
favorite beachside restaurant
— his food must be kosher. He
cannot drive, smoke or use
electricity on the sabbath. He
cannot swim at a beach where
women go. He must at a
synagogue three times daily for
prayer. He must know the Bible
virtually by heart.
In return for observing the
Bible's 613 commandments,
Zohar is revered by his peers as
almost a saint, for no one is
considered holier than one
who has come to religion after
reveling in the fleshpots of the
temporal world.
The "born-again"
phenomenon embraces all
segments of society. Penitents
include the cream — an air
force pilot — and the dregs — a
former top drug peddler. Men
and women are penitents in
equal numbers. So are young
and old, rich and poor.
Search for values
Most have the same explana
tion: a loss of faith in the values
with which they were raised.
"In the Far East I discovered
the lie of Western material
ism," said a fighter pilot who
studies in a yeshiva six days a
week and flies missions on the
seventh. The pilot, whose
name was withheld by military
censors, says he found Judaism
after trying Zen Buddhism.
