## Latin American women making progress 
### 
by The Los Angeles Times
Buenos Aires, Argentina —
Throughout Latin America, the tradi
tional forces and attitudes that have
kept women the subservient objects
of men's wishes and whims are
changing — slowly in some places,
but changing nonetheless.
Progress is uneven, and for poor
and rural women, it is barely visible.
Still, a survey of Central and South
America and interviews with dozens
of feminist leaders indicated that
male dominance in Hispanic socie
ties basically belongs to the past.
From the time of the 16th-century
conquistadors, relations between
men and women have been gov
erned by "machismo," a code that
combined chivalry with a distorted
view of biology to relegate women
to subservience. Reinforced by the
Roman Catholic Church and the law,
machismo ultimately evolved into a
system under which females had vir
tually no rights.
"When I was a little girl," said
Angela Lanusse, an Argentine teach
er, "my mother could do nothing
more than raise children, look after
the house and stay ready to do my
father's bidding. A career was out of
the question."
But, according to statistics, a ca
reer fora woman is commonplace
now in several Latin American coun
tries. In Chile, 50 percent of the peo
ple in the professions are women.
About 20 percent of the women in
Central and South America are in
come earners. In the United States,
that figure is about 30 percent. "Ov
erall," said Saira Arias, an Argentine
women's leader, "there is total op
portunity for work if a woman is
educated and motivated."
"When I started law school 25

years ago," said Eva Chamorro, head
of the Inter-American Center for
Women in Cordoba, Argentina,
"there were very few women. Now
there is no difference ... At Na
tional University here the student
body (in law) is 50-50 and it is the
same in all the faculties."
It is not unusual to find women
doctors and dentists in Argentina,
Venezuela and Chile. In all three
countries there are female judges.
In Venezuela, according to Sonia
Sgambati, a Venezuelan criminal
court judge, "about 44 of the judges
are women." There are about 5,000
women among the nation's 13,000
lawyers, she said.
But, in 1979, a study found that
one-third of the working women in
Latin America were servants. For
these women, there is virtually no
chance to move up.
In politics, women have been a
force for years in several Latin Amer
ican countries, antedating by dec
ades advances in other areas.
Eva Peron, wife of Argentina's
longtime dictator, Juan Peron, or
ganized a women's political party as
well as groups of working women to
support her husband's regime. An
other wife of Peron , Maria Estela, or
Isabelita, as she was known, was
elected vice president and became
president when her husband died in
1974.
Bolivia, one of the least
progressive of South American
states, had a woman president, Lydia
Gueiler Tejada, fora brief time
before her administration was
ousted by a military coup in 1980.
In Venezuela, Dora Maldonado
de Falcon is governor of the state of
Trujillo, and there are a dozen wom
en members of Congress. In Argen-

Tina, Alicia Moreau de Justo has led
the Socialist Party for 15 years.
In the early 19705, women were a
major factor in the protests that led
to the military overthrow of Chile's
Marxist president, Salvador Aliende.
And more recently women played
an integral part in the revolution that
overthrew right-wing President
Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. Dur
ing the fighting, amestimated 30 per
cent of tne anti-government guer
rillas were women, and in the vic
torious Sandinista-led regime, wom
en head several key Cabinet min
istries.
Some people attribute the grow
ing importance of women in the
working world to increasing educa
tion for women and a new awareness
by men, particularly young men, of
women's rights.
A more direct reason may be in
creasing economic difficulties in
nearly all Latin American countries.
In Argentina, which has been hard
hit by seven straight years of 100 per
cent — and higher — inflation, it is
often impossible for lower- and
middle-class families to exist with
only one wage earner.
"I couldn't provide a home, a car,
vacations and education for my chil
dren on what I earn," Guillermo
Hernandez, a branch bank manager
in Buenos Aires said. "So my wife,
who was trained as a teacher, had to
work. As it turns out, she was able to
get a job with an American firm here
at nearly as much money as I make."
For middle-class women, there is
increasing opportunity to move into
better jobs.
In Caracas, one of the most suc
cessful real estate firms is headed by
a woman, Aymara de Lecours, and 38
of her 40 employees are women. A

major Caracas taxi line is run by
women. In Argentina, there are
high-ranking women in the govern
ment agencies and in cultural affairs.
However, in social relations
progress is less definite.
It is generally unacceptable in
most South American countries fora
single woman to be seen alone in
public at night. Women walking the
streets are assailed by whistles and
hisses.
Yet, there are changes. In Argen
tina, particularly in Buenos Aires, a
single woman can enter a bar alone
fora drink, or attend a movie or go to
dinner unescorted.
Christina Mucci, a successful law
yer in her late 20s, said, "Machismo
still exists here, but things have
changed. I can live alone and go out
alone and generally nobody notices,
or cares."
But equality of the sexes does not
exist.
While women are allowed to vote
in every Latin American nation, in
Paraguay, where they did not get the
franchise until 1962, the constitution
prohibits a woman president.
In Chile, Ecuador and El Salvador,
a woman legally owes her husband
obedience, and in most Latin coun
tries an unmarried woman has no
property rights even if she has lived
with a man for 20 years.
According to a survey by the Inter-
American Commission of Women —
an Organization of American States
panel — most Latin nations provide
that a man can be found guilty of
adultery, a criminal charge, only if he
is found to keep a concubine public
ly and openly. A woman, however,
can be convicted if she engages in a
one-night extramarital affair.

"I couldn't provide a home, a car,
vacations and education for my chil
dren on what I earn," Guillermo
Hernandez, a branch bank manager
in Buenos Aires said. "So my wife,
who was trained as a teacher, had to
work. As it turns out, she was able to
get a job with an American firm here
at nearly as much money as I make."
For middle-class women, there is
increasing opportunity to move into
better jobs.
In Caracas, one of the most suc
cessful real estate firms is headed by
a woman, Aymara de Lecours, and 38
of her 40 employees are women. A

major Caracas taxi line is run by
women. In Argentina, there are
high-ranking women in the govern
ment agencies and in cultural affairs.
However, in social relations
progress is less definite.
It is generally unacceptable in
most South American countries fora
single woman to be seen alone in
public at night. Women walking the
streets are assailed by whistles and
hisses.
Yet, there are changes. In Argen
tina, particularly in Buenos Aires, a
single woman can enter a bar alone
fora drink, or attend a movie or go to
dinner unescorted.
Christina Mucci, a successful law
yer in her late 20s, said, "Machismo
still exists here, but things have
changed. I can live alone and go out
alone and generally nobody notices,
or cares."
But equality of the sexes does not
exist.
While women are allowed to vote
in every Latin American nation, in
Paraguay, where they did not get the
franchise until 1962, the constitution
prohibits a woman president.
In Chile, Ecuador and El Salvador,
a woman legally owes her husband
obedience, and in most Latin coun
tries an unmarried woman has no
property rights even if she has lived
with a man for 20 years.
According to a survey by the Inter-
American Commission of Women —
an Organization of American States
panel — most Latin nations provide
that a man can be found guilty of
adultery, a criminal charge, only if he
is found to keep a concubine public
ly and openly. A woman, however,
can be convicted if she engages in a
one-night extramarital affair.

Buenos Aires, Argentina —
Throughout Latin America, the tradi
tional forces and attitudes that have
kept women the subservient objects
of men's wishes and whims are
changing — slowly in some places,
but changing nonetheless.
Progress is uneven, and for poor
and rural women, it is barely visible.
Still, a survey of Central and South
America and interviews with dozens
of feminist leaders indicated that
male dominance in Hispanic socie
ties basically belongs to the past.
From the time of the 16th-century
conquistadors, relations between
men and women have been gov
erned by "machismo," a code that
combined chivalry with a distorted
view of biology to relegate women
to subservience. Reinforced by the
Roman Catholic Church and the law,
machismo ultimately evolved into a
system under which females had vir
tually no rights.
"When I was a little girl," said
Angela Lanusse, an Argentine teach
er, "my mother could do nothing
more than raise children, look after
the house and stay ready to do my
father's bidding. A career was out of
the question."
But, according to statistics, a ca
reer fora woman is commonplace
now in several Latin American coun
tries. In Chile, 50 percent of the peo
ple in the professions are women.
About 20 percent of the women in
Central and South America are in
come earners. In the United States,
that figure is about 30 percent. "Ov
erall," said Saira Arias, an Argentine
women's leader, "there is total op
portunity for work if a woman is
educated and motivated."
"When I started law school 25

years ago," said Eva Chamorro, head
of the Inter-American Center for
Women in Cordoba, Argentina,
"there were very few women. Now
there is no difference ... At Na
tional University here the student
body (in law) is 50-50 and it is the
same in all the faculties."
It is not unusual to find women
doctors and dentists in Argentina,
Venezuela and Chile. In all three
countries there are female judges.
In Venezuela, according to Sonia
Sgambati, a Venezuelan criminal
court judge, "about 44 of the judges
are women." There are about 5,000
women among the nation's 13,000
lawyers, she said.
But, in 1979, a study found that
one-third of the working women in
Latin America were servants. For
these women, there is virtually no
chance to move up.
In politics, women have been a
force for years in several Latin Amer
ican countries, antedating by dec
ades advances in other areas.
Eva Peron, wife of Argentina's
longtime dictator, Juan Peron, or
ganized a women's political party as
well as groups of working women to
support her husband's regime. An
other wife of Peron , Maria Estela, or
Isabelita, as she was known, was
elected vice president and became
president when her husband died in
1974.
Bolivia, one of the least
progressive of South American
states, had a woman president, Lydia
Gueiler Tejada, fora brief time
before her administration was
ousted by a military coup in 1980.
In Venezuela, Dora Maldonado
de Falcon is governor of the state of
Trujillo, and there are a dozen wom
en members of Congress. In Argen-

Tina, Alicia Moreau de Justo has led
the Socialist Party for 15 years.
In the early 19705, women were a
major factor in the protests that led
to the military overthrow of Chile's
Marxist president, Salvador Aliende.
And more recently women played
an integral part in the revolution that
overthrew right-wing President
Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. Dur
ing the fighting, amestimated 30 per
cent of tne anti-government guer
rillas were women, and in the vic
torious Sandinista-led regime, wom
en head several key Cabinet min
istries.
Some people attribute the grow
ing importance of women in the
working world to increasing educa
tion for women and a new awareness
by men, particularly young men, of
women's rights.
A more direct reason may be in
creasing economic difficulties in
nearly all Latin American countries.
In Argentina, which has been hard
hit by seven straight years of 100 per
cent — and higher — inflation, it is
often impossible for lower- and
middle-class families to exist with
only one wage earner.
"I couldn't provide a home, a car,
vacations and education for my chil
dren on what I earn," Guillermo
Hernandez, a branch bank manager
