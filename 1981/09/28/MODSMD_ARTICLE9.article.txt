New Delhi, India — The U.S. decision to pro
vide Pakistan with arms raises a strong probabili
ty of war between India and Pakistan within the
next two years, a veteran Western diplomat said
last week.
The diplomat, who has served for many years
in South Asia, rated the possibility of armed con
flict between the region's only two military
powers as "slightly better than 50-50 within the
next two years."
He predicted that if war comes, it will be trig
gered by India, because "Mrs. (Prime Minister
Indira) Gandhi cannot tolerate a resurgent Paki
stan which will constitute a threat." He said he
believes that Mrs. Gandhi would have the full
support of the Indian people if she pursued such
a course.
The envoy would not agree to be identified,
even by nationality, and stressed that his remarks
were purely a personal assessment. But their sig
nificance was emphasized by their formal nature
— delivered at a lunch with Western correspon
dents — and his experience in the region.
India and Pakistan have fought three short,
bitter wars si nee they were carved out of the Brit
ish-ruled subcontinent 34 years ago. The last
war, in 1971, ended with Pakistan's crushing de
feat.
Mutual suspicion, deep-seated emotion and a
long-simmering dispute over control of Kashmir
still dominate relations between the two coun
tries.
The diplomat said the Reagan administration'
proposal to provide Pakistan with $3.2 billion in
military and economic aid and to sell it highly so
phisticated F-16 fighter-bombers to counter the
Soviet threat from neighboring Afghanistan
would effectively end nearly a decade of India's
unchallenged dominance of the subcontinent.
There is a strong probability, he said, that India
would take military action to protect its interests.
He described US plans to sell Pakistan 40 F-16s
valued at $400 million as the most troublesome
part of the American offer. "India will react by
purchasing Mirages (French fighter-bombers)
and more (Soviet) MiGs; then Pakistan will want
more, too," he predicted.
The envoy referred to what he termed the

"very worrisome" emergence of war talk by
Mrs. Gandhi and other senior Indian govern
ment officials in recent months. While this
rhetoric began before the US offer to Pakistan, it
has escalated since.
Last April, for example, Mrs. Gandhi warned a
Bombay audience of "gathering war clouds"
and later told a parliamentary committee, "the
major danger is that without anyone wanting it,
suddenly there may be a war."
In the past few months, India has rejected two
Pakistani offers to discuss mutual troop reduc
tion and easing of the growing tensions.
Although India has a significant military supe
riority over Pakistan and has made major arms
Eurchases, including a $1.6 billion deal at
argain-basement rates with the Soviet Union
last year for MiG-23 fighters and T-72 tanks, it
views the US Pakistan aid and arms package with
genuine alarm.
"The US can argue India has nothing to fear
from Pakistan, but it's very hard for foreigners to
judge India's security needs," the diplomat said.
He said the Reagan administration's policy
aimed at increasing the stability bf South Asia
against a Soviet threat could end up triggering a
war. However, the ultimate blame for any such
conflici, he said, would lie with the Soviet
Union, whose invasion of Afghanistan led to the
decision to rearm Pakistan.
The diplomat said he doubts that Pakistan's at
tempt to develop a nuclear device would be a
prime instigator in any Indian attack. However
destruction of Pakistani nuclear installations
would be "an important side benefit" to India of
such an attack, he said.
Negotiations between the United States and
the Soviet Union to defuse the Afghan crisis
would be one of the best ways to end the threat
of war, he said.
The diplomat described Indian dominance of
South Asia as "natural," comparing it to the in
herent dominance of the United States in North
America. „
India, with nearly 700 million people, is rough
ly eight times the size of either Pakistan or Bang
ladesh, the other two populous nations of the
region.

views the US Pakistan aid and arms package with
genuine alarm.
"The US can argue India has nothing to fear
from Pakistan, but it's very hard for foreigners to
judge India's security needs," the diplomat said.
He said the Reagan administration's policy
aimed at increasing the stability bf South Asia
against a Soviet threat could end up triggering a
war. However, the ultimate blame for any such
conflici, he said, would lie with the Soviet
Union, whose invasion of Afghanistan led to the
decision to rearm Pakistan.
The diplomat said he doubts that Pakistan's at
tempt to develop a nuclear device would be a
prime instigator in any Indian attack. However
destruction of Pakistani nuclear installations
would be "an important side benefit" to India of
such an attack, he said.
Negotiations between the United States and
the Soviet Union to defuse the Afghan crisis
would be one of the best ways to end the threat
of war, he said.
The diplomat described Indian dominance of
South Asia as "natural," comparing it to the in
herent dominance of the United States in North
America. „
India, with nearly 700 million people, is rough
ly eight times the size of either Pakistan or Bang
ladesh, the other two populous nations of the
region.
