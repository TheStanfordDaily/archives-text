Peking — The Chinese
armed forces have just com
pleted one of their largest war
games since the Communist
regime came to power, re
portedly testing new tactics
and new military formations.
More than 200,000 troops
were involved in the ma
neuvers under the command
of Gen. Yang Dezhi, the chief
of staff of the People's Liber
ation Army, according to in
formed Western military
sources here.
The official New China News

man of the Communist Party
and chair man of its Military Af
fairs Commission. Deng and
most of the country's political
and military leadership ob
served the exercises.

commanders and assembled

troops on the army's mod
ernization, the country's pres
ent political situation and the
need for the military's obe
dience to party directives, ac
cording to Chinese sources.
They said the maneuvers
were meant to demonstrate
that military modernization re
quires not only sophisticated
weapons but also different
strategic concepts arid tactics
than the Chinese army em
ployed under the late Chair
man! Mao Tse-tung.
A major aim of the ma
neuvers was to test the meas
ures taken over the last two
years to improve coordination
among infantry, armored, artil
lery and air units in combined
operations — a long-standing
weakness that became critical
ly apparent during China's
border war with Vietnam in
early 1979.
The maneuvers were held in
the Zhangjiakou area about 125
miles northwest of Peking. The
surrounding Peking Military
Region borders on the Soviet
Union and Mongolia, where an
estimated 60,000 to 70,000 Sovi
et troops are based.
