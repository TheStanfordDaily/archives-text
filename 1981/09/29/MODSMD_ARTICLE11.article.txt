### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer

political science here, was inaugurated president of
Wellesley College Sept. 18 — her birthday. She left
Stanford in July and has since spent "a busv two
months" refamiliarizing herself with Wellesley,
where she completed her own undergraduate work
in political science.
"She's wonderfull We didn't realize how lucky we
were, but we're certainly glad to have her here," said
Anne O'Sullivan from Wellesley's office of media re
lations.
"All members of the college community have i <en
to her tremendously,"O'Sullivan said.
Keohane said she has spent most of the last two
months "getting to know the place again." She has
been meeting and talking with staff, faculty, the Board
of Trustees and, since September, with students.
"It's very exciting here." Keohane said. "There's a
lot of tradition and potential for change. It's a very
participatory place."
She said that one of her goals was to encourage the
involvement of the whole community in all important
changes and decisions. "It's not as if it's me coming in
with an agenda." Keohane said.
The inauguration's warmth, enthusiasm, and sense
of community bode well for student and faculty in

volvement with the new administration. Activities
and events celebrating her inauguration ran through
out the week, including lectures, concerts, formal
banauets, and even a jogging outing.
"Tnere was a sense of a family gathering," said Eng
lish Prof, and Acting Dean of Undergraduate Studies

'She's wonderful! We didn't
realize how lucky we were, but
we're certainly glad to have her
here. All members of the college
community have taken to her
tremendously/

Diane Middlebrook, who represented Stanford at the
inauguration. Middlebrook said there was a tone of
both "formality and intimacy."
"The was great jubilation and celebration," said
O'Sullivan. She saia the inauguaration itself was quite
colorful, with the faculty ana seniors dressed in their

academic robes.
The ceremony was held outside in the Academic
Quad. "Someone made an enormous banner out of
wrapping paper which read, 'Congratulations and
Happy Birthday Nanl' " O'Sullivan said.
Her husband Robert Keohane, formerly the chair
person of Stanford's political science department, at
tended the ceremony as Harvard's representative.
Currently, he is a professor at Brandeis and a fellow at
the Harvard University Center for International Af
fairs.
In her inaugural address Keohane stressed goals for
both society and academic institutions. "Our tools of
measurement and memory and control are powerful
beyond the imagination of out predecessors, and ex
tended every moment. No liberal aers college worthy
of the name can ignore such challenges today," she
said.
At a celebration dinner, Middlebrook offered a
toast to the Keohanes in Stanford's name. She said: "
Though we will continue to miss them at Stanford, we
recognize their move East as an enlargement of their
horizons which they richly deserve.
In their honor, she quoted the following poem by
Emily Dickenson: "Except the smaller size/ No lives
are round/ These hurry to a sphere/ And show and
end/ The larger slower grow/ And later hang/ The
Summers of Hesperides/ Are long."
