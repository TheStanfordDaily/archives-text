# Lining up at registration week... again
## 
### Diane Johnson 
Reg week has returned for
yet another year and everyone
knows what that means . ..
lines! Yes, lines to pay checks,
lines to sign lists, lines to buy
books, lines to enter the book
store, and lines to wait in lines.
However, this week is not in
dicative of the rest of the Stan
ford year. It is a week with its
own personality; a time when
cobwebs are cleared from last

year's stored goods, new faces
are met, names often for
gotten. And in only a short
time, that lonely, dismal room
will be transformed into a place
called home.
If only we can survive today,
many feel, we will have con
quered the most formidable
task of all. No more paging and
repaging through course
catalogs, choosing and re

choosing classes, and buying
and returning books. In only a
matter of days, that empty PJO]
box will seem to put on a smile
as the family mourns your
absence. The phone may even
ring now and then (itshould af
ter a $60 deposit). Roommates
names will soon become old
hat, just as your nerves become
short-wired and your good
reputation becomes short
lived.

Orientation week, theantici
patory time for all new stu
dents, is coming to a close â€” all
to the welcoming of early
morning classes and trips to
Green library. But that's hot all.
There are football games and
fro-yo runs, noon concerts,
and parties to boot.
And the best part of all. .. an
end to those lines!
