Adolescence is often a time of
myths dispelled. During this time we
discover that our fairy tales and ad
venture stories led us astray: good
does not always follow good people,
bad guys sometimes escape in the
end and, perhaps most importantly,
few people in tnis world are purely
good or purely evil.
As a nation, the United States also
endured the necessary trauma of
watching white knights fall from
grace. During the '60s we saw the mil
itary committed to the eradication of
communism in Vietnam: acausewith
little chance of success and dubious

'With the election of Ronald Reagan,

adventures of childhood/

moral justification. Yet out of the
blood of American soldiers rose a
new consciousness. No longer would
Americans believe the Manichean lie
of virginal, white capitalism and
heinous, black communism.
But recognition does not always
act as the harbinger of total change.
With the election of Ronald Reagan,
the United States chose a president
who still believes the fairy tales and
adventures of childhood. For Presi
dent Reagan, the Vietnam War was a
"noble cause" and all the world's
geopolitical troubles stem from Sovi
et expansionist goals. President Rea
gan's myopia is vintage Cold War; it is

the same simplistic belief that embit
tered or destroyed such American
geniuses as Paul Robeson and Lillian
Hellman while condemning
thousands of young men to death in
the jungles of Indochina.
Reagan's anachronistic insistence
that Soviet communism generates all
global problems permeates his for
eign policy and much of his domestic
policy as well. Abandoning his
beloved conservative economics
that, in purest form, would require
reductions in all levels of govern
ment, the President proposes gar
gantuan increases in the bloated, in-

efficient Defense Department. He ra
tionalizes the increase as a necessary
balance to new Soviet military
buildups.
Reagan's fantasyland outlook per
meates his entire foreign policy. El
Salvador would sleep peacefully in
the arms of its benevolent, if slightly
repressive leaders were it not for So
viet-backed Cuban intervention.
Southwest Africa broils in the heat of
Soviet mineral lust. Reagan honestly
believes that the Soviets cause most
hot spots, ignoring the increasingly
independent resource policy of trie
Third World.
His obsession with the Soviet bully

boy blinds him to important prob
lems of world class division and pov
erty that would eventually inflame
many regions with nary a Russian ad
visor or imported AK-47.
An example of such a region, El
Salvador, suffers under a repressive
regime armed with American weap
ons. The administration transfers
these weapons and provides advisors
for El Salvador's military to balance
supposed Cuban support for rebel
forces. President Reagan ignores the
complex politics of Latin America:
the patron system, the tradition of
peasant repression that dates back
300 years, and the rights of every per
son killed by an American bullet in El
Salvador.
Most tragically, Reagan's red
boogevman foreign policy eschews
the rignt for the expedient. There is a
right side in El Salvador. It is not the
side of Communist-backed
mercenaries, nor of the op
portunistic, exploitive ruling fami
lies. It is the side of the oppressed ma
jority that might be supported by the
United States if Reaean would re
move his blinders and leave the '50s
behind.
By counterpunching the hidden
Soviets, we act no more rightly than
the Russians and often place
ourselves in untenable positions.
Our modern world is a place that can
no longer be divided into red and
red, white, and blue. The lesson was
taught during the myth-killing '60s.
Reagan should have learned it then;
let us hope he learns it now.
