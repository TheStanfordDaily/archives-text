## Politics shadow foreign service posts 
### 
About one of every three of our ambassadorships to
foreign countries is filled by a political appointee. Some
of these appointees are clearly not as competent as the
trained career senior foreign service officers (FSOs). This
continuing practice casts a considerable shadow over
the personnel selection process at the top of the foreign
service of the United States.
There is justification for naming some highly qualified
ambassadors from outside the service. They can be par
ticularly effective if their special expertise is intimately
related to the country to which assigned or if
they are personally close to the president and have his
confidence. But the number of potential candidates for
ambassadorships from outside the service who are really
oustanding and who are available is likely to be small at
any given time.
Moreover, the morale of the many career officers who
aspire to be ambassadors, and who believe themselves to
be as well or better qualified than the usual political ap
pointee, suffers seriously when they see less capable
people appointed from the outside to positions they
know they can handle better, and for which they have
spent a lifetime of preparation. All things considered,
perhaps 10 percent would be a reasonable proportion of
ambassadorships to be allocated to political appointees
rather than the current 30 percent or so. Some past polit
ical appointees have been classic Ugly Americans. There
was, for example, the appointee of a Democratic admin
istration who wrote top-secret telegrams based on
quotes from an English-language newspaper from a
neighboring country because he did not know the lan
guage of his host country. And there was the appointee
of a Republican administration, whose greatest con
tribution was a series of ideas for improving the ad
vertisements of one United States firm in the country
where he was assigned.
There may be fewer of this type now. However, al
though President Jimmy Carter early in his term of office
declared to ensure the reverse, the auality
of his politidafappointees was not universally high, and
the number was too large. The same is the case under
President Ronald Reagan.
The problem of selection at the top of the Foreign Ser
vice does not end with the undue number of political ap
pointees and the questionable quality of some of them.
There also should be improvement in the selection of
ambassadors from within the service. This problem has

two principal facets. One is a matter of undue expecta
tions. The other is the question of what are the most im
portant criteria for ambassadorial appointees.
There was a tendency in the past to give every entering
FSO the idea that he might become an ambassador. This
was clearly a delusion, not only because so few am
bassadorial positions were available, but because some
functions in the career do not prepare an officer to be an
ambassador. The result was undue pressure on man
agement to name ambassadors from all functional cate
gories of the service and a sense of frustration for many
FSOs.
The answer to this problem is simply greater frankness,
and I am glad to note that most beginning officers are
now told that they will not advance beyond the class
three level, equivalent to colonel in military rank. As it
becomes better understood within the foreign service
that achieving this level is a considerable accomplish
ment, and would be viewed as such by most outsiae ob
servers, the morale of the service in this regard should
improve.
If few foreign service officers can expect to become
ambassadors even though they enter the service under
highly competitive circumstances, what special qualities
should those who reach the top possess? I would em
phasize four, in order of importance:
— ability to develop relations of confidence with the
official and private leaders of the country to which they
are assigned;
— analytical and judgmental capability in the political,
political-military, and economic spheres;
— balance and integrity under pressure; and
— management talent.
The first quality is the most necessary one, and is not
sufficiently recognized by those who decide on
amassadorships, who tend to rank bureaucratic or politi
cal considerations too high. It is forgotten that the princi
pal job of an ambassador is to deal effectively on substan
tive matters with the leaders of the country to which he is
assigned. In developing relations of confidence at the
top, no one can really substitute for the ambassador ex
cept the highest officials from Washington. Ideally, of
course, the ambassador should be strong in ail four re
spects.
