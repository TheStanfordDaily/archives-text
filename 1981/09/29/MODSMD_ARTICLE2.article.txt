# Colleges, industries splice new DNA license
## 
### Michael Sweeney 
In what may be the first step
toward widespread licensing of apat
ent jointly controlled by Stanford
and UC-San Francisco, two pharma
ceutical and health firms will soon be
using a recombinant DNA technique
developed by researchers at the re
spective universities.
Green Cross of Japan and Smith-
Kline of Philadelphia have signed
licensing agreements covering a
basic gene-splicing and cloning
method invented by Stanford's Dr.
Stanley Cohen and Dr. Herbert Boyer
of UC-San Francisco.
The patent will be administered
through the Stanford University Of
fice of Technology and Licensing,
with the royalties to be split between
the schools. An extra fraction of the
royalties will come to Stanford to pay
for administrative costs.
"There is no precedent for a
license of this bredth," explained
Neils Reimer of the Office of Tech
nology and Licensing here. "This is
an unusual situation as the patent un
derlies a whole new industry."
According to Reimer, the patent
may prove to be basic to the produc
tion of scores of products in the
health, petroleum, agricultural and
pharmaceutical industries.
$10,000 fee
The licensing agreement calls for
an initial $10,000 sign-up fee and an
additional $10,000 annual fee. Re
imer said his office hopes to get as
many as 30 or 40 companies to sign a
licensing agreement and called the
potential for royalties "unlimited,"
depending on wnat products are de
veloped through the procedure and
how marketable those products
prove to be.

The patent gives the University
theright to prevent corporations or
private individuals from using the re
search findings of Cohen and Boyer.
However, it is still up to the Univer
sity to enforce the patent, therefore
in order to induce companies to sign
the license as quickly as possible, tne
University has arranged a special
credit agreement.
"The more firms we have licensed
the more other firms will tend to sign
up with us," Reimer said.
The credit clause allows corpo
rations to use five times the money
spent on the basic fees toward pos
sible royalties if they sign on before

Barnes, also of the OTL
That means that five times the
$10,000 sign-up fee and the annual
$10,000 fee can be used toward the

Blueprint
beginning^

The basic research for the gene
cloning process began in November
of 1972 with a collaboration between
Drs. Cohen and Boyer. The combin
ing of genes from different sources
allowed scientists to construct and
clone DNA molecules — a part of
each cell that contains what scientists
consider the organism's genetic
"blueprint".

The process developed involves
transplanting DNA segments from
cells in one organism to a host micro
organism. Through the influence of
the gene fragment — part of the DNA
strand determining a particular char
acteristic — the host cell is made to
express the desired characteristic
and can be used to produce a particu
lar chemical or protein.
In the medical field, researchers
are experimenting with methods of
producing human insulin, hormones
and interferon which may be effec
tive in the treatment of cancer.
Scientists are hopeful that they will
be able to produce chemicals other
wise not available or available only in
trace quantities, in mass quantities,
through the use of these biological
assembly lines.
As the range of products possible
to produce depends on which frag
ment is spliced into the host cell, the
list may be endless.

royalties if after a product is pro
duced it begins to accumulate them,
Barnes said. However, only one half
of the royalties can be paid through
the credit and once royalties begin to
be produced the credit ceases to ac
cumulate.

Reimers noted that the right of the
universities to patent the research
could be challenged in court.
"There have been some rumors of
challenge to the patent, but so far
they are simply rumors. The structure
that we have set up is such that I
doubt anyone would challenge the
patent." Because the licenses are
non-exclusive and because of the fa
vorable credit clause and relatively
low sign-up fees, Reimer added that
he expected no challenge to the pat
ent.
Original research
The initial research of Cohen and
Boyer were funded partly by the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH) that is
now part of the Department of
Health and Human Services, the
American Cancer Society and the Na
tional Science Foundation.
Under the terms of the licensing
agreement, the companies must ex
press their intention to follow the
biological containment guidelines
previously drawn up by the NIH for
recombinant DNA research. Accord
ing to administrators, though, the
guidelines themselves are lax.
In the past industries conducting
their own research have voluntarily
followed the guidelines, but there
remains no agency within the gov
ernment bureaucracy or at the uni
versity that is set up to act as a watch
dog and enforce the guidelines.
"We initially worded the agree
ment so that the companies would
have to sign on with the NIH but the
NIH does not want to be a regulatory
agency," Reimer said.
But according to Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig,
rarely do the dangers of an industrial
or biological product prevent its ap
plication to beneficial purposes. He
did admit, though, that there was no
university agency to ensure that the
usual guidelines will remain in effect.
Dissemination
Researcher Cohen initially had to
be persuaded that his discoveries
would be patented, according to Re
imer. Apparently Cohen was afraid
that a patent would inhibit the dis
semination of his ideas. Reimer per
suaded him that the opposite is often
the case.
The non-exclusivity nature of the
patent insures that that the informa

things, newly created office space for
