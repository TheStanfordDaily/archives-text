## ACLU: activism oversteps Ideology 
### 
A few weeks ago, I received in the
mail an invitation to join the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union "in time to
celebrate our 60th anniversary." I
have thought about it long and hard.
I used to be an active member. I still
would like to be — but I cannot.
My own decision will not matter
very much to the ACLU. Noorganiza
tion can please everyone. But to me,
the loss of the ACLU as a personal
commitment has been like losing an
old and respected friend. It hurts.
In the 1940s on the East Coast, and
then for many years after coming to
California three decades ago, I was a
strong supporter of the ACLU- Atone
point, I served on a steering commit
tee to set up a Bay Area mia-Peninsu
la chapter.

I thought nothing was more impor
tant to the ACLU and its members
than defending the idea that free
speech and assembly are secure only
when they are secure for all Ameri
cans. That is what the First Amend
ment is all about. That is also what the
ACLU used to be all about. It is why I
joined.
I do not wish to be misunderstood.
The ACLU still believes that "the
right to free speech is always tested at
the extremes." It defended the right
of American Nazis to march in
Skokie, Illinois, not because it likes
the goose-stepping racists but be
cause, in the words of one of its
chapter coordinators, "The Bill of
Rights is the ACLU's only client."
For this very same reason, the
ACLU also has defended the right of
(among others) Communists,
polygamists and atheists to persuade
others to their way of thinking
without itself advocating com
munism, polygamy or atheism.
But the ACLU today marches to a
different drummer — or, more ac
curately, to many different drum
mers. In recent years, it has extended
its reach beyond the outer limits of
First Amendment freedoms that it
once regarded as its special mandate
to protect without political parti
sanship.
It now has moved into areas where
the promotion of free speech, press,
religion and association appear to be
entangled with (and, some would
say, motivated by) political and parti
san interests. It is the injection of po
litical standards into judgments over
policies and programs that has set the
ACLU on a different course and
changed its tone and character.
This observation does not make
me a lapsed civil libertarian. It simply
means that I do not support the grow
ing tendency of the ACLU to uphold

First Amendment freedoms as part of
its contribution to calling for an end
to the Vietnam war or assisting the
poor. The fact that I personally op
posed the war and favor appropriate
government action to relieve tne ef
fects of poverty is as irrelevant (or
should be) as my own particular poli
tics.
I can remember when the ACLU
stood virtually alone in defending
civil liberties, not because it regarded
them as important in serving dif
ferent and "higher" goals, but be
cause it believed in trie defense of
due process as an "intrinsic value."
Now the ACLU has become anoth
er "activist" organization with its
own agenda of "just causes." It has
taken positions and advanced its own
ideas on sexual equality, racial jus
tice, community control of New
York's public schools, Watergate (it
was one of the first to call for Nixon's
impeachment), abortion, busing, ra
cially preferential treatment in af
firmative action — to list but a few of
the political and social issues it has
targeted for action.
Those who agree with the ACLU's
new thinking and feel it has a mission
to campaign for these and other po
litical causes may want to join the
crusade.
I remain a "traditionalist." I do not
think that the ACLU protection of the

procedures and values rooted in our
system of law and, ultimately, the Bill
of Rights should have anything to do
with its stance on the Bakke case, the
women's movement or ending the
draft.
In a word, I do not believe that
genuine civil liberties should be poli
ticized. There are many other or
ganizations one can support in the
battle for economic and social justice
or assist in achieving other objec
tives.
But I doubt that the principles of
civil libertarianism will win the
needed support of more and more
Americans of every opinion and per
suasion if the ACLU continues to be
involved in a wide range of political
struggles. Besides, with so many "just
causes" to fight for, one begins to
wonder what the ACLU really cares
about the most.
Stanley Engelstein, a champion of
civil liberties from New York, has
pointed out that once the "just
cause" criterion becomes the basis
for civil libertarian action, "then the
civil liberties of your political oppo
nents (who don't agree with your
definition of the 'just cause'), will be
ignored or violated." It is a danger I
worry about. I wish the ACLU would
too.

I do not wish to be misunderstood.
The ACLU still believes that "the
right to free speech is always tested at
the extremes." It defended the right
of American Nazis to march in
Skokie, Illinois, not because it likes
the goose-stepping racists but be
cause, in the words of one of its
chapter coordinators, "The Bill of
Rights is the ACLU's only client."
For this very same reason, the
ACLU also has defended the right of
(among others) Communists,
polygamists and atheists to persuade
others to their way of thinking
without itself advocating com
munism, polygamy or atheism.
But the ACLU today marches to a
different drummer — or, more ac
curately, to many different drum
mers. In recent years, it has extended
its reach beyond the outer limits of
First Amendment freedoms that it
once regarded as its special mandate
to protect without political parti
sanship.
It now has moved into areas where
the promotion of free speech, press,
religion and association appear to be
entangled with (and, some would
say, motivated by) political and parti
san interests. It is the injection of po
litical standards into judgments over
policies and programs that has set the
ACLU on a different course and
changed its tone and character.
This observation does not make
me a lapsed civil libertarian. It simply
means that I do not support the grow
ing tendency of the ACLU to uphold

First Amendment freedoms as part of
its contribution to calling for an end
to the Vietnam war or assisting the
poor. The fact that I personally op
posed the war and favor appropriate
government action to relieve tne ef
fects of poverty is as irrelevant (or
should be) as my own particular poli
tics.
I can remember when the ACLU
stood virtually alone in defending
civil liberties, not because it regarded
them as important in serving dif
ferent and "higher" goals, but be
cause it believed in trie defense of
due process as an "intrinsic value."
Now the ACLU has become anoth
er "activist" organization with its
own agenda of "just causes." It has
taken positions and advanced its own
ideas on sexual equality, racial jus
tice, community control of New
York's public schools, Watergate (it
was one of the first to call for Nixon's
impeachment), abortion, busing, ra
cially preferential treatment in af
firmative action — to list but a few of
the political and social issues it has
targeted for action.
Those who agree with the ACLU's
new thinking and feel it has a mission
to campaign for these and other po
litical causes may want to join the
crusade.
I remain a "traditionalist." I do not
think that the ACLU protection of the

procedures and values rooted in our
system of law and, ultimately, the Bill
of Rights should have anything to do
with its stance on the Bakke case, the
women's movement or ending the
draft.
In a word, I do not believe that
genuine civil liberties should be poli
ticized. There are many other or
ganizations one can support in the
battle for economic and social justice
or assist in achieving other objec
tives.
But I doubt that the principles of
civil libertarianism will win the
needed support of more and more
Americans of every opinion and per
suasion if the ACLU continues to be
involved in a wide range of political
struggles. Besides, with so many "just
causes" to fight for, one begins to
wonder what the ACLU really cares
about the most.
Stanley Engelstein, a champion of
civil liberties from New York, has
pointed out that once the "just
cause" criterion becomes the basis
for civil libertarian action, "then the
civil liberties of your political oppo
nents (who don't agree with your
definition of the 'just cause'), will be
ignored or violated." It is a danger I
worry about. I wish the ACLU would
too.

A few weeks ago, I received in the
mail an invitation to join the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union "in time to
celebrate our 60th anniversary." I
have thought about it long and hard.
I used to be an active member. I still
would like to be — but I cannot.
My own decision will not matter
very much to the ACLU. Noorganiza
tion can please everyone. But to me,
the loss of the ACLU as a personal
commitment has been like losing an
old and respected friend. It hurts.
In the 1940s on the East Coast, and
then for many years after coming to
California three decades ago, I was a
strong supporter of the ACLU- Atone
point, I served on a steering commit
tee to set up a Bay Area mia-Peninsu
la chapter.

I thought nothing was more impor
tant to the ACLU and its members
than defending the idea that free
speech and assembly are secure only
when they are secure for all Ameri
cans. That is what the First Amend
ment is all about. That is also what the
ACLU used to be all about. It is why I
joined.
