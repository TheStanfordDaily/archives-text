## Jackson's personal labor of love is stillborn on film 
### Jiri Weiss 
Stevie is a veiy personal film,
a labor of love on a shoestring
budget by Glenda Jackson, one
of England's best actresses, and
her producer/director Robert
Enders.
The film deals with the life of
Stevie Smith, a poet of middle
class English suburbia and a
personal hero for Jackson.
"Sheisoneofour greatest writ
ers," Jackson has said about
her. "She knew that the real
drama of life is lived on a rela
tively minute scale."
Stevie did indeed live on a
minute scale. She never trav
eled but lived for all but three
of her 69 years in her Palmers
Green house — most of those
with her Yorkshire aunt. She
enjoyed her daily commute,
her desk job in a London pub
lishing firm which enabled her
to write poetry, her tea or lamb
chops with mint sauce with her
aunt ("Lion Aunt" as Stevie af
fectionately called her) who
had a heart of gold.
Still, Jackson considers Stevie
"a revolutionary woman be
cause of her view of society."
According to Jackson, Stevie
was skeptical toward authority
and though she was a deeply
religious woman she was "on
the level of saying 'Well, if you
are God, prove it I' She
absolutely discounted the so
cial attitudes of her time. She

did not believe that a woman's
greatest fulfillment was within
the home and with children, al
though there was nothing in
her background to key her into
this stance."
But Stevie, as the film paints
her, seems to be the antithesis
of a revolutionary. She was a
perpetually exhausted woman
— partially because of her
childhood tuberculosis — who
had a childlike view of the
world rather than any consis
tent view as a revolutionary or
feminist would. There was no
goal, no struggle, only a neu
rotic desire to write.
Stevie had no stomach either
for romance — her only suitor
was a petty man with half her
intelligence who had no ap
preciation of her talents — or
for fame that came within her
lifetime (she was awarded the
Queen's Gold Medal for
Poetry). Instead, Stevie com
mitted her life to what she
called "an orgy of boredom"
complete with suicide attempts
and escapes into housework
which she called "the most
matvelousexcusefor not work
ing." Stevie's Lion Aunt pro
vided the only intimate human
contact and became a sub
stitute for a child as she grew
more dependent on her.
Stevie's poetry reflects her
sheltered life. Her vision is very
limited: "Life is like a railway
station, the train of birth brings

us in, the train of death will
carry us away," she wrote. You
have to be in the right kind of
mood for this type of poetry
that permeates the film, in
terspersed in the long mono
logues that make up the bulk of
Sfew'e. If you are not in the
right kind of tolerant mood
most of the poetry will sound
trite. Stevie recites one poem,
"Thoughts About the Christian
Doctrine of Eternal Hell," at
the opening of the film: "It is

not interesting to see/How
Christians continually/Try to
separate themselves in
vain/From the doctrine of
eternal pain." After James
Joyce, why cite the obvious?
It is not difficult to see why
Enders' film, though it opened
to a unanimous critical acclaim
in 1978, failed to win a follow
ing. Enders blames the original
failiure on distribution but ad
mits that it is a difficult film for
the audience.

Besides the tiinidity of
Smith's chaiacter and her col
orless life there is the addi
tional problem of turning into
a film what was originally a play
with the same cast — Jackson as
Stevie and Mona Washbourne
as Lion Aunt. Unfortunately
the film does not live up to the
challenge, despite the brilliant
performances by both Jackson
and Washbourne. It is not
much more then a play on the
screen.

performances by Glenda
lackson and M ona

Enders and Academy Award
winning ci nematographer
Freddie Young break every
rule of their art. Most of the
film is confined to the living
room of Stevie's home ana
most of the script is monologue
addressed directly to the au
dience — a technique which
works fine in the intimacy of
the theatre but is artificial in
the voyeur's medium of film.
For example, there is a great
deal of narration by an un
named friend of Stevie —
played by Trevor Howard —
who walks around the parks
and playgrounds of London as
the camera follows at a respect
able distance. He pauses, turns
around, looks into the camera

as if in thought, and then starts
speaking in a slow and de
liberate voice about Stevie as
the camera zooms in.
In spite of its faults, Jackson,
who is best known in this coun
try for her role in Women in
Love which won her first Oscar,
and her title role in the BBC
series Elizabeth R almost suc
ceeds in convincing you into
liking the film — if you drop
your guard, you probably will.
Enders explains the film's
lack of popular success as the
fate of all "art" films. If so, it is
only a pity that he did not ex
plore beyond the confines of a
play to the limits of his art.
Stevie is currently playing at
t!\e Aquarius Theatre in down

rule of their art. Most of the
film is confined to the living
room of Stevie's home ana
most of the script is monologue
addressed directly to the au
dience — a technique which
works fine in the intimacy of
the theatre but is artificial in
the voyeur's medium of film.
For example, there is a great
deal of narration by an un
named friend of Stevie —
played by Trevor Howard —
who walks around the parks
and playgrounds of London as
the camera follows at a respect
able distance. He pauses, turns
around, looks into the camera

as if in thought, and then starts
speaking in a slow and de
liberate voice about Stevie as
the camera zooms in.
In spite of its faults, Jackson,
who is best known in this coun

and her title role in the BBC

your guard, you probably will.

Stevie is a veiy personal film,
a labor of love on a shoestring
budget by Glenda Jackson, one
of England's best actresses, and
her producer/director Robert
Enders.
The film deals with the life of
Stevie Smith, a poet of middle
class English suburbia and a
personal hero for Jackson.
"Sheisoneofour greatest writ
ers," Jackson has said about
her. "She knew that the real
drama of life is lived on a rela
tively minute scale."
Stevie did indeed live on a
minute scale. She never trav
eled but lived for all but three
of her 69 years in her Palmers
Green house — most of those
with her Yorkshire aunt. She
enjoyed her daily commute,
her desk job in a London pub
lishing firm which enabled her
to write poetry, her tea or lamb
chops with mint sauce with her
aunt ("Lion Aunt" as Stevie af
fectionately called her) who
had a heart of gold.
Still, Jackson considers Stevie
"a revolutionary woman be
cause of her view of society."
According to Jackson, Stevie
was skeptical toward authority
and though she was a deeply
religious woman she was "on
the level of saying 'Well, if you
are God, prove it I' She
absolutely discounted the so
cial attitudes of her time. She

did not believe that a woman's
greatest fulfillment was within
the home and with children, al
though there was nothing in
her background to key her into
this stance."
But Stevie, as the film paints
her, seems to be the antithesis
of a revolutionary. She was a
perpetually exhausted woman
— partially because of her
childhood tuberculosis — who
had a childlike view of the
world rather than any consis
tent view as a revolutionary or
feminist would. There was no
goal, no struggle, only a neu
rotic desire to write.
Stevie had no stomach either
for romance — her only suitor
was a petty man with half her
intelligence who had no ap
preciation of her talents — or
for fame that came within her
lifetime (she was awarded the
Queen's Gold Medal for
Poetry). Instead, Stevie com
mitted her life to what she
called "an orgy of boredom"
complete with suicide attempts
and escapes into housework
which she called "the most
matvelousexcusefor not work
ing." Stevie's Lion Aunt pro
vided the only intimate human
contact and became a sub
stitute for a child as she grew
more dependent on her.
Stevie's poetry reflects her
sheltered life. Her vision is very
limited: "Life is like a railway
station, the train of birth brings

us in, the train of death will
carry us away," she wrote. You
have to be in the right kind of
mood for this type of poetry
that permeates the film, in
terspersed in the long mono
logues that make up the bulk of
Sfew'e. If you are not in the
right kind of tolerant mood
most of the poetry will sound
trite. Stevie recites one poem,
"Thoughts About the Christian
Doctrine of Eternal Hell," at
the opening of the film: "It is

not interesting to see/How
Christians continually/Try to
separate themselves in
vain/From the doctrine of
eternal pain." After James
Joyce, why cite the obvious?
It is not difficult to see why
Enders' film, though it opened
to a unanimous critical acclaim
in 1978, failed to win a follow
ing. Enders blames the original
failiure on distribution but ad
mits that it is a difficult film for
the audience.

Smith's chaiacter and her col
orless life there is the addi
tional problem of turning into
