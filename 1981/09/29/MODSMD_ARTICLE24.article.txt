# Beware the moon... and the stars: two Hollywood monster movies
## 'American Werewolf in London' 
### Steve Vineberg 
John Landis' movies are so
cheerfully adolescent that one
can't take them seriously: the
dufnb fraternity hijinks in
Antma I House cartwheeled
intd the elaborate chases in
The Blues Brothers, in which
those superannuated young
sters, John Belushi and Dan
Aykroyd, gleefully junked
dozens of glistening new auto
mobiles. Landis lacks the in
ventiveness — and the tech
nique — to transform his
sophomoric jokes into comic
fantasy, as Steven Spielberg did
in the best parts of 7947 and
Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale
did in Used Cars, but his
buoyant silliness energizes his
movies, and he doesn't trash
his actors: he seems to know a
good thing when he sees one. (
The Blues Brothers, for in
stance, stopped in its clumsy
tracks for Aretha Franklin's
great "Think" number.)
The two young stars of An
American Werewolf in Lon
don, David Naughton (who
dances in the Dr. Pepper TV
a<js) and Griffin Dunne, have
phasing screen presences and
an easy rapport; they bounce
euen the dead patches of Land-
dialogue off each other as
though they were first-rate
vaudeville routines, and their
giddiness on screen suggests
partying rather than acting.
They've caught the true John
Lihdis spirit. An American
Werewolf is a series of gags,
sqjme of them moronic, a
ntimber of them clever (like
thl£ inclusion of "Blue Moon"
aifd "Bad Moon Rising" in the
soundtrack), none of them in
spired. The best idea in the
mipvie is sustained the longest:
the two heroes, David Kessler
arid Jack Goodman, are nice
Jewish boys from Long Island
whose friendly banter — a mix-
of kidding insults and sex
uarl confidences ("Do you think
Debbie Klein will meet me in
Itfrly?" "Don't be a putz") —
continues even after the
werewolf attack that turns
D&vid into the next werewolf
generation and Jack into the

undead.
The problem with the pic
ture is that it's a spoof of a
genre of movies that Landis
either doesn't understand es
pecially well or doesn't feel
comfortable with. Whenever
he has to focus on the horror
film plot, he loses his style,
even though he has the as
sistance of a smart editor,
Malcolm Campbell, and a
skillful special effects man,
Rick Baker.
The atmospheric scenes in
the northern English pub, The
Slaughtered Lamo, near which
the werewolf appears, demand
the sort of knowing parody that
Mel Brooks was adept at in
Young Frankenstein; without
it, they plod on purposelessly
and we're left to ask questions
we shouldn't have to ask about
why the villagers are acting in
such a strange, inconsistent
manner. When David
metamorphoses into a
werewolf for the first time, the
process appears so grisly and
painful that we can't enjoy the
wizardry. The violent se
quences lack ' wit, and cul
minate in an execrably staged
and extremely unpleasant
crowd scene in Piccadilly
Circus that recalls the dullest of
the disaster movies.
And worst of all, the ending
is a downer: when Jenny Agut
ter, who plays the nurse David
has been sleeping with in his
off hours (i.e., when there's no
full moon), declares her love to
this hairy grey creature with
human blood dripping from
his lips, we expect something
special to follow — perhaps a
love-conquers-all miracle that
takes off on the end of Altered
States (to which movie Landis
has already referred, in one of
the funniest bits). Instead, An
American Werewolf ends like
any other monster film, as if it
weren't a movie with a
hilarious title in which the
werewolf hero is invited into a
porno theater to meet the spir
its of the people he killed the
night before. If John Landis
ever moves past the beer bash
stage, he might direct first-rate
bad movies.

the werewolf appears, demand
the sort of knowing parody that
Mel Brooks was adept at in
Young Frankenstein; without
it, they plod on purposelessly
and we're left to ask questions
we shouldn't have to ask about
why the villagers are acting in
such a strange, inconsistent
manner. When David
metamorphoses into a
werewolf for the first time, the
process appears so grisly and
painful that we can't enjoy the
wizardry. The violent se
quences lack ' wit, and cul
minate in an execrably staged
and extremely unpleasant
crowd scene in Piccadilly
Circus that recalls the dullest of
the disaster movies.
And worst of all, the ending
is a downer: when Jenny Agut
ter, who plays the nurse David
has been sleeping with in his
off hours (i.e., when there's no
full moon), declares her love to
this hairy grey creature with
human blood dripping from
his lips, we expect something
special to follow — perhaps a
love-conquers-all miracle that
takes off on the end of Altered
States (to which movie Landis
has already referred, in one of
the funniest bits). Instead, An
American Werewolf ends like
any other monster film, as if it
weren't a movie with a
hilarious title in which the
werewolf hero is invited into a
porno theater to meet the spir
its of the people he killed the
night before. If John Landis
ever moves past the beer bash
stage, he might direct first-rate
bad movies.
