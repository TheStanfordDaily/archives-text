# 'Mommie Dearest'
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The first shots are of a lux
urious bedroom and bath in
the style of 1930s Hollywood as
interpreted by 1950s Holly
wood: it looks like a creamy,
oversized motel suite. As the
moldy theme music by Henry
Ma ncini throbs on the
soundtrack, we watch the de
tails of the lengthy morning
ablutions of a woman who is
clearly — judging from the
time the camera lavishes on
this ritual — a Great Lady. Is
Mommie Dearest really a Ross.
Hunter movie, and is that Lana
Turner edging suggestively

into those close-ups, pausing
dramatically before uttering
every pedestrian line?
Actually, it's Faye Dunaway
as Joan Crawford, in the film
adaptation of Christina
Crawford's scandalous account
of the life of the adopted child
of a crazy alcoholic star — but
the movie seems to have been
conceived in a time warp: it
isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture.
Though the book is lurid
trash, terribly repetitive and
splotched with passages of un
explained sentimentality, the
acts of cruelty and irrationality
Christina chronicles — mid
night raids on the children's
room in which closets are torn
apart because of the discovery
of a pair of wire coat hangers,
Christina forced to wear a
slashed party dress for a week
as punishment or walled upin a
convent school without per
mission to return home for sev
enteen months — are so ex
treme that, seen from the point
of view of a child who knows
that her mother is raving but
whom no one will believe, they
have a Kafka-like scariness. A
good screenwriter could have
worked this masochistic page
turner into a terrific movie ex
amining how the pressures of
stardom crack the already
damaged psyche of a madly
ambitious woman who turns
into one of her own screen
characters. And a good direc
tor could have brought us into
the world of a tormented child,
as Carol Reed did in The Fallen
Idol, and given us a truly night
marish glimpse of psychotic
behavior. Instead, Mommie
Dearest offers us a fan maga
zine's view of Hollywood life.
The screenplay is credited to
four people — the director
Frank Perry, Frank Yablans,
Tracy Hotchner and Robert
Getchell — but Getchell, who
had written the original treat
ment of the material, (which
the original star, Anne Ban
croft, rejected), was called in to
perform surgery when it must
have become apparent to ev
