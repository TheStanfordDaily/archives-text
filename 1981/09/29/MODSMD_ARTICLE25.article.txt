# 'Mommie Dearest'
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The first shots are of a lux
urious bedroom and bath in
the style of 1930s Hollywood as
interpreted by 1950s Holly
wood: it looks like a creamy,
oversized motel suite. As the
moldy theme music by Henry
Ma ncini throbs on the
soundtrack, we watch the de
tails of the lengthy morning
ablutions of a woman who is
clearly — judging from the
time the camera lavishes on
this ritual — a Great Lady. Is
Mommie Dearest really a Ross.
Hunter movie, and is that Lana
Turner edging suggestively

into those close-ups, pausing
dramatically before uttering
every pedestrian line?
Actually, it's Faye Dunaway
as Joan Crawford, in the film
adaptation of Christina
Crawford's scandalous account
of the life of the adopted child
of a crazy alcoholic star — but
the movie seems to have been
conceived in a time warp: it
isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture.
Though the book is lurid
trash, terribly repetitive and
splotched with passages of un
explained sentimentality, the
acts of cruelty and irrationality
Christina chronicles — mid
night raids on the children's
room in which closets are torn
apart because of the discovery
of a pair of wire coat hangers,
Christina forced to wear a
slashed party dress for a week
as punishment or walled upin a
convent school without per
mission to return home for sev
enteen months — are so ex
treme that, seen from the point
of view of a child who knows
that her mother is raving but
whom no one will believe, they
have a Kafka-like scariness. A
good screenwriter could have
worked this masochistic page
turner into a terrific movie ex
amining how the pressures of
stardom crack the already
damaged psyche of a madly
ambitious woman who turns
into one of her own screen
characters. And a good direc
tor could have brought us into
the world of a tormented child,
as Carol Reed did in The Fallen
Idol, and given us a truly night
marish glimpse of psychotic
behavior. Instead, Mommie
Dearest offers us a fan maga
zine's view of Hollywood life.
The screenplay is credited to
four people — the director
Frank Perry, Frank Yablans,
Tracy Hotchner and Robert
Getchell — but Getchell, who
had written the original treat
ment of the material, (which
the original star, Anne Ban
croft, rejected), was called in to
perform surgery when it must
have become apparent to ev
eryone involved in the project
that the new script was a
shambles — really, beyond re
pair.
I haven't seen Getchell's ver
sion, which was reputedly
brilliant, but I can guess which
touches are his. There's a late
sequence in which Joan
triumphs over Pepsi-Cola's
board of directors after her
husband's death that shows
flashes of wit, and the last line
of the movie is its best — when
a lawyer tells Christina and her
brother Christopher that their
mother's will disinherits them,
Christopher remarks, "Well,
she got the last word, as usual."
Christina replies, "Did she? "
as our minds conjure up a vi
sion of millions of copies of the
most shameless expose of a
movie star's private life ever
written. But Frank Perry
doesn't have a sense of humor,
or else he's so inept at satire
that he gives the impression of
missing the joke.
That's not all he misses. Since
he doesn't direct Joan's attacks
on her daughter from Tina's
perspective, and most of them
aren't explained, they make no
sense in dramatic or psy
chologicl terms — and they
never seem to have conse

quences. No one in the movie
seems to be living in the real
world: Joan's secretary-com
panion, Carol Ann (Rutanya
Alda), watches atrocity after
atrocity perpetrated on this
child and not only doesn't try
to intervene — she doesn't
even seem to find Joan's behav
ior unusual.
In some scenes, Christina
demonstrates an unreasonable
affection for her mother; there
is no attempt to get at Christ
ina's ambivalence towards her
mother, of which the book
provides ample evidence.
Furthermore, though the mov
ie is ostensibly about people
whose entire lives unfold like
the movies they are involved
in, we never see a film in
progress; in fact, only once
does Perrv actually take us in
side a studio, and only as far as
the office of LB Mayer (played
with peculiar dignity by How
ard Da Silva).
Besides, neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child wno
plays the young Christina,
Maya Hobel, betrays any ten
sion between real life and play
acting: the little girl overenun
ciates all her lines like the most
demonically trained alumna of
an elocutionary school, and
Dunaway, who has studied

Crawford's movies so closely
that she can reproduce her way
of raising one eyebrow and her
tears-in-the-voice routine (and
is made up to look creepily like
Crawford in some scenes), ac
complishes something that I
would never have suspected
any actress of wanting to do —
she gives an accurate render
ing of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.
Diane Scarwid (the waitress
in last year's Inside Moves)
plays Tina from the age of
about sixteen up, and though
there's a suggestion in a few of
her scenes of a real actress
struggling with this garbage,
her low, sexy voice is embar
rassingly inappropriate for the
teenage scenes, and the suc
cession of wigs she must wear
rivals any torture Joan could
have dreamed up. The most
sadistic cosmetic skullduggery,
however, is performed on
Rutanya Alda, who shows up in
one of the later scenes looking
approximately like a cadaver
sent over by the local morgue
for a prosthesis class to practice
on. It's a colossal joke that the
make-up department at Para
mount, so preoccupied with
resurrecting corpses in Mom
mie Dearest should have inad
vertently reversed the process.
