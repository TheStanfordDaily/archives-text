# Cole and Woods in the heat of battle

### Ted Gioia Richie Cole Phil Woods Side by Side Muse Records 
! When two of the world's greatest alto sax players
meet the sparks are bound to fly, and when those two
ffJP re Richie Cole and Phil Woods those sparks will
I" 'most certainly lead to fire.
The fire of Richie Cole's spirited alto has been no
icret to Bay Area jazz afficionados. The past several
»ars have seen Cole gigging extensively around Cali
>rnia. Most recently the New Jersey born altoist en
anced audiences at the Monterey Jazz Festival and
: San Francisco's Keystone Korner.
Jazz is perhaps the most informal of the arts, yet
ole takes this informality to new heights. He is will
ig to sit in with almost any group, large or small,
ithout the benefit of rehearsals or pre-concert
leetings. The half dozen times I have seen Cole in
jncert, he has surprised me by playing with all new
lusicians on each gig. One gathers the impression
iat Cole is a modern day "have alto, will travel" mu
cian who is content to play with whatever other in
strumentalists he can track down in the area.
Phil Woods, though equally talented, displays a
marked contrast in demeanor. He typically insists on
playing with his own long-standing and well-re
nearsed group, having long ago escnewed gigging
with local musicians. As a result Woods' music has

long struck me as less spontaneous and less surprising
than it might otherwise be. His talent has languished
in a climate of unmitigated predictability.
Side by Side, however, provides a happy exception.
Woods plays with more intensity and verve than I can
recall having heard from him in recent years. Particu
larly on the up tempo sizzlers "Donna Lee" and
"Scrapple from the Apple", his playing is consistently
crisp and exciting.
It is worth noting that Woods plays on this album
with musicians other than those with whom he usual
ly works: pianist John Hicks (long familiar to fans of
Betty Carter), Jimmy Cobb, and Walter Booker. New
surroundings have always proven inspirational to
Woods; the clearest example of this is perhaps
Woods' memorable playing on Billy Joel's hit single
"Just the Way You Are." Woods regularly refuses to
back-up vocalists, yet Joel lured him into the studio.
The result was one of Woods' best performances, and
certainly his most famous one.
But if Woods' playing is superb, it is equally clear
that Cole rises to the occasion. Cole is the consum
mate jam session musician, and his playing is always
best when there is another alto player on stage
breathing down his neck. Fans of his who have not
heard his alto battle with Eric Kloss (also recorded on
Muse) should pick that disc up too for further testi
mony of what Cole is capable of in the heat of battle.
A further treat is the playing of Eddie "Lockjaw"

Davis who adds his tenor playing on one number.
Since "Jaws" cut his teeth with the Basie band in the
fifties he has been one of the most distinctive and re
spected tenorists around. Like Cole, Davis shows off
his best playing in jam sessions; he builds his as
carefully as contractors build houses, always setting
down a steady foundation before reaching for the

ing only because it is all too brief.
Side by Side comes highly recommended. Muse

uct coming out of some of the sma'lfr recora labels.
Like Concord, Artist's House, and several other small
labels, Muse is making a significant contribution to
contemporary jazz.
