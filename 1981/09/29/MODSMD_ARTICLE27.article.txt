# Shanachie: just plain Irish folks
## 
### Karen Halbo 
After my first day of
classes at University of Lon
don, I wearily wandered
across the street to a small
pub called the Yorkshire
Grey, in search of some
palatable substitute for that
dreadful stuff they were
serving at my dorm. Inside I
found wonderful food, ov
erflowing glasses of lager
and ale, a small jukebox
with the latest of English and
American pop music, and a
band that played Irish and
English folk music every Fri
day and Saturday night.
Of all the "knowledge"
and "culture" I brought
back with me after my short
stint in London, my fondest
memories are of listening to
that band, clapping along
with the music, pounding
my glass on the the table,
and joining in a loud beery
chorus whenever the band
played a sing-along.
Not too long ago, a friend
of mine took me to dinner at
a bar in Sunnyvale, the
Cheshire Arms, and it was
there that I first heard the

music of Shanachie, an Irish
folk band that performs in
English-type taverns in the
San Jose area.
Now although watching
the band perform in these
bar-supper clubs will never
quite compare to my after
noons at the Grey, it's not a
bad way to spend an eve
ning, and the old Irish and
English folk songs they play
merit at least one hearing,
and auite possibly more if
you find yourself tapping
your glass and humming
along with the music.
The band consists of Jim
Rivera, who plays banjo and
lead guitar, Dan Dupre, who
plays guitar, and Todd
Bridges, who plays bass.
Margret Dillon occasionally
joins in to help out on the
vocals, and the three men
often sing together in two or
three-part harmony for the
folk songs.
It seems the band got
started by Rivera about five
years ago, and since then
Shanachie has gone
through many changes in
personnel, but always stuck

to the same syle of music —
bluegrass, folk, and an
ocassional ballad.
The band boasts several
"groupies" — folks who
come every week to the res
taurants and bars they play
at, and also have a hefty
mailing list that gets sent out
once a month.
Up until about a month
ago, there were four full
time members of
Shanachie, who had played
together for the better part
of a year and planned to
tour England and parts of
Europe. Now it seems that
those plans have been
changed. Still, they are
always a big hit when they
do their yearly show at the
Gilroy Garlic Festival.
The last time I went to
hear these folks play, they
were at the Brittania Arms, a
transplanted 'genuine Eng
lish' pub on Winchester
Blvd. in San Jose. The place
is great, with a long bar, lots
of small tables, authentic
English food, and a mind
boggling palate-enchanting

array of lagers and ales (yes,
even a few brands of beer
for any American diehards).
Best of all, Shanachie plays
there every Friday ana Sat
urday night.
I've brought quite a few
friends along with me to
hear the band, and I've
come to the conclusion that
most punk rockers are un
able to appreciate folk mu
sic. If you don't mind
melodic tunes, timeless lyr
ics, and beautiful voices,
you'll probably enjoy an
evening listening to these
guys.
And better yet, if you
have a preference (and are
willing to admit it) for music
in the style of Peter, Paul,
and Mary, or the Simon and
Garfunkel genre, you'll
probably get hookea, like
me, and make a night out to
hear this band a weekly hab
it.
If so, you'll see me there,
sitting in the corner with a
small group of friends, sing
ing off-key and pounding
my glass on the counter.

evening listening to these
guys.
And better yet, if you
have a preference (and are
willing to admit it) for music
in the style of Peter, Paul,
and Mary, or the Simon and
Garfunkel genre, you'll
probably get hookea, like
me, and make a night out to
hear this band a weekly hab
it.
If so, you'll see me there,
sitting in the corner with a
small group of friends, sing
ing off-key and pounding
my glass on the counter.
