## ASSU presents year's plans 
### Brad Crystal 
If the ASSU Senate gets its way, students here can look
forward this year to dorm snack bars, a $5 airport limou
sine service, and an expanded Coffee House.
Over the summer, members of the ASSU Senate and
the Council of Presidents (COP) were working hard to
serve students better, at least that's the impression they
trying to convey at last Thursday's informal first
meeting.
At the meeting, Senate Chair Dave Phelps said he was
hopeful that an ASSU owned-and-operated snack bar
might begin service on an experimental basis in Branner
Hall as early as the end of October. The idea, however,
first must win administration approval.
In keeping with the ASSU's non-profit status, snack bar
prices would be set on a break-even basis.
If the Branner concession proves to be popular, snack
bars would probably be extended to other dorrns later in
the year.
Phelps said one high-ranking administrator he talked
to reacted favorably toward the snack bar proposal, but
not without qualifications.
There is some concern, according to Phelps, that dorm
snack bars would cut into the money dorms now earn
through vending machines and would increase main
tenance and cleaning costs. Also, dorm snack bars might
keep students from socializing at central meeting spots
such as Tresidder Union.
One summer ASSU proposal that has already met with

apparent success is an airport limosine service, initated
on a trial basis at the end of summer quarter. Promoters
said that at $5, the service represented "the lowest price
in the South Bay."
Sen. Mark Epstein, chair of the finance committee,
termed student response "overwhelmingly positive."
Although the service made a slim profit of just $20, Eps
tein and Phelps said the it had proved itself economically
viable and would likely be continued this fall.
The meeting also included a discussion of the future
status of the Coffee House.
Over the summer new office and storage space was
created by expanding into what had been the Coffee
House exhibition gallery.
More expansion may occur by next spring when Cof
fee House operators hope to create an outdoor enclosed
patio on the White Plaza side of the Coffee House.
COP member Chris Greene said he hopes that the
Coffee House's liquor license would be extended to this
newly added 30-by-40 foot area.
The organizational structure of the ASSU will also un
dergo expansion this year, with the proposed addition of
a new Office of Public Affairs.
This new department would be charged with the job
of "promoting public awareness in and unifying the pub
lic image of the ASSU."
To that end, the department would develop advertis
ing campaigns for various apects of the ASSU publish an
tion is not limited to the first com
pany signing the agreement, but
rather any company willing to pay
the fees is entitled to use the patent.
Under the usual policy at Stanford
— one which, in fact, is unusual for
other universities — researchers are
entitled to share in the royalties.
However, both Cohen and Boyer
opted to donate their share of the
royalties to the furthering of research
at their respective institutions.
Here, one-third ofthesharewill go
to the Medical School and one third
will be shared by the departments of
Medicine and Genetics where

Cohen holds joint appointments.
The one-third usually allowed the re
searcher has been assigned by Cohen
to the University Research Develop
ment Fund for use in biomedical re
search and for the Deans Fellowship
Fund for postdoctoral fellows in the
School of Medicine, as well as the
Biology Department in the School of
Humanities and Sciences. In the sec
ond part of this series, the Daily will
examine another agreement be
tween Stanford and the business
community which will funnel nearly
57 million into research projects
here. See tomorrow's paper tor more
on the issue of genetic engineering.
