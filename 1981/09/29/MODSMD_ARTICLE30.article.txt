On October 16, 1960, University planners released the
"Master Plan for the Sixties" â€” their predictions for the
next 10 years.
They couldn't have known, in those innocent days when
the Rally Committee filled a chartered plane to the UCLA
game and tuition only went up about 7.5 percent each
year, what the sixties would really be like.
If you asked him today, Vice Provost Robert Wert might
not say that more undergraduate housing is unnecessary.
And Vice President for Finance Kenneth Cuthbertson
would almost certainly not say that he wants to strengthen
the humanities here by "bringing in top men."
We want to strengthen the Daily by bringing in top peo
ple.
So, bring yourself into our office any afternoon this
week and ask to see the Daily that appeared on the day
you did.
Then look around the office. Meet our staff. Let us con
vince you to go to work for us.
