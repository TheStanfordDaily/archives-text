Bear turns bull on Wall Street
New York —The depressed stock market staged
a dramatic rally Monday, allaying fears of a crisis as
markets in London and around tne world plunged.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
began the week at its lowest level in more than a
year, tumbled almost 15 points in early trading,
But then it turned upward, gathering momen
tum as it went. By the close of trading the widely
recognized yardstick of market trends stood at
842.56, up 18.55 on the day.
That gloom-to-euphoria turnaround contrasted
sharply with the news from most foreign markets,
which were battered by selling amid what one ana
lyst described as talk of "a world-wide recession."
In London, a sharp decline in share prices that
began about two weeks ago intensified. "Mass hys
teria," said a broker who declined to be identified.
Japan's stock market took its biggest drop on
record, and prices also fell sharply in financial cen
ters from Sydney, Australia and Singapore to
Frankfurt, West Germany.
The New York market's rebound came as a relief
to traders who had been watching the Dow Jones
industrial average fall more than 200 points since
last spring. On April 27, it stood at an eight-year
high of 1,024.05.
Joseph Granville, the controversial market fore
caster, had been quoted in Paris late last week as
saying Monday would "go down in financial his
tory as 'Blue Monday.'"
However, trading activity during the day never
reached the pace ot the silver crisis in early 1980 in
volving the Hunt brothers of Texas, or of tne 23.80-
point drop last Jan. 7 when Granville urged his fol
lowers to "sell everything."
That day a record 92.89 million shares were
traded on the NYSE Monday's volume, by a pre
liminary estimate, came to 61.80 million shares.
"There's no panic," said William Ramsay, a
trader with Colin, Hochstin Co., on the New York
Stock Exchange floor Monday morning.
Senate tables tax bill
Washington — The Republican-controlled Sen
ate yesterday easily crushed attempts by liberal
and moderate Democrats to defer the recently
enacted tax reduction.
The Senate tabled, and thus killed, the tax-cut
proposal, 74 to 13.
Tne proposals were offered as amendments to
politically volatile legislation that would shove the
ceiling on government borrowing above $1 trillion
for the first time in history.
The present debt ceiling of $985 billion will ex
pire tomorrow. The Senate will try to finish the bill
today and quickly resolve any differences with the
House in a conference committee. But passage of
pending Senate amendments dealing with Social
Security and the president's power to impound
funds could complicate finishing work on the bill
before the Wednesday deadline.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) was the chief sponsor
of the Democratic amendment that went down
yesterday. Hart, declaring that Reagan's "econom
ic recovery" program was "in desperate need of
recovery" by Congress, proposed that the three
year, 25 percent income-tax cut be deferred until
the federal budget was balanced.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), who moved to table the amend
ment, said Congress should not give Reagan's pro
gram "a burial before the birth." Hart's amend
ment, he said, was merely "a back-door approach
to increase spending ... If we don't cut taxes, we'll
have more spending programs to deal with and we
won't balance the budget."
Reagan speaks on crime
New Orleans — President Ronald Reagan said
yesterday the answer to crime isn't in "the social
worker's files, the psychiatrist's notes, or bureau
cratic budgets," and endorsed proposals to limit
bail, ease tne margin for police error and set man
datory prison terms for felonies committed with
guns.
In his first address focusing on crime — which he
called "an American epidemic" — the president
outlined a program intended to overcome "a
breakdown in the criminal justice system in Ameri
ca (that) just plain isn't working."
Speaking to the annual meeting of the Interna
tional Association of Chiefs of Police, Reagan com
mended law enforcement officers as ' the thin
blue line that holds back a jungle that threatens to
reclaim the clearing we call civilization."
Reagan, applauded by his audience more than
two dozen times, specifically endorsed recom

mendations which, in his words, would:
— Seek to restore the balance "between rights
of the accused and rights of the innocent" through
"sweeping revision" of the federal criminal laws;
— Support bail reform, allowing judges "under
carefully limited conditions ... to keep some de
fendants from using bail to return to the streets";
— Support mandatory prison terms for anyone
carrying a gun while committing a felony;
— Support legislation allowing judges to order
offenders to repay victims. "The victims of crime
have needed a voice for a long, long time. This ad
ministration means to provide it,"he said.
Weinberger speaks on AWACS
Washington — The United States could control
Saudi Arabia's use of AWACS radar planes for sev
eral years even without formal restrictions, Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Defending the administration's proposal to sell
five of the planes to the Mideast oil power, Wein
berger saia the Saudis would need help with train
ing and maintenance for nearly a decade to keep
the planes flying.
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said such reliance on U]S] technical help
would continue "well into the 19905." At another
point, Jones said, "We will be involved as far as we
can see in the future."
Jones conceded under questioning from mem
bers of the Senate Armed Services Committee that
once the planes are delivered, the Saudia Arabian
goverment "could tell the Americans to get lost."
But he said "it would be foolhardy for them" to
do that, because they would need American ad
vice and training to keep the planes in the air.
The AWACS planes are primarily designed for
early detection of enemy warplanes, but critics of
the sale say putting them in Saudi hands would tilt
the balance of military in the Middle East in favor
of Arab nations, and place Israel at a disadvantage.
The testimony offered by Weinberger and Jones
was the first formal defense of the sale before Con
gress and came as it was becoming apparent eflorts
to find a compromise designed to overcome over
whelming Senate resistance to the sale was un
raveling.
Dissident Poles speak out
Gdansk —The Polish dissident group KOR[ de
fending itself astruly socialist, disbanded yesterday
in an apparent attempt to mollify the angry Com
munist Party. But the official Communist press
viewed the action as a diversion and said the dissi
dents would simply continue to work from inside
the independent union Solidarity.
At the Solidarity congress, in its second day here,
Jacek Kuron, leader of KOR — Committee for So
cial Self-Defense, said "KOR has fulfilled its func
tion . . . Now with Solidarity on the scene, it is su
perflous."
To thunderous applause, 93-year-old economist
Edward Lipinski contended that socialism had
been "destroying us for 30 years," and said "it is
this socialism that is anti-socialist and counter-rev
olutionary."
In recent weeks official Soviet press attacks on
Solidarity have been increasingly heated, accusing
union activists of being "anti-Soviet" and "coun
ter-revolutionary."
Solidarity, the only independent union in the
Soviet bloc, has brought about a liberalization that
angered the Soviet Union and other Communist
neighbors at a time when Poland is caught in se
vere economic trouble. And at the first phase of its
congress two weeks ago, the union announced
that it would support tne spread of independent
unionism to other East bloc countries — infuriating
the Kremlin.
Haig and Gromyko hold talks
United Nations — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
met yesterday for the second time in a week to dis
cuss prospects for reducing tensions between the
two superpowers.
Both men, dressed in gray suits and sitting side
by-side on a red couch, appeared in a relaxed
mood as the talks got underway at the Soviet Mis
sion to the United Nations. Both men joked that
they expected a long session.
U]S] officials said tney hoped Haig and Gromyko
could make progress toward defining the scope of
nuclear arms talks scheduled to begin in Geneva
Nov. 30.
A U]S] official, who did not want to be identified,
indicated the first meeting was primarily an op
portunity for each side to determine first-nand the

positions of the other on the issues. He said the
second meeting would determine whether any
progress could be made in easing tensions.
The United States wants the initial focus to be on
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The So
viet Union now has about 180 missiles targeted on
Europe, and the United States plans to begin
deploying 572 cruise and Pershing II missiles be
ginning in 1983.
The Soviet Union is known to favor a broader
scope for the talks to include U]S] nuclear-armed
aircraft in Europe.
Executions continue in Iran
Tehran — Iranian authorities executed 110 dissi
dents Sunday and yesterday for political crimes,
Radio Tehran reported yesterday.
The radio broadcast here said that 57 persons in
volved in Sunday's anti-government demonstra
tions in Tehran were executed yesterday, and 53
left-wing Peoples Mujahedeen were executed
Sunday in Ispahan, capital of the central Iranian
piovince of the same name, for rebellion, ter
rorism, murder and attacks on revoutionary
guards.
The leftists were accused of possessing arms and
exposives, taking part in demonstrations and street
battles and plotting against the Islamic republic.
The newspaper also published an interview with
the revolutionary chief prosecutor, Hojataesam
Hossein Mussavi Tabrizi, in which he said that any
one attempting to create a breach of the peace
during next Friday's presidential election would be
executed immediately.
The prosecutor said the bloody demonstations
in Tehran Sunday, in which 22 people were killed
and 40 wounded, were a result of opposition at
tempts to break the morale of the population ev
ery time a military victory was won in the war
against Iraq.
The Iranian parliament speaker, Hojatolesam
Hasahemi Refsaniani, charged yesterday that the
Mujahedeen haa called the Sunday demonstra
tions on hearings of the Abadan victory "in order
to dampen the psychological effects of this suc
cess."
US to stay in El Salvador
Washington — Despite earlier suggestions that
US advisers would be out of El Salvador by Septem
ber, Reagan administration officials are now pre
dicting a long-term American military presence in
the war-torn Central American nation.
Lt. Col. Jerry Grohowski, a Pentagon spokesman,
said US military advisers will remain in El Salvador
for the "foreseeable future" as that country's mili
tary-civilian junta continues its war against leftist
insurgents.
Last week, Thomas O] Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, told a House
committee that "we expect to continue to send
trainers to El Salvador to meet particular needsthat
may arise."
"Numbers will increase again, but we do not an
ticipate that the numbers will grow beyond the
hign mark of our effort this year."
Grohowski said there are now 31 non-combat
US advisers in El Salvador, down from 56, the
number of advisers dispatched last March when
the Reagan administration vowed to "draw the
line" against "communist aggression" in the small,
impoverished country.
The continued US military presence comes de
spite a Defense Department statement last March
that US advisers would be brought home by Sep
tember. In that statement, however, the Pentagon
left open the possibility that "some others might
be sent in."
Market recovers
Stock prices turned higher today after recover
ing from an early steep and widespread decline in
the aftermath of one of the worst one-day price
drops on London and Tokyo markets.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
sank more than 14 points within the first 30 minutes
of trading, gradually recouped and was up 7.04
points to 831.05 with two trading hours left.
Two issues fell for every one that rose on the
New York Stock Exchange, but declines had led
advances by a 23-1 edge early in the session.
Big Board volume was 41.70 million shares.
Today's weather
— Variable clouds today and mostly fair tomor
row. Lows in the low 50s tonight. Highs in the 70s
today and into the low 80s tomorrow. Northwest
winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons and evenings.

in an apparent attempt to mollify the angry Com
munist Party. But the official Communist press
viewed the action as a diversion and said the dissi
dents would simply continue to work from inside
the independent union Solidarity.
At the Solidarity congress, in its second day here,
Jacek Kuron, leader of KOR — Committee for So
cial Self-Defense, said "KOR has fulfilled its func
tion . . . Now with Solidarity on the scene, it is su
perflous."
To thunderous applause, 93-year-old economist
Edward Lipinski contended that socialism had
been "destroying us for 30 years," and said "it is
this socialism that is anti-socialist and counter-rev
olutionary."
In recent weeks official Soviet press attacks on
Solidarity have been increasingly heated, accusing
union activists of being "anti-Soviet" and "coun
ter-revolutionary."
Solidarity, the only independent union in the
Soviet bloc, has brought about a liberalization that
angered the Soviet Union and other Communist
neighbors at a time when Poland is caught in se
vere economic trouble. And at the first phase of its
congress two weeks ago, the union announced
that it would support tne spread of independent
unionism to other East bloc countries — infuriating
the Kremlin.
Haig and Gromyko hold talks
United Nations — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
met yesterday for the second time in a week to dis
cuss prospects for reducing tensions between the
two superpowers.
Both men, dressed in gray suits and sitting side
by-side on a red couch, appeared in a relaxed
mood as the talks got underway at the Soviet Mis
sion to the United Nations. Both men joked that
they expected a long session.
U]S] officials said tney hoped Haig and Gromyko
could make progress toward defining the scope of
nuclear arms talks scheduled to begin in Geneva
Nov. 30.
A U]S] official, who did not want to be identified,
indicated the first meeting was primarily an op
portunity for each side to determine first-nand the

positions of the other on the issues. He said the
second meeting would determine whether any
progress could be made in easing tensions.
The United States wants the initial focus to be on
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The So
viet Union now has about 180 missiles targeted on
Europe, and the United States plans to begin
deploying 572 cruise and Pershing II missiles be
ginning in 1983.
The Soviet Union is known to favor a broader
scope for the talks to include U]S] nuclear-armed
aircraft in Europe.
Executions continue in Iran
Tehran — Iranian authorities executed 110 dissi
dents Sunday and yesterday for political crimes,
Radio Tehran reported yesterday.
The radio broadcast here said that 57 persons in
volved in Sunday's anti-government demonstra
tions in Tehran were executed yesterday, and 53
left-wing Peoples Mujahedeen were executed
Sunday in Ispahan, capital of the central Iranian
piovince of the same name, for rebellion, ter
rorism, murder and attacks on revoutionary
guards.
The leftists were accused of possessing arms and
exposives, taking part in demonstrations and street
battles and plotting against the Islamic republic.
The newspaper also published an interview with
the revolutionary chief prosecutor, Hojataesam
Hossein Mussavi Tabrizi, in which he said that any
one attempting to create a breach of the peace
during next Friday's presidential election would be
executed immediately.
The prosecutor said the bloody demonstations
in Tehran Sunday, in which 22 people were killed
and 40 wounded, were a result of opposition at
tempts to break the morale of the population ev
ery time a military victory was won in the war
against Iraq.
The Iranian parliament speaker, Hojatolesam
Hasahemi Refsaniani, charged yesterday that the
Mujahedeen haa called the Sunday demonstra
tions on hearings of the Abadan victory "in order
to dampen the psychological effects of this suc
cess."
US to stay in El Salvador
Washington — Despite earlier suggestions that
US advisers would be out of El Salvador by Septem
ber, Reagan administration officials are now pre
dicting a long-term American military presence in
the war-torn Central American nation.
Lt. Col. Jerry Grohowski, a Pentagon spokesman,
said US military advisers will remain in El Salvador
for the "foreseeable future" as that country's mili
tary-civilian junta continues its war against leftist
insurgents.
Last week, Thomas O] Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, told a House
committee that "we expect to continue to send
trainers to El Salvador to meet particular needsthat
may arise."
"Numbers will increase again, but we do not an
ticipate that the numbers will grow beyond the
hign mark of our effort this year."
Grohowski said there are now 31 non-combat
US advisers in El Salvador, down from 56, the
number of advisers dispatched last March when
the Reagan administration vowed to "draw the
line" against "communist aggression" in the small,
impoverished country.
The continued US military presence comes de
spite a Defense Department statement last March
that US advisers would be brought home by Sep
tember. In that statement, however, the Pentagon
left open the possibility that "some others might
be sent in."
Market recovers
Stock prices turned higher today after recover

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which

Bear turns bull on Wall Street
New York —The depressed stock market staged
a dramatic rally Monday, allaying fears of a crisis as
markets in London and around tne world plunged.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
began the week at its lowest level in more than a
year, tumbled almost 15 points in early trading,
But then it turned upward, gathering momen
tum as it went. By the close of trading the widely
recognized yardstick of market trends stood at
842.56, up 18.55 on the day.
That gloom-to-euphoria turnaround contrasted
sharply with the news from most foreign markets,
which were battered by selling amid what one ana
lyst described as talk of "a world-wide recession."
In London, a sharp decline in share prices that
began about two weeks ago intensified. "Mass hys
teria," said a broker who declined to be identified.
Japan's stock market took its biggest drop on
record, and prices also fell sharply in financial cen
ters from Sydney, Australia and Singapore to
Frankfurt, West Germany.
The New York market's rebound came as a relief
to traders who had been watching the Dow Jones
industrial average fall more than 200 points since
last spring. On April 27, it stood at an eight-year
high of 1,024.05.
Joseph Granville, the controversial market fore
caster, had been quoted in Paris late last week as
saying Monday would "go down in financial his
tory as 'Blue Monday.'"
However, trading activity during the day never
reached the pace ot the silver crisis in early 1980 in
volving the Hunt brothers of Texas, or of tne 23.80-
point drop last Jan. 7 when Granville urged his fol
lowers to "sell everything."
That day a record 92.89 million shares were
traded on the NYSE Monday's volume, by a pre
liminary estimate, came to 61.80 million shares.
"There's no panic," said William Ramsay, a
trader with Colin, Hochstin Co., on the New York
Stock Exchange floor Monday morning.
Senate tables tax bill
Washington — The Republican-controlled Sen
ate yesterday easily crushed attempts by liberal
and moderate Democrats to defer the recently
enacted tax reduction.
The Senate tabled, and thus killed, the tax-cut
proposal, 74 to 13.
Tne proposals were offered as amendments to
politically volatile legislation that would shove the
ceiling on government borrowing above $1 trillion
for the first time in history.
The present debt ceiling of $985 billion will ex
pire tomorrow. The Senate will try to finish the bill
today and quickly resolve any differences with the
House in a conference committee. But passage of
pending Senate amendments dealing with Social
Security and the president's power to impound
funds could complicate finishing work on the bill
before the Wednesday deadline.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) was the chief sponsor
of the Democratic amendment that went down
yesterday. Hart, declaring that Reagan's "econom
ic recovery" program was "in desperate need of
recovery" by Congress, proposed that the three
year, 25 percent income-tax cut be deferred until
the federal budget was balanced.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), who moved to table the amend
ment, said Congress should not give Reagan's pro
gram "a burial before the birth." Hart's amend
ment, he said, was merely "a back-door approach
to increase spending ... If we don't cut taxes, we'll
have more spending programs to deal with and we
won't balance the budget."
Reagan speaks on crime
New Orleans — President Ronald Reagan said
yesterday the answer to crime isn't in "the social
worker's files, the psychiatrist's notes, or bureau
cratic budgets," and endorsed proposals to limit
bail, ease tne margin for police error and set man
datory prison terms for felonies committed with
guns.
In his first address focusing on crime — which he
called "an American epidemic" — the president
outlined a program intended to overcome "a
breakdown in the criminal justice system in Ameri
ca (that) just plain isn't working."
Speaking to the annual meeting of the Interna
tional Association of Chiefs of Police, Reagan com
mended law enforcement officers as ' the thin
blue line that holds back a jungle that threatens to
reclaim the clearing we call civilization."
Reagan, applauded by his audience more than
two dozen times, specifically endorsed recom

mendations which, in his words, would:
— Seek to restore the balance "between rights
of the accused and rights of the innocent" through
"sweeping revision" of the federal criminal laws;
— Support bail reform, allowing judges "under
carefully limited conditions ... to keep some de
fendants from using bail to return to the streets";
— Support mandatory prison terms for anyone
carrying a gun while committing a felony;
— Support legislation allowing judges to order
offenders to repay victims. "The victims of crime
have needed a voice for a long, long time. This ad
ministration means to provide it,"he said.
Weinberger speaks on AWACS
Washington — The United States could control
Saudi Arabia's use of AWACS radar planes for sev
eral years even without formal restrictions, Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Defending the administration's proposal to sell
five of the planes to the Mideast oil power, Wein
berger saia the Saudis would need help with train
ing and maintenance for nearly a decade to keep
the planes flying.
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said such reliance on U]S] technical help
would continue "well into the 19905." At another
point, Jones said, "We will be involved as far as we
can see in the future."
Jones conceded under questioning from mem
bers of the Senate Armed Services Committee that
once the planes are delivered, the Saudia Arabian
goverment "could tell the Americans to get lost."
But he said "it would be foolhardy for them" to
do that, because they would need American ad
vice and training to keep the planes in the air.
The AWACS planes are primarily designed for
early detection of enemy warplanes, but critics of
the sale say putting them in Saudi hands would tilt
the balance of military in the Middle East in favor
of Arab nations, and place Israel at a disadvantage.
The testimony offered by Weinberger and Jones
was the first formal defense of the sale before Con
gress and came as it was becoming apparent eflorts
to find a compromise designed to overcome over
whelming Senate resistance to the sale was un
raveling.

Senate tables tax bill
Washington — The Republican-controlled Sen
ate yesterday easily crushed attempts by liberal
and moderate Democrats to defer the recently
enacted tax reduction.
The Senate tabled, and thus killed, the tax-cut
proposal, 74 to 13.
Tne proposals were offered as amendments to
politically volatile legislation that would shove the
ceiling on government borrowing above $1 trillion
for the first time in history.
The present debt ceiling of $985 billion will ex
pire tomorrow. The Senate will try to finish the bill
today and quickly resolve any differences with the
House in a conference committee. But passage of
pending Senate amendments dealing with Social
Security and the president's power to impound
funds could complicate finishing work on the bill
before the Wednesday deadline.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) was the chief sponsor
of the Democratic amendment that went down
yesterday. Hart, declaring that Reagan's "econom
ic recovery" program was "in desperate need of
recovery" by Congress, proposed that the three
year, 25 percent income-tax cut be deferred until
the federal budget was balanced.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), who moved to table the amend
ment, said Congress should not give Reagan's pro
gram "a burial before the birth." Hart's amend
ment, he said, was merely "a back-door approach
to increase spending ... If we don't cut taxes, we'll
have more spending programs to deal with and we
won't balance the budget."
Reagan speaks on crime
New Orleans — President Ronald Reagan said
yesterday the answer to crime isn't in "the social
worker's files, the psychiatrist's notes, or bureau
cratic budgets," and endorsed proposals to limit
bail, ease tne margin for police error and set man
datory prison terms for felonies committed with
guns.
In his first address focusing on crime — which he
called "an American epidemic" — the president
outlined a program intended to overcome "a
breakdown in the criminal justice system in Ameri
ca (that) just plain isn't working."
Speaking to the annual meeting of the Interna
tional Association of Chiefs of Police, Reagan com
mended law enforcement officers as ' the thin
blue line that holds back a jungle that threatens to
reclaim the clearing we call civilization."
Reagan, applauded by his audience more than
two dozen times, specifically endorsed recom

mendations which, in his words, would:
— Seek to restore the balance "between rights
of the accused and rights of the innocent" through
"sweeping revision" of the federal criminal laws;
— Support bail reform, allowing judges "under
carefully limited conditions ... to keep some de
fendants from using bail to return to the streets";
— Support mandatory prison terms for anyone
carrying a gun while committing a felony;
— Support legislation allowing judges to order
offenders to repay victims. "The victims of crime
have needed a voice for a long, long time. This ad
ministration means to provide it,"he said.
Weinberger speaks on AWACS
Washington — The United States could control
Saudi Arabia's use of AWACS radar planes for sev
eral years even without formal restrictions, Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Defending the administration's proposal to sell
five of the planes to the Mideast oil power, Wein
berger saia the Saudis would need help with train
ing and maintenance for nearly a decade to keep
the planes flying.
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said such reliance on U]S] technical help
would continue "well into the 19905." At another
point, Jones said, "We will be involved as far as we
can see in the future."
Jones conceded under questioning from mem
bers of the Senate Armed Services Committee that
once the planes are delivered, the Saudia Arabian
goverment "could tell the Americans to get lost."
But he said "it would be foolhardy for them" to
do that, because they would need American ad
vice and training to keep the planes in the air.
The AWACS planes are primarily designed for
early detection of enemy warplanes, but critics of
the sale say putting them in Saudi hands would tilt
the balance of military in the Middle East in favor
of Arab nations, and place Israel at a disadvantage.
The testimony offered by Weinberger and Jones
was the first formal defense of the sale before Con
gress and came as it was becoming apparent eflorts
to find a compromise designed to overcome over
whelming Senate resistance to the sale was un
raveling.
Dissident Poles speak out
Gdansk —The Polish dissident group KOR[ de
fending itself astruly socialist, disbanded yesterday
in an apparent attempt to mollify the angry Com
munist Party. But the official Communist press
viewed the action as a diversion and said the dissi
dents would simply continue to work from inside
the independent union Solidarity.
At the Solidarity congress, in its second day here,
Jacek Kuron, leader of KOR — Committee for So
cial Self-Defense, said "KOR has fulfilled its func
tion . . . Now with Solidarity on the scene, it is su
perflous."
To thunderous applause, 93-year-old economist
Edward Lipinski contended that socialism had
been "destroying us for 30 years," and said "it is
this socialism that is anti-socialist and counter-rev
olutionary."
In recent weeks official Soviet press attacks on
Solidarity have been increasingly heated, accusing
union activists of being "anti-Soviet" and "coun
ter-revolutionary."
Solidarity, the only independent union in the
Soviet bloc, has brought about a liberalization that
angered the Soviet Union and other Communist
neighbors at a time when Poland is caught in se
vere economic trouble. And at the first phase of its
congress two weeks ago, the union announced
that it would support tne spread of independent
unionism to other East bloc countries — infuriating
the Kremlin.
Haig and Gromyko hold talks
United Nations — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
met yesterday for the second time in a week to dis
cuss prospects for reducing tensions between the
two superpowers.
Both men, dressed in gray suits and sitting side
by-side on a red couch, appeared in a relaxed
mood as the talks got underway at the Soviet Mis
sion to the United Nations. Both men joked that
they expected a long session.
U]S] officials said tney hoped Haig and Gromyko
could make progress toward defining the scope of
nuclear arms talks scheduled to begin in Geneva
Nov. 30.
A U]S] official, who did not want to be identified,
indicated the first meeting was primarily an op
portunity for each side to determine first-nand the

positions of the other on the issues. He said the
second meeting would determine whether any
progress could be made in easing tensions.
The United States wants the initial focus to be on
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The So
viet Union now has about 180 missiles targeted on
Europe, and the United States plans to begin
deploying 572 cruise and Pershing II missiles be
ginning in 1983.
The Soviet Union is known to favor a broader
scope for the talks to include U]S] nuclear-armed
aircraft in Europe.
Executions continue in Iran
Tehran — Iranian authorities executed 110 dissi
dents Sunday and yesterday for political crimes,
Radio Tehran reported yesterday.
The radio broadcast here said that 57 persons in
volved in Sunday's anti-government demonstra
tions in Tehran were executed yesterday, and 53
left-wing Peoples Mujahedeen were executed
Sunday in Ispahan, capital of the central Iranian
piovince of the same name, for rebellion, ter
rorism, murder and attacks on revoutionary
guards.
The leftists were accused of possessing arms and
exposives, taking part in demonstrations and street
battles and plotting against the Islamic republic.
The newspaper also published an interview with
the revolutionary chief prosecutor, Hojataesam
Hossein Mussavi Tabrizi, in which he said that any
one attempting to create a breach of the peace
during next Friday's presidential election would be
executed immediately.
The prosecutor said the bloody demonstations
in Tehran Sunday, in which 22 people were killed
and 40 wounded, were a result of opposition at
tempts to break the morale of the population ev
ery time a military victory was won in the war
against Iraq.
The Iranian parliament speaker, Hojatolesam
Hasahemi Refsaniani, charged yesterday that the
Mujahedeen haa called the Sunday demonstra
tions on hearings of the Abadan victory "in order
to dampen the psychological effects of this suc
cess."
US to stay in El Salvador
Washington — Despite earlier suggestions that
US advisers would be out of El Salvador by Septem
ber, Reagan administration officials are now pre
dicting a long-term American military presence in
the war-torn Central American nation.
Lt. Col. Jerry Grohowski, a Pentagon spokesman,
said US military advisers will remain in El Salvador
for the "foreseeable future" as that country's mili
tary-civilian junta continues its war against leftist
insurgents.
Last week, Thomas O] Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, told a House
committee that "we expect to continue to send
trainers to El Salvador to meet particular needsthat
may arise."
"Numbers will increase again, but we do not an
ticipate that the numbers will grow beyond the
hign mark of our effort this year."
Grohowski said there are now 31 non-combat
US advisers in El Salvador, down from 56, the
number of advisers dispatched last March when
the Reagan administration vowed to "draw the
line" against "communist aggression" in the small,
impoverished country.
The continued US military presence comes de
spite a Defense Department statement last March
that US advisers would be brought home by Sep
tember. In that statement, however, the Pentagon
left open the possibility that "some others might
be sent in."
Market recovers
Stock prices turned higher today after recover

Two issues fell for every one that rose on the
New York Stock Exchange, but declines had led

tion . . . Now with Solidarity on the scene, it is su
perflous."
To thunderous applause, 93-year-old economist
Edward Lipinski contended that socialism had
been "destroying us for 30 years," and said "it is
this socialism that is anti-socialist and counter-rev
olutionary."
In recent weeks official Soviet press attacks on
Solidarity have been increasingly heated, accusing
union activists of being "anti-Soviet" and "coun
ter-revolutionary."
Solidarity, the only independent union in the
Soviet bloc, has brought about a liberalization that
angered the Soviet Union and other Communist
neighbors at a time when Poland is caught in se
vere economic trouble. And at the first phase of its
congress two weeks ago, the union announced
that it would support tne spread of independent
unionism to other East bloc countries — infuriating
the Kremlin.
Haig and Gromyko hold talks
United Nations — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
met yesterday for the second time in a week to dis
cuss prospects for reducing tensions between the
two superpowers.
Both men, dressed in gray suits and sitting side
by-side on a red couch, appeared in a relaxed
mood as the talks got underway at the Soviet Mis
sion to the United Nations. Both men joked that
they expected a long session.
U]S] officials said tney hoped Haig and Gromyko
could make progress toward defining the scope of
nuclear arms talks scheduled to begin in Geneva
Nov. 30.
A U]S] official, who did not want to be identified,
indicated the first meeting was primarily an op
portunity for each side to determine first-nand the

positions of the other on the issues. He said the
second meeting would determine whether any
progress could be made in easing tensions.
The United States wants the initial focus to be on
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The So
viet Union now has about 180 missiles targeted on
Europe, and the United States plans to begin
deploying 572 cruise and Pershing II missiles be
ginning in 1983.
The Soviet Union is known to favor a broader
scope for the talks to include U]S] nuclear-armed
aircraft in Europe.
Executions continue in Iran
Tehran — Iranian authorities executed 110 dissi
dents Sunday and yesterday for political crimes,
Radio Tehran reported yesterday.
The radio broadcast here said that 57 persons in
volved in Sunday's anti-government demonstra
tions in Tehran were executed yesterday, and 53
left-wing Peoples Mujahedeen were executed
Sunday in Ispahan, capital of the central Iranian
piovince of the same name, for rebellion, ter
rorism, murder and attacks on revoutionary
guards.
The leftists were accused of possessing arms and
exposives, taking part in demonstrations and street
battles and plotting against the Islamic republic.
The newspaper also published an interview with
the revolutionary chief prosecutor, Hojataesam
Hossein Mussavi Tabrizi, in which he said that any
one attempting to create a breach of the peace
during next Friday's presidential election would be
executed immediately.
The prosecutor said the bloody demonstations
in Tehran Sunday, in which 22 people were killed
and 40 wounded, were a result of opposition at
tempts to break the morale of the population ev
ery time a military victory was won in the war
against Iraq.
The Iranian parliament speaker, Hojatolesam
Hasahemi Refsaniani, charged yesterday that the
Mujahedeen haa called the Sunday demonstra
tions on hearings of the Abadan victory "in order
to dampen the psychological effects of this suc
cess."
US to stay in El Salvador
Washington — Despite earlier suggestions that
US advisers would be out of El Salvador by Septem
ber, Reagan administration officials are now pre
dicting a long-term American military presence in
the war-torn Central American nation.
Lt. Col. Jerry Grohowski, a Pentagon spokesman,
said US military advisers will remain in El Salvador
for the "foreseeable future" as that country's mili
tary-civilian junta continues its war against leftist
insurgents.
Last week, Thomas O] Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, told a House
committee that "we expect to continue to send
trainers to El Salvador to meet particular needsthat
may arise."
"Numbers will increase again, but we do not an
ticipate that the numbers will grow beyond the
hign mark of our effort this year."
Grohowski said there are now 31 non-combat
US advisers in El Salvador, down from 56, the
number of advisers dispatched last March when
the Reagan administration vowed to "draw the
line" against "communist aggression" in the small,
impoverished country.
The continued US military presence comes de
spite a Defense Department statement last March
that US advisers would be brought home by Sep
tember. In that statement, however, the Pentagon
left open the possibility that "some others might
be sent in."
