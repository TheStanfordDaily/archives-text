### Joan O'Connell 
A registration packet ad for the
Oct. 4 Pablo Cruise concert prepared
by the Stanford Chapparal nas been
puzzling some students on campus
this week, as "canceled" appears on
its face.
However, the word from Margot
Nelson, director of the Student
Alumni Network, which was sponsor
ing the concert, is that the ad was not
another of the Chappie's famous
pranks — Pablo Cruise drummer
Steve Price indeed broke his wrist
Sept. 17 and the concert has been
canceled.
Students in Memorial Auditorium
yesterday were remarking, "Is this for
real? It's probably just a joke." But
Nelson confirmed yesterday that the

group has canceled their appearance
next weekend and, in fact, all of their
tours until Nov. 20.
"Unfortunately, Frost is a problem
later in the year because of rain and I
don't think group concerts work too
well in Mem Aud. We'll probably just
hold off on trying to hold another
concert until the spring," she said.
The Pablo Cruise concert was to
"bring concerts back to Frost," ac
cording to advertisements, as it was
the first concert to be promoted here
since ASSU's Special Events was
abolished last fall due to tremendous
losses.
Nelson did say that her group was
definitely planning to promote an
other concert.
