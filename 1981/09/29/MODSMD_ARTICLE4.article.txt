# Students facing loan cuts
##

The economic medicine administered by Presi
dent Ronald Reagan to the federal budget has un
fortunately had a few side effects on federal aid
programs.
An increasing number of students are asking,
"Am I still eligible for a loan?" as it becomes more
difficult to find the money to pay the bills around
here.
Changes in GSI, NDSL and BEOG (now Pell
grants) — probably the most used form of financial
aid — should be noted and if needed, discussed
with a counselor in the financial aids office.
The GSL program has changed in two ways: loan
origination fees and new eligibility requirements.
Tne student borrower will be required to pay a
one-time, up-front fee of five percent of the loan
The fee is deducted from the check before you
even see it and is used to offset the in-school in
terest subsidy. The interest rate on these loans has
gone from 7 to 9 percent, with the grace period
(time allowed after graduation before payments
become due) shortened from nine to six months.
As a dependent of your parents, the top loan is
$2500. If you have an independent tax status, the
limit is $3000. Graduate students can get up to
$5000. The origination fee applies to all loans de
livered on or after Sept. 24.
The most significant change is the family income
ceiling. Only students whose gross adjusted family

income is $30,000 or less will automatically qualify.
Those with higher family incomes will have to
demonstrate need under a test devised by the Sec
retary of Education. Using an "effective family con
tribution chart," the test takes into account how
many of your brothers and sisters are attending
similar institutions of higher learning.
Acting Dean of Admissions John Bunnell ex
plained that admissions policy will continue to be
indifferent to the applicant's financial need. Loan
Officer Roberta Johnson added that 55 percent of
the student body is on some kind of financial a<d.
"We try to match the state and federal grants end
loans witn University scholarships, long-term loans
and employment opportunity" Bunnell said.
The financial aid picture is indeed complicated
and anagrams often add to the confusion. BEOG
used to stand for Basic Educational Opportunity
Grant and now has been changed to the Pell
grants. The funds are still provided by the federal
govrnment and a notary public must verify that any
such funds you received will be used for room,
board or books; in other owrds, school-related ex
penses.
The National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) makes
federal funds available to students whose family
income is less than $20,000 and whose family assets
are less than $100,000.
Grants come labeled everything from Stanford
Undergraduate to Boy Scouts of America. Also,
alumni endow scholarships that perpetuate on in

terest paid to the university for long-term loans.
These vary from year to year and ned not be re
paid.
The self-help factor is the amount the student
contributes through a combination of loan and
part-time job opportunity. This facet of the pro
gram flexes with individual need; therefore it is
possible to adjust the number of hours and the
amount of loan to fit your study schedule.
This year, each student was expected to con
tribute $900 in summer earnings to the kitty. They
say everyone can earn something, but if you've
been seduced into interning for no pay in a re
search lab or newsroom, there is another form to
request: a summer earnings waiver.
Fortunately, too, for those wanting to spend a
quarter or two in Salamanca or perhaps Cliveden,
the added cost need not ruin your plans. The fi
nancial aids people are generally able to work out
arrangements allowing for overseas study.
If you fall into that middle income category
where your parents income exceeds $30,000, you
might want to seriously consider going independ
ent. It takes planning, but may be worth it in the
long run. Arrange to declare yourself a tax exemp
tion and see to it that your parents don't contribute
more than $1000 towards your yearly living ex
penses. If you don't live with your parents for more
than six weeks per year, you're well on your way to
the independent status.
