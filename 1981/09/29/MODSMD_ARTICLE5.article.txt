## Hostile attitudes imperil US-Soviet arms summit 
### 
from the Daily wire setvices
In one sense the Soviet-American agreement
last week to begin negotiations on nuclear
weapons in Europe represents a major break
through: it is the first cooperative decision be
tween the Reagan administration and the
Kremlin. After months of hostile rhetoric and no
high-level contacts, the two superpowers finally
will begin substantive arms negotiations.
However, there are strong indications that in
agreeing to begin these talks both the United
States and Soviet Union are motivated by factors
other than arms control.
The Reagan administration, having been bat
tered by public opinion in Europe and witness
ing what many experts believe is the most seri
ous strain in the NATO alliance since its incep
tion, knows it must give the impression that it is
interested in arms control. Therefore, even
while its chief policy-makers admit that they
have profound doubts that arms-control nego
tiations can work, they are now moving ahead.
The Soviets, having already made great strides
with detente in Europe even while it dies on the
vine here, want to continue to exploit the dif
ferences in the alliance and prevent the deploy
ment of a new generation of nuclear weapons
aimed at at the Soviet heartland. And so they,
too, are ready to sit down in Geneva.
• Whereas the Nixon and Ford administrations,
under Henry Kisinger, and the Carter adminis
tration, under Cyrus Vance, saw arms nego
tiations as the centerpiece of Soviet-American
relations, the Reagan administraiion has re
peatedly said that the international community
nas overestimated the value of arms control in
affecting Soviet behavior and promoting peace.
Most arms-control experts believe that
achieving an agreement to limit nuclear weap
ons in Europe — called theater nuclear forces —
will be even harder than it was to reach an agree
ment on limiting strategic nuclear weapons in
the SALT II accord. That treaty, which took three
administrations and seven years to negotiate,
has not been approved by the Senate and is re
jected by the Reagan administration.
The arms-control experts ask how any
progress can be made on theater nuclear forces
when the Reagan administration has not even
established a position on strategic-arms nego
tiations and the future of SALT 111 Limitations on

theater weapons are directly related to an agree
ment on strategic weapons, and the technical
problems involving issues such as verification
are far more difficult.
The talks on theater nuclear weapons will be
gin in November, but until the overall context of
Soviet-American relations changes, an agree
ment seems distant.
The competition for public opinion in Europe
was in evidence at the United Nations last Mon
day, when Secretary of State Alexander Haig
caught Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
off balance by soft-pedaling the anti-Soviet
rhetoric in his speech to the General Assembly.
Instead, he concentrated on the need for eco
nomic development in the Third World.
Western diplomats said the Soviets had ex
pected another rhetorical blast, probably similar
to the one Haig delivered just the week before in
Berlin.
On Tuesday, the text of Gromyko's speech to
the General Assembly was delayed, and Soviet
officials said parts of the foreign minister's
speech were being rewritten. Nonetheless,
Gromyko, who has been addressing the world
body for two decades, delivered the hard-line
version of his standard speech. The added lines
talked of the Soviets' desire for a cooperative re
lationship and stressed that the Kremlin did not
want a confrontation with Washington.
Just minutes after Gromyko finished speaking,
State Department spokesman Dean Fischer told
reporters that President Reagan had sent a con
ciliatory-sounding letter to Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev. The letter emphasized Wash
ington's desire for a peaceful relationship and
improved relations. That the Americans were
paraphrasing the letter even as Brezhnev was
reading it — instead of sending it ahead a week
in advance, as has been done before — was a
strong indication that this was more propaganda
than substance.
"It was a good performance by the Ameri
cans," said a high-ranking Western European
diplomat. "The Russians just can't react quickly.
Your administration is at least trying to give the
impression than it is not bent on confrontation
with the Soviets. That is what has worried many
of us."

reporters that President Reagan had sent a con
ciliatory-sounding letter to Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev. The letter emphasized Wash
ington's desire for a peaceful relationship and
improved relations. That the Americans were
paraphrasing the letter even as Brezhnev was
reading it — instead of sending it ahead a week
in advance, as has been done before — was a
strong indication that this was more propaganda
than substance.
"It was a good performance by the Ameri
cans," said a high-ranking Western European
diplomat. "The Russians just can't react quickly.
Your administration is at least trying to give the
impression than it is not bent on confrontation
with the Soviets. That is what has worried many
of us."
