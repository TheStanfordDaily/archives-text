# Despite potential for success
## III economy plagues Angola 
### Washington Post 
Luanda, Angola — Six years
after gaining its independence
from Portugal in a bloody war,
Angola is an economic disaster
area. Food is scarce, economic
production .has plummeted 10
Eercent in a decade, and the $2
illion in annual oil revenues is
being ploughed into the mili
tary budget to pay for an esti
mated 15,000 Cuban troops
and the two wars Angola is
fighting.
In Luanda, about 60 percent
of the stores are closed, and
many of those that are open
have little to sell.
Supplies are stalled while
dozens of ships wait to be un
loaded. In the banks and of
fices, work backs up behind
endless paperwork and absen
teeism.
At the airport, the runways
are decorated with hulks that
20 years ago were prop planes,
before they were left to rust.
"I've never seen any place
remotely comparable to
Angola," a Western diplomat
said. "Every part of the econo
my needs rehabilitation."
No lack of resources
With its vast natural re
sources, Angola has the poten
tial to be one of the two eco
nomic success stories in south
ern Africa, along with Zim
babwe, analysts say. Its rich oil
stores should place it second to
Nigeria in production within
black Africa next year, and the
country has enormous agricul
tural potential.
Its ports and railways could
be a key to the development of
southern Africa, giving the re
gion long-sought economic in

dependence from white-ruled
South Africa.
But before that kind of eco
nomic power can even be ap
proached, the country's Marx
ist rulers will have to overcome
a plethora of maladies that
have emaciated Angola ever
since the Portuguese aban
doned the country in 1975.
Some of the problems are
rooted in the centuries of colo
nial exploitation; others have
been created by Aneola s
strange relationships with East
and West and its constant wars.
The government's con
voluted bureaucracy, mean
while, appears only to be ag
gravating the situation, and
most observers here see little
prospect in the near future of
improvement for the country's
food problems or economic
underdevelopment.
Most trade with West
If anything, with East-West
tensions growing in the region,
the country's economic woes
could only grow worse. For
Angola depends on Western
investment, despite its Cuban
troopsand friendship pact with
the Soviet Union. Ironically,
the United States, which re
fuses to recognize Angola be
cause of the Soviet-Cuban mili
tary presence, is the country's
largest trade partner, receiving
most of Angola's $100 million
in annual exports of oil,
diamonds, and coffee.
Overall, about 70 percent of
Angola's trade is with the West
and only 7 percent with the East
Bloc.
Colonial exploitation
The Western investment,
largely a legacy of the Portu

guese rule, is perhaps the only
benefit Angola gained from
500 years of colonial domi
nation. Possibly more than any
other African colony, Angola
was exploited by its European
master, developed and used
entirely for the benefit of a na
tion that was itself economical
ly weak.
The result was that in 1960,
Angola remained so backward
that it had the lowest life ex
pectancy in the world, 33 years.
The child mortality rate was 49
percent.
"We didn't prepare these
people for independence," a
Portuguese resident admitted.
The departing Portuguese
stripped tne country of their
own equipment, and reported
ly engaged in some sabotage of
what was left. Many vehicles
were taken out of the country
and others were irnmobolizea,
plaguing Angola with a trans
portation problem that has yet
to be alleviated. Telephones
were ripped out and small but
vital equipment parts were re
moved. Instruction manuals
disappeared with Portuguese
technicians.
After defending his coun
try's rule briefly, one long-time
Portuguese resident here
sighed and conceded, "There
are good guys and bad guys.
We nad a lot of bad guys in
Angola."
Every day on the streets of
the capital, people who are not
standing in the long lines for
meat, other food items,
clothing, and cigarettes can be
found hunting for subsistence
in the black market.

many of those that are open
have little to sell.
Supplies are stalled while
dozens of ships wait to be un
loaded. In the banks and of
fices, work backs up behind
endless paperwork and absen
teeism.
At the airport, the runways

"I've never seen any place
remotely comparable to
Angola," a Western diplomat
said. "Every part of the econo
my needs rehabilitation."
No lack of resources
With its vast natural re
sources, Angola has the poten
tial to be one of the two eco
nomic success stories in south
ern Africa, along with Zim
babwe, analysts say. Its rich oil
stores should place it second to
Nigeria in production within
black Africa next year, and the
country has enormous agricul
tural potential.
Its ports and railways could
be a key to the development of
southern Africa, giving the re
gion long-sought economic in

dependence from white-ruled
South Africa.
But before that kind of eco
nomic power can even be ap
proached, the country's Marx
ist rulers will have to overcome
a plethora of maladies that
have emaciated Angola ever
since the Portuguese aban
doned the country in 1975.
Some of the problems are
rooted in the centuries of colo
nial exploitation; others have
been created by Aneola s
strange relationships with East
and West and its constant wars.
The government's con
voluted bureaucracy, mean
while, appears only to be ag
gravating the situation, and
most observers here see little
prospect in the near future of
improvement for the country's
food problems or economic
underdevelopment.
Most trade with West
If anything, with East-West
tensions growing in the region,
the country's economic woes
could only grow worse. For
Angola depends on Western
investment, despite its Cuban
troopsand friendship pact with
the Soviet Union. Ironically,
the United States, which re
fuses to recognize Angola be
cause of the Soviet-Cuban mili
tary presence, is the country's
largest trade partner, receiving
most of Angola's $100 million
in annual exports of oil,
diamonds, and coffee.
Overall, about 70 percent of
Angola's trade is with the West
and only 7 percent with the East
Bloc.
Colonial exploitation
The Western investment,
largely a legacy of the Portu

guese rule, is perhaps the only
benefit Angola gained from
500 years of colonial domi
nation. Possibly more than any
other African colony, Angola
was exploited by its European
master, developed and used
entirely for the benefit of a na
tion that was itself economical
ly weak.
The result was that in 1960,
Angola remained so backward
that it had the lowest life ex
pectancy in the world, 33 years.
The child mortality rate was 49
percent.
"We didn't prepare these
people for independence," a
Portuguese resident admitted.
The departing Portuguese
stripped tne country of their
own equipment, and reported
ly engaged in some sabotage of
what was left. Many vehicles
were taken out of the country
and others were irnmobolizea,
plaguing Angola with a trans
portation problem that has yet
to be alleviated. Telephones
were ripped out and small but
vital equipment parts were re
moved. Instruction manuals
disappeared with Portuguese
technicians.
After defending his coun
try's rule briefly, one long-time
Portuguese resident here
sighed and conceded, "There
are good guys and bad guys.
We nad a lot of bad guys in
Angola."
Every day on the streets of
the capital, people who are not
standing in the long lines for

clothing, and cigarettes can be
found hunting for subsistence
