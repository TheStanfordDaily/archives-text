# Sweden faces immigrant glut
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Stockholm, Sweden — Swe
den is usually perceived asa na
tion of 8 million blue-eyed,
fair-haired Nordics — all speak
ing Swedish.
But Sweden has become
something of a nation of immi
grants. About a million of its
people are either immigrants
or the children of immigrants.
Every fourth child now born
in Sweden is of foreign extrac
tion. And classes in the public
schools are taught in 70 dif
ferent languages, in addition to
Swedish.
The new immigrants, most of
them ethnically much different
from the Swedes, have serious
problems of adjustment, prob
lems that are a long way from
being solved.
"We Swedes thought we
were free of racist feelings,"
Erland Bergman, a member of
the Labor Ministry's Dis
crimination Commission, said
recently. "We found as time
went on that we were not so
different from everyone else,
and now we are trying to see
what we can do to improve
things.
In many ways, Sweden's im
migration policy has been ex
emplary. Foreign workers were
given the same rights as Swedes
to social benefits, education
and health services. Aliens who
resided in Sweden for three
years could even vote and run
for local and regional offices.
But the newcomers found
themselves in the hardest, low
est-paying jobs — jobs the
Swedes did not want.
The first great waves of immi
gration came during World
War II and consisted primarily
of refugees from other Nordic
and Baltic countries affected by
the fighting.
After the war, Swedish in
dustry, which had not been
damaged in the war because
Sweden was neutral, began re
cruiting workers from the Con
tinent. Thousands more came
in from other Nordic countries,
particularly Finland.
In the 19605, Sweden pros
pered. But as the economy has

slowed, Sweden has begun to
check the flow of immigants.
Now, except for citizens of Ice
land, Norway and Finland, for
eigners must have a hard-to
get labor permit before they
can immigrate.
Reviewing Sweden's immi
gration policies, David
Schwarz, a Polish-born, natu
ralized Swede who edits the
Journal of Immigrants in Mi
nority said:
"At the time of the first
waves of immigration, no one
gave much thought to the fact
that the families of the workers
would follow ... nor did peo
ple consider that there might
come a time when Sweden had
enough machines and workers
but not enough jobs. Such is
the situation today."
"Not only is tnere a large
proportion of immigrants in
certain low-status jobs,"
Schwarz said, "but they are also
stigmatized socially. Besides
the Greeks, the low-status
groups are the Finns, Turks and
Italians."
Many of the newcomers
from tne Mediterranean and
Asia Minor have brought with
them a totally different set of
cultural values. The cultural
differences have sometimes
flared into violence between
young Swedes and the for
eigners, who tend to con
gregate in ghettos.
Swedish officials believe that
ethnic consciousness should
be encouraged to reassure for
eigners that they are welcome
in Sweden.
Swedish law requires that
employers give their immi
grant employees 240 hours off
annually with pay so that they
may take free lessons in Swe
dish. Because of such programs
anda broad rangeof other wel
fare programs, the Swedish
worker is taxed at rates that
rank among the world's
highest.
Schwarz said, "The inability
of Swedes to communicate

with the immigrants has
proved to be fraught with oth
er serious consequences as
well. It has led to increased rad
icalization and politicizing of
the immigrant community."
Many of the foreigners do
not regard themselves as immi
grants but as long-term visitors
who will return home when
they have put enough money
aside. Thus they have nostrong
commitment to adopting Swe
dish values.
"The situation has already
gone so far that there is great
risk of its developing into a very
explosive and intractable social
problem," Schwarz said.
From there it is not such a
long step to the policy of
throwing out immigrants when
they are no longer needed in
Sweden."
