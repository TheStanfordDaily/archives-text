# Cuba arming, cites US threat

### Washington Post 
Havana — Cuba is preparing
for "the eventuality of a total
war" in the face of the Reagan
administration's increasing
hostility, accoiding to pub
lished statements by President
Fidel Castro and interviews
with other ranking Cuban of
ficials.
As part of this preparation
the Cuban militia is building
toward a strength of 1 million,
mpre than 10 percent of the is
land's entire population, ac
cording to the officials. Arms
shipments are arriving in quan
tity from the Soviet oloc. Re
serves are being called up, pos
sibly to increase the Cuban
presence in Angola as well as
reinforce domestic defenses.
Events as far away as Poland
and Africa have combined with
US rhetoric to spur the Cuban
buildup. The regime here does
not forget President Reagan's
suggestions during his cam
paign that a naval blockade
might be used against Havana,
and they take at face value the
remarks of Secretary of State
Alexander Haie; and other ad
ministration officials.
Cuban officials said they are
no longer sending arms to
guerrillas in El Salvador or
elsewhere in the Caribbean
basin, but they do admit that
Cuba previously sent guns to
the Salvadoran rebels. Castro
and others add, moreover, that
they would feel a moral obliga
tion to resume supplies to trie
rebels if there were means to
do so. They suggested the
means no longer available was
Nicaragua.
Cuban Vice President Carlos
Rafael Rodriguez said about
the reasons tor the buildup,
"Haig has threatened us in ev
ery way possible."
Rodriguez said, "High Amer
ican authorities have said that if
something happens in Poland
the United States would feel
free to act in other countries.
The closest country is Cuba."
South Africa's recent in
vasion of Angola also had a
profound effect on Cuba,
which feels a strong emotional
and ideological commitment
to the Marxist government
there.
Castro has accused the Unit
ed States of backing South
Africa, pointing to America's
"hideous veto in the UN Se
curity Council of a measure to
condemn South Africa for the
invasion.
