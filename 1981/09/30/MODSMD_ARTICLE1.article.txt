# Districting has Lantos' support
## 
### Richard Klingler 
A controversial California re
districting plan which will place the
Stanford area within the 11th Con
gressional District, now represented
by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), is
prompting a partisan battle involving
President Ronald Reagan.
Passed recently by the state Legisla
ture, the redistricting plan will move
portions of eastern Menlo Park and
all of Palo Alto except Foothill Park —
areas currently represented by Rep.
Paul McCloskey (R-Calif.) — into the
San Mateo district. Redistricting is
necessary because the 1980 census
showed that California's population
increased enough to add two repre
sentatives to the previous total of 43
House members.
Reagan has supported a petition
calling for a referendum to overturn
the plan and has criticized the pro
gram as unfair to Republicans and to
all California residents. However,
Lantos told the Daily: "In terms of
one man, one vote criterion, the
democratic plan is much more
equitable than the plan the Re
publicans present."
Lantos said many have attacked the
current redistricting plan as unfair to
minorities, but he defended the plan
by saying there is"] ] ] evidence (mi
norities) are happy because they are
not suing."
Reagan's support of the referen
dum was entirely appropriate both as
a registered California voter and a
leader of the Republican party, Lan
tos acknowledged, and he character
ized Reagan's support as "an astute
public relations move."
McCloskey, who currently repre
sents University area residents as the
legislator from the 12th Con
gressional District (see story above),
opposes the current plan drafted by
the democratic legislature, accord
ing to Sandy Burke, McCloskey's
press assistant. Burke said she was un
sure whether he has supported the
referendum petition formally.
On Oct. 10 at 10 a.m., Lantos will
meet at Palo Alto's Lucy Stern Hall
with residents of the newly re
districted area. Although residents of
Palo Alto will not be represented of
ficially by the 11th district House
member until the winners of the No
vember, 1982 elections asspme of
fice, representatives are allowed by
law to conduct public meetings
within and to send bulk mailings to
the new areas.
Lantos served as a professor of eco
nomics at San Francisco State Univer
sity during the 19505. He said his aca
demic background makes his "return
to a university community in this ca
pacity a particular pleasure."
Even though he is not the official
representative of the Palo Alto area,
Lantos said he would "] ] ] in the next
fourteen months, measure views in
the new area and take them into ac
count in my own vote."
His vote, Lantos said, is determined
by three considerations: the views of
his constituents, the national interest
