## Viewpoint/Mark Kramer Squelching dissent via psychiatry 
### 
In one of the worst perids of repression since Stalin's
death in 1953, the Soviet Union has moved in recent
months to put an end to the last remnants of that coun
try's dissident movement.
The target of the latest crackdown has been the Work
ing Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for
Political Purposes, a group that was formea in January
1977 as an outgrowth of the dissident panel that had
been monitoring Soviet compliance with the human
rights provisions of the Helsinki Accords. The psychiatric
commission was established to document the use of So
viet psychiatric hospitals as a means of suppressing politi
cal dissent.
Seven members of the psychiatric commission —
Viacheslav Bakhmin, Irina Grivnina, Anatoly Koryagin,
Aleksandr Lavut, Aleksandr Podrabinek, Feliks Serebrov,
and Leonid Ternovsky — received sentences ranging
from three to 12 years in labor camps and internal exile.
The seven were convicted on charges of "anti-Soviet
agitation and propaganda," but it is clear that their only
true "crimes" were to demand greater freedom and an
end to psychiatric abuse.
The psychiatric commission had compiled detailed re
ports on the workings of the Special Psychiatric Hospitals
scattered throughout the Soviet Union, and these were
the reports that nad aroused the deep hostility of officials
in Moscow.
One of the defendants, Podrabinek, had put together
an entire book exposing Soviet psychiatric abuses. Al
though the manuscript of the book was confiscated by
KGB agents in late 1977, it was later circulated through
the samizdat and was published in the United States last
year.
In the book, appropriately entitled Punitive Medicine,
Podrabinek meticulously describes the practice of psy
chiatric terror — the mental and physical torture. He also
provides a "white list" naming 200 psychiatric victims

and a "black list" naming 100 state physicians respon
sible for the abuses.
The allegations raised by Podrabinek, which have
been confirmed by sources in the Soviet Union as well as
by Soviet psychiatrists who have emigrated or fled to the
West, induced the World Psychiatric Association to con
demn the "systematic abuse of psychiatry for political
purposes in tne Soviet Union."
Official Kremlin spokesmen have generally denied the
charges, attributing them to "antipsychiatric and anti
social elements." However, the chief neuropsychiatrist
at the Soviet Ministry of Health, Dr. Zoya Serebryakova,
recently acknowledged that a certain number of patients
each year at Soviet psychiatric hospitals are admitted in
connection with "slanderous statements" and "ground
less complaints." Apparently, Serebryakova saw nothing
wrong or unusual about the practice.
The trials of the seven dissidents were little more than
a mockery. As is so often the case in the Soviet judicial
system, the guilty verdicts were a foregone conclusion.
The trials were conducted at a court in the outer sub
urbs of Moscow, apparently to discourage Western cor
respondents and friends of the defendant from attend
ing. Defense attorneys were not appointed until the day
the trials started.
Now that the seven members of the psychiatric com
mission have been convicted, the authorities in Moscow
have virtually completed their brutal, four-year cam
paign to eliminate political and religious dissent. Every
major Soviet dissident — Sakharov, Sncharansky, Nudef,
Orlov, and hundreds of others — is now either in prison
or in forced exile.
Nevertheless, although these courageous men and
women have been temporarily silenced, neither they
nor their cause will ever be forgotten.
