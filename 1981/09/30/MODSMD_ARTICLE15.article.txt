## ACLU: a member without qualms 
### 
I must take exception to john
Bunzel's attack on the American Civil
Liberties Union (Daily, 9ยง29). Bunzel
accuses the ACLU of having sacri
ficed its principles in favor of "ac
tivism" (read "left-wing politics").
Most misleading of all, nowever, is
Bunzel's assertion that there is neces
sarily a dichotomy between social is
sues and civil liberties. As a coun
terexample, abortion is manifestly a
matter of social concern, yet abor
tion rights clearly fall within the

realm of civil liberties, by virtue of a
Supreme Court decision which held
there to be constitutional grounds
for striking restrictive abortion laws.
Current ACLU action on the abortion
issue has focused on attempts to sub
vert constitutional protections.
Perusing a recent issue of the
Northern California ACLU News, I
find that the ACLU has fought for
free speech rights, against preventive
detention, and against the all-male
draft, the last on sex-discrimination

grounds; this argument was rejected
by the Supreme Court. These are
purely civil liberties matters.
Contrary to the distorted claims of
Reagan aide Edwin Meese lll[ the
ACLU is hardly a "criminals' lobby,"
but rather the leading civil rights ad
vocacy organization in these increas
ingly repressive times. I certainly
have no qualms about my own mem
bership.
