## Affirmative action: at issue is equal access with retention of democratic goals 
### 
The issue of affirmative action is
not righteousness or moral virtue,
but one of competing and legitimate
values and their relationship to many
practical problems, particularly in
the academic world.
Many people claim that the prob
lems ot minority groups in this coun
try are the consequence of wide
spread discrimination. Their solution
is more energetic and single-minded
enforcement of federal affirmative
action regulations, which require not
equal access but equal representa
tion of certain minority groups in
federal and other employment as
beneficiaries of government pro
grams.

But many of the problems of mi
nority groups today are no longer the
result of discrimination. Discrimina
tion against blacks or Hispanic Amer
icans in employment is considerably
diminished ana is not of much conse
quence in the area of educational
opportunity. Yet if these problems

are treated as if they are problems of
discrimination, the result can only be
the imposition of quotas, whicn in
turn can bring about a decline in effi
ciency of services and in the morale
of employees. Furthermore, quotas
can also nave a damaging effect on
the motivation, self-respect and ca
pacity of minority-group members.
As a society, we need to remedy
past educational, economic and cul
tural injustices to the disadvantaged
and minorities. It is an imperative
priority.
But higher education must not
adopt unjust or undemocratic means
to achieve these laudable goals.
Statistics do not lie. Blacks, His
panic Americans, and other minority
groups are not heavily represented
on university faculties.
But these same statistics, by them
selves, do not tell us why. Tne idea
that one can legitimately infer dis
crimination from a discrepancy be
tween the ratio of minority members
employed to the total number em
ployee] and the ratio of the minority
members to the total population is
simply inappropriate for institutions
of higher education.
What needs to be done to change
this situation is to get black and His
panic youngsters to take math and
science courses rather than social sci
ences and ethnic studies. Less than
three percent of the doctoral
degrees in this country go to blacks;
60 percent of those are in education.
One reason Asian-Americans have
forged ahead in recent decades in

getting good jobs and higher income
is that they have concentrated in the
sciences, mathematics, engineering
and architecture even when they
faced severe discrimination.
Government enforcement agen
cies have a right to determine wheth
er or not contractors with the gov
ernment, including universities, are
in compliance with federal af
firmative action regulations. But a
college or university must»not com
promise the right to make its own ac
ademic decisions regarding hiring,
tenure and promotion based on pro
fessional judgments about intellec
tual capacity, scholarship and
teaching ability.
Nor is it enough to talk in terms of
universities not having to select "un
qualified persons over qualified
ones." The real question is whether
affirmative action compliance in
vestigators are willing to assure a uni
versity that, having canvassed widely
and having a nondiscriminatory ap
plicant pool to consider, it is com-
Cletely protected in choosing the
est qualified person. Are these
compliance officials prepared to give
the kind of public assurance that
would make it impossible in advance
for a university (or a government
agency) to predict what tne categoric
group composition of the total of
such new appointments might turn
out to be?
Although these issues have a spe
cialized focus, the truth is that tney
touch on auestions of public policy
that are of growing interest to the
American people and should be ad
dressed by Congress. Among the

questions that call for analysis and
debate, and then should be acted
upon through direct involvement of
the political process, three deserve
legislative attention:
— What did Congress intend the
governing principle of the Civil
Rights Act to be — to provide rights
and opportunities for individuals re
gardless of their race or color or
Background, or to attach entitle
ments and penalties to individuals
based on the significance of their

group membership? Stated another
way, should individual rights give
way to groups rights in the demand
for equal rignts?
— Did Congress intend equality of
opportunity to mean statistical parity
among groups, or did the anti-dis
crimination standards in Title VI in
tend to prohibit racially preferential
treatment and quotas?
— Finally, does Congress believe
that equality of condition and result
rather than of access and opportunity
should be the defining principle of a

"new egalitarianism?" It is time for a
sharper and clearer statement by the
popularly elected branch of our gov
ernment as to whether or not it be
lieves as a matter of fundamental pol
icy that race or ethnicity should now
be a legitimate and desirable ground
for awarding jobs, social benefits or
opportunities.
