## A
						bike registered Is a bike returned 
### 
During the summer I received a
phone call which like many others,
was from a young man who said that
his bike had been stolen. He wanted
to know what procedures to f6llow
so that his bicycle might be returned
to him. The first question I asked was
whether the bike was registered.
Registration numbers are an easy way
for us to locate the owner of a bicycle
we find. Incidentally, registration is
also required by California state law.
Since the bike wasn't registered, I

asked if he knew its serial number,
something which is also helpful in
identifying a bike. As he didn't know
the serial number, I told him to come
down to police headquarters to fill
out a stolen bike report, which
should be done for every stolen bike,
not just those without registration.
Thedescriptionsonstolen bicycle re-
Eorts can be matched with found
ikes which can in turn be returned
to their owner. He thanked me for
the information and hung up.

Three weeks later he called again
to inform me that he had found his
bike outside but that it was chained
with a new lock. He wanted someone
to come down and help him recover
his bike. I asked him when he had
filled out the stolen bike report. He
conceded that he had never filled
one out. Although I wanted to help
him, without a serial number, regis
tration number, or a stolen bike re-
Kort there was nothing I could do for
im. He had no way to prove to us of
ficially that the bike was really his.
This incident will help you to see
why we encourage students to reg
ister their bikes, apart from the fact
that it is a law. A registered bicycle is
quite easily returned to its owner if
found. Every bike owner should reg
ister his or her bikeoratthevery least
fill out a bicycle security card, which
has space on which to write the serial
number and any other descriptive in
formation about a bike. These cards
are available at the Stanford police
department, 711 Serra, the libraries
and many other frequented build
ings on campus.

This may seem like an insignificant
detail, easily overlooked witn all the
other activities of Stanford life, but
when you consider that approx
imately 500 were stolen during the
1980-81 school year it is no longer so
insignificant. The Stanford police
found 256 bikes, yet only 24 of those
were actually returned to their
owners. The reason that the return
rate is so low is that most of the bikes
were neither registered nor did they
fit any description on a stolen bike
report. Without either piece of in
formation, there is simply no way we
can find the owner.
