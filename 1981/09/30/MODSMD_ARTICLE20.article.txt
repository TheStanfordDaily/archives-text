## Women's rights retrenching 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Family and tradition
made Kathy Wilson a Republican; job dis
crimination catapulted her into the wom
en's movement.
Now, as chairman of the National Wom
en's Political Caucus, which claims 60,000
members in 44 chapters nationwide, she
must combine party loyalty and feminist
politics.
It is a mix some women question in the
face of the Reagan administration's
negative views on abortion, the equal
rights amendment and other issues of con
cern to feminists. They wonder if, in these
times, it is possible to De a Republican and
a feminist.
Wilson's answer is an emphatic yes.
"I'm very disappointed with the turn the
party has taken but rather than go to the
Democratic side, I think it's more impor
tant to remain in the party and make our
disenchantment known," she said in an in
terview here during the annual state con
vention of the National Women's Political
Caucus of California, held in Long Beach.
She agrees with the traditional Re
publican view that there is a need to trim
waste and excessive bureaucracy from
government, she said. "But I feel that the
president misread the mandate, which was
to trim the waste from government pro
grams, not to eliminate them entirely," she
said.
"I think he has gone too far," Wilson
said of Reagan's efforts to balance the
budget."I think the budget cuts will have a
drastic effect on women and women heads
of households."
Cuts particularly detrimental to women,
she believes, are food stamps, the school
lunch program, Aid to Families With De

pendent Children and the paring of Title
IX programs. Title IX makes it illegal for
educational institutions receiving federal
funds to discriminate on the basis of sex.
"These are really critical times for both
the GOP and the women's movement,"
Wilson said, "and if the former can't ac
commodate the latter, then I think their
(the Republican party) time in the sun is
going to be brief."
Wilson, a strong critic of President
Ronald Reagan, was 29 when she was
unanimously elected to head the pow
erful, 10-year-old multi-partisan women's
organization at its national covention in
Albuquerque, N]M][ last July. She was the
second Republican to be elected chairman
in the organization's history.
"What makes our organization unique,"
she said, "is that we're the only political
membership organization that is able to
assist candidates on both sides of the aisle
(Democrats and Republicans).
"The thing that has made this organiza
tion strong is that we have always felt there
is more to oind us along feminist lines than
to divide us along party lines."
Since Reagan's election, Wilson said, the
organization has gained about 5000 new
members. .
"I think in some ways Ronald Reagan has
given us a gift. In past administrations,
where you had some semblance of work to
involve women, you had more difficulty
mobilizing women because they felt they
were being treated fairly and being given
an opportunity to participate. That is no
longer the case."
"Before it happened to me, I had never
really given discrimination a lot of
thought. I had not knowingly been sub
jected to discrimination up until that

point," she said. "And, I think that's a fairly
typical attitude."
"There is a sort of anti-woman tone at
work," she said. "I think this adminis
tration is proving daily how imperative it is
that we pass the equal rights amendment
and how desperately we need (it) with the
questioning of the constitutionality of af
firmative action and when the regulations
that would enforce it are being
eliminated."
The Reagan administration has pro
posed significant relaxation of rules gov
erning affirmative action programs wnich
affect the hiring policies in some 200,000
firms holding government contracts.
"What we are faced with in this adminis
tration, is the first president to oppose the
ERA and a president who is encouraging
Congress to send a Human Life Amend
ment to the states," she said.
"And that is a contradiction, because he
claims to be against the equal rights
amendment. He's for the ER but not the A
because he dislikes the amendment proc
ess, and yet he turns around and supports
sending an amendment to the states that
would prohibit abortion.
"Couple that with the dearth of women
appointees in this administration and we
know we have lost ground," she said.
"That's very scary," she said of Reagan's
appointment record, "because in the past,
regardless of party, each president since
Lyndon Johnson has increased the number
of women appointees.
Of the 18 Cabinet appointments the
president made during that same period,
only one was female — Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick, U.S. Representative to the the
United Nations.

"Before it happened to me, I had never

"What we are faced with in this adminis

ERA and a president who is encouraging
Congress to send a Human Life Amend

"Couple that with the dearth of women
appointees in this administration and we
know we have lost ground," she said.
"That's very scary," she said of Reagan's
appointment record, "because in the past,
regardless of party, each president since
Lyndon Johnson has increased the number
of women appointees.
Of the 18 Cabinet appointments the
president made during that same period,
only one was female — Ambassador Jeane

United Nations.
Los Angeles — Family and tradition
made Kathy Wilson a Republican; job dis
crimination catapulted her into the wom
en's movement.
Now, as chairman of the National Wom
en's Political Caucus, which claims 60,000
members in 44 chapters nationwide, she
must combine party loyalty and feminist
politics.
It is a mix some women question in the
face of the Reagan administration's
negative views on abortion, the equal
rights amendment and other issues of con
cern to feminists. They wonder if, in these
times, it is possible to De a Republican and
a feminist.
Wilson's answer is an emphatic yes.
"I'm very disappointed with the turn the
party has taken but rather than go to the
Democratic side, I think it's more impor
tant to remain in the party and make our
disenchantment known," she said in an in
terview here during the annual state con
vention of the National Women's Political
Caucus of California, held in Long Beach.
She agrees with the traditional Re
publican view that there is a need to trim
waste and excessive bureaucracy from
government, she said. "But I feel that the
president misread the mandate, which was
to trim the waste from government pro
grams, not to eliminate them entirely," she
said.
"I think he has gone too far," Wilson
said of Reagan's efforts to balance the
budget."I think the budget cuts will have a
drastic effect on women and women heads
of households."
Cuts particularly detrimental to women,
she believes, are food stamps, the school
lunch program, Aid to Families With De

pendent Children and the paring of Title
IX programs. Title IX makes it illegal for
educational institutions receiving federal
funds to discriminate on the basis of sex.
"These are really critical times for both
the GOP and the women's movement,"
Wilson said, "and if the former can't ac
commodate the latter, then I think their
(the Republican party) time in the sun is
going to be brief."
Wilson, a strong critic of President
Ronald Reagan, was 29 when she was
unanimously elected to head the pow
erful, 10-year-old multi-partisan women's
organization at its national covention in
Albuquerque, N]M][ last July. She was the
second Republican to be elected chairman
in the organization's history.
"What makes our organization unique,"
she said, "is that we're the only political
membership organization that is able to
assist candidates on both sides of the aisle
(Democrats and Republicans).
"The thing that has made this organiza
tion strong is that we have always felt there
is more to oind us along feminist lines than
to divide us along party lines."
Since Reagan's election, Wilson said, the
organization has gained about 5000 new
members. .
"I think in some ways Ronald Reagan has
given us a gift. In past administrations,
where you had some semblance of work to
involve women, you had more difficulty
mobilizing women because they felt they
were being treated fairly and being given
an opportunity to participate. That is no
longer the case."
