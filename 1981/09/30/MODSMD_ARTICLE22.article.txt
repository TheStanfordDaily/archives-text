# Fuel explosion risk sparks recall

Boston (AP) — Hundreds of
owners of new Ford automo
biles, fearing they may be de
nied gasoline, rushed to
dealers yesterday to have faulty
fuel systems fixed after the
Massachusetts fire marshal
warned their cars were fire
hazards.
The fire marshal asked local
fire chiefs yesterday to urge
service stations to deny gas to
owners of 1981 Ford Escorts
and Lincoln-Mercury Lynxes
unless they had had the defects
repaired.
Marshal Joseph O'Keefe said
a design error in 125,000 cars
built between August and De
cember last year could cause a
fire when gas is being pumped
into them.
"How would you like to be in
a gas station waiting to be filled
up, knowing that the car in
front of you might blow up?"

O'Keefe said.
In Dearborn, Mich., Ford
spokesman Paul Preuss denied
tnat the defect creates a fire
hazard. Three "minor inci
dents" have been reported na
tionwide, he said, but none re
sulted in serious damage or in
jury.
Ford issued a recall for all the
vehicles last month to have the
fuel systems checked.
Massachusetts car dealers
said they were swamped with
car owners seeking the repairs,
which take about 10 minutes
and are performed free.
"My phone has been ringing
off the nook," said Ron Harris,
a Foxboro service station
owner. "Everyone has been
calling in, trying to find out
what to do."
According to O'Keefe, the
design error was reponsible for
a fire Aug. 27 at a service station

in Woburn, a Boston suburb.
The fire was quickly extin
guished without injury.
The car lacked a device to
ground the fuel pipe, which is
needed to prevent a buildup of
an electrical charge that could
start a fire, he said.
Preuss said some of the cars
lacked a ground wire.
