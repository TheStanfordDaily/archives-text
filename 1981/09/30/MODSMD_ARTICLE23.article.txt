## Water polo team triumphs back East, moves into NorCals 
### Sally Jenkins 
The defending NCAA cham
pionship Stanford water polo
team emerged Monday from a
10-day road trip with an un
defeated record and an iron
clad No.l ranking.
The Cardinals placed first in
the 12-team UC-lrvine Invita
tional at the start of the trip by
eliminating all of its upcoming
Pacific-10 competition. In six
games the Cards blew through
e Pepperdine 11-1, UC-Santa
„ Barbara 9-6, UC-Berkeley 7-2,
Longbeach State 8-4, Irvine 8-5,
and UCLA 10-6.
The team headed East next,
j for the Brown University Invita
tional in Providence, Rhode Is
land, and three scrimmage
games in New York, against
Yale, Fordham, and the New
York Athletic Club. No scores
were kept in the scrimmages.
In the official games at
Brown the Cards took first
place once again, merely ob
literating all-comers.
After rolling over the home

team 25-6, they bulldozed
Bucknell 17-4, whipped Co
lumbia 24-3, and spat on
Harvard 23-3.
"We wailed on them," said
Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "The result of the
trip is that we're now ranked
No.l, and are just about the
only undefeated team in the
country."
Hole-man Jody Campbell
led the team in scoring at the
end of the trip with 23 goals.
Seven Cardinals had totals of 10
or more goals; Campbell was
followed by Alan Mouchawar
with 17, James Bergeson with
15, and a newcomer to the line
up, John Tanner, who had 10.
Overall the Cards outscored
their opponents 142-40. Dante
analyzed the scoring by halves.
"In the first halves we out
scored them 80-11, so we really
outscored them when we had
the first strings in and things
were still close; 29 of their 40
goals were scored against our
second unit in the second

halves."
The Cards begin the season
in earnest Friday and Saturday
when they host the NorCals at
deGuerre Swim Complex from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days.
Games will be held simultane
ously in both the large and
small pools.
A total of 16 teams are en
tered in the tournament, which
features all of Stanford's pre
mier Northern competition,
including UCSB[ Cal State Full
erton, UC-Davis, and Cal.
"We figure to be the best
team in the nation." Dettaman
ti said flatly. "We have five out
of seven seniors in the starting
line-up, the other two are jun
iors. We are even a little better
than last year, whereas the rest
of the teams across the nation
are down a little because they
graduated key players. I think
we are improved just because
we have more experience."
The Cards lost only one key
player to graduation last year;
goalie and four-time All-Ev

erything John Gansel. Replac
ing Gansel will be fifth-year
senior Vince Vannelli, a red
shirter last year who has waited
his whole career for Gansel to
depart.
Campbell, who was a mem
ber of the 1980 Olympic team,
has emerged as the mainstay of
the squad. Long and gangly
armed, with a reputation for
being slightly crazed, he led
the team in scoring last season
with 35 goals despite missing 11
games. "He's become the team
leader and catalyst — he makes
the offense go," said Det
tamanti.
Of the seven starters, four
have international playing ex
perience. Seniors Campbell,
Mouchawar, and Bergeson are
members of the US National
team, and Tanner, a junior,
toured in Europe this summer.
"The only way we arc going
to lose is if we beat ourselves,"
said Dettamanti. "We would
have to play pretty badly."

York Athletic Club. No scores
were kept in the scrimmages.
In the official games at
Brown the Cards took first
place once again, merely ob
literating all-comers.
After rolling over the home

team 25-6, they bulldozed
Bucknell 17-4, whipped Co
lumbia 24-3, and spat on
Harvard 23-3.
"We wailed on them," said
Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "The result of the
trip is that we're now ranked
No.l, and are just about the
only undefeated team in the
country."
Hole-man Jody Campbell
led the team in scoring at the
end of the trip with 23 goals.
Seven Cardinals had totals of 10
or more goals; Campbell was
followed by Alan Mouchawar
with 17, James Bergeson with
15, and a newcomer to the line
up, John Tanner, who had 10.
Overall the Cards outscored
their opponents 142-40. Dante
analyzed the scoring by halves.
"In the first halves we out
scored them 80-11, so we really
outscored them when we had
the first strings in and things
were still close; 29 of their 40
goals were scored against our
second unit in the second

halves."
The Cards begin the season
in earnest Friday and Saturday
when they host the NorCals at
deGuerre Swim Complex from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days.
Games will be held simultane
ously in both the large and
small pools.
A total of 16 teams are en
tered in the tournament, which
features all of Stanford's pre
mier Northern competition,
including UCSB[ Cal State Full
erton, UC-Davis, and Cal.
"We figure to be the best
team in the nation." Dettaman
ti said flatly. "We have five out
of seven seniors in the starting
line-up, the other two are jun
iors. We are even a little better
than last year, whereas the rest
of the teams across the nation
are down a little because they
graduated key players. I think
we are improved just because
we have more experience."
The Cards lost only one key
player to graduation last year;
goalie and four-time All-Ev

erything John Gansel. Replac
ing Gansel will be fifth-year
senior Vince Vannelli, a red
shirter last year who has waited
his whole career for Gansel to
depart.
Campbell, who was a mem
ber of the 1980 Olympic team,
has emerged as the mainstay of
the squad. Long and gangly
armed, with a reputation for
being slightly crazed, he led
the team in scoring last season
with 35 goals despite missing 11
games. "He's become the team
leader and catalyst — he makes
the offense go," said Det
tamanti.
Of the seven starters, four
have international playing ex
perience. Seniors Campbell,
Mouchawar, and Bergeson are
members of the US National
team, and Tanner, a junior,
toured in Europe this summer.
"The only way we arc going
to lose is if we beat ourselves,"
said Dettamanti. "We would
have to play pretty badly."


ON TOP AGAIN — The NCAA defending champion Stanford water polo team
is ranked No. 1 again this year after their performance at the Brown Invitational and the UC Irvine
Invitational. The Cards host their own tournament this weekend in deCuerre pool, the NorCal
Invitational.
