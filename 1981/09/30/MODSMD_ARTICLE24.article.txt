### Mike Oneal 
Stanford's cross country
teams swept the men's and
women's divisions of the
Fresno State Invitational
Cross Country Cham
pionships over the weekend
to begin their seasons in fine
style.
Freshman Cici Hopp from
Cos Cob, Conn, took first
place and set a new course
record with a 16:28 time
over 5000-meters as the
Stanford women posted a
perfect score in the meet by
taking the top-six slots. Jun
ior Kim Schnurpfeil finished
second with a 16:34 also
breaking the old course rec
ord, sophomore Patti Sue
Plumer wrapped up third
with a 16:40, freshman Sloan
Burton was fourth with
17:02, Ann Locke ran a 17:09
for fifth and Michele Mason
was sixth with a 17:16.

This meet constitutes the
first time a Stanford wom
en's team has run for a
perfect score, assistant
coach Tom Pagani said.
Head coach Brooks John
son was pleased but hesitant
when discussing the meet.
"It was very gratifying, of
course," Johnson said. "But
we haven't come up against
the kind of competition will
come up against. This team
is very young — Kim
Schnurpfeil is the oldest
team member. They will
take a while to mature.
Some of them have run but
never attended a class.
They'll find out what it's like
to go to school and compete
at the same time. We don't
have to push at them
though. We have the talent
now that we can sit back and
be patient and let them
mature on their own."
The men's team was clear

ly not as devastating as the
women's but spread seven
runners over the top-20 fin
ishers to capture tne team
victory. Coach Mike
Tomasello said that the team
ran well at the beginning of
the race but fell off a bit
toward the end.
"They ran as well as I have
ever seen a Stanford team
run for the first four miles,"
Tomasello said, "but thev
didn't attack the course af
ter that. If the race broke
down for us it broke down
in the last two miles."
"We were very pleased to
win," he added. "It's always
good to open that way. But
we could nave been better
and there's some room for
improvement."
Senior Jim Smith was the
first to finish for Stanford
with a 30:33 over the 10,000-
meter course. He placed

second in the race to a San
Jose State runner from Ken
ya named Simon Kilili who
Droke the course record

lower than last year's
andcommented that both
Graham and Steppenfield

than a minute.
