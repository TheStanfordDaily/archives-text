# Watson ties for first in Stanford Pro-Am
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
Tom Watson returned to the
Stanford golf course Monday
afternoon and finished first in
his own Pro-Am golf tour
nament, for the sixth time.
Firing off a round of 70 on
the par-71 Stanford golf
course, Watson tied in the pro
fessional standings with Eric
Batten of Santa Cruz, a San Jose
State graduate and fellow pro.
The two received $450 each for
their efforts; Watson donated
his to the Stanford golf athletic
scholarship program.
The one-day match play
tournament, in its seventh year
of existence, is held annually to
support the Stanford men's
golf program. The past six
events have raised $125,000 to
tal.
Along with Watson and Bat
ten, 18 club and touring pro's
competed in the tournament,
including Gay Brewer, Rod
Funseth, Phil Rogers, Artie
McNickle, Chris Roderick,
John Jacobs, Bob Wynn, Bob
Smith, Maury Verbrugge, Kyle
Burton, Jim Langley, Tom
Jacobs, Don Fairfield, Scott Lit
tle, Chuck Courtney, Dave
Fowler, and Terry Wilcox.
Watson also held a golf clinic
on the practice tee before the
event began.
As he worked his way
through the Stanford golf
course, a green oasis that winds
through the mustard colored
foothills, his round turned into

a clinic of sorts also.
The gallery ducked under
the ropes and followed him
down the fairways like a pied
piper, asking for advice about
evrything from their golf grips,
to which way the wind was
blowing.
His playing partners watched
him carefully as he lined up
their putts for them, and dis
cussed the break of the greens
with them matter of factly.
Despite his divided atten
tion, Watson was two-under
par and one stroke up on Bat
ten through the 14th green, but
bogied the 15th and played the
last holes even par.
Watson shot a scorching 66
last year to win by two strokes,
and has in fact won every year
that he played. He missed the
tournament only once, in 1979,
when he stayed in Kansas City
for the birth of his daughter.
George Archer finished first in
his stead.
Estimated attendance to the
tournament v. -s 2000; student
tickets were $2, and general ad
mission was $5. The entry fees
for amateurs, most of whom
were local businessmen and
Stanford alumni, was $350.
In the pro standings, Chris
Roderick, pro at the Olympic
club, Bob Wynn of Los Altos,
Bob Smith of Sacramento, and
Maurice Ver Brugge, pro at
Burlingame country club tied
for second place with 72.

he honed amd perfected on the Farm as a member of the Stanford golf team. Watson and a number
