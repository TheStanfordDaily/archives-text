# Ainge flies the Blue Jay coop, future still foggy
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” The
baseball career of Danny Ainge
will come to an end Sunday.
Whether his basketball career
starts days later Ovill be de
termined this week in court.
While lawyers for the Toron
to Blue jays and Boston Celtics
bickered over procedural mat
ters in the first day of their cele
brated battle, Ainge, barely
managing to keep his eyes
open after an all-night flight,
proclaimed he was through
with baseball regardless of the
outcome of the trial.
"I have no intention of going
back there (Toronto)," Ainge
told The Associated Press as the
lawyers began their arguments.
"I don't plan on returning to
Toronto no matter the out

come. Toronto feels if it wins
the case, I'll go home for the
winter, change my mind and
come back for spring training.
But I'm through with Daseball."
Ainge, 22, is just completing
the first year of a three-year,
$225,000 contract as a part-time
third baseman with the Blue
Jays. Because his batting aver
age never did quite make it to
.200 this year, Ainge, a 6-foot-5
Ail-American guard ftom
Brigham Young, came to the
conclusion that basketball was
his best sport. The only prob
lem, of course, is his contract,
which includes a $300,000 ad
dendum that restricts Ainge
from playing in professional or
recreationalbasKetball.
That clause, which Ainge
contends was waived verbally
by Blue Jays President Peter
Bavasi in June and confirmed
two days later by Toronto vice
president Pat uillick, is the
point of contention in the trial
that got underway Monday in
US District Court.
/ The other key factor that the
sfx-member jury in Judge Lee
P] Gagliardi's courtroom must
decide is whether a man is al
lowed to have a change of
heart and switch careers. On

Monday, the attorneys for each
side presented their opening
remarks to the jury. The case
was recessed until today be
cause of the Jewish High Holy
Day, Rosh Hashanah. Testi
mony from Ainge and mem
bers of the front offices of the
Celtics and Blue Jays will be
taken today.
While this was going on
Monday, Ainge revealed he
filed voluntary retirement pa
pers with the Blue Jays last
Thursday and considers his
baseball career over on Sun
day, when the Blue Jays close
out their season in Seattle.
"Even if we lose the case, I'm
not going back to baseball. I
have some businesses in Utah
and I have been offered an as
sistant coaching job at BYU["
Ainge said. "I have a lot of al
ternatives."
In his remarks to the jury,
Blue Jays attorney Douglas
Parker said if Ainge were inac
tive in April, Toronto would
seek to make a financial settle
ment with the Celtics, allowing
him to play basketball. Some
court observers feel the Blue
Jays no longer want Ainge but
instead want to recoup some of
their investment in him.
