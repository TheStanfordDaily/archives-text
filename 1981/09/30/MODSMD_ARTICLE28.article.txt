### Los Angeles Times 
Baden-Baden, West Germany — International
Olympic Committee sources said yesterday that
Nagoya, Japan and Cortina, D'Amprezzo, Italy,
have emerged as favorites to be chosen today as
the summer and winter Olympic Games sites for
1988.
The lOC met throughout the day yesterday
behind closed doors to near the presentations of
tpe candidate cities, There wa? no indication
that the lOC leadership was trying to foreclose
the choices.
But a number of sources who attended the
meetings said that Nagoya seemed to be favored
over Seoul. South Korea, for the summer Games,
because of fears that the political environment
in Seoul made that city a risky choice.
The contest for a winter city was closer.
Besides Cortina, Calgary. Canada and a pair of
Swedish cities, Falun and Are, seek the Games.
The belief here last night was that no city would
have a majority in the first round of secret-ballot
voting among the 81 lOC members present here
and that there would be a run-off between Cor
tina and Calgary.
Two arguments were said to be working in the
closed sessions for the Italians. One is that both
the summer and winter Games have not been
outside Europe in the same year since 1932. And
the other is that Canada boycotted last year's
Moscow Olympics while Italy did not.
This is Calgary's fourth Did for the winter

Olympics. Cortina hosted the winter Games in
1956. The Canadian government and the Alberta
provincial government have pledged a total of
§270 million for the Calgary Games.
Despite having Soviet support, the Swedish
bid is not taken as seriously as either the Italian
or Canadian bids, because of fears that the two
Swedish cities are too far apart for convenient
Games. They are about 300 miles apart and it
would take airplane flights to move competitors,
press and spectators from one site to another.
Meanwhile, leaders of the Los Angeles Olym
pic Organizing Committee, here for the World
Olympic Congress, were meeting with national
committee heads from around the world.
Committee Chairman Paul Ziffren and Presi
dent Peter V] Ueberroth reported that the depu
ty secretary general of tne Chinese Olympic
Committee, He Zheliang, told them yesterday
morning that China plans to send a team of 300
athletes to Los Angeles in 1984.
Ziffren and Ueberroth added that Hungary
and East Germany have assured them that tney
will send teams as well.
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles group also con
tinued talks over foreign television rights.
Ueberroth met late yesterday with represent
atives of NHK Japan's largest television
network. The Los Angeles Committee is asking
the Japanese to pay $40 million for television
rights in Japan for the 1984 Games.
