# Industry to fund gene research center
##

In addition to the University's de
velopment of a genetic patent, a con
sortium of corporations has con
tracted to establish a nonprofit Cen
ter for Biotechnology Research that
will direct $970,000 to Stanford re
search projects.
The University started receiving
the funds this month and will con
tinue to be funded through August
31, 1985, acccording to John Richey,
assistant director of the Sponsored
Projects Office, which is directing the
agreement. A $25,000 installment has
already been received.
Six companies are contributing to
the research: General Foods,
MacLaren Power and Paper, Bendix,
Elf Aquitaine, Koppers Co. and the
Mead Corp.
The Stanford researchers benefit
ing from the funds are Dr. Channing
Robertson, a chemical engineer, and
Dr. Abdul Matin, a microbiologist.
The University of California hasa sim
ilar agreement that will fund a
chemical engineer there.
The objective of the research, ac
cording to Eric Lapp, one of the law
yers who negotiated the agreement,

is to exploit recent biological tech
nology advances to develop new
Crocesses that can be applied to a
road range of products. The re
search will not be aimed at produc
ing products, he said.
The newly formed Center for
Biotechnology Research is a non
profit organization that will act as a
negotiator for the University without
any direct financial connection. The
firms will also form a joint corporate
arm called the Engenics Corporation,
which will have the option to licence
any discoveries that come through
the research funded by the Center.
The Engenics Corporation will be

owned jointly by the six companies
contributing to the research and by
the Center, which will be the largest
single stockholder with 30 percent of
the shares. All monetary gains the
Center makes through its ownings
will be spent on further research.
The Engenics Corporation will
have the option to license any tech
nology resulting from the research,
according to Joseph Shlegeris, a re
search assistant for the Office of
Technology and Licensing, but the
license will not be necessarily under
the exclusive control of the com
pany.
"The decision involves a judgment
call on our part," Shlegeris said. "If

the technology involved is really hot
and under extreme demand, then we
would not grant the company an ex
clusive license." However, Shlegeris
said that if the patents were only eco
nomically attractive to the company
if the company had exclusive control,
then the exclusive rights would be
granted.
According to Lapp, the agreement
was designed so that the Center for
Biotechnology Research could act as
an impartial negotiator between the
University and the corporations
without being within the University's
financial control.
"The Center will be there to own
equity, just to hold stock," he said,
"and it will be dedicated to con
tributing its equity finally to the
furthering of scientific research."
The creation of a nonprofit mid
dleman avoids many of the conflict of
interest problems that are inherent in
the relationship of a university to cor
porate investors in researh. Last year
a public debate developed when
Harvard University announced its in
tention to market its own genetic
patents, but there was enough op
position to cause Harvard to aban
don its plans.
