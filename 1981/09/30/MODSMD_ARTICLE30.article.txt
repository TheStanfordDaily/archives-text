# NFL players consider own strike
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The National Football
League is only one-quarter of the way
through its 1981 season, but the NFL
Players Association is already talking tough
about its contract demands for next year
and laying the groundwork for a possible
strike that could seriously disrupt the 1982
season.
"I don't see the owners giving us what
we want without some type of collective
action," said Gene Upshaw, the 15-year
lineman for the Oakland Raiders and the
president of the NFLPA. "The owners are
preparing themselves for the worst, and I
think the players should, also. We're going
to urge the players' wives to salt some
money away for what could be a strike
year."
Citing this year's seven-week, mid
season baseball strike as an example, the
football players say they have no intention
of repeating their 1974 tactic, when they
struck during the preseason.
"The baseball strike has helped us im
measurably," said Ed Garvey, executive di
rector of the NFLPA. "It is a good example
for the NFL players of what can be
achieved if they can stick together. The
crucial thing about the baseball strike is
that it occurred during the season. Then
you can't hire scabs. I can't imagine anoth
er training-camp strike."
Although the NFLPA's contract with the
owners does not expire until next July 15,
the union has already prepared and dis
tributed to its members a booklet setting
forth its demands, a package hammered
out at a meeting of player representatives
from each of the NFL's 28 teams this sum
mer in Chicago.
The package represents a major shift in
emphasis away from individual contract
negotiations to a system in which all
players would share in a fixed percentage
of gross revenues generated by the NFL]
For their next contract, they are asking for
55-percent and would distribute the mon
ey according to a formula based on
number of years in the league and posi
tion.

But it has met a wall of opposition from
the owners.
"Philosophically and conceptually, it's
just not an acceptable alternative," said
jack Donlan, who heads the NFL Man
agement Council, the panel that nego
tiates with the union on behalf of the
owners.
"These owners believe that once you go
to a percentage, any percentage, you're
going to have joint control. That's a de
parture from the owners' standpoint. It
makes an employe your partner, and we
consider the players to be employes. The
owners feel that they are the ones who
have made this league grow."
Whether or not the union is strong
enough to stage a successful strike and en
force its demands is a question that re
mains to be answered. A potentially
divisive effort to unseat Garvey failed at
the summer player-representatives' meet
ing, but there are some who feel the scars
of that battle remain and that the union
was left weakened.
"It obviously has damaged the union
somewhat. I would try to make the change
again, but it's over with now," said player
representative Keith Fahnhorst of the San
Francisco 49ers, one of seven dissidents to
vote against Garvey. "We pledged our
support to Ed, not to get back in the fold
but because we knew we'd hurt the union
more if we kept pursuing it. We have to
direct our energies against management in
the upcoming negotiations."
Predictably, Garvey and Upshaw down
play the significance of the ouster attempt.
"There were some personality dif
ferences; a difference of opinion about
what we ought to be doing," said Garvey.
"You'd like things to be totally unified. But
I don't think in any democratic organiza
tion you can expect monolithic agree
ment. We were unanimous in making a
percentage of the gross our No. 1 priority
in our negotiations."
Mark Murphy, player representative for

the Redskins, said most of his teammates
and player representatives from other
teams support the union demands for a
percentage of the gross and a wage scale.
"But we're interested in other things,
too," said Murphy. "Job security, protec
tion from injury, freedom of movement
In describing union demands, Carvey
does not use such terms as "revolu
tionary," but he leaves no doubt that what
the union wants is a radical departurefrom
the status quo.
He maintains that football is easily the
nation's most popular professional spec
tator sport, yet salaries lag far behind those
in other pro sports. The average NFL salary
in 1980 was just under $80,000, which was
$28,000 less than a professional hockey
player could expect to earn, $90,000 less
than a baseball player and $106,000 less
than a basketball player.
"Individual contract negotiations in the
NFL haven't, don't and won't work to ben
efit the majority of our members," argued
the union in the booklet describing the
contract demands.

The reason, said the union, is that NFL
teams regularly fill their stadiums, share
television revenues equally and divide the
proceeds from postseason playoffs and Su
per Bowl games. Because their stadiums
are already full and their TV packages as
sured, the owners have no economic in
centive to raid other clubs for superstars to
draw larger gates.
"They have no economic incentive to
win," said Garvey.
Retorts the NFL Management Council's
Donlan, "That's clearly nonsense. The av
erage NFL club spends $750,000 a year on
scouting. Why would they do that if they
weren't interested in getting the best
players? They could just have the league
set up a scouting department and read
their reports."

In describing union demands, Carvey
does not use such terms as "revolu

the union wants is a radical departurefrom
the status quo.
He maintains that football is easily the
nation's most popular professional spec

in other pro sports. The average NFL salary
in 1980 was just under $80,000, which was
$28,000 less than a professional hockey
player could expect to earn, $90,000 less
than a baseball player and $106,000 less
than a basketball player.

The reason, said the union, is that NFL
teams regularly fill their stadiums, share
television revenues equally and divide the
proceeds from postseason playoffs and Su
per Bowl games. Because their stadiums
are already full and their TV packages as
sured, the owners have no economic in
centive to raid other clubs for superstars to
draw larger gates.
"They have no economic incentive to
win," said Garvey.
Retorts the NFL Management Council's
Donlan, "That's clearly nonsense. The av
erage NFL club spends $750,000 a year on
scouting. Why would they do that if they
weren't interested in getting the best
players? They could just have the league
set up a scouting department and read
their reports."
Washington — The National Football
League is only one-quarter of the way
through its 1981 season, but the NFL
Players Association is already talking tough
about its contract demands for next year
and laying the groundwork for a possible
strike that could seriously disrupt the 1982
season.
"I don't see the owners giving us what
we want without some type of collective
action," said Gene Upshaw, the 15-year
lineman for the Oakland Raiders and the
president of the NFLPA. "The owners are
preparing themselves for the worst, and I
think the players should, also. We're going
to urge the players' wives to salt some
money away for what could be a strike
year."
Citing this year's seven-week, mid
season baseball strike as an example, the
football players say they have no intention
of repeating their 1974 tactic, when they
struck during the preseason.
"The baseball strike has helped us im
measurably," said Ed Garvey, executive di
rector of the NFLPA. "It is a good example
for the NFL players of what can be
achieved if they can stick together. The
crucial thing about the baseball strike is
that it occurred during the season. Then
you can't hire scabs. I can't imagine anoth
er training-camp strike."
Although the NFLPA's contract with the
owners does not expire until next July 15,
the union has already prepared and dis
tributed to its members a booklet setting
forth its demands, a package hammered
out at a meeting of player representatives
from each of the NFL's 28 teams this sum
mer in Chicago.
The package represents a major shift in
emphasis away from individual contract
negotiations to a system in which all
players would share in a fixed percentage
of gross revenues generated by the NFL]
For their next contract, they are asking for
55-percent and would distribute the mon
ey according to a formula based on
number of years in the league and posi
tion.

But it has met a wall of opposition from
the owners.
"Philosophically and conceptually, it's
just not an acceptable alternative," said
jack Donlan, who heads the NFL Man
agement Council, the panel that nego
tiates with the union on behalf of the
owners.
"These owners believe that once you go
to a percentage, any percentage, you're
going to have joint control. That's a de
parture from the owners' standpoint. It
makes an employe your partner, and we
consider the players to be employes. The
owners feel that they are the ones who
have made this league grow."
Whether or not the union is strong
enough to stage a successful strike and en
force its demands is a question that re
mains to be answered. A potentially
divisive effort to unseat Garvey failed at
the summer player-representatives' meet
ing, but there are some who feel the scars
of that battle remain and that the union
was left weakened.
"It obviously has damaged the union
somewhat. I would try to make the change
again, but it's over with now," said player
representative Keith Fahnhorst of the San
Francisco 49ers, one of seven dissidents to
vote against Garvey. "We pledged our
support to Ed, not to get back in the fold
but because we knew we'd hurt the union
more if we kept pursuing it. We have to
direct our energies against management in
the upcoming negotiations."
Predictably, Garvey and Upshaw down
