## Riles offers optimistic outlook on public school education 
### Sally Newman 
Predicting a gradual increase
in statewide public school en
rollment and praising the pa
rental involvement evident
here, Wilson Riles, State Super
intendent of Public Instruc
tion, spoke confidently about
the challenge facing public
education to approximately 50
representatives of the Palo Alto
Parent-Teacher Association
(PTA) last Wednesday.

In a 15-minute appearence at
a PTA meeting at the Escondido
Elementary School, Riles quali
fied his optimistic tone only
slightly. He advised those
gathered to "be very cautious
with what they are doing to
their schools" in general and
not to eliminate programs pre
maturely when faced with
budget restrictions in particu
lar.
"You have to do fewer

things," Riles conceded, "but
do them better." He noted that
increased parental involve
ment had greatlv contributed
to the passage of AB 777, a bill
providing for an eight percent
across-the-board funding in
crease for public instruction.
"It was not a massive increase,
but we are able to maintain our
programs," he said.
In a brief question and an
swer session which followed,

Riles indicated his support for
an environmental eaucation
program now under considera
tion in Palo Alto. He suggested,
though, that he would "inte
grate environmental education
into the existing curriculum."
Generally well-received
throughout his presentation,
Riles received an especially
strong round of applause when
he concluded his remarks by

saying, "If we can really stay to
gether we can make it, and I
know we will."
Introductory remarks by Dr.
Newman Walker, Palo Alto Su
perintendent of Schools, re
viewed several of the issues of
current concern to Palo Alto
schools.
The possible ramifications of
declining enrollment, which is
a phenomenon not likely to
ease before the turn of the cen
tury, according to Walker, fig
ured prominently in parents'
Questions and Walker's replies
uring the session. Ideas pro
posed by the city council's long
range planners include

mergers, sending sixth graders
to local junior nigh schools,
and expanding district lines.
Speaking about neighbor
hood schools, several of which
face closure if enrollment fig
ures remain low, Walker dis
cussed the competition for en
rollment between "conven
tional" and "alternative"
schools and termed it "a con
structive pinch." Even if some
neighborhood schools are
fused together, however, he
assured parents that while it
might represent "a significant
change in the community," it is
not, "abandoning a concept."
As part of his stay here, Riles

also attended an informal
luncheon with University pres
ident Donald Kennedy, Dean
of the School of Education
Myron Atkin, and Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon. A re
ception hosted by the school of
education followed. Accord
ing to Ray Bacchetti, Vice Prov
ost for Management and
Budget, who scheduled the
event, the purpose of the re
ception was to "give a visiting
dignitary the chance to meet
and talk" with University of
ficials. He emphasized that
both the luncheon and recep
tion were conducted on an in
formal level — "without even
an agenda," Bacchetti said.
