# Minority area schools crowded
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Despite
the end of a ban on new school
construction and under
ehrollment in parts of the dis
trict, school officials say they'll
be wrestling with overcrowded
schools "for a long time to
come."
The main reasons: lack of
money for new facilities in mi
nority areas which need them,
and a school board unwilling to
dose less crowded schools in
mostly white areas while the
district's 18-year-old -de
segregation case was pending.
Superior Court Judge Robert
Lopez closed that case Sept. 10
ahd lifted a 1970 ban on con
struction in minority neighbor
hoods, intended to forestall
still more segregated schools.

Currently about a quarter of
the district's enrollment —
140,000 children at 125 schools
in the district's central and
southeast regions — are sub
ject to year-round classes,
doubled-up first and second
grades and makeshift
classrooms.
The district is now free to
carry out master plan proposals
for 45 expansions and 11 new
schools in minority areas. But
"it looks like we're going to
have continual overcrowd
ing," Ted Kimbrough, director
of school building planning,
said Monday.
Transferring students from
jammed facilities to what he
called "underutilized" ones in
the west San Fernando Valley is

too expensive at $700 to $900
per child a year, Kimbrough
said. Neither does the district
have the $300 million its master
construction plan would re
quire through 1986.
The school board is just now
beginning to consider closing
schools in white areas where
enrollment has been dropping
for 10 years, although it de
cided last May to earmark any
sale proceeds for new con
struction. Given the de
segregation suit, Kimbrough
said the board's reluctance was
"perfectly legitimate, although
some critics have seen that as a
political decision."
Meantime, the district plans
to use $22 million from a state

lease-purchase program to ex
pand 10 schools in tne Wilshire
and southeast areas. A request
for another $38 million
through that program is pend
ing; it could pay for expansion
at another 18 schools.
But Kimbrough said the most
effective solution — new build
ings — will remain on paper in
definitely.
"They haven't been funded
even though there's an
absolutely proven need," he
said. "Acquiring the land alone
will take substantial amountsof
time, as long as three years. I
think overcrowding ana things
like the year-round school pro
gram are going to be with us for
a long time to come."
