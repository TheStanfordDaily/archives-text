Reagan approves MX missiles
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has decided
to build the MX missile and deploy it in Nevada and to
start production of the controversial B-1 bomber, ac
cording to administration officials.
Senior administration officials refused to give details
of the president's decision but said the widely expected
deployment of 100 MX missiles in about 1000 concrete
shelters and a go-ahead for production of 50 B-1 bomb
ers was not precisely what the president has approved.
However, other officials said the rotation of 100 MX
missiles among as many as 1000 shelters is the core of the
president's plan.
The decision is Reagan's major effort to close what he
calls "the window of vulnerability" to a possible attack
by the Soviet Union. The perceived vulnerability to a So
viet first strike results from improvement of Soviet war
heads to make them accurate enough to blow up U]S]
missiles in underground silos.
Officials said Reagan has chosen a scaled-down ver
sion of the MX plan approved by the Carter adminis
tration, rejecting Defense Secretary Caspar-Wein
berger's preference for deferral of a decision on deploy
ment of the MX missile for several years.
In addition to the MX and B-1, Reagan reportedly has
decided to go ahead with accelerated research and de
velopment on anti-ballistic missiles, on the D-5 Trident 11
missile for the Navy, on building very deep underground
protective shelters for possible future land-based mis
siles and on a method of basing missiles in planes that
could keep them aloft for long periods, officials said.
The president also has approved a major program to
strengthen the presidential and military command-and
control system that would be the communications
network during a war and to upgrade the nation's air de
fense system.
The MX and the B-1 have been by far the most con
troversial parts of the package. Both were the subject of
intense debate during the Carter administration.
The major argument against the B-1 is that once it be
gins to fly in 1986, Soviet air defenses may have improved
to the point it is an easy target.
Solidarity chides Walesa
Gdansk — Solidarity's national congress reprimanded
Lech Walesa and the rest of the independent union's rul
ing presidium yesterday for compromising with the
Polish government on the new worker self-management
law.
The delegates approved the presidium's overall per
formance, but by a vote of 348-189 said the "con
troverisal way of making the decision about workers'
self-management... (was) improper and shouldn't hap
pen again.
"Agreeing that making the decision was a result of the
need to assume an attitude before the Sejm (Parliament)
session, we have to state that a violation of the principles
of union democracy took place," they said.
Jacek Kuron, head of the disbanded dissident group
KOR was said to have been instrumental in convincing
three top union leaders to work out a compromise on
the law which many delegates feel is weak.
The law allows workers to share with the Communist
regime the naming of certain factory managers. Many
delegates wanted sole authority to approve the factory
bosses.
Before the vote, one delegate after another rose to de
nounce the leaders' compromise with the government

over the law, escalating the criticism that dominated the
congress for the past two days.
Walesa, who still is expected to be re-elected, re
sponded to the criticism by telling the delegates he
would personally guarantee the independence of Soli
darity, the first union free of Communist Party control in
the Soviet bloc.
"As long as I am leading this movement, no one, not
KOR not the church, not the party nor the government
will control it,"he shouted.
Reagan addresses third world
Washington — President Ronald Reagan told the
worlds's poor nations yesterday to "believe in the magic
of the marketplace" rather than aid from wealthier gov
ernments as the main route to achieving economic
progress and a higher standard of living.
In a welcoming address to the opening session of the
36th annual meeting of the World Bank and the Interna
tional Monetary Fund at the Sheraton-Washington ho
tel, Reagan pledged continued American support to the
two key lending institutions.
But he warned that unless each less developed nation
"puts its financial and economic house in order, no
amount of aid will produce progress." He urged them to
follow the example set not only by the United States but
also by fast-growing smaller economies, such as those in
Southeast Asia, which have performed spectacularly in
recent years while emphasizing the private sector.
Reagan's message was received politely and respect
fully by the 3200 of the 10,500 financial leaders and guests
registered for the annual meeting who were able to
crowd into the main hall. His call for the poor nations to
rely more on the free enterprise system was the latest
articulation of a determined American effort to reshape
both the IMF and World Bank.
In general, the American position is that government
aid to the poor nations must now be limited because of
domestic budget stringency. And in conformity with its
own ideology, the Reagan administration believes that
recipient countries shoud be encouraged to give a
warmer welcome to private business.
The president's call for the poor nations to trim their
budget deficits and follow tighter monetary policies was
echoed later in the session by IMF managing director
Jacques de Larosiere, who said in his annual address that
"this is a rough path indeed" but that "there is no other
path to follow."
Danger of Soviet 'military machine'
Washington — In a determined effort to convince Eu
ropeans and Americans of the Soviet military threat, the
Pentagon released a 99-page declassified report yester
day on "Soviet Military Power" that paints an awesome
portrait of the USSR as a military machine with an in
satiable appetite for planes, tanks, submarines and mis
siles.
There is no overall comparison in the new Soviet
threat report with potentially offsetting Western military
strengths. However those comparisons that are included
are primarily longstanding and well-known unfavorable
balances in tank, submarine and antiaircraft missile in
ventories and production. Thus, while neither Wein
berger nor the report goes so far as to proclaim that Mos
cow has overall military superiority over the West, that is
the impression left by the document.
Key points in the report and those made by Wein
berger include:

— The Soviets now have 4,8 million men under arms,
including more than 180 army divisions at various stages
of readiness, an increase of 30 divisions since 1967. Thirty
divisions, the ones most combat ready, are in Eastern Eu
rope while 80 more are in the western U]S]S]R] and some
70 are positioned near the Chinese and other Asian
borders.
— The Soviets have fielded 50,000 tanks and 20,000 ar
tillery pieces, and their current advantage of more than
three to one over the West in Europe in these categories
is expected to grow even larger.
— In each of the last eight years, the Soviets have pro
duced more than 1000 fighter planes, about double the
U]S] rate. More than 3500 Soviet and Warsaw Pact
fighters and fighter-bombers are now based in Eastern
Europe alone, outside of the Soviet Union, and the total
Soviet helicopter fleet now numbers more than 5200
craft.
Debt ceiling raised
Washington — The Senate gave final approval last
night to legislation permitting the government's debt to
exceed $1 trillion for time.
With Democrats forcing Republicans to lead the way,
the Senate voted, 64-34, to send the House-approved
measure to President Ronald Reagan, who is expected to
sign it today.
Faced with expiration of the current $985 billion debt
ceiling at midnight tonight, Reagan requested the new
limit of $1,079 trillion, an increase of $94 billion, to cover
the government's financing needs through Sept. 30,
1982.
The administration also sought, and won, a bill free of
amendments that would have forced the measure back
to the House, where it faced what Senate Majority Lead
er Howard Baker j*. (R-Tenn.) called an "uncertain
future."
Before the bill passed, it was subjected to a symbolic
filibuster by Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) and a rash of
largely Democratic attempts to attach riders, aimed
mainly at curtailing the size of Reagan's tax cut, which
Democrats contend will contribute to the ever-mount
ing national debt.

As added insurance in case of a tight vote, Vice Presi
dent George Bush made a rare appearance as presiding
officer of the Senate, and was prepared to break a tie
vote.
If the bill had not passed by tonight, the government
would have been without power to borrow, forcing a fi
nancing crisis that would have meant failure even to
honor Social Security checks put in the mail over the last
few days, Senate Finante Committee Chairman Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) warned during two days of debate on the
bill.
Although Democrats traditionally have led the way in
raising the debt ceiling to cover government obligations,
and suffering punishment at the polls from Republican
challengers from doing so, they were content last night
to sit back and let the Senate's GOP majority provide the
margin of victory, just as it did in February when Reagan
had to propose his first debt-ceiling increase.
Only after 45 Republicans voted for the bill did Demo
crats start voting for it in large numbers. In the end, 18
Democrats voted for passage, and only six Republicans
voted against it.
The symbolism of a trillion-dollar debt made it hard to
swallow for many members. It marks a thousandfold in
crease over the first billion-dollar debt, registered dur
ing World War l[ and an increase of more than threefold
over the last 20 years.
Investors grab price gains

points earlier in the day.
