# Compact spaces expand parking
## 
### Donald Howard 
In a response to the requests of the
University and Parking and Transpor
tation Committee, the University Of
fice of Planning and Development
has established a total of 185 new
high demand close-in parking
spaces. The new spaces were made
possible as a result of the reconstruc
tion of the Tresidder Union parking
lot and the restriping of the Law and
Forsythe lots.
According to Max Mazenko of the
Office of Planning and Develop
ment, the project cost approximately
$80,000 with money provided by the
General Plant Improvement Fund.
ASSU Senator Mark Epstein, who
was asked to give student input dur
ing the summer, said that the objec
tive of the project was to create more
"A" parking lot spaces, more visitor
parking, and to give better access to
students and in particular to handi
capped persons.
Mazenko said he feels the project,
which is nearing completion, has
shown his office to be "in touch with
the demand for better parking."

The 16 percent increase in high de
mand space was accomplished by im
proved space utilization and an in
crease in the number of compact car
spaces according to Planning Depart
ment press release. Converting the
Tresidder lot to one-way traffic now
allows room for parallel parking. In
addition, parking spaces for handi
capped persons have been desig
nated and new access ramps have
been built.
The decisions to increase the
number of compact car spaces has
been a controversial one. The new
spaces are one foot narrower than
the standard 81/2 foot slots originally
usedf, and require more driver atten
tion when parking. Mazenko said he
sees the project as an attempt to take
advantage of the fact that cars have
gotten smaller.
Several people have voiced con
cern over the inconvenience and
danger of damage with the use of
smaller spaces. Kathleen Spence, an
employee at Marcel's, commented,
"It looks just as crowded but now the
spaces are reallv small. It doesn't look

like it alleviated the problem at all,"
she said.
Many of those using the lot on
Monday said they appreciate the ad
ditional spaces. Most of the favorable
responses, however, came from the
owners of compact cars. Mazenko
said that "there are certain tradeoffs
which must be made." Facilities Engi
neer John Lerry said he agreed that
"the plusses far outweigh the mi
nuses. We gain so many more spaces
in areas where we're so desperately
short."
Other campus planning projects
include new parking lots behind
Branner and Toyon halls, the com
pletion of paths for both bicyclists
and pedestrians, a Campus Drive ex
tension and a landscaping project
which will direct cyclists and pedes
trians to different paths between the
post office and the bookstore. Im
provements in parking lots at the
Stanford Medical Center are still in
the planning stages. According to
Mazenko, the department is "just
getting geared up."
