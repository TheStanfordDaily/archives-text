## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
With a campaign fund of $400,000
and belief in the support of corpo
rate Republican leaders in California,
Menlo Park Representative Paul
'Pete' McCloskey said he intends to
be California's next senator.
McCloskey announced his can
didacy Monday during stops
throughout the state. The Re
publican congressman originally in
tended to delay his announcement.
"I planned to keep my candidacy
underground until December," Mc-
Closkey said in a phone interview
from Santa Barbara. "But my good
friend (San Diego Mayor) Pete
Wilson was exploiting my unarinoun
cement as an uncertainty."
McCloskey asked members of his
recently formed "Senate Advisory
Committee" — which consists of 286
Republican corporate leaders inCali
fornia — for advice. He said the vote
was 258 to 4 "to go for it."
The congressman, who turned 54
yesterday, said he felt his current
popularity over other Republican
senate candidates in two California
polls justifies his early announce
ment.
A poll conducted by The Los An
geles Times in July, however, placed
McCloskey third in popularity, with
16 percent, behind Republican Barry
Goldwater (31 percent) and Senator
S. I. Hayakawa (21 percent).
The California Poll, conducted in
August by Field Research of San Fran
cisco, also put McCloskey in third
place with 16 percent. In this poll
Goldwater had 24 percent and Hay
akawa had 19 percent.
McCloskey said he believes that

Hayakawa, who is 76, is too old for
the job and that Goldwater has re
cently lost popularity.
The congressman said he expects
little contest against Governor Jerry
Brown, who also intends to run for
Hayakawa's seat. The California Poll
indicated McCloskey held 50 to 38
percent popularity over Brown
should the two be paired off in the
November 1982 elections.

McCloskey labeled the governor
"one of the canniness politicians
around."
"Brown is a careful observer of
what the public wants to believe and
hear, and then says what public wants
to believe and hear."
McCloskey cited, as a example,
Brown's recent about-face on the use
of aerial spraying, a tactic he had for
merly opposed to combat the medf
ly. McCloskey said that he, himself,
has supported aerial spraying since
last May.
Initially, McCloskey planned to
withold his candidacy announce
ment until he had $1.5 million in his
campaign till. He has now launched
his campaign with $400,000 in thecof
fers.
McCloskey's television campaign
is budgeted for $85,000 and his print
campaign is estimated at $44,000, ac
cording to his San Francisco advertis
ing firm.
Anne Brown, Menlo Park-based
press relations coordinator for Mc-
Closkey, said financial support for
the congressman is rising. She said
she does not expect the coffers to run
dry.
McCloskey is a 1950 graduate of
Stanford University. He graduated
from Stanford Law School in 1953 and
was the deputy district attorney for
Alameda prior to his election to con
gress in 1967. He has held his con
gressional seat for 14 years.
According to McCloskey's cam
paign manager, judith Brown, the
candidate will concentrate on four is
sues during his campaign: opposi
tion to a bilingual voting ballot; bal
ancing the budget; developing a
program permitting illegal aliens to
gain work legally and
or legal residence; and developing
an alternative
service proposal to the draft.
This service proposal would offer
eligble candidates four alternatives
