# Suicide: Local groups seek to educate public
## 
### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
A few weeks into the new quarter,
a student becomes depressed. She's
anxious about school, family, per
sonal relationships or money. She
gradually withdraws from social life.
She may talk to her friends about
feeling disappointed. More often she
doesn't speak directly about her de
pression.
This student could try to kill
herself.
She might be fortunate enough to
find help before she becomes des
perate. Or she could join the half
dozen others who became Stanford's
suicide statistics last year.
A common concern about the
number of suicides at Stanford in the
past year prompted a meeting Friday
of several representatives of helping
agencies in an attempt to explore
better interagency and campus-wide
communication about the problem.
More than 200 suicides are re
ported each year in Santa Clara coun
ty, with an estimated three times that
number reported as accidents. Eight
times as many people attempt suicide
as complete it. Females are far more
likely to attempt to kill themselves
than males, but male suicides out
number females six to one. Crisis in
tervention professionals attribute the
ratio to males' choice of faster, more
violent means.
Suicide is second only to accidents
as the major cause of death for peo
ple under the age of twenty, and col

lege students aged 20-29 are more
prone to suicide than their un
enrolled counterparts.
Dr. David Kaplan of the Help Cen
ter said he believes potential suicides
could be helped by greater public
awareness of University counseling
services.
While each agency approaches the
situation differently, representatives
agreed communication with a poten
tial suicide is vital. But, sometimes, in
formal support is more effective than
professional counseling.
Distressed people often cannot ask
for help. According to Charlotte Ross
of the San Mateo Suicide Prevention
Center, people can be educated to
recognize a critical situation.
Meg Paris, program coordinator of
the Santa Clara Suicide Prevention
and Crisis Center, says eight of ten
people who kill themselves give prior
warning. Clues that point to a de
cision to commit suicide include giv
ing away possessions, talk of suicide,
and mood switches from depression
to elation or the reverse.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Sylvia
Castillo, a psychiatric social worker,
interviewed families and friends of
suicide victims in an attempt to re
construct events that led to their de
cision to take their own lives.
According to Castillo, the decision
is almost always tied to some event or
incident. (The Bridge's peer counsel
or training manual lists major
changes that can lead to severe de
pression, such as loss of a loved one,
physical illness, loss of job, financial

stress or a move to a new place.)
Another common denominator of
people who want to kill themselves is
a feeling of isolation, that there is no
one to turn to and no alternatives are
available.
Jeff Clark, of the Stanford Counsel
ing Institute, said "People don't
come in until they're desperate."
Clark suggested that information
packets detailing where to turn to for
help in crisis situations be included
with registration materials.
Although all of Stanford's suicide
victims last year were in good aca
demic standing, Police Chief Marv
Herrington said he believes the
"pressure cooker" atmosphere here
can contribute to feelings of hope
lessness.
"If you can't find a relief valve for
that pressure," Herrington said, "it's
never going to go away."
What can friends do to help people
they fear may harm themselves?
Castillo said she believes the best
action to take when somene isdeeply
depressed is an expression of sup
port. "Let them know you're con
cerned about them."
When a person begins to exhibit
symptoms of depression, Castillo
said, roommates and friends often
feel helpless. "They think they're in
vading someone's privacy" if they
suggest counseling, she said.
In addition to two county suicide
hotlines, The Bridge provides anony
mous peer counseling for people
who are depressed or in trouble.
Four live-in counselors take calls

from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. every night.
Counselor Susan Larsen em
phasized the importance of provid
ing someone to talk to. She said The
Bridge receives four or five suicide
related calls each quarter, though
winter and spring quarters seem to
be more difficult times for people.
When they receive a call, Bridge
counselors try to first assess the
lethality of a situation and get help to
someone who needs immediate
medical attention. The next step is to
try to distance the depressed person
from her situation. After a trusting re
lationship is established, counselors
attempt to explore alternatives.
"We try to emphasize immediate,
short-term plans," Larsen said, "like
asking, 'what's one thing you can do
tomorrow that will make you feel
better?"
Another technique is to make a
bargain with someone in trouble so
that she will call back before decid
ing to commit suicide
The Santa Clara hotline is staffed by
65 volunteers, a third of whom are
Stanford graduate students. The San
ta Clara Center provides workshops
and training for people over 21 who,
want to work in crisis intervention.
The next training session for
screened volunteers will be held No
vember 14 and 15.
Dr. Vince D'Andrea of Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS)
said Residential Education provides a
forum for teaching how to work with
people in crisis. In CAPS workshops,
Resident Assistants are trained to rec
ognize and cope with potential sui
cides.
"We're doing about as much as
anybody can do," said D'Andrea. He
said CAPS works with more than 100
depressed people each year.
D'Andrea concluded, "The impor
tant thing is that they are able to look
for, reach out, and accept support
from people."

a student becomes depressed. She's
anxious about school, family, per
sonal relationships or money. She
gradually withdraws from social life.
She may talk to her friends about
feeling disappointed. More often she
doesn't speak directly about her de
pression.
This student could try to kill
herself.
She might be fortunate enough to
find help before she becomes des
perate. Or she could join the half
dozen others who became Stanford's
suicide statistics last year.
A common concern about the
number of suicides at Stanford in the
past year prompted a meeting Friday
of several representatives of helping
agencies in an attempt to explore
better interagency and campus-wide
communication about the problem.
More than 200 suicides are re
ported each year in Santa Clara coun
ty, with an estimated three times that
number reported as accidents. Eight
times as many people attempt suicide
as complete it. Females are far more
likely to attempt to kill themselves
than males, but male suicides out
number females six to one. Crisis in
tervention professionals attribute the
ratio to males' choice of faster, more
violent means.
Suicide is second only to accidents
as the major cause of death for peo
ple under the age of twenty, and col

lege students aged 20-29 are more
prone to suicide than their un
enrolled counterparts.
Dr. David Kaplan of the Help Cen
ter said he believes potential suicides
could be helped by greater public
awareness of University counseling
services.
While each agency approaches the
situation differently, representatives
agreed communication with a poten
tial suicide is vital. But, sometimes, in
formal support is more effective than
professional counseling.
Distressed people often cannot ask
for help. According to Charlotte Ross
of the San Mateo Suicide Prevention
Center, people can be educated to
recognize a critical situation.
Meg Paris, program coordinator of
the Santa Clara Suicide Prevention
and Crisis Center, says eight of ten
people who kill themselves give prior
warning. Clues that point to a de
cision to commit suicide include giv
ing away possessions, talk of suicide,
and mood switches from depression
to elation or the reverse.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Sylvia
Castillo, a psychiatric social worker,
interviewed families and friends of
suicide victims in an attempt to re
construct events that led to their de
cision to take their own lives.
According to Castillo, the decision
is almost always tied to some event or
incident. (The Bridge's peer counsel
or training manual lists major
changes that can lead to severe de
pression, such as loss of a loved one,
physical illness, loss of job, financial

stress or a move to a new place.)
Another common denominator of
people who want to kill themselves is
a feeling of isolation, that there is no
one to turn to and no alternatives are
available.
Jeff Clark, of the Stanford Counsel
ing Institute, said "People don't
come in until they're desperate."
Clark suggested that information
packets detailing where to turn to for
help in crisis situations be included
with registration materials.
Although all of Stanford's suicide
victims last year were in good aca
demic standing, Police Chief Marv
Herrington said he believes the
"pressure cooker" atmosphere here
can contribute to feelings of hope
lessness.
"If you can't find a relief valve for
that pressure," Herrington said, "it's
never going to go away."
What can friends do to help people
they fear may harm themselves?
Castillo said she believes the best
action to take when somene isdeeply
depressed is an expression of sup
port. "Let them know you're con
cerned about them."
When a person begins to exhibit
symptoms of depression, Castillo
said, roommates and friends often
feel helpless. "They think they're in
vading someone's privacy" if they
suggest counseling, she said.
In addition to two county suicide
hotlines, The Bridge provides anony
mous peer counseling for people
who are depressed or in trouble.
Four live-in counselors take calls

from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. every night.
Counselor Susan Larsen em
phasized the importance of provid
ing someone to talk to. She said The
Bridge receives four or five suicide
related calls each quarter, though
winter and spring quarters seem to
be more difficult times for people.
When they receive a call, Bridge
counselors try to first assess the
lethality of a situation and get help to
someone who needs immediate
medical attention. The next step is to
try to distance the depressed person
from her situation. After a trusting re
lationship is established, counselors
attempt to explore alternatives.
"We try to emphasize immediate,
short-term plans," Larsen said, "like
asking, 'what's one thing you can do
tomorrow that will make you feel
better?"
Another technique is to make a
bargain with someone in trouble so
that she will call back before decid
ing to commit suicide
The Santa Clara hotline is staffed by
65 volunteers, a third of whom are
Stanford graduate students. The San
ta Clara Center provides workshops
and training for people over 21 who,
want to work in crisis intervention.
The next training session for
screened volunteers will be held No
vember 14 and 15.
Dr. Vince D'Andrea of Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS)
said Residential Education provides a
forum for teaching how to work with
people in crisis. In CAPS workshops,
Resident Assistants are trained to rec
ognize and cope with potential sui
cides.
"We're doing about as much as
anybody can do," said D'Andrea. He
said CAPS works with more than 100
depressed people each year.
D'Andrea concluded, "The impor
tant thing is that they are able to look
for, reach out, and accept support
from people."
