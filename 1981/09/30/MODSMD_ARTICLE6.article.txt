# Getaway Special
## Science Student experiments can be launched in space shuttle 
### Ken Mertzel 
Students who have always
dreamed of taking part in
NASA's space exploration pro
grams will now have the
chance with the "Getaway Spe
cial." This program gives ev
eryone the chance to place an
experiment aboard the Space
Shuttle.
The Small Self-Contained
Payload Program, or "Getaway
Special" reserves a five cubic
foot cylindrical cannister
aboard the Space Shuttle for
$10,000. According to Kathy
McGrade, president of the
Stanford Students for Space
Development, this program of
fers unique scientific possi
bilities since experimentation
aboard the Space Shuttle can
be exposed to zero gravity, a
perfect vacuum, and high solar
radiation. For example, the ef
fect of zero gravity on crystal
growth or on living organisms
can be tested. The only restric
tions are that the experiment
be completely safe and have
scientific merit.
This quarter Stanford stu
dents will have the opportunity
to participate in the "Getaway
Special" program.
"The beauty of this program
is that it is notonlyanengineer
ing problem," McGrade said,
"We could use marketing peo
ple, legal people, technical
managers, and technical jour
nalists as well."
Aiding McGrade in leading
this project will be faculty ad
visor Dr. Peter Banks, a new
professor in radio science who
previously organized a
"Getaway Special" at the Uni
versity of Utah.
The "Getaway Special" pro
gram will operate as follows —
first, there will be an organiza
tional meeting on Monday,
Oct. 5 where experiment pro
posals will be taken. Once one
or two proposals have been ap-
the idea must be for
mally presented to a few large
companies in order to obtain
sponsorship, covering the
$10,000 to purchase the can
nister, plus additional funds to
cover the costs of hardware.
Next, engineers will be needed
to develop the hardware (i.e.
computers) to run the experi
ment. Then the experiment
will be thoroughly tested at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratories in
Pasadena, California, and sub
sequently taken to NASA's
Kennedy Space Center in Cape
Canaveral, Florida for
launching. The final step will
involve analyzing the data and
forming conclusions.
The experiment itself must
be totally automated. All
power must be supplied in
ternally. The astronaut will
have three switches — on/off,
fast/slow, high/low — which
can be manually operated to
control the experiment during
the average three to four day
Eeriod the spacecraft is in or
it. \

The space shuttle may carry Stanford students' experiments as early as 1983.
