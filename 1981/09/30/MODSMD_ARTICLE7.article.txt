# Solar power from space
## 
### Laurie Rackas 
A solar power station in
space has long been predicted
by science fiction writers and
space enthusiasts alike. This
prediction is on its way to be
coming a reality at Lockheed
Missiles and Space, Inc., of
Sunnyvale, where a space solar
power system is being de
signed for the United States Air
Force. The system could be
used for advanced military op
erations and would be
launched by the space shuttle.
Last year, Lockheed's Elec
trical Power Systems Depart
ment received a three-year
contract from the Air Force
Aeropropulsion Laboratory at
Wrignt/ Patterson Air Force
Base, Ohio, to develop a model
for a High Voltage High Power
(HVHP) automatic solar power
system. The HVHP can power
radar systems and lasers that
are used for defense, for com
munication, or for power
transmission.
The first phase of the study
involves a technology search
for the components of the
HVHP system. Lockheed de
veloped performance models
of the critical components to
define their weight, efficiency,
thermal capabilities, and other
important design factors.
Based on data from the per
formance models, Lockheed
will formulate a design for a
10-50 kilowatt power system.
Most satellites now operate on
2-3 kilowatts.
"Developing such a high
power system will require tne
most advanced power compo
nents and technology available
in the late 1980s," said Bob Cor
bett, project leader for the

HVHP study. The HVHP study
group will identify existing
technology that could be used,
and pinpoint areas where tech
nology will have to be de
veloped.
The toughest problem in de
vising a high power system is
reducing weight. Satellites now
average 1-3 watts of power out
put per pound. Lockheed's
goal is to develop a system
whose power-to-weight ratio is

'Developing such a high pqwer system
will require the most advanced power
components and technology available
in the late 1980s/

anywhere from three to five
times that high. The high ratio
will be achieved by using thin,
efficient solar cells, high-tem
perature alkali-metal batteries,
and high-voltage control and
distribution systems.
An additional problem is de
signing the HVHP to meet the
needs of the Air Force in the
19905. The Air Force space mis
sion profiles range from low
earth orbit, defined as 300-800
miles above the earth's surface,
to geosynchronous orbit
(22,500 miles), and possibly
higher. Different power system
designs are reauired for each
orbit. Lockheed is focusing on
mid-altitude and inclined or
bits, since they receive wide at
tention in various Department
of Defense studies.
The system would be
launched into low orbit by the

space shuttle. A "tug" would
be needed to take the HVHP
system from low into high or
bit.
Larry Chidester, manager of
Lockheed's Electrical Power
Systems Department, stressed
that the contract is for the de
sign, not the construction, of
the HVHP system. When asked
if he thougnt the Air Force in
tended to build it, he said, "If it
looks feasible enough to the

group with the money, then
they will develop a program."
The HVHP system is being
designed solely for military
use. Chidester expressed
doubts that the system would
have any commercial applica
tions, mainly due to the very
high cost of the materials
needed for its construction.
However, Lockheed is work
ing on other systems for com
mercial use. Chidester's de
partment just completed a
study for a "Multi-100 Kilowatt
Solar Array Development."
The idea, Chidester said, was to
"develop a 600-kilowatt power
system for a space power sta
tion prototype." Essentially it is
a plan to build a $30 billion ve
hicle consisting of several acres
of solar cells which would gen
erate power that would tnen
be microwaved to earth.

will require the most advanced power
components and technology available
in the late 1980s/

anywhere from three to five
times that high. The high ratio
will be achieved by using thin,
efficient solar cells, high-tem
perature alkali-metal batteries,
and high-voltage control and
distribution systems.
An additional problem is de
signing the HVHP to meet the
needs of the Air Force in the
19905. The Air Force space mis
sion profiles range from low
earth orbit, defined as 300-800
miles above the earth's surface,
to geosynchronous orbit
(22,500 miles), and possibly
higher. Different power system
designs are reauired for each
orbit. Lockheed is focusing on
mid-altitude and inclined or
bits, since they receive wide at
tention in various Department
of Defense studies.
The system would be
launched into low orbit by the

space shuttle. A "tug" would
be needed to take the HVHP
system from low into high or
bit.
Larry Chidester, manager of
Lockheed's Electrical Power
Systems Department, stressed
that the contract is for the de
sign, not the construction, of
the HVHP system. When asked
if he thougnt the Air Force in
tended to build it, he said, "If it
looks feasible enough to the

group with the money, then
they will develop a program."
The HVHP system is being
designed solely for military
use. Chidester expressed
doubts that the system would
have any commercial applica
tions, mainly due to the very
high cost of the materials
needed for its construction.
However, Lockheed is work
ing on other systems for com
mercial use. Chidester's de
partment just completed a
study for a "Multi-100 Kilowatt
Solar Array Development."
The idea, Chidester said, was to
"develop a 600-kilowatt power
system for a space power sta
tion prototype." Essentially it is
a plan to build a $30 billion ve
hicle consisting of several acres
of solar cells which would gen
erate power that would tnen
be microwaved to earth.
