## Frosh visit Kennedy at home 
### Louise Solomon 
Held outdoors on President
Kennedy's rolling front lawn,
doused in California sunshine,
yesterday's reception for the
freshmen class was an event
filled with wry humour,
"whackiness" and just plain
fun.
Freshmen's reasons for at
tending included the possi
bility of "free food," "curiousi
ty," "because everybody else
was coming," and of course,
the general desire to "shake
hands with the big guy."
At the edge of the front lawn
was a table surrounded by a
throng of students who were
filling out nametags.
"Look at that house," said
one freshman. "Look how big
it is. How many peole do you
think live there?" she asked.
"Two," replied a voice from
the crowd.
"I think whoever draws
number one next year should
get this house,"said one wom
an, as she sat perched upon the
ledge of the flat-top roof which
overlooks the whole campus
and the Bay.
Many of the comments
about the afternoon's event
did in fact center around the
President's "beautiful house,"
which was built by Mr. and
Mrs. Herbert Hoover in
1919-20. "It's nice to see the
place,"said one orientation
volunteer. "A lot of up
perclassmen don't even know
where it is," he said.
"The house is very, very
nice,"said one freshman. "It's
what I expected for the presi
dent of an institution like this,"

she said.
President and Mrs. Kennedy
recieved the freshmen on a
canopied terrace which jutted
out over the lawn.
"I mentioned holding (the
reception) for the first time,
but it was obviously something
we both wanted to do," Mrs.
Kennedy said. "When we had
the graduating seniors up, they
mentioned it was their first
time here," she said. "If you ask
them as freshmen and you ask
them as seniors, at least you see
them twice,"she said.
This is the first time they've
done this,"said one of the stu
dents. "It gives you a sense of
continuity,"she said, on a simi
lar note.
Laughter and good cheer
seemed to surround the Ken
nedys. Four freshmen came
through the line twice after
Kennedy told them he had a
photographic memory. The
second time through they cov
ered up their nametags and
asked him to guess who they
were. When he recognized
them as second-timers, he
threatened that for trying to
fool him they would have to
tell him "their adjectives."
When asked for a few anec
dotes about the reception,
Kennedy said, "The only prob
lem is where to start — there's
so many whacky people here.
People would come through a
second time and then try to
persuade me that they were
twins," he said.
"There were seven people
named Kennedy who insisted
rather irreverently, on refer
ring to me as 'Dad,' " he said.

One student asked for Presi-*
dent and Mrs. Kennedy's auto
graphs on a map of the house,
and the Kennedys took turns
leaning on each others' backs.
When this freshman asked the
President to autograph the
map on the bedroom, Ken
nedy joked back,"Don't you
think that's getting'a little per
sonal?"
"I appreciate Dr. and Mrs.
Kennedy for providing the op
portunity for us to come to
their home," said one student,
dressed in a pale blue suit and
dress shirt.
"The only problem with this
affair is no one knows how t£
dress," said another freshman,
who was wearing a T-shirt, blue
jeans, and thongs.
"I think this reflects Ken
nedy's personality — his
openness with the students
and his commitment to under
graduate education," said an
other freshman.
"I wish he'd made some kind
of speech,"said one student. "I
always have time to hear some
thing from him," he said, when
asked if he wasn't tired of
speeches after the past week.
"This just makes me like him
more," said another freshman.
Someone else suggested
holding it on two different days
so that they could speak to him
a little, rather "than just shake
hands."
"It's a nice gesture, but kind
of pointless," another student
said. "It's stupid/'she said.
On the other hand, a group
of four students agreed that,
"Weshould dothiseveryTues
day."
