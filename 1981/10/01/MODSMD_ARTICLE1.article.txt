# ASSU tries to make up deficit
## Coffee House boosts prices 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
A recent price hike at the ASSU
Coffee House has drawn attention to
the goals and purposes of the stu
dent-run corporation and its relation
to the needs of the student body.
Price increases of up to 50 percent
for some articles have caused some
annoyance, but a greater degree of
understanding exists among regular
customers, Coffee House workers
say.
According to Coffee House man
ager Steve Weiss, the increases were
necessary because the restaurant suf
fered a $25,000 loss over the past year.
"We are not trying to make up for a
year-end's loss," he said. "We're just
trying to do a break-even business.
But with the small profit margin for
which we plan, as low as one cent per *
item, we can not afford any loss —
through food waste for example," he
said.
Contract terms
Under the terms of the Coffee
House's contract with Tresidder
Union, all price increases can be in
stituted only at the beginning of a
quarter, and are subject to approval
by the Tresidder management. Weiss
said the increases are experimental,
and if found to be excessive, may be
cut back attheendofautumnorwin
ter quarter.
Cnris Greene, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents and pres
ident of the Coffee House Board of
Directors, said the goal of Coffee

House Inc. is to provide a campus fa
cility to benefit the community both
as an employer and as a restaurant
service.
"In both these functions," he
claimed, "we have succeeded. The
future of the Coffee house is bright."
Senate loans
In 1980, when the Coffee House
first became owned and operated by
students, theASSU Senate approved
a loan of $50,000 for Coffee House
Inc. to revitalize the existing facility.
Weiss and the Coffee House Board of
Directors borrowed approximately
$17,000 from that allocation. This
year's losses have required that the
restaurant borrow another $20,000.
Greene said the new loan was a
gesture by the ASSU to reaffirm the
commitment of the student body to
the student-run Coffee House. The
loan will be used to reimburse sup
pliers whose services are crucial to
the operation of the restaurant.
Employee response
Response to the price hike was var
ied among the employees of the Cof
fee House. Andy Kaiser, who ex
pressed satisfaction with the working
environment and the overall at
mosphere of the restaurant, praised
the management but said the prices
were now too high. Jeanne Barkey,
being trained as a shift manager, said
most people were very much behind
the price increase.
"We all want to make this thing
(the Coffee House) work, any way we

can," she said.
Carrie Little, a shift manager who
has been with the Coffee House
since its student-ownership, said it
has gone through a lot of changes,
and is doing better now than ever
before.
"The people are wonderful," she
said. "It's a great place to work."
All the employees interviewed
agreed that working with the rest of
the staff was bv far the most reward
ing aspect of their work experience,
and that it was something that they
could not have gotten anywhere else
at the University.
Customer reactions
Despite the overwhelmingly
positive attitude taken by the em
ployees of the Coffee House con
cerning the price-hike, customers
greeted the sudden change with
something less than pleasure. But on
the whole, business has not appeared
to have suffered extensively.
Weiss and the Board of Directors
are considering other changes to re
duce operating costs, including re
ducing the number of people work
ing on each shift. Weiss refuses to re
duce the percentage of student em
ployees from between 90 and 95 per
cent, which would lower labor costs
somewhat. "Student employment is
one of the main functions of the Cof
fee House, providing a unique learn
ing experience to almost 120 stu
dents. We can't drop that," he said.
One of the main problems with in

creasing the profit margin to bring
the Coffee House out or debt is that
although 80 percent of sales occur in
the sandwich and food lines, 80 per
cent of the revenue is produced by
sale of beverages. Because of the size
of the facility, sales of beer and wine
are limited, and potential consumers
are discouraged by the length of the
line and the lack of space available
for alcohol consumption (limited to
the interior by the liquor license).
Increasing the size of the facility
would alleviate the crush, and allow
an increase in beverage sales. A pro
posed enclosed patio is under con
sideration by Tresidder man
agement, but will not be built before
spring quarter.
Other changes in thefuture will in
clude limitea table service, which
should begin for the dinner hours
soon. The Coffee House Board has
also proposed extensive renovation
of the interior of the facility to im
prove conditions and adapt it more
nearly to the present operation of the
restaurant.
Greg Larson, assistant director of
Tresidder, said Tresidder adminis
trators were distinctly displeased
with the price increases, ana reluc
tantly approved them. "We have two
major areas of concern regarding the
Cotfee House: first, we feel that their
accounting methods are not good,'
and that this drastic mark-up needn't
have happened. Also, we want to dis
pel the 'we-they' feelings between
the Coffee House and the
(Union) Crossroads (operated by
Servomation)," he said.
"The Coffee House has been really
great, though, showing a 68 percent
increase in business over tne past
year, and we are trying to implement
some of their operating innovations
into our other facilities around cam
pus — in particular, their percentage
of student employees. In the future,
though, we will take a more active
role in their price increases, trying to
prevent such a sudden increase from
nappening again," he added.
This summer, The Coffee House
hired an outside accounting firm to
audit its books and review account
ing procedures. The firm found no
major faults with the system, but
noted that the operation seemed to
be running on a very small margin of
expected profit.

in an attempt, directors say, to recover losses suffered last year.
