# Labour backs Irish unity
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Brighton, England â€”The op
position Labour Party adopted
a resolution Tuesday calling for
the ultimate reunification of
the independent Republic of
Ireland and the British prov
ince of Northern Ireland.
It was the first time that a ma
jor British political party had of
ficially endorsed reunification
as an eventual goal for the
troubled island of Ireland.
But the resolution was
carefully phrased, insisting that
the one million Protestants of
Northern Ireland give their
"consent" before the six coun
t.es of the north are merged
with the 26 of the pre
dominantly Roman Catholic
south.
But the Labour Party mem
bers at their annual conference

here specifically rejected a res
olution that called for Britain to
immediately withdraw its
troops from Northern Ireland,
and another that called for
Labour support for the hunger
strike by Irish nationalist pris
oners at Maze prison outside
Belfast.
Instead, the party rejected
violence and terrorism as a
means toward achieving re
unification, and it also rejected
political status for Irish Re
publican Army prisoners in
northern Ireland, the goal of
the hunger strikers.
Premature withdrawal of
British troops, conference
chairman Alex Kitson said,
could lead to civil war between
activists of the province's Prot
estant majority and Catholic
minority.
