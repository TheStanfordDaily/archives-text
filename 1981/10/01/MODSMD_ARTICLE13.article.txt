Scholarships and fellowships
for study abroad provide stu
dents an excellent opportunity
to gain cross-cultural ex
perience and pursue advanced
research in their academic area
of interest, according to Cath
erine Gamon, assistant director
for overseas resources here.
Though the Fulbright Schol
arship is one of the most well
known of the college grants,
other scholarships offered to
college graduates in the United
States include the Rhodes,
Marshall and Churchill schol
arships, ail of which are ex
cellent for students interested
in studying abroad.
"Many people are in
timidated by the prestige of
these programs and don't app
ly," said Gamon, "but many
Stanford students are eligible
and should investigate the pro
grams." Study abroad can help
a person learn about another
country, their own academic
interest and themselves."
The Instituteof International
Education, a private founda
tion, administers the Fulbright
and related grants. There are
approximately 500 awards
available each year for study in
approximately 50 countries.
Some countries, such as Kenya,
sponsor only one candidate
while others such as West Ger
many sponsor 155 scholars.
Applicants for Fulbright and
related grants must nave a
bachelor's degree before they
can study abroad. Seniors can

apply during the fall quarter of
their senior year. Each appli
cant must propose a study
project.
After submitting an applica
tion, the student is interviewed
by a team of three faculty
members and graduate stu
dents. This committee eval
uates the applicant for "aca
demic or professional quali
fications, validity and feasibility
of proposed project, language
qualifictions, personal suit
ability, knowledge of host
country, and the impression
the candidate will makeabroad
as a citizen of the United
States."
The applicant is ranked on a
point scale for each of these
categories, but no one is cut at
this level. The applications are
then forwarded to the national
screening committee, which
makes some cuts before send
ing the applications to the re
spective host countries. Final
notification of award recipients
occurs between May and Au
gust.
Campus deadline for applic
tions for the 1982-83 Fulbright
and related grants is Oct. 12, as
the campus committee must
have all applications to the In
stitute of International Educa
tion by Oct. 31. A special meet
ing will be held for applicants
on Thursday, Oct. 2 at the
Bechtel International Center.
