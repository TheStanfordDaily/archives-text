## Viewpoint/John Cooper Time to settle differences, remain friendly with Japan 
### 
A serious concern is developing
over Japanese relations with the
United States. In fact, relations may
be described as strained, even
though the two nations will undoub
tedly remain close partners.
Several incidents help explain this
situation. One is the flap over a US
submarine colliding with a Japanese
ship, causing loss of life and property.
After the incident, the US submarine
commander admitted violating in
ternational law by leaving the scene.
Another conflict arose when the
Japanese claimed that the US Navy
damaged their fishing lines.
11l feelings held by the United
States toward Japan are even
stronger. Washington is intensely
concerned over the balance-of
payments problem. The Reagan ad
ministration perceives that Japan has
done little to relieve the problem,
while it continues to obstruct im
portation of US agricultural and oth
er products.
The automobile exporting issue
has been temporarily resolved by
Japan's agreement to a voluntary
quota. Both countries, however,
know that the quota does not con
stitute a real solution. The American
auto industry is suffering from high
labor costs, poor quality work
manship and unions that impede au
tomation and the use of robots. Thus,
if the Japanese believe in free trade as
they claim to, the voluntary quota is
not a long-run solution. On the other
hand, by preventing the importation
of American products, the Japanese
government knows it is protecting
many of its own inefficient industries
against American competition.
Against this uncomfortable back
drop, Reagan is pressuring the
Japanese government to increase its
defense spending. As far as Washing
ton is concerned, Tokyo is not paying
its fair share. Moreover, the Reagan
administration is linking the defense

issue to the balance of trade prob
lem. They are clearly related, since
the US is paying a high price to pro
vide Japan the security it needs, but
doesn't want to pay for.
In response, Japanese leaders are
telling the Reagan administration
that the United States must under
stand the problem of a public that
does not want to spend more on de
fense. Japanese public opinion polls
definitely reflect this feeling. Leaders
also point out that goingagainst pub
lic opinion would hurt the ruling
conservative Liberal-Democratic Par
ty in coming elections.

However, it is unclear to what ex
tent Reagan and his advisers are con
vinced of this argument. Public opin
ion has been against spending more
for defense for years â€” unrealisticlly
so. USofficialsand many Japanese of
ficials and scholars believe that it
would be best for japan to start re
arming now, instead of waiting until a
crisis occurs, when there may be pub
lic pressure to arm more than the
country actually requires.
Some American observers also feel
that the Liberal-Democratic Party is
not really in danger and that it could
even profit by showing leadership
and initiative on defense issues. Even
though the opposition parties re
cently created an issue over the fact
that US ships carrying atomic weap
ons were using Japanese ports, when
the practice has been going on for a

long time, the number of political
demonstrators was significantly
smaller than in the past.
The Reagan administration seems
to feel that the balance-of-trade situ
ation and Japan's niggardly defense
spending are serious problems that
demand decisive action on the part
of Japanese leaders, or Washington
must and will act. And US public
opinion polls can be cited on the
American side for the need for ac
tion.
Past US presidents have observed
that Japan does not act until forced to
do so. Reagan appears to want to get
the Japanese to act on their own. But
they seem to perceive that if they
don't act, Reagan will.
The balance-of-trade matter can
be resolved by Japan opening its
markets to more American products
and ending its unofficial protec
tionism. Japanese leaders apparently
realized that the auto issue had to be
temporarily resolved or Congress
would have imposed restrictive
tariffs or quotas. Whether they can or
will act on the overall trade problem
is uncertain. The United States could
respond by limiting its general trade
with Japan, hurting Japan more than
the United States.
On the defense issue, Japanese
leaders need to present a strong case
for a larger defense budget and a
gradual increase in defense spend
ing. The government must convince
the Japanese public that Japan is un
derarmed and that the United States
has permanently withdrawn many of
its forces from the region. They must
also inform the public that a slow and
carefully planned defense buiJdup is
preferable to a crisis-reaction type of
rearmament.
