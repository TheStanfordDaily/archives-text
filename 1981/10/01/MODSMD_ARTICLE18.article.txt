# Viewpoint/Gary Ferries
## Without ERA we are still far from ideal of sexual equality 
### 
As we enter the 80s, it may be "downright
upright" for a woman to ask a man over for a,
drink, but it could be economically imprac
tical. The average woman's salary remains 41
percent lower than that of the average man.
Symbolically, "you've come a long way
baby," but in terms of real progress, you're
still down on your hands and knees. There is
much more to true "liberation" than being '
able to tout feminine protection products in
prime time and smoke cigarettes in public.
Of course, not all of the symbolic gains
should bedismissed lightly. Inthedaysof my
misspent youth, you could go to the family
drive-in and hear virginal Hayley Mills
warble:
"You must walk — Feminine
Talk — Feminine
Smile and be gay — Feminine
Fem-i-nin-i-ty
That's what every girl should know
If she wants to catch a beau."
These days not even Disney can get away with
such tripe. Now it takes a star of the magnitude
of Olivia Newton-John to pull it off. If nothing
else, the attitudes of society have changed.
Still, there is a lot of work yet to be done.
Major problems' still exist in such areas as
equal pay for equal work, equal opportunity
to get into that line of work, pregnancy ben
efits, credit ratings, and pay toilets-, to name
but a few. If these problems are to be solved,
women must change, men must change, and

society must meet somewhere in the middle.
Decisive actions must be taken, and one
such decisive action would be the passage of
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).
Perhaps the biggest barrier to the passage
of the ERA has been posed by its opponents
who call themselves feminists, but claim that
the situation has improved to the point
where the ERA is unnecessary. These so
called feminists have been duped. They
forget the old adage, "Do as I say and not as I
do." To them, expressing a belief is as good
as acting on it.

'The ERA would symbolically acknowledge that more
changes are still necessary/

A useful analogy can be drawn from the
results of one of the latest public opinion
polls. In this poll, women were asked what
criteria were most important to them when
choosing a man. Invariably, personality char
acteristics, such as "a sense of humor" and "a
warm cuddly bedside manner," were ranked
above appearance characteristics, such as "a
cute derriere." When asked about their
choice in women, men responded in much
the same way, though they tended to place

appearance characteristics a bit higher up
the scale than the women did. Apparently,
the ideal lover of today is one who will make
you laugh everywhere but in bed.
Does this explain the rash of bad Steve
Martin imitations that seem to threaten the
very fabric of western society and civilization
as we know it? Has "Ex-cuuuuse Mel" be
come the "Twenty-Three Skidool" of our
time merely because John hopes such buf
foonery will catch Mary's eye more than
Phil's tight jeans? Will rabbit ears and
whoopie cushions become the latest sex aids
available through the mails? I think not.

The problem here is that people have not
responded to the pollsters honestly. They
have given the "right" answer; the answer
they feel they must give to avoid accusations
of stereotyped behavior. Consider the bigot
who prefaces his racist remarks with, "I'm no
bigot, why some of my best friends are . . ."
He may be a bigot, but he knows that it's
something society frowns upon, so he
doesn't admit it. In a similar way, the survey
respondents knew that it wasn't socially ac-

ceptable to admit to physical attraction as
the basis for starting a relationship. To do so
is one thing, but to admit to doing so is quite
another.
It seems to me that these people are
paying lip service to the virtues of person
ality, but in reality factors such as pure
chance and the idiosyncracies of physical at
traction are what first bring most couples to
gether. (Some enchanted evening, when
you see a stranger, across a crowded room
...) Personality is important, but it generally
comes into play later in the relationship. That
may not be right, but that is how the game is
played today. In the ideal world, women
could invite men over for drinks (and vice
versa) without fear of public opinion, but
we're not there yet. In the Utopian society, a
woman could be a mechanic or a man could
be a nurse without either one enduring con
descending remarks, but they can't here and
now. We're far from that ideal world, and we
won't get there by pretending that we're al
ready there. Instead, we must honestly ac
knowledge that many problems still exist,
and then try to solve them.
That is why the passage of the ERA is im
portant: it would symbolically acknowledge
that more changes are still necessary. It is un
derstandable that some men oppose the
ERA: since they wish to retain their ac
customed position of superiorly. But how
does one explain the stance of women like
Marabel Morgan, whose "Total Woman"

cure for troubled marriages has made
Frederick's of Hollywood acceptable in sub
urbia, and Phyllis Schlafly, leader of the na
tional "Stop ERA" movement? These tradi
tionalists believe women should be treated
like pampered children living with Peter Pan
in Never-Never land, who never have to
grow up. If Mrs. Schlafly and those of her ilk
wish to live in this role, and their men are
willing to play along, fine, but why should
they be allowed to hold back those women
who are willing to face the responsibilities
and reap the advantages of adulthood?
Let me assure you that I have no desire
whatsoever to share a bathroom with Mrs.
Schlafly, and I think I can safely say that 99
percent of all other red-blooded American
men feel the same way (less your standard
deviants). Nor do I believe that Uncle Sam
wants Mrs. Schlafly, but even if he did, he
could get her with or without ERA. I'm even
willing to hold open doors and pull out
chairs for Mrs. Schlafly, but I'd do that for
anyone; women, men, dogs, stray cats ...
you name it. If she tripped me, I might even
be willing to push the chair back in before
she sat down. However, when it comes to
her opposition to the ERA I am reminded of
one of Phyllis' own ardent beliefs: "a wom
an's place is in the home." Go home Mrs.
Schlafly, and take all of yur frightened fillies
with you.

Marabel Morgan, whose "Total Woman"

cure for troubled marriages has made
Frederick's of Hollywood acceptable in sub
urbia, and Phyllis Schlafly, leader of the na
tional "Stop ERA" movement? These tradi
tionalists believe women should be treated
like pampered children living with Peter Pan
in Never-Never land, who never have to
grow up. If Mrs. Schlafly and those of her ilk
wish to live in this role, and their men are
willing to play along, fine, but why should
they be allowed to hold back those women
who are willing to face the responsibilities
and reap the advantages of adulthood?
Let me assure you that I have no desire
whatsoever to share a bathroom with Mrs.
Schlafly, and I think I can safely say that 99
percent of all other red-blooded American
men feel the same way (less your standard
deviants). Nor do I believe that Uncle Sam
wants Mrs. Schlafly, but even if he did, he
could get her with or without ERA. I'm even
willing to hold open doors and pull out
chairs for Mrs. Schlafly, but I'd do that for
anyone; women, men, dogs, stray cats ...
you name it. If she tripped me, I might even
be willing to push the chair back in before
she sat down. However, when it comes to
her opposition to the ERA I am reminded of
one of Phyllis' own ardent beliefs: "a wom
an's place is in the home." Go home Mrs.
Schlafly, and take all of yur frightened fillies
with you.

As we enter the 80s, it may be "downright
upright" for a woman to ask a man over for a,
drink, but it could be economically imprac
tical. The average woman's salary remains 41
percent lower than that of the average man.
Symbolically, "you've come a long way
baby," but in terms of real progress, you're
still down on your hands and knees. There is
much more to true "liberation" than being '
able to tout feminine protection products in
prime time and smoke cigarettes in public.
Of course, not all of the symbolic gains
should bedismissed lightly. Inthedaysof my
misspent youth, you could go to the family
drive-in and hear virginal Hayley Mills
warble:
"You must walk — Feminine
Talk — Feminine
Smile and be gay — Feminine
Fem-i-nin-i-ty
That's what every girl should know
If she wants to catch a beau."
These days not even Disney can get away with
such tripe. Now it takes a star of the magnitude
of Olivia Newton-John to pull it off. If nothing
else, the attitudes of society have changed.
Still, there is a lot of work yet to be done.
Major problems' still exist in such areas as
equal pay for equal work, equal opportunity
to get into that line of work, pregnancy ben
efits, credit ratings, and pay toilets-, to name
but a few. If these problems are to be solved,
women must change, men must change, and

society must meet somewhere in the middle.
Decisive actions must be taken, and one
such decisive action would be the passage of
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).
Perhaps the biggest barrier to the passage
of the ERA has been posed by its opponents
who call themselves feminists, but claim that
the situation has improved to the point
where the ERA is unnecessary. These so
called feminists have been duped. They
forget the old adage, "Do as I say and not as I
do." To them, expressing a belief is as good
as acting on it.

'The ERA would symbolically acknowledge that more
changes are still necessary/

A useful analogy can be drawn from the
results of one of the latest public opinion
polls. In this poll, women were asked what
criteria were most important to them when
choosing a man. Invariably, personality char
acteristics, such as "a sense of humor" and "a
warm cuddly bedside manner," were ranked
above appearance characteristics, such as "a
cute derriere." When asked about their
choice in women, men responded in much
the same way, though they tended to place

appearance characteristics a bit higher up
the scale than the women did. Apparently,
the ideal lover of today is one who will make
you laugh everywhere but in bed.
Does this explain the rash of bad Steve
Martin imitations that seem to threaten the
very fabric of western society and civilization
as we know it? Has "Ex-cuuuuse Mel" be
come the "Twenty-Three Skidool" of our
time merely because John hopes such buf
foonery will catch Mary's eye more than
Phil's tight jeans? Will rabbit ears and
whoopie cushions become the latest sex aids
available through the mails? I think not.

The problem here is that people have not
responded to the pollsters honestly. They
have given the "right" answer; the answer
they feel they must give to avoid accusations
of stereotyped behavior. Consider the bigot
who prefaces his racist remarks with, "I'm no
bigot, why some of my best friends are . . ."
He may be a bigot, but he knows that it's
something society frowns upon, so he
doesn't admit it. In a similar way, the survey
respondents knew that it wasn't socially ac-

ceptable to admit to physical attraction as
the basis for starting a relationship. To do so
is one thing, but to admit to doing so is quite
another.
It seems to me that these people are
paying lip service to the virtues of person
ality, but in reality factors such as pure
chance and the idiosyncracies of physical at
traction are what first bring most couples to
gether. (Some enchanted evening, when
you see a stranger, across a crowded room
...) Personality is important, but it generally
comes into play later in the relationship. That
may not be right, but that is how the game is
played today. In the ideal world, women
could invite men over for drinks (and vice
versa) without fear of public opinion, but
we're not there yet. In the Utopian society, a
woman could be a mechanic or a man could
be a nurse without either one enduring con
descending remarks, but they can't here and
now. We're far from that ideal world, and we
won't get there by pretending that we're al
ready there. Instead, we must honestly ac
knowledge that many problems still exist,
and then try to solve them.
That is why the passage of the ERA is im
portant: it would symbolically acknowledge
that more changes are still necessary. It is un
derstandable that some men oppose the
ERA: since they wish to retain their ac
customed position of superiorly. But how

something society frowns upon, so he
doesn't admit it. In a similar way, the survey
respondents knew that it wasn't socially ac-

ceptable to admit to physical attraction as
the basis for starting a relationship. To do so
is one thing, but to admit to doing so is quite
another.
It seems to me that these people are
paying lip service to the virtues of person
ality, but in reality factors such as pure
chance and the idiosyncracies of physical at
traction are what first bring most couples to
gether. (Some enchanted evening, when
you see a stranger, across a crowded room
...) Personality is important, but it generally
comes into play later in the relationship. That
may not be right, but that is how the game is
played today. In the ideal world, women
could invite men over for drinks (and vice
versa) without fear of public opinion, but
we're not there yet. In the Utopian society, a
woman could be a mechanic or a man could
be a nurse without either one enduring con
descending remarks, but they can't here and
now. We're far from that ideal world, and we
won't get there by pretending that we're al
ready there. Instead, we must honestly ac
knowledge that many problems still exist,
and then try to solve them.
That is why the passage of the ERA is im
portant: it would symbolically acknowledge
that more changes are still necessary. It is un
derstandable that some men oppose the
ERA: since they wish to retain their ac
customed position of superiorly. But how
does one explain the stance of women like
Marabel Morgan, whose "Total Woman"

cure for troubled marriages has made
Frederick's of Hollywood acceptable in sub
urbia, and Phyllis Schlafly, leader of the na
tional "Stop ERA" movement? These tradi
tionalists believe women should be treated
like pampered children living with Peter Pan
in Never-Never land, who never have to
grow up. If Mrs. Schlafly and those of her ilk
wish to live in this role, and their men are
willing to play along, fine, but why should
they be allowed to hold back those women
who are willing to face the responsibilities
and reap the advantages of adulthood?
Let me assure you that I have no desire
whatsoever to share a bathroom with Mrs.
Schlafly, and I think I can safely say that 99
percent of all other red-blooded American
men feel the same way (less your standard
deviants). Nor do I believe that Uncle Sam
wants Mrs. Schlafly, but even if he did, he
could get her with or without ERA. I'm even
willing to hold open doors and pull out
chairs for Mrs. Schlafly, but I'd do that for
anyone; women, men, dogs, stray cats ...
you name it. If she tripped me, I might even
be willing to push the chair back in before
she sat down. However, when it comes to
her opposition to the ERA I am reminded of
one of Phyllis' own ardent beliefs: "a wom
an's place is in the home." Go home Mrs.
Schlafly, and take all of yur frightened fillies
with you.
