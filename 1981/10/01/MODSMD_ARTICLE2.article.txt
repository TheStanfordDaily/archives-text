# Electronic alarm secures Bookstore
## 
### Adam Goodman 
All Stanford Bookstore customers
are now "electronically frisked"
when they exit, as the store continues
to crackdown on shoplifting.
Security alarm devices were in
stalled at the store's front doors this
summer to prevent shoplifters from
stealing merchandise. If a shoplifter
tries to remove merchandise which
has not been desensitized by a clerk
at the register, the alarms will sound.
According to Eldon Speed, the
Bookstore's general manager, the
system was installed because the
store loses approximately $200,000
worth of retail goods, mostly books
and clothing, to shoplifters each
year.
"It's an unfortunate necessity to
protect most of the students who
shop here," he said. Speed estimated
the system could conceivably pay for
itself in a period of two months.
The beefing up of security is only
one of many changes implemented
this year in order to curb financial
losses at the Bookstore. One of the
other major changes is the place
ment of a 50-cent "reshelving fee"
on each returned textbook. The new
policy is designed to decrease the
number of students who buy books
for a course when they are unsure if
they will take the class, said textbook
manager Jim Arnold.
"We are asking people not to 'pan
ic-buy' because we do order enough
books for a class," Arnold said. "We
are trying to be as efficient as pos
sible."
More than 8000 books were re
turned during one two-week buy

back period last year, said Speed.
According to Bookstore managers,
many students purchase textbooks
for courses they are thinking about
taking, creating an "artificial short
age" which may deny books to stu
dents who are definitely taking the
class. Often, by the time the students
return the books, the Bookstore has
already ordered another shipment to
appease the shortage and is then ov
erstocked.
"Hopefully the charge will keep
books in stock for those actually en
rolled in a class and simultaneously
cut down costly returns," said
Arnold. "The combined costs of han
dling books twice and ordering
books not really needed must be
borne by those causing the prob
lem."
Also, students returning Bookstore
items must now remember to save
their receipts. The Bookstore will no
longer give "merchandise only"
vouchers to customers who lose their
receipts.
Another reason to save receipts is
the Bookstore rebate on all text
books purchased during the 1981-82
school year. Speed said last year 7500
rebates, averaging $40 each, were
given to students who turned in their
receipts.
Last year's rebate amounted to 14
percent of the value of all books
purchased. This year's percentage is
yet to be determined. Due to bank
surcharges, students can no longer
receive rebates on books purchased
