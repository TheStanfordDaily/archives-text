## Reagan credibility beginning to wane 
### 
Washington — The fiscal year is
one of those bits of jargon that
thrives in its own natural habitat, the
corporate report or the agency
budget, but is never quite at home in
a living-room discussion or barroom
bull-session.
But in Washington this week, the
talk is that the fiscal year starting to
day, fiscal 1982, will be a year like no
other. That, of course, is because the
first round of President Ronald Rea
gan's budget and tax cuts becomes
effective today, Oct. I, and the ef
fects, both good and ill, can then be
gin to be measured.
As a journalist, I am in a weak posi
tion to tramp on anyone's en
thusiasm for something new. Novel
ty, real or simulated, is the lifeblood
of our business. But what strikes me
as we all prepare toenter this new fis
cal year and maybe this new efa is the
enduring importance of one of the
oldest and most basic political rules
of them all.
That rule is: Keep your commit
ments.
Jimmy Carter fell victim to dis
regarding it, as much as he fell victim
to inflation, the OPEC oil squeeze
and the messed-up Iranian hostage
situation.
The rap on Carter, from politicians

who knew him before he came to
Washington, was that his handshake
was sometimes something less than
an ironclad guarantee. He started
getting in trouble in thiscapital when
politicians of his own Democratic
Party learned, to their chagrin, that
he was capable of changing his mind
about tax rebates, water projects and
national health programs, sometimes
without bothering to inform them.
By the time he was reneging on
things like the neutron bomb
deployment and the lowa debate
challenge, the game was up for him.
Reagan and his administration —
composed of more experienced and
tested politicians — had every reason
to profit from Carter's unhappy ex
ample. But, increasingly, they too
seem to be falling into the same trap,
with the same results. And that is
more worrisome for the long run
than the financial quavers that usher
in the new fiscal year.
The elderly in this country, to take
one example, understood Reagan to
say pretty plainly in his campaign that
whatever the financial problems in
the Social Security system, he was not
going to tamper with the commit
ments that had been made or the
benefits that had been promised.
They believed that because he had
said in October 1980 that the "over
riding goal" of any Social Security re
form must be that "the benefits of

those now receiving — or looking
forward to receiving — Social Secur
ity must be protected."
But twice he has tested that faith by
amending the understanding. Twice
he'has proposed delays or reductions
in prospective benefits. Twice he has
stirred a hornet's nest of criticism.
And twice he has backed off.
More broadly, the President said
that there would be certain social
"safety-net" programs for the "truly
needy" that would be "exempt from
cuts." But now his budget director,
David Stockman, says "we can never
promise" such exemption for any
program.
Stockman also explained last
weekend that the commitments he
and others, speaking for the Presi
dent, made to Republicans in Con
gress in order to secure their votes
for last summer's keystone budget
and tax bills were not really commit
ments either.
At a luncheon with reporters, he
said, "People develop expectations
.. . (but) we never made any commit
ments." Well, that just won't wash
with the Republicans who were in
volved, and who understood that as
surances had been given about the
funding of dozens of programs vital
to their districts.
What happens when one politician
begins to doubt another's word is a

swift and sickening destruction of the
mutual commitments that are essen
tial to success. Without that mutual
trust, government itself becomes im
possible and the course of policy un
predictable.
People inside an administration
get confusing signals from the top
and are no longer certain what is the
real policy line. The country saw that
last week in the contradictory
statements from Cabinet officers and
White House aides on school lunch
programs and the future of revenue
sharing.
Then the congressmen who have
been willing to put their necks on the
line for the President retreat to their
customary caution, and the chief ex
ecutive finds himself without the al
lies he needs to win the battles on
Capitol Hill. Something very like that
is happening to Reagan on the new
round of budget cuts.
It is not too late to halt the damage.
But it is none too early to focus on the
risks of reviving the credibility prob
lem that ultimately crippled Jimmy
Carter. This threat is a lot more seri
ous to the Reagan administration's
future than another month of high
interest rates.
