# Cartoonist Gould traces the making of a hero— Dick Tracy

The criminal's lifeless body lies crumpled as
the grim-faced detective stashes his smoking
roscoe and examines the hole just drilled in the
crown of his fedora,
It is, of course, the conclusion of yet another
episode of "Dick Tracy," the comic strip about
the steely-eyed, hawk-nosed plainclothes cop
which first made its appearance 50 years ago
Sunday.
In mid-1931, artist Chester Gould, always on
the lookout for an angle to sell his cartoons,
came up with an idea for a new type of comic
strip. Unlike the popular funnies of the day, his
would be a realistic look at American violence.
The hero: a two-fisted, square-jawed, no
nonsense flatfoot named Dick Tracy. The vil
lains: a slimy collection of twisted, often
grotesque do-badders with names like Flattop,
Pruneface and Haf-and-Haf. The plot: villain
commits evil deeds, almost wins, Tracy triumphs
at the last minute.
Looking at newspaper front pages from 1931,
it is not hard to see where Gould got the idea for
a cop strip or the raw material for his stories. As
he was preparing the first Tracy tale, real-life
gangster Al "Scarface" Capone had surrendered
to federal authorities and was getting ready to go
on trial. The very day the strip debuted a man de
scribed as a "soft-voiced Bronx gang leader" was
identified as the gunman in a case known as the
Harlem Baby Massacre.
The comic strip caught on almost immediate
ly*
Gould soon latched on to a gimmick that be
came his trademark: each villain had a grisly trait
or physical defect that made him (or her)
unique. They stuttered, mumbled, and shook.
They had beetle brows, bug eyes, oversize
noses, and worse.
And most of them were eliminated in horrible
ways. They died by self-impalement, gassing,
freezing, scalding, being buried alive. They
crashed — in cars, planes, trains. And, of course,

they were felled by deadeye Dick's trusty can
non.
It made fans by the millions. And it also drew
criticism from some people who thought things
were violent enough in America without blood
flowing down the funny pages too.
"I got flak all the time," Gould said, "but I also
had a top readership. I never had any such thing
as sex and brutality. For every letter I got saying I
was too violent, I got 10 or 15 telling me they en
joyed the strip."
And Gould's uncompromising law-and-order
stance, along with his faithful reportage of po
lice procedure, drew cheers from the country's
lawmen. Beingaccurate was a fixation forGould.
"I didn't make any of the technical things up,"
Gould said. "I conferred with the FBI and our
Chicago police on technical matters. You know,
you can fake some things but you can't fake pro
cedure.
"Taking fingerprints, for example. I would
have to know where the arrested man would
stand, where the ink pad would be, everything.
You have to get it right."
Some of the mechanical devices used by Tracy
and his police cohorts Sam Catchen and Pat Pat
ton made their way from the strip to real life. The
most famous was the two-way wrist radio — in
evitably labeled for the benefit of the neophyte
reader — which has since become a two-way
wrist TV]
Tracy also made the leap from the newspaper
to other media. In 1937, a movie serial starred
Ralph Byrd as the intrepid detective.
Generally, Gould approved. "The kids liked
them, and so did l[" said Gould. "You know,
they were for the Saturday afternoon crowd
when such movies were big."
Plans are underway now for yet another Tracy
movie, set to begin filming next year. Clint East
wood, who's even more dauntless than Tracy, is
scheduled for the starring role; director John
Landis (Animal House, American Werewolf in
London) is doing the screenplay.
