## De Palma leaves genre behind 
### Steve Vineberg 
The most heinous crime in Hollywood is
to make a movie that defies everyone's ex
pectations; the punishment is that you are
certain to be misunderstood. Brian De
Palma must be, aside from Sam Peckinpah,
the most unpopular first-rate director
America has ever produced: taxed with
misogyny in some quarters, plagiarism in
others, he has acquired such a bad boy's
rep that when you try to tell a friend to see
one of his pictures, the response is likely to
be incredulous amusement or irritation —
just as when you mention that you loved
Norman Mailer's last novel. Many critics
and filmgoers now relegate De Palma's
movies to a trash barrel category — nasty,
sleazy, manipulative horror movies (a pe
culiar description for The Phantom of the
Paradise, Carrie, The Fury and Dressed to
Kill) and even seem to derive security from
the thought that he doesn't attempt any
thing of greater value, because then they
might have to rethink his work. So when
he does slip the bonds of his genre and
makes a picture of real importance, many
people see the same old movie they have
come to believe he's been making all
along.
The typical reaction to Blow-Out has
been, "It's not as exciting as Dressed to
Kill," and that might be acceptable
criticism if Blow-Out were just a suspense
thriller dressed up in a political suit, like
The Paralax View or The Formula. But it's a
passionate essay on non-involvement and
the difficulty of seeking the truth in a soci
ety that has stopped believing in its im
portance — a Third Man for the Reagan
era.
A presidential candidate named
Mcßyan drowns when one of his tires de
flates and his car veers into a lake; Jack
Terry (John Travolta), a sound man rec
ording for his latest picture, witnesses the
accident amd dives into the water, but only
manages to rescue the young woman ac
companying the politician, Sally (Nancy Al
len). One of Mcßyan's team begs Jack to
keep quiet about Sally because the news
that he died "with his hand up some girl's
skirt" would upset his family unneces
sarily, and Jack agrees to be silent, though
he must struggle against his gut feeling that
if this fact happens to be the truth, then it
shouldn't be buried just because of its ugli
ness. However, Jack has captured the acci
dent on tape, and in playing it back he be
comes convinced that a gunshot preceded
the blow-out; when a second witness,
Manny Karp (Dennis Franz), turns up ped
dling a set of photographs of the event to
the media and swears that he didn't see
anyone else on the scene but Mcßyan,
Jack rebels against what he believes to be a
massive cover-up, and tries to persuade
the police that Mcßyan was assassinated.
As the movie progresses, we become in
creasingly conscious that Jack's demand
for the truth is a lone voice in the wil
derness. Mcßyan's people pleaded on
behalf of a distraught wife who could be
spared embarrassment, and asked Jack the
crucial question: "What difference does it
make to you, anyway?" Sally, who never
watches the news because it's too depress

ing, hesitates to involve herself in Jack's
quest; he only succeeds in enlisting her aid
by urging her that her life, too, may be in
peril. Manny, who turns out to be a black
mailer who hired Sally's services to trap
Mcßyan for a client, advises her to take her
share of the money and forget about the
whole affair. The police detective calls Jack
a "conspiracy freak." Jack is fighting for
the publication of the truth among people
who have learned to prefer the comfort of
lies, even though the gradual, unceasing
erasing of the truth, which they tacitly con
done, suggests a country well on its way to
an Orwellian future.
Blow-Out is a deeply political movie —
and not because of its reference to Chap
paquiddick or the portrayal of the
murderer (John Lithgow) as a Gordon Lid
dy figure. The Conversation (which Blow-
Out is widely assumed to be in imitation
of) put the mood of Watergate on film, but
it was about a man's private obsession, not
the political implications of his profession,
wire-tapping. Blow-Out reaches far

beyond The Conversation. De Palma
doesn't adopt the easy cynical pose of
movies like The China Syndrome: that the
system is rotten from the top down, and so
we can't battle against it. In fact, in Blow-
Out the politicians who engineered
Mcßyan's defeat have lost control of the
machine — they never intended his death
— and one psychotic has usurped the
wheel. De Palma is concerned not with the
supposed controllers, but with a society
that allows itself to be controlled. In 1984,
Winston theorizes that if there is a way to
turn the country around, it must lie with
the "proles"; for De Palma, we are all the
"proles", and, through Jack, he expresses
alarm and dismay that we don't care which
direction we're facing. How can a movie
that climaxes with the one character de
termined to obtain the truth disrupting a
parade for a fictitious Philadelphia holiday
called Liberty Day, in which citizens per
form pageants recalling great moments
from the American Revolution — a movie
that is color conceived in red, white and
blue — not be considered political?
Since Blow-Out is practically the only
film I saw all summer that is about anything
but other movies, I find it distressing that
De Palma is being charged, once again,
with stealing from other directors — espe
cially when his accusers are mostly the
same critics who admired Raiders of the

Lost Ark. A picture like Raiders or Boc/y
Heat (both were written by Lawrence
Kasdan) belongs to the reproductive
school of filmmaking; it doesn't parody its
sources, or build on them, or alter their
system of values — it's safe, pristine. De
Palma's movies irk some people because
they evoke other films but in some way are
different from them. Dressed to Kill brings
Psycho to mind, of course, but it's not Psy
cho: it plays a more daring (and wittier)
variation on Hitchcock; similarly, Robert
Altman's The Long Goodbye, which lifted
Philip Marlowe out of the L A. of the for
ties and dropped him in the L. A. of the sev
enties, wasn't The Big Sleep and so made
people uncomfortable. Isn't it ironic that
filmmakers who use earlier films as a start
ing off point are usually the ones who pro
voke cries of plagiarism? (No such practice
exists in literature or drama; it would he
considered ridiculous to charge Anouilh
with stealing Antigone from Sophocles.)
And doesn't it stretch one's credibility to
suggest, as more than one reviewer has,
that a director of De Palma's sophisti
cation, if he were really bent on stealing
ideas from Blow-Up and The Conversa
tion, would film a scene that pays direct
homage to the latter and choose a title that
puns on the former? (Hardcore film buffs
may also recognize 3 tribute to the too-lit
tle-known Charles laughton-James Agee
Night of the Hunter.)
Perhaps the confusion incurred by defy
ing expectations also explains the skep
ticism with which John Travolta's stunning
performance in this film has been re
ceived. For the first time, Travolta plays an
adult — and an interesting, bright and
committed one — and yet most of the
moviegoers I've spoken with jeeringly de
scribe his work in Blow-Out as another Sat
urday Night Fever, though he has changed
everything from his walk and his vocal
mannerisms to the quality of the distress
he feels and his manner of communicating
it. (Maybe Saturday Night Fever should be
re-released to remind us of how good he
was in it.) Nancy Allen, John Lithgow and
Dennis Franz all give terrific performances
in Blow-Out, but Travolta illuminates the
other side of De Palma's coin: this movie is
not only a societal tragedy, but a personal
one as well. Jack is haunted by an incident
in his past: while working for an equivalent
to the Knapp Commission, he wired a cop
who was eliciting incriminating statements
from a pair of gangsters, but the cop's ner
vousness caused him to sweat, the wire
short-circuited and began to burn him,
and he gave himself away. When Jack
places Sally in comparable danger, he real
ly repeats his first mistake: he trusts blindly
in the power of technology. We recognize
that if he loses Sally, too, he will be de
stroyed because he will never forgive
himself. Jack is a tragic, grown-up version
of the whiz kid Keith Gordon played in
Dressed to Kill — who was a representa
tion of that other whiz kid, Brian De Palma.
In this ineffably rich movie, Jack's downfall
is as much due to his own flaws as to the
force — or non-force — of the society he
lives in — and both tumble to the ground
with a single bravura stroke in the closing
scene. Surely Sophocles would have ap
plauded.
