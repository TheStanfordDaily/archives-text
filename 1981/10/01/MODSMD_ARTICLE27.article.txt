That there are parallels
between individual styles of
drawing and writing has
long been recognized. Cur
rently on view at the Univer
sity Museum of Art is "The
Personality of the Artist in
Handwriting and Drawing,"
an exhibition which com
pares specimens of the writ
ing of famous artists with ex
amples of their drawing or
printmaking.
The exhibit, drawn from
the Museum's collection, il
lustrates such parallels using
rarely seen letters and other

documents from the hands
of, among others, David,
Romney, Ingres, Delacroix,
Rousseau, Courbet, Monet,
Pissarro, Rodin, Kokoschka,
and Cocteau.
While handwriting is
always influenced by the
conventions of period, na
tion, and social class, it is
always to a greater or lesser
degree individual â€” a
graphic expression of per
sonality. The same is true of
drawing, regardless of peri
od style.
The Museum has, over

the years, collected letters
of artists, primarily for their
documentary or historical
interest. The present exhibi
tion makes a different use of
them, by stressing their
stylistic and expressive char
acter, and treating them as
works of graphic art, though
of an unconscious kind.
The University Museum
of Art is open Tuesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Admission is free. Do
cent tours are given
Thursdays at 12:15 p.m. and
Sunday at 2 p.m.
