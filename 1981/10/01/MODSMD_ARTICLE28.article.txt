# Used records: you get what you pay for
## 
### Gina Arnold 
With record prices soaring
these days, reccffd collectors
are fast becoming an obsolete
breed. Rather than giving up
popular music altogether,
more and more people are
turning to used record stores as
a viable alternative to selling
their stereos or going broke.
Along with a plethora of tap
ing clubs, used record dealing
— buying and selling records
from stores which deal ex
clusively with used trade — is a
great way to break even on
your record collecting habit.
There are many reasons for
shopping used besides mere
profiteering. For one thing,
shopping in used stores is defi
nitely more pleasant than
shopping in Tower Records.
Chain stores like Tower 3re
generally roomy, clean, and
plastered with posters of ugly
faces like those of Rex Smith
and Christopher Cross. They
are also full of unattractive
teenage customers with filthy
hair, Grateful Dead t-shirts,
and, more often than not,
Black Sabbath belt buckles.
Last but not least, chain
store 1 , play rotten music, since
they ii variably have play lists.
Used stores, on the other
hand, are full of amiable peo

pie whose interests are often
similar to yours, the potential
customer. They are generally
small, cramped, and not always
very nicely vacuumed, but they
have a pleasant atmosphere
conducive to browsing. They
also play better music, and usu
ally have exciting decor utili
zing posters of groups which
one might conceivably like.
If you are considering ven
turing forth into used records
land, either to buy or sell used
records, there are several fac
tors one must keep in mind.
First, there is the question of
quality. Record quality varies,

but in general, you get what
you pay for.
Basically, quality depends on
price. At most stores, especially
the larger ones, like Rasputins
in Berkeley, you can choose
any of six copies of a record, for
prices ranging from 99 cents to
four or five dollars, depending
on the surface quality and age
of the copy. No store we spoke
to, however, tests any of its
purchases for skips or
scratches, relying solely on
sight tests, so prepare yourself
for some nasty shocks no mat
ter how nice your "new" rec
ord looks.

The second factor to con
sider when buying or selling
used records is selection. Used
record stores look for current
hit records in good condition.
All the stores we spoke to offer
between two and three dollars
for new releases, and 25 per
cent more in trade. As for
buying used, well, most stores
already have almost as good a
selection as the chain stores.
They are often more com
prehensive, since chain stores
must order directly from dis
tributors and must take a loss
on any album they don't sell.
If you are looking for an ob

scure or out-of-print album, a
used store is a better bet. Used
stores generally have a full
catalogue of records by prolific
groups like the Rolling Stones,
whereas Tower might have the
last three hits plus Let It Bleed.
For more current albums by
popular artists like Bruce
Springsteen, you may have to
wait a few days until it reaches
the bins.
Needless to say, used record
stores pay the most for records
by big name groups. Every
store we visited insisted they
pay the highest prices, but, by
