# Used records: you get what you pay for
## 
### Gina Arnold 
With record prices soaring
these days, reccffd collectors
are fast becoming an obsolete
breed. Rather than giving up
popular music altogether,
more and more people are
turning to used record stores as
a viable alternative to selling
their stereos or going broke.
Along with a plethora of tap
ing clubs, used record dealing
— buying and selling records
from stores which deal ex
clusively with used trade — is a
great way to break even on
your record collecting habit.
There are many reasons for
shopping used besides mere
profiteering. For one thing,
shopping in used stores is defi
nitely more pleasant than
shopping in Tower Records.
Chain stores like Tower 3re
generally roomy, clean, and
plastered with posters of ugly
faces like those of Rex Smith
and Christopher Cross. They
are also full of unattractive
teenage customers with filthy
hair, Grateful Dead t-shirts,
and, more often than not,
Black Sabbath belt buckles.
Last but not least, chain
store 1 , play rotten music, since
they ii variably have play lists.
Used stores, on the other
hand, are full of amiable peo

pie whose interests are often
similar to yours, the potential
customer. They are generally
small, cramped, and not always
very nicely vacuumed, but they
have a pleasant atmosphere
conducive to browsing. They
also play better music, and usu
ally have exciting decor utili
zing posters of groups which
one might conceivably like.
If you are considering ven
turing forth into used records
land, either to buy or sell used
records, there are several fac
tors one must keep in mind.
First, there is the question of
quality. Record quality varies,

but in general, you get what
you pay for.
Basically, quality depends on
price. At most stores, especially
the larger ones, like Rasputins
in Berkeley, you can choose
any of six copies of a record, for
prices ranging from 99 cents to
four or five dollars, depending
on the surface quality and age
of the copy. No store we spoke
to, however, tests any of its
purchases for skips or
scratches, relying solely on
sight tests, so prepare yourself
for some nasty shocks no mat
ter how nice your "new" rec
ord looks.

The second factor to con
sider when buying or selling
used records is selection. Used
record stores look for current
hit records in good condition.
All the stores we spoke to offer
between two and three dollars
for new releases, and 25 per
cent more in trade. As for
buying used, well, most stores
already have almost as good a
selection as the chain stores.
They are often more com
prehensive, since chain stores
must order directly from dis
tributors and must take a loss
on any album they don't sell.
If you are looking for an ob

scure or out-of-print album, a
used store is a better bet. Used
stores generally have a full
catalogue of records by prolific
groups like the Rolling Stones,
whereas Tower might have the
last three hits plus Let It Bleed.
For more current albums by
popular artists like Bruce
Springsteen, you may have to
wait a few days until it reaches
the bins.
Needless to say, used record
stores pay the most for records
by big name groups. Every
store we visited insisted they
pay the highest prices, but, by

Chimaera
Records
inside
and
out


pricing a group of records
ranging from new/good (Elvis
Costello) to old/crummy
(Country Joe and the Fish), we
found only minor differences
in prices at each store.
Every store stipulated that
they paid more in trade than
cash, and that they were willing
to bargain. Some stores told us
the price they planned to sell
our record for — seldom less
than a 100 percent mark-up.
Every store requested albums
by the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and
Bruce Springsteen. A hint to
the wise — you get a lot more
money if you sell a group of
records than if you sell one at a
time.
Following is a store-by-store

rundown of some of the used
record stores in the Bay Area.
This is not a comprehensive list
by any means, but it will do in a
pinch.
Chimaera Records, corner of
Lytton and Kipling, Palo Alto,
327-1122. Chimaera records is
the most nouveau rock place in
Palo Alto — or at least it thinks
it is, and has been for years. Re
cently updated, Chimaera has
become less the hippie haunt
its name implies and much
more on top of the music scene
than it was in years past.
Chimaera doesn't have the
best selection of either new or
used records. The new arrivals
section is your best bet for any
decent listening, but be fore
warned that Chimaera boasts

numerous locals who check
out the bins daily and snatch up
all that is of interest before the
records have time to settle.
Besides having a limited selec
tion, Chimaera, having had the
corner on the market for so
long, is also overpriced and up
pity. Four dollars for a new
copy of a so-so album isn't such
a deal elsewhere.
The salespeople at Chirrtaera
have a disconcerting manner
of sneering both at your
purchases and your person, as
well as being rude about rec
ords you bring in to sell.
Still, Chimaera has one great
advantage. It gets a fair amount
of collectors' records, the so
called fanclub albums. If you
can stand the humiliation that

the snooty employees heap
upon your meager purchases,
Chimaera is worth a look.
Recycled Records, 550 Cow
per St., Palo Alto, 321-3806 (for
merly Collectors' Bookhaven).
Recycled Records in Palo Alto,
behind the New Varsity on
Cowper Street, is as well
stocked as its sister stores in San
Francisco and has the same in
telligent and friendly am
biance. It is just one summer
old, and its newness con
tributes to its excellent selec
tion of records and singles.
They have the most com
prehensive selection of new
wave singles in Palo Alto,
among other things.
The first store in downtown
Palo Alto to challenge

Chimaera's long-time hold on
the used record business, Re
cycled has a chance of compet
ing because of its solid San
Francisco reputation and be
cause it is only two blocks from
its rival — within figurative spit
ting distance. A good thing to
keep in mind when shopping
for used records — if you can't
find it at Chimaera, try Re
cycled. You might be surprised
by the difference.
Recycled Records, 1415
Grant Ave., San Francisco,
982-5442. Recycled Records on
upper Grant Avenue was one
of the first successful used rec
ord stores in the area, and
helped, by its professional and
complete record bins, to re
move the stigma from used

stores in general.
Johnny, at the Grant Avenue
store, informed us that Re
cycled often undersells new
wave and import singles — one
way to help support the people
who help support them. This
kind of honest policy, which
does not seek to maximize
profit at the expense of the cus
tomer, is the kind of thing that
has made record barter such a
burgeoning business: low-key,
enjoyable, and popular. Re
cycled is in a nice area — be
tween the Cafe Trieste and
Washington Square Park in
North Beach, across from the
Savoy Tivoli. Recycled has a leg
up on the competition when it
comes to having used
punk/new wave singles.

The biggest and most famous
of these stores is Rasputins, at
2333 Telegraph Ave., 848-9004.
Rasputins is the size of a large
warehouse, and there is anoth
er store down the street just for
soul and jazz records. At the
rock store there is a vast collec
tion of bargain bins, row upon
row, in fact, of dollar records.
They also sell used and new
tapes, t-shirts, buttons, maga
zines, singles, and all trade got
off selling used albums can be
used on anything in the store.
Every other store in the Bay
Area that we spoke to pointed
an accusatory finger at
Rasputins, calling them un
scrupulous, impersonal, and
dishonest, but we suspect that
they are just jealous.
