China offers Taiwan olive branch
Beijing — China offered Taiwan reunification terms
today that for the first time mention letting Taiwanese
leaders join in running the Communist government
while keeping control of their island nation's local af
fairs.
But James Soons, director general of the Government
Information Office on laiwan and the principal Na
tionalist spokesman, dismissed the new Communist pro
posal as "essentially a continuation of Beijing's propa
ganda" and said it contained nothing new.
Chinese Communist officials were not dismayed by
the Nationalists' immediate rejection of the new pro
posal, calling that predictable. They expressed con
fidence yesterday tnat it would spark discussion on
Taiwan of the ways the country might be reunified and
that this in turn would increase pressure on the govern
ment there to be more flexible.
Beijing implied there would be further concessions to
the Taiwanese, and it proposed an "exhaustive exchange
of views" as a preliminary to the actual negotiations so
that the Nationalist side could assure itself of the Com
munists' intentions before making any commitments.
Rong Yiren, a former Shanghai industrialist who now is
a top investment official ana banker here, also pointed
out that Taiwan businessmen wouid be invited to invest
on the mainland with guarantees that their property
would not be seized and that their profits could be taken
out.
While a high-ranking Chinese army officer told re
porters that tne purpose of Beijing's overture was to re
duce fears of the mainland among people on Taiwan,
Western diplomats saw it as aimed at the United States.
The diplomats, who asked not to be named, said one
aim appeared to be to make it harder for President
Ronald Reagan to justify arms sales to Taiwan, and to pre
pare the Chinese public for worsened US-China rela
tions if the sales go through.
Baker says AWACS deal delayed
Washington — Senate Republican Leader Howard
Baker told President Ronald Reagan yesterday he does
not have the votes to clear the $8.5 billion arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig hur
ried home from the United Nations to try to save the
deal. , , . . ...
Baker told reporters he thinks the president still can
win the congressional test, but opponents now have the
upper hand. . , AI ., A( ~ c
''I think Ronald Reagan's goine to get the AWACS
through," Baker said. But for now, Fie told reporters "We
don't nave the votes."
A 30-day clock for congressional veto of the sale was to
start running later in the day with the administration s
formal submission of the sale to Congress.
If the House and Senate have not rejected the $8.5
billion sale by Oct. 30, the deal goes through.
It includes five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes plus Sidewinder missiles and longrang fuel
tanks for 62 Saudi F-15 jet fighters.
The administration says the sale is vital for defending
the Saudi oil supply but opponents call it a threat to Israel
and a compromise of supersecret equipment.
Earlier, Haig sent Ambassador Richard Murphy to
Saudi Arabia with a new compromise proposal for joint
US-Saudi manning of the planes in an effort to mollify
Congress.
High official doubts SALT outcome
Washington — Despite the recent US-Soviet agree
ment to begin talks Nov. 30 on limiting tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe, the two sides are fundamentally at
odds on almost every aspect of the negotiations, a senior
US official said yesterday.
Speaking to reporters before Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig left nis United Nations heaciquartetsjor a
White House meeting on AWACS[ the official, who
spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the
{disagreements cover basic definitions, scope and range
of the weapons to be covered in talks.
These fundamental differences, which emerged dur

ing the talks between Haig and Soviet foreign minister
Andrei Gromyko in New York, limit the likelinood of re
ducing East-West tensions anytime soon.
Regarding the arms talks, it was disclosed that the
United States will insist that all tactical nuclear weapons
on the Eurasian continent be discussed "in a global con
text." This will include the 75 Soviet SS-20 missiles
deployed in the eastern Soviet Union and targeted on
China, rather than on Western Europe.
The Soviets, however, want to limit the talks to the Eu
ropean region, and to include sea-based missiles
deployed within the Atlantic alliance and the "forward
based systems" — US medium-range fighter bombers
capable of delivering nuclear warheads on Warsaw Pact
targets, the senior official said.
The United States intends to refuse to discuss anything
other than land-based tactical nuclear weapons in the
early stages of the negotiations.
It was also disclosed that Gromyko told Haig that the
Soviets want to separate the talks on tactical nuclear
weapons from the larger framework of strategic arms
talks with which they had traditionally been associated.
In addition, the officials speculate that the Soviets
want to block any US move to turn aside a Soviet demand
in the tactical nuclear force talks with a claim that the is
sue should properly be reserved for strategic arms talks.
Emergency funding bill nears OK
Washington — Congress debated past a midnight
deadline yesterday as it struggled to complete an emer
gency spending bill for the federal government that con
fained liberalized tax breaks and virtually automatic pay
raises for members of Congress.
Theoretically, the government ran out of money when
midnight tolled the end of the fiscal year without con
gressional approval of the stopgap bill tofund numerous
federal agencies and departments.
But in practice, disruptions in government services
were certain to be slight, since Congress intended to
swiftly send the bill to President Ronald Reagan.
House members approved the legislation by voice
vote less than 90 minutes before the deadline.
But the Senate debate stretched past midnight despite
efforts by Republican Leader Howard Baker to expedite
passage of the bill.
In a few hectic hours of bargaining, the House and
Senate also approved a plan allowing senators to earn
unlimited income from outside speaking engagements.
But they rejected a proposal for an immediate 4.8 per
cent pay increase for themselves and dumped a Senate
passed provision granting pay raises to several thousand
federal workers' salary has been capped for four years.
The bill is designed to keep money available for feder
al programs through Nov. 20, when experts estimate that
most it not all of the 13 regular appropriations bills will be
approved.
While most of the money in the bill would go to keep
ing federal programs and agencies from shutting down,
the most controversial issues centered on financial bene
fits for members of Congress.
Earlier, the conference committee agreed to spend
$125 million to help operate a Middle East peacekeeping
force in the Sinai Desert, but barred stationingany Amer
ican troops there without prior approval of Congress.
The committee also forced Sen. Mack Mattingly (R-
Ca.) to back down on a proposal to prohibit the Library
of Congress from spending any money to translate cer
tain parts of Playboy magazine into Braille.
Postal rates raised Nov. 1
Washington — The US Postal Board of Governors an
nounced yesterday it had voted to raise the price of first
class postage from 18 cents to 20 cents and post cards
from 12 cents to 13 cents effective Nov. 1.
The new rates — the subject of a bureaucratic battle
for more than a year — should remain in effect at leastfor
two years, depending on inflation, said Robert Hardesty,
chairman of tne board of governors.
The Postal Service is cranking out a "C" series stamp
that will be worth 20 cents and will be available in a few
days, a spokesman said.
Hardesty said the Postal Service lost nearly $126 million

during the first five months under the current rates. The
new rates should add $1 billion annually to Postal Service
revenues and provide a $100 million operating profit for
the 12 months ending next February, Hardesty said. The
independent Postal Rate Commission, which recom
mends rate changes, rejected proposals for a 20-cent
first-class rate three times in favor of the 18-cent rate,
saying the increased postage was unnecessary. This was
the first increase imposed unilaterally by the governors
without approval by the commission.
The last increase before this year was in May 1978,
when first-class postage rose from 13 to 15 cents. It is the
sixth increase since 1971, when mailing a letter cost 6
cents.
Several industries involved in heavy use of the mails
such as greeting card manufacturers are expected to
challenge the decision before a federal appeals court.
Under tne Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, however,
the rates cannot be suspended by an appellate judge un
til the lawsuit challenging the rates hasended, according
to a Postal Service attorney.
During a press conference Wednesday, a reporter
asked why rates were raised by 2 cents -or first class ma'fl,
which households use, but did not change for business
reply mail, which often is used for "junk mail." Post
master William Bolger replied that individual letters cost
more to handle than other kinds of mail.
Although the cost of a first-class stamp will rise to 20
cents, the cost of each additional ounce will remain at 17
cents. There will also be no increase in parcel post and
slight increases in Express Mail.
Iranian leaders killed in crash
Tehran — The top echelons of the Iranian armed
forces suffered a heavy blow yesterday, just three days
after a decisive victory on the Iraqi front, with the deaths
of four leading military figures in a plane crash near
Tehran.
Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Valli Fellahi; Defense
Minister Mussa Namiu; the former defense minister and
adviser to the chief of staff, Col. Javad Fakuri, and the act
ing head of the Revolutionary Guards were killed while
returning from the Khuzestan front, where they had suc
cessfully commanded the liberation of Abaaan from
Iraqi forces over the weekend.
Their Hercules C-130 transport crashed into the Khar
izak shooting range 6 miles from Tehran Air Base as thev
were returning from Ahvaz, just north of Abadan, an of
ficial communique said.
Abadan is a major oil-refining center long held under
Iraqi siege until last weekend.
Fellahi had been armed forces chief of staff for more
than a year and had taken charge of army operations af
ter the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war a year ago.
Senate lifts aid restrictions
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed Presi
dent Ronald Reagan two important foreign policy vic
tories, voting to repeal a 1976 provision prohibiting aid to
any faction in Angola's civil war, and to permit aid to Ar
gentina, banned tor human rights reasons since 1978.
With Republicans saying the administration has no
current plans to supply sucn aid, the Senate repealed the
so-called Clark amendment, passed five years ago in an
effort to prevent US intervention in the southern African
nation. It was named after former Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), who proposed it for fear the government would
otherwise jump in on the side of Angola's anti-Marxist
rebels.
The Clark amendment is one of a number of foreign
policy restrictions that Congress placed on the president
in the years just after the war in Vietnam and that the
Reagan administration now wants removed.
The key vote came on an amendment by Sen. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), which would have kept the Clark
amendment in force until March 31, 1983, or until a
ceasefire is reached in the civil war in neighboring
Namibia, which would substantially reduce tensions in
the region generally.
The Tsongas amendment was beaten 66-29. The Senate
then adopted by voice vote an amendment by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) which would permit aid, but still
not without the prior approval of Congress.
The debate yesterday centered on what kind of "sig
nal" repeal would send, and how it would affect the on

going peace negotiations in Namibia. Tsongas and other
opponents argued it would endanger the negotiations
and signal that the United States no longer supports a
policy of restraint in black Africa.
Supporters of the repeal replied that failure to lift the
aid ban would tie Reagan's hands in dealing with Africa
and be an open invitation for continued Cuban and Sovi
et intervention in the continent.
The Argentina amendment, also adopted by voice
vote, dropped the provision in the committee Dill that
would have linked military sales and aid to a full account
ing by the Argentine government of thousands of "dis
appeared" persons. Aid would still be conditioned on
human rights certifications by the president, however.
Seoul, Calgary to host '88 Olympics
Baden-Baden, West Germany — Seoul, South Korea,
was awarded the 1988 Summer Olympic Games yester
day in a stunning upset over Nagoya, japan. The vote by
the International Olympic Committee was 52 to 27.
Calgary won the 1988 Winter Games in a runoff over a
combined bid by the Swedish cities of Falun and Are. The
vote was 48 to 31, after a first round in which Calgary had
a plurality of 35 votes, the Swedish cities had 25, ancfCor
tina d'Amprezzo, Italy, only 18.
The votes came as a surprise to lOC leaders, some of
whom had said only the night before that Nagoya and
Cortina were the favorites.
Neither Seoul nor Calgary has ever held the games
before. Japan has had them twice. There also appeared
to be some resentment among the lOC over what was
perceived to be overly heavy Japanese pressure at the
end.
In going to Seoul, the lOC places the Olympics on the
Asian mainland for the first time in their history. And
some Third-World representatives here said that they
viewed Seoul as the first Third-World city to host the
games.
In going to Seoul, the capital of an American ally, the
lOC startled its Soviet and other Eastern-Bloc members.
Soviet representatives disappeared only moments after
the announcements. Eastern European members ex
pressed surprise but reserved other comment.
Auto safety standards relaxed
Washington (AP) — The Transportation Department
announced yesterday it will soften its requirement that
passenger car bumpers must withstand a 5 mph collision
without damage to the rest of the car.
The auto industry has been pushing for such a change,
saying the standards add to the cost of a car without com
parable safety benefits.
"We believe that the interests of the public are not
served by retention of a standard which may cost con
sumers more than it saves," said Ray Peck, the adminis
tration's top auto safety official.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced it will hold hearings in a few weeks on a vari
ety of proposed changes ranging from a reduction of the
impact speed standard to eliminating the impact criteria
altogether.
The announcement brought quick criticism from
Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety,
a consumer group founded by auto industry critic Ralph
Nader.
Ditlow called the proposed changes "an affront to
consumers" and disputed Peck's contention that the
changes would economically benefit auto buyers. He
said automakers already are manufacturing the heavier
bumpers and retooling costs would be passed onto the
buyer.
Stock market creeps upward
New York — The stock market was mixed in moderate
trading yesterday but most key measures posted their
third straight gains, albeit small ones.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
nearly 24 points in the previous two sessions, gained an
other 2.09 points to 849.98.
Advances led declines by just under 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
- Big Board volume was 40.70 million shares compared
with 49.80 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in the 50s. Highs from
the upper 60s at the coast to the 80s inland. Northwest
winds to 15 mph in the afternoons.

out.
While a high-ranking Chinese army officer told re
porters that tne purpose of Beijing's overture was to re
duce fears of the mainland among people on Taiwan,
Western diplomats saw it as aimed at the United States.
The diplomats, who asked not to be named, said one
aim appeared to be to make it harder for President
Ronald Reagan to justify arms sales to Taiwan, and to pre
pare the Chinese public for worsened US-China rela
tions if the sales go through.
Baker says AWACS deal delayed
Washington — Senate Republican Leader Howard
Baker told President Ronald Reagan yesterday he does
not have the votes to clear the $8.5 billion arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig hur
ried home from the United Nations to try to save the
deal. , , . . ...
Baker told reporters he thinks the president still can
win the congressional test, but opponents now have the
upper hand. . , AI ., A( ~ c
''I think Ronald Reagan's goine to get the AWACS
through," Baker said. But for now, Fie told reporters "We
don't nave the votes."
A 30-day clock for congressional veto of the sale was to
start running later in the day with the administration s
formal submission of the sale to Congress.
If the House and Senate have not rejected the $8.5
billion sale by Oct. 30, the deal goes through.
It includes five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes plus Sidewinder missiles and longrang fuel
tanks for 62 Saudi F-15 jet fighters.
The administration says the sale is vital for defending
the Saudi oil supply but opponents call it a threat to Israel
and a compromise of supersecret equipment.
Earlier, Haig sent Ambassador Richard Murphy to
Saudi Arabia with a new compromise proposal for joint
US-Saudi manning of the planes in an effort to mollify
Congress.
High official doubts SALT outcome
Washington — Despite the recent US-Soviet agree
ment to begin talks Nov. 30 on limiting tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe, the two sides are fundamentally at
odds on almost every aspect of the negotiations, a senior
US official said yesterday.
Speaking to reporters before Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig left nis United Nations heaciquartetsjor a
White House meeting on AWACS[ the official, who
spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the
{disagreements cover basic definitions, scope and range
of the weapons to be covered in talks.
These fundamental differences, which emerged dur

ing the talks between Haig and Soviet foreign minister
Andrei Gromyko in New York, limit the likelinood of re
ducing East-West tensions anytime soon.
Regarding the arms talks, it was disclosed that the
United States will insist that all tactical nuclear weapons
on the Eurasian continent be discussed "in a global con
text." This will include the 75 Soviet SS-20 missiles
deployed in the eastern Soviet Union and targeted on
China, rather than on Western Europe.
The Soviets, however, want to limit the talks to the Eu
ropean region, and to include sea-based missiles
deployed within the Atlantic alliance and the "forward
based systems" — US medium-range fighter bombers
capable of delivering nuclear warheads on Warsaw Pact
targets, the senior official said.
The United States intends to refuse to discuss anything
other than land-based tactical nuclear weapons in the
early stages of the negotiations.
It was also disclosed that Gromyko told Haig that the
Soviets want to separate the talks on tactical nuclear
weapons from the larger framework of strategic arms
talks with which they had traditionally been associated.
In addition, the officials speculate that the Soviets
want to block any US move to turn aside a Soviet demand
in the tactical nuclear force talks with a claim that the is
sue should properly be reserved for strategic arms talks.
Emergency funding bill nears OK
Washington — Congress debated past a midnight
deadline yesterday as it struggled to complete an emer
gency spending bill for the federal government that con
fained liberalized tax breaks and virtually automatic pay
raises for members of Congress.
Theoretically, the government ran out of money when
midnight tolled the end of the fiscal year without con
gressional approval of the stopgap bill tofund numerous
federal agencies and departments.
But in practice, disruptions in government services
were certain to be slight, since Congress intended to
swiftly send the bill to President Ronald Reagan.
House members approved the legislation by voice
vote less than 90 minutes before the deadline.
But the Senate debate stretched past midnight despite
efforts by Republican Leader Howard Baker to expedite
passage of the bill.
In a few hectic hours of bargaining, the House and
Senate also approved a plan allowing senators to earn
unlimited income from outside speaking engagements.
But they rejected a proposal for an immediate 4.8 per
cent pay increase for themselves and dumped a Senate
passed provision granting pay raises to several thousand
federal workers' salary has been capped for four years.
The bill is designed to keep money available for feder
al programs through Nov. 20, when experts estimate that
most it not all of the 13 regular appropriations bills will be
approved.
While most of the money in the bill would go to keep
ing federal programs and agencies from shutting down,
the most controversial issues centered on financial bene
fits for members of Congress.
Earlier, the conference committee agreed to spend
$125 million to help operate a Middle East peacekeeping
force in the Sinai Desert, but barred stationingany Amer
ican troops there without prior approval of Congress.
The committee also forced Sen. Mack Mattingly (R-
Ca.) to back down on a proposal to prohibit the Library
of Congress from spending any money to translate cer
tain parts of Playboy magazine into Braille.
Postal rates raised Nov. 1
Washington — The US Postal Board of Governors an
nounced yesterday it had voted to raise the price of first
class postage from 18 cents to 20 cents and post cards
from 12 cents to 13 cents effective Nov. 1.
The new rates — the subject of a bureaucratic battle
for more than a year — should remain in effect at leastfor
two years, depending on inflation, said Robert Hardesty,
chairman of tne board of governors.
The Postal Service is cranking out a "C" series stamp
that will be worth 20 cents and will be available in a few
days, a spokesman said.
Hardesty said the Postal Service lost nearly $126 million

during the first five months under the current rates. The
new rates should add $1 billion annually to Postal Service
revenues and provide a $100 million operating profit for
the 12 months ending next February, Hardesty said. The
independent Postal Rate Commission, which recom
mends rate changes, rejected proposals for a 20-cent
first-class rate three times in favor of the 18-cent rate,
saying the increased postage was unnecessary. This was
the first increase imposed unilaterally by the governors
without approval by the commission.
The last increase before this year was in May 1978,
when first-class postage rose from 13 to 15 cents. It is the
sixth increase since 1971, when mailing a letter cost 6
cents.
Several industries involved in heavy use of the mails
such as greeting card manufacturers are expected to
challenge the decision before a federal appeals court.
Under tne Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, however,
the rates cannot be suspended by an appellate judge un
til the lawsuit challenging the rates hasended, according
to a Postal Service attorney.
During a press conference Wednesday, a reporter
asked why rates were raised by 2 cents -or first class ma'fl,
which households use, but did not change for business
reply mail, which often is used for "junk mail." Post
master William Bolger replied that individual letters cost
more to handle than other kinds of mail.
Although the cost of a first-class stamp will rise to 20
cents, the cost of each additional ounce will remain at 17
cents. There will also be no increase in parcel post and
slight increases in Express Mail.
Iranian leaders killed in crash
Tehran — The top echelons of the Iranian armed
forces suffered a heavy blow yesterday, just three days
after a decisive victory on the Iraqi front, with the deaths
of four leading military figures in a plane crash near
Tehran.
Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Valli Fellahi; Defense
Minister Mussa Namiu; the former defense minister and
adviser to the chief of staff, Col. Javad Fakuri, and the act
ing head of the Revolutionary Guards were killed while
returning from the Khuzestan front, where they had suc
cessfully commanded the liberation of Abaaan from
Iraqi forces over the weekend.
Their Hercules C-130 transport crashed into the Khar
izak shooting range 6 miles from Tehran Air Base as thev
were returning from Ahvaz, just north of Abadan, an of
ficial communique said.
Abadan is a major oil-refining center long held under
Iraqi siege until last weekend.
Fellahi had been armed forces chief of staff for more
than a year and had taken charge of army operations af
ter the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war a year ago.
Senate lifts aid restrictions
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed Presi
dent Ronald Reagan two important foreign policy vic
tories, voting to repeal a 1976 provision prohibiting aid to
any faction in Angola's civil war, and to permit aid to Ar
gentina, banned tor human rights reasons since 1978.
With Republicans saying the administration has no
current plans to supply sucn aid, the Senate repealed the
so-called Clark amendment, passed five years ago in an
effort to prevent US intervention in the southern African
nation. It was named after former Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), who proposed it for fear the government would
otherwise jump in on the side of Angola's anti-Marxist
rebels.
The Clark amendment is one of a number of foreign
policy restrictions that Congress placed on the president
in the years just after the war in Vietnam and that the
Reagan administration now wants removed.
The key vote came on an amendment by Sen. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), which would have kept the Clark
amendment in force until March 31, 1983, or until a
ceasefire is reached in the civil war in neighboring
Namibia, which would substantially reduce tensions in
the region generally.
The Tsongas amendment was beaten 66-29. The Senate
then adopted by voice vote an amendment by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) which would permit aid, but still
not without the prior approval of Congress.
The debate yesterday centered on what kind of "sig
nal" repeal would send, and how it would affect the on

going peace negotiations in Namibia. Tsongas and other
opponents argued it would endanger the negotiations
and signal that the United States no longer supports a
policy of restraint in black Africa.
Supporters of the repeal replied that failure to lift the
aid ban would tie Reagan's hands in dealing with Africa
and be an open invitation for continued Cuban and Sovi
et intervention in the continent.
The Argentina amendment, also adopted by voice
vote, dropped the provision in the committee Dill that
would have linked military sales and aid to a full account
ing by the Argentine government of thousands of "dis
appeared" persons. Aid would still be conditioned on
human rights certifications by the president, however.
Seoul, Calgary to host '88 Olympics
Baden-Baden, West Germany — Seoul, South Korea,
was awarded the 1988 Summer Olympic Games yester
day in a stunning upset over Nagoya, japan. The vote by
the International Olympic Committee was 52 to 27.
Calgary won the 1988 Winter Games in a runoff over a
combined bid by the Swedish cities of Falun and Are. The
vote was 48 to 31, after a first round in which Calgary had
a plurality of 35 votes, the Swedish cities had 25, ancfCor
tina d'Amprezzo, Italy, only 18.
The votes came as a surprise to lOC leaders, some of
whom had said only the night before that Nagoya and
Cortina were the favorites.
Neither Seoul nor Calgary has ever held the games
before. Japan has had them twice. There also appeared
to be some resentment among the lOC over what was
perceived to be overly heavy Japanese pressure at the
end.
In going to Seoul, the lOC places the Olympics on the
Asian mainland for the first time in their history. And
some Third-World representatives here said that they
viewed Seoul as the first Third-World city to host the
games.
In going to Seoul, the capital of an American ally, the
lOC startled its Soviet and other Eastern-Bloc members.
Soviet representatives disappeared only moments after
the announcements. Eastern European members ex
pressed surprise but reserved other comment.
Auto safety standards relaxed
Washington (AP) — The Transportation Department
announced yesterday it will soften its requirement that
passenger car bumpers must withstand a 5 mph collision
without damage to the rest of the car.
The auto industry has been pushing for such a change,
saying the standards add to the cost of a car without com
parable safety benefits.
"We believe that the interests of the public are not
served by retention of a standard which may cost con
sumers more than it saves," said Ray Peck, the adminis
tration's top auto safety official.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced it will hold hearings in a few weeks on a vari
ety of proposed changes ranging from a reduction of the
impact speed standard to eliminating the impact criteria
altogether.
The announcement brought quick criticism from
Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety,
a consumer group founded by auto industry critic Ralph
Nader.
Ditlow called the proposed changes "an affront to
consumers" and disputed Peck's contention that the
changes would economically benefit auto buyers. He
said automakers already are manufacturing the heavier
bumpers and retooling costs would be passed onto the
buyer.
Stock market creeps upward
New York — The stock market was mixed in moderate
trading yesterday but most key measures posted their
third straight gains, albeit small ones.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
nearly 24 points in the previous two sessions, gained an
other 2.09 points to 849.98.
Advances led declines by just under 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

China offers Taiwan olive branch
Beijing — China offered Taiwan reunification terms
today that for the first time mention letting Taiwanese
leaders join in running the Communist government
while keeping control of their island nation's local af
fairs.
But James Soons, director general of the Government
Information Office on laiwan and the principal Na
tionalist spokesman, dismissed the new Communist pro
posal as "essentially a continuation of Beijing's propa
ganda" and said it contained nothing new.
Chinese Communist officials were not dismayed by
the Nationalists' immediate rejection of the new pro
posal, calling that predictable. They expressed con
fidence yesterday tnat it would spark discussion on
Taiwan of the ways the country might be reunified and
that this in turn would increase pressure on the govern
ment there to be more flexible.
Beijing implied there would be further concessions to
the Taiwanese, and it proposed an "exhaustive exchange
of views" as a preliminary to the actual negotiations so
that the Nationalist side could assure itself of the Com
munists' intentions before making any commitments.
Rong Yiren, a former Shanghai industrialist who now is
a top investment official ana banker here, also pointed
out that Taiwan businessmen wouid be invited to invest
on the mainland with guarantees that their property
would not be seized and that their profits could be taken
out.

If the House and Senate have not rejected the $8.5
billion sale by Oct. 30, the deal goes through.
It includes five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes plus Sidewinder missiles and longrang fuel
tanks for 62 Saudi F-15 jet fighters.
The administration says the sale is vital for defending
the Saudi oil supply but opponents call it a threat to Israel
and a compromise of supersecret equipment.
Earlier, Haig sent Ambassador Richard Murphy to
Saudi Arabia with a new compromise proposal for joint
US-Saudi manning of the planes in an effort to mollify
Congress.
High official doubts SALT outcome
Washington — Despite the recent US-Soviet agree
ment to begin talks Nov. 30 on limiting tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe, the two sides are fundamentally at
odds on almost every aspect of the negotiations, a senior
US official said yesterday.
Speaking to reporters before Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig left nis United Nations heaciquartetsjor a
White House meeting on AWACS[ the official, who
spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the
{disagreements cover basic definitions, scope and range
of the weapons to be covered in talks.
These fundamental differences, which emerged dur

ing the talks between Haig and Soviet foreign minister
Andrei Gromyko in New York, limit the likelinood of re
ducing East-West tensions anytime soon.
Regarding the arms talks, it was disclosed that the
United States will insist that all tactical nuclear weapons
on the Eurasian continent be discussed "in a global con
text." This will include the 75 Soviet SS-20 missiles
deployed in the eastern Soviet Union and targeted on
China, rather than on Western Europe.
The Soviets, however, want to limit the talks to the Eu
ropean region, and to include sea-based missiles
deployed within the Atlantic alliance and the "forward
based systems" — US medium-range fighter bombers
capable of delivering nuclear warheads on Warsaw Pact
targets, the senior official said.
The United States intends to refuse to discuss anything
other than land-based tactical nuclear weapons in the
early stages of the negotiations.
It was also disclosed that Gromyko told Haig that the
Soviets want to separate the talks on tactical nuclear
weapons from the larger framework of strategic arms
talks with which they had traditionally been associated.
In addition, the officials speculate that the Soviets
want to block any US move to turn aside a Soviet demand
in the tactical nuclear force talks with a claim that the is
sue should properly be reserved for strategic arms talks.
Emergency funding bill nears OK
Washington — Congress debated past a midnight
deadline yesterday as it struggled to complete an emer
gency spending bill for the federal government that con
fained liberalized tax breaks and virtually automatic pay
raises for members of Congress.
Theoretically, the government ran out of money when
midnight tolled the end of the fiscal year without con
gressional approval of the stopgap bill tofund numerous
federal agencies and departments.
But in practice, disruptions in government services
were certain to be slight, since Congress intended to
swiftly send the bill to President Ronald Reagan.
House members approved the legislation by voice
vote less than 90 minutes before the deadline.
But the Senate debate stretched past midnight despite
efforts by Republican Leader Howard Baker to expedite
passage of the bill.
In a few hectic hours of bargaining, the House and
Senate also approved a plan allowing senators to earn
unlimited income from outside speaking engagements.
But they rejected a proposal for an immediate 4.8 per
cent pay increase for themselves and dumped a Senate
passed provision granting pay raises to several thousand
federal workers' salary has been capped for four years.
The bill is designed to keep money available for feder
al programs through Nov. 20, when experts estimate that
most it not all of the 13 regular appropriations bills will be
approved.
While most of the money in the bill would go to keep
ing federal programs and agencies from shutting down,
the most controversial issues centered on financial bene
fits for members of Congress.
Earlier, the conference committee agreed to spend
$125 million to help operate a Middle East peacekeeping
force in the Sinai Desert, but barred stationingany Amer
ican troops there without prior approval of Congress.
The committee also forced Sen. Mack Mattingly (R-
Ca.) to back down on a proposal to prohibit the Library
of Congress from spending any money to translate cer
tain parts of Playboy magazine into Braille.
Postal rates raised Nov. 1
Washington — The US Postal Board of Governors an
nounced yesterday it had voted to raise the price of first
class postage from 18 cents to 20 cents and post cards
from 12 cents to 13 cents effective Nov. 1.
The new rates — the subject of a bureaucratic battle
for more than a year — should remain in effect at leastfor
two years, depending on inflation, said Robert Hardesty,
chairman of tne board of governors.
The Postal Service is cranking out a "C" series stamp
that will be worth 20 cents and will be available in a few
days, a spokesman said.
Hardesty said the Postal Service lost nearly $126 million

during the first five months under the current rates. The
new rates should add $1 billion annually to Postal Service
revenues and provide a $100 million operating profit for
the 12 months ending next February, Hardesty said. The
independent Postal Rate Commission, which recom
mends rate changes, rejected proposals for a 20-cent
first-class rate three times in favor of the 18-cent rate,
saying the increased postage was unnecessary. This was
the first increase imposed unilaterally by the governors
without approval by the commission.
The last increase before this year was in May 1978,
when first-class postage rose from 13 to 15 cents. It is the
sixth increase since 1971, when mailing a letter cost 6
cents.
Several industries involved in heavy use of the mails
such as greeting card manufacturers are expected to
challenge the decision before a federal appeals court.
Under tne Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, however,
the rates cannot be suspended by an appellate judge un
til the lawsuit challenging the rates hasended, according
to a Postal Service attorney.
During a press conference Wednesday, a reporter
asked why rates were raised by 2 cents -or first class ma'fl,
which households use, but did not change for business
reply mail, which often is used for "junk mail." Post
master William Bolger replied that individual letters cost
more to handle than other kinds of mail.
Although the cost of a first-class stamp will rise to 20
cents, the cost of each additional ounce will remain at 17
cents. There will also be no increase in parcel post and
slight increases in Express Mail.
Iranian leaders killed in crash
Tehran — The top echelons of the Iranian armed
forces suffered a heavy blow yesterday, just three days
after a decisive victory on the Iraqi front, with the deaths
of four leading military figures in a plane crash near
Tehran.
Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Valli Fellahi; Defense
Minister Mussa Namiu; the former defense minister and
adviser to the chief of staff, Col. Javad Fakuri, and the act
ing head of the Revolutionary Guards were killed while
returning from the Khuzestan front, where they had suc
cessfully commanded the liberation of Abaaan from
Iraqi forces over the weekend.
Their Hercules C-130 transport crashed into the Khar
izak shooting range 6 miles from Tehran Air Base as thev
were returning from Ahvaz, just north of Abadan, an of
ficial communique said.
Abadan is a major oil-refining center long held under
Iraqi siege until last weekend.
Fellahi had been armed forces chief of staff for more
than a year and had taken charge of army operations af
ter the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war a year ago.
Senate lifts aid restrictions
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed Presi
dent Ronald Reagan two important foreign policy vic
tories, voting to repeal a 1976 provision prohibiting aid to
any faction in Angola's civil war, and to permit aid to Ar
gentina, banned tor human rights reasons since 1978.
With Republicans saying the administration has no
current plans to supply sucn aid, the Senate repealed the
so-called Clark amendment, passed five years ago in an
effort to prevent US intervention in the southern African
nation. It was named after former Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), who proposed it for fear the government would
otherwise jump in on the side of Angola's anti-Marxist
rebels.
The Clark amendment is one of a number of foreign
policy restrictions that Congress placed on the president
in the years just after the war in Vietnam and that the
Reagan administration now wants removed.
The key vote came on an amendment by Sen. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), which would have kept the Clark
amendment in force until March 31, 1983, or until a
ceasefire is reached in the civil war in neighboring
Namibia, which would substantially reduce tensions in
the region generally.
The Tsongas amendment was beaten 66-29. The Senate
then adopted by voice vote an amendment by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) which would permit aid, but still
not without the prior approval of Congress.
The debate yesterday centered on what kind of "sig
nal" repeal would send, and how it would affect the on

going peace negotiations in Namibia. Tsongas and other
opponents argued it would endanger the negotiations
and signal that the United States no longer supports a
policy of restraint in black Africa.
Supporters of the repeal replied that failure to lift the
aid ban would tie Reagan's hands in dealing with Africa
and be an open invitation for continued Cuban and Sovi
et intervention in the continent.
The Argentina amendment, also adopted by voice
vote, dropped the provision in the committee Dill that
would have linked military sales and aid to a full account
ing by the Argentine government of thousands of "dis
appeared" persons. Aid would still be conditioned on
human rights certifications by the president, however.
Seoul, Calgary to host '88 Olympics
Baden-Baden, West Germany — Seoul, South Korea,
was awarded the 1988 Summer Olympic Games yester
day in a stunning upset over Nagoya, japan. The vote by
the International Olympic Committee was 52 to 27.
Calgary won the 1988 Winter Games in a runoff over a
combined bid by the Swedish cities of Falun and Are. The
vote was 48 to 31, after a first round in which Calgary had
a plurality of 35 votes, the Swedish cities had 25, ancfCor
tina d'Amprezzo, Italy, only 18.
The votes came as a surprise to lOC leaders, some of
whom had said only the night before that Nagoya and
Cortina were the favorites.
Neither Seoul nor Calgary has ever held the games
before. Japan has had them twice. There also appeared
to be some resentment among the lOC over what was
perceived to be overly heavy Japanese pressure at the
end.
In going to Seoul, the lOC places the Olympics on the
Asian mainland for the first time in their history. And
some Third-World representatives here said that they
viewed Seoul as the first Third-World city to host the
games.
In going to Seoul, the capital of an American ally, the
lOC startled its Soviet and other Eastern-Bloc members.
Soviet representatives disappeared only moments after
the announcements. Eastern European members ex
pressed surprise but reserved other comment.
Auto safety standards relaxed
Washington (AP) — The Transportation Department
announced yesterday it will soften its requirement that
passenger car bumpers must withstand a 5 mph collision
without damage to the rest of the car.
The auto industry has been pushing for such a change,
saying the standards add to the cost of a car without com
parable safety benefits.
"We believe that the interests of the public are not
served by retention of a standard which may cost con
sumers more than it saves," said Ray Peck, the adminis
tration's top auto safety official.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced it will hold hearings in a few weeks on a vari
ety of proposed changes ranging from a reduction of the
impact speed standard to eliminating the impact criteria
altogether.
The announcement brought quick criticism from
Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety,
a consumer group founded by auto industry critic Ralph
Nader.
Ditlow called the proposed changes "an affront to
consumers" and disputed Peck's contention that the
changes would economically benefit auto buyers. He
said automakers already are manufacturing the heavier
bumpers and retooling costs would be passed onto the
buyer.
Stock market creeps upward
New York — The stock market was mixed in moderate
trading yesterday but most key measures posted their
third straight gains, albeit small ones.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
nearly 24 points in the previous two sessions, gained an
other 2.09 points to 849.98.
Advances led declines by just under 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

China offers Taiwan olive branch
Beijing — China offered Taiwan reunification terms
today that for the first time mention letting Taiwanese
leaders join in running the Communist government
while keeping control of their island nation's local af
fairs.
But James Soons, director general of the Government
Information Office on laiwan and the principal Na
tionalist spokesman, dismissed the new Communist pro
posal as "essentially a continuation of Beijing's propa
ganda" and said it contained nothing new.
Chinese Communist officials were not dismayed by
the Nationalists' immediate rejection of the new pro
posal, calling that predictable. They expressed con
fidence yesterday tnat it would spark discussion on
Taiwan of the ways the country might be reunified and
that this in turn would increase pressure on the govern
ment there to be more flexible.
Beijing implied there would be further concessions to
the Taiwanese, and it proposed an "exhaustive exchange
of views" as a preliminary to the actual negotiations so
that the Nationalist side could assure itself of the Com
munists' intentions before making any commitments.
Rong Yiren, a former Shanghai industrialist who now is
a top investment official ana banker here, also pointed
out that Taiwan businessmen wouid be invited to invest
on the mainland with guarantees that their property
would not be seized and that their profits could be taken
out.
While a high-ranking Chinese army officer told re
porters that tne purpose of Beijing's overture was to re
duce fears of the mainland among people on Taiwan,
Western diplomats saw it as aimed at the United States.
The diplomats, who asked not to be named, said one
aim appeared to be to make it harder for President
Ronald Reagan to justify arms sales to Taiwan, and to pre
pare the Chinese public for worsened US-China rela
tions if the sales go through.
Baker says AWACS deal delayed
Washington — Senate Republican Leader Howard
Baker told President Ronald Reagan yesterday he does
not have the votes to clear the $8.5 billion arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig hur

A 30-day clock for congressional veto of the sale was to

ducing East-West tensions anytime soon.
Regarding the arms talks, it was disclosed that the
United States will insist that all tactical nuclear weapons
on the Eurasian continent be discussed "in a global con
text." This will include the 75 Soviet SS-20 missiles
deployed in the eastern Soviet Union and targeted on
China, rather than on Western Europe.
The Soviets, however, want to limit the talks to the Eu
ropean region, and to include sea-based missiles
deployed within the Atlantic alliance and the "forward
based systems" — US medium-range fighter bombers
capable of delivering nuclear warheads on Warsaw Pact
targets, the senior official said.
The United States intends to refuse to discuss anything
other than land-based tactical nuclear weapons in the
early stages of the negotiations.
It was also disclosed that Gromyko told Haig that the
Soviets want to separate the talks on tactical nuclear
weapons from the larger framework of strategic arms
talks with which they had traditionally been associated.
In addition, the officials speculate that the Soviets
want to block any US move to turn aside a Soviet demand
in the tactical nuclear force talks with a claim that the is
sue should properly be reserved for strategic arms talks.
Emergency funding bill nears OK
Washington — Congress debated past a midnight
deadline yesterday as it struggled to complete an emer
gency spending bill for the federal government that con
fained liberalized tax breaks and virtually automatic pay
raises for members of Congress.
Theoretically, the government ran out of money when
midnight tolled the end of the fiscal year without con
gressional approval of the stopgap bill tofund numerous
federal agencies and departments.
But in practice, disruptions in government services
were certain to be slight, since Congress intended to
swiftly send the bill to President Ronald Reagan.
House members approved the legislation by voice
vote less than 90 minutes before the deadline.
But the Senate debate stretched past midnight despite
efforts by Republican Leader Howard Baker to expedite
passage of the bill.
In a few hectic hours of bargaining, the House and
Senate also approved a plan allowing senators to earn
unlimited income from outside speaking engagements.
But they rejected a proposal for an immediate 4.8 per
cent pay increase for themselves and dumped a Senate
passed provision granting pay raises to several thousand
federal workers' salary has been capped for four years.
The bill is designed to keep money available for feder
al programs through Nov. 20, when experts estimate that
most it not all of the 13 regular appropriations bills will be
approved.
While most of the money in the bill would go to keep
ing federal programs and agencies from shutting down,
the most controversial issues centered on financial bene
fits for members of Congress.
Earlier, the conference committee agreed to spend
$125 million to help operate a Middle East peacekeeping
force in the Sinai Desert, but barred stationingany Amer
ican troops there without prior approval of Congress.
The committee also forced Sen. Mack Mattingly (R-
Ca.) to back down on a proposal to prohibit the Library
of Congress from spending any money to translate cer
tain parts of Playboy magazine into Braille.
Postal rates raised Nov. 1
Washington — The US Postal Board of Governors an
nounced yesterday it had voted to raise the price of first
class postage from 18 cents to 20 cents and post cards
from 12 cents to 13 cents effective Nov. 1.
The new rates — the subject of a bureaucratic battle
for more than a year — should remain in effect at leastfor
two years, depending on inflation, said Robert Hardesty,
chairman of tne board of governors.
The Postal Service is cranking out a "C" series stamp
that will be worth 20 cents and will be available in a few
days, a spokesman said.
Hardesty said the Postal Service lost nearly $126 million

during the first five months under the current rates. The
new rates should add $1 billion annually to Postal Service
revenues and provide a $100 million operating profit for
the 12 months ending next February, Hardesty said. The
independent Postal Rate Commission, which recom
mends rate changes, rejected proposals for a 20-cent
first-class rate three times in favor of the 18-cent rate,
saying the increased postage was unnecessary. This was
the first increase imposed unilaterally by the governors
without approval by the commission.
The last increase before this year was in May 1978,
when first-class postage rose from 13 to 15 cents. It is the
sixth increase since 1971, when mailing a letter cost 6
cents.
Several industries involved in heavy use of the mails
such as greeting card manufacturers are expected to
challenge the decision before a federal appeals court.
Under tne Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, however,
the rates cannot be suspended by an appellate judge un
til the lawsuit challenging the rates hasended, according
to a Postal Service attorney.
During a press conference Wednesday, a reporter
asked why rates were raised by 2 cents -or first class ma'fl,
which households use, but did not change for business
reply mail, which often is used for "junk mail." Post
master William Bolger replied that individual letters cost
more to handle than other kinds of mail.
Although the cost of a first-class stamp will rise to 20
cents, the cost of each additional ounce will remain at 17
cents. There will also be no increase in parcel post and
slight increases in Express Mail.
Iranian leaders killed in crash
Tehran — The top echelons of the Iranian armed
forces suffered a heavy blow yesterday, just three days
after a decisive victory on the Iraqi front, with the deaths
of four leading military figures in a plane crash near
Tehran.
Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Valli Fellahi; Defense
Minister Mussa Namiu; the former defense minister and
adviser to the chief of staff, Col. Javad Fakuri, and the act
ing head of the Revolutionary Guards were killed while
returning from the Khuzestan front, where they had suc
cessfully commanded the liberation of Abaaan from
Iraqi forces over the weekend.
Their Hercules C-130 transport crashed into the Khar
izak shooting range 6 miles from Tehran Air Base as thev
were returning from Ahvaz, just north of Abadan, an of
ficial communique said.
Abadan is a major oil-refining center long held under
Iraqi siege until last weekend.
Fellahi had been armed forces chief of staff for more
than a year and had taken charge of army operations af
ter the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war a year ago.
Senate lifts aid restrictions
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed Presi
dent Ronald Reagan two important foreign policy vic
tories, voting to repeal a 1976 provision prohibiting aid to
any faction in Angola's civil war, and to permit aid to Ar
gentina, banned tor human rights reasons since 1978.
With Republicans saying the administration has no
current plans to supply sucn aid, the Senate repealed the
so-called Clark amendment, passed five years ago in an
effort to prevent US intervention in the southern African
nation. It was named after former Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), who proposed it for fear the government would
otherwise jump in on the side of Angola's anti-Marxist
rebels.
The Clark amendment is one of a number of foreign
policy restrictions that Congress placed on the president
in the years just after the war in Vietnam and that the
Reagan administration now wants removed.
The key vote came on an amendment by Sen. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), which would have kept the Clark
amendment in force until March 31, 1983, or until a
ceasefire is reached in the civil war in neighboring
Namibia, which would substantially reduce tensions in
the region generally.
The Tsongas amendment was beaten 66-29. The Senate
then adopted by voice vote an amendment by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) which would permit aid, but still
not without the prior approval of Congress.
The debate yesterday centered on what kind of "sig
nal" repeal would send, and how it would affect the on

going peace negotiations in Namibia. Tsongas and other
opponents argued it would endanger the negotiations
and signal that the United States no longer supports a
policy of restraint in black Africa.
Supporters of the repeal replied that failure to lift the
aid ban would tie Reagan's hands in dealing with Africa
and be an open invitation for continued Cuban and Sovi
et intervention in the continent.
The Argentina amendment, also adopted by voice
vote, dropped the provision in the committee Dill that
would have linked military sales and aid to a full account
ing by the Argentine government of thousands of "dis
appeared" persons. Aid would still be conditioned on
human rights certifications by the president, however.
Seoul, Calgary to host '88 Olympics
Baden-Baden, West Germany — Seoul, South Korea,
was awarded the 1988 Summer Olympic Games yester
day in a stunning upset over Nagoya, japan. The vote by
the International Olympic Committee was 52 to 27.
Calgary won the 1988 Winter Games in a runoff over a
combined bid by the Swedish cities of Falun and Are. The
vote was 48 to 31, after a first round in which Calgary had
a plurality of 35 votes, the Swedish cities had 25, ancfCor
tina d'Amprezzo, Italy, only 18.
The votes came as a surprise to lOC leaders, some of
whom had said only the night before that Nagoya and
Cortina were the favorites.
Neither Seoul nor Calgary has ever held the games
before. Japan has had them twice. There also appeared
to be some resentment among the lOC over what was
perceived to be overly heavy Japanese pressure at the
end.
In going to Seoul, the lOC places the Olympics on the
Asian mainland for the first time in their history. And
some Third-World representatives here said that they
viewed Seoul as the first Third-World city to host the
games.
In going to Seoul, the capital of an American ally, the
lOC startled its Soviet and other Eastern-Bloc members.
Soviet representatives disappeared only moments after
the announcements. Eastern European members ex
pressed surprise but reserved other comment.
Auto safety standards relaxed
Washington (AP) — The Transportation Department
announced yesterday it will soften its requirement that
passenger car bumpers must withstand a 5 mph collision
without damage to the rest of the car.
The auto industry has been pushing for such a change,
saying the standards add to the cost of a car without com
parable safety benefits.
"We believe that the interests of the public are not
served by retention of a standard which may cost con
sumers more than it saves," said Ray Peck, the adminis
tration's top auto safety official.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced it will hold hearings in a few weeks on a vari
ety of proposed changes ranging from a reduction of the
impact speed standard to eliminating the impact criteria
altogether.
The announcement brought quick criticism from
Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety,
a consumer group founded by auto industry critic Ralph
Nader.
Ditlow called the proposed changes "an affront to
consumers" and disputed Peck's contention that the
changes would economically benefit auto buyers. He
said automakers already are manufacturing the heavier
bumpers and retooling costs would be passed onto the
buyer.
Stock market creeps upward
New York — The stock market was mixed in moderate
trading yesterday but most key measures posted their
third straight gains, albeit small ones.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose

other 2.09 points to 849.98.
Advances led declines by just under 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

China offers Taiwan olive branch
Beijing — China offered Taiwan reunification terms
today that for the first time mention letting Taiwanese
leaders join in running the Communist government
while keeping control of their island nation's local af
fairs.
But James Soons, director general of the Government
Information Office on laiwan and the principal Na
tionalist spokesman, dismissed the new Communist pro
posal as "essentially a continuation of Beijing's propa
ganda" and said it contained nothing new.
Chinese Communist officials were not dismayed by
the Nationalists' immediate rejection of the new pro
posal, calling that predictable. They expressed con
fidence yesterday tnat it would spark discussion on
Taiwan of the ways the country might be reunified and
that this in turn would increase pressure on the govern
ment there to be more flexible.
Beijing implied there would be further concessions to
the Taiwanese, and it proposed an "exhaustive exchange
of views" as a preliminary to the actual negotiations so
that the Nationalist side could assure itself of the Com
munists' intentions before making any commitments.
Rong Yiren, a former Shanghai industrialist who now is
a top investment official ana banker here, also pointed
out that Taiwan businessmen wouid be invited to invest
on the mainland with guarantees that their property
would not be seized and that their profits could be taken
out.
While a high-ranking Chinese army officer told re
porters that tne purpose of Beijing's overture was to re
duce fears of the mainland among people on Taiwan,
Western diplomats saw it as aimed at the United States.
The diplomats, who asked not to be named, said one
aim appeared to be to make it harder for President
Ronald Reagan to justify arms sales to Taiwan, and to pre
pare the Chinese public for worsened US-China rela
tions if the sales go through.
Baker says AWACS deal delayed
Washington — Senate Republican Leader Howard
Baker told President Ronald Reagan yesterday he does
not have the votes to clear the $8.5 billion arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig hur
ried home from the United Nations to try to save the
deal. , , . . ...
Baker told reporters he thinks the president still can
win the congressional test, but opponents now have the
upper hand. . , AI ., A( ~ c
''I think Ronald Reagan's goine to get the AWACS
through," Baker said. But for now, Fie told reporters "We
don't nave the votes."
A 30-day clock for congressional veto of the sale was to
start running later in the day with the administration s
formal submission of the sale to Congress.
If the House and Senate have not rejected the $8.5
billion sale by Oct. 30, the deal goes through.
It includes five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes plus Sidewinder missiles and longrang fuel
tanks for 62 Saudi F-15 jet fighters.
The administration says the sale is vital for defending
the Saudi oil supply but opponents call it a threat to Israel
and a compromise of supersecret equipment.
Earlier, Haig sent Ambassador Richard Murphy to
Saudi Arabia with a new compromise proposal for joint
US-Saudi manning of the planes in an effort to mollify
Congress.
High official doubts SALT outcome
Washington — Despite the recent US-Soviet agree

weapons in Europe, the two sides are fundamentally at

US official said yesterday.

gency spending bill for the federal government that con
fained liberalized tax breaks and virtually automatic pay
raises for members of Congress.
Theoretically, the government ran out of money when
midnight tolled the end of the fiscal year without con
gressional approval of the stopgap bill tofund numerous
federal agencies and departments.
But in practice, disruptions in government services
were certain to be slight, since Congress intended to
swiftly send the bill to President Ronald Reagan.
House members approved the legislation by voice
vote less than 90 minutes before the deadline.
But the Senate debate stretched past midnight despite
efforts by Republican Leader Howard Baker to expedite
passage of the bill.
In a few hectic hours of bargaining, the House and
Senate also approved a plan allowing senators to earn
unlimited income from outside speaking engagements.
But they rejected a proposal for an immediate 4.8 per
cent pay increase for themselves and dumped a Senate
passed provision granting pay raises to several thousand
federal workers' salary has been capped for four years.
The bill is designed to keep money available for feder
al programs through Nov. 20, when experts estimate that
most it not all of the 13 regular appropriations bills will be
approved.
While most of the money in the bill would go to keep
ing federal programs and agencies from shutting down,
the most controversial issues centered on financial bene
fits for members of Congress.
Earlier, the conference committee agreed to spend
$125 million to help operate a Middle East peacekeeping
force in the Sinai Desert, but barred stationingany Amer
ican troops there without prior approval of Congress.
The committee also forced Sen. Mack Mattingly (R-
Ca.) to back down on a proposal to prohibit the Library
of Congress from spending any money to translate cer
tain parts of Playboy magazine into Braille.
Postal rates raised Nov. 1
Washington — The US Postal Board of Governors an
nounced yesterday it had voted to raise the price of first
class postage from 18 cents to 20 cents and post cards
from 12 cents to 13 cents effective Nov. 1.
The new rates — the subject of a bureaucratic battle
for more than a year — should remain in effect at leastfor
two years, depending on inflation, said Robert Hardesty,
chairman of tne board of governors.
The Postal Service is cranking out a "C" series stamp
that will be worth 20 cents and will be available in a few
days, a spokesman said.
Hardesty said the Postal Service lost nearly $126 million

during the first five months under the current rates. The
new rates should add $1 billion annually to Postal Service
revenues and provide a $100 million operating profit for
the 12 months ending next February, Hardesty said. The
independent Postal Rate Commission, which recom
mends rate changes, rejected proposals for a 20-cent
first-class rate three times in favor of the 18-cent rate,
saying the increased postage was unnecessary. This was
the first increase imposed unilaterally by the governors
without approval by the commission.
The last increase before this year was in May 1978,
when first-class postage rose from 13 to 15 cents. It is the
sixth increase since 1971, when mailing a letter cost 6
cents.
Several industries involved in heavy use of the mails
such as greeting card manufacturers are expected to
challenge the decision before a federal appeals court.
Under tne Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, however,
the rates cannot be suspended by an appellate judge un
til the lawsuit challenging the rates hasended, according
to a Postal Service attorney.
During a press conference Wednesday, a reporter
asked why rates were raised by 2 cents -or first class ma'fl,
which households use, but did not change for business
reply mail, which often is used for "junk mail." Post
master William Bolger replied that individual letters cost
more to handle than other kinds of mail.
Although the cost of a first-class stamp will rise to 20
cents, the cost of each additional ounce will remain at 17
cents. There will also be no increase in parcel post and
slight increases in Express Mail.
Iranian leaders killed in crash
Tehran — The top echelons of the Iranian armed
forces suffered a heavy blow yesterday, just three days
after a decisive victory on the Iraqi front, with the deaths
of four leading military figures in a plane crash near
Tehran.
Armed forces chief of staff Gen. Valli Fellahi; Defense
Minister Mussa Namiu; the former defense minister and
adviser to the chief of staff, Col. Javad Fakuri, and the act
ing head of the Revolutionary Guards were killed while
returning from the Khuzestan front, where they had suc
cessfully commanded the liberation of Abaaan from
Iraqi forces over the weekend.
Their Hercules C-130 transport crashed into the Khar
izak shooting range 6 miles from Tehran Air Base as thev
were returning from Ahvaz, just north of Abadan, an of
ficial communique said.
Abadan is a major oil-refining center long held under
Iraqi siege until last weekend.
Fellahi had been armed forces chief of staff for more
than a year and had taken charge of army operations af
ter the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war a year ago.
Senate lifts aid restrictions
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed Presi
dent Ronald Reagan two important foreign policy vic
tories, voting to repeal a 1976 provision prohibiting aid to
any faction in Angola's civil war, and to permit aid to Ar
gentina, banned tor human rights reasons since 1978.
With Republicans saying the administration has no
current plans to supply sucn aid, the Senate repealed the
so-called Clark amendment, passed five years ago in an
effort to prevent US intervention in the southern African
nation. It was named after former Sen. Dick Clark (D
-lowa), who proposed it for fear the government would
otherwise jump in on the side of Angola's anti-Marxist
rebels.
The Clark amendment is one of a number of foreign
policy restrictions that Congress placed on the president
in the years just after the war in Vietnam and that the
Reagan administration now wants removed.
The key vote came on an amendment by Sen. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), which would have kept the Clark
amendment in force until March 31, 1983, or until a
ceasefire is reached in the civil war in neighboring
Namibia, which would substantially reduce tensions in
the region generally.
The Tsongas amendment was beaten 66-29. The Senate
then adopted by voice vote an amendment by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) which would permit aid, but still
not without the prior approval of Congress.
The debate yesterday centered on what kind of "sig
nal" repeal would send, and how it would affect the on

going peace negotiations in Namibia. Tsongas and other
opponents argued it would endanger the negotiations
and signal that the United States no longer supports a
policy of restraint in black Africa.
Supporters of the repeal replied that failure to lift the
aid ban would tie Reagan's hands in dealing with Africa
and be an open invitation for continued Cuban and Sovi
et intervention in the continent.
The Argentina amendment, also adopted by voice
vote, dropped the provision in the committee Dill that
would have linked military sales and aid to a full account
ing by the Argentine government of thousands of "dis
appeared" persons. Aid would still be conditioned on
human rights certifications by the president, however.
Seoul, Calgary to host '88 Olympics
Baden-Baden, West Germany — Seoul, South Korea,
was awarded the 1988 Summer Olympic Games yester
day in a stunning upset over Nagoya, japan. The vote by
the International Olympic Committee was 52 to 27.
Calgary won the 1988 Winter Games in a runoff over a
combined bid by the Swedish cities of Falun and Are. The
vote was 48 to 31, after a first round in which Calgary had
a plurality of 35 votes, the Swedish cities had 25, ancfCor
tina d'Amprezzo, Italy, only 18.
The votes came as a surprise to lOC leaders, some of
whom had said only the night before that Nagoya and
Cortina were the favorites.
Neither Seoul nor Calgary has ever held the games
before. Japan has had them twice. There also appeared
to be some resentment among the lOC over what was
perceived to be overly heavy Japanese pressure at the
end.
In going to Seoul, the lOC places the Olympics on the
Asian mainland for the first time in their history. And
some Third-World representatives here said that they
viewed Seoul as the first Third-World city to host the
games.
In going to Seoul, the capital of an American ally, the
lOC startled its Soviet and other Eastern-Bloc members.
Soviet representatives disappeared only moments after
the announcements. Eastern European members ex
pressed surprise but reserved other comment.
Auto safety standards relaxed
Washington (AP) — The Transportation Department
announced yesterday it will soften its requirement that
passenger car bumpers must withstand a 5 mph collision
without damage to the rest of the car.
The auto industry has been pushing for such a change,
saying the standards add to the cost of a car without com
parable safety benefits.
"We believe that the interests of the public are not
served by retention of a standard which may cost con
sumers more than it saves," said Ray Peck, the adminis
tration's top auto safety official.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced it will hold hearings in a few weeks on a vari
ety of proposed changes ranging from a reduction of the
impact speed standard to eliminating the impact criteria
altogether.
The announcement brought quick criticism from
Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety,
a consumer group founded by auto industry critic Ralph
Nader.
Ditlow called the proposed changes "an affront to
consumers" and disputed Peck's contention that the
changes would economically benefit auto buyers. He
said automakers already are manufacturing the heavier
bumpers and retooling costs would be passed onto the
buyer.

New York — The stock market was mixed in moderate
trading yesterday but most key measures posted their
third straight gains, albeit small ones.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose

other 2.09 points to 849.98.
Advances led declines by just under 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
- Big Board volume was 40.70 million shares compared
with 49.80 million Tuesday.

China offers Taiwan olive branch
Beijing — China offered Taiwan reunification terms
today that for the first time mention letting Taiwanese
leaders join in running the Communist government
while keeping control of their island nation's local af
fairs.
But James Soons, director general of the Government
Information Office on laiwan and the principal Na
tionalist spokesman, dismissed the new Communist pro
posal as "essentially a continuation of Beijing's propa
ganda" and said it contained nothing new.
Chinese Communist officials were not dismayed by
the Nationalists' immediate rejection of the new pro
posal, calling that predictable. They expressed con
fidence yesterday tnat it would spark discussion on
Taiwan of the ways the country might be reunified and
that this in turn would increase pressure on the govern
ment there to be more flexible.
Beijing implied there would be further concessions to
the Taiwanese, and it proposed an "exhaustive exchange
of views" as a preliminary to the actual negotiations so
that the Nationalist side could assure itself of the Com
munists' intentions before making any commitments.
Rong Yiren, a former Shanghai industrialist who now is
a top investment official ana banker here, also pointed
out that Taiwan businessmen wouid be invited to invest
on the mainland with guarantees that their property
would not be seized and that their profits could be taken
out.
While a high-ranking Chinese army officer told re
porters that tne purpose of Beijing's overture was to re
duce fears of the mainland among people on Taiwan,
Western diplomats saw it as aimed at the United States.
The diplomats, who asked not to be named, said one
aim appeared to be to make it harder for President
Ronald Reagan to justify arms sales to Taiwan, and to pre
pare the Chinese public for worsened US-China rela
tions if the sales go through.
Baker says AWACS deal delayed
Washington — Senate Republican Leader Howard
Baker told President Ronald Reagan yesterday he does
not have the votes to clear the $8.5 billion arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, and Secretary of State Alexander Haig hur
ried home from the United Nations to try to save the
deal. , , . . ...
Baker told reporters he thinks the president still can
win the congressional test, but opponents now have the
upper hand. . , AI ., A( ~ c
''I think Ronald Reagan's goine to get the AWACS
through," Baker said. But for now, Fie told reporters "We
don't nave the votes."
A 30-day clock for congressional veto of the sale was to
start running later in the day with the administration s
formal submission of the sale to Congress.
If the House and Senate have not rejected the $8.5
billion sale by Oct. 30, the deal goes through.
It includes five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes plus Sidewinder missiles and longrang fuel
tanks for 62 Saudi F-15 jet fighters.
The administration says the sale is vital for defending
the Saudi oil supply but opponents call it a threat to Israel
and a compromise of supersecret equipment.
Earlier, Haig sent Ambassador Richard Murphy to
Saudi Arabia with a new compromise proposal for joint
US-Saudi manning of the planes in an effort to mollify
Congress.
High official doubts SALT outcome
Washington — Despite the recent US-Soviet agree
ment to begin talks Nov. 30 on limiting tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe, the two sides are fundamentally at
odds on almost every aspect of the negotiations, a senior
US official said yesterday.
Speaking to reporters before Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig left nis United Nations heaciquartetsjor a
White House meeting on AWACS[ the official, who
spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the
{disagreements cover basic definitions, scope and range
of the weapons to be covered in talks.
These fundamental differences, which emerged dur

ing the talks between Haig and Soviet foreign minister
Andrei Gromyko in New York, limit the likelinood of re
ducing East-West tensions anytime soon.
Regarding the arms talks, it was disclosed that the
United States will insist that all tactical nuclear weapons
on the Eurasian continent be discussed "in a global con
text." This will include the 75 Soviet SS-20 missiles
deployed in the eastern Soviet Union and targeted on
China, rather than on Western Europe.
The Soviets, however, want to limit the talks to the Eu
ropean region, and to include sea-based missiles
deployed within the Atlantic alliance and the "forward
based systems" — US medium-range fighter bombers
capable of delivering nuclear warheads on Warsaw Pact
targets, the senior official said.
The United States intends to refuse to discuss anything
other than land-based tactical nuclear weapons in the
early stages of the negotiations.
It was also disclosed that Gromyko told Haig that the
Soviets want to separate the talks on tactical nuclear
weapons from the larger framework of strategic arms
talks with which they had traditionally been associated.
In addition, the officials speculate that the Soviets
want to block any US move to turn aside a Soviet demand
in the tactical nuclear force talks with a claim that the is
sue should properly be reserved for strategic arms talks.
