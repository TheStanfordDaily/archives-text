# Diablo Canyon design flaws found

San Luis Obispo â€” Design flaws at
the Diablo Canvon nuclear power
plant which affect its ability to
withstand earthquakes could delay
fuel loading at its Unit One for "sev
eral weeks, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
officials said yesterday.
Utility engineers should know by
Friday the extent of modifications
needed on the unit's five seismic
pipe supports, which were built to
specifications for Unit Two because
of a diagram mix-up, PG&E spokes
man Greg Pruett said.
Piping support systems in the two
domes were to have been identical

except on opposite sides, "like a mir
ror image," and except for differing
amounts of stress they coula
withstand, Pruett said. Although the
pipes themselves were correctly
placed, expected stress levels In Unit
Two were the criteria used for Unit
One.
"The frames are 180 degrees op
posite to the design specifications to
which they were built," Pruett said.
"Our engineers are working around
the clock to complete an analysis. We
think we should have a pretty good
handle on the problem and wnat it
takes to correct it by the end of this
week."

The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission, in a staff report issued
Wednesday in Washington, DC[ said
PG&E was checking whether wrong
diagrams were used on Unit Two,
which is still under construction. The
NRC analysis also showed four sys
tems to keep Unit One's reactor from
overheating could be affected by the
mistake.
The $2.3 billion seaside plant,
which the NRC licensed Sept. 21 for
low-power testing, was the site of a
two-week anti-nuclear protest by the
Abalone Alliance which generated
