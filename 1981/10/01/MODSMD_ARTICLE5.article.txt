# LOTS expands computer facilities
## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
With the start of fall quarter, many students here
are signing up for introductory computer courses to
get acquainted with the Stanford's Low Overhead
Time Sharing (LOTS) computer system and the Center
for Information and Technology (CIT) facilities.
Mastery of the computer skills taught in these
classes can help students in text processing, statistical
analysis and information retrieval. But LOTS users in
the past have complained that long lines, over
subscription, illegal multiple accounts and system
failures have cut on their account time.
Last year an effort was made to eliminate these
problems from the computer science program. Ac
cording to Bob Knight, LOTS manager, spring quarter
was "markedly better" than winter quarter due to the
installation of another computer (borrowed from the
Business School) and the transfer of some LOTS
classes to the CIT]
According to Ralph Gorin. chair of the Computer
Science department, the idea of using CIT is ex
perimental in nature. "The purpose," he said, "is to
obtain information about what to do when the Busi
ness School gets back their computer." If the CIT facil
ities prove up to the task, LOTS may not need to
purchase a new machine to replace the one on loan.
Classes being put on CIT are Computer Science 107
and part of CS 106, both intorductory classes. Al
though the department is not yet sure of ClT's
feasibility for classes, Gorin said that the machines

have passed "some simple tests." He added that most
of the program used in the classes can be run on any
system ana expressed confidence that the computer
situation has been improved and will remain so. "I'm
optimistic that we will get through fall without the
long lines and queues of last winter," he said.
Part of the original overcrowding was due to the
opening of illegaladditional accounts by students us
ing their friends' names. Knight said he considers 'Ms
practice a "violation of the honor code," and saia ne
will handle the situation accordingly.
Some undergraduates complained last year that
grad students seemed to have preferential treatment
in access to the facilities. Knight disagrees strongly
with this charge.
"We don't discourage anyone from using the facil
ities," he said. "The perception of some students is in
correct. Undergrads and grads are all students, after
all."
Excessive computer downtime was another prob
lem that led to student frustration last year. But Knight
thinks that the system is better prepared now. "I don't
anticipate any problems in that area," he said. "We
have a record of 97 percent up time for the system."
The answer to whether the efficiency problems of
LOTS are really over will ultimately come from the
students. So far, LOTS account holders seem to be
warily endorsing the new guidelines. "It's working,
but I'm afraid it's a temporary solution," said one ac
count holder. "The true test will be how long it lasts "
