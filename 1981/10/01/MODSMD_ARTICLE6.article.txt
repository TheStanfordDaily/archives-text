# ASSU airport limo begins
## 
### Elizabeth Sweigert 
Responding to a survey of student
needs conducted earlier this year,
the ASSU began an airport limousine
service at the end of summer quarter.
The limousine service will function
mainly at the beginning and end of
each quarter, making regularly
scheduled runs every hour. Limos
will depart from spots throughout
the Stanford campus and the sur
rounding area. The limousines are
also available as charters for large
groups during the school year.
An ASSU-sponsored survey at the
end of last spring quarter initiated
the idea of the service. The survey,
mailed to approximately 500 stu
dents, asked participants to rate the
services they would most like to see.
Responses placed airport limousine
service fourth. •
According to Andy Midler, assis
tant ASSU Financial manager, "The
service is to combat a high fee from
existing companies." Existing airport
limousines charge $20 to pick up stu
dents at dorrrjs and $8 for a ride from
Hoover Tower. The ASSU is charging
$5 per run. The ASSU expects either
to Dreak even or make a small profit
from the service.
"All our services are provided on a
break-even basis," said Council of
Presidents member Chris Greene,
"and this service is one more thing to
provide to the community.
One-quarter of the summer stu
dents used the limousine service, ac
cording to Greene. The ASSU ex
pects to serve at least 2000 students at
the end of this quarter. The Service
will also be available to faculty and to
student families.
In addition to the airport limousine
service, the ASSU plans to extend the
Marguerite bus lines this year. The
bus Tine may run to more spots off
campus — to the Southern Pacificde
pot, for example. At present, the
Marguerite runs no further than the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Other ASSU plans for 1981-82 in
clude a change in the present linen
service. Under the new plan students
would have the chance to purchase
high quality sheets for low prices at
the beginning of each quarter in
stead of the linen rental system.
The ASSU also has plans to estab
lish snack bars in dorms. The snack
bars would run during peak studying
hours, said Greene.
The ASSU hopes to set up a snack
bar in a single dorm to begin with, he
said. The snack bar would function in
cooperation with the dorm. This
project will take effect upon agree
ment from residential management,
the Office of Residential Education
and Tresidder Union, said Greene.
