## Photocopying limited in USSR 
### 
Moscow (AP) — If, as the
saying goes, two men and a
printing press can make a revo
lution, what can one man and a
copying machine do?
In the Soviet Union, where
the distribution of information
is tightly controlled by the gov
ernment, the number of
photocopying machines is lim
ited and access to them closely
guarded.
Westerners here estimate
there are fewer than 20,000
copiers in the Soviet Union —
about two percent of the
worldwide total — and the
number is not expected to im
prove soon.
Those machines that are
here are off-limits, often
locked up in special rooms, ac
cording to Soviet sources.
Soviet citizens say that to
copy papers at their jobs, they
usually need permission from
three people: an immediate
supervisor, that person's boss
and an official of the organiza
tion's security surveillance ap
paratus. Then, someone else
does the actual copying.
Even senior Soviet officials
apparently have difficulty get
ting quick access to the ma
chines.
Business problems
Foreign businessmen in
Moscow say they sometimes
have had to interrupt nego
tiations at Soviet government
foreign trade departments and
return to their own offices to
duplicate contracts, after Sovi
et officials told them without
explanation that the docu
ments could not be copied
there.
Nevertheless, the Soviet gov
ernment may not be able to
control the flow of information
as closely as it would like. The
copying of materials for per
sonal use is said to be wide
spread, satisfying the intellec
tuaJ hunger of the intelligentsia
— not to mention a craving for
more money among copying
machine operators.
Access to copying machines,
like access to many goods in
short supply here, apparently
depends-largely on whom one
knows.'One Soviet said recent
ly, "The best way to get some
thing copied is by having a
friend whose job it is to copy
things."
Secret publishing
With such friends, Russians
sometimes get to read books
and articles the government
regards as politically unaccep
table, or those simply in short
supply. That is no small advan
tage in a country where all
printed materials are censored
for political content, and the
worksof even politically accep
table Russian writers such as
Leo Tolstoy and the beloved
poet Alexander Pushkin are
chronically hard to find in gov
ernment-run bookstores.
It is said by Russians to cost as
much as 25 rubles (aboui $33
and about 15 percent of the av
erage Russian's monthly salary)
to have a book reproduced in
Moscow by a copying machine
operator, unofficially working
for himself. But business is ap
parently flourishing.
Underground Soviet re
ligious groups use copying ma
chines and underground print
shops to distribute their liter
ature, and Russians say several
copies of works by exiled au
thor Alexander Solzhenitsyn
and other out-of-favor writers
have been made and passed
among dissidents and intellec
tuals.
