# Solidarity bringing life to Poland
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Gdansk, Poland — Tadeusz
Izycki, a retired lawyer, stood
in a plaza outside the Olivia
Sports Palace here and wit
nessed something that, for
him, was still astonishing even
after more than a year of epic
social change in his homeland.
Unable to get inside the hall,
where Poland's free trade
union federation, Solidarity,
was holding its first national
congress, Izycki and thousands
of others nonetheless could
hear the proceedings over
loudspeakers strategically lo
cated around the square.
In a part of the world where
the only thing normally broad
cast over loudspeakers is gov
ernment propaganda, that was
unusual enough. But what
these ordinary citizens heard
was even more astonishing —
delegates openly debating the
conditions of life in Poland
and, occasionally, condemning
the "totalitarian system in our

country."
They lined up to buy un
censored books and literature
sold from cars in a nearby park
ing lot. And they milled around
a truck festooned with political
cartoons as biting as any to be
found on the editorial pages of
an American newspaper.
"I can compare it only to the
period just after World War l[
when Poland was just coming
into existence" after being
partitioned into oblivion 123
years earlier, the 81-year-old
Izycki said. "Then as well as
now it was a time in which the
future of Poland was being de
termined."
It's undoubtedly because the
stakes are so high that, despite
its occasional surface similarity
to American political conven
tion, the mood here is almost
reverent. The crowds on the
plaza outside have been almost
eerily quiet and well
They listen politely, applaud

ing sometimes, and shaking
their heads if they disagree
with a speaker inside. But no
one in the plaza raises his
voice.
One American here sug
gested that this might be the
closest she will ever get to un
derstanding the atmosphere in
Philadelphia when America's
founding fathers hammered
out a constitution.
Heady new freedoms
Conversations with ordinary
Poles here indicate that they
are finding their new-found
freedom a heady experience,
but a sometimes frightening
and frustrating one as well, one
that allowed a nationwide
movementof 10million people
to spring up almost overnight.
Zofia Szymczak is a retired
seamstress from Gdansk. She
has been sitting outside Olivia
Hall all day, every day. "After
World War II I started working
and tried to help build up Po

land from rums," she said. "I
worked very hard. For many
years I worked on the night
shift. And now I have to spend
nights waiting in lines to get a
chance to buy meat. I hope that
life for the next generation will
be better. That's why I support
Solidarity and hope that it will
achieve something, that it will
help the people."
"In my opinion," Szymczak
added, "if the government will
interfere with Solidarity in their
actions, the situation will be
very difficult. But I presume
that if the actions of Solidarity
are not disturbed by the gov
ernment, things will improve
very fast."
Wojciech Koziel, a 33-year
old computer specialist,
stopped by the congress on a
Sunday outing with his wife. He
is a Solidarity member and says
"almost 99 percent" of the 400
people that work in his or
ganization are, too.
"For the first time in 36 years,
the people in Poland became a
little bit free," he said.
Finding out the truth
Ewa Matlak, 24, just gradu
ated from medical school. She
came to Olivia Hall because
she wants to know more about
Solidarity. "I want to witness
the debate because I don't
trust the mass media," she said.
"When I know really what Soli
darity means I will decide
whether to join it or not." She
added that opinion among her
friends is divided, although the
majority supports the union.
As for the exercise in de
mocracy that the congress rep
resents, she said, "I've never
seen anything like this. Until
August of last year (when Soli
darity began emerging out of
nationwide strikes) such a
thing never happened."
Zdzislaw Rydzik, also 24, is a
mechanic for the state auto
sales and service organization
and a Solidarity member.
Asked if he is ever frightened
that this social revolution will
blow up in the country's face,
he replied; "No. We are too
powerful for anyone to threat
en us."
And what of the future? "The
future will be determined by
both sides," said the lawyer,
Tadeusz Izycki. "It is necessary
for both sides to step back and
find a compromise."
Most of all, Izycki said, "we
must keep alive what hap
pened last August at any price,
and never allow any confronta
tion."

WALESA COMPROMISES -■Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sits with General Boruta-Spichowicz
after the general addressed the Solidarity convention Sunday. Walesa this week defended leaders
of the union before the convention members, but later was reprimanded for compromising with
the Polish regime in agreeing to joint Solidarity-Communist party appointments of factory man
agers, instead of pushing for the union autonomy.
