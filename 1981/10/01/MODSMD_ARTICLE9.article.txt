# Honduran raid rattles US policy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tegucigalpa, Honduras —
The US soldiers who were
caught in a terrorist attack
last week in this country
were reportedly following a
route and a schedule that
had become well estab
lished. All of the soldiers
were in uniform, although
no one in their car was carry
ing a weapon. Two were
wounded.
These procedures made
the servicemen an easy
target for ambush, and a
fundamental reassessment
of security plans by the US
military and diplomatic mis
sion here is under way.
"We just got sloppy," one
embassy official said.
The group that claimed
responsibility for the ma
chine-gun attack last week
blamed increased US sup
port for the country's mili
tary leaders, and it promised
further violent actions.
Attack a suprise
Lax security may have
been a factor in the inci
dent, but a lack of prece
dent for attacks on Ameri
cans and the absence of a
genuine terrorist move
ment in Honduras had
created a relaxed political
climate.
Unlike neighboring
countries such as El Salvador
and Guatemala, Honduras
does not have a history of
harsh military repression.
Corrupt military dic
tatorships that tolerate a
measure of dissent are more
the style here.
Nevertheless, the attack
raises the question of
whether the violence that is
sweeping Central America
will engulf Honduras and
expand the American mili
tary role.
In a news conference the
day afterward, US Am
bassador Jack Binns scoffed
at the notion thatthe United
States is urging Honduras to
become the policeman of
Central America, as some
have said.
In fiscal year 1981, which
ended yesterday, US mili
tary aid under the foreign
military sales program —
basically a loan at close to
the prevailing interest rates
— had been set at $5 million.
Then, in August, the Reagan
administration increased
the amount by $3.4 million.
The military buildup by
the revolutionary govern
ment of neighboring

Nicaragua is one of the prin
cipal reasons the Honduran
armed forces have sought
more weapons.
US weapons leased
In 1980, the Pentagon
leased 10 helicopters to
Honduras on a cost-free
basis for two years. That
lease has been extended for
three years, until 1985.
The United States also
provided $540,000 to Hon
duras under a military
education and training pro
gram. That amount will in
crease to $700,000 in fiscal
1982.
Under this program, the
United States has been
sending in American ser
vicemen, such as those
caught in last week's am
bush, for periods ranging
from one week to four
months, according to Binns.
The number of US ser
vicemen in the country un
der the education and train
ing program this year has
not exceeded 27, other em
bassy spokesmen said.
According to the am
bassador, the servicemen
were involved in a variety of
jobs. Three were teaching
helicopter maintenance, six
were teaching tactics in
Honduras' 12 army bat
talions, three were involved
in improving air-to-ground
communications and two
were coordinating the vari
ous programs.
Naval exercises
Binns rejected statements
by Nicaraguan officials and
the terrorists who carried
out last week's attack that
scheduled naval maneuvers
by the US and Honduran
forces were an implied
threat to Nicaragua.
The maneuvers, code
named Falcon View 81, will
involve three US Navy pa
trol boats and two observer
airplanes working with
three Honduran patrol
boats and several aircraft,
Binnssaid.Thetotal number
of US servicemen involved
in the "simulated ocean
search and interdiction op
erations" will be 130.
At the same time, he said,
security procedures will be
tightened, but the protec
tion of servicemen in the
training program will re
main the responsibility of
the Honduran government
and American servicemen
will continue to go un
armed.
