# How Do You Spell Respect?
## The 						Prime Cuts of T-Bone Burnett 
### DANN SEAY 
I teel like I deserve a little more respect
than Ive gotten so far. observes lanky
T-Bone Burnett, resting between mix
down sessions for an upcoming Maria
Muldaur album he is producing. Rough,
herringboned cedar strips slapped across
the walls make the claustrophobic
Paramount studio look like it can't decide
between being a liquor store or a sauna. A
large contact paper mural of the rugged
Sierra Nevada Mountains defaces one wall.
Burnett may be excused his wistful sen
timent there are tew such living legends
in pop music as this 6'B" Texas-raised
guitarist, writer, performer, laconic wit
and homespun philosopher. Certainlv
there are few nicknamed like a cut of
beef.
Actually. T-Bone (born Joseph Henry)
drey, his nickname from the tall, spare
frame inherited from his ex-Brooklyn
Dodgers father His list of friends from
nearK twenty years in music — ranging
from Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dvlan to
actor John Hun and prophesy pundit Hal
Lindsey — is enormous. His sunglasses,
which he often wears into the dead of
night, are impenetrable. The idea of mak
ing music for a living came to me in a
nightmare, he reveals through a wry grin,
leaning forward on crossed forearms that
rest on his knees
Burnett's earliest musical memories in
volve sneaking into Fort Worth. Texas bars
to hear Delbert McClinton accompany
strippers on harmonica. The two struck up
a friendship that years later led to Burnett
co-producing McClinton s first album.
I formed a group called Loose Ends
with Steve Bruton. who plays guitar for
Kristofferson now and some other guvs
who sooner or later got smart and became
lawyers.' Burnett recalls "We played
around Texas. Oklahoma and Louisiana
until 1 got tired and bought a studio in
Hon Worth on borrowed monev.'
Sound City quickly became the site for

some of Texas" more bizarre musical fan
tasies. including a deranged underground
masterpiece called "Paralized" by The
Legendary Stardust Cowboy
The guy showed up one day," recalls
Burnett, "in a 63 green Biscavne with a
surface map of the moon on the roof. I
knew I had something."
Well, not quite. Burnett eventually sold
Sound City and became a prototype bi
coastal, migrating from New York to LA.
and back through a rather blurry mid-
Sixties He recorded a single for Frank

B- 52 Bcitui &. The Fabulous Sky larks) that

Burnett also met musicians Steven Soles
and David Mansfield on that tour. They
formed the Alpha Band, a crack trio that,
some hoped, would be the force in Amer
ican music that the Band had been a few
years earlier A critical rave, they never
cracked the essential -.ingles market; the
Alpha Band lasted through three albums.
Burnett converted to Christianity mid-wav
through the group's career "The Alpha
Band took a real toll on my fantasy life,'
Burnett says, indicating that he discovered
pop stardom showed itself to be an un
worthy goal.
His new religious convictions found
their way eventually into his music, but
prior to recording as a solo he was
whisked away to the wilds of Kalispell.
Montana to play a blindingh short part in
Michael Cimino's famous Waterloo,
Heaven's Gate For a screen time of about
six seconds in a movie practically no one
wants to see, Burnett logged eight months
on the set. Limping home early in 1980, he
cut his strongest and most influential
album yet. Truth Decay Understated vet

with the blues. Truth Decay was promi

The funny thing is," Burnett reflects,

me. Its respect. And, finally, doing what
you want to do ... what you have no
choice but to do."
A little shy about performing, Burnett

lywood Foreign Legion Hall to showcase
some new material for a small audience of
press, friends and industry wheels. A new
LP is mostly finished, as is an intriguing

of Hooray for Hollywood" that actually
makes one listen to the melody, rather
than the bombast, of that funny old
warhorse. Soon after the Muldaur produc

with Ry Cooder — yet another long-time
friend from the ranks of the famous and
near famous Perhaps his extra measure of
respect is almost at hand.
