Universal Studios crams more tourists
through its Universal City Studios Tour
than Portugal crams sardines into tin
cans, and on hot, smoggy days the
marks' bake in the San Fernando Val
ley sun until the sweat pours off them
like so much olive oil. The Big Stop on
the tour is the new special effects
sound stage which promises to show
the curious just how George Lucas
made Star Wars and Dino Dc Lauren
tiis got King Kong to swing. Nine dol
lars and fifty cents a head is the going
price for such information.
John Landis, director of Animal
House, the highest grossing comedy of
all time, runs into these tours
ever,time he steps from his office It's
a small, semi-crumbling bungalow that
does not begin to suggest the riches
this man has brought to Universal via
Aturruil House and the Blues Brx>tbers
(yes, Virginia, the Blues Brothers did
make money despite its $31 million
budget). The office has plywood stairs
and dingy walls and backs into the
parking lot, where the studio tour
buses light to herd the curious, sweat
ing crowds into that special effects
sound stage If Landis opened his win
dows, he'd hear the forced good-cheer
of the tour guides as they make their
dictatorial statements ("you must re
turn to the exact seat you have va
cated") sound like suggestions But
then, if Landis opened his windows,
the tourists wouldn't be listening to
their guides — they'd be listening to
Landis.
Landis, at 31, is best distinguished
from the rest of the crop of hotshot
contemporary-under-thirty-five di
rectors by hLs voice Where others are
shy, Landis is effusive; where others
are quiet, Landis is outrageous. He
doesn't speak per se — he yells, he
shouts, he rants, he raves It's a voice
cultivated for the New York subway
system, but John Landis has never
lived East of the Mississippi
A week before his new film, An
.\merican Werewolf in London, Is set
to open, Landis is saving his voice for
the press. Alfred Hitchcock once told
him the press is moronic, and Landis
couldn't agree more. Proof of that
assessment is the fact that the Los
Angeles Times has printed not one, but
four different pictures of what the
newspaper insists is the monster, the
"werewolf.' Landis' press releases had
told everyone that no pictures of the
werewolf exist and in fact during pro
duction crew members were warned
that anyone leaking information on the
werewolf would be shot. Now the
Times has come up with some pictures
from the movie and printed them with
finger-pointing glee is if to say, "See,
John, you can't keep anything hidden
from as."
Landis, his voice reaching new
heights, wants to know why. What was
the point? "Is this news?" he asks.

Printing stolen photographs. Illegal
photographs. We checked, they didn t
get them from any kosher sources."
When pressed for reasons. Landis in
sists the whole thing is personal. He's
certain one of the newspaper's editors
is out to get him because this editor
has a wife who happens to be an ac
tress whom Landis has happened
never to hire for any of his movies.
Landis says he's being paid back. "I
mean," he adds incredulously, "what
else could it be?"
Fouling up the secrecy on .\ti Amer
ican Werewolf is nothing new The
movie Is about two American college
students (played by David Naughton of
the "Dr. Pepper" commercials and
Griffin Dunne) who are attacked in
Northern England by a creature from
beyond the grave Werewolf was sup
posed to contain a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects.
However, earlier this year a low
budget exploitation film called The
Howling was released — lo and be
hold, it contained a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects. In
fact, The Howling s was so brilliant, it
never failed to elicit applause from the
movie's audiences.
The similarity between the two
movies' transformations is not coinci
dental. Each was nursed into being by
a 31-year-old special make-up and ef
fects creator named Rick Baker. "What
made me upset," Landis said, was that
Rick gave away some of our secrets on
how to do this thing That made me
mad Rob Bottin who did The Howling
was actually Baker s assistant. Rick in
fact started The Howling and 1 called
him up and said. Rick, remember I'm
making that movie, remember we dis
cussed it in 1971, well I'm making it
now,' and he said, Yeah, you told me
that before' and I said, Well, this time
I really mean it.' So Rick quit The
Howling and Rob took the job instead
"I haven't seen it yet, but Bottin is
real gifted and I'm a big fan of Joe
Dante's (director). But I've read their
script and the two films are very dif
ferent in conception Theirs is real
tongue-in-cheek and ours is decidedly
serious. It's very funny, but it's not a
comedy We never make excuses for
the story, we're never winking at it. It's
straightforward and tragic ."
Landis says he was inspired to write
Werewolf by an incident he encoun
tered in Yugoslavia back in 1969 when
he was a 19-year-old flunky on a movie
called Kelly's Heroes While traveling
from a location he got stuck in a traffic
jam, "which is unusual since there
were only about 300 cars in the whole
country. Anyway, right in the middle of
this crossroads was a burial with two
priests and a corpse wrapped in canvas
and covered with garlic and rosaries. I
said what the f..k is this? Our driver,

an educated man from Belgrade, went
to find out and came back laughing at
the peasants and gypsies. He thought it
was real funny. It seems this dead guy
had been a rapist and was shot and he
was being buried in the crossroads so
he wouldn't get up and cause trouble.
"1 was genuinely impressed by what
I saw The people were absolutely se
rious. I don't belive in that stuff .he
says, pausing for the right phrase, "but
I don't disbelieve anything either.
What these guys were doing in Yugcv
slavia wasn't any sillier than anything
they do in the Mormon Church or in
the Judaic-Christian beliefs. You can
ridicule anything if you want to. But
kx>k at Voodoo It's consistently prac
ticed and it works Papa Doc ruled a
country with it It kills people.
"In WereuxAf we're talking about the
suspension of disbelief. And it's hard.
When you put a maniac with an axe in
his hand, you believe it because stran
gers are walking around shooting John
Lennon. So no problem, you say
there's a man with an axe, fine ... Or
go into outer space . , again, no prob
lem, you go with whatever you have.
But in a contemporary setting with
monsters, it's a whole different thing.
For instance, W)e Exorcist, which I be
lieve is a great movie, has a tremen
dous advantage in that it's about Christ
and Satan which gives us two thousand
years on which we build our suspen
sion of disbelief. You know the rules.
Christ is good and Satan is bad. Just
like you hold a cross to a vampire and
he cringes, you don't have to be told
why. It's good and evil. No sweat. But
my movie's not about good and evil,
it's about the ultimate schizophrenia."
Landis himself may know a little
something about split personalities.
Those who know him, have worked
with him, invariably describe him as
two different men. One is impossible,

infantile, egotistical; the other is
charming, funny and hright. Eyes roll
heavenward when his name is men
tioned. One producer who worked
closely with landis on a now defunct
project first has praise for the man and
then adds derisively, "He has an office
full of toys. Steven Spielberg gets the
toys designated for kids eight to eleven
— Landis gets the ones marked three
to seven.'' Actually there are no toys in
Landis' office, only a Mickey Mouse
figure, several signed movie posters
and a half-dozen copies of Staring and
Monster magazine.
It's easy to see why Landis elicits
such diverse reactions. He's nothing if
not opinionated. Why doesn't Jenny
Agutter, who's so gtxxl in Werewolf,
work more in Hollywood? "Because
producers here aren't looking for
beautiful, intelligent women, they're
looking for bimbos." What's the hard
est emotion to get out of a movie?
Wonderment. Spielberg did that with
the first version of Close Encounters.
You open your mouth in wonder Very
few movies do that. The first King
Kong Pinocchio, maybe the Wizard of
Oz " Star Wars? "Star Wars failed mis
erably at it. It's exciting, ya ya ya, but it
doesn't have a sense of wonder." The
press' reaction to big budget movies?
"The press is full of s-t. Blues Brothers
was never overbudgeted. We became
1942 Everyone hated us because we
were young and tot) successful. Look
what they did to Spielberg after 1941 I
mean, what was his crime? Making a
movie that didn't work." Is the current
crop of hot-shot directors ever com
petitive with one another? "Never —
what an odd question."
He is equally sanguine about the
impact of his movies. He says Anitvat
House was a breakthrough film and
that 11 universities wouldn't let them
sh(x>t on campus because the film had

a teacher sleeping with a student
'They said it never happened. Hell,
that's the reason most people become
teachers. Animal House is a political
film because at the height of born
again Christianity we made a film
about born-again paganism. Toga
Parties.
"Look at the end of Animal House
and look at Stripes Stripes is vers
funny, but it's totally reactionary. Its a
fascist film. 1 was appalled when I saw
it. That movie says the Army is great
and supports the military establish
ment. I don't think those who make it
know what it said and I'm sure they re
going to think my response is out of
line. But things are crazy. Do you
know people in this country thought
Pvt. Benjamin was a women's lib film'
Forget it.
"You have a responsibility when you
make films."
But Landis won't elaborate on the
political impact of movies except to
say you have to make them with sub
versive messages "Your first responsi
bility is to entertain, but what I m
proudest of is where my films are
banned—Argentina, Iran, South Africa.
It's terrific. You can always tell il your
film is correct by the countries in
which it's banned."
One of Landis's next projects will be
a movie of Mark Twain's A Coftnectic M
Yankee in Kitty Arthurs Court (which
Jenny Agutter reads to David Naughton
in Winn'olf). The script is being writ
ten by Oscar-winning, one-time black
listed Waldo Salt. Waldo has a lot
of anger in him," Landis says, and
so did Twain. Twain's my hero He
was a bitter, cynical, nasty li"' l '
guy. Twain's facinating. Huckleberry
/•'inn is the greatest American novel
ever written."
It's said you can tell something
about a man by the heroes he keeps

John Landis, director of Animal

a small, semi-crumbling bungalow that
does not begin to suggest the riches
this man has brought to Universal via

parking lot, where the studio tour

dows, he'd hear the forced good-cheer
of the tour guides as they make their
dictatorial statements ("you must re
turn to the exact seat you have va
cated") sound like suggestions But
then, if Landis opened his windows,
the tourists wouldn't be listening to
their guides — they'd be listening to
Landis.
Landis, at 31, is best distinguished
from the rest of the crop of hotshot
contemporary-under-thirty-five di
rectors by hLs voice Where others are
shy, Landis is effusive; where others
are quiet, Landis is outrageous. He
doesn't speak per se — he yells, he
shouts, he rants, he raves It's a voice
cultivated for the New York subway
system, but John Landis has never
lived East of the Mississippi
A week before his new film, An
.\merican Werewolf in London, Is set
to open, Landis is saving his voice for
the press. Alfred Hitchcock once told
him the press is moronic, and Landis
couldn't agree more. Proof of that
assessment is the fact that the Los
Angeles Times has printed not one, but
four different pictures of what the
newspaper insists is the monster, the
"werewolf.' Landis' press releases had
told everyone that no pictures of the
werewolf exist and in fact during pro
duction crew members were warned
that anyone leaking information on the
werewolf would be shot. Now the
Times has come up with some pictures
from the movie and printed them with
finger-pointing glee is if to say, "See,
John, you can't keep anything hidden
from as."
Landis, his voice reaching new
heights, wants to know why. What was
the point? "Is this news?" he asks.

Printing stolen photographs. Illegal
photographs. We checked, they didn t
get them from any kosher sources."
When pressed for reasons. Landis in
sists the whole thing is personal. He's
certain one of the newspaper's editors
is out to get him because this editor
has a wife who happens to be an ac
tress whom Landis has happened
never to hire for any of his movies.
Landis says he's being paid back. "I
mean," he adds incredulously, "what
else could it be?"
Fouling up the secrecy on .\ti Amer
ican Werewolf is nothing new The
movie Is about two American college
students (played by David Naughton of
the "Dr. Pepper" commercials and
Griffin Dunne) who are attacked in
Northern England by a creature from
beyond the grave Werewolf was sup
posed to contain a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects.
However, earlier this year a low
budget exploitation film called The
Howling was released — lo and be
hold, it contained a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects. In
fact, The Howling s was so brilliant, it
never failed to elicit applause from the
movie's audiences.
The similarity between the two
movies' transformations is not coinci
dental. Each was nursed into being by
a 31-year-old special make-up and ef
fects creator named Rick Baker. "What
made me upset," Landis said, was that
Rick gave away some of our secrets on
how to do this thing That made me
mad Rob Bottin who did The Howling
was actually Baker s assistant. Rick in
fact started The Howling and 1 called
him up and said. Rick, remember I'm
making that movie, remember we dis
cussed it in 1971, well I'm making it
now,' and he said, Yeah, you told me
that before' and I said, Well, this time
I really mean it.' So Rick quit The
Howling and Rob took the job instead
"I haven't seen it yet, but Bottin is
real gifted and I'm a big fan of Joe
Dante's (director). But I've read their
script and the two films are very dif
ferent in conception Theirs is real
tongue-in-cheek and ours is decidedly
serious. It's very funny, but it's not a
comedy We never make excuses for
the story, we're never winking at it. It's
straightforward and tragic ."
Landis says he was inspired to write
Werewolf by an incident he encoun
tered in Yugoslavia back in 1969 when
he was a 19-year-old flunky on a movie
called Kelly's Heroes While traveling
from a location he got stuck in a traffic
jam, "which is unusual since there
were only about 300 cars in the whole
country. Anyway, right in the middle of
this crossroads was a burial with two
priests and a corpse wrapped in canvas
and covered with garlic and rosaries. I
said what the f..k is this? Our driver,

an educated man from Belgrade, went
to find out and came back laughing at
the peasants and gypsies. He thought it
was real funny. It seems this dead guy
had been a rapist and was shot and he
was being buried in the crossroads so
he wouldn't get up and cause trouble.
"1 was genuinely impressed by what
I saw The people were absolutely se
rious. I don't belive in that stuff .he
says, pausing for the right phrase, "but
I don't disbelieve anything either.
What these guys were doing in Yugcv
slavia wasn't any sillier than anything
they do in the Mormon Church or in
the Judaic-Christian beliefs. You can
ridicule anything if you want to. But
kx>k at Voodoo It's consistently prac
ticed and it works Papa Doc ruled a
country with it It kills people.
"In WereuxAf we're talking about the
suspension of disbelief. And it's hard.
When you put a maniac with an axe in
his hand, you believe it because stran
gers are walking around shooting John
Lennon. So no problem, you say
there's a man with an axe, fine ... Or
go into outer space . , again, no prob
lem, you go with whatever you have.
But in a contemporary setting with
monsters, it's a whole different thing.
For instance, W)e Exorcist, which I be
lieve is a great movie, has a tremen
dous advantage in that it's about Christ
and Satan which gives us two thousand
years on which we build our suspen
sion of disbelief. You know the rules.
Christ is good and Satan is bad. Just
like you hold a cross to a vampire and
he cringes, you don't have to be told
why. It's good and evil. No sweat. But
my movie's not about good and evil,
it's about the ultimate schizophrenia."
Landis himself may know a little
something about split personalities.
Those who know him, have worked
with him, invariably describe him as
two different men. One is impossible,

infantile, egotistical; the other is
charming, funny and hright. Eyes roll
heavenward when his name is men
tioned. One producer who worked
closely with landis on a now defunct
project first has praise for the man and
then adds derisively, "He has an office

Landis says he was inspired to write
Werewolf by an incident he encoun
tered in Yugoslavia back in 1969 when
he was a 19-year-old flunky on a movie
called Kelly's Heroes While traveling
from a location he got stuck in a traffic
jam, "which is unusual since there
were only about 300 cars in the whole

Landis himself may know a little
something about split personalities.
Those who know him, have worked
with him, invariably describe him as
two different men. One is impossible,

infantile, egotistical; the other is
charming, funny and hright. Eyes roll
heavenward when his name is men
tioned. One producer who worked
closely with landis on a now defunct
project first has praise for the man and
then adds derisively, "He has an office

toys designated for kids eight to eleven
— Landis gets the ones marked three
to seven.'' Actually there are no toys in
Landis' office, only a Mickey Mouse
figure, several signed movie posters
and a half-dozen copies of Staring and
Monster magazine.
It's easy to see why Landis elicits
such diverse reactions. He's nothing if
not opinionated. Why doesn't Jenny
Agutter, who's so gtxxl in Werewolf,
work more in Hollywood? "Because
producers here aren't looking for
beautiful, intelligent women, they're
looking for bimbos." What's the hard

Universal Studios crams more tourists
through its Universal City Studios Tour
than Portugal crams sardines into tin
cans, and on hot, smoggy days the
marks' bake in the San Fernando Val
ley sun until the sweat pours off them
like so much olive oil. The Big Stop on
the tour is the new special effects
sound stage which promises to show
the curious just how George Lucas
made Star Wars and Dino Dc Lauren
tiis got King Kong to swing. Nine dol
lars and fifty cents a head is the going
price for such information.
John Landis, director of Animal
House, the highest grossing comedy of
all time, runs into these tours
ever,time he steps from his office It's
a small, semi-crumbling bungalow that
does not begin to suggest the riches
this man has brought to Universal via
Aturruil House and the Blues Brx>tbers
(yes, Virginia, the Blues Brothers did
make money despite its $31 million
budget). The office has plywood stairs
and dingy walls and backs into the
parking lot, where the studio tour
buses light to herd the curious, sweat
ing crowds into that special effects
sound stage If Landis opened his win
dows, he'd hear the forced good-cheer
of the tour guides as they make their
dictatorial statements ("you must re
turn to the exact seat you have va
cated") sound like suggestions But
then, if Landis opened his windows,
the tourists wouldn't be listening to
their guides — they'd be listening to
Landis.
Landis, at 31, is best distinguished
from the rest of the crop of hotshot
contemporary-under-thirty-five di
rectors by hLs voice Where others are
shy, Landis is effusive; where others
are quiet, Landis is outrageous. He
doesn't speak per se — he yells, he
shouts, he rants, he raves It's a voice
cultivated for the New York subway
system, but John Landis has never
lived East of the Mississippi
A week before his new film, An
.\merican Werewolf in London, Is set
to open, Landis is saving his voice for
the press. Alfred Hitchcock once told
him the press is moronic, and Landis
couldn't agree more. Proof of that
assessment is the fact that the Los
Angeles Times has printed not one, but
four different pictures of what the
newspaper insists is the monster, the
"werewolf.' Landis' press releases had
told everyone that no pictures of the
werewolf exist and in fact during pro
duction crew members were warned
that anyone leaking information on the
werewolf would be shot. Now the
Times has come up with some pictures
from the movie and printed them with
finger-pointing glee is if to say, "See,
John, you can't keep anything hidden
from as."
Landis, his voice reaching new
heights, wants to know why. What was
the point? "Is this news?" he asks.

Printing stolen photographs. Illegal
photographs. We checked, they didn t
get them from any kosher sources."
When pressed for reasons. Landis in
sists the whole thing is personal. He's
certain one of the newspaper's editors
is out to get him because this editor
has a wife who happens to be an ac
tress whom Landis has happened
never to hire for any of his movies.
Landis says he's being paid back. "I
mean," he adds incredulously, "what
else could it be?"
Fouling up the secrecy on .\ti Amer
ican Werewolf is nothing new The
movie Is about two American college
students (played by David Naughton of
the "Dr. Pepper" commercials and
Griffin Dunne) who are attacked in
Northern England by a creature from
beyond the grave Werewolf was sup
posed to contain a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects.
However, earlier this year a low
budget exploitation film called The
Howling was released — lo and be
hold, it contained a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects. In
fact, The Howling s was so brilliant, it
never failed to elicit applause from the
movie's audiences.
The similarity between the two
movies' transformations is not coinci
dental. Each was nursed into being by
a 31-year-old special make-up and ef
fects creator named Rick Baker. "What
made me upset," Landis said, was that
Rick gave away some of our secrets on
how to do this thing That made me
mad Rob Bottin who did The Howling
was actually Baker s assistant. Rick in
fact started The Howling and 1 called
him up and said. Rick, remember I'm

all time, runs into these tours
ever,time he steps from his office It's
a small, semi-crumbling bungalow that
does not begin to suggest the riches
this man has brought to Universal via
Aturruil House and the Blues Brx>tbers
(yes, Virginia, the Blues Brothers did
make money despite its $31 million
budget). The office has plywood stairs
and dingy walls and backs into the
parking lot, where the studio tour
buses light to herd the curious, sweat
ing crowds into that special effects
sound stage If Landis opened his win
dows, he'd hear the forced good-cheer
of the tour guides as they make their
dictatorial statements ("you must re
turn to the exact seat you have va
cated") sound like suggestions But
then, if Landis opened his windows,
the tourists wouldn't be listening to
their guides — they'd be listening to
Landis.
Landis, at 31, is best distinguished
from the rest of the crop of hotshot
contemporary-under-thirty-five di
rectors by hLs voice Where others are
shy, Landis is effusive; where others
are quiet, Landis is outrageous. He
doesn't speak per se — he yells, he
shouts, he rants, he raves It's a voice
cultivated for the New York subway
system, but John Landis has never
lived East of the Mississippi
A week before his new film, An
.\merican Werewolf in London, Is set
to open, Landis is saving his voice for
the press. Alfred Hitchcock once told
him the press is moronic, and Landis
couldn't agree more. Proof of that
assessment is the fact that the Los
Angeles Times has printed not one, but
four different pictures of what the
newspaper insists is the monster, the
"werewolf.' Landis' press releases had
told everyone that no pictures of the
werewolf exist and in fact during pro
duction crew members were warned
that anyone leaking information on the
werewolf would be shot. Now the
Times has come up with some pictures
from the movie and printed them with
finger-pointing glee is if to say, "See,
John, you can't keep anything hidden
from as."
Landis, his voice reaching new
heights, wants to know why. What was
the point? "Is this news?" he asks.

Printing stolen photographs. Illegal
photographs. We checked, they didn t
get them from any kosher sources."
When pressed for reasons. Landis in
sists the whole thing is personal. He's
certain one of the newspaper's editors
is out to get him because this editor
has a wife who happens to be an ac
tress whom Landis has happened
never to hire for any of his movies.
Landis says he's being paid back. "I
mean," he adds incredulously, "what
else could it be?"
Fouling up the secrecy on .\ti Amer
ican Werewolf is nothing new The
movie Is about two American college
students (played by David Naughton of
the "Dr. Pepper" commercials and
Griffin Dunne) who are attacked in
Northern England by a creature from
beyond the grave Werewolf was sup
posed to contain a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects.
However, earlier this year a low
budget exploitation film called The
Howling was released — lo and be
hold, it contained a never-before-seen
man-to-beast transformation that was
done totally without optical effects. In
fact, The Howling s was so brilliant, it
never failed to elicit applause from the
movie's audiences.
The similarity between the two
movies' transformations is not coinci
dental. Each was nursed into being by
a 31-year-old special make-up and ef
fects creator named Rick Baker. "What
made me upset," Landis said, was that
Rick gave away some of our secrets on
how to do this thing That made me
mad Rob Bottin who did The Howling
was actually Baker s assistant. Rick in
fact started The Howling and 1 called
him up and said. Rick, remember I'm
making that movie, remember we dis
cussed it in 1971, well I'm making it
now,' and he said, Yeah, you told me
that before' and I said, Well, this time
I really mean it.' So Rick quit The
Howling and Rob took the job instead
"I haven't seen it yet, but Bottin is
real gifted and I'm a big fan of Joe
Dante's (director). But I've read their
script and the two films are very dif
ferent in conception Theirs is real
tongue-in-cheek and ours is decidedly
serious. It's very funny, but it's not a
comedy We never make excuses for
the story, we're never winking at it. It's
straightforward and tragic ."
Landis says he was inspired to write
Werewolf by an incident he encoun
tered in Yugoslavia back in 1969 when
he was a 19-year-old flunky on a movie
called Kelly's Heroes While traveling
from a location he got stuck in a traffic
jam, "which is unusual since there
were only about 300 cars in the whole
country. Anyway, right in the middle of
this crossroads was a burial with two
priests and a corpse wrapped in canvas
and covered with garlic and rosaries. I
said what the f..k is this? Our driver,

an educated man from Belgrade, went
to find out and came back laughing at
the peasants and gypsies. He thought it
was real funny. It seems this dead guy
had been a rapist and was shot and he
was being buried in the crossroads so
he wouldn't get up and cause trouble.
"1 was genuinely impressed by what
I saw The people were absolutely se
rious. I don't belive in that stuff .he
says, pausing for the right phrase, "but
I don't disbelieve anything either.
What these guys were doing in Yugcv
slavia wasn't any sillier than anything
they do in the Mormon Church or in
the Judaic-Christian beliefs. You can
ridicule anything if you want to. But
kx>k at Voodoo It's consistently prac
ticed and it works Papa Doc ruled a
country with it It kills people.
"In WereuxAf we're talking about the
suspension of disbelief. And it's hard.
When you put a maniac with an axe in
his hand, you believe it because stran
gers are walking around shooting John
Lennon. So no problem, you say
there's a man with an axe, fine ... Or
go into outer space . , again, no prob
lem, you go with whatever you have.
But in a contemporary setting with
monsters, it's a whole different thing.
For instance, W)e Exorcist, which I be
lieve is a great movie, has a tremen
dous advantage in that it's about Christ
and Satan which gives us two thousand
years on which we build our suspen
sion of disbelief. You know the rules.
Christ is good and Satan is bad. Just
like you hold a cross to a vampire and
he cringes, you don't have to be told
why. It's good and evil. No sweat. But
my movie's not about good and evil,
it's about the ultimate schizophrenia."
Landis himself may know a little
something about split personalities.
Those who know him, have worked
with him, invariably describe him as
two different men. One is impossible,

infantile, egotistical; the other is
charming, funny and hright. Eyes roll
heavenward when his name is men
tioned. One producer who worked
closely with landis on a now defunct
project first has praise for the man and
then adds derisively, "He has an office
full of toys. Steven Spielberg gets the
toys designated for kids eight to eleven
— Landis gets the ones marked three
to seven.'' Actually there are no toys in
Landis' office, only a Mickey Mouse
figure, several signed movie posters
and a half-dozen copies of Staring and
Monster magazine.
It's easy to see why Landis elicits
such diverse reactions. He's nothing if
not opinionated. Why doesn't Jenny
Agutter, who's so gtxxl in Werewolf,
work more in Hollywood? "Because
producers here aren't looking for
beautiful, intelligent women, they're
looking for bimbos." What's the hard
est emotion to get out of a movie?
Wonderment. Spielberg did that with
the first version of Close Encounters.
You open your mouth in wonder Very
few movies do that. The first King
Kong Pinocchio, maybe the Wizard of
Oz " Star Wars? "Star Wars failed mis
erably at it. It's exciting, ya ya ya, but it
doesn't have a sense of wonder." The
press' reaction to big budget movies?
"The press is full of s-t. Blues Brothers
was never overbudgeted. We became
1942 Everyone hated us because we
were young and tot) successful. Look
what they did to Spielberg after 1941 I
mean, what was his crime? Making a
movie that didn't work." Is the current
crop of hot-shot directors ever com
petitive with one another? "Never —
what an odd question."
He is equally sanguine about the
impact of his movies. He says Anitvat
House was a breakthrough film and
that 11 universities wouldn't let them
sh(x>t on campus because the film had

DAN EICHOLTZ

a teacher sleeping with a student
'They said it never happened. Hell,
that's the reason most people become
teachers. Animal House is a political
film because at the height of born
again Christianity we made a film
about born-again paganism. Toga
Parties.
"Look at the end of Animal House
and look at Stripes Stripes is vers
funny, but it's totally reactionary. Its a
fascist film. 1 was appalled when I saw
it. That movie says the Army is great
and supports the military establish
ment. I don't think those who make it
know what it said and I'm sure they re
going to think my response is out of
line. But things are crazy. Do you
know people in this country thought
Pvt. Benjamin was a women's lib film'
Forget it.
"You have a responsibility when you
make films."
But Landis won't elaborate on the
political impact of movies except to
say you have to make them with sub
versive messages "Your first responsi
bility is to entertain, but what I m
proudest of is where my films are
banned—Argentina, Iran, South Africa.
It's terrific. You can always tell il your
film is correct by the countries in
which it's banned."
One of Landis's next projects will be
a movie of Mark Twain's A Coftnectic M
Yankee in Kitty Arthurs Court (which
Jenny Agutter reads to David Naughton
in Winn'olf). The script is being writ
ten by Oscar-winning, one-time black
listed Waldo Salt. Waldo has a lot
of anger in him," Landis says, and
so did Twain. Twain's my hero He
was a bitter, cynical, nasty li"' l '
guy. Twain's facinating. Huckleberry
/•'inn is the greatest American novel
ever written."
It's said you can tell something
about a man by the heroes he keeps

Universal Studios crams more tourists

the curious just how George Lucas
