# The 						Pretender: only Make Prelieve? or Hynde in Plain Sight
## 
### BILL BRAUNSTEIN 
he Look that would have
. made most men shrink. It
/ was a venomous scowl
flickering low from impas
sive eyes, a perfect cross
between disdain and indifference
so thoroughly dehumanizing one
didn't know whether to admire it or
fear it. It was so perfect, in fact, one
wondered if it was real. Did she
mean it, or was Chrissie Hynde,
rhythm guitarist, lead singer and
songwriter for the Pretenders, just
pretending?
The band had come out of their
dressing room just five minutes be
fore they would take the stage for a
sold-out show in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., the second stop on a stamina
testing tour that would take them
through the United States for the
next four months — until November
— then to England, Europe, Japan,
Australia and New Zealand, before
finally stopping in March. i
One by one the photographer
posed each member of the group
around a pay telephone backstage.
First, lead guitarist James Hon
eyman Scott, 24, came out, then
drummer Martin Chambers, 29, and
next, bassist Pete Farndon, 28. Chris
sie Hynde, 29, was the last to come
from the dressing room.
"Great, just great," said the pho
tographer, as he moved them
around. "Chrissie, you look beauti
ful."
She stopped in her tracks, turned,
and then gave him The Look. "Who
is this guy?" she snarled, enunciat
ing every word slowly for the
proper effect.
The photographer, undaunted,
snapped his photographs while
Hynde spat out a monololue that
would have made Don Rickles
proud.
"If I wanted to look pretty, do
you think I'd dress like this? Give me
a break." She flashed The Look
once more.
"Now turn the other way," the
photographer said.
"Why should I look that way?
Hynde asked. "I'll look where I want
to." She brought her hands to her
shoulders like a boxer in a clinch.
"So this is for a college magazine,
huh? We hate colleges. It's against
everything this band stands for."
The group's entrance music,
Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance"
— an eternal favorite at college
ceremonies — started playing over
the P A. The house lights went
down, a roar from the crowd came
up, and the four Pretenders
marched by and took their places
on the stage, leaving behind the
slightly dazed photographer.
"Insulting photographers," said
Chambers a few days later, "is one
of Chrissie's favorite pasttimes."

Pretenders, an English
- group fronted by an expat
a riate American named
wmM Chrissie Hynde, was one of
the brightest new bands to
emerge onto the 1980 music scene in
an otherwise uneventful year. After
three successful British singles in
1979, the group's first album. The
Pretenders, released here in January
of 1980, set the states abuzz, selling
just under a million copies.
The success wasn't difficult to un
derstand. Writing or cowriting 10 of
the album's 12 songs, Hynde proved
she was a contender in more ways
than one. Her voice is a sensual, lilt
ing instrument that harbors both
self-assuredness and a soft vulnera
bility. And as a songwriter, Hynde's
lyrics touched upon an emotional
battleground, things like interper-

sonal relationships,
unrequited passion
and social enmities.

The group's hit sin
gle, "Brass in Pocket,"

a swaggering procla
mation of female inde-

pendence, masterfully
combined all her and her

band's skills. The album
worked.

In short order the Pre-

tenders were being hailed as
the first important band of

the Eighties. Several rock critics
fell over themselves heaping

adulation on the still-develop
ing band. An e.p. released last

March, Extended Play, was also
greeted with praise. And now,

with the release of their second al
bum, Pretenders 11, the group finds
itself in the unenviable position of

trying to live
up to expec
tations.
Now that I
the novelty of
a rock group
led by a female
singer has worn
off, the Preten
ders will have to
make it on the
only thing that
counts — their
music. And that's
the reason behind
the massive seven
months of touring
that await the
band. The question
remains: Will the
Pretenders have stay
ing power? Are they
the real thing?
"As far as what
we're trying to do,"
said the band's man
ager Dave Hill, "we're
really trying to crack

this place this time. It's

very good to go to places like New
York and Los Angeles and Chicago
and be known. But I want this band
to be known everywhere.
"Whether the American public will
go wild and buy 10 million albums, I
don't know. All we can do is tour and
do the best we can."
M | ours before the Fort
Lauderdale show, Mar
tin and James, whom
m everyone calls Jimmy,
y " playfully splash each
other in the pool at the Hilton
Hotel like two little kids. Martin
throws punches at the water, caus
ing it to cascade upward; Jimmy

jumps back, as though

each punch has

hit him.

'Take that, and that," says Mar
tin, with each swing, as Jimmy
would scream out in mock agony.
The playfulness turns to a water
splashing fight. Suddenly there is a
clap of thunder.
"What's that, mate?" asks Martin.
"Nothing to worry about," an
swers Jimmy. "It's just the sound
check."
A few minutes later, Chrissie, who
had been staying at a hotel sorr.3 20
miles away with her boyfriend of
more than a year, the Kinks' Ray
Davies, approaches the pool area
with Davies in tow. As the two walk
by, Jimmy swims over and starts
splashing water on Davies' shoes.
Davies smiles benignly and keeps
walking.
A reporter eyes the couple as
Hynde and Davies stop at a table at
the far end of the pool, sit down
and start to chat. He starts to walk
over, but Hynde raises glowering
eyes. There it is. The Look. It says,
"Come no further."
The reporter walks over to Jimmy
instead. "It's just a front, you
know,"says Jimmy, laughing. "Be
hind this punk persona that Chrissie
has lies the weakest little kitten
you've ever met."
The fourth stop on the tour is Or
lando, Florida, and Hynde sits in her
hotel room, an hour before the

show, finally

willing

to meet with
the reporter. Sitting on her bed,
legs crossed, raven black ragamuffin
hair framing her pouty face, she
munches on a Reese's Peanut Butter
Cup. "I haven't eaten one of these
in ten years," she says almost
apologetically. "This is a flashback
to my candy store-going days in
Ohio."
Christine Ellen Hynde was born in
Akron, Ohio, Stptember 7,1956. She
got her first guitar when she was 14
and became interested right away,
learning the tunes of Bob Dylan off
records, and writing her own songs.
"I'd play in my room alone," she
says."I couldn't really jam with the
guys in high school because I was
terribly shy. I didn't want them to
know that as a girl I was playing
things like the Paul Butterfield Blues
Band."
After a brief one-gig fling in a
band with Mark Mothersbaugh
(who would later devolve Devo)
when she was 16, and three years at
Kent state University as an art stu
dent, Hynde knew it was time for a
change. "I was one of those thou
sands of American kids who get out
of high school, don't know what
else to do, so they knock around
college for a few years. After a
while, I didn't see any point in stay
ing."
London seemed as good a place
as any, so after working at various
odd jobs, she left the United States
in 1973. "I left because the lifestyle
here, in general, doesn't suit me. I
never had a car, I never wanted
one, and I'll never have one. As far
as I'm concerned, if you don't want
a car and don't drive, then you bet
ter get out of America. It's as simple
as that."
When Hynde got to London she
immediately found work as a jour
nalist for the British music tabloid
New Musical Express where she
garnered attention for her devastat
ing reviews and off-the-wall musical

tastes. But she soon grew tired
with her budding journalism

career. "The music scene in Lon
don in 1973 and '74 was so ul-

timately boring, there was
nothing to write about." Try-

ing to change that, Hynde moved
to France with the intention of
starting her own band. When that
didn't work out, she moved back to
Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975, out of a
desire to "get back to my musical
roots."

Chrissie
Hynde:
She's got
"w Look
It never occurred to me to go
back to Cleveland," she says, "I'd
spent all my time trying to get out.
But I became very one-track minded
about music at this time." She played
in a band called Jack Rabbitt for
about six months in Cleveland and
when the band broke up she made
her way back to France for another
abortive attempt at organizing her
own band. Then, in 1976, Hynde re
turned to England for a visit, just
as the punk movement was begin
ning to take hold. "You could just
smell there was something cooking,
and I thought I've got to get back
to London!"'
Hynde had been making demo tapes
with different people she'd known over
the years, and finally one tape landed
on the lap of Dave Hill, a promo man
for a small English label. "I was really
bowled over by her," he recalls, "so I
was determined to do something for
her." He left his job to manage her. The
first step was to get a band together
Bassist Pete Farndon had met Hynde
in the spring of 1978 while Chrissie was
making her latest effort to put a group

together. Farndon had just split from an
Australian folk-rock band, and when he
met Hynde he was impressed with the
singer's material and feisty determina
tion. He called upon guitarist James
Honeyman Scott, whom he remem
bered as the little brother of a girl he
dated in his home town of Hereford.
Hynde made her typical first impres
sion upon Scott when they saw each
other in the little rehearsal studio she
and Hill had rented. "When I first met
her," recalls Scott, "I thought, What a
loudmouthed American cow. Who the
hell does this woman think she Ls?"'
But, he too, was impressed with
Hynde's single-minded drive.
The band recruited an Irish drum
mer named Jerry Mcleduff and re
corded a demo tape that include two
original Hynde compositions, "The
Wait" and "Precious" and a cover ver
sion of a 1964 Kinks song, "Stop Your
Sobbing " This done, and seeing no fu
ture, Scott moved back to Hereford. But
a few weeks later when Farndon
phoned to say Scott's hero, Nick Lowe,
wanted to produce a single of "Stop
Your Sobbing," Scott wasted no time
rebounding back to "London.
Mcleduff, on the other hand, was not

working out. He was a married man
with three children and couldn't give
the commitment Hynde demanded of
people. "Nothing was more important
to me than the band," said Hynde. "If
someone said they wanted to be in the
band, but their car, or their house, or
their job, or their girlfriend seemed
more important, I dropped them like a
hot potato." Exit Mcleduff, enter Cham
bers.
Martin Chambers had played in a va
riety of bands, ranging from blues to
classical to a rock band called Cheeks
he played in with Jimmy years earlier.
He was living not far from the others in
London, where he was earning money
as a driving instructor. Coincidentally,
he was from Hereford too. When Mar
tin was called to audition for the band,
the chemistry was immediate. A band
was born.
The group's name, taken from the fif
ties song, "The Great Pretender," was a
last-minute choice, made in desperation
the day before "Stop Your Sobbing"
was released in January of 1979 It im
mediately made a respectable show on
the British charts, cracking the top
thirty. Two more singles followed. Be
fore long the band was playing around

England to the praise of critics — an
amazing feat, considering they had
never played live together before the
release of the first single.
Nick Lowe didn't think the band had
enough material for an album, and po
litely declined to produce the Preten
ders. A friend of Hynde's, Chris
Thomas, who had the Sex Pi
stols, Wings and Fete Townshend, ag
reed to work with the band for a week
on an album. The week turned into six
months of recording. And he's been
with them ever since. The Pretenders
was released in January of 1980 and the
group hasn't had time to look back.
A knock on the door by
tour manager Stan Tip
pins signifies that it is
time for Chrissie to get
ready for the show. She's
been cooperative, gracious and talka
tive.
Minutes later, Chrissie and the other
Pretenders meet in the lobby of the
hotel and then get into the white lim
ousine: she and the driver up front;
Martin, Pete and Stan, the tour manager,
in back. Jimmy, hanging out with some
friends, arrived at the auditorium ear

lier.
As the car drives the short distance
from the hotel to the concert hall, the
people in the car are subdued, quiet.
Chrissie turns around and looks con
tentedly at the people in the back.
When the car pulls into the au
ditorium's back lot a few fans surge
closer to the limousine. Finally the car
comes to a stop.
Outside the car, a photographer, who
has been waiting more than-30 minutes,
readies his camera and as the car door
opens starts clicking pictures at Chris
sie, who almost instinctively shields her
face.
The calm Chrissie Hynde disappears
and a different one emerges, the one
seen earlier. "Stan," she calls out to the
tour manager, "there's a photographer
out there. Get rid of him."
The tour manager jumps out the
door and tells the photographer to stop.
Then the members of the Pretenders,
led by Chrissie Hynde, walk through
the crowd, into the auditorium.
Hynde turns to see the photographer
being hustled away. And there it is. The
Lixik. It's back on her face. And you still
couldn't tell if it was real or just pre
tend.
