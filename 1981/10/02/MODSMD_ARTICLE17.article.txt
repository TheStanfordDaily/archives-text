## THOSE FANTASTIC FANTASY VAULTS 
### 
Fantasy twafers

(Fantasy Records) Fantasy Records has
mined its seemingly endless vault of
classic Fifties and Sixties jazz and come
forth with a group of eight twofers that
spotlight musical mountain-movers
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Charles Mingus and Max Roach and
lesser miracle workers Johnny Griffin,
Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, Cannonball
Adderly, Gene Ammons and J.J.
Johnson. All of these releases are
good; some of them are simply first
class.
At the head of the list go Monk's
April in Paris (Milestone) and Rollins'
Vintage Sessions (Prestige). The two
are musical cousins. Both put rhythm
at the heart of their work and It is that
unshakable swing, coupled with
melodic imaginations of colossal pro
portions, that has made their art en
dure. Too, both are exceptional com
posers, Rollins still writing fluently
today while Monk has remained dor
mant (he last appeared in public in
1975 and is reported to be in ill
health); many of their compositions
(Monk — ' Round Midnight," "Well,
You Needn't"; Rollins — "Oleo," "Aire
gin") have become classics.
Live, a 1961 date, presents a routine
familiar to those fortunate enough to
have heard Monk in person: each tune,
excepting the piano solos "Just a Gig
olo" and "April in Paris," consists of a
reading of the melody, solos by
tenorman Charlie Rouse, Monk, bassist
John Ore and drummer Frankie Dun
lop and the melody once again.
Rouse's airy, amber tone and semi
rigid style fit handily with Monk's on
the-beat comping, and the pianist's
solos, with rephrasing of the melody

and widely spaced intervals, are com
manding. Monk may be a little hard to
decipher at first, but when one finally
"hears' him, he sounds traditional and
uncomplicated. Such titles as "I Mean
You," "Off Minor," and "Rhythm-a
ning" are played.
Vintage documents Rollins' first five
trips to the studio as a leader, appear
ing with Miles Davis (it was Miles' date
and he insisted Sonny cut a tune, and
it was later issued under the saxman's
name), the Modern Jazz Quartet, pia
nists Kenny Drew, Elmo Hope, and
Monk. Though he was only 21-24 when
these 1951-54 sesssions were held, the
by-now familiar Rollins trademarks
were in evidence: an innate rhythmic
sense; stunning melodic outpourings;
a stark, brash tone; and a selection of
rarely heard material. Sonny works his
magic on a lazy "Time on My Hands,'
"1 Want to Be Happy," with Monk com
ping merrily, and a rippling "Movin'
Out," one of four cuts where the great
trumpeter Kenny Dorham and a Bud
Powell-influenced Hope are highligh
ted.
The influence of Monk trails over
into 1961's Live at Minton's (Prestige),
where tenor saxophonists Griffin and
Davis engage in joyous musical com
bat. Griffin worked with Monk for half
of 1958 (Live at the Five Spot on Mile
stone is recommended) and the
pianist's "In Walked Bud" and "Staight
No Chaser" are included here, along
with a generous measure of blues and
bop tunes. While the saxmen are both
disciples of Ben Webster, they express
his influence differently: Davis' sound
is swarthy and raspy, GriflTs lighter and
leaner Both love to play chorus after
chorus, as does Junior Mance, one of
the finest blues-based pianists extant.
Tenor saxophonist Ammons was an
other jazzman who thrived on the
blues, and three of the eight lengthy
tunes on The Mr Sound (Prestige) are

blues, of which the snail-paced "Blue
Hymn," with Amnions' sound oozing
thickly out of his horn, is a particular
delight. Also welcome are the four
numbers with Pepper Adams' husky
baritone sax and John Coltrane's alto
(!), with the latter in a rare appearance
on that horn. Amnions, who (delivered
ballads and uptempos with equal ap
lomb, is in excellent form on this 1958
date.
Three of the twofers offer live ses
sions. Mingus' tumultuous triumph at
the Sunday afternoon concert of the
1964 Monterey Jazz Festival can be
found on Mingus at Monterey (Pres
tige), a superb album if only for the
bassist's plucked rendition of El
lington's "I Got It Bad"' and his
exhilarating arco work on "Meditations
on Integration," though altoist Charles
McPherson and pianist Jaki Byard also
shine. Drummer Roach's Converse*
Hons (Milestone) has two long per
formance cuts, spotlighting Clifford
Jordan's ringing, passionate sound,
while the two studio sides are worth
while for the wonderful duets with
Roach and bassist Art Davis. Four
Trombones The Debut Recordings
(Prestige) presents Johnson, Kai Wind
ing, Bennie Green and Willie IX'nnis,
four seminal slide men, in a 1953 club
date that covers standard'jazz, material
in a jam session context.
Cannonball's Alabama/Africa (Mile
stone) completes this bounteous re
lease, combining John Benson Brooks'
four-movement "Alabama Concerto" —
with written and ad-lib sections that
utilize the talents of guitarist Barry
Galbraith, trumpeter Art Farmer and
the altoist —and "African Waltz," a Six
ties big band date that finds Cannon's
soaring horn out front on "This Here,'
Stockholm Sweetnin,'" anil some sue

his influence differently: Davis' sound
is swarthy and raspy, GriflTs lighter and
leaner Both love to play chorus after
chorus, as does Junior Mance, one of
the finest blues-based pianists extant.
Tenor saxophonist Ammons was an
other jazzman who thrived on the
blues, and three of the eight lengthy
tunes on The Mr Sound (Prestige) are

blues, of which the snail-paced "Blue
Hymn," with Amnions' sound oozing
thickly out of his horn, is a particular
delight. Also welcome are the four
numbers with Pepper Adams' husky
baritone sax and John Coltrane's alto
(!), with the latter in a rare appearance
on that horn. Amnions, who (delivered
ballads and uptempos with equal ap
lomb, is in excellent form on this 1958
date.
Three of the twofers offer live ses
sions. Mingus' tumultuous triumph at
the Sunday afternoon concert of the
1964 Monterey Jazz Festival can be
found on Mingus at Monterey (Pres
tige), a superb album if only for the
bassist's plucked rendition of El
lington's "I Got It Bad"' and his
exhilarating arco work on "Meditations
on Integration," though altoist Charles
McPherson and pianist Jaki Byard also
shine. Drummer Roach's Converse*
Hons (Milestone) has two long per
formance cuts, spotlighting Clifford
Jordan's ringing, passionate sound,
while the two studio sides are worth
while for the wonderful duets with
Roach and bassist Art Davis. Four
Trombones The Debut Recordings
(Prestige) presents Johnson, Kai Wind
ing, Bennie Green and Willie IX'nnis,
four seminal slide men, in a 1953 club
date that covers standard'jazz, material

four-movement "Alabama Concerto" —
with written and ad-lib sections that
utilize the talents of guitarist Barry
Galbraith, trumpeter Art Farmer and

Fantasy twafers

(Fantasy Records) Fantasy Records has
mined its seemingly endless vault of
classic Fifties and Sixties jazz and come
forth with a group of eight twofers that
spotlight musical mountain-movers
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Charles Mingus and Max Roach and
lesser miracle workers Johnny Griffin,
Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis, Cannonball
Adderly, Gene Ammons and J.J.
Johnson. All of these releases are
good; some of them are simply first
class.
At the head of the list go Monk's
April in Paris (Milestone) and Rollins'
Vintage Sessions (Prestige). The two
are musical cousins. Both put rhythm
at the heart of their work and It is that
unshakable swing, coupled with
melodic imaginations of colossal pro
portions, that has made their art en
dure. Too, both are exceptional com
posers, Rollins still writing fluently
today while Monk has remained dor
mant (he last appeared in public in
1975 and is reported to be in ill
health); many of their compositions
(Monk — ' Round Midnight," "Well,
You Needn't"; Rollins — "Oleo," "Aire
gin") have become classics.
Live, a 1961 date, presents a routine
familiar to those fortunate enough to
have heard Monk in person: each tune,
excepting the piano solos "Just a Gig
olo" and "April in Paris," consists of a
reading of the melody, solos by
tenorman Charlie Rouse, Monk, bassist
John Ore and drummer Frankie Dun
lop and the melody once again.
Rouse's airy, amber tone and semi
rigid style fit handily with Monk's on
the-beat comping, and the pianist's
solos, with rephrasing of the melody

and widely spaced intervals, are com
manding. Monk may be a little hard to
decipher at first, but when one finally
"hears' him, he sounds traditional and
uncomplicated. Such titles as "I Mean
You," "Off Minor," and "Rhythm-a
ning" are played.
Vintage documents Rollins' first five
trips to the studio as a leader, appear
ing with Miles Davis (it was Miles' date
and he insisted Sonny cut a tune, and
it was later issued under the saxman's
name), the Modern Jazz Quartet, pia
nists Kenny Drew, Elmo Hope, and
Monk. Though he was only 21-24 when
these 1951-54 sesssions were held, the
by-now familiar Rollins trademarks
were in evidence: an innate rhythmic
sense; stunning melodic outpourings;
a stark, brash tone; and a selection of
rarely heard material. Sonny works his
magic on a lazy "Time on My Hands,'
"1 Want to Be Happy," with Monk com
ping merrily, and a rippling "Movin'
Out," one of four cuts where the great
trumpeter Kenny Dorham and a Bud
Powell-influenced Hope are highligh
ted.
The influence of Monk trails over
into 1961's Live at Minton's (Prestige),
where tenor saxophonists Griffin and
Davis engage in joyous musical com
bat. Griffin worked with Monk for half
of 1958 (Live at the Five Spot on Mile
stone is recommended) and the
pianist's "In Walked Bud" and "Staight
No Chaser" are included here, along
with a generous measure of blues and
bop tunes. While the saxmen are both
disciples of Ben Webster, they express
his influence differently: Davis' sound
is swarthy and raspy, GriflTs lighter and
