## Koko Taylor Concert Review 
### 
NEW YORK, AUGUST 5, 1981

Willie Dixon (famed blues
songwriter and bassist) found
Koko Taylor playing local clubs in
Chicago. He was doing A&R for Chess
Records then and knew he'd found a
rare figure — one that's even more
rare 16 years later — a woman belting
the blues. She was unstudied and
powerful He took her to Leonard
Chess, she signed, and kept on playing
the small clubs.
She plays the clubs almost nine
months a year.
If I stayed home I'd get real lone
some,' she told fans at Tramps on a
sufferable August night in New York.
She had filled the city's only regular
blues venue on a Wednesday night.
"These are your people," her label rep
told her, "Koko fans. They aren't the
same people who come here all the
time. Indeed, she had drawn Doc
Pomus — legendary pen of the rock &
roll/R&B song trade ("Suspicion,'
"Surrender," "Save the Last Dance for
Me ") —who stayed for three sets, and
got tribute from Taylor's band doing
Born in the Country (Raised on the
Ghetto Streets)."
Offstage, Koko Taylor offered a
freshet of personal reflection: proud
recollection of her brothers'
homemade corncob harmonica and
hay-baling wire guitar; 8.8 King as her
hometown deejay; the inspiration of
Memphis Minnie, Elmore James, Magic
Sam, Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters,
lalkative, low-key, sweet and big
spirited, she let fall some of the self
effacement that seemed so surprising
onstage.
For most of the show, Taylor met
standard blues form. Her own "I'm a
Woman" was triumphant, confident,
proud: I can make love to a crocodile
•.. I know my stufT/I ain't never had
enough." "You Can Have My Husband
(But Don't Mess With My Man)" did its
crowd-pleasing turnaround on the
outside woman genre in blues and
pop soul "Trying to Make a Living," a
song from the Depression Thirties,
said volumes about the Reagan
Eighties.
Taylor's stance and attack recalled
James Brown. She's a small woman
with a big face and she has Brown's
ability to draw herself round the mi
crophone and cofnmutuJeer the first
words. She's powerful; there's a rolling
scream way hack in her throat that
would break most singers in one show
a week, let along three sets a night.
Still, the 1 ramps date showed a pro
fessional s pace, and a long-haul

traveler's distance. The air wasn't loose
until sometime in the second set; the
between-songs talk was time-worn
(excepting a loving introduction of
Pop Taylor, husband and driver); and
the band didn't rock too far from for
mat. At 200-plus nights a year, she was
doing the one sane gait, the slow build
toward intimacy and give that a small
club allows and rewards.
"In the blues it's just Big Mama
Thornton, myself and a few more You
can count them on two hands, the
women that's really singing the blues
today. Let's face it, you can get radio
airplay doing disco," Taylor told us
Clearly, Koko Taylor is in her prime
She refreshed the blues at Tramps
While the pop media inhale and spit
out six trends a month, Taylor quietK
and forcefully makes a person want to
hear the blues.

NEW YORK, AUGUST 5, 1981

Willie Dixon (famed blues
songwriter and bassist) found
Koko Taylor playing local clubs in
Chicago. He was doing A&R for Chess
Records then and knew he'd found a
rare figure — one that's even more
rare 16 years later — a woman belting
the blues. She was unstudied and
powerful He took her to Leonard
Chess, she signed, and kept on playing
the small clubs.
She plays the clubs almost nine
months a year.
If I stayed home I'd get real lone
some,' she told fans at Tramps on a
sufferable August night in New York.
She had filled the city's only regular
blues venue on a Wednesday night.
"These are your people," her label rep
told her, "Koko fans. They aren't the
same people who come here all the
time. Indeed, she had drawn Doc
Pomus — legendary pen of the rock &
roll/R&B song trade ("Suspicion,'
"Surrender," "Save the Last Dance for
Me ") —who stayed for three sets, and
got tribute from Taylor's band doing
Born in the Country (Raised on the
Ghetto Streets)."
Offstage, Koko Taylor offered a
freshet of personal reflection: proud
recollection of her brothers'
homemade corncob harmonica and
hay-baling wire guitar; 8.8 King as her
hometown deejay; the inspiration of
Memphis Minnie, Elmore James, Magic
Sam, Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters,
lalkative, low-key, sweet and big
spirited, she let fall some of the self
effacement that seemed so surprising
onstage.
For most of the show, Taylor met
standard blues form. Her own "I'm a
Woman" was triumphant, confident,
proud: I can make love to a crocodile
•.. I know my stufT/I ain't never had
enough." "You Can Have My Husband
(But Don't Mess With My Man)" did its
crowd-pleasing turnaround on the
outside woman genre in blues and
pop soul "Trying to Make a Living," a
song from the Depression Thirties,
said volumes about the Reagan
Eighties.
Taylor's stance and attack recalled
James Brown. She's a small woman
with a big face and she has Brown's
ability to draw herself round the mi
crophone and cofnmutuJeer the first
words. She's powerful; there's a rolling
scream way hack in her throat that
would break most singers in one show
a week, let along three sets a night.
Still, the 1 ramps date showed a pro
fessional s pace, and a long-haul

traveler's distance. The air wasn't loose
until sometime in the second set; the
between-songs talk was time-worn
(excepting a loving introduction of
Pop Taylor, husband and driver); and
the band didn't rock too far from for
mat. At 200-plus nights a year, she was
doing the one sane gait, the slow build
toward intimacy and give that a small
club allows and rewards.
"In the blues it's just Big Mama
Thornton, myself and a few more You
can count them on two hands, the
women that's really singing the blues
today. Let's face it, you can get radio
