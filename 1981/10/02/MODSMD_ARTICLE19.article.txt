# Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, Paco De Lucia
## 
### 
GREEK THEATRE. BERKELEY

An elegant evening of acoustic
guitar virtuosity enriched one An
gust Saturday night in Berkeley when
Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, and
Paco De Lucia performed a concert
much like the one at the Warfield
Theatre in December that spawned thi
trio's best-selling new live LP, Frida 1
Night in San Francisco
The Berkeley's show's material in
eluded pieces from Friday Night, .md
shared both the transcenilant, e\
hilarating moments and the hyped up
audience-pandering ones that I'll die
record.
The concert opened with each P ( ' r
former doing a brief solo-spot l,K '
supplying some of the nights most
tasteful, concise guitar work. The solo
pieces also comprised clipped intro
ductory phrases about the guitarists
De Lucia: deft, but limited; McLaughlin
quick, complex; Di Meola: fluid, pet
cussive.
The next segment — duets — crack
led with zest and magic. But part ol
that bargain was periodic gaps in dis
cipline and structure. McLaughlin and
De Lucia poured out a spirited rendi
tion of Egberto Gismonti's dreamy
"Frevo Rasgado," and bits of the other
duets were equally uplifting, yet occa
sionally it seemed that crowd-pleasing
and sheer speed were more important
to the guitarists than tasteful, lyrical
playing.
That wasn't entirely their fault In an
evening of all-acoustic guitar, an audi
ence may well appreciate, say, the
enticing melodies, or maybe the
contrapuntal/unison playing But the
audience responds most vocally to
wild-fingered pickings or occasional
snippets of incongruous music (coun
try strumming at the Berkeley show or
the "Pink Panther" theme on Friday
Night's version of "Short Tales of the
Black Forest."
In the final portion all three musi
cians finally joined forces. Di Meola,
McLaughlin and De Lucia were more
controlled and precise than during the
duets, yet maintained the magic, soar
ing triumphantly on a shimmering
new Mclaughlin piece, "La Balena, as
well as the .set-closing "Fantasia Suite.
