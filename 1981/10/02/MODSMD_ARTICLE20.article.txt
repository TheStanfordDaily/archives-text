Fall Fashion Forecast: Franker i & Davis Ahem don
Saturday Night J Ave for College Capers & Bigscreen Fix

Reveling in the latest campus epidemic — Dull Sor
malcy — those great guys and tip-top comedians, AI
Franhen and Tom Davis, show how to come down with
an acute case.
Imagine an outdated mail-order catalog, perhaps
found lodged behind the ri/le rack in a musty farm
house. Cross-pollinate the Young Mens Ready-to Wear
section with Sporting Goods and School Supplies
(scissors and paste can be helpful at this point),
and you 've got it: Dull Normalcy. Or. at least, you
could have it. With a little effort

Al Franken and Tom Davis were on that old television
show called Saturday \igbt Live You remember, it was
the terrific concept in television comedy that everyone
loved for a few years and then it stopped being real
funny but everyone kept watching it anyway Franken &
Davis were among the group of original writers (thev
h.id a hand in the creation of such skits ,is The Cone
heads, Jeopard\ 1' ind Nixons Final Days). They also
performed occasionally as the Franke n & Davis show
within the-show and in the last season with the original
cast, Franken became very visible with his Al Franken
Decade' riff on Weekend I'pdate
At a New York sidewalk restaurant Franken and Davis
recently talked about sick, sophomoric corned), their
college tour, and the screenplav they re writing.
"College audiences are a lot of fun t< >r us to do, the
slender Davis said over eggs Benedict They're not
drinking during the show. "
NX ell. there's nothing wrong with drinking during the
show,' the shorter, curly-haired Franken cut in As you
recall, when we performed at Harrah s iin Reno) we
pertormed to a basically middle aged, middle-class
crowd, and they were fun because they were drinking
"College audience* have their drawbacks." he con
tinued. "Thev re a little immaiure in some respects.
They'll laugh at certain things that are mavbe we do
some stuff that is
A little blue, Davis said
It's a litte blue. Franken repeated And usuallv the
blue stuif we do, we try to liave more than just one J'-vcl
to But verv often, a college audience will ' ike on the
dirty joke." •
As opposed to the stunning, looks into-rhe-human
psyche kind of thing, said Davis hopefully The differ
ence between a dim piece and n brilliant piece can be
very fine sometimes
An example of Franken & Davis blue material occurs
in the 1 You ve Come a Long NX ay Buddy sketch, which
was done on S,V/. and which rhe> repeat in their stage

guests talk up male accomplishments One of the guests
