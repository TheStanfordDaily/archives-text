Jerry Casale of DEVO spears another fish
fragment from his plate of sushi delicacies,
then resumes an attack on 20th Century life.
'What DEVO is dealing with fundamentally is
the absurdity of the human being," says the
31-year-old bassist emphatically "We hate
what is assumed to be real — what most
people assume to be true and real, isn't It
all disgusts us ..
Sitting across from Casale in the wood
panelled, soft-lit surroundings of a Los

Angeles area sushi restaurant, absurdity is
on my mind as well. Mid-way through my
interview, it strikes me as a tad incongruous
that DEVO's chief public spokesman, a
musician supposedly dedicated to wising up
the "spuds" about the insanities of modern
man, seems so comfortable in this chic set
ting. Watching a member of DEVO feast on
a crab-and-quail-egg roll while railing
against predatory capitalism is slightly disil
lusioning.
Which brings us to the question many are
asking about DEVO these days: has the
techno-costumed quintet from Akron, Ohio
with the message about human de
evolution been compromised by the big
time? When their debut LP, Q. Are We Not
Men? A. We Are Devo!, was released in late
1978, the band was critically hailed as the
dadaist guerillas of rock. Everything about
the group, from their clockwork rhythms to
their robotic stage manner and lyrics about

happy mongoloids, suggested that they
would never rise above cult favorite status.
That was then —today, in the wake of their
near-platinum Freedom of Choice album
(and its Top 40 single, "Whip It"), the band
has released a new LP, New Traditionalists,
a disc which brings them even closer to
mass acceptance.
Back to the sushi bar: Casale places an
other order (green tea ice cream, this time)
before addressing the sell-out issue head
on. "We're like "the band that fell to earth
now," he says with a wry smile. "We got
sucked up into the music business and now,
with New Traditionalists, the transforma
tion's complete. It's inevitable — we've al
ways said, "Watch us devolve, watch us be
come what we're laughing at and see how
gracefully we survive.
"Whip It," DEVO's breakthrough single, is
a prime example of what Casale means. In
tended mainly as a tongue-in-cheek moral

uplift peptalk, the lyric actually succeeded
through its more vulgar sexual implications.
Casale says it's all to be expected: "We
wrote a patently disgusting lyric and, sure
enough, it worked. As long as there's sexual
innuendo in a song, it'll be a big hit. It was
perceived on that level: beating your meat,
beating your woman, beating something"
New Traditionalists continues in the di
rection of Freedom of Choice: more
mainstream song structures and arrange
ments, with simpler, less overtly bizarre
lyrics. Casale and DEVO co-leader/vocalist/
keyboardist Mark Mothersbaugh are writing
tunes in a more direct vein and, together
with guitarists Bob Mothersbaugh and Bob
Casale and drummer Alan Myers, they're
playing more conservatively as well. Such
tracks as "Soft Things'' and "Love Without
Anger" may be the latest DEVO satires of
America's sexual fixations — or perhaps
they're celebrations of them. Buzzwords
drawn from mass media advertising and
sci-fi, usually a DEVO staple, are all but un
used this time. The language is vaguer
though still ominous, as in"The Super
Thing." In short, the band has rounded off
some of its sharp edges — but does it neces
sarily mean they've sold out?
Yes — and no. DEVO's peculiar, irony
laden aesthetic allows the band to blatantly
stoop to conquer without violating its basic
principles. The crass, the grotesque, the
sweepingly inane: they've been elements in
DEVO's music and video presentations
since the very beginning. By "mutating" (a
favorite DEVO word) to fit America's tastes,
the band hopes to expose its doctrine to
millions, though, Casale admits, "only about
3 percent of our audience really get our
ideas."
Our conversation ended, Casale heads off
for a meeting as I continue to mull over his
words. While he was pleasant enough com
pany, something about his press secretary
manner disturbed me. He was too glib in
his spouting of DEVO's creed, too pat in his
statements about the band's intentions. Pul
sating beneath the neatly-packaged android
exterior of the group, I knew, was a heart
of stone crazitiess. DEVO might be working
within the system at present, but I was con
fident that the madness which nurtured
DEVO back in Akron lived on.
My conviction was confirmed later that
night after several hours of enjoyably
warped conversation with Mark Mothers
baugh at his home in LA's Miracle Mile dis
trict. I was told by DEVO's management that
Mark preferred to leave press relations to
Jerry. Perhaps they were afraid to unleash
him on me. Or vice versa. In any case, I re
sponded to Mothersbaugh's personality
immediately. He radiated the sincerity of
someone who's lived on the social fringes
for so long they can never truly join the
masses. For better or worse, the 30-year-old
Voice of DEVO struck me as real.
Mothersbaugh's upstairs duplex pad is
short on furnishings, but filled with all sorts
of flotsam: children's toys, strange collages
and other art pieces, tape after tape of old
DEVO material. His trademark bangs cas
cading down his forehead, he leads me
about the place, seizing my tape recorder to
help me keep pace as he sweeps from his
