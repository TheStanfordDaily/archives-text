So little of the humor in Honky
Tonk Freeway is of the intelligent
variety that one seriously wonders why
such actors as William Davane, Geral
dine Page, Hume Cronyn and Jessica
Tandy had anything to do with it.
Ilonky Tonk Freeway purports to be
the story of the commercial crusade of
the town of Ticlaw, Fla., which, in spite
of promises from Tallahassee, does not
get its own exit on the newly built
freeway. On their ways to Ticlaw are a
renegade family man from Chicago
(Bridges), a pair of not-too-charming
bank robbers from New York (George
Dzundza and Joe Grifasi), a busload of
Asian orphans and, the only redeem
ing subplot, an elderly ad man and his
tipsy wife (Cronyn and Tandy, who
are, as always, a dynamite pair). As in a
sort of misbegotten Nashville, these
parties mix, match and play musical
cars until they are all chaotically
brought together.
There are a few gtxxl moments. The
opening shot of an exploding grove of
palm trees is a subtle parody of the
same moment in Apocalypse Now (and
later comes the blowing-up of the
bridge, or in this case, a freeway
overpass). The film's climax is a High
Noon-type showdown with the town's
mayor/minister/innkeeper (Devane)
striding down the deserted streets to
meet with the evil government
bureaucrats. There is the rather touch
ing plight of a young nun (Deborah
Rush) who steals away from her
superior (Page) for forbidden dabs of
perfume and dips in the pool. And
there is the immortal line: "The Inter
national House of Pancakes is the one
consistent thing in my life."
But most of what we get is tasteless.
We visit the drive-thru mortuary. We
meet a dizzy young blonde (Beverly
D'Angelo) who carries her late mother
halfway across the country in an urn, a
wasted hitchhiker (Daniel Stern)
winds up snorting the contents of that
urn. We meet Bubbles, the water
skiing elephant. Get the idea?
Do not fear, friends, that your life
will be incomplete without Ilonky
Tonk Freeway.
