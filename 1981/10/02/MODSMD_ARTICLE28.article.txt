# Tarzan the Ape Man
## 
### 
starring Ho Derek, Richard Harris &
Miles O'Keefe; written by Jam Rowe &
Gary Gootiard; directed by John Derek
Tarzan, the late Edgar Rice Bur
rough's mythic Lord of the Jungle,
has about as much to do with John and
Bo Derek's much-publicized remake
of Tarzan the Ape Man as Jack Nichol
son lias to do with Jack-in-the-Box.
Since the film's focus is on 80-asjane
for at least two-thirds of its consider
able length, MGM should have re
christened this saga Jane Goes Ape On
tensibly, the script deals with the con
flict between Jane, a turn-of-the
century heiress, and her father, a
long-absent Great White Hunter she
has followed all the way to Africa. But
this father-and-daughter skirmishing is
merely a prelude to the film's Big
Moment — Jane swings with Tarzan.
That, in turn, allows John Derek (who
directed and photographed) to shoot
what amounts to a Playboy layout-on
film, a kind of Bluer lMf>oon for the
Cosmo crowd. Unfortunately, two
things get in the way. First, there's 80,
who loses what undeniable appeal she
has every time she opens her mouth
and delivers line readings flatter than
any that can be heard in your average-
Army basic training film. The second
problem is a much-muscled, ex
football player named Miles O'Keefe
who, as Tarzan, is supposed to be en
raptured by Jane but actually carries an
expression of annoyance which
suggests he has better things to do ...
like a modelling assignment for
Playgirl or a trip to the gym. The film's
climax, which finds Tarzan waylaid and
Jane and Big Daddy (Richard Harris) at
the mercy of some pygmies, is initially
quite confusing. Why are all these pe
tite creatures jumping up and down
with venomous looks crossing their
brows? Finally, it dawns on the con
fused viewer why they are carrying on
like munchkins-on-speed. They're mad
.. fighting mad. They read the script.
