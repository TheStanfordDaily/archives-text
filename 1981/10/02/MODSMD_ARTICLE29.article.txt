# American Werewolf in London
## 
### 
starring Ootid Naughton, jenny Agut
ter and (Iriffin Dunne; written and di
reeled fry John lundis
\\ferewolfs best scenes are the first
WW ones wherein American college
students Naughton and Dunne trek
through deserted portions of northern
England on a full m<x)n night. Their
dialogue Is sharp and real and witty,
and the film never quite attains that
level again (except for one brief scene
later when nurse Agutter feeds patient
Naughton). The actors are engaging,
but there is little style on display here.
It's neither a sp<x>f of, nor homage to,
the genre.
Those who adore horror films with
hairy creatures and foggy forests and
lurid special effects will probably find
American Werewolf tame — its exposi
tlon somewhat incoherent, its monster
all ux) cuddly. But for the rest of us —
those who think most horror/
werewolf/vampire movies stupid and
childish — Land is' film is funny, divert
ing, inoffensive and OK.
