# The 						CAMPUS
## With The Editors Of Modern Photography Magazine Looking For Action? Don't Forget A Camera! 
### 
What with frisbees sailing around
the campus, sleepy-eyed seniors
trying to make it to 9 A.M. class
on Monday morning before the
bell rings or enjoying the football, soccer
or basketball game, there are plenty of
subjects in motion around you. If you've
got a fast-acting finger, you can have a lot
of fun chasing after action shots. And,
with some luck and practice, you'll be sur
pp r d how proficient you can become in
.oducing eye-stopping shots.
Let's figure first that you're a real tyro
with a simple camera that you've been told
won't take action pictures.
Sure it will. While its fairly slow shutter
speed(s) won't stop much action, try fol
lowing the action while looking through
the viewfinder.
Pan the camera smoothly as your sub
ject moves. Snap away when the subject
appears most interesting. What you'll get
is a fairly sharp subject, maybe with some
softness around the legs and hands, all
against a blurred background —which is
how action looks anyway. (A lot of pro
photographers spent plenty of time trying
to dope out how to get just such an effect

before they tumbled on a simple camera
setting as the solution.)
Simple cameras generally have slightly
wide-angle lenses, meaning you've got to
get fairly close to your subjects. This sort
of rules 'em out for shooting spectator
sports (other than the band formations at
half time) from the stands. Unless you're
an official photographer, you'll probably
be stuck there, far from the action. With a
simple camera or, as a matter of fact, with
any camera having a normal lens (the one
that came with camera) players on the
field will look like tiny ants. If your cam
era doesn't allow you to use interchange
able lenses, better stick to snapshots of
your fellow spectators (great shots are

possible when there's an exciting play and
the audience goes wild).
But if you can change lenses, beg or
borrow a telephoto or tele-zoom lens.
Unless you're in a stadium the size of a
walnut, you'll need something with a
focal length of between 200 and 400 mm
depending on just how far away you are
from the action and how close you want
your pictures to appear.
A zoom lens allows you to use a whole
variety of focal lengths, and so gives you
many framing choices right from your
seat. How long a lens do you need? A
200 mm lens gets you four times closer
than a regular 50mm lens (or if it's easier
to think about, it covers Va the area of a
regular, normal lens). A 400 mm covers '/»
the area and a 300 mm length is right in
between.) If you can borrow a tele or.

even better, a tele zoom and try it out
yourself for size you'll decide on the right
length pretty quickly and then you can get
a tele zoom lens of your own.
Load up with an ASA 400 so you can
shoot at the fastest shutter speeds possible
(if you want to stop action).
You've probably been told to avoid fast
films because the colors aren't as bright
and the resulting pictures are grainy. It
used to be so but today's fast color films
are good enough for many pros to use
almost exclusively.
Have a happy game but do try for an
aisle seat. When the crowd in front goes
wild you don't want to wind up with a shot
of bobbing heads instead of the action.
