# Is There Only One Correct Exposure? No!
## 
### 
If you have a camera with no exposure
control or one that sets itself automati
cally with no provision for any manual
variation, you'll probably be very sat
isfied with almost all the prints or slides
you make.
But many more advanced cameras
today do allow you to vary your exposure,
either through auto-exposure compensa
tion dials or straight manual override.
Auto exposure or no exposure control,
cameras will generally yield an average
exposure picture. However, by giving less
exposure (using one or two smaller lens
openings or one or two faster shutter
speeds) or more exposure (setting your
camera in just the opposite manner) you
will produce different results that may
even be better (as the pictures shown here
illustrate). This is particularly true in con
trasty light situations.
If you do plan some exposure varia
tions, stick to color slide film. If you shoot
color print film, the processors will prob
ably correct your exposure variations in
printing and make all your shots of the
same subject look pretty much alike,
despite the exposure variations.
