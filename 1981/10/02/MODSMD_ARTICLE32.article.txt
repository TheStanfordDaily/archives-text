# What Type Of Camera Do You Need????

### 
Pocket 110 camera? Instant-picture
camera? All-weather camera? Sin
gle-lens reflex camera? Pocket 35
camera? Auto-focus camera?
They are all very different and serve dif
ferent functions and different users. It may
well be overkill if you've been persuaded
to buy a single-lens reflex when all you
want is a no-nonsense pocket camera
which means you can learn as little about
photography as possible.
Books have been written about proper
camera type selection. No matter —we're
going to reduce it all into five thumbnail
size sketches and descriptions. We might
not be able to accompany you all the way
to the proper choice, but at least we can
head you in the right direction.

35mm Single Lens Reflex (SLR)
You see what you get by viewing and
focusing right through the lens, be it a
wide-angle, normal, telephoto or zoom;
extremely versatile, available with manual
control, auto-exposure only, or auto
exposure plus manual override. But SLRs
are bulkier than pocket cameras or other
355, heavier, more expensive, more com
plex. take more care to use. Accessory list
is enormous with tully-coupled auto flash
and battery-powered auto winders heading

the list.

35mm Lens/Shutter Camera
Uses optical finder (like a miniature
telescope) for sighting, optical rangefind
er in some models for focusing. Lowest
priced models use simple scale: you guess
distance, then set footage marker accord
ingly and hope it's right.
Advantages include rugged, simple de
sign and lower-than-SLR cost, plus great
er compactness and lighter weight than
SLR. Models now available include built
in electronic (lash, auto-exposure, super
compact pocket versions, auto focusing.
But only a few high-priced camcras
offer interchangeable lenses. Good snap
shot cameras, however.

110 Camera
Tiny and super-tiny easy-to-load cam
era using miniature film size. There's a
wide range of models from simple box
camera equivalents to a single-lens reflex
and underwater types. Newer models have
built-in electronic flash, automatic expo
sure, built-in auto winders. Rugged, sim
ple, light and compact, the 110 turns out
good snapshots but small film size limits
sharpness of enlargements.

Instant Camera
If you must see your color prints within
minutes, the instants will deliver the
goods. Cameras tend to be bulky, lenses
slow. Cameras are fully automatic, film
fairly expensive, enlargements of poorer
quality. Great for making friends all over
the world, shooting at parties, weddings.

Underwater/All-Weather Cameras
Specially designed to withstand ele
ments, these auto-exposure cameras are
ideal for hunters, fishermen, sailors,
backpackers, when extremely rugged
camera is needed. Some are water resis
tant only; others can go to 15 ft. or so.
Only one, the Nikonos, is a true underwa
ter camera with interchangeable lenses!

If you load up with a fast (ASA 400)
film, you should be able to make good
exposure in reasonable light. For sharp
pictures with close-up lenses, you will
have to close your lens down to f/8 or
f/11, which means a fairly long exposure
if the light is poor. If your meter can't
handle such a low light level, you'll have
to experiment by making exposures at a
number of longish times until you find the
proper exposure.
Avoid using color print film for copying
if you are photographing a map or printed
matter. Instead, shoot black-and-white
negative or transparency material. View
the slides (or even the negatives) with a
projector or by means of a fairly powerful
(I OX or more) magnifier. If it's a negative
you will want to have a print made.
With careful copying, your transparen
cy or negative should have all the detail
from the original that you'll need.

going to reduce it all into five thumbnail
size sketches and descriptions. We might
not be able to accompany you all the way
to the proper choice, but at least we can
head you in the right direction.

35mm Single Lens Reflex (SLR)
You see what you get by viewing and
focusing right through the lens, be it a
wide-angle, normal, telephoto or zoom;
extremely versatile, available with manual
control, auto-exposure only, or auto
exposure plus manual override. But SLRs
are bulkier than pocket cameras or other
355, heavier, more expensive, more com
plex. take more care to use. Accessory list
is enormous with tully-coupled auto flash
and battery-powered auto winders heading

the list.

35mm Lens/Shutter Camera
Uses optical finder (like a miniature
telescope) for sighting, optical rangefind
er in some models for focusing. Lowest
priced models use simple scale: you guess
distance, then set footage marker accord
ingly and hope it's right.
Advantages include rugged, simple de
sign and lower-than-SLR cost, plus great
er compactness and lighter weight than
SLR. Models now available include built
in electronic (lash, auto-exposure, super
compact pocket versions, auto focusing.
But only a few high-priced camcras
offer interchangeable lenses. Good snap
shot cameras, however.

110 Camera
Tiny and super-tiny easy-to-load cam
era using miniature film size. There's a
wide range of models from simple box
camera equivalents to a single-lens reflex
and underwater types. Newer models have
built-in electronic flash, automatic expo
sure, built-in auto winders. Rugged, sim
ple, light and compact, the 110 turns out
good snapshots but small film size limits
sharpness of enlargements.

Instant Camera
If you must see your color prints within
minutes, the instants will deliver the
goods. Cameras tend to be bulky, lenses
slow. Cameras are fully automatic, film
fairly expensive, enlargements of poorer
quality. Great for making friends all over
the world, shooting at parties, weddings.

Underwater/All-Weather Cameras
Specially designed to withstand ele
ments, these auto-exposure cameras are
ideal for hunters, fishermen, sailors,
backpackers, when extremely rugged
camera is needed. Some are water resis
tant only; others can go to 15 ft. or so.
Only one, the Nikonos, is a true underwa
ter camera with interchangeable lenses!

If you load up with a fast (ASA 400)
film, you should be able to make good
exposure in reasonable light. For sharp
pictures with close-up lenses, you will
have to close your lens down to f/8 or
f/11, which means a fairly long exposure
if the light is poor. If your meter can't
handle such a low light level, you'll have
to experiment by making exposures at a
number of longish times until you find the
proper exposure.
Avoid using color print film for copying
if you are photographing a map or printed
matter. Instead, shoot black-and-white
negative or transparency material. View
the slides (or even the negatives) with a
projector or by means of a fairly powerful
(I OX or more) magnifier. If it's a negative
you will want to have a print made.
With careful copying, your transparen
cy or negative should have all the detail
from the original that you'll need.






Pocket 110 camera? Instant-picture
camera? All-weather camera? Sin
gle-lens reflex camera? Pocket 35
camera? Auto-focus camera?
They are all very different and serve dif
ferent functions and different users. It may
well be overkill if you've been persuaded
to buy a single-lens reflex when all you
want is a no-nonsense pocket camera
which means you can learn as little about
photography as possible.
Books have been written about proper
camera type selection. No matter —we're
going to reduce it all into five thumbnail
