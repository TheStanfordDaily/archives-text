# Closeups And Copying: School Aids
## 
### 
Have a lab experiment you want to
preserve before you break it down?
Do you need a copy of a map,
drawing or painting but can't get it
to a copying machine? Is there some mate
rial in a book that you can only glom onto
for a few hours? The answer is to copy it or
shoot a close-up with your camera. You
can use any camera, except pocket cam
eras—the negatives or transparencies
made with them are generally too small to
carry enough information—for copying
and close-ups.
Most 35mm SLRs focus as close as 18
to 24 in., which may be enough for some
copying and close-up work. Other cam
eras reach 3 ft., which is usually too far.
Close-up lenses are by far the simplest
and most convenient accessory to allow
you to focus nearer than the regular mini
mum distance of your camera. They're
easiest to use on an SLR, since you can
thread one over your normal lens and
focus right through the finder. Close-up
lenses are generally available in three
major strengths: +1, +2 and +3.
While we could give you the distances
at which the close-up lenses will allow you
to work, what you really need to know is
how large an area the close-up lens will
take in when fitted on your normal lens.
For a 50mm normal camera lens a + 1

close-up lens will cover a subject from 9 { A
xl 4 in. to 18 5 /8 x2B in. depending on
the focus setting of the camera. A +2 will
allow areas from 6 ] A x 9 I A in. to 9 3 /h x
14 in., while a+ 3 will get you from 4Vi x
6 7 / sin. to 6'/4 x 9-Vs in.
These close-up lenses can be combined
for even closer work with smaller areas.
It's now simply a matter of choosing the
right close-up lens depending on the size
of your subject area you want covered. For
instance, if you were copying a map in a
book which was 8 x 10'/2 in., a +2 close
up lens would do nicely.
With a single-lens reflex camera, mak
ing a close-up is no more complicated than
lining up the camera and subject and
shooting. Use the built-in, or a hand-held,
meter recommendation for the correct
exposure.
While close-up and copying lighting
can get very complicated, even, shadow
less daylight from a window (or from a
skylight in a library reading room) will do.
With cameras other than SLRs, follow
the directions that come with the close-up
lenses as to proper camera distance set
tings and actual distance from the subject.
If you don't have a single-lens reflex, you
won't be able to rely on your viewlinder to
show you just what will be framed in the
close-up picture. Instead, measure care
fully from the very center of your camera
lens to the very center of your subject
using a rigid or coiled metal tape.
How can you hold the camera steady
enough, particularly if you need a longish
exposure and you don't have a tripod or
copy stand? The accompanying pictures
show you just how to do this with books as
supports for the subject and camera.
