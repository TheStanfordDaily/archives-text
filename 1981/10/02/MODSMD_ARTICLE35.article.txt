Ready to buy an accessory lens but
confused by all the brands? Here
with a short, short, three part
course in lensiana.
Camera maker's lenses: Your safest
bet, since they were made specifically to
work with your camera and are generally
of top mechanical and optical quality. If
the lens does not work properly with the
camera, only one single company is re
sponsible for straightening matters out.
Independent maker's lenses: Some

times less expensive (but camera makers
are now offering budget-priced lenses that
are remarkably inexpensive). Independent
makers' lenses often have special features
such as close focusing or compact design
possibly not available on the camera mak
er's lenses. Make certain you buy a well
known independent maker's lens.
Unknown maker's lenses: Many
stores try to save money or offer rock
bottom prices by purchasing lenses.from
small importers or they may even import
lenses under their own label. (It's a simple
business to have a lens identification ring
engraved with almost any name and make
and then to thread it into an off-brand
optic.) These lenses may be OK, but store
importers don't have the wherewithal to
test the lenses —and so quality can vary
remarkably, repair parts may not be avail
able or be stocked for only a short time.
These are garbage lenses and are best
avoided regardless of price.
