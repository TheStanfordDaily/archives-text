# Getting Blurry Pictures? Here's Why
## 
### 
If you're getting blurry pictures, here's
a quick checklist you can use to iden
tify the problem:
1. Whole picture area blurred but
some pictures more than others.
Causes: Not holding camera steady at time
of exposure; too slow a shutter speed; dirty
lens.
2. Main subject blurred but fore
ground or background OK. Cause:

Improper focus, either the camera's fault
or your mistake. If focus is still off after
you focus carefully and shoot next time,
have camera checked.
3. All pictures blurred about the
same amount. Possible cause: Crummy
camera. Have your dealer check to make
sure and then, if indeed it's crummy, ditch
the heap.
4. Close subjects blurred with non
focusing camera. Cause: Using camera at
a closer distance than it was designed for.
Back off!!
5. Prints look slightly soft. Possible
cause: Color printer can be out of focus.
Check sharpness of your negs with mag
nifier. If they're sharp, have photofinisher
make prints over.
