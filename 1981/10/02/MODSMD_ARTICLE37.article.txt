# Don't Get Stung When Buying

With an almost endless array of
cameras offered, and sources
varying from your local dealer
to distant mail-order firms, buy
ing an expensive item like a camera can be
a rewarding experience or a nightmare.
Here are some tips, found out the hard
way, to guide yoj through the maze of
desire to the glories of happy owner
ship.
Learning what you want: Ask knowl
edgeable friends who are happy with their
cameras. Read all the photo magazine test
reports and camera literature you can.
Handle the camera yourself. Look at your
friends' results. Do you think they're
good? Go to a store, ask to see similar
cameras. If some other camera looks bet
ter and seems a better deal, don't go for it
on the spot. Take time to think. Ask others
about the camera. Read up on it. Make
sure any camera you select is convenient
to use and handle.
Selecting the right store: Most photo
stores near campuses are reliable because
bad ones are quickly put out of business by
word of mouth. Ask your knowledgeable
friends what stores they deal with. Yes,
you probably pay more than at a big dis

count or mail order store but you will get
better service right where you are.
You can buy by mail from the big stores
that advertise in photo magazines such as
Modern Photography, but ask your
friends for the names of reliable ones
they've dealt with. Don't be surprised if
there are delays in getting your equipment
because the mail-order stores are out of
stock or they try to persuade you to switch
brands. Stick to your guns. The advantage
of mail order shopping is big savings.
Catalog houses are reliable, although
prices are slightly higher. Big-city gift
shops and stores handling all sorts of gen
eral merchandise such as watches, rugs,
tape recorders, radios can be real gyp art
ists with exhorbitant prices and discontin
ued merchandise. Beware of unknown
brands: Quality may vary or be poor, and
repairs almost impossible.
Buying the camera: Try to get a cam
era in an unopened box if possible. Cam
eras come with various accessories: bat
teries, lens caps, cleaning cloths, which
mysteriously disappear from opened box
es. Have the dealer open the camera box
and try all controls at all settings before
you pay your money. If something isn't
working properly, ask for another camera.
Examine the store warranty carefully. If
the merchandise is faulty, does the store
promise to give you your money back or
exchange the camera? How many days do
you have? Many stores promise nothing
and refuse to have anything to do with a
non-functioning camera after it's sold!
Checking the camera: Once you and

the camera are back in your room, do not
fill out the warranty card that comes with
the camera until you have tried the camera
with film, have seen the results and are
satisfied. Most camera stores won't accept
a camera back for exchange if the warran
ty card has been filled out. Load the cam
era with slide film (print film can still
yield reasonable prints even if the camera
underexposes or overexposes). Improper
exposure will immediately show up on
slides. Shoot pictures under all sorts of
light in conditions indoors and out at clos
est focus, at middle distances and at infin
ity. Try it at every possible setting. If you
can, make all your tests with a tripod.
Examine your processed slides with a
slide projector or with the aid of a good
magnifier of at least 5X power. Pictures
should be well exposed, the main subjects
and detail crisp. Fill in the warranty card
only after you're certain there is no nag
ging doubt in your mind about anything
connected with the camera.



1. Image sharpness, lens distance scale should
agree if not, there's trouble
2. Check camera body for dents, nicks in leather
bare metal spots
3. Lens openings should change smoothly, front
surface be scratch free
4. Check all shutter settings Problems usually
show up at slow speeds

reports and camera literature you can.
Handle the camera yourself. Look at your
friends' results. Do you think they're
good? Go to a store, ask to see similar
cameras. If some other camera looks bet
ter and seems a better deal, don't go for it
on the spot. Take time to think. Ask others
about the camera. Read up on it. Make
sure any camera you select is convenient
to use and handle.
Selecting the right store: Most photo
stores near campuses are reliable because
bad ones are quickly put out of business by
word of mouth. Ask your knowledgeable
friends what stores they deal with. Yes,
you probably pay more than at a big dis

count or mail order store but you will get
better service right where you are.
You can buy by mail from the big stores
that advertise in photo magazines such as
Modern Photography, but ask your
friends for the names of reliable ones
they've dealt with. Don't be surprised if
there are delays in getting your equipment
because the mail-order stores are out of
stock or they try to persuade you to switch
brands. Stick to your guns. The advantage
of mail order shopping is big savings.
Catalog houses are reliable, although
prices are slightly higher. Big-city gift
shops and stores handling all sorts of gen
eral merchandise such as watches, rugs,
tape recorders, radios can be real gyp art
ists with exhorbitant prices and discontin
ued merchandise. Beware of unknown
brands: Quality may vary or be poor, and
repairs almost impossible.
Buying the camera: Try to get a cam
era in an unopened box if possible. Cam
eras come with various accessories: bat
teries, lens caps, cleaning cloths, which
mysteriously disappear from opened box
es. Have the dealer open the camera box
and try all controls at all settings before
you pay your money. If something isn't
working properly, ask for another camera.
Examine the store warranty carefully. If
the merchandise is faulty, does the store
promise to give you your money back or
exchange the camera? How many days do
you have? Many stores promise nothing
and refuse to have anything to do with a
non-functioning camera after it's sold!
Checking the camera: Once you and

the camera are back in your room, do not
fill out the warranty card that comes with
the camera until you have tried the camera
with film, have seen the results and are
satisfied. Most camera stores won't accept
a camera back for exchange if the warran
ty card has been filled out. Load the cam
era with slide film (print film can still
yield reasonable prints even if the camera
underexposes or overexposes). Improper
exposure will immediately show up on
slides. Shoot pictures under all sorts of
light in conditions indoors and out at clos
est focus, at middle distances and at infin
ity. Try it at every possible setting. If you
can, make all your tests with a tripod.
Examine your processed slides with a
slide projector or with the aid of a good
magnifier of at least 5X power. Pictures
should be well exposed, the main subjects
and detail crisp. Fill in the warranty card
only after you're certain there is no nag
ging doubt in your mind about anything
connected with the camera.
