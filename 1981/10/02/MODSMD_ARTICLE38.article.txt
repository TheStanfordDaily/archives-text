# Muck On Your Lens? It Isn't Always Easy To Remove
## 
### 
Lenses seem to attract dirt magically.
Tromp across a dusty campus with
your lens exposed and you'll get a
fine coating of dust. Fiddle with the
camera and, inevitably, you'll have a nice
greasy thumbprint on the lens or finder.
Use a dirty lens and you'll get soft pictures
and probably lens flare as light hits the
muck and bounces around inside the lens
and camera instead of traveling straight to
the film.
In years past, when no one was looking,
many a lens was cleaned with the end of a
tie or the corner of a handkerchief (some
times not too clean). That spread the dust
or grease around nicely. Luckily, few stu
dents today wear ties or carry cloth hand
kerchiefs.

include Kleenex tissue, lens
chamois and lens brush.

Lens tissue is always being recom
mended for cleaning lenses: who but the
constant gadget-bag toter carries it? Even
pros can't find it in their camera bags
when they need it. Small lens brushes
available at photo stores are very handy
for removing non-clinging dust from
lenses, but you may have forgotten the
brush too or probably can't find it. (Hint
on buying brushes: Don't buy a paint
brush thinking it's cheaper than a lens
brush. Some paint brushes are treated with
oil to preserve them or to maintain their

shape. You need a pristinely clean brush
for a lens.)
For removing surface dust, facial tissue
works well. (We can vouch for Kleenex as
a brand with less lint than many others.)
Replacing dust with lint fibers is a step in
the right direction but a dustless, lintless
lens is even better.
To remove dust, roll up a small piece of
facial tissue and use it on the lens surface
like a brush, in a circular motion. Don't
apply pressure on the lens surface with
your finger behind the tissue. That will
only serve to grind the dust into the glass
surface.
A grease spot such as a fingermark on a
lens is not so easy to remove completely.
Buy some lens cleaner and keep it around
your room for whenever it's needed or, if
you're around a chem lab, a touch a alco
hol will do it when applied with the facial
tissue or a wad of cotton. Don't moisten
too much. The lens surface should not
become wet or moisture may seep under
neath the lens ring and into the lens.
Water with a touch of a liquid detergent
soap is another way to go for lens clean
ing. Remember to wash off the detergent
afterwards with a damp tissue.
One of our favorite materials for lens
cleaning is chamois, the softened skin of a
special sheep. You can usually get a small
chamois at an optician. Use it like you
would a facial tissue. Keep it clean in a
plastic bag. Chamois and a tiny bit of alco
hol or lens cleaning fluid makes a good
grease-removing combination.
What about eyeglass tissues? There has
been a great deal of argument even among
optical experts as to whether the silicon in
eyeglass tissues damages coated lens sur-
you use it constantly, we think
there may be some chance of lens damage,
but we would have no compunction about
using it gently very occasionally.
Reminder: Lenses have two exposed
ends—the front, which you will remem
ber to clean, and the rear, which you
won't. Rear lens elements, especially if
you have an interchangeable-lens camera,
need almost as much attention as the front.
Since they are within the camera, you can
be lulled into thinking they are clean when
they are not. Never put a lens on a camera
without looking at the rear for dust or
grease.
Don't neglect the camera's viewfinder.
They collect eyelash grease constantly
(also fingerprints) and make clear, sharp
viewing a near impossibility.

keep one handy? You should.
