# Holding Steady And How?????
## 
### 
Whether you've got a simple pock
et 110 or a super camera, you'll
get blurred pictures unless you
learn to hold the camera steady.
Even a fast shutter speed won't guarantee
you sharp shots. Here's how pros get
them. (Beware of drawings or pictures in
some camera instruction book purporting
to show how to hold a camera. Many are
wrong!)
With allO pocket camera, grasp the
ends between thumbs and first and second
fingers. Hold to your eye. Place the most
convenient finger over the shutter release.
Press your thumbs upwards against the
center of camera while pulling down
slightly on the ends with your other fin
gers—as if you were going to snap the
camera in half.
For verticals, it's everyone for himself!
Few pocket cameras are easy to hold for
verticals so try various two-handed posi
tions until you find a comfortable one.
Suggestion: Use your forehead to brace
the camera. Press the shutter release gent
ly with a smooth, even pressure.

With a 35mm camera, grasp camera
and controls completely in your right
hand, as if you weren't going to use your
left at all. Now bring your left hand, with
palm open, under the left side of the cam
era. Rest camera in your left palm and
grasp the lens from underneath between
your left hand's first and second finger.
Use these fingers to turn the lens mount
for focusing.
Hold the camera to your eye. Bring
your elbows into your body and dig them
in as much as you can for support. Use
your left hand to support the camera and
your right to aim the camera and work the
controls.
(If you have a non-focusing or auto
focusing 35mm camera, you needn't
grasp the lens mount. Just keep your hand
underneath the camera.)
Ready to shoot? Breathe gently. (No,
you don't have to stop breathing!) Keep
your feet about 10 inches or so apart for
good support. Don't lock your knees.
Press the shutter release so gently that
someone standing next to you wouldn't
even be able to notice that you did it.
OK, you made it. Practice will make
perfect —but remember to stay cool,
calm, and collected no matter what the
excitement around you. And dig those
elbows in!
