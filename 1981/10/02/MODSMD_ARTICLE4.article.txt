recording an album now, which will he out
in October, or early next year.
About a year and a half ago you did a
cover story on Jeff Bridges, and in it
he talked about Cutter & Bone, a
movie I've been looking for ever since (I
read the book and liked it very much). I've
seen some reviews of the movie, so I know
it must exist somewhere. What happened?
Will it ever play Des Moines?

The film's title has been changed to
Cutter's Way,, it was entered in (and won)
the Houston Film Festival and has recently
opened in New York, Boston and Seattle
<doing excellent business in all 3 cities). It
was scheduled to open in Atlanta and Los
Angeles by late September — but not Des
Moines. Don 't give up

the third installment of allegedly funny
movies from the outfit. But if United Artists
has its way, Joy of Sex will be the second

poon Goes to tlx> Movies, a four-pan satire
of movie genres, is considered so dreadful
it may not be released at all. It tested poorly
(even with one of the four segments re
moved), and may end up on pay TV. What
with Heaven's Gate suffering a similar fate,
it hasn t beer. UA s year. Small wonder the

catch: Bounced Checks (also the title of a

Midler) and the previously unreleased tale
of cocktail lounge dissolution, "The Piano

begin work on a brand new album as soon
as Waits' soundtrack work is complete on
One From the Heart. Describing that year
long (remember glimpsing Tom on the

minister.
Clipped & Cut Down to Size
Hyperkinetic actor Jeff Goldblum (Be
tween the lines, Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, Tenspeed and Brownshoe), made
a stop recently at Artistic Hair Designs, a
grubby little parlor favored by many of
L.A.'s punk and new wave performers,
where he got clipped in a classic Fifties
style — slick on the sides and tall on toP
"He asked me questions the whole time,
moans the shop's stylist, then, when he
saw how it looked, he made me write out a
list of everyplace where he could buy Tifties
clothes to go with his haircut!

HOW DID THE NEVILLE BROTHERS, one of the
tightest bands in American history but
so far unable to make a strong sales tally,
score a contract from so unlikely a label as
A&M Records? It turns out that Bette Midler
caught the New Orleans funk & roll outfit
which once toured with the Rolling Stones
and backed a Paul McCartney record date
at a nightclub in their home town. So im
pressed was the Divine Miss M that she rat
tled long distance wires the next day with a
close friend in A&M's executive suite. In
tribute, the Nevilles (Art, Aaron, Charles and
Cyril) dedicate a hymn-like version of
"Mona Lisa" to Ms. Midler on their LP, which
features a flaming crocodile on the cover
and is called Fiyo on the Bayou.
Midler finally finished that film about
romance and gambling, which had four
name changes and is now called Jinxed

Elvis Encore
At least two more movies are planned on
the life of Elvis Presley (we can wait): E,
based on Jerry Jopkins' book Elvis: The
Final Years, will roll this winter, with Joe
Esposito, Presley's long time friend, as
technical advisor. The other project is based
on Albert Goldman's soon-to-be-published
work called Ellis, reportedly full of dope
and sex and cheap thrills. There have been
five Elvis flicks so far (but don't quote us;
the count is unofficial): Elvis on lour, Elvis:
That's the Way It Is; Elvis (the TV' movie with
Kurt Russell); Elvis and the Beauty Queen,
also on TV; and David Wolper's recent
docudrama, This Is Elvis.
Some Music News
Linda ronstadt decided she didn't want to
release the album we've all been wait
ing for, the one produced by Jerry Wex
ler with tunes from long ago. She didn't like
it (and neither did most of the people who
heard it). Instead she'll cut another pop
album with regular producer and manager
Peter Asher, and will start filming Pirates of
Penzance early next year. This is the sec
ond album she's nixed in its final stages:

remember the Dolly Parton/Emmylou
Harris/Ronstadt collaboration?
EACii.ES' management swears the group has
not broken up, but is simply on an "ex
tended vacation," during which Henley is
working on a solo album and Glenn l'ie\
hits produced new artist Lou Ann Barton s
first record, Old Enough, described as bar

room brawling" music. Lindsay Bucking
ham s first solo, Law and Order, will be
out in late October. His group, Fleetwood
Mac, recently reconvened in Paris to diddle
in a recording studio, but they re back in
LA now. Why Paris? "Because it cost more,"
commented' a disgruntled industry ob
server.
Grand funk railroao has re-formed (but
not, we're promised, reformed);
guitarist Mark Farner and drummer Don
Brewer have joined with new guy Dennis
Bellinger on bass, and their first record to
gether will lie on Full Moon, distributed b\
Warner Bros.
It's Hard Not to Love this Man
SCREENWRITER LAWRENCE KASIMN. about to
finish up his script of Return of the Jcdi,
may then segue to Bodyguard, a project
originally set to star Diana Ross and R\an
O'Neal (but no more). Our favorite quote
of the week is from Kasdan: while dining at
a health food restaurant, he removed a
handful of sprouts from his sandwich,
looked at the green mass disdainfully and
said, "I hate this stuff; it's like going down
I on an alien."



Michael jackson and paul mccartney
may not be the duo of the century, but

Jackson journeyed to Mac's farm in Scotland
where they both worked on material for

HOW DID THE NEVILLE BROTHERS, one of the
tightest bands in American history but
so far unable to make a strong sales tally,
score a contract from so unlikely a label as
A&M Records? It turns out that Bette Midler
caught the New Orleans funk & roll outfit

at a nightclub in their home town. So im

HOW DID THE NEVILLE BROTHERS, one of the
tightest bands in American history but
so far unable to make a strong sales tally,
score a contract from so unlikely a label as
A&M Records? It turns out that Bette Midler
caught the New Orleans funk & roll outfit
which once toured with the Rolling Stones
and backed a Paul McCartney record date
at a nightclub in their home town. So im
pressed was the Divine Miss M that she rat
tled long distance wires the next day with a
close friend in A&M's executive suite. In
tribute, the Nevilles (Art, Aaron, Charles and
Cyril) dedicate a hymn-like version of
"Mona Lisa" to Ms. Midler on their LP, which
features a flaming crocodile on the cover
and is called Fiyo on the Bayou.
Midler finally finished that film about
romance and gambling, which had four
name changes and is now called Jinxed

Elvis Encore
At least two more movies are planned on
the life of Elvis Presley (we can wait): E,
based on Jerry Jopkins' book Elvis: The
Final Years, will roll this winter, with Joe
Esposito, Presley's long time friend, as
technical advisor. The other project is based
on Albert Goldman's soon-to-be-published
work called Ellis, reportedly full of dope
and sex and cheap thrills. There have been
five Elvis flicks so far (but don't quote us;
the count is unofficial): Elvis on lour, Elvis:
That's the Way It Is; Elvis (the TV' movie with
Kurt Russell); Elvis and the Beauty Queen,
also on TV; and David Wolper's recent
docudrama, This Is Elvis.
Some Music News
Linda ronstadt decided she didn't want to

it (and neither did most of the people who
heard it). Instead she'll cut another pop
album with regular producer and manager
Peter Asher, and will start filming Pirates of
Penzance early next year. This is the sec

HOW DID THE NEVILLE BROTHERS, one of the
tightest bands in American history but
so far unable to make a strong sales tally,
score a contract from so unlikely a label as
A&M Records? It turns out that Bette Midler
caught the New Orleans funk & roll outfit
which once toured with the Rolling Stones
and backed a Paul McCartney record date
at a nightclub in their home town. So im
pressed was the Divine Miss M that she rat
tled long distance wires the next day with a

tribute, the Nevilles (Art, Aaron, Charles and

the third installment of allegedly funny

has its way, Joy of Sex will be the second

it may not be released at all. It tested poorly
