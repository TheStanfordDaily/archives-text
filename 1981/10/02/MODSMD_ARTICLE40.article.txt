Move in close: Many pictures are
taken from too great a distance
so that the main subject—and
the point of the picture—is lost.
Try taking pictures of people at distances
from about six to eight feet for full figures,
three feet or less for faces. And don't for
get to shift your camera to vertical from
horizontal to make the most use of the
length of your area.
Move up or down: Don't always shoot
from eye-level. Maybe a low viewpoint
would dramatize your subject and remove
cluttered background. Before you snap,
move around to find a more interesting
approach.

light is, perhaps, the worst possible light

you are looking for a specific effect,

avoid trees and telephone poles growing
out of heads.

less of the camera you use, s-q-u-e-e-z-e
the shutter release gently. Don't rock the
camera. Above all, don't jerk the camera
as you press the release.
