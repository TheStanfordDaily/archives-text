# Carry Camera At All Times? You're No Twit
## 
### 
A few years ago. anyone who always
carried a camera would get razzed
into total embarrassment. Every
one made fun of the ardent camera
fan Cartoonists had a great time at his
expense.
It's changing fast. More and more seri
ous photographers on campus and off car
ry a camera at all times because they real
ize that ideal picture taking possibilities
don't just occur at the rare instances you
might decide to take pictures on vacations
and weekends. A college campus is load
ed with quick vignettes, scenics and can
dids well worth shooting.
But you don't have to be a serious pho
tographer to qualify as a constant camera
toter Try carrying a camera yourself for a
few days and see if it doesn't pay off. You
may get some kidding—until the guy or
gal doing it sees some picture possibility
they want you to shoot.
A few words of advice. Don't carry the
camera closed up in its case. "Never
ready" cases are just obstacles to be over
come before you can actually use the cam
era. Take the camera out of the case com
pletely and carry it over your shoulder
with the neckstrap. However if your case
comes apart in two pieces and you can
remove the front part that goes over the
lens and top camera controls, do so.
Keep your camera on a setting which
would allow you to shoot quickly. The
speed should be 1/125 sec. or faster with

the focus set to 15 ft. or so. Shoot any
fast-changing scene quickly at the preset
exposure, and then fiddle with the controls
for a better shot.
When traveling around campus, if you
don't think you'll be taking pictures,
move the carrying strap over your head
and carry the strap across your chest. It's
safer than dangling the camera from one
shoulder. When you think you'll be shoot
ing pictures, the camera should be around
your neck at chest level where you can
grab it quickly.
