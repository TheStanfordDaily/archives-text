# Snapshots From Your TV
## 
### 
Always wanted a snapshot of some
favorite TV movie scene? Is there
some cable TV subject that you'd
like on a print? Or perhaps it's
some shot a friend has on a video cassette
you want to preserve With your still cam
era you can shoot the picture right off the
TV screen, and in color too!
Tune your set for the best reception pos
sible and adjust the contrast so that you get
detail in both shadows and highlight The
contrast should be somewhat less than you
have for viewing.
Reduce your room lighting, taking care
that no light is reflected in the screen.

Move your camera as close to the screen
as it can go and still give you the complete
TV image sharply. Use a close-up lens if
necessary.
Load your camera with ASA 400 film.
Set your shutter speed at 1 /30 sec. If you
have a focal-plane-shutter camera (most
single-lens reflexes are such) set your
shutter speed at 1/8 sec. Do not use a fast
er speed (1 /60 sec., for example) or you
will only get a part of the TV image. With
a speed of 1/H sec., be sure to put your
camera on a tripod or other support
With adjustable cameras, typical set
tings using 4(X)-speed films (either color
or black-and-white) are 1/30 sec. at 1/4 or
I x sec. at f/8.
Since television sets differ as to image
brightness, you may have to make some
test shots Keep a record of exposures and
settings for your television set so that you
develop a standard procedure. If you're
shooting in color, your slides or prints will
be slightly bluish. II it bothers you, order a
CC4OR gelatin filter from your photo
dealer and hold it in front of your camera
lens. Give one stop more exposure.
