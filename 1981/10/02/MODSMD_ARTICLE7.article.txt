# 40,000 Pay Tribute to Marley & Reggae
## 
### Jeff Silberman 
Steel Pulse, Eeka Mouse, Lloyd Parks and
We the People Band, Barrington Levy and
Black Uhuru aren't exactly household
names to the average music fan. But they
were the highlights of Sunsplash '81, a
four-day reggae marathon held in Montego
bay from August 5 to 9. Billed as a tribute
to Bob Marley, the Fourth Annual
Sunsplash featured more than 35 acts to
dispel the notion that Marley's passing sig
naled also the death of reggae as a viable
musical force. Attendance reportedly sur
passed 20,000, With 226 foreign journalists
coming from as far as Italy and Japan.
Sunsplash also signaled the recognition
of reggae as an official Jamaican export.
After three years of financial struggling by
independent festival promoters, the
Jamaican government took over the pro
ductions reins. The Jamaican Cultural De
velopment Commission sold all film and
video rights to a production company
headed by Michael Butler, who produced
the Broadway play Hair, for a sum repor
tedly more than $2,000,000. Butler's crew
shot more than 300 hours of videotape,
which will be transferred to a film called
Reggae Tribute for theatrical release. Gar
land Jeffreys will narrate what will be a
tribute to Bob Marley and reggae in
general.
The JCDC's financial windfall wasnt a
perfect blessing for festival goers. Camera
men, using sophisticated mobile equip
ment, occasionally got in the way of the
performers, eliminating some of the spon
taneity and intimacy of the event. Some ar
tists, like Jimmy Cliff, wanted a piece of the
action outside of the performance fees.
They weren't taped. Also, the promoters
wanted the shows to last from 7 p.m. till
midnight, so the sizable tourist contingent
could spend the wee hours sampling Mon
tego Bay's nightlife. But a power shortage
delayed opening night, and reggae's legen
dary "soon come" reputation had the

shows start from 10:00 p.m. on anu last
until at least 4:30 a.m. The final night lasted
until 8:30 in the morning.
Except for the headliners, the basic for
mat had a backup band playing for a
number of singers, doing from one to five
songs each. Invariably, the quality of the
backing group determined the effective
ness of the featured artist. Opening night
started slowly with the Children of God,
who backed up three slick but unsubstan
tial acts and Errol Scorcher. Clad in a mock
uniform, Scorcher revealed a flippant stage
attitude that was the festival ice-breaker.
Steel Pulse was the first real highlight.
The British group combined a strong, pul
sating beat with topics like George Jackson,
South Africa and the KKK to produce a po
tent brew. Their colorful attire made them
a visual as well as musical treat. From that
peak came a valley, not so much in singer
Marcia Griffiths, but in her lackluster bac
kup band John Ace. Nonetheless Griffith
had a fine voice and a relaxed stage style.
She was followed by Jimmy Riley, who was
one of the better practitioners of a polished
reggae style.
Riley and the remaining acts were
backed by reggae's best rhythm section, Sly
Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare. They
provided an airtight foundation for the
night's two other highlights, Eeka Mouse
and Black Uhuru. Mouse only did one tune,
the current Number One single in Jamaica,
"Waa Doo Dah," a refreshingly silly ditty
about chasing a "virgin bird.'' Posing like a
natty stork, he ignited the crowd with his
send-up of a sex symbol. Black Uhuru was
a powerful trio who sang of sex, politics
and their current hit, "Stalk of Sinsemilla.
Already popular in Britain, Uhuru served
notice that they're ready for America.
Thursday night offered no real high
lights. The best act was Judy Mowatt, who
with Griffith and Rita Marley, make up the
I-Three's. She too had a marvelous voice
and was an elegant visual stylist. Jimmy Clifl
was good but not in peak form.

Friday night was the best. The Mighty
Diamonds got things off on the right foot
with their classy brand of deep harmonies
and inviting melodies. But the surprise of
the evening was Lloyd Parkes and VCe the
People Band, a hard-hitting outfit led by a
thunderous horn section. Saxophonist
Dean Frazier's solo rendition of Marleys
"Redemption Song waS spine-tingling.
Tapper Zuki had to follow that, anil he
couldn't compete. Barrington Levy did,
however. Nattily attired in a white suit, the
young singer put on a sparkling display of
smooth, sensuous reggae. He could be
Jamaica's Michael Jackson.
The headliner was Third World, but their
reggae was strained by rock excesses like
drum solos. Saving their set was the encore
appearance of Stevie Wonder. Starting .it
5:30 a.m. with "Master Blaster," Wonder
elevated the tired crowd into a state of ecs
tacy. He projected an intensity with Happy
Birthday" and a moving version of "Rede
mption Song.
Saturday was anticlimactic. Chalice tried
to be both melodramatic and funny, the lat
ter worked and the former didn't. The
highlight was Dennis Brown, whose playful
reggae style was helped by the We the
People Band.
Bob Marley s children, the Melody Mak
ers, did have a sentimental allure, but they
were pushing too hard. The 1-Threes made
a fine appearance, highlighted by a moving
version of "That's How Strong My Love Is."
The festival ended with the Wallers doing
Marley classics with Junior Murvin singing.
It only emphasized their lack of magnetism
without Bob Marley.
Whether reggae will again have such a
charismatic figure, no one knows. But
Sutuplasb 'HI proved that reggae's supply
of vitality remains abundant.
