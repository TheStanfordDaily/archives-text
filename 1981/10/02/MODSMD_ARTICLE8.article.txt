# The
						20-Minute Quivering Bush... & Other Student Film Treats
## 
### P. Gregory Springer 
For ten minutes, an Australian ferny
shrub has quivered and blurred
through a nervous camera lens
Behind the screen a soundtrack of
chainsaws and warbles blares into
the audience
The crowd in the 1800-seat Michigan
Theatre does not approve Cut!'
shouts an irate viewer in the balcony
I confess shrieks another A helium
balloon is released from the main
floor, slowh obscuring a dark path
through the shaking foliage in its as
cent, and the audience approves with
applause
When Paul tinkler s film Sydney-
Bush finally ends a few minutes later, a
roar resounds in ire and aggravation,
but no one is surprised or unnerved
by such deafening events. The 19-year
historv of the Ann Arbor Film Festival
has been speckled with many more
outrageous moments
Magic Pillou a 12-minute dream
state by Lyn Gerry, made a deceptively
simple start with a shot of her bed.
Gradually, as Arabic drones accumu
lated over the increasingly thick
layered special effects, an altered state
settles over the audience, the first posi
tive psychedelic experience since the
Master's Program at Harvard, circa
1962
Bottle I '[> and Go showed black res
idents in rural Alabama who spend the
day canning green peaches, making
whistle noises on empty pop bottles,
and watching a distorted television.
Sometimes they sit outside on rocking
chairs and speak in Ozu-like platitudes
of indeciferable comfort As documen
taries go, this one discovered the Lost
World Inside America.
Curious Phenomena, by experi
enced film techno Stan Vanderbeek,
delivered a state-of-the-art glimpse at
computer animation, taking three
dimensionality and actual photo
graphic realism into new possibilities
with sheerly generated images, marred
only by a routine cosmic soundtrack.
Maternal Filigree, by Sandra Davis,
copped Brakhage s silent, fleeting,
ironic style with brief moments of
veiled femininity and plastic dolls
falling out of broken eggs At 21 min
utes, one empathized with the eternity
of birth.
White Silence was not the strobe
light whoosh lobotomy predicted. In
stead, a polar bear paces at the zoo for
IS minutes
Ritual quietly detailed the condo
housewife's method of French cuisine
She ties her sharpest knife to the un
locked door, ropes herself before
it, and lets fate decide whether the
dinner timer will ring before her hus
band bounces home from work
Even Hitchcock didn't dream of that
perversity.
Oldtlmers recall when Andy Warhol
instigated festivities at Ann Arbor in
the Sixties Others remember the ten
sorship uproar caused by Jack Smith s
llatning Creatures, the confiscated
transvestite classic. Whenever this par
ticular festival has been held, some
element of avant enters, whether it's
Pat Oleszco s nude and costumed per
formance art intermissions or just a
general lobby ambience of weirdness
It's a tradition.

What's become of experimental film
art? Whither innovation? With more
and more film schools teaching the
fundamentals of the movie industrv
rather than allowing for creative trial
and error, are we to expect a genera
tion of Smoky and the Bandit, Pan
Two clones? Whence cometh our next
Werner Herzog? Our new wave?
Fear not. Ann Arbor, or one of the
other yearly exhibition marathons, will
discover its maker. Every year hun
dreds of student and would-be
filmmakers submit their creations for
scrutiny, abuse, applause, and some
times cash awards to these various fes
tivals David Lynch, before making
F.raserhead and The Elephant Man,
circulated a weird incest-dream item
called GratidmotlxT Others became
h<x)ked on the festival treadmill, mak
ing 10-minute art snippets throughout
their lives.
One veteran film experimentalist,
Standish Lawder, presented his new
film at Ann Arbor this March, entitled
Regeneration It consisted entirely of a
baby being born, in reverse motion It
was not considered an advance.
Athens International Film Festival,
held yearly in April at Ohio University
in Athens, has come closest to usurp
ing Ann Arbor's throne By including
day long screenings, simultaneous
events, anil more feature films, and
spreading them over a densely-packed
ten-day period, Athens offers better
weather, more and vat *d films, and a
surer chance of exh lihon for the

submitting filmmaker Ann Arbor still
maintains its festival over 6 days, with
nightly exhibitions and accompanying
folderol for bleary-eyed fanatics Al
most $SfXX) in prize money was given
this year at Ann Arbor, some of it in
unusual places.
If any trend could be discerned in
the screenings of 1981. it would pertain
to rock music films Nuclear Heacfo

talkie punk Fifties glimpse at a
science-fiction future where bathing
suited couples surfed in the sandbox
of their nuclear fallout shelter Rock

saga of a disco-fied fat girl and her slo

Francisco's bizarre antimusical, face

versions of their songs to the festival
including The Simple Song' and "Act
of Being Polite While these cinema
songs are resolutely too weird for
television s Video Jukebox, they do
pick up where Devo's mini-movies left
off. Devo's concert movies, in fact
were first presented several years ago

at Ann Arbor. Their influence was
commemorated this year during
intermission, when a 20 minute re
edited version of Jocko Homo played
over and over through the sound sys

Fhe future of experimental shorts
may again be bright, particularly for
those with rock soundtracks, thanks to
the burgeoning cable television out
lets. Marilyn Horowitz, shorts super
visor for Showtime Entertainment
television, claims she needs a constant
supply of continuity product to fill up
the spaces between feature films on
her paycable network. An all-music
network, featuring only filmed ver
sions of rock singles (like those Dick
(.lark showed when he couldn't afford
the band it.self), may already be avail
able on certain cable connections.
Video disks will provide yet another
outlet for short films Video disks are
my religion, claimed George Romero
{Down of the Detuf) at a recent film
conference Perhaps for the first time
in history, dedicated film artists such
as Stan Brakhage and Jorden Belson
will have an affordable market for
their works of art, with disks available
at less than $20 They need only sell a
few hundred to earn back costs.
