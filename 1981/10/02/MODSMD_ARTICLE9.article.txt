# Hill Street Blues' Hill & Renko:
## Partners on a Winning Team

When her local station preempted the
show, one diehard fan hopped in her car,
drove across Texas and watched the missing
episode in a rental motel rcxmi.
Complaining that programs like Dukes of
Hazzard portray his colleagues as "buf
foons," a New Jersey policeman wrote TV
Guide "to thank the executives who k«pt
this show about real cops on the air."
In Seattle and Boston and Atlanta, true
believers faithfully videotape each episode
in a kind of sacramental ritual.
And, of course, the television industry it
self recently bestowed 21 Emmy nomina
tions— the most ever for a television series.
All this for Hill Street Blues, the critical/
cult smash of last season, this season's fris
kiest dark horse and quite possibly the best
police series ever broadcast on network
television.
Its staunchest supporters recite a litany of
appeal factors: the series' "realism," its ex
ceptionally high standards of dialogue and
characterization. Not to mention Hill Street's
willingness to depict, often explicitly, a
world of situations and responses that is
considerably less black and white than the
cars its cops drive: arranging a truce be
tween warring street gangs, coordinating a
Presidential visit to the precinct, dealing
with an alcoholic cop who goes on the lake.
There are also intra-squad antagonisms, a
grubby plainclothesman, an epithet-snorting
SNX'AT commander and an oversexed desk
sergeant whose corner on the malapropism
market could run Norm Crosbv out of busi-
