# Hill Street Blues' Hill & Renko:

well enough to admit he most enjoys the

"Anybody who wants to be a cop is

Renko is often right. Sometimes Hill shows
too much sensitivity and compassion to Ix- a

Warren carried over some valuable les
sons from his earlier near-career. "Athletics

is a star because everyone has to work to
make the effort successful Writers, actors

directors, cameramen — everybody has to
give their best to make Hill Street a hit.
Ironically, the best cop show that ever
happened almost didn't happen.
"When Fred Silverman asked us to do .1
new police show, we initially refused/ sa\ s

created, produced and writes most Hill
Street shows. Both of us had done so mam
cop shows—Kojak and Quiticy, Columho
— that we said we'd do it only on two con
ditions. First, that NBC leave us totalh alone
and let us do what we wanted with the
show. And two. that we meet with their
broadcast standards department before we
even wrote one word.
Meeting with the network. Kozoll and
Boshko pressed the point that "Vie were
looking for a maturity of concept, we
wanted to do an adult show. There would
of necessity, on occasion, be some graphic
violence. There were also be a sexualitx to
the show (In the latter area. Hill Street
regulars have observed Captain Furillo's
bubble-bathing with public defender Joyce
Davenport, Sgt. Esterhaus on-duty dal

school teacher in the classroom — sureh
one ot the most erotic sequences any
network show.)
We wanted to do a show that was recog
ni/able as a genre show,' Boshko explains,
but that was different. The writers famil
iarity with police helped. Working 011 cop
shows, you become familiar with police
procedure and with the ambience that sur
rounds their work. And you almost build up
a trousseau ot stories. Equally helpful were
the actors contributions. "Thev saw things
in the characters we'd created." sa\s
Boshko, "and they were definitely active in
adding dimensions to them."
Boshko assures that "All the characters
will be back, and they won't change drasti
cally. In real life, people evolve, incremen
tally. That's what our characters will do. It
would, for instance, be a mistake to have
Jim Sikking (Howard Hunter) continue to
come in week after week, make cracks
about Hispanics and walk out That pales

Such fine tuning should only help Hill

directors, cameramen — everybody has to
give their best to make Hill Street a hit.
Ironically, the best cop show that ever
happened almost didn't happen.
"When Fred Silverman asked us to do .1
new police show, we initially refused/ sa\ s
Steven Boshko who, with Michael Ko/.011.
created, produced and writes most Hill
Street shows. Both of us had done so mam
cop shows—Kojak and Quiticy, Columho
— that we said we'd do it only on two con
ditions. First, that NBC leave us totalh alone
and let us do what we wanted with the
show. And two. that we meet with their
broadcast standards department before we
even wrote one word.
Meeting with the network. Kozoll and
Boshko pressed the point that "Vie were
looking for a maturity of concept, we
wanted to do an adult show. There would
of necessity, on occasion, be some graphic
violence. There were also be a sexualitx to
the show (In the latter area. Hill Street
regulars have observed Captain Furillo's
bubble-bathing with public defender Joyce
Davenport, Sgt. Esterhaus on-duty dal
liances with anything in hose or halter tops
and, once, officer Renko seducing his night
school teacher in the classroom — sureh
one ot the most erotic sequences any
network show.)
We wanted to do a show that was recog
ni/able as a genre show,' Boshko explains,
but that was different. The writers famil
iarity with police helped. Working 011 cop
shows, you become familiar with police
procedure and with the ambience that sur
rounds their work. And you almost build up
a trousseau ot stories. Equally helpful were
the actors contributions. "Thev saw things
in the characters we'd created." sa\s
Boshko, "and they were definitely active in
adding dimensions to them."
Boshko assures that "All the characters
will be back, and they won't change drasti
cally. In real life, people evolve, incremen
tally. That's what our characters will do. It
would, for instance, be a mistake to have
Jim Sikking (Howard Hunter) continue to
come in week after week, make cracks
about Hispanics and walk out That pales
quickly. So that character will grow
The series will continue to blend comk
and serious, though Boshko admits that
during the first season the balance some
times j>ot thrown off. Vie are, 111 fact, a one
hour dramatic series One problem, con
ceptuallv, with the first season, was the on
going stories. It tends to confuse the casual
viewer if he hits the third episode of .1
four-part series We'll stick with multiple
stories but each show will have one modu
lar story with a start, a middle and an end
Such fine tuning should only help Hill
Street's rapidly improving condition. Boshko
claims last season's final expisodes nudged
into the Nielsen's top JO. and while suppor

new head is Grant Tinker, former boss ot

Steven Bo.tiiko searches his memory tor
his favorite definition of the show 's appeal
It came from my brother-in-law," Boshko
recalls. "He said what he liked best was the
fact that he never knew, from one moment
to the next, whether something humorous
would suddenly turn very complex, or vice
versa. Keeping people otf guard, that's what
makes Hill Street Mines different: butting
humor up against gut wrenching drama On

But somehow it does "
