This issue of the Daily marks the inception of the
Commentary page. Each week, we will devote an
entire page exclusively to lighter interpretations of
both serious and not-so-serious issues; columnists
may treat their subjects satirically or in a humorous
vein. However (here's the pitch); in order for it to
succeed, we need your contributions.
What do you find funny? Which public figures need
a good, irreverent shakedown? Tell us, on 57-
character double-spaced typed copy, and bring your
submissions to the Daily office.
