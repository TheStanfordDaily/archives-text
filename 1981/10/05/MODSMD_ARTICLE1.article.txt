Today marks the beginning of the
Fall Telephone Appeal, one of the
many fundraising activities con
ducted by the Stanford Annual Fund,
a department in the Office of De
velopment. According to its director
John Hays, members of the staff of
the Annual Fund travel to different
regions of the country to meet with
alumni who then contact other alum
ni in their area in order to Elicit gifts.
"It is a 100 percent volunteer effort
on the part of the alumni," Hays said.
"It is basically a regional appeal, un
less there are enough alumni from a
specific school, such as engineering
or humanities, in one region, in
which case it also becomes a school
appeal," Hays said.
Different colleges have different
appeal strategies, according to Hays;
Yale, for example, contacts alumni by
class rather than by region, he said.
"Stanford has adopted the method
that we find works best for us," he
commented.
The first three days of the Fall Tele
phone Appeal will be conducted in
the Office of Development in Encina
Hall tonight, tomorrow night, and
Wednesday evening. After a one
hour training session, local alumni
will begin calling alumni in this re
gion, explained Judy Donnelly, as
sociate director of the Annual Fund
and head of the regional Telephone
Appeal.
Soliciting gifts from alumni is just
one part of the University's fundrais
ing effort. According to the Office of
Development, fundraising is com
prised of four main categories: gifts
from living individuals, corporations,
foundations and bequests.
Hays recently attended an Ivy
League Conference at Columbia
University where fundraisers from
Brown University, Columbia, Cornell
University, Dartmouth College,
Harvard University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, University of
Pennsylvania, Princeton University,
Stanford and Yale University meet
annually. Hays said the conference is
a chance for "learning and instruc
tion for all of the institutions.
"We not only compare figures but
aUo discuss such topics as the im
plications of new tax laws on fun
draising efforts," said Hays.
According to David Fulton, direc
tor of Communication and Develop
ment, Stanford raised a total of $79.5
million in 1980, ranking second only
