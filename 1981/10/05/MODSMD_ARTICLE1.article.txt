# Telephones eld efforts to raise funds

### Anne-Marie DeGeorge 
Today marks the beginning of the
Fall Telephone Appeal, one of the
many fundraising activities con
ducted by the Stanford Annual Fund,
a department in the Office of De
velopment. According to its director
John Hays, members of the staff of
the Annual Fund travel to different
regions of the country to meet with
alumni who then contact other alum
ni in their area in order to Elicit gifts.
"It is a 100 percent volunteer effort
on the part of the alumni," Hays said.
"It is basically a regional appeal, un
less there are enough alumni from a
specific school, such as engineering
or humanities, in one region, in
which case it also becomes a school
appeal," Hays said.
Different colleges have different
appeal strategies, according to Hays;
Yale, for example, contacts alumni by
class rather than by region, he said.
"Stanford has adopted the method
that we find works best for us," he
commented.
The first three days of the Fall Tele
phone Appeal will be conducted in
the Office of Development in Encina
Hall tonight, tomorrow night, and
Wednesday evening. After a one
hour training session, local alumni
will begin calling alumni in this re
gion, explained Judy Donnelly, as
sociate director of the Annual Fund
and head of the regional Telephone
Appeal.
Soliciting gifts from alumni is just
one part of the University's fundrais
ing effort. According to the Office of
Development, fundraising is com
prised of four main categories: gifts
from living individuals, corporations,
foundations and bequests.
Hays recently attended an Ivy
League Conference at Columbia
University where fundraisers from
Brown University, Columbia, Cornell
University, Dartmouth College,
Harvard University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, University of
Pennsylvania, Princeton University,
Stanford and Yale University meet
annually. Hays said the conference is
a chance for "learning and instruc
tion for all of the institutions.
"We not only compare figures but
aUo discuss such topics as the im
plications of new tax laws on fun
draising efforts," said Hays.
According to David Fulton, direc
tor of Communication and Develop
ment, Stanford raised a total of $79.5
million in 1980, ranking second only
to Harvard compared to Ivy League
universities. However, fundraising
"is not a horserace between institu
tions," he explained. "We have our
needs and Harvard has theirs; we try
to meet our needs as best as we can."
Yale ranked third in total funding
for the 1980-81 fiscal year. Although a
categorical breakdown of figures for
the other universities was not avail
able, Fulton said that overall, "most
schools had significantly better years
last year than they did the year
before."
Bruce Hinchcliffe, director of Cor
porate Relations, agreed with both
Fulton and Hays that substantial con
clusions cannot be drawn from direct
figure comparisons since different
schools have different needs.
MIT, for example, will draw more
support from corporations which
have an interest in science and tech
nology than a school such as
Dartmouth that puts less emphasis on
engineering or medicine, Hinchcliffe
said. Differences like that, he ex
plained, are one reason why some
schools attract more contributions
from corporations than others.
Hinchcliffe said he believes, how
ever, that "a lot depends on the ef
fort a school puts into fundraising."
Stanford, second in corporate gifts
after MIT, "has a strong commitment
to fundraising and is probably more
aggressive than other schools," ac
cording to Hinchcliffe.
Cornell, for example, has a strong
engineering school, yet it received
less than half the amount from cor
porations last year than Stanford did,
Hinchcliffe said. "The resources that
an institution puts toward fundrais
ing is a major factor" in how much it
receives, he said.

ing effort. According to the Office of
Development, fundraising is com
prised of four main categories: gifts
from living individuals, corporations,
foundations and bequests.
Hays recently attended an Ivy
League Conference at Columbia
University where fundraisers from
Brown University, Columbia, Cornell
University, Dartmouth College,
Harvard University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, University of
Pennsylvania, Princeton University,
Stanford and Yale University meet
annually. Hays said the conference is
a chance for "learning and instruc
tion for all of the institutions.
"We not only compare figures but
aUo discuss such topics as the im
plications of new tax laws on fun
draising efforts," said Hays.
According to David Fulton, direc
tor of Communication and Develop
ment, Stanford raised a total of $79.5
million in 1980, ranking second only
to Harvard compared to Ivy League
universities. However, fundraising
"is not a horserace between institu
tions," he explained. "We have our
needs and Harvard has theirs; we try
to meet our needs as best as we can."
Yale ranked third in total funding
for the 1980-81 fiscal year. Although a
categorical breakdown of figures for
the other universities was not avail
able, Fulton said that overall, "most
schools had significantly better years
last year than they did the year
before."
Bruce Hinchcliffe, director of Cor
porate Relations, agreed with both
Fulton and Hays that substantial con
clusions cannot be drawn from direct
figure comparisons since different
schools have different needs.
MIT, for example, will draw more
support from corporations which
have an interest in science and tech
nology than a school such as
Dartmouth that puts less emphasis on
engineering or medicine, Hinchcliffe
said. Differences like that, he ex
plained, are one reason why some
schools attract more contributions
from corporations than others.
Hinchcliffe said he believes, how
ever, that "a lot depends on the ef
fort a school puts into fundraising."
Stanford, second in corporate gifts
after MIT, "has a strong commitment
to fundraising and is probably more
aggressive than other schools," ac
cording to Hinchcliffe.
Cornell, for example, has a strong
engineering school, yet it received
less than half the amount from cor
porations last year than Stanford did,
Hinchcliffe said. "The resources that
an institution puts toward fundrais
ing is a major factor" in how much it
receives, he said.
Today marks the beginning of the
Fall Telephone Appeal, one of the
many fundraising activities con
ducted by the Stanford Annual Fund,
a department in the Office of De
velopment. According to its director
John Hays, members of the staff of
the Annual Fund travel to different
regions of the country to meet with
alumni who then contact other alum
ni in their area in order to Elicit gifts.
"It is a 100 percent volunteer effort
on the part of the alumni," Hays said.
"It is basically a regional appeal, un
less there are enough alumni from a
specific school, such as engineering
or humanities, in one region, in
which case it also becomes a school
appeal," Hays said.
Different colleges have different
appeal strategies, according to Hays;
Yale, for example, contacts alumni by
class rather than by region, he said.
"Stanford has adopted the method
that we find works best for us," he
commented.
The first three days of the Fall Tele
phone Appeal will be conducted in
the Office of Development in Encina
Hall tonight, tomorrow night, and
Wednesday evening. After a one
hour training session, local alumni
will begin calling alumni in this re
gion, explained Judy Donnelly, as
sociate director of the Annual Fund
and head of the regional Telephone
Appeal.
Soliciting gifts from alumni is just
one part of the University's fundrais
ing effort. According to the Office of
Development, fundraising is com
prised of four main categories: gifts
from living individuals, corporations,
foundations and bequests.
