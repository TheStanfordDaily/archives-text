# Hanoi grants American airlifts
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Bangkok — Apparently fear
ful of a fresh wave of boat peo
ple trying to escape Vietnam,
Hanoi authorities have sig
naled a willingness to resume
airlifting U.S.-approved refu
gees to freedom.
The message to the U.S. gov
ernment's Orderly Departure
Program headquarters in Thai
land came Thursday after an
unexplained eight-month halt
in U.S.-bound refugee flights.
Only 1,200 of an estimated
250,000 qualified Vietnamese
made it out before the airlift
was shut down on Hanoi's or
ders.
The ODP's tacit mission is to
rescue Vietnamese who
worked for or with the anti-
Communist side in the Viet
nam War but were left behind
in the abrupt U.S. withdrawal
in 1975. They and their families
had been promised evacuation
before the Communist take
over, but the pledge was not
fulfilled.
Whether Hanoi's move on
the refugees portends a shift in

Vietnam's hostility to the West
and its growing dependence
on the Soviet Union remains to
be seen. It could be merely a
response to the likelihood of a
new round of attempted es
capes on boats and the resul
tant bad publicity. On the oth
er hand, diplomats here be
lieve that elements within the
Hanoi leadership believe the
country will never recover
from its deepening economic
paralysis without the kind of
aid that can only come from
the West.
So far, the doctrinaire pro-
Soviet Communists seem in full
command despite the failure of
their Stalinist policies at home,
the global opprobrium
brought on by occupation of
Cambodia and the limited ex
tent of Soviet aid — "just
enough to keep them from
drowning but not enough to
swim," as one analyst put it.
Hanoi agreed to the Orderly
Departure Program in late 1979
after the mass exodus of boat
people. American regulations,
however, require an American

diplomat's personal approval
before a noncitizen can be
granted permission to enter
the United States, and there
were no American diplomats in
Vietnam. It took until Septem
ber, 1980, to negotiate a com
promise whereby a U.S. consul
could fly in on each refugee
plane and issue the necessary
documents at planeside.
In December, 1980, and Jan
uary, T9Bl, a total of six U.S.
flights were cleared. Then Ha
noi deemed the American pro
cedure "too complicated,"
and no further flights were per
mitted. Other countries con
tinued their similar programs
because they did not require
consular processing on the
spot. Refugees have been leav
ing for those other destinations
— led by France and Canada —
at the rate of 400 a month.
According to Colin, Hanoi
suddenly handed over a list of
just under 300 refugees ap
proved for evacuation on Sept.
22 and indicated that another
list of 100 was in preparation.
