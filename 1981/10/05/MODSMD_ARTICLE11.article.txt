## A 						new chapter for Storey House 
### Rolf Sohlberg 
Reconstruction of Storey House, the all
female student residence which suffered
extensive damage in a March 3,1900 fire, is
progressing on schedule with completion
expected as early as February of next year.
No one was hurt in the blaze believed to

be ignited by an electrical short circuit un
der a refrigerator in a third floor room of
the 80-year-old building. Most of the third
floor was destroyed while the second and
first floors suffered considerable smoke
and water damage.
Diana Conklin, Assistant Dean and Di
rector of the Row, remembers the day of
the fire "vividly." The row office at Grove
Mayfield was set up as the temporary fire
information center. "The phones were

ringing off the hook and people were
streaming in and out," Conklin said. "It
was really touching to see the support
these girls received from the Stanford
Community. Donations of money, food,
and clothes began arriving the very same
day."
The 39 Storey women had to face the
tragic loss of many personal items as well as
the complication of finding a place to
sleep. Immediate action was taken to re
locate the residents into available spaces in
the University housing system.
For both economic and sentimental rea
sons the original shell of the house was re
tained. Don Price, project coordinator of
the $1.3 million reconstruction project,
commented that the old house had been
missing some integral strengthening sup
ports in the walls. "Steel reinforcements
shown in the original plans were just not
there. We had to go in and make up for
this."
The flaw was corrected by installing steel
support columns throughout the interior
of the structure, a support method com
monly used in commercial buildings but
"not uncommon" in residential re
constructions.
The new house will provide rooms for 44
instead of 39 students. Five rooms on the
first floor have been redesigned with facil
ities .for handicapped students, and coed
bathroom facilities have been installed on
each floor.
"It has not yet been decided how the de
cision will be reached," Conklin said in re
gard to the possibility of making the new
Storey House coed. "We do know, how

ever, that the greatest demand is for coed
housing and not single sex."
Brooks Corbin, a senior member of
Sigma Chi Fraternity, whose third floor
room sports a balcony which faces Storey
House, voiced his reasons for keeping the
house all female. "There was a definite

comraderie between the two houses
(Storey and Sigma Chi). We used to sing to
them from our balcony and they'd sing
back. We had alot of fun together."
Regardless of the sex of its new resi
dents, the reconstruction should be com
pleted "somewhere between February
and early April," according to Price. The
interior would then need to be painted
and furnished before it would be in
habitable.
