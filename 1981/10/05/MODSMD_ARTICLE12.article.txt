Have you ever felt like Dean
Hargadcft made a mistake in
accepting you to Stanford? Or
maybe that you were chosen to
be "the audience" rather than
"the player?" These feelings
along with other social and ac
ademic pressures confront all
Stanford students at some time
within their four years here.
But what happens when the
problem becomes too much
for a student to handle alone?
The answer is as close as the
end of the hall. The residence
assistance staffs, (RA's), special
ly trained to help students deal
with problems.
This year both new and re
turning RA's attended two-day
workshops directed by Resi
dential Education prior to the
arrival of students. RA orien
tation began with introductory
speeches by President Donald
Kennedy, Associate Dean of
Residential Education Norman
Robinson and Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyon. The staffers
attended workshops where
they learned how to deal with
such touchy topics as race,
class, and sex issues within
dorms. They also reviewed
emergency procedures,
picked up pointers on counsel
ing and listening skills and
learned how to deal with crises
situations. Finally, the RA's
worked on program planning
for social and academic ac
tivities.
According to several RA's,
the session with the most im

pact upon new staffers was the
counseling workshop. In the 1
1/2 hour session, RA's dis
cussed depression, self-doubt
and promotion of overall suc
cess at Stanford. The staffers
were presented with
hypothetical scenarios and
asked how they would deal
with them. For example, one
"practice-emergency" for RA's
in freshman dorms dealt with a

'Being an R.A. is more than just
opening doors at 3 a.m., or telling
freshmen how to get to Dinkelspiel.
It's advising, organizing, and
providing a guiding light.'

student who had developed a
chronic drinking problem dur
ing midterm week. Debbie
Barberio, a first-year RA in
Branner Hall, said, "The cases
were a good thing for making
us think about the year ahead."
The RA's learned skills on
how to directly handle prob
lems and where to make any
necessary referals. They met
with their Counseling and
Phsychological Services (CAPS)
liason, and learned how and
when to send a student.for psy
chological aid.
One of the best resources in
solving problems, the RA's dis
covered, was their own dorm's

staff. Alice Supton, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs for Res
idential Education com
mented, "One RA may be hav
ing trouble helping a student
and then find out that a fellow
staff member has dealt with a
similar case or is better
equipped to handle the situ
ation. Through the orientation
meetings, the RA's learned that
by pooling their interests and

skills, enforcement and sup
port system can be provided
within the dorms.
Each RA also received five
training booklets, including
pamphlets entitled, "The RA's
Role in Academic Advising,"
"RA's and Alcohol Use at Stan
ford," "The RA's Role in Coun
seling," "Individual and Com
munity Responsibility," and a
booklet containing program
planning materials.
Aside from the scheduled
RA training process, many Res
ident Fellows plan staff retreat
weekend for their RA's, held
anywhere from Pajara Dunes to
Sea Ranch to Stanford Campus.

At these retreats, the group
plans for the arrival of the stu
dents, sets down long-term
goals for the dorms and brain
storms academic and social ac
tivities. While working togeth
er, the RA's can get to know
each other and mix the busi
ness with fun.
Ongoing RA training ses
sions will be held throughout
the year. Rape at Stanford,
stress-reduction, homosexuali
ty, and first-aid will be among
the topics planned for this
quarter. Residential Education
will respond to developing is
sues by holding special semi
nars. In past years, for example,
concern over alcohol abuse
has risen so greatly that Resi
dential Education has held spe
cial meetings for RA's. (These
sessions concerning legality,
recognizing medical crises,
chronic drinking, and psy
chological dependence, have
now been incorporated into
the regular 2-day RA orien
tation.) Each dorm staff is ex
pected to send at least one rep
resentative to each of these ad
ditional training sessions.
Training the Residential Ad
visor staffs is a key instrument
in creating the progressive resi
dential education program at
Stanford. As one RA put it,
"Being an RA is more than just
opening doors at 3 a.m., or tell
ing freshmen how to get to
Dinkelspiel. It's advising, or
ganizing, and providing a
'guiding light' to motivate stu
dents' interest and en
thusiasm."

student who had developed a
chronic drinking problem dur
ing midterm week. Debbie
Barberio, a first-year RA in
Branner Hall, said, "The cases
were a good thing for making
us think about the year ahead."
The RA's learned skills on
how to directly handle prob
lems and where to make any
necessary referals. They met
with their Counseling and
Phsychological Services (CAPS)
liason, and learned how and
when to send a student.for psy
chological aid.
One of the best resources in
solving problems, the RA's dis
covered, was their own dorm's

staff. Alice Supton, Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs for Res
idential Education com
mented, "One RA may be hav
ing trouble helping a student
and then find out that a fellow
staff member has dealt with a
similar case or is better
equipped to handle the situ
ation. Through the orientation
meetings, the RA's learned that
by pooling their interests and

skills, enforcement and sup
port system can be provided
within the dorms.
Each RA also received five
training booklets, including
pamphlets entitled, "The RA's
Role in Academic Advising,"
"RA's and Alcohol Use at Stan
ford," "The RA's Role in Coun
seling," "Individual and Com
munity Responsibility," and a
booklet containing program
planning materials.
Aside from the scheduled
RA training process, many Res
ident Fellows plan staff retreat
weekend for their RA's, held
anywhere from Pajara Dunes to
Sea Ranch to Stanford Campus.

At these retreats, the group
plans for the arrival of the stu
dents, sets down long-term
goals for the dorms and brain
storms academic and social ac
tivities. While working togeth
er, the RA's can get to know
each other and mix the busi
ness with fun.
Ongoing RA training ses
sions will be held throughout
the year. Rape at Stanford,
stress-reduction, homosexuali
ty, and first-aid will be among
the topics planned for this
quarter. Residential Education
will respond to developing is
sues by holding special semi
nars. In past years, for example,
concern over alcohol abuse
has risen so greatly that Resi
dential Education has held spe
cial meetings for RA's. (These
sessions concerning legality,
recognizing medical crises,
chronic drinking, and psy
chological dependence, have
now been incorporated into
the regular 2-day RA orien
tation.) Each dorm staff is ex
pected to send at least one rep
resentative to each of these ad
ditional training sessions.
Training the Residential Ad
visor staffs is a key instrument
in creating the progressive resi
dential education program at
Stanford. As one RA put it,
"Being an RA is more than just
opening doors at 3 a.m., or tell
ing freshmen how to get to
Dinkelspiel. It's advising, or
ganizing, and providing a
'guiding light' to motivate stu
dents' interest and en
thusiasm."

Have you ever felt like Dean
Hargadcft made a mistake in
accepting you to Stanford? Or
maybe that you were chosen to
be "the audience" rather than
"the player?" These feelings
along with other social and ac
ademic pressures confront all
Stanford students at some time
within their four years here.
But what happens when the
problem becomes too much
for a student to handle alone?
The answer is as close as the
end of the hall. The residence
assistance staffs, (RA's), special
ly trained to help students deal
with problems.
This year both new and re
turning RA's attended two-day
workshops directed by Resi
dential Education prior to the
arrival of students. RA orien
tation began with introductory
speeches by President Donald
Kennedy, Associate Dean of
Residential Education Norman
Robinson and Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyon. The staffers
attended workshops where
they learned how to deal with
such touchy topics as race,
class, and sex issues within
dorms. They also reviewed
emergency procedures,
picked up pointers on counsel
ing and listening skills and
learned how to deal with crises
situations. Finally, the RA's
worked on program planning
for social and academic ac
tivities.
According to several RA's,
the session with the most im

pact upon new staffers was the
counseling workshop. In the 1
1/2 hour session, RA's dis
cussed depression, self-doubt
and promotion of overall suc
cess at Stanford. The staffers
were presented with
hypothetical scenarios and
asked how they would deal
with them. For example, one
"practice-emergency" for RA's
