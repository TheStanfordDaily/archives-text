# SLE: High Intensity learning
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
While most entering fershmen were worrying
about parties, meeting people, and finding their
way across campus and to the bathroom, stu
dents in Structured Liberal Education had a 300-
page book to read.
This is not to say that the 72 freshmen enrolled
in the specialized program spent all of orien
tation studying. They just had something "in
teresting" to do, as Professor Mark Mancall will
explain.
Mancall is just one of 30 tutors and professors
who teach "SLE," as it's affectionatley called.
And he explains the assignment by saying that
"learning doesn't start when classes start."
Thus, his students will probably spend much
of their time doing "interesting" things, con
sidering the course demands more than 300
pages of reading per week, plus "many" papers,
and both written and oral exams.
This is all an attempt by Mancall and his col
leagues to provide freshmen with an alternative
to the Western Culture and Freshman English re
quirements. SLE will fulfill both of these require
ments, as well as give the students nine units of
credit.
"It should be 12 or 13 units," says Kathy
Duerden, one student in the program.
Duerden was planning to take both Chemistry
and Calculus 41, two five-unit courses, as well as
SLE, but she set her sites a little lower, just taking
the Caluculus, once she encountered the SLE
reading list.
She also says that she took the course "be
cause it sounded interesting," and she wanted to
keep away from "too much" Math and Science.
She plans to major in Chemical Engineering, but
feels that SLE will provide her with some alter
native classes freshman year.

"The people in SLE are definitely very dedi
cated to work and very goal-oriented," says one
student in Florence Moore House whose room
mate is a SLE enrollee. Most people in SLE live in
Florence Moore, where Mancall is a Resident
Fellow.
It is the dedication that Mancall likes to see.
He feels that SLE offers a true alternative to the
"classification" of courses that is prevalent here.

"Our courses in this university, and others, are
divided like a Chinese restaurant menu: you can
pick fish or chicken, but not the two together.
SLE is an attempt to create a coherent educa
tion."
Mancall would also like to take the emphasis
off of the "western" in Western Culture. He of
fers a non-western class once every two weeks.
SLE classes will meet three days a week from 3
to 9 p.m. in the Gavilan lounge.
