## Beyond our control/Editor's viewpoint The
						life of the University 
### 
Several distinct characteristics of the life of a
student come to mind when the purpose of a
university comes up for discussion, and as the
new school year begins its relentless and
altogether speedy course, we as students here
might do well to remind ourselves of them.
First, we are in a unique position to make
ourselves as significant or insignificant as we
care to, although we face certain consequences
asa result of that choice. In high school, I was
once told that students should approach their
time there with the knowledge tnat "never
again in your life will you have the opportunity
to be so norribly wrong with such little
consequence."
The same applies, although to a lesser extent,
to undergraduate years in college and less again
to graduate students, butthe principle is the
same; we are allowed here to argue for points of
view and then change our minds, or even
completely to change our fundamental ideas
about the meaning of life. That process for now
is not frowned upon; it is actively encouraged
and indeed isoneofthe idelsof the university.
That's not to say, of course, that people do not
continue changing their minds once they leave
these academic walls; but I don't believe that
the process will ever again be so readily
accepted. Taking risks, in a cerebral sense
anyway, is an important part of what goes on
here.
There is a corollary to the statement above
which we have to face up to, and question —
"never again will we have the opportunity to be
so increaibly right with such little
consequence.' For students who take
themselvesat all seriously, classes like"How
Nations Deal with Each Other" or
"Environmental Science and Technology" will
continue to be frustrating because if those
students get an A for learning what the
problems are, or even what some of the
solutions" are (which people have a difficult
time agreeing on anyway), it's still a long and
hard step to begin changing what's wrong with
the world.
One trait here for which we can be especially
grateful is, for lack of a better word, that of
"irrelevance." Here I don't use the word at ail
cynically, but rather a bitsadly. In the ideal
world, irrelevance would not exist — we would
find, to borrow from lohn Muir, that if we tried
to examine one small thing, we would always

find it bound up inextricably with the rest of the
universe.
However, here and now. we are not taught
this so readily, and in fact tne situation gives us
cause to fight another intellectual battle. If
you're studying to be a doctor, be "irrelevant"
and take some nistory; if you're a confirmed
politico, why not dabble in some chemistry, for
it's doubtful it will ever again be so easy to ao so.
Specialization, the concentrated pursuit of
knowledge about something, has tremendous
virtues; but it can be extremely dangerous
without the proper perspective to apply it.
We can also look at two other traits of the
university as important; these are exposure and
diversity; perhaps we can describe tnat more
succinctly as exposure to diversity. Exposure
comes from the fact that at a university, we can
find a genuine wealth of knowledge, values,
goals, political stands and philosophical beliefs
among the people here; and if we try further,
we can test ourselves and our own outlooks
against that backdrop.
Here in a university, the ideal is for everyone
to be teachable, although it's a sure and
wonderful bet that they will come out of the
educational process with different views of the
world. Ratherthan lament the fact that we
disagree here, we're grateful for it. Indeed, as
Acting Dean of Undergraduate Studies Diane
Middlebrook said to freshmen two weeks ago,
we are not supposed merely to tolerate diversity
here; we celebrate it.
Finally, the life of the university, above all, is
most distinct in that it revolves around
knowledge and the pursuit of it. In the end, I
sincerely believe that that is the unspoken and
subtle difference which makesthe university
campus unlike any other place in the world.
Without question, that knowledge is being
garnered with varying degrees of skill and
intelligence, and for quite varying ulterior
motives. Some here learn solely for the sake of
learning itself; some here learn solely as a means
to an end. The university exists above all other
reasons for the pursuit of knowledge. We who
enter it do so with that opportunity. As the
pressures of academic lite descend in the
coming weeks, we will perhaps do well to
remember that our time here is relatively short,
and even more, that it is unique.
