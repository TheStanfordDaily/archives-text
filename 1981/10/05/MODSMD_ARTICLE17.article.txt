## Nuclear bomb would destroy American dream 
### 
In the August 31 issue of News
week, a story entitled "Rosier Picture
of Nuclear Survival" reported that
the Federal Emergency Management
Agency was making films to coun
teract the unseemly pessimism on
the part of the general population
about the chances for surviving a nu
clear war. In the interests of clarity, I
cite the following, which would be
the consequences of a single nuclear
weapon dropped, let us say, on San
Francisco.
The first consequence of one
modest 20 megaton bomb would be
the direct blast effects of the bomb
itself. A crater 300 feet deep and half
a mile in diameter would result; ev
erything within a 4-mile radius would
be totally demolished. Within a 6-
mile radius all frame or brick build
ings and any basement shelters
would be destroyed. The casualties
within a 15-mile radius would in
clude eardrum and lung rupture,
plus the impact of penetrating mis
siles, such as glass fragments
energized by blast pressures, winds
and gravity.
A second consequence would be
the release of thermal energy: up to
21 miles from the 20-megaton surface

burst a person would have second
degree burns on all exposed skin. As
far as 40 miles away a reflex glance at
the fireball would produce blindness
by retinal burning.
Another set of consequences in
volves the short and long term effects
of harmful radiation. Birds and mam
mals are highly sensitive to it, while
insects are resistant. The long term
survival of the human population in
the area would be, shall I say, "pre
carious?" Presumably there would
be little or no medical aid available to
survivors, and the acquisition of non
poisoned food and water would be
all but impossible.
Before malnutrition became a
basic problem, however, the threat
of infectious disease would be raised
by, first, the destruction of the sew
age and waste disposal system; and
second, the fact that not only insects
but other friends like rats, bacteria
and viruses are able to adapt to sur
vive the effects of radiation. The ul
timate size of these populations in
the absence of challenge from their
natural enemies is difficult to de
termine. I will not bother to detail the
effects of whole-body irradiation
syndrome, which are not at all pleas

ant. It is enough to say that many of
the living would envy the dead.
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency advises us to build
fallout shelters and wear light col
ored clothing. If you believe that
such measures would be effective
against a nuclear catastrophe (and I
have described only the effect of one
bomb being dropped), then you
must be one of those who believe
that the moon is made of green
cheese, and Nixon a great president.
In view of these facts, which I have
gathered from textbooks on radi
ation biology and nuclear medicine,
the only truly positive path of action
we can choose is to protest the cur
rent madness loose in our country, a
madness that is changing our society
into a military state, and our econo
my into a burgeoning war machine. It
was not the dream of Jefferson and
Lincoln that the United States be
come the purveyor of mass destruc
tion to the nations of the world. It is a
perversion of the American dream
that we seem intent on doing precise
ly that.

survival of the human population in
the area would be, shall I say, "pre
carious?" Presumably there would
be little or no medical aid available to
survivors, and the acquisition of non
poisoned food and water would be
all but impossible.
Before malnutrition became a
basic problem, however, the threat
of infectious disease would be raised
by, first, the destruction of the sew
age and waste disposal system; and
second, the fact that not only insects
but other friends like rats, bacteria
and viruses are able to adapt to sur
vive the effects of radiation. The ul
timate size of these populations in
the absence of challenge from their
natural enemies is difficult to de
termine. I will not bother to detail the
effects of whole-body irradiation
syndrome, which are not at all pleas

ant. It is enough to say that many of
the living would envy the dead.
The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency advises us to build
fallout shelters and wear light col
ored clothing. If you believe that
such measures would be effective
against a nuclear catastrophe (and I
have described only the effect of one
bomb being dropped), then you
must be one of those who believe
that the moon is made of green
cheese, and Nixon a great president.
In view of these facts, which I have
gathered from textbooks on radi
ation biology and nuclear medicine,
the only truly positive path of action
we can choose is to protest the cur
rent madness loose in our country, a
madness that is changing our society
into a military state, and our econo
my into a burgeoning war machine. It
was not the dream of Jefferson and
Lincoln that the United States be
come the purveyor of mass destruc
tion to the nations of the world. It is a
perversion of the American dream
that we seem intent on doing precise
ly that.
