## In Belgium, social programs fuel crisis 
### 
Reaganomics is taking a lot of heat these days as
Americans realize that sacrifices must be made if
economic disaster is to be averted rather than sim
ply postponed. In light of all the new criticisms of
supply-side theory, it might be interesting to ex
amine the fiscal condition of a country which
turned left instead of right after halting at a similar
intersection.
Belgium is a tiny country of nine million people
located north of France in the heart of Europe. Per
capita annual income is more than $7000, only a
few dollars less than in the United States. Despite
the near equality of the average income levels, the
actual standard of living in Belgium is considerably
below its American counterpart. Working Belgians
struggle under the burdens of extravagant social
programs, ridiculous employment schemes,
mushrooming bureaucracy and the incredible tax
rates which are necessary to fuel these man
ifestations of socialism in their country.
Belgian politicians have been talking about "the
crisis" for the past couple of years now and while
the real crisis of socialism goes on unnoticed, they
blame high oil prices, domestic conflicts and
American interest rates. What they fail to point out
is the effect which their own short-sighted eco
nomic policies have on the welfare of their people.
Even as taxes climb and an already enormous na
tional debt grows, the use of public funds for ill
advised social programs continues. Politicians
seem to be little concerned with the fact that all pa
rents are subsidized with "child money" which in
creases on a graduated scale according to family
size even though Belgium is already one of the
most densely populated European countries.

Neither are they disturbed by cultural programs
that offer free private piano lessons to any person
requesting them or allow foreign students to at
tend Belgian Universities at considerably reduced
cost.
Nearly every socialist nation places full em
ployment high on its priority list and Belgium is no
exception. While the goal is certainly a noble one,
their attempts to put people back to work through
government intervention and participation in the
economy have had disastrous results. Run-away
taxation and over-regulation of industry were in
itially to blame for stagflation and unemployment
but legislated solutions have only served to make
matters worse. One widely abused program allows
for a 50 percent government subsidy of an employ
ee's paycheck during the first six months of em
ployment. After that period, the subsidy is halted
and the new employee is nearly always fired. A
\Jarge percentage of recent college graduates go
from job to job in this way for several years before
finding a company which will agree to keep them
on.
Another illustration of the government's mis
guided attempts to put people to work is a policy
which encourages workers to choose early retire
ment so that the unemployed will be able to move
into their jobs sooner. In the short term, policies
such as these do alleviate some minor problems
but their inherent inefficiency only makes the
future that much more difficult to face.
About the only Belgian industry which seems to
be doing well nowadays is government. Brussels is
crowded with building projects and shiny new sky

scrapers designed for the use of burgeoning bu
reaucracies. The key to "the crisis" in Belgium is
that bureaucrats like crises; they give government
more work to do and more reasons to expand.
More striking than perhaps any other factor is
the enormous cost of socialism to the people of
Belgium. Income taxes are so severe that evasion is
commonplace and socially acceptable. In addition
to this, sales taxes have reached incredible levels.
Every item is categorized as either a necessity, a
luxury or an extravagance and taxed accordingly.
Basics such as simple foods or soap are taxed at six
percent. Other items such as imported foods or bi
cycles fall in the 12 percent range while "ex
travagant" items like watches, automobiles and
gasoline reach 25 percent. Recent levels of deficit
spending brought on by "the crisis" forced the is
sue of taxation. The government had to choose be
tween spending cuts and tax increases. Their solu
tion was simple: sales taxes for many automobiles
and other "extravagances" were promoted to the
30 percent bracket.
Supply-side theories may not offer a perfect
solution to U.S. economic ills, but after a look at
the situation in Belgium, it is possible that a swing
back to the left could only worsen the situation
here. For the moment, Reaganomics offers a viable
alternative to the inflationary spending and crippl
ing taxation of recent administrations. Most im
portantly, the Reagan administration is leading the
nation away from the Belgian alternative of per
petual crisis.

Belgian politicians have been talking about "the
crisis" for the past couple of years now and while
the real crisis of socialism goes on unnoticed, they
blame high oil prices, domestic conflicts and
American interest rates. What they fail to point out
is the effect which their own short-sighted eco
nomic policies have on the welfare of their people.
Even as taxes climb and an already enormous na
tional debt grows, the use of public funds for ill
advised social programs continues. Politicians
seem to be little concerned with the fact that all pa
rents are subsidized with "child money" which in
creases on a graduated scale according to family
size even though Belgium is already one of the
most densely populated European countries.

Neither are they disturbed by cultural programs
that offer free private piano lessons to any person
requesting them or allow foreign students to at
tend Belgian Universities at considerably reduced
cost.
Nearly every socialist nation places full em
ployment high on its priority list and Belgium is no
exception. While the goal is certainly a noble one,
their attempts to put people back to work through
government intervention and participation in the
economy have had disastrous results. Run-away
taxation and over-regulation of industry were in
itially to blame for stagflation and unemployment
but legislated solutions have only served to make
matters worse. One widely abused program allows
for a 50 percent government subsidy of an employ
ee's paycheck during the first six months of em
ployment. After that period, the subsidy is halted
and the new employee is nearly always fired. A
\Jarge percentage of recent college graduates go
from job to job in this way for several years before
finding a company which will agree to keep them
on.
Another illustration of the government's mis
guided attempts to put people to work is a policy
which encourages workers to choose early retire
ment so that the unemployed will be able to move
into their jobs sooner. In the short term, policies
such as these do alleviate some minor problems
but their inherent inefficiency only makes the
future that much more difficult to face.
About the only Belgian industry which seems to
be doing well nowadays is government. Brussels is
crowded with building projects and shiny new sky

scrapers designed for the use of burgeoning bu
reaucracies. The key to "the crisis" in Belgium is
that bureaucrats like crises; they give government
more work to do and more reasons to expand.
More striking than perhaps any other factor is
the enormous cost of socialism to the people of
Belgium. Income taxes are so severe that evasion is
commonplace and socially acceptable. In addition
to this, sales taxes have reached incredible levels.
Every item is categorized as either a necessity, a
luxury or an extravagance and taxed accordingly.
Basics such as simple foods or soap are taxed at six
percent. Other items such as imported foods or bi
cycles fall in the 12 percent range while "ex
travagant" items like watches, automobiles and
gasoline reach 25 percent. Recent levels of deficit
spending brought on by "the crisis" forced the is
sue of taxation. The government had to choose be
tween spending cuts and tax increases. Their solu
tion was simple: sales taxes for many automobiles
and other "extravagances" were promoted to the
30 percent bracket.
Supply-side theories may not offer a perfect
solution to U.S. economic ills, but after a look at
the situation in Belgium, it is possible that a swing
back to the left could only worsen the situation
here. For the moment, Reaganomics offers a viable
alternative to the inflationary spending and crippl
ing taxation of recent administrations. Most im
portantly, the Reagan administration is leading the
nation away from the Belgian alternative of per
petual crisis.

exchange student in Belgium last year.)
Reaganomics is taking a lot of heat these days as
Americans realize that sacrifices must be made if
economic disaster is to be averted rather than sim
ply postponed. In light of all the new criticisms of
supply-side theory, it might be interesting to ex
amine the fiscal condition of a country which
turned left instead of right after halting at a similar
intersection.
Belgium is a tiny country of nine million people
located north of France in the heart of Europe. Per
capita annual income is more than $7000, only a
few dollars less than in the United States. Despite
the near equality of the average income levels, the
actual standard of living in Belgium is considerably
below its American counterpart. Working Belgians
struggle under the burdens of extravagant social
programs, ridiculous employment schemes,
mushrooming bureaucracy and the incredible tax
rates which are necessary to fuel these man
ifestations of socialism in their country.
