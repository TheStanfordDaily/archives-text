# Faculty task force to review policies
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
A new University task force, de
signed to "improve our policies and
ways of dealing with people," has
begun its work according to Per
sonnel Director Robert Parker.
Parker and University Counsel John
Schwartz are co-heading the task
force which began studying staff per
sonnel policies last month.

According to Parker, some of the
questions the task force will address
include the University's policy
towards career development; strik
ing a balance between salaries for
faculty and staff and other needs
which compete for the same re
sources; and reconciling the desire
to offer job security with the reality
that the University can't control fed
eral funding sources.
Although the desire to examine
the University's personnel policies
began at the onset of the Kennedy

administration, organization of the
task force itself did not take place un
til four to six months ago, Parker said.
"One of the things that is occur
ring with the University's new of
ficers is taking a fresh look at the way
things are done," Parker said.
He explained that the task force
will be working to develop and
articulate a set of general principles
which can be used to guide Univer
sity policies in personnel man
agement and human resources.
He said that although the task force
was not a response to the drive for
unionization last spring, it would,
nonetheless, affect everybody who
works here. The unionization issue
will be dealt wih "by a separate
mechanism which has not yet been
decided," according to Parker.
Parker said that some of the issues
raised during the unionization elec
tion were being dealt with already on
an individual, decentralized basis,
which he noted as being distinct
from the work of the task force.
"The task force doesn't pretend to
have the answers. Part of its work is to
communicate with different parts of
the University and use the informa
tion gained from that process," com
mented Parker. "The underlying hu
man resource principles we are
working on will be useful only to the
extent they are understood by, and
meaningful to, the people who work
here," he said.
Task force members were chosen
through a consultation process with
top University officials, such as Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, William
Massy, vice president for business
and finance, and Albert Hastorf, vice
president and provost. "The inten
tion was to have diversity of back
ground and experience from dif
ferent parts of the University and to

have people on the task force who
have major responsibilty for influen
cing the direction of the University,"
Parker said.
Members of the task force in addi
tion to Parker and Schwartz include:
Ray Bacchetti, vice provost of Uni
versity management and budget;
Ken Creighton, associate vice presi
dent of business and finance; David
Korn, chairman and professor of the
pathology department at the School
of Medicine; Sally Mahoney, regis
trar and associate provost; David
Mendelow, associate dean of the
School of Medicine; Rene
McPherson, dean of the Graduate
School of Business; John Rees, as
sociate director and adjunct pro
fessor of SLAC; Santiago Rodriguez,
affirmative action officer; Elizabeth
ialzer, head of Meyer Library; Peter
Stansky, professor and chairman of
the history department; Norman
Wessells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences and professor of biology;
and Robert White, professor and vice
chairman of the electrical engineer
ing department.
