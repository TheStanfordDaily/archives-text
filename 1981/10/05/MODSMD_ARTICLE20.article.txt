## Solidarity: days of stone may be near 
### 
Washington — The Kremlin never
speaks nicely, but it sometimes
speaks precisely. For many months it
has called Poland's Solidarity move
ment "anti-socialist and anti-Soviet."
Solidarity is, in fact, both. So if Soli
darity survives, no elite anywhere in
Eastern Europe is safe.
The suppression of Solidarity —
which now means the Polish nation
— has long seemed, to me, in
evitable. If it comes soon, as Mos
cow's menacing words suggest, some
Western observers may blame the
"excesses" of the recent Solidarity
congress. The congress called for
free parliamentary elections and
pledged encouragement for free
trade unions throughout the Eastern
Bloc, including the Soviet Union. But
for many months the Polish Com
munist Party's "leading role" in
Polish society, although formally ac
knowledged by Solidarity, has been a
chimera. Solidarity has become what
the Poles call a "parallel state."
More than a year ago the Polish
government signed the Gdansk
agreement with Solidarity, a social
contract, a constitution asserting
citizens' rights and limiting govern
ment power. A Polish cartoonist de
picted the event as "the international
agreement between the Polish gov
ernment and the Polish people."
Since then the government has be
come a bit more like a domestic in
stitution. The Economist of London
says: "In the 14 months since the
Gdansk uprising last July, a total
itarian state has been turned into one
that is now more pluralisticthan most
countries in the world — run by a
Communist Party whose leaders are

at least as democratically chosen as
those, say, in Britain's Labor Party."
The comparison with the Labor Party
is faint praise, but the fact that The
Economist correctly notes is
astonishing.
At the Communist Party congress
in July, most of the 1,950 delegates
were democratically elected by se
cret ballot from unlimited lists of can
didates. More than 80 percent of
those elected had never attended a
congress, and 80 percent of the 140-
man central committee did not get to
attend as delegates. A recent opinion
poll rated the popularity of 10 Polish
institutions. The Church was ranked
first, the Communist Party 10th.
Poland is the South Carolina of the
Soviet empire, an incubator of
secessionist sentiment. Most great
revolutions, were directed from the
top by leaders improvising tactics,
but with a clear sense of their destina
tion. The Polish revolution — by
some measures the most remarkable
yet, whatever the future holds — has
leaders. But they are riding a head
strong horse, and they are not sure
the horse knows the way.
Twice — twice in five years — the
Soviet Union surprised the Poles by
participating in atrocities against Po
land. In August 1939, the Soviet
Union became Hitler's ally and the
next month collaborated with him in
carving up Poland. By 1944, the Soviet
Union, at Hitler's, initiative, had
changed sides, and the Red Army was
near Warsaw. The Warsaw uprising
against the Nazi occupiers assumed
that Russian help would soon arrive.
Instead, the Russians waited at the
outskirts of Warsaw content to allow

their former allies, the Nazis, to serve
their future needs by butchering
Polish leadership elites that would
have complicated Soviet occupation.
Perhaps Poland's economic
calamity — a 15 percent decline in
GNP last year; desperate food and
other shortages — will cause the So
viet Union to choose to leave Poland
alone. Perhaps Soviet leaders hope
that Poland will be a sobering eco
nomic example to any Eastern Eu
ropean group that might be tempted
to start down the path Poland has
taken.
But it is more probable that the
Warsaw government, directed by
Moscow, will use the economic dis
locations as an excuse for imposing
martial law. There will be disorder,
followed by some sort of Soviet in
tervention. Then the workers will
flood the coal mines and the econo
my will grind to a halt, with interest
ing consequences for the foreign
banks (including American banks)
that are owed Poland's $27 billion in
hard-currency external debt.
Before 1918, a Polish patriotic song
expressed the prayer that Cod would
"restore" Poland's independence.
Between 1918 and 1980 the song was
sung as a prayer that God would
"bless our independence." Now it is
again sung, defiantly, as a prayer for
God to "restore our independence."
But as John Denver's ballad says,
some days are diamonds, some days
are stone. Poland has given the world
some sparkling diamond days. The
days of stone may be at hand.
