## Commentary/Jordan Bender Parties merit a weekly dose 
### 
A Stanford party is a strange
phenomenon. While most parties
elsewhere display some form of un
usual interaction, the Stanford party
combines high quality triteness with
some of the more standard types of
anti-social behavior. A weekly dose
of party is a necessity for most stu
dents.
One must appear anti-social to be
very social at a Stanford party. It is dif
ficult to know when one's ap
pearance is sufficiently anti-social, so
my advice is: go to the party naked.
Nakedness is always considered to be
anti-social and guarantees one does
not look too preppy. For those only
moderately concerned with being
anti-social, I suggest something
along the lines of punk rock glasses
or very noticeable cold sores.

Be prepared for perplexing philosophical
questions like, "How was your summer?
How's it goin'? How are your classes?" and,
"How many Arby's employees does it take to
fix the Beef 'n Cheddar platter?"

Remember that while most parties
are supposed to start at 9 p.m., no
one arrives until II p.m. While this sit
uation is both amusing and imprac
tical, one should not overlook its re
deeming value. Not only does one
avoid the party for another two hours
but the Stanford student has two ad
ditional hours for other campus rec
reation like bowling.
The Stanford student must comply
with a specific party etiquette or face
total humiliation. Glance from side to
side, remembering never to actually
look directly at anybody. Head
towards the kegs. Move swiftly so
people think you have someone to

see or something to do. Try not to be
caught standing alone. I usually walk
a continuous beat from the kegs to
the bathrooms so I'm not caught. If
you are caught, deny it; or better yet,
point the finger at the other guy. Last
week, some stranger accused me of
standing alone.
"What?" I cried, "I wasn't standing
alone — I was merely between
strides."
"No, you were idling, my friend,
and as far as I'm concerned that's
standing alone."
"This is ridiculous!" I objected, "I
was simply off-step. Besides, how did
you decide that I had been standing
alone if you were not standing alone
yourself?"
"Who me? Uh, well ... she was
right here a minute ago."

While Stanford students are
among the most intelligent people in
the country, party conversation
tends to baffle students with
Rorshach-like testing. Be prepared
for perplexing philosophical ques
tions like: "How was your summer?
How's it goin'? How are your
classes?" and, "How many Arby's
employees does it take to fix the Beef
'n Cheddar platter?"
Most students indeed find it dif
ficult to actually remember party
conversation. I do, however, recall a
conversation from a Stanford party
that can be described as typical:
He: "How's it goin'?"

She: "Oh, fine. Hey, I like your
shirt — "
He (excitedly): "Thanksl Ya havin'
a good time?"
She (looking puzzled): "Yeah, I
dunno, I guess I'm pretty buzzed."
He (anxiously): "Alright! Hey, you
wanna dance or something?"
She (suddenly back-pedalling):
"Well, I gotta go find my roommate
n
He (to himself): "My God, I h pe
she's not lost — (now yelling above
the crowd) — Hey waitl I'll help you
find her — Wait, waitl I'll find her...
do you know how to slow dance?"
While I may have given the im
pression that all Stanford parties are
trite and uneventful, some parties are
highly entertaining and provide the
most sociable form of escape on
campus. Yet, alternatives to Stanford
parties do exist which offer social en
tertainment at relatively equal value.
Five novel alternatives have recent
ly been brought to my attention: (1)
Strip Darts - an exciting new adult
party game which effectively reduces
small talk to a bare minimum. (2) Wa
tercourse Way: A Family Bathing
Center - two for one discounts in The
Money Book provide cheap enter
tainment for you and your relatives.
(3) Cow Tipping - it helps if you know
someone from Vinita, Oklahoma. (4)
Palo Alto High School - especially
good scoping at lunchtime. (5) Bowl
ing.
Even though the setting is uncom
fortable, the conversation is empty,
and the beer is usually flat, the Stan
ford party still stands as the most pop
ular social event on the Stanford
campus. Considering other legal al
ternatives, one can understand why
this is so.

She (looking puzzled): "Yeah, I
dunno, I guess I'm pretty buzzed."
He (anxiously): "Alright! Hey, you
wanna dance or something?"

He (to himself): "My God, I h pe
she's not lost — (now yelling above

do you know how to slow dance?"
While I may have given the im
pression that all Stanford parties are
trite and uneventful, some parties are
highly entertaining and provide the
most sociable form of escape on
campus. Yet, alternatives to Stanford
parties do exist which offer social en
tertainment at relatively equal value.
Five novel alternatives have recent
ly been brought to my attention: (1)
Strip Darts - an exciting new adult
party game which effectively reduces
small talk to a bare minimum. (2) Wa
tercourse Way: A Family Bathing
Center - two for one discounts in The
Money Book provide cheap enter
tainment for you and your relatives.
(3) Cow Tipping - it helps if you know
someone from Vinita, Oklahoma. (4)
Palo Alto High School - especially
good scoping at lunchtime. (5) Bowl
ing.
Even though the setting is uncom
fortable, the conversation is empty,
and the beer is usually flat, the Stan
ford party still stands as the most pop
ular social event on the Stanford
campus. Considering other legal al
ternatives, one can understand why
this is so.

A Stanford party is a strange
phenomenon. While most parties
elsewhere display some form of un
usual interaction, the Stanford party
combines high quality triteness with
some of the more standard types of
anti-social behavior. A weekly dose
of party is a necessity for most stu
dents.
One must appear anti-social to be
very social at a Stanford party. It is dif
ficult to know when one's ap
pearance is sufficiently anti-social, so
my advice is: go to the party naked.
Nakedness is always considered to be
anti-social and guarantees one does
not look too preppy. For those only
moderately concerned with being
anti-social, I suggest something
along the lines of punk rock glasses
or very noticeable cold sores.

Be prepared for perplexing philosophical
questions like, "How was your summer?
How's it goin'? How are your classes?" and,
"How many Arby's employees does it take to
fix the Beef 'n Cheddar platter?"

Remember that while most parties
are supposed to start at 9 p.m., no
one arrives until II p.m. While this sit
uation is both amusing and imprac
tical, one should not overlook its re
deeming value. Not only does one
avoid the party for another two hours
but the Stanford student has two ad
ditional hours for other campus rec
reation like bowling.
The Stanford student must comply
with a specific party etiquette or face
total humiliation. Glance from side to
side, remembering never to actually
look directly at anybody. Head
towards the kegs. Move swiftly so
people think you have someone to

see or something to do. Try not to be
caught standing alone. I usually walk
a continuous beat from the kegs to
the bathrooms so I'm not caught. If
you are caught, deny it; or better yet,
point the finger at the other guy. Last
week, some stranger accused me of
standing alone.
"What?" I cried, "I wasn't standing
alone — I was merely between
strides."
"No, you were idling, my friend,
and as far as I'm concerned that's
standing alone."
"This is ridiculous!" I objected, "I
was simply off-step. Besides, how did
you decide that I had been standing
alone if you were not standing alone
yourself?"
"Who me? Uh, well ... she was
right here a minute ago."

While Stanford students are
among the most intelligent people in
the country, party conversation
tends to baffle students with
Rorshach-like testing. Be prepared
for perplexing philosophical ques
tions like: "How was your summer?
How's it goin'? How are your
classes?" and, "How many Arby's
employees does it take to fix the Beef
'n Cheddar platter?"
Most students indeed find it dif
ficult to actually remember party
conversation. I do, however, recall a
conversation from a Stanford party
that can be described as typical:
He: "How's it goin'?"

She: "Oh, fine. Hey, I like your
shirt — "
He (excitedly): "Thanksl Ya havin'
a good time?"
She (looking puzzled): "Yeah, I
dunno, I guess I'm pretty buzzed."
He (anxiously): "Alright! Hey, you
wanna dance or something?"
She (suddenly back-pedalling):
"Well, I gotta go find my roommate
