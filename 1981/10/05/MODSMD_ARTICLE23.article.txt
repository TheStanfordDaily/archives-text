## Seeing the other side of Hell 
### 
Don't ask me how I ended up in
Hell this summer. Maybe I got lost on
one of those transit buses at the air
port, but it's really not important. The
fact is I spent my summer vacation re
ally down under, and discovered
some amazing things.
For one, and the Western Culture
department should take note of this,
Dante was fairly accurate in The In
ferno. All those circles are there,and
they're laid out just like the book
says. One day, however, I found that
Dante had missed a whole area —
and understandably, for this "for
gotten" circle of Hell lies off to the
side, behind an aluminum screen
door. That is to say, somewhere be
tween the unbaptized children and
false witnesses lies the dwelling of
The Affected and Pretentious.
Behind this door, which is only
openable because someone was
thoughtful enough to hang a little
pot-holder on the knob, lies a dingy
hall that leads to a dingier stairway.
Descending, the first landing ap
pears with only one doorway. The
door is plastered with smiling face
stickers, each happy visage urging us
to "Have A Nice Day!" Inside, the
small room is filled with para
phanalia, but lacks inhabitants. Save
one red-faced old man standing in
the corner, gyrating his rusty hips in
an effort to keep a faded pink hula
hoop from falling to the floor. When
questioned about the lack of resi
dents, he explains:
"Should have been here a few
weeks ago, we had a whole load then.
Lord, they came in wearing Sony
Walkmans on their heads, riding
mopeds, pogo-ing in leopard min
iskirts, eating Haagen-Dazs... what
a bunch! But they're gone now too
just like all the others. See, when
whatever it is goes out of style, they
disappear with it. But, here's the beef
— when they disappear ( all their junk
stays behind. So I'm supposed to
keep this room picked up, and I'm
running out of room — I mean the
turnover here is pretty high and all.
But rumor has it topside that it's not
to stylish to get excited over anything
right now, not even fads, so maybe
I'll have some time to get this garbage
arranged.
Descending the next staircase, the
sound of the caretaker's voice fades,
yielding to strains of "Bolero"
emanating from behind the only
door on the second floor. A plastic
"Maid Service" sign swings from the
knob as the door opens to reveal a
middle-aged man at the threshold.
Standing still, he is a blaze of
polyester blues and reds bounded by
bright white shoes, belt, and cowboy
hat. His shirt strains at the low point
to which it has been buttoned; that
point on male middle-aged bodies
where the profile changes from flat
to very round — the corner of an in
verted question mark, with an empty
shot glass in one hand and a cigarette
in the other, he kicks the door open
to reveal a roomful of men just like
himself. The music is so loud now
that he shouts to be heard above
Ravel's rhythms:

"Like I couldn't believe it when I
got here. It was so perfect — we've
got closets full of clothes from a rain
bow of leisure suits to disco threads,
we've got great beds with magic fin
gers machines that don't even need
coins, and the best mood music like
this Bolero — supposed to weaken
the classiest lady — we've got full liq
uor cabinets and muted lighting; it's
a swinger's paradise realized.
So, we were all here for about an
hour when it finally hit — there are
no women herel Not one! We keep
the maid sign on the door hoping
that one will come by, but all we get is
that ugly caretaker asking us if we
need more booze. It's enough to
drive any normal red-blooded man
crazy..."
The third floor down also contains
only one room. As the door opens, a
rush of hot air mingles with the cool
of the stairwell to form a wall of
steam. This soon dissipates enough to
view the interior — a large barren
room packed with people.
Everyone is talking, but to no one

in particular, and no one even men
tions the stifling heat. In fact, no one
mentions anything — but names.

" Not only does everyone seem to
have an endless suppy of names, they
also hold a copy of People magazine,
and some identifying mark on their
clothing. There are the Gucci "G's"
and the Cardin "C's," the Lacoste Al

boldly on a pocket, sleeve, or belt.

Don't ask me how I ended up in
Hell this summer. Maybe I got lost on
one of those transit buses at the air
port, but it's really not important. The
fact is I spent my summer vacation re
ally down under, and discovered
some amazing things.
For one, and the Western Culture
department should take note of this,
Dante was fairly accurate in The In
ferno. All those circles are there,and
they're laid out just like the book
says. One day, however, I found that
Dante had missed a whole area —
and understandably, for this "for
gotten" circle of Hell lies off to the
side, behind an aluminum screen
door. That is to say, somewhere be
tween the unbaptized children and
false witnesses lies the dwelling of
The Affected and Pretentious.
Behind this door, which is only
openable because someone was
thoughtful enough to hang a little
pot-holder on the knob, lies a dingy
hall that leads to a dingier stairway.
Descending, the first landing ap
pears with only one doorway. The
door is plastered with smiling face
stickers, each happy visage urging us
to "Have A Nice Day!" Inside, the
small room is filled with para
phanalia, but lacks inhabitants. Save
one red-faced old man standing in
the corner, gyrating his rusty hips in
an effort to keep a faded pink hula
hoop from falling to the floor. When
questioned about the lack of resi
dents, he explains:
"Should have been here a few
weeks ago, we had a whole load then.
Lord, they came in wearing Sony
Walkmans on their heads, riding
mopeds, pogo-ing in leopard min
iskirts, eating Haagen-Dazs... what
a bunch! But they're gone now too
just like all the others. See, when
whatever it is goes out of style, they
disappear with it. But, here's the beef
— when they disappear ( all their junk
stays behind. So I'm supposed to
keep this room picked up, and I'm
running out of room — I mean the
turnover here is pretty high and all.
But rumor has it topside that it's not
to stylish to get excited over anything
right now, not even fads, so maybe
I'll have some time to get this garbage
arranged.
Descending the next staircase, the
sound of the caretaker's voice fades,
yielding to strains of "Bolero"
emanating from behind the only
door on the second floor. A plastic
"Maid Service" sign swings from the
knob as the door opens to reveal a
middle-aged man at the threshold.
Standing still, he is a blaze of
polyester blues and reds bounded by
bright white shoes, belt, and cowboy
hat. His shirt strains at the low point
to which it has been buttoned; that
point on male middle-aged bodies
where the profile changes from flat
to very round — the corner of an in
verted question mark, with an empty
shot glass in one hand and a cigarette
in the other, he kicks the door open
to reveal a roomful of men just like
himself. The music is so loud now
that he shouts to be heard above
Ravel's rhythms:

"Like I couldn't believe it when I
got here. It was so perfect — we've
got closets full of clothes from a rain
bow of leisure suits to disco threads,
we've got great beds with magic fin
gers machines that don't even need
coins, and the best mood music like
this Bolero — supposed to weaken
the classiest lady — we've got full liq
uor cabinets and muted lighting; it's
a swinger's paradise realized.
So, we were all here for about an
hour when it finally hit — there are
no women herel Not one! We keep
the maid sign on the door hoping
that one will come by, but all we get is
that ugly caretaker asking us if we
need more booze. It's enough to
drive any normal red-blooded man
crazy..."
The third floor down also contains
only one room. As the door opens, a
rush of hot air mingles with the cool
of the stairwell to form a wall of
steam. This soon dissipates enough to
view the interior — a large barren
room packed with people.
Everyone is talking, but to no one

in particular, and no one even men
tions the stifling heat. In fact, no one
mentions anything — but names.
