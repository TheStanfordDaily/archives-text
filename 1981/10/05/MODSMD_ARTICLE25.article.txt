## Italians Inhabit a chaotic nirvana 
### 
Italy?! My father stared at me in
disbelief. My mother, fearing for my
survival, I think, spoke of wanton ter
rorism, mass chaos, and the uncer
tainties of every waking day. Yet after
only one week in the promised chaos
and confusion, I discovered nirvana.
This was the surreal world of daily
mishaps and unpredictable turn
arounds that somehow made me feel
infinitely more comfortable than the
constipated certainty of all the rou
tines which I had left behind.
It was the most paradoxical world I
ever could have imagined. Italy pro
duces the world's most exotic cars,
some of the most exquisite wines and
the most distinctive fashions in
clothing, and the tastiest ice cream.
The country is thoroughly steeped in
the arts — yet everyone continually
marvels at the fact that the system
hasn't yet collapsed.
Why? A friend provided some in
sight. "We Italians are great one at a
time," he said, "but put us in a group
and we are a disaster: we can dis
order, disrupt and dispute almost
anything."
Since the second world war, the
government has collapsed 41 times;
this testifies to the perpetually
chaotic state of affairs which, as ev
eryone seems to agree, is completely
corrupt to boot. But corruption, to an
American, carries a fairly heavy
negative connotation. In Italy, cor
ruption is part of the game, under
stood and managed, and though not
justified, generally accepted. While
discussing politics in a bar one eve
ning, I was asked to explain the
wrongdoing in the Watergate affair,
because it seemed to them that the
main part of the story had been left
out. What was the crime? Later I un
derstood: this kind of thing happens
every day in Italian politics.
Another thing which the Italians
accept routinely is parking one's car,
though in my view it has become an

other expression of art. I remember
being driven to my apartment after a
gathering late one night, wheeling
through the narrow cobblestone
streets at breakneck speeds in a Fiat
not half the size of any American ma
chine.
Without warning, the car jolted to
the left, cutting perfectly between
two parked cars and coming to a halt
— half of it resting on the sidewalk.
No artificial stimulants were present
— this was the norm. I never did un
derstand how the daintiest of Italian
women and the most even-tempered
of Italian males could act like maniacs
behind the wheel.
Then I will never forget how im
pressed I was by verbal communica
tion in Italy. I almost wondered why I
had wasted my time with those Italian
classes back at school when one did
not even need to understand a word
to comprehend what was going on.
Just by eyeing the hands and face,
words became superfluous; facial
contortions and brilliantly executed
gestures made for vivid communica
tion. Butwhen you did pay some at
tention to those words, you could
not help but be spellbound by the
musical quality and rhythm of every
sentence.
And of course, as everyone knows,
linesare non-existent in Italy. If an in
formal funnel is present, all the more
lucky, but usually theelbow or subtle
use of the shoulder prevail. I re
member so well the blank expression
of an Englishman, apparently newly
arrived in Firenze, queueing up for
the money exchange. He started out
no more than five feet from the win
dow, but was slowly and graciously
pushed back further and further by
one newcomer after another.
To be passive in Italy is sacrilege;
no one will ever give up what is even
remotely possible, and nobody is
slow. If the answer is "no" the in
terpretation is "maybe," and what

ever is necessary, whether it be theat
rical bluffing or a couple of thousand
lire, is employed to realize the de
sired end.
Just about anyone can be swayed;
almost anything is possible once you
learn to play the game. The Italians
are master charmers. The pappagalli
is a case in point. How many other
men in this world could be so suc
cessful with an "I love you," in bro
ken English as an opening line?
Perfectly compatible with this sys
tem is the riposo, that two or three
hour afternon seizure during which
life comes to a screeching halt. Ev
erything shuts down during those
hours, and no matter how de
termined you may be to get some
thing accomplished in town, you can
forget it. This is a time of rest, and
nothing happens. And if the
storekeeper promised that he would
open up again at 4 p.m. with your
shoes repaired and ready, you had
better play it safe and drop in at 5
p.m. instead, for, as with everything
else, there will invariably be a delay.
However, considering the ever-in
creasing pace of modern society,
perhaps most gratifying of all is the
discovery that Italians have not yet
forgotten what it means to linger.
Whether over a meal, at a bar follow
ing a day's work, or on the sidewalk
with passers-by, some tardiness is to
be expected. For better or worse,
domani will always come.
And so amidst the strikes, slow
downs, late letters, and whatever else
was served up, I slowly got the
message. A little delay once in a while
— big deal! Occasional complica
tions are also part of the game and to
be expected — why panic? After all,
what could possibly be so serious that
it could not be smoothed over with
un po' di Chianti, del conversazione,
and a little pazienza?
