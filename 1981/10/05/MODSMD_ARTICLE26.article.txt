## Making war profitable will save flagging defense 
### 
Washington"The —"The trouble," my friend in
sisted, "is that national defense is a losing prop
osition."
I looked puzzled, and she explained what
she meant.
"The Postal Service costs too much, they say;
it ought to break even, or maybe even earn an
honest penny for the hard-pressed govern
ment. Raise the price; reduce the service. We
cannot afford this, we cannot afford that; put
an end to free handouts. Except to the mili
tary."
Well, if we aren't willing to defend the coun
try, the other things won't really matter, I re
minded her.
"I'm not speaking of not defending the
country," she said. "I'm simply telling you that
the Pentagon is not carrying its own weight.
What really surprises me is that all those Rea
gan administration hotshots haven't figured
out the most obvious way the Pentagon could
be made to break even, or even turn a nice
profit. All they have to do is return to the
sterner, simpler virtues of our forefathers. Ev
erybody's forefathers, if you look back far
enough."

Back to what virtues? I asked.
"Back to when a war — at least a winning war
— was expected to pay for itself," she said. "No
enormous payrolls for the armed forces. Sol
diers were paid in loot, a splendid incentive for
enthusiasm and efficiency. Conquered territo
ry was portioned out among the higher-ups,
with the real plums reserved for the govern
ment itself. No foolishness about a defeated
population having to be fed, clothed and
helped back onto its feet by the victors. Those
who could not be effectively enslaved on the
spot could be disposed of in the world slave
market, and everybody with no market value
could be knocked on the head.
"You're talking about a return to
barbarism," I told her
"Nonsense," she said. "I'm talking about a
return to free enterprise, individual initiative,
the play of the marketplace, the profit motive,
a balanced budget, and all the incentive in the
world for ambitious, enterprising citizens to
provide employment and opportunityfortheir
fellow citizens — and the development of
some of the sternest, simple;. virtues known to
mankind."

I admitted her idea intrigued me. The only
problem, I told her, is that the Pentagon no
longer is in the business of war. The whole
point of its massive expenditures is to avoid
war. And without war, there can be no looting,
no slaves, no ransom.
She didn't miss a beat. "Either we're going to
fight, or we're not," she said. "Either way, the
Pentagon could be a self-sustaining operation.
A healthy chunk of the money they spend is for
new weapons systems that make the old ones
obsolete. There's a tremendous market for the
old, outdated stuff.
"Just the other day, the White House secur
ity advisor told us that the AWACS they want to
sell fo the Saudis don't represent a threat to Is
rael. They can't 'see' into Israeli territory
without moving in <o close that they would be
vulnerable to lsra_ fighters. In other words,
the planes are no good to the Saudis, Still, the
Saudis are willing to pay us $5.8 billion for five
of them. The Israelis have bought billions of
dollars worth of military supplies from us. The
75 F-16's they've already ordered from us carry
a price tag of $7 million to $9 million each.
Didn't you read where the administration is

planning to retire 52 Titan II missiles five years
early? Lord knows what those would bring on
the open market.
"You see the potential. With a really first
rate marketing team, we could place enough
orders to the Third World countries alone to
put the Pentagon on a pay-as-you-go basis,
with enough left over to put the Social Security
system on a sound footing.
"That's if there is no war. If we actually go to
war, and win, the potential profits are stagger
ing. Royal jewels, ceremonial masks, oil fields,
strategic minerals, full sets of plate armor with
gold-embroidered over-jupons of silk, not to
mention ransom.
"War or no war, it couldn't miss. Any admin
istration that can claim it has put the Pentagon
on a paying basis could get re-elected forever.
"In the case of war, it would be a little tough
on the losers, I admit. But as we all know, the
time has come to stop gearing our economy to
the losers."

"War or no war, it couldn't miss. Any admin
istration that can claim it has put the Pentagon
on a paying basis could get re-elected forever.
"In the case of war, it would be a little tough
on the losers, I admit. But as we all know, the
time has come to stop gearing our economy to
the losers."

Washington"The —"The trouble," my friend in
sisted, "is that national defense is a losing prop
osition."
I looked puzzled, and she explained what
she meant.
"The Postal Service costs too much, they say;
it ought to break even, or maybe even earn an
honest penny for the hard-pressed govern
ment. Raise the price; reduce the service. We
cannot afford this, we cannot afford that; put
an end to free handouts. Except to the mili
tary."
Well, if we aren't willing to defend the coun
try, the other things won't really matter, I re
minded her.
"I'm not speaking of not defending the
country," she said. "I'm simply telling you that
the Pentagon is not carrying its own weight.
What really surprises me is that all those Rea
gan administration hotshots haven't figured
out the most obvious way the Pentagon could
be made to break even, or even turn a nice
profit. All they have to do is return to the
sterner, simpler virtues of our forefathers. Ev
erybody's forefathers, if you look back far
enough."

Back to what virtues? I asked.
"Back to when a war — at least a winning war
— was expected to pay for itself," she said. "No
enormous payrolls for the armed forces. Sol
diers were paid in loot, a splendid incentive for
enthusiasm and efficiency. Conquered territo
ry was portioned out among the higher-ups,
with the real plums reserved for the govern
ment itself. No foolishness about a defeated
population having to be fed, clothed and
helped back onto its feet by the victors. Those
who could not be effectively enslaved on the
spot could be disposed of in the world slave
market, and everybody with no market value
could be knocked on the head.
"You're talking about a return to
barbarism," I told her
"Nonsense," she said. "I'm talking about a
return to free enterprise, individual initiative,
the play of the marketplace, the profit motive,
a balanced budget, and all the incentive in the
world for ambitious, enterprising citizens to
provide employment and opportunityfortheir
fellow citizens — and the development of
some of the sternest, simple;. virtues known to
mankind."

I admitted her idea intrigued me. The only
problem, I told her, is that the Pentagon no
longer is in the business of war. The whole
point of its massive expenditures is to avoid
war. And without war, there can be no looting,
no slaves, no ransom.
She didn't miss a beat. "Either we're going to
fight, or we're not," she said. "Either way, the
Pentagon could be a self-sustaining operation.
A healthy chunk of the money they spend is for
new weapons systems that make the old ones
obsolete. There's a tremendous market for the
old, outdated stuff.
"Just the other day, the White House secur
ity advisor told us that the AWACS they want to
sell fo the Saudis don't represent a threat to Is
rael. They can't 'see' into Israeli territory
without moving in <o close that they would be
vulnerable to lsra_ fighters. In other words,
the planes are no good to the Saudis, Still, the
Saudis are willing to pay us $5.8 billion for five
of them. The Israelis have bought billions of
dollars worth of military supplies from us. The
75 F-16's they've already ordered from us carry
a price tag of $7 million to $9 million each.
Didn't you read where the administration is

planning to retire 52 Titan II missiles five years
early? Lord knows what those would bring on
the open market.
"You see the potential. With a really first
rate marketing team, we could place enough
orders to the Third World countries alone to
put the Pentagon on a pay-as-you-go basis,
with enough left over to put the Social Security
system on a sound footing.
"That's if there is no war. If we actually go to
war, and win, the potential profits are stagger
ing. Royal jewels, ceremonial masks, oil fields,
strategic minerals, full sets of plate armor with
gold-embroidered over-jupons of silk, not to
mention ransom.
