## Campus comes alive in summer 
### Mark Zeigler 
It is 8 a.m. on a warm summer morning
— the dew on Wilbur field glistens as the
melting process commences. Three hun
dred svelt young girls clad in a vivid array
of dolphin shorts and half-shirts display
their various talents, moving gracefully, as
if in slow motion.
A young man's dream? No, just a sum
mer at Stanford.
Although a large part of the student
body is absent, the summer months at
Stanford are anything but dull.
Three cheerleading camps (described
above), numerous financial conferences, a
corporate track meet, a summer sleep
camp, and more than one hundred other
such gatherings brought 13,149 people to
the campus this summer. Combined with a
full student arts program, summer school,
and student employment opportunities,
this past Stanford summer was packed with
action and excitement.
Lois Fariello, Manager of Conferences,
and Jean Martin, Program Director of
STARTS (Student Arts at Stanford), each
supplied the campus with some of the
tools necessary to provide the University
with a busy schedule of events from June
through September.
Fariello helps replace what Stanford
loses in the summer quarter — people, a
vital element in the successful operation of
many activities. Stanford has become an
increasingly popular conference site for
various organizations ranging from Chi
nese Educators to large corporations.
Most of the conferees live in student res
idences. This summer all dormitories ex
cept for Wilbur Hall and a number of Uni

versity-owned houses, fraternities, and
apartments were used for these con
ferences.
Fariello believes the conference busi
ness during the summer is important as "it
brings prominent people to the campus,"
often from all over the world. In fact, a
three-day symposium on order and dis
order attracted three Nobel laureates.
At the same time, summer conferences
utilize University facilities that would oth
erwise be wasted, while profits obtained
from conferees help support the student
residence system and ultimately reduce
room and board fees for students.
Martin, on the other hand, provides the
conferees, and summer school students
with many ways to occupy their free time.
STARTS, a self-supporting organization,
sponsors a great number of events ranging
from weekly noon concerts to elaborate
art exhibits.
In July, STARTS featured a sculpture,
painting and prints exhibit of artists' works
from behind the Iron Curtain accom
panied by a piano and classical guitar con
cert. STARTS offered a seven week Jazz
Workshop as well as a performance by vio
linist Leon Spierer, the concert master of
the Berlin Philharmonic.
Complementing STARTS was the Stan
ford Summer Theater Workship, a 34
member company that performed eight
productions. There was also a full line-up
of Sunday Flicks, including Take the Mon
ey and Run, Kentucky Fried Movie, and A
Little Romance.
Also on the calendar of events were fre
quent free Coffee House and Encina Sta
tion concerts, a speaking jazz lecture

series, and a wide selection of classes in the
arts.
Martin believes it is important to present
a full program for those here exclusively
for the summer because "we don't want
them to go away thinking the student
union doesn't have much."

Those students not attending summer
school full time worked on campus or in
the immediate area at various jobs. Mary
Wolfe of Student Employment said that
this past summer was much busier than in
1980, as more students stayed on campus
to work during the summer quarter than
ever before. The jobs ranged from "re
search work at Hoover Institute to moving
boxes for the History Department."
Although off-campus jobs usually are
higher paying, the on-campus op
portunities "really ran the gamut" during
the summer of 1981, according to Wolfe.
Summers at Stanford was not the fast
paced Stanford during the academic year.
However, the University certainly did not
operate at a turtle's speed. The summer

Martin believes it is important to present
a full program for those here exclusively
for the summer because "we don't want
them to go away thinking the student
union doesn't have much."

Those students not attending summer
school full time worked on campus or in
the immediate area at various jobs. Mary
Wolfe of Student Employment said that
this past summer was much busier than in
1980, as more students stayed on campus
to work during the summer quarter than
ever before. The jobs ranged from "re
search work at Hoover Institute to moving
boxes for the History Department."
Although off-campus jobs usually are
higher paying, the on-campus op
portunities "really ran the gamut" during
the summer of 1981, according to Wolfe.
Summers at Stanford was not the fast
paced Stanford during the academic year.
However, the University certainly did not
operate at a turtle's speed. The summer
went by gracefully, as if in slow motion —
and that's no dream eitherl
It is 8 a.m. on a warm summer morning
— the dew on Wilbur field glistens as the
melting process commences. Three hun
dred svelt young girls clad in a vivid array
of dolphin shorts and half-shirts display
their various talents, moving gracefully, as
if in slow motion.
A young man's dream? No, just a sum
mer at Stanford.
Although a large part of the student
body is absent, the summer months at
Stanford are anything but dull.
Three cheerleading camps (described
above), numerous financial conferences, a
corporate track meet, a summer sleep
camp, and more than one hundred other
such gatherings brought 13,149 people to
the campus this summer. Combined with a
full student arts program, summer school,
and student employment opportunities,
this past Stanford summer was packed with
action and excitement.
Lois Fariello, Manager of Conferences,
and Jean Martin, Program Director of
STARTS (Student Arts at Stanford), each
supplied the campus with some of the
tools necessary to provide the University
with a busy schedule of events from June
through September.
Fariello helps replace what Stanford
loses in the summer quarter — people, a
vital element in the successful operation of
many activities. Stanford has become an
increasingly popular conference site for
various organizations ranging from Chi
nese Educators to large corporations.
Most of the conferees live in student res
idences. This summer all dormitories ex
cept for Wilbur Hall and a number of Uni

versity-owned houses, fraternities, and
apartments were used for these con
ferences.
Fariello believes the conference busi
ness during the summer is important as "it
brings prominent people to the campus,"
often from all over the world. In fact, a
three-day symposium on order and dis
order attracted three Nobel laureates.
At the same time, summer conferences
utilize University facilities that would oth
erwise be wasted, while profits obtained
from conferees help support the student
residence system and ultimately reduce
room and board fees for students.
Martin, on the other hand, provides the
conferees, and summer school students
with many ways to occupy their free time.
STARTS, a self-supporting organization,
sponsors a great number of events ranging
from weekly noon concerts to elaborate
art exhibits.
In July, STARTS featured a sculpture,
painting and prints exhibit of artists' works
from behind the Iron Curtain accom
panied by a piano and classical guitar con
cert. STARTS offered a seven week Jazz
Workshop as well as a performance by vio
linist Leon Spierer, the concert master of
the Berlin Philharmonic.
Complementing STARTS was the Stan
ford Summer Theater Workship, a 34
member company that performed eight
productions. There was also a full line-up
of Sunday Flicks, including Take the Mon
ey and Run, Kentucky Fried Movie, and A
Little Romance.
Also on the calendar of events were fre
quent free Coffee House and Encina Sta
tion concerts, a speaking jazz lecture

series, and a wide selection of classes in the
arts.
