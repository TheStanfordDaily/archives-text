# Oswald's grave yields body
## 
### 
Dallas (AP) — Working quietly, grave
diggers exhumed the casket of Lee Harvey
Oswald yesterday, and one lawyer said the
body inside appeared to be that of the man
suspected of assassinating President John
Kennedy.
The exhumation and examination of the
remains by pathologists were aimed at en
ding 18 years of speculation and months of
court battles over who was in the grave —
if anyone.
An attorney involved in the case and an
other source who asked not to be identi
fied said pathologists located a mastoidec
tomy scar referred to in Oswald's military
records, but not in his autopsy.
"The odds are very, very good that it's
Oswald," said John Collins, attorney for
Michael Eddowes, a British author and as
sassination theorist. Eddowes contended a
Soviet spy was buried in the plot.
"They're doing the dental workup to
further confirm that it's Oswald," Collins
said. "The only way it could not be Oswald
at this point would be if the dental X-rays
and impressions do not match up with
those from the Marine Corps."
Eddowes issued a statement thanking
the parties involved for "the joint effort to
finally ascertain the truth in this matter."
i "Though surprised, lamin no way disp
pointed in the apparent disproving in my
theory of imposture," Eddowes said.
"Rather, I have accomplished my objec
tion in obtaining the exhumation and I'm
glad for those who have steadfastly main
tained the contrary for whatever reason."
The body was exhumed at Fort Worth's
Rose Hill Burial Park after Oswald's
brother, Robert, dropped his opposition
to the procedure.

A temporary restraining order against
the exhumation that was imposed bya Fort
Worth judge at the request of Robert Os
wald expired at midnight Saturday,
prompting late-night negotiations be
tween attorneys for Oswald's brother and
widow, lawyers said. The judge had sched
uled a hearing for today on whether to ex
tend the order.
The major obstacle in reaching a de
cision, Collins said, was "to overcome
Robert Oswald's opposition — to show
that he had no legal standing to oppose
Marina's position."
An appeals court ruling last month said
Mrs. Porter had the right to decide wheth
er the body was exhumed because she is
Oswald's closest surviving relative. She
had said she believed there was no body in
the grave, but wanted the exhumation to
end speculation.
Robert Oswald, reached at his Wichita
Falls home, declined comment.
The pathologists have made the X-rays
and dental impressions to compare the
teeth with Oswald's military dental rec
ords.
Collins said the casket contained "just
skeletal remains. The casket was so terribly
deteriorated it (the body) could not be re
moved in one piece."
Six private security guards ringed the pe
rimeter of the cemetery and no one was al
lowed inside once the exhumation began
about 7 a.m. Two Fort Worth police of
ficers also were on hand.
Thirty curious people peered over a
fence and news helicopters hovered over
head, breaking the early morning silence
of the eastside neighborhood.
The casket, draped with a white sheet,

was loaded onto a hearse and taken to
Baylor University Medical Center for the
examination.
"We both individually and as a team
have concluded beyond any doubt — and
I mean beyond any doubt — that the indi
vidual buried under the name Lee Harvey
Oswald in Rose Hill Cemetery is Lee
Harvey Oswald," said Dr. Linda Norton,
head of the pathology team.
The exhumation will be paid for by Ed
dowes. Sources estimated the cost at be
tween $8000 and $15,000.
Lee Harvey Oswald defected to the Sovi
et Union in 1959 after he was discharged
from the U.S. Marine Corps. He married a
Soviet woman, Marina, and subsequently
returned to the United States.
Assassination theorists have suggested
that Oswald never returned, but his identi
ty was assumed by a Soviet agent who re
sumed Oswald's life in the United States.
In his book, "The Oswald Files," Ed
dowes contends Oswald never returned
from the Soviet Union. Instead, he says, a
Soviet agent named Alek James Hiddell
was Kennedy's assassin.
In the years since Kennedy's death,
many theories have arisen about the cir
cumstances surrounding the shooting. Os
wald, suspected of killing Kennedy in Dal
las on Nov. 22,1963, was shot to death two
days later by Jack Ruby. Because Oswald
was never brought to trial these doubts
were never settled.
Lyndon Johnson authorized the Warren
comission to investigate the assassination,
but the report has fallen into disrepute.
Skeptics charge that the commission
whitewashed the case.

was loaded onto a hearse and taken to

examination.
"We both individually and as a team
have concluded beyond any doubt — and
I mean beyond any doubt — that the indi
vidual buried under the name Lee Harvey
Oswald in Rose Hill Cemetery is Lee
Harvey Oswald," said Dr. Linda Norton,

Lee Harvey Oswald defected to the Sovi
et Union in 1959 after he was discharged
from the U.S. Marine Corps. He married a
Soviet woman, Marina, and subsequently
returned to the United States.
Assassination theorists have suggested
that Oswald never returned, but his identi
ty was assumed by a Soviet agent who re
sumed Oswald's life in the United States.
In his book, "The Oswald Files," Ed
dowes contends Oswald never returned
from the Soviet Union. Instead, he says, a
Soviet agent named Alek James Hiddell
was Kennedy's assassin.
In the years since Kennedy's death,
many theories have arisen about the cir
cumstances surrounding the shooting. Os
wald, suspected of killing Kennedy in Dal
las on Nov. 22,1963, was shot to death two
days later by Jack Ruby. Because Oswald
was never brought to trial these doubts
were never settled.
Lyndon Johnson authorized the Warren
comission to investigate the assassination,
but the report has fallen into disrepute.
Skeptics charge that the commission
whitewashed the case.
Dallas (AP) — Working quietly, grave
diggers exhumed the casket of Lee Harvey
Oswald yesterday, and one lawyer said the
body inside appeared to be that of the man
suspected of assassinating President John
Kennedy.
The exhumation and examination of the
remains by pathologists were aimed at en
ding 18 years of speculation and months of
court battles over who was in the grave —
if anyone.
An attorney involved in the case and an
other source who asked not to be identi
fied said pathologists located a mastoidec
tomy scar referred to in Oswald's military
records, but not in his autopsy.
"The odds are very, very good that it's
Oswald," said John Collins, attorney for
Michael Eddowes, a British author and as
sassination theorist. Eddowes contended a
Soviet spy was buried in the plot.
"They're doing the dental workup to
further confirm that it's Oswald," Collins
said. "The only way it could not be Oswald
at this point would be if the dental X-rays
and impressions do not match up with
those from the Marine Corps."
Eddowes issued a statement thanking
the parties involved for "the joint effort to
finally ascertain the truth in this matter."
i "Though surprised, lamin no way disp
pointed in the apparent disproving in my
theory of imposture," Eddowes said.
"Rather, I have accomplished my objec
tion in obtaining the exhumation and I'm
glad for those who have steadfastly main
tained the contrary for whatever reason."
The body was exhumed at Fort Worth's
Rose Hill Burial Park after Oswald's
brother, Robert, dropped his opposition
to the procedure.

A temporary restraining order against
the exhumation that was imposed bya Fort
Worth judge at the request of Robert Os
wald expired at midnight Saturday,
prompting late-night negotiations be
tween attorneys for Oswald's brother and
widow, lawyers said. The judge had sched
uled a hearing for today on whether to ex
tend the order.
The major obstacle in reaching a de
cision, Collins said, was "to overcome
Robert Oswald's opposition — to show
that he had no legal standing to oppose
Marina's position."
An appeals court ruling last month said
Mrs. Porter had the right to decide wheth
er the body was exhumed because she is
Oswald's closest surviving relative. She
had said she believed there was no body in
the grave, but wanted the exhumation to
end speculation.
Robert Oswald, reached at his Wichita
Falls home, declined comment.
The pathologists have made the X-rays
and dental impressions to compare the
teeth with Oswald's military dental rec
ords.
Collins said the casket contained "just
skeletal remains. The casket was so terribly
deteriorated it (the body) could not be re
moved in one piece."
Six private security guards ringed the pe
rimeter of the cemetery and no one was al
lowed inside once the exhumation began
about 7 a.m. Two Fort Worth police of
ficers also were on hand.
Thirty curious people peered over a
fence and news helicopters hovered over
head, breaking the early morning silence
of the eastside neighborhood.
