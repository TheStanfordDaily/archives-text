## Dems vow B-1, MX battle 
### 
Davis, W.Va. (AP) â€” Senate Democrats vowed
Saturday to fight President Ronald Reagan's MX
missile and B-1 bomber plans, and one of them
said not one senator spoke out in support of
either proposal.
"The B-1 was a turkey, is a turkey and always
will be a turkey," said Sen. Thomas Eagleton of
Missouri, who added that no Democratic sena
tor endorsed either plan at a Saturday meeting.
All but five of the 46 Senate Democrats were
gathered here for a three-day conference to plot
strategy. Eagleton said the MX and B-1 proposals
Reagan announced Friday were "heavily dis
cussed."
Reagan announced plans to revive the B-1 and
to deploy 100 MX missiles in existing silos rather
than shuttle the missiles among 1000 shelters. He
also advocated development of a radar-avoiding
"Stealth" bomber.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia said the MX plan does not "close the
window of vulnerability" and the B-1 would be
obsolete almost as soon as it was produced.
Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington echoed
Byrd's concern about the MX proposal and pre
dicted Reagan's plan would be altered by Con
gress.
Byrd and Jackson said they favored develop
ing the "Stealth" bomber instead of the B-1.
Byrd described the meeting at scenic Canaan
Valley State Park as "the first step on the way
back to building a majority." Democrats are a
minority in the Senate for the first time since the
Eisenhower administration.

The senators lined up against the B-1 and MX
during a day of meetings, panel disussions and
speeches that urged the Democratic Party to de
velop alternatives to the president's policies.
Pollster Lou Harris told the senators the public
is looking for leadership on defense and eco
nomic issues. He said his polls indicate Ameri
cans are confused because Reagan campaigned
for more defense spending but now wants to cut
the military's budget.
Harris said the Democrats need coherent poli
cies on inflation, productivity, and competition
from foreign manufacturers. He said his polls
show most Americans consider the Japanese su
perior in technology and production.
Pollster Peter Hart said Democrats cannot
counter Reagan's policies and recoup their
losses in the last election without emphasizing
"lifestyle issues."
"The battle is really after the voters under the
age of 40," Hart said. Although many of that
group sided with Reagan in 1980 because of eco
nomic concerns, he said, they are not solidly in
the GOP camp.
Hart saw the political climate as very unset
tled, Reagan's tax cut proposals being balanced
by his benefit cuts.
And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York said the Democrats need a strategy to win
back seats in the South and the West.
"We are a party which has lost most of its seats
west of the Mississippi," he said. "You have to
look very hard to find many."
