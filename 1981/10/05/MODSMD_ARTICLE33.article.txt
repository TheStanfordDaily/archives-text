# Public mixed on AWACS
## 
### 
New York (AP)— Americans
are sharply divided over the
Reagan administration's pro
posed sale of AWACS planes to
Saudi Arabia, according to the
latest Associated Press-NBC
News poll.
The telephone poll of 1601
adults contacted in a scientific
random sampling Sept. 28-29
also said Americans are split
over whether the AWACS sale
would increase the chances of
war in the Middle East or mean
the United States would have
to increase its military aid to Is
rael.
The Reagan administration's
proposed $8.5 billion sale in
cludes five Boeing 707 jets
equipped with special early
warning radar systems which
could allow the Saudis to spot
approaching aircraft from as far
as 350 miles away.
The president has said the
sale would help ensure peace
and defend the valuable Saudi

oil fields, but senators who op
pose the sale say they have
more than enough votes to
block it.
Forty percent of the re
spondents in the latest poll said
they oppose the sale, with 25
percent in favor and 35 percent
not sure. That indicates a slight
shift of public opinion for the
sale since the May AP-NBC
News poll showed 54 percent
opposed, 19 percent in favor
and 27 percent unsure about
the sale.
Among those who had an
opinion about the sale, 46 per
cent said they think selling the
AWACS to Saudi Arabia will in
crease the chances of war in
the Middle East. Fifteen per
cent said the sale would de
crease the chances of war in
the Middle East, 35 percent said
the sale would make no dif
ference and 4 percent were not
sure.

By 47-42 percent, re
spondents said the AWACS
sale would mean the United
States will have to increase its
military aid to Israel.
Among all respondents, 43
percent said the United States
should not sell arms or military
equipment to any foreign
country.
On the question of the
AWACS sale, people who op
posed the sale said it would in
crease the chances of war and
require more military aid to Is
rael, while respondents who
favored the sale said it would
decrease the chances of war
and would not mean more U.S.
arms aid to Israel.
Men were about evenly
divided on the AWACS sale,
but women were 3-1 against it.
Among religious groups, Jews
overwhelmingly opposed the
sale and said it would increase
the chances of war and mean
more U.S. military aid to Israel.
