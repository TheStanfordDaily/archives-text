# Apathetic New Jersey gubernatorial race Reaganomics test
## 
### Washington Post 
New Brunswick, N.J. — For a race that is
supposed to have national significance as a
test of public reaction to "Reaganomics,"
the New Jersey governorship campaign is at
tracting relatively little attention in the place
that counts most — New Jersey.
A poll released last week by the Eagleton
Institute of Politics at Rutgers University
found only half the registered voters
sampled could, without prompting, name
the candidates: former assembly speaker
Thomas Kean (R) and Rep. James Florio (D).
A debate between the candidates Thursday
night got far-from-banner coverage in the
papers.
"It's like shouting down a well," said a me
dia adviser to one of the candidates. "It just
gets swallowed up."
Part of the problem is the New Jersey pre
dicament of having no VHF television sta
tions of its own, which means most news gets
filtered through Philadelphia or New York;
the debate Thursday was carried only on a
UHF public broadcasting station. Also, both
candidates have accepted public financing,
with a spending limit of $2.1 million, so they
are hoarding their advertising money for the

closing drive. And the absence of an incum
bent in the race — Gov. Brendan Byrne, must
step down after two terms — makes it harder
for the voters to focus.
Still, the race is legitimately of interest out
side the Garden State. New Jersey and Vir
ginia are the only states electing governors
this year, and the results will be interpreted
willy-nilly as a measure of the health of the
Republican Party one year after President
Ronald Reagan's election.
There is a lot of disagreement about how
fair that test will be in the case of New Jersey.
On paper, Florio ought to be a strong favor
ite. The Eagleton Poll had him 8 points up but
noted that half the supporters of both men
said they might change their minds before
Election Day.
Democrats have controlled the governor's
office in Trenton for 24 of the last 28 years
and have a big registration edge. Florio, 44,
who was elected to the House in 1974, has
built a strong legislative record as a defender
of railroad passenger service and an ad
vocate of stiff cleanup measures for toxic
waste dumps — both issues with bipartisan
appeal.
He comes from south Jersey, an area in

creasingly sensitive to its lack of influence in
state government. In the June primary,
Florio was able to create such a solid block
vote in the eight southern counties that he
defeated 12 northern candidates.
John Wisniewski, a strategist in his cam
paign, likens his situation to that of Jimmy
Carter in the 1976 presidential contest: "If
Jim can get south Jersey to vote for him as a
southerner and the north Jersey cities to vote
for him as a Democrat, there's no way he can
be beat."
But Kean has solid credentials of his own,
and a "time for a change" theme that shows
up in all the polls and worries Florio. Byrne is
going out of office as an unpopular gov
ernor; the recent naming of the
Meadowlands sports arena for him is viewed
universally as a symbol of his political in
sensitivity. In the debate Thursday night,
Florio was walking a narrow line-defending
the Democratic record while asserting that
his style of governing would not resemble
Byrne's.
Kean has made the economic situation of
the state the focus of his campaign. The
wealthy son of a family long prominent in
state politics, Kean, 46, built a record as a po

litical moderate in the legislature.
Seeking to separate himself from the pack
in this year's eight-man primary, Kean put all
his emphasis on a tax-cutting plan that he
said would complement Reagan's national
strategy and enable the state, which lost
80,000 manufacturing jobs in the last eight
years, to compete better for industry.
Kean's plan, which helped him win the
primary, calls for a complete phaseout of the
corporate-net-worth tax, a reduction of the
corporate-income tax and an eventual re
duction in the sales tax.
Florio calls the Kean plan "unrealistic,"
and says it would force the same kind of "se
vere" slashes in state services that Reagan's
tax cuts have brought in federal aid. Kean, in
turn, has accused Florio of perpetuating "big
government" of the Carter-Byrne model
and has pressed him to pledge that he will
not increase state taxes — a pledge Florio so
far has refused to make.
Private polls show that in New Jersey, as
elsewhere, the very broad initial support for
Reagan's economic program is polarizing on
partisan lines — a threat to Kean. "We'd like
to bring the campaign back to state issues,"

says Roger Bodman, Kean's campaign man
ager.
To that end, Kean has publicly dissented
from administration policies on Social Secur
ity cuts, the environment, mass-transit sub
sidies and the sale of Aircraft Warning and
Control System planes to Saudi Arabia, and
has supported the Equal Rights Amendment.
But his basic strategy is still to split the
dominant blue-collar vote
ing, anti-taxing stance, as Reagan did in car
rying New Jersey by almost 400,000 votes a
year ago. Eager to consolidate that victory
and gain leverage on the redisricting of the
15 House seats, the national GOP is con
tributing almost half of a $2.1 million fund
the state GOP will spend to supplement
Kean's own campaign.
Reagan himself is scheduled for a mid-Oc
tober visit; Vice President George Bush has
been in twice and is coming back once more,
and there will be a parade of Cabinet of
ficials, led by Secretary of Labor Raymond
Donovan, who ran Reagan's New Jersey
campaign.
