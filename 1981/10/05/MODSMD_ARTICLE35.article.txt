## Lose fourth in a row 17-13 Cardinals stall, snapped up by Arizona Wildcats 
### Mike Oneal 
Tuscon, Ariz. — As an old cowboy once
said, "It's crying time again."
It's also time to rant and rave and throw
things, to re-evaluate and regroup.
But mostly it's time that Stanford played
a complete footbail game. High time.
The Cardinals dropped their Pacific-10
conference opener 17-13 to a less than
dazzling Arizona team Saturday night put
ting themselves in a rather precarious posi
tion. Down 0-4 for the season, Stanford
moves into the heart of its schedule against
the top four teams in the conference win
less and without momentum. UCLA will be
here next week, after which the Cards face
No. 1 USC, then Arizona State and then
Washington the next three Saturdays.
That'll be Pepto Bismol time.
Stanford posted only 266 total offensive
yards Saturday and quarterback John
Elway completed a mere 14 of 34 passes for
152 yards and one touchdown. That com
pares with the Cardinals' average of 359.3
total yards per game so far this season and
267 passing yards. That might not tell the
entire story of the game had the Cards run
their way to respectability, but despite
halfback Darrin Nelson's 93-yard effort, in
the Cards 37 rushing attempts, they ran for
a spare 114 yards.
With play calling somewhat reminiscent
of former head coach Rod Dowhower
(who left Stanford two years ago to coach
with the Denver Broncos) Stanford of
fensive coordinator jim Fassel is develop
ing a pattern of using the run to set up the
potentially awsome yet always well-cov
ered Cardinal passing attack. While the
reasoning is good, Saturday's game
seemed to indicate that such an offensive
scheme somewhat paralyzes the passing
attack.
Elway completed very few long passes
and overthrew a number of them. The
Stanford aerial attack has always worked
most efficiently when varying the distance
and field position of the passes themselves
is used to shake up the defense. The ex
plosiveness of the Stanford offense seems
to have been subverted somewhat by a
dragged-out running attack.

"I think it's time for us to evaluate who
we are and what we are and how good we
are," Stanford head coach Paul Wiggin
said. "We have yet to score on offense the
way we need to. We can't really generate
any offense and points. We have dropped
balls, missed blocks and just missed op
portunities. I don't know what it is. We just
can't seem to click in all areas."
The one area where Stanford has clicked
most is defense. The Cards rushed Arizona
quarterback Tom Tunnicliff like bats out of
hell in the first half, sacking the 6-foot
sophomore twice, causingonefumble and
recovering another. Outside linebacker
Tom Hall was particularly impressive with
his in-your-face blocked pass on the Wild
cats' first possession, a blind side dump of
Tunnicliff on their third possession and his
recovery of the quarterback's fumble four
plays later.
Left tackle Doug Rodgers posted four
tackles and caused the second Arizona
fumble in the first half, and freshman out
side linebacker Garin Veris had the second
sack.
The Cardinal offense needed three
possessions and Hall's fumble recovery at
the Arizona 43-yard line to get charged up
enough to score in the first half.
With 3:18 left in the first quarter, Elway
took over and after two Nelson runs for
three yards, hit tight end Chris Dressel
over the middle for 13 yards and a first
down. Nelson got the call again from the
Arizona 26-yard line and was tackled for a
three-yard loss on the next play. Elway, on
second-and-13, ran out of bounds for an
other 2-yard loss.
On the next down, though, Elway hit
halfback Vincent White with a 31-yard loft
to the end zone and capped a 43-yard
drive in classic Stanford do-it-when
you're-down style.
Arizona threatened at the end of the
quarter when tailback Brian Holland broke
away for a 24-yard gallop, but Veris' sack
stopped the drive and the Wildcats had to
wait through three more exchanges
before barefoot kicker Brett Weber
booted a 29-yard field goal with 5:53 left in
the half, bringing the score to 7-3.

Stanford's next drive flopped, but Greg
Topp's 51-yard-on-the-roll punt put Ari
zona in a hole at their own 5-yard line.
Three plays later, the Wildcats punted and
Nelson returned the ball to the Arizona 31-
yard line.
Stanford stalled again, though, and
called on ace kicker Mark Harmon, who is
6-for-6 this season, to rip a 43-yard field
goal to put the Cards ahead 10-3.
The second half was a different matter.
Arizona charged out of the locker room
and down the field to score on an 80-yard
drive in 14 medium-range plays. They sim
ply pushed a bending Stanford defense
back on its heels. When Brad Holland
broke a three-down Cardinal goal line
stand to score with 8:14 left in the third
quarter, the momentum had shifted
toward Arizona.
Stanford worked the ball up to the Ari
zona 29-yard line with 10 running plays
and two passing plays on their next
possession and Harmon kicked a 47-yard
field goal to make the score 13-10 in favor
of Stanford.
The drive was a tenuous one, though,
saved by an Arizona off-side penalty which
gave Stanford a first down after fullback
Rob Moore was hit for a seven yard loss at
third-and-two on the Arizona 32-yard line.
The offense wasn't truly clicking.
The teams then exchanged the ball four
times before the Wildcats iced the cake.
Aided by a pass interference penalty on
Cardinal defensive back Eric Price which
put the ball in Stanford territory, Arizona
marched frorr* tlieir own 25 to the Cardinal
42-yard line. From there, halfback Holland
took the ball from Tunnicliff and tucked it
under his arm in the backfield to draw in
the linebackers. Unfortunately for Stan
ford, he also coaxed free safety Steve
Lemon far enough in to allow flanker Bob
Carter to slip open for a 42-yard halfback
touchdown pass.
Stanford battled up field in the 5:17 re
mainingtothe Arizona 12-yard line, buton
second-and ten, Elway overthrew Dressle
in the endzone and the Cats broke up the
last two plays to stop the drive and com
plete the win.

back Tom Tunnicliff here durring the first half of Stanford's loss to Arizona in Tuscon. Such pres

only three points.

down. Nelson got the call again from the
Arizona 26-yard line and was tackled for a
three-yard loss on the next play. Elway, on
second-and-13, ran out of bounds for an
other 2-yard loss.
On the next down, though, Elway hit
halfback Vincent White with a 31-yard loft
to the end zone and capped a 43-yard
drive in classic Stanford do-it-when
you're-down style.
Arizona threatened at the end of the
quarter when tailback Brian Holland broke
away for a 24-yard gallop, but Veris' sack
stopped the drive and the Wildcats had to
wait through three more exchanges
before barefoot kicker Brett Weber
booted a 29-yard field goal with 5:53 left in
the half, bringing the score to 7-3.

Stanford's next drive flopped, but Greg
Topp's 51-yard-on-the-roll punt put Ari
zona in a hole at their own 5-yard line.
Three plays later, the Wildcats punted and
Nelson returned the ball to the Arizona 31-
yard line.
Stanford stalled again, though, and
called on ace kicker Mark Harmon, who is
6-for-6 this season, to rip a 43-yard field
goal to put the Cards ahead 10-3.
The second half was a different matter.
Arizona charged out of the locker room
and down the field to score on an 80-yard
drive in 14 medium-range plays. They sim
ply pushed a bending Stanford defense
back on its heels. When Brad Holland
broke a three-down Cardinal goal line
stand to score with 8:14 left in the third
quarter, the momentum had shifted
toward Arizona.
Stanford worked the ball up to the Ari
zona 29-yard line with 10 running plays
and two passing plays on their next
possession and Harmon kicked a 47-yard
field goal to make the score 13-10 in favor
of Stanford.
The drive was a tenuous one, though,
saved by an Arizona off-side penalty which
gave Stanford a first down after fullback
Rob Moore was hit for a seven yard loss at
third-and-two on the Arizona 32-yard line.
The offense wasn't truly clicking.
The teams then exchanged the ball four
times before the Wildcats iced the cake.
Aided by a pass interference penalty on
Cardinal defensive back Eric Price which
put the ball in Stanford territory, Arizona
marched frorr* tlieir own 25 to the Cardinal
42-yard line. From there, halfback Holland
took the ball from Tunnicliff and tucked it
under his arm in the backfield to draw in
the linebackers. Unfortunately for Stan
ford, he also coaxed free safety Steve
Lemon far enough in to allow flanker Bob
Carter to slip open for a 42-yard halfback
touchdown pass.
Stanford battled up field in the 5:17 re
mainingtothe Arizona 12-yard line, buton
second-and ten, Elway overthrew Dressle
in the endzone and the Cats broke up the
last two plays to stop the drive and com
plete the win.

HUNTING HEADS — Jay Summers, a 6-5, 225 fifth year senior, applies pressure to Wildcat quarter
back Tom Tunnicliff here durring the first half of Stanford's loss to Arizona in Tuscon. Such pres
sure by Stanford was common in the first half causing two Arizona fumbles and holding the Cats to
only three points.
Tuscon, Ariz. — As an old cowboy once
said, "It's crying time again."
It's also time to rant and rave and throw
things, to re-evaluate and regroup.
But mostly it's time that Stanford played
a complete footbail game. High time.
The Cardinals dropped their Pacific-10
conference opener 17-13 to a less than
dazzling Arizona team Saturday night put
ting themselves in a rather precarious posi
tion. Down 0-4 for the season, Stanford
moves into the heart of its schedule against
the top four teams in the conference win
less and without momentum. UCLA will be
here next week, after which the Cards face
No. 1 USC, then Arizona State and then
Washington the next three Saturdays.
That'll be Pepto Bismol time.
Stanford posted only 266 total offensive
yards Saturday and quarterback John
Elway completed a mere 14 of 34 passes for
152 yards and one touchdown. That com
pares with the Cardinals' average of 359.3
total yards per game so far this season and
267 passing yards. That might not tell the
entire story of the game had the Cards run
their way to respectability, but despite
halfback Darrin Nelson's 93-yard effort, in
the Cards 37 rushing attempts, they ran for
a spare 114 yards.
With play calling somewhat reminiscent
of former head coach Rod Dowhower
(who left Stanford two years ago to coach
with the Denver Broncos) Stanford of
fensive coordinator jim Fassel is develop
ing a pattern of using the run to set up the
potentially awsome yet always well-cov
ered Cardinal passing attack. While the
reasoning is good, Saturday's game
seemed to indicate that such an offensive
scheme somewhat paralyzes the passing
attack.
Elway completed very few long passes
and overthrew a number of them. The
Stanford aerial attack has always worked
most efficiently when varying the distance
and field position of the passes themselves
is used to shake up the defense. The ex
plosiveness of the Stanford offense seems
to have been subverted somewhat by a
dragged-out running attack.

"I think it's time for us to evaluate who
we are and what we are and how good we
are," Stanford head coach Paul Wiggin
said. "We have yet to score on offense the
way we need to. We can't really generate
any offense and points. We have dropped
balls, missed blocks and just missed op
portunities. I don't know what it is. We just
can't seem to click in all areas."
The one area where Stanford has clicked
most is defense. The Cards rushed Arizona
quarterback Tom Tunnicliff like bats out of
hell in the first half, sacking the 6-foot
sophomore twice, causingonefumble and
recovering another. Outside linebacker
Tom Hall was particularly impressive with
his in-your-face blocked pass on the Wild
cats' first possession, a blind side dump of
Tunnicliff on their third possession and his
recovery of the quarterback's fumble four
plays later.
Left tackle Doug Rodgers posted four
tackles and caused the second Arizona
fumble in the first half, and freshman out
side linebacker Garin Veris had the second
sack.
The Cardinal offense needed three
possessions and Hall's fumble recovery at
the Arizona 43-yard line to get charged up
enough to score in the first half.
With 3:18 left in the first quarter, Elway
took over and after two Nelson runs for
three yards, hit tight end Chris Dressel
over the middle for 13 yards and a first
down. Nelson got the call again from the
Arizona 26-yard line and was tackled for a
three-yard loss on the next play. Elway, on
second-and-13, ran out of bounds for an
other 2-yard loss.

said, "It's crying time again."
It's also time to rant and rave and throw
things, to re-evaluate and regroup.
But mostly it's time that Stanford played
a complete footbail game. High time.
The Cardinals dropped their Pacific-10
conference opener 17-13 to a less than
dazzling Arizona team Saturday night put
ting themselves in a rather precarious posi
tion. Down 0-4 for the season, Stanford
moves into the heart of its schedule against
the top four teams in the conference win
less and without momentum. UCLA will be
here next week, after which the Cards face
No. 1 USC, then Arizona State and then
Washington the next three Saturdays.
That'll be Pepto Bismol time.
Stanford posted only 266 total offensive
yards Saturday and quarterback John
Elway completed a mere 14 of 34 passes for
152 yards and one touchdown. That com
pares with the Cardinals' average of 359.3
total yards per game so far this season and
267 passing yards. That might not tell the
entire story of the game had the Cards run
their way to respectability, but despite
halfback Darrin Nelson's 93-yard effort, in
the Cards 37 rushing attempts, they ran for
a spare 114 yards.
With play calling somewhat reminiscent
of former head coach Rod Dowhower
(who left Stanford two years ago to coach
with the Denver Broncos) Stanford of
fensive coordinator jim Fassel is develop
ing a pattern of using the run to set up the
potentially awsome yet always well-cov
ered Cardinal passing attack. While the
reasoning is good, Saturday's game
seemed to indicate that such an offensive
scheme somewhat paralyzes the passing
attack.
Elway completed very few long passes
and overthrew a number of them. The
Stanford aerial attack has always worked
most efficiently when varying the distance
and field position of the passes themselves
is used to shake up the defense. The ex
plosiveness of the Stanford offense seems
to have been subverted somewhat by a
dragged-out running attack.

"I think it's time for us to evaluate who
we are and what we are and how good we
are," Stanford head coach Paul Wiggin
said. "We have yet to score on offense the
way we need to. We can't really generate
any offense and points. We have dropped
balls, missed blocks and just missed op
portunities. I don't know what it is. We just
can't seem to click in all areas."
The one area where Stanford has clicked
most is defense. The Cards rushed Arizona
quarterback Tom Tunnicliff like bats out of
hell in the first half, sacking the 6-foot
sophomore twice, causingonefumble and
recovering another. Outside linebacker
Tom Hall was particularly impressive with
his in-your-face blocked pass on the Wild
cats' first possession, a blind side dump of
Tunnicliff on their third possession and his
recovery of the quarterback's fumble four
plays later.
Left tackle Doug Rodgers posted four
tackles and caused the second Arizona
fumble in the first half, and freshman out
side linebacker Garin Veris had the second
sack.
The Cardinal offense needed three
possessions and Hall's fumble recovery at
the Arizona 43-yard line to get charged up
enough to score in the first half.
With 3:18 left in the first quarter, Elway
took over and after two Nelson runs for
three yards, hit tight end Chris Dressel
over the middle for 13 yards and a first
down. Nelson got the call again from the
Arizona 26-yard line and was tackled for a
three-yard loss on the next play. Elway, on
second-and-13, ran out of bounds for an
other 2-yard loss.
On the next down, though, Elway hit
halfback Vincent White with a 31-yard loft
to the end zone and capped a 43-yard
drive in classic Stanford do-it-when
you're-down style.
Arizona threatened at the end of the
quarter when tailback Brian Holland broke
away for a 24-yard gallop, but Veris' sack
stopped the drive and the Wildcats had to
wait through three more exchanges
before barefoot kicker Brett Weber
booted a 29-yard field goal with 5:53 left in
the half, bringing the score to 7-3.

Stanford's next drive flopped, but Greg
Topp's 51-yard-on-the-roll punt put Ari
zona in a hole at their own 5-yard line.
Three plays later, the Wildcats punted and
Nelson returned the ball to the Arizona 31-
yard line.
Stanford stalled again, though, and
called on ace kicker Mark Harmon, who is
6-for-6 this season, to rip a 43-yard field
goal to put the Cards ahead 10-3.
The second half was a different matter.
Arizona charged out of the locker room
and down the field to score on an 80-yard
drive in 14 medium-range plays. They sim
ply pushed a bending Stanford defense
back on its heels. When Brad Holland
broke a three-down Cardinal goal line
stand to score with 8:14 left in the third
quarter, the momentum had shifted
toward Arizona.
Stanford worked the ball up to the Ari
zona 29-yard line with 10 running plays
and two passing plays on their next
possession and Harmon kicked a 47-yard
field goal to make the score 13-10 in favor
of Stanford.
The drive was a tenuous one, though,
saved by an Arizona off-side penalty which
gave Stanford a first down after fullback
Rob Moore was hit for a seven yard loss at
third-and-two on the Arizona 32-yard line.
The offense wasn't truly clicking.
The teams then exchanged the ball four
times before the Wildcats iced the cake.
Aided by a pass interference penalty on
Cardinal defensive back Eric Price which
put the ball in Stanford territory, Arizona
marched frorr* tlieir own 25 to the Cardinal
42-yard line. From there, halfback Holland
took the ball from Tunnicliff and tucked it
under his arm in the backfield to draw in
the linebackers. Unfortunately for Stan
ford, he also coaxed free safety Steve
Lemon far enough in to allow flanker Bob
Carter to slip open for a 42-yard halfback
touchdown pass.
Stanford battled up field in the 5:17 re
mainingtothe Arizona 12-yard line, buton
second-and ten, Elway overthrew Dressle
in the endzone and the Cats broke up the
last two plays to stop the drive and com
plete the win.

HUNTING HEADS — Jay Summers, a 6-5, 225 fifth year senior, applies pressure to Wildcat quarter
back Tom Tunnicliff here durring the first half of Stanford's loss to Arizona in Tuscon. Such pres
sure by Stanford was common in the first half causing two Arizona fumbles and holding the Cats to
only three points.
