# Also shoot down Air Force over victorious weekend
## Cards stun No.1 ranked University of Connecticut 
### Sid Spaeth 
Several thousand spec
tators, perhaps the largest
crowd in Stanford soccer
history, looked on Sunday
as an unrated Stanford team
shut out No. 1 ranked Uni
versity of Connecticut 3-0.
Stanford dominated play
for most of the extremely
physical contest and picked
up several miraculous saves
from freshman goaltender
Willie Burkhart to maintain
the shutout.
Offensively, Stanford's
first goal came from the
game plan. Stanford's sec
ond goal came from the
chalkboard. And Stanford's
final goal came from no
where.
Going into Sunday's
game, Stanford Coach
Nelson Lodge knew Con
necticut was going to press
in the offensive zone with
seven players.
"We knew they were
going to bring the defense
up," Lodge said, "so we
knew they would be suscep
tible to the counters."
The strategy worked per
fectly for the first Cardinal
goal. Freshman midfielder
Angel Vasquez took the ball
at midfield and sent a pass
downfield to a streaking
Jorge Titinger.
Titinger outraced two
Connecticut defenders to
the ball and deftly went
around U. Conn goalkeeper
Tony Pierce. All that was left
for Titinger to do was to cas
ually fire the ball past a U.

Conn fullback — the make
shift goalkeeper, to give
Stanford the lead for good.
"It was one-touch, two
touch soccer," Lodge
added, "We had to break up
the monotony with the
counter."
Stanford's second goal, a
still play from the Lodge
handbook that was possibly
ghost-written by Billy
Martin, caught the U. Conn
defense totally unaware.
Throughout the first half,
Stanford players had habit
ually stooped to tie their
shoelaces before penalty
kicks.
When a U. Conn de
fender was whistled for a
foul right outside the penal
ty area, senior Ted
Rafalovich set the ball down
and knelt to tie his shoe.
While the U. Conn wall
and goaltender Pierce
slumped impatiently, Willie
Guicci stepped up and fired
the live ball past the un
suspecting defense and into
the upper right hand corner
of the net.
"The still play we used
when Teddy stooped to tie
his shoelace and Willie fired
the ball in froze the defense
for a second." Lodge ex
plained, "Asecond isallyou
need for the goaltender to
relax enough to give you the
free shot."
After sluggishly warding
off an unrelenting Con
neticut attack midway
through the second half, the
Cardinals managed to get

the ball downfield and in
front of the U. Conn goal.
Renehan was pulled out
from hisgoal by the play and
when the ball rolled to the
corner, Vasquez leisurely
booted the ball toward the
goal. Renehan, returning to
his goal, was disoriented
and could only wave as the
ball sailed by and into the
net.
Stanford goalkeeper
Burkhart empathized with
Renehan.
"Renehan (the usualstart
ing keeper for U. Conn) had
a bad game against USF,"
Burkhart said, "so they
started Roberts. Roberts was
having a tough time so they
put Renehan in.
"It was a tough situation
on that third goal. He came
in and didn't have time to
warm up so I can see where
it would have been tough
on him."
On the (jther end of the
field, the Stanford defense,
Burkhart in particular,
played flawlessly.
For the first 15 minutes of
the second half, U. Conn
put unrelenting pressure on
the Cardinal defense which
had to fall back into a shell.
U. Conn outshot the
Cards 22-13, but many of the
shots were stopped by the
crowd of defenders in front
of the Stanford net.
The seven shots that got
through to Burkhart were all
handled, but it took three

"It was wild out there for a

net."
Pacing the sideline during
the strong attack, Lodge yelled
to his defense to go back to the
long pass — the game plan.
"In the second half we tried
to move the ball out with short

passes," Lodge said, "That just
invited the defense in so we
went back to the counters."
The counters again pulled
Stanford out and U. Conn was
unable to put the pressure
back on Stanford.
Burkhart said that he had ex
pected the U. Conn pressure in
the second half, but that they
would run out of steam.
"I knew from experience
that a team that is ranked No. 1
has a lot of confidence,"
Burkhart said, "I knew that

they were going to press seven
men for the beginning of the
second half so I was ready.
They pressed for 15 minutes,
but the last 30 were all ours."
The Stanford win coupled
with a 3-0 shut out of Air Force
Friday, will almost guarantee
them a spot on the new rank
ings.
The soccer team will kick off
a soccer-football double
header with UCLA Saturday
starting at 10:30 at Harry

necticut was going to press
in the offensive zone with
seven players.
"We knew they were
going to bring the defense
up," Lodge said, "so we
knew they would be suscep
tible to the counters."
The strategy worked per
fectly for the first Cardinal
goal. Freshman midfielder
Angel Vasquez took the ball
at midfield and sent a pass
downfield to a streaking
Jorge Titinger.
Titinger outraced two
Connecticut defenders to
the ball and deftly went
around U. Conn goalkeeper
Tony Pierce. All that was left
for Titinger to do was to cas
ually fire the ball past a U.

Conn fullback — the make
shift goalkeeper, to give
Stanford the lead for good.
"It was one-touch, two
touch soccer," Lodge
added, "We had to break up
the monotony with the
counter."
Stanford's second goal, a
still play from the Lodge
handbook that was possibly
ghost-written by Billy
Martin, caught the U. Conn
defense totally unaware.
Throughout the first half,
Stanford players had habit
ually stooped to tie their
shoelaces before penalty
kicks.
When a U. Conn de
fender was whistled for a
foul right outside the penal
ty area, senior Ted
Rafalovich set the ball down
and knelt to tie his shoe.
While the U. Conn wall
and goaltender Pierce
slumped impatiently, Willie
Guicci stepped up and fired
the live ball past the un
suspecting defense and into
the upper right hand corner
of the net.
"The still play we used
when Teddy stooped to tie
his shoelace and Willie fired
the ball in froze the defense
for a second." Lodge ex
plained, "Asecond isallyou
need for the goaltender to
relax enough to give you the
free shot."
After sluggishly warding
off an unrelenting Con
neticut attack midway
through the second half, the
Cardinals managed to get

the ball downfield and in
front of the U. Conn goal.
Renehan was pulled out
from hisgoal by the play and
when the ball rolled to the
corner, Vasquez leisurely
booted the ball toward the
goal. Renehan, returning to
his goal, was disoriented
and could only wave as the
ball sailed by and into the
net.
Stanford goalkeeper
Burkhart empathized with
Renehan.
"Renehan (the usualstart
ing keeper for U. Conn) had
a bad game against USF,"
Burkhart said, "so they
started Roberts. Roberts was
having a tough time so they
put Renehan in.
"It was a tough situation
on that third goal. He came
in and didn't have time to
warm up so I can see where
it would have been tough
on him."
On the (jther end of the
field, the Stanford defense,
Burkhart in particular,
played flawlessly.
For the first 15 minutes of
the second half, U. Conn
put unrelenting pressure on
the Cardinal defense which
had to fall back into a shell.
U. Conn outshot the
Cards 22-13, but many of the
shots were stopped by the
crowd of defenders in front
of the Stanford net.
