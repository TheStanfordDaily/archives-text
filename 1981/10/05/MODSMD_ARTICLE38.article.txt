### Dick Hodge 
The Stanford women's cross country
team turned in a solid team effort in de
feating a strong field at the UC-Berkeley
Women's Cross Country Invitational meet,
held Saturday at Cal.
Led by junior Kim Schnurpfeil — who set
a new record in placing first with 17:21.5
over the rugged 5000-meter course — the
young team placed five runners in the top
10 slots.
Freshman standout Ceci Hopp took
sceond place in 17:32.8, also breaking the
course record, and sophomore Patti Sue
Plummer captured third place with an im
pressive 17:38.4.
Rounding out the top 10 were freshmen
Anne Locke in sixth place with a 17:46.8,
and Sloan Burton in 10th with a 17:57.8.
Michelle Mason took 12th in 18:04.1 and
Diane Gong placed 28th in 18:46.2.
Stanford's margin of victory of 22 points

over second-place Oregon was spec
tacular. Stanford and Oregon went into
the meet ranked fourth and fifth in the na
tion respectively. The field was rounded
out by teams from Florida State, Brigham
Young, Oregon State, Utah State, Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo, Cal-State Hayward, and
Cal.
Stanford head coach Brooks Johnson
described the competition as "infinitely
tougher than last week," when the
Cardinals excelled at the Fresno 'State
Cross Country Championships.
Johnson was understandably happy with
the results of the race, but cautious in his
comments.
"It's great, but it would be a lot better if
this were November," he said. "I wonder
what we can do for an encore. The runners
think they have to top their performance
every week. We have.to just relax and take
it in stride."
Johnson expressed some concern that,

after dazzling the crowd in Fresno a week
ago by taking the top six spots, the women
might be tired.
After hitting the two-mile mark holding
six of the top seven spots, the Cards did
fade a little bit, perhaps due to the
youhtful make-up of the team — seven of
the ten members are freshmen and still ad
justing to the presures of college.
"Academics are the No.l priority at Stan
ford, and it takes getting used to," said
Johnson. He had special words of praise
for Schnurpfeil, whom he described as a
leader and true team performer.
Schnurpfeil commented that her previous
experience on the hilly and treacherous
course helped her to relax during the
grueling run.
The women continue their promising
season this Saturday, when they join the
men's team in hosting the Stanford Invita
tional.
