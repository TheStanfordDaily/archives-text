# Playoffs begin tommorow
## Major league 2nd season ends 
### Associated Press 
Don't tell the Cincinnati
Reds or the St. Louis Cardinals
how the split-season format in
baseball created more interest
down the stretch. Each had the
best overall record in their
divisions in this mixed-up crazy
season, but when the mini
playoffs get rolling tommorow,
the Reds and Cardinals will be
home watching.
The Reds' overall record was
not only the best in the Na
tional League West, but tops in
baseball. They had the mis
fortune, however, of finishing
just a half-game behind the Los
Angeles Dodgers in the first
half of the season and then los
ing out to the Houston Astros
bn the next to last day of the
second season. Cincinnati was
the only team to play over .600
for the entire season.
The Cardinals finished as the
runnerup to Philadelphia in
the first half and the Expos in
the second half, but overall,
their record was the best in the
National League East. Cincin
nati and St. Louis between
them had two of the five best
records in the majors, but now
have all winter to gripe about
the inequities of the system.
"We had our chances," said
the Reds' Tom Seaver. "You
can moan all you want about
the split season, we had our
chances to win."
Cincinnati Manager John

McNamara was not quite so
diplomatic.
"It's been a mess, that's what
it's been."he said. "To get
cheated out of it by some
body's lamebrain idea is ridicu
lous."
Before their season-ending
game in Cincinnati yesterday,
the entire Reds team was in
troduced to the fans. They
lined up carrying pennant pro
claiming, "Baseball's Best Rec
ord 1981."
The best-of-five mini
playoffs open tommorow with
the Kansas City Royals hosting
the Oakland A's and the Astros
at home against the Dodgers.
Wednesday, the Yankees are in
Milwaukee and the Expos host
the Phillies. The second half
champions are at home for the
first two games with the first
half champions given the ad
vantage of having the final
three home games, if neces
sary.
The A's and Royals open the
third season tommorow after
noon in Kansas City. Billy
Martin will pitch Mike Norris
(12-9) while Dick Howser coun
ters with Dennis Leonard
(13-11). Ironically, Howser suc
ceeded Martin as the manager
of the New York Yankees in
1980. Martin was fired twice by
George Steinbrenner while
Howser enjoyed the honor just
once.
In tommorow's other game,

rookie sensation Fernando
Valenzuela (13-7) opposes
Nolan Ryan (11-5) in the
Astrodome. Just last week Ryan
threw a no-hitter against the
Dodgers.
Each of the four divisions has
a team that finished undeT .500
in one of the two seasons. The
Yankees and Phillies were un
der .500 in the second season
while the Royals and Astros lost
more than half their games in
the first season. And, Kansas
City's cumulative season rec
ord did not reach .500 despite a
good second half.
Philadelphia, New York and
Los Angeles will all have to ov
ercome the momentum gener
ated by the second-half win
ners while the Royals and A's
were evenly matched in the
second season. With little re
ward for finishing first in both
halves, there was limited incen
tive for the first half winners to
play hard every night. Whether
thoseteamscan turn it on again
for the mini-playoffs is in ques
tion.
The Phillies will not only
have to handle the Expos, but
the expected frigid Montreal
weather as well.
"Hey, the cold's tough on
their team, too," Phillies Man
ager Dallas Green said. "Even
though they're from Montreal,
you never get used to playing
in that weather."
Steve Carlton (13-4) opposes

Steve Rogers (12-8) Wednesday
afternoon, which is a break
weather-wise. Thursday, they
will have to play at night.
"We knew that whoever we
played we'd get a good game.
Montreal's pitching is ahead of
everybody else's," Green said.
"If you pin it right down, prob
ably ahead of us. I think we're
capable of scoring. It's up to
the pitching staff to do their
job. That's all."
The Expos, who lost out to
the Pirates and Phillies on the
final weekend of the last two
seasons, have the edge to make
it to the league championship
series, which begin 0ct.13.
"We're all young and we've
been in a pennant race two
years in a row," Montreal first
baseman Warren Cromartie
said. "We grew with that. We
grieved with the pain of losing
on the last weekend two years
in a row. It was only fate that we
win it this time."
In the AL East showdown, the
Yankees will open with Ron
Guidry (11-5) at County Stadi
um against the Brewers, who
will go with Moose Haas (11-7).
And while this is going on,
McNamara will be home
seething.
"I hope this thing goes till
Halloween so he (baseball
commissioner Bowie Kuhn)
can wear a mask or something
for the final game of the World
Series," McNamara said.

the first half and the Expos in
the second half, but overall,

records in the majors, but now
have all winter to gripe about

"We had our chances," said

Cincinnati Manager John

The best-of-five mini
playoffs open tommorow with
the Kansas City Royals hosting
the Oakland A's and the Astros
at home against the Dodgers.
Wednesday, the Yankees are in
Milwaukee and the Expos host
the Phillies. The second half
champions are at home for the
first two games with the first
half champions given the ad
vantage of having the final
three home games, if neces
sary.
The A's and Royals open the
third season tommorow after
noon in Kansas City. Billy
Martin will pitch Mike Norris
(12-9) while Dick Howser coun
ters with Dennis Leonard
(13-11). Ironically, Howser suc
ceeded Martin as the manager
of the New York Yankees in
1980. Martin was fired twice by
George Steinbrenner while
Howser enjoyed the honor just
once.
In tommorow's other game,

rookie sensation Fernando
Valenzuela (13-7) opposes
Nolan Ryan (11-5) in the
Astrodome. Just last week Ryan
threw a no-hitter against the
Dodgers.
Each of the four divisions has
a team that finished undeT .500
in one of the two seasons. The
Yankees and Phillies were un
der .500 in the second season
while the Royals and Astros lost
more than half their games in
the first season. And, Kansas
City's cumulative season rec
ord did not reach .500 despite a
good second half.
Philadelphia, New York and
Los Angeles will all have to ov
ercome the momentum gener
ated by the second-half win
ners while the Royals and A's
were evenly matched in the
second season. With little re
ward for finishing first in both
halves, there was limited incen
tive for the first half winners to
play hard every night. Whether
thoseteamscan turn it on again
for the mini-playoffs is in ques
tion.
The Phillies will not only
have to handle the Expos, but
the expected frigid Montreal
weather as well.
"Hey, the cold's tough on
their team, too," Phillies Man
ager Dallas Green said. "Even
though they're from Montreal,
you never get used to playing
in that weather."
Steve Carlton (13-4) opposes

Steve Rogers (12-8) Wednesday
afternoon, which is a break
weather-wise. Thursday, they
will have to play at night.
"We knew that whoever we
played we'd get a good game.
Montreal's pitching is ahead of
everybody else's," Green said.
"If you pin it right down, prob
ably ahead of us. I think we're
capable of scoring. It's up to
the pitching staff to do their
job. That's all."
The Expos, who lost out to
the Pirates and Phillies on the
final weekend of the last two
seasons, have the edge to make
it to the league championship
series, which begin 0ct.13.
"We're all young and we've
been in a pennant race two
years in a row," Montreal first
baseman Warren Cromartie
said. "We grew with that. We
grieved with the pain of losing
on the last weekend two years
in a row. It was only fate that we
win it this time."
In the AL East showdown, the
Yankees will open with Ron
Guidry (11-5) at County Stadi
um against the Brewers, who
will go with Moose Haas (11-7).
And while this is going on,
McNamara will be home
