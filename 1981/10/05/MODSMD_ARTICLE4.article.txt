# Research monies to decline
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
For the first time in a number of
years, the University will probably
see a real dollar decline in the federal
funding of research programs, Presi
dent Donald Kennedy told the Facul
ty Senate Thursday.
Federal budget cuts of approx
imately 12 percent now appear
"almost certain," he said.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) is among the national

laboratories that can expect major
funding cuts, he said.
If research agencies — such as the
National Science Foundation, Na
tional Institute of Health, and other
groups — are funded in a "more dis
cretionary fashion," the competitive
ness of our programs may serve to re
duce the amount of our loss, Ken
nedy said. He said that historically,
Stanford has done well in a "down
market."
The senate, made up of faculty
members elected by their depart
ments, meets every other Thursday
afternoon in the Law School under
the gavel of its new chairman David
Abernethy, Assoc. Prof, of Political
Science. The senate is the primary
policy-making body of the Univer
sity.
Summarizing the major summer
events, Kennedy noted the increased
summer session enrollment. He also
noted the success of the Interna
tional Symposium on Order and Dis
order, sponsored by the Humanities
Center, which brought many dist
inguished scholars to campus.
His praise continued for the fall
orientation program. "It strikes me as
amazing that each year 400 returning
students come back early ?o partici
pate in orienting new students. It's an
extraordinary credit to the vigor of

the place."
The orientation program was
"conspicuously better organized"
this year, Kennedy said, and he com
plimented the "impressive pre-sea
son training program for R.A.'s."
Albert Hastorf, vice president and
provost, reported the formation of
two new committees, one which will
examine overseas studies, and one
which will study academic programs
in physical education.
In its first action of the new school
year, the senate adopted the report
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids. Com
mittee chairman Tjeerd van Andel
explained that the group reviewed
the flexibility of the admissions poli
cy. He said the report simply reaf
firms the committee's 1978 ad
missions policy statement.
The senate also approved the re
port of the Committee of Fifteen, a
University committee that predates
the senate itself. The report sets spe
cific guidelines, for the first time, es
tablishing the official makeup of the
committee. It also amends the Legis
lative and Judicial Charter — which
contains regulations governing stu
dent conduct and procedures for
their enforcement — to eliminate
sexist language.
