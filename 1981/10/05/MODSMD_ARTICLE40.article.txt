After a more than 30-year
absence, the Stanford polo
team has re-emerged on cam
pus as an operational club
sport.
Owing to strong support
from the local polo communi
ty, in less than a year the team
has aquired the necessary polo
ponies, tack and equipment to
field a competitive group. Also,
it has secured stall space at
Webb Ranch just off-campus,
and has the use of an official
sized polo field adjacent to the
stables.
Although a seemingly gen
tile sport, the game of polo
places great physical demands
on the competitors. Four
players on each team move up
and down a 300-yard grass field
in bursts of speed up to 40 miles
per hour, while attempting to
hit a ball no larger than the size
of a baseball with a 50-inch
mallet, sporting a mere 2-inch
head.
This requires the player,
even though at a full gallop, to
lean frighteningly far over
either side of his horse in order
to hit the ball either forward or
backward.
Defensively, though there is
no goalie, the game allows
players a tremendous amount
of physical contact in attempt
ing to regain the ball from an
opponent. For example, a
player may "hook" an oppos
ing players' mallet if that oppo
nent is in the act of hitting.
A player is also permitted to
"ride off" an opponent in
possesion of the ball by steer

ing his horse into that oppo
nents' pony.
Obviously, given the speed
at which the game is played,
such moves require both fi
nesse and physical condition
ing from both the horse and
rider at all times if they are to
escape without broken
kneecaps, skulls, or other.
The 1981-82 Stanford club
promises to be competitive
with neighboring clubs
throughout Northern Califor
nia. The club is coached by
W.F. Linfoot and Dr. Thomas
Schulte, and is assisted by two
Stanford faculty advisors, Dr.
Quasim Mehdi, and Dr. H.

Mac Con nell.
The team presently shapes
up as having a strong women's
side, and a rapidly developing
men's squad. Competing for
the women this year are
Tamara Miltis, Mariana Men
ninger, Heather Vande Weghe,
and Jane McConnell. As for the
men, a starting lineup has not
yet been decided on.
Those students sucessful at
tryouts will immediately be im
mersed in the tenets of polo
both on and off the field. "Af
ter all," mused one of the
coaches, "polo is not a sport,
it's a way of life."
