Stanford's NCAA championship water polo
team once again showed it's might bycruisingto
an effortless win in the NorCal Water Polo tour
ney held at deGuerre pools Friday and Saturday.
Stanford, playing in the large school bracket
of the tourney, faced three opponents Friday in
the preliminary round. The Cardinals downed
cal-State Hayward 17-3, defeated the University
of Pacific 9-6, and floated past Cal-State Full
erton 14-4 to garner first place in their division
and set up Saturday's matches, against UC-
Berkeley and Santa Barbara.
Stanford went head-to-head against Cal at 8
a.m., and the Bears showed little of their past wa
ter polo excellence. Stanford jumped to a 2-0
first period lead and exploded for seven more
goals in the next two periods to lead 9-2 going
into the final quarter.
Stanford repeatedly scored on the fast break
and took full advantage of their man-up situ
ations to pile up the points against the hapless
Bears. Cal failed to hold its own against the
Cardinal bench as the substitutes outscored the
Bears 4-2 in the last period to make the final
score 13-4.
After the Berkeley game, Santa Barbara was
the only obstacle standing in the way of a tour
nament victory, and they were manhandled as
easily as was Berkeley. The Stanford fast break
exploded past the Gauchos, making the score
5-1 at the end of period one, and 9-2 at the end
of period three.
An equally impressive story was that of Stan
ford's defensive play. The Gauchos were unable
to score unless they were a man-up, and even
then they were repeatedly denied by a tight
Stanford press, and the reach of goal-keeper
Vince Vaneili. Stanford scored three more goals
in the final period to make the score 12-3 and
win the tourney with a 5-0 record.
Cardinal head coach Dante Dettamanti was

extremely pleased with his squad, especially by
the fact no one player dominated in every game.
"We had a different leading scorer in every
game," he pointed out. He was also pleased with
the Cardinals' fast break, which has been Stan
ford's main offensive threat for many years, and
seems to be quicker and more accurate than
ever this season.
Dettamanti also praised goal keeper Vaneili
for "steady play and pinpoint passing out of the
goal," which is crucial in setting up the Stanford
counter-attack.
Dettamanti was also exceedingly happy with
the play of his second unit. "The second team
has really picked up and played well," he said.
"The eastern road trip (the Cardinals are just re
turned from a series of victories over 10 eastern
teams, including Yale, Harvard, and Ford ham) al
lowed everyone a chance to play and work to
gether."
It should be noted that the Cardinals have a
great amount of depth, as is evinced by wide
spread and diverse scoring among the players.
The Cardinal bench also outscored its oppo
nents in every quarter they played in the tour
ney.
The Stanford 'B' team, largely composed of
freshmen, made a respectable showing in the
small school bracket. The frosh team lost to West
Valley 11-8, but defeated UC-Davis 'B' 11-6, and
San Francisco State 8-7. Assistant coach Steve
Smith said his frosh are "working hard and have
a lot of potential."
There are no official NCAA rankings as of yet,
but Dettamanti listed the following teams as the
top five: Stanford, UCLA, UC-lrvine, Santa
Barbara, and Long Beach State.
Stanford faces two of the top five this week
end at deGuerre pool. The Cards will meet the
UC-lrvine Anteaters friday at 3 p.m., and, in their
first Pacific-10 match, the UCLA Bruins Saturday
at 10 a.m.
