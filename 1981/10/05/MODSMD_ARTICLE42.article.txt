Washington (AP) — Safety
Dwight Hicks recovered a
fumble and returned it 80 yards
for one score and intercepted a
pass and returned it 32 yards for
a second yesterday to lead the
San Francisco 49ers to a con
vincing 30-17 National Football
League victory over the winless
Washington Redskins.
The victory upped the 49er
record to 3-2 while dropping
the Redskins to 0-5 under new
head coach Joe Gibbs, the
team's worst start in 17 years.
Hicks picked a Redskin
fumble out of midair five
minutes into the game and
raced 80 yards down the side
line to give the 49ers an early
14-0 lead.
In the third quarter, with the
49ers ahead 24-3, Hicks picked
off a Joe Theismann pass and
rambled 72 yards before being
broughtdown onthe Washing
ton 22.

After the Redskins got the
ball right back on an intercep
tion of their own, Hicks went
back to work, intercepting
Theismann's first pass and re
turning it 32 yards for a 30-3 San
Francisco lead.
Hicks' first touchdown
marked the longest touch
down on a fumble recovery in
49er history and the first time
the 49ers had returned a
fumble for a score in five years.
The Redskin fans got a
chance to cheer in the fourth
quarter when Mike Nelms,
who earlier in the day returned
a kick 55 yards, ran a Jim Miller
punt back 58 yards for a touch
down to close the gap to 30-10
with 10:33 remaining.
The Redskins, on offense
again after recovering a
fumble, moved 30 yards in
eight plays with halfback Joe
Washington going the final five
for the score.

Oakland (AP) — The Oak
land Raiders, proud owners of
two Super Bowl cham
pionships, suffered the embar
rassment of a second straight
shutout loss yesterday.
"Zero points just isn't going
to beat anybody," said Coach
Tom Flores after his team fell
17-0 to the Denver Broncos.
"The biggest thing is that
we're beating ourselves, and
we're going to have to come up
with some solutions for that,"
he added, referring to six Oak
land turnovers.
Denver, in beating the Raid
ers for the second time this sea
son, remained tied for first
place in the American Football
Conference West race.
"I told the players we'd have
to take the Raiders out physi
cally to win this one, and they
did an excellent job, did just
that," said Dan Reeves, the
Broncos' rookie head coach.
Safety Steve Foley killed
Oakland's only serious touch
down threat with a fumble re
covery, and the Raiders had
only 168 yards on offense. Jim
Plunkett was sacked three

times and intercepted once.
The Broncos, who had killed
Baltimore and San Diego with
big passing plays the two pre
vious Sundays, changed up on
the Raiders and used a two
tight end offense which
stressed the run.
"It takes a lot of people to
run the ball that well. Ev
erybody should be praised,"
said Craig Morton, who threw
only 16 times in the victory and
settled for 117 yards passing.
Plunkett completed 7 of 9
passes in the first half but, be
cause of good coverage and
strong pressure from the Den
ver pass rush, threw mostly to
running backs King and Der
rick Jensen.
The Raiders moved into
Denver territory after receiving
the kickoff at the start of the
second half, but King fumbled
on a running play when tackled
by Rulon Jones, and Barney
Chavous recovered for the
Broncos. The next Oakland
possession ended when strong
safety Billy Thompson in
tercepted Plunkett.

Washington (AP) — Safety
Dwight Hicks recovered a
fumble and returned it 80 yards
for one score and intercepted a
pass and returned it 32 yards for
a second yesterday to lead the
San Francisco 49ers to a con
vincing 30-17 National Football
League victory over the winless
Washington Redskins.
The victory upped the 49er
record to 3-2 while dropping
the Redskins to 0-5 under new
head coach Joe Gibbs, the
team's worst start in 17 years.
Hicks picked a Redskin
fumble out of midair five
minutes into the game and
raced 80 yards down the side
line to give the 49ers an early
14-0 lead.
In the third quarter, with the
49ers ahead 24-3, Hicks picked
off a Joe Theismann pass and
rambled 72 yards before being
broughtdown onthe Washing
ton 22.

After the Redskins got the
ball right back on an intercep
tion of their own, Hicks went
back to work, intercepting
Theismann's first pass and re
turning it 32 yards for a 30-3 San
Francisco lead.
Hicks' first touchdown
marked the longest touch
down on a fumble recovery in
49er history and the first time
the 49ers had returned a
fumble for a score in five years.
The Redskin fans got a
chance to cheer in the fourth
quarter when Mike Nelms,
who earlier in the day returned
a kick 55 yards, ran a Jim Miller
punt back 58 yards for a touch
down to close the gap to 30-10
with 10:33 remaining.
The Redskins, on offense
again after recovering a
fumble, moved 30 yards in
eight plays with halfback Joe
Washington going the final five
for the score.

Oakland (AP) — The Oak
land Raiders, proud owners of
two Super Bowl cham
pionships, suffered the embar
rassment of a second straight
shutout loss yesterday.
"Zero points just isn't going
to beat anybody," said Coach
Tom Flores after his team fell
17-0 to the Denver Broncos.
"The biggest thing is that
we're beating ourselves, and
we're going to have to come up
with some solutions for that,"
he added, referring to six Oak
land turnovers.
Denver, in beating the Raid
ers for the second time this sea
son, remained tied for first
place in the American Football
Conference West race.
"I told the players we'd have
to take the Raiders out physi
cally to win this one, and they
did an excellent job, did just
that," said Dan Reeves, the
Broncos' rookie head coach.
Safety Steve Foley killed
Oakland's only serious touch
down threat with a fumble re
covery, and the Raiders had
only 168 yards on offense. Jim
Plunkett was sacked three

times and intercepted once.
The Broncos, who had killed
Baltimore and San Diego with
big passing plays the two pre
vious Sundays, changed up on
the Raiders and used a two
tight end offense which
stressed the run.
"It takes a lot of people to
run the ball that well. Ev
erybody should be praised,"
said Craig Morton, who threw
only 16 times in the victory and
settled for 117 yards passing.
Plunkett completed 7 of 9
passes in the first half but, be
cause of good coverage and
strong pressure from the Den
ver pass rush, threw mostly to
running backs King and Der
rick Jensen.
The Raiders moved into
Denver territory after receiving
the kickoff at the start of the
second half, but King fumbled
on a running play when tackled
by Rulon Jones, and Barney
Chavous recovered for the
Broncos. The next Oakland
possession ended when strong
safety Billy Thompson in
tercepted Plunkett.
