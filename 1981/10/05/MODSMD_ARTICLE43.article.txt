# Manager and coaches axed
## Mets fire Torre and staff 
### 
New York (AP) â€” New
York Mets Manager Joe
Torre and his entire
coaching staff were fired
yesterday, General Man
ager Frank Cashen an
nounced.
Torre, who became the
seventh manager to fall un
der the ax this season, was
advised yesterday morning
of the Mets' decision,
Cashen said.
Cashen said he had made
no decision about Torre's
replacement other than he
wanted to name a re
placement before baseball's
winter meetings in early De
cember.
"We decided to go in an
other direction next year,"
Cashen said. "I have no re
placement in mind, and I
will talk to more than one
candidate."
Cashen said the Mets
would hold an organiza
tional meeting next week,
then attend the league
championship series and
the World Series, during
which time he would speak
with the candidates.
Cashen said he gaveTorre
the option of deciding
whether he would manage

the Mets' last game of the
season yesterday.
"I knew he would want to
be on the bench for the last
game. That's the kind of guy
he is," Cashen said. "To say
he took it like a pro would
be an understatement. I
have a great deal of admira
tion for Joe, and I'm sure we
will remain close friends."
While Cashen declined to
speculate on Torre's suc
cessor, speculation cen
tered on Jim Frey, deposed
this season as Kansas City
manager, and Dick Wil
liams, who managed the
Montreal Expos earlier this
year.
Cashen said the new man
ager would not come out of
the Mets' farm system. "I
want somebody with ex
perience," Cashen said. "I
want to win. I really desper
ately want to win. I want a
manager who can help me
win."
Cashen said he began to
think of a managerial
chance during the strike in
mid-season, "but I really
made up my mind about 10
days ago."
Torre said he was told of

the decision yesterday
morning by Cashen, but he
said he had known for quite
some time that his job was in
jeopardy.
"Frank said to me this
morning that it was never an
easy job to fire someone. I
said, 'Don't worry about it,"'
Torre said. "I've had to fire
people before. I knew it
would happen."
Torre said that he did not
ask Cashen for a specific
reason for his firing.
"We talked a lot. I've had
some differences on Frank
with managing. I said to him
if he wants to be boss, I
don't need any reason other
than he wants to make a
change," Torre said.
Torre's current contract
with the Mets runs through
1982 and the Mets will hon
or it.
Asked about his plans,
Torre said: "I want to man
age, sure. I want to go to a
team that wins a pennant."
Fired along with Torre
were Joe Pignatano, a 14-
year veteran with the Mets,
Rube Walker, Bob Gibson,
Deron Johnson and Chuck
Cottier.
