Weinberger, Tower differ on SALT
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that the Reagan administration's plan to mod
ernize the United States' strategic nuclear forces will
strengthen this country's hand in arms control talks with the
Soviet Union.
Weinberger said that the modernization plan, which in
cludes deployment of 100 new MX missiles in existing silos
and production of 100 new supersonic B-1 bombers, im
proves President Ronald Reagan's chances of achieving the
kind of arms reduction he desires when the talks take place.
"It enables us to enter those discussions from a far stronger
point of view and from a far stronger position, which can
enable us to get a far better result," Weinberger said on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
Reagan believes that the strategic arms limitation talks car
ried on by his predecessors in the White House failed to
achieve "a real reduction, an effective verifiable reduction"
in nuclear arsenals, Weinberger said.
Meanwhile, Sen. John Tower, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee and the long-acknowledged
chief spokesman and the leading Senate Republican on de
fense issues, said yesterday that an even stronger bargaining
position would have beer, achieved by shuttling the MX mis
siles among shelters, as originally planned, instead of deploy
ing them in silos hardened to withstand nuclear attack.
And former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown said that
the Reagan administration seems to be afraid to negotiate
with the Soviet Union because of fears that "if you negotiate
with the Soviets, somehow the Soviets are going to come out
ahead."
Tower, interviewed on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said,
"The president said a few weeks ago that if the Soviets will
not agree to arms reduction, we would join them in an arms
race and we will beat them. I think the proposal to put these
MX missiles in existing holes" is contrary to the position the
president had already taken.
While acknowleding that most of the modernization plan,
which must be sent to Congress for authorization and financ
ing, will probably win approval on Capitol Hill, Tower said
that the president was "ill served" by his advisers on the de
cision to deply the MX missiles in existing Titan and Minute
man silos.
"I think the administration should have opted for say, at
least 100 missiles in 1000 holes," he said. "There is a great deal
of gloorr in the Pentagon over this decision, because it is not
regarded as the most survivable mode that would give us the
biggest capability of deterring a Soviet threat."
Brown, appearing on ABC-TV's "Issues and Answers" said
that the Reagan administration's decision not to put nego
tiations in the forefront of their strategy is a mistake. "Arms
control negotiations are not a trap," he said. "Neither are
they a panacea or a substitute for military strength."
Polish inflation to test Solidarity
Gdansk, Poland — Solidarity chief Lech Walesa demanded
yesterday that the government cancel food and cigarette
price hikes set to go into effect today.
"I protest against the increase in prices of cigarettes, fish
and manufactured fruit products," Walesa said in a telegram
to Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski. "I demand to stop realiza
tion of these price increases."
The Polish news agency PAP said Jaruzelski was sending Fi
nance Minister Marian Krzak to Gdansk "for talks with Soli
darity."
Delegates at the independent labor federation's national
congress here exploded in anger Saturday night when they
heard of the price hikes. Some unionists threatened to call
for strikes to protest the move that will double the cost of
cigarettes to 40 cents a pack.
"A man can't work an hour to buy a pack of cigarettes," an
outraged delegate said.
Walesa's protest said the government announced the in
crease without consulting the 9.5 million-member union,
despite reports in the state-run press that "trade unions" had
been consulted.
One delegate suggested in debate that the timing of the
government's announcement was no accident, calling it a
"provocation."
The price increases for tobacco, carp, trout and canned
and processed fruit are part of the government's plan to
bring prices in line with production costs, curb demand and
sop up an estimated $17 billion currency surplus resulting
from higher wages and a lack of goods to spend it on.
Solidarity's convention on Saturday adopted a resolution
basically accepting a new law giving workers a say in naming
factory managers. But delegates called for a referendum in
Polish factories on some points.
Union officials said the resolution was a compromise,
since it does not reject the new law outright but does in
dicate dissatisfaction over the amount of say workers will
have in naming their bosses.
The law passed Sept. 25 had sparked fierce debate among
the delegates earlier when some objected to the fact that
union leaders had reached agreement with the government
without consulting the congress.

Saturday's resolution states that Solidarity's national lead
ership is to present a plan for the referendum to the Polish
Parliament along with suggested amendments to the new
law.
Israel shuffles Palestinian government
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment adopted a plan yesterday for altering Israel's 14-year
military rule of occupied Arab territories by bringing in civil
ians and eventually Palestinians.
Cabinet Secretary Arieh Naor described the move to re
organize rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a "con
fidence-building measure," apparently to encourage
Palestinians to join U.S.-mediated negotiations between
Egypt and Israel for autonomy in the occupied areas.
The plan is an administrative matter that does not need leg
islative approval.
Although few details of the plan were disclosed, Naor said
that beginning Dec. 1, Israeli civilians will handle such func
tions as education, health and agricultural development.
Later, Palestinians will assume senior positions in man
aging these affairs, he said.
"It is not correct to say that civilians will replace the mili
tary government," Naor said. "It is possible to transfer cer
tain functions that officers now perform to civilian hands."
If the civilians were not under military authority, Naor said,
"the implications would be very far-reaching."
The nationalist Palestinian leadership in the West Bank
condemned the plan.
Zafer ai-Masri, deputy mayor of Nablus, said in a tele
phone interview, "it doesn't matter if the occupier is in uni
form or a suit. He is still on my land."
Sponsored by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the plan is
the first reorganization Israel has carried out in its military
government since it captured the territories in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
Army officers have been in complete charge of military
and civilian affairs, although elected Arab mayors run urban
affairs at the municipal level.
The Arab mayors, elected in 1976 in a wave of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, flatly refuse to partici
pate in negotiations for autonomy, calling it another guise of
occupation.
They demand full independence and say only the PLO has
the authority to negotiate for the Palestinians.
Lately, Israeli occupation authorities have sought to un
dercut the mayors by banning pro-PLO statements and the
influx of PLO funds into the West Bank.
But at the same time, they are providing area villages with
financial aid and development of electricity, roads and run
ning water — calculating that the rural population which
makes up 70 percent of the West Bank's 750,000 Arabs will
carry decisive weight in the elections envisaged in the auton
omy plan.
Irish prison reform promised
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Britain's top official in
Northern Ireland pledged yesterday to implement prison re
forms for all inmates now that jailed Irish nationalists have
ended their hunger strike.
The violence-torn province was reported quiet. But police
reinforcements were on the streets of Londonderry, Ulster's
second largest city, where marches by the mostly Catholic
supporters of the hunger strike and a counter-demonstra
tion by followers of hard-line Protestant leader Rev. Lan
Paisley were scheduled.
"There are certain reforms which can be introduced. We
will now try to see what we can do about them," Northern
Ireland Secretary James Prior told reporters at Norwich, Eng
land, before departing early yesterday for Belfast.
Ten Irish nationalists, mostly members of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, starved themselves to death at Bel
fast's Maze prison during the seven-month protest that
ended Saturday when the six remaining strikers ended their
fasts.
The prisoners were demanding five prison reforms that
the British government refused to grant on grounds that it
would legitimize the IRA's bloody campaign to oust the Brit
ish from the mainly Protestant province and unite it with the
Irish Republic to the south.
However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held out the
possibility that some reforms would be initiated once the
hunger strike ended.
Prior's remarks yesterday made it clear that Britain will not
treat guerrillas from the mainly Catholic IRA and its allied
Irish National Liberation Army differently from jailed Protes
tant guerrillas. Nearly one-third of the 1500 people jailed for
terrorist offenses in the province belong to Protestant para
military organizations.
"We'll be looking at a policy of reform which will apply to
all prisoners," Prior said. "It's important to get it right... I'll
be moving this week — but not today."
He did not elaborate on what reforms were being con
sidered.
Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, stepped up attacks
on the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and pledged that

"the struggle against the British government will not end."
Announcing an end to the seven-month-old fast on Satur
day, Sinn Fein said the Catholic Church had "robbed" na
tionalists of their propaganda weapon against the British by
convincing families of the hunger strikers to order medical
intervention.
"The prisoners will continue their struggle inside the pris
on and they will use whatever tactics they see fit," Aiden
MacAlteer, a spokesman for Sinn Fein said in a radio in
terview.
The prisoners' demands were for the right to associate
freely, wear their own clothes at all times, do no compulsory
prison work, have 50 percent reductions in their sentences
for good behavior and be allowed to receive more mail and
visits.
Minority education called inferior
Washington— The Reagan administration plans to sue
school boards across the country contending that inferior
education is being provided in some predominantly black
and other minority schools, the Department of Justice's civil
rights chief said.
William Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a recent interview that "several situations" of
such unequal education are under investigation, but he de
clined to say where or when the first suits would be filed.
"These are matters under investigation, and I can't begin
to send off those kinds of signals or every school board in the
country is going to start calling me and asking about it," Rey
nolds said. The first suit is at least several weeks away from
being filed, he said.
The new legal attack, which will be based on the Constitu
tion's Equal Protection Clause, is in line with the adminis
tration's move away from busing or student relocation and
toward civil rights enforcement seeking to enhance the
educational quality of minority schools.
Reynolds said he did not yet have enough information to
gauge how widespread is the problem of educational dis
parity in predominantly black and other minority schools. "I
don't think it's a minor problem or an isolated one. I do think
it exists in a number of places in the country" he said.
Reynolds acknowledged that the new suits are likely to pit
the federal government against so-called de facto segrega
tion — that resulting from neighborhood housing patterns
rather than any action by state authorities. The government
has concentrated on eliminating so-called de jure segrega
tion — that resulting from state or local action.
"While there is this education disparity that exists in many
situations," Reynolds said, "the only time that the courts sug
gest we should begin to address it is if it's de jure segregation
kind of case. If it's de facto, the result of natural neighbor
hood school developments, somehow the courts seem to
suggest that we don't have to look at educational disparity.
Commonwealth nations urge change
Melbourne, Australia — Representatives of 41 British
Commonwealth nations yesterday called on the rest of the
world to support urgent new talks between rich and poor
countries to deal with worsening global economic dis
parities.
The appeal came in a joint declaration by leaders of the
Commonwealth, which groups Britain and its former co
lonies. Issued in the Australian capital of Canberra during
the leaders' weekend retreat, the document, allied the
"Melbourne Declaration," asked for "real and significant
changes commensurate with the urgency of the problems
we now face."
The declaration mentioned no specific measures, how
ever, and a controversy erupted when one Commonwealth
leader, New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, called
it a "declaration of platitudes."
Commonwealth officials said the document was a "politi
cal statement" and that specific economic issues such as
food, finance, trade and energy would be addressed in the
final communique of the Commonwealth conference this
week.
In a separate statement, Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser made it clear that the declaration was in
tended to give impetus to this month's North-South summit
at Cancun, Mexico. That meeting, to be attended by 22 world
leaders including President Ronald Reagan, has been called
to discuss economic issues dividing rich and poor nations.
In the Melbourne Declaration, the Commonwealth lead
ers said it was "imperative to revitalize the dialogue between
developed and developing countries." It said the world's
"gross inequality of wealth and opportunity" and an "un
broken circle of poverty" in developing countries con
stituted "fundamental sources of tension and instability in
the world."

Cabinet Secretary Arieh Naor described the move to re
organize rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a "con
fidence-building measure," apparently to encourage
Palestinians to join U.S.-mediated negotiations between
Egypt and Israel for autonomy in the occupied areas.
The plan is an administrative matter that does not need leg
islative approval.
Although few details of the plan were disclosed, Naor said
that beginning Dec. 1, Israeli civilians will handle such func
tions as education, health and agricultural development.
Later, Palestinians will assume senior positions in man
aging these affairs, he said.
"It is not correct to say that civilians will replace the mili
tary government," Naor said. "It is possible to transfer cer
tain functions that officers now perform to civilian hands."
If the civilians were not under military authority, Naor said,
"the implications would be very far-reaching."
The nationalist Palestinian leadership in the West Bank
condemned the plan.
Zafer ai-Masri, deputy mayor of Nablus, said in a tele
phone interview, "it doesn't matter if the occupier is in uni
form or a suit. He is still on my land."
Sponsored by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the plan is
the first reorganization Israel has carried out in its military
government since it captured the territories in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
Army officers have been in complete charge of military
and civilian affairs, although elected Arab mayors run urban
affairs at the municipal level.
The Arab mayors, elected in 1976 in a wave of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, flatly refuse to partici
pate in negotiations for autonomy, calling it another guise of
occupation.
They demand full independence and say only the PLO has
the authority to negotiate for the Palestinians.
Lately, Israeli occupation authorities have sought to un
dercut the mayors by banning pro-PLO statements and the
influx of PLO funds into the West Bank.
But at the same time, they are providing area villages with
financial aid and development of electricity, roads and run
ning water — calculating that the rural population which
makes up 70 percent of the West Bank's 750,000 Arabs will
carry decisive weight in the elections envisaged in the auton
omy plan.
Irish prison reform promised
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Britain's top official in
Northern Ireland pledged yesterday to implement prison re
forms for all inmates now that jailed Irish nationalists have
ended their hunger strike.
The violence-torn province was reported quiet. But police
reinforcements were on the streets of Londonderry, Ulster's
second largest city, where marches by the mostly Catholic
supporters of the hunger strike and a counter-demonstra
tion by followers of hard-line Protestant leader Rev. Lan
Paisley were scheduled.
"There are certain reforms which can be introduced. We
will now try to see what we can do about them," Northern
Ireland Secretary James Prior told reporters at Norwich, Eng
land, before departing early yesterday for Belfast.
Ten Irish nationalists, mostly members of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, starved themselves to death at Bel
fast's Maze prison during the seven-month protest that
ended Saturday when the six remaining strikers ended their
fasts.
The prisoners were demanding five prison reforms that
the British government refused to grant on grounds that it
would legitimize the IRA's bloody campaign to oust the Brit
ish from the mainly Protestant province and unite it with the
Irish Republic to the south.
However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held out the
possibility that some reforms would be initiated once the
hunger strike ended.
Prior's remarks yesterday made it clear that Britain will not
treat guerrillas from the mainly Catholic IRA and its allied
Irish National Liberation Army differently from jailed Protes
tant guerrillas. Nearly one-third of the 1500 people jailed for
terrorist offenses in the province belong to Protestant para
military organizations.
"We'll be looking at a policy of reform which will apply to
all prisoners," Prior said. "It's important to get it right... I'll
be moving this week — but not today."
He did not elaborate on what reforms were being con
sidered.
Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, stepped up attacks
on the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and pledged that

"the struggle against the British government will not end."
Announcing an end to the seven-month-old fast on Satur
day, Sinn Fein said the Catholic Church had "robbed" na
tionalists of their propaganda weapon against the British by
convincing families of the hunger strikers to order medical
intervention.
"The prisoners will continue their struggle inside the pris
on and they will use whatever tactics they see fit," Aiden
MacAlteer, a spokesman for Sinn Fein said in a radio in
terview.
The prisoners' demands were for the right to associate
freely, wear their own clothes at all times, do no compulsory
prison work, have 50 percent reductions in their sentences
for good behavior and be allowed to receive more mail and
visits.
Minority education called inferior
Washington— The Reagan administration plans to sue
school boards across the country contending that inferior
education is being provided in some predominantly black
and other minority schools, the Department of Justice's civil
rights chief said.
William Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a recent interview that "several situations" of
such unequal education are under investigation, but he de
clined to say where or when the first suits would be filed.
"These are matters under investigation, and I can't begin
to send off those kinds of signals or every school board in the
country is going to start calling me and asking about it," Rey
nolds said. The first suit is at least several weeks away from
being filed, he said.
The new legal attack, which will be based on the Constitu
tion's Equal Protection Clause, is in line with the adminis
tration's move away from busing or student relocation and
toward civil rights enforcement seeking to enhance the
educational quality of minority schools.
Reynolds said he did not yet have enough information to
gauge how widespread is the problem of educational dis
parity in predominantly black and other minority schools. "I
don't think it's a minor problem or an isolated one. I do think
it exists in a number of places in the country" he said.
Reynolds acknowledged that the new suits are likely to pit
the federal government against so-called de facto segrega
tion — that resulting from neighborhood housing patterns
rather than any action by state authorities. The government
has concentrated on eliminating so-called de jure segrega
tion — that resulting from state or local action.
"While there is this education disparity that exists in many
situations," Reynolds said, "the only time that the courts sug
gest we should begin to address it is if it's de jure segregation
kind of case. If it's de facto, the result of natural neighbor
hood school developments, somehow the courts seem to
suggest that we don't have to look at educational disparity.
Commonwealth nations urge change
Melbourne, Australia — Representatives of 41 British
Commonwealth nations yesterday called on the rest of the
world to support urgent new talks between rich and poor
countries to deal with worsening global economic dis
parities.
The appeal came in a joint declaration by leaders of the
Commonwealth, which groups Britain and its former co
lonies. Issued in the Australian capital of Canberra during
the leaders' weekend retreat, the document, allied the
"Melbourne Declaration," asked for "real and significant
changes commensurate with the urgency of the problems
we now face."
The declaration mentioned no specific measures, how
ever, and a controversy erupted when one Commonwealth
leader, New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, called
it a "declaration of platitudes."
Commonwealth officials said the document was a "politi
cal statement" and that specific economic issues such as
food, finance, trade and energy would be addressed in the
final communique of the Commonwealth conference this
week.
In a separate statement, Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser made it clear that the declaration was in
tended to give impetus to this month's North-South summit
at Cancun, Mexico. That meeting, to be attended by 22 world
leaders including President Ronald Reagan, has been called
to discuss economic issues dividing rich and poor nations.
In the Melbourne Declaration, the Commonwealth lead
ers said it was "imperative to revitalize the dialogue between
developed and developing countries." It said the world's
"gross inequality of wealth and opportunity" and an "un
broken circle of poverty" in developing countries con
stituted "fundamental sources of tension and instability in
the world."
Today's weather

mid 80s tomorrow. Northwest winds to 15 mph afternoons.

Weinberger, Tower differ on SALT
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that the Reagan administration's plan to mod
ernize the United States' strategic nuclear forces will
strengthen this country's hand in arms control talks with the
Soviet Union.
Weinberger said that the modernization plan, which in
cludes deployment of 100 new MX missiles in existing silos
and production of 100 new supersonic B-1 bombers, im
proves President Ronald Reagan's chances of achieving the
kind of arms reduction he desires when the talks take place.
"It enables us to enter those discussions from a far stronger
point of view and from a far stronger position, which can
enable us to get a far better result," Weinberger said on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
Reagan believes that the strategic arms limitation talks car
ried on by his predecessors in the White House failed to
achieve "a real reduction, an effective verifiable reduction"
in nuclear arsenals, Weinberger said.
Meanwhile, Sen. John Tower, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee and the long-acknowledged
chief spokesman and the leading Senate Republican on de
fense issues, said yesterday that an even stronger bargaining
position would have beer, achieved by shuttling the MX mis
siles among shelters, as originally planned, instead of deploy
ing them in silos hardened to withstand nuclear attack.
And former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown said that
the Reagan administration seems to be afraid to negotiate
with the Soviet Union because of fears that "if you negotiate
with the Soviets, somehow the Soviets are going to come out
ahead."
Tower, interviewed on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said,
"The president said a few weeks ago that if the Soviets will
not agree to arms reduction, we would join them in an arms
race and we will beat them. I think the proposal to put these
MX missiles in existing holes" is contrary to the position the
president had already taken.
While acknowleding that most of the modernization plan,
which must be sent to Congress for authorization and financ
ing, will probably win approval on Capitol Hill, Tower said
that the president was "ill served" by his advisers on the de
cision to deply the MX missiles in existing Titan and Minute
man silos.
"I think the administration should have opted for say, at
least 100 missiles in 1000 holes," he said. "There is a great deal
of gloorr in the Pentagon over this decision, because it is not
regarded as the most survivable mode that would give us the
biggest capability of deterring a Soviet threat."
Brown, appearing on ABC-TV's "Issues and Answers" said
that the Reagan administration's decision not to put nego
tiations in the forefront of their strategy is a mistake. "Arms
control negotiations are not a trap," he said. "Neither are
they a panacea or a substitute for military strength."
Polish inflation to test Solidarity
Gdansk, Poland — Solidarity chief Lech Walesa demanded
yesterday that the government cancel food and cigarette
price hikes set to go into effect today.
"I protest against the increase in prices of cigarettes, fish
and manufactured fruit products," Walesa said in a telegram
to Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski. "I demand to stop realiza
tion of these price increases."
The Polish news agency PAP said Jaruzelski was sending Fi
nance Minister Marian Krzak to Gdansk "for talks with Soli
darity."
Delegates at the independent labor federation's national
congress here exploded in anger Saturday night when they
heard of the price hikes. Some unionists threatened to call
for strikes to protest the move that will double the cost of
cigarettes to 40 cents a pack.
"A man can't work an hour to buy a pack of cigarettes," an
outraged delegate said.
Walesa's protest said the government announced the in
crease without consulting the 9.5 million-member union,
despite reports in the state-run press that "trade unions" had
been consulted.
One delegate suggested in debate that the timing of the
government's announcement was no accident, calling it a
"provocation."
The price increases for tobacco, carp, trout and canned
and processed fruit are part of the government's plan to
bring prices in line with production costs, curb demand and
sop up an estimated $17 billion currency surplus resulting
from higher wages and a lack of goods to spend it on.
Solidarity's convention on Saturday adopted a resolution
basically accepting a new law giving workers a say in naming
factory managers. But delegates called for a referendum in
Polish factories on some points.
Union officials said the resolution was a compromise,
since it does not reject the new law outright but does in
dicate dissatisfaction over the amount of say workers will
have in naming their bosses.
The law passed Sept. 25 had sparked fierce debate among
the delegates earlier when some objected to the fact that
union leaders had reached agreement with the government
without consulting the congress.

Saturday's resolution states that Solidarity's national lead
ership is to present a plan for the referendum to the Polish
Parliament along with suggested amendments to the new
law.
Israel shuffles Palestinian government
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment adopted a plan yesterday for altering Israel's 14-year
military rule of occupied Arab territories by bringing in civil
ians and eventually Palestinians.
Cabinet Secretary Arieh Naor described the move to re

"These are matters under investigation, and I can't begin
to send off those kinds of signals or every school board in the
country is going to start calling me and asking about it," Rey
nolds said. The first suit is at least several weeks away from
being filed, he said.
The new legal attack, which will be based on the Constitu
tion's Equal Protection Clause, is in line with the adminis
tration's move away from busing or student relocation and
toward civil rights enforcement seeking to enhance the
educational quality of minority schools.
Reynolds said he did not yet have enough information to
gauge how widespread is the problem of educational dis
parity in predominantly black and other minority schools. "I
don't think it's a minor problem or an isolated one. I do think
it exists in a number of places in the country" he said.
Reynolds acknowledged that the new suits are likely to pit
the federal government against so-called de facto segrega
tion — that resulting from neighborhood housing patterns
rather than any action by state authorities. The government
has concentrated on eliminating so-called de jure segrega
tion — that resulting from state or local action.
"While there is this education disparity that exists in many
situations," Reynolds said, "the only time that the courts sug
gest we should begin to address it is if it's de jure segregation
kind of case. If it's de facto, the result of natural neighbor
hood school developments, somehow the courts seem to
suggest that we don't have to look at educational disparity.
Commonwealth nations urge change
Melbourne, Australia — Representatives of 41 British
Commonwealth nations yesterday called on the rest of the
world to support urgent new talks between rich and poor
countries to deal with worsening global economic dis
parities.
The appeal came in a joint declaration by leaders of the
Commonwealth, which groups Britain and its former co
lonies. Issued in the Australian capital of Canberra during
the leaders' weekend retreat, the document, allied the
"Melbourne Declaration," asked for "real and significant
changes commensurate with the urgency of the problems
we now face."
The declaration mentioned no specific measures, how
ever, and a controversy erupted when one Commonwealth
leader, New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, called
it a "declaration of platitudes."
Commonwealth officials said the document was a "politi
cal statement" and that specific economic issues such as
food, finance, trade and energy would be addressed in the
final communique of the Commonwealth conference this
week.
In a separate statement, Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser made it clear that the declaration was in
tended to give impetus to this month's North-South summit
at Cancun, Mexico. That meeting, to be attended by 22 world
leaders including President Ronald Reagan, has been called
to discuss economic issues dividing rich and poor nations.
In the Melbourne Declaration, the Commonwealth lead
ers said it was "imperative to revitalize the dialogue between
developed and developing countries." It said the world's
"gross inequality of wealth and opportunity" and an "un
broken circle of poverty" in developing countries con
stituted "fundamental sources of tension and instability in
the world."

Weinberger, Tower differ on SALT
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that the Reagan administration's plan to mod
ernize the United States' strategic nuclear forces will
strengthen this country's hand in arms control talks with the
Soviet Union.
Weinberger said that the modernization plan, which in
cludes deployment of 100 new MX missiles in existing silos
and production of 100 new supersonic B-1 bombers, im
proves President Ronald Reagan's chances of achieving the
kind of arms reduction he desires when the talks take place.
"It enables us to enter those discussions from a far stronger
point of view and from a far stronger position, which can
enable us to get a far better result," Weinberger said on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
Reagan believes that the strategic arms limitation talks car
ried on by his predecessors in the White House failed to
achieve "a real reduction, an effective verifiable reduction"
in nuclear arsenals, Weinberger said.
Meanwhile, Sen. John Tower, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee and the long-acknowledged
chief spokesman and the leading Senate Republican on de
fense issues, said yesterday that an even stronger bargaining
position would have beer, achieved by shuttling the MX mis
siles among shelters, as originally planned, instead of deploy
ing them in silos hardened to withstand nuclear attack.
And former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown said that
the Reagan administration seems to be afraid to negotiate
with the Soviet Union because of fears that "if you negotiate
with the Soviets, somehow the Soviets are going to come out
ahead."
Tower, interviewed on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said,
"The president said a few weeks ago that if the Soviets will
not agree to arms reduction, we would join them in an arms
race and we will beat them. I think the proposal to put these
MX missiles in existing holes" is contrary to the position the
president had already taken.
While acknowleding that most of the modernization plan,
which must be sent to Congress for authorization and financ
ing, will probably win approval on Capitol Hill, Tower said
that the president was "ill served" by his advisers on the de
cision to deply the MX missiles in existing Titan and Minute
man silos.
"I think the administration should have opted for say, at
least 100 missiles in 1000 holes," he said. "There is a great deal
of gloorr in the Pentagon over this decision, because it is not
regarded as the most survivable mode that would give us the
biggest capability of deterring a Soviet threat."
Brown, appearing on ABC-TV's "Issues and Answers" said
that the Reagan administration's decision not to put nego
tiations in the forefront of their strategy is a mistake. "Arms
control negotiations are not a trap," he said. "Neither are
they a panacea or a substitute for military strength."
Polish inflation to test Solidarity
Gdansk, Poland — Solidarity chief Lech Walesa demanded
yesterday that the government cancel food and cigarette
price hikes set to go into effect today.
"I protest against the increase in prices of cigarettes, fish
and manufactured fruit products," Walesa said in a telegram
to Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski. "I demand to stop realiza
tion of these price increases."
The Polish news agency PAP said Jaruzelski was sending Fi
nance Minister Marian Krzak to Gdansk "for talks with Soli
darity."
Delegates at the independent labor federation's national
congress here exploded in anger Saturday night when they
heard of the price hikes. Some unionists threatened to call
for strikes to protest the move that will double the cost of
cigarettes to 40 cents a pack.
"A man can't work an hour to buy a pack of cigarettes," an
outraged delegate said.
Walesa's protest said the government announced the in
crease without consulting the 9.5 million-member union,
despite reports in the state-run press that "trade unions" had
been consulted.
One delegate suggested in debate that the timing of the
government's announcement was no accident, calling it a
"provocation."
The price increases for tobacco, carp, trout and canned
and processed fruit are part of the government's plan to
bring prices in line with production costs, curb demand and
sop up an estimated $17 billion currency surplus resulting
from higher wages and a lack of goods to spend it on.
Solidarity's convention on Saturday adopted a resolution
basically accepting a new law giving workers a say in naming
factory managers. But delegates called for a referendum in
Polish factories on some points.
Union officials said the resolution was a compromise,
since it does not reject the new law outright but does in
dicate dissatisfaction over the amount of say workers will
have in naming their bosses.
The law passed Sept. 25 had sparked fierce debate among
the delegates earlier when some objected to the fact that
union leaders had reached agreement with the government
without consulting the congress.

Saturday's resolution states that Solidarity's national lead
ership is to present a plan for the referendum to the Polish
Parliament along with suggested amendments to the new
law.
Israel shuffles Palestinian government
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment adopted a plan yesterday for altering Israel's 14-year
military rule of occupied Arab territories by bringing in civil
ians and eventually Palestinians.
Cabinet Secretary Arieh Naor described the move to re
organize rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a "con
fidence-building measure," apparently to encourage
Palestinians to join U.S.-mediated negotiations between
Egypt and Israel for autonomy in the occupied areas.
The plan is an administrative matter that does not need leg
islative approval.
Although few details of the plan were disclosed, Naor said
that beginning Dec. 1, Israeli civilians will handle such func
tions as education, health and agricultural development.
Later, Palestinians will assume senior positions in man
aging these affairs, he said.
"It is not correct to say that civilians will replace the mili
tary government," Naor said. "It is possible to transfer cer
tain functions that officers now perform to civilian hands."
If the civilians were not under military authority, Naor said,
"the implications would be very far-reaching."
The nationalist Palestinian leadership in the West Bank
condemned the plan.
Zafer ai-Masri, deputy mayor of Nablus, said in a tele
phone interview, "it doesn't matter if the occupier is in uni
form or a suit. He is still on my land."
Sponsored by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the plan is
the first reorganization Israel has carried out in its military
government since it captured the territories in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
Army officers have been in complete charge of military
and civilian affairs, although elected Arab mayors run urban
affairs at the municipal level.
The Arab mayors, elected in 1976 in a wave of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, flatly refuse to partici
pate in negotiations for autonomy, calling it another guise of
occupation.
They demand full independence and say only the PLO has
the authority to negotiate for the Palestinians.
Lately, Israeli occupation authorities have sought to un
dercut the mayors by banning pro-PLO statements and the
influx of PLO funds into the West Bank.
But at the same time, they are providing area villages with
financial aid and development of electricity, roads and run
ning water — calculating that the rural population which
makes up 70 percent of the West Bank's 750,000 Arabs will
carry decisive weight in the elections envisaged in the auton
omy plan.
Irish prison reform promised
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Britain's top official in
Northern Ireland pledged yesterday to implement prison re
forms for all inmates now that jailed Irish nationalists have
ended their hunger strike.
The violence-torn province was reported quiet. But police
reinforcements were on the streets of Londonderry, Ulster's
second largest city, where marches by the mostly Catholic
supporters of the hunger strike and a counter-demonstra
tion by followers of hard-line Protestant leader Rev. Lan
Paisley were scheduled.
"There are certain reforms which can be introduced. We
will now try to see what we can do about them," Northern
Ireland Secretary James Prior told reporters at Norwich, Eng
land, before departing early yesterday for Belfast.
Ten Irish nationalists, mostly members of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, starved themselves to death at Bel
fast's Maze prison during the seven-month protest that
ended Saturday when the six remaining strikers ended their
fasts.
The prisoners were demanding five prison reforms that
the British government refused to grant on grounds that it
would legitimize the IRA's bloody campaign to oust the Brit
ish from the mainly Protestant province and unite it with the
Irish Republic to the south.
However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held out the
possibility that some reforms would be initiated once the
hunger strike ended.
Prior's remarks yesterday made it clear that Britain will not
treat guerrillas from the mainly Catholic IRA and its allied
Irish National Liberation Army differently from jailed Protes
tant guerrillas. Nearly one-third of the 1500 people jailed for
terrorist offenses in the province belong to Protestant para
military organizations.
"We'll be looking at a policy of reform which will apply to
all prisoners," Prior said. "It's important to get it right... I'll
be moving this week — but not today."
He did not elaborate on what reforms were being con
sidered.
Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, stepped up attacks
on the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and pledged that

"the struggle against the British government will not end."
Announcing an end to the seven-month-old fast on Satur
day, Sinn Fein said the Catholic Church had "robbed" na
tionalists of their propaganda weapon against the British by
convincing families of the hunger strikers to order medical
intervention.
"The prisoners will continue their struggle inside the pris
on and they will use whatever tactics they see fit," Aiden
MacAlteer, a spokesman for Sinn Fein said in a radio in
terview.
The prisoners' demands were for the right to associate
freely, wear their own clothes at all times, do no compulsory
prison work, have 50 percent reductions in their sentences
for good behavior and be allowed to receive more mail and
visits.
Minority education called inferior
Washington— The Reagan administration plans to sue
school boards across the country contending that inferior
education is being provided in some predominantly black
and other minority schools, the Department of Justice's civil
rights chief said.
William Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a recent interview that "several situations" of
such unequal education are under investigation, but he de
clined to say where or when the first suits would be filed.
"These are matters under investigation, and I can't begin
to send off those kinds of signals or every school board in the
country is going to start calling me and asking about it," Rey

MX missiles in existing holes" is contrary to the position the
president had already taken.
While acknowleding that most of the modernization plan,
which must be sent to Congress for authorization and financ
ing, will probably win approval on Capitol Hill, Tower said
that the president was "ill served" by his advisers on the de
cision to deply the MX missiles in existing Titan and Minute
man silos.
"I think the administration should have opted for say, at
least 100 missiles in 1000 holes," he said. "There is a great deal
of gloorr in the Pentagon over this decision, because it is not
regarded as the most survivable mode that would give us the
biggest capability of deterring a Soviet threat."
Brown, appearing on ABC-TV's "Issues and Answers" said
that the Reagan administration's decision not to put nego
tiations in the forefront of their strategy is a mistake. "Arms
control negotiations are not a trap," he said. "Neither are
they a panacea or a substitute for military strength."
Polish inflation to test Solidarity
Gdansk, Poland — Solidarity chief Lech Walesa demanded
yesterday that the government cancel food and cigarette
price hikes set to go into effect today.
"I protest against the increase in prices of cigarettes, fish
and manufactured fruit products," Walesa said in a telegram
to Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski. "I demand to stop realiza
tion of these price increases."
The Polish news agency PAP said Jaruzelski was sending Fi
nance Minister Marian Krzak to Gdansk "for talks with Soli
darity."
Delegates at the independent labor federation's national
congress here exploded in anger Saturday night when they
heard of the price hikes. Some unionists threatened to call
for strikes to protest the move that will double the cost of
cigarettes to 40 cents a pack.
"A man can't work an hour to buy a pack of cigarettes," an
outraged delegate said.
Walesa's protest said the government announced the in
crease without consulting the 9.5 million-member union,
despite reports in the state-run press that "trade unions" had
been consulted.
One delegate suggested in debate that the timing of the
government's announcement was no accident, calling it a
"provocation."
The price increases for tobacco, carp, trout and canned
and processed fruit are part of the government's plan to
bring prices in line with production costs, curb demand and
sop up an estimated $17 billion currency surplus resulting
from higher wages and a lack of goods to spend it on.
Solidarity's convention on Saturday adopted a resolution
basically accepting a new law giving workers a say in naming
factory managers. But delegates called for a referendum in
Polish factories on some points.
Union officials said the resolution was a compromise,
since it does not reject the new law outright but does in
dicate dissatisfaction over the amount of say workers will
have in naming their bosses.
The law passed Sept. 25 had sparked fierce debate among
the delegates earlier when some objected to the fact that
union leaders had reached agreement with the government
without consulting the congress.

Saturday's resolution states that Solidarity's national lead
ership is to present a plan for the referendum to the Polish
Parliament along with suggested amendments to the new
law.
Israel shuffles Palestinian government
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment adopted a plan yesterday for altering Israel's 14-year
military rule of occupied Arab territories by bringing in civil
ians and eventually Palestinians.
Cabinet Secretary Arieh Naor described the move to re
organize rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a "con
fidence-building measure," apparently to encourage
Palestinians to join U.S.-mediated negotiations between
Egypt and Israel for autonomy in the occupied areas.
The plan is an administrative matter that does not need leg
islative approval.
Although few details of the plan were disclosed, Naor said
that beginning Dec. 1, Israeli civilians will handle such func
tions as education, health and agricultural development.
Later, Palestinians will assume senior positions in man
aging these affairs, he said.
"It is not correct to say that civilians will replace the mili
tary government," Naor said. "It is possible to transfer cer
tain functions that officers now perform to civilian hands."
If the civilians were not under military authority, Naor said,
"the implications would be very far-reaching."
The nationalist Palestinian leadership in the West Bank
condemned the plan.
Zafer ai-Masri, deputy mayor of Nablus, said in a tele
phone interview, "it doesn't matter if the occupier is in uni
form or a suit. He is still on my land."
Sponsored by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the plan is
the first reorganization Israel has carried out in its military
government since it captured the territories in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
Army officers have been in complete charge of military
and civilian affairs, although elected Arab mayors run urban
affairs at the municipal level.
The Arab mayors, elected in 1976 in a wave of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, flatly refuse to partici
pate in negotiations for autonomy, calling it another guise of
occupation.
They demand full independence and say only the PLO has
the authority to negotiate for the Palestinians.
Lately, Israeli occupation authorities have sought to un
dercut the mayors by banning pro-PLO statements and the
influx of PLO funds into the West Bank.
But at the same time, they are providing area villages with
financial aid and development of electricity, roads and run
ning water — calculating that the rural population which
makes up 70 percent of the West Bank's 750,000 Arabs will
carry decisive weight in the elections envisaged in the auton
omy plan.
Irish prison reform promised
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Britain's top official in
Northern Ireland pledged yesterday to implement prison re
forms for all inmates now that jailed Irish nationalists have
ended their hunger strike.
The violence-torn province was reported quiet. But police
reinforcements were on the streets of Londonderry, Ulster's
second largest city, where marches by the mostly Catholic
supporters of the hunger strike and a counter-demonstra
tion by followers of hard-line Protestant leader Rev. Lan
Paisley were scheduled.
"There are certain reforms which can be introduced. We
will now try to see what we can do about them," Northern
Ireland Secretary James Prior told reporters at Norwich, Eng
land, before departing early yesterday for Belfast.
Ten Irish nationalists, mostly members of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, starved themselves to death at Bel
fast's Maze prison during the seven-month protest that
ended Saturday when the six remaining strikers ended their
fasts.
The prisoners were demanding five prison reforms that
the British government refused to grant on grounds that it
would legitimize the IRA's bloody campaign to oust the Brit
ish from the mainly Protestant province and unite it with the
Irish Republic to the south.
However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held out the
possibility that some reforms would be initiated once the
hunger strike ended.
Prior's remarks yesterday made it clear that Britain will not
treat guerrillas from the mainly Catholic IRA and its allied
Irish National Liberation Army differently from jailed Protes
tant guerrillas. Nearly one-third of the 1500 people jailed for
terrorist offenses in the province belong to Protestant para
military organizations.
"We'll be looking at a policy of reform which will apply to
all prisoners," Prior said. "It's important to get it right... I'll
be moving this week — but not today."
He did not elaborate on what reforms were being con
sidered.
Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, stepped up attacks
on the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and pledged that

"the struggle against the British government will not end."
Announcing an end to the seven-month-old fast on Satur
day, Sinn Fein said the Catholic Church had "robbed" na
tionalists of their propaganda weapon against the British by
convincing families of the hunger strikers to order medical
intervention.
"The prisoners will continue their struggle inside the pris
on and they will use whatever tactics they see fit," Aiden
MacAlteer, a spokesman for Sinn Fein said in a radio in
terview.
The prisoners' demands were for the right to associate
freely, wear their own clothes at all times, do no compulsory
prison work, have 50 percent reductions in their sentences
for good behavior and be allowed to receive more mail and
visits.
Minority education called inferior
Washington— The Reagan administration plans to sue
school boards across the country contending that inferior
education is being provided in some predominantly black
and other minority schools, the Department of Justice's civil
rights chief said.
William Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a recent interview that "several situations" of
such unequal education are under investigation, but he de
clined to say where or when the first suits would be filed.
"These are matters under investigation, and I can't begin
to send off those kinds of signals or every school board in the
country is going to start calling me and asking about it," Rey
nolds said. The first suit is at least several weeks away from
being filed, he said.
The new legal attack, which will be based on the Constitu
tion's Equal Protection Clause, is in line with the adminis
tration's move away from busing or student relocation and
toward civil rights enforcement seeking to enhance the
educational quality of minority schools.
Reynolds said he did not yet have enough information to
gauge how widespread is the problem of educational dis
parity in predominantly black and other minority schools. "I
don't think it's a minor problem or an isolated one. I do think
it exists in a number of places in the country" he said.
Reynolds acknowledged that the new suits are likely to pit
the federal government against so-called de facto segrega
tion — that resulting from neighborhood housing patterns
rather than any action by state authorities. The government
has concentrated on eliminating so-called de jure segrega
tion — that resulting from state or local action.
"While there is this education disparity that exists in many
situations," Reynolds said, "the only time that the courts sug
gest we should begin to address it is if it's de jure segregation
kind of case. If it's de facto, the result of natural neighbor
hood school developments, somehow the courts seem to
suggest that we don't have to look at educational disparity.
Commonwealth nations urge change
Melbourne, Australia — Representatives of 41 British
Commonwealth nations yesterday called on the rest of the
world to support urgent new talks between rich and poor
countries to deal with worsening global economic dis
parities.
The appeal came in a joint declaration by leaders of the
Commonwealth, which groups Britain and its former co
lonies. Issued in the Australian capital of Canberra during
the leaders' weekend retreat, the document, allied the
"Melbourne Declaration," asked for "real and significant
changes commensurate with the urgency of the problems
we now face."
The declaration mentioned no specific measures, how
ever, and a controversy erupted when one Commonwealth
leader, New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, called
it a "declaration of platitudes."
Commonwealth officials said the document was a "politi
cal statement" and that specific economic issues such as
food, finance, trade and energy would be addressed in the
final communique of the Commonwealth conference this
week.
In a separate statement, Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser made it clear that the declaration was in
tended to give impetus to this month's North-South summit
at Cancun, Mexico. That meeting, to be attended by 22 world
leaders including President Ronald Reagan, has been called
to discuss economic issues dividing rich and poor nations.
In the Melbourne Declaration, the Commonwealth lead
ers said it was "imperative to revitalize the dialogue between
developed and developing countries." It said the world's
"gross inequality of wealth and opportunity" and an "un
broken circle of poverty" in developing countries con
stituted "fundamental sources of tension and instability in
the world."

mid 80s tomorrow. Northwest winds to 15 mph afternoons.

Weinberger, Tower differ on SALT
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that the Reagan administration's plan to mod
ernize the United States' strategic nuclear forces will
strengthen this country's hand in arms control talks with the
Soviet Union.
Weinberger said that the modernization plan, which in
cludes deployment of 100 new MX missiles in existing silos
and production of 100 new supersonic B-1 bombers, im
proves President Ronald Reagan's chances of achieving the
kind of arms reduction he desires when the talks take place.
"It enables us to enter those discussions from a far stronger
point of view and from a far stronger position, which can
enable us to get a far better result," Weinberger said on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
Reagan believes that the strategic arms limitation talks car
ried on by his predecessors in the White House failed to
achieve "a real reduction, an effective verifiable reduction"
in nuclear arsenals, Weinberger said.
Meanwhile, Sen. John Tower, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee and the long-acknowledged
chief spokesman and the leading Senate Republican on de
fense issues, said yesterday that an even stronger bargaining
position would have beer, achieved by shuttling the MX mis
siles among shelters, as originally planned, instead of deploy
ing them in silos hardened to withstand nuclear attack.
And former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown said that
the Reagan administration seems to be afraid to negotiate
with the Soviet Union because of fears that "if you negotiate
with the Soviets, somehow the Soviets are going to come out
ahead."
Tower, interviewed on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said,
"The president said a few weeks ago that if the Soviets will
not agree to arms reduction, we would join them in an arms
race and we will beat them. I think the proposal to put these
MX missiles in existing holes" is contrary to the position the
president had already taken.
While acknowleding that most of the modernization plan,

man silos.

dercut the mayors by banning pro-PLO statements and the
influx of PLO funds into the West Bank.
But at the same time, they are providing area villages with
financial aid and development of electricity, roads and run
ning water — calculating that the rural population which
makes up 70 percent of the West Bank's 750,000 Arabs will
carry decisive weight in the elections envisaged in the auton
omy plan.
Irish prison reform promised
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Britain's top official in
Northern Ireland pledged yesterday to implement prison re
forms for all inmates now that jailed Irish nationalists have
ended their hunger strike.
The violence-torn province was reported quiet. But police
reinforcements were on the streets of Londonderry, Ulster's
second largest city, where marches by the mostly Catholic
supporters of the hunger strike and a counter-demonstra
tion by followers of hard-line Protestant leader Rev. Lan
Paisley were scheduled.
"There are certain reforms which can be introduced. We
will now try to see what we can do about them," Northern
Ireland Secretary James Prior told reporters at Norwich, Eng
land, before departing early yesterday for Belfast.
Ten Irish nationalists, mostly members of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, starved themselves to death at Bel
fast's Maze prison during the seven-month protest that
ended Saturday when the six remaining strikers ended their
fasts.
The prisoners were demanding five prison reforms that
the British government refused to grant on grounds that it
would legitimize the IRA's bloody campaign to oust the Brit
ish from the mainly Protestant province and unite it with the
Irish Republic to the south.
However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held out the
possibility that some reforms would be initiated once the
hunger strike ended.
Prior's remarks yesterday made it clear that Britain will not
treat guerrillas from the mainly Catholic IRA and its allied
Irish National Liberation Army differently from jailed Protes
tant guerrillas. Nearly one-third of the 1500 people jailed for
terrorist offenses in the province belong to Protestant para
military organizations.
"We'll be looking at a policy of reform which will apply to
all prisoners," Prior said. "It's important to get it right... I'll
be moving this week — but not today."
He did not elaborate on what reforms were being con
sidered.
Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, stepped up attacks
on the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and pledged that

"the struggle against the British government will not end."
Announcing an end to the seven-month-old fast on Satur
day, Sinn Fein said the Catholic Church had "robbed" na
tionalists of their propaganda weapon against the British by
convincing families of the hunger strikers to order medical
intervention.
"The prisoners will continue their struggle inside the pris
on and they will use whatever tactics they see fit," Aiden
MacAlteer, a spokesman for Sinn Fein said in a radio in
terview.
The prisoners' demands were for the right to associate
freely, wear their own clothes at all times, do no compulsory
prison work, have 50 percent reductions in their sentences
for good behavior and be allowed to receive more mail and
visits.
Minority education called inferior
Washington— The Reagan administration plans to sue
school boards across the country contending that inferior
education is being provided in some predominantly black
and other minority schools, the Department of Justice's civil
rights chief said.
William Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a recent interview that "several situations" of
such unequal education are under investigation, but he de
clined to say where or when the first suits would be filed.
"These are matters under investigation, and I can't begin
to send off those kinds of signals or every school board in the
country is going to start calling me and asking about it," Rey
nolds said. The first suit is at least several weeks away from
being filed, he said.
The new legal attack, which will be based on the Constitu
tion's Equal Protection Clause, is in line with the adminis
tration's move away from busing or student relocation and
toward civil rights enforcement seeking to enhance the
educational quality of minority schools.
Reynolds said he did not yet have enough information to
gauge how widespread is the problem of educational dis
parity in predominantly black and other minority schools. "I
don't think it's a minor problem or an isolated one. I do think
it exists in a number of places in the country" he said.
Reynolds acknowledged that the new suits are likely to pit
the federal government against so-called de facto segrega
tion — that resulting from neighborhood housing patterns
rather than any action by state authorities. The government
has concentrated on eliminating so-called de jure segrega
tion — that resulting from state or local action.
"While there is this education disparity that exists in many
situations," Reynolds said, "the only time that the courts sug
gest we should begin to address it is if it's de jure segregation
kind of case. If it's de facto, the result of natural neighbor
hood school developments, somehow the courts seem to
suggest that we don't have to look at educational disparity.
Commonwealth nations urge change
Melbourne, Australia — Representatives of 41 British
Commonwealth nations yesterday called on the rest of the
world to support urgent new talks between rich and poor
countries to deal with worsening global economic dis
parities.
The appeal came in a joint declaration by leaders of the
Commonwealth, which groups Britain and its former co
lonies. Issued in the Australian capital of Canberra during
the leaders' weekend retreat, the document, allied the
"Melbourne Declaration," asked for "real and significant
changes commensurate with the urgency of the problems
we now face."
The declaration mentioned no specific measures, how
ever, and a controversy erupted when one Commonwealth
leader, New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, called
it a "declaration of platitudes."
Commonwealth officials said the document was a "politi
cal statement" and that specific economic issues such as
food, finance, trade and energy would be addressed in the
final communique of the Commonwealth conference this
week.
In a separate statement, Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser made it clear that the declaration was in
tended to give impetus to this month's North-South summit
at Cancun, Mexico. That meeting, to be attended by 22 world
leaders including President Ronald Reagan, has been called
to discuss economic issues dividing rich and poor nations.
In the Melbourne Declaration, the Commonwealth lead
ers said it was "imperative to revitalize the dialogue between
developed and developing countries." It said the world's
"gross inequality of wealth and opportunity" and an "un
broken circle of poverty" in developing countries con
stituted "fundamental sources of tension and instability in
the world."
