Edit Board
There will be a staff lunch today to
question editorial board candidates.
Any last minute candidates should
speak to Sam Howe. The election will
be held Tuesday.
Correction
On page three of last Thursday's
Daily, Robin Seeley was quoted but
the quote was attributed to Kathy
Seeley. The Daily regrets the error.
