# The 						Computer Connection
## Apublication of the Stanford Center for Information Technology Personal Computing At Stanford 
### 
In addition to the 20 large,
and almost 300 mid-sized
computers currently operating
at Stanford, there are personal
computers in ever-growing
numbers appearing on cam
pus. Their growth and num
bers reflect that characteristic
which is newly theirs â€” they
are personal, i.e., are designed
for and belong to individuals
whose expertise in computing
ranges from none to that of a
lifetime. The Personal Comput
ing Program of the Center for
Information Technology
(C.1.T.) has been established to
encourage the incorporation of
personal computers into the
University's computing envi
ronment, and to provide ser
vices to the range of actual and
potential owners of personal
computers at Stanford,
at Stanford.
At C.I.T. a concentrated ef
fort is being undertaken to
evaluate the claims of the man
ufacturers of personal compu
ter hardware and software.
This effort bears fruit for fa
culty, staff, and students in the
form of a library of reviews
written or collected by the In
struction and Research Infor
mation Systems (IRIS) staff.
IRIS has also created a network
of referrals to qualified person
nel in retail outlets and con
sulting firms in the Bay Area
who are familiar with Stanford
computing and who can be of
further assistance to those from
the campus seeking to acquire
or enhance their personal
computer systems.
Some of the personal com
puters currently on the market
come with, or can have added

to them, hardware and/or
software that allow them to
communicate among them
selves or with other network
services. In this way, for exam
ple, an Apple can be used to
read stock market quotes, a
TRS-80 the morning news.
C.I.T. has taken the initiative
to adapt software for campus
owners of Apple II computers,
allowing them to use their
computer as a terminal on the
Stanford University Network
(SUN) and to transfer files back
and forth between the large
IBM computer and their micro
processors. The software, with
appropriate instructions, is
available in Document Sales in
Forsythe Hall, where an ac
count can be opened for use of
services on SUN. Reviews of
similar software (produced
elsewhere) for Radio Shack's
TRS-80s is available as part of
the collection of evaluations.
Personal computer owners
on campus have formed
SMUG, the Stanford Mi
crocomputer Users Group,
whose regular meetings are a
forum for the exchange of in
formation and lore, and an oc
casion for keeping up to date
on events in this rapidly chang
ing technical area. Evaluation
of software products and
suggestions for file transfer
functions for other micros is
fair game for SMUG meetings.
Further information about
the Personal Computer Pro
gram, about the evaluation lib
rary, or about SMUG (includ
ing the schedule and agendae
for its meetings), can be ob
tained by calling IRIS at 497-
1055.
