# Need A Terminal? Rent One From C.I.T.
## 
### 
People use computer termi
nals for various reasons. The
three main reasons are 1) to be
able to interact with a particu
lar computer job, 2) to run
computer jobs without going to
the computer center (although
terminals are available at the
computer center), and 3) to do
text or data preparation and
editing. If you have a computer
account at C.I.T. you may wish
to use the public terminals in
various locations around cam
pus (there is a public terminal
room in Forsvthe Hall, which is
open 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week), or you may wish to rent
a terminal to use in your office
or residence. C.l.T.'s Data
Communications specialists
can help you decide which
terminal is most suitable for
your needs. You can call them
at 497-0577. Both screen
display (cathode-rav tube) ter
minals and hard-copy (like a
typewriter) terminals are avail
able. Monthly rental prices
range from $55 to $125 for the
more popular models. The ren
tal fee includes maintenance
and the necessary equipment
to connect the terminal to the
computer, using your tele
phone. A limited number of
portable hard-copy terminals
are available for short-term (1-2
day) rental, as well as over
night and weekends. Contact
the Information Desk at 497-
4392 if you need a portable. If
you own a terminal, and have
an account with C.1.T., you
may want to inquire about the
maintenance and repair ser
vices available from Data
Communications.
