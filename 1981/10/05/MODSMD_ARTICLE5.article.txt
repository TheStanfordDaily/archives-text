# Need for housing to grow with time

### Harsha Murthy 
Stanford may need to provide
housing or subsidies for 3000 to 4000
faculty and staff members by 1990,
said University President Donald
Kennedy in his address to the Aca
demic Council Friday.
Kennedy's announcement on
housing came in a speech about
"general long-range planning" for
the University. Kennedy said housing
plans were "based on current Penin
sula projections for job-housing ra
tios and home prices."
Kennedy said housing has been
the biggest barrier to faculty re
cruitment at Stanford for several
years. He added that the high cost of
living in the Peninsula not only
makes recruitment difficult but also
creates "intense competition" for
the University workers already in the
area.
The University has undertaken
plans to increase housing both on
and near campus. One hundred and
forty units of faculty-staff housing are
under construction in the Peter
Coutts project. Plans are also being
made for 800 new units of on-campus
undergraduate housing and 1600
new apartments on Willow Road,
across from the Medical Center. In
addition, the proposed con
dominium conversion of the Oak
Creek apartments presents an op
portunity to acquire up to 200 units.
According to a University press re
lease, the University has committed
$11 million to co-investment pro
grams in faculty housing in the last
two years.
"It is a good thing to plan, especial
ly after there have been changes in
leadership, when new opportunities
present themselves, or when an in
stitution faces a special anniversary.
All of these are true for Stanford,"
said Kennedy.
While noting the need for long
range planning, Kennedy acknowl
edged that it was not necessary for
Stanford to create a single, centrally
designed comprehensive plan to ac
complish its objectives.
"There is much in the academic
tradition which is antagonistic to
planning. Planning cannot gain the
status of a state religion that it enjoys
in many corporate settings. The en
durance of institutions like ours is
due to the fusion of circumstances.
The cultural consensus of a university
scarcely includes planning," he said.
Nonetheless, he said it was neces
sary for the faculty and adminis
tration to consider "the shape of our
ambitions for the University."
Kennedy quipped that he felt "like
Senator (William) Proxmire talking
about the federal budget to his
friends." Kennedy was referring to
the 24-hour filibuster Proxmire (D-
Wisc.) staged last week on the federal
deficit ceiling, a filibuster that was
often delivered to a nearly empty
Senate chamber.
Kennedy then listed several "char
acteristics of Stanford" which con
stitute its quality and should be pre
served as goals.
On the issue of undergraduate
education, he said selectivity must be
maintained in the admission pro
cess. "But there is an accompanying
emphasis on diversity in our student
body, because interaction among
students is viewed as an active agent
of the educational experience here."
He said Stanford would continue
to emphasize a general or "liberal"

education rather than preparing stu
dents for "immediate occupational
roles."
"We believe that learning takes
place all day, in all settings; as a con
sequence we are committed not
merely to housing our under
graduate students but to establishing
firm relationships between the cir
cumstances of their housing and
their opportunities to gain maximum
advantage from one another and
from the academic program," Ken-

He stated that graduate programs
would continue to have a "broad
scope" and be inclusive. He said the
professional schools and other aca
demic departments should remain
small and "oriented to producing
graduates for leadership roles having
High professional leverage.
The overall equal size in the under
graduate and graduate populations
should be maintained, Kennedy said.
Because a university can rarely
achieve economies of scale merely
by increasing its size, theenrollments
of both undergraduate and graduate
students should be held at "approx
imately their present level," accord
ing to the president.
Turning to the issues of faculty
characteristics and objectives, Ken
nedy said that scholarships would re
main a necessary condition for facul
ty appointments. However, he said,
"because we also believe seriously in
the importance of teaching — in its
broadest construction — we try to
give that equal emphasis."
He continued saying that Stanford
tries to promote the notion of "a
community of scholars" among its
faculty through such programs as
non-degree postdoctoral studies and
the promotion of junior faculty.
Kennedy concluded his speech
with a discussion of capital and tech
nological planning for the University.
"We are very active about announ
cing our intentions and publishing
our own self-assessment. These ef
forts continually recharge our supply
of self-understanding," he said.
In other business at Friday after
noon's meeting, memorial resolu
tions were observed for professors
Carl Brand, Theodore Kreps and Clif
ford Weigle. Assistant Professor of
Political Science David Abernethy
presented a report on the Senate's
spring quarter activities.
