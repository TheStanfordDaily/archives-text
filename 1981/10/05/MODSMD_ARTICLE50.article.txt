# Student Computing: LOTS... And More
## 
### 
How can a computer help an
English major write a term
paper? How can a freshman
sociology major utilize compu
ter statistical programs? Where
does a beginning math major
go to learn about the number
crunching powers of a compu
ter?
If your answer to any of the
above questions is "Who
cares?" then read no further.
However, if you would like to
establish a useful, non
committal relationship with a
black box, student computing
is for you.
Computers are no longer
simply fancy calculators that
can do untold things with
numbers; they serve to com
plement and supplement sci
entific and language
laboratories, seminar and tuto
rial sessions, telephones and
typewriters, and library refer
ence desks and card catalogs.
The term "instructional
computing" refers to the use of
the computer as a tool or an aid
in the instructional process.
The computer can be used to
solve problems associated not
only with computing and en

gineering but also with
humanities, sciences (natural
and social), education, busi
ness, medicine, and law.
Computer-aided instruction
is utilized in many classes to
provide tutorials on a number
of topics. In addition, text
editing and formatting pro
grams can allow students to
write and revise papers much
more easily than with conven
tional methods.
The LOTS (Low-Overhead
Time-Sharing) computer facil
ity has provided interactive
computing for students since
1976. Last winter it became ob
vious that because of the suc
cess of LOTS, more computing
power was needed. The Uni
versity's Center for Information
Technology then made
available computer time on
Stanford's IBM facility. C.I.T. is
working closely with the LOTS
facility and with members of
the faculty to provide comput
ing to students this academic
year, and to promote a broader
application of information
technology in instruction in
the future.
LOTS is available to students

enrolled in specific courses
that utilize the computer for
homework assignments. It is
also available on a limited basis
for unsponsored research, text
preparation, and other course
work. Computer terminals and
printers are available in the
Center for Educational Re
search at Stanford (CERAS)

and in the Terman Engineering
Center. There is no charge for
computer time, but terminal
time is limited to weekly al
lotments determined by the
courses a student is taking and
the demands for terminals.
At the beginning of each
quarter, orientations are con
ducted, demonstrating the

procedures of using the com
puter and assisting each stu
dent in setting up his or her
computer account. On-going
consulting is provided by stu
dent volunteers.
For more information, con

at 497-3214 or C.I.T. at 497-
1055.

raphic information. Here is the RLIN system being used in the
