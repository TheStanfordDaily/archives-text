# Computer Search Services

### 
As a returning or new stu
dent, you may not know that
using the Computer Search
Services of the libraries can
save you time and energy and
help you produce better pap
ers, reports, theses or even
books.
"By using the Computer
Search Service," Guy
Westmoreland, Data Services
Librarian, says, "you can have
access to online searches of
over 100 databases produced
by learned societies, govern
ment agencies, and other or
ganizations." These databases
provide national or interna
tional coverage; they are not
limited to material owned by
the libraries of Stanford Uni
versity. The libraries access
these databases through vari
ous vendor organizations such
as Bibliographic Retrieval Ser
vices (BRS), DIALOG Informa
tion Services, Inc., The Na
tional Library of Medicine,
System Development Corpora
tion (SDC), The New York
Times Information Service,
and Source Telecomputing
Corporation.
Most of these databases con
sist of references to articles in
periodicals and scholarly jour
nals, conference proceedings,
dissertations, books, govern
ment documents, technical re
ports, or other published and
unpublished material. Refer
ences to chemical formulas, pa

tents, and economic statistics
can be found in other data
bases. These databases often
contain the same information
found in printed reference
sources. However, sometimes
there is no printed equivalent
to the database. Subject areas
covered include business and
management, engineering
technology, humanities, life
and physical sciences, and
social/behavior sciences. Gen
erally, the databases fit into one
of three categories:
BIBLIOGRAPHIC: contain
ing the title, author, publica
tion source, and often a sum
mary of the information pub
lished in periodical/journal ar
ticles, books, technical reports,
etc.
FACTUAL: containing or
ganization (e.g., foundation &
business) names and addres
ses, biographical information,
©tc.
NUMERIC/STATISTICAL:
containing economic and labor
statistics, securities prices, and
other similar data.
A library staff search analyst
will interview you to obtain a
clear understanding of your re
search topic and will recom
mend one or more relevant
databases for an online search.
The search analyst will aid you
in selecting keywords (subject
terms), and then formulate a
search strategy designed to re
trieve relevant information.

Then, by using a computer
terminal, the analyst will con
duct the search in the data-
selected. The search
generally yields one or more
unique lists of bibliographic re
ferences, or of numeric or fac
tual material.
An on-line search generally
costs $10 to $30. Many people
find that the speed, flexibility,
and comprehensiveness of this
service are well worth the cost.
In order to obtain additional in
formation, contact the Refer
ence Department staff at any
library on campus.
Stanford University Lib
raries is also a member of the
Research Libraries Group
(RLG) whose membership in
cludes over 22 other major lib
raries such as Columbia, New
York Public, and Yale. This
gives Stanford access to RLG's
Research Libraries Information
Network (RLIN). For a given
library's staff, scholars, and
students, RLIN provides a
machine-readable database
that includes not only the
equivalent of their own lib
rary's card catalog, but also the
catalogs of other member and
user institutions, plus catalog
ing produced by the Library of
Congress. In most cases, there
is no fee to students and faculty
for searches of the RLIN
database. Ask at any library re
ference desk for further infor
mation on RLIN.

mend one or more relevant
databases for an online search.
The search analyst will aid you
in selecting keywords (subject
terms), and then formulate a
search strategy designed to re
trieve relevant information.

Then, by using a computer
terminal, the analyst will con
duct the search in the data-
selected. The search
generally yields one or more
unique lists of bibliographic re
ferences, or of numeric or fac
tual material.
An on-line search generally
costs $10 to $30. Many people
find that the speed, flexibility,
and comprehensiveness of this
service are well worth the cost.

Stanford University Lib
raries is also a member of the
Research Libraries Group
(RLG) whose membership in
cludes over 22 other major lib
raries such as Columbia, New
York Public, and Yale. This
gives Stanford access to RLG's
Research Libraries Information
Network (RLIN). For a given
library's staff, scholars, and
students, RLIN provides a
machine-readable database
that includes not only the
equivalent of their own lib
rary's card catalog, but also the
catalogs of other member and
user institutions, plus catalog
ing produced by the Library of
Congress. In most cases, there
is no fee to students and faculty
for searches of the RLIN
database. Ask at any library re
ference desk for further infor
mation on RLIN.
As a returning or new stu
dent, you may not know that
using the Computer Search
Services of the libraries can
save you time and energy and
help you produce better pap
ers, reports, theses or even
books.
"By using the Computer
Search Service," Guy
Westmoreland, Data Services
Librarian, says, "you can have
access to online searches of
over 100 databases produced
by learned societies, govern
ment agencies, and other or
ganizations." These databases
provide national or interna
tional coverage; they are not
limited to material owned by
the libraries of Stanford Uni
versity. The libraries access
these databases through vari
ous vendor organizations such
as Bibliographic Retrieval Ser
vices (BRS), DIALOG Informa
tion Services, Inc., The Na
tional Library of Medicine,
System Development Corpora
tion (SDC), The New York
Times Information Service,
and Source Telecomputing
Corporation.
Most of these databases con
sist of references to articles in
periodicals and scholarly jour
nals, conference proceedings,
dissertations, books, govern
ment documents, technical re
ports, or other published and
unpublished material. Refer
ences to chemical formulas, pa

tents, and economic statistics
can be found in other data
bases. These databases often
contain the same information
found in printed reference
sources. However, sometimes
there is no printed equivalent
to the database. Subject areas
covered include business and
management, engineering
technology, humanities, life
and physical sciences, and
social/behavior sciences. Gen
erally, the databases fit into one
of three categories:
BIBLIOGRAPHIC: contain
ing the title, author, publica
tion source, and often a sum
mary of the information pub
lished in periodical/journal ar
ticles, books, technical reports,
etc.
FACTUAL: containing or
ganization (e.g., foundation &
business) names and addres
ses, biographical information,
©tc.
NUMERIC/STATISTICAL:
containing economic and labor
statistics, securities prices, and
other similar data.
A library staff search analyst
will interview you to obtain a
clear understanding of your re
search topic and will recom
mend one or more relevant
databases for an online search.
