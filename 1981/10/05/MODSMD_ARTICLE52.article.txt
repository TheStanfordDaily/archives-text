# Take A Course And Use A Computer
## 
### 
Academic courses using
computers are on the increase.
According to C.l.T.'s recently
published A Guide to Compu
ter and Information Technol
ogy Resources at Stanford
(1981), there are many
academic departments using
computers in courses. Some of
them are as follows:
School of Earth Sciences
• The Geology Department's
DEC computers are used in
a course on Microprobe and
X-Ray Fluorescence
Analysis (Geo 279).
• The Geophysics Depart
ment uses computers for in
struction and research in re
flection seismology, X-ray
diffraction experiments,
and for magnetometer read
ing and analysis (check out
Geophysics courses 284,
385 A, 1858/3858, 185E/
385E, 185G/385G).
School of Engineering
• Much of the computing ac
tion in research and in

struction is in the Aero I
Astro Department. The sys
tem there supports En
gineering 207 and 208: Di
gital Control I and 11.
• The Civil Engineering De
partment offers several
computer-supported
courses in its graduate Con
struction Engineering and
Management Program.
• Electrical Engineering lists
Introduction to Computer
Organization, Machine and
Assembly Languages (181),
and the Computer as a
Laboratory Instrument
(274).
• The Engineering-Economic
Systems Department fo
cuses on all aspects of large
technological-economic
and socio-economic sys
tems. Computers are used
extensively for modeling
both in formal coursework
and field internships.
• Materials Science and En
gineering uses two DEC
systems for coursework and

research in the Solid State
Electro-Chemistry Lab.
• Mechanical Engineering
uses a DEC system to sup
port undergraduate courses
in the High Temperature
Gasdynamics Lab. The
Smart Product Design Lab
supports ME 218 (Smart
Product Design), studying
the application of mic
rocomputers to consumer
and instrumentation pro
ducts. There are also
computer-supported grad
uate courses in engineering
design (210, 211).
Humanities and Sciences
• The Anthropology Depart
ment has a Hewlett Packard
system with programs
custom-tailored to the
needs of Anthropology fa
culty and students.
• The Computer Science De
partment is of course the
academic focal point for
computing. Its programs
and philosophy are well
described in both the Stan-

ford University Bulletin
and the above-mentioned
Guide published by C.I.T.
CSD has interdisciplinary
connections with the In
dustrial Engineering De
partment, the Graduate
School of Business, the Op
erations Research Depart
ment, and the Electrical
Engineering Department,
as well as with several
computing facilities and
laboratories on the campus.
The Linguistics Depart
ment offers courses in con
junction with the Computer
Science, Philosophy, and
Psychology Departments.
These are Computational
Models for the Syntax of
Natural Language (CS 275),
Computational Models for
the Semantics of Natural
Languages (CS 276), Com
puters and Language (CS
75), and Topics in Compu
tational Linguistics (CS
277).
The Music Department is
associated with the well-

known and exciting Center
for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics.
Music offers Computer-
Generated Music (220),
Fundamentals of
Computer-Generated
Sound (220 A), Composi
tional Algorithms,
Psychoacoustics, and Spa
tial Processing (220B), and
Research (220 C).
• The Physics Department
uses minicomputers for in
struction in modular mod
eling and spectrophotome
ter data collection and man
ipulation. It has established
its own terminal center this
year, which allows access
to LOTS and C.1.T., and of
fers some support to stu
dents.

Research (220 C).
• The Physics Department
uses minicomputers for in
struction in modular mod
eling and spectrophotome
ter data collection and man
ipulation. It has established
its own terminal center this
year, which allows access
to LOTS and C.1.T., and of

Academic courses using
computers are on the increase.
According to C.l.T.'s recently
published A Guide to Compu
ter and Information Technol
ogy Resources at Stanford
(1981), there are many
academic departments using
computers in courses. Some of
them are as follows:
School of Earth Sciences
• The Geology Department's
DEC computers are used in
a course on Microprobe and
X-Ray Fluorescence
Analysis (Geo 279).
• The Geophysics Depart
ment uses computers for in
struction and research in re
flection seismology, X-ray
diffraction experiments,
and for magnetometer read
ing and analysis (check out
Geophysics courses 284,
385 A, 1858/3858, 185E/
385E, 185G/385G).
School of Engineering
• Much of the computing ac
tion in research and in

struction is in the Aero I
Astro Department. The sys
tem there supports En
gineering 207 and 208: Di
gital Control I and 11.
• The Civil Engineering De
partment offers several
computer-supported
courses in its graduate Con
struction Engineering and
Management Program.
• Electrical Engineering lists
Introduction to Computer
Organization, Machine and
Assembly Languages (181),
and the Computer as a
Laboratory Instrument
(274).
• The Engineering-Economic
Systems Department fo
cuses on all aspects of large
technological-economic
and socio-economic sys
tems. Computers are used
extensively for modeling
both in formal coursework
and field internships.
• Materials Science and En
gineering uses two DEC
systems for coursework and

research in the Solid State
Electro-Chemistry Lab.
• Mechanical Engineering
uses a DEC system to sup
port undergraduate courses
in the High Temperature
Gasdynamics Lab. The
Smart Product Design Lab
supports ME 218 (Smart
Product Design), studying
the application of mic
rocomputers to consumer
and instrumentation pro
ducts. There are also
computer-supported grad
uate courses in engineering
design (210, 211).
Humanities and Sciences
• The Anthropology Depart
ment has a Hewlett Packard
system with programs
custom-tailored to the
needs of Anthropology fa
culty and students.
• The Computer Science De
partment is of course the
academic focal point for
computing. Its programs
and philosophy are well
described in both the Stan-

ford University Bulletin
and the above-mentioned
Guide published by C.I.T.
CSD has interdisciplinary
connections with the In
dustrial Engineering De
partment, the Graduate
School of Business, the Op
erations Research Depart
ment, and the Electrical
Engineering Department,
as well as with several
computing facilities and
laboratories on the campus.
The Linguistics Depart
ment offers courses in con
junction with the Computer
Science, Philosophy, and
Psychology Departments.
These are Computational
Models for the Syntax of
Natural Language (CS 275),
Computational Models for
the Semantics of Natural
Languages (CS 276), Com
puters and Language (CS
75), and Topics in Compu
tational Linguistics (CS
277).
The Music Department is
associated with the well-

known and exciting Center
for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics.
Music offers Computer-
Generated Music (220),
Fundamentals of
Computer-Generated
Sound (220 A), Composi
tional Algorithms,
Psychoacoustics, and Spa
tial Processing (220B), and
Research (220 C).
• The Physics Department
uses minicomputers for in
struction in modular mod
eling and spectrophotome
ter data collection and man
ipulation. It has established
its own terminal center this
year, which allows access
to LOTS and C.1.T., and of
