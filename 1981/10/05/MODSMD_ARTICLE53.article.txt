The Center for Information
Technology offers many short
courses on C.l.T.'s computing
services. All Stanford students,
faculty and staff may take these
seminars and courses.
The short courses range from
introductory concepts (learn
ing how to use WYLBUR, a text
editing system), to database
design (how to use the SPIRES
database management system
to gain access to existing
databases and to understand
database concepts and
facilities), to standard applica
tions of statistical packages
like SAS and SPSS. Thesis

of one course. See the schedule
