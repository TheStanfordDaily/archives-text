### 
A Guide to T^no\ogV

There are more than 300
computer systems throughout
Stanford University, the Stan
ford Medical Center, and SLAC
(the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center). There are
about twenty large computers
in use, but there are also about
300 mid-size and countless
microprocessors that are used
by students, faculty, and staff.
The growing number of smal
ler machines reflects the gen
eral trend of computing and in
formation processing today, a
trend that is becoming increas
ingly complex and interesting.
In an attempt to provide a
general description of what
kinds of machines are in use,
where they are, and what they
are used for, Stanford's Center
for Information Technology
(C.1.T.) has prepared a Guide to
Computer and Information
Technology Resources, which
serves as an overview to the

multitude of available comput
ing services.
The guide is itself an exam
ple of what can be done with
computer technology, for it
was prepared using advanced
techniques in data entry, text
editing, and computerized
typesetting, enabling the
Center to update and re-issue
the Guide in an extremely effi
cient manner.
It provides readers with a
glimpse of hardware and
software systems currently in
use in many diverse fields of
academic endeavor at Stan
ford. In it you may find that
your department has special
funds for computing services,
and you may find descriptions
of computerized research in
your field. It explains ac
ronyms like LOTS, SPIRES,
and ARPANET. You can read
about databases available at
Stanford, or nationwide
through TELENET and TYM
NET.

The guide describes not only
how computers aid complex
processes of research and in
struction but also how they
help maintain the intricate
functioning of the University
community, fou can also find
out about how computer ter
minals in the Stanford libraries
can help you locate titles, au
thors, and subjects for the more
than four million books in the
online catalog of the Research
Libraries Group.
You can read about programs
designed to help you prepare
your thesis or research papers
by analyzing the data and for
matting the text, and if you
need to learn how to use these
programs, the guide also tells
you how to sign up for C.l.T.'s
courses in computer instruc
tion. Copies are for sale at
C.l.T.'s Document Sales Office
in Forsythe Hall, and most de
partments and laboratories
have reference copies.
