pronounceable, but it means
the Academic Council Com

committee formulates and re
views policies concerning the
character and use of
University-wide computing
and information systems, on
behalf of the Academic Coun

of this committee are students.
The committee assesses
campus-wide needs and uses
recommendations from the di
rectors of campus computing
and information facilities to
make determinations about fu

ture directions and allocation
of computing/information
technology resources, and the
coordination of existing
facilities within the Stanford
community. If you have an in
terest in these future direc
tions, you should get to know

committee. The Chairman is
