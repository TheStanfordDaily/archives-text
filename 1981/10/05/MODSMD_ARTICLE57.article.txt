A Guide to Services on the
3033 A, produced by the Center
for Information Technology,
offers practical guidance to
those interested in the
capabilities of Stanford's IBM
computer in Forsythe Hall.
The guide outlines the kinds
of languages and programs that
are available on that system. It
tells you how to open an ac
count and use the many ser
vices available, and describes
general policies and practices,
such as those relating to in
struction and courses,
documentation, costs, security,
and your responsibilities as a
user of the computer. Also de
scribed are C.l.T.'s data plot
ting facilities, printing
facilities, networks available
for data communication, and
other services to the user, such
as software support and con

suiting.
Ph.D candidates will be glad
to know that a thesis formatting
facility is available, which ful

Stanford Graduate Program Of
fice, and there are also alterna
tive formats for master's theses
and final projects. Using
WYLBUR (a Stanford-designed
text-editing system) and
SCRIPT (a text formatter from
the University of Waterloo), for
example, it is possible to pro
duce these important docu
ments, as well as many other
kinds of reports, proposals, and
manuscripts.
This guide is an effective
overview, designed to answer
many of your questions about
how to use Stanford's IBM
computing facility. It is availa
ble at the Document Sales Of
fice in Forsythe Hall.
