# Context—A Writing Tool
## 
### 
Context is a new text
processing and communica
tion system that runs on C.l.T.'s
DEC 2060 computer. Context
assists writers in the develop
ment of papers and books, class
notes, memoranda, letters,
proposals, and reports.
An integral part of the
emerging campus information
network, Context also serves as
a medium for communication
— from simple exchange of
messages and electronic dis
tribution of documents to
browsing of online data banks.
Context users also have access
to other computing, text
processing, and information
systems at Stanford.
The simplicity of sharing in
formation on the Context sys
tem fosters effective communi
cation among its users and im
proves communication. For
example, preparation of papers
on the system promotes the ex

change of ideas among faculty
and between students and fa
culty, since the practical obsta
cles to reworking initial ver
sions are greatly reduced.
The Context system com
prises a family of programs,
used successfully over the
years by faculty, support staff
and students, which include
editors, formatters, a search
program, a message system,
and printing service.
Context services can be
purchased at hourly rates, for a
flat-rate monthly charge, or on
a longer-term basis. For further
information and copies of a
brochure giving more details,
including the differences bet
ween word processors and
Context, and other information
on terminals, training, and
Context demonstrations, call
