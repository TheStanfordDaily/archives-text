# Short-term loans provide fast funds for students with unexpected expenses
## 
### Lisa Stern 
The Office of Financial Aids has begun to review
and accept applications for its Short-Term Loan
Program, which started last week as students regis
tered for classes.
These loans, which are made available to indi
viduals while school is in session, are designed to
assist these experiencing unanticipated personal
expenses and emergencies. The money, however,
cannot be obtained to pay or clear University bills,
which include tuition, room and board.
While students may receive as little as $50 and as
much as $500 the average amount of the loans ap
proved last year was $450. Students requesting a
loan of more than $500 will be considered individ
ually. The loans, which are interest-free, should be
repaid in three months. Although the Office of Fi
nancial Aids will sometimes approve extensions
warranted by unusual circumstances, overdue
loans will accrue a five percent interest charge.
Further penalties on delinquent loans include
"holds" placed on future registration.
The Short-Term Loan Programs was initiated and

is currently funded by both private donors and
University departments. Sources of money include
donations by alumni, some of whom, such as K.
Dixit and George Vargas, were once recipients of
loans themselves. Clubs, philanthropists and
schools also allocate money specially earmarked
for students experiencing cash-flow problems and
other unexpected emergencies.
In order to receive a short-term loan, applicants
must follow a four step process. Interested individ
uals must first obtain the appropriate loan form
from the Office of Financial Aids in Old Union. The
department can only consider requests filed each
quarter beginning on Registration Day until 10
working days before the last day of the quarter.
The student must then complete the loan au
thorization form and the short-term loan applica
tion. In order to qualify for a loan, the applicant
must demonstrate ability to pay as well as a positive
record of credit. Such qualifications can be met by
a review of Guaranteed Student Loan standing, a
letter of prospective employment, or even a letter
from parents.
Individuals must then submit completed forms

to the financial aids receptionist, who will arrange
for the counselor on call to discuss the reasons for
the loan and the terms upon which it will be
granted.
After a loan is approved, the money may be ob
tained at the Student Accounting Office in Old
Union. Potential applicants are advised to plan
ahead since ten working days are typically needed
to process the loan. Quick authorization is pos
sible, however.
Students took full advantage of the program last
year; between 700 and 800 loans were processed.
Roberta Johnson, asst. director of Student Loans,
said she believes the current success of the pro
gram depends upon the individual's ability to re
pay the loan. Funds then can be reapplied to the
program to maximize the number of students who
can receive money, she said.
"The University is very willing to make loans for
almost any unanticipated living expense," she said,
"as long as the student has mapped out a careful
repayment plan." Johnson added, "The students
really appreciate the program."
