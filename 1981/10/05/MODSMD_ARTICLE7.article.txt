## Venezuela to buy F-1 6s from US 
### Washington Post 
Caracas, Venezuela — The Reagan ad
ministration has agreed to sell 24 F-16
fighter planes to Venezuela in what would
be the first delivery of such advanced U.S.
weapons to a Latin American country in
almost a decade. It would also mark a sig
nificant step in Venezuelan efforts to fill
what it regards as a vacuum of influence in
Latin America.
The warplanes deal, under which Vene
zuela would pay some $500 million for 18
F-16s and six F-16Bs, a training model of the
plane, is expected to be forwarded to Con
gress by the administration later this
month, although there is a slight chance
that the action could be postponed or
modified as a result of controversy over
sales of AWACS electronic surveillance
planes to Saudia Arabia and F-16s to Paki
stan, officials here and in Washington said.
If approved, delivery of the Venezuelan
planes would begin early in 1984.
Nixon ended sales
The agreement would represent the first
supply of such sophisticated arms to Latin
America by the United States since the
Nixon administration announced in 1972
that such deals could hurt economic de
velopment and only increase instability in
the region. U.S. officials acknowledge that
the breaking of the ban is likely to increase
pressure from other Latin American gov
ernments for U.S. military equipment.
Nevertheless, administration officials
feel the sale is justified by Venezuela's
growing importance as a supporter of U.S.
policy in El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin
America, and by what is perceived as the

increased threat from Cuba, whose rela
tions with Venezuela have recently deteri
orated.
Despite Venezuela's identification with
many U.S. actions in the region — a close
ness that is regarded with suspicion by
some other Latin American countries —
the government here has pursued its own
forceful program of political intiatives and
development aid and has differed with the
Reagan administration on several points,
including support for Nicaragua and rela
tions with the dictatorial regimes of Cen
tral America and South America's south
ern cone.
Independent of U.S. policy
Venezuelan officials say the F-16
purchase, part of a program of upgrading
the armed forces, complements what they
see as a growing Venezuelan effort to es
tablish an influence in the region inde
pendent of the superpowers.
As a result, the Venezuelans believe they
are "filling a gap left by the United States"
in Central America and the Caribbean,
said Haydee Castillo de Lopez, a leading
member of the governing Christian Dem
ocratic Party. She said the party maintained
an "energetic refusal to be the middleman
for the United States" in the region, add
ing, "The United States has neglected its
interests through misperceptions of social
and political reality."
In Nicaragua, for example, Venezuela
has continued substantial economic aid to
the Sandinista government even while
criticizing its arms buildup and leftward
course, and officials here maintain that the
Reagan administration — with its cutoff of

aid — has lost the ability Venezuela has to
influence the course of the Sandinistas.
"We want Nicaragua to have a pluralistic
democracy," Castillo de Lopez said. "And
it is not by abandoning Nicaragua that we
can do that."
Nicaragua is included in a Si billion an
nual program of Venezuela and fellow oil
producer Mexico to supply and subsidize
petroleum for 11 Central American and
Caribbean countries.
Anti —U.S. aid to dictators
President Luis Herrera has to reporters
last week that the Reagan administration in
its first months "abused the threat" of
armed intervention in El Salvador. Refer
ring to relaxation of U.S. pressure on mili
tary dictatorships in the area, Herrera
warned that the United States could not
"continue following a policy of sustaining
dictatorships as it has in the past." During
the Kennedy and Carter administrations,
he added, Latin American dictators "at
least had the impression that they were not
explicitly backed" by Washington.
Currently, Venezuela's Air Force is
equipped mainly with French Mirages and
British Canberra fighter-bombers.
One high U.S. official here said that be
cause of the impending sale of F-16s, "It's
possible that there would be other govern
ments (in South America) that would want
them and that we would sell." But other of
ficials said the administration believes that
requests for F-16s from such countries as
Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia are not
likely now because of the planes' high
cost.
