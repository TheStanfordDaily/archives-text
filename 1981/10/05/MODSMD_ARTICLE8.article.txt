# German deal frees 3000 and master spy
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — The
story of the highest-placed East
German spy to be unmasked in
the West came to a close late
last week as East Germany
handed over to West Germany
about 30 political prisoners and
proceeded to grant exit visas to
3,000 East Germans in return
for Guenter Guillaume's re
lease.
Guillaume, who was arrested
on April 24,1974, had come to
West Germany with his wife
two decades before and
worked his way up through the
Social Democratic party to
serve as an aide to Chancellor
Willy Brandt.
Brandt, in the wake of the es
pionage discovery, resigned
two weeks later.
Guillaume was whisked out
of West Germany Thursday
night into East Germany, pass
ing through the East-West

border checkpoint at
Herleshausen in the southeast,
riding in a camper van that was
trailed by a Mercedes.
Could have been more
The completion of the swap
left Bonn officials relieved but
also frustrated that leaks to the
press a week ago had foiled
prospects of a grander interna
tional espionage trade ar
rangement.
As originally reported, Den
mark, France and South Africa
were to give up jailed East Ger
man or Soviet agents as part of
the deal. But the West German
news leaks reportedly angered
the other Western govern
ments and may have scuttled
what were still delicate nego
tiations. In the end, the trade
remained just a German affair.
"Negotiations of this kind
gain nothing from publicity,"
Bonn government spokesman
Kurt Becker told reporters. He

said that the final scope of the
deal did not meet "the satisfac
tion of the federal govern
ment."
West German captives
The official disappointment
in Bonn that more West Ger
mans could have been freed
was echoed by Egon Franke,
West German minister for in
ter-German affairs, who said,
"Some people will regrettably
have to remain longer in East
German custody because of
these indiscretions, because of
these boastful disclosures."
Franke reported that among
those released by East Germa
ny were three persons who
were serving life sentences,
one of whom had already spent
13 years in jail. Several others
had faced sentences of 10 to 15
years.
In addition to Guillaume,
West Germany handed over
three other agents, including a

former Bonn ministry secre
tary, Renate Lutze, who had
been sentenced to six years in
1979 for spying. The identities
of the other two involved were
not disclosed.
History of exchanges
Such spy exchanges belong
to the discreet deals of politics,
and there is a history of more
than a half-dozen known
trades between the two Ger
manies stretching back over
several decades. The names,
dates and exact terms involved
in a number of other spy swaps
have gone undisclosed. But to
day's arrangement unques
tionably ranks as the largest.
Guillaume's wife, Christel,
who had received an eight
year sentence in 1975 for her
assisting role in West Germa
ny's most extraordinary spy
scandal, was freed last March in
exchange for several West Ger
mans held in East German jails.
