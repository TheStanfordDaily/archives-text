# Bombings threaten Lebanese

Beirut, Lebanon (AP) — Terrorized by
bombings that have killed 146 people in the
past 17 days, merchants in this divided capital
began to erect makeshift barricades late last
week to shield themselves from booby
trapped cars.
"We are living like rats. We go out and we
don't know if we will be alive in an hour," said
May Salameh, whose antique shop was
leveled by a bomb during Lebanon's
1975-1976 civil war.
Hidden explosives and parked cars packed
with bombs have brought this combat-weary
country to a state of agonizing nervousness.
When and where will the next bomb go off
and who is really doing the bombing are
questions Lebanese constantly ask them
selves.
Desperate feelings
Placing cinder blocks in front of his money
changing booth in the west Beirut business
district, Hassan Ramiz said, "I don't feel any
safer, but it is the only thing that might work."
A little-known group called the Front for
the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners
has claimed responsibility for the five worst

explosions, including a blast Thursday that
killed 92 people and wounded more than 300
others in the administrative nerve center of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
In a call to the news media after that ex
plosion, the group warned that further at
tacks would be aimed against the Palestinians
and the 22,000 Syrian troops policing the civil
war cease-fire.
Unsure allegations
The PLO and its leftist Moslem allies say the
front is actually a facade for Lebanese Chris
tians who recruit agents for Israel.
PLO spokesman Mahmoud Labady, a sur
vivor of Thursday's explosion, charges that
Lebanon's intelligence agency conspires with
the Christian Phalange Party and the Israelis
to help plant the bombs.
Israel has denied the charges, blaming the
bombings on rival factions within the PLO.
The Phalangist "Voice of Lebanon" radio
station said Syria-based renegade Palestinian
leader Sabri Banna is behind the blasts. He is
under a PLO death warrant for allegedly
threatening to kill the PLO's leader Yasir
Arafat.
