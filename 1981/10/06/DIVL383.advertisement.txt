If you're a senior, you'll be job hunting soon—and
V everyone knows how much fun that is. 300 resumes ...
V saving forever for stamps ... that letter to Dream Corp.
W you've written 12 times. You're beginning to wonder if
W you'll ever attract anyone's attention.
I Why not let Dream Corp. come to you?
J CPR could be the answer. We're an information
service that will give over 10,000 employers in 44 countries
access to your complete records. (Any idea how much
stamps for 10,000 letters would cost?)
Here's how it works: You fill out a short form, listing
your career and geographic preferences, your special skills,
■ our GPA. This information is fed into the DIALOG
nformation Retrieval Service—a system used by businesses
r/ rge and small, by research firms, accounting and insurance
mpanies, publishers, advertising agencies, international and
Itinational corporations, most of the Fortune 1,000.
Employers search through computer terminals for a
bination of factors, such as your degree, your languages, your
icurricular background, and so on. If you have what they
, you won't have to get their attention.
They'll come to you.
nstant access, instant searching, instant results. All for $8.
