# O'Connor debuts as Court opens session
## Reviews promised of vetos, libel laws 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Supreme Court, opening a
new fall term, agreed yesterday to review the con
stitutionality of the so-called "one-House veto," a
source of a long-standing power struggle between
Congress and the White House.
The justices announced that they would review
the controversy-laden procedure by which Con
gress declares that an action by a president or his
aides may take effect only so long as neither the
House nor the Senate votes against it.
Over the last decade, Congress has attached
one-House veto provisions to scores of measures.
American presidents since Woodrow Wilson have
argued that such restrictions run afoul of the
scheme set out in the U.S. Constitution under
which the president proposes legislation subject to
the approval of both houses of Congress.
The court's ruling on the case — which will be
decided by next July — could significantly affect
the balance of power between the executive and
legislative branches of the federal government.
The one-House veto dispute was one of 23 sepa
rate legal controversies that the justices agreea to
take up when they reconvened yesterday.
In another major case involving criminal law, the
justices announced that they would review the
constitutionality of an unusual Nebraska ballot
measure that denies all persons accused of certain
sex crimes the right to post bail.
And in a controversy with important ramifica
tions for the television and motion-picture in
dustries, the court agreed to decide what legal
standards should apply when a once-famous indi
vidual who has been out of the public eye for dec
ades files suit for libel or invasion of privacy.
The T.V. case involves Victoria Price Street, the
woman who was the complaining witness in the
famed Scottsboro rape trials in Alabama in the
19305. Street objected to a 1976 NBC documentary
about the trials. She claims that she should be con
sidered a private figure and should therefore not
have to prove that NBC acted with malice in order
to win a libel and invasion-of-privacy suit that she
filed against the network.
Yesterday was also the first day of public sessions
for justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's
newest member. O'Connor sat quietly through a
series of lawyers' arguments. She asked very few
questions — in fact, none at all in one hour-long
hearing on the extent to which secretaries and oth
er so-called "confidential employees" are covered
by federal labor laws.
O'Connor did not vote in some of the hundreds
of cases on which the justices acted yesterday —
apparently because she had not had time to pre
pare before the justices' closed conferences began
last week.
O'Connor did provide at least one important
clue to her legal views: like her predecessor,
former Justice Potter Stewart, she apparently does
not believe that capital punishment is inherently
unconstitutional.
When the court refused to review 19 separate

criminal cases in which death sentences had been
imposed, Justices Thurgood Marshall and William
Brennan dissented.
The two justices tacked on what has become for
them a standard single-sentence dissent noting
that they believe the death penalty "in all circum
stances" violates the Eighth Amendment ban on
cruel and unusual punishment. O'Connor, like the
other six justices, refused to sign that dissent.
The one-House veto case that the court agreed
to review arose after the U.S. Immigration and Nat
uralization Service tried to deport a Kenyan of East
Indian descent named Jagdish Rai Chadha, whose
student visa had expired.
A law passed by Congress gives the U.S. attorney
general authority to suspend deportation of an in
dividual in some cases of "extreme hardship." But
this law includes a one-House veto provision giv
ing either the Senate or the House of Represent
atives authority to override the attorney general's
decision.
In 1974, an immigration judge representing the
Department of Justice suspended deportation of
Chadha on ground that he might be subject to ra
cial discrimination if sent back to Kenya. But a year
later, at the behest of former Rep. Joshua Eilberg,
(D-Pa.), head of an immigration subcommittee,
the House voted to require the deportation of
Chadha and five other aliens.
Chadha then went to court, contending that the

one-House veto provision was unconstitutional.
Last December, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Ap
peals in San Francisco ruled in his favor, conclud
ing that the restriction on executive authority vio
lates principles of separation of powers, and the
procedures set up in Article I of the U.S. Constitu
tion.
In May, the Department of Justice urged the Su
preme Court to hear the case, saying it "presents
constitutional issues of the most fundamental na
ture regarding the distribution of powers among
the branches of the federal government."
Throughout the court proceedings, the Depart
ment of Justice has agreed with Chadha's conten
tion that the one-House veto is invalid. As a result,
both the Senate and House of Representatives,
represented by their own lawyers, have filed sepa
rate legal papers in the case. The House is being
represented by noted constitutional scholar
Eugene Gressman.
In the dispute over bail laws, the justices will
hear an appeal by Nebraska officials from a ruling
by the U.S. Bth Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis
striking down as unconstitutional a measure that
denied bail to sex offenders. The appeals court
held that the provision violated the Eighth Amend
ment guarantee that "excessive bail shall not be re
quired."
The case concerns Eugene Hunt,
who was kept in jail when he was ar
rested for a sexual assault in Omaha
shortly after the no-bail measure was
approved by Nebraska voters in 1978.
Hunt was subsequently convicted
and is serving a prison sentence.
Street filed her libel and invasion
of-privacy suit against NBC after it
aired a program called "judge
Horton and the Scottsboro Boys" in
1976. She complained that she had
unfairly been referred to in the pro
gram as a "whore" and a "bum."
The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Ap
peals in Cincinatti held that Street
was a public figure, pointing out that
she accused nine black youths of rap
ing her at a series of trials in Scot
tsboro, Ala., in the 19305.
But Street — described in court pa
pers as a destitute woman living on a
monthly Social Security check — said
that she had completely withdrawn
from public view after the trials and
should not have been considered a
public figure 40 years later.
In other actions yesterday, the jus
tices:
— Refused by a vote of 7 to 2 to re
view the constitutionality of state
laws that prevent most adopted per
sons from getting access to the of
ficial records that would inform them
of the names of their natural parents.
The justices dismissed two challenges
to New York and Illinois laws provid
ing for secrecy in adoption records,
saying these challenges did not raise
any "substantial federal question."
Justices Brennan and John Paul
Stevens dissented, saying that the
court should have heard the two
cases.
— Agreed to decide whether the
United States had the right to sign an
agreement with the Philippines giv
ing preference to Filipinos for some
jobs at the U.S. naval station at Subic
Bay. Four American citizens in the
Philippines have argued that agree
ment did not take the form of a for
mal treaty, and was therefore invalid.
