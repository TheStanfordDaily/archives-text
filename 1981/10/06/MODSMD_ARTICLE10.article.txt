# Germans planning huge peace protest
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — A
huge peace demonstration
planned for Bonn next Satur
day has aggravated the already
unpeaceful condition of West
German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt's Social Democratic
Party.
Schmidt, describing the rally
as a potential "challenge to the
government," sought to dis
courage party participation in
it at a closed-door meeting re
cently of the party presidium
and parliamentary group. But
by the end of last week, 55 So
cialist members of parliament
— roughly one-fourth of the
party's parliamentary faction —
had signed a petition announc
ing they would be in the streets
of this small city next weekend
alongside a wide assortment of
groups, including communist,
environmental and church or
ganizations, expected to swell
the demonstration to well over
100,000 participants.
Anti-nuclear weapons
The general purpose of the
demonstration is to show con
cern for the buildup of nuclear
weapons in Europe. But many
groups participating in the ac
tion here specifically oppose
Atlantic alliance plans to sta
tion U.S. medium-range mis
siles in Western Europe begin
ning in late 1983.
Schmidt's warning appeared
to clash with remarks by party
chairman Willy Brandt, who
sounded more sympathetic to
the protest. Brandt cautioned
against violence and one-sided
complaints citing U.S. nuclear
missiles while ignoring Soviet
ones, but the former West Ger
man chancellor did not oppose
participation in the rally by So
cialist deputies.
Haig policies protested
The event, likely to be West
Germany's largest antimissile
protest so far, comes one
month after a large and partly
violent demonstration in West
Berlin that coincided with a vis
it there by Secretary of State
Alexander Haig.
The Schmidt-Brandt clash
was somewhat exaggerated by
a West German press primed
these days for any new trace of
strain in the Socialist party's
beleaguered leadership and
followed severe Socialist elec

tion Inssp* in thp statp of Lowor
Saxony last weekend. The
losses were interpreted as a
sign of a national trend of pub
lic annoyance at the party's
divided stance in both military
and economic security issues.
The two leaders' contrasting
comments on the Bonn rally re
flected the basic differences
that emerged last week be
tween Schmidt and Brandt
over how best to reinvigorate
the party.
Schmidt wants U.S. missiles
Schmidt, mindful of the rela
tively silent majority he per
ceives in his party and in the
country who still support his
government's firm endorse
ment of the NATO missiles
plan, is taking a firm stance
aimed at winning back disaf
fected party regulars, largely
working-class people.
Brandt, reaching out for
youth votes, holds to the possi
bility of keeping the party's left
wing integrated with the rest,
although this often requires
skillful ambiguity in his public
statements.
Brandt approves protest
In an interview with a party
magazine last week, Brandt
again seemed to be going in
two directions at once. Appear
ing to endorse the ptace
movement, the party chief re
marked, "There have been
worse things on German soil
than young people taking a
stand for peace and disarma
ment." But he also remarked
that unilateral disarmament
was not an acceptable course.
At a closed-door meeting
here over the weekend of 500
of the party's grass-roots func
tionaries, party leaders could
do little but attempt to smooth
over the differences while ad
mitting they have an image
problem.
The results of a poll, released
by the Allensbach Institute,
confirmed that the erosion in
party support recorded in last
weekend's state election was
indeed part of a national trend.
The survey showed the Social
Democrats had slipped seven
percentage points, to 36 per
cent, since last October's fed
eral elections, while the op
position Christian Democrats
had climbed to around 50 per
cent.
