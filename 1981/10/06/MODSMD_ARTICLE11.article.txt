# Israel opposes AWACS
## 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — Israel said
Sunday that Saudi Arabia's ap
parent refusal to accept Ameri
can crews on the AWACS spy
planes it hopes to buy from the
United States proves the Saudis
intend to deploy the aircraft
against it.
The Cabinet of Prime Min
ister Menachem Begin said in a
statement that Saudi opposi
tion to any "partnership" with
the United States was "addi
tional proof, if any were
needed," that the arms sale
would be "a grave danger to
the security of Israel."
Saudi Arabia said Saturday it
would share information
gathered by the AWACS with
the United States but said it
"does not accept any partner
ship as regards these planes."
The U.S. Embassy said its staff
translated "partnership" as
"sharing" in the Arabictext but
officials added they were not
sure what exactly the Saudis
had in mind.

Undersecretary of State
James Buckley had told a con
gressional committee that vari
ous "understandings" with the
Saudis included this point:
"Only carefully screened Saudi
and U.S. nationals will be per
mitted to be involved with
these aircraft. Given the short
age of Saudi aircrews and tech
nicians, this means that there
will be an American presence
in the aircraft and on the
ground well into the 19905."
The Reagan administration
proposed joint U.S.-Saudi con
trol over the sophisticated Air
borne Warning and Control
Systems planes in an attempt to
win over congressional oppo
nents who fear the Saudi
monarchy might collapse and
put the planes into revolu
tionary hands, as happened
with U.S.-made equipment
sold to Iran.
Congress has until Oct. 31 to
block the sale by resolutions in
both houses.
