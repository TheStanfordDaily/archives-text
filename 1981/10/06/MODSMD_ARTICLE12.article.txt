# University offers diversity in jobs
## 
### Debbie Appel 
With tuition costs skyrocketing and
everyday expenses from the Coke ma
chine to the clothes dryer increasing as
well, many Stanford students find it es
sential to hold down a part-time job.
However, coordinating work schedules
with classes, papers, midterms, IM's and
at least some semblance of a social life
can be a job in itself.
Fortunately, there is a wide variety of
convenient, on-campus jobs available
which not only provide the student
with a source of extra income, but offer
him a chance to have fun, meet people
and even learn a thing or two.
Hashing jobs
A good place to start job hunting may
be at one of the University residence
dining halls. These popular 'hashing'
jobs include dishwashing, serving, line
checking and busing. Although many
hasing jobs are part of a student's
work/study package, there are often
openings during the year.
Pay starts at $3.85/ hr. and increases
according to the number of years pre
viously worked at Food Services. Most
students work 8-10 hours per week.
Hashing is valued mainly for its con
venience to students — many live in the
dorm complexes where they work.
John Pennington, a hasher at Wilbur
Hall, sees the job as especially conve
nient because one can work "around
meal times and not notice the time put
into it." He added, "It's work, but the
people, the other hashers and those
that come through the food line make it
interesting."
Libraries
Students desiring employment at one
of the many University libraries (Meyer,
Green, Cubberley, Music, Chemistry,
etc.) should contact the personnel of
fice at Green. There, job requisitions
and information on specific duties and
hours are posted. Students first browse
through these descriptions, then con
tact the appropriate supervisors

through the personnel office.
Wages range from $3.85/ hr. to a max
imum of $5.45/ hr., depending on the
number of academic quarters of em
ployment and the level of responsibility
and judgment the job entails.
Junior Corinne Meyer has been
working at Meyer Library for three
years, "It's a great way to get to know
the library — you know how to get hold
of books when you need them ... But
it's also a people-oriented job. There's
lots of contact with other students
which drags you out of the books."
Meyer says she does not find working a
10/ hr. week to be an interference with
her studies.
The University library system em
ploys 300-500 students per quarter and
students can also look into the coordi
nate libraries (Law Library, SLAC, Medi
cal Library, to name a few for other op
portunities.)
Student Employment Office
Many students have found interest
ing, diversified jobs through the Stu
dent Employment Office, a division of
the Career Planning and Placement
Center. The SEO lists 300-500 new part
time jobs each month and although it
maintains a separate on-campus listing,
most jobs are within biking distance of
Stanford.
Offerings range from research posi
tions (the most popular) to house clean
ing (the least in demand). Among the
opportunities listed are teaching, tutor
ing, translating, gardening and office
and clerical positions. Most non-tech
nical jobs pay $4-$4.50/ hr. Work/Study
programs are also available, for which a
student needs to register with the SEO.
Tresidder Union
Tresidder Union offers numerous job
opportunities. Students can choose an
area in which they are interested,
whether it be in the business office, the
information or recreation center,
Union Crossroads, STARTS or the store.
According to Larry Davidson, assis
tant director and personnel adminis

trator at Tresidder, "a job at the Union is
not just a job." He considers the Union
to be a training ground — a chance to
gain valuable experience. There is am
ple incentive to work one's way up
through the ranks to supervisory or
managerial positions. Interested stu
dents can stop by Tresidder to in
vestigate various jobs, guidelines and
wages.
Coffee House
Although located at Tresidder, the
Coffee House is a separate entity with
its own employment procedure and
pay scale. It is nearly completely stu
dent-staffed and has a greater demand
for student employment.
What positions are available at the
Coffee House? "Everybody does ev
erything," said manager Steve Weiss.
"This includes everything from sand
wich maker to cashier to taking out the
garbage." Workers are trained in an ex
tensive three-hour program (offered
Monday through Thursday 3-6 p.m.) in
every facet of operations.
The workday consists of 8-hour long
shifts which are divided up to ac
comodate students' needs, according
to Weiss. Worker Greg Haetl sees the
Coffee House as a lot of fun. "I like mak
ing sandwiches and talking to people in
line. Work doesn't tend to interfere
with anyone's schedule since employes
set their own hours."
Other opportunities
There are undoubtedly more job op
portunities available on the Stanford
campus. For example, a try at the Book
store may result in a job as a cashier or
stock person, with a 15/ hr. minimum
work week, $3.85 starting pay, and a dis
count on booksl A stop by the ASSU of
fice (deadline Oct. 12) may yield one of
two dozen work/study positions which
offer students a chance to work on new
ASSU projects and task forces.
Besides providing extra spending
money, campus jobs are convenient,
educational — and, often, fun.

and information on specific duties and
hours are posted. Students first browse
through these descriptions, then con

through the personnel office.
Wages range from $3.85/ hr. to a max
imum of $5.45/ hr., depending on the
number of academic quarters of em
ployment and the level of responsibility
and judgment the job entails.
Junior Corinne Meyer has been
working at Meyer Library for three
years, "It's a great way to get to know
the library — you know how to get hold
of books when you need them ... But
it's also a people-oriented job. There's
lots of contact with other students
which drags you out of the books."
Meyer says she does not find working a
10/ hr. week to be an interference with
her studies.
The University library system em
ploys 300-500 students per quarter and
students can also look into the coordi
nate libraries (Law Library, SLAC, Medi
cal Library, to name a few for other op
portunities.)
Student Employment Office
Many students have found interest
ing, diversified jobs through the Stu
dent Employment Office, a division of
the Career Planning and Placement
Center. The SEO lists 300-500 new part
time jobs each month and although it
maintains a separate on-campus listing,
most jobs are within biking distance of
Stanford.
Offerings range from research posi
tions (the most popular) to house clean
ing (the least in demand). Among the
opportunities listed are teaching, tutor
ing, translating, gardening and office
and clerical positions. Most non-tech
nical jobs pay $4-$4.50/ hr. Work/Study
programs are also available, for which a
student needs to register with the SEO.
Tresidder Union
Tresidder Union offers numerous job
opportunities. Students can choose an
area in which they are interested,
whether it be in the business office, the
information or recreation center,
Union Crossroads, STARTS or the store.
According to Larry Davidson, assis
tant director and personnel adminis

trator at Tresidder, "a job at the Union is
not just a job." He considers the Union
to be a training ground — a chance to
gain valuable experience. There is am
ple incentive to work one's way up
through the ranks to supervisory or
managerial positions. Interested stu
dents can stop by Tresidder to in
vestigate various jobs, guidelines and
wages.
Coffee House
Although located at Tresidder, the
Coffee House is a separate entity with
its own employment procedure and
pay scale. It is nearly completely stu
dent-staffed and has a greater demand
for student employment.
What positions are available at the
Coffee House? "Everybody does ev
erything," said manager Steve Weiss.
"This includes everything from sand
wich maker to cashier to taking out the
garbage." Workers are trained in an ex
tensive three-hour program (offered
Monday through Thursday 3-6 p.m.) in
every facet of operations.
The workday consists of 8-hour long
shifts which are divided up to ac
comodate students' needs, according
to Weiss. Worker Greg Haetl sees the
Coffee House as a lot of fun. "I like mak
ing sandwiches and talking to people in
line. Work doesn't tend to interfere
with anyone's schedule since employes
set their own hours."
Other opportunities
There are undoubtedly more job op
portunities available on the Stanford
campus. For example, a try at the Book
store may result in a job as a cashier or
stock person, with a 15/ hr. minimum
work week, $3.85 starting pay, and a dis
count on booksl A stop by the ASSU of
fice (deadline Oct. 12) may yield one of
two dozen work/study positions which
offer students a chance to work on new
ASSU projects and task forces.
Besides providing extra spending
money, campus jobs are convenient,
educational — and, often, fun.


A HAVEN FOR JOB HUNTERS — The Student Em
ployment Office offers students 300-500 new part-time
lobs each month, many of which are within easy biking
distance of the Stanford campus. Offerings range from

Sylvia Kistler/Daily
research positions to house cleaning; there are also
opportunities for teaching, tutoring, translating, gar
dening and office work.
With tuition costs skyrocketing and
everyday expenses from the Coke ma
chine to the clothes dryer increasing as
well, many Stanford students find it es
sential to hold down a part-time job.
However, coordinating work schedules
with classes, papers, midterms, IM's and
at least some semblance of a social life
can be a job in itself.
Fortunately, there is a wide variety of
convenient, on-campus jobs available
which not only provide the student
with a source of extra income, but offer
him a chance to have fun, meet people
and even learn a thing or two.
Hashing jobs
A good place to start job hunting may
be at one of the University residence
dining halls. These popular 'hashing'
jobs include dishwashing, serving, line
checking and busing. Although many
hasing jobs are part of a student's
work/study package, there are often
openings during the year.
Pay starts at $3.85/ hr. and increases
according to the number of years pre
viously worked at Food Services. Most
students work 8-10 hours per week.
Hashing is valued mainly for its con
venience to students — many live in the
dorm complexes where they work.
John Pennington, a hasher at Wilbur
Hall, sees the job as especially conve
nient because one can work "around
meal times and not notice the time put
into it." He added, "It's work, but the
people, the other hashers and those
that come through the food line make it
interesting."
