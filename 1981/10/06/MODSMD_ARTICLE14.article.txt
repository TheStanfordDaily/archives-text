## Copiers: cards to deal with 
### Steve Trousdale 
Whih most students were
away for summer vacation, a
new copying-machine system
was installed in severai libraries
around campus — including
the Music, Art, Green, Meyer
and Cubberley libraries.
The new system operates
with a bulk copy card — the
more copies bought the more
money saved. According to
Dick Smith, assistant library di
rector for administrative ser
vices, economy was one of the
primary reasons for installing
the new system; without the
bulk rate, copying would cost
students 10 cents per page.

(Last year, copies in library ma
chines cost 5 cents per page.)
The new service, according
to Smith, has two major advan
tages over the old one — first,
there are now nine more ma
chines than there were last
year; and second, Copico,
which operates the machines,
has a technician on duty during
library operating hours to ser
vice the machines.
One disadvantage is that the
new copies are "wet" copies
on slick paper, while last year's
were dry copies on rough pa
per. Smith also said that there
have been several minor ser
vice problems.

Prices for the cards vary on a
sliding scale depending on the
number of copies for which the
card is programmed. For exam
ple, a card for 100 copies costs
$7.50, with single copies cost
ing only 7.5 cents each. Some
one needing a larger amount
of copies could buy a card for
5000 copies at the price of
$237.50, or 4.75 cents per copy.
Cards for 100, 300, 500, 1000,
and 5000 copies are available at
the main Bookstore, the Term
an Engineering Building snack
bar, the Copy Center at Green
Library, and the Copy Center
of the Graduate School of Busi
ness.

GOOD-BYE TO THE DAYS OF THE 5 CENT COPY — The new copier machines which were
installed over the summer operate on a bulk rate system — the more copies one buys, the
less the price of each copy. A single copy now costs 10 cents, while a card for 100 copies
makes the price 7.5 cents for each copy.
