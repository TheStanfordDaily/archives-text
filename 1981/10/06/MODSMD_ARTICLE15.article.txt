Next autumn the under
graduates lucky enough to
have drawn into the new hous
ing system being built near
Lake Lagunita will be coming
back to wall-to-wall carpeting,
solid oak bureaus and desks,
and modular furniture which
can be arranged and rear
ranged at the slightest whim.
This development will bring
to Stanford an innovative, and
complex, housing system
which will feature three dif
ferent types of housing ar
rangements: independent
houses similar to the row
houses, a four-house complex
comparable to Lagunita Court
residences, and suites.
It is these suites which make
the development most revolu
tionary. In each unit, four or six
students will have single
bedrooms centered around a
common living room. The liv
ing rooms are to have fire
places, sofas and chairs. Also,
unlike those in the four-house
complex and the independent
houses, suite residents will get
their meals from eating clubs.
Features common to the en
tire complex include wall-to
wall carpeting (except in bath
rooms and some small dining
areas), and modular furniture,
in which pieces fit into one an
other and may be arranged in a
variety of ways. Building a loft,
for example, will no longer in
volve buying wood, bolts, etc.,
but instead can be assembled
in minutes by simply rearrang
ing and folding out the mod
ular unit.

To save additional space,
desk tops will be only two feet
deep, with a one foot fold-up
section. When not in use, the
panel can be tucked behind
the desk.
Tubular steel chairs and table
legs, round wooden furniture
pieces and upholstered chairs
have been chosen in keeping
with the modern decor.

This development will bring to
Stanford an innovative and complex
housing system which will feature
three different types of housing
arrangements...
(each with) wall to wall carpeting,
solid oak bureaus and desks, and
modular furniture which can be
arranged and rearranged at the
slightest whim.

Color schemes for the new
residences will be brighter
than most Stanford students
are accustomed to. According
to Elizabeth Kittas, one of the
people in charge of interior de
sign, the walls will be painted in
"natural colors such as
eucalyptus green leaf, berries,
and a range of browns."
The exteriors of the 15 new
buildings will be stucco with
red tile roofs.
By next fall, the independent
houses should be ready forstu-

dents. One of the houses will
be the theme house for East
Asian Studies â€” there are pres
ently no plans for themes in
other houses.
Altogether, the new com
plex will house 800 under
graduates. There will be 90 stu
dents in each of the four
houses of the connected hous
ing facility, and the independ-

ent houses will provide living
space for 60 students each.
With this addition to the Uni
versity housing system, gradu
ates will move into the trailer
park which undergraduates
presently occupy.
Groundbreaking for the new
complex is scheduled for next
Monday. Completion of the in
dependent houses is set for
next autumn and the rest of the
complex will be ready for oc
cupation during the 1983
school year.
