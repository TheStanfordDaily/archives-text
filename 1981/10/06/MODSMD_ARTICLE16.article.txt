## Editorial Explain malathion hazards 
### 
When University residents arrived back on
campus this fall, they received a letter from
Norman Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs for residential education. It presented a
generally optimistic view of the health effects of
malathion-bait aerial spraying. It called
malathion "one of the safest insecticides in use
today" and said that no known health hazards
have resulted from the aerial spraying of the
pesticide.
The letter concluded by saying that the
greatest risk from malathion bait spraying is
"unnecessary anxiety among the residents of
the area."
The fact is, there is still much debate in the
scientific community about the safety of
malathion. The University should have
acknowledged the complexity of the issue in the
letter.
Such a lopsided approach is patronizing; it is
simplisticto the point of being dangerous.
Perhaps no one knows of any malathion-caused
health hazards today. But 30 years ago, no one
knew that caffeine, cyclamates, and saccharine
were unhealthy. The University was careless to

ignore the possibility of potential long-term
health hazards caused by malathion. There is a
certain incongruity in calling malathion safe,
then urging students to wash their skin
thoroughly with soap and water if they are
exposed to the spraying.
The Daily also wonders why the
administration has suddenly become so one
sided about the spraying issue. As staff writer
Gale Warner pointed out (Daily, Oct. 2), two
Stanford pharmacologists who once voiced
deep concern about the safety of the pesticide
have suddenly clammed up. The Medical
Center news bureau has said they are
"unavailable for interviews," and a doctor's
secretary told the Daily, "he's not going speak
out on that any more."
The health hazard issue is too important to be
whitewashed. If knowledgablescientists believe
that the safety of malathion has yet to be proven,
they should speak out â€” whatever the policy of
the University is. Moreover, the administration
should present the entire complex issue to
students in itsinformational letters. Todoany
less is irresponsible.
