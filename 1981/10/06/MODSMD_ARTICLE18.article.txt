## A 						weary Nader must chart new course 
### 
Washington — It was about 9:30 the other night
when we saw our old friend Ralph Nader trudging
home from work. He was walking up Connecticut
Avenue, carrying his worn raincoat, two briefcases
and looking as serious as ever.
It's the life that Ralph Nader, America's consum
mate consumer advocate, has been leading for the
last 15 years.
This weekend, Nader celebrates the 10th an
niversary of his consumer empire. But the 47-year
old bachelor probably won't boogey all night with
Mario Thomas at a gala benefit Saturday night.
Ralph's in tha^fumps.
After a long decade of successful consumerism,
Nader's movement seems stalled. His multifaceted
organization has won numerous legislative vic
tories in Washington and heightened the nation's
awareness of corporate and government abuses.
Yet Public Citizen has been forced into a holding
pattern lately, busy preserving its past successes.
The election of Ronald Reagan has dealt Nader a
nasty blow.
In a short period, Reagan has pulverized many
safety regulations Nader & Co. sweated years to
implement. And Reagan's just begun reshaping
many of Nader's pet projects, such as the nation's
environmental laws.
Though Nader believes his cause will prevail af
ter the Reagan program collapses, he's become in
creasingly testy since the GOP mandate last fall.
According to staffers, Nader is frustrated that af
ter ten years he hasn't found a better way to chan
nel his energy. Lobbying legislators and making
speeches to college students lack the impact they
once had. While Nader won't acknowledge his

predicament, some staffers are trying to help "find
Ralph a project... He's spinning in his tracks."
Nader's uneasiness has affected his crusading
conglomerate as well. Staff members are openly
questioning his tactics.
"After spending two years writing reports for
Ralph," said one former staffer, "I began to ask
what value they had. No one, including con
gressmen, seemed to read what I wrote. I was
spending 90 hours a week at the office, earning
$150 and little I did had any impact."
As seasoned advisers have left his side, Nader's
been forced to rely on young idealists. Never a
good manager, Nader spends an increasing
amount of time making airline reservations and
searching for paper clips.
Perhaps Nader's current misfortunes are sadly
reflected by his standing in the Gallup Poll. It's
been several years since his name appeared on that
organization's "most admired" list.
For better or for worse, Nader faces several
critical options on his 10-year anniversary: He can
continue his work and risk losing the country's in
terest entirely, or he can embark on a new track.
Several aides are pressuring him to take a year's
sabbatical and write a book. They believe a book
purely by Nader would serve liberals as economist
Milton Friedman's work has benefited conserva
tives.
Others are rooting that Nader will grow more
pragmatic and start his own political action com
mittee. And there are still some friends who'd like
to see the hard-working ascetic go for broke and
run for president.
For years Nader has contended that he's not in

terested in seeking national office. "I would lose
rather than gain if I were elected to office," he
once told us. "I'm already more effective than
most politicians."
Whatever Nader does, he should seriously con
sider dividing his research and advocacy arms.
With Nader's organization publishing several
monthly newspapers and a steady stream of books,
it's often hard to distinguish the journalists from
the activists in the Nader camp.
In the meantime, Nader is sponsoring another
one of those conferences this weekend during
which delegates will discuss how to organize food
co-ops and gain access to the public airwaves.
Little will probably come out of the meeting,
though — Naderites aren't known for their politi
cal organizing.
Ever since Nader starred so successfully on "Sat
urday Night Live," he should have learned that his
name and face can be good political capital.
Beyond the college lecture treadmill lie political
waters Nader has yet to test. He hc.s many political
allies who could use his support. Unless he relishes
impotency, Nader may be forced to become more
involved on their behalf.
Just last week, Nader urged a crowd of Univer
sity of Maryland students to get "political" and op
pose President Reagan's economic policies. But
the same can be said to Citizen Nader. Use your
name, position and political capital more directly,
Mr. Nader, or you soon may become an asterisk.

Washington — It was about 9:30 the other night
when we saw our old friend Ralph Nader trudging
home from work. He was walking up Connecticut
Avenue, carrying his worn raincoat, two briefcases
and looking as serious as ever.
It's the life that Ralph Nader, America's consum
mate consumer advocate, has been leading for the
last 15 years.
This weekend, Nader celebrates the 10th an
niversary of his consumer empire. But the 47-year
old bachelor probably won't boogey all night with
Mario Thomas at a gala benefit Saturday night.
Ralph's in tha^fumps.
After a long decade of successful consumerism,
Nader's movement seems stalled. His multifaceted
organization has won numerous legislative vic
tories in Washington and heightened the nation's
awareness of corporate and government abuses.
Yet Public Citizen has been forced into a holding
pattern lately, busy preserving its past successes.
The election of Ronald Reagan has dealt Nader a
nasty blow.
In a short period, Reagan has pulverized many
safety regulations Nader & Co. sweated years to
implement. And Reagan's just begun reshaping
many of Nader's pet projects, such as the nation's
environmental laws.
Though Nader believes his cause will prevail af
ter the Reagan program collapses, he's become in
creasingly testy since the GOP mandate last fall.
According to staffers, Nader is frustrated that af
ter ten years he hasn't found a better way to chan
nel his energy. Lobbying legislators and making
speeches to college students lack the impact they
once had. While Nader won't acknowledge his

predicament, some staffers are trying to help "find
Ralph a project... He's spinning in his tracks."
Nader's uneasiness has affected his crusading
conglomerate as well. Staff members are openly
questioning his tactics.
"After spending two years writing reports for
Ralph," said one former staffer, "I began to ask
what value they had. No one, including con
gressmen, seemed to read what I wrote. I was
spending 90 hours a week at the office, earning
$150 and little I did had any impact."
As seasoned advisers have left his side, Nader's
been forced to rely on young idealists. Never a
good manager, Nader spends an increasing
amount of time making airline reservations and
searching for paper clips.
Perhaps Nader's current misfortunes are sadly
reflected by his standing in the Gallup Poll. It's
been several years since his name appeared on that
organization's "most admired" list.
For better or for worse, Nader faces several
critical options on his 10-year anniversary: He can
continue his work and risk losing the country's in
terest entirely, or he can embark on a new track.
Several aides are pressuring him to take a year's
sabbatical and write a book. They believe a book
purely by Nader would serve liberals as economist
Milton Friedman's work has benefited conserva
tives.
Others are rooting that Nader will grow more
pragmatic and start his own political action com
mittee. And there are still some friends who'd like
to see the hard-working ascetic go for broke and
run for president.
For years Nader has contended that he's not in

terested in seeking national office. "I would lose
rather than gain if I were elected to office," he
once told us. "I'm already more effective than
most politicians."
Whatever Nader does, he should seriously con
sider dividing his research and advocacy arms.
With Nader's organization publishing several
monthly newspapers and a steady stream of books,
it's often hard to distinguish the journalists from
the activists in the Nader camp.
In the meantime, Nader is sponsoring another
one of those conferences this weekend during
which delegates will discuss how to organize food
co-ops and gain access to the public airwaves.
Little will probably come out of the meeting,
though — Naderites aren't known for their politi
cal organizing.
Ever since Nader starred so successfully on "Sat
urday Night Live," he should have learned that his
name and face can be good political capital.
Beyond the college lecture treadmill lie political
waters Nader has yet to test. He hc.s many political
allies who could use his support. Unless he relishes
impotency, Nader may be forced to become more
involved on their behalf.
Just last week, Nader urged a crowd of Univer
sity of Maryland students to get "political" and op
pose President Reagan's economic policies. But
the same can be said to Citizen Nader. Use your
name, position and political capital more directly,
Mr. Nader, or you soon may become an asterisk.
