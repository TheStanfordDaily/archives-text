## Draft return threatens freedom, morality 
### 
Congress is currently considering
four bills which would reinstate the
president's authority to institute a
draft. Even though during his cam
paign he promised to abolish regis
tration, President Ronald Reagan has
nominated a hawk, Major General
Thomas Turnage, to direct the Selec
tive Service system. Turnage hopes to
institute a mandatory six-month mili
tary orientation camp for draftees as
well as continuing the formation of
local draft boards begun under his
predecessor.
These events seem to indicate a re
turn to conscription, which poses a
serious threat to the freedom and
morality of young Americans.
Conscription is a deprivation of
freedom in that the draftee cannot
choose which branch of the military

he is to serve, and can neither say
what he chooses to say nor live where
he chooses to live. Hence, he loses
basic freedoms guaranteed to all oth
er Americans.
But conscription denies more than
the individual liberties of the draftees
involved. It requires them to enter
the armed forces, and the armed
forces requires draftees to devote
two years of their lives to waging war.
But should the government have the
power to tell an individual to kill?
Does not the government, through
conscription, abolish the individual's
freedom to follow his conscience in
choosing to allow others to live or
die? And in confiscating the right of
the individual to follow his cons
cience, doesn't the government vio
late the personal morals of the draf

tees?

Cartoons political
This letter responds to some of the
cartoons which I have been seeing in
the Daily. The two cartoon which I
am referring to in particular make po
litical statements in the guise of in
nocuous humor. I hope that in the
future these political statements will
be identified as such.
The sexist violence displayed in the
carton "Roommate Pains" (Daily,
Sept. 29) was an excellent example of
pornography, but unfortunately it
was not the end of the presentation
of a particularly disconcerting and
dangerous perspective. The "Grade

Point" (Daily, Oct. 2) cartoon by
Mark Wilson displays a Native Ameri
can student, complete with bow and
arrow, intent upon injuring his sup
posedly "hip" (does this mean un
biased?) roommate. Later, after an at
tack, the white youth is seen com
menting about the chances of this as
sault occurring at Yale. Is this a subtle
attempt at defining the role/nature
of minority students at Stanford? Or,
is this a syndicated column that im
plies that non-white students are ob
viously dangerous to the health of all
"hip" white males within the con
fines of the academic environment in
North American institutions of
higher learning?
