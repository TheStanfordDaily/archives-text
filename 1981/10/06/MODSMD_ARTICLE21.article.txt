## Markets do not decide financial fates 
### 
The Fates of Greek mvthology
spun a thread upon which hung ev
ery man's life. These three women, in
their cool, detached manner, passed
continual judgement on all, and their
displeasure resulted in immediate
extermination.
Our economic policymakers of to
day may seem to face a similar panel
of wise but pitiless judges. In place of
the Fates, though, sit the Markets,
known as Stock, Bond and Short
term Debt. According to some, the
Markets have passed judgement
against President Ronald Reagan's
economic program and have
snipped its lifeline through plunging
stock prices and high interest rates.
One cannot, however, view the
markets this way. They do not serve
as a "report card" on economic poli
cy. Rather, the present state of the fi
nancial markets reflects the complex
supply-and-demand relationships
which underlie them; driven, of
course, by übiquitous economic self
interest.

To beg t with, we must note that
high interest rates are equivalent to
low bond prices. When bonds are is
sued, they have a fixed price (say,
$1000 per bond) and a fixed interest
rate (say, 10 percent). If the market
rate is at 15 percent, though, no one
would want to buy the bonds at 10
percent.
What the market does is allow the
$1000 price to be bid down, say to
$750, to compensate the bond buyers
for the low interest rate. Thus if the
market interest rate rises from 10 per
cent to 15 percent, bond prices must
fall, by $250 in our example.
The problem today is therefore
one of low prices for all financial as
sets, including stocks, bonds and
loans to consumers and businesses.
What led to these low prices?
Most financial market insiders
point to the tight-money policies of
the Federal Reserve as the cause. By
restricting the growth of the money
supply, the Fed has reduced the re
serves of banks. These banks are

among the major buyers of financial
assets (remember, when the bank
lends you money, it is just "buying
your bond," or promise to pay), so
tight money has reduced demand for
assets. Of course, reduced demand
leads to lower prices. At the same
time, this tight-money policy helps to
bring down inflation.
Further, the tax cuts which are so
important to Reagan's program have
produced a well-publicized deficit
problem, to which high interest rates
and mushrooming entitlement out
lays have contributed mightily. Since
the Fed no longer prints money to fi
nance the deficit, the Treasury must
borrow, selling government bonds in
the financial markets. This ever-in
creasing supply of bonds must lead to
lower prices.
Another major source of new
bonds has been widely overlooked.
Federal deregulation of the financial
markets has brought forth a flood of
new types of savings programs. To
day's average saver can choose from
a much wider variety of high-quality
plans.
One example is money market
funds, which were virtually nonexis
tent a few years ago. Today, banks
and brokerage houses are waging a
bloodthirsty battle for new deposits.
These money market funds have ex
panded by billions of dollars in each
of the last several months. Depositing
money in a fund is equivalent to
"buying a bond" from the institution
operating the fund, so this has in
creased the supply of bonds.
Since the various financial assets
are so interrelated, their prices tend
to move together on a broad basis.
Thus these supply-and-demand fac
tors have reduced prices across all
markets.
Reading the newspapers, though,
leads one to believe that financial

market expectations are all-impor
tant. Commentators from every band
of the political spectrum allege the
markets lack faith in Reagan's pro
gram, suggesting the program is a
failure. They cite the supply-side fac
tion, a singular group which believes
the program must work through ex
pectations.
This overlooks the fact that Reagan,
has consistently maintained tfie re-jj
covery will only come in the long
run, and in the short-run there will
be "pain and sacrifice." He has taken
this position ever since his first
speech on the economic plan, saying
that it will take years to get out of
"this mess."
Most participants in the financial"
markets, however, care only about 1
the short-run. Their expectations of
short-run pain and sacrifice lead de
mand for assets to be lower. Of
course, this short-run pessimism can
not be linked exclusively to Reagan's
program, in view of the collapsing
stock prices around the world.
In short, the Markets are not the
wise and detached arbiters of
mythology. The reality is that they
react rather than judge, and their
present depressed state results from
supply-and-demand factors. Further,
the gloomy expectations of today
arise out of the mad scramble for
short-run gain which characterizes
the world's financial dealings.
The Reagan program has its effect
in increasing the desire of individuals
to work harder, save and start busi
nesses, as well as leading to greater
investment by corporations which
look beyond the short-run. On that
fateful day when these factors exert
their influence, look for asset prices
to skyrocket.

The Reagan program has its effect
in increasing the desire of individuals
to work harder, save and start busi
nesses, as well as leading to greater
investment by corporations which
look beyond the short-run. On that
fateful day when these factors exert
their influence, look for asset prices
to skyrocket.

The Fates of Greek mvthology
spun a thread upon which hung ev
ery man's life. These three women, in
their cool, detached manner, passed
continual judgement on all, and their
displeasure resulted in immediate
extermination.
Our economic policymakers of to
day may seem to face a similar panel
of wise but pitiless judges. In place of
the Fates, though, sit the Markets,
known as Stock, Bond and Short
term Debt. According to some, the
Markets have passed judgement
against President Ronald Reagan's
economic program and have
snipped its lifeline through plunging
stock prices and high interest rates.
One cannot, however, view the
markets this way. They do not serve
as a "report card" on economic poli
cy. Rather, the present state of the fi
nancial markets reflects the complex
supply-and-demand relationships
which underlie them; driven, of
course, by übiquitous economic self
interest.

To beg t with, we must note that
high interest rates are equivalent to
low bond prices. When bonds are is
sued, they have a fixed price (say,
$1000 per bond) and a fixed interest
rate (say, 10 percent). If the market
rate is at 15 percent, though, no one
would want to buy the bonds at 10
percent.
What the market does is allow the
$1000 price to be bid down, say to
$750, to compensate the bond buyers
for the low interest rate. Thus if the
market interest rate rises from 10 per
cent to 15 percent, bond prices must
fall, by $250 in our example.
The problem today is therefore
one of low prices for all financial as
sets, including stocks, bonds and
loans to consumers and businesses.
What led to these low prices?
Most financial market insiders
point to the tight-money policies of
the Federal Reserve as the cause. By
restricting the growth of the money
supply, the Fed has reduced the re
serves of banks. These banks are

among the major buyers of financial
assets (remember, when the bank
lends you money, it is just "buying
your bond," or promise to pay), so
tight money has reduced demand for
assets. Of course, reduced demand
leads to lower prices. At the same
time, this tight-money policy helps to
bring down inflation.
Further, the tax cuts which are so
important to Reagan's program have
produced a well-publicized deficit
problem, to which high interest rates
and mushrooming entitlement out
lays have contributed mightily. Since
the Fed no longer prints money to fi
nance the deficit, the Treasury must
borrow, selling government bonds in
the financial markets. This ever-in
creasing supply of bonds must lead to
lower prices.
Another major source of new
bonds has been widely overlooked.
Federal deregulation of the financial
markets has brought forth a flood of
new types of savings programs. To
day's average saver can choose from
a much wider variety of high-quality
plans.
One example is money market
funds, which were virtually nonexis
tent a few years ago. Today, banks
and brokerage houses are waging a
bloodthirsty battle for new deposits.
These money market funds have ex
panded by billions of dollars in each
of the last several months. Depositing
money in a fund is equivalent to
"buying a bond" from the institution
operating the fund, so this has in
creased the supply of bonds.
Since the various financial assets
are so interrelated, their prices tend
to move together on a broad basis.
Thus these supply-and-demand fac
tors have reduced prices across all
markets.
Reading the newspapers, though,
leads one to believe that financial

market expectations are all-impor
tant. Commentators from every band
of the political spectrum allege the
markets lack faith in Reagan's pro
gram, suggesting the program is a
failure. They cite the supply-side fac
tion, a singular group which believes
the program must work through ex
pectations.
This overlooks the fact that Reagan,
has consistently maintained tfie re-jj
covery will only come in the long
run, and in the short-run there will
be "pain and sacrifice." He has taken
this position ever since his first
speech on the economic plan, saying
that it will take years to get out of
"this mess."
Most participants in the financial"
markets, however, care only about 1
the short-run. Their expectations of
short-run pain and sacrifice lead de
mand for assets to be lower. Of
course, this short-run pessimism can
not be linked exclusively to Reagan's
program, in view of the collapsing
stock prices around the world.
In short, the Markets are not the
wise and detached arbiters of
mythology. The reality is that they
react rather than judge, and their
present depressed state results from
supply-and-demand factors. Further,
the gloomy expectations of today
arise out of the mad scramble for
short-run gain which characterizes
the world's financial dealings.
