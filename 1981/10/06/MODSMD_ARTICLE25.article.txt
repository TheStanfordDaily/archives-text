## The 						Movies Peter Weir'sbloodless reign of terror 
### Steve Vineberg 
For the first hour and a quar
ter, Peter Weir's Gallipoli is a
boys' adventure in the spirit of
the old Din, though
considerably less exciting and
more high-minded about its
hail-fellow-well-met fighting
male elitism. The time is spring
of 1915; the two young men of
screenwriter David Williams
on's story, Frank Dunne (Mel
Gibson) and Archy Hamilton
(Mark Lee), meet as com
petitors in a race and become
friends. An Australian regi
ment has distinguished itself
among British troops at
Gallipoli, and stirred by their
compatriots' bravery, scores of
young Australians are signing
up to sail over to fight the Turks
there.
Archy, lying about his age,
places himself inthe midst of
these fresh-faced soldiers. A
combination of his buddy's en
thusiasm and the romantic pas
sion of the war currently catch
ing fire in the hearts of Austral
ians sends the more reluctant
Frank off to battle, too, and
both boys turn up in the Light
Horse cavalry unit.
This lengthy first section of
the film has its pleasures. Weir
handles the crowd scenes
gracefully, and Russell Boyd
shoots the glorious exteriors
with such clarity that the home
scenes and the scenes in Cairo,
where the soldiers undergo
training, attain the grandeur of
enormous canvasses (one shot
of the two heroes tramping
across a white-hot desert might
be an impressionist's represen
tation of Waiting for Godot).

The actors share a certain ju
venile charm, though Mel
Gibson appears easily the more
talented of the two, and the
more interesting camera sub
ject. Mark Lee's fair, Michael
York looks and youthful smile
are not as sustaining as
Gibson's darker, more intense
presence, and Gibson has
some comic style.
You can see in the prewar
scenes where Weir is headed
— he wants to establish a hap
py, serene mood with this
eclectic rites-of-manhood ma-

We can see what Peter Weir wants us to feel in Gallipoli —
horror, pity for the wasted young lives — but we don't
actually feel anything but admiration for his meticulous
technique. It's like that embarrassing moment in Barry
Lyndonwhen Stanley Kubrick stages a battle so pretty that
instead of becoming caught up in it, we think of
Gainsborough paintings.
Jfijpou

terial about the shared ex
periences of boys barely out of
high school, and then present
the jarring contrast of the war
which robs them of their
youth.
Visually, Weir and Boyd
switch gears as soon as tne
troops depart for Gallipoli —
the pastels of the desert give
way to smoky blue dusk, il
luminated by sudden flares and
searchlights. Young men swim
ming naked off the shore
watch bullets weave through
the water; Weir has chosen a
slightly surreal style for the

boys' first foray into the Great
War.
But something is wrong. We
can see what Weir wants us to
feel — horror, pity for the
wasted young lives — but we
don't actually feel anything but
admiration for Weir's
meticulous technique. It's like

Kubrick stages a battle so pretty

Kubrick may have had some

thing in mind other than show

Weir clearly intends just that,
and his wrongheaded ap
proach is puzzling.
Peter Weir is a strange direc

lacks passion. In The Last Wave,
he was so busy filming magnif

that he let his real subject mat

forebodings gave rise to the
opaque, silly plot.
He misses the real movie in
Gallipoli, too. We don't actual
ly see the battle except in
isolated shots of running
youths being shot down by the
Turks whom they have been
sent to distract while British re
inforcements edge their way
toward Constantinople. Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of
the dead and the wounded and
the despairing; at one point,
they parade by and one thinks

If there is a rule of thumb in
war movies, it must be that you
can't communicate the tragedy
of war without offering a taste
of its excitement — in other
words, drawing us in. D. W

We can see what Peter Weir wants us to feel in Gallipoli —
horror, pity for the wasted young lives — but we don't

Archaeologist foe fackson and his "new"style.

For the first hour and a quar
ter, Peter Weir's Gallipoli is a
boys' adventure in the spirit of
the old Din, though
considerably less exciting and
more high-minded about its
hail-fellow-well-met fighting
male elitism. The time is spring
of 1915; the two young men of
screenwriter David Williams
on's story, Frank Dunne (Mel
Gibson) and Archy Hamilton
(Mark Lee), meet as com
petitors in a race and become
friends. An Australian regi
ment has distinguished itself
among British troops at
Gallipoli, and stirred by their
compatriots' bravery, scores of
young Australians are signing
up to sail over to fight the Turks
there.
Archy, lying about his age,
places himself inthe midst of
these fresh-faced soldiers. A
combination of his buddy's en
thusiasm and the romantic pas
sion of the war currently catch
ing fire in the hearts of Austral
ians sends the more reluctant
Frank off to battle, too, and
both boys turn up in the Light
Horse cavalry unit.
This lengthy first section of
the film has its pleasures. Weir
handles the crowd scenes
gracefully, and Russell Boyd
shoots the glorious exteriors
with such clarity that the home
scenes and the scenes in Cairo,
where the soldiers undergo
training, attain the grandeur of
enormous canvasses (one shot
of the two heroes tramping
across a white-hot desert might
be an impressionist's represen
tation of Waiting for Godot).

The actors share a certain ju
venile charm, though Mel
Gibson appears easily the more
talented of the two, and the
more interesting camera sub
ject. Mark Lee's fair, Michael
York looks and youthful smile
are not as sustaining as
Gibson's darker, more intense
presence, and Gibson has
some comic style.
