Okay all you hep cats and
jive-diggers out there in sw
ingland, how many of you re
member the great Louis Jor
dan, "king of the jukeboxes?"
How about Lester Young?
Come on now, we've all been
big fans of Cab Calloway or
Glenn Miller at one time or an
other, right?
Well, don't feel too square,
these jazz greats have actually
not been near the top 40 since
the era of The Big War â€” until
now. Joe Jackson, former pop
new wave semi-artist, has re
cently taken a dive into the past
and come up with an album
called Joe Jackson's Jumpin'
Jive.
Jumpin' Jive is not a great
album by any standards. The
tunes themselves are musically
simple and straightforward,
with mildly entertaining lyrics
(much of the entertainment
deriving from frequent use of
40's jazz slang). Jackson and his
musicians obviously know
their stuff, and they do an ex
cellent job of playing authentic
sounding 40's jazz, but some
thing is missing. The backbeat
is there, the trumpet riffs are
there, Jackson's vocals are
almost there, but still the music
doesn't satisfy.
First of all let's remember
that forties jazz is dead, and
theie are very few people to
day who regret that fact. Great
music doesn't die; music which
loses the interest of its listeners
and performers does. 40's jazz
had its day, but American soci
ety has come a long way since
WWII. T his music no longer has
any value for the majority of its
potential listeners, apart from a
possible slight nostalgic worth
(although most of us can hardly
claim to have any fond memo
ries of those good ole days).
In spite of the irrelevance of
the original music, Jackson
might have come up with a
much better album if he had

done something new and excit
ing, instead of simply reviving
the songs in their original form.
Show me the person who is
bored or totally unimpressed
with George Thorogood. But
his music isn't original and ex
citing; he just digs up old, ob
scure tunes, and makes people
like them, because people like
him. George Thorogood is ex
citing and fun to listen to, but
Joe Jackson just sings. Even Ella
Fitzgerald is still allowed to do
her thing on the tube for Mem
orex, because she's got a voice.
Joe Jackson can sing, but then
so can everybody and their
grandmother.
But although Jumpin' Jive
may have its shortcomings, Joe
Jackson must be given credit
where credit is due: This album
is different from anything else
which has been put out in the
past 30 years, and it is fun to lis
ten to.
Jumpin' Jive is a tribute to
some talented artists who un
doubtedly deserved more rec
ognition than they ever re
ceived. While their songs could
not be called lasting classics,
this whole style of music con
tributed a great deal to the de
velopment of the early forms of
rock 'n' roll. Besides, Jackson
does us all a great favor by giv
ing some relief from the cons
tant barrage of trash which is
thrown at us by the major rec
ording companies.
Jumpin' Jive is not a hard
album to get into, nor is it ac
cessible only to certain strange
types of people. This is an
album of good-time music, to
be enjoyed by all. The music on
Jumpin' Jive can be compared
to a Gilligan's Island in the
midst of a puke-green sea of
sickeningly insincere songs
about "my baby whom I can't
live without boo hoo hoo" or
"gonna get down and party
and party tonight man, see how
bad I am." So next time you
feel alienated by Foreigner and
April Wine starts to taste like
sour grapes, take this cat's ad
vice and "reap this righteous
riff."
