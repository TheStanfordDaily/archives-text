### Scott Silveira 
In Continental Divide John
Belushi jettisons his inspired
lunatic persona in an attempt at
light romantic comedy. Al
though his best moments recall
zany skits from Saturday Night
Live, he is surprisingly convinc
ing throughout; only short
comings in writing and direc
tion prevent Continental
Divide from being a complete
success.
Belushi plays hard-bitten
Chicago newspaper reporter
Ernie Souchak, whose exposes
of a corrupt pol cause so much
controversy that his editor (Al
len Goorwitz) is compelled to

get him out of town on another
story. Souchak unwillingly
travels to the Wyoming Rock
ies to interview Nell Porter
(Blair Brown) whose research
on bald eagles has been under
publicized. Souchak hates
mountains, eagles, and one
supposes, women; Porter hates
cities, humans, and in particu
lar, reporters. Naturally, the
two fall in love, if for no other
reason than because Ernie and
Nell have seen this kind of
movie countless times before.
Belushi, however, makes this
film come alive once too many

times for such a cursory dis
missal. He is a natural as a slop
py newspaperman and de
lightfully an unnatural as a
mountain climber — almost,
but not quite, making you
forget the samurai and frat-rat
stuff. He manipulates his
droopy eyes and broad,
cavernous, ugly mouth very
skillfully, a bit like Walter Mat
thau, and the bulk of his one
liners (supplied by
screenwriter Lawrence
Kasdan) hit home; the ones
that don't are inoffensive and
easily forgotten (in contrast to
1941 and The Blues Brothers).
Although the romantic materi-

al is less humorous and rather
predictable, he maintains his
sureness and confidence.
Belushi, unfortunately, is
one of the few who shine for
the entire picture. Director
Michael Apted uses short,
pithy scenes to complement
the short, pithy jokes of the
movie's first hour, but loses
focus in the last thirty minutes.
This shift is ignominously her
alded with a cut from a
hilarious scene in which
Belushi is shown partially
shredded by a mountain lion to
a love scene featuring our now

unblemished hero. Not only
that, but the love scene is
almost a word-for-word repeti
tion of the Harrison Ford-
Karen Allen dialogue in Raid
ers of the Lost Ark, which
Kasdan also wrote. While it's

hard to argue with success, this
backwoods cosmetic surgery
makes everything in the scene
phony.
From this point on, the film
never fully recovers its earlier
charm. If you're looking for a
scapegoat (and I am) it's easy to
blame Belushi, since he's no
body's idea of a leading man
unless you think bowling balls
are sexy, or perhaps Brown,
who is pretty and plays a good
foil for Belushi's humor but ap
pears truly passionate only
toward her eagles. It's also easy
to blame Apted, who has had a
long history of directing con
fusing, unfathomable ro
mances (like Sissy Spacek and
Tommy Lee Jones in the other
wise laudable Coal Miner's
Daughter).
However, it's easiest to find
fault with Lawrence Kasdan for
devising characters that are far

more interesting when they
argue than when they make
love. Since the guy refuses to
go back to the hills (even
though he learned to like
eagles) and the girl refuses to
stay in the city (except for a lit
tle of Iter much-abhorred pub
licity), the movie searches for
nearly twenty minutes for a
compromise that doesn't exist.
It's hard to believe that people
so desperately in love fail at
even a pretense of com

promise. Kasdan could have
thought that Belushi could
joke his way out of this part of
his script, but the conclusion is
curiously unsatisfying — a little
like chocolate chip cookies
without the milk.
Continental Divide is best
passed off with such a
metaphor. As a comedy, it is
very entertaining; as a ro
mance, it just doesn't wash.
This makes the movie worth
seeing — but just barely.

movie's first hour, but loses
focus in the last thirty minutes.
This shift is ignominously her
alded with a cut from a
hilarious scene in which
Belushi is shown partially
shredded by a mountain lion to
a love scene featuring our now

unblemished hero. Not only
that, but the love scene is
almost a word-for-word repeti
tion of the Harrison Ford-
Karen Allen dialogue in Raid
ers of the Lost Ark, which
Kasdan also wrote. While it's

hard to argue with success, this
backwoods cosmetic surgery
makes everything in the scene
phony.
From this point on, the film
never fully recovers its earlier
charm. If you're looking for a
scapegoat (and I am) it's easy to
blame Belushi, since he's no
body's idea of a leading man
unless you think bowling balls
are sexy, or perhaps Brown,
who is pretty and plays a good
foil for Belushi's humor but ap
pears truly passionate only
toward her eagles. It's also easy
to blame Apted, who has had a
long history of directing con
fusing, unfathomable ro
mances (like Sissy Spacek and
Tommy Lee Jones in the other
wise laudable Coal Miner's
Daughter).
However, it's easiest to find
fault with Lawrence Kasdan for
devising characters that are far

more interesting when they
argue than when they make
love. Since the guy refuses to
go back to the hills (even
though he learned to like
eagles) and the girl refuses to
stay in the city (except for a lit
tle of Iter much-abhorred pub
licity), the movie searches for
nearly twenty minutes for a
compromise that doesn't exist.
It's hard to believe that people
so desperately in love fail at
even a pretense of com

promise. Kasdan could have
thought that Belushi could
joke his way out of this part of
his script, but the conclusion is
curiously unsatisfying — a little
like chocolate chip cookies
without the milk.
Continental Divide is best
passed off with such a
metaphor. As a comedy, it is
very entertaining; as a ro
mance, it just doesn't wash.
This makes the movie worth
seeing — but just barely.

In Continental Divide John
Belushi jettisons his inspired
lunatic persona in an attempt at
light romantic comedy. Al
though his best moments recall
zany skits from Saturday Night
Live, he is surprisingly convinc
ing throughout; only short
comings in writing and direc
tion prevent Continental
Divide from being a complete
success.
Belushi plays hard-bitten
Chicago newspaper reporter
Ernie Souchak, whose exposes
of a corrupt pol cause so much
controversy that his editor (Al
len Goorwitz) is compelled to

get him out of town on another
story. Souchak unwillingly
travels to the Wyoming Rock
ies to interview Nell Porter
(Blair Brown) whose research
on bald eagles has been under
publicized. Souchak hates
mountains, eagles, and one
supposes, women; Porter hates
cities, humans, and in particu
lar, reporters. Naturally, the
two fall in love, if for no other
reason than because Ernie and
Nell have seen this kind of
movie countless times before.
Belushi, however, makes this
film come alive once too many

times for such a cursory dis
missal. He is a natural as a slop
py newspaperman and de
lightfully an unnatural as a
mountain climber — almost,
but not quite, making you
forget the samurai and frat-rat
stuff. He manipulates his
droopy eyes and broad,
cavernous, ugly mouth very
skillfully, a bit like Walter Mat
thau, and the bulk of his one
liners (supplied by
screenwriter Lawrence
Kasdan) hit home; the ones
that don't are inoffensive and
easily forgotten (in contrast to
1941 and The Blues Brothers).
Although the romantic materi-

al is less humorous and rather
predictable, he maintains his
sureness and confidence.
Belushi, unfortunately, is
one of the few who shine for
the entire picture. Director
Michael Apted uses short,
pithy scenes to complement
the short, pithy jokes of the
movie's first hour, but loses
focus in the last thirty minutes.
This shift is ignominously her
alded with a cut from a

Belushi is shown partially
