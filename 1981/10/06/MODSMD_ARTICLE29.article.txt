# Sanity and survival in the woofer- tweeter jungle
## 
### Jim Elfers 
So you've fattened up the university's cof
fers by paying off tuition, room, and board.
If, to your surprise, you find yourself with
something left over, you may be mulling
over how to dispense with it. Having quickly
done away with the options of saving it,
buying textbooks, giving it to charity, or
graciously sending it back to Mom and Pop
with a "Thanks but I don't need this" note,
you've narrowed your choices down to the
following: Clothes, bicycle tubes, recrea
tional pharmaceuticals, or a stereo.
If you're a blossoming young prep or a
prep/jock (aka Phi Delt) then the clothing is
the obvious choice. If you're an ex-scout or a
sado-masochist (try it with the air nozzle fac
ing out) then the bike tubes are for you. And,
as California's largest cash crop is coming
into season, you might find the third selec
tion to be most timely. But if you've singled
out or are thinking about a stereo purchase,
read on.
This article will attempt to give the reader
enough basic knowledge about stereo and
the components thereof to enable him or
her to make an intelligent stereo purchase. It
is oriented toward the neophyte and as
sumes that the reader doesn't know the dif
ference between a distorted figure and the
figure of a cheerleader. And as for the price
range of the systems mentioned, I'll be esti
mating that most students can come up with
at least $300 but few will want to spend more
than $1000 for their components.
With that in mind, let's consider some of
the parameters most often applied in choos
ing a stereo system.
Ignoring for the moment the ultimate de
cision-maker — price — one of the first
questions to ask yourself is this: How much
do you listen to music and what kind of a lis
tener are you? The first half of that question
is answered readily enough but the latter
half deserves some explanation. If you play
tunes for the sake of having something in the
background while you study, or if in a pinch
you've used some of your records as frisbee
substitutes, then you fall into the "not really
that intense about superb sound" category.
On the other hand if you feel a searing pain
every time you hear a pop or scratch on one
of your 571 albums, or if you'd rather use
next quarter's laundry money to get a fourth
pair of speakers with built-in spectrorgasmic
equalizers, then you're one of the "fidelity
first and foremost" breed. Most students can
classify themselves somewhere in between
these two extremes.
Perhaps I should warn the reader that my
conscience does not allow me to even both
er talking about what I consider to be junk.
Thus, while I won't be dealing with what's
known as "high end" stereo, anything I do
recommend will be components of reason
able quality. Thankfully there are inex
pensive yet decent-sounding items on the
market, as shall be pointed out. So, knowing
how often you listen to music and how seri
ous you are about it, and the direction in
which I'll be slanting you, think about the

following factors that are most likely to affect
a student's choice of a suitable stereo set-up.
Crankability
At the stereo store where I work one of the
first questions I'm asked by any male under
30 is "How many watts can it put out?"To be
gin with, I should mention that the term
"watt(s)" applies to the power output of any
stereo amplifier. Thus the more watts an
amplifier has, the louder it can play your
Meat Loaf, Moody Blues, or Mozart.
Many people make the mistake of cor
relating watts with signal quality, thinking
that the more watts an amplifier has, the bet
ter it will sound. In reality the only way in
which having more watts will mean purer
sound is this: A 20 watt amplifier driven at
(i.e. played at a power output of) 18 will be
on the verge of "distorting" (degrading the
sound quality of the music), whereas a 50

watt amplifier driven at 18 watts will not be
pushing its power threshold, and in effect
will souhd cleaner.
For most dorm or bedroom applications, I
don't see why 20 or even 15 watts of power
wouldn't suffice, and even if you're using
your system for an occasional party there is
no need for more than 60 or 70 watts. Also,
more watts means more wampum, so unless
you're one of those beasts that like to feel
your music rattle your body and your neigh
bor's walls instead of merely listening to it,
there's no real need to go crazy with watts.
Portability
Also known as dormability, this aspect of a
stereo is one that is particularly important for
students. Nothing is more of a hassle to move
and store than an overly large stereo system.
Moreover, there is no need to have a physi
cally huge set of components to achieve nice
sound, and in fact there is currently a trend
toward mini-sized systems. Ergo, in selecting
a system that's right for you, there's no need

to go overboard in the size department.
Portability should not be the first thing you
check for when you go shopping for a system
but it should be in the back of your mind,
particularly if you can't decide between two
similar sounding systems. Regretfully
portability ties in badly with other considera
tions, that of. . .
Theftability
Obviously any stereo that's easy for you to
haul around is also going to be a breeze for a
thief. Happily, there are a variety of easy
ways to avoid having your investmentstolen,
but unhappily they are often neglected.
Last year a guy in my dorm had a pretty fair
system, and would leave his door wide open,
often with the stereo on, for hours on end
while he was elsewhere. He still owned it at
theend of the year. A friend inanotherdorm
also had some good stuff, and locked his

door every time he left, but found his stereo
gone one evening after a burglar made use
of an open window.
Of course when you go out and buy a sys
tem there's not much to do at that point in
terms of preventing its getting taken. But, af
ter the purchase, there are some steps that
can and should be taken. The simplest, yet
most ignored, procedure is that of locking
your door every single time you're out of the
room. It's a pain, and easy to blow off, but
when you consider that the only item more
burglarized on campus than stereo compo
nents is bicycles, you'd best go ahead and
take the time to lock your doorand windows
before heading to that Daquiri Social.
Some other possibilities include hiding
your components under the bed or in the
cabinet (preferably one that can be locked),
or devising a way to chain down your equip
ment to something difficult to move, such as
your desk, a Food Service entree, or a stray
elephant. The hardest component to con

ceal and yet still have handy is the turntable,
followed closely by speakers. But more on
what to do about that in another article. For
now, keep the above common sense sugges
tions in mind and don't advertise your sys
tem. The temptation to brag about your 500
watt fuel-injected system may be great, but
that temptation will be even greater for a
potential thief who hears about it.
Quality and Clarity
These to me are the two most important
areas to look into no matter what the com
ponent. Finding the first elusive character
istic, quality, can be confusing and difficult.
But as for the clarity of a given component,
whether it be a receiver, speaker, or turn
table, things are actually a little easier.
Years ago, the first thing a knowledgeable
buyer would check for would be a receiver
with a low harmonicdistortion rating. All this

boils down to is a receiver (which is just an
amplifier combined with a radio tuner) that
amplifies that signal. So, a good receiver has
a low THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) rat
ing.
But one hardly has to bother with check
ing the distortin specs on a receiver these
days. In recent years the electronics industry
has far surpassed the point where the human
ear can detect distortion. Thus, to a certain
degree, a $200 receiver will sound as clean as
a $600 competitor.
The difference will probably be in power
(watts), quality/workmanship, features, and
gadgets. I separate the last two because there
is a big difference between a genuinely use
ful feature and a gadget that uses a digital
readout to tell you the next time Haley's
Comet will be by. Don't let a salesman tell
you one receiver is better than another be
cause one has a .05 percent THD rating and
the other has a 0.7 percent rating. The hu
man ear can't hear distortion that is less than

one percent, so it's all overkill anyway.
Now that I've let myself wax somewhat
technical, we turn to the angle of quality,
which is not something that readily translates
itself into numbers and specifications. One
thing to look for in a component is the man
ufacturer's service record. How often do
components made by that company have to
come back in for repair? You can find this
out by calling up an authorized service cen
ter for that product or by checking a con
sumer magazine. Also, see how long the
warranty is and what it covers.
Don't trust a salesman outright for these
answers. They are notorious for telling white
lies and then pleading a sudden memory
lapse when a customer has bought some
thing asks why the warranty is only six
months when he was told six years. See it on
paper.
Some other notes on quality. Don't ignore
a product just because you've never heard of
the manufacturer, and don't buy a product
just because you've seen it heavily ad
vertised. Be wary of both situations and
check out the item in question with an open
mind. If you own or have owned something
by that manufacturer and enjoyed it then use
that experience to help you make a decision.
Most importantly, don't buy something
just because it has enough lights, toggles,
bells, and shiny things to make a 747 pilot en
vious. Cosmetics should be the last thing on
your mind, but the Japanese are good
enough capitalists to know that it's exactly
these things that sell the majority of their
components. People buy for looks and
gadgets ("Look Harold, this one even comes
with a built-in toaster oven!"), but avoid bas
ing your purchase on this alone. At any rate
there's plenty of stuff on the market that
sounds and looks sharp.
Lastly, if you get an opportunity to do a
hands-on check of the items you're looking
at, you can do a little quality testing on your
own. If it's a receiver, do the control knobs
look out of alignment or is there a lot of fric
tion when you turn them? Is the cabinet
made out plastic or the preferred metal?
Does the tuning knob feel solid and does it
rotate smoothly up and down the scale?
With speakers, see if the drivers (those
round things under the grille that vibrate)
are made of a rigid heavy paper, or if it looks
like one good poke would put your finger
through. Is the speaker heavy enough (com
pare with others) to suggest that the magnets
inside are adequately large? Most important
ly, if it's possible, give a bunch of speakers a
listening test with a favorite recording and
see which you like. If you're into jazz, some
speakers sound crisper than others, some
sound richer. Some sound like the mating
call of a mule. Trust your ears. After all,
you're the one that's going to have to live
with the system for years to come, not the
salesman,
(In the Thursday Daily, I'll continue with a
more detailed look at certain components
and some recommendations on specific
makes and models.)
