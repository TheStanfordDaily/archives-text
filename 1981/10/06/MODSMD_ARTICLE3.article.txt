# Ribbons, book fund highlight Sandra's day
## 
### Cici Oremland 
It was a day of pride and celebra
tion at the Law School yesterday, as
students heralded alumna Sandra
Day O'Connor's first day on the job
at the Supreme Court.
Although O'Connor is not the first
Stanford graduate to take a seat on
the nation's highest bench (that hon
or belongs to her classmate and fel
low Justice William Rehnquist), she is
the first woman.
To commemorate the occasion,
law students here wore red, white
and blue ribbons, and raised about
$200 for a Law School library fund.
"We're proud of her appointment
and we're proud of her being a Stan
ford alumna," said Kenta Duffey, one
of three students who organized the
day's events.
The organizers distributed about
300 ribbons to a generally en
thusiastic crowd of faculty and stu
dents. Law Prof, and constitutional
scholar Gerald Gunther wore a rib
bon. to his constitutional law class,
and urged his students to do the
same. Gunther also pledged his sup
port to the one-dollar-a-student

book acquisition fund drive.
Day commemorated
Books purchased through the fund
will bear commemorative seals on
the inside covers.
While most law students seemed to
take delight in honoring the rise of
one of their own, some said they be
lieve it is too early to celebrate
O'Connor's appointment, since she
has yet to hand down a decision.
Said one ribbon-clad second year
student, Dena Boldblum, "I have a
lot to say (about the appointment)
but I'm withholding my opinion until
after I can see her as a Supreme Court
justice."
Some mixed reactions
Another second-year student,
Bernie Burk, also wearing a ribbon,
said it was counterproductive and
sexist to celebrate a woman's ap
pointment because a justice should
be impartial. But he said he wore the
ribbon and made a donation as a
good excuse to aid the libarary.
One first-year student, who asked
not to be named, expressed caution,
saying "I'll wait to see if she's a good
judge before I wear a ribbon."
