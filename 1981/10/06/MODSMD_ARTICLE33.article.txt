### Jim Lico Al Jarreau Breakin' Away 
Warner Bros. Records
Sitting in the deep-freeze
of the local McDonald's,
feeling the grease from the
half-eaten bag of "french
fries" slowly congeal in my
arteries, I idly wondered
what I could say about Al
Jarreau's latest album,
Breakin' Away, aside from
simply that it's another ex
cellent album, like last
year's This Time.
Just what is Al breakin'
away from? Certainly not
the well polished and pro
duced sound that was so
well developed on the This
Time LP. Breakin' Away is
equally clean, well rec
orded, and acoustically bal
anced, and features many of
the same fine studio musi
cians who have given Jar
reau's music such a highly
identifiable and appealing
sound.
Steve Gadd, widely rec
ognized as one of the best
drummers for hire in the
business, is back on this
album, and his incredible
technical expertise is highly
evident here, as well as his
consummate musicianship.
Gadd gets his licks into
Breakin' Away without ov
erplaying the songs or at
tracting undue attention to
himself. In addition, stylistic
chameleon Abe Laboriel
provides a bass presence
which he and Gadd build on
to give the music its intense
forward motion.
Upon this rock-solid mu
sical foundation, a bevy of
talented keyboard players,
including Larry Fast and
Michaels Boddicker and

Omartian fill out the songs,
complemented by a fine
horn section. George Duke
makes a tasty appearance on
"We're in This Love Togeth
er". Jan Graydon handles
much of the guitar work, as
well as the album's engi
neering duties. Graydon is
to be congratulated for the
clarity of Breakin' Away —
the instruments are in ex
cellent balance, and Jar
reau's voice is given the mu
sical room it needs and de
serves.
And Jarreau is at his best
on this album, his voice
ranging from the smooth
and sensuous to the sharp
and precisely articulated —
whatever the spirit of the
music demands. One of the
most pleasurable things
about listening to Jarreau is
the kind of abstract quality
of "joy" that pervades his
music. You get the feeling
that Jarreau, and all the oth

er musicians as well, really
enjoy what they're playing.
There's a lot of coopera
tion on Breakin' Away be
tween these musicians.
They play with each other —
trading rhythmic ideas, set
ting one another up for
solos, and giving each other
plenty of room to play in.
The result is in a full sound
that isn't crowded, even on
"Blue Rondo a la Turk", a
lyricized Dave Brubeck old
ie and the one song that
doesn't really fit with the
rest of the album.
All things considered, this
album is a good follow-up
to This Time; if you liked
that one, you'll likethisone.
Most of the songs on the
album are just plain fun —
put one on and you get a
hand clappin', finger snap
pin', toe tappin' feelin'. Re
ally. Honest. Well, at least I
did.
