Haig tries to save AWACS
Washington — In a furious attempt to
salvage an $8.5 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia, Secretary of State Alexander Haig
charged opponents with "illusions ... ir
responsible in the extreme" Monday while
President Ronald Reagan unveiled support
from six previous administrations.
Haig, in testimony to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, personally assailed
Democrat John Glenn of Ohio for what he
termed the "imaginary" claim that a com
promise could be worked out calling for
joint U.S.-Saudi manning of the five AWACS
radar planes at the heart of the sale.
The president, meanwhile, assembled 16
defense and foreign-policy officials from
Washington's past for a White House dis
play of bipartisan support. The officials in
cluded former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer, who served presidents Nixon and
Ford, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, President
Jimmy Carter's national security adviser.
Reagan read a joint statement by his
guests which declared that "the sale of
AWACS and other air defense equipment to
Saudi Arabia would make a substantial con
tribution to the national security interests of
the United States in a vital part of the
world."
Reagan's quest to turn around an ob
viously skeptical Congress also included
summoning every Republican member of
the Senate to the White House for meetings
on the issue today.
"The question is whether we will have
enough time," Haig said, "for time is not
necessarily on our side in the Middle East.
CIA secrecy bill drawn up
Washington — A draft presidential order
would allow the CIA to infiltrate domestic
groups and, with the attorney general's ap
proval, secretly influence their activities,
government sources said yesterday.
The document is the third draft of a re
vised executive order which the Reagan ad
ministration has sent to Capitol Hill. It
would replace guidelines issued by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in January 1978 to govern
the conduct of U.S. intelligence agencies.
Sources inside and outside the govern
ment said the order also would:
— Remove prohibitions against the ClA's
conducting "special activities," or covert
actions, inside the United States, if they are
not intended to influence U.S. policies or
politics;
— Strike the requirement that in
telligence agents reasonably believe that
U.S. citizens and corporations abroad are
agents of a foreign power or involved in ter
rorism or drug traffic before they can be put
under physical surveillance; and
— Retain bans on assassinations, on CIA
electronic surveillance in the United States
and on CIA break-ins in this country.
Sen. Harrison Schmitt (R-N.M.), chairman
of the Senate Intelligence subcommittee on
Rights of Americans, said the Justice De
partment refused on yesterday to give on
the-record testimony on the interpretation
of the draft order at a closed hearing.
Justice Department spokeswoman
Marina Picciotto had no comment. But an
administration source, citing the principle
of separation of powers, said Reagan of
ficials were reluctant to create a legislative
record on an executive branch action.
Tempers flare in Poland
Gdansk, Poland — The Polish govern
ment has gone ahead with its planned price
increases of cigarettes in spite of a warning
by the Solidarity trade union that the rise
would cause "trouble throughout the coun
try."
Solidarity's national chairman, Lech
Walesa, told two government ministers yes
terday that they should telephone the
prime minister and cancel the increases.
Otherwise, there would be trouble "which
you will not be able to control, but we will,"
Walesa said.

The dispute started Saturday evening with
an announcement on national television
that cigarettes would roughly double in
price. After two hours of angry debate the
congress appointed a committee to look
into the issue.
Even after this safety valve was opened,
tempers were hot. Solidarity's leadership
called on delegates to stand up for a mo
ment's silence in honor of one of the coun
try's oldest and most distinguished his
torians. The professor's death had been
known since morning, but the summons to
a moment's silence had the effect of cooling
everything down. The session adjourned
with the singing of the national anthem.
On Sunday morning, however, delegates
began to get word of anger back home in
their various regions. Walesa sent a tele
gram to the prime minister, Gen. Wojciech
jaruzelski, urging an immediate delay in the
price rise and saying that Solidarity had nev
er accepted it.
Defense has doubts on MX
Washington — The chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff said yesterday the chiefs were
not consulted in advance on "the details" of
President Ronald Reagan's new strategic
weapons program, and that he continues to
have douDts about the key proposal to put
the first 36 MX missiles into newly hardened
Titan missile silos.
Gen. David Jones, the chairman, said he
still personally thinks the MXs would be vul
nerable in fixed positions and would rather
make the new missiles mobile, moving
them constantly among a number of sites to
protect them.
Jones said the chiefs would not fight the
president's proposals now that they have
been made. Even so, his testimony will be
useful to critics of the president's plan,
which ran into some heavy going in its first
day on Capitol Hill yesterday.
"We did not have an opportunity to go
over the package in detail before it was an
nounced," Jones told the Senate Armed
Services Committee during its first hearing
on the president's proposals.
But in a second session later in the day he
said of the mobile MX missile idea, "I'm not
trying to resurrect it. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
will support the decision of the commander
in chief."
Jones' carefully worded testimony ap
peared to rule out any major rebellion by
the chiefs against the president's plan to
substitute MX for Titan missiles after re
building the old silos.
"I had plenty of opportunity to express
my views on the package," Jones said in re
ferring to the months of discussion before
the blueprint was put in final form. He said
he was unable to convince the president
and the secretary of defense that rotating
from 100 to 200 MX missiles among 1000 to
4600 concrete shelters in Western states
would protect the MXs against Soviet attack
in the coming years.
EPA laws may be relaxed
Washington — Seven years after Con
gress and the Environmental Protection
Agency ordered refiners to reduce the
amount of lead in the gasoline they pro
duce, the old debate over these rules is
being recycled — with a new twist. Oppo
nents now say the rules have done their job
and can be safely jettisoned in the interests
of profit and productivity.
The debate reopened in August, when
Vice President George Bush targeted the
rules for review, citing the expensive tech
nological burden they will impose on small
refineries, starting next year. Larger re
finers, knowing the review could lead to the
rules' elimination, have joined the chorus
against them. Changes may be made in the
next few months.
Now that more than half of the nation's
gasoline supply is unleaded, the issue for
large refiners is how much lead the other
half may contain. Allowing higher lead
levels reduces larger refiners' production

costs. Small refiners, about to lose their ex
emption from the rule's most stringent pro
visions, want to avoid investing millions in
new machinery. Environmentalists still
argue that airborne lead can impair the
health and learning ability of children, par
ticularly in congested urban areas.
Lead has been used in gasoline for years
as a quick and cheap means of raising oc
tane levels, increasing fuel efficiency and
keeping engines from knocking. And it has
long been known both that lead is
poisonous, and that many inner-city chil
dren have excessive amounts of lead in their
systems.
Voting Rights Act extended
Washington — The House last night over
whelmingly approved extension of the Vot
ing Rights Act of 1965, giving Democrats and
civil rights groups one of their few legisla
tive victories this year.
The bill extends anti-discrimination laws
at the polls indefinitely but gives juris
dictions covered by the act an easier way to
escape its provisions with good behavior.
The 389-to-24 vote came after a coalition
of Democrats and moderate Republicans
brushed aside nine amendments designed
to weaken the bill and eliminate the re
quirement for printing of bilingual ballots.
"Today, the House has made good its
commitments to the major civil rights bat
tles of the 19605," Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-
Mass.) said a few minutes before the vote.
"It is guaranteeing the right to vote."
A coalition of Democrats and moderate
Republicans crushed opposition by ratios as
great as 3 to 1 as the extension moved
toward passage. Key provisions of the bill do
not expire until next August, but civil rights
groups had pressed for early House action
because they fear Senate opposition.
Irish prisons reformed
Belfast — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Cabinet has approved prison re
forms for Northern Ireland and will an
nounce them within days, the government
said yesterday.
Two days after Irish nationalist prisoners
gave up their hunger campaign at Maze
prison, the Northern Ireland Office, which
administers this province, said an an
nouncement of changes in the prison re
gime could come today.
Attempting to allay Protestants' fears of
concessions to the almost exclusively Ro
man Catholic IRA, the government has said
any reforms will apply to all inmates.
No new violence has been reported since
the collapse Saturday of the seven-month
hunger campaign for reforms amounting to
political status. Ten men starved themselves
to death and 64 people were killed in the
province's sectarian battle after the protest
began March 1.
The six men who gave up their fasts Satur
day were no longer in danger, the govern
ment said. Three were being nourished
back to health in hospitals and two have re
sumed a normal diet and returned to their
cells.
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
James Prior, who arrived here Sunday, was
completing plans for prison changes with
his deputy in charge of prisons, Lord
Gowrie.
Reagan asks for volunteers
Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
calling for a rejuvenation of "America's
deep spirit of generosity," said yesterday
the nation should turn more toward volun
teer work and private initiative to help cure
its social ills.
"With the same energy that Franklin Roo
sevelt sought government solutions to
problems, we will seek private solutions,"
the president said in a speech before the
National Alliance of Business.
Noting efforts by corporations and indi
viduals around the country to help the poor
and homeless, Reagan said, "Volunteer cuts
would be much more disruptive to the na

tion than federal budget cuts.
"Because they are so important, this ad
ministration seeks to elevate voluntary ac
tion and private initiative to the recognition
they deserve. We seek to increase their in
fluence on our daily lives and their roles in
meeting our social needs," the president
said.
"For too long, the American people have
been told they are relieved of responsibility
for helping their fellow man because gov
ernment has taken over the job," Reagan
said.
The president, acknowledging that some
of his cuts in the federal budget "will
pinch," said he agreed with those who feel
the poor should get "more than the basic
subsistence which the governmental safety
net programs provide."
French freeze prices
Paris — After allowing the franc to fall in
value by 8.5 percent against the mark, the
French government acted yesterday to
freeze prices of essential goods and services
and curb wage demands in an effort to bring
down the annual inflation rate from the
present 14 percent to 10 percent next year.
While opposition leaders and news
papers have denounced the devaluation as
"a catastrophe" and even "a disgrace,"
French Finance Minister Jacques Delors
tried urgently to counter the impression
that a cheaper franc would open the way to
greater inflation.
He said the franc had lost 30 percent of its
value under the previous government, and
the present adjustment was "just right" for
the present. It would lead to more jobs
through added exports and favor the "re
conquest of the domestic market" by
checking imports, Delors said.
Delors intends to seek authority today to
freeze the cost of all services for six months
— or until Jan. 1 where special agreements
for moderation can be reached. "Sensitive"
consumer prices would be blocked for
three months, including bread, milk, butter,
margarine, sugar and coffee.
The heaviest political price for the pack
age will be wage restraint — an element
hardly yet discussed by the new govern
ment. Delors said he would meet union and
industrial leaders today to discuss what he
called "new rules of the game."
The new rules are expected to be debated
at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Delors said
interest rates would now go down
progressively, "without haste, but not too
slowly."
Prime Minister Andre Mauroy said yes
terday the government had decided to act
in the European Economic Community "to
seek the strengthening of the community's
mechanism for fighting unfair competition
from outside." This apparently referred to
what were viewed as excessive imports from
Japan and from American agriculture.
Stocks fall at close
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
up more than 8 points at the outset, was off
.86 at 859.87 by the close of trading yester
day.
The average climbed 36.72 points last
week.
Advances outnumbered declines by
about a 2-1 margin on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 51.29 million
shares, against 54.54 million in the previous
session.
