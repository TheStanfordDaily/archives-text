# Helicopter headaches
## 
### Dan Labov 
For many Santa Clara County
residents, the ominous Monday
night helicopter roar, the glaring
lights and the sticky residue that
follows represent at worst a minor
nuisance or an eerie reminder of the
movie "Apocalypse Now."
But the nuisance factor is higher
from some than for others.
Some may casually remark that
malathion is so harmless it might not
even kill the flies; that they use it in
their own backyards. A roommate
may complain of being subjected to
peril and disease. Some may wonder
whether if cars and bicycles should
be protected by cloth, the effect on
human skin might warrant a little
extra precaution as well.
"I hate it," said Mariann Barry, a
secretary at the Veteran's
Administration (V.A.) Hospital in
Palo Alto, expressing the concerns of
many local residents who have lived
with the inconvenience of having the
war agaisnt the Mediterranean fruit
fly waged, literally, in their own
backyards.
"I always feel like the attack
helicopters are coming," she
continued.
"They fly so low over my backyard.
My cat doesn't like it, and neither do
I."
Trauma
But malathion sprayings can be
even more traumatic for those who
have experienced the frightful

Monday-night noises under
conditionsof genuine horror.
Vietnam veterans are a case in
point.
Atthe V.A. Hospital, where a
special program is underway to help
Vietnam veterans cope with
problems of delayed reaction,
veterans have been found to be
especially sensitive to any reminders
of their wartime experience. The
program there is rather unique; only
three like it exist in the country,
designed to help vets deal with
memories of days when eerie lights
and the whir of low-flying choppers
meant more serious trouble.
Patients at the hospital have
displayed anxiety and emotion when
the heliocopters fly overhead,
spraying malathion, often provoking
bitter memories of their wartime
experiences.
Butaccordingtoone hospital
staffer, Fred Gusman, "It is hard to
judge whether or not the complaints
are actually legitimate.
"There are guys who use it as a real
cop-out, or to take a political stance,
complaining about injustices done to
them and others by the
government."
sußeal or imagined fear?
Gusman went on to point out that
the noise emitted by a helicopter is
just one of manysensory perceptions
that can evoke psycholocial
disturbance or bitter feelings in a
veteran's mind.

"The guy who would go bonkers
from the helicopters is really sick,
and would go bonkers anyway," he
claimed. "Any one of a number of
things could trigger it."
Reactions need not necessarily be
violent or extreme, however; many
veterans simply complain of having
troublesleeping.
Gusman took a rather cool view of
the degree of seriousness of the
heliocopter noise on the patitients.
"Nobody's going to kill
themselves. Though we talked about
it a lot when it first started, it's no
longer a big deal here."
Another interesting dimension to
the matter emerges, Gusman said,
when the experience reminds
veterans of positive wartime
experiences.
"In fact, some of the guys even
applied for jobs to pilot the
helicopters," he remarked.
Beneficial effects
Reactions to the choppers can also
be beneficial in psychological
counseling, since the first stage in
understanding deeply rooted
problems is to bring them out into
the open.
"There is no reason for a guy with a
disturbed reaction to continue to go
through pain," said Gusman, saying
that he would advise those deeply
disturbed by the spraying
phenomenon to "get some help,"
and take advantage of the centers all
over willing to dispense it.

them and others by the
government."
sußeal or imagined fear?
Gusman went on to point out that
the noise emitted by a helicopter is
just one of manysensory perceptions
that can evoke psycholocial
disturbance or bitter feelings in a
veteran's mind.

"The guy who would go bonkers
from the helicopters is really sick,
and would go bonkers anyway," he
claimed. "Any one of a number of
things could trigger it."
Reactions need not necessarily be
violent or extreme, however; many
veterans simply complain of having
troublesleeping.
Gusman took a rather cool view of
the degree of seriousness of the
heliocopter noise on the patitients.
"Nobody's going to kill
themselves. Though we talked about
it a lot when it first started, it's no
longer a big deal here."
Another interesting dimension to
the matter emerges, Gusman said,
when the experience reminds
veterans of positive wartime
experiences.
"In fact, some of the guys even
applied for jobs to pilot the
helicopters," he remarked.
Beneficial effects
Reactions to the choppers can also
be beneficial in psychological
counseling, since the first stage in
understanding deeply rooted
problems is to bring them out into
the open.
"There is no reason for a guy with a
disturbed reaction to continue to go
through pain," said Gusman, saying
that he would advise those deeply
disturbed by the spraying
phenomenon to "get some help,"
and take advantage of the centers all
over willing to dispense it.

For many Santa Clara County
residents, the ominous Monday
night helicopter roar, the glaring
lights and the sticky residue that
follows represent at worst a minor
nuisance or an eerie reminder of the
movie "Apocalypse Now."
But the nuisance factor is higher
from some than for others.
Some may casually remark that
malathion is so harmless it might not
even kill the flies; that they use it in
their own backyards. A roommate
may complain of being subjected to
peril and disease. Some may wonder
whether if cars and bicycles should
be protected by cloth, the effect on
human skin might warrant a little
extra precaution as well.
"I hate it," said Mariann Barry, a
secretary at the Veteran's
Administration (V.A.) Hospital in
Palo Alto, expressing the concerns of
many local residents who have lived
with the inconvenience of having the
war agaisnt the Mediterranean fruit
fly waged, literally, in their own
backyards.
"I always feel like the attack
helicopters are coming," she
continued.
"They fly so low over my backyard.
My cat doesn't like it, and neither do
I."
Trauma
But malathion sprayings can be
even more traumatic for those who
have experienced the frightful

Monday-night noises under
conditionsof genuine horror.
Vietnam veterans are a case in
point.
Atthe V.A. Hospital, where a
special program is underway to help
Vietnam veterans cope with
problems of delayed reaction,
veterans have been found to be
especially sensitive to any reminders
of their wartime experience. The
program there is rather unique; only
three like it exist in the country,
designed to help vets deal with
memories of days when eerie lights
and the whir of low-flying choppers
meant more serious trouble.
Patients at the hospital have
displayed anxiety and emotion when
the heliocopters fly overhead,
spraying malathion, often provoking
bitter memories of their wartime
experiences.
Butaccordingtoone hospital
staffer, Fred Gusman, "It is hard to
judge whether or not the complaints
are actually legitimate.
"There are guys who use it as a real
cop-out, or to take a political stance,
complaining about injustices done to
them and others by the
government."
