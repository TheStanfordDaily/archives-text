# City Council meeting reviews residents' complaints
## P.A. sunlight rights debated 
### Bambi Haggins 
Concern for the preservation of
sunlight for local residences
emerged as one of the major topics
of discussion at the Palo Alto City
Council meeting held last night.
The council, in clearing up un
finished business from the Sept 21
meeting, decided upon an appeal to
a planning council decision which
had ruled that what is termed the
"daylight plane" of one residence
could not violate that of another.
The person against whom the de
cision was ruled, Barry Hennings,
argued while the proposed addition
to the building under question
would violate the daylight plane of
another structure, that deprivation of
sunlight would not equal the hard
ships that would be caused by the
changing of the design for the addi
tion to the home.
The plaintiff in the original case
made before the Planning Commit
tee, Nahib Ahmad Waleh, claimed
that the addition would deprive his
home, located at 2360 Emerson St., of
at least 25 percent of the sunlight that
it would normally receive during the
day.
More specifically, it was pointed

out that the appeal could not be
granted because it did not conform
to the extenuating circumstance re
quired to grant a variance to the or
dinances applying to the sunlight
rights.
The council ruled that a con
cession could not be made unless it
was proven that extreme hardship
would be suffered if the appeal was
not granted and that the variance
could challenge the concept of the
daylight plan as a viable factor in resi
dential life in Palo Alto.
The daylight plane was described
as not only a guarantee for sunlight,
but also a guarantee for space and a
safeguard against boxed-in resi
dences. ew Architectural board
members
The council also voted in two new
members to fill the slots in the
Architectural Review Board. John
Satoris and Dirk Venn bested an ap
plicant list of nine, winning by com
fortable margins.
Both have worked closely with the
council before and were favored to
win the two vacant seats.
Items on the consent calender for
the meeting included an amendment
to the weed abatement contract with
Santa Clara County; the awarding of

contracts â€” insulation for the weath
erization program, conduction for
Yacht Harbor Point excavation,
Baylands bicycle and pedestrian
pacts and the city resurfacing
project; and a resolution regarding
the city's procedures in dealing with
a state Senate Gas tax increase. These
were all passed as block before the
council recessed.
Young speaker
In the oral communication portion
of the meeting, Denise Tomski, a 12-
year-old Palo Alto resident, re
minded the council she had written
them a letter requesting that a
project to improve conditions at
Mitchell Park in Palo Alto. City Man
ager Bill Zanner informed Tomski
that the conditions were being in
vestigated and action would be taken
as soon as a study could be compiled.
Also included in this section of the
meeting was an invitation to the
council to attend the opening of a
new American opera by Robert
Shawls, based on "Alice in Wonder
land." The opera, which will make its
debut Oct. 17, will be sponsored by
Scholar Opera, a group actively seek
ing budgetary aid from the council
for future productions which will be
brought to Palo Alto.
