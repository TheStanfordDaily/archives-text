# Farm crimes rather off-beat

### Melinda Zachary 
If last week at the University is any
example, the typical crime rate here
runs something like this:
— 16 thefts and burglaries, the
items missing ranging from German
wine to a microwave oven;
— One missing person, who was
later found;
— A prowler reported to be peer
ing into dorm windows;
— An alleged threat involving a
dangerous weapon, which was later
discovered to be a firecracker in a
lacrosse stick; and
— One arrest for vandalism, after a
man damaged the tires and stole the
hubcaps from his ex-girlfriend's car.
The problem is this: it's difficult to

use any week as an example here, be
cause no week is really typical.
Meanwhile, the accident line-up
on campus proved about as non
quantifiable. It included a broken leg
and a head laceration, both of which
occurred at the Ohio State football
game (in the stands, not on the field),
as well as at least one injured jogger
and several bike accidents.
And across campus from the Medi
cal Center, the fire department was
busy answering no less than 18 false
alarms. It's not unlike having to pay
large amounts for meal cards — stu
dents here do a lot of debating about
whether food fights are "funny," but
Food Service officials will always say
they wind up costing a lot of money.

When it comes to fire alarms, one
thing stands out just as clearly —they
cost a lot of money too. "It's an un
believable waste of both time and
money for the fire department," ex
plained one fire station official.
The police strongly urge students
to be aware of how easily items such
as bikes, and even cars, can be stolen;
meanwhile, the paramedics strongly
urge students to keep their bikes
away from the front of cars, finally,
the firefighters say they wish that
when Stanford students get bored
they would try reading a good book
instead of pulling fire alarms.
Another untypical week has
begun.
