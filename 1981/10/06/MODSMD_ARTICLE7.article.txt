## China may disband communal set-up 
### Washington Post 
Beijing — Twenty-four years
ago, Mao Tse-tung forced Chi
na's half-billion peasants into
"people's communes," which
he hailed as the bridge to com
munist Utopia. All private
property was collectivized.
Backyard steel furnaces and
schools were set up to provide
every need. Wages were dis
tributed equally.
Today, Mao's communist
successors are debating the
dismantling of what must be
the largest Chinese social ex
periment ever imposed. Mao's
proudest achievement is now
deemed a failure that has re
aped little more than excessive
bureaucracy, inefficiency and
official corruption.
New pragmatism
In the new spirit of
pragmatism that is the prevail
ing philosophy of China today,
proposals are being circulated
within top party circles calling
for the restoration of tradi
tional districts and townships
that administered the vast Chi
nese countryside before com
munes were established.
Although top policy-makers
have discussed plans to abolish
the commune network since
1978, the issue continues to be
gingerly handled because of
the potentially explosive im
pact on peasants still loyal to
Mao's memory and the likely
political backlash from millions
of rural cadres who would be
out of power.
Communes set up in 1958
Foreign agriculture experts
in Beijing believe that scuttling
China's 50,000 communes after
nearly a quarter-century would
be even more radical than the
original decision in 1958 to set
them up as administrative
shells governing every facet of
rural life, from fixing produc
tion quotas to providing health
care.
One U.S. official likened the
current anti-commune cam
paign to kicking out the mayor,
city council and fire depart
ment of a small American
town. "You're really getting
into a mess when you go back
to people and tell them that
what they've been doing for
the last 20 years is wrong and
won't wash anymore," he said.
Localized power recently
Actually, the last three years
have seen sweeping changes in
China's countryside that have
drastically reduced the stature
of communes by giving greater
decision-making power to the
peasants, who just a few years
ago simply followed orders
passed down by bosses in the
commune or its subordinate
branches.
Instead of communal over
lords setting output require
ments for an entire village and
apportioning wages on the
basis of each peasant's con
tribution to the harvest, the
current system of production
— which is intended to
motivate peasants — bestows
full "responsibility" on a
household or group of house
holds.
Peasants now sign binding
contracts with local commune
officials promising to produce
so much for the state, com
mune and village. After meet
ing their responsibility by
fulfilling the quota, the house
holds can keep whatever re
mains for their own consump
tion or for sale at a private mar

ket.
This new "responsibility sys
tem" that covers more than 90
percent of China's countryside
is a far cry from the egalitarian
philosophy of people's com
munes as conceived by Mao
and his radical followers.
Communes as organizers
Mao promoted communes
as the vehicle for China's tran
sition to a perfect communist
society. They were called "or
ganizers of the living" as well as
units of production that would
produce "all-around men" —
farmers, laborers and teachers
— who would share equally in
the work and benefits of a
communist state.
Early communes not only
were given absolute man
agement control of rural life;
they became the repositories
of all private property. Ev
erything was collectivized,
from livestock to homes,
furnishings and even
wristwatches.
Communization brought
with it tremendous social and
economic changes as it swept
through the conservative Chi
nese countryside in 1958. Cot
tage industries were built to
augment agricultural work
with fertilizer production and
irrigation projects. Part-time
schools were organized to im
part basic technical skills.
Liberation of women
Women for the first time
were freed from their domestic
chores, their traditional roles
performed by huge communal
mess halls that fed hundreds of
peasants at a time. Live-in nurs
eries run by the elderly super
vised children while mothers
worked in the fields.
Despite the initial euphoria,
a combination of natural dis
asters, breakdown in economic
planning and the organiza
tional chaos caused by Mao's
Great Leap Forward greatly
diminished harvests and drove
the newly communized coun
tryside into near starvation by
1960.
This forced a restructuring of
Mao's communes and a retreat
from his ideals. The party re
stored the individual's right to
own private property. Com
munes would still exist, but
their decision-making power
was decentralized to the local
brigades and production teams
that had more direct contact
with the peasants.
Over-bureaucratized
Instead of producing a class
of "new communist men"
steeped in Marxist ideology
and technical skills, the com
munes have yielded a bumper
crop of self-aggrandizing bu
reaucrats who live off com
munal subsidies at the expense
of productive peasants, accord
ing to Chinese critics.
Rural cadres in the central
province of Henan were found
to have spent so much money
on their own salaries and lavish
communal projects — amount
ing to half the value of a vil
lage's annual output — that the
farmers were left without any
income and with less than two
pounds of grain a day.
Stories of enormous waste,
bungling and petty corruption
by communal bosses regularly
fill the pages of China's official
newspapers, which dutifully
record the unfair burden
shouldered by peasants who fi
nance the bureaucrats.

ments for an entire village and
apportioning wages on the
basis of each peasant's con
tribution to the harvest, the
current system of production
— which is intended to
motivate peasants — bestows
full "responsibility" on a
household or group of house
holds.
Peasants now sign binding
contracts with local commune
officials promising to produce
so much for the state, com
mune and village. After meet
ing their responsibility by
fulfilling the quota, the house
holds can keep whatever re
mains for their own consump
tion or for sale at a private mar

ket.
This new "responsibility sys
tem" that covers more than 90
percent of China's countryside
is a far cry from the egalitarian
philosophy of people's com
munes as conceived by Mao
and his radical followers.
Communes as organizers
Mao promoted communes
as the vehicle for China's tran
sition to a perfect communist
society. They were called "or
ganizers of the living" as well as
units of production that would
produce "all-around men" —
farmers, laborers and teachers
— who would share equally in
the work and benefits of a
communist state.
Early communes not only
were given absolute man
agement control of rural life;
they became the repositories
of all private property. Ev
erything was collectivized,
from livestock to homes,
furnishings and even
wristwatches.
Communization brought
with it tremendous social and
economic changes as it swept
through the conservative Chi
nese countryside in 1958. Cot
tage industries were built to
augment agricultural work
with fertilizer production and
irrigation projects. Part-time
schools were organized to im
part basic technical skills.
Liberation of women
Women for the first time
were freed from their domestic
chores, their traditional roles
performed by huge communal
mess halls that fed hundreds of
peasants at a time. Live-in nurs
eries run by the elderly super
vised children while mothers
worked in the fields.
Despite the initial euphoria,
a combination of natural dis
asters, breakdown in economic
planning and the organiza
tional chaos caused by Mao's
Great Leap Forward greatly
diminished harvests and drove
the newly communized coun
tryside into near starvation by
1960.
This forced a restructuring of
Mao's communes and a retreat
from his ideals. The party re
stored the individual's right to
own private property. Com
munes would still exist, but
their decision-making power
was decentralized to the local
brigades and production teams
that had more direct contact
with the peasants.
Over-bureaucratized
Instead of producing a class
of "new communist men"
steeped in Marxist ideology
and technical skills, the com
munes have yielded a bumper
crop of self-aggrandizing bu
reaucrats who live off com
munal subsidies at the expense
of productive peasants, accord
ing to Chinese critics.
Rural cadres in the central
province of Henan were found
to have spent so much money
on their own salaries and lavish
communal projects — amount
ing to half the value of a vil
lage's annual output — that the
farmers were left without any
income and with less than two
pounds of grain a day.
Stories of enormous waste,
bungling and petty corruption
by communal bosses regularly
fill the pages of China's official
newspapers, which dutifully
record the unfair burden
shouldered by peasants who fi
nance the bureaucrats.
Beijing — Twenty-four years
ago, Mao Tse-tung forced Chi
na's half-billion peasants into
"people's communes," which
he hailed as the bridge to com
munist Utopia. All private
property was collectivized.
Backyard steel furnaces and
schools were set up to provide
every need. Wages were dis
tributed equally.
Today, Mao's communist
successors are debating the
dismantling of what must be
the largest Chinese social ex
periment ever imposed. Mao's
proudest achievement is now
deemed a failure that has re
aped little more than excessive
bureaucracy, inefficiency and
official corruption.
New pragmatism
In the new spirit of
pragmatism that is the prevail
ing philosophy of China today,
proposals are being circulated
within top party circles calling
for the restoration of tradi
tional districts and townships
that administered the vast Chi
nese countryside before com
munes were established.
Although top policy-makers
have discussed plans to abolish
the commune network since
1978, the issue continues to be
gingerly handled because of
the potentially explosive im
pact on peasants still loyal to
Mao's memory and the likely
political backlash from millions
of rural cadres who would be
out of power.
Communes set up in 1958
Foreign agriculture experts
in Beijing believe that scuttling
China's 50,000 communes after
nearly a quarter-century would
be even more radical than the
original decision in 1958 to set
them up as administrative
shells governing every facet of
rural life, from fixing produc
tion quotas to providing health
care.
One U.S. official likened the
current anti-commune cam
paign to kicking out the mayor,
city council and fire depart
ment of a small American
town. "You're really getting
into a mess when you go back
to people and tell them that
what they've been doing for
the last 20 years is wrong and
won't wash anymore," he said.
Localized power recently
Actually, the last three years
have seen sweeping changes in
China's countryside that have
drastically reduced the stature
of communes by giving greater
decision-making power to the
peasants, who just a few years
ago simply followed orders
passed down by bosses in the
commune or its subordinate
branches.
