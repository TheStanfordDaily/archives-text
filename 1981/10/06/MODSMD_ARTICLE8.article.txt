Vatican City (AP) — Pope John Paul 11,
guarded by the tightest security in memory at
the Vatican, returned to St. Peter's Square on
Sunday for the first time since he was shot there
in an assassination attempt May 13.
Plainclothes guards, some wearing tuxedos
and white bow ties, searched the bags of ev
eryone entering the elliptical piazza. More than
200 police and security guards were on duty,
some using hand-held metal detectors to check
for concealed weapons.
Some reactions
"I've been coming to St. Peter's for 26 years,
and they've never looked in my purse before,"
said Marzia Pellegrino, a 50-year-old legal secre
tary who lives in Rome.
"It's necessary, from my point of view," she
added. "They shouldn't let him (the pope) go

down into the square anymore. It's dangerous."
Wearing white and gold robes and carrying a
silver staff with a crucifix at the top, the 61-year
old pontiff smiled for the crowd but looked tired
as he sat on a throne at the top of the steps in
front of St. Peter's Basilica's main door.
Beatifies five
He "beatified" three Italians and two French
people, known for charitable works and found
ing religious orders, at the outdoor ceremony.
Beatification is a major step toward sainthood.
Afterward, he celebrated Mass and then moved
to a balcony above the basilica's main door to
gave his weekly blessing.
A light drizzle fell on a crowd of tourists and
pilgrims estimated by Vatican officials at 40,000
early in the three-hour ceremony. More people
arrived later, and reporters put the crowd at
about 70,000.
