# Europeans revise currencies
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — In a major realign
ment of European currencies, Common Mar
ket finance ministers agreed Sunday to raise
the value of the West German mark and the
Dctch guilder by 5Vi percent and lower the
value of the French franc and Italian lira by 3
percent within the European Monetary Sys
tem.
The accord, which followed eight hours of
tough bargaining by the ministers meeting in
Brussels, represents the largest change in cur
rency parities since the inception of the sys
tem in March 1979. The monetary system was
created to buffer European currencies
against fluctuations in the dollar and promote
financial discipline among Common Market
countries.
One of the factors influencing the change
was the recent rush of international money
from the dollar to the deutschmark. The re
cent dramatic drop in the dollar against the
mark has reflected international doubts
about the Reagan administration's economic
plan and revived confidence in Bonn's econ
omy as a result of an improvement in West
Germany's balance of payments position.
A weaker dollar means to the U.S. econo
my more expensive imports, which add to in
flation, but also means cheaper U.S. exports,
which spurs some American industries.
After the changes were announced Sunday
in a communique, West German Finance
Minister Hans Matthoefer told reporters the
agreement would increase the strength ofthe
mark. He added that expectations in the Unit
ed States were for a strong rise in the mark's
value against the dollar.
The European Monetary System was engi
neered largely by West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt and former French presi
dent Valery Giscard d'Estaing to foster a
"zone of monetary stability" in Europe at a

time when European confidence in U.S. eco
nomic management under former President
Jimmy Carter was low. The system, despite
certain drawbacks, has been more successful
than even many supporters had expected.
Since its inauguration two and one-half
years ago, the system has had only one
modest general realignment, in September
1 979 .
The system links the currencies of eight of
the 10 European Economic Community
member nations — excluding Britain and
Greece — in a joint float against other world
currencies.
Causing much of the pressure for Sunday's
realignment was the contrast between
French and German economic policies fol
lowing last May's election of French Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand.
While West Germany has been keeping its
monetary policy tight and instituting austerity
measures to restrict federal borrowing next
year, Mitterrand's Socialist government has
moved to create new public sector jobs and
legislate other measures to cut unemploy
ment.
West Germany and France had an interest
in delaying adjustments in their currencies —
France because a devaluation of the franc
would be a blow to its national pride, and
Germany because an increase in the mark's
value would make German exports more ex
pensive and thus threaten the country's hope
of pulling out of the recession soon.
French Finance Minister Jacques Delors
told reporters the steep difference between
inflation rates in France and West Germany
made the realignment a "collective and in
evitable step." French inflation is running at
13.7 percent a year, compared to 7 percent in
West Germany.
Delors said Sunday's meeting was called at
the initiative of France and West Germany.
