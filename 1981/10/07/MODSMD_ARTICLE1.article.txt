# Uncertainty rules after Sadat death
## Short-term Middle East stability seen 
### Christine Myers Monika Guttman Senior staff writers 
The shaky stability of the Middle
East depends on whoever is elected
the next president of Egypt, accord
ing to local experts in Middle Eastern
affairs.
But for the time being, the con
sensus is that the region will not be
greatly affected by the assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
Researchers at the conservative
Hoover Institution said they believe
Sadat's successor will have a difficult
job filling the position, which de
mands a balance of many internal
factions and external interests.
Sadat's successor will have a major
impact on crucial Arab-Israeli rela
tions.
"No Arab states wili attack Israel
without Egypt," said Peter Duignan,
curator of the Hoover's African col
lection.
On the other hand, many Arabs
blame Egypt's isolation from the Arab
world for present instability in the
Middle East. "Israel would not have
dared to attack Lebanon without the
Camp David accords," said a spokes
man for Stanford's Arab Student As

sociation.
"There won't be chaos, because
the government has moved effective
ly to establish a transitional govern
ment," said Eric Davis, a national fel
low at Hoover. "As long as the mili
tary doesn't get active, there won't
be any chaos."
Most experts agreed that the mili
tary didn't seem to have been a part
of the assassination, as there was no
attempted coup, even though exiled
Lt. General Chazli, one of Sadat's
leading opponents, called for im
mediate takeover by the military.
According to Duignan, control of
the military may prove decisive in the
selection of Egypt's next president.
He said the military sympathizes with
the pan-Arabist movement and dis
likes the isolated position Sadat had
taken.
Since the assassination could not
be directly connected with the mili
tary, many blamed well known op
position groups such as the Moslem
Brotherhood.
"The Moslem Brotherhood is a
force that Westerners have under
estimated for a long time," said Lewis
Gann, a fellow at Hoover.
Last month, in an effort to quell

some of the dissent, Sadat jailed
members of the Brotherhood, as well
as Copts and Moslems suspected of
recently fomenting Moslem-Chris
tian strife in Egypt. There was
speculation that the Brotherhood
may have acted in conjunction with
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
"It is most difficult to speculate
what was the true motive behind the
assassination," said Michel Nabti, a
specialist in Middle Eastern studies
and a former fellow at Hoover In
situation. "Sadat's rule has not been
without challenge, both in Egypt and
the rest of the world."
Nabti said he felt the recent
crackdown on dissidents was a re
sponse to increasing dissent within
Egypt. Opposition from such groups
as the Brotherhood and the Egyptian
Communist Party predates the Camp
David accords and was evident un
der the leadership of Sadat's prede
cessor, Abdul Gamal Nassar.
"There were also economic pres
sures â€” a rising cost of living and se
vere inflation, due to the so called
'Sadat open policy', in which Sadat
had opened up Egyptian economy to
multinationals in 1974," Nabti said.

"These all contributed to an
tagonistic feelings toward the Sadat
government."
According to Political Science Prof.
Seymour Martin Lipset, Sadat pre
dicted his own assassination last year
after Libyan Premier Muamir Quada
ffi placed a million-dollar bounty on
the Egyptian president's life .
One Arab view is that Sadat's peace
attempts in the Middle East de
stroyed Arab unity by pulling Egypt
out of the community. Some mem
bers of the Arao community said
they hope that with Sadat's death
Egypt's foreign policy will fall in line
with pan-Arab sentiment.
"We are guardedly pleased," said a
spokesman for the Arab Student As
sociation here. "We have always con
sidered Sadat to be a traitor to Arab
peoples."
The spokesman said Egypt's sepa
ration from the rest of the Arab world
stood in the way of what he said he
hoped would be an "honorable
peace" in the Middle East, "not at the
expense of the PLO."
Sadat's assassination will affect U.S.
policy in the region, according to
