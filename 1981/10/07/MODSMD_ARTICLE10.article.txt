Researchers from the NASA
Ames Research Center in Mof
fett Field and the U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture have de
veloped a new technique using
color-infrared photography in
California's Imperial Valley to
detect clogged drainage lines
in irrigated croplands. The val
ley has an intricate system of
drainage lines six feet under
ground which can flush out
saline water and control the
water table below the root
zone.
Unfortunately, oxidized
manganese and iron from the
soil sometimes falls out of solu
tion, accumulates in the drain
pipes, and obstructs the water
flow when only 1/10 percent of

oxygen is present, said Luther
Grass of the USDA in Brawley,
California. These plugs can be
located easily by infrared pho
tography. Iron appears red and
manganese appears black on
the photographs, Brawley said.
A series of streaks appear in a
field directly over a drainpipe
after irrigation, if the drainpipe
is working properly, Grass said.
An interruption of these
streaks means that there is a
plug along the pipe. Dry land is
warmer and appears as a light
color on the infrared photo
graph, while a wet area shows
up dark because it is much
cooler, according to Grass.
Thus the boundary line be
tween the wet and dry areas in
dicates an obstruction.

By spotting a clogged drain
early on, NASA's Bob
Goetleman said, the aerial pho
tography can save farmers'
crops and the expense of hav
ing the drain field dug up. The
drain is unclogged by using
high pressure jet cleaning de
vices. "If your sink is stopped
up, you call the roto-rooter
man. If clogged drains are
spotted early on, low cost work
can be done to fix them before
a major catastrophe. It is a pre
ventive maintenance plan,"
Goetleman said.
NASA's Ames Research Cen
ter specializes in agricultural
research from aircraft and was
requested by the USDA in 1980
to help with the clogged drain
problem.
