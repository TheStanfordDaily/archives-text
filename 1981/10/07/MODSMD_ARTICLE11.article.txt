## Safety precautions for students 
### Susan Scheiber 
"Avoid dark, vacant, or deserted
areas. Use a light when riding a bicycle.
Don't hitchhike." This advice may
sound much like the warnings hastily
administered by mother as her baby
went off to college. Actually, these and
other sound admonitions were dis
tributed to students in all Reg Packs,
along with a map of Suggested Travel
Routes (STRs).
The STR map, which was prepared by
the Special Services Unit of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, points out
routes that are well lit, highly traveled,
free of obstacles (such as bushes) and
have access to fire alarm boxes which
can be pulled in ay emergency. Palm
Drive, for examle, is not a STR because it
has no fire alarm boxes, inadequate
lighting, many thick bushes, and it is in a
relatively deserted area.
"The map was designed for women
out alone at night," said junior Andy
Cargile, who works for the Department
of Public Safety and has also taken over
the directorship of Students United for
Rape Elimination (S.U.R.E.) escort ser
vice this year.
"The map gives women an alternative
to S.U.R.E. since many are uncom
fortable using the escort service,"
Cargile said.
S.U.R.E. is one good available option,

however. S.U.R.E. escorts will travel
across campus, or up to one mile off
campus, with anyone, male or female,
who feels uncomfortable walking
alone. The escorts are available from 8
p.m. to midnight until November 15,
and from 6:30 p.m. to midnight from
November 15 through winter quarter.
Spring quarter hours are 8:30 p.m. to
midnight.
Cargile emphasized the need for es
corts, especially women, who are sent
out in teams of two. "We want to
oroject the image of a safety-oriented,
not male-oriented, organization,"
S.U.R.E. members are not the only
group on campus working against rape,
however. One hundred fifty students,
with financial help from more than 30
places, have designated this week Rape
Awareness Week.
Symposiums on the topic "Working
Against Rape: Current Research and
Strategies for Change," self-defense
demonstrations, poetry-readings and a
tear gas certification class are some of
the activities planned.
"The threat of rape is a discrimination
against all women," said Patricia Brandt
of the Office of Student Activities.
"What we need is a basic change in
people's attitudes. 'Working Against
Rape' is designed to make people more
aware and informed.

"Women are not victims. They are
people with full lives and should be
treated as such," Brandt said.
"If you're involved in a potential at
tack situation, you should keep your
head and do what the situation dic
tates," Cargile said. "If you can, think
and be aware of your surroundings. I'm
not a proponent of self-defense in ev
ery instance. Always keep in mind some
kind of game plan to follow, should
somebody come out. When it happens
too much is rushing through your mind
to always make the best choices."
It's not just the threat of rape that's a
problem on the Stanford campus. In
1980, there were 365 burglaries, 940
thefts, 5 robberies, and 1 reported rape,
according to the Department of Public
Safety and Residential Education. These
figures do not take into account inci
dents in areas surrounding the campus.
The Department of Public Safety of
fers some suggestions to combat these
threats. In your residence hall or home,
you should know your neighbors so
you can help each other, don't keep
high-value items or large amounts of
money in your room, and report any
suspicious persons in dorms to the po
lice. If you are accosted and feel you are
in danger, pull the nearest fire alarm
box and phone the police by dialing 911
on any phone.
