# Marguerite line changes
## 
### Letty Mallin 
Marguerite bus users have probably already
discovered that some changes were made in the
bus system over this summer — and not all of
these have met with their approval.
This year, the number of buses has been cut in
half, from four to two during the day and from
six to three at lunch hour. Also, the buses now
travel the same direction, rather than one going
and one coming.
"The bus should be running in both directions
like last year," said Varinia Paige, a human
biology major here. Other passengers expressed
disapproval at the cutback as well.
The Marguerite has long been a handy alter
native to trudging around campus and the com
munity for bikeless students because it makes
frequent stops on campus.
Starting from the front of the Quad at Serra
Street, the bus stops at Escondido Village, Wilbur
Hall, Stern Hall, Meyer Library, Pearce Mitchell
Houses, Tresidder Union, Terman Engineering
Center, Roble Hall, Roble Gym, Jordan Quad,
and the Medical Center.
Two buses follow this circuitous tour of cam
pus, except from 11:30 a.m. — 1:30 p.m., when
there are three buses with additional stops at the
Stanford Barn and Shopping Center.
Marguerite is described by users as clean, airy,

comfortable and free.
At present, Marguerite is being used primarily
by graduate students to commute from Escon
diao Village to classes, according to one
Marguerite bus driver. Even with the cutbacks,
the bus is normally uncrowded except during
the 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. class rush from Escondido,
the driver said. It is because of this minimal use
that Marguerite buses were cut back this year,
he said.
The route now takes longer than last year's 20
minutes to complete; drivers blame this on the
fact that the buses are now running the same
direction.
But the slowdown is also due to bikeriders, ac
cording to a Marguerite driver: "Seventy per
cent of the riders look both ways, but the other
30 percent just don't bother."
Furthermore, the schedule is tight, according
to drivers, making it difficult to repeat the entire
course in 20 minutes, even without bikers, dur
ing their 10-hour, six days-a-week shifts.
Despite the cutbacks, the Marguerite con
tinues to provide special services to the train sta
tion from 6 to 9 a.m. and from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.
stopping at the Medical Center, Serra Street and
Memorial Church.
Also, this year Marguerite buses offer facilities
for the handicapped.


THE MARGUERITE BUS — completes its route around campus every 20 minutes. Service
is less consistent this year, however, as the number of buses nas been cut from four to two
during the day and from six to three during lunch hours.
