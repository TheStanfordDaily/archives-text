### George Fujii 
To all newcomers, the Stan
ford Arms Control Disarma
ment Forum (SACDF) is a cam
pus based organization started
last January by a group of indi
viduals whose goal is to find
solutions to the nuclear arms
problem. According to
Caroline Wellbery, one of the
members of the group, SACDF
was begun last January, and
was inspired by an organiza
tion called Physicians for Social
Response (PSR), based in
Harvard.
The purpose of SACD, ac
cording to its information
sheet, is to develop a new fo
rum for the public discussion
of nuclear weapons. SACDF
considers arms control a highly
complex subject, often restrict
ed to experts in the freld.
According to its release,
SACDF seeks to educate the
public about the conse
quences of nuclear war and the

possible approaches to preven
ting it without taking any politi
cal stances.
Some ideas introduced by
the organization are a nuclear
freeze, or moving the arms
race into space.
Last term, SACDF-sponsored
evets included a week of
educational activities com
prised of lectures, films, and
debates; gathering speakers
(such as Sydney Drell and
Wolfgang Panofsky of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator) to ap
pear at their events; and setting
up an exhibit in Meyer Library
during "Weapons Crisis
Week."
According to their informa
tion sheet, SACDF is planning
for this term a conference on
the psychological aspects of
the arms race with a panel of
Bay Area psychologists, and a
public debate between weap
ons manufacturers and de
fense spending critics on the

economic consequences of the
arms race.
On a regular basis, Wellbery
said SACDF will also be spon
soring a film series in Kresge
Auditorium. The films will be
thematically arranged by his
toric, economic, and fictional
subject matter of nuclear
weapons.
Also, SACDF is establishing a
library of cassettes, videotapes,
and books open to the public.
Wellbery added that as of this
time the library has no per
manent location, but in the
future the group hopes to lo
cate one in Green Library.
SACDF's present member
ship total is difficult to pinpoint
due to the long summer lay
off, said Wellbery. Sign-ups
were being taken during last
week's harvest festival. Well
bery added that what they want
is a student based organization
with a faculty advisory board.
