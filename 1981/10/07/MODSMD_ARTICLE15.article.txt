## Viewpoint/Christopher Hedrick Planned income tax indexing would add to federal deficit 
### 
The acceptance by Congress of
President Ronald Reagan's three
year, 25 percent income tax cut was
accompanied by tremendous public-
praise and criticism. In the words
of'his supporters, the president had
started "to get government off the
backs of the American people." The
"Reagan Revolution" was on track
and gaining momentum.
Almost lost in his hoopla was what
could potentially be the most signifi
cant change made by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981. That
change, the indexing of income tax
es, involves a major shift in the for
mulation of tax policy. The plan is
scheduled to begin in 1985 after the
three across-the-board rate cuts have
taken place. It calls for an automatic
adjustment of income taxes to offset
inflation.
indexing is designed to eliminate
what has been popularly called
bracket creep. Basically, the plan will
mean that if a person's income in
creases at the same rate as inflation,
reflecting no gain in real income, he
will continue to pay the same per
centage of income tax to the federal
government.
tProponents of the measure con

tend that inflation has allowed past
Congresses to accelerate spending
painlessly. They say that that political
honesty demands that if the federal
budget needs to be enlarged, Con
gress should have to increase taxes.
Opponents answer that indexing is
a disastrous move that will lock the
federal government into a pattern of
either continual deficits or year after
year of socially painful budget cuts.
Concerns that the move would
present a signal that the government
was throwing in the sponge to infla
tion were voiced even by members
of the president's cabinet. Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan last May told
the Senate Finance Committee that
he opposed indexing because it
would be an "indication we're giving
in to the inflationary fight."
In fact, the indexing proposal was
not in Reagan's original tax cut bill.
However, congressional support for
the change to indexing was strong. It
was included in the final bill and was
approved in the Senate by a vote of
57-40 and in the House, 238-195.
Even without indexing, the House
Budget Committee now forcasts a
federal deficit of more than $100

billion in fiscal year 1985. And that
figure is based on the assumption
that the administration will slash $70
billion more in spending between
now and 1984. Such imbalances fuel
both high interest rates and inflation.
Putting into place additional revenue
cuts through indexing will only ex
acerbate the situation.
By 1985 the Reagan administration
will be looking for new sources of
revenue, not for more cutbacks.
Eliminating indexing before it starts
could be a politically benign solu
tion. Other nations, in times of eco
nomic uncertainty, have suspended
their indexing and it is lively the Unit
ed States will do the same.
Indexing seems sensical in times of
economic stability and low inflation.
But in light of the massive budget def
icit forcasted for 1985, such a com
mitment appears to be a hasty and ill
advised one. Given the president's
high priority on military spending,
the revenue shortfalls that would
come as a result of indexing would
force even deeper cuts into social
programs. Such a change should not,
and I predict will not, occur.
