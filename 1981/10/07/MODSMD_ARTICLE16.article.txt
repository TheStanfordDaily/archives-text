## Human safety must come before cost benefits 
### 
; Worker safety and environmental protection have
never been overriding concerns for those who control
industry and government. Modest advances were
achieved in these areas during the last 15 to 20 years, but
now the Reagan Administration has shown its clear in
tention to eviscerate the relevant legislation and regu
la'tory agencies. The code words in this assault are "cost
benefit analysis." No longer are health and safety to be
recognized as intrinsically important concerns; rather,
they must compete for importance with industrial prod
uctivity and profit margins.
Business propaganda in the current push for deregula
tion has been exceedingly simplistic. For example, the
automobile industry has emphasized that pollution con
trols and collision safety standards have raised the cost of
a Tiew car by several hundred dollars. Cleaner air,
lessened chances of death or injury — these are in
tangibles that are not immediately evident to the con
sumer.
Assigning a monetary value to human life is consistent
only with a view of the individual as somehow "replace
able": simply a cog in the great machine of industrial so
ciety. Although this may be a convenient fiction to use in
ab introduction to micro-economies, its moral founda
tion is totally at odds with the fundamentals of de
mocracy.
The ethical issues involved in intentionally exposing
workers and the public to known or potential hazards
have, for the most part, been studiously ignored. Before
aerial spraying of malathion began on the Peninsula,
thlere was plenty of controversy as to the most ef
ficaceous way of dispersing pesticide, yet what public of
ficial asked himself: What empowers government to
spfray poison on the populace? The media continually
bombarded the public with word of the plight of the
"multi-billion dollar agricultural industry" should the
Medfly spread. Implicit in all this reporting, and explicit
in-the form taken by the spray program, has been the
sarne "cost-benefit analysis" mentioned above: public
health risks have bowed to pecuniary considerations.

Should more toxic chemicals be needed next spring for
Medfly control, we can expect to hear a repeat.
Malthion spraying is hardly unique in the annals of
governmental actions which endanger the citizenry.
What is more shocking, however, is that clear evidence
of actual harm to people has been ignored or covered
up. Soldiers, in particular, have suffered at the hands of
government. Numerous veterans have died or been in
capacitated by exposure to radiation or chemicals. Most
recently, Vietnam veterans have sought redress for the
effects of the defoliant Agent Orangp Cancer and genet
ic damage have been connected to exposure to Agent
Orange, yet the Veterans Administration has denied all
claims for compensation. In frustration, some veterans
sued the federal government, only to learn that a 1950
Supreme Court decision denied them that right, even
though the government may have been negligent in ex
posing them to the chemical.
Public perception of the role of the scientist has cer
tainly contributed to the vulnerability of health and safe
ty laws. Whether the issue be pesticides, pollution, radi
ation, or otherwise, industry and government seem to
produce an endless string of scientific "experts" to claim
that existing or proposed laws are unduly restrictive and
not scientifically based. Because our society inculcates
people with the concept that the specialist knows best,
'those claims are given credence; and those citizens who
are concerned enough to do a bit of independent in
quiry are inevitably branded as "crazies," or else dis
missed contemptuously as "uninformed." Contrary to
the popular press, scientific training does not impart
either infallability or impartiality to the scientist, how
ever.
It is unfortunate that protection of public health and
safety is even debated in this country, but that is the sad
reality. The pending "unleashing" of industry from regu
latory constraints U the Reagan Administration's sign
that people still do not come before profits.

up. Soldiers, in particular, have suffered at the hands of
government. Numerous veterans have died or been in
capacitated by exposure to radiation or chemicals. Most
recently, Vietnam veterans have sought redress for the
effects of the defoliant Agent Orangp Cancer and genet
ic damage have been connected to exposure to Agent
Orange, yet the Veterans Administration has denied all
claims for compensation. In frustration, some veterans
sued the federal government, only to learn that a 1950
Supreme Court decision denied them that right, even
though the government may have been negligent in ex
posing them to the chemical.
Public perception of the role of the scientist has cer
tainly contributed to the vulnerability of health and safe
ty laws. Whether the issue be pesticides, pollution, radi
ation, or otherwise, industry and government seem to
produce an endless string of scientific "experts" to claim
that existing or proposed laws are unduly restrictive and
not scientifically based. Because our society inculcates
people with the concept that the specialist knows best,
'those claims are given credence; and those citizens who
are concerned enough to do a bit of independent in
quiry are inevitably branded as "crazies," or else dis
missed contemptuously as "uninformed." Contrary to
the popular press, scientific training does not impart
either infallability or impartiality to the scientist, how
ever.
It is unfortunate that protection of public health and
safety is even debated in this country, but that is the sad
reality. The pending "unleashing" of industry from regu
latory constraints U the Reagan Administration's sign
that people still do not come before profits.

; Worker safety and environmental protection have
never been overriding concerns for those who control
industry and government. Modest advances were
achieved in these areas during the last 15 to 20 years, but
now the Reagan Administration has shown its clear in
tention to eviscerate the relevant legislation and regu
la'tory agencies. The code words in this assault are "cost
benefit analysis." No longer are health and safety to be
recognized as intrinsically important concerns; rather,
they must compete for importance with industrial prod
uctivity and profit margins.
Business propaganda in the current push for deregula
tion has been exceedingly simplistic. For example, the
automobile industry has emphasized that pollution con
trols and collision safety standards have raised the cost of
a Tiew car by several hundred dollars. Cleaner air,
lessened chances of death or injury — these are in
tangibles that are not immediately evident to the con
sumer.
Assigning a monetary value to human life is consistent
only with a view of the individual as somehow "replace
able": simply a cog in the great machine of industrial so
ciety. Although this may be a convenient fiction to use in
ab introduction to micro-economies, its moral founda
tion is totally at odds with the fundamentals of de
mocracy.
The ethical issues involved in intentionally exposing
workers and the public to known or potential hazards
have, for the most part, been studiously ignored. Before
aerial spraying of malathion began on the Peninsula,
thlere was plenty of controversy as to the most ef
ficaceous way of dispersing pesticide, yet what public of
ficial asked himself: What empowers government to
spfray poison on the populace? The media continually
bombarded the public with word of the plight of the
"multi-billion dollar agricultural industry" should the
Medfly spread. Implicit in all this reporting, and explicit
in-the form taken by the spray program, has been the
sarne "cost-benefit analysis" mentioned above: public
health risks have bowed to pecuniary considerations.

Should more toxic chemicals be needed next spring for
Medfly control, we can expect to hear a repeat.
Malthion spraying is hardly unique in the annals of
governmental actions which endanger the citizenry.
What is more shocking, however, is that clear evidence
of actual harm to people has been ignored or covered
up. Soldiers, in particular, have suffered at the hands of
government. Numerous veterans have died or been in
capacitated by exposure to radiation or chemicals. Most
recently, Vietnam veterans have sought redress for the
effects of the defoliant Agent Orangp Cancer and genet
ic damage have been connected to exposure to Agent
Orange, yet the Veterans Administration has denied all
claims for compensation. In frustration, some veterans
