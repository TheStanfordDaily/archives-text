## Wasteful defense spending senseless 
### 
I sympathize with William Raspberry
in his recent column (Daily, Sept. 28)
on the senselessness of our defense
spending. A rational person cannot
help but feel confused and
bewildered when confronting the
subject of the arms race. Consider
this: when a nuclear bomb is built,
there are but two things that can be
done with it, and both tend to raise
doubts as to the sanity of those who
built it. (1) It can be used in a nuclear
war, an occurence which would de
stroy the planet. (2) It cannot be used,
in which case it is stuck in a hole in
the ground to rot, with the feeble

hope that as it rots it will prevent the
enemy from exercising the first op
tion with is bombs.
The only things more confusing
than the fact that we and the Soviets
actually engage in the arms race is
that we both devote so much energy
to it. The incomprehensible amount
of money, time, resources, and lives
that we and the Soviets have utterly
and totally wasted on the arms race is
without question the single most ri
diculous, insane, stupid thing ever
done in the history of a species that
has never been known for the com

plete utilization of its mental abilities.
Trying to comprehend what we have
wasted, what we have lost forever,
and what we still might do to
ourselves, is impossible; the rational
mind simply cannot deal with con
cepts of such magnitude.
The president of our country, how
ever, does not suffer from this mental
handicap. The present adminis
tration is not concerned by what we
are wasting; rather, it is concerned
that we are not wasting enough. We
are told that the United States has
fallen far behind the Soviets in wast
ing money, time, resources, and
lives, and that if we don't get off our
seats and start doing some serious
wasting, our "Way of Life" will be
threatened.
There is no need to become de
pressed, though, about the mental
health of our president, or about the
increasing chances that someone will
get tired of having their bombs sim
ply rot in holes, and will shoot them
at somebody to see if they work. If
nothing else, we are increasing our
comprehension of the infinite; for
Voltaire once said, "The only way to
understand the mathematical con
cept of infinity is to contemplate the
extent of human stupidity."

Golden Fleece cutesy
Senator William Proxmire's pres
entation of a Golden Fleece award to
NASA's Search for Extra-Terrestrial
Intelligence (5.E.T.1.) program shows
what real setbacks can result when an
influential political figure uses a

"cutesy" gimmick to condemn a pro
gram about which his own under-

standing appears to be considerably
less than adequate, not withstanding
staff briefings to which I would as
sume he was exposed.
The knifing of S.E.T.I. in this ar
rogant manner is politics at its worst.
Quite clearly, it interferes with the
earnest efforts of the House and Sen
ate Appropriations Subcommittees
for HUD and the independent agen
cies to obtain relevant facts in arriv
ing at funding decisions. The Senator
is adding "noise" to the system,
which means less governmental effi
ciency — something to which I, as a
taxpayer, also object. Further, he is
downgrading the morale of talented,
dedicated research people who have
implemented a very significant and
carefully planned program. It is
worth nothing that the work has
progressed at a low-budget level,
two years of the S.E.T.I. effort costing
about the same as one M-1 tank.
As the big daddy of the Golden
Fleece awards, Proxmire has adopted
a posture very parallel to that of
Mephistopheles who explains his

basic makeup to Faust as being the
spirit who always denies or negates. I
sincerely urge the Senator from Wis
consin to concentrate his own talents
on legislative areas where he can
serve the interests of the American
people iri a more positive fashion.

Soccer brutality
We brought a number of Palo Alto
children to the last two soccer games
played by the Stanford soccer team.
Although Stanford won, it was a thor
oughly saddening experience. We
try to teach children the importance
of fair play, but those games showed
us that we have nothing to learn from
them.
Stanford coaches and players seem
to be more interested in winning at
any cost than in playing the game
with skill and with at least some
semblance of respect for the other
players' physical integrity. In both
games Stanford played a brutal game,
clearly intent on crippling the op
poosition.
When such brutal play occurs in a
number of games, the coaches
should be held accountable for such
conduct. We are sure Stanford
should have no difficulty in finding
coaches able to teach that fair play,
fundamental decency, respect for
others, and skill are more important
at any time than a win at any cost at
titude.

The president of our country, how
ever, does not suffer from this mental
handicap. The present adminis
tration is not concerned by what we
are wasting; rather, it is concerned
that we are not wasting enough. We
are told that the United States has
fallen far behind the Soviets in wast
ing money, time, resources, and
lives, and that if we don't get off our
seats and start doing some serious
wasting, our "Way of Life" will be
threatened.
There is no need to become de
pressed, though, about the mental
health of our president, or about the
increasing chances that someone will
get tired of having their bombs sim
ply rot in holes, and will shoot them
at somebody to see if they work. If
nothing else, we are increasing our
comprehension of the infinite; for
Voltaire once said, "The only way to
understand the mathematical con
cept of infinity is to contemplate the
extent of human stupidity."

Golden Fleece cutesy
Senator William Proxmire's pres
entation of a Golden Fleece award to
NASA's Search for Extra-Terrestrial
Intelligence (5.E.T.1.) program shows
what real setbacks can result when an
influential political figure uses a

"cutesy" gimmick to condemn a pro
gram about which his own under-

standing appears to be considerably
less than adequate, not withstanding
staff briefings to which I would as
sume he was exposed.
The knifing of S.E.T.I. in this ar
rogant manner is politics at its worst.
Quite clearly, it interferes with the
earnest efforts of the House and Sen
ate Appropriations Subcommittees
for HUD and the independent agen
cies to obtain relevant facts in arriv
ing at funding decisions. The Senator
is adding "noise" to the system,
which means less governmental effi
ciency — something to which I, as a
taxpayer, also object. Further, he is
downgrading the morale of talented,
dedicated research people who have
implemented a very significant and
carefully planned program. It is
worth nothing that the work has
progressed at a low-budget level,
two years of the S.E.T.I. effort costing
about the same as one M-1 tank.
As the big daddy of the Golden
Fleece awards, Proxmire has adopted
a posture very parallel to that of
Mephistopheles who explains his

basic makeup to Faust as being the
spirit who always denies or negates. I
sincerely urge the Senator from Wis
consin to concentrate his own talents
on legislative areas where he can
serve the interests of the American
people iri a more positive fashion.

Soccer brutality
We brought a number of Palo Alto
children to the last two soccer games
played by the Stanford soccer team.
Although Stanford won, it was a thor
oughly saddening experience. We
try to teach children the importance
of fair play, but those games showed
us that we have nothing to learn from
them.
Stanford coaches and players seem
to be more interested in winning at
any cost than in playing the game
with skill and with at least some
semblance of respect for the other
players' physical integrity. In both
games Stanford played a brutal game,
clearly intent on crippling the op
poosition.
When such brutal play occurs in a
number of games, the coaches
should be held accountable for such
conduct. We are sure Stanford
should have no difficulty in finding
coaches able to teach that fair play,
fundamental decency, respect for
others, and skill are more important
at any time than a win at any cost at
titude.

I sympathize with William Raspberry
in his recent column (Daily, Sept. 28)
on the senselessness of our defense
spending. A rational person cannot
help but feel confused and
bewildered when confronting the
subject of the arms race. Consider
this: when a nuclear bomb is built,
there are but two things that can be
done with it, and both tend to raise
doubts as to the sanity of those who
built it. (1) It can be used in a nuclear
war, an occurence which would de
stroy the planet. (2) It cannot be used,
in which case it is stuck in a hole in
the ground to rot, with the feeble

hope that as it rots it will prevent the
enemy from exercising the first op
tion with is bombs.
The only things more confusing
than the fact that we and the Soviets
actually engage in the arms race is
that we both devote so much energy
to it. The incomprehensible amount
of money, time, resources, and lives
that we and the Soviets have utterly
and totally wasted on the arms race is
without question the single most ri
diculous, insane, stupid thing ever
done in the history of a species that
has never been known for the com

plete utilization of its mental abilities.
Trying to comprehend what we have
wasted, what we have lost forever,
and what we still might do to
ourselves, is impossible; the rational
mind simply cannot deal with con
cepts of such magnitude.
