## Democrats won't switch in '82 
### 
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan may have been prodigiously
far-sighted when, bidding for votes
on his economic measures, he told
some conservative Democrats that
his "principles" would prevent him
from campaigning in 1982 against
those who had been helpful. But he
may be counting chickens that will
not hatch.
Asked by Fortune magazine if his
promise did not make it "almost im
possible" for Republicans to run
against those Democrats, Reagan
said: "Well, that could well be, but
then by the same token, I'd like to
feel that maybe some of those Demo
crats are doing some soul-searching
as to whether they're in the right par
ty."
There are precedents for such
soul-searching. Senators S. I. Hay
akawa, Jesse Helms and Strom
Thurmond, and John Connally and
Reagan, are former Democrats. But
cautionary thoughts come to mind.
The most likely occasion for defec
tions by Democrats is remote, in sev
eral senses. This occasion will not be
1982, but 1984, and then only if Ted
Kennedy is the Democratic nominee.
I have heard a Democratic senator
hinting heavily to community lead
ers back home that he could not run
as a Democrat if the party nominates
Kennedy. Several other senators feel
that way.
Second, the "right party" for con
servative Democrats in 1982 may be a
Democratic Party that is, on the one
hand, not noticeably liberal and, on
the other hand, is not perceived as
implicated in Reagan's economic
program. During the tax and budget

debates, liberal Democrats thought
their party sold its birthright by not
losing with a clear liberal alternative.
But what the party bought with its
conservative alternative was insur
ance against the charge that it has
learned nothing from the difficulties
during the 40-year enactment of the
liberal agenda.
The Reagan administration, by not
trying to split the difference with the
Democrats, and instead winning a
clear partisan victory, saved the
Democrats from sharing responsi
bility for a program that Sen. Howard
Baker calls a "riverboat gamble" — a
program doubted by a financial com
munity that wants to believe in it, a
program that already is enough off
target that the administration is cut
ting its primary responsibility: its de
fense program.
Third, the conservative Democrats
who are supposed to be searching
their souls and contemplating defec
tion know that they do not have
much to fear from staying put, be
cause House races are less likely than
other races to reflect national vol
atilities. Republican gains in 1980
were least dramatic in House elec
tions. Republican gains averaged
nine percentage points in the 34 Sen
ale races, five percentage points
more than 1976 totals in the 13 states
with gubernatorial elections, but an
average of only three percentage
points in the 435 congressional dis
tricts.
Fourth, politicians are not
gamblers, at least not with their own
security. As the President acknowl
edges, his promise not to campaign
against certain Democrats makes un
attractive (to say the least) the posi
tion of Republican challengers to
those Democrats. By remaining
Democrats, those congressman en
joying immunity from presidential

opposition have the double advan
tage of their districts' traditional loy
alties and current conservative sym
pathies.
Furthermore, they do not risk the
danger that switching would make
them seem flighty or more op
portunistic than necessary. So the ra
tional thing is to enjoy the free ride
the President has promised, while
waiting to see what the distant future
(1984) brings.
And what might that future be? In
the Fortune interview, Reagan smote
Wall Street, which is feeling queasy
about his program. He said "business J
leaders are probably a better in- 1
dicator than the people on Broadway
— Broadway, that's a Freudian slip,
isn't it? — (I mean) on Wall Street." It
is unclear on what basis Reagan dist- ■
inguishes between Wall Street and i
"business leaders." In any case, a »
Wall Street Journal survey of business
leaders reveals that they are planning
on the basis of projections more
pessimistic than the President's.
Reagan's core constituency is not
on Wall Street, but on Main Street:
real estate agents, small busi
nessmen. Eighty percent of all savings
and loans are in the red. For every
$10,000 car a dealer buys for his in
ventory and finances at 19 percent,
he pays $158 a month. Since 1978,10
percent of all dealers have gone bust.
In a recent 33-week period, 10,494
businesses failed, 41 percent more
than in a comparable period last year.
It is a massacre on Main Street. So the
administration, by talking about
Democrats switching parties, and de
scribing 1982 as a "ratifying elec
tion," is giving hostages to political
fortune.

tions by Democrats is remote, in sev
eral senses. This occasion will not be
1982, but 1984, and then only if Ted
Kennedy is the Democratic nominee.
I have heard a Democratic senator
hinting heavily to community lead
ers back home that he could not run
as a Democrat if the party nominates
Kennedy. Several other senators feel
that way.
Second, the "right party" for con
servative Democrats in 1982 may be a
Democratic Party that is, on the one
hand, not noticeably liberal and, on
the other hand, is not perceived as
implicated in Reagan's economic
program. During the tax and budget

debates, liberal Democrats thought
their party sold its birthright by not
losing with a clear liberal alternative.
But what the party bought with its
conservative alternative was insur
ance against the charge that it has
learned nothing from the difficulties
during the 40-year enactment of the
liberal agenda.
The Reagan administration, by not
trying to split the difference with the
Democrats, and instead winning a
clear partisan victory, saved the
Democrats from sharing responsi
bility for a program that Sen. Howard
Baker calls a "riverboat gamble" — a
program doubted by a financial com
munity that wants to believe in it, a
program that already is enough off
target that the administration is cut
ting its primary responsibility: its de
fense program.
Third, the conservative Democrats
who are supposed to be searching
their souls and contemplating defec
tion know that they do not have
much to fear from staying put, be
cause House races are less likely than
other races to reflect national vol
atilities. Republican gains in 1980
were least dramatic in House elec
tions. Republican gains averaged
nine percentage points in the 34 Sen
ale races, five percentage points
more than 1976 totals in the 13 states
with gubernatorial elections, but an
average of only three percentage
points in the 435 congressional dis
tricts.
Fourth, politicians are not
gamblers, at least not with their own
security. As the President acknowl
edges, his promise not to campaign
against certain Democrats makes un
attractive (to say the least) the posi
tion of Republican challengers to
those Democrats. By remaining
Democrats, those congressman en
joying immunity from presidential

opposition have the double advan
tage of their districts' traditional loy
alties and current conservative sym
pathies.
Furthermore, they do not risk the
danger that switching would make
them seem flighty or more op
portunistic than necessary. So the ra
tional thing is to enjoy the free ride
the President has promised, while
waiting to see what the distant future
(1984) brings.
And what might that future be? In
the Fortune interview, Reagan smote
Wall Street, which is feeling queasy
about his program. He said "business J
leaders are probably a better in- 1
dicator than the people on Broadway
— Broadway, that's a Freudian slip,
isn't it? — (I mean) on Wall Street." It
is unclear on what basis Reagan dist- ■
inguishes between Wall Street and i
"business leaders." In any case, a »
Wall Street Journal survey of business
leaders reveals that they are planning
on the basis of projections more
pessimistic than the President's.
Reagan's core constituency is not
on Wall Street, but on Main Street:
real estate agents, small busi
nessmen. Eighty percent of all savings
and loans are in the red. For every
$10,000 car a dealer buys for his in
ventory and finances at 19 percent,
he pays $158 a month. Since 1978,10
percent of all dealers have gone bust.
In a recent 33-week period, 10,494
businesses failed, 41 percent more
than in a comparable period last year.
It is a massacre on Main Street. So the
administration, by talking about
Democrats switching parties, and de
scribing 1982 as a "ratifying elec
tion," is giving hostages to political
fortune.

Washington — President Ronald
Reagan may have been prodigiously
far-sighted when, bidding for votes
on his economic measures, he told
some conservative Democrats that
his "principles" would prevent him
from campaigning in 1982 against
those who had been helpful. But he
may be counting chickens that will
not hatch.
Asked by Fortune magazine if his
promise did not make it "almost im
possible" for Republicans to run
against those Democrats, Reagan
said: "Well, that could well be, but
then by the same token, I'd like to
feel that maybe some of those Demo
crats are doing some soul-searching
as to whether they're in the right par
ty."
There are precedents for such
soul-searching. Senators S. I. Hay
akawa, Jesse Helms and Strom
Thurmond, and John Connally and
Reagan, are former Democrats. But
cautionary thoughts come to mind.
