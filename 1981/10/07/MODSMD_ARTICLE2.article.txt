# Egypt's president slain
## 
### Washington Post 
Cairo — President Mohammed
Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian leader
who sought to end three decades of
Arab-Israeli warfare and to make
Egypt a secure ally of the United
States, was killed yesterday by a hail
of bullets fired by soldiers who at
tacked his reviewing stand during a
military parade celebrating Egypt's
bold crossing of the Suez' Canal in
1973.
Vice President Hosni Mubarak,
who immediately succeeded Sadat as
the effective ruler of the country, an
nounced Sadat's death shortly before
8 p.m. in Cairo (2 p.m. EDT) and de
clared that Egypt would honor all of
the agreements made by Sadat, pre
sumably including the 1978 peace
treaty negotiated with Israel at Camp
David.
Three of the Egyptian soldiers who
assassinated Sadat were reportedly
killed on the parade grounds in the
Cairo suburb of Nasr City, where the
attack occurred. At least three others
were reported to have been cap
tured, but there was no indication
from Egyptian authorities late last

night that they had discovered the
reasons behind the assassination
plot.
Eight other persons on the review
ing stand, including government of
ficials and foreign diplomats, were
killed in the attack, according to po
lice sources, and 27 others were in
jured.
Visibly bleeding but apparently
still alive, the 62-year-old Egyptian
leader was rushed by helicopter from
the parade grounds to a military hos
pital at Maadi, near the capital.
Sadat arrived at Maadi at 1:20 p.m.
(7:20 a.m. EDT) in a coma with no de
tectable heartbeat and with blood
gushing from his mouth, according
to a medical bulletin released by the
hospital.
Doctors tried desperately to save
the president's life by administering
artificial respiration, heart massage,
blood transfusions and injections
directly into the heart. An hour and
20 minutes later, when the heart had
still not responded, and no brain ac
tivity could be detected, the doctors
pronounced Sadat dead.
There were conflicting initial re
ports on the affiliation of the'as
sailants, believed to have numbered
six, who were dressed in Egyptian
Army uniforms. Anonymous lele
phone-callers to news agencies in
Beirut said that an extremist Egyptian
exile group linked to Libyan leader
Moammar Quadaffi claimed credit
for the shooting. But unofficial Army
sources said they believed the at
tackers were part of a rightist Moslem
organization that was a target of a ma
jor government crackdown last
month.
The government made no com
ment on the identity of the assailants.
Sadat's death seemed certain to
have major repercussions not only
inside a shaken Egypt but throughout
the Middle East.
Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for
his historic 1977 trip to Jerusalem and
subsequent treaty with Israel, Sadat
had single-handedly turned the
course of Egyptian politics away from
war and toward peace with Cairo's
No. 1 enemy.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, in Jerusalem, emotionally
mourned the loss of "one of the great
fighters for peace in our generation/'
and public statements of shock and
sadness poured from Western capi
tals.
In Washington, President Ronald
Reagan said that "America has lost a
close friend. The world has lost a
great statesman, and mankind has

lost a champion of peace."
Sadat's peace-making with Israel,
however, had turned most of the rad
ical Arab and Islamic world bitterly
against him, and from Iran to Libya
his death was hailed as righteous ven
geance against a traitor.
In a calm and somber speech to the
nation, recorded following an emer
gency Cabinet meeting, Mubarak,
53, said that Sufi Abu Taleb, speaker
of the National Assembly, would
serve as interim president until elec
tions to be held within 60 days, as
stipulated by the Egyptian Constitu
tion. Mubarak was named chief of
staff of the armed forces and was im
mediately nominated by the ruling
National Democratic Party as its pres
idential candidate.
Mubarak called Sadat "a martyr to
peace" and pledged the Egyptian
government would abide by all the
treaties and agreements entered into
during his 11-year presidency, pre
sumably including the peace agree
ment with Israel and the U.S.-spon
sored Camp David accords.
During the two-hour military spec
tacular, Sadat had appeared relaxed,
even jovial, and was seen at times
smoking his pipe. There was no in
dication he expected any trouble to
occur during the parade, which
marked the eighth anniversary of the
initial Egyptian offensive during the
war in 1973 in which Israel eventually
defeated Egypt.

his death was hailed as righteous ven
geance against a traitor.
In a calm and somber speech to the
nation, recorded following an emer
gency Cabinet meeting, Mubarak,
53, said that Sufi Abu Taleb, speaker
of the National Assembly, would
serve as interim president until elec
tions to be held within 60 days, as
stipulated by the Egyptian Constitu
tion. Mubarak was named chief of
staff of the armed forces and was im
mediately nominated by the ruling
National Democratic Party as its pres
idential candidate.
Mubarak called Sadat "a martyr to
peace" and pledged the Egyptian
government would abide by all the
treaties and agreements entered into
during his 11-year presidency, pre
sumably including the peace agree
ment with Israel and the U.S.-spon
sored Camp David accords.
During the two-hour military spec
tacular, Sadat had appeared relaxed,
even jovial, and was seen at times
smoking his pipe. There was no in
dication he expected any trouble to
occur during the parade, which
marked the eighth anniversary of the
initial Egyptian offensive during the
war in 1973 in which Israel eventually
defeated Egypt.
Cairo — President Mohammed
Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian leader
who sought to end three decades of
Arab-Israeli warfare and to make
Egypt a secure ally of the United
States, was killed yesterday by a hail
of bullets fired by soldiers who at
tacked his reviewing stand during a
military parade celebrating Egypt's
bold crossing of the Suez' Canal in
1973.
Vice President Hosni Mubarak,
who immediately succeeded Sadat as
the effective ruler of the country, an
nounced Sadat's death shortly before
8 p.m. in Cairo (2 p.m. EDT) and de
clared that Egypt would honor all of
the agreements made by Sadat, pre
sumably including the 1978 peace
treaty negotiated with Israel at Camp
David.
Three of the Egyptian soldiers who
assassinated Sadat were reportedly
killed on the parade grounds in the
Cairo suburb of Nasr City, where the
attack occurred. At least three others
were reported to have been cap
tured, but there was no indication
from Egyptian authorities late last

night that they had discovered the
reasons behind the assassination
plot.
Eight other persons on the review
ing stand, including government of
ficials and foreign diplomats, were
killed in the attack, according to po
lice sources, and 27 others were in
jured.
Visibly bleeding but apparently
still alive, the 62-year-old Egyptian
leader was rushed by helicopter from
the parade grounds to a military hos
pital at Maadi, near the capital.
Sadat arrived at Maadi at 1:20 p.m.
(7:20 a.m. EDT) in a coma with no de
tectable heartbeat and with blood
gushing from his mouth, according
to a medical bulletin released by the
hospital.
Doctors tried desperately to save
the president's life by administering
artificial respiration, heart massage,
blood transfusions and injections
directly into the heart. An hour and
20 minutes later, when the heart had
still not responded, and no brain ac
tivity could be detected, the doctors
pronounced Sadat dead.
There were conflicting initial re
ports on the affiliation of the'as
sailants, believed to have numbered
six, who were dressed in Egyptian
Army uniforms. Anonymous lele
phone-callers to news agencies in
Beirut said that an extremist Egyptian
exile group linked to Libyan leader
Moammar Quadaffi claimed credit
for the shooting. But unofficial Army
sources said they believed the at
tackers were part of a rightist Moslem
organization that was a target of a ma
jor government crackdown last
month.
The government made no com
ment on the identity of the assailants.
Sadat's death seemed certain to
have major repercussions not only
inside a shaken Egypt but throughout
the Middle East.
Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for
his historic 1977 trip to Jerusalem and
subsequent treaty with Israel, Sadat
had single-handedly turned the
course of Egyptian politics away from
war and toward peace with Cairo's
No. 1 enemy.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, in Jerusalem, emotionally
mourned the loss of "one of the great
fighters for peace in our generation/'
and public statements of shock and
sadness poured from Western capi
tals.
In Washington, President Ronald
Reagan said that "America has lost a
close friend. The world has lost a
great statesman, and mankind has

lost a champion of peace."
Sadat's peace-making with Israel,
however, had turned most of the rad
ical Arab and Islamic world bitterly
against him, and from Iran to Libya
his death was hailed as righteous ven
geance against a traitor.
