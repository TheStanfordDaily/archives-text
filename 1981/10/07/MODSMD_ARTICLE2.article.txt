Cairo â€” President Mohammed
Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian leader
who sought to end three decades of
Arab-Israeli warfare and to make
Egypt a secure ally of the United
States, was killed yesterday by a hail
of bullets fired by soldiers who at
tacked his reviewing stand during a
military parade celebrating Egypt's
bold crossing of the Suez' Canal in
1973.
Vice President Hosni Mubarak,
who immediately succeeded Sadat as
the effective ruler of the country, an
nounced Sadat's death shortly before
8 p.m. in Cairo (2 p.m. EDT) and de
clared that Egypt would honor all of
the agreements made by Sadat, pre
sumably including the 1978 peace
treaty negotiated with Israel at Camp
David.
Three of the Egyptian soldiers who
assassinated Sadat were reportedly
killed on the parade grounds in the
Cairo suburb of Nasr City, where the
attack occurred. At least three others
were reported to have been cap
tured, but there was no indication
from Egyptian authorities late last

night that they had discovered the
reasons behind the assassination
plot.
Eight other persons on the review
ing stand, including government of
ficials and foreign diplomats, were
killed in the attack, according to po
lice sources, and 27 others were in
jured.
Visibly bleeding but apparently
still alive, the 62-year-old Egyptian
leader was rushed by helicopter from
the parade grounds to a military hos
pital at Maadi, near the capital.
Sadat arrived at Maadi at 1:20 p.m.
(7:20 a.m. EDT) in a coma with no de
tectable heartbeat and with blood
gushing from his mouth, according
to a medical bulletin released by the
hospital.
Doctors tried desperately to save
the president's life by administering
artificial respiration, heart massage,
blood transfusions and injections
directly into the heart. An hour and
20 minutes later, when the heart had
still not responded, and no brain ac
tivity could be detected, the doctors
pronounced Sadat dead.
