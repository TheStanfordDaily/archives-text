Mathematical sciences ma
jors have recently encountered
something everyone would
probably like to contend with:
increasing popularity. While
the number of math sciences
majors at Stanford has re
mained constant-about 70- for
several years, graduates of the
program are meeting with
rapidly expanding career op
portunities.
Despite these abundant op
portunities, the math sciences
major here has remained rela
tively anonymous in past years.
In an effort to change this, the
University has pledged greater
support to the program .
The program'sexpansion, in
itiated by the dean's office of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, entails the opening
of an administrative office in
Sequoia Hall and the appoint
ment of Statistics Prof. Bradley
Efron as permanent chairman.
The 10-year old program is
jointly sponsored by the De
partments of Computer Sci
ence, Mathematics, Opera
tions Research, and Statistics.
Founded in 1971 by Pro
fessors Paul Berg, mathematics,

John Harriot computer sci
ence, Rupert Miller, statistics,
and Arthur Veinott, operations
research, the program's popu
larity has increased due to the
strong job market for applied
mathematicians. However the
major also includes many stu
dents heading for professional
and graduate schools.
Last year, about half the
graduates joined technological
corporations and most of the
rest went on to graduate study.
According to Efron, "One of
the strange things about the
program is that all of the stu
dents like it."
The math sciences major
consists of a core sequence in
mathematics, introductory se
quences in each of the other
participating departments, and
elective courses from any of
the math sciences. All four
sponsoring departments are
highly-ranked nationally, yet
only mathematics offers an un
dergraduate major.
"The program," says Efron,
"serves as a convenience to op
erations research, computer
science, and statistics, which
don't have to run separate pro
grams."
