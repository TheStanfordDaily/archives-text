# Presidential libraries' attendance declining
## 
### 
Boston (AP) — After a summer of wor
ried head-counting, the two-year-old
John F. Kennedy Library will welcome vis
itor number 1 million through the turnstile
this month. The reason for concern was a
steep decline in attendance.
Officials at the prestigious archives claim
the decrease was inevitable after the ex
citement of the first 12 months, starting
Oct. 21,1979. But the dip was sharp — and
part of a trend at all six presidential librar
ies, which house official memos and cor
respondence and serve as museums of po
litical memorabilia.
The federal government, which man
ages the facilities, is well aware of the at

tendance problem — even amid fanfare
for the opening of Gerald Ford's non-li
brary museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., last
month and even as Richard Nixon lobbies
hard to win a home for his personal papers
at Duke University.
"We're not in the business of promoting
presidential libraries. We just make them
available. But our concern comes from loss
of revenue," says John Fawcett, super
visory archivist of the General Services Ad
ministration's office of presidential librar
ies in Washington.
Viitors pay admission fees of 50 cents to
75 cents. But a substantial decline in atten
dance costs the federal government mon
ey and raises questions about a general

lack of interest in presidential memo
rabilia.
The library and museum attracted
almost 600,000 visitors in 1979-80. But
1980-81 attendance may be just 400,000 de
spite a summer rush, according to Frank
Rigg, director of visitor services.
The 1981 figures — possibly affected by
stable gasoline prices encouraging vaca
tion travel — are not yet available.
Fenn says the library-museum "seeks to
give people a sense of (Kennedy's) times."
He predicts a gradual revival of interest in
other presidential libraries, especially the
papers of Hoover, whose conservative
banner is now carried by Ronald Reagan.
