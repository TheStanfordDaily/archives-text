# Reborn B—1 creating jobs

### Washington Post 
El Segundo, Calif. — Little
more than 24 hours after Presi
dent Ronald Reagan revived
the B-1 bomber, job seekers
began gathering in the parking
lot next to the beige, win
dowless buildings of Rockwell
International, each person de
termined to be first when hir-

ln the midst of talk of welfare cuts and
impending recession, Southern
California tasted the first sweet juices
of the Reagan economy.

ing began Monday morning
for the bomber's assembly line.
By the time Glen Murphy, 26,
an umemployed chef from
nearby Culver City, arrived
Monday, the line that started
Saturday night spilled onto Im
perial Highway a block away.
"At first I didn't believe it, but I
came down to see," Murphy
said. "Maybe, when you bal
ance it out, Reagan isn't so
bad."
In the midst of talk of welfare
cuts and impending recession,
Southern California tasted the
first sweet juices of the Reagan
economy. By noon, Rockwell
had processed more than 3400
job applicants and handed ap
plications to 2000 more, all
drawn by the company's prom
ise to hire 11,000 new employ
ees by 1987 to build the 100
bombers ordered by the presi
dent.
The Bank of America's eco
nomic outlook report, just
published, predicts that Cali
fornia will receive $19.6 billion
in military contracts in 1982, a
20 percent increase over 1981.
The contracts will include
missiles, aircraft parts, ships,
electronic machinery and mili
tary research, but the born
again B-1 bomber is the new
star attraction, worth an esti
mated $10 billion in businessall
by itself.
A huge blue-and-white ban

ner, clearly visible to busy traf
fic on Imperial Highway and
Aviation Boulevard, directed
job seekers to the Rockwell In
ternational employment office
Monday. They lined up pa
tiently, mostly men in their 20s,
and a fairly even mix of blacks
and whites. "I've never seen
anything like this, not even

when they first announced the
bomber contract before Carter
canceled it," said Lt. Robert
Newton, a Rockwell security
officer who kept the crowd or
derly through the weekend
and at Monday morning's 7
a.m. opening.
Gloria Lewis, 29, sat on the
sidewalk holding the 2-month
old daughter of a friend who
was inside signing up for an in
terview. Next it would be Lew
is' turn to file into the company
headquarters, sprawling over
concrete-covered land just
southeast of Los Angeles In
ternational Airport.
Rockwell was offering in
terviews to lathe operators, de
signers, riggers, clerical and
janitorial workers and dozens
of other job categories. But
Lewis, unemployed for a year,
said she would settle for "any
thing, anything that's going to
pay."
Rockwell first won the con
tract for the B-1, a new bomber
specially designed for very low,
rapid flight to fool Soviet radar,
in 1970. By 1977 it was gearing
up to build 244 planes. Then
President Jimmy Carter, decid
ing the B-1 was too expensive
and too likely to be overtaken
by new technology, cancelled
the project, bringing "com
plete astonishment" to El
Segundo, Rockwell regional
communications director Earl
Blount recalled. "It was very

unexpected," he said, and 8000
employees had to be laid os.
almost immediately.
The company employs about
30,000 people now in Southern
California, many working oji,
projects related to the
shuttle, but will expand their
workforce by a third for the
B-1. A total of 22,000 new peo
ple will be hired throughout
the country because of the
bomber, Blount said.
In El Segundo, B-1 jobs wjll
increase from 1600 now to 8500
by 1987. Another 4000 jobs wiii'
be added in Palmdale, on the
northern edge of Los Angeles
County, where an 8000-square
foot assembly and checkout
building will be constructed to
put together parts from all ov6r
the country into as many a« #
four new aircraft a month. To
make those parts, a Rockwell
plant in Tulsa, Oka., will hire
about 2000 new workers and a
Columbus, Ohio, facility abouj
-7000.
t
Boeing Co., which may lose.
more than $10 billion in con-'
tracts because of the cancella
tion of plans to build a "race
track" for MX missiles in Utah
and Nevada, will keep a con
tract to provide avionics inte-.
gration for the B-1. Rockwelf
remains one of the leading
builders of the' MX missile
itself, which will be con
structed under a new basing
plan announced by Reagan
day.
The new bomber contract
could not have come a mo
ment too soon for Southern
California, whose
companies have suffered frcsr
the slump in the airline in
dustry. But industry officials
said much of the new militajk
contract money, perhaps
percent, will go to subcontrac
tors in places like
Springs, Col., or Grants Pa§,
Ore., vyhere housing costs
not «o high and skilled
easier to locate.
