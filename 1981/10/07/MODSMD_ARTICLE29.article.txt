## Wall Street might not be able to pull out of rut 
### 
New York (AP) — Wall Street seems to
have been caught at an old habit, that of talk
ing a better game than it plays, and Coach
Reagan is upset. His pep talks don't seem to
work. Wall Street just can't seem to score.
Oh, it talks about scoring. Any day of the
week you can interview an analyst who ex
pects his favorite dozens stocks to soar, and
you can even find a few who are talking
about a 2000-point Dow jones average.
People on Wall Street even send letters of
support to the president, tefling him how he
has saved capitalism from disaster. And some
have publicly advertised their undying sup
port. But money's another thing.
Why has the investment community failed
to risk money on rebuilding America? Why
have the stock market averages failed to rise
along with the rhetoric? How can there be
such a split between words and action?
Some possibilities present themselves.
1. Investors really don't believe. They ap
prove of spending cuts and the return of
power to the private sector, but they ques
tion whether it is possible without severe fi
nancial and social upheavals first.
2. Few seem willing to take risks. In every
investment there is risk, but some institu
tional investors today seem to be waiting for
the sure thing. They seem to prefer riskless

mediocrity. They act timid. "We're not look
ing for big gains/' they say. "We're happy if
we stay even."
3. The short-term syndrome is everywhere
about us. Tax-free certificates for 15 months.
Three-year home mortgages. Money market
mutual funds that are liquid and so allow you
to jump into other investments if they ap
pear at the moment to offer something
more. The country seems unable to handle
long-term investments. It is playing safe, for
now at least.
4. Just blame it all on interest rates. Why in
vest in stocks and other equities when debt
securities offer such high returns? Why in
vest in a new plant when the cost of borrow
ing shrinks or devours future profits?
5. Investors and business people haven't
fully appreciated the new tax incentives pro
vided to them. Rehabilitate a 40-year-old
factory, for example, and take an income tax
credit of 20 percent of the cost. Depreciate a
structure in just 15 years, rather than 25 years
or more.
Whatever the reason — and there may be
some of all these reasons and many others
too — the behavior of the moment isn't the
kind that built the great American economy.
Or that that can rebuild it, either.
