Fifty-three year-old Egyptian Vice
President Hosni Mubarak has a repu
tation as a fighter and a diplomat, but
has stood in the late President Anwar
Sadat's political shadow for six years.
It is widely believed that if
Mubarak can consolidate his posi
tion as de facto head of Egypt, he will
be able to govern with a coalition of
religious military and secularist
groups.
Egypt's head of parliament, Sufi
Abu Taleb, was named by Mubarak
to be acting President until elections
are held in December. According to
Hoover Fellow Seymour Martin
Lipset, Taleb is an older man and not
considered likely to be a long-term
leader.
After a meeting yesterday of the
ruling National Democratic Party,
Mubarak became the first official
candidate for the presidency.
But Mubarak will first have to con
tend with strong opposition from
pan-Arab forces, as well as the pow
erful Egyptian military and Moslem
fundamentalists.
"He's a former Air Force pilot who
was very popular with his troops, but
he has no reputation as a politician,"
said Hoover Fellow Eric Davis, a visit
ing specialist in Islamic revivalism.
Although Mubarak probably was
not previously seen as a serious con
tender for the presidency, Davis said,
"Sadat wasn't either in 1970. But
Sadat had more political experience
and savvy."
According to a member of Stan
ford's Arab Student Association, ex
iled Lt. Gen. Saadeddin Chazli, "or
someone of his stature,"would be a
strong contender if free elections
were held in Egypt. Chazli is the head
of one group that claimed responsi
bility for the assassination.

The Arab source said Mubarak is
"not popular in Egypt," explaining
that any strong competitor for the
presidency would probably be "liq
uidated" before the elections.
The man who declared a year-long
state of emergency yesterday
pledged to the ruling National Dem
ocratic Party to pursue peace talks
with Israel and successfully conclude
Palestinian autonomy negotiations
early next year, according to The
Washington Post.
As Sadat's vice president since
1975, Mubarak has been groomed for
the presidency through international
diplomatic missions. He has taken a
key role in sensitive negotiations in
the Middle East and is respected as an
accomplished diplomat.
According to The Los Angeles
Times, Mubarak has met nearly every
major world leader, as well as cul
tivated close personal ties with sever
al Arab leaders.
Mubarak visited the United States
last week to request military aid for
Sudan. Egypt's neighbor wants help
to defend itself against possible
harassment by Libya.
Mubarak has visited the Soviet
Union often, and was a leader in the
move to expel Soviet technicians and
loosen Egyptian ties with the
Kremlin, a Post story said.
A pilot trained in the Soviet Union,
Mubarak was head of Egypt's Air
Force during the October 1973 war
with Israel, as well as Sadat's envoy to
Arab countries after the Camp David
accords were signed in 1979.
According to the Post report,
Mubarak issued a warning to the So
viet Union before coming to Wash
ington, cautioning against in
terference in Sudan, Somalia or
Oman. Mubarak said any aggression
against the three Egyptian allies
would be "confronted firmly."
