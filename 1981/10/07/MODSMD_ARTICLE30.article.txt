# Loaning of air controllers causing military shortage
## 
### 
Dayton, Ohio (AP) — The use of Air
Force controllers to fill the spaces left
by striking civilian air traffic controllers
is having an adverse impact on military
installations across the country, ac
cording to a U.S. Air Force report.
The unclassified report, obtained by
The Dayton Daily News through
sources in the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization, said the use
of military controllers "severely lim
it(s) this command's ability to provide
essential services to the USAF flying
mission."
Military controllers have been in the
civilian towers almost since the start of
the two-month-old PATCO strike, re
placing the striking controllers who
were fired by President Ronald Rea
gan.
The document stated, for example,
that Springfield Municipal Airport's
tower could be closed and Wright-Pat
terson Air Force Base's tower opera
tions could be reduced from 24 hours
to 16 hours a day and from seven to six
days a week as a result of the strike.
Air Force officials, however, such
such reductions would occur only un
der the worst possible conditions, and
such ' worst —case" planning docu

merits are common to every situation.
"This is a contingency plan based on
an absolute worst-case basis," said
Capt. Ron Rand, a spokesman for
Alton Keel, assistant secretary of the
Air Force. "None of this has come to
pass yet."
The report, issued by the USAF
Communications Command, de
scribes the impact on about 70 Air
Force installations across the country
from the use of 635 Air Force con
trollers. It also predicts what would
happen if an additional 635 Air Force
controllers are needed to fill in for the
12,000 striking civilian traffic con
trollers.
According to the report, if that many
were needed, "widespread curtail
ment of services would be required
since ail (continental U.S.) bases would
be below standard minimum staffing
levels." The report urges that no addi
tional military controllers be called
upon to replace the strikers.
Currently, 425 Air Force, 150 Navy
and 200 Army controllers are staffing
civilian airporttowers.
The crisis was caused by the PATCO
strike that severely cut the number of
trained controllers on the job.
