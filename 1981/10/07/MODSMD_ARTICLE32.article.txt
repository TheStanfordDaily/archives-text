## UCLA's Donahue still wary of 0-4 Cardinals 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — UCLA Coach Terry
Donahue admits to being surprised that Stan
ford hasn't won a football game at this stage of
the season. He hopes that the Cardinals' woes
continue for at least one more week.
"Stanford's a very good team, I know that
sounds crazy, but they are," Donahue said Mon
day at his weekly meeting with reporters.
"When you have skilled players like Stanford
has, if they have a good day you're in trouble up
to your neck."
The 16th-ranked Bruins and the winless
Cardinals square off Saturday in a Pacific-10
Conference game at Palo Alto, a location where
UCLA has seldom had an easy time winning.
Donahue doesn't expect it to be any different
this time around.
"I think the Stanford athlete has an ability in
two or three games a year to play better than he's
ever played," said Donahue. "It's usually that
way against UCLA, USC and another opponent.
"They sure get up for big games, they have
traditionally. I sure hope we'll be up, this is a very
important game for us."
The Bruins are 1-0 in Pac-10 play and 3-1 over
all, while the Cardinals are 0-1 in the league — a
17-13 loss at Arizona last Saturday night — and
0-4 on the year.
Donahue has been one of the biggest boosters
of Stanford quarterback John Elway in the past,
and despite the problems experienced this sea
son by the Cardinals' signal-caller, the UCLA
coach hasn't changed his tune.
"It's my opinion that John Elway is the best
quarterback in college football today, at least
he's the best I've seen," said Donahue. "I
haven't seen them all, but I've seen a lot of

them."
Elway has been bothered by an ankle injury
since early in the season, but Donahue doesn't
feel Elway will be hampered much against the
Bruins.
"He appeared to be a lot better physically
against Arizona, he just had a bad night," said
Donahue. "I'm sure he'll be ready for us. In or
der for us to be successful against Stanford,
we're going to have to put pressure on Elway.
"I don't know about all the problems they've
had. Problems with a passing game don't just in
volve the quarterback. There are a lot of other
things involved, the receivers, the offensive
line."
The Bruins bounced back from their disaster
at lowa on Sept. 26, a 20-7 loss, to what Donahue
called "our best performance for four quarters
this season" last Saturday, a 27-7 triumph over
Colorado.
"We moved the ball extremely well but let
Colorado stay alive for quite some time due to
our lack of scoring punch," said Donahue. "But
basically, it was a good comeback from the lowa
game.
"All things considered, you take the whole
kicking game, the way our offense moved the
ball, the way the defense played, it was certainly
our best performance. Our punter had the best
game of his career." t
The final remark was made in jest because
punter Kevin Buenafe wasn't called upon once,
such was the effectiveness of the UCLA offense.
"We're going to have to continue to play real
good defense," said Donahue. "We know what
Stanford is capable of doing."
