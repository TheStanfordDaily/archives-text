# Frazier comeback
## 
### 
New York (AP) — It has
been five years and quite a
few pounds since his last
fight, but Joe Frazier is ready
to climb between the ropes
again and return to the ring.
The former heavyweight
champion, now 37 years old
.and weighing 237 pounds,
says he'll fight undefeated
Monte Masters sometime
after November 15, either in
Atlantic City, N.J., or Okla
homa.
"Fighting is my business,"
Frazier said Monday. "I nev
er left. I just put it aside and
rested it a little. It's been
there all along."
Since being knocked out
by George Foreman June 15,
1976, Frazier has been de
voting his time to the boxing
development of his sons,
Marvis and Rodney. Both
were on hand to endorse
their father's comeback.
"I want to show these
young men what the old
man is all about," Frazier
said. "I'm coming back be
cause I was the champ. I
want to show them how to
be champ. Just having the
belt around your waist, that
doesn't make you champ all
the time. You've got to walk
down the street the right
way."
That doesn't mean that

Frazier sees Masters as a step
on the road to another title
bid. He's not thinking that
far ahead right now.
"I don't put anything
ahead of Monte Masters,"
he said. "To me, every fight
is a championship fight.
We'll stay on the subject,
concentrate on him and not
look past him. I know I'm
capable of beating anybody
from 1 to 10."
But when Frazier decided
he wanted to fight again and
started looking for potential
opponents, the only cus
tomers he could find were
Masters and Scott LeDoux.
The LeDoux match could
not be finalized, so Masters,
who is the brother-in-law of
former World Boxing As
sociation lightweight
champ Sean O'Grady, got
the assignment.
"I'm fighting him to gain
respect and world recogni
tion," said Masters, who has
won 22 consecutive fights,
19 of them by knockout. "I
want to prove to the world
that I can fight."
Frazier said working in his
gym every day with Marvis
and Rodney had given him
the incentive to come back.
"If I work in the gym ev
ery day, teaching them, I
feel I should be out
doing the job."
