# A's take first game of AL East mini-series
## 
### 
Kansas City, Mo. (AP) â€” Ev
eryone agreed there were two
key plays in the A's 4-0 shutout
over Kansas City yesterday, and
Oakland's Wayne Gross, who
figured prominently in both, is
ready to pronounce the Royals
dead.
"We just beat their best
pitcher," said Gross, who hit a
three-run home run off right
hander Dennis Leonard and
turned an inning-ending,
bases-loaded double play.
"We're not going out of here
1-1. They've got to beat us
three out of four, and I don't
think they can do that," Gross
said.
With Mike Norris hand
cuffing the Royals on four sin
gles, including two bunts,
Gross's three-run home run in
the fourth inning was more
than enough for the A's to take
the opener of this best-of-five
American League West
Division series.
"I hit the home run because
Leonard threw a fastball up and
over the plate," he said. "I
didn't think the ball was going
out of the park. I was about half
way to second when the ball
disappeared. I thought, 'Hmm,
that's interesting.'"
All three runs were un
earned after George Brett
made a bad throw on Tony
Armas' ground ball for what
would have been the third out.

"Anytime I see a ball hit to
George Brett, I think, 'George
can throw that one away,'"
Gross said wrth a grin. "That's
nothing against George. They
say the same things about me. I
just went up there looking for a
fastball to pull."
The Royals had the bases
loaded with one out in the fifth
when Frank White hit a smash
line drive straight at Gross who
easily threw to second base for
a double play.
"We had a chance to score at
least two there, but it didn't
work out that way," said Kansas
City Manager Dick Howser.
"Our guy pitched well enough
to win. This is basically the
same club that went to the
World Series last year, and we'll
be very disappointed if we
don't go back."
Leonard, who had shut out
the A's the two previous times
he faced them this season, sur
rendered only seven hits in his
eight innings' work.
Dwayne Murphy hit a 3-2
pitch for a solo home run with
one out in the eighth. It was the
first earned run the A's had
managed against Leonard in
251-3 innings.
With one out in the Oakland
fourth, Murphy drew a walk,
the first given up by Leonard.
After Keith Drumright
grounded out, Tony Armas hit

a sharp grounder to Brett,
whose throw bounced in the
dirt. First baseman Willie
Aikens was unable to keep the
ball in his glove and both
runners were safe.
Then Gross, who hit only .206
for the season, slammed a
Leonard 2-1 fastball over the
right-field fence, aided by a
strong wind. Leonard, 13-11 for
the season, had retired eight
straight batters until walking
Murphy.
Norris, who won his first six
decisions of the year and fin
ished 12-9, consistently hand
cuffed the Royals with an array
of offspeed deliveries. He
struck out two and walked
three.
The Royals, who won the
second-half division title but
finished the season 50-53 to be
come the only sub-.500 team in
the playoffs, squandered scor
ing opportunities in the third
and fifth innings.
Clint Hurdle walked leading
off the third, then Norris threw
wildly to second base when
John Wathan attempted a
sacrfice bunt. Both runners
were safe. One out later, Willie
Wilson bunted safely to load
the bases, but Norris got Frank
White to ground to third
baseman Gross, who got an
easy force out of Hurdle at
home. Brett then ended the in

ning with a fly ball to shallow
center.
Hurdle singled leading off
the fifth, Wathan walked and
U.L. Washington bunted safely
to load the bases with none
out. Again, however, Norris es
caped. He got Wilson on an in
field pop up. Then White hit a
line drive straight at Gross, who
turned and doubled Wathan
off second base.
The Royals got a big scare in
the fourth when Brett and
Wilson, two of their best run
producers, ran into each other
chasing a pop foul and col
lapsed in a heap. After Gross'
home run, Jim Spencer
doubled off the right field
fence, then Mike Heath hit a
high pop foul. Brett and Wilson
collided at the fence behind
third base. Both stayed down
several minutes while worried
teammates and team officials
hovered over them.
Both got up and resumed
play. Leonard then got out of
the inning by striking out
Heath.

The Dodgers, however, were
riot too special for Ashby to de
liver his two-run shot that
broke a 1-1 deadlock and gave
the Astros a 1-0 lead in the best
of-five National League
Western Division series. The
second game is scheduled for
this afternoon with Houston's
joe Niekro facing Los Angeles's
Jerry Reuss.
Ashby and Ryan, who
pitched a record-breaking fifth
career no-hitter Sept. 26
against the Dodgers, were an
unbeatable combination.
Ryan, the NL's earned run
leader, retired 16 Dodgers in a
row prior to Steve Garvey's sev
enth-inning home run that tied
the score at 1-1. Ryan then re
tired the final seven batters in
order to set the stage for
Ashby's two-out blast.
Stewart took over for
Dodger starter Fernando
Valenzuela in the ninth.
"It wasn't a bad pitch," Stew
art said. "I thought it was a
good fastball, over and in. I
didn't think he'd jack the ball
out of the park. I didn't even
know who it was. For one
thing, I can't see losing one like
this. They're not a home run
hitting team, but I guess every
team has some luck."
Dodger Manager Tommy
LaSorda,agonizingover having
only three Dodger baserun
ners, said of Ryan: "He looked
liked he had just as good a
curve ball as in the no-hitter.
He was very, very tough and
very dominating tonight.
When you can only get three
men on base..."
Stewart struck out Cesar
Cedeno to start the ninth and
then got Art Howe on a fly ball
to Ken Landreaux in center
field.
But pinch-hitter Graig Rey
nolds then hit a single to shal
low center field before Ashby
came on and hit the first pitch
thrown to him by Stewart into
the Astrodome's mezzanine
level.
Ryan finished with seven
strikeouts and allowed only a
first-inning single by Land
reaux and Steve Garvey's sev
enth-inning home run.
