Houston (AP) â€” Houston
catcher Alan Ashby lived out a
Walter Mitty dream, floating
around the bases with the
game-winning home run, and
Nolan Ryan almost duplicated
his no-hit feat last night as the
Astros rallied to a 3-1 playoff
victory over the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
"It sounds kind of bad for a
guy who hit only four home
runs in the regular season to
say he was thinking about a
home run," said Ashby, who
hit the first pitch by Dodger re
liever Dave Stewart with two
out in the ninth inning. "It was
kind of like a Walter Mitty
dream for me.
"I grew up in San Pedro
(Calif.) idolizing the Dodgers. I
was too slow to sneak in, but I
enjoy playing aginst them now.
They are still a special team to
me."
