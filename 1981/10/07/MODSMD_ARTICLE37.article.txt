Oakland (AP) — Oakland
Raider Coach Tom Flores, his
team the victim of two straight
shutout losses, says he may
shake up his lineup for Sun
day's National Football League
game at Kansas City.
"I'm not sure what changes
I'll make, but there could be
one or two," said Flores. "I
don't know if there is anyone
safe on our offense. I don't
want to answer that because I
don't know if I could answer it
honestly."
Flores indicated the Raiders
may activate rookie lineman
Curt Marsh, who has been side
lined with a rib injury. Rumors
have it Marsh may be
earmarked to replace veteran
left guard Gene Upshaw.
Flores also said rookie Ted
Watts will field some punts
Sunday instead of Ira Mat
thews, who fumbled three
times against the Broncos.
Ira is still our returner...but
we'll give Watts more of a shot
this week," said Flores."
The changes will not include
quarterback Jim Plunkett, but
Flores said he may go to sec
ond-year backup Marc Wilson
if Plunkett falters.
"Jim will be our starter on
Sunday. We might make a

change during the game if
things aren't going well," said
Flores. "You never know. A dif
ferent quarterback can get the
team going in a different direc
tion sometimes."
Plunkett, who led the Raid
ers to victory in the Super Bowl
last January, completed just 13
of 20 pass attempts for 115 yards
in last Sunday's 17-0 loss to
Denver. The week before, he
passed for 102 yards in a 16-0
loss to Detroit.
Across the Bay, placekicker
Matt Bahr, who played with the
San Francisco 49ers for four
games filling in for injured Ray
Wersching, was traded to
Cleveland yesterday.
The 49ers announced that
Wersching, who suffered a hip
injury in the first game of the
National Football League regu
lar season, is eligible to be reac
tivated for Sunday's game
against Dallas.
The Browns gave up a future
draft choice for Bahr.
The 49ers announced that
Sunday's game at Candlestick
Park is a sellout and will be tele
vised locally if the NFL gives the
go-ahead.
A crowd of more thqn 60,000
is expected for the game, in
which the 49ers, 3-2, will try to

hold onto at least a tie for first
place in the National Con
ference Western Division. The
Cowboys, 4-1, are second in
the NFC East.
In other developments, the
49ers said they still have not
signed Pro Bowl defensive end
Fred Dean, acquired Friday in a
trade with San Diego.
John McVay, 49ers director
of football operations, met
with Dean's lawyer-agent
David Perrine in San Diego
Monday but returned without
a signed contract.
Nevertheless, 49er officials
were confident they will come
to terms soon with the seven
year veteran, who clashed with
the Chargers over renegotia
tion of his contract.
Eddie Deßartolo, the 49ers'
owner, said over the weekend,
"I think we may reach a settle
ment very soon that will make
us both happy. He (Dean) is an
outstanding player who should
help our«defense, so I would
like to have him."
Second-year safety Ricky
Churchman, plagued by a knee
injury that necessitated off
season surgery, will undergo
an examination tomorrow with
an instrument that can look
into his knee.


OH FOR BYGONE DAYS — Oakland coach Tom Flores has threatened to shake up the Raiders lineup after two
scoreless losses in the last two weeks. Quarterback Jim Plunkett, shown herebeing congratulated during a victor\
last season over the San Diego Chargers, could be hearing his understudy Marc Wilson calling the plays
Sunday if he doesn't find last year's Super Bowl-winning form.
