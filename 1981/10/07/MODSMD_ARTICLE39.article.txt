Columbus, Ohio (AP)
— Saying the expanded
playoffs threaten the inte
grity of major league
baseball, three Ohio State
University law students have
asked a federal judge to stop
the post-season games.
The suit filed Monday in
U.S. District Court herecon
tends that the playoff sched
ule devised after the
baseball players strike
ended is unfair because
some teams with the best
overall records in their
divisions did not reach the
playoffs.
Named as defendants in
the action are baseball
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn
and five teams headed for
the playoffs.

The students, James
Neary, Robert Kiss and
Randy Freking, all 24, said
the five teams were named
because they did not have
the best overall records. The
teams are the Houston
Astros, Los Angeles
Dodgers, Kansas City
Royals, New York Yankees
and Philadelphia Phillies.
Two teams, the Milwau
kee Brewers and Oakland
A's, were not named in the
suit because they had the
best overall records in their
divisions, and the eighth
team in the playoffs, the
Montreal Expos, was not in
cluded because the federal
court does not have juris
diction in Canada.
No hearing has been

scheduled on the suit.
In their suit, the three stu
dents say, "Plaintiffs have
been fans of major league
baseball for 20 years and
have relied on the past prac
tice of major league
baseball teams that only the
teams with the best records
over an entire season be al
lowed to enter post-season
play.
"Plaintiffs have relied on
the past decisions of Com
missioner Bowie Kuhn
which have emphasized the
integrity of baseball never
be sacrificed by the whims
of financially oriented
owners who have little con
cern for their legions of
fans."
