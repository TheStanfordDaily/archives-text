# Hoover seeks Reagan library
## 
### Richard Klingler 
Officials from the Hoover In
stitution on War, Revolution and
Peace have discussed with White
House officials the possibility of
establishing a library on campus to
house President Ronald Reagan's
presidential papers, but Univer
sity officials stated that no com
mitment has been made.
"The Hoover Institution has ex
tended an invitation to the presi
dent to have his library on ca" 1
pus," Richard Burress, associate
director and senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice presi
dent of public affairs, said, "There
have been discussions, but no
commitments have been made.
We didn't make a proposal."
However, Burress said, "We
have made an offer to the presi
dent, but he has not responded
yet." The first discussions were in
February, he said.
University President Donald
Kennedy stressed that interest in a
presidential library is only very
preliminary and is centered pri
marily at the Hoover Institution.

"Burress is wrong," Kennedy
said. "No offer has been ex
tended. No one in my office has
had contact with officials in Wash
ington about this.
"We are interested in the issue,
and I've given broad general sup
port to the idea. We haven't got
ten down to brass tacks," he said.
According to Burress, both he
and W. Glenn Campbell, director
of the Hoover, have discussed
p ! «->is for the library site with Rea
gan administration officials. Bur
ress said, "I have discussed this
with (Counselor to the President)
Ed Meese." Campbell could not
be reached for comment last
night.
Kennedy said, "We are in
terested; any University should be
interested in the scholarly re
sources presented in presidential
papers."
Any subsequent step in secur
ing the library would have to
come from Reagan's staff, but,
Burress cautioned, "this thing has
to take its natural priority."
The Board of Trustees would
have to approve any plans to build

the library or to designate any
land for such a use, but, according
to Rosenzweig, "the issue has not
been put before them."
Any library containing the pa
pers, Burress said, "probably
would be a separate and distinct
building."
Rosenzweig said, "it would be
preferable for the library to be as
near to the Hoover as possible."
Rosenzweig outlined the Uni
versity's condiditons for accepting
a presidential library: "It would
have to be, from our point of view,
a library devoted to scholarship.
(We are) not interested in a tourist
attraction in the middle of cam
pus."
The Associated Press, in an arti
cle yesterday about the John F.
Kennedy Library in Boston, stated
that "as for Reagan, a deputy
counselor, Robert Garrick, says
Stanford University ... has al
ready donated land for a presi
dential library site."
Kennedy said last night, "the
story is untrue."
"The University will definitely
not donate any land. That would

go against the founding charter,"
said G. Robert Hamrdla, assistant
to the president.
Neither Kennedy nor Burress
saw any parallel between this dis
cussion of a presidential library
and Duke University's attempt to
build a library for former Presi
dent Richard Nixon's presidential
papers — a decision which
aroused opposition among mem
bers of the faculty and Board of
Trustees. can't see any par
allels," Kennedy said. x
"I think I am proceeding with
this issue just as the faculty would
like," he said. "I can't imagine any
group of academicians, at this in
itial stage, not reacting positively
to this sort of resource."
The Hoover Institution already
possesses the papers from Rea
gan's tenure as governor, from
Reagan's 1980 election campaign,
and from the months of presiden
tial transition preceeding Rea
gan's inauguration. "It makes
sense to have the presidential li
brary here," said Burress. "We're
very hopeful the president will re
spond positively."
