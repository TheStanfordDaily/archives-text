# Card spikers face USF

The Stanford women's vol
leyball team will face the Uni
versity of San Francisco torn
morrow night in a conference
opener that could indicate
how the season will go for the
Cardinals.
USF's main strengths seem to
be youthful enthusiasm, and a
coach who has singlehandedly
turned around a dismal pro
gram. Directed by second-year
coach Marty Kennedy, the
Dons are primarily made up of
freshmen and sophomorel-
The Cards, on the other
hand, moved from ninth to
seventh in the NCAA Coaches
rankings just yesterday, after
sweeping all comers in the UC-
Berkeley Invitational last week
end.
Stanford head coach called

USF "a vastly improved team
from last year," but added that
the Cardinals have one hard
to-beat advantage: a wealth of
experience.
Senior outside-hitter Chris
Anderson led the Cards in kills
last season; senior setter-hitter
Jan Linden followed her up in
kills, and was also second in
serving aces. Couple that of
fensive threat with USF's inex
perience, and the Cards could
run away with it.
"USF doesn't have any spe
cific style of play," said Sturm.
"Their strengths are at the net.
They are capable of playing
well, but they are lacking some
consistency in ball control."
Sturm cited depth as another
advantage the Cards should
have over unranked USF, a
strength that is unheard of in

the Stanford volleyball pro
gram.
"If someone is having an off
night we have the luxury of
putting someone in who is hav
ing a good one, and that's a
something we have never had
in the past," he said.
The USF contest will be a
warm up of sorts for perhaps
the toughest conference
matches the Cards could see all
season, when they face Cal,
and fifth-ranked University of
Pacific, a team Sturm thinks is
better than its rating.
In another warm-up match,
Stanford will play the Palo Alto
YMCA team Friday evening, in
place of the originally sched
uled contest against the Stan
ford Alumni team.
Both matches will begin at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
