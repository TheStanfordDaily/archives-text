Reagan mourns Sadat death
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said
yesterday that with the death of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat, "America has lost a close
friend, the world has lost a great statesman and
mankind has lost a champion of peace."
Reagan, accompanied by his wife, Nancy,
went to the north portico of the White House to
read a brief statement of mourning. He said
nothing about the assassination's impact on
U.S. policies, or upon the Middle East peace ef
fort Sadat helped initiate.
He called Sadat a man of courage, vision, wis
dom and peace. "In a world filled with hatred,
he was a man of hope," the president said.
Sadat was in Washington Aug. 5 and 6 to con
fer with Reagan and other U.S. officials.
Reagan said the assassination of Sadat in a
Cairo suburb was an act of "cowardly infamy."
House passes social programs
Washington — The House defied President
Ronald Reagan last night as moderate Re
publicans joined Democrats in approving an
$87.3 billion appropriations bill for education,
health, welfare and jobs programs that GOP
leaders described as a prime target for a presi
dential veto.
A vote against sending the measure back to
committee for major cuts was close enough to
provide "clear evidence, with room to spare,
that a veto can be sustained," House Minority
Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said after the bill
passed.
After more than seven hours of debate and
action on a string of amendments, the House
voted, 249-168, against recommitting the meas
ure, with 39 Republican moderates joining the
Democratic leadership in opposing the move,
while 28 Democrats voted for it.
The House action stood in sharp contrast to
previous Reagan budget victories, when
enough Democrats joined a solid Republican
minority to give the president what he wanted.
CIA plan defended
Washington — A pending presidential order
would place fewer restrictions on CIA infiltra
tion of domestic groups than an earlier draft
that was shelved last March after a storm of pro
test, government sources said yesterday.
The latest plan, if signed by President Ronald
Reagan, would replace restrictions imposed on
U.S. intelligence agencies by President Jimmy
Carter in 1978. It would permit the CIA to in
filtrate and, with the attorney general's ap
proval, influence domestic groups, sources
said.
The CIA is barred from such activities under
the Carter order. The March Reagan draft
would have permitted the CIA to infiltrate a
domestic organization only if that action "is
strictly limited in its nature, scope and duration
to a lawful purpose related to foreign in
telligence."
The March restrictions on infiltration and on
influencing U.S. groups are dropped in the new
draft, sources said.
The new draft would permit secret infiltration
of a U.S. organization simply if the action is
judged necessary to achieve lawful purposes as
determined by the agency head or his designee,
sources said.
Although declining to discuss the draft order
in detail, CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said
yesterday, "protection of civil liberties is given
great weight, as it was in the previous (Carter)

order."
Peterson added that criticism of the new pro
posal is based on "worst-case scenarios" and
"ignores the restraints that are included in the
order."
AWACS vote delayed
Washington — The first congressional test of
President Ronalcl Reagan's arms sale to Saudi
Arabia was postponed yesterday after the as
sassination of Egyptian President Sadat,
but there were signs the slaying could sway
some opponents to the administration's side.
In the Senate, where the $8.5 billion package
faced a formidable front of critics, Democrats
and Republicans suggested the president may
now be able to argue more persuasively that it is
essential to bolster moderate regimes in the
Middle East.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee, mean
while, put off at least until today its scheduled
vote on a resolution to veto the sale. The panel
was still regarded virtually certain to recom
mend that action. The deal can be killed only if
both houses disapprove it by Nov. 1.
But there were conflicting signals in the Sen
ate. One of 19 Republican opponents im
mediately switched in favor of the sale of
AWACS radar planes and jetfighter equipment,
and other senators suggested the issue should
be put off indefinitely for ,
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utahf said, "I'm going to
reverse my vote on AWACS and support the
president. We have to have the safeguards this
deployment makes."
MX opposition continues
Washington — The chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee yesterday joined in
blasting President Ronald Reagan's plan to put
the new MX missile in rebuilt Titan missile silos
rather than keep it moving among a number of
shelters to protect it from attack.
"We are back to the beginning in the mod
ernization" of the U. S. land-based missiles,
Chairman Melvin R. Price (D-lll.) complained to
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and oth
er Pentagon officials sitting at the committee
witness table.
Price's attack came a day after Chairman John
Tower (D-Texas) of the Senate Armed Services
Committee also condemned the MX part of
Reagan's strategic blueprint. Other influential
members of Congress usually supportive of the
Pentagon also have attacked the MX proposal.
Since the armed services committees are the
ones that rnir;t authorize the money needed to
put the first 36 of 100 MX missiles in Titan silos,
the outlook for Reagan's new basing plan is at
least stormy.
Former President Jimmy Carter intended,
with Congress' blessing, to move the MX
around on the valley floors of Nevada or Utah to
reduce the missile's vulnerability to surprise at
tack. Weinberger said that plan's fatal flaw was
that the Soviet gunners could keep all the MX
garages covered with warheads, even if 4600
shelters were built as the Air Force recom
mended.
Maze prison reforms offered
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The British gov
ernment offered a "take-it or leave-it" package
of prison reforms yesterday that excludes the
key demand by Irish nationalists that they be
granted political-prisoner status.
The proposal, in response to cancellation of

the Maze prison hunger strike that had cost 10
lives, got a cautious response from the Irish Re
publican Army's legal political arm. The Roman
Catholic church hierarchy welcomed it, but
leaders of Northern Ireland's Protestant majori
ty called it a "sell-out."
Gerry Adams, vice president of Sinn Fein, the
outlawed IRA's political front, said it "remains
to be seen" whether the reforms are enough to
bring end the prison protest that jailed guer
rillas have conducted in the Maze since March
1976. The hunger strike was a part of that pro
test.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior said
convicted guerrillas can wear their own clothes
instead of prison-issue garb and will get half the
parole time lost through cellblock protests re
stored if they call off their campaign and obey
prison rules for three months.
He also pledged limited "free association"
within the wings of the H-shaped cellblocks of
the Maze prison near Belfast — center of the
protest campaign — and some relaxation of
rules on penal work.
Acid rain debated
Washington -- Midwest Republicans
launched a sharp counterattack on Canada over
acid rain responsibility yesterday, charging at a
congressional subcommittee hearing that U.S.
control of air pollution is already much stricter
than Canada's and does not need further stif
fening.
The Canadians had come to the House
Energy subcommittee on health and the en
vironment to say that "an enormous number of
dying lakes" in eastern North America argue
conclusively for more controls on sulfur and ni
trogen emissions as Congress rewrites the 1970
Clean Air Act.
Using slides and film in a dimly lit hearing
room, Canadian government spokesmen said
10 years of research showed that half of Cana
da's acid rain comes from U.S. sources. Other
toxic chemicals are airlifted across the border as
well: ozone that can break down rubber and
plastics, and oil particles containing cancer
causing PCBs.
The Canadians also gave a history lesson on
the British-Canadian tradition of less-formal
written enforcement procedures. "What's im
portant is what comes out of the stack. That's
where you see that ti.e law works," said Canadi
an embassy environment counselor George Re
jhon.
Oil, metals stocks rise
— Domestic oil and precious-metals issues
rose sharply yesterday as stock-market traders
learned of the assassination of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 3.61 to 656.26.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled
45.46 million shares, against 51.29 million Mon
day.
Today's weather
—Increasing cloudiness leading to rain and
turning to showers today, tapering off tonight.
Partly cloudy tomorrow night and cooler. Lows

craft advisory for increasing southerly winds 15

Washington — The chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee yesterday joined in
blasting President Ronald Reagan's plan to put
the new MX missile in rebuilt Titan missile silos
rather than keep it moving among a number of
shelters to protect it from attack.
"We are back to the beginning in the mod
ernization" of the U. S. land-based missiles,
Chairman Melvin R. Price (D-lll.) complained to
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and oth
er Pentagon officials sitting at the committee
witness table.
Price's attack came a day after Chairman John
Tower (D-Texas) of the Senate Armed Services
Committee also condemned the MX part of
Reagan's strategic blueprint. Other influential
members of Congress usually supportive of the
Pentagon also have attacked the MX proposal.
Since the armed services committees are the
ones that rnir;t authorize the money needed to
put the first 36 of 100 MX missiles in Titan silos,
the outlook for Reagan's new basing plan is at
least stormy.
Former President Jimmy Carter intended,
with Congress' blessing, to move the MX
around on the valley floors of Nevada or Utah to
reduce the missile's vulnerability to surprise at
tack. Weinberger said that plan's fatal flaw was
that the Soviet gunners could keep all the MX
garages covered with warheads, even if 4600
shelters were built as the Air Force recom
mended.
Maze prison reforms offered
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The British gov
ernment offered a "take-it or leave-it" package
of prison reforms yesterday that excludes the
key demand by Irish nationalists that they be
granted political-prisoner status.
The proposal, in response to cancellation of

the Maze prison hunger strike that had cost 10
lives, got a cautious response from the Irish Re
publican Army's legal political arm. The Roman
Catholic church hierarchy welcomed it, but
leaders of Northern Ireland's Protestant majori
ty called it a "sell-out."
Gerry Adams, vice president of Sinn Fein, the
outlawed IRA's political front, said it "remains
to be seen" whether the reforms are enough to
bring end the prison protest that jailed guer
rillas have conducted in the Maze since March
1976. The hunger strike was a part of that pro
test.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior said
convicted guerrillas can wear their own clothes
instead of prison-issue garb and will get half the
parole time lost through cellblock protests re
stored if they call off their campaign and obey
prison rules for three months.
He also pledged limited "free association"
within the wings of the H-shaped cellblocks of
the Maze prison near Belfast — center of the
protest campaign — and some relaxation of
rules on penal work.
Acid rain debated
Washington -- Midwest Republicans
launched a sharp counterattack on Canada over
acid rain responsibility yesterday, charging at a
congressional subcommittee hearing that U.S.
control of air pollution is already much stricter
than Canada's and does not need further stif
fening.
The Canadians had come to the House
Energy subcommittee on health and the en
vironment to say that "an enormous number of
dying lakes" in eastern North America argue
conclusively for more controls on sulfur and ni
trogen emissions as Congress rewrites the 1970
Clean Air Act.
Using slides and film in a dimly lit hearing
room, Canadian government spokesmen said
10 years of research showed that half of Cana
da's acid rain comes from U.S. sources. Other
toxic chemicals are airlifted across the border as
well: ozone that can break down rubber and
plastics, and oil particles containing cancer
causing PCBs.
The Canadians also gave a history lesson on
the British-Canadian tradition of less-formal
written enforcement procedures. "What's im
portant is what comes out of the stack. That's
where you see that ti.e law works," said Canadi
an embassy environment counselor George Re
jhon.

Reagan mourns Sadat death
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said
yesterday that with the death of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat, "America has lost a close
friend, the world has lost a great statesman and
mankind has lost a champion of peace."
Reagan, accompanied by his wife, Nancy,
went to the north portico of the White House to
read a brief statement of mourning. He said
nothing about the assassination's impact on
U.S. policies, or upon the Middle East peace ef
fort Sadat helped initiate.
He called Sadat a man of courage, vision, wis
dom and peace. "In a world filled with hatred,
he was a man of hope," the president said.
Sadat was in Washington Aug. 5 and 6 to con
fer with Reagan and other U.S. officials.
Reagan said the assassination of Sadat in a
Cairo suburb was an act of "cowardly infamy."
House passes social programs
Washington — The House defied President
Ronald Reagan last night as moderate Re
publicans joined Democrats in approving an
$87.3 billion appropriations bill for education,
health, welfare and jobs programs that GOP
leaders described as a prime target for a presi
dential veto.
A vote against sending the measure back to
committee for major cuts was close enough to
provide "clear evidence, with room to spare,
that a veto can be sustained," House Minority
Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said after the bill
passed.
After more than seven hours of debate and
action on a string of amendments, the House
voted, 249-168, against recommitting the meas
ure, with 39 Republican moderates joining the
Democratic leadership in opposing the move,
while 28 Democrats voted for it.
The House action stood in sharp contrast to
previous Reagan budget victories, when
enough Democrats joined a solid Republican
minority to give the president what he wanted.
CIA plan defended
Washington — A pending presidential order
would place fewer restrictions on CIA infiltra
tion of domestic groups than an earlier draft
that was shelved last March after a storm of pro
test, government sources said yesterday.
The latest plan, if signed by President Ronald
Reagan, would replace restrictions imposed on
U.S. intelligence agencies by President Jimmy
Carter in 1978. It would permit the CIA to in
filtrate and, with the attorney general's ap
proval, influence domestic groups, sources
said.
The CIA is barred from such activities under
the Carter order. The March Reagan draft
would have permitted the CIA to infiltrate a
domestic organization only if that action "is
strictly limited in its nature, scope and duration
to a lawful purpose related to foreign in
telligence."
The March restrictions on infiltration and on
influencing U.S. groups are dropped in the new
draft, sources said.
The new draft would permit secret infiltration
of a U.S. organization simply if the action is
judged necessary to achieve lawful purposes as
determined by the agency head or his designee,
sources said.
Although declining to discuss the draft order
in detail, CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said
yesterday, "protection of civil liberties is given
great weight, as it was in the previous (Carter)

order."
Peterson added that criticism of the new pro
posal is based on "worst-case scenarios" and
"ignores the restraints that are included in the
order."
AWACS vote delayed
Washington — The first congressional test of
President Ronalcl Reagan's arms sale to Saudi
Arabia was postponed yesterday after the as
sassination of Egyptian President Sadat,
but there were signs the slaying could sway
some opponents to the administration's side.
In the Senate, where the $8.5 billion package
faced a formidable front of critics, Democrats
and Republicans suggested the president may
now be able to argue more persuasively that it is
essential to bolster moderate regimes in the
Middle East.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee, mean
while, put off at least until today its scheduled
vote on a resolution to veto the sale. The panel
was still regarded virtually certain to recom
mend that action. The deal can be killed only if
both houses disapprove it by Nov. 1.
But there were conflicting signals in the Sen
ate. One of 19 Republican opponents im
mediately switched in favor of the sale of
AWACS radar planes and jetfighter equipment,
and other senators suggested the issue should
be put off indefinitely for ,
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utahf said, "I'm going to
reverse my vote on AWACS and support the
president. We have to have the safeguards this
deployment makes."

Reagan mourns Sadat death
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said
yesterday that with the death of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat, "America has lost a close
friend, the world has lost a great statesman and
mankind has lost a champion of peace."
Reagan, accompanied by his wife, Nancy,
went to the north portico of the White House to
read a brief statement of mourning. He said
nothing about the assassination's impact on
U.S. policies, or upon the Middle East peace ef
fort Sadat helped initiate.
He called Sadat a man of courage, vision, wis
dom and peace. "In a world filled with hatred,
he was a man of hope," the president said.
Sadat was in Washington Aug. 5 and 6 to con
fer with Reagan and other U.S. officials.
Reagan said the assassination of Sadat in a
Cairo suburb was an act of "cowardly infamy."
House passes social programs
Washington — The House defied President
Ronald Reagan last night as moderate Re
publicans joined Democrats in approving an
$87.3 billion appropriations bill for education,
health, welfare and jobs programs that GOP
leaders described as a prime target for a presi
dential veto.
A vote against sending the measure back to
committee for major cuts was close enough to
provide "clear evidence, with room to spare,
that a veto can be sustained," House Minority
Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said after the bill
passed.
After more than seven hours of debate and
action on a string of amendments, the House
voted, 249-168, against recommitting the meas
ure, with 39 Republican moderates joining the
Democratic leadership in opposing the move,
while 28 Democrats voted for it.
The House action stood in sharp contrast to
previous Reagan budget victories, when
enough Democrats joined a solid Republican
minority to give the president what he wanted.
CIA plan defended
Washington — A pending presidential order
would place fewer restrictions on CIA infiltra
tion of domestic groups than an earlier draft
that was shelved last March after a storm of pro
test, government sources said yesterday.
The latest plan, if signed by President Ronald
Reagan, would replace restrictions imposed on
U.S. intelligence agencies by President Jimmy
Carter in 1978. It would permit the CIA to in
filtrate and, with the attorney general's ap
proval, influence domestic groups, sources
said.
The CIA is barred from such activities under
the Carter order. The March Reagan draft
would have permitted the CIA to infiltrate a
domestic organization only if that action "is
strictly limited in its nature, scope and duration
to a lawful purpose related to foreign in
telligence."
The March restrictions on infiltration and on
influencing U.S. groups are dropped in the new
draft, sources said.
The new draft would permit secret infiltration
of a U.S. organization simply if the action is
judged necessary to achieve lawful purposes as
determined by the agency head or his designee,
sources said.
Although declining to discuss the draft order
in detail, CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said
yesterday, "protection of civil liberties is given
great weight, as it was in the previous (Carter)

order."
Peterson added that criticism of the new pro
posal is based on "worst-case scenarios" and
"ignores the restraints that are included in the
order."
AWACS vote delayed
Washington — The first congressional test of
President Ronalcl Reagan's arms sale to Saudi
Arabia was postponed yesterday after the as
sassination of Egyptian President Sadat,
but there were signs the slaying could sway
some opponents to the administration's side.
In the Senate, where the $8.5 billion package
faced a formidable front of critics, Democrats
and Republicans suggested the president may
now be able to argue more persuasively that it is
essential to bolster moderate regimes in the
Middle East.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee, mean
while, put off at least until today its scheduled
vote on a resolution to veto the sale. The panel
was still regarded virtually certain to recom
mend that action. The deal can be killed only if
both houses disapprove it by Nov. 1.
But there were conflicting signals in the Sen
ate. One of 19 Republican opponents im
mediately switched in favor of the sale of
AWACS radar planes and jetfighter equipment,
and other senators suggested the issue should
be put off indefinitely for ,
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utahf said, "I'm going to
reverse my vote on AWACS and support the
president. We have to have the safeguards this
deployment makes."
MX opposition continues
Washington — The chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee yesterday joined in
blasting President Ronald Reagan's plan to put
the new MX missile in rebuilt Titan missile silos
rather than keep it moving among a number of
shelters to protect it from attack.
"We are back to the beginning in the mod
ernization" of the U. S. land-based missiles,
Chairman Melvin R. Price (D-lll.) complained to
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and oth
er Pentagon officials sitting at the committee
witness table.
Price's attack came a day after Chairman John
Tower (D-Texas) of the Senate Armed Services
Committee also condemned the MX part of
Reagan's strategic blueprint. Other influential
members of Congress usually supportive of the
Pentagon also have attacked the MX proposal.
Since the armed services committees are the
ones that rnir;t authorize the money needed to
put the first 36 of 100 MX missiles in Titan silos,
the outlook for Reagan's new basing plan is at
least stormy.
Former President Jimmy Carter intended,
with Congress' blessing, to move the MX
around on the valley floors of Nevada or Utah to
reduce the missile's vulnerability to surprise at
tack. Weinberger said that plan's fatal flaw was
that the Soviet gunners could keep all the MX
garages covered with warheads, even if 4600
shelters were built as the Air Force recom
mended.
Maze prison reforms offered
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The British gov
ernment offered a "take-it or leave-it" package
of prison reforms yesterday that excludes the
key demand by Irish nationalists that they be
granted political-prisoner status.
The proposal, in response to cancellation of

the Maze prison hunger strike that had cost 10
lives, got a cautious response from the Irish Re
publican Army's legal political arm. The Roman
Catholic church hierarchy welcomed it, but
leaders of Northern Ireland's Protestant majori
ty called it a "sell-out."
Gerry Adams, vice president of Sinn Fein, the
outlawed IRA's political front, said it "remains
to be seen" whether the reforms are enough to
bring end the prison protest that jailed guer
rillas have conducted in the Maze since March
1976. The hunger strike was a part of that pro
test.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior said
convicted guerrillas can wear their own clothes
instead of prison-issue garb and will get half the
parole time lost through cellblock protests re
stored if they call off their campaign and obey
prison rules for three months.
He also pledged limited "free association"
within the wings of the H-shaped cellblocks of
the Maze prison near Belfast — center of the
protest campaign — and some relaxation of
rules on penal work.
Acid rain debated
Washington -- Midwest Republicans
launched a sharp counterattack on Canada over
acid rain responsibility yesterday, charging at a
congressional subcommittee hearing that U.S.
control of air pollution is already much stricter
than Canada's and does not need further stif
fening.
The Canadians had come to the House
Energy subcommittee on health and the en
vironment to say that "an enormous number of
dying lakes" in eastern North America argue
conclusively for more controls on sulfur and ni
trogen emissions as Congress rewrites the 1970
Clean Air Act.
Using slides and film in a dimly lit hearing
room, Canadian government spokesmen said
10 years of research showed that half of Cana
da's acid rain comes from U.S. sources. Other
toxic chemicals are airlifted across the border as
well: ozone that can break down rubber and
plastics, and oil particles containing cancer
causing PCBs.
The Canadians also gave a history lesson on
the British-Canadian tradition of less-formal
written enforcement procedures. "What's im
portant is what comes out of the stack. That's
where you see that ti.e law works," said Canadi
an embassy environment counselor George Re
jhon.
Oil, metals stocks rise
