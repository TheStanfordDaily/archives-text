General Reference Service
"What famous painter was associated with Flora
Tristan?"
"Did Macßeth ever leave Scotland and if so where
and when did he go?''
"What were the numbers of employed and unem
ployed workers, and the average wage rates, during
the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral or
faculty research — or for a variety of information
needs in between — the staff of the General
Reference Department provide expert help to li
brary users. Located on the main floor of the
Green Library East, the Department responds to
in-person requests, telephone calls, and letters
from inquirers on campus, elsewhere in
California, throughout the United States, and
overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 30,000 volumes, which, in
addition to works of a general nature, contain
specialized material in the humanities and social
sciences, especially in those disciplines for which
no branch or coordinate library exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, encyclo
pedias, guides to important microfilm collections,
indexes and abstracts of journal literature, na
tional and trade bibliographies, newspaper in
dexes, research guides, specialized subject guides,
and union lists of serials, Stanford's as well as
others. Some appreciation of the scope of the
collection may be gained by consulting the Guide
to Selected Reference Materials, available at the
Reference Desk.
Library users are encouraged to consult the staff
at the Reference Desk or Information Desk for
assistance in using the Library's catalogs or any of
the materials listed above. General Reference
staff will also check RLIN* to determine the
status of a book on order or place a rush cataloging
request for a book received but not yet on the
shelves.
University Archives
*
The "collective memory" of Stanford Uni
versity was established in 1965 by the Board of
Trustees to preserve and make available the his
torical record of the University and the Stanford
community. This rich and wonderful store of in
formation and research materials is currently
housed in the Timothy Hopkins Room (3rd floor,
West Wing), awaiting its new quarters in the
Bender Room. *
In the University Archives, the reader will
find, among other things, papers of Stanford fa
culty members and presidents, records of campus
offices and student organizations, Stanford family
scrapbooks and photo albums, publications of all
kinds produced on or about Stanford, theses and
dissertations, photos and slides, maps, prints, and
posters, student letters, diaries, and scrapbooks,
et cetera.

The Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room houses
periodicals, newspapers, and a
diverse collection of microforms.

Researchers have used these collections to
study such topics as Stanford's role in the develop
ment of the electronics industry, the organi
zation and activities of Stanford's students, and
the distinctive architecture here on campus. The
University Archives is open to scholars, students,
authors, and other interested persons regardless of
academic affiliation.
Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green Li
brary's East Wing, houses periodicals, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the most
recent issues of 4,000 selected academic journals
and popular magazines. Current issues of other
journals may be found with their bound back files
in the Stack or in other libraries on campus. The
Stanford Union List of Serials (SULS)*, issued
quarterly on microfiche, provides location and
holdings information for serials* held in the Uni
versity Libraries and in several coordinate
libraries.*

Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
microform of over 800 newspaper titles, some
dating back to the early nineteenth century. Al
though these newspapers are not listed in the
main card catalog or in SULS, card files are main
tained in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room to provide titles, city of origin and holdings
records. Indexes for a number of newspapers, in
cluding the New York Times, may be found in the
Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes: Presi
dential Papers, the History of Women collection,
Early American Imprints, the anthropological
documents contained in the Human Relations
Area File, AEC Technical Reports, British Par
liamentary Papers, census reports dating back to
1790, and the collection of Three Centuries of
American and British Drama. These large
micropublishing projects were designed to make a
great body of historical material easily accessible
to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in
the card catalog. However, guides to the indi
vidual collections are available in the Microtexts
Room. Readers interested in material that may be
contained in the microform collections should
inquire at the Reference Desk or the Current
Periodicals and Microtexts Reference Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm and
microfiche are available in the Microtexts Read
ing Room. There are also portable microfilm
readers available for ten day loan.
