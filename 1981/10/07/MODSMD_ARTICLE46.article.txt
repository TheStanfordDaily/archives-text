"What famous painter was associated with Flora
Tristan?"
"Did Macßeth ever leave Scotland and if so where
and when did he go?''
"What were the numbers of employed and unem
ployed workers, and the average wage rates, during
the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral or
faculty research — or for a variety of information
needs in between — the staff of the General
Reference Department provide expert help to li
brary users. Located on the main floor of the
Green Library East, the Department responds to
in-person requests, telephone calls, and letters
from inquirers on campus, elsewhere in
California, throughout the United States, and
overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 30,000 volumes, which, in
addition to works of a general nature, contain
specialized material in the humanities and social
sciences, especially in those disciplines for which
no branch or coordinate library exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, encyclo
pedias, guides to important microfilm collections,
indexes and abstracts of journal literature, na
tional and trade bibliographies, newspaper in
dexes, research guides, specialized subject guides,
and union lists of serials, Stanford's as well as
others. Some appreciation of the scope of the
collection may be gained by consulting the Guide
to Selected Reference Materials, available at the
Reference Desk.
Library users are encouraged to consult the staff
at the Reference Desk or Information Desk for
assistance in using the Library's catalogs or any of
the materials listed above. General Reference
staff will also check RLIN* to determine the
status of a book on order or place a rush cataloging
request for a book received but not yet on the
shelves.
University Archives
*
The "collective memory" of Stanford Uni
versity was established in 1965 by the Board of
Trustees to preserve and make available the his
torical record of the University and the Stanford
community. This rich and wonderful store of in
formation and research materials is currently
housed in the Timothy Hopkins Room (3rd floor,
West Wing), awaiting its new quarters in the
Bender Room. *
In the University Archives, the reader will
find, among other things, papers of Stanford fa
culty members and presidents, records of campus
offices and student organizations, Stanford family
scrapbooks and photo albums, publications of all
kinds produced on or about Stanford, theses and
dissertations, photos and slides, maps, prints, and
posters, student letters, diaries, and scrapbooks,
et cetera.

The Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room houses
periodicals, newspapers, and a
diverse collection of microforms.

Researchers have used these collections to
study such topics as Stanford's role in the develop
ment of the electronics industry, the organi
zation and activities of Stanford's students, and
the distinctive architecture here on campus. The
University Archives is open to scholars, students,
authors, and other interested persons regardless of
academic affiliation.
Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green Li
brary's East Wing, houses periodicals, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the most
recent issues of 4,000 selected academic journals
and popular magazines. Current issues of other
journals may be found with their bound back files
in the Stack or in other libraries on campus. The
Stanford Union List of Serials (SULS)*, issued
quarterly on microfiche, provides location and
holdings information for serials* held in the Uni
versity Libraries and in several coordinate
libraries.*

Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
microform of over 800 newspaper titles, some
dating back to the early nineteenth century. Al
though these newspapers are not listed in the
main card catalog or in SULS, card files are main
tained in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room to provide titles, city of origin and holdings
records. Indexes for a number of newspapers, in
cluding the New York Times, may be found in the
Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes: Presi
dential Papers, the History of Women collection,
Early American Imprints, the anthropological
documents contained in the Human Relations
Area File, AEC Technical Reports, British Par
liamentary Papers, census reports dating back to
1790, and the collection of Three Centuries of
American and British Drama. These large
micropublishing projects were designed to make a
great body of historical material easily accessible
to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in
the card catalog. However, guides to the indi
vidual collections are available in the Microtexts
Room. Readers interested in material that may be
contained in the microform collections should
inquire at the Reference Desk or the Current
Periodicals and Microtexts Reference Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm and
microfiche are available in the Microtexts Read
ing Room. There are also portable microfilm
readers available for ten day loan.

Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than IV2 million vol
umes which comprise the main research collec
tion of the University Libraries, as well as ad
ministering all study spaces located within the
Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, staff, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is
also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies, Dissertation Rooms and Group
Studies); branch library hours and locations; the
UCB/Stanford Research Library Cooperative
Program ; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences materials
which constitute the main research collection are
located in the Green Library Stack, comprised of
tast (E), West (W) and South (S) stacks. All
of these materials are designated 'STACK' or
'STK' in the card catalog and in SULS.* Stack
Directories are posted throughout the Library in
dicating location of materials by stack (E, W,S) or
other symbol. Some older materials are located in
Auxiliary Storage and must be requested at the
Loan Desk. Loan Desk staff members will be glad
to help readers determine in which of the loca
tions material they are seeking is housed and
arrange to have material paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library books
and the Green Library Self-Guided Tour Cassette
Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer information regard
ing borrowing policies as well as general Library
information; handle Graduate Reserves; take
paging requests for items needed from the Aux
iliary Stack; recall* materials needed from other
readers; search for items not found on Library
shelves; process overdue, lost or other problem
charges, and provide a review and appeals service
regarding assessment of fees . Questions regarding
Lost and Found may also be directed to Loan Desk
staff members. Materials borrowed through In
terlibrary Loan (ILL) or UCB's Baker Service*
may be picked up at the Loan Desk, located on
the first floor of the East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as or
ganizing shelves so that books are in their proper
locations when needed. In addition, the Stack
staff administer lockers located throughout the
East Stack; page books for the physically limited;
keep study space for library users clear of extrane
ous materials; report building problems; keep
holders throughout the Library full of blank
charge cards and Stanford University Library
(SUL) Guides; and empty Library book returns

located outside of the Library. Questions may be
directed to members of the Stack staff in the
Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room 42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is asked
by the Portal Staff to open all bags and briefcases
for inspection of Library materials. This is to
insure against uncharged materials leaving the
Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may have
regarding services offered by the Department or
general informational questions about the
Library.

Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of the
Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of the
USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 200 on the second floor of West
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the use
of the map card catalog, gazetteers and indexes.
She will help a patron find appropriate carto
graphic reference works, or locate and retrieve
needed materials from the map cases. Maps may
be loaned to all authorized Stanford borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related in
formation; for example, the Branner Earth Sci
ences Library contains a large collection of goo
logical maps, or the Physics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.

Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours may
be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl Tonge
(7-1811).
Government Documents
Question: What do a list of plants "native" to
California, the text of the Panama Canal Treaty, a
picture of the moon's surface, gas mileage ratings for
American and foreign cars, and a list of bans and
credits contracted by Pakistan, have in common?
Answer: All are found in government docu
ments.*
Documents provide primary sources for re
search, a better understanding of the events be
hind today's headlines, and information essential
to being an informed consumer, voter, or citizen.
Located on the first floor of the Green Library's
West Wing, the Government Documents De
partment houses about 250,000 government pub
lications, or roughly half of Stanford's total docu
ments holdings. In the Department proper, users
will find the depository collections for U.S. Fed
eral, California State, and United Nations publi
cations; exceptional holdings of British Parlia
mentary papers; and selected documents from in
ternational agencies and from U.S. state and
local governments. The reference* collection is
particularly strong in statistical materials and
should be regarded as the place to begin whenever
statistics are needed.
Many documents are also acquired by the
Department and listed in the card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or international
agencies germane to the subject collections of
branch libraries.
Many documents are not listed in the main
catalog, but are only listed in the card catalog in
the Documents Department. Records are main
tained there for all government documents in the
University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries, but

located in Room 200 on the second floor of West
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the use
of the map card catalog, gazetteers and indexes.
She will help a patron find appropriate carto
graphic reference works, or locate and retrieve
needed materials from the map cases. Maps may
be loaned to all authorized Stanford borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related in
formation; for example, the Branner Earth Sci
ences Library contains a large collection of goo
logical maps, or the Physics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.

Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours may
be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl Tonge
(7-1811).
Government Documents
Question: What do a list of plants "native" to
California, the text of the Panama Canal Treaty, a
picture of the moon's surface, gas mileage ratings for
American and foreign cars, and a list of bans and
credits contracted by Pakistan, have in common?
Answer: All are found in government docu
ments.*
Documents provide primary sources for re
search, a better understanding of the events be
hind today's headlines, and information essential
to being an informed consumer, voter, or citizen.
Located on the first floor of the Green Library's
West Wing, the Government Documents De
partment houses about 250,000 government pub
lications, or roughly half of Stanford's total docu
ments holdings. In the Department proper, users
will find the depository collections for U.S. Fed
eral, California State, and United Nations publi
cations; exceptional holdings of British Parlia
mentary papers; and selected documents from in
ternational agencies and from U.S. state and
local governments. The reference* collection is
particularly strong in statistical materials and
should be regarded as the place to begin whenever
statistics are needed.
Many documents are also acquired by the
Department and listed in the card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or international
agencies germane to the subject collections of
branch libraries.
Many documents are not listed in the main
catalog, but are only listed in the card catalog in
the Documents Department. Records are main
tained there for all government documents in the
University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries, but

General Reference Service
"What famous painter was associated with Flora
Tristan?"
"Did Macßeth ever leave Scotland and if so where
and when did he go?''
"What were the numbers of employed and unem
ployed workers, and the average wage rates, during
the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral or
faculty research — or for a variety of information
needs in between — the staff of the General
Reference Department provide expert help to li
brary users. Located on the main floor of the
Green Library East, the Department responds to
in-person requests, telephone calls, and letters
from inquirers on campus, elsewhere in
California, throughout the United States, and
overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 30,000 volumes, which, in
addition to works of a general nature, contain
specialized material in the humanities and social
sciences, especially in those disciplines for which
no branch or coordinate library exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, encyclo
pedias, guides to important microfilm collections,
indexes and abstracts of journal literature, na
tional and trade bibliographies, newspaper in
dexes, research guides, specialized subject guides,
and union lists of serials, Stanford's as well as
others. Some appreciation of the scope of the
collection may be gained by consulting the Guide
to Selected Reference Materials, available at the
Reference Desk.
Library users are encouraged to consult the staff
at the Reference Desk or Information Desk for
assistance in using the Library's catalogs or any of
the materials listed above. General Reference
staff will also check RLIN* to determine the
status of a book on order or place a rush cataloging
request for a book received but not yet on the
shelves.
University Archives
*
The "collective memory" of Stanford Uni
versity was established in 1965 by the Board of
Trustees to preserve and make available the his
torical record of the University and the Stanford
community. This rich and wonderful store of in
formation and research materials is currently
housed in the Timothy Hopkins Room (3rd floor,
West Wing), awaiting its new quarters in the
Bender Room. *
In the University Archives, the reader will
find, among other things, papers of Stanford fa
culty members and presidents, records of campus
offices and student organizations, Stanford family
scrapbooks and photo albums, publications of all
kinds produced on or about Stanford, theses and
dissertations, photos and slides, maps, prints, and
posters, student letters, diaries, and scrapbooks,
et cetera.

The Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room houses
periodicals, newspapers, and a
diverse collection of microforms.

Researchers have used these collections to
study such topics as Stanford's role in the develop
ment of the electronics industry, the organi
zation and activities of Stanford's students, and
the distinctive architecture here on campus. The
University Archives is open to scholars, students,
authors, and other interested persons regardless of
academic affiliation.
Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green Li
brary's East Wing, houses periodicals, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the most
recent issues of 4,000 selected academic journals
and popular magazines. Current issues of other
journals may be found with their bound back files
in the Stack or in other libraries on campus. The
Stanford Union List of Serials (SULS)*, issued
quarterly on microfiche, provides location and
holdings information for serials* held in the Uni
versity Libraries and in several coordinate
libraries.*

Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
microform of over 800 newspaper titles, some
dating back to the early nineteenth century. Al
though these newspapers are not listed in the
main card catalog or in SULS, card files are main
tained in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room to provide titles, city of origin and holdings
records. Indexes for a number of newspapers, in
cluding the New York Times, may be found in the
Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes: Presi
dential Papers, the History of Women collection,
Early American Imprints, the anthropological
documents contained in the Human Relations
Area File, AEC Technical Reports, British Par
liamentary Papers, census reports dating back to
1790, and the collection of Three Centuries of
American and British Drama. These large
micropublishing projects were designed to make a
great body of historical material easily accessible
to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in
the card catalog. However, guides to the indi
vidual collections are available in the Microtexts
Room. Readers interested in material that may be
contained in the microform collections should
inquire at the Reference Desk or the Current
Periodicals and Microtexts Reference Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm and
microfiche are available in the Microtexts Read
ing Room. There are also portable microfilm
readers available for ten day loan.

Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than IV2 million vol
umes which comprise the main research collec
tion of the University Libraries, as well as ad
ministering all study spaces located within the
Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, staff, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is
also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies, Dissertation Rooms and Group
Studies); branch library hours and locations; the
UCB/Stanford Research Library Cooperative
Program ; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences materials
which constitute the main research collection are
located in the Green Library Stack, comprised of
tast (E), West (W) and South (S) stacks. All
of these materials are designated 'STACK' or
'STK' in the card catalog and in SULS.* Stack
Directories are posted throughout the Library in
dicating location of materials by stack (E, W,S) or
other symbol. Some older materials are located in
Auxiliary Storage and must be requested at the
Loan Desk. Loan Desk staff members will be glad
to help readers determine in which of the loca
tions material they are seeking is housed and
arrange to have material paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library books
and the Green Library Self-Guided Tour Cassette
Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer information regard
ing borrowing policies as well as general Library
information; handle Graduate Reserves; take
paging requests for items needed from the Aux
iliary Stack; recall* materials needed from other
readers; search for items not found on Library
shelves; process overdue, lost or other problem
charges, and provide a review and appeals service
regarding assessment of fees . Questions regarding
Lost and Found may also be directed to Loan Desk
staff members. Materials borrowed through In
terlibrary Loan (ILL) or UCB's Baker Service*
may be picked up at the Loan Desk, located on
the first floor of the East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as or
ganizing shelves so that books are in their proper
locations when needed. In addition, the Stack
staff administer lockers located throughout the
East Stack; page books for the physically limited;
keep study space for library users clear of extrane
ous materials; report building problems; keep
holders throughout the Library full of blank
charge cards and Stanford University Library
(SUL) Guides; and empty Library book returns

located outside of the Library. Questions may be
directed to members of the Stack staff in the
Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room 42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is asked
by the Portal Staff to open all bags and briefcases
for inspection of Library materials. This is to
insure against uncharged materials leaving the
Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may have
regarding services offered by the Department or
general informational questions about the
Library.

Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of the
Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of the

located in the Green Library Stack, comprised of
tast (E), West (W) and South (S) stacks. All
of these materials are designated 'STACK' or
'STK' in the card catalog and in SULS.* Stack
Directories are posted throughout the Library in
dicating location of materials by stack (E, W,S) or
other symbol. Some older materials are located in
Auxiliary Storage and must be requested at the
Loan Desk. Loan Desk staff members will be glad
to help readers determine in which of the loca
tions material they are seeking is housed and
arrange to have material paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library books
and the Green Library Self-Guided Tour Cassette
Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer information regard
ing borrowing policies as well as general Library
information; handle Graduate Reserves; take
paging requests for items needed from the Aux
iliary Stack; recall* materials needed from other
readers; search for items not found on Library
shelves; process overdue, lost or other problem
charges, and provide a review and appeals service
regarding assessment of fees . Questions regarding
Lost and Found may also be directed to Loan Desk
staff members. Materials borrowed through In
terlibrary Loan (ILL) or UCB's Baker Service*
may be picked up at the Loan Desk, located on
the first floor of the East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as or
ganizing shelves so that books are in their proper
locations when needed. In addition, the Stack
staff administer lockers located throughout the
East Stack; page books for the physically limited;
keep study space for library users clear of extrane
ous materials; report building problems; keep
holders throughout the Library full of blank
charge cards and Stanford University Library
(SUL) Guides; and empty Library book returns

located outside of the Library. Questions may be
directed to members of the Stack staff in the
Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room 42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is asked
by the Portal Staff to open all bags and briefcases
for inspection of Library materials. This is to
insure against uncharged materials leaving the
Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may have
regarding services offered by the Department or
general informational questions about the
Library.

Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of the
Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of the
USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 200 on the second floor of West
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the use
of the map card catalog, gazetteers and indexes.
She will help a patron find appropriate carto
graphic reference works, or locate and retrieve
needed materials from the map cases. Maps may
be loaned to all authorized Stanford borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related in
formation; for example, the Branner Earth Sci
ences Library contains a large collection of goo
logical maps, or the Physics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.

Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours may
be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl Tonge
(7-1811).
Government Documents
Question: What do a list of plants "native" to
California, the text of the Panama Canal Treaty, a
picture of the moon's surface, gas mileage ratings for
American and foreign cars, and a list of bans and
credits contracted by Pakistan, have in common?
Answer: All are found in government docu
ments.*
Documents provide primary sources for re
search, a better understanding of the events be
hind today's headlines, and information essential
to being an informed consumer, voter, or citizen.
Located on the first floor of the Green Library's
West Wing, the Government Documents De
partment houses about 250,000 government pub
lications, or roughly half of Stanford's total docu
ments holdings. In the Department proper, users
will find the depository collections for U.S. Fed
eral, California State, and United Nations publi
cations; exceptional holdings of British Parlia
mentary papers; and selected documents from in
ternational agencies and from U.S. state and
local governments. The reference* collection is
particularly strong in statistical materials and
should be regarded as the place to begin whenever
statistics are needed.
Many documents are also acquired by the
Department and listed in the card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or international
agencies germane to the subject collections of
branch libraries.
Many documents are not listed in the main
catalog, but are only listed in the card catalog in
the Documents Department. Records are main
tained there for all government documents in the
University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries, but

General Reference Service
"What famous painter was associated with Flora
Tristan?"
"Did Macßeth ever leave Scotland and if so where
and when did he go?''
"What were the numbers of employed and unem
ployed workers, and the average wage rates, during
the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral or
faculty research — or for a variety of information
needs in between — the staff of the General
Reference Department provide expert help to li
brary users. Located on the main floor of the
Green Library East, the Department responds to
in-person requests, telephone calls, and letters
from inquirers on campus, elsewhere in
California, throughout the United States, and
overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 30,000 volumes, which, in
addition to works of a general nature, contain
specialized material in the humanities and social
sciences, especially in those disciplines for which
no branch or coordinate library exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, encyclo
pedias, guides to important microfilm collections,
indexes and abstracts of journal literature, na
tional and trade bibliographies, newspaper in
dexes, research guides, specialized subject guides,
and union lists of serials, Stanford's as well as
others. Some appreciation of the scope of the
collection may be gained by consulting the Guide
to Selected Reference Materials, available at the
Reference Desk.
Library users are encouraged to consult the staff
at the Reference Desk or Information Desk for
assistance in using the Library's catalogs or any of
the materials listed above. General Reference
staff will also check RLIN* to determine the
status of a book on order or place a rush cataloging
request for a book received but not yet on the
shelves.
University Archives
*
The "collective memory" of Stanford Uni
versity was established in 1965 by the Board of
Trustees to preserve and make available the his
torical record of the University and the Stanford
community. This rich and wonderful store of in
formation and research materials is currently
housed in the Timothy Hopkins Room (3rd floor,
West Wing), awaiting its new quarters in the
Bender Room. *
In the University Archives, the reader will
find, among other things, papers of Stanford fa
culty members and presidents, records of campus
offices and student organizations, Stanford family
scrapbooks and photo albums, publications of all
kinds produced on or about Stanford, theses and
dissertations, photos and slides, maps, prints, and
posters, student letters, diaries, and scrapbooks,
et cetera.

The Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room houses
periodicals, newspapers, and a
diverse collection of microforms.

Researchers have used these collections to
study such topics as Stanford's role in the develop
ment of the electronics industry, the organi
zation and activities of Stanford's students, and
the distinctive architecture here on campus. The
University Archives is open to scholars, students,
authors, and other interested persons regardless of
academic affiliation.
Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green Li
brary's East Wing, houses periodicals, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the most
recent issues of 4,000 selected academic journals
and popular magazines. Current issues of other
journals may be found with their bound back files
in the Stack or in other libraries on campus. The
Stanford Union List of Serials (SULS)*, issued
quarterly on microfiche, provides location and
holdings information for serials* held in the Uni
versity Libraries and in several coordinate
libraries.*

Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
microform of over 800 newspaper titles, some
dating back to the early nineteenth century. Al
though these newspapers are not listed in the
main card catalog or in SULS, card files are main
tained in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room to provide titles, city of origin and holdings
records. Indexes for a number of newspapers, in
cluding the New York Times, may be found in the
Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes: Presi
dential Papers, the History of Women collection,
Early American Imprints, the anthropological
documents contained in the Human Relations
Area File, AEC Technical Reports, British Par
liamentary Papers, census reports dating back to
1790, and the collection of Three Centuries of
American and British Drama. These large
micropublishing projects were designed to make a
great body of historical material easily accessible
to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in
the card catalog. However, guides to the indi
vidual collections are available in the Microtexts
Room. Readers interested in material that may be
contained in the microform collections should
inquire at the Reference Desk or the Current
Periodicals and Microtexts Reference Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm and
microfiche are available in the Microtexts Read
ing Room. There are also portable microfilm
readers available for ten day loan.

Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than IV2 million vol
umes which comprise the main research collec
tion of the University Libraries, as well as ad
ministering all study spaces located within the
Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, staff, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is
also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies, Dissertation Rooms and Group
Studies); branch library hours and locations; the
UCB/Stanford Research Library Cooperative
Program ; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.

Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
microform of over 800 newspaper titles, some
dating back to the early nineteenth century. Al
though these newspapers are not listed in the
main card catalog or in SULS, card files are main
tained in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room to provide titles, city of origin and holdings
records. Indexes for a number of newspapers, in
cluding the New York Times, may be found in the
Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes: Presi
dential Papers, the History of Women collection,
Early American Imprints, the anthropological
documents contained in the Human Relations
Area File, AEC Technical Reports, British Par
liamentary Papers, census reports dating back to
1790, and the collection of Three Centuries of
American and British Drama. These large
micropublishing projects were designed to make a
great body of historical material easily accessible
to scholars.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in
the card catalog. However, guides to the indi
vidual collections are available in the Microtexts
Room. Readers interested in material that may be
contained in the microform collections should
inquire at the Reference Desk or the Current
Periodicals and Microtexts Reference Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm and
microfiche are available in the Microtexts Read
ing Room. There are also portable microfilm
readers available for ten day loan.

Central Circulation
The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than IV2 million vol
umes which comprise the main research collec
tion of the University Libraries, as well as ad
ministering all study spaces located within the
Green Library.
Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, staff, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Desk staff is happy to answer any
questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is
also the place to direct questions concerning the
assignment of Library study space (including
Faculty Studies, Dissertation Rooms and Group
Studies); branch library hours and locations; the
UCB/Stanford Research Library Cooperative
Program ; and public transportation in the Bay
Area and the various commuter services which
serve the Stanford community.
Most humanities and social sciences materials
which constitute the main research collection are
located in the Green Library Stack, comprised of
tast (E), West (W) and South (S) stacks. All
of these materials are designated 'STACK' or
'STK' in the card catalog and in SULS.* Stack
Directories are posted throughout the Library in
dicating location of materials by stack (E, W,S) or
other symbol. Some older materials are located in
Auxiliary Storage and must be requested at the
Loan Desk. Loan Desk staff members will be glad
to help readers determine in which of the loca
tions material they are seeking is housed and
arrange to have material paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library books
and the Green Library Self-Guided Tour Cassette
Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer information regard
ing borrowing policies as well as general Library
information; handle Graduate Reserves; take
paging requests for items needed from the Aux
iliary Stack; recall* materials needed from other
readers; search for items not found on Library
shelves; process overdue, lost or other problem
charges, and provide a review and appeals service
regarding assessment of fees . Questions regarding
Lost and Found may also be directed to Loan Desk
staff members. Materials borrowed through In
terlibrary Loan (ILL) or UCB's Baker Service*
may be picked up at the Loan Desk, located on
the first floor of the East Wing.
With more than 30 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack Division staff is kept busy
reshelving hundreds of books daily as well as or
ganizing shelves so that books are in their proper
locations when needed. In addition, the Stack
staff administer lockers located throughout the
East Stack; page books for the physically limited;
keep study space for library users clear of extrane
ous materials; report building problems; keep
holders throughout the Library full of blank
charge cards and Stanford University Library
(SUL) Guides; and empty Library book returns

located outside of the Library. Questions may be
directed to members of the Stack staff in the
Lower Level Stack Sort Room (Room 42A).
Upon leaving the East Wing, everyone is asked
by the Portal Staff to open all bags and briefcases
for inspection of Library materials. This is to
insure against uncharged materials leaving the
Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff look
forward to answering any questions you may have
regarding services offered by the Department or
general informational questions about the
Library.

Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of the
Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of the
USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, the natural
vegetation of California, or gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in Room 200 on the second floor of West
Wing.
A map specialist provides assistance in the use
of the map card catalog, gazetteers and indexes.
She will help a patron find appropriate carto
graphic reference works, or locate and retrieve
needed materials from the map cases. Maps may
be loaned to all authorized Stanford borrowers.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related in
formation; for example, the Branner Earth Sci
ences Library contains a large collection of goo
logical maps, or the Physics Library houses
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas.

Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours may
be arranged with the Map Specialist, Karyl Tonge
(7-1811).
Government Documents
Question: What do a list of plants "native" to
California, the text of the Panama Canal Treaty, a
picture of the moon's surface, gas mileage ratings for
American and foreign cars, and a list of bans and
credits contracted by Pakistan, have in common?
Answer: All are found in government docu
ments.*
Documents provide primary sources for re
search, a better understanding of the events be
hind today's headlines, and information essential
to being an informed consumer, voter, or citizen.
Located on the first floor of the Green Library's
West Wing, the Government Documents De
partment houses about 250,000 government pub
lications, or roughly half of Stanford's total docu
ments holdings. In the Department proper, users
will find the depository collections for U.S. Fed
eral, California State, and United Nations publi
cations; exceptional holdings of British Parlia
mentary papers; and selected documents from in
ternational agencies and from U.S. state and
local governments. The reference* collection is
particularly strong in statistical materials and
should be regarded as the place to begin whenever
statistics are needed.
Many documents are also acquired by the
Department and listed in the card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or international
agencies germane to the subject collections of
branch libraries.
Many documents are not listed in the main
catalog, but are only listed in the card catalog in
the Documents Department. Records are main
tained there for all government documents in the
University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries, but

General Reference Service
"What famous painter was associated with Flora
Tristan?"
"Did Macßeth ever leave Scotland and if so where
and when did he go?''
"What were the numbers of employed and unem
ployed workers, and the average wage rates, during
the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral or
faculty research — or for a variety of information
needs in between — the staff of the General
Reference Department provide expert help to li
brary users. Located on the main floor of the
Green Library East, the Department responds to
in-person requests, telephone calls, and letters
from inquirers on campus, elsewhere in
California, throughout the United States, and
overseas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 30,000 volumes, which, in
addition to works of a general nature, contain
specialized material in the humanities and social
sciences, especially in those disciplines for which
no branch or coordinate library exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, encyclo
pedias, guides to important microfilm collections,
indexes and abstracts of journal literature, na
tional and trade bibliographies, newspaper in
dexes, research guides, specialized subject guides,
and union lists of serials, Stanford's as well as
others. Some appreciation of the scope of the
collection may be gained by consulting the Guide
to Selected Reference Materials, available at the
Reference Desk.
Library users are encouraged to consult the staff
at the Reference Desk or Information Desk for
assistance in using the Library's catalogs or any of
the materials listed above. General Reference
staff will also check RLIN* to determine the
status of a book on order or place a rush cataloging
request for a book received but not yet on the
shelves.
University Archives
*
The "collective memory" of Stanford Uni
versity was established in 1965 by the Board of
Trustees to preserve and make available the his
torical record of the University and the Stanford
community. This rich and wonderful store of in
formation and research materials is currently
housed in the Timothy Hopkins Room (3rd floor,
West Wing), awaiting its new quarters in the
Bender Room. *
In the University Archives, the reader will
find, among other things, papers of Stanford fa
culty members and presidents, records of campus
offices and student organizations, Stanford family
scrapbooks and photo albums, publications of all
kinds produced on or about Stanford, theses and
dissertations, photos and slides, maps, prints, and
posters, student letters, diaries, and scrapbooks,
et cetera.

The Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room houses
periodicals, newspapers, and a
diverse collection of microforms.

Researchers have used these collections to
study such topics as Stanford's role in the develop
ment of the electronics industry, the organi
zation and activities of Stanford's students, and
the distinctive architecture here on campus. The
University Archives is open to scholars, students,
authors, and other interested persons regardless of
academic affiliation.
Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Room
The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green Li
brary's East Wing, houses periodicals, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the most
recent issues of 4,000 selected academic journals
and popular magazines. Current issues of other
journals may be found with their bound back files
in the Stack or in other libraries on campus. The
Stanford Union List of Serials (SULS)*, issued
quarterly on microfiche, provides location and
holdings information for serials* held in the Uni
versity Libraries and in several coordinate
libraries.*

Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
