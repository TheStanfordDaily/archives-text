excluding those in the Coordinate Libraries.*
Government document serials are listed in
SULS.*
Documents reference staff are available during
all hours the Department is open to provide able
assistance in finding documents information.
Further information about Government Docu
ments is available directly from the staff of the
department or in the Library Guide: Hav to Find
Government Documents.

Computerized literature searches
are conducted in various subject
disciplines.

Special Collections
Too often viewed only as treasures to be ap
preciated from afar rather than used, the rare
books and manuscripts housed in the Department
of Special Collections are an important resource
for all members of the Stanford community. Any
one with a scholarly need may consult Special
Collections and visitors are always welcome to
view the exhibits.
Special collections materials do not circulate,
but may be used in the Field Room, formerly the
General Reference Room on the 2nd floor of the
Green Library, West Wing.
Of interest not only to Stanford but also to
scholars at large are the Charlotte Ashley Felton
Collection of 19th and 20th century English and
American literature, the Morgan A. and Aline
D. Gunst Collection on the history of printing
and the book arts, the Memorial Library of Music,
the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir Isaac
Newton and the History of Scientific Thought,
the Theater Collection (containing books as well
as theater ephemera) and the Stanford Collection
of German, Swiss, and Austrian Culture. The
general Rare Book Collection contains anti
quarian and valuable books in all subject areas
except those covered by the "special" collections
just listed.
The Manuscript Division within the Depart
ment collects a variety of unique, original mate
rial, ranging from Greek papyrus to medieval
manuscripts and contemporary letters and manu
scripts of such writers as John Steinbeck, W.B.
Yeats and D.H. Lawrence. The Division's hold
ings are also strong in material on the Civil War
period, the early 20th century Progressive Move
ment in California, California Farm Labor His
tory, and Chicano History.
Each year the Department sponsors several
major exhibits in which a portion of its holdings is
displayed. Recent exhibits have focused on
Somerset Maugham, the New Almaden mine,
and authors studied in the Western Culture
Program.
Another activity which may be of interest to
some is a Student Book Collecting Contest spon
sored jointly with the Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries. Fov details, students should
contact the librarians in Special Collections.

Data Services I:
Computerized
Literature Searching
Most libraries in the Stanford University
campus provide online computerized literature
searches of various commercially available data
bases that are produced by learned societies, as
sociations, government agencies, and other or
ganizations. The Libraries have access to over 100
data bases of national or international scope
through contracts with three companies: 1) Bib
liographic Retrieval Services, 2) Lockheed Infor
mation Systems, and 3) System Development
Corporation. Online searches usually yield a
computer-generated list of bibliographic cita
tions, often with abstracts, to journal articles,
books, dissertations, technical reports, govern
ment publications, or other material on your re
search interests. Biographical information and
statistical compilations can be retrieved from
searches of some data bases. In some cases,
searches establish that little or no material exists
on a specific question in one or more data bases.
This is often valuable information for those indi
viduals seeking to verify that they are not
duplicating prior research. In addition to single
retrospective searches, current awareness profiles
can be established on several data bases to provide
researchers with automatic monthly searches.
These online searches are conducted on a fee
basis for current faculty, students, and staff of
Stanford University by library staff experienced in
effectively utilizing the high levels of speed and
flexibility which characterize this process. Key
words, chosen during the client interview to ex
press the topic under investigation, can often be
searched in titles, abstracts, and assigned subject
terms of material that constitutes the data base.
Two or more concepts of related keywords can be
quickly matched to complete the inquiry process.
When necessary, and based on intermediate
search results (i.e., titles of articles) displayed at
the computer terminal, strategy can be modified
to better express the question being searched.
The client's review of selected titles during the
process mentioned above aids the search analyst's
efforts to more effectively tailor search strategy.
Printouts from most searches are generated at a
remote computer facility (i.e., offline) and made
available to the client within three to four busi
ness days of the search. Search results can be
printed on the Library's computer printer, usually
at a higher cost than offline printing.
Client charges are based on the number of
computer connect minutes required for the search
plus the cost of offline printouts. A retrospective
search, yielding fifty citations, might range from
an average cost of $10 for the ERIC database to
$30 for BIOSIS Previews, Psychological Ab
stracts, and Management Contents, to $50 for
the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange.
Charges for current awareness profiles, yielding a
monthly average of fifteeen citations, consist of
the initial cost to search the data base in esta
blishing the profile as well as a monthly charge
which averages $5 to $10.

Computerized literature searches are con
ducted in various subject disciplines, including:
the applied and biological sciences, technology,
business, the social sciences, and the humanities.
Those interested in additional information
should contact either Green Library Reference
Department or the appropriate branch or coordi
nate library on campus.
Data Services II:
Social Science Data Files
A wealth of non-bibliographic information,
available on computer tapes may be accessed
through the Stanford University Libraries and the
Stanford Center for Information Technology
(CIT). These data tapes are acquired primarily
from the Inter-University Consortium for Politi
cal and Social Research (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, and report on attitudes and social ex
periences in the United States, Europe, and other
selected countries. They include studies in such
disciplines as political science, sociology, eco
nomics, social psychology, and education.
Data tapes are also acquired from private re
searchers, the Roper Public Opinion Research
Center, government agencies and other selected
data archives. The Roper Center tapes contain
public opinion surveys from the United States,
and over 80 other countries, on various public
policy and consumer issues. A typical search of
such a file would yield a list of questions asked on a
specific topic and a tabulation of answers by vari
ous characteristics such as age or geographic loca
tion. Searches of these data tapes are charged to
CIT accounts. Green Library collects the code
books for these tapes and updates the Data File
Directory. This directory lists files (data tapes)
acquired by the University Libraries and is avail
able in a printed format in most campus libraries
or online through SPIRES.
Additional information about the data tapes is
available from subject bibliographers in the Uni
versity Libraries or from Karen Wittenborg, Gen
eral Reference Department, Green Library
(7-1811).
