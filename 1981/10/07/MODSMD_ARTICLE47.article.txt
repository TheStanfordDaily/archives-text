excluding those in the Coordinate Libraries.*
Government document serials are listed in
SULS.*
Documents reference staff are available during
all hours the Department is open to provide able
assistance in finding documents information.
Further information about Government Docu
ments is available directly from the staff of the
department or in the Library Guide: Hav to Find
Government Documents.

Computerized literature searches
are conducted in various subject
disciplines.

Special Collections
Too often viewed only as treasures to be ap
preciated from afar rather than used, the rare
books and manuscripts housed in the Department
of Special Collections are an important resource
for all members of the Stanford community. Any
one with a scholarly need may consult Special
Collections and visitors are always welcome to
view the exhibits.
Special collections materials do not circulate,
but may be used in the Field Room, formerly the
General Reference Room on the 2nd floor of the
Green Library, West Wing.
Of interest not only to Stanford but also to
scholars at large are the Charlotte Ashley Felton
Collection of 19th and 20th century English and
American literature, the Morgan A. and Aline
D. Gunst Collection on the history of printing
and the book arts, the Memorial Library of Music,
the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir Isaac
Newton and the History of Scientific Thought,
the Theater Collection (containing books as well
as theater ephemera) and the Stanford Collection
of German, Swiss, and Austrian Culture. The
general Rare Book Collection contains anti
quarian and valuable books in all subject areas
except those covered by the "special" collections
just listed.
The Manuscript Division within the Depart
ment collects a variety of unique, original mate
rial, ranging from Greek papyrus to medieval
manuscripts and contemporary letters and manu
scripts of such writers as John Steinbeck, W.B.
Yeats and D.H. Lawrence. The Division's hold
ings are also strong in material on the Civil War
period, the early 20th century Progressive Move
ment in California, California Farm Labor His
tory, and Chicano History.
Each year the Department sponsors several
major exhibits in which a portion of its holdings is
displayed. Recent exhibits have focused on
Somerset Maugham, the New Almaden mine,
and authors studied in the Western Culture
Program.
Another activity which may be of interest to
some is a Student Book Collecting Contest spon
sored jointly with the Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries. Fov details, students should
contact the librarians in Special Collections.

Data Services I:
Computerized
Literature Searching
Most libraries in the Stanford University
campus provide online computerized literature
searches of various commercially available data
bases that are produced by learned societies, as
sociations, government agencies, and other or
ganizations. The Libraries have access to over 100
data bases of national or international scope
through contracts with three companies: 1) Bib
liographic Retrieval Services, 2) Lockheed Infor
mation Systems, and 3) System Development
Corporation. Online searches usually yield a
computer-generated list of bibliographic cita
tions, often with abstracts, to journal articles,
books, dissertations, technical reports, govern
ment publications, or other material on your re
search interests. Biographical information and
statistical compilations can be retrieved from
searches of some data bases. In some cases,
searches establish that little or no material exists
on a specific question in one or more data bases.
This is often valuable information for those indi
viduals seeking to verify that they are not
duplicating prior research. In addition to single
retrospective searches, current awareness profiles
can be established on several data bases to provide
researchers with automatic monthly searches.
These online searches are conducted on a fee
basis for current faculty, students, and staff of
Stanford University by library staff experienced in
effectively utilizing the high levels of speed and
flexibility which characterize this process. Key
words, chosen during the client interview to ex
press the topic under investigation, can often be
searched in titles, abstracts, and assigned subject
terms of material that constitutes the data base.
Two or more concepts of related keywords can be
quickly matched to complete the inquiry process.
When necessary, and based on intermediate
search results (i.e., titles of articles) displayed at
the computer terminal, strategy can be modified
to better express the question being searched.
The client's review of selected titles during the
process mentioned above aids the search analyst's
efforts to more effectively tailor search strategy.
Printouts from most searches are generated at a
remote computer facility (i.e., offline) and made
available to the client within three to four busi
ness days of the search. Search results can be
printed on the Library's computer printer, usually
at a higher cost than offline printing.
Client charges are based on the number of
computer connect minutes required for the search
plus the cost of offline printouts. A retrospective
search, yielding fifty citations, might range from
an average cost of $10 for the ERIC database to
$30 for BIOSIS Previews, Psychological Ab
stracts, and Management Contents, to $50 for
the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange.
Charges for current awareness profiles, yielding a
monthly average of fifteeen citations, consist of
the initial cost to search the data base in esta
blishing the profile as well as a monthly charge
which averages $5 to $10.

Computerized literature searches are con
ducted in various subject disciplines, including:
the applied and biological sciences, technology,
business, the social sciences, and the humanities.
Those interested in additional information
should contact either Green Library Reference
Department or the appropriate branch or coordi
nate library on campus.
Data Services II:
Social Science Data Files
A wealth of non-bibliographic information,
available on computer tapes may be accessed
through the Stanford University Libraries and the
Stanford Center for Information Technology
(CIT). These data tapes are acquired primarily
from the Inter-University Consortium for Politi
cal and Social Research (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, and report on attitudes and social ex
periences in the United States, Europe, and other
selected countries. They include studies in such
disciplines as political science, sociology, eco
nomics, social psychology, and education.
Data tapes are also acquired from private re
searchers, the Roper Public Opinion Research
Center, government agencies and other selected
data archives. The Roper Center tapes contain
public opinion surveys from the United States,
and over 80 other countries, on various public
policy and consumer issues. A typical search of
such a file would yield a list of questions asked on a
specific topic and a tabulation of answers by vari
ous characteristics such as age or geographic loca
tion. Searches of these data tapes are charged to
CIT accounts. Green Library collects the code
books for these tapes and updates the Data File
Directory. This directory lists files (data tapes)
acquired by the University Libraries and is avail
able in a printed format in most campus libraries
or online through SPIRES.
Additional information about the data tapes is
available from subject bibliographers in the Uni
versity Libraries or from Karen Wittenborg, Gen
eral Reference Department, Green Library
(7-1811).

FASTBOOK
FASTBOOK, a service unit of the General
Reference Department, provides delivery of li
brary materials and photocopy delivery to library,
home, or office, for faculty, staff, and graduate
students. Requests may be called in, 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week, by phoning the FASTBOOK
coordinating unit in the Green Library at 7-
FAST (7-3278). The requester need not know if
or where the material is located on campus.
FASTBOOK staff will search to see if Stanford
owns it and arrange for its delivery to the desired
location. Requesters are notified whether or not
the item is found, or if it is found but cannot
circulate.

Interlibrary Loan
No single university library, even one as large and
comprehensive as Stanford's, can contain in its
collections all of the recorded information needed
by its faculty and students to pursue their re
search. National and even international inter
library agreements, long established for the
mutual support of exceptional research needs,
continue to be relied upon to supplement even
the most comprehensive research collections.
Located in Room 151 on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Green Library, the University
Libraries' Interlibrary Loan staff processes re
quests for needed material not available on
campus. Faculty, registered students and staff may
submit requests, in person only, on forms avail
able at most public service desks. (Students in

Faculty and students have a variety
of options available to them for
learning about library resources.

the Schools of Law, Business, and Medicine are
encouraged to make ILL requests at their respec
tive coordinate library.)
Interested users should be aware that most
libraries will not lend certain types of material,
such as rare, fragile, or expensive items; basic
reference or heavily-used books; or genealogical
material, newspapers, periodicals, and many
American dissertations. Many of these items are,
however, available on microfilm.
Requests may take from 2 or 3 days to 2 or 3
months to fill, depending on whether the mate
rial is available from another library in the Bay
Area or from somewhere else much farther afield.
Stanford is a member of the Research Libraries
Group (RLG)* which consists of more than 25
major research libraries including Yale, Michi
gan, Princeton, and Columbia. Communication
of requests and replies within this group is by
electronic mail (RLIN message system) and the
transmission of materials by United Parcel Ser
vice, resulting in much quicker response than in
times past. The RLIN Message System is also used
to send requests to UC Berkeley and materials are
passed between the two campuses, carried twice
daily on the Gutenberg Express, the intercampus
shuttle.
All materials borrowed through Interlibrary
Loan must be picked up and returned to the Loan
Desk on the first floor of the Green Library, East
Wing.

Sharing Library Resources
In addition to providing traditional interlibrary
loan services, Stanford participates in several spe
cialized cooperative arrangements which facil
itate access and which broaden considerably the
range of research materials available to its
scholars.
The U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library
Cooperative Program is a cooperative effort (be
gun in 1977 and grant-funded through 1980)
which affects many aspects of both libraries' op
erations. One of the Program's principal objec
tives is to facilitate bibliographic and physical
access to the collections of each for the faculty,
academic staff and graduate students of both in
stitutions. It also provides for cooperative deci
sion-making in the acquisition of expensive and
little-used materials.
At present, the Program provides registered
participants with reciprocal borrowing privileges
at the "other" campus, campus-to-campus deliv
ery of library materials, intercampus shuttle ser
vice and, through RLIN, immediate access to one
another's bibliographic records. Copies of
Berkeley's Serials Union List, and a joint keyword
index to both it and SULS,* are located in library
locations throughout campus. Further informa
tion is available in a brochure entitled "More
Than the Library Next Door" or by calling
7-1491.
In the spring of 1979, Stanford joined the Re
search Libraries Group (RLG)* which presently
consists of 20 research libraries such as Yale,
Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, and the New
York Public Libraries.
Resource development and sharing will be an
integral part of the RLG program. Efforts are
currently underway to improve speed of inter
library loans by giving top priority to each other's
requests and utilizing delivery services faster than
the U.S. mail. Also under way is an effort to
develop direct user access to each other's collec
tions. As these programs develop, the Stanford
community will be kept informed through the
Campus Report and the Daily.

Tours, Orientation,
Instruction
Faculty and students have a variety of options
available to them for learning as much as they
need or want to know about library resources and
using the libraries at Stanford.
TOURS
Green Library: a 20-minute, self-guided cassette
tour directs the listener to public service areas
within the Green Library and explains major ser
vices offered. Cassette players and earphones are
available at Graduate Reserves throughout the
year.
Central Map Collection: Half-hour tours of the
Central Map Collection in the Green Library are
given starting at 3 p.m. on the first two Thursdays
of each quarter and upon request thereafter.

For an explanation of this and other library jargon, see page 11

Meyer Library: 20-minute orientation tours of
the Meyer Library are given at 9a. m., 10 a. m., 11
a.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. during the first
week of autumn quarter, and at 1 p.m., 2 p.m,
and 3 p.m. during the second week. A printed
self-paced tour of Meyer is available in the guide
rack on the second floor.
Branch Libraries: Most branch and coordinate
libraries offer tours to new students and faculty at
the beginning of each quarter or upon request.
Details are available in the individual libraries.
Other: Librarians in Government Documents,
Special Collections, General Reference, the
University Archives, and Meyer Library provide
specialized tours or instruction tailored to the
needs of a particular class upon the request of the
instructor. Interested faculty or TA's should con
tact the appropriate library for details.

COURSES
Library I: A 3-unit course, "Library Resources
and Research Methods", is taught each autumn,
winter, and spring quarter by the Meyer libra
rians. The course offers all levels of Stanford
students a practical introduction to library collec
tions and services, with projects geared to the
interests of individual class members.
Advanced bibliography courses in Music, Art,
Slavic, German, and Latin American studies are
offered once each year by the appropriate libra
rian. Interested students should consult the cur
rent Courses and Degrees for details.

PUBLICATIONS
A series of information pamphlets, Guides to
the Stanford University Libraries, has been designed
to advise library users of library services, make
them aware of resources and collections, and ex
plain techniques for retrieving specialized infor
mation of which they may not have been aware.
The series presently includes topics such as "How
to Find Government Documents", "Biblio
graphic Guide to the Card Catalog", "Biblio
graphic Guide to the Shelf List", and "Subject
Specialists." Future topics include "Subject
Guide to Classification", and "Guide to Micro
fiche." The series is reviewed periodically and
suggestions for additional titles are welcomed.
Other publications -provide information on
special services, borrowing regulations, recent ac
quisitions, et cetera.

EXHIBITS
In addition to the major exhibits mounted
quarterly by the Department of Special Collec
tions, smaller exhibits are on view for varying
periods of time in the 3rd floor corridor outside
the University Archives, in the Government
Documents reading room, and in a number of the
branch and coordinate libraries. These displays,
drawing on the holdings of the department or
library responsible, highlight a particular portion
of that collection or publicize new acquisitions or
services. Schedules are listed in the Campus
Report.

Auxiliary Services
Action Boxes. Library Action Boxes are located
on the first floor of the East Wing of the Green
Library and the second floor of the Meyer Library.
Similar boxes are located in other campus
libraries also. The Libraries welcome recommen
dations for book purchases or comments about
library services. Written responses are provided
upon request. Responses to suggestions are posted
on bulletin boards in the Green Library and also
in the Meyer Library.
Book Sales. Held in the Gift and Exchange
Division in West Green on the first Wednesday of
each month from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Duplicate
items or materials outside the scope of Stanford's
collections are offered for sale at prices generally
$ 1 or less.
Lost and Found. The Loan Desks in the Green
and Meyer Libraries are the central receiving
points for items lost in those two buildings.
Photocopy. No longer will users need to fill their
pockets with change in order to make photo
copies. Copy machines located throughout the
Stanford University Libraries now operate with a
COPICARD (or coins if desired). The COPI
CARD, a plastic card similar to a credit card, will
eliminate the need tor the "right" change and will
also make faster multiple copics. To make copies,

the card is simply inserted in the machine, the
number of copies needed is entered, and the
"print" button is pushed. COPICARDS can be
purchased in the Stanford Bookstore, in Nuts and
Mud in Terman, the Graduate School of Busi
ness Photocopy Center, or in the Library Photo
copy Room (107, West Green) in denominations
ranging from 100 copies for $7.50 to 5000 copies
for $237.50. The COPICO machines are located
in the Green Library in the Reference Room and
in the Communication Rooms on the stack floors
in the East Wing, on the fourth level of the West
stack, and in the South stack. These copiers are
also available in the Meyer Library and the re
search branches. Copies from mirofilm may be
made in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room (Green Library), the Music Library, Cub
berley Education Library, and Swain Library of
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Operater
run photocopy service is available on the first
floor of the Green Library (Room 107).
Privileges Desk. Located on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Green Library, this desk is the
place to go to inquire about library privileges for
all categories of borrowers or to settle bills for lost
or overdue books.
Study carrels. Meyer Library has a number of
study carrels with accompanying small lockers
available for assignment to undergraduates mak
ing intensive use of Meyer for a short period of
time. Applications for these carrels should be
made at the Loan Desk on the second floor of
Meyer.
Dissertation rooms. A number of rooms in
tended to meet the needs of doctoral students
who are actively engaged in research or writing
their dissertations are available in the East Wing
of the Green Library. Applications may be made
in person at the Privileges Desk during the
quarterly registration period.
Faculty studies. A number of faculty studies
intended to provide space for uninterrupted re
search and writing requiring the use of adjacent
library collections are available in the East Wing
of the Green Library. Members of the Professor
iate (current, emeritus, and visiting) will receive
preference in assignment with members of the
Academic Staff receiving subsequent priority for
available space. Applications for faculty studies
may be made in writing to the Chief, Central
Circulaton, Green Library. The studies may be
assigned for a single or multiple quarters and will
be reassigned annually.
Telephones. Pay phones and ASSU courtesy
campus phones are throughout the Green and
Meyer libraries. For specific details, patrons
should check the Library Guide: Library Services.
Such phones are also generally available in the
buildings in which branch libraries are housed.
Please ask at the service desks in the branch
libraries for more information.
Typewriters. Manual typewriters are available
without charge in the typing rooms on the stack
floors in the East Wing of the Green Library (LL,
E2, E3). Typewriters are also available in the
Meyer Library (fourth floor, Rooms 412-413).
Coin-operated electric typewriters are in Room
413 of Meyer. Users must supply their own paper
and correction materials.
