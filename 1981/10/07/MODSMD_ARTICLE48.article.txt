Art and Architecture
The history of painting, sculpture, the graphic
arts, the decorative arts, and architecture are all
within the scope of the Art and Architecture
Library. Located in the Cummings Art Building,
the 105,000 volume non-circulating collection is
designed primarily to support graduate art re
search. It includes catalogs of the work of im
portant artists, surveys of the art of various re
gions, exhibition catalogs from the U.S. and
foreign art museums, inventories of architectural
monuments, Festschriften, and museum collec
tion catalogs, in addition to art reference works of
all kinds.
Notable among the Library's special collec
tions are the Rowlandson Collection and the J. D.
Ch'en Collection of material on Chinese art. The
Rowlandson Collection contains fine copies of
almost all of the novels and humorous treatises
illustrated by the British artist Thomas Rowland
son (1756-1827).
Reference* books and the latest issues of jour
nals are found in the Reading Room. The rest of
the collection is shelved on three stack levels
open to faculty, staff and graduate students. For
undergraduates and non-Stanford users, material
is paged from the stacks on request. Course re
serve materials for undergraduate and graduate
students are available at the front desk.

Cubberley
Located on the second floor of the Education
Building, the Cubberley Education Library
houses over 150,000 volumes which support
faculty and graduate research in the School of
Education.
The collections include not only education
materials, but a substantial number of titles in
related social science disciplines. Specific holding
strengths include History of Education, Anthro
pology of Education, Sociology of Education, In
ternational Development Education, Counseling
Psychology, Child Development, and Early Edu
cation. Specialized collections include an exten
sive collection of contemporary and historic col
lege and university catalogs and publications, the
complete ERIC Microfiche Collection, 19th
century textbooks, and a large collection of
foreign, international, U.S., state and local gov
ernment documents* pertaining to education.
The Cubberley Library stacks are open and most
of the holdings are available for circulation.
The Cubberley staff of six, including three li
brarians, provide assistance in use of the collec
tion as well as advanced bibliographic instruc
tion. Computerized literature searching in more
than 100 databases is available by appointment to
current Stanford faculty, staff and students. An
RLIN* computer terminal provides bibliographic
access to the holdings of other libraries both on
and off campus.
Orientation tours and in-class bibliographic
lectures are available upon request. The library
also publishes a monthly acquisitions list and a
series of bibliographic aids.

Music
The Music Library, on the second floor of The
Knoll, houses the major collections for music
teaching, research, and performance. Holdings
include books, scores, journals, sound recordings,
microforms, and parts for chamber music ensem
bles. The Music Library is also an important
source of information for schedules and reviews of
musical events in the Bay Area and beyond.
The card catalog in the Music Library includes
all music books and journals regardless of their
location on campus. It is also the only catalog for
scores and recordings, since they are not listed in
the main card catalog in the Green Library. Lis
tening facilities are available in the Music
Library, as are microform readers and a photocopy
machine.
Downstairs, on the first floor of The Knoll, is
the Archive of Recorded Sound whose general
collections comprise classical, popular and folk
music, and spoken word recordings. Included in
the collection are tapes, discs, and cylinders from
the early 1900's to the present. Special collec
tions within the Archive include concerts and
recitals by members of the Department of Music,
public addresses given on the Stanford campus,
Project South (interviews with participants in the
civil rights movement), and early World War II
newscasts.
