# SCIENCE BRANCH LIBRARIES
## 
### 
The bulk of the University Libraries' collections in science and engineering are
assembled in the seven major branch libraries described below. The library of the
Hopkins Marine Station is located in Pacific Grove, two hours south of the
Stanford campus; the remainder are all located on campus and range in size from
30,000 to 75,000 volumes. The combined collections comprise nearly one third of
a million volumes, and include books, journals, technical reports, theses, and other
research materials. In addition, the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir Isaac
Newton and the History of Scientific Thought, housed and maintained by the
Department of Special Collections, contains 4,000 volumes for the study of the
history of science.
In each of the science branch libraries, a reference librarian is available to
provide information and bibliographic assistance in the use of the collections. Each
branch has photocopy facilities and terminals for access to the RLIN* data base.
Since the summer of 1978, computerized literature searching* has been available to
the Stanford scientific community. Data files such as Chemical Abstracts, Physics
Abstracts, Electrical and Electronic Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, the Engineer
ing Index, Science Citation Index, etc., are accessible through this service. Both
current awareness and retrospective searching is possible. Interested persons should
ask the librarian in any of the science branches or contact Harry Llull (7-4672) in
the Mathematical and Computer Science Library for more information.

Engineering, including aeronautics and astro
nautics, electrical engineering, mechanical en
gineering, engineering-economic systems, mate
rials science and engineering, civil engineering,
industrial engineering, and operations research.
In addition to reference* material, monographs,
and serials,* the library houses a large number of
technical reports both in hard copy and micro
fiche.
Course reserves, including a large number of
videotapes, are available at the loan desk. Ser
vices include assistance in locating and obtaining
technical reports and computer searches of auto
mated data bases, as well as traditional reference
service. Persons interested in computer searches
may contact Larry Markworth at 7-1513. A guide
to the Engineering Library is available in the
library or by calling Celine Walker's office at
7-3769.

Engineering Library
The Engineering Library occupies part of the
second through fourth floors of the recently occu
pied Terman Engineering Center. The 75,000
volume collection includes material for research
in eight of the nine departments of the School of

Branner Earth Sciences
Library
The Branner Library supports the under
graduate, graduate and special programs of the
School of Earth Sciences. Its collections include
current and retrospective materials in all fields of
applied earth sciences, geology, geophysics, and
petroleum engineering. State and foreign geolog-"
ical, hydrological, and natural resources maps
and the topographic quadrangles of the U.S.
Geological Survey form a large part of the 72,000
sheet map collection. Reports of the School of
Earth Sciences are also kept on file.
The library is spaciously housed on the second
floor and mezzanine of the Mitchell Earth Sci
ences Building, with a variety of comfortable
reading spaces and group study rooms. The spec
tacular Swoboda Mineral Collection enhances
the foyer entrance area. The librarian, Charlotte
Derksen, may be contacted for information,
reference* assistance, or computerized literature
searching* at 7-2746.

Falconer Biology Library
Located on the third floor of the Biological
Science Center, the Falconer Biology Library
contains over 66,000 volumes, including 2,000
serial* titles. Within the collection, there is
strong emphasis in the areas of cell and develop
mental biology, genetics and molecular biology,
and population biology. The Jasper Ridge Papers
and the Senior Honors Papers are two small spe
cial collections maintained in the library. For
information concerning library services or refer
ence* assistance, library users should contact the
librarian, Michael Sullivan at 7-1528.
