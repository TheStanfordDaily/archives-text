# Oxford denies Stanford overseas campus proposal
##

Stanford's Overseas Studies Program has been
denied permission to relocate a teaching facility in
Oxford, England, according to Overseas Studies
Director Mark Mancall.
Although the University has not yet received an
official explanation from the Oxford City Planning
Committee, Mancall said he speculates that the ac
tion was "political" in nature.
Mancall explained that the City Planning Com
mission — an independent professional body
composed of architects and city planners — sup
ported the Stanford proposal. He said the City
Planning Committee, a subcomittee of the Oxford
City Council, has already vetoed the plan, how
ever.
Mancall said that there are already a large
number of colleges in existence in the city (as part

of Oxford University). This is a possible reason for
the planning committee's decision, he said.
Stanford's proposal included buying and reno
vating a row of dilapidated Georgian houses cur
rently owned by Magdalen College, one of thecol
leges of Oxford University. Mancall said the pro
posal did not include affiliation with Oxford Uni
versity, but with the city itself.
The Overseas Studies Program here currently
operates a campus in Great Britain at the country
estate of Cliveden, a 19th century manor house lo
cated west of London.
According to Mancall, the proposed move from
Cliveden to Oxford is desirable because of Ox
ford's status as "one of the major academic centers
in the English-speaking world."
Mancall said that the University will continue to
run the Cliveden campus, which is secure under

the terms of a lease agreement, subject to renewal
every four years.
Offers from other British universities seeking to
establish formal ties with Stanford are now under
consideration, Mancall said. However, he refused
to name specific universities.
Mancall said that before taking further action,
he will await the official report of the City Planning
Committee. Mancall said he had hoped for the re
port within a week of the committee's decision,
but is now unsure when he will receive the in
formation.
Mancall said he does not expect another over
seas campus to be opened in the near future, but
hopes to establish a campus "outside of Europe —
in Latin America or Asia." "We are always explor
ing other opportunities," he said.
