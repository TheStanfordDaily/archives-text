# Stanford sponsors rape awareness program

### Heather Millar 
Lectures concerning the issues sur
rounding rape, self-defense work
shops, assertiveness-training semi
nars — these are all part of the
"Working Against Rape" program
taking place here this week.
According to Aurora, Stanford's
feminist newspaper, the campaign
for heightened awareness about rape
was inspired by last February's "Take
Back the Night" demonstration — a
candlelit march through areas where
Stanford women had been raped.
In a symposium held Monday
night in Bishop Auditorium, Dr. Step
hanie Riger, a faculty member at Lake
Forest College who has done re
search on women's issues said that
for every reported rape there are
three reported attempts. She said
that this indicates a high percentage
of women fight back, and added that
this response is often ignored.
In 1980, one rape and one at
tempted rape were reported to the
Stanford Police. This year, only one

rape report has been filed with the
department.
However, Captain Raoul Niemeyer
of the Stanford Police Department
said that these figured are low when
considering the number of un
reported rapes, "date rapes," and
rapes which occur in the surround
ing area.
Sharon Silverstein of the Women's
Center said she was "amazed" at how
many women have been raped. "All
you have to do is talk to women," she
explained, "and it's there." She said
that when speaking to a group of
women, someone will have either
first or second-hand knowledge of
rape.
Riger said she estimates that 45
percent of the women she in
terviewed in her research take pre
cautions that severely limit their free
dom.
"We had to be partners to come
here," explained two freshmen
women as they started to walk home
from Monday's symposium. "We
can't even walk through the Quad af

ter twilight."
"I would not walk alone at night,"
said one woman, "... not after all I
heard about last year.. . rapes... as
saults."
Pauline Bart, professor at the Uni
versity of Illinois, said at Monday's
symposium that many traditional
strategies against rapists such as yell
ing and trying to treat the rapist as a
human being do not work.
In addition, Stanford Prof. Cather
ine MacKinnon said that the problem
is not confined to forced intercourse.
"Rape is any act that makes a woman
feel violated," she said.
Although some women said they
felt the symposium served to educate
both sexes, several men who at
tended said they sensed hostility
from the women there.
"I was angry," said one man. "I felt
shut out."
One victim of sexual assault com
mented, "I think it's important to talk
about it (rape) ... I'd hate to have
anyone go through what I went

through."
To prevent women from feeling
restricted by their fear of rape, Stu
dents United for Rape Elimination
(SURE) provide an escort service
from dusk until midnight, Sunday
through Thursday, beginning Oct.
12.
SURE Director Andy Cargile said
he estimates that the service nor
mally gets between two and 10 calls
each night. After an attack or rape on
campus, this figure can increase up to
500 percent, he said.
"Women are afraid (to call)," said
one female SURE escort. "It's difficult
to be dependent on someone (in or
der) to walk three blocks to the li
brary. It's easy to forget..."
The issues of self-defense will be
discussed today at noon in the Wom
en's Center next to the Toyon Hall
eating clubs. Tonight at 7:30 in Roble
Gym, several self-defense groups will
hold demonstrations. Instruction on
the use of tear gas and certification
for its use will take place Saturday.

considering the number of un
reported rapes, "date rapes," and
rapes which occur in the surround
ing area.
Sharon Silverstein of the Women's
Center said she was "amazed" at how
many women have been raped. "All
you have to do is talk to women," she
explained, "and it's there." She said
that when speaking to a group of
women, someone will have either
first or second-hand knowledge of
rape.
Riger said she estimates that 45
percent of the women she in
terviewed in her research take pre
cautions that severely limit their free
dom.
"We had to be partners to come
here," explained two freshmen
women as they started to walk home
from Monday's symposium. "We
can't even walk through the Quad af

ter twilight."
"I would not walk alone at night,"
said one woman, "... not after all I
heard about last year.. . rapes... as
saults."
Pauline Bart, professor at the Uni
versity of Illinois, said at Monday's
symposium that many traditional
strategies against rapists such as yell
ing and trying to treat the rapist as a
human being do not work.
In addition, Stanford Prof. Cather
ine MacKinnon said that the problem
is not confined to forced intercourse.
"Rape is any act that makes a woman
feel violated," she said.
Although some women said they
felt the symposium served to educate
both sexes, several men who at
tended said they sensed hostility
from the women there.
"I was angry," said one man. "I felt
shut out."
One victim of sexual assault com
mented, "I think it's important to talk
about it (rape) ... I'd hate to have
anyone go through what I went

through."
To prevent women from feeling
restricted by their fear of rape, Stu
dents United for Rape Elimination
(SURE) provide an escort service
from dusk until midnight, Sunday
through Thursday, beginning Oct.
12.
SURE Director Andy Cargile said
he estimates that the service nor
mally gets between two and 10 calls
each night. After an attack or rape on
campus, this figure can increase up to
500 percent, he said.
"Women are afraid (to call)," said
one female SURE escort. "It's difficult
to be dependent on someone (in or
der) to walk three blocks to the li
brary. It's easy to forget..."
The issues of self-defense will be
discussed today at noon in the Wom
en's Center next to the Toyon Hall
eating clubs. Tonight at 7:30 in Roble
Gym, several self-defense groups will
hold demonstrations. Instruction on
the use of tear gas and certification
for its use will take place Saturday.
Lectures concerning the issues sur
rounding rape, self-defense work
shops, assertiveness-training semi
nars — these are all part of the
"Working Against Rape" program
taking place here this week.
According to Aurora, Stanford's
feminist newspaper, the campaign
for heightened awareness about rape
was inspired by last February's "Take
Back the Night" demonstration — a
candlelit march through areas where
Stanford women had been raped.
In a symposium held Monday
night in Bishop Auditorium, Dr. Step
hanie Riger, a faculty member at Lake
Forest College who has done re
search on women's issues said that
for every reported rape there are
three reported attempts. She said
that this indicates a high percentage
of women fight back, and added that
this response is often ignored.
In 1980, one rape and one at
tempted rape were reported to the
Stanford Police. This year, only one

rape report has been filed with the
department.
However, Captain Raoul Niemeyer
of the Stanford Police Department
said that these figured are low when
considering the number of un
reported rapes, "date rapes," and
rapes which occur in the surround
ing area.
