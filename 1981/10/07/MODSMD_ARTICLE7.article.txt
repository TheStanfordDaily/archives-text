## NASA no longer alone in space 
### Tim Lundergan 
If a Sunnyvale company has
its way, NASA's monopoly of
the satellite-launching industry
may end soon.
The company, G.C.H., Inc.,
received national news cov
erage August 5 on Matagorda
Island, Texas, when a rocket
module they were testing for
Space Services, Inc. exploded.
G.C.H.'s technical director,
Eric Laursen, a physics student
here between 1970 and 1973,
remains optimistic about his
company's prospects of mas
tering technical difficulties and
undercutting the fees NASA
charges to launch satellites.
Laursen said the August mis
hap occurred because the very
cold propellant combination
then in use caused a valve to
freeze in the Texas humidity.
G.C.H. has since switched from
liquid oxygen and kerosene to
nitric acid and hydrazine, a
warmer fuel mix.
Space Services, Inc. plans to
compete directly with NASA's
"workhorse" rocket, the Delta.
NASA charges between $28
and $52 million to put a satellite
or payload into orbit by this
method, Laursen said.
The space shuttle, which can
accomodate larger payloads,
has guaranteed users a fee of
$35 million for the first four
years of its operation, which
are already booked up.
. Space Services expects to
charge between $5 and $6 mil
lion to launch a payload of 2000
to 5000 pounds, a range rough
ly equivalent to the Delta's ca
pacity.
The Percheron rocket
G.C.H. is designing for Space
Services is a multi-modular ve
hicle, he said. Five to seven
modules, each four feet in
diameter and 55 feet long, will
be clustered together at
launch. During flight some of
them will drop off, as do
NASA's booster rockets. One
module will remain to propel
the satellite to its intended or
bit.
G.C.H. employs a staff of
roughly 20 engineers and con
sultants, mostly in their late 20s
and early 30s. Some of them
have worked on NASA
projects. They intend to com
pete with the space agency by
emphasizing cost effectiveness
in their designs.
"NASA pushes state of the
art technology without regard
to cost," Laursen said. A NASA
spokesman at the Ames Center
at Moffett Field agreed that
their goal has been to mature
technology for others to use.
G.C.H. chose a pressure-fed
rather than a pump-fed engine
because the former, although
less efficient, eliminates the
need for an expensive and
bulky (200 lb.) turbo-driven
pump. The company designs
and manufactures or subcon
tacts for the parts it needs.
Laursen believes his com
pany faces no great technical
obstacles in developing a low
cost launching vehicle. Early
military missiles were relatively
inexpensive — "A rocket is
basically a simple structure,"

he said.
At the Chemical Systems
Division of United Technolo
gies in Sunnyvale, where mis
sile research is conducted, Pub
lic Relations Director Richard
Larrick shared Laursen's view
of the problem's simplicity. "If
they have competent pro
pulsion engineers, there's no
reason they can't do it," Lar
rick said.
United Technologies had
not entered the Satellite
launching business because of
the high investment and
amount of risk involved. "It
takes a lot of money (and) a lot
of luck," he said.
Larrick said he was surprised
to hear that G.C.H. estimated
its total investment prior to the
August 5 test at only slightly
more than SI million. He
agreed that G.C.H.'s plan to
use less advanced, more cost
effective methods was a good
way to produce a "relatively
cheap" rocket.
Space Services, Inc. hopes to
launch its first rocket within a
year to a year and a half. They
plan to launch one rocket a
month, and then four a month
within a year after the first
launch.
G.C.H.'s Laursen believes
publicity from the August mis
hap may have helped call the
attention of investors and
potential customers to the
project. "We got the vehicle
down there and on the pad,"
he said. "It proved we could
deliver the vehicle."
According to Laursen,
NASA's Chief of Propulsion
Henry Pohl, who investigated
the accident, agreed it was
caused by a frozen valve, and
called the problem fairly minor
and easily correctable.
S.S.I, and G.C.H. Inc. were
started specifically for this
project by their respective
heads David Hannah, Jr., and
Gary Hudson. G.C.H. manufac
tures the vehicle for Space Ser
vices, which provides financing
•and recruits potential cus
tomers.
Several corporations have
expressed interest in becoming
clients, Laursen said, but he
would not name them. Poten
tial customers include the
communications industry and
companies gathering data on
agriculture, oil, forestry, and
other natural resources.
Space Services will probably
require a license for launches
to avoid interference with mili
tary satellites and other pro
grams. But problems securing
such a license seem unlikely.
Both Larrick and Laursen in
dicated the Reagan adminis
tration's NASA head, James
Biggs, supports the entry of
private industry into the field.
Larrick quoted Biggs as saying
he expected a number of com
mercial companies to work in
this area in the future.
G.C.H. appears confident of
its success. It is renegotiating its
contract with Space Services in
order to design satellites with
the same cost-cutting ap
proach it has used to design
propulsion systems.
