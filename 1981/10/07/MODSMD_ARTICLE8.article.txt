# New x-rays to improve patient care
## 
### Kristen Christopher 
The possibility of using
synchroton radiation to take
x-ray pictures of blood
vessels in the heart was an
nounced by scientists here
on Monday, Sept. 14, but it
appears that the construc
tion of an accelerator
smaller than the one at Stan
ford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) would great
ly facilitate progress in this
area.
The construction of an ac
celerator specifically for
medical purposes could
produce a major change in
the methods used to "see"
blood vessels in the heart.
Catheterization, the meth
od now used, is expensive,
requires hospitalization,
and involves risk. Hopefully,
synchroton x-rays will be
able to abolish these prob
lems, as the test would sim
ply consist of an injection
and two x-ray pictures.
At the Stanford
Synchroton Radiation Labo
ratory (SSRL), investigators
have been conducting ex
periments using synchroton
radiation that is produced in
an electron and positron
storage ring at SLAC. Ac
cording to Dr. E. Barrie
Hughes, project director
and senior research as
sociate at the High Energy
Physics Laboratory here, this
storage ring, called SPEAR,
was not built for the
purpose of synchroton radi
ation, but generates it as a
by-product.
Synchroton radiation is
produced as electrons whirl
around in storage rings like
SPEAR which are used for
work in particle physics. Sci
entists use mono
chromators, which are
pairs of special crystals de
signed by SSRL, to inter
cept a single-color x-ray
ring. They make their selec
tion based on which fre
quency wnr"E>e~u"ftPmate- wv
sensitivity to the tracer
which has been injected
into the subject.
Two x-ray pictures are
then taken, using miniature
electronic detectors, and
are fed into a computer. The
computer helps to dissolve
the blurriness caused by soft
tissue and bones that exists
in conventional x-rays, and
a clear image remains. This

image is possible because of
the great intensity of
synchroton radiation.
"This new source lets you
do things you couldn't do
before," Hughes said, but
SSRL does not have control
over SPEAR. Therefore,
there is an interest in build
ing an independent source
of synchroton radiation to
be used specifically for med
ical purposes.
This source would be an
accelerator smaller than the
two-mile long accelerator at
SLAC. Although building an
accelerator is a large and ex
pensive project, Hughes
said he feels that the tech
nology is moving quite
rapidly in this field and that
in a few years the cost and
size should decrease.
In the past, non-invasive
methods of angiography
("seeing" heart blood
vessels) have not been suffi
cient, since the conven
tional x-ray tube emits only
a white spectrum, which is
not satisfactory for taking
clear pictures through thick
body sections, like the
chest. A synchroton x-ray
beam, however, has a much
greater intensity than the
beams produced by the x
ray tube, and most notably,
is monochromatic.
While in the future
synchroton radiation may
be commonly used to ob
tain clear pictures of blood
vessels throughout the
body, this technique has not
yet been tested on human
subjects. It has been studied
on simulated body struc
tures, called phantoms, and
on excised pig and calf
hearts.
In reference to applying
this technique to humans,
Hughes said, "We will ex
amine this possibility in a re
search way, hopefully
before the end of this aca
demic year."
The research team con
sists of members of the de
partments of physics and
electrical engineering, and
the Medical Center. Among
the investigators are Nobel
Laureate Robert Hofstadter,
Max Stein, professor of
physics, and Dr. Edward
Rubenstein, professor of
clinical medicine and Medi
cal School associate dean
for post-graduate educa
tion.
