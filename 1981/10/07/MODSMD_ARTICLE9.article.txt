# Filmless x-rays now possible

Amajor improvement in
x-ray technology, a filmless
x-ray system, is being in
stalled at the Medical Cen
ter. A replacement for the
arteriogram which helps in
visualizing the arterial and
vascular -portions of the
body, the method is knoVvn
as digital fluoroscopy. It will
be functional in approx
imately two weeks, said Dr.
Dieter Enzmann, head of
the digital flourpscopy pro
gram at Stanford.
The conventional arterio
gram is a procedure often
used on patients with
tumors, or those suffering
from vascular diseases —
diseases of the heart or ar
teries and pulmonary em
bolisms (obstructions of
blood vessels). Currently
the method requires insert
ing a plastic tube or catheter
into a patient's artery and
steering it to the proper
area. Once there, a contrast
dye is injected, and x-rays
are taken.
Digital fluoroscopy im
proves upon the conven
tional method in several
ways. Contrast dye is in
jected through the veins
rather than the arteries in
what Enzmann terms "a
low-risk intravenous injec
tion." After a few seconds,
the dye travels throughout

the body.
"Then an x-ray tube
shines x-rays through the
patient," Enzmann said,
"Detected on the other side
by an image intensifier, the
rays are converted to elec
trons which are then con
verted to photons, units of
light. A highly specialized
television camera scans the
resulting light, converts it to
electrical signals, digitizes
the output and provides a
computer with the numbers
to analyze and manipulate."
This new procedure
creates major advances in
patient care. First, it signifi
cantly lowers the patient's
risk. Catheters circulating in
arteries carry the risk of ob
structing the vessel, leading
to hemorrhaging or strokes.
Second, digital
fluoroscopy takes 30-45
minutes; whereas a patient
must check-in to the hospi
tal for a conventional
arteriogram.
Third, digital fluoroscopy
bypasses film as a medium,
which, Enzmann said, will al
low for greater versatility in
its use. The radiologist will
be able to isolate areas of in
terest within the image.
With time, he hopes that,
"connected computer
networks will allow for rapid
transfer of data to.increase
efficiency in patient

diagnosis and care."
According to Enzmann
the new procedure will not
cause any significant com
plications. The contrast dye
consists of a water soluble
iodinated solution com
monly used in such radio
logy studies for several dec
ades. Causing no ill-effects,
it is excreted in the urine af
ter a few hours. In rare
cases, patients may be al
lergic to the dye but these
people would not be
eligible for the former pro
cedure.
The radiation level is an
"approximately 50-75 per
cent reduction in dose com
pared to the former arterio
gram," Enzmann said.
In terms of cost, the
equipment would necessi
tate an add-on expenditure
of $200,000. The cost for a
new arteriographic room is
between one half and one
million dollars, but
Enzmann pointed out that
very rarely will a facility
need to purchase an entire
room.
The center hopes to treat
8-10 patients per day using
this system, which in 10-15
years, Enzmann believes will
be the only type of x-ray
system in use.

shines x-rays through the
patient," Enzmann said,
"Detected on the other side
by an image intensifier, the
rays are converted to elec
trons which are then con
verted to photons, units of
light. A highly specialized
television camera scans the
resulting light, converts it to
electrical signals, digitizes
the output and provides a
computer with the numbers
to analyze and manipulate."
This new procedure
creates major advances in
patient care. First, it signifi
cantly lowers the patient's
risk. Catheters circulating in
arteries carry the risk of ob
structing the vessel, leading
to hemorrhaging or strokes.
Second, digital
fluoroscopy takes 30-45
minutes; whereas a patient
must check-in to the hospi
tal for a conventional
arteriogram.
Third, digital fluoroscopy
bypasses film as a medium,
which, Enzmann said, will al
low for greater versatility in
its use. The radiologist will
be able to isolate areas of in
terest within the image.
With time, he hopes that,
"connected computer
networks will allow for rapid
transfer of data to.increase
efficiency in patient

diagnosis and care."
According to Enzmann
the new procedure will not
cause any significant com
plications. The contrast dye
consists of a water soluble
iodinated solution com
monly used in such radio
logy studies for several dec
ades. Causing no ill-effects,
it is excreted in the urine af
ter a few hours. In rare
cases, patients may be al
lergic to the dye but these
people would not be
eligible for the former pro
cedure.
The radiation level is an
"approximately 50-75 per
cent reduction in dose com
pared to the former arterio
gram," Enzmann said.
In terms of cost, the
equipment would necessi
tate an add-on expenditure
of $200,000. The cost for a
new arteriographic room is
between one half and one
million dollars, but
Enzmann pointed out that
very rarely will a facility
need to purchase an entire
room.
The center hopes to treat
8-10 patients per day using
this system, which in 10-15
years, Enzmann believes will
be the only type of x-ray
system in use.

FILMLESS X-RAYS — Dr. Dieter Enzmann of the Medical Center views filmless x-rays on
a digital flouroscope.
Amajor improvement in
x-ray technology, a filmless
x-ray system, is being in
stalled at the Medical Cen
ter. A replacement for the
arteriogram which helps in
visualizing the arterial and
vascular -portions of the
body, the method is knoVvn
as digital fluoroscopy. It will
be functional in approx
imately two weeks, said Dr.
Dieter Enzmann, head of
the digital flourpscopy pro
gram at Stanford.
The conventional arterio
gram is a procedure often
used on patients with
tumors, or those suffering
from vascular diseases —
diseases of the heart or ar
teries and pulmonary em
bolisms (obstructions of
blood vessels). Currently
the method requires insert
ing a plastic tube or catheter
into a patient's artery and
steering it to the proper
area. Once there, a contrast
dye is injected, and x-rays
are taken.
Digital fluoroscopy im
proves upon the conven
tional method in several
ways. Contrast dye is in
jected through the veins
rather than the arteries in
what Enzmann terms "a
low-risk intravenous injec
tion." After a few seconds,
the dye travels throughout

the body.
"Then an x-ray tube
shines x-rays through the
patient," Enzmann said,
"Detected on the other side
by an image intensifier, the
rays are converted to elec
trons which are then con
verted to photons, units of
light. A highly specialized
television camera scans the
resulting light, converts it to
electrical signals, digitizes
the output and provides a
computer with the numbers
to analyze and manipulate."
