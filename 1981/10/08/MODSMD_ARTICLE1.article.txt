# Internships: The Latest Rage
## 
### 
"Preprofessional fever," or the in
ternship concept, is raging around
the country, according to numerous
experts.
Why the sudden popularity? One
very strong reason is that there is no
longer any guarantee that a college
degree, even from a prestigious uni
versity, will necessarily land you a
job in your field upon graduation;
this is especially true for students in
non-technical disciplines.
Each June, employers are inun
dated with applications and re
sumes from college graduates with
solid academic credentials. How
ever, the most successful applicants
(according to employers), are those
whose backgrounds also reflect
some relevant work experience.
An internship is an excellent way
to obtain that hard-to-come-by prac
tical experience which ultimately
gives you the edge in the current
tight job market.
In addition, interning in a profes
sional work situation will allow you
to "reality test" various career areas,
while simultaneously getting ex
perience, training, good references,
and a possible "in" to the field upon
graduation.
Employers are also increasingly
interested in the internship concept,
which is another reason interning is
on the increase. Business and indus

try have found that interns are moti
vated, enthusiastic, and capable
workers who can provide high
quality project assistance, or other
wise backstop their permanent staffs
on necessary assignments. Interns
are a good business investment.
What exactly is an internship? It is
generally a job of limited duration
(usually three, six, or nine months)
which permits undergraduate and
graduate students to work within an
organization in a pre-professional
capacity frequently related to the
student's academic field.
Internships are most often offered
during the summer months, al
though other arrangements are also
available. Interns may work full or
part-time, depending on the needs
of the employers, and compensation
is usually in the form of direct salary
(often quite good) or academic cre
dit.

dent Employment Office has over

ship resources and ideas with you.
