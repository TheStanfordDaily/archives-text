# Howard Figler's Ten Hottest Transferable Skills
## 
### 
Some skills are more equal
than others. I have been en
couraging you to identify your
most powerful talents, with the
implied assumption that every
skill can find a home some
where. While you can expect
all functional and adaptive
skills to have definite value,
you must recognize that certain
skills are universally greeted
with enthusiasm by almost
every employer because these
skills occur with some regular
ity in every job having respon
sibility and requiring de
cisionmaking and good judg
ment. You should pay special
attention to them in the work
you are now doing, look for
them in the nonpaid activity of
your spare time, and comb your
past experiences for evidence
of them.
Budget Management
Get your hot little hands on any
budget you can find, no matter
how small, and take responsi
bility for it. Manage how the
funds are dispensed, keep con
trol of the budget, learn what
fiscal control is all about.
Supervising
Take responsibility for the
work of others in a situation in
which some accountability is
called for. Have direct contact
with the work of others; expose
yourself to the difficulty of giv
ing orders, delegating tasks,
taking guff,"understanding the
other person's viewpoint. Here
is where listening can become
a real feat of skill.
Public Relations
Accept a role in which you
must meet or relate to the pub
lic. Greet visitors, answer

phone complaints, give talks to
community groups, sell ads to
business people, explain prog
rams to prospective clients, or
even collect taxes.
Coping With Deadline Pres
sure
Search for opportunities to
demonstrate that you can pro
duce good work when it is re
quired by external deadlines.
Prove to yourself and anyone
else that you can function on
someone else's schedule, even
when that time frame is notably
hurried.
Negotiating/ Arbitrating
Discover and cultivate the fine
art of dealing openly and effec
tively with people in ambigu
ous situations. Learn how to
bring warring factions to
gether, resolve differences be
tween groups or individuals,
and make demands on behalf of
one constituency to those in
positions of power.
Speaking
Take a leadership role in any
organization, so that you are
forced to talk publicly, prepare
remarks, get across ideas, and
even motivate people without
feeling terribly self-conscious.
Good public speaking is little
more than the art of dramatized
conversation, but it must be
practiced so you can discover
your own personal style.
Writing
Go public with your writing
skills, or even the lack of them.
There is nothing quite so ener
gizing as seeing your own
words in print; exhilarating if
they look good to you, and a
spur to improvement if they
look awful. Practice putting

pen to paper. Write letters to
the editors of every publication
you read routinely. Write a
newsletter, however informal,
for a club or organization to
which you belong.
Org anizing/Manag ing/
Coordinating
Take charge of any event that is
within your grasp. It doesn't
matter what you organize — a
church supper, a parade in
honor of your town's 200 th
birthday — as long as you have
responsibility for bringing to
gether people, resources, and
events. If nothing else, the
headaches of organizing events
or managing projects teach you
how to delegate tasks to others.
Interviewing
Learn how to acquire informa
tion from other people by ques
tioning them directly. Start by
interviewing the neighbors,
your friends, and other people
easily available. It doesn't mat
ter what you ask them, but im
agine you are a newspaper re
porter who needs the informa
tion for a story. Discover the
fine art of helping a person to
feel comfortable in your pre
sence, even though you are ask
ing difficult and even touchy
questions.
T eaching/lnstructing
Refine your ability to explain
things to other people. Since
most teaching takes place not
in the classroom but in ordi
nary everyday exchanges bet
ween people, you should be
come familiar and comfortable
with passing information and
understanding to others. Any
position of leadership or re
sponsibility gives you many
chances to teach ideas and
methods to others.
