Experience
by-Degrees
The Experience-by-Degrees
program, sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association's
Student-Alumni Network,
(STAN), gets students together
with former majors in their
own fields for informal discus
sions about careers and work
experience.
The first of the monthly
programs, on October 20, will
feature graduates of the de
partment of History. This will
be followed by English, En
gineering, Human Biology,
Psychology, Political Science,
International Relations, and
Economics.
The Alumni Contact Service,
which is also operated by the
SAA, gives students an oppor
tunity to go out and talk with
professionals about prospec
tive career fields. This isn't a
job contact service, but a un
ique chance for students to
learn from, and exchange ideas
with, Stanford alumni.
Thus far, the ACS includes
listings from alums in the Bay
Area, New York, Boston, Los
Angeles, Illinois, Texas,
Washington, Oregon, and
Washington, D.C. Each geo
graphical area is grouped by
professional interests.
Spend some time going
through the ACS binders,
which are at Bowman Alumni
House and in the CPPC's career
library.

Employment
Help for
Foreign
Students
The Home Country
Employment Registry, spon
sored by the National Associa

fairs, provides information to
employers seeking U.S.-
educated foreign students
planning to return home.
Since the success of the
program depends on a suffi
ciently large number of foreign
student listings for employers
to use it as their primary source
for identifying U.S.-trained
foreign personnel, Stanford
students from other countries

are urged to take advantage of
the service. Registration forms
are available at the information
area in Bechtel International
Center and at the Engineering
and Science section of the
CPPC.
