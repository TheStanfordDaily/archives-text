# When You're Asking The Questions:
## Informational Interviewing 
### 
Many thoughtful job seekers
nave found informational in
terviewing a useful and effec
tive part of r> successful
employment search
Going out into ihe commun
ity and talking with profes
sionals about their career tieids
is a logical step to take after
you ve done some research on
the job market and have some
what of an idea of the kinds of
jobs or fields you d be in
terested in pursuing. Informa
tional interviewing differs
from employment interview
ing in that you're the one con
ducting the interview. It can be
very useful â€” you get the
rhance to learn about a specific
career area bv asking your own
questions, and by observing

work environments.
While the rnaior purpose ot
this type ot interviewing is
information-gathering, stu
dents have sometimes been
surprised with subsequent job
offers. Also, the person you in
terview can provide vou with
names of others in the same
line ot work wtiom you can
contact.
informational interviewing
and making contacts, or "net
working," whether you do it
through the Alumni Contact
Service or by talking with
friends of your parents, should
help you be more selective
about the jobs you do apply for,
and give you a better shot at
those fields, too.
