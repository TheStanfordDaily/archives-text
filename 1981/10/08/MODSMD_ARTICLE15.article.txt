# Engineering And Science Students: How to Find The Best Jobs
## 
### 
Vou have spent a great deal
of time and effort, not to men
tion monev, on your Stanford
education. Now what? Well,
consider the following:
— In the closing decades of
the 20th century there will
be five to seven job changes
and three to five career
changes in a typical per
son's lifetime. Certain
specialized occupations
even now have a life of only
three to five years.
— By 1990 an estimated 75
percent of our labor force

will be producing services
or goods that haven't even
been invented or aren't yet
generally available.
— In a recent survey pub
lished in New Engineer
Magazine, only 5b percent
of the engineers responding
indicated that they were
getting what they wanted
from their careers.
If your goal is not simply to
find a job, but to obtain the best
possible job, one that takes into
consideration both your short
and long-term objectives, then

you will have to start managing
your career with the same
dedication you have shown in
managing your education.
To aid you in achieving this
objective, a specialized presen
tation on career planning, re
sume writing, creative inter
viewing, and the services of the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center will be given in a
number of departments in Oc
tober and November. Check
early with the Engineering and
Science section of the CPPC or
with your department secre
tary for exact date and time.
