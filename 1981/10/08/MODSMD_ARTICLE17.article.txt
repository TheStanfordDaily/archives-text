# Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind?

### 
Two students walking across
White Plaza one afternoon.
"karin. you know I'm realiv
getting tired of my part-time
job. It's just not giving me
enough experience in what I'm
interested in."
"Have you been to the CPPC
yef"
"The what 9 "
"The Career Planning and
Placement Center. It's that little
building next to the Post Of
fice . . . No, no, not the
bookstore."
"What can they do for me?"
"Well, they can help you get
an internship or a job that has
something to do with what you
want to do when you get out of
here."
"Maybe I'll go by when I
have some time."
"Yeah. I think that's a good
idea."
This conversation did take
place. Senior Steve Eisner and
junior Karin Eid begin a 15-
minute video-tape introduc
tion to the Career Planning and
Placement Center with a walk
through White Plaza and by the
CPPC.
And if you're at all interested
in internships, summer
employment, writing a resume,
asking a professor for a letter of
reference, applying to grad
schools, on-campus recruiting,
part-time jobs during the
school year, or anything hav
ing to do with career planning
or job placement, then you'll
want to see this unique intro
duction to the CPPC's career
planning resources.

Over a dozen Stanford stu
dents, faculty, and staff make
up the principal cast. The vid
eotape introduces the CPPC's
services, and coaches you as a
job seeker on effectiveness in
the employment market. The
narrative answers questions
such as, "How do I get a good
letter of reference from a pro
fessor?"; "What's the best way
to go about getting a job wi th an
employer who doesn't recruit
on campus?"; and "How do I
find a good summer intern
ship'''
You'll see what a placement
file is, and what it looks like
when we send it out to
employers or grad schools (as
well as how dusty it can get if
you don't keep it up to date
with new references).
You'll get a review of our
weekly career-planning work
shops ("What's self
assessment?" you were won
dering), and see a student in a
mock interview using our in
house camera.
An employer gives you im
portant tips on preparing for an
interview. And a CPPC coun
selor outlines job-hunting
basics, including how best to
use CPPC's career library and
other on-campus resources.
The videotape will be shown
at noon at the CPPC every
Monday and Thursday. You
can also view it on your own in
the career library any time dur
ing the day.
For an informative (and
sometimes humorous) look at
career planning, it's a great
starting point for all Stanford
students.
