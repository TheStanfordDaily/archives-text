# New Signup Procedure For Recruiting Interviews
## 
### 
Liberal arts seniors who observed (or heard about)
early-morning lines in front of the CPPC last year can
be relieved about one thing â€” there is a new system
for signing up for on-campus interviews.
Long lines by 8 a.m. were common when many
students waited to sign up for interviews with popu
lar companies. The new procedure will eliminate the
lines by requiring students to bid points for space on
recruiting schedules. Each student receives a fixed
number of points at the beginning of the year. Those
bidding the highest number of points for a certain
company will get the interviews.
The CPPC staff hopes that this method will make
on-campus interviewing accessible to more liberal
arts students. It should enable all interested students
to talk with at least some of the organizations in
which they have the greatest interest. These features
make the bidding system a significant improvement
in the recruiting program.
Everyone who would like to take part in on-campus
recruiting should stop by the CPPC for a registration
packet and more information about scheduling inter
views. There will also be recruiting information ses
sions on October 13th and 20th, and January 12th and
13th, at noon, in the CPPC.
