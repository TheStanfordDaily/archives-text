### Karen Eid, Junior 
So, it's your first year at Stan
ford? Well, don't bother going
to the Career Planning and
Placement Center yet (veterans
refer to it as the CPPC). I mean,
there's no need to be concerned
about what you might want to
do once you leave this place.
Never mind that the CPPC
has a great liberal arts library
with tapes, books, and direc
tories on several career areas
which you could begin inves
tigating. Go ahead and blow it
off until your senior year when
it may seem too overwhelming.
Yes, there are self
assessment, resume-writing,
interviewing, and job-hunting
workshops held every week.
You could attend these to
polish up those skills which
are an integral part of the job
search or in locating a summer
position. Who wants to think
about gaining valuable work
experience or making some
extra money at the same time,
though?
True, the CPPC's Internships
and Student Employment Of
fice does have listings of part
time work on campus (includ
ing the CPPC itself) or around
the area, making it easy to find
employment. It also has infor

mation about internships and
jobs available during the sum
mer. No reason tostart thinking
about summer work, although
many summer recruiters inter
view here early in the year.
Finally, you could acciden
tally make an appointment
with a CPPC or Peer Counselor
to help you start making a
thoughtful career-search plan
now instead of later as an l'm-
Gonna-Graduate-and-What
am-I-Gonna-Do? Senior.
But don't allow such things
to concern you now.
