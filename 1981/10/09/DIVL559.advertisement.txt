imagination It's
the key element in
the increasingly
demanding search for
new oil and gas But
imagination has to
be fostered, given an
environment to
thrive in
At Amoco Production
Company, our
engineers have this
environment They are
free to use their minds,
to question, to take
risks And that's one
of the reasons we are
the nation's most
active wildcatter and
an industry leader in
total number of wells
drilled
Imagination At
Amoco, we encourage
it and we nourish it
