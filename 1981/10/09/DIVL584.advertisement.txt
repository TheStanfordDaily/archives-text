The P r oduct Engineers' exposure is in 2 stages
of manufacturing; wafer form and finished package.
Product Engineers help detect problems at the wafer and
package level, analyze results, develop test methods &
refer information for necessary changes.
Process Engineers
Process Engineers interface extensively with both
design & product engineering in first hand involvement
with the manufacturing of the integrated circuit. Initial
exposure will be in the process sustaining & develop
ment of a silicon slice (wafer) in the manufacturing or
production environment.
Test Engineers
The DG Test Engineer is involved in both system
hardware & software development. The rigid quality &
reliability of the IC's will depend upon the various
complex test capabilities of both the wafer &
■ ackage level.
