WORK TOUR WAY
TO THE BOTTOM
Sometimes it's
lonely at the bottom
Searching for uranium
at the bottom of the Arctic. Drilling for oil at the
bottom of the ocean. Seeking coal and natural
gas in seams so deep and slanted, conventional
techniques can't extract the energy.
Because today, the bottom line in energy
exploration means we have to work in difficult
places, all over the world. Not only to find gas
and oil, but to discover and develop energy
alternatives such as coal. Oil shale.
Tar sands. Uranium.
So Gulf needs
people with talent skill,
• and imagination to
join in the search. Especially graduates from
the scientific/technical disciplines.
If you'd like to get to the bottom with us,
see our campus recruiter. Or write to:
William E. Johnston, Jr., Human Resources
Department, Gulf Oil Corporation-,
P.O. Box 1166, Pittsburgh, PA 15230.
Because with Gulf, working your way to
the bottom can mean working
your way to the top.
