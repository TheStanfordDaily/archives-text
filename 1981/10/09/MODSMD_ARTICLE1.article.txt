# No Jasper spraying planned

The Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve, a unique 1200-acre natural
area owned by the University and set
aside for biological research, has so
far escaped aerial spraying of
malathion-bait spraying — but only
as long as Medflies continue to stay
outside its borders.
The recent announcement by the
Medfly Project that aerial spraying
will cease in Corridor Eight, which
borders the preserve, takes some of
the pressure off of Jasper Ridge of
ficials.
"Dropping Corridor Eight means
that we can reduce by half the
amount of sampling and worrying
that we have to do about malathion
drifting into our most sensitive
areas," said Alan Grundmann, the
preserve's administrative director.
Grundmann said that the Medfly
Technical Review Committee com
plemented the intensive trapping
program at Jasper Ridge, involving
nearly 500 traps and two full-time
workers, which was instituted in lieu
of aerial spraying. This program,
along with the current suspension of
all tours through the preserve, will
not be affected by the decision to
drop Corridor Eight, he said.
Jasper Ridge was not scheduled to
be sprayed as part of the project, al
though some claim that one acciden
tal spraying occurred this summer.
The original decision not to spray
Jasper Ridge took many factors into
account, according to a Medfly
Project spokesperson. Because of the
lack of host trees, house material,
and travel on the preserve, it is an in
herently low-risk area. "We had nev
er made a find there, and we didn't
want to wipe out the research if we
didn't absolutely have to," she said.
"Many biologists made sure that
the Medfly Project was aware of
Jasper Ridge and the damage
spraying would do to the insect re
search there," said Grundmann.
Malathion is a broad-spectrum
pesticide that is harmful to all insects,
not just Medflies.
According to Irene Brown, a Stan
ford biologist who has worked on
butterfly research at Jasper Ridge
since 1968, the Medfly Project has
been "extremely open and sensitive"
to protecting the preserve, which is
the only area within Medfly control
that has not been sprayed.
Asked if agricultural interests had
put on any pressure to spray the pre
serve, Brown replied,"l know of no
adverse reaction — they know our
research contributes to basic knowl
edge of insects and helps agricul
ture."
Both the University and the Medfly
Project are taking a calculated risk in
deciding not to spray Jasper Ridge,
said Grundmann. "It will be bad pub
lic relations for us both if the pre
serve is the source of a new infesta
tion,"he said.
