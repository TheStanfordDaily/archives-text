## When everything shakes, rumbles and rolls...

Is your goldfish doing back
flips off the side of the fish
bowl? Is your cat demanding
two-ply tissue for the litter
box? If so, you may want to
send that priceless beer bottle
collection back home to mom
and store at least five gallons of
water, because the "Big One"
may be coming. That is, the big
earthquake that might make
Stanford beach front property.
Watching for unusual
behavior in animals is one of a
number of techniques
currently being studied to
predict earthquakes. The
success of these studies may be
important to Stanford students
because Richard Jahns,
professor in the Stanford
geology department, has
predicted that a large,
damaging earthquake has a
50-50 chance of occurring
somewhere in California in the
next 10 years.
Bruce Bolt, professor and
head of the seismology
laboratory at U.C. Berkeley,
agrees with Jahn's conclusions
and notes that this prediction
has been made on the basis of
"strong, but broad" evidence.
Consequently, there is the
possibility that a major
earthquake will occur while we

are at Stanford.
According to Bolt, two
methods are currently being
used worldwide to predict
earthquakes. One method is to
keep track of little earthquakes
that occur constantly in any
given area and to watch for big
increases in the normal rate of
these so-called micro
earthquakes.
This method was used in
China in 1975 to predictan
earthquake in Manchuria.
Many lives were saved as a
result of the evacuation
preceding the quake.
Unfortunately, some large
earthquakes have occurred
without those prior micro
quakes. And sometimes, as in
the Bay Area, increases in the
number of micro-quakes have
occurred without a major
quake following them.
A second method for
predicting earthquakes, and
one being used now in Japan,
relies on "tilt meters" to
measure changes in the tilt of
the ground around faults.
This technique is based on
the idea that the earth is
pressing together along faults
like two huge rubber blocks. If
these blocks slip continuously,
no large force is built up. But if
these blocks do not slip, they
will continue to press together,
storing tremendous amounts
of elastic energy and causing
deformations in the land above
them. When this energy is
released, a major earthquake
occurs.
Scientists in Japan have
noted a steady tilting of the
earth in an area south of Tokyo.
Since a major earthquake has
not occurred there in over a
hundred years, authorities are

concerned that one is likely to
happen soon.
Leon Otis, director of the
Psvchobiology and Physiology
Laboratory at SRI International,
has been conducting an
experiment to determine if
animals can sense an
impending earthquake.
Otis currently has 250
different species of animals at
various locations in the United
States. The owners of these
animals are instructed to call
his laboratory when their pet
exhibits unusual behavior.
Although the study won't be
complete for another few
years, Otis is optimistic that the
technique will be useful. He
pointed out that there were
increases in the numberof calls
coming in to his lab prior to the
earthquakes in Livermoreand
Eureka, but that there have also
been increases in calls with no
subsequent eartnquake.
Bolt, on the other hand,
doubts the effectiveness of this
techniqueand points to the
earthquake in theTangshan
area of China where there
were about 700,000 casualties.
Animals used in an earthquake
prediction study there failed to
tip off the scientists before the
earthquake occurred.
As good as all of these
Erediction techniques might
e, the public will nave little
use for them until they are
perfected. As Bolt and Otis
noted, the government can't
have people quitting jobs and
evacuating cities every time the
family dog acts odd, or a few
minor quakes roll by. The real
value of the techniques is to
allow those responsible for
emergency services to be

alerted when an earthquake
appears imminent.
But, you may ask, how would
Stanford hold up in the event
of a major earthquake? Inthe
big earthquake of 1906,
Stanford didn't hold up well at
all. According to David
Hedman of Stanford's
Earthquake Hotline, the school
was "really devastated" by that
quake. Many of the buildings
suffered considerable damage,
particularly Memorial Church,
which suffered the collapse of
its roof. Although many of the
buildings remained standing,
they were built of
unreinforced sandstone
blocks. These sandstone
buildings may not be able to
withstand another major
earthquake.
Gene Kershner, associate
director of Design and
Construction, stated that since
1955 Stanford has been
rebuilding the oldest
sandstone buildings in the
Quad as part of their long
range plan to bring all of the
buildings up to the standards of
the current federal building
