# Hoover Tower's hidden library

Imagine stepping out of a small elevator into a
room lit only by occasional uncovered light
bulbs. The ceiling is only six feet high, and the
room is packed with row upon row of books,
magazines, maps and legal documents written in
various languages.

'We had only around 70,000
requests from students for
books last year. Many
students are put off by the
fact that Reagan's advisers
use the
library/
â€” Dana Curry, Hoover
Library assistant

What you have just envisioned is the inside of
Hoover Tower, which houses most of the collec
tion of the Hoover Library, a little-used (at least
by Stanford students) collection of international
documents here on campus.
Established in 1919, the library is a vast
storehouse of information, some of it so unique
that scholars throughout the world travel here
solely to use the facility. There are newspapers

and journals from Russia which date from before
the turn of the 20th century, as well as relatively
mundane items such as recent Congressional
Records.
For the most part, though, the library concen
trates on international information, with materi
al in more than 50 languages.
This was the goal of the founder of the library,
former President Herbert Hoover. Hoover grad
uated in the first class here. In 1919, Hoover set
out to find rare documents from countries all
over the world. The collection became part of
the Hoover Institution in 1941. Upon dedication,
Hoover stipulated that the library would be
above all else, a facility for Stanford students and
faculty. Lately, relatively few students use its ac
comodations.
"We had only around 10,000 requests from
students for books last year," said one library as
sistant, Dana Curry. "Many students are put off
by the fact that Reagan's advisers use the li
brary." Green Library, by contrast, had 70,000 re
quests last winter quarter alone
Because of the rarity of some items in the li
brary, it is used more and more by economists,
scholars and authors, said Curry.
Conservative economist Milton Friedman as
well as historians Barbara Tuchman and George
Kennan and physicist Edward Teller have often
used the library along with various advisers to
the Reagan administration.
