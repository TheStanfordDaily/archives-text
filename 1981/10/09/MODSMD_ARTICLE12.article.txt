## Viewpoint/Lauren Sanders Voting Act merits attention 
### 
In the wake of the recent battles in Congress over
budget and tax cuts, a number of other issues of equal
importance have not received comparable attention.
The renewal of the Voting Rights Act earlier this week
was one of those issues.
The Voting Rights Act was first passed in 1965 in an at
tempt to remedy the pattern of discrimination against
blacks and other minorities found in many states by es
tablishing standards and procedures for voting. It has
been one of the most successful pieces of civil rights leg
islation enacted in the '60s. More than a million black
citizens were added to the voting rolls nationwide from
1965 to 1972. In 1965 there were fewer than 100 black
elected officials in the South; in 1980 there were almost
3000.
The act includes permanent provisions banning the
use of literacy tests and poll taxes applicable to all 50
states. In addition, in order to ensure civil rights in states
which have had a history of discrimination, prior federal
approval must be obtained for any proposed changes in
election laws made in their areas of jurisdiction. Protec
tion for voters with a principal language other than Eng
lish was added in 1975 in an effort to widen the partici
pation of all citizens. These key special provisions would
have expired in August 1982 unless Congress had acted
to extend them.
Some state officials and members of Congress op

posed the extension of the act. They argued that the bulk
of the enforcement falls unfairly on the South and is no
longer necessary. States' rights advocates as well con
tended that the act represents just one more example of
federal intrusion into areas which could better be han
dled by state and local governments.
These governments, however, have traditionally had a
very bad record of protecting minority rights. In testi
mony before the Judiciary Committee of the House this
summer, conditions in Alabama were described where
voters were forced to fill out their ballots on a table, in
the presence of white poll watchers. Policemen took
photographs of persons who attempted to assist illiterate
black voters. Discrimination, in ever more subtle forms,
continues to occur, and justifies the requirement that
the Justice Department review proposed changes in
election laws made by those jurisdictions with a history
of such practices.
In the last five years the Justice Department has ob
jected to 400 submitted changes — a constant number
from previous years. Without such pre-clearance pro
visions, even more blatant forms of discrimination could
be widely used to effectively disenfranchise large num
bers of minority voters. These provisions also protect
voters against racial gerrymandering.
