## Reagan should have adopted mobile basing system 
### 
Jabber about the prospect of nuclear con
frontation between the Soviet Union and the
United States is buried in and beclouded by a
labyrinth of theory called "strategic doc
trine." This euphemism for "game theory"
states that in order to maintain national se
curity, the United States must maintain a
ready nuclear force that could survive a Sovi
et "first strike" and strll inflict an "unaccep
table level" of retaliatory damage on Russian
industrial centers and military installations.
Like any game, the object should be to
outwit the enemy — in which case, nimble
theoretical maneuevering should be at least
as important as sheer display of force or
brawn. In this sense, President Ronald Rea
gan misunderstands the nature of this cruel
and tragic game.

'Reagan's two other preferred alternatives —
missiles placed in airplanes and missiles stationed
on bases defended by anti-ballistic missiles —are
vastly inferior to Carter's racetrack scheme.'

Ostensibly, the development and deploy
ment of the Missile Experimental (MX) was
designed to forestall the increasing threat of
a pre-emptive first strike due to the im
proved accuracy of Soviet heavy missiles.
The object was to prevent the opening of the
"window of vulnerability," or the increasing
ly likely possibility that Americari missile silos
would be naked to Soviet attack.
Rejecting the multiple protective shelter
(MPS) mobile basing mode for the MX

adopted by former President Jimmy Carter
did nothing to close this "window of vulner
ability." The MX is nothing more than an ad
vanced version of the ICBM Minuteman. It is
twice as heavy, carries many more warheads,
and is twice as accurate. Therefore the
critical decision is how to deploy the MX, not
whether it should be deployed at all.
Reagan is greviously mistaken in planting
the new MXs in antiquated Titan silos. The
Air Force, well before Reagan made his un
expected announcement, had concluded af
ter a series of studies that the Titan silos were
incapable of being reconditioned with gran
ite and concrete such that they could resist a
Soviet blast. Thus, our land-based ICBMs
would still remain vulnerable, prey to a Sovi
et offensive.

Reagan claims this is but a temporary solu
tion to the basing problem. Yet his two other
preferred alternatives — missiles placed in
airplanes such as the new B-1 or creaky
B-525, and missiles stationed on bases de
fended by anti-ballistic missiles — are vastly
inferior to Carter and Harold Brown's
"racetrack shelter" scheme.
Costs of airborne basing are almost twice
as great as that for land basing (due to the ris
ing price of fuel). Furthermore, carrying MXs

aboard aircraft reduces our land-based com
ponent of the strategic Triad to feeble de
pendence upon the propensity to be able to
react to warning quickly.
Alternatively, a basing concept in which
missiles are protected by surrounding ABMs
can be implemented only by annulling the
indispensible 1972 U.S./USSR treaty which
limits each side to two defensive missile sys
tems, one circling the national capital, the
other any missile site. Abrogation of the 1972
accord would be a deadly setback for the
cause of arms control.
Furthermore, before construction of ef
fective ABMs can begin, unpredictable tech
nological breakthroughs must occur; un
fortunately, research efforts on defensive
missiles have been all but abandoned since
1972, and it will require almost a decade for
the United States to catch up.
Finally, the construction of ABMs might be
construed by the Soviet Union as an esca
latory action, because ABMs are capable of
"limiting damage" to industrial, military and
population centers in the United States. The
Soviets might believe that Weinberger or
Haig would be encouraged to launch a pre
emptive first strike against their homeland
because our ABMs would be able to dull the
catastrophe of a Soviet retaliatory strike.
Under the mobile basing system, the
Carter administration would have trans
ported 200 missiles and launchers among
4600 hardened horizontal shelters in a
manner so random that the Soviet Union
could never have guessed their actual loca
tions at any one moment. After extensive re
search into environmental impact, the gov
ernment concluded that economic, en

vironmental and population disruption
would be minimized if the MX was based in
the deserts of Nevada and Utah. Upon warn
ing of an imminent Soviet attack, the missiles
could be moved in less than 30 minutes —
the time period required fora Soviet SS-18 to
rocket to Wyoming — so survivability of our
own ICBM force would have been max
imized fora retaliatory attack.

. the Reagan decision... does not solve the
problem that the MX was created to solve in the first
place: the vulnerability of the land-based U.S.
missile to a Soviet surprise attack/

The major popular objection to the
mobile basing mode emanated from an
isolated group of Westerners - Senator Paul
Laxalt and Governor Robert List of Nevada,
and a scattered gathering of selfish Great
Basin groupies. Two-and-a-half acre plots
would have been all that was required for
each of the MX shelters, with a total area of
25 square milesl Nevada alone encompasses
110,540 square miles, and it is hard to im
agine that use of 25 square miles on public
land already owned by the government
could really be "the crushing weight... on
the shoulders of all Nevadans" claimed by its
governor.
As Los Angeles Times reporter Robert
Toth comented, "... the Reagan decision
... does not solve the problem that the MX
was created to solve in the first place: the
vulnerability of the land-based U.S. missile

force to a Soviet surprise attack." The mul
tiple shelter, mobile MX mode is probably
the only basing scheme that makes any
strategic sense at all. Both the Air Force chief
of staff General Lew Allen and the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General David
Jones, had pressed Reagan to accept the
MPS mode, but to no avail. Several Air Force
generals are considering resignation in pro-

test of Reagan's decision.
All of this of course understates the basic
failure of Reagan's military policy — the
postponement of the resumption of arms
control talks with the Soviet Union until he
and Weinberger and the military estab
lishment are satisfied that the United States
has caught up and surpassed the Soviet
Union in strategic superiority — a task
potentially devestating fora sputtering
economy. Credit markets will be unable to
provide financing for both the "take-off" of
industrial productivity and the burgeoning
federal deficits. All of which makes the re
sumption of some sort of SALT process and a
sane arms policy not merely a policy prefer
ence, but a mandate.

agine that use of 25 square miles on public
land already owned by the government
could really be "the crushing weight... on
the shoulders of all Nevadans" claimed by its
governor.
As Los Angeles Times reporter Robert
Toth comented, "... the Reagan decision
... does not solve the problem that the MX
was created to solve in the first place: the
vulnerability of the land-based U.S. missile

force to a Soviet surprise attack." The mul
tiple shelter, mobile MX mode is probably
the only basing scheme that makes any
strategic sense at all. Both the Air Force chief
of staff General Lew Allen and the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General David
Jones, had pressed Reagan to accept the
MPS mode, but to no avail. Several Air Force
generals are considering resignation in pro-

test of Reagan's decision.
All of this of course understates the basic
failure of Reagan's military policy — the
postponement of the resumption of arms
control talks with the Soviet Union until he
and Weinberger and the military estab
lishment are satisfied that the United States
has caught up and surpassed the Soviet
Union in strategic superiority — a task
potentially devestating fora sputtering
economy. Credit markets will be unable to
provide financing for both the "take-off" of
industrial productivity and the burgeoning
federal deficits. All of which makes the re
sumption of some sort of SALT process and a
sane arms policy not merely a policy prefer
ence, but a mandate.
(Mark Swanson is a senior majoring in his
tory and economics.)

Jabber about the prospect of nuclear con
frontation between the Soviet Union and the
United States is buried in and beclouded by a
labyrinth of theory called "strategic doc
trine." This euphemism for "game theory"
states that in order to maintain national se
curity, the United States must maintain a
ready nuclear force that could survive a Sovi
et "first strike" and strll inflict an "unaccep
table level" of retaliatory damage on Russian
industrial centers and military installations.
Like any game, the object should be to
outwit the enemy — in which case, nimble
theoretical maneuevering should be at least
as important as sheer display of force or
brawn. In this sense, President Ronald Rea
gan misunderstands the nature of this cruel
and tragic game.

'Reagan's two other preferred alternatives —
missiles placed in airplanes and missiles stationed
on bases defended by anti-ballistic missiles —are
vastly inferior to Carter's racetrack scheme.'

Ostensibly, the development and deploy
ment of the Missile Experimental (MX) was
designed to forestall the increasing threat of
a pre-emptive first strike due to the im
proved accuracy of Soviet heavy missiles.
The object was to prevent the opening of the
"window of vulnerability," or the increasing
ly likely possibility that Americari missile silos
would be naked to Soviet attack.
Rejecting the multiple protective shelter
(MPS) mobile basing mode for the MX

adopted by former President Jimmy Carter
did nothing to close this "window of vulner
ability." The MX is nothing more than an ad
vanced version of the ICBM Minuteman. It is
twice as heavy, carries many more warheads,
and is twice as accurate. Therefore the
critical decision is how to deploy the MX, not
whether it should be deployed at all.
Reagan is greviously mistaken in planting
the new MXs in antiquated Titan silos. The
Air Force, well before Reagan made his un
expected announcement, had concluded af
ter a series of studies that the Titan silos were
incapable of being reconditioned with gran
ite and concrete such that they could resist a
Soviet blast. Thus, our land-based ICBMs
would still remain vulnerable, prey to a Sovi
et offensive.

Reagan claims this is but a temporary solu
tion to the basing problem. Yet his two other
preferred alternatives — missiles placed in
airplanes such as the new B-1 or creaky
B-525, and missiles stationed on bases de
fended by anti-ballistic missiles — are vastly
inferior to Carter and Harold Brown's
"racetrack shelter" scheme.
Costs of airborne basing are almost twice
as great as that for land basing (due to the ris
ing price of fuel). Furthermore, carrying MXs

aboard aircraft reduces our land-based com
ponent of the strategic Triad to feeble de
pendence upon the propensity to be able to
react to warning quickly.
Alternatively, a basing concept in which
missiles are protected by surrounding ABMs
can be implemented only by annulling the
indispensible 1972 U.S./USSR treaty which
limits each side to two defensive missile sys
tems, one circling the national capital, the
other any missile site. Abrogation of the 1972
accord would be a deadly setback for the
cause of arms control.
Furthermore, before construction of ef
fective ABMs can begin, unpredictable tech
nological breakthroughs must occur; un
fortunately, research efforts on defensive
missiles have been all but abandoned since
1972, and it will require almost a decade for
the United States to catch up.
Finally, the construction of ABMs might be
construed by the Soviet Union as an esca
latory action, because ABMs are capable of
"limiting damage" to industrial, military and
population centers in the United States. The
Soviets might believe that Weinberger or
Haig would be encouraged to launch a pre
emptive first strike against their homeland
because our ABMs would be able to dull the
catastrophe of a Soviet retaliatory strike.
Under the mobile basing system, the
Carter administration would have trans
ported 200 missiles and launchers among
4600 hardened horizontal shelters in a
manner so random that the Soviet Union
could never have guessed their actual loca
tions at any one moment. After extensive re
search into environmental impact, the gov
ernment concluded that economic, en

vironmental and population disruption
would be minimized if the MX was based in
the deserts of Nevada and Utah. Upon warn
ing of an imminent Soviet attack, the missiles
could be moved in less than 30 minutes —
the time period required fora Soviet SS-18 to
rocket to Wyoming — so survivability of our
own ICBM force would have been max
imized fora retaliatory attack.

Laxalt and Governor Robert List of Nevada,
