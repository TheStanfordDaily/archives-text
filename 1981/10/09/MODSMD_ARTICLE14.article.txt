## Arms sales based on false assumption 
### 
When President Ronald Reagan
announced Oct. 1 that "Saudi Arabia
we will not permit to be an Iran," he
was asserting that the United States
would defend the Saudi monarchy
from internal upheaval as well as out
side aggression. This was no break
With past U.S. policy.
' After the shah of Iran was over
thrown, President Jimmy Carter
made the Persian Gulf our first line of
defense by building up U.S. naval
forces in the Indian Ocean and
pledging to protect Arab oil fields
"by any means necessary." But even
earlier, in 1977, the Senate Commit
tee on Energy and Natural Resources
declared that "defense of oil re
sources and political stability was
"the most vital and enduring interest
of the United States in the Middle
East."
Since then policy makers in both
major parties have given virtually
unanimous support to using U.S.
forces, if necessary, to preserve the
status quo in the Gulf states and
thereby to protect the flow of oil.
Critics have protested against the no
tion of sending American soldiers to
fight in behalf of the oil industry, but
no one has asked whether such a pol
icy is even necessary; whether, in
fact, oil supplies would be
jeopardized by a change in the status
quo.
The assumption behind U.S.
strategy is that radical takeovers
abroad threaten the free flow of raw
materials to the developed nations.
Since World War II this assumption
has prompted military interventions
by Western nations all over the
globe, from the Congo to Indochina.
Yet there is no evidence that nations
left to their own devices — no matter
how radical their governments — will
refuse to trade with the West. The
Arab oil embargo of 1973 was a meas
ure taken during wartime, and had
nothing to do with the nature of the
governments involved. Indeed, the
leader of the embargo was Saudi Ara

bia, whose government we are now
pledged to protect.
The most hard-core Communist
nations of Eastern Europe have wel
comed trade with the West. The Sovi
et Union has all but pleaded for
most-favored-nation trading status
with the United States and is current
ly negotiating to sell natural gas, in
addition to oil, to Western Europe. As
of 1979 the revolutionary govern
ments of Iraq, Lybia and Algeria were
together supplying 23 percent of U.S.
oil imports. A year after the Sand
inistas took power in Nicaragua they
contracted to sell the nation's banana
crop to Castle & Cooke, Inc. and an
nounced "a serious effort to create
the proper environment for private
investment."
Even the victims of U.S. military in
tervention, Vietnam and Angola,
have expressed eagerness for Ameri
can trade and investment. The Marx
ist government of Angola not only
protects Gulf Oil's installations in
Cabinda but recently awarded new
drilling rights to other American oil
companies rather than to the Soviets.
In cases where Third World countries
have been cut off from trading with
the United States — Cuba and, until
recently, China — the freeze was not
of their doing but the result of unilat
eral U.S. policy.
Why, then, are we sending billions
of dollars worth of arms to potentially
unstable regimes ($9 billion worth to
Saudi Arabia alone) and pledging the
use of U.S. military forces in their de
fense, risking involvements that
could have unforeseen and bloody
consequences? Perhaps for the same
reason we are about to spend $180
billion on bigger and better nuclear
weapons: because we are prisoners
of our belief that the world is
polarized between friends and ene
mies, and that — despite all the evi
dence to the contrary — we cannot
safely do business with countries that

do not share our ideology. Despite
recent events in Iran and elsewhere
we are still committed to the illusion
that with enough military power we
can control the future course, of his-

Tory and survive unscathed. That is
why a faraway desert monarchy has
become our first line of defense.
