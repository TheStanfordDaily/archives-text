Indexing cuts tax load

I must take issue with Christopher
Hedrick's column "Planned income
tax indexing would add to federal
deficit" (Daily, Oct. 7). My disagree
ments here are focused on two main
points.
First, while indexing does make
sense in times of low inflation, it
makes even more sense during peri
ods of high inflation. As long as in
come tax rates are not indexed, an in
centive exists for the federal govern
ment to inflate or at least resist curb
ing inflation.
High inflation "bracket creep" has
drastically increased the tax burden
of the middle and lower classes. In
come increases, barely keeping pace
with inflation, are subject to higher
taxes, as Hedrick stated. However,
not only do higher incomes increase
taxes, they lower receipts of transfer
payments (i:e. welfare, food stamps
etc.) from the government. This, too,
is a cost. Combining these two ef
fects, the American Enterprise In
stitute estimates that the majority of
American households have faced
marginal tax rates of 50 percent or
more in recent years. This represents
a massive incentive not to work
harder to increase one's well-being,
a blockade against economic growth.
Supply-side tax cuts are designed to
relieve the tax burden, increase eco
nomic growth apd therefore income,
and in return supply greater revenue
than under'the higher effective rates.
Meet the Laffer curve.

Whether or not one agrees with
supply-side theory, there is a second
aspect of Mr. Hedrick's column
which bothers me. Non-indexed tax
rates do, again as he has noted in his
statement of the arguments, allow
the government to painlessly and
surreptitiously increase its revenue.
This is morally wrong. If, as Mr.
Hedrick suggests, we face massive
deficits by 1985, I can see no reason
why they should be financed in this
manner. If Congress wants to raise
taxes, let them do so openly before
the scrutiny of the American public.

Film numbed audience
Steve Vineberg, in Us review of
Gallipoli, by Peter Weir (Daily, Oct.
6), failed to perceive Weir's actual ob
jective. It was to show the pointless
futility of trench warfare in WWI. As
the movie progressed one was led to
believe that the two main characters
would make use of their running tal
ents to perform some heroic deed.
Unfortunately, this was not to be.
The ending of the last scene ex
emplified the idea of trench warfare
as being little more than mass sui
cide. The audience left the theater in
a numbed silence that had little to do
with "admiration for Weir's
meticulous technique."
