## Commentary/Cole and Bergstrom Reagan's cabinet struggles with summer assignments 
### 
When school was let out last sum
mer, the Headmaster of the Old Boy
Preparatory Academy of Washing
ton, D.C., Ron "The Gipper" Reagan,
gave each of his three best students a
summer assignment.
Young Davey Stockman, the class
hotshot, was given a home econom
ics problem, Jimmy Watt was given
an accounting assignment, and am
bitious Alex Haig was given a psy
chology problem. After completing
their assignments each of these three
fine young men was asked to submit
a few paragraphs explaining how
their summer assignments turned
out. This is what they said:
Young Davey Stockman wrote:
"I really didn't get to have too
much fun this summer. My head
master gave me a home economics
assignment: I had to figure out how
to buy both guns and butter with my
allowance. It was hard.
"Another student, Cap "The
Knife" Weinberger, kept telling me
to buy guns and substitute Mazola
for the butter. Cap explained that if
the sleeping bear woke up and we
didn't have any guns we would all be
eaten, but I didn't believe him on ac
count of how his father owned the
gun store.
"On my way to the supermarket, I
saw a terrible accident. There was a
fire in a third floor tenement, and a
poor family was stuck on the ledge
outside. The firemen told them to
jump into the safety net below. How
ever, only when the family had

jumped did they discover that there
were holes in the safety net. It was
not a pretty sight.
"When I finally got to the super
market, I discovered that my allow
ance was riot enough to buy any but
ter at all — I only had enough money
to buy a slingshot."
Jimmy Watt wrote:
"I had a busy vacation. My assign
ment was to take inventory in my
headmaster's store. It was a nursery;
not the kind where they grow chil
dren but the kind where they grow
trees and stuff.
"My headmaster wanted to know
exactly what was in stock because he
was planning a big sale. You know,
"Everything Must Go," "Going Out
Of Business," "End Of 1 he World"
Sale. I had to count every tree and
shrub twice to make sure I didn't
make any mistakes.
"We had the biggest sale ever We
sold everything. Now we don't have
anything left to sell and I don't have a
summer job — but it's okay 'cuz next
summer I can work in a strip mine.
"I was so industrious that some of
the kids who didn't get in to Old Boy
Prep Academy started calling me
names. They told my headmaster that
I was crazy. But Mr. Reagan told
those name-callers that I was just as
sane as fie was. 1 hey believed that."
Alex Haig wrote:
"My assignment for summer vaca
tion was very hard. It was a psy
chology assignment: I hadtoact"civ
il" for three months. I'm not a very

good actor.
"It's very hard to act civil when
there are so many foreigners in the
world. Some of those foreigners
don't believe in God or The Ameri
can Way. They're crazy. Ivan in par
ticular, he's the block bully. He and
his friends are always trying to gang
up on me and my friends — and now
his gang is moving right into our back
yards! But that's okay, 'cuz our head
master is giving everyone in our club
a slingshot so we can attack them
first. Some of the kids want to make a
truce with Ivan all our sl
ingshots away, but even our head
master, Mr. Reagan, says that's not a
good idea 'cuz you can't trust those
lousy foreigners. Why, most of them
don't even speak English correct!
"Assignment-wise, I would have
passed if it weren't for one little
thing. One time when Headmaster
Reagan was out of town I elected my
self president of the school. I was just
joking, but the other kids got angry at
me, especially that little goody
goody Georgie Bush, who told the
headmaster and almost got me sus
pended."
All three students were praised by
the headmaster for their summer
work. However, it is these writers'
hope that all three will go on to
higher education when they have fin
ished elementary school.

an accounting assignment, and am
bitious Alex Haig was given a psy
chology problem. After completing
