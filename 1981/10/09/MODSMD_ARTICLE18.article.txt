# Commentary/Andrew Clarke
## Stanford's beautiful people live life of casual elegance 
### 
Perhaps you've seen them breezing across White Plaza
on their Puchs, or gawked at them, lean and golden on
the Roble Courts. If you're a computer science grad stu
dent, maybe you've only heard rumors of their fabulous
parties. But whoever you are, you can't have been at
Stanford long without sensing the presence of 1 he Beau
tiful People.
They're the Jet Set, the Moving Crowd, the Bravo
Foneys — known to those on the outside by a hundred
different names. And they're everywhere, too, not only
at Stanford but in every locale that provides a nutrient
medium for their lifestyle of casual elegance.
At Stanford, though, conditions are ideal for the prop
agation of the species. As a result, the beautiful people
have become too concentrated to maintain the low pro
file that is their hallmark.
You've never had a better opportunity to make con
tact with the beautiful people than you have right now
on the Farm. And if you're aspiring to become a beautiful
person, your chances of success are currently at their
peak. You need only develop the right habits, make a
few key purchases and voila — you're beautiful.
First, you'll want to get into shape by going on a suit
able diet. You should balance your daily intake by select
ing items from each of the major food groups: the fast
foods, the sugars, the caffeines and the alcohols. Italian
ice cream is a staple, as is anything else that can start a
conversation about your travels abroad. Food Service
should be avoided, although a quick trip to the dining
hall to nibble a few garbanzos and half-finish a Tab is a
friendly gesture once in a while.
More important than what you eat is what you drive.
Between classes a moped is hard to beat, unless per haps
a Vespa more suits your individual panache. Of course

parked at home on the Row should be your real driving
machine — a 320i. Failing this, you may get away with a
2002 of proper vintage.
Your wardrobe, too, is of paramount importance. Plan
on devoting at least half of your closet space to Polo. But
leave room for your down vest! And don't toss out your
entire stock from the days of Prep — much of the "chinos
over top-siders with button-down under tweed" is still
usable, especially when accented by Ralph Lauren.
But where should you be seen in your new ensemble?
1 he Coffee House is a good place to start, as long as you
carefully avoid the side where the grad students play
chess. Be sure to take along some reading as well — pref
erably art history, international econ or something else
that's fuzzy yet exotic.
The tennis courts or deGuerre (on thegrass — never in
the pool) are also good places to make your first beau
tiful friend. If you have a dark enough tan, you might
even get invited to a Beautiful party. This is your big
break.
Start preparing yourself for the evening several days in
advance. Blow your nose often to clear out all nasal con
gestion. Stare at bright lights to learn to control your
sneeze reflex. Look up all the acquaintances you have in
Hillsborough and in Piedmont; you ought to discover
several mutual friends.
Finally, at the party, remember to think beautiful and
act beautiful, and you'll be beautiful. And if you feel
yourself sliding back into ugliness, simply recite over and
over this incantation — Skilynx, Acier, Vuarnet, Skilynx,
Acier, Vuarnet...
