## Jagger lives the American dream 
### 
Washington — What's a 38-year
old doing strutting across a stage in
skintight pants and blue mascara, as
backup guitarists blare away nearby?
Mick Jagger'sjust living the Ameri
can dream.
That's why Mr. Rolling Stone is
sure to generate more interest and
excitement among Americans under
40 than did the entire 1980 presiden
tial campaign as his band launches its
1981 United States tour.
Mick iagger is what millions of
Americans, from tennis star John
McEnroe to television personality
Jane Pauley, have secretly wanted to
be: a rock star. After almost 20 years
in the spotlight, he has managed to
maintain his youth, sex appeal and fi
nancial success, the life that most of
us dream about.
Of course, Jagger and the Rolling
Stones are special in today's world of
music. They've remained steadily
popular since the early '60s, have
stayed together and keep churning
out hit songs.
While super-hot but shorter-lived
groups can sell out a national tour
once, the Stones can guarantee full
houses whenever they want. After
mere rumors of a false Stones warm
up concert hit Boston last month 4000
fans turned out for the non-existent
ticket sale. When the angry mob
marched to City Hall, even Mayor
Kevin White felt slighted and made
an all-out effort to book the Stones at

the last minute.
The Stones' drawing power still lies
in the authenticity and blantant sex
uality of their lead singer. For many,
Jagger is the real thing.
Anyone who's ever been to a
Stones' concert can attest to this. On
stage, ringleader Jagger is part strip
per and part magician.
His macho hip thrusts are as un
mistakably American as his self-evi
dent profile. Jagger twists the notion
of male sex appeal, and regularly ap
plies lipstick to his face, intriguing
men as often as luring women. When
he makes love to a microphone
stand, everybody screams for him.
This may not sound like every
father's idea of the American dream.
But the quintessential showman is
also the consummate businessman.
While Jagger may appear as flaky as
Peter Pan onstage, he continually
notes whether spotlights are in place
or if props are functioning. If there
are bugs in the system, he's the first
one to scream at stagehands during
intermission.
After almost two decades in the in
ternational spotlight, there's every
reason to believe Jagger could go on
like this forever. We mav grow older,
but he won't. What more could a
man want?
Not surprisingly, a lot of American
cities are upset that Jagger and his
colleagues aren't coming their way

during the upcoming fall tour. Phila
delphia, Buffalo and Boulder, Colo
rado, are a few of the fortunate towns
to have them. And there's Rockford,
Illinois. The Stones agreed to play
there after receiving a petition
signed by 35,000 residents.
"They're coming to reward the
music lovers," Dallas Cole, a Rock
ford radio director told the Chicago
Tribune, "not to sell tickets. They're
just very impressed that a city of this
size would and could generate this
much excitement."
Of course, what symbolizes the
American dream for one generation
often sends a bolt of fear through an
older set. Indeed, many Americans
may never understand rock and roll.
But as Jagger and the Stones begin
their tour of the states, they deserve
three cheers from music lovers of all
ages. Having lasted almost 20 years in
an industry which leaves few sur
vivors, they are immortals, like 'em or
not. Jagger and Co. have proven that
self-destruction isn't necessarily a
prerequisite to lasting fame.
The relatively mature man strutting
so suggestively onstage is hard to
argue with. After all, doing what you
like most and making money at it is
what the American dream is all
about.
