## ABMs give MX new life 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Led by the
Army's Ballistic Missile De
fense Agency (BMDA), the
Reagan administration is be
ginning to look at how the 1972
anti-ballistic missile treaty with
the Soviet Union might be
modified to permit protection
of strategic command and con
trol centers and, possibly, new
land-based MX intercontinen
tal ballistic missiles.
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said he has not
made up his mind which of the
several MX basing plans —
placing the missiles aboard air
planes, shuttling them among
shelters or putting them in ex
isting silos — to recommend to
the president and Congress.
The latter course, proposed
as one solution by the Wein
berger-appointed Townes
Commission, calls for putting
100 missiles in silos that now
hold Titan and Minuteman
missiles, and defending those
silos with a new mobile anti
ballistic missile system that is in
advanced research.
A shell game
Using a concept called
"preferential defense," the
mobile ABMs would defend
some but not all of the silo
based MX missiles. But because
the Soviets would not know
which silos were being de
fended, they wouid have to fire
many warheads at each one.
This would give a new life to
the MX missile, which had
been under attack because it
was viewed as too indefensible
to be employed.
If this approach, which has
been discussed with Wein
berger, is accepted by him and
the president it would require
a modification of the 1972 trea
ty, since even testing of mobile
ABM components is barred by
the pact.
The Reagan Pentagon was
warned by departing Carter
administration officials that any
attempt to abrogate the ABM
treaty would be met with stiff
resistance, not only by ele
ments within Congress and in
the public at large, but also by
U.S. allies in Europe who have
been pressing for more rather
than less arms control talk.
For that reason, according to
one Reagan defense official,
any attempt to modify the ABM

treaty will be couched in arms
control terms. A return of
ABMs, he said, "would be
done for stability purposes, to
permit both sides to defend a
smaller force of ICBMs and
thus not need to put more
dollars and rubles into addi
tional missiles."
Serious study
One measure of how seri
ously Weinberger considers
ABMs is his decision to devote
one of three Defense Science
Board (DSB) meetingsthissum
mer to a study of "what kind of
ABM we could have by the mid
or late 1980s," according to a
Pentagon official involved in
the process.
The DSB, which will meet the
first two weeks in August, will
look at the technologies de
veloped by the Army's BMDA,
as well as a new approach
being pushed in the Pentagon
to use a Navy Aegis early warn
ing radar system with the Sprint
ABM missile that was originally
developed for the now-dis
carded Safeguard ABM system.
Under terms of the ABM
treaty, the United States and
the Soviet Union are scheduled
to sit down sometime late next
year fora regularly scheduled
five-year review of how the
agreement is operating.
The last review, in 1977, un
der the newly elected Carter
administration, was recently
described as "perfunctory" by
several civilian and military
men who participated in it.
But Reagan defense
strategists and their conserva
tive allies in Congress have
been pressing fora serious re
view of the treaty that would
pave the way for an expansion
of the one ABM site with 100
missiles allowed under its
terms.
Contracts are out
A top Pentagon official said
last week that he expects to or
der studies on possible treaty
modifications shortly, but is de
laying that action until the pres
ident announces his decisions
on deployment of the MX mis
sile.
A key Reagan defense of
ficial, however, said both the
Pentagon and the Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency
have studies under way on vari
ous aspects of the ABM treaty

and how they could be mod
ified.
In March, the BMDA
awarded a $224,000 contract to
Science Applications Inc., a
Virginia-based think-tank that
has offices in Huntsville, Ala
bama, home of the Army ABM
command. The contract calls
fora "qualitative and quan
titative analysis" that would
prepare the Army agency for
recommending positions to be
taken on the ABM treaty, ac
cording to a spokesman for
BMDA.
According to one defense
consultant who was among
those bidding on the BMDA
contract, "The Army agency
expects to be called on to play a
staff role in the 1982 treaty re
view and wants to have facts
available to present on what
portions of the treaty the U.S.
should protect, and which
ones would be advantageous
for us to change."
Question of vulnerability
As an example, he said it was
clear that the BMDA thought
there was "no advantage to the
U.S. to cease the treaty in 1982,
since the agency thought the
Soviets were closer to a work
able system than we were."
On the other hand, he said,
"to be able to test and evaluate
mobile ABM components
would be in our interest."
The BMDA has been receiv
ing an average of $200 million a
year for ABM research during
the nine-year life of the treaty.
Initially, after the treaty first
went into effect, there was little
public support for resurrecting
ABMs.
But over the past few years,
as concern grew over the pos
sible vulnerability of the U.S.
land-based missiles to a first
strike from the Soviet Union,
there was a rebirth of interest
in ABMs. For its part, the
BMDA has recently sponsored
a series of seminars aimed at
developing a new intellectual
base for ABMs. Six such semi
nars have been conducted in
Washington since 1978, attract
ing officials from the Pentagon
and State Department, consul
tants from a variety of defense
think-tanks and aides to key

senators and members of Con
gress who deal with the de
fense budget.
Pressure for review
"The seminars have had a
definite pro-ABM slant," ac
cording to a Capitol Hill aide
who has attended more than
one of them. As one defense
consultant put it, " 'Til now
there has been a slow and
steady drumbeat for ABM, how
great the technology has be
come and that the treaty has to
be reviewed in 1982."
One of the BMDA seminars,
held at the Madison Hotel in
Washington on Sept. 18-19,
1979, was titled "The Future of
U.S. Land-Based Strategic
Forces." The 60 or so partici
pants were treated to a series of
conservative defense speakers
on the U.S. and Soviet forces,
concluding with a presentation
on "BMD's role in national sur
vival, a first assessment."
The speaker was Ellory Block
of Science Applications Inc.,

play a key role in BMDA's new
contract with SAI on what to
recommend on the ABM trea

to defend the MX. As a result, the administration is said to be
pushing fora review of the treaty banning ABM reasearch.

MX CONTROVERSIAL — The MX missile, which had been losing
ground as a viable component of the U.S. defense plan, now
seems likely to be pushed harder than ever. The Reagan adminis-
