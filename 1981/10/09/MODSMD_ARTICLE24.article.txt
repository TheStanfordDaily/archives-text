# Quake signs in So. Cal.

### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Radon, a naturally occur
ring gas whose fluctuating concentrations in
well water and the ground may be a tip-off to
impending earthquakes, has again begun to
bubble copiously in two Southern California
wells being monitored by scientists at the Cal
ifornia Institute of Technology.
By itself, this development would trigger
the interest of seismologists and
geophysicists. But in addition:
— A University of California at Santa
Barbara geologist has been measuring a vig
orous flow of the same gas in the soil around
Santa Barbara.
— The water table has risen so high in some
parts of San Bernardino County that at least
one long-dry well has suddenly become
artesian and the water levels in other, still-ac
tive wells have varied by as much as 30 feet
within the span of a few days.
— Springs that had been inactive in the
Palmdale and the Frazier Park-Lebec areas,
north to northwest of Los Angeles, have be
come active once again.
— A steam vent has popped up in the sea
cliffs near Gaviota, west of Santa Barbara.
Because these phenomena, taken either
singly or in various combinations, could be
construed as precursors to an earthquake in
Southern California, two U.S. Geological Sur
vey scientists — Thomas Heaton and Carl
Johnson — notified their agency's head
quarters in Reston, Virginia, of these de
velopments in a Sept. 30 memorandum.
Indeed, in that memo Heaton noted that
"despite our present confusion about the sig
nificance of (these) recently reported
geophysical anomalies, it seems clear that if a
large earthquake were to occur in the near
future, then many would claim that there
were abundant examples of precursory
phenomena."
Both scientists, who are assigned by the
USGS to Caltech's Seismological Laboratory,
insisted that they are not making a prediction
for Southern California. "If all these things
are connected," Heaton said of the radon,
the wells, the springs and others, "we don't
know at present how they're connected. And
if we don't know how, we can't say when, or
where, or what."
That uncertainty was reflected by other sci
entists. "These anomalies do give us some
concern," John Filson, director of the USGS
office of earthquake studies in Reston, said in
a telephone interview Wednesday. "We are
planning to have a meeting in Southern Cali
fornia in early November to discuss them. But
we don't see anything right now to warrant a
change in our assessment of Southern Cali
fornia's seismic status," he said.

At present, that assessment is a Category 2:
Earthquake Hazard Watch. The USGS issued
this "watch" advisory last year and it basically
cautions residents to be prepared to cope
with a moderate-to-strong earthquake in the
unspecified near future. A Category 3: Earth
quake Hazard Warning would alert residents
of an area to expect a destructive tremor
within a certain number of hours or days and
would constitute a specific earthquake pre
diction.
Other scientists, including several Caltech
professors, agreed with Filson, Heaton and
Johnson.
The radon finding is particularly intriguing.
The Caltech team that has been experiment
ing with the radon levels in about a dozen test
wells scattered around Southern California
now believes that levels of the gas increased
greatly prior to several recent earthquakes in
the area, including the Oct. 15,1979, Imperial
Valley earthquake; the Jan. 1, 1979, Malibu
quake and the June 29,1979, Big Bear shake.
Prof. Mark Shapiro, the Caltech visiting as
sociate in physics who has directed the in
vestigation, said that radon concentrations in
test wells at Lake Hughes, near Lancaster, and
at Lytle Greek, near Clendora, both rose dra
matically beginning in early August.
The level peaked sharply at both wells at
about the same time, Shapiroexplained, then
would subside together and peak again about
five days later. And with every such peak, the
total amount of radon bubbling in the well
water would increase.
Other wells have not shown either such
peaking or an overall increase in radon,
Shapiro said. "It's puzzling," he said, "and it's
a matter of some concern, which we've ex
pressed" to the USGS.
About a mile to the west and north, Prof.
Arthur Sylvester of UC-Santa Barbara has
been measuring the radon content in gases
that are continuously percolating out of the
earth. Last February, Sylvester noted a big in
crease in the counts of radon around Santa
Barbara.
Sylvester noted that Russian and Chinese
experiences with radon suggest that the in
creased levels of the gas are not found in the
epicentral area of a subsequent temblor, but
tend to crop up all around the perimeter of a
stressed region. The earthquake occurs in
side this stressed region.
Here in Southern California, Sylvester said,
the radon anomaly associated with the Im
perial Valley earthquake of autumn 1979 was
seen all around the Los Angeles area, more
than 200 miles from the quake's focus. "The
same thing could be working here," the UC-
Santa Barbara scientist said.
