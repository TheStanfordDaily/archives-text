# Cable watchers complain about reruns

### Los Angeles Times 
New Orleans — judging
from the slick monthly movie
guides issued by Home Box Of

Movie Channel and other lead
ing pay-TV services na

'/f's the same problem today as it was
five years ago. We have too many
reruns.'
—Winston Cox, Sr. vice president of
Home Box Office Sales and Marketing

tionwide, you'd think that
Goldie Hawn is the biggest
movie star ever to grace a tele
vision screen.
Throughout October,
Hawn's 1980 Warner Bros, film,
Private Benjamin, is the feature
attraction on virtually every
major pay-TV service from
HBO to ON TV. The film is
playing no fewer than 20 times
on the three largest pay ser
vices alone.
As pay-TV services pro
liferate, duplication of pro
grams on their schedules is be
coming increasingly irritating
to the growing number of
viewers who subscribe to more
than one service. According to
a recent study by HBO, these
subscribers are becoming dis
enchanted because they be
lieve that different services do
not offer different programs.
In the early days of pay TV,
duplicati9n existed, but few
people "had access to more
than one pay network. Now,
more and more cable systems
offer subscribers three or more
so-called "tiers" of pay chan
nels.
As people pay $40 or more a
month for several pay TV ser
vices, they are likely to demand
that the channels carry dif
ferent programs, suggest pay
TV executives.

Speaking at a panel session
during the three-day Cable
Software Symposium and Ex
position here this week,
Winston Cox, HBO's senior
vice president for sales and
marketing, unveiled a study
showing that viewers believe

the major pay services dupli
cate as much as 76 percent of
their schedules. The actual du
plication figures are much low
er — a little more than one
third of the movies shown in
anv given month — Cox noted.
But people's perceptions, he
suggested, could be far more
damaging to the pay-TV busi
ness than the reality.
"The problem today is as it
was five years ago," Cox told
his audience. "We have too
many repeats."
Hawn's multiple ap
pearances are not the result of
some sleeping programmers
not knowing what the com
petition is up to, but a result of
the relationship between the
studios and the pay-TV
networks. The majorstudios re
lease films to pay TV only for
play at designated times of the
year. Furthermore, according
to studio executives, HBO,
which dominates the pay-TV
business, refuses to run a major
studio's film if it has shown pre
viously on another pay
network. HBO is said to insist
on having a film first or at least
simultaneously with all other
pay networks.
In the short term, the dupli
cation situation is going to
grow worse. Next month, most

pay services will feature either
Ordinary People or The Blue
Lagoon. December's feature
will be Kramer vs. Kramer.
In the long run, the situation
may improve. Showtime, for
example, is including more ex
clusive plays and original pro
grams like Jason Robards' ap
pearance last month in Eugene
O'Neill's Hughie.
HBO is going another route
by providing a number of film
producers up-front produc
tion funds and acquiring ex
clusive pay-TV rights in return.
These so-called "pre buys" are
expected to start appearing
next year.
HBO also has formed
Cinemax, a 24-hour pay cable
channel that,, by design, never
has a movie on its schedule
during the sarfie month the
film is on HBO.
The Subject of duplication
was only one of ttie major pro
gram issues addressed during
the conference, the cable in
dustry's first major program
ming market. Approximately
2000 people had registered by
Tuesday's wind-up session.
An especially lively debate
surfaced Monday when of

ficials from some ot the major
Hollywood prodUttion com
panies traded barbs with pay-
TV network officials over the
possibility of Hollywood mak
ing original cable programs.
The producers insisted that,
like commercial TV, pay TV
must pay Hollywood-sized
prices for original shows. The
pay-TV executives, on the oth
er hand, seemed determined
not to get in the position, like
commercial TV, of financing
program production and not
participating in program prof
its.
Frank Biondi, HBO's vice
president for programming
said, "If we're putting up all the
money, then we think we
should have a stake in all the
rights."
Countering that, Edward
Bleier, executive vice president
of Warner Bros. Television,
suggested that HBO, which
serves approximately 8 million
of the country's 11-million pay
cable subscribers, may be get
ting a little big for its britches.
"There are some very real
questions," Bleier said, "about
the HBO-Cinemax market
share."
