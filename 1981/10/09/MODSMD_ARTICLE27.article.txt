# Facing the major dilemma
##

Many freshmen, and a surprising number
of upperclassmen, have discovered the great
difficulties involved in picking a major. After
spending much time and effort getting into
Stanford, it is disheartening to realize that
once they are in, undeclared students now
have to choose how to fill their next four
years.
But this choice is not necessarily an im
mediate one: for freshmen, declaring often
seems too far away in the future to be impor
tant; sophomores still have a year before de
claring is required; and juniors and seniors,
can always change their minds once they've
declared.
For example, Senior Rex Sharp, a former
ASSU senator, says he has changed his major
four times:
"I really didn't have a clue on what to do
after high school," he explained. "I started
out thinking I was going to be a pre-med,
then worked as a lab technician fora while
and decided I didn't like it. So then I switched
to engineering, but decided I wanted to work
with people more." At present, he is an eco
nomics major.
Apparently, changing one's major is an
easy enough procedure that those who wish
to change can do so.
According to Sharp, "You can always
change majors and not lose that much. Quan
titative requirements are the same for many
majors... the same math classes you need for
chemistry, say, can in many cases be used for
engineering."
According to the 1980-81 Stanford Student
Directory, 6630 undergraduate students reg
istered at Stanford. Among these, the most
popular majors were:
— Economics, with 401 students,*
— Biological sciences, with 342 students;
— Human biology, with 253 students;
— English, with 207 students;
— Political science, with 198 students; and
— Mechanical engineering, with 184 stu
dents.
Other students may decide to go into
something less common. Petroleum engi
neering, for example, is a field in which rela
tively few people choose to major, and yet
which holds excellent opportunities for em
ployment.
Many freshmen wonder whether or not to
declare a major right away. About this, Sally
Mahoney, registrar and associat provost of
University, said "I think that what the first
of college allow you to do is to explore
without commitments ... If you are very set
on what you want to do go ahead (and de
clare a major). But people can narrow their
focus early on a major."
Mahoney added that very few students de
clare majors as freshmen.

Micheline Horstmeyer, of the Academic
Informatin Center, said "In general,
freshmen are strongly urged not to declare.
We don't like to see students specializing too
early. Usually major requirements cause stu
dents to miss classes which they might other
wise have taken."
But Horstmeyer admitted that there are
some benefits to early declaration: "(The de
clarer) does get a new adviser in that field, but
he already has one who should be helpful."
The Jan. 15,1979 issue of The Chronicle of
Higher Education reveals the results of a na
tionwide survey of college and university fac
ulty members who ranked the faculty of each
college and university. Stanford's faculty was
rated the best in the country in business,

education and psychology. In engineering
and medicine, the University was second. It
was third in chemistry; fourth in biological
sciences, law and mathematics/statistics; fifth
in physics and political science; sixth in eco
nomics and English; seventh in history; and
eight in sociology. Hence, there are op
portunities for an excellent learning ex
perience in a variety of fields.
For the student who wishes to experiment
in different fields before declaring a major,
most classes here offer top-quality instruc
tion.
According to Sharp, starting early in your
major has to do with future goals: "People
take pre-med without really knowing what
it's like... the big difference is between peo
ple going to grad school and people who
aren't. They declare early, put in extra hours,
maybe sacrifice a little social life for their
classes. But then, you can also delay the de
cision clear up to your senior year — I did."
