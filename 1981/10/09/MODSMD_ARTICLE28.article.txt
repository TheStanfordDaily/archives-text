# China education questioned
## 
### Carol Rose 
The possibility of high social
and political costs of the chang
ing Chinese educational sys
tem was the theme of this
week's Tuesday luncheon
series at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Douglas Murray, director of
the U.S.-China Relations Pro
gram here as well as the North
east Asia-U.S. Forum of In
ternational Policy, and arecent
visitor in the People's Republic
of China, was the guest speak
er.
Murray prefaced his speech
with a reference to the as
sasination of Egypt's President
Anwar Sadat.
"Every visiting scholar group
to China has been warned by
the Chinese that the Middle
East is world's greatest hotspot,
and that the United States
should find a more stable poli
cy in region. That seems true
today," he said.
"The saying 'Education is a
reflection of society' certainly
holds true in China. It is per
haps the singly most important
window for understanding
Chinese culture as a whole,"
Murray said.
Currently there are 700 in
stitutes of higher learning in
China with only about 1 million
students, compared with 3500
universities with more than 11
million students in the United
States. In contrast, the number
of primary and secondary stu
dents in China is about equal to
the entire population of the
United States, Murray said.
There are two possible ways
to view China's educational
system, Murray said.
"On the one hand it could
be seen as a terribly misshapen
pyramid, with a pathetically
narrow tip at the higher levels
that is insufficient for effective
modernization," he said.
"It could also be viewed as
an incredible achievement for
a poor agrarian country, when
we considered its recent tech
nological achievements and lit
erary and artistic traditions,"
Murray said.

The fundamental question is,
Murray said, "is China's educa
tional cup half full or half emp
ty?"
The greatest difficulties in
learning about China's educa
tional system are the cultural
problems in interaction on
specifics and the high degree
of complexity in the educa
tional system, Murray said.
Because we were working in
a system that has state secret
laws, anything not officially
specified as open, is technically
a state secret. This results in a
tendency in the Chinese not to
volunteer information," he
said.
A more complicating part of
any study of the educational
system is that foreigners tend
to view China in simplistic
forms, exacerbated by the ap
pearance of a centralized,
simple system, he said.
The structure of the Chinese
educational system consists of
five years of primary education
and five years of secondary
education, Murray said. About
one year ago, the Ministry of
Education finished publishing
its "Unified Ten Year Cur
riculum." This curriculum is
mandated everywhere and
centrally published, he said.
"In practice, there i: n great
difference in quality, content
and culture of schools in prov
inces, and between urban and
rural areas," Murray said.
There are also educational
differences over time, he said.
"In the last four to five years
since the smashinging of the
Gang of Four there has been a
reversal of many educational
policies," Murray said.
"For years the people were
taught egalitarian values and
the lack of need for special
ization. Now they are told to
specialize, to work hard to be
the top in their field," Murray
said.
Part of the reason for the re
cent changes are economic,
according to Murray. La6t year
with the institution of China's
new economic policies, there
was an actual numerical de

cline in secondary schools, he
said.
"The closing of schools is an
attempt to say that quality is
more important than quantity,
especially at the higher levels
of education," Murray said.
Another attempt to econo
mize and improve the quality
of education has been to desig
nate 'key schools' which have
the priority on teachers and fa
cilities, he said.
"The differences between
these key schools and other
(non-key) schools are strik
ing," Murray said.
In addition, because most
students in the universities at
tended Key secondary school,
the competition to enter key
schools has increased, he said.
"If a student is not in a key
secondary school, the chances
are slim that he will attend a
university. In some key secon
dary schools, 40 to 90 percent
of the graduating class will
enter the universities," Murray
said.
An important question, ac
cording to Murray, is whether
these percentages reflect the
backgrounds and origins of the
students and their families, or
whether they are the product
of a successful school program.
Many changes have also
taken place the system of
higher education, he said.
"There seems to have been a
policy decision not to expand
the system of higher education
numerically. Instead, we saw
new departments being
created. Assuming the high
degree of specialization in Chi
na in the past few years, it
seems we may see even greater
specialization in education,"
Murray said.
The greatest danger facing
the Chinese educational sys
tem, according to Murray, is
that the relatively few national
resources going to education
are all being concentrated on
the higher levels, which may
damage the broad base that the
Chinese have established.
