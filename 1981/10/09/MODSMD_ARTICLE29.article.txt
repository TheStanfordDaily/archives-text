# Tresidder hiring drive pays off
## 
### Donald Howard 
A major publicity effort
by Tresidder Union to hire
student employees has
helped to fill nearly all avail
able positions — most of
them by students.
Through a combination
of publicity posters and Dai
ly advertisements, Tresidder
has sought to present itself
as "more than a union ... a
training ground and career
preparation center."
The publicity and re
cruitment campaign re
sulted from a spring quarter
evaluation by Union admin
istrators concerning the lack
of students available to fill
jobs. Larry Davidson, assis
tant director of Tresidder,
outlined several possible
causes behind the em
ployment crunch ex
perienced then: student
concentration upon studies,
ready availability of student
loans, and outside industry's
drawing upon student em
ployees.

"There was a lack of stu
dents to fill the jobs,"
Davison said, but at present,
"almost all our positions are
filled." The Union, which
hires 250 to 300 students
throughout its many opera
tions, has experienced no
problem in finding students
to work this quarter, he said.
Coffee House Manager
Steve Weiss reported "no
difficulty" in finding the 50
to 60 students he recently
hired. This was attributed by
Weiss to the atmosphere of
the Coffee House as well as
to the emphasis placed
upon job experience and
career skills acquired when
dealing with people.
It is not known whether
the employment crunch of
spring quarter has been
solved by the public rela
tions endeavors of Tres
idder Union or whether the
soaring cost of tuition
coupled with tighter finan
cial aid and overall inflation
have been the cause.

Janine Rood, employee
and former student man
ager at the Union
Crossroads (formerly the
Transition) is one of many
working students. Rood said
she does not receive finan
cial aid because her father's
salary is too larger, yet she
finds it necessary to work to
offset college costs. Rood
has three different jobs, oc
cupying a total of 25 hours
per week, and she also takes
14 units in her engineering
major.
It is partly upon the finan
cial needs of the students
thatTresidder Union admin
istrators base their decision
to hire from within the Stan
ford student community.
This dedication has resulted
in a certain amount of pres
sure being exerted on the
individual businesses lo
cated within the Union.
"The administration re
quires we hire a majority of
students," said Ben
Esposito, assistant manager

of The Store. Esposito
added, "Personally, I'd like
to see everyone (hired)
from the outside."
Such feelings are not ex
pressed on a widespread
basis, yet there are certain
problems in hiring a large
number of students.
Esposito pointed out the
problem of reliability. "Stu
dents want to sleep in or
don't want to work," he
said. Esposito did note,
however, that there are
many reponsible employees
on his staff.
Rood echoed similar feel
ings. It's "kind of a two-way
street," she said. "Students
tend to be unreliable, they
don't like what they're
doing," she said. Rood went
on to cite the problems of
scheduling, the numbers of
hours students are available
to work, and the difficulty of
finals.
In the face of such prob
lems, Tresidder retains its
employment philosophy.
