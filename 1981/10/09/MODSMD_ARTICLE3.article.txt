# Mascot, some fee assessments qualify
## ASSU ballot measures scheduled 
### 
by Adam Goodman
A presidential committee will join
the search next month fora mascot to
represent the University, said James
Lyons, dean of student affairs and
chairman of the committee.
The 16-member committee, ap
pointed by President Donald Ken
nedy, will meet shortly after the fall
ASSU election to consider the results
of a mascot referendum on the
ballot, Lyons said.
The referendum was designed be
cause "students should have some
input on how it's (the mascot de
cision) resolved," according to ASSU
Senator Mark Epstein, the referen
dum's sponsor.
The referendum allows students
three mascot choices — the Tree, the
Griffin and Cardinal (the color) — as
well as a write-in choice. It also asks
students whether they would be sat
isfied with the cardinal color as the
University mascot "in the event that
the election results show ho clear
choice."
To get the mascot referendum on
the ballot for the Oct. 28-29 election,
Epstein was required to obtain the
signature of at least five percent of
the student population — or 620 sig
natures on his petition by 5 p.m. yes
terday. According to Council of Pres
idents (COP) member Chris Greene,
the referendum petition consisted of
927 signatures — though they had
not been verified yesterday.
Epstein said the referendum was
his own and was not sponsored by
the ASSU. "It is my personal referen
dum and I pretty much carried it out
with minor help from other people,"
he said.
Epstein said he began collecting
signatures because he thought "it's
time we really resolve this thing." He
said he began Wednesday evening
and by 5 p.m. yesterday had collected
about 800 signatures himself.
"You've got to know how to use peo
ple so they can help themselves,"
Epstein said.
The mascot committee will include
four varsity athletes, a COP member,
an ASSU Senate representative, a Dai

ly representative and various athletic
department-, alumni-, and Univer
sity-related representatives.
"Hopefully we'll represent every le
gitimate interest on this issue,"
Greene said.
Greene said that if there is a stu
dent consensus on the ballot it will
certainly be "looked at" by the com
mittee. He emphasized that the ref
erendum result was not a binding
commitment, however. "It's not a
decision in itself; it's a statement on
how the student body feels which
should carry a lot of weight."
Lyons would not say that the com
mittee will definitely make a mascot
recommendation but did say it is an
advisory committee to Kennedy. "In
the absence of a proposal, it is con
ceivable that we would keep what we
have, the cardinal color."
The nine-year old search fora
mascot begain in April 1972 when
then-President Richard Lyman of
ficially abolished the Indian as Stan
ford's mascot following the < ~om
plaints of Native American students.
A mascot committee at that time
chose "Thunderchickens" as a new
symbol, but that choice was quickly
criticized. The University then re
instated cardinal, which had been
the mascot before the Indians.
Over the years, various referen
dums have surfaced. In 1975, more
than 1000 students chose "Robber
Barons" as their choice for mascot,
but the idea was trounced by admin
istration members, alumni and other
students.
Various student groups have had
special interests in the search fora
mascot. Athletes have pushed for
Griffins in 1976 and 1978; the band
has selected the tree as their mascot;
and some alumni have instituted
"Bring back the Indian" movements.
Attempts to find a consensus on
the mascot issue, including referen
dums in the past two years, have con
sistently failed.

The only other ballot petition
turned into the ASSU office yester
day was from Volunteers in Asia.
Greene said this fee assessment peti
tion "still had to be verified." Fee
assessment petitions require the sig
natures of 10 percent of the student
population — 1240 students.
The ASSU Senate will meet Tues
day, Oct. 13 to discuss ballot applica
tions for fee assessments. The Stan
ford Alumni Network, Stanford
Committee on Political Education,
Stanford for Environmental Educa
tion, Stanford Progressive Alliance,
the Bridge, the Stanford Women's
Center and the Stanford Band have
all applied to be on the ballot, ac
cording to Epstein. The Academic
Organizations Board and the new
Campus Entertainment Board will be
placed on the ballot, Epstein said.
Groups approved by the Senate
from last spring include the Publica
tions Board, Program fee, ASSU I egal
Counseling, the Boathouse, and the
Graduate Students Association.
