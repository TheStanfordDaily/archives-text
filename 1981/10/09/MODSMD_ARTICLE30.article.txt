AWACS plan backed
Washington — As Congress began a
week-long recess yesterday, the intensified
lobbying effort mounted by President
Ronald Reagan in the wake of Anwar Sadat's
assassination has induced eight senators to
declaretheir backing for the controversial
sale of Airborne Warning and Control Sys
tem (AWACS) planes to Saudi Arabia.
Two — Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.) — are defectors from the
group of 50 senators who earlier had an
nounced their intention to vote against the
deal. The other six, including Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who yesterday de
clared her support for the president, all had
been expected to vote for the sale.
Despite the hard-sell tactics of White
House lobbyists, congressional sources
seem to agree that, as of now, at least 55 sen
ators are firmly opposed or leaning strongly
against the sale, while the administration's
support numbers between 30 and 40.
The Saudi deal — the largest arms sale in
history — will be blocked if both houses of
Congress vote against it before the end of
the month. The administration concedes it
has no chance of prevailing in the Demo
cratic House, and it has staked its hopes on
turning the numbers around in the presum
ably more sympathetic Republican Senate.
At present, the main thrust of adminis
tration strategy is to cite the death of Sadat
— America's closest friend in the Arab
world — as evidence of the need to cultivate
the cooperation of other moderate Mideast
regimes such as Saudi Arabia's and to appeal
to Republican senators to show their loyalty
to Reagan as he confronts his first major for
eign policy test.
Tax plan resistance grows
Washington — The chairman of the Sen
ate Finance Committee said yesterday there
is growing support in the Senate fora three
month postponement of next year's sched
uled cut in income taxes, as one alternative
to the additional budget cuts that have been
proposed by President Ronald Reagan.
Describing the pressure for the deferral as
"substantial," Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said he has told White House officials: "You
guys better get with it or you are going to
have a problem on your hands."
At a breakfast with reporters, Dole said he
personally opposes tinkering with the re
cently enacted tax cuts in an effort to save
money, but he added that he did not"open
the door," and consequently it is not his
role to "slam it," meaning he will not take
the lead in opposition.
Administration officials have strongly re
jected proposals for postponing the tax cut
— a 10 percent rate cut in rates in all
brackets scheduled to take effect next July
1. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan, for example, declared in a
speech in San Francisco that "we have no in
tention of deleting, delaying or backing off
from the three-year, 25 percent tax rate
cut," in which next year's scheduled 10 per
cent would be the second installment.
The administration has, however, called
on Congress to produce at least $13 billion
in new spending cuts in fiscal year 1982 and
to pass $3 billion in tax increases for the
same year. Senate Republicans are openly

balking at the budget cuts and are consider
ing an assortment of other methods to hold
down the deficit.
One of the alternatives they are consider
ing is increases in federal excise taxes, par
ticularly the "sin" taxes on tobacco, beer,
wine and distilled alcohol.
The congressional staffers have worked
up estimates showing that a doubling of the
cigarette tax to 16 cents a pack would raise
$4.8 billion over three years, of which $1.2
would be raised in 1982; a doubling of liq
uor taxes would produce $1.2 billion in 1982
and $5.5 billion over three years, and the
raising of beer and wine taxes to $18 a barrel
and 34 cents a gallon respectively would
produce $0.9 billion in 1982 and a total of
$3.5 billion through 1984.
Similarly, postponement of next year's
scheduled 10 percent rate cut from July 1 to
Oct. 1 would produce $7.4 billion in fiscal
year 1982 and about $1 billion in 1983. Post
ponement of the 1983 rate cut for three
months would raise the revenue savings in
1983 to $8.3 billion to add $0.7 billion in
1984.
As alternatives to making new and deeper
cuts in such programs as food stamps, health
services, Amtrak and school lunches, the
excise tax increases and postponement of
the individual rate cuts are politically attrac
tive.
Sinai settlers protest treaty
Jerusalem — Following the assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, militant
Jewish settlers in the occupied northern Si
nai Peninsula have vowed to accelerate
their campaign to force the Israeli govern
ment to abrogate the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty and cancel the scheduled April 26
withdrawal from the Sinai.
The settlers warned that the political in
stability of Egypt, as evidenced by the as
sassination and the rise of violent Islamic
fundamentalism, makes it imperative for Is
rael to stop the withdrawal and retain at
least part of the strategic depth of the Sinai.
"I firmly believe there will be no evac
uation of the area next April. The situation is
too unstable," said Uri Elitzur, secretary of
the Stop the Withdrawal from Sinai move
ment, which says it has collected 300,000 sig
natures to a petition favoring abrogation of
the treaty. The group says its goal is a million
names, nearly one-third of Israel's popu
lation.
Ella Weizman, a spokeswoman for the
movement in Sadot, in northern Sinai, said,
"We've always asked what if something
happens to Sadat. How can Israel rely on the
treaty if it doesn't know who is going to be
in charge in Egypt from one day to the
next?"
While the Stop the Withdrawal move
ment respresents, so far, a minority within
Israel, Sadat's assassination has presented
Prime Minister Menachem Begin with new
complications in his plans for orderly com
pliance with the terms of the peace treaty.
Reagan delays gas bill
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
yesterday postponed for "an indefinite
time" the expected request that Congress
approve deregulation of natural gas prices
over a three-year period.

After Reagan met with his Cabinet Coun
cil on Natural Resources, Energy Secretary
James Edwards said that the group had again
unanimously recommended deregulation
but that action was not taken because of the
"timing" involved. Edwards would not be
explicit, saying only that the president "may
want to get his economic policy package
out of the way" before sending his de
regulation proposal to Capitol Hill.
Some officials at the Department of
Energy had been telling interested parties,
including representatives of natural gas
producers, that deregulation would be pro
posed yesterday. A spokesman for the Natu
ral Gas Supply Association, a producers'
group, said they were "disappointed and
disturbed" by the delay, calling it"a grave
mistake."
Under terms of the Natural Gas Policy Act
now in effect, the wellhead price of newly
discovered natural gas will be deregulated
after 1985. About half of the gas then being
produced, however, would remain subject
to controls indefinitely. Advocates say de
regulation would encourage the search for
more gas and conservation by gas users.
Economists are uncertain how much aver
age wellhead prices would rise, but most ex
pect them at least to double, adding many
billions of dollars to gas users' costs.
O'Connor skirts conflict
Washington — In the first week of her first
term on the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra
O'Connor has disqualified herself from
more than one-fourth of the court's hear
ings because of conflict-of-interest prob
lems.
These disqualifications provide the first
sign that O'Connor — like Justice Lewis
Powell Jr. and her predecessor, former Jus
tice Potter Stewart — may often feel obliged
to remove herself from Supreme Court
cases to avoid the appearance of conflicts of
interest.
The justices have taken up 11 cases this
week. In three of them, lawyers presented
their arguments to an eight-member Su
preme Court, with O'Connor's seat on the
bench vacant. Two of the cases involved in
surance companies; the third was an impor
tant test of the federal laws that apply to po
litical action committees.
O'Connor confirmed through an aide
that she had felt she was compelled by the
federal conflict-of-interest law to step aside
in these cases. But she declined to explain
what specific interests she had, financial or
otherwise, that led her to disqualify herself.
"It is the court's tradition not to explain
why justices disqualify themselves. She will
follow this tradition," Supreme Court pub
lic information officer Barrett McGum said.
A 1974 law requires federal judges to dis
qualify themselves from cases in which they
have any financial interest, no matter how
insignificant the interest might be. In addi
tion, judges are legally obliged to step aside
if they believe they are so closely connected
to one of the parties or attorneys that it
would be improper for them to participate.
In past years, the two justices who most
frequently disqualified themselves were
Powell and Stewart, the two wealthiest
members of the court. Many of the cases
from which they stepped aside involved

firms in which they had financial holdings.
Powell also disqualified himself from cases
involving partners or clients of his former
Richmond, Virginia, law firm.
Walesa calls for talks
Warsaw — The leader of Poland's inde
pendent Solidarity trade union, Lech
Walesa, called yesterday for immediate ne
gotiations with Communist authorities fol
lowing the conclusion of Solidarity's first na
tional congress.
Walesa's call came as Solidarity's newly
elected leaders met in Gdansk to choose a
decision-making presidium. According to
Solidarity sources, sharp disputes erupted
during the meeting as some union officials,
including Walesa himself, challenged the
first results of the election.
The Solidarity leader has found himself in
danger of being outvoted on the union's
National Consultative Committee, many of
whose 107 members favor more radical pol
icies. Several of his closest advisers failed to
win seats on the committee, a kind of union
parliament, during elections in the closing
stages of the congress.
As most of the 892 delegates at the con
gress left Gdansk for home, Communist Par
ty leaders began assessing the results of the
18-day meeting, which was held in two
stages. The first reaction appeared to be a
feeling that, despite the intransigence of
some of the delegates and the political tone
of many of the final resolutions, it could
have been much worse.
In an interview with The Washington
Post, First Deputy Premier Janusz
Obodowski agreed that the course of the
second round was more acceptable to the
government than the first round, which
ended with a demand for free elections and
a message of support to free trade unionists
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
Asked whether this meant there could
now be early talks between Solidarity's new
leaders and the authorities, he replied:
"What other choice do both sides have ex
cept negotiations?"
Government-union negotiations were
virtually suspended during the congress as a
result of the earlier collapse of talks on Soli
darity's demands for greater access to the
news media. A resolution adopted by the
congress calls fora nationwide warning
strike within two weeks unless agreement is
reached over price rises and economic re
form.
Market rallies in late trading
— The Dow jones average of 30 in
dustrials, which had been off more than 3
points earlier in the day, recovered and fin
ished up 9.42 to 878.14, its highest level since
Sept. 2 and bringing its gain for the week to
17.41 points.
Big Board volume totaled 47.09 million
shares compared with 50.03 million in the
previous session.
Today's Weather
— Fair through tomorrow except patchy
fog early mornings. Lows mid 40s to mid 50s.
Slow warming with highs in the 60s to mid
70s. Westerly winds to 20 mph afternoons

O'Connor skirts conflict
Washington — In the first week of her first
term on the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra
O'Connor has disqualified herself from
more than one-fourth of the court's hear
ings because of conflict-of-interest prob
lems.
These disqualifications provide the first
sign that O'Connor — like Justice Lewis
Powell Jr. and her predecessor, former Jus
tice Potter Stewart — may often feel obliged
to remove herself from Supreme Court
cases to avoid the appearance of conflicts of
interest.
The justices have taken up 11 cases this
week. In three of them, lawyers presented
their arguments to an eight-member Su
preme Court, with O'Connor's seat on the
bench vacant. Two of the cases involved in
surance companies; the third was an impor
tant test of the federal laws that apply to po
litical action committees.
O'Connor confirmed through an aide
that she had felt she was compelled by the
federal conflict-of-interest law to step aside
in these cases. But she declined to explain
what specific interests she had, financial or
otherwise, that led her to disqualify herself.
"It is the court's tradition not to explain
why justices disqualify themselves. She will
follow this tradition," Supreme Court pub
lic information officer Barrett McGum said.
A 1974 law requires federal judges to dis
qualify themselves from cases in which they
have any financial interest, no matter how
insignificant the interest might be. In addi
tion, judges are legally obliged to step aside
if they believe they are so closely connected
to one of the parties or attorneys that it
would be improper for them to participate.
In past years, the two justices who most
frequently disqualified themselves were
Powell and Stewart, the two wealthiest
members of the court. Many of the cases
from which they stepped aside involved

firms in which they had financial holdings.
Powell also disqualified himself from cases
involving partners or clients of his former
Richmond, Virginia, law firm.
Walesa calls for talks
Warsaw — The leader of Poland's inde
pendent Solidarity trade union, Lech
Walesa, called yesterday for immediate ne
gotiations with Communist authorities fol
lowing the conclusion of Solidarity's first na
tional congress.
Walesa's call came as Solidarity's newly
elected leaders met in Gdansk to choose a
decision-making presidium. According to
Solidarity sources, sharp disputes erupted
during the meeting as some union officials,
including Walesa himself, challenged the
first results of the election.
The Solidarity leader has found himself in
danger of being outvoted on the union's
National Consultative Committee, many of
whose 107 members favor more radical pol
icies. Several of his closest advisers failed to
win seats on the committee, a kind of union
parliament, during elections in the closing
stages of the congress.
As most of the 892 delegates at the con
gress left Gdansk for home, Communist Par
ty leaders began assessing the results of the
18-day meeting, which was held in two
stages. The first reaction appeared to be a
feeling that, despite the intransigence of
some of the delegates and the political tone
of many of the final resolutions, it could
have been much worse.
In an interview with The Washington
Post, First Deputy Premier Janusz
Obodowski agreed that the course of the
second round was more acceptable to the
government than the first round, which
ended with a demand for free elections and
a message of support to free trade unionists
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
Asked whether this meant there could
now be early talks between Solidarity's new
leaders and the authorities, he replied:
"What other choice do both sides have ex
cept negotiations?"
Government-union negotiations were
virtually suspended during the congress as a
result of the earlier collapse of talks on Soli
darity's demands for greater access to the
news media. A resolution adopted by the
congress calls fora nationwide warning
strike within two weeks unless agreement is
reached over price rises and economic re
form.

AWACS plan backed
Washington — As Congress began a
week-long recess yesterday, the intensified
lobbying effort mounted by President
Ronald Reagan in the wake of Anwar Sadat's
assassination has induced eight senators to
declaretheir backing for the controversial
sale of Airborne Warning and Control Sys
tem (AWACS) planes to Saudi Arabia.
Two — Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.) — are defectors from the
group of 50 senators who earlier had an
nounced their intention to vote against the
deal. The other six, including Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who yesterday de
clared her support for the president, all had
been expected to vote for the sale.
Despite the hard-sell tactics of White
House lobbyists, congressional sources
seem to agree that, as of now, at least 55 sen
ators are firmly opposed or leaning strongly
against the sale, while the administration's
support numbers between 30 and 40.
The Saudi deal — the largest arms sale in
history — will be blocked if both houses of
Congress vote against it before the end of
the month. The administration concedes it
has no chance of prevailing in the Demo
cratic House, and it has staked its hopes on
turning the numbers around in the presum
ably more sympathetic Republican Senate.
At present, the main thrust of adminis
tration strategy is to cite the death of Sadat
— America's closest friend in the Arab
world — as evidence of the need to cultivate
the cooperation of other moderate Mideast
regimes such as Saudi Arabia's and to appeal
to Republican senators to show their loyalty
to Reagan as he confronts his first major for
eign policy test.
Tax plan resistance grows
Washington — The chairman of the Sen
ate Finance Committee said yesterday there
is growing support in the Senate fora three
month postponement of next year's sched
uled cut in income taxes, as one alternative
to the additional budget cuts that have been
proposed by President Ronald Reagan.
Describing the pressure for the deferral as
"substantial," Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said he has told White House officials: "You
guys better get with it or you are going to
have a problem on your hands."
At a breakfast with reporters, Dole said he
personally opposes tinkering with the re
cently enacted tax cuts in an effort to save
money, but he added that he did not"open
the door," and consequently it is not his
role to "slam it," meaning he will not take
the lead in opposition.
Administration officials have strongly re
jected proposals for postponing the tax cut
— a 10 percent rate cut in rates in all
brackets scheduled to take effect next July
1. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan, for example, declared in a
speech in San Francisco that "we have no in
tention of deleting, delaying or backing off
from the three-year, 25 percent tax rate
cut," in which next year's scheduled 10 per
cent would be the second installment.
The administration has, however, called
on Congress to produce at least $13 billion
in new spending cuts in fiscal year 1982 and
to pass $3 billion in tax increases for the
same year. Senate Republicans are openly

balking at the budget cuts and are consider
ing an assortment of other methods to hold
down the deficit.
One of the alternatives they are consider
ing is increases in federal excise taxes, par
ticularly the "sin" taxes on tobacco, beer,
wine and distilled alcohol.
The congressional staffers have worked
up estimates showing that a doubling of the
cigarette tax to 16 cents a pack would raise
$4.8 billion over three years, of which $1.2
would be raised in 1982; a doubling of liq
uor taxes would produce $1.2 billion in 1982
and $5.5 billion over three years, and the
raising of beer and wine taxes to $18 a barrel
and 34 cents a gallon respectively would
produce $0.9 billion in 1982 and a total of
$3.5 billion through 1984.
Similarly, postponement of next year's
scheduled 10 percent rate cut from July 1 to
Oct. 1 would produce $7.4 billion in fiscal
year 1982 and about $1 billion in 1983. Post
ponement of the 1983 rate cut for three
months would raise the revenue savings in
1983 to $8.3 billion to add $0.7 billion in
1984.
As alternatives to making new and deeper
cuts in such programs as food stamps, health
services, Amtrak and school lunches, the
excise tax increases and postponement of
the individual rate cuts are politically attrac
tive.
Sinai settlers protest treaty
Jerusalem — Following the assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, militant
Jewish settlers in the occupied northern Si
nai Peninsula have vowed to accelerate
their campaign to force the Israeli govern
ment to abrogate the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty and cancel the scheduled April 26
withdrawal from the Sinai.
The settlers warned that the political in
stability of Egypt, as evidenced by the as
sassination and the rise of violent Islamic
fundamentalism, makes it imperative for Is
rael to stop the withdrawal and retain at
least part of the strategic depth of the Sinai.
"I firmly believe there will be no evac
uation of the area next April. The situation is
too unstable," said Uri Elitzur, secretary of
the Stop the Withdrawal from Sinai move
ment, which says it has collected 300,000 sig
natures to a petition favoring abrogation of
the treaty. The group says its goal is a million
names, nearly one-third of Israel's popu
lation.
Ella Weizman, a spokeswoman for the
movement in Sadot, in northern Sinai, said,
"We've always asked what if something
happens to Sadat. How can Israel rely on the
treaty if it doesn't know who is going to be
in charge in Egypt from one day to the
next?"
While the Stop the Withdrawal move
ment respresents, so far, a minority within
Israel, Sadat's assassination has presented
Prime Minister Menachem Begin with new
complications in his plans for orderly com
pliance with the terms of the peace treaty.
Reagan delays gas bill
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
yesterday postponed for "an indefinite
time" the expected request that Congress
approve deregulation of natural gas prices
over a three-year period.

After Reagan met with his Cabinet Coun
cil on Natural Resources, Energy Secretary
James Edwards said that the group had again
unanimously recommended deregulation
but that action was not taken because of the
"timing" involved. Edwards would not be
explicit, saying only that the president "may
want to get his economic policy package
out of the way" before sending his de
regulation proposal to Capitol Hill.
Some officials at the Department of
Energy had been telling interested parties,
including representatives of natural gas
producers, that deregulation would be pro
posed yesterday. A spokesman for the Natu
ral Gas Supply Association, a producers'
group, said they were "disappointed and
disturbed" by the delay, calling it"a grave
mistake."
Under terms of the Natural Gas Policy Act
now in effect, the wellhead price of newly
discovered natural gas will be deregulated
after 1985. About half of the gas then being
produced, however, would remain subject
to controls indefinitely. Advocates say de
regulation would encourage the search for
more gas and conservation by gas users.
Economists are uncertain how much aver
age wellhead prices would rise, but most ex
pect them at least to double, adding many
billions of dollars to gas users' costs.

money, but he added that he did not"open
the door," and consequently it is not his
role to "slam it," meaning he will not take
the lead in opposition.
Administration officials have strongly re
jected proposals for postponing the tax cut
— a 10 percent rate cut in rates in all
brackets scheduled to take effect next July
1. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan, for example, declared in a
speech in San Francisco that "we have no in
tention of deleting, delaying or backing off
from the three-year, 25 percent tax rate
cut," in which next year's scheduled 10 per
cent would be the second installment.
The administration has, however, called
on Congress to produce at least $13 billion
in new spending cuts in fiscal year 1982 and
to pass $3 billion in tax increases for the
same year. Senate Republicans are openly

balking at the budget cuts and are consider
ing an assortment of other methods to hold
down the deficit.
One of the alternatives they are consider
ing is increases in federal excise taxes, par
ticularly the "sin" taxes on tobacco, beer,
wine and distilled alcohol.
The congressional staffers have worked
up estimates showing that a doubling of the
cigarette tax to 16 cents a pack would raise
$4.8 billion over three years, of which $1.2
would be raised in 1982; a doubling of liq
uor taxes would produce $1.2 billion in 1982
and $5.5 billion over three years, and the
raising of beer and wine taxes to $18 a barrel
and 34 cents a gallon respectively would
produce $0.9 billion in 1982 and a total of
$3.5 billion through 1984.
Similarly, postponement of next year's
scheduled 10 percent rate cut from July 1 to
Oct. 1 would produce $7.4 billion in fiscal
year 1982 and about $1 billion in 1983. Post
ponement of the 1983 rate cut for three
months would raise the revenue savings in
1983 to $8.3 billion to add $0.7 billion in
1984.
As alternatives to making new and deeper
cuts in such programs as food stamps, health
services, Amtrak and school lunches, the
excise tax increases and postponement of
the individual rate cuts are politically attrac
tive.
Sinai settlers protest treaty
Jerusalem — Following the assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, militant
Jewish settlers in the occupied northern Si
nai Peninsula have vowed to accelerate
their campaign to force the Israeli govern
ment to abrogate the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty and cancel the scheduled April 26
withdrawal from the Sinai.
The settlers warned that the political in
stability of Egypt, as evidenced by the as
sassination and the rise of violent Islamic
fundamentalism, makes it imperative for Is
rael to stop the withdrawal and retain at
least part of the strategic depth of the Sinai.
"I firmly believe there will be no evac
uation of the area next April. The situation is
too unstable," said Uri Elitzur, secretary of
the Stop the Withdrawal from Sinai move
ment, which says it has collected 300,000 sig
natures to a petition favoring abrogation of
the treaty. The group says its goal is a million
names, nearly one-third of Israel's popu
lation.
Ella Weizman, a spokeswoman for the
movement in Sadot, in northern Sinai, said,
"We've always asked what if something
happens to Sadat. How can Israel rely on the
treaty if it doesn't know who is going to be
in charge in Egypt from one day to the
next?"
While the Stop the Withdrawal move
ment respresents, so far, a minority within
Israel, Sadat's assassination has presented
Prime Minister Menachem Begin with new
complications in his plans for orderly com
pliance with the terms of the peace treaty.
Reagan delays gas bill
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
yesterday postponed for "an indefinite
time" the expected request that Congress
approve deregulation of natural gas prices
over a three-year period.

After Reagan met with his Cabinet Coun
cil on Natural Resources, Energy Secretary
James Edwards said that the group had again
unanimously recommended deregulation
but that action was not taken because of the
"timing" involved. Edwards would not be
explicit, saying only that the president "may
want to get his economic policy package
out of the way" before sending his de
regulation proposal to Capitol Hill.
Some officials at the Department of
Energy had been telling interested parties,
including representatives of natural gas
producers, that deregulation would be pro
posed yesterday. A spokesman for the Natu
ral Gas Supply Association, a producers'
group, said they were "disappointed and
disturbed" by the delay, calling it"a grave
mistake."
Under terms of the Natural Gas Policy Act
now in effect, the wellhead price of newly
discovered natural gas will be deregulated
after 1985. About half of the gas then being
produced, however, would remain subject
to controls indefinitely. Advocates say de
regulation would encourage the search for
more gas and conservation by gas users.
Economists are uncertain how much aver
age wellhead prices would rise, but most ex

billions of dollars to gas users' costs.
O'Connor skirts conflict
Washington — In the first week of her first
term on the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra
O'Connor has disqualified herself from
more than one-fourth of the court's hear
ings because of conflict-of-interest prob
lems.
These disqualifications provide the first
sign that O'Connor — like Justice Lewis
Powell Jr. and her predecessor, former Jus
tice Potter Stewart — may often feel obliged
to remove herself from Supreme Court
cases to avoid the appearance of conflicts of
interest.
The justices have taken up 11 cases this
week. In three of them, lawyers presented
their arguments to an eight-member Su
preme Court, with O'Connor's seat on the
bench vacant. Two of the cases involved in
surance companies; the third was an impor
tant test of the federal laws that apply to po
litical action committees.
O'Connor confirmed through an aide
that she had felt she was compelled by the
federal conflict-of-interest law to step aside
in these cases. But she declined to explain
what specific interests she had, financial or
otherwise, that led her to disqualify herself.
"It is the court's tradition not to explain
why justices disqualify themselves. She will
follow this tradition," Supreme Court pub
lic information officer Barrett McGum said.
A 1974 law requires federal judges to dis
qualify themselves from cases in which they
have any financial interest, no matter how
insignificant the interest might be. In addi
tion, judges are legally obliged to step aside
if they believe they are so closely connected
to one of the parties or attorneys that it
would be improper for them to participate.
In past years, the two justices who most
frequently disqualified themselves were
Powell and Stewart, the two wealthiest
members of the court. Many of the cases
from which they stepped aside involved

firms in which they had financial holdings.
Powell also disqualified himself from cases
involving partners or clients of his former
Richmond, Virginia, law firm.
Walesa calls for talks
Warsaw — The leader of Poland's inde
pendent Solidarity trade union, Lech
Walesa, called yesterday for immediate ne
gotiations with Communist authorities fol
lowing the conclusion of Solidarity's first na
tional congress.
Walesa's call came as Solidarity's newly
elected leaders met in Gdansk to choose a
decision-making presidium. According to
Solidarity sources, sharp disputes erupted
during the meeting as some union officials,
including Walesa himself, challenged the
first results of the election.
The Solidarity leader has found himself in
danger of being outvoted on the union's
National Consultative Committee, many of
whose 107 members favor more radical pol
icies. Several of his closest advisers failed to
win seats on the committee, a kind of union
parliament, during elections in the closing
stages of the congress.
As most of the 892 delegates at the con
gress left Gdansk for home, Communist Par
ty leaders began assessing the results of the
18-day meeting, which was held in two
stages. The first reaction appeared to be a
feeling that, despite the intransigence of
some of the delegates and the political tone
of many of the final resolutions, it could
have been much worse.
In an interview with The Washington
Post, First Deputy Premier Janusz
Obodowski agreed that the course of the
second round was more acceptable to the
government than the first round, which
ended with a demand for free elections and
a message of support to free trade unionists
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
Asked whether this meant there could
now be early talks between Solidarity's new
leaders and the authorities, he replied:
"What other choice do both sides have ex
cept negotiations?"
Government-union negotiations were
virtually suspended during the congress as a
result of the earlier collapse of talks on Soli
darity's demands for greater access to the
news media. A resolution adopted by the
congress calls fora nationwide warning
strike within two weeks unless agreement is
reached over price rises and economic re
form.
Market rallies in late trading

AWACS plan backed
Washington — As Congress began a
week-long recess yesterday, the intensified
lobbying effort mounted by President
Ronald Reagan in the wake of Anwar Sadat's
assassination has induced eight senators to
declaretheir backing for the controversial
sale of Airborne Warning and Control Sys
tem (AWACS) planes to Saudi Arabia.
Two — Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.) — are defectors from the
group of 50 senators who earlier had an
nounced their intention to vote against the
deal. The other six, including Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who yesterday de
clared her support for the president, all had
been expected to vote for the sale.
Despite the hard-sell tactics of White
House lobbyists, congressional sources
seem to agree that, as of now, at least 55 sen
ators are firmly opposed or leaning strongly
against the sale, while the administration's
support numbers between 30 and 40.
The Saudi deal — the largest arms sale in
history — will be blocked if both houses of
Congress vote against it before the end of
the month. The administration concedes it
has no chance of prevailing in the Demo
cratic House, and it has staked its hopes on
turning the numbers around in the presum
ably more sympathetic Republican Senate.
At present, the main thrust of adminis
tration strategy is to cite the death of Sadat
— America's closest friend in the Arab
world — as evidence of the need to cultivate
the cooperation of other moderate Mideast
regimes such as Saudi Arabia's and to appeal
to Republican senators to show their loyalty
to Reagan as he confronts his first major for
eign policy test.
Tax plan resistance grows
Washington — The chairman of the Sen
ate Finance Committee said yesterday there
is growing support in the Senate fora three
month postponement of next year's sched
uled cut in income taxes, as one alternative
to the additional budget cuts that have been
proposed by President Ronald Reagan.
Describing the pressure for the deferral as
"substantial," Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said he has told White House officials: "You
guys better get with it or you are going to
have a problem on your hands."
At a breakfast with reporters, Dole said he
personally opposes tinkering with the re
cently enacted tax cuts in an effort to save
money, but he added that he did not"open
the door," and consequently it is not his
role to "slam it," meaning he will not take
the lead in opposition.

gotiations with Communist authorities fol
lowing the conclusion of Solidarity's first na
tional congress.
Walesa's call came as Solidarity's newly
elected leaders met in Gdansk to choose a
decision-making presidium. According to
Solidarity sources, sharp disputes erupted
during the meeting as some union officials,
including Walesa himself, challenged the
first results of the election.
The Solidarity leader has found himself in
danger of being outvoted on the union's
National Consultative Committee, many of
whose 107 members favor more radical pol
icies. Several of his closest advisers failed to
win seats on the committee, a kind of union
parliament, during elections in the closing
stages of the congress.
As most of the 892 delegates at the con
gress left Gdansk for home, Communist Par
ty leaders began assessing the results of the
18-day meeting, which was held in two
stages. The first reaction appeared to be a
feeling that, despite the intransigence of
some of the delegates and the political tone
of many of the final resolutions, it could
have been much worse.
In an interview with The Washington
Post, First Deputy Premier Janusz
Obodowski agreed that the course of the
second round was more acceptable to the
government than the first round, which
ended with a demand for free elections and
a message of support to free trade unionists
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
Asked whether this meant there could
now be early talks between Solidarity's new
leaders and the authorities, he replied:
"What other choice do both sides have ex
cept negotiations?"
Government-union negotiations were
virtually suspended during the congress as a
result of the earlier collapse of talks on Soli
darity's demands for greater access to the
news media. A resolution adopted by the
congress calls fora nationwide warning
strike within two weeks unless agreement is
reached over price rises and economic re
form.

AWACS plan backed
Washington — As Congress began a
week-long recess yesterday, the intensified
lobbying effort mounted by President
Ronald Reagan in the wake of Anwar Sadat's
assassination has induced eight senators to
declaretheir backing for the controversial
sale of Airborne Warning and Control Sys
tem (AWACS) planes to Saudi Arabia.
Two — Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Alan
Simpson (R-Wyo.) — are defectors from the
group of 50 senators who earlier had an
nounced their intention to vote against the
deal. The other six, including Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who yesterday de
clared her support for the president, all had
been expected to vote for the sale.
Despite the hard-sell tactics of White
House lobbyists, congressional sources
seem to agree that, as of now, at least 55 sen
ators are firmly opposed or leaning strongly
against the sale, while the administration's
support numbers between 30 and 40.
The Saudi deal — the largest arms sale in
history — will be blocked if both houses of
Congress vote against it before the end of
the month. The administration concedes it
has no chance of prevailing in the Demo
cratic House, and it has staked its hopes on
turning the numbers around in the presum
ably more sympathetic Republican Senate.
At present, the main thrust of adminis
tration strategy is to cite the death of Sadat
— America's closest friend in the Arab
world — as evidence of the need to cultivate
the cooperation of other moderate Mideast
regimes such as Saudi Arabia's and to appeal
to Republican senators to show their loyalty
to Reagan as he confronts his first major for
eign policy test.
Tax plan resistance grows
Washington — The chairman of the Sen
ate Finance Committee said yesterday there
is growing support in the Senate fora three
month postponement of next year's sched
uled cut in income taxes, as one alternative
to the additional budget cuts that have been
proposed by President Ronald Reagan.
Describing the pressure for the deferral as
"substantial," Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said he has told White House officials: "You
guys better get with it or you are going to
have a problem on your hands."
At a breakfast with reporters, Dole said he
personally opposes tinkering with the re
cently enacted tax cuts in an effort to save
money, but he added that he did not"open
the door," and consequently it is not his
role to "slam it," meaning he will not take
the lead in opposition.
Administration officials have strongly re
jected proposals for postponing the tax cut
— a 10 percent rate cut in rates in all
brackets scheduled to take effect next July
1. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan, for example, declared in a
speech in San Francisco that "we have no in
tention of deleting, delaying or backing off
from the three-year, 25 percent tax rate
cut," in which next year's scheduled 10 per
cent would be the second installment.
The administration has, however, called
on Congress to produce at least $13 billion
in new spending cuts in fiscal year 1982 and
to pass $3 billion in tax increases for the
same year. Senate Republicans are openly

balking at the budget cuts and are consider
ing an assortment of other methods to hold
down the deficit.
One of the alternatives they are consider
ing is increases in federal excise taxes, par
ticularly the "sin" taxes on tobacco, beer,
wine and distilled alcohol.
The congressional staffers have worked
up estimates showing that a doubling of the
cigarette tax to 16 cents a pack would raise
$4.8 billion over three years, of which $1.2
would be raised in 1982; a doubling of liq
uor taxes would produce $1.2 billion in 1982
and $5.5 billion over three years, and the
raising of beer and wine taxes to $18 a barrel
and 34 cents a gallon respectively would
produce $0.9 billion in 1982 and a total of
$3.5 billion through 1984.
Similarly, postponement of next year's
scheduled 10 percent rate cut from July 1 to
Oct. 1 would produce $7.4 billion in fiscal
year 1982 and about $1 billion in 1983. Post
ponement of the 1983 rate cut for three
months would raise the revenue savings in
1983 to $8.3 billion to add $0.7 billion in
1984.
As alternatives to making new and deeper
cuts in such programs as food stamps, health
services, Amtrak and school lunches, the
excise tax increases and postponement of
the individual rate cuts are politically attrac
tive.
Sinai settlers protest treaty
Jerusalem — Following the assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, militant
Jewish settlers in the occupied northern Si
nai Peninsula have vowed to accelerate
their campaign to force the Israeli govern
ment to abrogate the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty and cancel the scheduled April 26
withdrawal from the Sinai.
The settlers warned that the political in
stability of Egypt, as evidenced by the as
sassination and the rise of violent Islamic
fundamentalism, makes it imperative for Is
rael to stop the withdrawal and retain at
least part of the strategic depth of the Sinai.
"I firmly believe there will be no evac
uation of the area next April. The situation is
too unstable," said Uri Elitzur, secretary of
the Stop the Withdrawal from Sinai move
ment, which says it has collected 300,000 sig
natures to a petition favoring abrogation of
the treaty. The group says its goal is a million
names, nearly one-third of Israel's popu
lation.
Ella Weizman, a spokeswoman for the
movement in Sadot, in northern Sinai, said,
"We've always asked what if something
happens to Sadat. How can Israel rely on the
treaty if it doesn't know who is going to be
in charge in Egypt from one day to the
next?"
While the Stop the Withdrawal move
ment respresents, so far, a minority within
Israel, Sadat's assassination has presented
Prime Minister Menachem Begin with new
complications in his plans for orderly com
pliance with the terms of the peace treaty.
Reagan delays gas bill
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
yesterday postponed for "an indefinite
time" the expected request that Congress
approve deregulation of natural gas prices
over a three-year period.

After Reagan met with his Cabinet Coun
cil on Natural Resources, Energy Secretary
James Edwards said that the group had again
unanimously recommended deregulation
but that action was not taken because of the
"timing" involved. Edwards would not be
explicit, saying only that the president "may
want to get his economic policy package
out of the way" before sending his de
regulation proposal to Capitol Hill.
Some officials at the Department of
Energy had been telling interested parties,
including representatives of natural gas
producers, that deregulation would be pro
posed yesterday. A spokesman for the Natu
ral Gas Supply Association, a producers'
group, said they were "disappointed and
disturbed" by the delay, calling it"a grave
mistake."
Under terms of the Natural Gas Policy Act
now in effect, the wellhead price of newly
discovered natural gas will be deregulated
after 1985. About half of the gas then being
produced, however, would remain subject
to controls indefinitely. Advocates say de
regulation would encourage the search for
more gas and conservation by gas users.
Economists are uncertain how much aver
age wellhead prices would rise, but most ex
pect them at least to double, adding many
billions of dollars to gas users' costs.
O'Connor skirts conflict
Washington — In the first week of her first
term on the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra
O'Connor has disqualified herself from
more than one-fourth of the court's hear
ings because of conflict-of-interest prob
lems.
These disqualifications provide the first
sign that O'Connor — like Justice Lewis
Powell Jr. and her predecessor, former Jus
tice Potter Stewart — may often feel obliged
to remove herself from Supreme Court
cases to avoid the appearance of conflicts of
interest.
The justices have taken up 11 cases this
week. In three of them, lawyers presented
their arguments to an eight-member Su
preme Court, with O'Connor's seat on the
bench vacant. Two of the cases involved in
surance companies; the third was an impor
tant test of the federal laws that apply to po
litical action committees.
O'Connor confirmed through an aide
that she had felt she was compelled by the
federal conflict-of-interest law to step aside
in these cases. But she declined to explain
what specific interests she had, financial or
otherwise, that led her to disqualify herself.
"It is the court's tradition not to explain
why justices disqualify themselves. She will
follow this tradition," Supreme Court pub
lic information officer Barrett McGum said.
A 1974 law requires federal judges to dis
qualify themselves from cases in which they
have any financial interest, no matter how
insignificant the interest might be. In addi
tion, judges are legally obliged to step aside
if they believe they are so closely connected
to one of the parties or attorneys that it
would be improper for them to participate.
In past years, the two justices who most
frequently disqualified themselves were
Powell and Stewart, the two wealthiest
members of the court. Many of the cases
from which they stepped aside involved

firms in which they had financial holdings.
Powell also disqualified himself from cases
involving partners or clients of his former
Richmond, Virginia, law firm.
