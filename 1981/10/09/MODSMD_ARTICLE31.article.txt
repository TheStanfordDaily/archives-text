Corrections
In the Guaranteed Student Loan
story which ran on Monday, some
points need to be clarified: GSL ori
gination fees apply to all loans de
livered on or after Aug. 24,1981, rath
er than Sept. 1; the limit fora student
with an independent tax status is
$2500 after Oct. 1; it is no longer nec
essary fora notary public to sign the
Pell grant forms; and student sum
mer income expectations vary by
grade level. The Daily regrets the er
rors.
