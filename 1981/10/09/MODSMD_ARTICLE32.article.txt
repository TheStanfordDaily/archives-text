## Cards face UCLA Bruins in 2nd Pac-10 matchup 
### Mike Oneal 
Had Joe Stanford Fan pulled a four-week Rip
Van Winkle act starting Sept. 11, he would have
woken up today and immediately looked for
some more elf potion. That is, if the news of his
beloved team's pitfalls didn't render him co
matose right off the bat.
Lest we forget, Stanford was, not too long ago,
ranked among the Top-20 teams in the nation.
The Cards were No. 16 Sept. 11. They also had
the most highly regarded offense in the nation
that day with two Heisman Trophy candidates in
their backfield.
Today, the campus joke is that Stanford, now
0-4, is holding strong among the nation's Bot
tom-20 and the oft-maligned Stanford defense is
outshining the offense in every way short of the
kicking game.
And the fog comes in on little Bruin feet.
Stanford faces a 3-1 UCLA team tomorrow
that's only blemish is a 20-7 loss to lowa Sept. 26.
It is rated No. 17. The Bruins crushed Wisconsin
(the team that dethroned Michigan the first
weekend of the season), beat Colorado and ran
up over 500 offensive yards en route to their
35-18 stinging of Arizona. Stanford scratched out
only 266 yards in their 17-13 loss to the Wildcats.
"UCLA is a big, physical football team," Stan
ford head coach Paul Wiggin said. "They gener
ate a lot of offense. With the exception of the
lowa game, they have been a dominant football
team. Their defense will also present problems
for us."
The Bruin defenders are led by nose guard
Karl Morgan and All-Pac-10 tackle Irv Eatman up
front and Don Rodgers, Tom Sullivan and Jimmy
Turner in the secondary. Morgan has has 23
tackles, Eatman, 14 with five pass delections,
Rodgers, 30, Sullivan, 28 with three interceptions
and Turner has 25 tackles.
That's the wall Stanford has to throw its limp
ing offense against — one in which halfback
Darrin Nelson has been the lone bright spot.
Nelson had 93 yards rushing and 28 yards on
four receptions last week in Tuscon setting
himself up to re-write some records tomorrow.
He now needs only three receptions to break
the all time Pacific-10 conference career receiv

ing record and only 44 yards to move past O.J.
Simpson into fourth place on the Pac-10 career
rushing chart.
Heisman Trophy nominee John Elway and the
Stanford passing attack are another question.
The junior quarterback is completing 56.3 per
cent of his passes but hit on only 14 of 34 passes
for 152 yards against Arizona. He had five in
terceptions in the second half against San Jose
State.
His leading receivers, Vincent White and
Nelson, are both out of the backfield which
gives an indication of how many long balls the
Cards have been throwing. Junior flanker Mike
Tolliver is third with 14 receptions for 271 yards
and one touchdown, but the Stanford attack has
not had the multi-faceted punch it had last year
or any of the last four years. The attack has de
generated into something almost unknown on
the Farm in recent memory: predictability.
Stanford has to throw the ball this week if it
wants to win; not to Darrin Nelson and Vincent
White, but to wide receivers Tollliver, Don Lons
inger and Eric Mullins. The Cards' offense must
pass this week to set up the run, not run to set up
the pass.
"For us to get better," Wiggin said, "our re
ceivers have to do a better job of getting open.
Our offensive people are talented but inex
perienced, particularly our wide receivers."
The Bruin offense is led by Darrin's brother
Kevin Nelson at tailback. The 5-10, 190 pound
sophmore has 365 yards so far this season fora
UCLA offense which averages 361 yards and 25
points a game. Quarterback Tom Ramsey is
completing 58 percent of his passes throwing to
tight end Tom Ramsey (14 rec.,185 yds., 3 TDs)
and wide receivers Jojo Townsell (9 rec., 143
yds.) and Cormac Carney (9 rec., 128 yds., 2TDs).
CARDINAL NOTES
— Stanford's offense has scored only 57 points
this season, the lowest output since 1967 when
the Cards tallied 56 points in its opening four
games.. .The lasf time Stanford had a losing sea
son was in 1967 when the Cards went 3-7.. .Split
end Andre Tyler, who has not played this season
due to a fractured foot, will not play tomorrow
and may not start against USC.


THE LITTLEST JUNIOR — Darrin Nelson isn't Junior any
more. His younger brother Kevin, a UCLA tailback, in
tends to make his presence known to his older brother
tommorow when the Cards meet the Bruins. The iunior

Debbie Zeitman/Daily
junior has amassed 365 yards so far this season, but he will
nave to bo some to top Darrin's act: the senior Junior
needs only three receptions to break the Pacific-10 all
time career receiving record.
