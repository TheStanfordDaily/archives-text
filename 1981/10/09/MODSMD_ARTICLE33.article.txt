# Host Invitational
## Harriers race at home 
### Dick Hodge 
As the Stanford football team
prepares to battle the UCLA
Bruins, the men's and women's
cross country teams will be
hosting the Stanford Cross
Country Invitational Meet
tomorrow morning at the Stan
ford golf course.
Both races boast strong fields
to challenge the Card runners,
who will be competing at
home for the first time this sea
son. Neither team has been de
feated yet.
After a convincing win at the
Cal Invitational last week, the
women runners will be pres
sured by formidable squads
from Oregon, UCLA, Idaho,
Washington, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, UC-lrvine, and eight
other universities.
Stanford coach Brooks John
son said that his runners have
been easing up their training,
"doing less mileage this week
than at anytime this season."
The team deserves a break in
training after performances
strong enough in their first two
meets to rank them in the Top

Five nationally.
"We've started our move
toward qualifying for the na
tional championships Novem
ber 9," said Johnson. "We feel
we have a team that could go to
the nationals and challenge for
the title."
The men's team showed that
it is a force to be reckoned with
by winning the Fresno Cham
pionships two weeks ago. Head
coach Mike Tomasello expects
"a very good year" for his
runners.
"We've been working pretty
hard since running camp
before school started up until
now. I think the big question is
how well we will run this
course for the first time," he
said.
Tomasello claims that this
years' team will be both men
tally and physically tougher
than last years'.
"This team has made two big
improvements over the last
year," he explained. "First of
all, the overall attitude is better
in that the runners really have
respect for each other and

work well together. Secondly,
each person has dedicated
himself to getting stronger
through our new program of
weight lifting. In addition,
almost everyone has returned
from last year."
The men, led by seniors Jim
Smith, Rod Berry, and Tom
O'Neil, will need all their
strength and experience to
handle the opposition. Defen
ding Pacific-10 conference
champion UCLA, ranked fifth
nationally, No. 13 ranked Colo
rado, and an experienced Cal
team top a substantial field of
over 20 teams.
Tomasello said that most of
the NCAA Division II schools in
the Western states will attend,
including perennial pow
erhouse Cal-Poly SLO and de
fending national champion
Humboldt State.
Running unattached in the
meet will be star Robin
Campbell of the Stanford Track
Club in the women's division,
and past Stanford greats Dun
can McDonald and Roy Kissin
in the men's.
