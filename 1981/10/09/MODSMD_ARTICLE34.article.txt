# Could tie it up tonight
## A's lead K.C. Royals 2-0 into 3rd 
### 
Oakland (AP) — The Kan
sas City Royals, who ended
the five-year reign of
Charlie Finley's Oakland A's
by becoming American
League West champions in
1976, may lose that title to
the new A's tonight.
These are Billy Martin's
Oakland A's, the team
which began baseball's first
season of 1981 by going 11-0
in April and, in the current
third season, has a 2-0 lead
over Kansas City in the best
of-five AL West playoff.
"We haven't won any
thing yet. We'll go out Fri
day night like it was the first
game," said Martin, the
manager whose team won
4-0 and 2-1 in Tuesday and
Wednesday games in Kansas
City as Mike Norris and
Steve McCatty turned in
strong pitching per

formances.
When Martin was hired
by Finley to manage the A's
last season, the problem he
faced was the opposite of
overconfidence. The young
team had finished last in
1979, but it was second to
Kansas City in 1980 and set
attendance records this year
while posting the league's
best over-all record.
"I may have to think
about giving my manager a
raise," said Martin who, un
der the new ownership of
the Walter Haas family, also
serves as A's general man
ager.
"The A's are good, but
they're not kicking us
around. I imagine they feel
good, but they haven't put
us away yet," said Royals
Manager Dick Howser.
Right-hander Rick
Langford, 11-8 this year, will

be on the mound as the A's
try to put the Royals away in
playoff game No. 3. The
Royals will counter with
left-hander Larry Gura, 11-8.
If there is a fourth game,
the Royals are expected to
use first-game starter Den
nis Leonard against the A's
Matt Keough on Saturday.
In 1976, when the Royals
edged the A's in the AL West
race, Gura beat the A's 4-0
with a four-hitter in late
September for the most im
portant victory of Kansas
City's first title season. But
last Sunday in Kansas City,
the A's beat Gura and
forced the Royals into the
annoyance of a one-day
road trip to Cleveland,
where they won a makeup
game to clinch the second
season division title.
This will be the Royals'

second one-game trip of the
week if the A's right-handed
hitting lineup roughs up
Gura and Langford, who
won at Kansas City last Sat
urday.
Tony Armas, one of the
league's top right-handed
hitters, had a 4-for-4 per
formance with two runs
batted in Wednesday
before leaving the game
with a pulled groin muscle.
But he's expected to be in
right field for the A's Friday
night.
The A's have 18 hits to the
Royals' 10 so far in the series,
and Howser's team has left
16 runners on base. The
Kansas City hitters are de
scribing it as a slump at the
worst possible time.
"What makes a slump?
Good pitching makes a
slump, doesn't it?" the A's
McCatty said.
