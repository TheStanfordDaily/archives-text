# UCLA invades Farm
## Booters host Bruins 
### Adam Berns 
After posting impressive
wins over No. 1 ranked Univer
sity of Connecticut and a scary
Air Force team last weekend,
the Stanford soccer team will
host a powerful UCLA squad
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. on
Harry Maloney field.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge feels that the game is
very important. In past years,
the Cardinals have had a dif
ficult time defeating the
Bruins.
"We've never beaten UCLA
in the six years I've been here,"
noted Lodge, "however, most
of the games have have been
extremely close."
Coming off last week's
thriller over U Conn could set
the Cards up for an emotional
letdown this week, but Lodge
seems confident that it won't
happen.
"UCLA is an excellent team
and they were ranked 10th in
the nation before losing to Bos
ton College and Rhode Island

on a tough Eastern road trip.
Our team realizes this, and
we'll be ready for the game Sat
urday," he said.
Lodge also recognizes the
fact that the Bruins have been
scouting Stanford in an effort
to befM«epared for tomorrows'
doesn't, however,
feel that it should affect the
Cardinal game plan at all.
"We have to go out and play
our game. Tenacity is the key.
We have to go out there and set
the tone of the game," he said
flatly.
The Cardinals' strengths this
year lie in their defense, quick
counters, speed, and agression
getting to the ball. It was this
style of play that keyed the up
set of Connecticut last week.
Lodge said that in order to win
tomorrow, it will have to con
tinue.
When asked if there are any
players he is counting on this
week, he prefered not tosingle
out individuals. "It's a total
team effort. We're counting on

everyone."
Consistency has always been
a problem for any Cardinal
team, no matter what sport.
Lodge stated that in order for
his team to have a great season,
consistency in playing to their
full potential each week will be
the key.
"Consistency is what we are
working on," he added. "To
win, they will have to work
hard no matter who they are
playing. We're trying to solve
the consistency problem by
making them work hard in
practice."
Tomorrow's game should
provide a true test of the
Cardinals' ability to play con
sistently good soccer. Finally,
as Lodge said succinctly, "In or
der to beat UCLA were going
to have to play them like we
played Connecticut last week
end."
A difficult task, but last week
they proved they have the abil
ity to beat anyone.
