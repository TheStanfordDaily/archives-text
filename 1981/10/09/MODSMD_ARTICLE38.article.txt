## Major League roundup 
### 
Milwaukee (AP) — Lou
Piniella lined a fourth-inning
homer and Reggie Jackson
added a two-run blast in the
ninth, leading New York to a
3-0 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers yesterday as the Yan
kees took a 2-0 lead in the
American League East Division
championship series.
The Yankees, the division's
first-half champions during the
unique split-season, can sweep
the best-of-5 series by winning
in New York tonight.
Dave Righetti, a hard-throw
ing, 22-year-old rookie left
hander, earned the victory by
allowing four hits and striking
out 10 through the first six in
nings. Ron Davis started the
seventh and loaded the bases
before ace reliever Rich
Gossage came in and got the
final two outs in the inning.
Piniella's homer came off
loser Mike Caldwell, named
the Brewers' starting pitcher

slightly more than an hour
before game time. Pete
Vuckovich, the scheduled
starter and the Brewers' ace
with a 14-4 record, came down
with a 103-degree fever yester
day and was being treated for
flu symptoms.
Montreal (AP) — Gary
Carter's two-run homer in the
third inning triggered the
Montreal Expos to a 3-1 victory
over the Philadelphia Phillies
last night and gave them a 2-0
lead in their best-of-five series
for the National League East
Division title.
The teams left this chilly city
after the game for Philadel
phia, where the defending
World Series champions will
send right-hander Larry Chris
tenson against Ray Burris today
in an effort to prevent elimina
tion.
Right-hander Bill Gullickson
blanked the Phillies on three
hits through the first seven in
nings and was credited with the

victory although he needed
help the last two innings from
reliever Jeff Reardon, who also
saved Wednesday's opening
triumph.
The Phillies have now lost
seven straight games at Mont
real.
Los Angeles (AP) — The re
mainder of the National
League's West Division playoffs
will be held, starting today, at a
site where the Houston Astros
have had more than their share
of problems the past two years,
but it's the Los Angeles
Dodgers who are in trouble
now.
However, if ever a team has
reason to be optimistic down
2-0 in a best-of-five series, it's
the Dodgers.
A little over a year ago at this
time, the Astros came to
Dodger Stadium fora three
game series to complete the
regular season. Houston
brought a three-game lead
