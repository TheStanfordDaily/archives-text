# Andretti bumped to 2nd
## Indy 500 given to Unser 
### 
Indiananapolis (AP) — Bob
by Unser illegally passed cars
during a yellow caution period
in last May's Indianapolis 500,
but he was declared the winner
over Mario Andretti yesterday
after a special U.S. Auto Club
appeal panel ruled a one-lap
penalty was improperly
assessed after the race.
The penalty against Unser
"should have been called dur
ing the race. If any other con
clusion were reached, the of
ficiating of an event such as this
would be nothing short of
chaotic," panel chairman
Edwin Render wrote in a 23-
page opinion released at USAC
headquarters.
Unser beat Andretti across
the finish linebyeightseconds,
but the penalty cost Unser one

lap and dropped him to second
place when the official stand
ings were posted the day after
the May 24 race.
Unser protested the USAC
decision, and the three-mem
ber panel conducted hearings
on the appeal during June and
July.
Unser, elk hunting in
northern New Mexico when
the panel's ruling was an
nounced, told his car owner,
Roger Penske, that he was "ex
tremely happy to become the
sixth three-time winner of the
world's greatest race. This has
been a goal for me since I
began competing at Indian
apolis in 1963."
Andretti, at his office in Naz
areth, Pa., said the reversal was
"stunning" and that he was

"just too sick to even think
about it."
Andretti, who won the Indy
race in 1969, said, "I'll never be
able to swallow this. It's totally
unjust, it really is."
Render, a University of Lou
isville law professor, and
former USAC President Rey
nold Mac Donald signed the
majority opinion which made
Unser the winner of the 500 for
the third time and, at age 47,
the oldest Indy champion in
history.
Another panel member,
former USAC President Charlie
Brockman, dissented, saying if
the penalty was imposed dur
ing the race, chief steward Tom
Binford would have been "act
ing on incomplete and in
conclusive information.
