# Stanford blazing technology trails

With the creation in 1984 of the
Center for Integrated Systems, Stan
ford's position as the nation's leading
university in Integrated Circuit (IC)
research will be even stronger.
That's the belief of Electrical Engi
neering Prof. James Meindl, who
foresees a technological boom last
ing until the year 2000.
Recently developed IC technolo
gy, according to Meindl, is especially
promising in various medical applica
tions, including the electronics
which translate ultrasonic echoes
into a readable image.
Another research project involves
programming a computer with all the
data relevant to the design of ICs. In
effect, then, a computer could de
sign another computer, with help
from the operator.
Electronic devices to improve the
lives of the handicapped are also on
the horizon.
A device to help blind people read
is one such project. The machine will
photograph a character from a
printed word, then reproduce the
letter by selectively vibrating a fin
gertip-size array of bristles to pro
duce the shape of the letter.
Refinements of the hearing aid are
also in the works. A new device
would process auditory signals into

electrical signals in a computer, and
then transmit those signals by radio
to a small electronic implant behind
the ear. The electronic implant
would stimulate the auditory nerve
in much the same manner as a nor
mal ear.
Currently, this new hearing system
requires a computer the size of a
briefcase, but Meindl spoke op
timistically of the day when "we will
get it as small as a pocket calculator."
A pocket gas chromatograph is
also being developed here. This de
vice analyzes the chemical makeup
of air, and could be worn by workers
in a potentially dangerous environ
ment to warn them of harmful com
pounds in the air.
The advantage of a portable
chromatograph, unlike previous
chromatographs, is that each worker
could be monitored for exposure to
harmful substances at any time.
How does the University manage
to do so well in making these small
devices possible? The answer may lie
in Stanford's ability to design and
build its own ICs, Meindl said.
"If I had to build a reading aid us
ing only commercial chips," he said,
"it might end up about the size of a
desk. But designing our own, it
comes out more the size of a book on
.e desk."
