# All but football, men's basketball free
## No charge for most sports events

Take off your hats and fling
them in the air, let out a cheer
and charge towardsthe playing
fields, because the student
body just regained one of its
more valuable posessions:
Stanford athletics.
As of this season, all regular
intercollegiate Stanford sport
ing events, with the exception
of football and men's basket
ball, will be free of charge. That
means tennis, women's basket
ball, water polo, soccer.
It means no more $1.50 fora
baseball game, which was
tough when it was a late-season
series against Arizona State and
you really wanted to see all
three, but you needed the

money for the gas-eating
Chevy.
The only requirement these
days is a current Stanford iden
tification card.
The new Athletic Depart
ment policy is geared primarily
toward Stanford students, fac
ulty and staff. The reasoning
behind it, according the pro
grams' mastermind, athletic di
rector Andy Geiger, is very
simple: to promote and in
terest in and attendance to
Stanford sporting events.
"It's just something I wanted
to do," Geiger said. "I think the
students should be able to
watch their classmates com
pete. There are some very tal
ented people out there doing

some very unique things."
To introduce the student
body to the policy, the depart
ment has planned Stanford Fall
Sports Day for tomorrow. It in
cludes raffles for prizes at the
cross country Invitational, to
be held at the Stanford golf
course, the men's soccer game
vs. UCLA at Maloney field, the
water polo game vs. UCLA, and
the women's field hockey
game against Cal at Roble
Field.
Tickets can be obtained
before the events, and the
drawings will be held im
mediately afterwards.
And it's all FREE.
More on the financial front,

the Great Race IV will be held
Sunday to finance the women's
athletic scholarship fund.
The race will start and finish
at the Stanford Barn office of
Western Federal Savings, spon
sors of the event. Among the
participants in the 10 kilometer
race will be former Olympic
champion and defending title
holder Duncan McDonald,
who won last year's event over
2,300 competitors in 28:58.
The grand prize for the male
and female winners is round
trip air fare to the Hawaiian
Marathon. Registration will be
from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m., and the
race starts promptly at 9.
