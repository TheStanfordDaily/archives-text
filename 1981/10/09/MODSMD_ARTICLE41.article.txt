## Card poloists face Irvine, UCLA 
### Chris Addington 
The Stanford water polo
team will put its No.l rank
ing on the line this weekend
at deGuerre pool when the
Cardinals go up against UC-
Irvine today at 3 p.m., and
UCLA tomorrow at 10:30
a.m.. Stanford, coming off
three tournament victories,
will face its toughest com
petition yet against the two
schools from Southern Cali
fornia.
The No. 2 ranked Irvine
Anteaters have consistently
been among Stanfords' rch
rivals. In addition, Irvine was
one of only two teams that
defeated the Cardinals last
year."

Paced by John Vargas and
left-hander Diggy Reilly, the
Anteaters resemble the
Cards in their ability to fast
break, and their help-back
defense. The young but ex
perienced team gave the
undefeated Cards their
closest match of the season
thus far four weeks ago, at
the UC-lrvine tourney
when they came within
three goals but lost 8-5.
The No. 3 ranked UCLA
Bruins always seem to fire
up when they make the trip
North to Stanford. In 1979
the Bruins had the distinc
tion of snapping the Cards'
41-home-game winning
streak. In that match the

UCLA players went so far as
to shave their bodies to gain
extra speed and mental
psych.
UCLA, which has con
sistently improved its pro
gram over the last few years,
is led by 6-foot-6 hole man
Vince Tonne. The Bruins are
another fast-breaking team,
but their power lies in an ex
cellent driving offense.
Stanford and UCLA met
once previously this year,
with the Cards coming out
on top 10-6.
Stanford goes into these
confrontations with some
amazing statistics. The 15-0
Cardinals are led by seniors

Jody Campbell (30 goals)
Alan Mouchawar (26 goals),
Chris Kelsey (21 goals) and
junior James Bergeson (29
goals).
Aside from their perfect
record, the Cardinals have
averaged 14 goals per game
to their opponents' 4, and
outscored the opposition
109-18 in first halves.
Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti has prom
ised that "this will be a great
weekend to watch water
polo and see the three top
teams in the nation at
work."
Admission to both
matches is free of charge.
