Columbus, Ga. (AP) — De
fending champion Mike Sul
livan, tour veteran George
Burns and little-known George
Johnson, each fired 4-under
par 66 yesterday to share the
first-round lead of the $200,000
Southern Open golf tour
nament.
One shot back at 67 was Pe
ter Oosterhuis, Payne Stewart,
Peter Jacobsen, J.C. Sead and
Mike Holland.
Another shot back at6Bwasa
group led by Calvin Peete,
John Cook Vance Heafner and
Jim Barber.
Sullivan, whose only victory
in five years on the Tour was
here last year, shot a solid
round which included birdies
of 20, 6, 4 and 3 feet, and 14
pars.
Burns, who is No. 36 on the
money list with nearly $100,000,
had six birdies and two bogeys

on the par-70,6791-yard Green
Island Country Club course.
Rain fell for the first four hours
yesterday and the temperature
never climbed above the 50s.
Johnson, 42, lost his playing
card because of poor play in
1979 and has been involved in a
mini-tour in Florida. The Co
lumbus native, who was a cad
dy at a local club, had to qualify
on Friday for this event.
He went on a birdie binge on
his back nine, getting four
without a bogey to finish with
six and two bogeys in his
round.
Trailing by 3 shots were Bob
Murphy, Andy Bean, making
his first start in more than five
months after suffering a hand
injury, Jim Dent, Jay Haas and
Lyn Lott.
Two-time winner here Jerry
Pate, who is No. 7 on the mon
ey list, headed a group at par7o
that also included Chi Chi

Rodriguez, Dave Eichelberger
and George Archer.
Johnny Miller, Ed Fiori,
Hubert Green and Forrest
Fezler, all previous winners
here, headed a group of 28
players at 71.
Former PGA champion John
Mahaffey was at 72 while
Arnold Palmer shot a 74 and
was in danger of missing the
cut today.
Sullivan, who ranks 57th on
the money list with just under
$72,000, admits he has been
struggling this year.
"The whole year has really
been a struggle. I've had swing
problems," he said.
Sullivan said he went to
teaching pro Peter Kostis on
Monday in Pinehurst, N.C. and
"he made some suggestions
about my swing.
"It seemed to alleviate the
problem," said Sullivan. "So far
it's working pretty good."
