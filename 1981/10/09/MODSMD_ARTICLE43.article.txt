# Restaurants
## A 						medley of top restaurants from the Daily jukebox 
### 
For those newcomers who
may need an idea of where to
eat and for those oldtimers
who may need to refresh their
memories, here is a collection
of condensed reviews based
largely on full critiques that
have appeared in the Daily.
The following
that have met strict standards
of excellence in the eyes and
on the tongues of our re
viewers who took into account
not only food, but presenta
tion, service and ambience as
well. Prices are only approx
imate, and are included only as
a rough guide.
LA TOUR
University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on University and Cowper is La
Tour. Many claim that it is the
best restaurant on the Peninsu
la, and they are probably right.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning, and
perfectly complements the del
icacy of the food.
As an hors d'oeuvre, Pate of
La Tour terrine maison ($4.25)
and Guilette d'huitres au Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered. Bisque Be Homard
(lobster bisque $4.25) is truly
exceptional. Elegant French
style beans and a nicely broiled
tomato give a colorful and tex
tural balance to the presenta
tion of this dish.
A good cross-section of des
seits includes hot or cold Souf
fle au Grand Marnier, straw
berries, hot apple tart, mousse
au chocolat and selected
cheeses.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere be
tween a French country inn
and an exclusive British club.
You can relax in a pampered
world of starched linen, fresh
flowers, candlelight and wine.
Not that the food isn't good —

it is, but it's the ambience, not
the cuisine, that /ou'll re
member.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks,
seafood and daily specials such
as Chicken Curacao ($8.50) and
Veal Oscar ($12.50). Scandina
vian Koltbords - a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($14.50 for
two; $7.25 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
A wide variety of excellent
desserts are also available.
MADDALENA'S CONTINEN
TAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Boasting a growing, devoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a
must for any French or Italian
gourmet, or anyone else for
that matterl
Maddalena's offers a con
tinental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise.
The übundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers:
Cannelloni Florentine ($7.95),
Fettucine alfredo ($7.95) and al
pesto ($7.95), among others.
Maddalena's a la carte salads
such as spinach ($4.25),
mushroom ($6.50), Caesar
($4.25 per person) and Butter
Lettuce with Seafood ($5.75)
are excellent.
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($11.95) and Sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($13.95)
to Chicken Saute Sec ($10.75).
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too
does Maddalena's decor — soft
blue walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers, a truly aesthetic ex
perience.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisines, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan

ford people because it com
bines uncommonly good ser
vice with some of the best Chi
nese cooking in the area.
One shouldn't miss the Mu
Shu Pork, which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied, with more than 150 a la
carte items for lunch and din
ner; one can't go wrong with
any of their "specialties." And
if there's a dish not on the
menu, Chu will prepare it spe
cially if you give him a call and
ask.
Prices are not cheap, about
$8 to $13 a person, but it is
money well spent. The decor is
virtually non-existent, but
there is always an abundance
of happy faces feasting away.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
The sign in front says: Lunch,
Dinner, Whiskey, and indeed
Henry's offers the ideal blend
of casual dinng and a com
fortable bar. The well-pre
pared food, the bar, and the
convenient downtown loca
tion make Henry's a popular
place in Palo Alto.
Henry's specialties are veal
and fish, with most prices in the
$9 to $11 range. Recom
mended dishes are the Esca
lope of Veal with Tarragon
($10.95) and the Emince of Veal
Zurichoise ($10.50). The fish
selections are brought in fresh
from various parts of the coun
try, and are also highly recom
mended.
While the restaurant stops
serving food at 10 p.m., the bar
is open all week long until 2
a.m. On Wednesday, Thursday
and Saturday nights there is pi
ano entertainment providing
primarily background music to
the delicious dining and drink
ing.
CAFE BORRONE
2022 Broadway
Redwood City
368-7085
The menu here offers a con
tinental array of dishes such as

port-flavored cheese ap
petizers, chicken liver hors
d'oeuvres, variety salads,
baguettes, Italian tortas that re
semble fresh vegetable frit
tatas, extraordinary quiche and
apple cognac cake. Truly this
coffee house and wine bar
meet premium standards, even
though nothing on the menu
exceeds $7.95.
Roy Borrone, the owner,
recommends sharing dishes
and disapproves of.more tradi
tional dining in his cafe. And
this,place is ideal for food and
wine "samplers" who dine by
tasting a bit of everything or
dered. (Wines can be tasted for

$2 to $3.25 per long-stemmed
glass.)
Highly recommended are
the coffee concoctions, — im
aginative desserts themselves
— such as the Cafe Orgeat ("an
espresso, essence of almond
and steamed milk sprinkled
with crushed toasted almonds
in a large-mouth glass"), or the
Capuccino San Francisco.
The Cafe Borrone's coffee
house/wine bar ambience en
courages customers to sit and
relax while sharing fine cuisine
and good spirits.
LE POT AU FEU
1149 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
322-4343
Le Pot au Feu provides what
one would imagine France has
to offer — if one hadn't been
there. But, this is by no means
an insult. The decor could be
described as "Late Eclectic" or
maybe even "Friendly Clutter"

due to its variety, but it is not
overdone. The ambience is
very friendly and easy-going.
As for the food, it is definitely
French, ranging from its rich,
tasty pea soup, to its light, per
fectly prepared salmon en
croute, or Beef Wellington.
The chef has specials every day
which are well worth trying.
The accessories are also very
good. The salad, although
simple, has a wonderfully nut
ty-flavored dressing. And
pastries are light and tasty.
The service is by no means
Gallic, but it does adopt the
best points of California friend
liness, while still remaining

quite professional.
Prices hover around $35 to
$40 a couple, including wine,
and is most definitely money
well spent.
THE GOOD EARTH
185 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth on Univer
sity Avenue provides a unique
variety of natural food dishes
served in a comfortable dining
atmosphere.
The restaurant's use of only
choice ingredients has not lim
ited its selection of meals, but
on the contrary has opened up
a creative array of dishes — ev
erything from omelettes to
tostadas; and from salads to
shakes.
Hot and cold sandwiches,
soups, salads, and meat, vege
table, shrimp and chicken en
trees, are among the menu
selections for lunch and din

ner. In addition, six types of
fruit and yogurt shakes, daily
baked pastries and assorted
desserts are available to those
with a sweet tooth.
Green ferns hang lazily over
the tables against a back
ground of wood panelled
walls, creating a relaxed and
easy-going atmosphere.
The prices appear to be
somewhat reasonable with
possible exceptions in the en
tree section. Prices run about
$3 to $5 for salads, and $5 to $8
for entrees.
LA CUMBRE
No. 2 Stanford Shopping Cen
ter
Palo Alto
326-0636
La Cumbre is the kind of
place offering the agreeable
combination of economy,
large portions and good ser
vice. Their daily specials, for
example, usually run from $5 to
$7 and often include an ap
petizer, soup or salad, dessert
and sometimes a complemen
tary drink.
Complete meals range be
tween $6 and $10 and come
with either soup or salad. One
recommended choice is the
chimichanga, at $5.95 being a
good meal for all but the most
voracious eater. For the really
hungry, we recommend a
combination plate including
refried beans, two beef
enchiladas and two tacos.
When this is served as a special,
you get the above plus an ap
petizer, dessert and margarita
for just $6.95 — certainly one of
the best food bargains in the
area.
La Cumbre provides a good
place to enjoy a decent meal
without sacrificing your bank
account. It certainly merits a
visit.
RAMONA'S
541 Ramona St.
Palo Alto
326-2220
*
Few people question the fact
that Ramona's makes some of
the best pizza near campus. It
offers pizzas in an amazing
number of varieties, all of
which are smothered in a gen

erous amount of cheese and
the desired toppings. Having
eaten there many times I can't
remember having a pizza that
was less than very good (that is
true for the Calzone, whole
wheat crust filled with a de
licious combination of
mozzarella cheese, tomato
sauce, linguica, Italian sausage,
mushrooms and onions, as
well).
Prices run from about $4 fora
small pizza with tomato and
cheese, to about $13 fora fully
loaded 16 incher. The portions
at these prices represent ex
cellent value.
The restaurant's problems lie
in its popularity. There is
almost always a 20 to 30 minute
wait, and never enough room
to sit down while waiting.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGOLI
AN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cuisine.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars)
are in fora new treat — an en
tire barl
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including
shredded carrots, onions,
celery, cabbage, bean sprouts
and cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot, and extra hot are offeied,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and casu
al, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no
one spoke English very well.
Colonel Lee's might be just the
ticket if you are looking for
something truly unusual.
