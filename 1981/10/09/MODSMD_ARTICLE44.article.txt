# 'Here it is!' An Italian aria with rhythm and class...

ECCO Palo Alto
4290 El Camino Real 493-0800
ECCOI It means "here it is" in Italian. And here in Palo
Alto is an amazing Italian restaurant. Many people have
probably first noticed the Hyatt Palo Alto as we did; the
Las Vegas-looking place with the white statues in the
driveway. Well, the statues are gone, and evidently the
remodeling was done inside and out, for ECCO and the
Tempo lounge just opened a year and a half ago.
We were early for our reservation and went first into
Tempo. Comfortable chairs and wonderfully plush love
seats await here, along with an unusual party mix in glass
jars on the tables — cracker bits, peanuts in a cookie-like
shell, and many other difficult to describe goodies.
Warning: these are very addicting. The drinks are not
cheap, $1.75 fora glass of wine, $2.95 fora strawberry
dacquiri. This last though was one of the best we have
had, very fruity, thick, and not overly sweet.
The restaurant itself, however, is the truly special part.
It is surrounded by frosted etched glass panels, with
many lush plants, and done overall in pretty green tones.
Seating is a combination of round tables with wicker
chairs, and many circular booths. We were seated in one
of these booths and were quite pleased and com
fortable,. Almost immediately two smiling young people
introduced themselves as Molly and Cole, our waiting

team for the night.
The menu is a la carte; this is not one of those seven
course family style Italian restaurants. Several appetizers
are offered, including antipasto ($2.95), as well as soup,
both a soup of the day and Minestrone ($1.50, $1.75), and
a salad ($2.95) served at your table.
The remainder of the menu consists of pasta, pizza,
and meat and seafood dishes. The pasta and pizza are
both made from scratch at a pasta bar in the center of the
restaurant. t
As we wanted to sample both this pasta and the more
traditional entrees, I ordered the Fettucini Ecco ($8.95) at
our waitress's suggestion, and my friend chose the Veal
Marsala ($12.95).
Other selections included the Pizza ($6.95 for one,
$12.95 for two), which we were told was excellent, six
other pastas ($6.95-$8.95), with either green or white
noodles, and intriguing preparations of a dozen varying
meats and fish, including stuffed calamari ($8.50) and
duckling di tullio ($11.95).
We had also chosen a bottle of wine, a white Italian
Fontina Candida ($9), and found even the wme opener
to be special. A contraption called a Bacchus, it stood
about four feet high on three legs. Our waitress, who
seemed to be really enjoying her work, explained to us
the operation of this device.
Then the salad arrived. House salads tend to be a plate

of lettuce, with perhaps one other vegetable or a tomato
slice thrown in. Not at ECCO. Molly wheeled out a
wooden cart with a bowl of lettuce in the center, and
side compartments of broccoli, cauliflower, mozzarella,
mushrooms, prosciutto, homemade croutons, and a few
other things. Asking before she added each item, she
tossed it all together with dressing and presented a huge
plate to me. As a final touch, salad forks are kept chilled
in a glass bowl with crushed ice, surrounded by carna
tions. It was definitely one of my more memorable
salads.
The soup arrived shortly after, and it was quite good,
though a bit of a letdown after the salad preparation.
Our waiter, however, returned with a hand-held gadget
containing a block of parmesan cheese, which he grated
over the soup. Another special touch!
With these openers came a skillet of bread, sourdough
garlic on one side, pizza bread (the same base with
tomato sauce and cheese) on the other. It was delicious.
The entrees didn't deviate from this general ex
cellence. The veal was well-cooked, tender, and served
in a light but stiil tasty sauce. It wasaccompanied by crisp
ly cooked fresh vegetables, which made fora colorfully
attractive plate. The Fettuccini, which was a huge portion
(if you choose this dish as an appetizer, split it, at least
two ways), was equally well presented. Fresh green
noodles were topped with sauteed tomato wedges and

mushrooms, ham livers, and several large prawns. The
fresh parmesan cheese was offered again too. It was a
wonderful dish. Even the noodles themselves had a good
flavor; they were miles above the average bland store
bought pasta. We were told the fettuccini was very popu
lar, and I would unhesitatingly recommend it.
We had planned on ordering dessert, but were unsure
of being able to eat it. Our approaching waiter heard us
discussing splitting something, and offered that he had
just the thing. We trusted his judgment, and were glad
we did. He brought us each a small glass platecontaining
one cannoli, a rolled pastry shell filled with sweetened
cheeses (ricotta and cream) and chocolate chips, capped
with cheeries, and dusted with powdered sugar ($2.25
for two). They were almost too rich but delicious.
We were completely charmed by ECCO. The at
mosphere was casual; customers dressed in everything
from shorts (hotel guests') to semi-formal attire. The
food was delicious and presented with as much flair and
imagination as I've ever seen. On top of it all, our waiting
team managed to combine first name familiarity with re
ally good, caring service; we never had to wait long for
anything. An evening with "the works" there will cost
over $30 though you could spend less), but it will be
worth it, and probably be an evening to remember. It
was for us.

cellence. The veal was well-cooked, tender, and served
in a light but stiil tasty sauce. It wasaccompanied by crisp
ly cooked fresh vegetables, which made fora colorfully
attractive plate. The Fettuccini, which was a huge portion
(if you choose this dish as an appetizer, split it, at least
two ways), was equally well presented. Fresh green
noodles were topped with sauteed tomato wedges and

mushrooms, ham livers, and several large prawns. The
fresh parmesan cheese was offered again too. It was a
wonderful dish. Even the noodles themselves had a good
flavor; they were miles above the average bland store
bought pasta. We were told the fettuccini was very popu
lar, and I would unhesitatingly recommend it.
We had planned on ordering dessert, but were unsure
of being able to eat it. Our approaching waiter heard us
discussing splitting something, and offered that he had
just the thing. We trusted his judgment, and were glad
we did. He brought us each a small glass platecontaining
one cannoli, a rolled pastry shell filled with sweetened
cheeses (ricotta and cream) and chocolate chips, capped
with cheeries, and dusted with powdered sugar ($2.25
for two). They were almost too rich but delicious.
We were completely charmed by ECCO. The at
mosphere was casual; customers dressed in everything
from shorts (hotel guests') to semi-formal attire. The
food was delicious and presented with as much flair and
imagination as I've ever seen. On top of it all, our waiting
team managed to combine first name familiarity with re
ally good, caring service; we never had to wait long for
anything. An evening with "the works" there will cost
over $30 though you could spend less), but it will be
worth it, and probably be an evening to remember. It
was for us.
ECCO Palo Alto
4290 El Camino Real 493-0800
ECCOI It means "here it is" in Italian. And here in Palo
Alto is an amazing Italian restaurant. Many people have
probably first noticed the Hyatt Palo Alto as we did; the
Las Vegas-looking place with the white statues in the
driveway. Well, the statues are gone, and evidently the
remodeling was done inside and out, for ECCO and the
Tempo lounge just opened a year and a half ago.
We were early for our reservation and went first into
Tempo. Comfortable chairs and wonderfully plush love
seats await here, along with an unusual party mix in glass
jars on the tables — cracker bits, peanuts in a cookie-like
shell, and many other difficult to describe goodies.
Warning: these are very addicting. The drinks are not
cheap, $1.75 fora glass of wine, $2.95 fora strawberry
dacquiri. This last though was one of the best we have
had, very fruity, thick, and not overly sweet.
The restaurant itself, however, is the truly special part.
It is surrounded by frosted etched glass panels, with
many lush plants, and done overall in pretty green tones.
Seating is a combination of round tables with wicker
chairs, and many circular booths. We were seated in one
of these booths and were quite pleased and com
fortable,. Almost immediately two smiling young people
introduced themselves as Molly and Cole, our waiting

team for the night.
The menu is a la carte; this is not one of those seven
course family style Italian restaurants. Several appetizers
are offered, including antipasto ($2.95), as well as soup,
both a soup of the day and Minestrone ($1.50, $1.75), and
a salad ($2.95) served at your table.
The remainder of the menu consists of pasta, pizza,
and meat and seafood dishes. The pasta and pizza are
both made from scratch at a pasta bar in the center of the
restaurant. t
As we wanted to sample both this pasta and the more
traditional entrees, I ordered the Fettucini Ecco ($8.95) at
our waitress's suggestion, and my friend chose the Veal
Marsala ($12.95).
Other selections included the Pizza ($6.95 for one,
$12.95 for two), which we were told was excellent, six
other pastas ($6.95-$8.95), with either green or white
noodles, and intriguing preparations of a dozen varying
meats and fish, including stuffed calamari ($8.50) and
duckling di tullio ($11.95).
We had also chosen a bottle of wine, a white Italian
Fontina Candida ($9), and found even the wme opener
to be special. A contraption called a Bacchus, it stood
about four feet high on three legs. Our waitress, who
seemed to be really enjoying her work, explained to us
the operation of this device.
Then the salad arrived. House salads tend to be a plate

of lettuce, with perhaps one other vegetable or a tomato
slice thrown in. Not at ECCO. Molly wheeled out a
wooden cart with a bowl of lettuce in the center, and
side compartments of broccoli, cauliflower, mozzarella,
mushrooms, prosciutto, homemade croutons, and a few
other things. Asking before she added each item, she
tossed it all together with dressing and presented a huge
plate to me. As a final touch, salad forks are kept chilled
in a glass bowl with crushed ice, surrounded by carna
tions. It was definitely one of my more memorable
salads.
The soup arrived shortly after, and it was quite good,
though a bit of a letdown after the salad preparation.
Our waiter, however, returned with a hand-held gadget
containing a block of parmesan cheese, which he grated
over the soup. Another special touch!
With these openers came a skillet of bread, sourdough
garlic on one side, pizza bread (the same base with
tomato sauce and cheese) on the other. It was delicious.
