So you've decided to expand your palette's horizons
.. . now what? Saying farewell to dorm food is a start, and
the next step may be trying an exotic meal at the Nataraja
restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.
Don't expect incense or waitresses in saris; the at
mosphere is really nothing to write home about. But the
food here is. Exquisitely blended spices from cardamom
to mustard seed make each dish an unforgettable adven
ture.
We chose the Nataraja dinner for two (includes ev
erything but beverages, and is pretty reasonable at
$27.95) in order to sample a variety of dishes "arranged in
perfect culinary order." The meal began with soup, and
we tried the Nataraja's two savory selections: tamatar, a
deliciously spicy tomato/clove concoction, and
mulligatawny, a lemony cream of chicken that was also
excellent. Accompanying the soup was a basket of thin,
crispy bread called papad, which we polished off in a
hurry.
Course two was salad, with a choice of two variations
of raita (yogurt salad) or a green salad. We opted for the
raita, and enjoyed both the very sweet banana/coconut
flavor and the tangier cucumber version as well.
Following the salads, we were served a small basket of
batter-dipped, deep-fried vegetables called pakora,
(listed on the menu as an appetizer). By candlelight we
found it a bit difficult to discern which vegetables were

which, but found them quite good nevertheless — espe
cially when enhanced by the three different chutneys we
were given to add to the intriguing variety of flavors.
For the main course we were given a choice of any two
curries; we selected the chicken and the vegetable varie
ties. (Lamb and beef curries are also available.) The small
dish of vegetable curry was a bit disappointing — the
mixed vegetables seemed soggy from too much cook
ing, and the sauce was rather mild (although curries may
be requested mild, medium or hot). The chicken curry
was a far better choice, with a much zestier sauce and
two medium-sized pieces of chicken.

Exquisitely blended spices make
each dish an unforgettable
adventure.

Kashimiri rice, an orange-flavored rice covered with
fruit and nuts, was served with the curries along with an
other basket of the papad. The sweetness of the rice nice
ly complemented the curries, and again the chutneys
proved pleasantly spicy condiments.
Our desserts brought the meal to a satisfying close: we
tried kulfi, a pistachio-flavored sherbet (rather more like
ice-milk) sprinkled with cardamom, and coconut
halawa, a square piece of very sweet, chewy candy.
As for beverages, we tasted the house blend of tea — a
cinnamony Darjeeling — which we found strong and

often a bit more than our taste buds'could stand when
accompanying the meal. We did consume a tremendouj
amount of ice water (continuously replenished by our
busperson) which was a welcome palette cleanser at all
times.
Adjoining the restaurant is Rudyard's Pub (same
owners), and on a busy night, customers are invited to
play darts in the bar while waiting fora table. Drinks are
available before, during and after your meal.
The Nataraja's menu remains true to its ethnic focus —
no hamburgers or french fries to be foundl — so you
must be a daring gourmet with an eagerness to explore
new tastes. We found the endless array of unusual spices
and varied textures (especially the soup, ra/ta and papad
) combined to make the entire meal a truly unique ex :
perience for our palettes.
Fora delightfully exotic and very satisfying meal, din
ner at the Nataraja is an experience your dorm-weary
taste buds are sure to appreciate.

dish of vegetable curry was a bit disappointing — the
mixed vegetables seemed soggy from too much cook
ing, and the sauce was rather mild (although curries may
be requested mild, medium or hot). The chicken curry
was a far better choice, with a much zestier sauce and
two medium-sized pieces of chicken.

Exquisitely blended spices make
each dish an unforgettable
adventure.

Kashimiri rice, an orange-flavored rice covered with
fruit and nuts, was served with the curries along with an
other basket of the papad. The sweetness of the rice nice
ly complemented the curries, and again the chutneys
proved pleasantly spicy condiments.
Our desserts brought the meal to a satisfying close: we
tried kulfi, a pistachio-flavored sherbet (rather more like
ice-milk) sprinkled with cardamom, and coconut
halawa, a square piece of very sweet, chewy candy.
As for beverages, we tasted the house blend of tea — a
cinnamony Darjeeling — which we found strong and

often a bit more than our taste buds'could stand when
accompanying the meal. We did consume a tremendouj
amount of ice water (continuously replenished by our
busperson) which was a welcome palette cleanser at all
times.
Adjoining the restaurant is Rudyard's Pub (same
owners), and on a busy night, customers are invited to
play darts in the bar while waiting fora table. Drinks are
available before, during and after your meal.
The Nataraja's menu remains true to its ethnic focus —
no hamburgers or french fries to be foundl — so you
must be a daring gourmet with an eagerness to explore
new tastes. We found the endless array of unusual spices
and varied textures (especially the soup, ra/ta and papad
) combined to make the entire meal a truly unique ex :
perience for our palettes.
Fora delightfully exotic and very satisfying meal, din
ner at the Nataraja is an experience your dorm-weary
taste buds are sure to appreciate.
