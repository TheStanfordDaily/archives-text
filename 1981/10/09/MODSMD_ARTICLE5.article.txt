# Officials outline end to spraying
## 
### Mike Thurman 
While announcing that malathion
spraying will cease over 410 square
miles of the Bay Area, officials from
the California Mediterranean Fruit
Fly Eradication Project yesterday said
spraying would continue for at least
four more weeks in the Stanford
area.
However, Jasper Ridge, the Uni
versity's wildlife conservation area
located in a separate spraying cor
ridor from the main campus, is
among the zones in which the treat
ment program is being discontinued.
The decision to halt spraying was
announced by Dr. James Brazell, a
U.S. Department of Agriculture
Medfly specialist and chairperson of
the committee, at a Los Gatos meet
ing with 150 citizens present.
Spraying will be halted only in
those areas where treatment pro
gram requirements have been met,
about 40 percent of the infested area.
The committee also recommended
terminating the program on "an on
going basis" as other areas meet the
spraying guidelines.
Contrary to a project spokes
person's report printed in yesterday's
Daily, Corridor Six, the 43.2 square
mile zone that makes up Stanford,
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Woods
ide, is among the areas that have not
met the treatment requirements.
The treatment plan requires that
malathion be applied over targeted
areas fora period of two Medfly life
cycles. (The expected life of a Medfly
is approximately six weeks.)
As a result of an Aug. 13 larvae find
in Woodside, Corridor Six must still
be treated at least four more times
until the 12-week treatment require
ment has been met. As long as there
are no further Medfly finds in the lo
cal area, spraying here should cease
by early November.
Countdown
Thus, local residents would not
have to endure periodic aerial
sprayings in the winter and early
spring as will the citizens of some Bay

Area communities.
Explained Brazell, "The areas that
got started first are going to finish
first. However, the countdown be
gins from the last detection in the
area."
Project Director Jerry Scribner
made two other important Medfly
announcements during the meeting.
Other announcements
The first disclosure was that anoth
er egg-bearing female Medfly was
discovered early yesterday morning
in the Castro Valley area in the East
Bay. A corridor area was established
around the new find, and malathion
treatment will begin there in several
days.
Scribner also announced that the
deaths of 2000 to 3000 fish in Mission
Creek near Fremont over the week
end were attributable to malathion
spraying. Accordingto a project
spokesman, the deaths apparently
were caused after the insecticide was
carried to the creek through local
drainage. This marks the third time in
recent months that fish deaths have
been linked to the malathion spray
program.
Among the areas that will no long
er be sprayed are Corridor Eight,
which includes Portola Valley, Jasper
Ridge and the portion of Los Altos
Hills that lies west of Interstate 280,
and much of Corridor Seven, an area
that lies between Menlo Park and San
Carlos, bounded by Highway 101 to
the east, and Interstate 280 to the
west. Other completed areas include
parts of Santa Clara and San Jose.
Most of these were either outlying
areas which originally had been in
cluded in the project as buffer zones
without actually containing Medfly
finds, or areas which have received
treatment since the beginning of the
project last July and have had no
further Medfly discoveries.
The committee addressed itself to
six points,ranging from treatment fol
low up techniques to spot-checking
motorists who cross toll bridges near
the infested area.
The committee recommended
that special attention be paid to
gathering regular samples of treated
areas using baited Medfly traps.
Traps defended
Responding to the charge that the
traps are not effective in locating the
Medfly, Brazell said, "We feel that
traps as presently used are adequate,
but they must be used as directed."
Brazell said the committee is call
ing for the use of 50 traps per square
mile for follow up tests. He also in
formed the project administrators of
current research in Hawaii focused
on developing special dry weather
traps which may alleviate the failure
of traps due to the drying out of baits.
With the approach of colder
weather which will affect the repro
ductive and life cycles of the Medfly,
the committee made specific recom
mendations with regard to winter
spraying. Citing the fact that Medfly
females have a reproductive
threshhold at an air temperature of
61.9 degrees, the project will base its
determination of when to spray on a
principle called "degree-day ac
cumulation."
Under this principle, the female
Medfly reproductive system does not
mature in colder weather, and
spraying is theoretically not neces
sary if air temperatures do not rise
above 61.9 degrees. Officials will use
a formula measuring daily high air
temperatures over a 40-day period to
determine when the Medfly winter
cycle begins and ends.
Despite the use of the complicated
"degree-day accumulation meth
od," committee members con
cerned with the possibility of failure
decided also to recommend that a re
duced spray schedule continue to be
followed through the winter. Thus,
those areas which have not com
pleted the treatment program by the
beginning of winter (as calculated by
the "degree-day accumulation
method") will undergo spraying
once every three to four weeks until
the arrival of spring has been de
termined.
In the words of one committee
member, "We've been burned by
the best scientific evidence available
in the past. This is the one (geograph
ical) areawhere the model always
seems to break down."
On the question of whether vehi
cles entering or leaving the area via
bridges should be stopped and in
spected for infested fruit, the com
mittee decided that "the probability
of the presence of larvae in fruit in
transit is too low to justify the costs
and hazards associated with such
