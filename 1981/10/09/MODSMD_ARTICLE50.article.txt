To Catch a Thief ****
Festival Cinema Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock vacations
with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly
on the Riviera, and To Catch a
Thief is his postcard to all of us
who couldn't come along. It's a
summertime thriller, relying less
on suspense than on good spirits
to make its impact. Grant plays a
reformed cat burglar forced to
protect his good name when an
other thief begins to employ his
methods for high-class crime.
Kelly plays an heiress whose jew
elry collection makes her a prime
target. Ice-beautiful, she seduces
Grant over a picnic lunch of
chicken, asking cooly, "Will you
have a leg or a breast?"
Plays through Wednesday with
Trouble in Paradise.

Pygmalion ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Shaw himself wrote the
screenplay to this fine movie ver
sion of his play. Leslie Howard
plays Henry Higgins as a roman
tic, devotedly scientific but still
caught up in the wonder of his
experiment. Wendy Hiller makes
a perfect Eliza Doolittle, who
goes from guttersnipe to lady by
being given the gift of good
grammar. She's utterly captivat
ing. Other actresses have played
Eliza as if her early coarseness was
part of a rather cruel burlesaue
act. Hitler, though sacrificing
none of Eliza's humor/ gives her
an intelligence and strength that
even epic mispronunciation can
not betray.
Howard and Anthony Asquith
share the direction credit. Plays
Sunday- only with The Im
portance of Being Earnest.

The Importance of Being
Earnest ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The title is a pun, as is virtually
every line in this lush (almost ov
erstuffed) mounting of the Oscar
Wilde play. Anthony Asquith,
who made a career out of trans
ferring the classic and the near
classic to the screen, directed.
Here, Asquith plays up the stagi
ness of his movie, which begins
with the curtain going up on the
play. The device isn't as distract
ing as it might seem — one senses
that, "opened up" cinematically,
the brittle charm of a Wilde play
might crumple into dust. Micnael
Redrave, Edith Evans, and Joan
Greenwood, who has a wonder
ful, purring voice, star.
Plays Sunday only with
Pygmalion.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman
Guild, Menfo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa

tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Arthur *+*
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies tnat were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting ana dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
Best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.
— J.M.
Raiders of the Lost Ark +*
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

The Postman Always Rings
Twice **
Mountain View Theater
The newest version of James
M. Cain's taut, mean little pot
boiler, starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange, has a convinc
ing period look, and the director,
Bob Rafelson, has done a good
job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you
take away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
Playing with First Monday in
October.

An American Werewolf in
London **
Old Mill, Mountain, View
David Naughton and Griffin
Dunne give pleasing per
formances as a p?ir of Jewish boys
from Long Island whose firendly
banter continues even after a
werewolf attack turns Naughton
into the next werewolf gener
ation and Jack into the undead.
John Landis' movie is cheerfully
adolescent, but whenever he has
to focus on the horror film plot,
he loses his style. The picture is a
series of gags, some of the
moronic, a number of them clev
er, none of them inspired.

Clash of the Titans ***
Fox, Redwood City
The acting is wooden and the
mythology suspect, but the spe
cial effects, and the set pieces in
volving them, are often magical.
They were created by Ray Har
ryhausen, the man who did the
effects' for Jason and the
Argonauts. Harryhausen is the
cinema's greatest practitioner of
stop-motion animation, the same
technique that made the eight
een-inch high King Kong threat
en New York. Harrynausen's
puppet characters in Clash of the
Titans include a flying horse and,
most spectacularly, a Medusa
that would do any monster
maker proud. This movie should
be great for kids: it's heroic and
not too violent.
Plays Sunday only with
Caveman.
— J.M.
Atlantic City
Fox, Redwood City
in the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older build
ings — remnants of a past gran
deur and a more recent decay —
tumble to the ground. In the vi
sion of director Louis Malle and
screenwriter John Guare, the en
vironmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change
that has seized the lives of the
people of the city. Atlantic City's
people try with varying degrees
of success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note.
It is possible, we see, for some
people to adjust to new condi
tions and to make a new life out
of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives. The film features

fine performances by Burt Lan
caster, Susan Sarandon, and Kate
Reid.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Pretty Baby.
— Vince Waldman
Mommie Dearest *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.
— S.V.
Eye of the Needle **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Richard Marquand directed
this adaptation or the Ken Follett
novel. Marquand isn't a very
good director — in fact, his han
dling of the "action" pieces
(these tending toward stabbing*
and hackings) makes him seem

borderline incompetent. Donald
Sutherland and Kate Nelligan
star. Sutherland plays a Nazi spy
who could be a brother to the
Nazi the actor played in 7900; he
does it very well, but no amount
of talent could make the charac
ter particularly interesting. Kate
Nelligan plays the Englishwoman
who falls in love with him. Her
part is nearly as poorly written,
and she has to participate in all of
the hokier elements of the plot
(which attempts to one-up Wait
Until Dark and fails). But Nelligan
manages to make her character
come alive; we actually like the
woman she portrays. She may be
the only human being in the mov
ie. One can only hope that her
next film finds her among some
others.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Day of the Jackal, directed
by Fred Zinnemann.

King of Hearts ***
Fox, Redwood CHy
This enormously popular anti
war comedy is probably over
rated; it sometimes gets a little
too wrapped up in the wonder of
its own whimsy for comfort. But,
admitting that, it's still difficult to
resist Alan Bates as a World War I
soldier who, upon entering an
abandoned village, discovers that
it is still inhabitated by the resi
dent's of the town's lunatic asy
lum. Bates falls in love with the
completely looney but still very
charming Genevieve Bujold,and,
after an initial period of adjust
ment, they live happily ever after.
Phillipe De Broca directed.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Where's Poppa?
— J.M.
Ordinary People **
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truths about eacn other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
a family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
nis airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life
right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
" Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.
— Ron lillejord
Yoiimbo
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Pauline Kael calls this the "first
great shaggy-man movie." A
swordsman comes into a vio
lence-prone village (he is greeted
with tne sight of a dog happily
trotting around with a dismem
bered hand in its mouth) and
cheerfully helps the two warring
factions wipe themselves out.
Akira Kurosawa, whose most re
cent film is Kagemusha, directed;
Toshiro Mifune plays the
swordsman.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Kurasawa's Sanjuro.

S 0.8. *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, wnich deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the
only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston as a
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill
ing to Rive up any method of
makinglife more comfortable.
Starts next Thursday, with
Network.

Stevie **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The film deals with the life of
Stevie Smith, a poet of middle
class English suburbia and a per
sonal hero for producer/star
Glenda Jackson. "She is one of
our greatest writers." Jackson has
said about her. "She knew that
the real drama of life is lived on a
relatively minute scale."
Besides the timidity of Smith's
character and her colorless life
there is the additional problem of
turning into a film what was ori
ginally a play with the same cast
— Jackson as Stevie and Mona
Washbourne as Lion Aunt. Un
fortunately the film does not live
up to the challenge, despite the
brilliant performances by both
Jackson and Washbourne. It is
not much more than a play on the
screen.
In spite of its faults, Jackson
almost succeeds in convincing
you to like the film — if you drop
your guard, you probably will.
— Jiri Weiss
Dirty Harry^A.
Friday, Kresee Auditorium
A tnorougnly repulsive movie
in which a cop (Clint Eastwood)
skips due process of law to nail a
psychotic who he just knows is
guilty. We know it, too, because
the director, Don Siegel, makes
sure to place us securely on
Harry's side; we're supposed to
cheer when hetortures the crimi
nal in the climactic scene. A good
case could be made for Dirty
Harry as the most fascist Ameri
can movie ever made.
— S.V.
Gallipoli
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more hign
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem Is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.
