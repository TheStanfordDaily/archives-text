# Unexploded bombs plague post-war Laos
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Unexploded hidden bombs and
devastated agricultural !-;.J are
among the many problems from the
war era which still plague Laos, one
of the world's poorest nations's, said
Jacqui Chagnon and Roger Runpf at
a slide show presentation yesterday
at the Bechtel International Center.
Changnon and Runpf have recent
ly returned from three years of work
ing for the American Friends Service
Committee in Laos in various de
velopment projects, which included
the formation of a mechanical train
ing school, the construction of sever
al irrigation projects and a study to
determine the most efficient way of
locating and deactivating small anti
personnel bombs.
During the presentation, Chagnon
and Runpf showed slides of the three
main ethnic groups of Laos: the low
land Lao, the high-land Lao and the
mid-land Lao.
Also shown in the presentation
were slides of recent victims of anti
personnel bombs. These bombs,
dropped by U.S. pilots during the war
era still injure and kill a considerable
number of people each year, accord
ing to Runpf.
"The government of the U.S-won't
help deactivate these bombs because
they say it's politically sensitive,"
Runpf said.
Meanwhile, the American Friends
Service Committee as well as other
relief organizations are searching for
some way to deactivate the bombs
"that's not so expensive or techno
logically advanced that the Lao can't
do it themselves," according to
Chagnon.
Parts of Laos contain some of the
most heavily bombed pieces of land
in the history of the world, Chagnon
said. "In Xiemg Khouaeng province
over two tons of bombs were
dropped per resident," she added.
The devastation of these areas has
slowed the growth of Laotian agricul
ture although progress has been
made to the point where Laos is self
sufficient in rice, according to
Chagnon. But Laos has virtually no
manufacturing industry, she added.
Another problem left from the war
was the relocation of 700,000 refu
gees, or approximately one-quarter
of the nation's populations, said
Chagnon.

Health and education are two
""--j wnere Laos is facing urgent
problems. Before 1975 only 40 per
cent of the population was literate,
but since then a government spon
sored program has brought that fig
ure up to 80 percent, Chagnon said.
A great need still exists in the area of
adult education she said.
"Almost everyone in Laos is a
farmer, and you can't run a family
farm or a cooperative without at least
knowing basic math," she added.
Medical care is very primitive in
Laos because there is an extreme
shortage of medicine and doctors
there. Chagnon said that in an at
tempt to deal with the shortge of
qualified doctors, the government is
encouraging traditional village medi
cine.
Village life in Laos centers around
the pagoda because Buddhism con
tinues to thrive under the socialist
government, according to Chagnon.
The monk often acts as the main doc
tor, psychiatrist and psychologist of
the village, she added. Cultural life
revolves around the many festivals
associated with the different phases
of growing rice.
Before 1975, a large portion of the
Laotian government's budget was
supplied by the United States, but af
ter the victory of the Socialists in Laos
and the Communists in Vietnam, the
U.S. Congress passed a law prohibit
ing direct aid to both nations, Runpf
said. This loss of aid has created prob
lems for the Laotian people who had
become used to the high standard of
living and now have to settle for less,
he added.
About 40,000 Vietnamese troups
are currently stationed in Laos and
are an important influence on Lao
tian defense but have limited in
fluence in other areas, Chagnon said.
"Most of the time we saw Vietnam
ese troops they were working on
roads and irrigation projects," she
said. "We never once dealt with a
Vietnamese advisor."
Chagnon said she was told by one
official of the Laotian government
that during the American days ev
erything was done by Americans.
Now we do everything ourselves."
Although the Laotian government
is stable now it may be challenged in
the future by a Chinese-traded Lao-
tian army of 5000 to 6000 men which
is located near the Laotian-Chinese
border, Runpf said.
There is still a small amount of re
sistance to the government from the
remnants of an army formerly
backed by the Central Intelligence
Agency, according to Runpf.
The presentation was co-spon
sored by the San Francisco regional
office of the American Friends Ser
vice Committee, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center and Volunteers in Asia.

fluence in other areas, Chagnon said.
"Most of the time we saw Vietnam
ese troops they were working on
roads and irrigation projects," she
said. "We never once dealt with a
Vietnamese advisor."
Chagnon said she was told by one
official of the Laotian government
that during the American days ev
erything was done by Americans.
Now we do everything ourselves."
Although the Laotian government
is stable now it may be challenged in
the future by a Chinese-traded Lao-
tian army of 5000 to 6000 men which
is located near the Laotian-Chinese
border, Runpf said.
There is still a small amount of re
sistance to the government from the
remnants of an army formerly
backed by the Central Intelligence
Agency, according to Runpf.
The presentation was co-spon
sored by the San Francisco regional
office of the American Friends Ser
vice Committee, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center and Volunteers in Asia.
Unexploded hidden bombs and
devastated agricultural !-;.J are
among the many problems from the
war era which still plague Laos, one
of the world's poorest nations's, said
Jacqui Chagnon and Roger Runpf at
a slide show presentation yesterday
at the Bechtel International Center.
Changnon and Runpf have recent
ly returned from three years of work
ing for the American Friends Service
Committee in Laos in various de
velopment projects, which included
the formation of a mechanical train
ing school, the construction of sever
al irrigation projects and a study to
determine the most efficient way of
locating and deactivating small anti
personnel bombs.
During the presentation, Chagnon
and Runpf showed slides of the three
main ethnic groups of Laos: the low
land Lao, the high-land Lao and the
mid-land Lao.
Also shown in the presentation
were slides of recent victims of anti
personnel bombs. These bombs,
dropped by U.S. pilots during the war
era still injure and kill a considerable
number of people each year, accord
ing to Runpf.
"The government of the U.S-won't
help deactivate these bombs because
they say it's politically sensitive,"
Runpf said.
Meanwhile, the American Friends
Service Committee as well as other
relief organizations are searching for
some way to deactivate the bombs
"that's not so expensive or techno
logically advanced that the Lao can't
do it themselves," according to
Chagnon.
Parts of Laos contain some of the
most heavily bombed pieces of land
in the history of the world, Chagnon
said. "In Xiemg Khouaeng province
over two tons of bombs were
dropped per resident," she added.
The devastation of these areas has
slowed the growth of Laotian agricul
ture although progress has been
made to the point where Laos is self
sufficient in rice, according to
Chagnon. But Laos has virtually no
manufacturing industry, she added.
Another problem left from the war
was the relocation of 700,000 refu
gees, or approximately one-quarter
of the nation's populations, said
Chagnon.

Health and education are two
""--j wnere Laos is facing urgent
problems. Before 1975 only 40 per
cent of the population was literate,
but since then a government spon
sored program has brought that fig
ure up to 80 percent, Chagnon said.
A great need still exists in the area of
adult education she said.
"Almost everyone in Laos is a
farmer, and you can't run a family
farm or a cooperative without at least
knowing basic math," she added.
Medical care is very primitive in
Laos because there is an extreme
shortage of medicine and doctors
there. Chagnon said that in an at
tempt to deal with the shortge of
qualified doctors, the government is
encouraging traditional village medi
cine.
Village life in Laos centers around
the pagoda because Buddhism con
tinues to thrive under the socialist
government, according to Chagnon.
The monk often acts as the main doc
tor, psychiatrist and psychologist of
the village, she added. Cultural life
revolves around the many festivals
associated with the different phases
of growing rice.
Before 1975, a large portion of the
Laotian government's budget was
supplied by the United States, but af
ter the victory of the Socialists in Laos
and the Communists in Vietnam, the
U.S. Congress passed a law prohibit
ing direct aid to both nations, Runpf
said. This loss of aid has created prob
lems for the Laotian people who had
become used to the high standard of
living and now have to settle for less,
he added.
About 40,000 Vietnamese troups
are currently stationed in Laos and
are an important influence on Lao
tian defense but have limited in
fluence in other areas, Chagnon said.
