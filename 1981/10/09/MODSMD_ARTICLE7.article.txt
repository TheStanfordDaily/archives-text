## Taiwanese say torture killed professor; blame government-backed crackdown 
### Los Angeles Times 
Taipei, Taiwan — Dead three months
but still unburied, Chen Wen-cheng is
haunting Taiwanese politics, and his family
and friends say that his spirit will not rest
until justice is done.
Chen's battered body was found outside
the research library of the National Taiwan
University here just after dawn on July 3.
The police said that Chen, a 31-year-old
specialist in economic statistics and an as
sistant professor at Pittsburgh's Carnegie-
Mellon University, committed suicide by
jumping from the library fire escape be
cause he feared imprisonment for anti
government political activities.

'We have all become rather cautious about what we say
and do in this campaign. Too critical a comment, too
fiery a speech, a rally that gets out of hand, and I could
disappear. Perhaps I would be tried for sedition and
jailed for 12 or 15 years, or I might just turn up dead/
— Taiwanese opposition politician

Cause of death disputed
"He was guilty and he knew it,"a top of
ficial of the Taiwan Garrison Command
said when Chen's body was found. "We
had interrogated him, and he had con
fessed. He probably was afraid of arrest."
Chen's wife says flatly that he was
murdered, and she alleges it was probably
done by members of the Garrison Com
mand or Taiwan's other security services.
And many other people here believe,
despite government denials, that Chen
was indeed murdered — more as a lesson
to others on the limits of political dissent
than for his relatively minor role in the op
position Taiwan independence movement
in'the United States.
'Political martyr'?
An anti-government activist said. "He is
clearly a political martyr. His murder was
meant to intimidate us."
The current election campaign for mu
nicipal and county offices is more sub
dued, according to political observers, and
opposition leaders are more guarded in
tneir criticism of the government and the
ruling Nationalist Party.

Cautious
"We have all become rather cautious
about what we say and do in this cam
paign," an opposition politician from the
southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung said,
asking as others did tnat he not be quoted
by name. "Too critical a comment, too
fierv a speech, a rally that gets out of hand,
ana I could disappear. Perhaps I would be
tried for sedition and jailed for 12 or 15
years, or I might just turn up dead."
That has raised major questions about
the Nationalist Party's avowed goals of
broadening its base and bringing its critics
into the political system — two reforms
that are regarded as essential as power

passes to a new generation of leaders.
"For nearly three years now, we have
been trying to open the political process,
to involve more people, to make it more
representative and thus ensure its stability
and continuation," one of the new "young
guard" Nationalist officials in Taipei said.
"I don't know how Chen died, but I do
know that his death is undoing much of
what we achieved so far."
Generation tension
Tension between such young reformers,
ment and party, and the older generation
of Nationalist leaders is now as much a fac
tor in Taiwan politics as the demand of
native Taiwanese, about 85 percent of the
population, fora share in the political
power that those who came from the main
land with the late President Chiang Kai
shek have held almost exclusively since
1949.
Chen, a native Taiwanese who left six
years ago to study and teach in the United
States, was not a major figure in theTaiwan
independence movement, which wants to

oust the Nationalist Chinese regime and
make the island a sovereign state. Friends
here say he had contacts in "Formosa Mag
azine Group," eight of whom were jailed
on sedition charges last year.
After returning in May with his wife and
year-old son, Chen was picked up for
questioning on june 30 and then again on
July 2, when he was held for 12 1 /2 hours by
the Taiwan Garrison Command, a military
security organization.
Interrogation
The Garrison Command said that Chen
confessed under interrogation, reportedly
when confronted with information
gathered secretly by Taiwan intelligence
agents on his activities in the United States.
After his body was found, with 13 bro
ken ribs, his back broken in three places, a
cracked hip and extensive internal injuries
and hemorrhaging, the Garrison Com
mand said that he must have committed
suicide by jumping 44 feet from the uni
versity library fire escape.
When protests mounted here and in the
United States, another investigation was
ordered, and the cause of death now is
listed as either suicide or accident, with the
case officially still open.
Unexplained injuries on the body in
clude four puncture wounds in the kid
neys, more than 20 needle marks in the left
elbow and extensive bleeding under the
fingernails, his family says.
Investigations
Chen's case is similar to others in
vestigated by Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights group, which
says in a 20-page report that it was told of
dissidents undergoing extensive torture,
including beatings, deprivation of sleep
and electrical shocks, during interrogation
by the Garrison Command.
Amnesty International also reported
that 115 long-term political prisoners,
some jailed in the early 19505, are currently
held on Green Island off Taiwan's south
east coast.
The publisher of a number of political
magazines that were banned last year
agreed with Amnesty's findings and said,
"Chen is only one of more than 70 persons
by my count who have been jailed or killed
in the past two years for their political ac
tivities."
