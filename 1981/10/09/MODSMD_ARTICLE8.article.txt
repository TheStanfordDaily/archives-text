# U.S. fears weak ness as Belize gains sovereignty
## 
### Washington Post 
Belize City, Belize — The recent independ
ence of this small Central American state,
granted by Britain last month, has brought
new security worries to Washington with the
Reagan administration apparently fearing
that the new nation could become another
"springboard for revolutionary activities" in
the convulsed region.
While informal conversations have already
been held, in the coming weeks the United
States and Belize are expected to begin for
mal talks about U.S. security assistance, in
volving both military training and equipment
sales, sources from both governments said.
British officials here say there is no need for
any great security flap in Belize. They argue
the country is too much out of the way, the
terrain is too difficult and Guatemala has
enough jungle of its own to serve as guerrilla
hideouts.
Peaceful democracy
The peaceful democracy of 145,000 people
lies beneath part of the vast rain forest that
covers much of northern Central America,
and it could, according to U.S. security ex
perts, easily be turned into a guerrilla hideout
and clandestine arms route. Revolutionary
wars are going on in neighboring Guatemala
and in El Salvador.
Top British officials here declined to spell
out how long their 1800 men stationed in
Belize will remain. One option, Belize of
ficials say, is a British-U.S. agreement to keep
London's troops here until Guatemala
emerges from its rapidly escalating civil war.
Another would be to seek a joint defense
force, against Guatemala's threat as well as
against guerrilla incursions, put together by
members of the Commonwealth.
The Belizeans say they are aware the tur
moil around them could easily force them
from London's arms into Washington's. "We
would accept U.S. equipment and training
abroad," said one senior official, "but the
thinking in the government is that we don't
want U.S. military advisers stationed here."
Don't want a military
"We like to think of ourselves as a little Cos
ta Rica or a little Switzerland without an
army," said a Cabinet minister.
At the same time, Guatemala's rightist mili

tary regime continues to assert its long
standing claim over the territory. Even on in
dependence day, Sept. 21, as five heads of
state and government and dozens of other
foreign envoys were attending the ceremo
nies here, Guatemala sent a military plane
strafing the border. In response, one of Brit
ain's jet fighters, stationed here to defend
Belize, scrambled and showed its guns along
the same route.
But from the point of view of Washington,
which hopes to dissuade Guatemala from
doing anything more than just snarl at Belize,
the danger lies on the left. Both the U.S. and
Guatemalan governments share the fear that
a helpless Belize may, even unwillingly, be
used as a haven for Guatemalan guerrillas and
Cuban arms deliveries.
The British exit comes at a time when the
United States perceives a heightened security
interest in the Caribbean basin. "The irony is
that the government most interested in hav
ing the British stay is the U.S. It cannot simply
put troops here as a buffer the way London
has," one Western analyst here said.
Brits say no infiltration
Quoting CIA sources, American press re
ports recently claimed that weapons were al
ready passing through Belize for El Salvador's
insurgency as a result of U.S. pressure to cut
down the flow via Nicaragua. Buta top British
official here emphatically denied this, saying
"there is not a shred of evidence" to support
such a claim.
U.S. arming Guatemala
In the area, Washington has wanted to
bolster the Guatemalan Army, which isfacing
a growing leftist guerrilla threat. U.S. policy
makers have said privately they are somewhat
constrained as long as the British troops are
theoretically up against Guatemala's largely
U.S.-trained army.
Washington refused a Guatemalan request
three years ago for U.S. F-5 fighters, which,
while not suitable for guerrilla warfare,
would be a match for the four British Harrier
jets here.
However, in June the Reagan adminis
tration sidestepped human-rights considera
tions in U.S. law and approved a $3.2 million
consignment of U.S. military trucks and jeeps
to Guatemala.
