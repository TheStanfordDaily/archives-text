# Brits find gold in sunken Russian ship
## 
### Washington Post 
London — The most lucra
tive undersea treasure hunt in
history ended yesterday when
a team of British divers arrived
in their space-age salvage ship
at the Soviet port of Murmansk
with nearly $80 million in gold
bars recovered from a sunken
World War II cruiser in the icy
Barents Sea.
Working more than a month
around the clock at record 800-
foot depths with computer
aided technology recently de
veloped for North Sea oil ex
ploration, the divers salvaged
431 gold bars — each weighing
23 pounds and worth nearly
$200,000 — from a pitch dark
ship storage room full of unex
ploded bombs, anti-aircraft

shells and other munitions.
The Soviet gold bars had
stamped dates ranging be
tween 1936 and 1942, and were
on their way to the United
States in the hold of the 10,000-
ton British cruiser HMS Edin
burgh nearly 40 years ago to
pay for U.S. arms sold to the So
viets during World War 11. On
April 30, 1942, the cruiser, at
the head of a convoy of 13
ships, was crippled 170 miles
out to sea from Murmansk by
attacking Nazi U-boats and de
stroyers and then was purpose
ly scuttled by a British de
stroyer to keep the gold from
the Germans, even though 60
of its 850-man crew were en
tombed in the wreck.
Today in Murmansk, British

and Soviet officials began
dividing the gold among their
countries and a consortium of
British salvage companies and
investors who mounted what
had been given up by others as
a financially and technolog
ically impossible dream.
The consortium, which spent
an estimated $4 million during
the past five weeks alone, will
receive 45 percent of the haul,
just under $40 million. By dic
tates of a postwar insurance
settlement, the Soviet Union
will get two-thirds of the rest
and the British government
one-third. The U.S. govern
ment receives nothing because
it was reimbursed by insurance
for the lost gold, worth $6 mil
lion at that time.
