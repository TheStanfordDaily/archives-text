# Cards grab surprise win over UCLA Bruins 26-23

It was a good day for a hang
over. The sky was a murky gray,
and the UCLA Bruins were in town
for yet another round of "Go
ahead, break my heart again"
Cardinal football.
Then there were 11 seconds left
on the clock, and it seemed like all
the time in the world because
UCLA quarterback Tom Ramsey
was ripping gaping holes in the
Cardinal secondary, moving his
team into field goal range. Ramsey
let one more go towards the side
lines, defensive tackle John
Bergren deflected it from the
hands of tight-end Tim
Wrightman, and the Cardinals
came up with an improbable 26-23
victory.
What happened in between was
one of the greater escape acts the
Cardinals have pulled. What they
did was sneak up on the Bruins. It
wasn't Instant Offense, it was the
clock and the numbers simply fall
ing in step for the first time all sea
son.
"What went right?" Stanford
coach Paul Wiggin was asked.
"The scoreboard," he laughed. "It
was one of those games where
you just thank God there wasn't
another quarter," he added.
For three quarters the Cardinals
chipped away at what seemed like
an inexorable Bruin effort. The
defense picked up four turnovers

(2 interceptions, 2 fumbles), while
offensively, halfback Darrin
Nelson and a little guy named
Mark Harmon with a leg of tem
pered steel handled the Bruin
case.
Harmon virtually kept the
Cardinals in the game, going 4-
for-4 on field goal attempts of 30,
22, and 47 yards in the first half,
and another of 22 yards in the
third period, allowing the
Cardinals to bide their time until
effective touchdown drives could
be mounted.
The moment of truth came with
6:26 remaining in the game when
Bergren blocked a UCLA field
goal attempt that gave the Cards
the ball at midfield. Stanford was
trailing 23-19 after a UCLA 83-yard
drive capped by an 8-yard TD
plunge by fullback Frank Bruno.
Quarterback John Elway nego
tiated his way downfield with the
help of Nelson scrapping around
for small yardage, and two com
pletions to halfback Vincent
White for nine and 11 yards to get
them to the UCLA 14.
The offensive line blew away
the Bruin defensive front on the
next play to get Nelson around left
end and to the two yardline for a
first down. White carried the ball
next for no gain, and Nelson re
turned to the game. He took an

"It was one of those
games where you just
thank God there wasn't
another quarter."
