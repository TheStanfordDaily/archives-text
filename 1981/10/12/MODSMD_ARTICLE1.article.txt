# Cards grab surprise win over UCLA Bruins 26-23
## Sports 
### Sally Jenkins 
It was a good day for a hang
over. The sky was a murky gray,
and the UCLA Bruins were in town
for yet another round of "Go
ahead, break my heart again"
Cardinal football.
Then there were 11 seconds left
on the clock, and it seemed like all
the time in the world because
UCLA quarterback Tom Ramsey
was ripping gaping holes in the
Cardinal secondary, moving his
team into field goal range. Ramsey
let one more go towards the side
lines, defensive tackle John
Bergren deflected it from the
hands of tight-end Tim
Wrightman, and the Cardinals
came up with an improbable 26-23
victory.
What happened in between was
one of the greater escape acts the
Cardinals have pulled. What they
did was sneak up on the Bruins. It
wasn't Instant Offense, it was the
clock and the numbers simply fall
ing in step for the first time all sea
son.
"What went right?" Stanford
coach Paul Wiggin was asked.
"The scoreboard," he laughed. "It
was one of those games where
you just thank God there wasn't
another quarter," he added.
For three quarters the Cardinals
chipped away at what seemed like
an inexorable Bruin effort. The
defense picked up four turnovers

(2 interceptions, 2 fumbles), while
offensively, halfback Darrin
Nelson and a little guy named
Mark Harmon with a leg of tem
pered steel handled the Bruin
case.
Harmon virtually kept the
Cardinals in the game, going 4-
for-4 on field goal attempts of 30,
22, and 47 yards in the first half,
and another of 22 yards in the
third period, allowing the
Cardinals to bide their time until
effective touchdown drives could
be mounted.
The moment of truth came with
6:26 remaining in the game when
Bergren blocked a UCLA field
goal attempt that gave the Cards
the ball at midfield. Stanford was
trailing 23-19 after a UCLA 83-yard
drive capped by an 8-yard TD
plunge by fullback Frank Bruno.
Quarterback John Elway nego
tiated his way downfield with the
help of Nelson scrapping around
for small yardage, and two com
pletions to halfback Vincent
White for nine and 11 yards to get
them to the UCLA 14.
The offensive line blew away
the Bruin defensive front on the
next play to get Nelson around left
end and to the two yardline for a
first down. White carried the ball
next for no gain, and Nelson re
turned to the game. He took an

"It was one of those
games where you just
thank God there wasn't
another quarter."

THE THRILL OF VICTORY — Coach Paul Wlggln seemed pleated with the Cards upset against the
Bruins in Saturday's game. For details on the game, see page 9.
Elway pitch, headed around the left end again,
and jack-knifed himself over two Bruins for his
first score of the season and the touchdown that
put the Cards ahead with 46 seconds remaining.
Nelson racked up 87 yards rushing and seven
passes for 74 yards, for a total of 186. He needed
only three snags to break the Pacific-10 con
ference record for career receptions, which he
did early in the first quarter. By the end of the
game he had catapulted himself into a tie for
10th place on the NCAA list for most career re
ceptions.
The Bruins dominated the Cards from the start
with the help of tailback Kevin Nelson, Darrin's
younger but larger brother. He scored from
three yards out on the Bruins' first possesion of
the game after Ramsey hit Wrightman and split
end Cormac Carney with passes of 11 and 33
yards respectively.
The Cards got on the board for the first time
with 2:29 remaining in the quarter when Har
mon kicked a 29-yarder after inside linebacker
Dave Morze picked off a Ramsey pass, his sec
ond turnover recovery of the day. His first came
with 2:02 remaining in the third quarter when he
caused Kevin Nelson to fumble, setting up Har
mon's last field goal, a 22-yarder.
UCLA responded on the first play of the sec
ond quarter by posting 7 more points on a 4-yard
Ramsey-Wrightman connection after Carney re
turned Harmon's kickoff 63-yards.
• Elway and flanker Mike Tolliver, the only
working combination of the Stanford offense
this season, came through again to top off a
beautiful 80-yard drive with 8:02 remaining in
the half. The Cards drove to the UCLA 8-yardline
in 16 plays, when Elway hit Tolliver with an over
the-shoulder loft in the left corner of the end
zone that was reminiscent of a Ken Margerum
play-
Harmon hit two field goals in rapid succession
before the half to hand the Cards a 16-14 lead
going into the locker room. The defense held
the Bruins in three plays, allowing the offense to
drive 41 yards in 14 plays (22-yard field goal), and
minutes later when defensive tackle Doug Rog
ers fell on a fumbled snap by Ramsey.
Two handoffs and a penalty later (UCLA on
Tolliver for 22 yards) Harmon laid into a 47-
yarder that never rose more than 15-feet in the
air, but split the posts with no time remaining in
the half.
