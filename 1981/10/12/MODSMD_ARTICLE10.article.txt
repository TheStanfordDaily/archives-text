# French see decline in wine production

St. Emilion, France (AP) â€”
jean-Jacques Moueix com
mented while sampling one of
the dark, blue grapes in his
vineyard. "It will be good this
year, but not as good as we'd
hoped two weeks ago before
the rains came."
Wine growers such as
Moueix, here in the heart of
Bordeaux country, are fretting
about the weather, the labor
problems involved in the har
vest and, above all, the critics.
The early reviews of the 1981
French wine harvest are in, and
the general judgment is that
there will be a significant im
provement in quality com
pared to 1980, which was con
sidered about average. The
harvest has not been bountiful,
however.
An estimated 140 million
bottles of wine will be pro
duced from this year's crop,
compared to 177 million in
1980, which already was con
sidered a below average yield.
Here, where Moueix pro
duces the highly-prized
"grand cru" wines of the St.
Emilion commune at his
Chateau Fontroques, produc
tion may be down as much as
25 percent from last year.
About the same is antici
pated for the Bourgogne

(Burgundy) region where the
wine is expected to exceed
1980 in quality but fall a bit
short of the well-received 1979
harvest.
Wine experts also look for
ward to this year's Beaujolais,
which they say should more
uniform in quality than last
year. Again, however, produc
tion is down even though the
Beaujolais region was one of
the few not hit by the late frost
in the spring.
Overall production through
out France is expected to be
about 9 percent below 1980.
The annual wine harvest is
more mechanized now than it
was in the old days. Harvesting
machines are increasingly
used, but it is still possible to
see small groups of grape
pickers.
Gypsies from all over Europe
still make the annual triptothe
wine regions for the two-week
harvest season that begins in
early October. They earn about
$40 a day for the back-breaking
work.
About the same is antici
pated for the Burgundy region
where the wine is expected to
exceed 1980 in quality but fall a
bit short of the well-received
1979 harvest.
