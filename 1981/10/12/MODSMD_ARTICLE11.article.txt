# Arabs dismiss Sadat's funeral
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beirut, Lebanon — The Arab World virtually
ignored the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat Saturday except for scathing insults from
the official press in Libya and Syria.
In stark contrast to the mass hysteria that ac
companied the funeral of Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser 11 years ago, there were no
significant public or private demonstrations in
any Arab city — for or against — Sadat.
Sadat pursued what is considered here a kind
of Egypt-first policy, and thus he never gained
nearly the stature that Nasser had among the 120
million or so Arabs.
The day passed quietly in Arab capitals except
for the fireworks that accompanied this Moslem
feast day of Id al-Adha, which marks the end of
the Mecca pilgrimage season. Only three Arab
states — Sudan, Somalia and Oman — had sent
leaders to attend the funeral in Cairo; Moroc
co's prime minister pulled out at the last minute
reportedly because of objections to the pres
ence of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
at the ceremony.
Syria mocks mourners
Those leaders — President Jaafar Numeire of
Sudan, Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia, and a
representative of Sultan Kaboos ibn Said of
Oman — were described Saturday by Syrian ra
dio as "U.S. agents" for participating with Begin.
The most pronounced reaction, predictably,
came from the most virulently anti-Egyptian
leader, Libya's Colonel Moammar Khadafi
whose government's official news broadcast de
clared "The traitor Sadat was buried — finally."
"Those who walked behind his dirty corpse
were a bunch of imperialistic traitors and fore
most among them was the terrorist Begin and
the dirty Numeire," said the official radio in
Tripoli.
"Egyptians carried out the death sentence by
firing squad against the traitor Sadat. Thetermof
the Numeire will not be long if he continues to
pursue Sadat policy. Sudan is capable of execut
ing the dirty Numeire, too."
Libya cites US ties
The official Libyan news agency also con
demned "suspicious, provocative and terrorist
maneuvers" by the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Medi
terranean off the Libyan coast.
"The American moves follow overt threats by
the American president and his secretary of
state, the tyrant Haig," the diplomatic cor
respondent of the news agency jana declared.
"They uncover America's real intentions of con
solidating American presence in Egypt, Sudan,

and Somalia."
Arab opinion in most countires — ranging
from the radical Libyans and Syrians to the mod
erate Saudi Arabians — was generally anti-Sadat
because of the Egyptian leader's peace treaty
with Israel.
The more vehement leaders of the so-called
"Steadfastness and Confrontation Front" — Lib
ya, Syria, Algeria, South Yemen, and the
Palestine Liberation Organization — were op
posed to any peace with Israel.
Nasser's pan-Arabism
In Beirut there were no demonstrations
against Sadat Saturday, as there were at the time
of his death Tuesday.

'It was a secret funeral. Peo
ple were forbidden to at
tend. Compare that to
Nasser's, the biggest In his
tory. Then, there were mil
lions of Arabs weeping In the
street'
— Omar Kutaish, spokesman
for the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine

However, fresh posters of ex-President Nasser
were displayed in many parts of the city. Nasser
had fostered a kind of socialistic pan-Arabism
during his role from 1954 to 1970 — and that
made him a folk hero in many parts of the Arab
World.
In Beirut, a spokesman for the radical Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Omar
Kutaish, gazed out onto the quiet streets near his
office and declared of the funeral in Cairo:
"It was a s secret funeral. People were for
bidden to attend. Compare that to Nasser's, the
biggest in history. Then there were millions of
Arabs weeping in the street."
The moderate Arab leaders in Jordan and
Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf believe that
Sadat had made his deal with Israel, but was un
able to draw from Begin any concessions. To
them, the overriding issue is Palestinian auton
omy.
