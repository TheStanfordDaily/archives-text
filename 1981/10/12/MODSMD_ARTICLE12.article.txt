## Companies visit campus seeking talented and qualified students 
### Bob Cohn 
For several thousand
Stanford students, White
Plaza was transformed last
Friday from its usual center
of student hustle and bustle
into a mock introduction to
the "real world." Stanford's
fourth annual Job Faire
brought to campus an array
of busy volunteers, en
thusiastic company repre
sentatives, colorful
balloons, and eager stu
dents — many of whom
were looking for the right
place to put their Stanford
education to the test.
Over 200 representatives
from 76 different companies
came from as far away as
Georgia and the Carolinas
to participate in the Faire.
For them, it was an op
portunity to introduce
themselves to "tomorrow's
leaders," or at least to
potential employees. For
the students, it was a chance
to talk with representatives
in a relaxed atmosphere.
The diversity of com
panies present assured that
all possible interests were
represented — from bank
ing to Bell, lab assistants to
management assistants,
Coast Guard to Boy Scouts,
biology to geology, there
was definitely a wide selec
tion from the assorted fields
that represent today's job
market.
Debbie Duncan, co
chairman of the Job Faire
and assistant director of
Stanford's Career Planning
and Placement Center
(CPPC), stressed that the
Faire was a chance for stu
dents to amass career in
formation. Although several
organizations were happy
to accept applications and
resumes, it was mostly a
chance for students to
"shop around" — especially
since most companies will
be returning to campus in
the spring.
"Companies that predict
staff turnover come here as
part of their recruiting pro
gram," Duncan said. She
added that "some people
have gotten jobs as a direct
result of meeting someone
at the Job Faire."

According to Duncan the
Faire benefits students in
that since they are on their
"home turf," questions are
informal and the at
mosphere relaxed.
"Because you aren't in a
true interview situation, the
conversation flows more
freely and the represent
atives seem to be more can
did about their jobs," said
Dave Weiss, a fifth year en
gineering student. "Stu
dents feel more at ease
when and if they have fol
low-up interviews."
Of the 76 company tables,
the Arthur Anderson ac
counting firm and IBM con
sistently attracted the larg
est crowds.
The atmosphere of the
Faire was serious. "The same
people you partied with the
night before," one girl re
marked, "are now out here
trying to figure out what to
do with their lives. It's sort of
scary."
Seniors and graduate stu
dents, who composed the
majority of ■ the crowd,
milled about with pen and
clipboard, hoping their
schooling had successfully
prepared them to enter
their desired field.
Greg Brown, a 1977 Stan
ford alumnus and presently
a representative for the
FMC Corporation, said that
students now seem more
career oriented. "They are
more interested in jobs than
ever before, they're asking
good questions, and some
are submitting resumes."
The band (LSJUMB),
which used to come to the
Faire, has been struck from
the program because the
noise was too great. "The
entertaiment is the Faire
itself," said Duncan; "just
talking to the career repre
sentatives."
Ann Tompkins, of Wyle
Distribution group said
about the Faire, "I think it is
one of the best .. . it's
always well organized." A
waste of time for the com
panies? Brown said that
"We realize we want top
quality people and that's
why we come to Stanford."

Wnite Plaza. The companies provided Iterature and first
hand advice for the job-shopping Individuals.

For several thousand
Stanford students, White
Plaza was transformed last
Friday from its usual center
of student hustle and bustle
into a mock introduction to
the "real world." Stanford's
fourth annual Job Faire
brought to campus an array
of busy volunteers, en
thusiastic company repre
sentatives, colorful
balloons, and eager stu
dents — many of whom
were looking for the right
place to put their Stanford
education to the test.
Over 200 representatives
from 76 different companies
came from as far away as
Georgia and the Carolinas
to participate in the Faire.
For them, it was an op
portunity to introduce
themselves to "tomorrow's
leaders," or at least to
potential employees. For
the students, it was a chance
to talk with representatives
in a relaxed atmosphere.
The diversity of com
panies present assured that
all possible interests were
represented — from bank
ing to Bell, lab assistants to
management assistants,
Coast Guard to Boy Scouts,
biology to geology, there
was definitely a wide selec
tion from the assorted fields
that represent today's job
market.
Debbie Duncan, co
chairman of the Job Faire
and assistant director of
Stanford's Career Planning
and Placement Center
(CPPC), stressed that the
Faire was a chance for stu
dents to amass career in
formation. Although several
organizations were happy
to accept applications and
resumes, it was mostly a
chance for students to
"shop around" — especially
since most companies will
be returning to campus in
the spring.
"Companies that predict
staff turnover come here as
part of their recruiting pro
gram," Duncan said. She
added that "some people
have gotten jobs as a direct
result of meeting someone
at the Job Faire."

According to Duncan the
Faire benefits students in
that since they are on their
"home turf," questions are
informal and the at
mosphere relaxed.
"Because you aren't in a
true interview situation, the
conversation flows more
freely and the represent
atives seem to be more can
did about their jobs," said
Dave Weiss, a fifth year en
gineering student. "Stu
dents feel more at ease
when and if they have fol
low-up interviews."
Of the 76 company tables,
the Arthur Anderson ac
counting firm and IBM con
sistently attracted the larg
est crowds.
The atmosphere of the
Faire was serious. "The same
people you partied with the
night before," one girl re
marked, "are now out here
trying to figure out what to
do with their lives. It's sort of
scary."
Seniors and graduate stu
dents, who composed the
majority of ■ the crowd,
milled about with pen and
clipboard, hoping their
schooling had successfully
prepared them to enter
their desired field.
Greg Brown, a 1977 Stan
ford alumnus and presently
a representative for the
FMC Corporation, said that
students now seem more
career oriented. "They are
more interested in jobs than
ever before, they're asking
good questions, and some
are submitting resumes."
The band (LSJUMB),
which used to come to the
Faire, has been struck from
the program because the
noise was too great. "The
entertaiment is the Faire
itself," said Duncan; "just
talking to the career repre
sentatives."
Ann Tompkins, of Wyle
Distribution group said
about the Faire, "I think it is
one of the best .. . it's
always well organized." A
waste of time for the com
panies? Brown said that
"We realize we want top
quality people and that's
why we come to Stanford."
