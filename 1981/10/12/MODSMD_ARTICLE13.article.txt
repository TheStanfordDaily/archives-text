# Team brings chills and thrills

Stanford has an ice hockey
team? Yes,therearestudentsat
this sun-drenched California
university who willingly expose
themselves to the ice and cold
of a skating rink. Over 25 male
students comprise the little
known, but highly talented
Stanford ice hockey team.
The team is a member of the
Northern California Hockey
League and its opponents in
clude both school teams and
semi-pro clubs. Although most
away games are one-day road
trips to places as close as Santa
Rosa and Stockton, the team
has ventured in the past to Los
Angeles and as far as Seattle.
They compiled an impressive
20-6-4 record last season and
took first place in a tournament
at Monterey. Home games and
practices are held Sunday eve
nings at Belmont Iceland, a 25-
minwte drive from campus.
According to Dave Speer,

experienced hockey player
and team co-captain, the club
has a "very diverse group of
guys." About half the players
are graduate students — there
are several business students,
engineers, medical and law
school students, and even an
English professor.
Speer considers the team
"highly skilled" as most of the
players have grown up playing
ice hockey on other teams.
Spots on the team are vir
tually filled right now but good
hockey players are encouraged
to try out. Players must supply
their own equipment (not in
cluding uniforms) and are re
quired to pay half of their
transportation costs to away
games.
In addition to the ice hockey
team, there is a recreational
club which practices with the
team Sunday evenings. Scrim
mages are open to "anyone
who comes out to play," ac

cording to Speer and member
ship in the club includes quar
terly dues to cover rink privi
leges.
Despite the hockey team's
excellent record, attendance at
last year's games was minimal.
In fact, Speer laments, "just a
few girlfriends showed up."
This year, however, interest in
the team has grown con
siderably due to promotional
activities at registration and in
creased word-of-mouth.
Upcoming games will be an
nounced in the Daily's Once
Around the Quad, and the
team will try to arrange rides to
Belmont Iceland for interested
spectators.
The team will play its first
game in about two weeks, and
Speer is optimistic for a great
season. "We love to win, but
we don't take ourselves too se
riously — we go out there to
have funl"
