Stanford University has a special language
program connected with the Linguistics Pro
gram, in order to provide resources necessary to
each student's particular educational goals.
According to David Cusic, coordinator for the
program, students can basically request a course
in any language. There are currently 26 different
languages being offered, including Arabic,
Scandinavian languages, American sign lan
guage, and Navajo. He said there is a minimum
enrollment of three, unless compelling reasons
persuade them to hire a teacher for fewer stu
dents. In some cases, for example, a certain lan
guage may be necessary for a student to conduct
research for his dissertation.
Enrollment in the program was 125 last year.
According to Cusic, only a select group of re
quested courses are offered, with one deciding
factor being the availability of a teacher. Re
souces are not a problem as there is an amazing
array in the area for almost any language, he
added.
Teachers include faculty, graduate students,
faculty spouses and a Hoover Tower librarian.
Because so many classes are offered, none are
listed in the time schedule and interested stu
dents should call 7-3636 or visit Linguistics 101-B
for information.
The classes are three units and meet three
hours a week. Schedules are flexible and are ar
ranged between students and teacher.
Armenian, a pioneer program, has a tutor
once a week and the rest of the instruction is
done with the use of a computer. The idea is

unique to Stanford, said Cusic.
Last year Albanian was offered to a student
who is now doing research at Yale University on
Albanian-American Diplomatic Relationships.
Tok Pisin, a New Guinea pidgin, is now being of
fered because someone who will be doing field
work in New Guinea requested it.

'Students can basically
request a course in any
language. There are
currently 26 different
languages being offered,
including Arabic,
Scandinavian languages,
American sign language,and
Navajo/

Cusic said there are different reasons why stu
dents take these languages. Family background
often initiates an interest and when a student
gets involved with the language he integrates it
with his career goals.
He added that there is a positive feedback on
the program. "On the whole, the program is
quite successful." He attributes this to person
able teachers and small classes, in which stu
dents receive more individual attention and feel
freer to ask questions.
