# Opinions
## BEYOND OUR CONTROL/Editor's viewpoint Daily is an open forum 
### 
Down at the bottom of this page, you'll find
our staff box, which includes a list not just of
who does what for the paper, but a statement
about our editorial policy.
That policy has once again been the subject of
debate within the University community.
Perhaps some larger type and a re-explanation
here will be of service to those who wonder how
policy decisions are made.
First of all, the Daily has always made an effort
to explain to the community, as stated beiow,
that "Nothing on the opinions pages necessarily
represents a position of the entire Daily staff, or
.. Stanford University." Those who submit an
opinion, or an editorial cartoon (the subject of
most of the recent debate), make a personal
expression of a concept, and choose the means
whereby that concept is expressed.
The author of a particular submission, in
making a statement, subjects himself or herself
to the judgment of those who read the
newspaper.
It is not the purpose of the Daily to endorse a
particular point of view by including it on the
editorial pages; or, for that matter, to condemn
one by excluding it. Opinions are presented for
the benefit of exchange and debate within the
community. The exception is that the Daily
does, of course, endorse the editorials which are
written by the editorial board, whichis
composed of the editor, managing editor, two
news editors, two opinions editors, and also of
three at-large members who are elected by the
staff. Candidacy for the latter positions is open
to anyone.
That point being made, I will without
hesitation add that it becomes the editor's
judgment which prevents pieces which are
either libelous or obscene from running in the
paper. (I should in fairness to all other Daily
staffers emphasize that the final decision on
what is or is not withheld lies with me, and that I
accept any ultimate responsibility for recent
decisions.)
When those decisions have to be made, I try
my best to put aside any personal biases or
feelings in favor of a broad-minded approach;
this results in things being printed which I or
others don't necessarily like, but it seems to me
to be the most fair way.
Specifically, as long as I do not consider it

libelous or obscene, I will withdraw something
chosen by an editor for publication only if I
believe that the author has indeed submitted
something in poor taste which serves no other
discernible purpose. I feel that some recent
submissions, which could be considered in poor
taste, have served other purposes.
Even here, though, it's difficult to make
judgments about the purpose behind what
others do, and I seriously wonder whether it is
the right of an editor to make censorship
involving decisions about what a writer or
cartoonist is thinking. Moreover, I'm not sure
where to draw the line between what might be
considered uniformly offensive or even
pernicious by all people and what I myself might
consider to be so.
This is not to say that I will never make those
kinds of decisions in this volume, but that I have
not felt the need to make one yet, based on what
we have published in the newspaper. I realize
that many people probably disagree with me
given the material involved, and I encourage
them to continue to write to the Daily to express
their own views.
With a cartoon recently published which
many felt demeans and stereotypes native
Americans, the purpose of the particular strip
and of the cartoonist himself was not a simple
issue. Having accepted the cartoon for
publication as the best among those which have
been submitted to the paper, I have the
foresight to know how the specific character
develops and what he will come to stand for. I
do not believe that the strip represents any sort
of a sustained attack on native Americans or any
other group, and as such I have not had reason
to deny the cartoonist the right to express
himself.
Finally, though somewhat of a less important
defense of freedom of publication, I sincerely
believe that the submissions in question have
done more to raise community awareness of the
issues involved than if they had never been
printed at all. I think that's an important point,
although I certainly reject the idea that the Daily
should print nothing but controversial
statements and cartoons in ordertoelicitthat
kind of response and awareness.

them to continue to write to the Daily to express
their own views.
With a cartoon recently published which
many felt demeans and stereotypes native
Americans, the purpose of the particular strip
and of the cartoonist himself was not a simple
issue. Having accepted the cartoon for
publication as the best among those which have
been submitted to the paper, I have the
foresight to know how the specific character
develops and what he will come to stand for. I
do not believe that the strip represents any sort
of a sustained attack on native Americans or any
other group, and as such I have not had reason
to deny the cartoonist the right to express
himself.
Finally, though somewhat of a less important
defense of freedom of publication, I sincerely
believe that the submissions in question have
done more to raise community awareness of the
issues involved than if they had never been
printed at all. I think that's an important point,
although I certainly reject the idea that the Daily
should print nothing but controversial
statements and cartoons in ordertoelicitthat
kind of response and awareness.

Down at the bottom of this page, you'll find
our staff box, which includes a list not just of
who does what for the paper, but a statement
about our editorial policy.
That policy has once again been the subject of
debate within the University community.
Perhaps some larger type and a re-explanation
here will be of service to those who wonder how
policy decisions are made.
First of all, the Daily has always made an effort
to explain to the community, as stated beiow,
that "Nothing on the opinions pages necessarily
represents a position of the entire Daily staff, or
.. Stanford University." Those who submit an
opinion, or an editorial cartoon (the subject of
most of the recent debate), make a personal
expression of a concept, and choose the means
whereby that concept is expressed.
The author of a particular submission, in
making a statement, subjects himself or herself
to the judgment of those who read the
newspaper.
It is not the purpose of the Daily to endorse a
particular point of view by including it on the
editorial pages; or, for that matter, to condemn
one by excluding it. Opinions are presented for
the benefit of exchange and debate within the
community. The exception is that the Daily
does, of course, endorse the editorials which are
written by the editorial board, whichis
composed of the editor, managing editor, two
news editors, two opinions editors, and also of
three at-large members who are elected by the
staff. Candidacy for the latter positions is open
to anyone.
That point being made, I will without
hesitation add that it becomes the editor's
judgment which prevents pieces which are
either libelous or obscene from running in the
paper. (I should in fairness to all other Daily
staffers emphasize that the final decision on
what is or is not withheld lies with me, and that I
accept any ultimate responsibility for recent
decisions.)
When those decisions have to be made, I try
my best to put aside any personal biases or
feelings in favor of a broad-minded approach;
this results in things being printed which I or
others don't necessarily like, but it seems to me
to be the most fair way.
Specifically, as long as I do not consider it

libelous or obscene, I will withdraw something
chosen by an editor for publication only if I
believe that the author has indeed submitted
something in poor taste which serves no other
discernible purpose. I feel that some recent
submissions, which could be considered in poor
taste, have served other purposes.
Even here, though, it's difficult to make
judgments about the purpose behind what
others do, and I seriously wonder whether it is
the right of an editor to make censorship
involving decisions about what a writer or
cartoonist is thinking. Moreover, I'm not sure
where to draw the line between what might be
considered uniformly offensive or even
pernicious by all people and what I myself might
consider to be so.
This is not to say that I will never make those
kinds of decisions in this volume, but that I have
not felt the need to make one yet, based on what
we have published in the newspaper. I realize
that many people probably disagree with me
given the material involved, and I encourage
them to continue to write to the Daily to express
their own views.
With a cartoon recently published which
many felt demeans and stereotypes native
Americans, the purpose of the particular strip
and of the cartoonist himself was not a simple
