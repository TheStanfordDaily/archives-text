## Neutron bomb would benefit international stability, peace 
### 
Since 1950, peace has been
purchased by a strong defense pos
ture. Unfortunately, our position has
become increasingly tenuous and
tense. President Ronald Reagan is at
tempting to relieve this situation by
readying a superior defensive weap
on for potential use by NATO nations
— manufacturing neutron bombs
and stockpiling them in the United
States so that they would be readily
available if need arises. As a result of
this decision, several democratic Eu
ropean governments are confronted
with great and somewhat peculiar
hostility among their electorates.
The 40,000 modern tanks confront
ing NATO appear overwhelming, but
the general public seems more con
cerned with the advent of "another"
nuclear weapon. Prejudice, fear, ig
norance, and, I am afriad, in no small
part, intentional propaganda are the
basis of this reponse. It is important
to understand what the neutron
bomb actually is.
Nuclear weapons give rise to four
destructive effects: blast, heat radio
active fallout, and prompt radiation.
In big "conventional" nuclear weap
ons, the first three effects pre
dominate. Prompt radiation effects
occur only where damage from the
first two factors is already total. The
neutron bomb is a small nuclear ex
plosive, one kiloton or less, deto
nated a few hundred feet above the
ground. Its explosion results in no se
rious effects from shock or heat, and
the small amount of radioactivity
produced will rise to a high altitude;
it too will be harmless.
This small, very lightweight, weap
on can be fired — with great accuracy

— from a hundred miles behind the
lines. It therefore has marked advan
tages over conventional anti-tank,
anti-personell weapons in portability
and range. In addition, material dam
age in the defended region is prac
tically non-existent. Civilians caught
in the open in the immediate battle
area will be killed by instant radiation
which will be gone in about one sec
ond. Those less than a mile away, or
even directly below the burst but in a
reasonably deep cellar, will be safe.
The relatively thin armor of a tank,
however, is totally inadequate
against these accurately placed ex
plosions. Thus the weapon neutral
izes important Soviet advantages, a
fact which explains their intense op
position.
Large nuclear weapons are of
fensive weapons. Our current de
fense posture is based on the threat
of the massive indiscriminate re
taliatory destruction their use would
ential. Today, this threat is the effec
tive defense of Europe from invasion.
The neutron bomb is a first attempt
to move towards defense rather than
offense. Protecting one's citizenry
should be a basic national purpose.
Fabricating and stockpiling neu
tron bombs in the United States will
allow NATO to be prepared for rela
tively limited action should the need
arise. This appears incomparably bet
ter than placing all defense reliance
on mutually assured destruction. It is
argued that the neutron bomb will
inevitably lead to thermonuclear
war. Actually strength, wisely used,
. lowers the possibility of conflict.
In order to avoid any misun
derstanding, NATO should unilat

erally declare that we shall never be
the first to use nuclear explosives on
enemy territory. However, all weap
ons, including neutron bombs,
should be available for use in defense
of and on one's own land. Such a dec
laration combined with appropriate
preparation would substantially de
crease the danger of war. NATO
would be able to repulse a conven
tional attack successfully and thus in
cur less danger of escalation. Soviet
alternatives would become less at
tractive: attack by non-nuclear
means would have a greatly
diminished chance of success. As
now, their use of nuclear weapons on
foreign territory would invite retalia
tion.
An agreement about firing control
should precede the decision to
deploy neutron bombs. These small
tactical weapons should be dispersed
to field units. Devices should be in
corporated so that these bombs are
disabled except when enabling
coded electronic signals are re
ceived.
The neutron bomb is an effective
defensive weapon which does less
damage to the defenders than con
ventional alternatives. As such, the
production and deployment of the
neutron bomb would make a great
contribution to the stability and pres
ervation of peace. In the present dis
turbed times, such a contribution can
be appreciated only if people are
willing to become informed and
think realistically about a dangerous
future which becomes the more dan
gerous the less we think about it.
