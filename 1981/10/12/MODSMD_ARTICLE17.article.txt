## Sadat never a hero to Egyptians, Arab neighbors 
### 
The Arab students at Stanford, while aware of
the campaign waged in the American media to
present Sadat as a fallen hero of peace, would like
to draw the attention of the American people to
the fact that Sadat was drastically differently per
" ceived in Egypt and throughout the Arab and Third
His demise has been a source of happiness
and relief in his own country and many other
places. In this statement, we would like to present
a few points which we think are grossly ignored in
the American media coverage and which underlie
Sadat's death.
The Egyptian people and their Arab brothers
never pardoned Sadat, for, or forgot, that it was he
who split Egypt from the rest of the Arab world
with which it shares its indentity, history, geogra
phy, economic reality, culture and future. Sadat
caused the rupture in Egypt's relationship with the
Arab world by his ignoring Arab and Egypt's rights

and interests in his scanadlous sell-out to Israel.
The so-called Camp David accords grossly neg
lected the crux of the Middle East dilemma: name
ly, the right of the Palestinian people to establish
an independent state of their own on their own
land in Palestine.
In addition, he also pulled Egypt from its re
spected position as both a founder and member of
the Non-Aligned Movement. Instead, he made
Egypt a base for Western Imperialism in the Arab
and Islamic worlds and in Africa (Witness: sending
of Egyptian troops, on behalf of imperialist and co
lonial interests, to crush popular opposition and to
reinforce corrupt and hated regimes in the Sudan,
Zaire, and Oman).
Internally, the economic prosperity which Sadat
promised Egyptian people never actually material
ized. On the contrary his economic policies led to
a never precedented gap between a few who came

to have everything and an overwhelming majority
of peasants and slum dwellers who had nothing ex
cept despair made even worse by Egypt's with
drawal from the economic life of the Arab World
(Witness: the "bread" uprising of 1977).
Despite his claims of building a democratic state
structure in Egypt, his continuous and unabashed
crack-down of all forms of opposition belied those
claims and furthered his estrangement from the
Egyptian people (Witness: recent imprisonment of
thousands of opposition members — Muslim,
Copts, liberals, socialists, etc.).
Finally, we want to emphasize that Sadat's death
is a purely Egyptian matter that should be dealt
with by the Egyptian people themselves. We warn
all foreign parties against exploiting the occasion
to meddle in Egypt's affairs.
