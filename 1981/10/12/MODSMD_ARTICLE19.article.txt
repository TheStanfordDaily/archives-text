## Assassination reveals student apathy 
### 
Which should we judge the more
terrifying — the assassination of Pres
ident Anwar Sadat or the world reac
tion to his passing? Certainly it was a
great shock to see him struck down as
he celebrated one of his own
triumphs, but I learned much more
about the state of the world from the
aftermath. The outpouring of hatred
in the hardline Islamic countries was
predictable, but the eerie calm and
indifference within Egypt to the kill
ing of its greatest modern leader is a
sign of a fundamentally sick society.
Reaction elsewhere, including Stan
ford, is also cause for concern.
When Egyptian Gamal Nasser died
in 1970, the masses filled the streets
beating their chests in grief, mourn
ing a man whose greatest achieve
ment lay in making Egypt the
strongest Arab military power and

whose greatest distinction was as a
demagogue. Now that Sadat, a man
with rare courage, vision, and charis
ma, has been murdered, the masses
are mute. The fervor of the assassina
tion celebrations in Lebanon, Libya,
Syria and Iran provide stark contrast
to both Egypt and the self-serving
condolences from the West. It is true
that many people in America and Eu
rope admire Sadat, but is it because
he was a peacemaker and dedicated
to improving the lot of his people, or
merely because he was anti-Soviet
and a stablizing force in the Middle
East?
Is it only the doctrines of hatred
and their proponents that can arouse
public fervor in the 80s? When will
the world's peoples be satiated by
the warmongering in both the East
and the West? Does the odd reaction
of Egyptians point to an underlying
weariness with their political and ec
onomic problems, so that the as
sassination is just one more awful
event piled on all the rest? Could this
smoldering discontent burst forth to
rock the Mid-East and the world with
yet another political crisis?
I pose all these questions because
they should be of concern to ev
erybody, more so now than ever. Yet
I see no sign that the majority of the
Stanford community considers these
important, nor even gives them a

passing thought. I shudder to think
that we are considered the best and
the brightest. There are many con
cerned people at Stanford, but the
percentage is tiny, considering such a
privileged community. One need
only attend events such as the Weap
on's Crisis Week of last spring to rec
ognize this.
Of course we're all busy preparing
for our lives ahead, but they may all
be cut suddenly short if we don't ex
press ourselves on national and in
ternational issues. To ignore events
such as the assassination means to ig
nore things that directly affect us in
the pocketbook, in front of the draft
board, etc. Being a member of the
Stanford community confers both in
fluence on world affairs and the re
sponsibility for keeping informed
and involved. At the moment most of
us are are abdicating that responsi
bility. The events of the past few days
should serve to shock us out of our
complacency. But this is only an
argument based on pragmatic self
interest.
Even more worrisome is the spirit
in which students reacted to the
death of Sadat. More concern is ex-

pressed about showing the
gruesome details on television than
about the sadness of the event. No
one expressed sorrow at his passing
— he could have been on another
planet as far as most of us were con
cerned. Yet it is just this attitude of in
difference which unconsciously
shapes our foreign policy. Our lead
ers come from places such as Stan
ford, and attitudes formed here are
perpetuated at the highest levels of
power. The responsibility is indeed
great among the student body and
faculty to strive for an atmosphere of
concern and interest.
It is clear that totalitarianism is on
the rise again, and that America must
become a clear voice in opposition,
lest we be overwhelmed, just recent
ly I spoke to a Stanford graduate stu
dent whose wife was being refused
permission to leave Poland and join
him here for a year. Even our own
neighbors are being made to suffer as
we sit like the monkey who sees no
evil, hears no evil, and speaks no evil.
That is not enough — we must see the
evil and act against it.

event piled on all the rest? Could this
smoldering discontent burst forth to
rock the Mid-East and the world with
yet another political crisis?
I pose all these questions because
they should be of concern to ev
erybody, more so now than ever. Yet
I see no sign that the majority of the
Stanford community considers these
important, nor even gives them a

passing thought. I shudder to think
that we are considered the best and
the brightest. There are many con
cerned people at Stanford, but the
percentage is tiny, considering such a
privileged community. One need
only attend events such as the Weap
on's Crisis Week of last spring to rec
ognize this.
Of course we're all busy preparing
for our lives ahead, but they may all
be cut suddenly short if we don't ex
press ourselves on national and in
ternational issues. To ignore events
such as the assassination means to ig
nore things that directly affect us in
the pocketbook, in front of the draft
board, etc. Being a member of the
Stanford community confers both in
fluence on world affairs and the re
sponsibility for keeping informed
and involved. At the moment most of
us are are abdicating that responsi
bility. The events of the past few days
should serve to shock us out of our
complacency. But this is only an
argument based on pragmatic self
interest.
Even more worrisome is the spirit
in which students reacted to the
death of Sadat. More concern is ex-

pressed about showing the
gruesome details on television than
about the sadness of the event. No
one expressed sorrow at his passing
— he could have been on another
planet as far as most of us were con
cerned. Yet it is just this attitude of in
difference which unconsciously
shapes our foreign policy. Our lead
ers come from places such as Stan
ford, and attitudes formed here are
perpetuated at the highest levels of
power. The responsibility is indeed
great among the student body and
faculty to strive for an atmosphere of
concern and interest.
It is clear that totalitarianism is on
the rise again, and that America must
become a clear voice in opposition,
lest we be overwhelmed, just recent
ly I spoke to a Stanford graduate stu
dent whose wife was being refused
permission to leave Poland and join
him here for a year. Even our own
neighbors are being made to suffer as
we sit like the monkey who sees no
evil, hears no evil, and speaks no evil.
That is not enough — we must see the
evil and act against it.

Which should we judge the more
terrifying — the assassination of Pres
ident Anwar Sadat or the world reac
tion to his passing? Certainly it was a
great shock to see him struck down as
he celebrated one of his own
triumphs, but I learned much more
about the state of the world from the
aftermath. The outpouring of hatred
in the hardline Islamic countries was
predictable, but the eerie calm and
indifference within Egypt to the kill
ing of its greatest modern leader is a
sign of a fundamentally sick society.
Reaction elsewhere, including Stan
ford, is also cause for concern.
When Egyptian Gamal Nasser died
in 1970, the masses filled the streets
beating their chests in grief, mourn
ing a man whose greatest achieve
ment lay in making Egypt the
strongest Arab military power and

whose greatest distinction was as a
demagogue. Now that Sadat, a man
with rare courage, vision, and charis
ma, has been murdered, the masses
are mute. The fervor of the assassina
tion celebrations in Lebanon, Libya,
Syria and Iran provide stark contrast
to both Egypt and the self-serving
condolences from the West. It is true
that many people in America and Eu
rope admire Sadat, but is it because
he was a peacemaker and dedicated
to improving the lot of his people, or
merely because he was anti-Soviet
and a stablizing force in the Middle
East?
Is it only the doctrines of hatred
and their proponents that can arouse
public fervor in the 80s? When will
the world's peoples be satiated by
the warmongering in both the East
and the West? Does the odd reaction
of Egyptians point to an underlying
weariness with their political and ec
onomic problems, so that the as
sassination is just one more awful
event piled on all the rest? Could this
smoldering discontent burst forth to
rock the Mid-East and the world with
yet another political crisis?
