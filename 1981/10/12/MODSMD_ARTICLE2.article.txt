# Med Center heart-lung transplant successful
## 
### 
Doctors at the Medical Center suc
cessfully completed the fourth com
bined heart-lung transplant of 1981
yesterday. The patient, 40 year-old
Barry Davis of Redwood City, was
listed in "critical condition" follow
ing surgery, according to Med Cen
ter spokesperson Mike Goodkind.
This is the seventh such transplant
in history, the fourth performed by
the surgery team led by Drs. Bruce
Reitz and Norman Shumway.
Davis, who was forced to quit his
job in hotel management about two
years ago, was born with a hole in his
heart that necessitated the re
placement of both lungs.
Goodkind explained that the birth
defect had created "pulmonary hy
pertension" within Davis' body, a
condition akin to "driving your car
with the brakes on.
"You eventually burn out the mo
tor, but you can't remedy the situ
ation by simply replacing the motor,
you have to fix the brakes, too," he
said.
The procedure took five and a half
hours — good time, according to
Goodkind — and Davis' vital signs
were stable following the operation.
The longest surviving heart-lung
patient is Mary Gohlke, 45, a news
paper executive from Mesa, Ariz.,
who went home from the hospital on
June 2.
On May 1, the transplant surgery
team implanted a new heartand lung
in the chest of Charles Walker, 30, of
Binghamton, N.Y. Walker, who had
been suffering from a condition very
similar to Davis's, returned home
Sept. 6.
Both Mrs. Gohlke and Walker are

continuing to improve, Goodkind
said.
On July 28, the doctors performed
the combined transplant operation
on Karen Wilson, 28, of Mill Valley,
Calif. She died Aug. 1.
Mrs. Gohlke's operation was the
first of its kind in a decade. There
were three previous attempts, be
tween 1968 and 1971, but none of the
patients lived more than 23 days after
surgery.
Goodkind said that another heart
lung transplant could likely be ex
pected in the next year, but added
that they are not common because of
the special circumstances which
must be met by both donor and reci
pient.
