## Commentary/Andrew Bennet Cabinet proves delectable

Even the most casual and apolitical
observer must have noticed the new
wind blowing through Washington
these days Peanuts and Georgia
are out; Preppie and Jelly Beans are
in. Unfortunately, as Washington has
undergone this cultural revolution, a
critical element of our heritage has
been sorely neglected. I am speak
ing, of course, of that quintessential
coinage of cultivated communities:
cuisine. American cuisine, which has
been at best a second-rate affair de
pendent on foreign imports, is now a
national disgrace. Visiting dignitaries
could not help but be offended
when Nancy sets out her newly ac
quired $209,508 dinnerware and
serves the food that America takes
pride in: Porcine au Blanket. For
tunately, a recent author has com
piled a collection of recipes which
can avert the "cuisine crisis" and sev
eral other crises as well. A few favor

Watt's for dinner?
A favorite at environmental group
gatherings, this delectable dish re
quires one balding, bug-eyed, self
righteous secretary of the interior.
First, sautee the Secretary in a sauce
of industrial wastes and leaked off
shore oil. A piece of solid waste, or
sludge, may be inserted in the mouth
to increase the visual sensation of the
dish. After the exterior has been
browned and seasoned, the dish can
be cooked in eitherof two ways, de
pendong on the chef's personal
taste. Some prefer that the secretary
be turned slowly over high-level nu
clear wastes, while others who have
less time and don't mind the added
expense may want to cook the secre

tary by the more direct method of a
core meltdown. Serves 15 to 30, de
pending on how many return for the
second coming ... er, second help
ing.

active glow-in-the-dark feature is
sure to be a novelty at candlelight af
fairs. Simply mix one aggressive,
simple-minded secretary of state in a
complex world of Russians, Chinese,
Europeans, and Third World coun
tries and supply him with plenty of
warheads and a free hand to do what
ever he wants, then sit back and
watch the fireworks.
Chocolate Meese
This selection, though rather high
in choleric content, is reputed to be
so good that some cooks have pre
pared and eaten it in the kitchen and
then waited six hours before even
announcing that it was on the menu.
Such claims aside, this dessert re
quires one presidential advisor
which, after the puppet strings have
been removed, must be prepared
very, even extremely, right.
Chocolate Ron Rons
This piece de resistance includes
an aging B-movie actor who occupies
the most complex and powerful posi
tion in the world. Some chefs claim
that this dish, though it has a certain
superficial attraction, lacks in any
worthwhile substance. Others argue
that there is no superficial attraction.
Most connoisseurs agree, however,
that it lacks the depth, balance,
flavor, and understanding of the
complexity of fine food that makes
for a superb creation. Sorry to disap
point you, but it seems that American
cuisine is to remain second-rate for
some time to come.

Hegg's Alexander
This delicacy is sure to become a
world-wide favorite. Though the
$1,000,000 defense spending that is
required to prepare this dish is too
expensive for some tastes, its radio-
