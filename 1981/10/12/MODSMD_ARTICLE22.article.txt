## Pre-meds must be more than narrow-minded scientists 
### 
This is for the hundreds of students who consider
themselves to be pre-med. Now I know about how
groveling and sniveling pre-meds are supposed to be,
and how narrow-minded. I know how wrong this all is.
And also the degree of truth it contains. The dimunitive
feelings and other such scare tactics you experience
abound by the existence of this facade, but you still en
deavor to "Oh, help people," or "Get bucks," or what
ever reason it is you choose to defend yourself. That
same facade keeps you from seeing the reality as well.
For I also know that science is your only concern; you
know it all, intend to know more, and hate wasting your
time on anything like Westure Culture or other similar
poppy-rot. Unfortunately, I have some bad news for you.
Medicine is not a science.
You heard me, and keep reading for your own good.
The idea behind writing a column is to share your
thoughts and experiences to those on their way. I have
had my experiences and these are my thoughts. I am of
fering an advantage, and you are bound to find out
sooner or later what I am addressing.
This past summer I was employed in an Emergency
Room and was given the opportunity to view the total
spectrum of medicine. From the crying child to the
gomer, from the sprained ankle to the full arrest, I re
alized the importance of how we hold our thoughts as
students today for tomorrow grows from it. Stopping a
child from crying, and sometimes being the cause, smiles
or tears from the aged, bringing to full life that
myocardial infarction and relating to the family what has
occurred — this certainly, is not science.
I am not saying that you do not need Organic

Chemistry or Vertebrate Biology; they are indeed essen
tial. But you need more of something "other," and it is
that-"other" which allows you to practice with people
you meet everyday, and not with biological units.
What should that "other" be? Service; a sempiternal
commitment to service. Guesstimation; there is never a
day without an hour of uncertainty. Learning the flesh
and blood of what cannot come from a text. Knowing
just where to put the "X," a precision in practice based
on a strong foundation of that essential scientific knowl
edge. Understanding what the patient is experiencing as
well as understanding what is left to be honestly misun
derstood. Exercising one's strong personal morality and
belief, or an ethic. Psychology, simply knowing the
uniqueness of each human situation. And art, a particu
lar skill in practice.
Of course these do not apply to all branches of medi
cine, but some to all, and all to some. It is very far from
knowing the arrangement of microtubules in cilia or the
steps in DNA replication. The practice of medicine in
volves the study of the human as primarily a feeling,
thinking individual, and only secondarily as the
biological unit I have mentioned.
Is this really what you are going to grovel and snivel for
four years to get a chance to do? My answer to you
"Don't." Humanity does not need any more of those
kinds of doctors. If what I have said has interested you,
stand up straight and hold on to your concern, never let
go, there are too many beasties on the road that can lead
you astray. Be careful and be concerned.

Of course these do not apply to all branches of medi
cine, but some to all, and all to some. It is very far from
knowing the arrangement of microtubules in cilia or the
steps in DNA replication. The practice of medicine in
volves the study of the human as primarily a feeling,
thinking individual, and only secondarily as the
biological unit I have mentioned.
Is this really what you are going to grovel and snivel for
four years to get a chance to do? My answer to you
"Don't." Humanity does not need any more of those
kinds of doctors. If what I have said has interested you,
stand up straight and hold on to your concern, never let
go, there are too many beasties on the road that can lead
you astray. Be careful and be concerned.
