## Video games become habit-forming 
### 
As you first step into the Recrea
tional Center, sounds of lasers blast
ing, missiles whistling, and bombs ex
ploding amid a drone of low-toned
buzzers and soft bells begin filling
your ears. Those of us who play im
mediately recognize that, to the left
where a dollar bill exchanger
ominously stands, therein lies the
game room. Inside, like walking into
a small casino, you'll find a long row
of video-games and the more old
fashioned type of pinball machine
with the silver ball. It doesn't matter
which one you choose. Once you
start playing, you're caught. Not until
they have robbed you of all the sin
gles in your pocketbook do you final
ly give up and walk out frustrated be
cause you failed to score enough
points to get that extra ship or win
that free game.
There is a great variety of video
games out right now and new types
coming in all the time, all of them just
waiting to steal your quarters. We
old-timers who first became
(enamoured) with "Space Invaders"
and "Asteroids" several years ago
have since seen a flood of new Atari
and Midway contraptons swamp the
pizza places, game rooms, barrooms,
and airports across the country. In
any place where you might have to
wait, or where you might idle for any
period of time do they innocent
stand — just waiting to blow you out
of space, or destroy your planet. Just
one quarter and you're hooked; and
you won't leave until you show that
stupid machine who's smarter. But
you inevitably walkaway furious with
yourself for spending all the money
you just discovered is missing. Occa
sionally glaring back at the machine,
you might shake your head, still in to
tal disbelief that you actually moved
your ship directly into the enemy fire
14 times in a row.
Many times I've walked into a
game room and saw faces gripped
with intensity glowing red or green
from the screen's light, absorbed in

trying to save humanity. Above the
machines' uneven music and sound
effects you hear familiar gasps like,
"Shoot! I needed only 2000 more
points!" "Damn! Those guys never
attacked that way before!" or "no
one could score that much! There is
no possible way!"
The first shock a beginner receives
is how hard it is to score a lot of
points. When I first visited the game
room here last fall, I though I was a
pretty skillfull pilot, especially with
Galaxians; after all, I had once scored
over 8000 points on that game. My
esteem quickly wilted when, after
confidently sticking a quarter into
the slot, I looked up to see how many

chine who's smarter. But you inevitably walk

points I needed to beat the high
score: 89,000 points! I was flab
bergasted — it wasn't humanly pos
sible to score that much! But I
learned it could be done and I dis
covered the secret to success.
Precision. That's all it takes and the
only way to get it is by practice. Once
you "master" a machine, you can lit
erally spend more than an hour, or
how ever long your eyes can hold
out, playing on a single quarter.
There are of course several draw
backs. One, depending on how fast
you catch on, it will probably take
close to twenty bucks or more to be
come a master. The second catch is
that once you do become good, the
game loses its challenge, and its ap
peal. So why play at all? After all the
effort, the only thing to show for your
mastery is your score posted daily on
the screen as the high score, or at
best your initials next to your
phenomenal figure. Obviously, this
alone cannot possibly account for

the mysterious allure the games hold."
I guess, like most habits, you do it fori
no particular reason at all.
The popularity of these video-;
games is undeniable. Last fall, therec
were no more than four or five;
videogames in all here, plus a long/
largely ignored row of pinball ma
chines. Since then, starting with Mis
sile Command, a whole parade ot
new games have arrived, and so have
the new crowds of addicts. Last
spring, the whole game room was re-*
done and made more appealing;
which is probably why many newer
video-games at that time upped their
ante to 50 cents a play. In addition,
just recently all but five of the ob?

solete pinball machines have beeri
dumped, like black and white tele
vision and non-digital watches. In
their place, along with a few ancients
like "Galaxions" and "Space In
vaders," are such enticing video
newcomers as "Defender" "Super
Cobra" and "Scramble."
This fall I went into the Game
Room resolutely decided not to play
any of the new quarter-snatchers. Iny
stead, I opted for the more mild
mannered easy pinball machine
which I'd be sure to master in no time
at all. But today, after playing one of
these innocent monsters, I walked
dejectedly back to my dorm. With
head bowed, I sullenly wondered
what the odds were of having all
three silver balls sail midway be
tween my paddles after coming off
the same two bumpers six games in a
row. Maybe I should be rational and
quit.
