## In search of affordable, acceptable off-campus housing

Food, clothing, and shelter. These are the
three basic elements of survival; the basic
! needs which must be filled if mankind is to
) prevail against the forces of nature.
■ Throughout the course of human history, we
find examples of the sad consequences
which follow when this basic tenet is ig
nored. Anthropologists tell us of Homo
; patheticus, a nudist, meadow-dwelling tribe
which flourished briefly in the early
Copacetic era, in an area which later became
southern California. Without caves to hide in
or clothes to protect them, they were quickly
- annihilated by their rivals, Homo
phlintstonicus, the "caveman" with which
we are all familiar.
! Given that shelter is a basic need of man
kind, other questions arise. For instance,
■ what is more important, the quality of the
shelter, or the quantity, (i.e. size) of the
| shelter? Could Homo patheticus have sur
vived even without clothes if only he had
lived in caves with winter-summer climate
1 control and an all-electric kitchen (AEK)?
i Could he have survived in a phone booth
with a space heater (util inc)? And can
modern man survive under the same condi
tions as Homo phlintstonicus, or has conve
! nient modern living spoiled him to the point

where wall to wall carpet (w-w cpt) has be
come a necessity, not a luxury? While we are
millions of years too late to save Homo
patheticus, we can examine the fate of the
hapless caveman's modern day equivalent,
the college student. Join us now, as we go In
Search Of: off-campus housing.

We centered our search around the
Silicon Valley area of California, home of
thousands of Stanford University students.
As we probed deeper into the soft white un
derbelly of the local housing situation, a few
basic questions came up again and again.
Why were all the apartments built next to
trains and freeways, and under Air Force ap
proach patterns? What made a converted ga
rage, shared with a small business, worth
$250 a month? Did raiding parties from East
Palo Alto really cross the San Francisquito
Creek at night to steal car batteries and

dance in the streets? What was the strange
hold that female med-school students had
on landlords to compel them to rent them
rooms? Which came first, the chicken or his
credit rating? And when does one cease to
be an adult and start to be a mere student
again? To find the answers to these and other
impudent questions, we talked to several
area landlords.
Bernice Popadopoulas came to Palo Alto
in 1959 from Manchester, New Hampshire.
She owns an assortment of apartment houses
and condominiums, and also rents out her
converted garage and a back room of her
house. We listened in as she talked to a pros
pective student tenant: "... now you can
use the kitchen, but you can't use the oven
or the refrigerator, and you have to be done
by five o'clock, so I can start Herman's din
ner. You can't have visitors after eight
o'clock, and we don't like visitors of the op
posite sex, period. Herman goes to bed ear
ly, so no phone calls after ten o'clock, either.
Now if you still want to see the garage apart
ment, too, just follow me. Dont't mind that
racket, it's just the train, you'll get used to it.
Now this is the living room, and over there
behind the hot water tank is the bathroom.
There's no kitchen, but there's a sink over
there behind He r man's '47 DeSoto. So if you
want it, asastudentyoursecuritydepositwill
be four times the monthly rent, so that's four
times $275, or $1100. All ri*ht? "
After we left Mrs. Popadopoulas, we trav
eled to the ill-named municipality of Moun
tain View, where we met Leonard. Leonard
used to be a chemist, but was not interested
in discussing with us what he does now. We

had arranged previously to meet Leonard at
one of the many small apartments which he
owns and maintains. Peering out from be
hind the heavy bars over the kitchen win
dow, Leonard greeted us and invited us in.
We began by asking Leonard about the
neighborhood: "Well, I used to live here
with my wife, and the first week after we
moved in, we were robbed! That's when I
put the bars up over the windows. Since then
we haven't had any break-ins, but they do
like to steal car batteries, so you should keep
your hood chained shut. Now if what you're
looking for is a really quiet spot, I just bought
this new place and I'm in the process of evict
ing the old tenants. The old manager didn't
take care of the place at all, I mean the p/00l
was just green. They're spraying for bugs

Inspired by the historical precedent of the 1930'5, some
grad students propose to set up a tent city In White
Plaza... Thus, If the housing situation does not Improve,
Stanford may soon have Its very own Hoovervllle.

there right now, but if you want to see it
tomorrow, I'll be there working all after
noon."
Finally, we attempted to see an apartment
in a quiet residential area of Menlo Park,
owned by Mr. and Mrs. A. Whitney. The
Whitneys, however, proved to be very selec
tive indeed, and refused to show it to us. The
Whitneys make it a policy to only rent to
female med-school students, preferably
married ones.
Discouraged with the prospects of ever

finding off-campus housing, we turned to
Stanford Uiversity officials for help. What
bold new plans were they formulating to al
leviate the commuting students' distress?
Surprisingly, although a new dormitory with
the capacity to house 800 undergraduates
will soon be constructed, there are no plans
for additional graduate student housing. As
more people continue to migrate to the
Silicon Valley seeking employment, the
housing market can only be expeoted to
grow tighter.
Apparently, our search has failed. How
ever, as we end our quest, there is one en
couraging rumor which we will pass on. It
seems that some students, angered by what
they perceive as the University's indif
ference, are on the verge of vigilante action.

Inspired by the historical precedent of the
1930'5, they propose to set up a tent city in
White Plaza. This community would not only
fill the needs of a great many students and
their families, but the tents would alsd blend
right in esthetically with the street vendors
who normally inhabit the area. Thus, if the
housing situation does not improve, Stan
ford may soon have its very own Hoovterville.

or the refrigerator, and you have to be done
by five o'clock, so I can start Herman's din

After we left Mrs. Popadopoulas, we trav
eled to the ill-named municipality of Moun
tain View, where we met Leonard. Leonard
used to be a chemist, but was not interested
in discussing with us what he does now. We

had arranged previously to meet Leonard at
one of the many small apartments which he
owns and maintains. Peering out from be
hind the heavy bars over the kitchen win
dow, Leonard greeted us and invited us in.
We began by asking Leonard about the
neighborhood: "Well, I used to live here
with my wife, and the first week after we
moved in, we were robbed! That's when I
put the bars up over the windows. Since then
we haven't had any break-ins, but they do
like to steal car batteries, so you should keep
your hood chained shut. Now if what you're
looking for is a really quiet spot, I just bought
this new place and I'm in the process of evict

take care of the place at all, I mean the p/00l

tomorrow, I'll be there working all after

Finally, we attempted to see an apartment
in a quiet residential area of Menlo Park,
owned by Mr. and Mrs. A. Whitney. The
Whitneys, however, proved to be very selec
tive indeed, and refused to show it to us. The
Whitneys make it a policy to only rent to
female med-school students, preferably
married ones.
Discouraged with the prospects of ever

finding off-campus housing, we turned to
Stanford Uiversity officials for help. What
bold new plans were they formulating to al
leviate the commuting students' distress?
Surprisingly, although a new dormitory with
the capacity to house 800 undergraduates
will soon be constructed, there are no plans
for additional graduate student housing. As
more people continue to migrate to the
Silicon Valley seeking employment, the
housing market can only be expeoted to
grow tighter.
Apparently, our search has failed. How
ever, as we end our quest, there is one en

seems that some students, angered by what
they perceive as the University's indif

basic questions came up again and again.

$250 a month? Did raiding parties from East
Palo Alto really cross the San Francisquito

hold that female med-school students had
on landlords to compel them to rent them
rooms? Which came first, the chicken or his
credit rating? And when does one cease to
be an adult and start to be a mere student
again? To find the answers to these and other

Food, clothing, and shelter. These are the
three basic elements of survival; the basic
! needs which must be filled if mankind is to
) prevail against the forces of nature.
■ Throughout the course of human history, we
find examples of the sad consequences
which follow when this basic tenet is ig
nored. Anthropologists tell us of Homo
; patheticus, a nudist, meadow-dwelling tribe
which flourished briefly in the early
Copacetic era, in an area which later became
southern California. Without caves to hide in
or clothes to protect them, they were quickly
- annihilated by their rivals, Homo
phlintstonicus, the "caveman" with which
we are all familiar.
! Given that shelter is a basic need of man
kind, other questions arise. For instance,
■ what is more important, the quality of the
shelter, or the quantity, (i.e. size) of the
| shelter? Could Homo patheticus have sur
vived even without clothes if only he had
lived in caves with winter-summer climate
1 control and an all-electric kitchen (AEK)?
i Could he have survived in a phone booth
with a space heater (util inc)? And can
modern man survive under the same condi
tions as Homo phlintstonicus, or has conve
! nient modern living spoiled him to the point

where wall to wall carpet (w-w cpt) has be
come a necessity, not a luxury? While we are
millions of years too late to save Homo
patheticus, we can examine the fate of the
hapless caveman's modern day equivalent,
the college student. Join us now, as we go In
Search Of: off-campus housing.

We centered our search around the
Silicon Valley area of California, home of
thousands of Stanford University students.
As we probed deeper into the soft white un
derbelly of the local housing situation, a few
basic questions came up again and again.
Why were all the apartments built next to
trains and freeways, and under Air Force ap
proach patterns? What made a converted ga
rage, shared with a small business, worth
$250 a month? Did raiding parties from East
Palo Alto really cross the San Francisquito
Creek at night to steal car batteries and

dance in the streets? What was the strange
hold that female med-school students had
on landlords to compel them to rent them
rooms? Which came first, the chicken or his
credit rating? And when does one cease to
be an adult and start to be a mere student
again? To find the answers to these and other
impudent questions, we talked to several
area landlords.
Bernice Popadopoulas came to Palo Alto
in 1959 from Manchester, New Hampshire.
She owns an assortment of apartment houses
and condominiums, and also rents out her
converted garage and a back room of her
house. We listened in as she talked to a pros
pective student tenant: "... now you can
use the kitchen, but you can't use the oven
or the refrigerator, and you have to be done
by five o'clock, so I can start Herman's din
ner. You can't have visitors after eight
o'clock, and we don't like visitors of the op
posite sex, period. Herman goes to bed ear
ly, so no phone calls after ten o'clock, either.
Now if you still want to see the garage apart
ment, too, just follow me. Dont't mind that
racket, it's just the train, you'll get used to it.
Now this is the living room, and over there
behind the hot water tank is the bathroom.
There's no kitchen, but there's a sink over
there behind He r man's '47 DeSoto. So if you
want it, asastudentyoursecuritydepositwill
be four times the monthly rent, so that's four
times $275, or $1100. All ri*ht? "
After we left Mrs. Popadopoulas, we trav
eled to the ill-named municipality of Moun
tain View, where we met Leonard. Leonard
used to be a chemist, but was not interested
in discussing with us what he does now. We

had arranged previously to meet Leonard at
one of the many small apartments which he
owns and maintains. Peering out from be
hind the heavy bars over the kitchen win
dow, Leonard greeted us and invited us in.
We began by asking Leonard about the
neighborhood: "Well, I used to live here
with my wife, and the first week after we
moved in, we were robbed! That's when I
put the bars up over the windows. Since then
we haven't had any break-ins, but they do
like to steal car batteries, so you should keep
your hood chained shut. Now if what you're
looking for is a really quiet spot, I just bought
this new place and I'm in the process of evict
ing the old tenants. The old manager didn't
take care of the place at all, I mean the p/00l
was just green. They're spraying for bugs

there right now, but if you want to see it
tomorrow, I'll be there working all after
noon."
Finally, we attempted to see an apartment
in a quiet residential area of Menlo Park,
owned by Mr. and Mrs. A. Whitney. The
Whitneys, however, proved to be very selec
tive indeed, and refused to show it to us. The
Whitneys make it a policy to only rent to
female med-school students, preferably
married ones.
Discouraged with the prospects of ever

finding off-campus housing, we turned to
Stanford Uiversity officials for help. What
bold new plans were they formulating to al
leviate the commuting students' distress?
Surprisingly, although a new dormitory with
the capacity to house 800 undergraduates
