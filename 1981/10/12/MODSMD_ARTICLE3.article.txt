# Congressman addresses 'new' constituents
## Lantos attacks Reagan administration 
### Tim Lundergan 
First-term Democratic Con
gressman Tom Lantos, into whose
district Stanford and adjacent com
munities will fall following redisrict
ing, declared "the honeymoon is
over" between Congress and the
Reagan administration in speeches
Saturday in Palo Alto and East Palo
Alto.
An AWACS sale opponent, Lantos
criticized Republican pleas for unity
in foreign affairs.
"Government is not based on the
principle that Papa knows best," he
said, noting that blind support for a
president led to disastrous involve
ment in Vietnam following passage
of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in
1965.

Lantos assailed the "nefarious
schemes" of Interior Secretary James
Watt, particularly his efforts to permit
oil exploration off the California
coast.
"This man will not rest," Lantos
warned. "I am convinced we will face
him over and over again."
The former San Franscisco State ec
onomics professor accused budget
director David Stockman of "ar
rogantly frightening" the elderly
with "irresponsible statements" in an
attempt to scare Congress into cut
ting Social Security benefits. Lantos
said the Reagan economic plan had
lost the support of Wall Street. He
criticized cutbacks in the "most pro
ductive form of investment," educa
tion.

During a question and answer ses
sion in Palo Alto, Lantos claimed the
New Right had targeted him for"po
litical extinction." He accused con
servative interest groups of conduct
ing a smear campaign against him.
Referring to a letter published in the
Sept. 24 San Mateo Times accusing
him of visiting Castro's Cuba at tax
payers' expense, Lantos said, "I have
never been to Cuba."
In East Palo Alto, the congressman
said the Times should have checked
the facts before publishing the letter.
Lantos suggested much of the admin
istration's success has occurred be
cause much of the press has been
swept up in a conservative tide.
The Hungarian-born Lantos, the
only survivor of the Holocaust to

serve in the U.S. Congress, stressed
his commitment to human rights,
noting that he had lived under both
fascist and communist regimes.
Last Monday, President Ronald
Reagan signed Lantos's first legisla
tive act, making an honorary U.S.
citizen of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swe
dish diplomat who rescued 100,000
European Jews, including Lantos and
his wife Annette from the Nazis in
World War 11. The Russians arrested
Walenberg as a spy in 1945 and say he
died in prison. Making Wallenberg
an honorary citizen, an honor ac
corded previously only to Sir
Winston Churchill, should give the
State Department more influence in
