# Congressman addresses 'new' constituents
## Lantos attacks Reagan administration 
### Tim Lundergan 
First-term Democratic Con
gressman Tom Lantos, into whose
district Stanford and adjacent com
munities will fall following redisrict
ing, declared "the honeymoon is
over" between Congress and the
Reagan administration in speeches
Saturday in Palo Alto and East Palo
Alto.
An AWACS sale opponent, Lantos
criticized Republican pleas for unity
in foreign affairs.
"Government is not based on the
principle that Papa knows best," he
said, noting that blind support for a
president led to disastrous involve
ment in Vietnam following passage
of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in
1965.

Lantos assailed the "nefarious
schemes" of Interior Secretary James
Watt, particularly his efforts to permit
oil exploration off the California
coast.
"This man will not rest," Lantos
warned. "I am convinced we will face
him over and over again."
The former San Franscisco State ec
onomics professor accused budget
director David Stockman of "ar
rogantly frightening" the elderly
with "irresponsible statements" in an
attempt to scare Congress into cut
ting Social Security benefits. Lantos
said the Reagan economic plan had
lost the support of Wall Street. He
criticized cutbacks in the "most pro
ductive form of investment," educa
tion.

During a question and answer ses
sion in Palo Alto, Lantos claimed the
New Right had targeted him for"po
litical extinction." He accused con
servative interest groups of conduct
ing a smear campaign against him.
Referring to a letter published in the
Sept. 24 San Mateo Times accusing
him of visiting Castro's Cuba at tax
payers' expense, Lantos said, "I have
never been to Cuba."
In East Palo Alto, the congressman
said the Times should have checked
the facts before publishing the letter.
Lantos suggested much of the admin
istration's success has occurred be
cause much of the press has been
swept up in a conservative tide.
The Hungarian-born Lantos, the
only survivor of the Holocaust to

serve in the U.S. Congress, stressed
his commitment to human rights,
noting that he had lived under both
fascist and communist regimes.
Last Monday, President Ronald
Reagan signed Lantos's first legisla
tive act, making an honorary U.S.
citizen of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swe
dish diplomat who rescued 100,000
European Jews, including Lantos and
his wife Annette from the Nazis in
World War 11. The Russians arrested
Walenberg as a spy in 1945 and say he
died in prison. Making Wallenberg
an honorary citizen, an honor ac
corded previously only to Sir
Winston Churchill, should give the
State Department more influence in

NEW CONSTITUENCY â€” Congressman Tom Lantos spoke with East
Palo Alto residents last Saturday. Due to the Democratic redisrict
ing plan, Lantos loses constituents from Daly City, and becomes the
representative of people in the Palo Alto area.
determing if Wallenberg is still alive.
Stanford, Palo Alto, and East Palo
Alto have been taken from Re
publican Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
12th congressional district and
shifted to Lantos' 11th district by Cali
fornia's Democrat-controlled legisla
ture. Lantos in turn has lost 70,000
Daly City voters to Democratic Rep.
Philip Burton to the north.
In East Palo Alto, Lantos said the re
districting process was undertaken
after the 1980 Census indicated an in
crease in California's population cor
responding to an increae in con
gressional representation from 43 to
45 members. Changes in political
boundaries will go into effect in Jan
uary, 1983. Saturday's "town meet

ings" in Palo Alto and East Palo Alto
were designed to acquaint voters
with the congressman.
In Palo Alto's Lucie Stern Center,
about 70 people listened as Lantos
was introduced by California As
semblyman and Stanford Law pro
fessor Byron Sher.
The congressman's speech was in
terrupted by applause seven times as
he lashed the Reagan administration.
He proposed bills to allow potential
homeowners to set aside income for
a tax-free down payment. He is also
sponsoring an anti-crime bill in

linking good relations with opium
producing countries to their efforts
to reduce heroin exports.
In his Eastern European accent,

Lantos told the mostly black au
dience, "I grew up with discrimina
tion (and) as a second class citizen."
He described himself as a follower of
Hubert Humphery, vowing to better
the condition of the young, sick, and
aged. He criticized the Reagan ad
ministration for cutting back on
school lunches while shipping wheat
and butter to the Soviet Union. The
fifteen minute speech was inter
rupted four times by applause.
Later a questioner took issue with
Lantos' strong pro-Israel stance and
asked about Palestinian rights. Lantos
accused Saudi Arabia of allowing the
Palestinians to become a "political
football" instead of using their vast
wealth to improve the refugees' con
dition.

In response to another human
rights question, Lantos said he fa
vored screening Haitian boat people
to determine if they were political or
economic refugees.
Ruben Abrica of the Committee
Against U.S. Intervention in Central
America said he preferred Mc-
Closkey to Lantos on the El Salvador
issue. McCloskey has said he favors
cutting off all aid to the Duarte re
gime.
East Palo Alto "Mayor" Barbara
Mouton said she originally sup
ported Lantos because of her opposi
tion to the Republican incumbent
Bill Royer. She said her "peripheral"
knowledge of Lantos had been favor
ably reinforced by what she heard
Saturday.
