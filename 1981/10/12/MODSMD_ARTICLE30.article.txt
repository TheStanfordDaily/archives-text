# Market's calm worrying investors
## 
### 
New York — The stock market has taken
the news of Anwar Sadat's assassination
with a degree of calm that surprised many
analysts.
On Tuesday, as word spread that the
Egyptian president had been killed, gold
prices briefly shot upward. Investors con
cerned about the impact on energy poli
tics scrambled to buy U.S. oil stocks.
But otherwise, individual investors and
fund managers — the latter a group often
criticized for their alleged tendency to
panic in emotional moments — made no
dramatic response.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped a modest3.6l pointson the day in
relatively light trading. The next day, it
began a rally that left the market with its
second consecutive weekly gain.
Investors, like everyone else, have had
plenty of experience lately coping with the
shocks of attacks on prominent world fig
ures.
On March 30, the major exchanges

closed about 40 minutes early after Presi
dent Ronald Reagan was shot. The Dow
Jones industrial average dropped 2.62
points.ln the following session, it re
bounded almost 12 points on word that
Reagan was recovering.
Less than seven weeks later, on May 13,
when Pope John Paul II was wounded at
the Vatican, the Dow dropped 3.06.
But few analysts were ready toargue that
familiarity with the phenomenon alone
could have diminished the emotional im
pact of the attack on Sadat. "It's a grim
day," said one broker as he watched finan
cial news wires hour-by-hour Tuesday.
By Wednesday, analysts said investors
seemed to hope for a smooth transition in
Egypt, and pleased with their initial im
pressions of Sadat's prospective successor,
Hosni Mubarak, who quickly declared his
intention to continue Sadat's policies.
In the eyes of some observers, the be
havior of the market stood as evidence that
news events, however stunning, often
evoke less dramatic responses from in-

vestors than casual observers might ex
pect.
When there is a response, brokers said, it
often proves fleeting. Nov. 5, for example,
the Dow jumped almost 16 points after
Reagan's landslide victory. The next day it
gave up all of that and more.
Some analysts took the market's behav
ior Tuesday as a bullish sign. "Apparently
the weak holders, the nervous types who
might have sold on this news, have already
bailed out," one broker theorized.
But others, more puzzled than pleased
by the absence of a selloff, were not so
sure. They questioned whether the market
had fully faced the issue of the loss of a val
uable U.S. ally and world leader.
Lan McAvity, a Toronto investment ad
viser, called the His
market letter read: "The loss of a pillar of
peace, and heightened uncertainties, pro
duces that worst combination of emotions,
anger and fear — which is not good for
markets."
