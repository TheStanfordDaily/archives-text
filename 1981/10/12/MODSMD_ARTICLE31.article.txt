# Former presidents Ford, Carter discuss Mideast
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,
once strong political rivals at home, are united as
former presidents about the necessity for the
United States to talk directly to the Palestine Lib
eration Organization as a way of advancing
Middle East peace prospects.
In the aftermath of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's assassination, the 38th and 39th presi
dents of the United States also find themselves in
broad agreement on other critical Mideast ques
tions and closer to each other as men who once
occupied the White House.
They frankly expressed strong feelings about
major players in the explosive Mideast drama,
particularly Libya's Moammar Khadafy. Carter
says Khadafy "in some ways is subhuman." Ford
calls him "a bully" who "in my judgment is a
cancer on that part of the globe."
These views emerged in an extraordinary set
ting Saturday night, on their flight back from
Sadat's funeral in Cairo. The other former presi
dent in the funeral delegation, Richard Nixon,
had flown on to Saudi Arabia for a private visit.
Ford and Carter voiced hopes the time may be
right for dramatic moves in the Mideast.
Ford specifically raised the prospect of Israel
accelerating the timetable for return to Egypt of
captured territory in the Sinai desert."It would
be a great step forward," he said, "if by any
chance there could be a moving up of the giving
back of the Sinai to Egypt earlier than the April
date ... whether it was one month or two
months earlier than the deadline" called for in
the Israel-Egypt peace treaty growing out of the
Camp David accords.
They indicated private conversations about
that possibility took place with Prime Minister
Menachem Begin of Israel during Sadat's funer
al. But they do not want to comment specifically
on the discussions.
The two former president's thoughts on the
intensely controversial U.S. role regarding the
Palestine Liberation Organization probably will
draw the most attention.
Egypt's Sadat had urged that the United States
talk directly with the PLO. The Ford adminis
tration had established a commitment not to ne
gotiate with the PLO until that organization for
mally recognized Israel's right to exist, and the
Carter administration reaffirmed it.
"At some point that has to happen," Ford said
in response to a question about direct U.S.-PLO
talks.
"I would not want to pick the date today, but
in a realistic way that dialogue has to take place
.. . There are some responsible preconditions
and it may need some negotiations as to their at
titute vis-a-vis Israel.. . and it may take some ac
tions by Israel vis-a-vis the PLO. But as you go
down the road at some point dialogue has to
take place, and I think that will happen."
Carter replied:
"There is no way for Israel ever to have an as
sured permanent peace without resolving the
Palestinian issue .... So I think Jerry is certainly

right in saying these discussions have to be done.
The problem is the recognition of the PLO a
political entity by the United States before the
Palestinians are willing to acknowledge that Is
rael is a nation that has a right to exist. So any
mechanism that could be found to that wowld
resolve that difficulty would be a very successful
step forward."
They began their interview by drawing per
sonal lessons from Sadat's death, and the ex
perience they just were completing as special
American emissaries for the present president.
Ford said:
"I know of no person that I've known among
world leaders who has done more specifically,
that I'm familiar with, in enhancing peace than
President Sadat."
And Carter said:
"I've known about 100 heads of state since I've
been in public life. I place Sadat at the top of all
of them in personal courage and a strategic
sense of what was good for his region and how. to
impress the world .. . Neither I, nor Jerry Ford,
nor Henry Kissinger, nor any other American
leader could visualize in our fondest dreams the
success that would result from Sadat's peace in
itiative."
He and Carter are hopeful that moderate Arab
leadership can be appealed to in taking new
steps to accelerate the Mideast peace process.
As Ford puts it:
".. .If they're given the opportunity, they will
disengage themselves from the radicals and be
come a part of the initial effort President Sadat
started with his very brave, his very visionary ef
fort that resulted in the process going as far as it
has."
At the end of the conversation, the presidents
reflected on another, more personal, process
that has been at work since Sadat's death: on the
role of former presidents.
Ford:
"I believe this example of President Carter,
President Nixon and myself participating in a
mission, which I believe was in the best interests
of the United States, is an excellent example of
how former presidents can be brought back into
service. I believe thatthe relationship that Jimmy
and Dick Nixon and I established on this mission
convinces us that we can be so utilized."
Carter: ,
"I don't think anyone who has not served
there can adequately appreciate the continuity
of problems and challenges and decisions. The
things that Jerry Ford decided when he was in of
fice affected me daily. Even the things that Harry
Truman decided 30 years before I went Into of
fice affected me daily. You can make mod
ifications of a previous president's policies, but
there is a stream of decisions and ideals and
goals and hopes and dreams and problems and
disappointments that transcend the identity-, of
the president in the Oval Office. They come
from the American people themselves. We
share that. Also, for former presidents we share a
lot."

".. .If they're given the opportunity, they will
disengage themselves from the radicals and be
come a part of the initial effort President Sadat
started with his very brave, his very visionary ef
fort that resulted in the process going as far as it
has."
At the end of the conversation, the presidents
reflected on another, more personal, process
that has been at work since Sadat's death: on the
role of former presidents.
Ford:
"I believe this example of President Carter,
President Nixon and myself participating in a
mission, which I believe was in the best interests
of the United States, is an excellent example of
how former presidents can be brought back into
service. I believe thatthe relationship that Jimmy
and Dick Nixon and I established on this mission
convinces us that we can be so utilized."
Carter: ,
"I don't think anyone who has not served
there can adequately appreciate the continuity
of problems and challenges and decisions. The
things that Jerry Ford decided when he was in of
fice affected me daily. Even the things that Harry
Truman decided 30 years before I went Into of
fice affected me daily. You can make mod
ifications of a previous president's policies, but
there is a stream of decisions and ideals and
goals and hopes and dreams and problems and
disappointments that transcend the identity-, of
the president in the Oval Office. They come
from the American people themselves. We
share that. Also, for former presidents we share a
lot."
Washington — Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,
once strong political rivals at home, are united as
former presidents about the necessity for the
United States to talk directly to the Palestine Lib
eration Organization as a way of advancing
Middle East peace prospects.
In the aftermath of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's assassination, the 38th and 39th presi
dents of the United States also find themselves in
broad agreement on other critical Mideast ques
tions and closer to each other as men who once
occupied the White House.
They frankly expressed strong feelings about
major players in the explosive Mideast drama,
particularly Libya's Moammar Khadafy. Carter
says Khadafy "in some ways is subhuman." Ford
calls him "a bully" who "in my judgment is a
cancer on that part of the globe."
These views emerged in an extraordinary set
ting Saturday night, on their flight back from
Sadat's funeral in Cairo. The other former presi
dent in the funeral delegation, Richard Nixon,
had flown on to Saudi Arabia for a private visit.
Ford and Carter voiced hopes the time may be
right for dramatic moves in the Mideast.
Ford specifically raised the prospect of Israel
accelerating the timetable for return to Egypt of
captured territory in the Sinai desert."It would
be a great step forward," he said, "if by any
chance there could be a moving up of the giving
back of the Sinai to Egypt earlier than the April
date ... whether it was one month or two
months earlier than the deadline" called for in
the Israel-Egypt peace treaty growing out of the
Camp David accords.
They indicated private conversations about
that possibility took place with Prime Minister
Menachem Begin of Israel during Sadat's funer
al. But they do not want to comment specifically
on the discussions.
The two former president's thoughts on the
intensely controversial U.S. role regarding the
Palestine Liberation Organization probably will
draw the most attention.
Egypt's Sadat had urged that the United States
talk directly with the PLO. The Ford adminis
tration had established a commitment not to ne
gotiate with the PLO until that organization for
mally recognized Israel's right to exist, and the
Carter administration reaffirmed it.
"At some point that has to happen," Ford said
in response to a question about direct U.S.-PLO
talks.
"I would not want to pick the date today, but
in a realistic way that dialogue has to take place
.. . There are some responsible preconditions
and it may need some negotiations as to their at
titute vis-a-vis Israel.. . and it may take some ac
tions by Israel vis-a-vis the PLO. But as you go
down the road at some point dialogue has to
take place, and I think that will happen."
Carter replied:
"There is no way for Israel ever to have an as
sured permanent peace without resolving the
Palestinian issue .... So I think Jerry is certainly

right in saying these discussions have to be done.
The problem is the recognition of the PLO a
political entity by the United States before the
Palestinians are willing to acknowledge that Is
rael is a nation that has a right to exist. So any
mechanism that could be found to that wowld
resolve that difficulty would be a very successful
step forward."
They began their interview by drawing per
sonal lessons from Sadat's death, and the ex
perience they just were completing as special
American emissaries for the present president.
Ford said:
"I know of no person that I've known among
world leaders who has done more specifically,
that I'm familiar with, in enhancing peace than
President Sadat."
And Carter said:
"I've known about 100 heads of state since I've
been in public life. I place Sadat at the top of all
of them in personal courage and a strategic
sense of what was good for his region and how. to
impress the world .. . Neither I, nor Jerry Ford,
nor Henry Kissinger, nor any other American
leader could visualize in our fondest dreams the
success that would result from Sadat's peace in
itiative."
He and Carter are hopeful that moderate Arab
leadership can be appealed to in taking new
steps to accelerate the Mideast peace process.
As Ford puts it:
".. .If they're given the opportunity, they will
disengage themselves from the radicals and be
come a part of the initial effort President Sadat
