# Mormon church purchases T.V. communications network
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Salt Lake City —The Mormon
Church has ordered 500 satel
lite receiver dishes to establish
what is believed will be the
largest television network via
satellite in the world.
The primary and immediate
purpose is to ensure that
church members gathered at
U.S. stake (diocese) centers
outside of Utah will be able to
see the proceedings of the
semi-annual General Con
ference and other major
church meetings in Salt Lake
City.
But church leaders are talk
ing about a variety of future
uses, including education pro
grams from the headquarters
of the fast-growing Church of
Jesus Christ of the Latter-day
Saints.

"Communication is the
sinew that binds the church as
one family," said Gordon
Hinckley of the church's First
Presidency in commenting on
the planned system recently.
Hinckley said the network is
hoped to be fully installed
within 18 months.
The purchase, for an un
disclosed price, represents at
the least the largest single or
der for a single television
network, according to officials
for Bonneville Satellite Corp.,
which aided negotiations for
the church, and Scientific At
lanta, the manufacturer.
There are larger radio, audio
and data networks using satel
lites for relaying transmissions,
said Bruce Hough, Bonneville
vice president, but he believes
none larger for television.

Each receiver retails for
about $7000, not counting
freight and installation costs,
but Hough said that the church
paid less for each receiver be
cause of the bulk order.
The first receiver dishes —10
or 12 feet in diameter, accord
ing to the need in different re
gions — are scheduled to be in
stalled next month, Hough
said.
Tens of thousands of

Mormons have been able to
receive the televised sessions
of the General Conference on
commercial television stations
or through cable television.
Many of the Mormon
faithful live in isolated or
mountainous areas, making
the broadcast system more
helpful in spreading the word
of the Mormon religion.
But with the increasing pop
ularity of cable television,

Hough said, "it will be almost
impossible" to get the occa
sional time on satellites serving
cable systems whenever the
church authorities would want
it.
The Mormon Church in
stead is looking to lease time
on satellites serving broadcast
networks and develop its sys
tem of receivers within the
United States. Transmissions
are capable of being picked up

in neighboring countries, but
arrangements would have to
be made to use the network of
ficially on an international
basis.
The church, which has 4.8
million members worldwide,
installed five receiver dishes
about 18 months ago as a pilot
project.
In addition, "many local
congregations decided to take
it upon themselves to receive

the signals on their own drjh
es," Hough said. t

The purchase of the com
munication system by jhe
Mormon church is seen* as
being slightly out of character
for the sect. Although the
Mormons do not preach with
drawal from the modern
world, as do the Amish, tftey
are one of the strictest Jre
ligions, demanding that
members stay pure on Eartfi
