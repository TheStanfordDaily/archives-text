# It's Dodgers-Expos, Yanks-A's

Los Angeles (AP) — The Los
Angeles Dodgers celebrated
not so much their victory, but
their survival.
"It's a most emotional high,"
Dodgers pitcher Jerry Reuss
said yesterday after he'd shut
out the Astros 4-0 in the decid
ing game of the National
League West mini-playoffs.
"We had to win three games,
and we did."
Reuss' five-hitter against the
Astros concluded the Dodgers'
comeback from a two-games
to-none deficit in the best-of
five series.
"I didn't have one bit of
doubt that we were going to
win them all, and I don't think
any of the players did either,"
said the champagne-drenched
manager Tommy LaSorda.
"We neverstoppedbelieving
that we were going to win,"
echoed outfielder Rick Mon
day, whose run-scoring single
off Nolan Ryan in the sixth
started a three-run Dodgers

outburst. "We weren't count
ing ourselves out. Bring on the
Expos."
Houston Manager Bill Vir
don was disappointed, but still
patiently answered reporters'
questions after the loss.
"It's tough to win without
scoring any runs," he said. "We
just couldn't get anybody over.
I think anytime you get as close
to winning the thing as we did,
you have to be disappointed.
Ryan held the Dodgers to
one hit until the sixth, when
Dusty Baker walked, Steve Gar
vey singled, Monday singled
Baker home, MikeScioscia sin
gled in Garvey, and Monday
scored on an error.
"The Dodgers outpitched us
and outhit us," said Ryan. "If I
could have shut the Dodgers
out, we'd still be out there
playing."
New York (AP) — Reggie
Jackson, New York's cele
brated "Mr. October," and Os

car Gamble smashed con
secutive tape-measure home
runs in the fourth inning last
night, rallying the Yankees to a
7-3 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers and the championship
of the American League East.
Jackson's two-run shot into
the upper right field stands,
more than 50 feet above the
353-foot sign, erased a 2-0 Mil
waukee lead. It was his 16th
post-season homer and second
of this series. Gamble followed
with his second of the East
playoffs, a 400-foot line drive
into the right center field
bleachers, chasing Brewers
starter Moose Haas, who also
lost the playoff opener.
The victory gave the Yankees
the series 3-2 — they won two
games in Milwaukee, then
dropped two in New York —
and sent them on to the AL
championship series against
their ex-manager Billy Martin
and his Oakland A's. The A's

swept Kansas City in three
games for the West Division
crown.
The best-of-five series be
gins at Yankee Stadium tomor
row night.
For three innings it appeared
as though the Yankees would
continue to be embarrassed in
their own ballpark as Milwau
kee took a 2-0 lead against Ron
Guidry. Gorman Thomas hom
ered in the second and Cecil
Cooper delivered a bases
loaded sacrifice fly in the third.
Saturday's 2-1 loss got the
Yankees' a postgame
clubhouse lecture from owner
George Steinbrenner, who
threatened to make wholesale
changes if his high-salaried
ballclub was eliminated.
But the shakeup was post
poned, perhaps only tem
porarily, when the Yankees
erupted in the fourth and took
a 4-2 lead.
