A sign in the Stanford
Cardinal football locker room
reads: Defensive Back Zone
Notice. One finger will be cut
off every time we fail to play
the ball in zone defense.
Stanford linebacker Dave
Morze, who was the dominant
feature of the Cardinal defense
in Saturday's win, reiterated
the secondary's attitude on de
fending the pass.
"In the zone defense,"
Morze said, "If the ball is up in
the air, you have to go for it."
Morze, who intercepted one
Tom Ramsey pass, was not alto
gether pleased with Stanford's
defensive showing, but
savored the win nonetheless.
"The problem in the secon
dary is that we weren't going
for enough balls ," he con
tinued, "Ramsey threw excep
tionally well, but we made him
look better than he was. We
didn't play exceptionally well
in the secondary."

What Morze did do was to
cause and recover one Kevin
Nelson fumble, intercept a pass
and return it 33 yards and make
12 tackles â€” seven unassisted.
"On the fumble, Kevin
Nelson stood up and I just
stripped the ball away. The in
terception was just tipped to
me. It was just a matter of being
in the right place at the right
time," he said.
One play Morze was espe
cially disappointed in was
UCLA fullback Frank Bruno's
fourth quarter touchdown run
of eight yards. "Bruno's touch
down was a trap to my side. I
stood up the guard and Bruno
ran right up his behind. I didn't
see him and thought he was
down. He must have crawled
by me and into the endzone
because I didn't see him until
he scored."
Morze agreed that the game
was a big win, but said that all
the other games could have
been.

"We knew every game aft&r
our first loss was a big game.
We needed a win so bad to
keep this thing going. All
along, we thought we were on
the right track. We thought we
were doing things right
coaching-wise and all. We
needed a win to prove to ev
eryone that we were on the
right track."
Morze credited the offense
and John Elway, in particular,
with the win. "The offense real
ly came through today. They
had the character to win when
we needed it."
Morze said that he expected
UCLA to be tougher, but he
knows that next week USC will
be roaring after losing to Arizo
na Saturday.
"I love playing against these
guys. Their offensive line
wasn't nearly as good as it usO
ally is, but they have had a lot of
injuries.
"Defensively, we could have
played better, but we did win."
