# Harmon gives Cards a leg up
## 
### Mike Oneal 
Where the hell does it
come from? Where does the
little guy store all that
power?
Mark Harmon, Stanford's
5-9, 165-pound placekicker
from Alexandria, VA, added
his name to the Pacific-10
Conference cecord books
Saturday by kicking four
field goals in one game. That
is, he kicked three of them.
The jury is still out on what
he did to the fourth. But
maybe we can give it a title
anyway: Fear and Loathing
on the Way Through the
Coal Posts.
If there were ever any
doubts as to the strength of
Harmon's leg or his ties to a
world other than our own,
they were toppled Saturday.
At the end of the first half
against UCLA the
sophomore fireplug
popped a 47-yard line drive
through the uprights to put
Stanford ahead 16-14 going
into the locker room. It was
only about 12 feet off the
ground — a straight shot —
and it let everybody in Stan
ford Stadium know that this
guy is for real, even if that
particular kick wasn't.
"I thought I hit it in the
middle of the ball," Harmon
said. "I guess I pulled my
head. I try not to make that a
habit."
Harmon is now 10-10 in
field goal attempts this year

and has established himself
as the Cardinals' most con
sistent offensive threat. He
started out against Purdue
with a booming, school rec
ord tying 59-yarder, had a
couple of 45-plus shots in
Arizona and then hit his
long ball Saturday. He has
proved with his foot what
many kickers feel they have
to prove with their mouth —
that he can be trusted from a
long way out.
"Essentially," head coach
Paul Wiggin said, "he (Har
mon) is forcing us to decide
whether or not we believe
in our defense," meaning,
presumably, that since Har
mon can kick from so far up
field, a missed kick on his
part would mean fine field
position for the other team.
If you believe in Harmon
you have to accept the odds
that he will miss sometimes
and you therefore must be
lieve in your defense.
"I don't know," Harmon
said Saturday. "Everything
keeps going well. I kicked
bad all week long in practice
and I was really nervous last
night that I might not kick
that well. But things just
keep going right."
They certainly do and that
can carry its own kind of
pressure, particularly when
you play one of football's
celebrated pressure posi
tions.
"I feel really confident

whenever we go on the
field," Harmon said. "It's on
the sidelines I get nervous.
I've never kicked four field
goals in a game before. I was
really nervous near the end.
I'm glad they scored the
touchdown and I didn't
have to kick again."
Harmon speaks matter
of-factly when he says he
feels comfortable kicking
field goals up to 60 or 65
yards. And why not? He's
done it fairly regularly in
practice. The thing is, he's
not cocky about it — he just
happens to know he can do
it.
Such a weapon has been
extremely useful to a Stan
ford team which had not,
until Saturday, been able to
keep its offense going. And
Harmon truly is a weapon to
be weilded, not just a back
up. Everybody would rather
have a touchdown, of
course, but a consistent,
long ball kicker can win
many a game, particularly
when, as happens so often
on the Farm, a game comes
down to the last minute.
Harmon would rather
avoid the term special as ap
plied to himself.
"I don't like to think that
kindofstuff,"hesaid."l feel
I'm just part of the offense
— part of a unit. It takes 11
men to do it and I feel just
like somebody who's block
