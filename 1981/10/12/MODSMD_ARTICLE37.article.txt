# Cards dominate, but can't score
## Booters bounced by Bruins, fall 2-0 in soggy upset 
### Adam Berns 
All good things must come to
an end. After its 3-0 upset of
then No.l ranked University of
Connecticut last Sunday, the
Stanford soccer team showed
that it is merely human by los
ing to UCLA Saturday, 2-0.
Before the game, Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge had said
consistency would be impor
tant. Stanford lacked that con
sistency Saturday, in a game
they dominated and probably
should have won.
The game started out a little
bit sloppy due in a large part to
the wet field conditions.
Throughout most of the first
half, Stanford thoroughly dom
inated the midfield and UCLA
rarely got close to the Cardinal
goal.
However, the bubble over
the Stanford defense finally
burst near the end of the first
half as UCLA forward Peter
Trifunovich kicked a ball which

was deflected by a Stanford de
fender into the goal. It looked
as if the Cards would go down
2-0 near the end of the first half
as a UCLA player dribbled past
Stanford goalkeeper Willie
Burkhart but his shot was
knocked away inches before
the goal by senior defender Jim
Witham.
The second half began about
where the first half left off, with
Stanford dominating the mid
field and missing on a number
of scoring opportunities.
However, the turning point
occurred when UCLA goal
keeper Tim Harris made a div
ing stop of a Stanford shot and,
before anyone could breathe,
UCLA had countered and
scored a goal.
Harris started the counter by
kicking the ball downfield
where junior forward Gary
Kretzschmar made an ex
cellent pass to freshman Greg
Burns who went on to score.

This second goal seemed to
totally numb the Stanford at
tack. After Harris' great save
and UCLA's quick strike, the
game changed from what
would have been a 1-1 tie to a
solid 2-0 UCLA lead. Stanford
started losing control of the
midfield and started playing
desperate ball. They lacked the
poise they had shown earlier.
The rest of the second half
lacked any further scoring and
the Cards went on to lose 2-0.
Lodge seemed genuinely
disappointed in his team's per
formance and sorely missed
center stopper Doug Clark,
who couldn't play due to an in
jury. "The loss of Clark broke
up our defensive chemistry,"
Lodge noted.
The loss of Clark was not the
sole reason for Stanford's less
than sensational performance,
however.
"It was really frustrating
being so dominant and not
coming up with any points,"
Lodge said. "One of our prob
lems was that we played too
forward. We were running our
strikers in too much, running
away from our midfield sup
port."
Lodge also seemed disap
pointed by Stanford's style of
play in general.
"We really have to work on

our movement around the
ball," he said "Our play was
much too predictable."
However, Lodge admits that
frustration was part of the
problem.
"UCLA's goalkeeper was
outstanding," he sighed.
The coach said it was frustrat
ing to have so many op
portunities to score and not
take advantage of them. Stan
ford's play in the second half
clearly displayed the frustra
tion that they were feeling.
In a way, it was ironic that
Stanford's usual soccer
strategy, good defense and
quick counters, was the game
plan used by UCLA. The coun
ters and breaks which Stanford
used so effectively against
Connecticut were rarely seen
against UCLA.
What had to make the loss
Saturday so disappointing for
Lodge is that Stanford has the
ability to play much better soc
cer.

"This isn't the best UCLA
team I've seen. Last year they
were much stronger," he said.
Lodge realizes, however, that
you can't dwell on defeat.
Looking ahead to next
Wednesday, he said, "Our goal
now is to get ready for Santa
Clara."
