# Defeat No.2 and 3 ranked teams
## No.1 ranked Cardinals roll over UC-Irvine, UCLA 
### Chris Addington 
The Stanford Cardinals put their No.l
ranking and a perfect 15-0 record on the
line against the N0.2 Anteaters from UC-
Irvine and the N0.3 UCLA Bruins last
weekend, but emerged with an un
blemished record.
Both teams were eager for revenge after
early season losses to the Cards, and for
a while it appeared that Irvine would have
it Friday. Before the game head coach Ed
Newland said, "We've got to force them
(Stanford) to play our game, and we must
maintain a tight defense, especially on
Campbell (Jody, Cardinal hole man)." For
three quarters Newland's strategy was pre
cisely what happened.
Stanford jumped to a quick lead on two
tallies by Chris Kelsey, but Irvine scored
twice on man-up situations to make it even
at 2-2. Then, with four seconds left in the
first period, Irvine's Jeff Campbell fired a
10-meter skip shot into the high corner,
and Stanford was behind for the first time
this season.
In the second quarter Stanford's
Campbell scored early to tie the score at
3-3, but from there the lethargic play of the
Cardinals became evident as they* re
peatedly missed extra-man situations with
sluggish passes and wide shots. The quar

ter came to a close with the score still tied
at 3-3.
Stanford head coach Dante Dettamanti's
half-time pep talk seemed to spark his
team, for the Cardinals came out firing in
the second half. James Bergeson rocketed
one in from 6-meters and Campbell
whizzed one by Irvine goalie Tom
Pancheck with one of his patented side
armed-stutter-fakes. With the Cards up 5-3
Irvine refused to go under and tallied
twice to tie the score up with one period of
play remaining.
Irvine went ahead once again in the final
period as Stanford goalie Vince Vanelli
bobbled a shot, and the Cards found
themselves behind with only five minutes
to play.
After a Dettamanti time-out the starters
grimly began an incessant barrage on the
Irvine goal. Scores by Bill Taylor and
Campbell as well as a fast break by John
Tanner put the Cards up 8-6.
John Vargas scored a penalty shot to put
Irvine within one goal, but a Taylor-
Bergeson combination put the game on
ice with the final score 9-7 Stanford.
Dettamanti had a few crisp words to say
after the game. "This is the worst game
we've played all year," he said. "There was
no intensity and no pressure defense. Our

shooting was horrible."
It was certainly a different squad that de
stroyed UCLA 11-6 Saturday morning.
The match started slowly, with neither
team able to score until the rifle arm of
Bergeson made it 1-0. Senior Brian Felix
tallied on a defensive switch to round out
the first quarter.
The story of the second period was the
Stanford defense. With a ferocious tenaci
ty the Cards repeatedly forced the Bruins
to run out the shot clock. UCLA scored
only once while Stanford lit up the board
with two goals from Bergeson, and one
from Taylor.
Campbell put the game out of reach at
the start of the second half when he scored
three times, displaying the skill that makes
him one of the top players in the world to
day. UCLA scored twice on goals from
Vince Tonne and Boogie Black, but with
the score 8-3, their hopes were slim and
none.
With a comfortable lead Dettamanti de
cided to play his second unit, and the
bench did an excellent against the Bruin
starters. Senior Jeff Stiling scored on a fast
break, and freshman recruit Tom Lampert
whippped in two goals to round-out the
scoring. UCLA tallied three of their own,
and the score went down as 11-6.
