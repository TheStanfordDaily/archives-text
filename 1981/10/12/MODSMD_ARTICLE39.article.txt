The Stanford Women's Field
Hockey team continued their
trek on the long road towards
the NCAA finals with a 2-0 Sat
urday victory over Cal at Roble
Field.
The win raised the Cards'
perfect league record to 3-0,
including previous defeats of
Davis and University of Pacific
(UOP). But more importantly,
the Stanford players estab
lished themselves as the best

team in Northern California,
soundly defeatingthe national
ly-ranked Bears for the first
time in league play since 1975.
The team's success at least in
part mut be attributed to new
head coach Onnie Killefer's
exciting "attack offense,"
which kept the ball on the Cal
side of the field for much of the
game.
Patsy Huntington ignited the
Cardinal attack when she

drove home a penalty stroke
shot in the first half. Freshman
Jennifer Bleakley followed suit
moments later, taking advan
tage of the Berkeley defense
on an open field play, and that
was all there was to it.
The team faces its next test
tomorrow in a rematch against
UOP on Roble Field at 4 p.m.,
followed an extremely impor
tant Saturday match with Long
Beach State here at 11 a.m.
