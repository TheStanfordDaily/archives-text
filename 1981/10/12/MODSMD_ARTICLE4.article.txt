## 
### Monika Guttman Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
The status of the Zeta Psi fraternity
on campus is in question after an in
cident in which a 20-year-old woman
from Mills College was thrown into a
concrete pond at the fraternity house
last Thursday night.
The woman, who was participating
in a social exchange between Mills
and the Zetes, allegedly hit her head
on the steps of the pond, which is ap
proximately three to four feet deep.
After an argument with some mem
bers of the fraternity, she called the
police and was taken to Stanford
Hospital.
According to Diana Conklin, direc

tor of the Row Houses, the woman
was released the following morning,
and the Hospital had not found any
evidence of a concussion or other se
rious injury.
A committee to investigate the in
cident was established last Friday by
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons.
The members of the,committee in
clude Conklin, Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Tom Massey and Pres
ident of the Inter Fraternity Council
(IFC) Kevin O'Bierne.
"What Norm Robinson (dean of
residential education) will ul
timately decide todo will depend on
the facts and how they relate to past
actions at the Zete house/' Lyons
said.
The Zete house, which was on pro
bation last fall, is currently under re
ceivership of the IFC. The IFC has
complete responsibility for the
fraternity.
Conklin said there would be an in
vestigation, and perhaps disciplinary
action, regardless of whether or not
the woman files charges against the
fraternity.
"Any time there is a potential in
jury involved, it's a serious matter,"
she said.
Therefore, she said, the status of
the house is pending. The possi
bilities regarding the fraternity's
future include keeping the house
under IFC receivership or throwing
the fraternity off campus.
According to Mike Zboralske,
president of the Zete fraternity, no
decision has yet been made regard
ing the incident.
Zboralske said that an official
apology had been written to the
woman, but "she definitely did not
hit her head."
