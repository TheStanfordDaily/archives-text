### Dick Hodge 
The Stanford women's cross
country team won its third con
secutive meet and the men's
squad took fifth in its race at
the Stanford Invitational Cross
Country Meet held Saturday at
the Stanford Golf Course.
The women Cards continued
to run exceptionally as they
placed six runners in the top
nine spots. Freshman sensation
Ceci Hopp broke the tape in a
new course record of 16:43
over 5000 meters followed
closely by teammates Kim
Schnurpfeil in second at
16:46.5 and Sloan Burton who
clocked 16:57 for third.
Sophomore Patti Sue Plumer
captured fifth in 17:07.8, Anne
Locke took eighth with 17:29.7
and Diane Gong placed 17th in
18:02.6.

The leaders set a blistering
pace as the top five finishers
broke the previous course rec
ord. By triumphing so convinc
ingly over the field, the wom
en's team became ranked N0.2
in the nation — second only to
No.l ranked University of Vir
ginia.
Women's coach Brooks
Johnson pointed out Hopp and
Schnurpfeil, who switched first
and second place finishes from
a week ago, as characterizing
the team's spirit.
"Those two are key," John
son said. "They compete
against each other every week
but they're so compatible.
They're best friends. The big
gest thing about this team is the
interpersonal chemistry — the
way they work together as a
group. That's what dist
inguishes us from other teams

that should be as good as us."
Johnson was pleased with
the high national ranking and
commented that the team has a
big future. "This team is so
young we'll be good for a long,
long time," he said.
The men couldn't generate
the team effort the women did,
placing only two runners in the
Top-20. Coach MikeTomasello
was clearly disappointed with
the men's performance.
"We ran poorly — not nearly
as well as we had planned,"
Tomasello said. "We had a total
collapse of our N0.3 and N0.4
runners (senior Jim Smith and
sophomore Eric Sappenfield).
They're veterans who have run
the course before. There's no
excuse for it. If our big five run
like they're capable of running,
then we'll be one of the

toughest teams in the region." -
Senior Rod Berry led thfr
Cards by grabbing fourth with
a 30:36.9 over the 10,000-meterl
course, Smith placed 14th in:
13:06, Sappenfield came in 31sr
with a 31:46.1, David Frank
took 42nd in 32:00.02 and Tom
Roth placed 66th in 32:32.1. -
UCLA's Dave Daniels fin
ished first in 30:07.4 over the
hilly course as the Bruins worv
the team competition estab-:
lishing themselves as the best
in the Western region. w
On the brighter side of the
men's team performance,-
Tomasello singled out Berry
and Sappenfield, who each
shaved 40 seconds off their
personal bests for the course.!
Berry also showed a big im
provement from his 30th place
finish of last year.
