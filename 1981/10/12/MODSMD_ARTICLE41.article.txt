New Egyptian attack disputed
Cairo, Egypt — Gunmen attempting to as
sassinate Egypt's interior minister at his sub
urban home killed several of his bodyguards in
an attack after the funeral of President Anwar
Sadat, Egyptian police sources said yesterday.
The sources told The Associated Press that the
attack on Interior Minister Nabawy Ismail oc
curred at Ismail's home at Mohandissen and
took place late Saturday or early yesterday.
They said Ismail was not injured but some of his
security men were killed by the gunmen. How
ever, Ismail told a news conference the report
was"completely a lie, don't believe it."Then he
said there would be no news conference, and
told reporters to leave.
The police sources said the attack occurred
hours after the funeral Saturday of President
Anwar Sadat. They also said there were armed
attacks on at least two police stations in Cairo,
and a shootout between police and Moslem
fundamentalists.
Israelis support peace process
Jerusalem — Members of the Israeli Cabinet,
in a private poll by state radio, indicated unani
mous support yesterday for continuation of the
peace process with Egypt.
At the regular Sunday Cabinet meeting,
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir gave detailed reports
of their attendance at the funeral Saturday for
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Cairo, and
Shamir's attendance at the U.N. General As
sembly in New York earlier.
Begin and Hosni Mubarak, president-desig
nate of Egypt, will be meeting again within the
next three months, but no time for the meeting
has been set, Aryek Nor, Israeli Cabinet secre
tary, told reporters after the meeting.
The two leaders had come together in Cairo
with a handshake and a mutual promise of
"peace forever," according to Begin's account
of the historic meeting.
Palestine autonomy talks with the Egyptians
will resume in Israel later this month. The
critical test will come at the end of April when
Israel is committed to completing its evacuation
of the Sinai Peninsula, which was taken from
Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War.
Haig affirms Egypt support
Cairo, Egypt — Reiterating U.S. support for
Egypt after the death of President Anwar Sadat,
Secretary of State Alexander Haig disclosed
plans yeiterday for accelerated U.S. military
supplies to Egypt, and a large-scale joint military
exercise in November in which a force from
Oman will also participate.
After several hours of talks with Vice Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's presumed suc
cessor, and other top officials, Haig declared
that the United States would "reaffirm its in
terests" in the Middle East by "concrete man

ifestations of it.
"It is important to demonstrate that it is not
fatal to be an American ally," Haig said.
Speaking on a television interview shortly
before leaving the Egyptian capital for Washing
ton, Haig said that Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, a member of the American dele
gation to Sadat's funeral, spoke with Defense
Minister Abdul Hamid Abu Ghazala to work out
details of an expanded joint exercise planned
for next month.
Reagan administration officials found them
selves backpedaling nervously across conti
nents and oceans after Haig said that Egypt is
America's "foremost" friend in the Middle East,
and presidential advisers in Washington —
glancing nervously toward Jerusalem — has
tened to say it isn't quite so.
Haig, after meeting in Cairo with Egypt's pres
ident-designate Hosni Mubarak, had said:
"The United States intends to work actively
with our friends in the region, foremost among
those the government of Egypt and the people
of Egypt for whom our friendship and respect
have been deepened by this tragedy."
Back in Washington, Reagan administration
officials needed no reminderthat the comment
would not go down well with the Israelis. Asked
on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation" about Haig's
statement, national security affairs adviser Rich
ard Allen quickly came to the defense of Haig,
saying, "I'm sure, though I haven't seen that
particular remark, that the secretary of state was
undoubtedly referring to our friends among
the Arab nations, among the moderate Arab na
tions," said Allen.
Plutonium demand growing
Washington — The United States intends to
increase its production of weapons-grade
plutonium and tritium at Department of
Energy-owned facilities more than 70 percent
by 1985 to meet the demands of the nation's ex
panding nuclear-weapons program, according
to government sources.
This higher level of production at govern
ment-owned facilities is expected to continue
to satisfy weapons needs into the 19905, sources
said, thereby making it unnecessary for Wash
ington to turn to spent fuel from domestic nu
clear power reactors as a source of weapons
grade plutonium.
The heightened production of weapons
grade plutonium, however, will create a short
age of fuel-grade plutonium.
Although an expansion of plutonium pro
duction for weapons has been in the works
since the closing days of the Carter adminis
tration, the scope of the expansion has been
"substantially increased" under the long-term
guidance provided by the Reagan adminis
tration, sources said.
Prices hiked again in Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Bowing to a demand by

Solidarity's congress, the Communist govern
ment offered yesterday to include represent
atives of the independent union on a com
mission to solve the country's food crisis.
However, the government announced at the
same time that more price hikes will be neces
sary by next month.
The conciliatory gesture came as Polish con
sumerf threatened another round of strikes to
protest food shortages, and amid reports of
panic-buying of gasoline in Warsaw.
Following a Saturday night meeting of the
presidium, the government said improvement
in the food situation "depends primarily on the
achievement of political stability, as a Poland
shaken by conflicts ceases to be a credible part
ner in trade and cooperation," the official news
agency PAP reported.
UNEP withdrawal considered
Washington — The State Department is con
sidering an end to U.S. support for the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), one of
the main forums for dialogue between the in
dustrialized West and the Third World. A pro
gram official said a cutoff of U.S. aid probably
would kill the entire 9-year-old operation.
The voluntary U.S. contribution to UNEP's
project fund for fiscal 1982 was budgeted at $7.2
million, down $2.8 million from last year's dona
tion, which made up one-third of UNEP's fund
ing.
House and Senate conferees have set the
amount at $8.2 million, but Capitol Hill sources
said elimination of the entire amount was being
considered as part of the Reagan adminis
tration's request for an additional 12 percent
cut.
UNEP was set up in an agreement among 113
nations in 1972 at the urging of former President
Richard Nixon, and is headquartered in Nairo
bi, Kenya.
It "initiates, stimulates, supports, comple
ments and accelerates" actions within member
nationson a wide range of environmental prob
lems, according to an official publication, pro
viding problem assessments, planning, legal
drafting and registry services, as well as a techni
cal information clearinghouse. About 500
projects worldwide have been approved for
funding.
The U.S. contribution was $10 million a year
between 1976 and 1980, about a third of the $30
million project fund, according to Dr. Peter
Thacher, deputy executive director of UNEP.
"We could not survive if the biggest donor sud
denly cuts to zero," he said.
