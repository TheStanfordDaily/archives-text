# Inspections postponed
## 
### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
A misunderstanding about the na
ture of room inspections scheduled
to begin this morning on the Row has
resulted in their postponement.
Although Row and Cluster Facil
ities Manager Heloisa Edwards still
plans to check common areas of 33
houses for damage and fire hazards,
University employees will not enter
private rooms until Christmas break.
The misunderstanding originated
about two weeks ago at a meeting of
house managers when Edwards an
nounced that she would inspect stu
dents' rooms this week for stolen
furniture, vandalism, safety and
cleanliness.
The announcement , which came
in the wake of unsubstantiated re
ports that room checks would also be
necessecitated by the new energy
surcharge policy, led to discussions
of the Fundamental Standard and
student privacy rights.
