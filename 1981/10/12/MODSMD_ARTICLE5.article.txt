# Inspections postponed
## 
### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
A misunderstanding about the na
ture of room inspections scheduled
to begin this morning on the Row has
resulted in their postponement.
Although Row and Cluster Facil
ities Manager Heloisa Edwards still
plans to check common areas of 33
houses for damage and fire hazards,
University employees will not enter
private rooms until Christmas break.
The misunderstanding originated
about two weeks ago at a meeting of
house managers when Edwards an
nounced that she would inspect stu
dents' rooms this week for stolen
furniture, vandalism, safety and
cleanliness.
The announcement , which came
in the wake of unsubstantiated re
ports that room checks would also be
necessecitated by the new energy
surcharge policy, led to discussions
of the Fundamental Standard and
student privacy rights.


RENOVATION — Even though the Beta House, known and loved for the famous Beta
nooners, looks the same on the outside, the Inside has undergone many renovations.
These renovations include repainted rooms, a new dining room, new paneling and new
furniture. The Beta House Is just one of the many row houses that have recently under
gone renovations.
According to Row Director Diana
Conklin, confusion about the Uni
versity's motives generated so much
anxiety among students as to make
the inspection not worth the trouble.
Edwards said the inspection was
part of a new incentive program
whereby houses would be either re
warded or fined for the condition of
their living quarters.
The program was decided upon af
ter a massive cleanup and renovation
of Row and Cluster houses during
the summer.
"We just want them to take care of
things," Edwards said, "and convince
students they don't have to trash
their house to have fun."
In the four months that Edwards
has managed the Row, the University
has spent an estimated $300,000 to
improve living conditions at the
houses.
Edwards said $100,000 was spent on

cleaning alone. Of that money, the
University may recover $12,000 from
the Row.
According to Edwards, the work
constituted an eight month back or
der of work requests. "We still have
completed only a third of the work
that needs to be done," she said.
Conklin explained thatthe Univer
sity traditionally inspects rooms dur
ing winter break, to check for fire
safety as well as make repairs. She
said a few years ago, inspectors found
a mattress lying next to a running
heater.
"We caught it a couple of hours
before it would have ignited," Con
klin said. She also mentioned that
sometimes holes are punched
through fire-retaining walls and not
reported. In lieu of personal inspec
tions, house managers will be asked
to report violations, according to
Conklin.
