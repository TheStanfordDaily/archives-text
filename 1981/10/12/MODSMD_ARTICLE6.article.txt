# Energy surcharges enforced with tags
## 
### Todd Pickett 
Rumours of periodic mid-quarter
room checks for waterbeds and re
frigerators not registered under the
University's new surcharge policy
were dismissed Friday by John Eaton,
chairman of the Stanford Energy
Conservation Center. Checks will oc
cur only during the inventory of
rooms taken at winter break.
Under the new policy, designed to
combat rising electricity costs, Uni
versity housed students who use re
frigerators or electrically heated wa
terbeds must purchase registration
tags. Registration prices have been
calculated to match the cost of elec
tricity consumed by the utility over
nine months.
Refrigerators and electrically
heated waterbeds not registered by
Nov. 1 will be subject to a $20 penalty
in addition to the registration fee,
Eaton said.
The non-refundable nine month

registration fee for waterbeds is $90
while refrigerator fees range from
$20 to $55 depending on volume. The
energy costs of the refrigerators pro
vided for residents of Manzanita are
already included in their housing
charges and will not be subject to the
surcharge.
According to Eaton, a misun
derstanding arose when the Energy
Surcharge Committee this summer
presented possible methods of en
forcing the utility surcharge, includ
ing the option of mid-quarter room
checks conducted by housing as
sociates (R.A.s) for unregistered re
frigerators and waterbeds.
Members of the ASSU Senate
strongly opposed that alternative on
the grounds that it violated the spirit
of the University's Fundamental
Standard, which calls for responsible
self-governance on the part of stu
dents.
