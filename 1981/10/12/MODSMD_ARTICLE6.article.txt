# Energy surcharges enforced with tags
## 
### Todd Pickett 
Rumours of periodic mid-quarter
room checks for waterbeds and re
frigerators not registered under the
University's new surcharge policy
were dismissed Friday by John Eaton,
chairman of the Stanford Energy
Conservation Center. Checks will oc
cur only during the inventory of
rooms taken at winter break.
Under the new policy, designed to
combat rising electricity costs, Uni
versity housed students who use re
frigerators or electrically heated wa
terbeds must purchase registration
tags. Registration prices have been
calculated to match the cost of elec
tricity consumed by the utility over
nine months.
Refrigerators and electrically
heated waterbeds not registered by
Nov. 1 will be subject to a $20 penalty
in addition to the registration fee,
Eaton said.
The non-refundable nine month

registration fee for waterbeds is $90
while refrigerator fees range from
$20 to $55 depending on volume. The
energy costs of the refrigerators pro
vided for residents of Manzanita are
already included in their housing
charges and will not be subject to the
surcharge.
According to Eaton, a misun
derstanding arose when the Energy
Surcharge Committee this summer
presented possible methods of en
forcing the utility surcharge, includ
ing the option of mid-quarter room
checks conducted by housing as
sociates (R.A.s) for unregistered re
frigerators and waterbeds.
Members of the ASSU Senate
strongly opposed that alternative on
the grounds that it violated the spirit
of the University's Fundamental
Standard, which calls for responsible
self-governance on the part of stu
dents.
The Standard reads as follows:
"Students are expected to show
both within and without the Univer
sity such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to observe this will
be sufficient cause for removal from
the University."
Ombudsman John Goheen agreed
with the ASSU that the kind of room
checks considered by the Surcharge
Committee might, in his view, violate
the Fundamental Standard.
"It the standard is based on mutual
trust; it would be terrible to have it
compromised," Goheen said.
Eaton claimed the ASSU over
reacted to the plan when it was still in
the proposal stage. He said the ASSU
acted as if administration had already
been adopted as policy, when, in
fact, it had not.
The matter now seems resolved
with Eaton's categorical denial of re
ports that room checks would take
place during the quarter.
Ed Scoles, director of housing and
food services, initially suggested the
surcharge measure as a means of cut
ting the costs of purchased electricity
which have risen 50 percent from last
year.
Through metering and calcu
lations done by the University, refrig
erators and especially electrically
heated waterbeds emerged as the
greatest energy eaters among utilities
commonly used in student rooms,
Scoles said. He denied that the two
utilities were selected out because
they were considered "luxury
items," yet he added, "In my view,

waterbeds are clearly a luxury item."
While ASSU senators have ac
cepted and backed the energy sur
charge, some feel that the definition
of "luxury item" must be clarified.
"We don't want this spreading to
other utilities which might not de
serve the title," said ASSU Sen. Roc
Blumenthal.
Scoles estimated that as much as
$50,000 in energy costs could be re
covered by the surcharge which he
hoped would also deter students
from bringing high energy consum
ing utilities to campus.
Electricity, the most expensive
form of fuel, accounts for 35 percent
of the energy used in residential
housing, according to Scoles.
Stanford's electricity costs this year
totaled $5 million and are expected
to go to $7.3 million next year, ac
cording to a recent study by the De
partment of Energy Conservation.
The report also predicted a doubling
of total energy costs in the next four
years.
Originally, the Committee on Ser
vices to Student Residences dis
cussed banning waterbeds from
campus residences, a policy held by a
number of universities, according to
Eaton.
Eaton said that waterbeds not only
are economically impractical but
also, because of their extra weight,
can cause structural damage. Wa
terbeds have long been banned in
the Manzanita Park trailers because
the floors there are not sufficiently
sturdy.
Concerning the surcharge, Eaton
added, "The situation is beneficial to
everyone. It places the costs of
energy on those who are using it.'
