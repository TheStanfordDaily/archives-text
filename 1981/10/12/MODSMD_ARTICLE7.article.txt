## Huge German rally protests arms race 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bonn, West Germany â€” Un
deterred by cold, rainy weath
er, more than 250,000 anti-war
activists from many parts of Eu
rope converged on this small
capital of West Germany on
Saturday to protest the East-
West arms race that most seem
to blame on the United States.
The huge demonstration,
said by its organizers to have
been the largest held in the
country since World War 11,
had caused concern that it
would end in violence. How
ever, police reported only two
minor incidents: the smashing
of five windows in an office
building and the detention of
five people on suspicion of
trying to break into a liquor
store.
The demonstrators con

verged on Bonn University in
the center of town from five
outlying areas in orderly pro
cessions, wfth participants
chanting anti-war slogans and
carrying banners. Marchers
came from all parts of Germa
ny, and from Belgium, Austria,
the Netherlands and other Eu
ropean countries. There were
even some from the United
States.
One group of about 100
marchers wearing West Ger
man and Dutch army uniforms
carried a banner saying,
"NATO soldiers against nucle
ar missiles."
At times the demonstration
took on a pop festival at
mosphere, contrasting with the
banners and posters carried by
the demonstrators warning of
death and destruction if the
arms race is not halted. Some of

the participants were dressed
in costume, their faces
daubbed with greasepaint.
And as they condemned
"American imperialism" and
"militarism," the protesters lis
tened to American rock and
other popular music blaring
from two banks of
loudspeakers.
Reagan policies assailed
The Reagan administration's
decision to manufacture and
stockpile the neutron weapon
was a major target of the pro
testers.
In a finale, Henri Belafonte
joined Coretta King, widow of
murdered civil rights leader
Martin Luther King, to sing
"We Shall Overcome."
Demonstrators included
groups of Turkish students and
guest workers protesting mili
tary rule in Turkey. A group of
Iranians, one wearing a mask of
Iran's supreme leader, the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
shouted, "Death to Kho
meini." Groups of Afghans
chanted anti-Soviet slogans.
Kurds demanded an inde
pendent homeland. Other
protesters demanded the with
drawal of British troops from
Northern Ireland.
Yet, the bulk of the demon
stration centered on East-West
armaments programs. And
while its organizers insisted
that the demonstration was an
even-handed protest against
both the Western Alliance and
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact pro
grams, there were few
ences to the Soviet arms
buildup.
Predict rallies in East
Such protests will come to
Moscow and other cities in
Communist East Europe, pre

dieted Mary Kaldor, a British
anti-war activist, in a speech
before one of the groups that
marched from the outlying
areas.
"Together with the people
of Eastern Europe we shall re
move the SS-205," she said, a
reference to the Soviet Union's
triple-warhead, intermediate
range missiles targeted on
Western Europe. Deployment
of the SS-20, which according
to Western experts is at the rate
of one a week, prompted a
North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization decision in late 1979
to deploy a new generation of
Western missiles, the Pershing
2 and the cruise missile, as a
countermeasure.
German leaders rapped
That decision was the major
target of criticism at the dem
onstration, with President
Ronald Reagan and Chancellor
Helmut Schmidtand West Ger
man Foreign Minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher portrayed as
villains.
Schmidt and Genscher, who
were in Cairo attending the fu
neral of assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, have
been criticized by members of
their own parties for support
ing the NATO decision.
The main speaker at the rally,
Social Democratic left-winger
Erhard Eppler, a member of the
Social Democratic Party's top
executive body, called the
planned deployment an un
necessary escalation of the
arms race.
He declared that NATO is
"already more than equal" in
military strength to the Warsaw
Pact nations, a view shared by
Volker Deile, one of the dem
onstration's organizers.
