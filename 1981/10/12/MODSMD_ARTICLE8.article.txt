# Lethal IRA blast hits Londoners

### 
London (AP) — The IRA
struck less than a mile from
Buckingham Palace Satur
day, detonating a booby
trapped laundry van by re
mote control and sending
six-inch nails and bolts slic
ing into a bus carrying 23
Irish Guards and their fami
lies.
Police said a woman pass
er-by was killed and that 22
guards and 17 other people,
including two children on
the bus, were wounded in
the blizzard of nuts, bolts,
flying metal and glass that
left Ebury Bridge Road out
side Chelsea Army Barracks
a blood-spattered battle
ground.
It was the Irish Re
publican Army's first major
attack on a British target
since the collapse of a sev
en-month hunger strike at
Northern Ireland's Maze
prison a week ago, and po
lice said it could be the start
of a new IRA campaign of vi
olence in the British capital.
The IRA claimed responsi
bility for car bombings in
three Northern Ireland
cities Friday, none of which
resulted in injuries.
Attack last December
The last IRA bomb attack
in London was in December
1980, when five civilians

were injured by two car
bombs planted outside
Hammersmith Army Bar
racks. In March 1979, Con
servative Party politician
Airey Neave was killed
when his car exploded on a
ramp leading out of the
House of Commons parking
garage.
A spokesman for West
minster Hospital said eight
of the guards were under
going major surgery and
one was on the critical list
with a fractured skull and
another was likely to lose an
eye.
Police identified the dead
woman as 61-year-old Nora
Field. Hazel Cole, 27, an ex
pectant mother who had
been talking to Field when
the explosion went off, said
she "took the full force of
it."
The Irish Republican Pub
licity Bureau in Dublin said
the attack — which oc
curred three-quarters of a
mile from Buckingham Pal
ace — was aimed at the sol
diers because of the "state
of war" existing between
the British government and
the "oppressed Irish peo
ple."
