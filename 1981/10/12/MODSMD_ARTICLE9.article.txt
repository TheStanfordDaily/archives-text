Cullacan, Mexico (AP) â€”
Rescue workers brought food
and clothing Saturday to seven
coastal and mountain towns
isolated for three days by
floodwaters that left more than
100 people dead or missing and
50,000 people homeless.
As the Army and Red Cross
workers counted the deaths
and damage from tropical
storm Lydia, which struck the
coast Wednesday night, anoth
er tropical storm, Norma,
threatened from the Pacific
ocean, with winds over 100
mph.
The newspaper Noroeste de
Culiacan reported 42 dead and

76 missing in the northern half
of Sinaloa, a state that exports
winter produce to the United
States. It estimated losses to
crops, cattle herds and fishing
fleets at $80 million.
The Red Cross counted 37
dead but expected a highertoll
from late evening field reports.
The storm dissipated Satur
day over the Sierra Madres, but
rain-swollen rivers continued
to flood the foothill towns of
Guamuchil and Guasave,
which remained without elec
tricity. In Culiacan, flooding
contaminated the water supply
for 500,000 residents.
