# Stanford 'family' sees groundbreaking
## New complex latest epoch in housing crunch saga 
### Joan O'Connell 
Nearly 300 of the most notable members of the
Stanford family gathered in the dwindling after
noon light near Lagunita Court yesterday to break
ground for the new 800-unit undergraduate hous
ing complex. .
The Board of Trustees was just one of the units
on hand for the groundbreaking in a group that
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons called the
"philosophical team of architects" for the $36 mil
lion project. The celebrants also included the Uni
versity's top administrators, faculty and staff, as
well as student members of the ad hoc committee
which drew up plans for the dorm.
Mike Charlson, a former member of the 2Vi
year-old committee which formulated the new fa
cilty's plans, echoed the enthusiasm of many on
hand at the ceremony.
"I really think this dormitory is going to become
a new standard against which student housing all
over the country is judged," Charlson said.
Schematic drawings and models set up showed
the six-element plan, complete with independent
houses, suites, eating clubs, connected houses,
dining commons and a project center.
Occupancy for the individual houses is sched
uled for fall quarter 1902.
The last component, the connected houses, will
start construction in November and should be
ready for occupancy in the summer of 1983.
The facility's quadrangle is to be called the Ann
and J.E. Wallace Sterling Quadrangle, a tribute to
the University's chancellor and former president.
The Sterlings broke the ground themselves with a
gilded shovel to the applause of the group, follow

ing a tribute by Lyons, University President Donald
Kennedy and Vice President of the Board John
Packard.
"The name and association are going to make a
lot of people very happy," Kennedy said.
Others on hand included former President and
Mrs. Richard Lyman, former Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, now a trustee, former
President of the Board Peter Bing, as well as retired
administrators and friends of Stanford. Current
Board President William Kimball was unable to at
tend, as he is recovering from knee surgery.
But while those on hand celebrated the birth of
the new facility, it marked only another chapter in
the University's struggle to provide housing for
both students and faculty in an area which a recent
real estate index has designated as the highest
priced housing market in the nation.
In fact the Board of trustees went directly to the
ceremony following an afternoon schedule of
meetings highlighted by two important housing
matters.
Following the recommendations of the commit
tees which met yesterday, the group is today ex
pected to approve further measures designed to
make housing more affordable for faculty and
senior staff.
The Coinvestment Mortgage Program (COIN)
— an 10-month-old pilot program which has pro
vided second mortgage assistance to nearly 100
eligible faculty/senior staff members to date — is
expected to get the board's stamp today as a per
manent part of the recruiting process for new fac
ulty.
Approval of the Investment Committee's rec

ommendations will mean an additional $10 million
investment by the University, bringing the total in
vestments to date in the program to more than $20
million.
Permanent status for COIN will mean "reducing
the uncertainty among faculty and senior staff re
cruits as to its continued existence following their
decision to move to Stanford/' a report to the
board predicts.
Despite the hefty COIN commitment, a report
to the board notes that the housing problem here
still requires further attention — in other words
funding — in order to continue a viable recruiting
effort with new faculty.
What Vice President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called an "outright subsidy" to incom
ing faculty — a Housing Allowance Program — is
also expected to win the board's approval today, as
well as up to $2.5 million worth of the proceeds
from the sale of the Peter Coutts Hill con
dominiums. This program will take the form of ad
ditional compensation to the faculty's salary, de
signed to cover a portion of the individual's mort
gage interest costs, explains the proposal.
Rosenzweig said this program is a supplement to
the COIN program and that while the additional
money is taxable, "in the early years of a loan this
extra tax should be offset by interest payments."
The faculty will not be required to pay back this
subsidy, he said.
As are most of the housing assistance attempts,
this allowance will attempt to compensate "for the
differential between local area house prices and
those in metropolitan areas for the rest of the
country as a whole," stated a report to the board.

In fact the Board of trustees went directly to the
ceremony following an afternoon schedule of
meetings highlighted by two important housing
matters.
Following the recommendations of the commit
tees which met yesterday, the group is today ex
pected to approve further measures designed to
make housing more affordable for faculty and
senior staff.
The Coinvestment Mortgage Program (COIN)
— an 10-month-old pilot program which has pro
vided second mortgage assistance to nearly 100
eligible faculty/senior staff members to date — is
expected to get the board's stamp today as a per
manent part of the recruiting process for new fac
ulty.
Approval of the Investment Committee's rec

ommendations will mean an additional $10 million
investment by the University, bringing the total in
vestments to date in the program to more than $20
million.
Permanent status for COIN will mean "reducing
the uncertainty among faculty and senior staff re
cruits as to its continued existence following their
decision to move to Stanford/' a report to the
board predicts.
Despite the hefty COIN commitment, a report
to the board notes that the housing problem here
still requires further attention — in other words
funding — in order to continue a viable recruiting
effort with new faculty.
What Vice President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called an "outright subsidy" to incom
ing faculty — a Housing Allowance Program — is
also expected to win the board's approval today, as
well as up to $2.5 million worth of the proceeds
from the sale of the Peter Coutts Hill con
dominiums. This program will take the form of ad
ditional compensation to the faculty's salary, de
signed to cover a portion of the individual's mort
gage interest costs, explains the proposal.
Rosenzweig said this program is a supplement to
the COIN program and that while the additional
money is taxable, "in the early years of a loan this
extra tax should be offset by interest payments."
The faculty will not be required to pay back this
subsidy, he said.
As are most of the housing assistance attempts,
this allowance will attempt to compensate "for the
differential between local area house prices and
those in metropolitan areas for the rest of the
country as a whole," stated a report to the board.

GROUNDBREAKING FOR NEW DORMS — Breaking the ground for the new 800-person dormitory
complex which is said to feature "unusual angles and perspectives, things that surprise and stimulate as
well as please, a diverse neighborhood of small communities/' and even trie grand tradition ot the Bran
ner ana Lagunita dining rooms/' Chancellor J.E. Wallace Sterling and his wife Ann dug a gilded shovel
into the earth on the site where construction will begin in earnest soon.
Nearly 300 of the most notable members of the
Stanford family gathered in the dwindling after
noon light near Lagunita Court yesterday to break
ground for the new 800-unit undergraduate hous
ing complex. .
The Board of Trustees was just one of the units
on hand for the groundbreaking in a group that
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons called the
"philosophical team of architects" for the $36 mil
lion project. The celebrants also included the Uni
versity's top administrators, faculty and staff, as
well as student members of the ad hoc committee
which drew up plans for the dorm.
Mike Charlson, a former member of the 2Vi
year-old committee which formulated the new fa
cilty's plans, echoed the enthusiasm of many on
hand at the ceremony.
"I really think this dormitory is going to become
a new standard against which student housing all
over the country is judged," Charlson said.
Schematic drawings and models set up showed
the six-element plan, complete with independent
houses, suites, eating clubs, connected houses,
dining commons and a project center.
Occupancy for the individual houses is sched
uled for fall quarter 1902.
The last component, the connected houses, will
start construction in November and should be
ready for occupancy in the summer of 1983.
The facility's quadrangle is to be called the Ann
and J.E. Wallace Sterling Quadrangle, a tribute to
the University's chancellor and former president.
The Sterlings broke the ground themselves with a
gilded shovel to the applause of the group, follow

ing a tribute by Lyons, University President Donald
Kennedy and Vice President of the Board John
Packard.
"The name and association are going to make a
lot of people very happy," Kennedy said.
Others on hand included former President and
Mrs. Richard Lyman, former Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, now a trustee, former
President of the Board Peter Bing, as well as retired
administrators and friends of Stanford. Current
Board President William Kimball was unable to at
tend, as he is recovering from knee surgery.
But while those on hand celebrated the birth of
the new facility, it marked only another chapter in
the University's struggle to provide housing for
both students and faculty in an area which a recent
real estate index has designated as the highest
priced housing market in the nation.
