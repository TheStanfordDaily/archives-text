## Tailgaters: food, fun and football 
### John Burns 
To many of the 70,000-plus who at
tend each time, a Stanford football
game is more than just a game. It is a so
cial gathering ,n which mostly everyone
has one thing in common — they all
love Stanford football.
This past weekend's festivities started
late Friday night when residents of
Donner, an all-freshman dorm, arrived
at Stanford Stadium shortly before mid
night with tarps, sleeping bags, two
kegs of beer and a determination to sit
30 rows up on the 50-yard line. Sigma
Chi pledges arrived 30 minutes later,
and also set up camp outside the stadi
um gates.
The students were joined by alumni
campers which later arrived in prepara
tion for Saturday's activities.
By 9 Saturday morning, the parking
lot was a bustle of activity as the scent of
barbecues penetrated the air and beer
cans began to clutter the garbage re

ceptacles and recycling bins.
The most eye-catching tailgate party
of all was a bright red trailer-barbecue
which was tended by four men from
San Jose, two of whom once played
football for Stanford.
Mike Connor, a member of the
group who played under coach Jack
Christensen in 1977, is a member of the
Buck Club and the Council of Chiefs,
which meets for breakfast every Friday
morning to listen to guest speakers
from the team.
He attributed Stanford's slow start to
the coaches whom he felt should
"make the players believe in them
selves and the program."
Down the road, a crowd of men, at
tired in red and white, placed money
into a betting pool. (Traditionally, the
winner donates the money to the Buck
Club.) The conversation ranged from
last week's Arizona game which some
of them attended to one man's boasting

of this year's Big Game as his 28th in a
row.
In Chuck Taylor Grove a number of
groups assembled on the lawn to eat,
drink and talk football. N. Dayton of Los
Gatos, a non-alumna who "adopted"
Stanford, characterized the team as
"fun to watch."
The father of senior inside linebacker
Dave Morze played professional foot
ball for eight years. A member of a 1-13
49er team, Morze said that "whenever a
team starts losing, the people all start
crying wolf and blaming the coaches."
He credited lack of experience and the
loss of key players as being responsible
for the team's slow start.
But whether winning or losing, these
"Cardinal Faithful" will be there Satur
day mornings, eating, drinking and talk
ing and with the Cardinal's tremendous
performance on Saturday, their con
versation should be a bit more cheerful
and optimistic.


EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRY! —The scent of barbequed
food pervaded the air as Stanford alumni, families and

Rose Chan/Daily
friends joined in pre-game tailgating festivities last Sat
urday.


RELAXING BEFORE THE CAME — For many, tailgating
is a perfect time to sit back with a cold can of beer ana
get ready for the excitement ahead. Many alumni and
others have made a veritable tradition of the Saturday

Rose Chan/Daily
morning/afternoon affairs, which have possibly been
rejuvenated by Stanford's conquest of UCLA here Sat
urday.
