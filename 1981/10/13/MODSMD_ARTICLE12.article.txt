# A 						personal directory arrives...

The Stanford Student Direc
tory will have some new addi
tions this year.
Besides listing each student's
name, P.O. box number, Stan
ford and home address, major,
class and sex, the new directory
will also include an expanded
"While You're Here" section, a
personals section, and the win
ning photographs from last
year's Stanford Daily/Student
Directory photo contest.
According to Jim Mattson,
project director of the direc
tory, the "While You're Here"
section will be 42 pages listing
the offices on campus which
deal with student services. It
will also include humorous
quotations by Stanford alumni
and pictures from last year's
photo contest.
New to the directory this
year is a one- to two-page per
sonals section, in which stu
dents can for the year proclaim
love, express disgust, or say
anything up to 50 words for
$10. The deadline for entering
material is Oct. 16.
Mattson expects about 30
entrants in this year's personal

want ad section. This, he
claims, is about what he ex
pected for the section's first
year: "I'm really quite gratified
by the results for this year's
personals. We'd like to do it
again year after year. The sec
tion will build up in time, but
for the first year, the personal
ads are quite good."
The directory will also con
tain a list of residence phone
numbers, and a data table list
ing the number of students in
each major program. The di
rectory will not contain faculty
or staff listings.
According to Mattson, other
changes have occurred this
year to more thoroughly or
ganize the book. For instance,
the layout of the directory has
been changed to make it easier
to use, and the "While You're
Here" section has been index
ed to create greater accessibili
ty-
Mattson added that this
year's directory is "the most
complete listing of student re
sources offered at Stanford."
The reason for creating this
resource, he said, is to provide
a complete and useful direc
tory: "It's (the directory) one of

the few things that goes to all
students, so it's a great place for
a handbook format like this,
And we want to make it as use
ful as possible."
The student directory has
been run by the Office of Stu
dent Activities for two years,
being completely financed by
ads. The ASSU ran it for the
three years before that, as a stu
dent service, but was unable to
fully finance it. Before that, the
University provided student di
rectories for 75 cents a copy.
Those who do not wish any
personal information disclosed
about themselves can go to the
registrar's office and have their
personal data kept out of the
directory.
The directory is free to all
students and will be distributed
in mid-November through the
dorms and through Tresidder
Union for off-campus students.
The directory is not sub
sidized by the University, but
pays for itself through an ad
section and, this year, through
the personals section as well.
The project sold more than
$15,000 worth of advertising for
this year, according to Mike
Hale, business manager of the
directory.
