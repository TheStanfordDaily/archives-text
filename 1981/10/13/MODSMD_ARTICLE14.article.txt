## Joe Rodota Declining Cliveden campus must be improved or moved 
### 
The bad news that the Stanford
Program in Britain has been denied
permission to move to Oxford (Daily,
Oct. 7) is more than a minor setback
imposed for "political" reasons by a
finicky Oxford City Planning Com
mittee. The denial is instead evi
dence of Stanford's poor relationship
with the local British population and
the academic community at large,
brought about by the marked de
cline in the quality of the Cliveden
program and the students it attracts.
Oxford's decision also leaves un
resolved the pressing question: what

to do about Cliveden?
That the Stanford Program in Brit
ain is having severe problems there
can be no doubt. The Overseas Stud
ies Office is currently advertising in
order to fill vacancies in the coming
winter quarter. Last year's atten
dance was poor; the autumn, spring
and summer quarters were not filled,
and throughout the entire year no
student placed on a waiting list was
barred from attendance due to lack
of space.
This means that a student placed
dead last on the waiting list — the re
sult of the Overseas Office's de
termination that this candidate is the
least acceptable applicant among a
pool of perhaps 120 students — will
eventually be invited to romp
through Cliveden and study with
those who have a serious and legit
imate interest in ancient or modern
Britain.
The Stanford Program in Britain
lacks any device by which it may ex
clude undesirable applicants. All of
the other overseas campuses have
language requirements that guaran
tee a minimum of interest in the cam

pus and the country. Cliveden must
instead accept applicants who wish
to escape the rigors of the California
campus to obtain the perfect 24-hour
"buzz" or those who view the British
Isles as a convenient base from which
to tour Spain, Greece, Sri Lanka and
the Virgin Islands.
Yet the Overseas Studies Office
cannot find even enough students of
dubious dedication to fill Cliveden's
rambling halls. How could the pro
gram be running cost-efficiently
while being so underpopulated?
The effects of Cliveden's ad-

missions process are easily seen once
the students get off the bus from
Heathrow and settle in for some
good English country living.
Damages to the historic facilities of
Cliveden House are a continual
source of aggravation to the National
Trust and embarrassment to the Uni
versity. Stanford students have in the
past torn through neighboring pubs
while on drinking marathons; many
local establishments no longer ac
cept their patronage. Even the Feath
ers, the pub at the end of the drive
way and a spot close to thousands of
Cliveden alumni's hearts, is currently
off-limits as a result of a few students
last spring who took pride in remov
ing a healthy supply of that estab
lishment's glassware. Stanford stu
dents also enjoy a poor reputation
among the libraries of Maidenhead,
Oxford, the University of Reading
and the London School of Econom
ics. My point is that a few phone calls
by any member of the Oxford City
Planning Committee to a local estab
lishment or library would provide
more than enough evidence to per
suade the most forgiving of souls that

it is not in the best interest of Oxford
to let Stanford move to within a mile
of the city limit.
The Stanford Program in Britain
needs to be revised. The Overseas
Office and the University must up
hold the commitment to current and
future Cliveden scholars to provide a
culturally, socially and academically
fulfilling Overseas Experience. Pro
gram revision will also enable the
University to put its best foot forward
in future negotiations with as yet un
named British universities.
General student disatisfaction is
evident in the fact that only a handful
of last year's students stayed more
than one quarter. The pace at
Cliveden can be killingly slow. Few
classes provide the challenges avail
able in California or at any of the oth
er overseas campuses. Cliveden's
isolation is talked about, yet the ad
ministration does not provide suffi
cient opportunities for broadening
cross-cultural experiences. In some
cases strong disincentives have been
established.
I am referring in this last instance to
Stanford's policy regarding Directed
Readings, a form of tutorial. All
Directed Readings are optional, and
the student is charged $80-$ lOO for
every one he/she pursues. Addi
tional expenses for books, supplies
and tranportation are also incurred.
The overseas budget computed by
the Financial Aids Office does not
provide for this additional expense.
University policies therefore act to
deter the financially conservative
student from participating in this ex
cellent academic opportunity.
Requiring of every student partici
pation in a Directed Reading at no
additional cost (fees would be in
cluded in the total due from each stu
dent at registration) would both re
move the current disincentives and
weed out those students lacking
commitment to the Stanford-in-Brit
ain community.
Reducingthesizeof thecampus by
one-half, closer to the average size of
the other campuses, would end the
"come one, come all" character
the current program and the per
sonnel problems it engenders. The
heightened managability of a smaller
program might also prompt the ad
ministration to organize needed ac
tivities.
Stanford should take immediate
steps to shore-up the ailing British
program. Short- and long-term ben
efits would accrue to the University
and its students. The Great British
Public and the Oxford City Planning
Committee might even eventually
welcome us with open arms.
