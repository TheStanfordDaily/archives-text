## Reagan often out of touch with issues 
### 
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's relax
ed style is inspiring satirists and humorists across
America.
On its editorial page last week, the student-run
Harvard Crimson parodied a "typical" Reagan
Cabinet meeting. As portrayed, the president
whiles away the meeting, doodling with one hand
and eating jelly beans with the other. As a result, he
appears oblivious to the discussions of the day-to
day affairs of the country.
The Crimson parody goes on to show shadow
president Edwin Meese informing Reagan that
Vice President George Bush will attend the swear
ing-in of Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor. To that Reagan chirps in, "You
mean the new White House cook. She turns out a
great chicken pot pie."
Switching subjects, Defense Secretary Caspar

Weinberger asks, "What are we going to do about
AWACS?"
Our drowsy president replies, "Well, Alex (the
president has trouble with names), I think the
floors look pretty glossy already ..
While such pokes may appear mean-spirited,
they unfortunately have some basis in fact. The
president is often kept in the dark about interna
tional and domestic developments. Notsurprising
ly, the White House went out of its way to assure
reporters that the president was awakened early
and informed of the assassination of Egypt's Presi
dent Anwar Sadat.
But it's also common knowledge here that Rea
gan knows little about his personal obligations un
til the last minute.
Several months ago, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) thanked Reagan one day before the presi

dent was to honor the late Sen. Robert Kennedy at
a White House ceremony. "What award?" the
president reportedly asked. "I don't know any
thing about it."
Even Reagan supporters on Capitol Hill are in
creasingly irked by the failure of the White House
staff to keep the president in touch.
"The president's staff simply winds him up every
morning," one congressman told us recently, "and
tells him what he's supposed to do. He doesn't
seem to mind being in the dark."
While such a practice may be acceptable for
movie stars, it doesn't make it in Washington. Un
less the White House changes its style, Reagan risks
turning his presidency into a farce.
