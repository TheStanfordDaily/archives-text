## Stanford Band is now incomparably classless 
### 
Yes, the Stanford Band is truly "incomparable."
As Webster himself would surely agree, they are,
by definition, "not suitable for comparison." But
unfortunately, who in good conscience would
want to compare themselves with this rabble
bunch of pseudo musicians?
A year ago as I prepared to embark on a flight to
Los Angeles for the UCLA game, I watched in dis
may as a group of red-clad juveniles cavorted
through the terminal of the airport, riding atop
baggage carts and bombarding elderly patrons
with Frisbees and footballs. Oh well, I told myself,
just a high-spirited, albeit immature, display of
youthful energy.
Later however, when in mid-flight scores of
pillows were being destroyed and I was ap
proached by a harassed stewardess and queried as
to whether I was a chaperon for this raucous as
semblage, I began to seriously question the
motivating forces behind such antics. Embarassing
ly, but gratefully, I disclaimed any responsibility for
their actions.
Upon disembarkment, and viewing the carnage

left behind, a feeling of "guilt through associa
tion" continued to trouble me.
Still later, while some of these same delinquents
gleefully slid down the baggage ramp amidst the
luggage, I stood in shamed silence and again dis
avowed any association with the University when a
young lady in the crowd openly exclaimed, "I
thought Stanford had more class!" I desperately
wanted to tell her that I, too, thought the school's
student body was of a higher quality than that of
the small contingent on display.
But after witnessing the latest in a long line of
ever-increasing examples of bad taste, I can no
longer remain silent. The flaunting of obscenities
on the backs of "uniforms" at the Ohio State game
was neither clever nor humorous — merely of
fensive and vulgar to those in attendance.
For too long I've tried to justify, or at least ration
alize, in part, the misguided direction of the Stan
ford Band on the ground that they play good mu
sic. This was true some years back. Sadly, however,
as their innovative and refreshing uniqueness has
declined, so too have their musical skills. To say
that today's repertoire is adequate would be gross

ly misleading. Not even the once-proud and stir
ring rendition of the "National Anthem" remains
special.
In its present state, the Stanford Band is a dis
grace and an embarassment to the University and
its alumni. What a sad commentary for such a high
ly-esteemed institution.

Halftime and horses
I find it very difficult to understand how a pre
sumably private individual would be allowed to
ride a horse onto the field at halftime of a football
game. I sincerely doubt that I would be able to
walk onto the field, much less ride out on horse
back, unless I had been granted prior permission.
Am I to assume therefore that this individual,-for
whom the gate to the field was opened by uni
formed security personnel, was doing so with the
blessing of University authorities?
