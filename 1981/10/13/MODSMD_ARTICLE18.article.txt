## AWA Cs show anti-Semitism 
### 
It has been 36 years since the end
of the murders of 6 million jews at the
hands of the Germans, but anti-Semi
tism has continued.
Most recently, the diatribe against
the Jews, directed from the Oval Of
fice, has taken the same form which
German anti-Semitism did during the
19205. Duringthatdecade, Nazispub
lished and circulated The Protocols
of the Elders ofZion, a reworked edi
tion of an earlier anti-Jewish pam
phlet of the Russians which had be
come out of date. The Protocols al
leged that Jewry exercised excessive
power, and that it was essential for
Germans to regain control of their
government from these hated "al
iens." Jews mostly remained in
conspicuous, naively believing that
defending themselves against these
egregious lies was unnecessary.
This week, without rousing a ripple
of protest from public opinion, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan suggested that it
is imperative that we pass the
AWACS deal, to avoid giving the
"perception" that "foreigners" dom
inate U.S. policy. Then, Reagan in
duced former President Richard Nix
on, a man who has never been
known for sensitivity on issues of vital
importance to Jews, to blame Israel
and American Jewry for blocking a
sale vital to American interests.
In order to win approval for the
package, Reagan has raised the issue
of the loyalty of American Jewish
citizens. This issue has arisen before
in this country, though never be
cause of a president's remarks. Its se
riousness is sufficient to necessitate
clarification and comment.
First, Israel is not involved in lobby
ing against the AWACS; American
Jews are.

Second, American Jews are not
"foreigners," they are citizens.
Third, Reagan's implication that
Americans should rally behind their
president to prevent Jewish domi
nation of foreign policy, is galling.
Jews are merely concerned with the
welfare of their kin in Israel, some
thing which they have every right to
be concerned with. Should we next
suggest that true Americans rally
against blacks who oppose apart
heid, on the grounds that the United
States has an economic stake in the
South African government's survival?
Fourth, the AWACS package in its
entirety, with all of its inclusive mis
siles and bomb racks and weapons,
and not just the AWACS themselves,
represents a grave danger to Israel,
despite administration claims. Arab
military might now exceeds that of
NATO. Arabs have 50 percent more
fighters and bombers (3000 to 2000),
twice as many tanks (7000 to 3500),
and three times as many troops (1.7
million to 600,000) as NATO. Where
as in 1973, Arabs had a total of $5
billion worth of military equipment,
they now boast of a $57 billion mili
tary infrastructure which is rapidly
improving quantitatively and quali
tatively. The AWACS would effec
tively negate the quick strike
capability of the Israeli air force, be
cause of which Israel still exists and
her Jews are still alive.
Fifth, the Saudis are not true
friends of America and it is easy to
foresee scenarios through which this
most sophisticated technology
would fall into Soviet hands. Senator
Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) noted that
"the difference between the Saudis
(and the rest of OPEC) is a tenfold in
crease in oil prices as compared with
an elevenfold increase." Saudis have
shown their contempt for the peace
process begun by Anwar Sadat and
supported by the United States and
have promised to wage a holy war
against Israel. Moreover, the Saudi
government is filled with many PLO

members, many of whom are allied
to the Soviets. Thus, even without a
coup d'etat against the monarchy,
the Soviets could gain access to our
technology. We should try to im
prove our relations with our primary
oil supplier, but should not endanger
ourselves in the process.
Sixth, most Senate leaders do not
oppose the sale because of any moral
commitment to Israel's security. This
negates the administration's lie that
Jews are blocking the sale. In fact, the
unlikely leader of the AWACS fight
on the Senate floor is Robert Pack
wood (D-OreJ, who also votes
against military aid to Israel. Pack
wood's reasoning? He feels the U.S.
should not become the arms
merchant of the Middle East, an al
ready volatile region. Many Demo
crats oppose the AWACS sale in or
der to embarass Reagan. Senator
John Glenn (D-Ohio) typifies many
opponents of the AWACS deal by
arguing that it jeopardizes American
defense interests. Thus Reagan is
tacitly accusing the Jewish communi
ty of disloyalty because he feels that
this tactic might help swing public
opinion in favor of the sale. Ap
parently, our president does not care
that this tactic will also foster anti-
Semitism.
If any lobbies truly dominate
American mid-east policy, they are
those of multinational oil firms and
the military-industrial complex that
stood behind Reagan's election. As
Tom Hayden wryly noted, our De
fense Department is not headed by a
protege of Moshe Dayan, but by
Caspar Weinberger, a high-ranking
official of the Bechtel Corporation,
which has invested millions in the
Saudi infrastructure.
It appears that our country is so"
beholden to Arab oil interests that it
is ready to create an atmosphere of
hate.

wood (D-OreJ, who also votes
against military aid to Israel. Pack
wood's reasoning? He feels the U.S.
should not become the arms
merchant of the Middle East, an al
ready volatile region. Many Demo
crats oppose the AWACS sale in or
der to embarass Reagan. Senator
John Glenn (D-Ohio) typifies many
opponents of the AWACS deal by
arguing that it jeopardizes American
defense interests. Thus Reagan is
tacitly accusing the Jewish communi
ty of disloyalty because he feels that
this tactic might help swing public
opinion in favor of the sale. Ap
parently, our president does not care
that this tactic will also foster anti-
Semitism.
If any lobbies truly dominate
American mid-east policy, they are
those of multinational oil firms and
the military-industrial complex that
stood behind Reagan's election. As
Tom Hayden wryly noted, our De
fense Department is not headed by a
protege of Moshe Dayan, but by
Caspar Weinberger, a high-ranking
official of the Bechtel Corporation,
which has invested millions in the
Saudi infrastructure.
It appears that our country is so"
beholden to Arab oil interests that it
is ready to create an atmosphere of
hate.
(Dan Jacobs is a senior ma'joring in

It has been 36 years since the end
of the murders of 6 million jews at the
hands of the Germans, but anti-Semi
tism has continued.
Most recently, the diatribe against
the Jews, directed from the Oval Of
fice, has taken the same form which
German anti-Semitism did during the
19205. Duringthatdecade, Nazispub
lished and circulated The Protocols
of the Elders ofZion, a reworked edi
tion of an earlier anti-Jewish pam
phlet of the Russians which had be
come out of date. The Protocols al
leged that Jewry exercised excessive
power, and that it was essential for
Germans to regain control of their
government from these hated "al
iens." Jews mostly remained in
conspicuous, naively believing that
defending themselves against these
egregious lies was unnecessary.
This week, without rousing a ripple
of protest from public opinion, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan suggested that it
is imperative that we pass the
AWACS deal, to avoid giving the
"perception" that "foreigners" dom
inate U.S. policy. Then, Reagan in
duced former President Richard Nix
on, a man who has never been
known for sensitivity on issues of vital
importance to Jews, to blame Israel
and American Jewry for blocking a
sale vital to American interests.
In order to win approval for the
package, Reagan has raised the issue
of the loyalty of American Jewish
citizens. This issue has arisen before
in this country, though never be
cause of a president's remarks. Its se
riousness is sufficient to necessitate
clarification and comment.
First, Israel is not involved in lobby
ing against the AWACS; American
Jews are.

Second, American Jews are not
"foreigners," they are citizens.
Third, Reagan's implication that
Americans should rally behind their
president to prevent Jewish domi
nation of foreign policy, is galling.
Jews are merely concerned with the
welfare of their kin in Israel, some
thing which they have every right to
be concerned with. Should we next
suggest that true Americans rally
against blacks who oppose apart
heid, on the grounds that the United
States has an economic stake in the
South African government's survival?
Fourth, the AWACS package in its
entirety, with all of its inclusive mis
siles and bomb racks and weapons,
and not just the AWACS themselves,
represents a grave danger to Israel,
despite administration claims. Arab
military might now exceeds that of
NATO. Arabs have 50 percent more
fighters and bombers (3000 to 2000),
twice as many tanks (7000 to 3500),
and three times as many troops (1.7
million to 600,000) as NATO. Where
as in 1973, Arabs had a total of $5
billion worth of military equipment,
they now boast of a $57 billion mili
tary infrastructure which is rapidly
improving quantitatively and quali
tatively. The AWACS would effec
tively negate the quick strike
capability of the Israeli air force, be
cause of which Israel still exists and
her Jews are still alive.
Fifth, the Saudis are not true
friends of America and it is easy to
foresee scenarios through which this
most sophisticated technology
would fall into Soviet hands. Senator
Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) noted that
"the difference between the Saudis
(and the rest of OPEC) is a tenfold in
crease in oil prices as compared with
an elevenfold increase." Saudis have
shown their contempt for the peace
process begun by Anwar Sadat and
supported by the United States and
have promised to wage a holy war
against Israel. Moreover, the Saudi
government is filled with many PLO

members, many of whom are allied
to the Soviets. Thus, even without a
coup d'etat against the monarchy,
the Soviets could gain access to our
technology. We should try to im
prove our relations with our primary
oil supplier, but should not endanger
ourselves in the process.
Sixth, most Senate leaders do not
oppose the sale because of any moral
commitment to Israel's security. This
negates the administration's lie that
Jews are blocking the sale. In fact, the
unlikely leader of the AWACS fight
on the Senate floor is Robert Pack
wood (D-OreJ, who also votes
