# Student scholar's China conduct investigated
## 
### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
A University committee is in
vestigating reports that a Stanford
Ph.D. candidate's academic and pro
fessional conduct while doing field
research in China could seriously
hamper Sino-American educational
exchange.
The three-member committee met
for the first time yesterday to begin
looking into allegations of the Chi
nese government that Steven
Mosher, 33, used unorthodox meth
ods to obtain data "not normally
available to foreigners."
Anthropology Chair Clifford
Barnett said, "We take this matter se
riously."

An article published in The Chris
tian Science Monitor Oct. 6 reported
that Mosher's activities "seem to
have been behind Peking's decision
to cut back sharply on social science
research by United States scholars."
Social science research
But, the Monitor reported, some
Western social scientists believe the
decision was based on Chinese in
ability to accept probing into the
workings of Chinese society.
One Stanford student who recent
ly returned from China agreed.
"Educational exchange is a prob
lem," she said, "especially in the so
cial sciences. Research opportunities
are very limited there."
The Monitor said Chinese ex
change program officials are calling

Mosher's activities "dangerous" and
"disruptive." Senior officials from
several educational exchange pro
grams will meet later this year to re
view the case.
Committee
The investigative committee con
sists of Anthropolgy Professors Jane
Collier (Chair) and Joseph
Greenberg, and Law Prof. Thomas
Grey.
The Chinese government alleges
that a foreign-made van which
Mosher purchased and left with
commune officials was used to ob
tain confidential information.
In addition, the Monitor reports
Mosher was accused of using his
wife's Chinese relatives in Hong

Kong to help gather information in a
manner not "consistent with the nor
mal ground rules of anthropological
field work."
Sources within the Anthropology
Department confirmed that most of
the professors overseeing Mosher's
doctoral dissertation are no longer
supervising his work, after finding
that it contained research "mis
takes."
"Mistakes"?
According to the Monitor,
Mosher, who obtained the data in
question in 1978 and 1979, was "one
of the first U.S. scholars allowed to
conduct research after the nor
malization of Sino-American rela
tions."
