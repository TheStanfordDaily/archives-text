U.S. moves to aid Arab moderates
Washington - The Reagan administration is moving
swiftly, both militarily and diplomatically, to bolster
moderate Arab nations to prevent them from being
engulfed by chaos after Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's assassination.
The nightmarish fear for the administration is that
Egypt, weakened by Sadat's death, could be plunged
into Iranian-type chaos because of internal dissension
or outside interference — or both.
While the administration already had been seeking
to build a diplomatic and security network for the
Middle East, partly to protect the region's oil re
sources, that effort has been sharply accelerated since
Sadat was assassinated last Tuesday.
Among the measures:
—A large-scale joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercise
next month that will involve a large number of Ameri
can troops and possibly a practice bombing run by
American B-52s over an Egyptian target range. Troops
from Oman, another Arab nation, also may be in
cluded.
—The probable return of President Ronald Rea
gan's special Mideast peace envoy, Philip Habib, to
the region next month to try to strengthen and ex
pand the 3-month-old cease-fire in Lebanon between
Israel and the PLO.
It's not just Egypt that is the focus of these moves.
The administration also has decided to make another
push to fashion an Arab-Israeli peace that involves
putting new pressure on Israel to compromise on the
question of autonomy for the 1.2 million Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said before leav
ing Cairo Sunday that the United States has made
clear to Israel it opposes any expansion of Israeli set
tlements on the West Bank during the negotiations on
Palestinian autonomy. The next round of talks is
scheduled Oct. 21-22 in Israel.
The administration fearr that the death of Sadat, the
only Arab leader of stature who openly embraced the
United States as a friend, may be interpreted by other
moderate Arab leaders, especially those in Saudi Ara
bia, as proof that being friendly with the United States
is dangerous.
Carter supports AWACS deal
Washington — Former President Jimmy Carter, in a
move that put him at odds with many Democratic Par
ty leaders, yesterday endorsed President Ronald Rea
gan's proposal to sell sophisticated radar planes and
other advanced aircraft equipment to Saudi Arabia.
In a letter to Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) Carter allied
himself with the Reagan administration's intense lob
bying effort to block a possible congressional veto of
the $8.5 billion sale.
White House strategists have sought Carter's en
dorsement in hopes it will swing some undecided
votes, particularly among Senate Democrats, in favor
of the sale. However, opponents of the deal, pointing
out that 32 Democratic senators already are on record

as opposing the sale, have predicted that Carter's
backing will have little or no effect in influencing
what is expected to be a heavy Democratic vote
against the deal when it is considered by the full Sen
ate Oct. 20.
The endorsement came as no surprise. Senior of
ficials of Carter's administration have admitted pub
licly that a decision in principle was made late last year
— when Carter was still in office — to sell the Saudis
radar surveillance planes like the Airborne Warning
and Command System planes that are the main items
in Reagan's proposed package.
In fact, the Carter administration told Reagan's
people during the transition period that it was willing
to take responsibility for officially consummating the
sale before it left office last January. Reagan refused
the offer, but his administration subsequently de
cided it would go ahead with the deal and include five
AW ACS planes as well.
Carter's position put him on the opposite side of
the AWACS controversy from the Democratic Na
tional Committee and most of the party's other lead
ing figures.
Egypt-Israel peace intact
Jerusalem — After some hesitation, Israel has de
cided to plunge ahead with its peace with Egypt. But
problems remain, principally the issue of Palestinian
autonomy, that will take more than goodwill to re
solve.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet on Sun
day reached a reportedly unanimous decision to carry
out its treaty obligations with Egypt, barring any new
unexpected shock.
The key commitment is the scheduled withdrawal
next April from the Sinai Peninsula, which will leave
Israel's southern flank shorn of its protective buffer
zone.
The assassination of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat shook Israel, whose people have long been ap
prehensive about giving back territory for an in
tangible promise of eternal peace that could easily be
broken, especially once the last Israeli left the Sinai.
As long as Sadat was in firm control, the Israelis
were willing to take the risk. After his death, the Israel
is' immediate reaction was to wait and see. Nobody
rushed to assure Egypt that the assassination would
not affect the situation.
"If the peace process continues, the Israeli with
drawal from Sinai also will continue," said Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, while Begin said nothing
more than that he hoped peace would develop unin
terrupted.
"I am convinced the peace process will continue,"
Begin told his Cabinet, describing his 40-minute talk
with Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's designated successor,
on Saturday, the day of Sadat's funeral.
One Israeli analyst, Professor Mordechai Abir of
the Hebrew University, predicts that Mubarak, who
was Sadat's liaison with Saudi Aiabia, will try to re
build ties with that key Arab state by taking a tougher

line on the Palestinian issue.
Israeli officials say the Sadat assassination appears to
have shaken the U.S. government out of its seeming
apathy toward the autonomy talks, and they expect
Washington to apply increased pressure for Israeli
concessions that would bring about speedy results.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig's public warning
against a buildup of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank may have been a first American move in that
direction.
Arafat makes waves in Tokyo
Tokyo — Amid massive security measures, Yasser
Arafat, leader ofthe PLO, arrived here yesterday for
meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki
and influential members of Japan's political and busi
ness establishments.
Tokyo turned out a force of some 17,000 police to
protect Arafat during his three-day stay at the invita
tion of a group of Japanese parliamentarians headed
by former 112 oreign Minister Toshio Kimura.
The visit, which has been interpreted among diplo
matic analysts here as an important coup for the PIO
in attempts to gain international recognition, has
touched off a heated controversy in political circles. It
has also underlined japan's ill-fated attempts to strike
a policy posture that is independent of the United
States toward the oil-rich Middle East.
Coming in the wake of the assasination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, embarrassed government of
ficials have moved to avert a possible adverse interna
tional response by stressing that Arafat has come as
the private guest of Parliament members.
But the fact that he is scheduled to meet with
Suzuki and Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda tomorrow
has, all but in name, given the visit the trappings of an
official state event.
Originally, Arafat's trip, his first to a major non
communist country, was conceived, diplomatic ana
lysts here said, as part of a delicate diplomatic balanc
ing act designed to cement relations with both radical
and conservative Arab leaders. Japan's interest in the
Middle East reflects the fact that it relies on the region
for 70 percent of its total oil and energy supplies.
To the dismay of the United States, which flatly re
jects recognition of the PLO, Japanese officials have
quietly maneuvered to arrange Arafat's visit for the
past two years.
In an apparent attempt to offset cozier ties with the
radical Arab group, Tokyo had invited Sadat to pay a
state call here Nov. 9, during which it was expected
the Japanese would offer Egypt a large economic aid
Dackage. But Sadat's death has at least for the time
being thrown Tokyo's two-tiered policy approach
into confusion.
Washington has not publicly opposed the Arafat
visit, but U.S. officials have quietly objected to it on
the grounds that it will not help further the peace
process in the Middle East and may damage Japan's
image in the United States.
Israel, meanwhile, has said it regrets the visit. Israeli

Ambassador Amnon Ben-Yohanan told reporters
here last week that it would give the PLO "the chance
to come and speak to the (Japanese) public... .And
Arafat will have the chance to spread his propagan
da."
Tokyo was the last stop on Arafat's three-nation
tour that included visits to China and North Korea.
The outspoken leader's remarks in Peking welcoming
the death of Sadat raised a storm of protest among
Suzuki's liberal democrats.
Influential party members expressed displeasure at
Arafat's scheduled meetings with Japanese govern
ment leaders and called for the trip's cancellation.
German right conciliatory
Bonn - Most of the seats in West Germany's par
liament were empty, in anticipation of another
stagnating debate about relations between the two
German states, when surprising words were spoken
that made front-page news here last week.
The Christian Democratic Party, West Germany's
fountain of anti-communist and pro-American senti
ment, formally offered to end the battles of the past
decade with the left-center government of Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt over rapprochement with the
East Bloc, inviting the Bonn leadership to a "fruitful
dialogue" on inter-German relations.
While the offer did contain conditions and while it
was dismissed by the Social Democrats as a bit of ten -
tative, off-year electioneering, the gambit pointed to
a subtle and significant change in tone coming from
some influential CDU quarters.
West Germany's largest political party seems to be
inching itself toward a new assessment of relations
with Bonn's communist neighbors, in an apparent at
tempt to soften the party's hardline image.
Talk of a shift in the party's East-West stance is still a
controversial issue among CDU leaders, and the
theme is likely to be debated strenously at an upcom
ing national party congress.
Stock market slows for holiday
New York — The stock market turned in a mixed
showing yesterday in the quietest trading in more
than nine months.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
rallied 48.99 points in the last two weeks, slipped 3.52
to 869.48.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 30.03 mil
lion shares, down from 50.06 million Friday. Light ac
tivity had been expected yesterday with many market
participants taking Columbus Day off.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today, lows in the 40s. Highs in the 60s.

U.S. moves to aid Arab moderates
Washington - The Reagan administration is moving
swiftly, both militarily and diplomatically, to bolster
moderate Arab nations to prevent them from being
engulfed by chaos after Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's assassination.
The nightmarish fear for the administration is that
Egypt, weakened by Sadat's death, could be plunged
into Iranian-type chaos because of internal dissension
or outside interference — or both.
While the administration already had been seeking
to build a diplomatic and security network for the
Middle East, partly to protect the region's oil re
sources, that effort has been sharply accelerated since
Sadat was assassinated last Tuesday.
Among the measures:
—A large-scale joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercise
next month that will involve a large number of Ameri
can troops and possibly a practice bombing run by
American B-52s over an Egyptian target range. Troops
from Oman, another Arab nation, also may be in
cluded.
—The probable return of President Ronald Rea
gan's special Mideast peace envoy, Philip Habib, to
the region next month to try to strengthen and ex
pand the 3-month-old cease-fire in Lebanon between
Israel and the PLO.
It's not just Egypt that is the focus of these moves.
The administration also has decided to make another
push to fashion an Arab-Israeli peace that involves
putting new pressure on Israel to compromise on the
question of autonomy for the 1.2 million Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said before leav
ing Cairo Sunday that the United States has made
clear to Israel it opposes any expansion of Israeli set
tlements on the West Bank during the negotiations on
Palestinian autonomy. The next round of talks is
scheduled Oct. 21-22 in Israel.
The administration fearr that the death of Sadat, the
only Arab leader of stature who openly embraced the
United States as a friend, may be interpreted by other
moderate Arab leaders, especially those in Saudi Ara
bia, as proof that being friendly with the United States
is dangerous.
Carter supports AWACS deal
Washington — Former President Jimmy Carter, in a
move that put him at odds with many Democratic Par
ty leaders, yesterday endorsed President Ronald Rea
gan's proposal to sell sophisticated radar planes and
other advanced aircraft equipment to Saudi Arabia.
In a letter to Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) Carter allied
himself with the Reagan administration's intense lob
bying effort to block a possible congressional veto of
the $8.5 billion sale.
White House strategists have sought Carter's en
dorsement in hopes it will swing some undecided
votes, particularly among Senate Democrats, in favor
of the sale. However, opponents of the deal, pointing
out that 32 Democratic senators already are on record

as opposing the sale, have predicted that Carter's
backing will have little or no effect in influencing
what is expected to be a heavy Democratic vote
against the deal when it is considered by the full Sen
ate Oct. 20.
The endorsement came as no surprise. Senior of
ficials of Carter's administration have admitted pub
licly that a decision in principle was made late last year
— when Carter was still in office — to sell the Saudis
radar surveillance planes like the Airborne Warning
and Command System planes that are the main items
in Reagan's proposed package.
In fact, the Carter administration told Reagan's
people during the transition period that it was willing
to take responsibility for officially consummating the
sale before it left office last January. Reagan refused
the offer, but his administration subsequently de
cided it would go ahead with the deal and include five
AW ACS planes as well.
Carter's position put him on the opposite side of
the AWACS controversy from the Democratic Na
tional Committee and most of the party's other lead
ing figures.
Egypt-Israel peace intact
Jerusalem — After some hesitation, Israel has de
cided to plunge ahead with its peace with Egypt. But
problems remain, principally the issue of Palestinian
autonomy, that will take more than goodwill to re
solve.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet on Sun
day reached a reportedly unanimous decision to carry
out its treaty obligations with Egypt, barring any new
unexpected shock.
The key commitment is the scheduled withdrawal
next April from the Sinai Peninsula, which will leave
Israel's southern flank shorn of its protective buffer
zone.
The assassination of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat shook Israel, whose people have long been ap
prehensive about giving back territory for an in
tangible promise of eternal peace that could easily be
broken, especially once the last Israeli left the Sinai.
As long as Sadat was in firm control, the Israelis
were willing to take the risk. After his death, the Israel
is' immediate reaction was to wait and see. Nobody
rushed to assure Egypt that the assassination would
not affect the situation.
"If the peace process continues, the Israeli with
drawal from Sinai also will continue," said Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, while Begin said nothing
more than that he hoped peace would develop unin
terrupted.
"I am convinced the peace process will continue,"
Begin told his Cabinet, describing his 40-minute talk
with Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's designated successor,
on Saturday, the day of Sadat's funeral.
One Israeli analyst, Professor Mordechai Abir of
the Hebrew University, predicts that Mubarak, who
was Sadat's liaison with Saudi Aiabia, will try to re
build ties with that key Arab state by taking a tougher

line on the Palestinian issue.
Israeli officials say the Sadat assassination appears to
have shaken the U.S. government out of its seeming
apathy toward the autonomy talks, and they expect
Washington to apply increased pressure for Israeli
concessions that would bring about speedy results.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig's public warning
against a buildup of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank may have been a first American move in that
direction.
Arafat makes waves in Tokyo
Tokyo — Amid massive security measures, Yasser
Arafat, leader ofthe PLO, arrived here yesterday for
meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki
and influential members of Japan's political and busi
ness establishments.
Tokyo turned out a force of some 17,000 police to
protect Arafat during his three-day stay at the invita
tion of a group of Japanese parliamentarians headed
by former 112 oreign Minister Toshio Kimura.
The visit, which has been interpreted among diplo
matic analysts here as an important coup for the PIO
in attempts to gain international recognition, has
touched off a heated controversy in political circles. It
has also underlined japan's ill-fated attempts to strike
a policy posture that is independent of the United
States toward the oil-rich Middle East.
Coming in the wake of the assasination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, embarrassed government of
ficials have moved to avert a possible adverse interna
tional response by stressing that Arafat has come as
the private guest of Parliament members.
But the fact that he is scheduled to meet with
Suzuki and Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda tomorrow
has, all but in name, given the visit the trappings of an
official state event.
Originally, Arafat's trip, his first to a major non
communist country, was conceived, diplomatic ana
lysts here said, as part of a delicate diplomatic balanc
ing act designed to cement relations with both radical
and conservative Arab leaders. Japan's interest in the
Middle East reflects the fact that it relies on the region
for 70 percent of its total oil and energy supplies.
To the dismay of the United States, which flatly re
jects recognition of the PLO, Japanese officials have
quietly maneuvered to arrange Arafat's visit for the
past two years.
In an apparent attempt to offset cozier ties with the
radical Arab group, Tokyo had invited Sadat to pay a
state call here Nov. 9, during which it was expected
the Japanese would offer Egypt a large economic aid
Dackage. But Sadat's death has at least for the time
being thrown Tokyo's two-tiered policy approach
into confusion.
Washington has not publicly opposed the Arafat
visit, but U.S. officials have quietly objected to it on
the grounds that it will not help further the peace
process in the Middle East and may damage Japan's
image in the United States.
Israel, meanwhile, has said it regrets the visit. Israeli

Ambassador Amnon Ben-Yohanan told reporters
here last week that it would give the PLO "the chance
to come and speak to the (Japanese) public... .And
Arafat will have the chance to spread his propagan
da."
Tokyo was the last stop on Arafat's three-nation
tour that included visits to China and North Korea.
The outspoken leader's remarks in Peking welcoming
the death of Sadat raised a storm of protest among
Suzuki's liberal democrats.
Influential party members expressed displeasure at
Arafat's scheduled meetings with Japanese govern
ment leaders and called for the trip's cancellation.
German right conciliatory
Bonn - Most of the seats in West Germany's par
liament were empty, in anticipation of another
stagnating debate about relations between the two
German states, when surprising words were spoken
that made front-page news here last week.
The Christian Democratic Party, West Germany's
fountain of anti-communist and pro-American senti
ment, formally offered to end the battles of the past
decade with the left-center government of Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt over rapprochement with the
East Bloc, inviting the Bonn leadership to a "fruitful
dialogue" on inter-German relations.
While the offer did contain conditions and while it
was dismissed by the Social Democrats as a bit of ten -
tative, off-year electioneering, the gambit pointed to
a subtle and significant change in tone coming from
some influential CDU quarters.
West Germany's largest political party seems to be
inching itself toward a new assessment of relations
with Bonn's communist neighbors, in an apparent at
tempt to soften the party's hardline image.
Talk of a shift in the party's East-West stance is still a
controversial issue among CDU leaders, and the
theme is likely to be debated strenously at an upcom
ing national party congress.

Washington - The Reagan administration is moving
swiftly, both militarily and diplomatically, to bolster
moderate Arab nations to prevent them from being
engulfed by chaos after Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's assassination.
The nightmarish fear for the administration is that
Egypt, weakened by Sadat's death, could be plunged
into Iranian-type chaos because of internal dissension
or outside interference — or both.
While the administration already had been seeking
to build a diplomatic and security network for the
Middle East, partly to protect the region's oil re
sources, that effort has been sharply accelerated since
Sadat was assassinated last Tuesday.
Among the measures:
—A large-scale joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercise
next month that will involve a large number of Ameri
can troops and possibly a practice bombing run by
American B-52s over an Egyptian target range. Troops
from Oman, another Arab nation, also may be in
cluded.
—The probable return of President Ronald Rea
gan's special Mideast peace envoy, Philip Habib, to
the region next month to try to strengthen and ex
pand the 3-month-old cease-fire in Lebanon between
Israel and the PLO.
It's not just Egypt that is the focus of these moves.
The administration also has decided to make another
push to fashion an Arab-Israeli peace that involves
putting new pressure on Israel to compromise on the
question of autonomy for the 1.2 million Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said before leav
ing Cairo Sunday that the United States has made
clear to Israel it opposes any expansion of Israeli set
tlements on the West Bank during the negotiations on
Palestinian autonomy. The next round of talks is
scheduled Oct. 21-22 in Israel.
The administration fearr that the death of Sadat, the
only Arab leader of stature who openly embraced the
United States as a friend, may be interpreted by other
moderate Arab leaders, especially those in Saudi Ara
bia, as proof that being friendly with the United States
is dangerous.
Carter supports AWACS deal
Washington — Former President Jimmy Carter, in a
move that put him at odds with many Democratic Par
ty leaders, yesterday endorsed President Ronald Rea
gan's proposal to sell sophisticated radar planes and
other advanced aircraft equipment to Saudi Arabia.
In a letter to Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) Carter allied
himself with the Reagan administration's intense lob
bying effort to block a possible congressional veto of
the $8.5 billion sale.
White House strategists have sought Carter's en
dorsement in hopes it will swing some undecided
votes, particularly among Senate Democrats, in favor
of the sale. However, opponents of the deal, pointing
out that 32 Democratic senators already are on record

as opposing the sale, have predicted that Carter's
backing will have little or no effect in influencing
what is expected to be a heavy Democratic vote
against the deal when it is considered by the full Sen
ate Oct. 20.
The endorsement came as no surprise. Senior of
ficials of Carter's administration have admitted pub
licly that a decision in principle was made late last year
— when Carter was still in office — to sell the Saudis
radar surveillance planes like the Airborne Warning
and Command System planes that are the main items
in Reagan's proposed package.
In fact, the Carter administration told Reagan's
people during the transition period that it was willing
to take responsibility for officially consummating the
sale before it left office last January. Reagan refused
the offer, but his administration subsequently de
cided it would go ahead with the deal and include five
AW ACS planes as well.
Carter's position put him on the opposite side of
the AWACS controversy from the Democratic Na
tional Committee and most of the party's other lead
ing figures.
Egypt-Israel peace intact
Jerusalem — After some hesitation, Israel has de
cided to plunge ahead with its peace with Egypt. But
problems remain, principally the issue of Palestinian
autonomy, that will take more than goodwill to re
solve.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet on Sun
day reached a reportedly unanimous decision to carry
out its treaty obligations with Egypt, barring any new
unexpected shock.
The key commitment is the scheduled withdrawal
next April from the Sinai Peninsula, which will leave
Israel's southern flank shorn of its protective buffer
zone.
The assassination of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat shook Israel, whose people have long been ap
prehensive about giving back territory for an in
tangible promise of eternal peace that could easily be
broken, especially once the last Israeli left the Sinai.
As long as Sadat was in firm control, the Israelis
were willing to take the risk. After his death, the Israel
is' immediate reaction was to wait and see. Nobody
rushed to assure Egypt that the assassination would
not affect the situation.
"If the peace process continues, the Israeli with
drawal from Sinai also will continue," said Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, while Begin said nothing
more than that he hoped peace would develop unin
terrupted.
"I am convinced the peace process will continue,"
Begin told his Cabinet, describing his 40-minute talk
with Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's designated successor,
on Saturday, the day of Sadat's funeral.
One Israeli analyst, Professor Mordechai Abir of
the Hebrew University, predicts that Mubarak, who
was Sadat's liaison with Saudi Aiabia, will try to re
build ties with that key Arab state by taking a tougher

line on the Palestinian issue.
Israeli officials say the Sadat assassination appears to
have shaken the U.S. government out of its seeming
apathy toward the autonomy talks, and they expect
Washington to apply increased pressure for Israeli
concessions that would bring about speedy results.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig's public warning
against a buildup of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank may have been a first American move in that
direction.
Arafat makes waves in Tokyo
Tokyo — Amid massive security measures, Yasser
Arafat, leader ofthe PLO, arrived here yesterday for
meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki
and influential members of Japan's political and busi
ness establishments.
Tokyo turned out a force of some 17,000 police to
protect Arafat during his three-day stay at the invita
tion of a group of Japanese parliamentarians headed
by former 112 oreign Minister Toshio Kimura.
The visit, which has been interpreted among diplo
matic analysts here as an important coup for the PIO
in attempts to gain international recognition, has
touched off a heated controversy in political circles. It
has also underlined japan's ill-fated attempts to strike
a policy posture that is independent of the United
States toward the oil-rich Middle East.
Coming in the wake of the assasination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, embarrassed government of
ficials have moved to avert a possible adverse interna
tional response by stressing that Arafat has come as
the private guest of Parliament members.
But the fact that he is scheduled to meet with
Suzuki and Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda tomorrow
has, all but in name, given the visit the trappings of an
official state event.
Originally, Arafat's trip, his first to a major non
communist country, was conceived, diplomatic ana
lysts here said, as part of a delicate diplomatic balanc
ing act designed to cement relations with both radical
and conservative Arab leaders. Japan's interest in the
Middle East reflects the fact that it relies on the region
for 70 percent of its total oil and energy supplies.
To the dismay of the United States, which flatly re
jects recognition of the PLO, Japanese officials have
quietly maneuvered to arrange Arafat's visit for the
past two years.
In an apparent attempt to offset cozier ties with the
radical Arab group, Tokyo had invited Sadat to pay a
state call here Nov. 9, during which it was expected
the Japanese would offer Egypt a large economic aid
Dackage. But Sadat's death has at least for the time
being thrown Tokyo's two-tiered policy approach
into confusion.
Washington has not publicly opposed the Arafat
visit, but U.S. officials have quietly objected to it on
the grounds that it will not help further the peace
process in the Middle East and may damage Japan's
image in the United States.
Israel, meanwhile, has said it regrets the visit. Israeli

Ambassador Amnon Ben-Yohanan told reporters
here last week that it would give the PLO "the chance
to come and speak to the (Japanese) public... .And
Arafat will have the chance to spread his propagan
da."
Tokyo was the last stop on Arafat's three-nation
tour that included visits to China and North Korea.
The outspoken leader's remarks in Peking welcoming
the death of Sadat raised a storm of protest among
Suzuki's liberal democrats.
Influential party members expressed displeasure at
Arafat's scheduled meetings with Japanese govern
ment leaders and called for the trip's cancellation.
German right conciliatory
Bonn - Most of the seats in West Germany's par
liament were empty, in anticipation of another
stagnating debate about relations between the two
German states, when surprising words were spoken
that made front-page news here last week.
The Christian Democratic Party, West Germany's
fountain of anti-communist and pro-American senti
ment, formally offered to end the battles of the past
decade with the left-center government of Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt over rapprochement with the
East Bloc, inviting the Bonn leadership to a "fruitful
dialogue" on inter-German relations.
While the offer did contain conditions and while it
was dismissed by the Social Democrats as a bit of ten -
tative, off-year electioneering, the gambit pointed to
a subtle and significant change in tone coming from
some influential CDU quarters.
West Germany's largest political party seems to be
inching itself toward a new assessment of relations
with Bonn's communist neighbors, in an apparent at
tempt to soften the party's hardline image.
Talk of a shift in the party's East-West stance is still a
controversial issue among CDU leaders, and the
theme is likely to be debated strenously at an upcom
ing national party congress.
Stock market slows for holiday
New York — The stock market turned in a mixed

New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 30.03 mil
lion shares, down from 50.06 million Friday. Light ac

Washington - The Reagan administration is moving
swiftly, both militarily and diplomatically, to bolster
moderate Arab nations to prevent them from being
engulfed by chaos after Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's assassination.
The nightmarish fear for the administration is that
Egypt, weakened by Sadat's death, could be plunged
into Iranian-type chaos because of internal dissension
or outside interference — or both.
While the administration already had been seeking
to build a diplomatic and security network for the
Middle East, partly to protect the region's oil re
sources, that effort has been sharply accelerated since
Sadat was assassinated last Tuesday.
Among the measures:
—A large-scale joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercise
next month that will involve a large number of Ameri
can troops and possibly a practice bombing run by
American B-52s over an Egyptian target range. Troops
from Oman, another Arab nation, also may be in
cluded.
—The probable return of President Ronald Rea
gan's special Mideast peace envoy, Philip Habib, to
the region next month to try to strengthen and ex
pand the 3-month-old cease-fire in Lebanon between
Israel and the PLO.
It's not just Egypt that is the focus of these moves.
The administration also has decided to make another
push to fashion an Arab-Israeli peace that involves
putting new pressure on Israel to compromise on the
question of autonomy for the 1.2 million Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said before leav
ing Cairo Sunday that the United States has made
clear to Israel it opposes any expansion of Israeli set
tlements on the West Bank during the negotiations on
Palestinian autonomy. The next round of talks is
scheduled Oct. 21-22 in Israel.
The administration fearr that the death of Sadat, the
only Arab leader of stature who openly embraced the
United States as a friend, may be interpreted by other
moderate Arab leaders, especially those in Saudi Ara
bia, as proof that being friendly with the United States
is dangerous.
Carter supports AWACS deal
Washington — Former President Jimmy Carter, in a
move that put him at odds with many Democratic Par
ty leaders, yesterday endorsed President Ronald Rea
gan's proposal to sell sophisticated radar planes and
other advanced aircraft equipment to Saudi Arabia.
In a letter to Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) Carter allied
himself with the Reagan administration's intense lob
bying effort to block a possible congressional veto of
the $8.5 billion sale.
White House strategists have sought Carter's en
dorsement in hopes it will swing some undecided
votes, particularly among Senate Democrats, in favor
of the sale. However, opponents of the deal, pointing
out that 32 Democratic senators already are on record

as opposing the sale, have predicted that Carter's
backing will have little or no effect in influencing
what is expected to be a heavy Democratic vote
against the deal when it is considered by the full Sen
ate Oct. 20.
The endorsement came as no surprise. Senior of
ficials of Carter's administration have admitted pub
licly that a decision in principle was made late last year
— when Carter was still in office — to sell the Saudis
radar surveillance planes like the Airborne Warning
and Command System planes that are the main items
in Reagan's proposed package.
In fact, the Carter administration told Reagan's
people during the transition period that it was willing
to take responsibility for officially consummating the
sale before it left office last January. Reagan refused
the offer, but his administration subsequently de
cided it would go ahead with the deal and include five
AW ACS planes as well.
Carter's position put him on the opposite side of
the AWACS controversy from the Democratic Na
tional Committee and most of the party's other lead
ing figures.
Egypt-Israel peace intact
Jerusalem — After some hesitation, Israel has de
cided to plunge ahead with its peace with Egypt. But
problems remain, principally the issue of Palestinian
autonomy, that will take more than goodwill to re
solve.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet on Sun
day reached a reportedly unanimous decision to carry
out its treaty obligations with Egypt, barring any new
unexpected shock.
The key commitment is the scheduled withdrawal
next April from the Sinai Peninsula, which will leave
Israel's southern flank shorn of its protective buffer
zone.
The assassination of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat shook Israel, whose people have long been ap
prehensive about giving back territory for an in
tangible promise of eternal peace that could easily be
broken, especially once the last Israeli left the Sinai.
As long as Sadat was in firm control, the Israelis
were willing to take the risk. After his death, the Israel
is' immediate reaction was to wait and see. Nobody
rushed to assure Egypt that the assassination would
not affect the situation.
"If the peace process continues, the Israeli with
drawal from Sinai also will continue," said Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, while Begin said nothing
more than that he hoped peace would develop unin
terrupted.
"I am convinced the peace process will continue,"
Begin told his Cabinet, describing his 40-minute talk
with Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's designated successor,
on Saturday, the day of Sadat's funeral.
One Israeli analyst, Professor Mordechai Abir of
the Hebrew University, predicts that Mubarak, who
was Sadat's liaison with Saudi Aiabia, will try to re
build ties with that key Arab state by taking a tougher

line on the Palestinian issue.
Israeli officials say the Sadat assassination appears to
have shaken the U.S. government out of its seeming
apathy toward the autonomy talks, and they expect
Washington to apply increased pressure for Israeli
concessions that would bring about speedy results.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig's public warning
against a buildup of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank may have been a first American move in that
direction.
Arafat makes waves in Tokyo
Tokyo — Amid massive security measures, Yasser
Arafat, leader ofthe PLO, arrived here yesterday for
meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki
and influential members of Japan's political and busi
ness establishments.
Tokyo turned out a force of some 17,000 police to
protect Arafat during his three-day stay at the invita
tion of a group of Japanese parliamentarians headed
by former 112 oreign Minister Toshio Kimura.
The visit, which has been interpreted among diplo
matic analysts here as an important coup for the PIO
in attempts to gain international recognition, has
touched off a heated controversy in political circles. It
has also underlined japan's ill-fated attempts to strike
a policy posture that is independent of the United
States toward the oil-rich Middle East.
Coming in the wake of the assasination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat, embarrassed government of
ficials have moved to avert a possible adverse interna
tional response by stressing that Arafat has come as
the private guest of Parliament members.
But the fact that he is scheduled to meet with
Suzuki and Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda tomorrow
has, all but in name, given the visit the trappings of an
official state event.
Originally, Arafat's trip, his first to a major non
communist country, was conceived, diplomatic ana
lysts here said, as part of a delicate diplomatic balanc
ing act designed to cement relations with both radical
and conservative Arab leaders. Japan's interest in the
Middle East reflects the fact that it relies on the region
for 70 percent of its total oil and energy supplies.
To the dismay of the United States, which flatly re
jects recognition of the PLO, Japanese officials have
quietly maneuvered to arrange Arafat's visit for the
past two years.
In an apparent attempt to offset cozier ties with the
radical Arab group, Tokyo had invited Sadat to pay a
state call here Nov. 9, during which it was expected
the Japanese would offer Egypt a large economic aid
Dackage. But Sadat's death has at least for the time
being thrown Tokyo's two-tiered policy approach
into confusion.
Washington has not publicly opposed the Arafat
visit, but U.S. officials have quietly objected to it on
the grounds that it will not help further the peace
process in the Middle East and may damage Japan's
image in the United States.
Israel, meanwhile, has said it regrets the visit. Israeli

Ambassador Amnon Ben-Yohanan told reporters
here last week that it would give the PLO "the chance
to come and speak to the (Japanese) public... .And
Arafat will have the chance to spread his propagan
da."
Tokyo was the last stop on Arafat's three-nation
tour that included visits to China and North Korea.
The outspoken leader's remarks in Peking welcoming
the death of Sadat raised a storm of protest among
Suzuki's liberal democrats.
Influential party members expressed displeasure at
Arafat's scheduled meetings with Japanese govern
ment leaders and called for the trip's cancellation.
German right conciliatory
Bonn - Most of the seats in West Germany's par
liament were empty, in anticipation of another
stagnating debate about relations between the two
German states, when surprising words were spoken
that made front-page news here last week.
The Christian Democratic Party, West Germany's
fountain of anti-communist and pro-American senti
ment, formally offered to end the battles of the past
decade with the left-center government of Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt over rapprochement with the
East Bloc, inviting the Bonn leadership to a "fruitful
dialogue" on inter-German relations.
While the offer did contain conditions and while it
was dismissed by the Social Democrats as a bit of ten -
tative, off-year electioneering, the gambit pointed to
a subtle and significant change in tone coming from
some influential CDU quarters.
West Germany's largest political party seems to be
inching itself toward a new assessment of relations
with Bonn's communist neighbors, in an apparent at
tempt to soften the party's hardline image.
Talk of a shift in the party's East-West stance is still a
controversial issue among CDU leaders, and the
theme is likely to be debated strenously at an upcom
ing national party congress.
