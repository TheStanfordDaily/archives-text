# Many suffer in camps, says Salvadoran priest
## 
### Stephen Williams 
Saying that "revolution involves
tremendous sacrifice," a Salvadoran
priest Sunday described frightening
conditions in the refugee camps
along the Honduran border of El
Salvador, and for Catholics in El
Salvador.
Ninety-four children died of
malnutrition in 2Vi months earlier
this year in La Vertud on the Hon
duran border, according to Father
Jesus Nieto, who spoke to a crowd of
60 in the University Lutheran church.
The speech was sponsored by the
Stanford Central American Network
(SCAN) and a group of local
churches.
Nieto recently spent several
months assisting people in the refu
gee area which is limited by the Hon

duran government to a four-mile
wide stretch along the northeastern
border of El Salvador.
Nieto estimated the number of ref
ugees in the area as fluctuating be
tween 22,000 and 29,000.
In one incident which Neito said
he witnessed, a 16-year-old male was
captured by Hondurans outside of
the refugee area and was questioned
and then given to the El Salvadoran
National Guard, which maintains an
outpost outside of the camp. One
hour later, the youth's cadaver was
seen floating in a nearby river. The
Salvadoran Militia equates refugees
with guerillas, Nieto said. The majori
ty of the refugees are women and
children.
Nieto, a parish priest for 13 years in
rural El Salvador, noted that the gov

ernment and the National Guard are
intolerant of the Catholic church in El
Salvador, a country which is esti
mated to be B0 percent Catholic. The
church is accused of fomenting un
rest among the rural people of El
Salvador.
The accusation stems in part from
the activities of The Council of Chris
tian Base Communities, a network of
rural dioceses that, according to
Nieto, lends support to the masses of
people who oppose the government
of Napolean Duarte and the National
Guard in the current civil war.
In the late 1970s the "church began
to realize that the church and the
gospel are not political alternatives to
the government in El Salvador,"
Nieto said. "Christians have an ob
ligation to be responsible and con

scious," he added.
Rural Salvadorans, he went on,
began to fight for their rights out of a
deeply held faith that Christians
should demand justice. "If you toler
ate injustice, you are an accomplice
to that injustice," said Nieto, "and it
is a sin to be an accomplice to ir -
justice."
As a result of this activism, Cath j
lics have suffered in El Salvador while
other less outspoken Christians, most
notably the Evangelicals, have not.
Nieto is currently touring the Unit
ed States speaking to Christains
about El Salvador and Central Ameri
ca. The tour is organized by the Com
mittee in Solidarity with the People
of El Salvador (CISPF.S), with financ
ing provided by local groups such as
SCAN.
