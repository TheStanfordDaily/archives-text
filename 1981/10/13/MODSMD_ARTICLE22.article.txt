Senate meeting
There will be a special ASSU Senate
meeting tonight at 7 in Room 58 of
the Business School. Say you read it
here and receive absolutely free the
undying thanks of the news depart
ment, which has been besieged by
scrawled notes, letters, phone calls,
pony express deliveries and
billboards reminding us to remind
you.
Staff lunch
Don't forget tomorrow's staff
lunch with President Donald Ken
nedy â€” he certainly won't. Staffers:
sharpen your wits and pencils and
whet your appetites for those de
licious sandwiches. Be here at noon.
