## Three men with dreams, a man with an education 
### Steve Vineberg 
When we first glimpse the three young he
roes of the Dutch film Spetters, they are the
most vociferous of a group of fans gathered
to pay homage to a champion dirt biker
named Gerrit Witkamp (Rutger Hauer).
Reen (Hans van Tongeren) and Hans
(Maarten Spanger) are aspiring bikers them
selves, while Eve (Toon Agterberg) is Reen's
one-man pit crew, and these three hang out
together.
Spetters (the title is an untranslatable col
loquialism referring to spots of dirt or
grease; it can be applied descriptively, I im
agine, to young people) follows the three
boys through the day of Witkamp's big race,
which he wins; his triumph is set against the
confusion and rearrangement of the boys'
lives. By the time their reception for
Witkamp, captured on film by an industrious
TV sportscaster, has been aired, two of them
have moved far beyond the stage at which
the TV camera shows them — an accident
has paralyzed the once highly-touted Reen
and Eve has adopted a homosexual lifestyle.
In Hans' case, though his life has not
changed significantly, his altered per
spective on his one-time hero Witkamp,
who has made a fool of him, has awakened
— and probably matured — him. (We see
only Hans' immediate reaction: humiliation
and anger).
Spetters is Paul Verhoeven's first film since
Soldier of Orange, a terrific World War II es
pionage thriller. Though it recalled earlier
movies like Hitchcock's Foreign Correspon
dent in a genre now passe, its slightly ironic
tone set it apart. Its peculiar appeal to a con
temporary audience was that one could en
joy the action sequences and neatly turned
plot but remain removed from the jingoism
of the period, for Verhoeven kept himself at
some distance from it.

Spetters and Soldier of Orange share a
masculine view of the world — the brave lads
in the service of Queen Juliana areone spec
ies of good old boy, the bike-mad punks an
other — but otherwise the movies could not
be, thematically, farther apart. Vet Ver
hoeven doesn't move any closer to his sub
ject matter than he did in Soldier of Orange;
competently made and firmly structured as it
is, Spetters carries a strong feeling of detach
ment — as if Verhoeven were not committed
to the movie.
Verhoeven is movie-educated. Just as we
spot Soldier of Orange's antecedents, so the
inspiration for much of Spetters is evident:
Bunuel's Los Olvidados, perhaps Martin
Scorcese's Mean Streets, Saturday Night
Fever. The last is parodied in a disco scene
and then paid tribute — Hans and Eve take
their girls into a building under construc
tion, into adjacent rooms, with the intention
of having sex, but neither couple can per
form the desired act (Eve is impotent and
Hans' date has begun to menstruate) — so
each simulates orgasm in order to impress
the other two. (The reference is to the scene
in Saturday Night Fever in which John Trav
olta keeps his girl with him in the car long
enough to convince his friends he's been
laid).
Watching Spetters, though, one can't see
what Verhoeven loved in these earlier films,
because none of their energy or intensity is
present here, nor can we find anything like
the harrowing personal vision of a Bunuel or
a Scorcese. Is Verhoeven investigating
the nature of punk cool? If so, his movie
doesn't describe or explain it, but in a way
embodies it; even the violent sequences are
laid back, and his approach to Eve's sexual
tension is strangely casual. (It's also psy

chologically dubious and presents a highly
debatable view of homosexuality: the boy
peeps in on gay men being serviced by
hustlers in deserted areas and afterwards
beats up and robs the hustlers; when he is
gang-raped by a band of toughs, he dis
covers he enjoys it and changes his sexual
orientation).
None of the characters works fully — Hans
comes closest, and Hans van Tongeren does
the best acting as Reen — but there is a
fourth creation that is completely successful:
Fien, the woman who runs the fried foods
stand in town, played by a gifted actress
named Renee Soutendijk, who looks like a
cross between Debbie Reynolds and Han
nah Schygulla. Fien hungers for wealth, and
attaches herself to each of the boys in turn in
the hope that each will take her with him as
he ascends into some magical sphere that is
defined for her by Gerrit Witkamp and by
the pictures of John Travolta and Elvis Presley
that cover the walls of her trailer. Of course,
each of the boys disappoints her, and though
they have changed at the end of the movie,
she who longed so for change is in the same
place.
Fien is a fascinating combination of prac
ticality and naivete, canniness and lack of in
sight — a sexy punk Mother Courage. And
on the other end of the scale is Witkamp, the
spoiled celebrity who knows how to act like
a star; Rutger Hauer plays wittily off his last
performance, as the sleek spy hero of Soldier
of Orange, and his scenes have a satiric edge.
The scenes involving Hauer and Soutendijk
are so much stronger, in fact, than the rest of
the picture that they distort it; the three
young heroes become secondary characters
when we start to see their lives in terms of
Witkamp and Fien, who dominate their
dreams.
