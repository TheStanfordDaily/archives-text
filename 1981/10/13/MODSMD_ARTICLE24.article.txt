# 'Laugh'... but not too hard
## 
### Pam Pierce 
The new Neil Simon film
is not your basic punchy,
laugh-a-minute romp that
audiences might expect
from this prolific playwright
and screenwriter. With
Only When I Laugh Simon
has come up with a man
uscript that is, I think for his
first time, a fairly well-bal
anced juggling act between
the comedy and the drama
of a distinguishable and
emotionally involving
plotline. It was rather a relief
to hear droll lines actually

merging with the dramatic
action, not detouring off the
path simply to snag a funny
bit for cheap sitcom laughs,
as so many of Simon's efforts
do.
Although still not a huge
jump up from the TV Movie
of the Week, Only When I
Laugh does make an effort
to deal with the ins and outs,
ups and downs, arounds
and throughs of alcoholism,
via Georgia Hines, just ar
rived home from a 12 week
drying-out at a rehabilata
tion hospital.
Georgia, played by
Marsha Mason in a finely
tuned and sharp portrait, isa
citizen of the theater world
of New York City, stere
otypical cradle of a particu
lar brand of American neu
rotics. As an actress, she

seems to have never em
braced the responsibilities
of full-fledged adult status
in Real Life. As an alcoholic,
she always had the best ex
cuses in the world for not
doing so: "I guess I'm just
not strong enough,"or "I'm
just not ready".
As for friends, she hassur
rounded herself with some
loving folks with moun
tainous problems of their
own — Jimmy, a gay would
be actor, and Toby, a
wealthy, painted New York
lady hitting 40 like a brick
wall. Each tries to help the

other two; at times, though,
they seem to be their own
worst enemies. James Coco
and Joan Hackett provide
the necessary high-strung,
flip coverage of the close
friend angle, but it's Kristy
McNichol as Georgia's 17-
year-old daughter Polly
who, through common
sense underplaying of the
part, makes us believe in the
strengths and weaknesses of
Georgia's character.
We all know at least one
kid like Polly — the one
smart-ass bright kid who
seems more on top of the
situation than the parent. In
Only When I Laugh, the
story goes that Georgia had
left her with her father at an
early age and become a
weekend mom. "I wasn't

strong enough to fight for
you," she wanly explains to
her daughter. But Polly
moves in just as Georgia is
getting back on her feet, de
termined to get to know her
mother before, as she tells
her, "we both get to be the
same age".
Complications arrive in
the form of old writ
er/boyfriend David (David
Dukes), who has written a
play based on his turbulent
relationship with Georgia.
He wants her to play herself
onstage. She agrees, and the
safety pins and paper clips

holding her together inside
start unfastening.
Simon shows admirable
restraint as he writes scenes
of validity with few gratui
tous Tearful Fights and
hackneyed Sentimental
Moments. The glibness of
the lines of dialogue is only
a tad exaggerated from the
snap-of-the-whip repartee
that can go on among long
standing, long-suffering
friends and family.
Dreams, memories and
booze play in ensemble in
Only When I Laugh — an
old stage story, retold sur
prisingly well by a man who
usually provides exclama
tion points and parenthet
ical chuckles in his films,
rather than a series of well
constructed paragraphs to
fit in among the laugh lines.
