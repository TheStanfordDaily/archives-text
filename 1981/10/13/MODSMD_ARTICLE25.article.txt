# 'Paternity' suits, but won't satisfy
## 
### Vince Waldman 
Okay, ladies, here's your
chance. Burt Reynolds wants
you to have his baby. Swoon.
There's a catch, though. Seems
Burt is a "cold fish"; he's a per
fectionist who would drive
anyone who tried to live with
him out of her mind. Loves
kids, though. Goes to the park,
hangs around the mothers with
their baby carriages, follows
school children around on na
ture tours. On one of these he
comes up with the obvious an
swer: he sets out to find a sur
rogate mother who will bear
him the son he wants without
hanging around afterwards to
cramp his style.
Paternity, Reynolds's latest
movie, treats this premise in a
surprisingly gentle manner.
Reynolds's films of late can be
divided into two groups. The
moneymakers have been the
loud, boisterous, macho-man
projects like The Longest Yard
and Smokey and the Bandit.
But Reynolds has also made a
number of sentimental, some
times cloying films like At Long
Last Love, The End, and Starting
Over. His best performances
have come when he has been
able to combine the two sides
of his personality: in De
liverance or Hustle, for exam
ple, where the toughness of his
athleticism is tempered by an
affecting insecurity.
In Paternity, however, the
sensitive Reynolds overwhelms
the swashbuckling Burt. True,
he is cast as the sleekly hand
some Buddy Evans, who holds
every closet quarterback's ide
al job — he runs Madison
Square Garden — and who gets
all the women he could want.
But Buddy Evans is happier
shooting hoops with his best
friend's son, or feeding the
squirrels in the park. And the
film, which could have turned
intoa big locker-room joke un
der the direction of someone
like Hal Needham (who made
Smokey and the Bandit into
one of most frenetically un
inspired box office smashes in
history), is instead a relatively
quiet, subdued affair. The di
rector is David Steinberg, and
the humor of Paternity is much
closer to the subtler, winsome
style of Steinberg than to the

boisterous sophomorism more
commonly found in Reynolds's
big-bucks movies.
Much of the time, this style
works. Paternity is full of amus
ing vignettes and charmingly
funny situations. "What's the
soup du jourV' asks Reynolds
of a proper French waiter.
"Soup of the day," comes the
answer. A lot of mileage is got
ten out of Reynolds's efforts to
pick a name for his anticipated
son and out of a Circle Line
tour guide who spends the
cruise pointing out hospitals
where he's had operations
("Never get sick in Jersey," he
warns an avidly attentive group
from the Ladies' Garment
Workers while the landmarks
of the city roll by.) There's also
a wonderful visual bit about a
bunch of flowers in a butcher
shop, which comes close to
slapstick and gets the biggest
laughs.
That's just the problem with
Paternity: it doesn't have
enough slapstick. There are
lots of smiles here, but few bel
ly laughs. Reynolds so em
phasizes the gentle side of his
personality that the film lacks
punch. Thus, while we enjoy
the many good jokes, the film
as a whole doesn't leave much
of an impression.
Even in his subdued mode,
Reynolds is a magnetic person
ality and he dominates thefilm.
Most of the supporting per
formers are competent but es
sentially invisible. Beverly
D'Angelo, as the aspiring-mu
sician/girl-next -dooF-type
whom Reynolds finally picks to
have the baby, has some spunk
and can handle the jokes, but
her character has little depth
despite the obvious efforts of
the script to display the effect
of her pregnancy on her emo
tions. Norman Fell plays the
couple's doctor like a less out
rageous version of his old part
on Three's Company. The one
outstanding exception is Eliz
abeth Ashley, who is intelligent
and ravishing as an old girl
friend who helps Reynolds see
the light of romance. She is eas
ily the most interesting charac
ter in the film.
Still, it's up to Reynolds to
make the movie fly. While his

performance is charming and
amiable, it could use a touch of
Burt's customary braggadoccio
to make it compelling. It is,
however, interesting enough
to make us wish there were
more. Paternity ends up disap
pointing, because it almost de
livers a great deal more than it
does.
The moguls at Paramount
apparently don't know what to
do with this movie. The ad
vertising presents the swagger
ing Burt, attired in a blue jog
ging suit, posing with a grin as
Uncle Sam in the famous "I
want YOU" poster. It doesn't
fit the mood of the film at all,

and the studio 9eems more in
terested in using Reynolds's
box-office potential to pro
mote its other product. The
print comes from the studio
complete with a long opening
promotion for Reds, the multi
million dollar Warren Beatty
project which (from the clips,
at least) looks like it could be
this year's Heaven's Gate.
In all probability, the place
for Paternity is on TV or Home
Box Office. It moves quickly, it
has charm, and it manages a lot
of good jokes without offend
ing. But at four bucks a shot, it
just doesn't have the power to
come off as satisfying cinema.
