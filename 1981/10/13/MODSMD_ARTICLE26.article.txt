# Of jeans, Jews and jokes: the defense of bad taste
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
A certain prudishness seems
to have crept into moviegoing.
To a large extent this is the re
sult of the highly publicized ef
forts of special interest groups
to keep filmmakers from pres
enting them in an unflattering
manner; audiences are now so
cautious of the thousand and
one ways in which a comedy
might be offensive to someone
that they are afraid to laugh,
even though laughter is the
least hypocritical of all demo
crats — we all qualify as targets.
Hearing the complaints of a
number of friends — jews and
non-Jews — that the Spanish
Inquisition number in Mel
Brooks' History of the World,
Part I was anti-Semitic, I
couldn't help being amused
that anyone would accuse
Brooks, whose humor has
always been based in large part
on hisJewishness,ofanti-Semi
tism, particularly since I've
never met anyone who didn't
think that "Springtime for
Hitler" in The Producers was a
scream. The usual objection to
the Spanish Inquisition se
quence is that the sufferings of
Jews should not be made the
butt of a joke, but I don't be
lieve that there exists a subject
so sacred that it can't be made
funny. As Aristophanes and

Moliere knew, a society that
can't laugh at itself is in real
trouble.
There are people who found
An American Werewolf in Lon
don offensive because of John
Landis' bad taste and who
wouldn't go to Caveman or
Zorro, the Gay Blade — two of
the funniest movies I've seen
this year — because they sound
like stupid pictures. But
hilarious movies are often stu
pid (Bananas, Blazing Saddles,
Animal House) and bad taste is
often indigenous to comedy —
look at Shakespeare. The new
So Fine, written and directed
by Andrew Bergman, is bound
to offend somebody — some of
it is as dumb as hell and some of
it is in appalling taste — but I
had a wonderful time at it.
Andrew Bergman worked on
Blazing Saddles and wrote the
screenplay, solo, for The In-
Laws, in which Alan Arkin,
chased down a fire escape by
mobsters, shouted, "Don't
shoot — I'm a dentist!" Un
fortunately, The In-Laws was
unlucky in its director, Arthur
Hiller, who had so little notion
of how to stage a gag that he
destroyed several of Bergman's
best ideas.
Bergman may not be much
of a director either — his stag
ing is sloppy and the look of the
movie seems to concern him

very little (So Fine, shot by
James A. Contner, suffers from
bad lighting and haphazard
processing) — but at least
Bergman understands what
makes his own writing humor
ous, so he punches and sustains
his gags.
So Fine lacks a coherent

structure. Instead, Bergman
has thrown together a series of
sketches unified only by the
characters and the daffy,
ebullient nature of the com
edy. Ryan O'Neal plays Bobby
Fine, an English instructor
competing with a colleague
(David Rounds) for tenure at a

small, stuffy college. A pair
of gangsters kidnap him and
put him to work in the dress
business his father (Jack War
den) has been forced to turn
over to the mob chief, Mr. Ed
die (Richard Kiel), in conse
quence of an unpaid debt.
Bobby falls in love with Eddie's
voluptuous Italian wife, Lira
(Mariangela Melato); escaping
from her bedroom upon Ed
die's unexpected return one
night, dressed in a pair of her
too-tight jeans, he rips them,
stuffs the holes with plastic (the
only material he could find),
and thus initiates, inadvertent
ly, a craze for jeans with rear
view see-through panels.
O'Neal has neither the speed
nor the physical imagination to
play first-rate comedy, but in
his second go-round in the role
of a distracted intellectual (the
first — What's Up, Docf —
which also began with an aca
demic competition — teamed
him with Barbra Streisand,
whose effortless grace as a co
medienne really emphasized
O'Neal's conscientious klutzi
ness), he seems more assured.
His lack of skill only hurts the
movie in the sexual awakening
scenes with Melato, which
might have soared if O'Neal
could do what Cary Grant did
in Bringing Up Baby.
But Bergman has encircled
O'Neal with a cast of jokers
worthy of Preston Sturges: not
only Melato, who makes Lira
an unbridled inamorata — a
glamorous spoof of the hot
blooded Roman women in so
many Italian films — and Jack
Warden, as a businessman so
crass that he peddles his
schlocky line to customers in
Bergdorf-Goodman while the
salespeople aren't looking, but
also Richard Kiel ("Jaws" in The
Spy Who Loved Me and Moon

raker), Fred Gwynne as the
chairman of Bobby's depart
ment, Mike Kellin as a luckless
salesman, Angela Pietro Pinto
as Lira's passionate maid and
Bruce Mulholland as an eccen
tric white-haired poet.
Bergman keeps his actors
supplied with tip-top dialogue
(Lira, accosting Bobby, be
moans the fact that her hus
band is sexually "not al dente")
and the movie is full of clever
decorative detail, such as the
sign on the door of a luxurious
steam room that insists on for
mal attire for guests and a
hearse, driven by Lira, with a
built-in espresso maker.
The sort of writing Bergman
does allows him to be inconsis
tent in his depiction of charac
ters; their changes are ;o spon
taneous that they remind us of
cartoon figures. In the last se
quence of the movie, Lira
rushes backstage during a per
formance of Othello to sub for
an ailing Desdemona, and Bob
by, running from Eddie, who
has learned of their affair,
crawls onstage and tolls under
the bed; in a moment Eddie ar
rives in Othello's makeup and
costume. When these two ac
tually begin to sing the
bedchamber scene from Ver
di's opera — subtitled so that
the text is more than just par
allel to the movie's plot —
Bergman's invention reaches
its zenith. I wonder if he has
ever seen the W. C. Fields pic
ture Never Give a Sucker an
Even Break, in which a young
woman, raised alone by her
mother on a mountain top, en
counters a man for the first
time and suddenly begins to
sing, "When a body meets a
body comin' through the rye"?
It's impossible to explain pre
cisely why, but
are sublime.

an unbridled inamorata — a
glamorous spoof of the hot
blooded Roman women in so
many Italian films — and Jack
Warden, as a businessman so
crass that he peddles his
schlocky line to customers in
Bergdorf-Goodman while the
salespeople aren't looking, but
also Richard Kiel ("Jaws" in The
Spy Who Loved Me and Moon

raker), Fred Gwynne as the
chairman of Bobby's depart
ment, Mike Kellin as a luckless
salesman, Angela Pietro Pinto
as Lira's passionate maid and
Bruce Mulholland as an eccen
tric white-haired poet.
Bergman keeps his actors
supplied with tip-top dialogue
(Lira, accosting Bobby, be
moans the fact that her hus
band is sexually "not al dente")
and the movie is full of clever
decorative detail, such as the
sign on the door of a luxurious
steam room that insists on for
mal attire for guests and a
hearse, driven by Lira, with a
built-in espresso maker.
The sort of writing Bergman
does allows him to be inconsis
tent in his depiction of charac
ters; their changes are ;o spon
taneous that they remind us of
cartoon figures. In the last se
quence of the movie, Lira
rushes backstage during a per
formance of Othello to sub for
an ailing Desdemona, and Bob
by, running from Eddie, who
has learned of their affair,
crawls onstage and tolls under
the bed; in a moment Eddie ar
rives in Othello's makeup and
costume. When these two ac
tually begin to sing the
bedchamber scene from Ver
di's opera — subtitled so that
the text is more than just par
allel to the movie's plot —
Bergman's invention reaches
its zenith. I wonder if he has
ever seen the W. C. Fields pic
ture Never Give a Sucker an
Even Break, in which a young
woman, raised alone by her
mother on a mountain top, en
counters a man for the first
time and suddenly begins to
sing, "When a body meets a
body comin' through the rye"?
It's impossible to explain pre
cisely why, but
are sublime.

A certain prudishness seems
to have crept into moviegoing.
To a large extent this is the re
sult of the highly publicized ef
forts of special interest groups
to keep filmmakers from pres
enting them in an unflattering
manner; audiences are now so
cautious of the thousand and
one ways in which a comedy
might be offensive to someone
that they are afraid to laugh,
even though laughter is the
least hypocritical of all demo
crats — we all qualify as targets.
Hearing the complaints of a
number of friends — jews and
non-Jews — that the Spanish
Inquisition number in Mel
Brooks' History of the World,
Part I was anti-Semitic, I
couldn't help being amused
that anyone would accuse
Brooks, whose humor has
always been based in large part
on hisJewishness,ofanti-Semi
tism, particularly since I've
never met anyone who didn't
think that "Springtime for
Hitler" in The Producers was a
scream. The usual objection to
the Spanish Inquisition se
quence is that the sufferings of
Jews should not be made the
butt of a joke, but I don't be
lieve that there exists a subject
so sacred that it can't be made
funny. As Aristophanes and

Moliere knew, a society that
can't laugh at itself is in real
trouble.
There are people who found
An American Werewolf in Lon
don offensive because of John
Landis' bad taste and who
wouldn't go to Caveman or
Zorro, the Gay Blade — two of
the funniest movies I've seen
this year — because they sound
like stupid pictures. But
hilarious movies are often stu
pid (Bananas, Blazing Saddles,
Animal House) and bad taste is
often indigenous to comedy —
look at Shakespeare. The new
So Fine, written and directed
by Andrew Bergman, is bound
to offend somebody — some of
it is as dumb as hell and some of
it is in appalling taste — but I
had a wonderful time at it.
Andrew Bergman worked on
Blazing Saddles and wrote the
screenplay, solo, for The In-
Laws, in which Alan Arkin,
chased down a fire escape by
mobsters, shouted, "Don't
shoot — I'm a dentist!" Un
fortunately, The In-Laws was
unlucky in its director, Arthur
Hiller, who had so little notion
of how to stage a gag that he
destroyed several of Bergman's
best ideas.
Bergman may not be much
of a director either — his stag
ing is sloppy and the look of the
movie seems to concern him

very little (So Fine, shot by
James A. Contner, suffers from
bad lighting and haphazard
processing) — but at least
Bergman understands what
makes his own writing humor
ous, so he punches and sustains
his gags.
So Fine lacks a coherent

structure. Instead, Bergman
has thrown together a series of
sketches unified only by the
characters and the daffy,
ebullient nature of the com
edy. Ryan O'Neal plays Bobby
Fine, an English instructor
competing with a colleague
(David Rounds) for tenure at a

small, stuffy college. A pair
of gangsters kidnap him and
put him to work in the dress
business his father (Jack War
den) has been forced to turn
over to the mob chief, Mr. Ed
die (Richard Kiel), in conse
quence of an unpaid debt.
Bobby falls in love with Eddie's
voluptuous Italian wife, Lira
(Mariangela Melato); escaping
from her bedroom upon Ed
die's unexpected return one
night, dressed in a pair of her
too-tight jeans, he rips them,
stuffs the holes with plastic (the
only material he could find),
and thus initiates, inadvertent
ly, a craze for jeans with rear
view see-through panels.
O'Neal has neither the speed
nor the physical imagination to
play first-rate comedy, but in
his second go-round in the role
of a distracted intellectual (the
first — What's Up, Docf —
which also began with an aca
demic competition — teamed
him with Barbra Streisand,
whose effortless grace as a co
medienne really emphasized
O'Neal's conscientious klutzi
ness), he seems more assured.
His lack of skill only hurts the
movie in the sexual awakening
scenes with Melato, which
might have soared if O'Neal
could do what Cary Grant did
in Bringing Up Baby.
But Bergman has encircled
O'Neal with a cast of jokers
worthy of Preston Sturges: not
only Melato, who makes Lira
an unbridled inamorata — a
glamorous spoof of the hot
blooded Roman women in so
many Italian films — and Jack
Warden, as a businessman so
crass that he peddles his
schlocky line to customers in

destroyed several of Bergman's
best ideas.
Bergman may not be much
of a director either — his stag
ing is sloppy and the look of the
movie seems to concern him

very little (So Fine, shot by
James A. Contner, suffers from
bad lighting and haphazard
processing) — but at least
Bergman understands what
makes his own writing humor
ous, so he punches and sustains
his gags.
So Fine lacks a coherent

structure. Instead, Bergman
has thrown together a series of
sketches unified only by the
characters and the daffy,
ebullient nature of the com
edy. Ryan O'Neal plays Bobby
Fine, an English instructor
competing with a colleague
(David Rounds) for tenure at a

small, stuffy college. A pair
of gangsters kidnap him and
put him to work in the dress
business his father (Jack War
den) has been forced to turn
over to the mob chief, Mr. Ed
die (Richard Kiel), in conse
quence of an unpaid debt.
Bobby falls in love with Eddie's
voluptuous Italian wife, Lira
(Mariangela Melato); escaping
from her bedroom upon Ed
die's unexpected return one
night, dressed in a pair of her
too-tight jeans, he rips them,
stuffs the holes with plastic (the
only material he could find),
and thus initiates, inadvertent
ly, a craze for jeans with rear
view see-through panels.
O'Neal has neither the speed
nor the physical imagination to
play first-rate comedy, but in
his second go-round in the role
of a distracted intellectual (the
first — What's Up, Docf —
which also began with an aca
demic competition — teamed
him with Barbra Streisand,
whose effortless grace as a co
medienne really emphasized
O'Neal's conscientious klutzi
ness), he seems more assured.
His lack of skill only hurts the
movie in the sexual awakening
scenes with Melato, which
might have soared if O'Neal
could do what Cary Grant did
in Bringing Up Baby.
But Bergman has encircled
O'Neal with a cast of jokers
worthy of Preston Sturges: not
only Melato, who makes Lira
an unbridled inamorata — a
glamorous spoof of the hot
blooded Roman women in so
many Italian films — and Jack
Warden, as a businessman so
crass that he peddles his
schlocky line to customers in
Bergdorf-Goodman while the
salespeople aren't looking, but
also Richard Kiel ("Jaws" in The
Spy Who Loved Me and Moon

raker), Fred Gwynne as the
chairman of Bobby's depart
ment, Mike Kellin as a luckless
salesman, Angela Pietro Pinto
as Lira's passionate maid and
Bruce Mulholland as an eccen
tric white-haired poet.
Bergman keeps his actors
supplied with tip-top dialogue
(Lira, accosting Bobby, be
moans the fact that her hus
band is sexually "not al dente")
and the movie is full of clever
decorative detail, such as the
sign on the door of a luxurious
steam room that insists on for
mal attire for guests and a
hearse, driven by Lira, with a
built-in espresso maker.
The sort of writing Bergman
does allows him to be inconsis
tent in his depiction of charac
ters; their changes are ;o spon
taneous that they remind us of
cartoon figures. In the last se
quence of the movie, Lira
rushes backstage during a per
formance of Othello to sub for
an ailing Desdemona, and Bob
by, running from Eddie, who
has learned of their affair,
crawls onstage and tolls under
the bed; in a moment Eddie ar
rives in Othello's makeup and
costume. When these two ac
tually begin to sing the
bedchamber scene from Ver
di's opera — subtitled so that
the text is more than just par
allel to the movie's plot —
Bergman's invention reaches
its zenith. I wonder if he has
ever seen the W. C. Fields pic
ture Never Give a Sucker an
Even Break, in which a young
woman, raised alone by her
mother on a mountain top, en
counters a man for the first
time and suddenly begins to
sing, "When a body meets a
body comin' through the rye"?
It's impossible to explain pre
cisely why, but
are sublime.
