### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
A nationally prominent Stanford
anthropologist and leading feminist
scholar, Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo,
was killed in a hiking accident Sun
day while doing research in the Phil
ippines.
Her husband, Anthropology Prof.
Renato Rosaldo, notified the Univer
sity of her death by telephone yester
day morning.
According to reports by a guide
traveling with Rosaldo, she stumbled
on a narrow trail and fell off a 100-
foot cliff into a river. She was hiking
between two research sites in the
Ifugao region of the Philippines.
Rosaldo, 37, received the
Dinkelspiel award, the University's
highest honor for oustanding service
to undergraduate education, in 1979.
The University cited her"untiring in
volvement" in the Center for Re
search on Women (CROW), her
"countless efforts" for improvement
of teaching and "her qualities of
brilliance and responsiveness, not
often so happily comingled in one
person."
CROW, the Feminist Studies Pro
gram and Signs released a joint
statement expressing their shock and'
grief.
"It is impossible to believe that her
strong spirit and wise intellect will
not be among us," the statement
said. "We feel that she will always be
here, pushing us to think more deep
ly, write more clearly, teach more
passionately.
Rosaldo and Wellesley President
Nannerl Keohane were working to
gether on the spring 1982 issue of
Signs. According to Keohane, the
journal will be a special issue on
feminist theory dedicated to
Rosaldo's memory and work.
Rosaldo and Keohane, former as
sociate professor of political science
here, were instrumental in the crea
tion of Stanford's Feminist Studies
Program.
"She contributed a sharp criticism
combined with a supportive humor"
to meetings of the Committee on
Feminist Studies, Keohane said. "I'll

miss that greatly."
Reached at Wellesley, Keohane
said of Rosaldo, "She was able to
probe issues of women's place in his
tory and across cultures with theo
retical acumen that commanded the
respect of all of us, both with her re
search on women and in other
fields."
Rosaldo's best-known published
work is Woman, Culture & Society, a
collection of articles she co-edited
with Brown University Anthropology
Prof. Louise Lamphere in 1974. In it,
she stated that women's position
throughout the world is not de
termined by biology, but by cultural
factors which can be changed.
According to their book, "Our
contemporary situation renders any
'natural' ranking of differentiation of
the sexes altogether obsolete. What
we think of as men's work can be to
day performed by women and, cor
respondingly, women's work can be
performed by men."
She published a second book
based on her experiences in the Phil
ippines, Knowledge and Passion: ll
ongot Notions of Self and Social Life,
last year.
The Anthropology Department
gathered to express its collective
grief yesterday afternoon. "She was
so verbal, so alert and alive to ev
eryone," said Administrative Assis
tant Marlie Yearwood. "We're all
devastated."
Department sources said some of
Rosaldo's unpublished work in
cluded a study of bride service and
bride wealth with Anthropology
Prof. Jane Collier, as well as work on
speech act theory, images of gender
in simple societies and symbolism.
"The important thing about Shelly
was the feeling she gave to the
place," said Anthropology Ph.D. can
didate Roger Rouse. "She trans
mitted the sense that anthropologists
grapple with real issues and was very
good at making her students feel
that."
Rouse said Rosaldo, a faculty mem
ber since 1972, infused her students
with her vitality and interest in their

ideas. "There was a constant string of
material that might set ideas alight,"
he said.
Rosaldo was well known for her
ability to bring seemingly ethereal
ideas down to earth and to give sym
bols practical uses. "Instead of think
ing of anthropology as an intellectual
puzzle to be solved," Rouse said,
"she had the ability to make people
think of things cultural as applicable
to real life, as intrinsically political."
A 1966 graduate of Radcliffe,
Rosaldo received her Ph.D. from
Harvard in 1972.

She is survived by her husband;
two sons, Samuel, 5, and Manuel, 14
months; her mother, Mrs. Samuel
Zimbalist, of New York; and a
brother, Andrew Zimbalist.
Friends are invited to a memorial
gathering in tribute to her today at 5
p.m. in the Round Room of Memori
al Church. According to Myra
Strober of CROW, a fund will be set
up to receive donations in Rosaldo's
memory.
A memorial service is planned in a
few weeks, when her husband re
turns from the funeral at Lake Suc
cess, N.Y.
