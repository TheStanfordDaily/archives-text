# SLAC lays off more than 100; cuts cited

The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has been forced to
lay off 114 employees because of
anticipated federal budget cuts,
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
announced last Wednesday in a
1982 fiscal outlook speech before
SLAC employees.
Though the fiscal year 1982
began Oct. 1, Congress has not yet
finalized this year's federal
budget. Panofsky said SLAC may
face budget cuts as high as 12 per
cent, the average cut for federally
funded programs. But Panofsky
said the SLAC program is well re
ceived by Department of Energy
advisers.
"I remain optimistic that the ac
tual cuts may end up below the 12
percent figure," he said.
Nonetheless, Panofsky said that
about 70 percent of the SLAC op
erating budget finances the 1400-
person payroll. This figure in
cludesll9"job shoppers" who are
not directly on the personnel
roster, but work for outside job
placement agencies under con
tract with SLAC.
Job shoppers include machin
ists, draftspeople, coil winders
and clerical workers. Their posi
tions are classified as temporary,
though some job shoppers have
worked at SLAC three or four
years.
Only 30 percent of the SLAC
budget goes toward operational
expenses. These expenditures in
clude overhead costs paid to the
University, the Fire Department
and lease of the SLAC computer.
Panofsky said that because the
30 percent operational costs are
untouchable, a 12 percent overall
budget cut at SLAC necessitates
laying off thell4job shoppers and
freezing aproximately 50 new un
filled positions.
SLAC gave the job shoppers one
day's notice of the layoffs.
Cancellation came as a "shock",
said Richard Ghilberti, a vice pres
ident of H. L. Yoh, one of the tem
porary job firms utilized by SLAC.
He said workers were upset at
their contract losses and angry at
the one day's notice. Ghilberti
said he has only been able to re
place 14 of his 55 job shoppers.

"I'll be lucky to find places for
50 percent in the next two weeks,"
he said.
However, Terry Huston, recruit
ing manager for Entechs, another
job firm utilized by SLAC, said she
replaced all 25 of her workers in
new jobs.
Five job shoppers whose
salaries are paid by sources out
side the University retained their
jobs.
Panofsky expressed hope that
the announced layoffs might be
reversed. "Should Congress de
cide to restore some or all of the
cuts, we should be in a position to
benefit from such restoration," he
said.

If Congress grants additional
funds to the center, Panofsky said
his first priority will be to rehire
some of the job shoppers.
Regular salaried employees will
not face salary cuts, but other
layoffs may follow. Panofsky said
SLAC may reinstate "Scrooge
days" to try to avoid such layoffs.
Scrooge days were days of leave
without pay successfully instituted
during the Nixon administration
to equalize the financial burden
over the entire payroll, according
to SLAC Assistant Director of Per
sonnel Bernard Lighthouse.
Despite all budget cuts in staff,
Panofsky said the SLAC program
can expect shorter running peri
ods and longer shutdowns for this
fiscal year. SLAC normally oper
ates on a running period, non
running period system. Labora
tory research occurs during the
running periods. Machinery work
consumes the non-running times.
SLAC is expected to shut down
from April to October to meet this
year's budget cuts. If more funds
become available, the program
will not shut down until July.
Panofsky said he plans to con
tinue the running period "until
the money runs out." But he said
the new budget plan is not cost ef-

fective for the government.
He also said the linear accelerator
must run for shorter periods of time
to reduce electricity costs. If the ac
celerator consumes above a 37.5
megawatt ceiling it is ineligible for
public power rate benefits, and
higher commercial rates must be
paid.
He said SLAC's highest priority will
be the Positron Electron Project (PEP)
which had productive results last
year in matter exploration. But other
major projects such as the Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC), an addition to
the accelerator, will have to remain
in the research and developmental
stages this year because of the
budget cuts.
