# Dowries cause pains in India
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi, India — What's a
husband worth? In this male
dominated society, the answer
is "a lot."
On India's increasingly lu
crative marriage market the
most eligible bachelors, those
with budding careers in elite
branches of the country's ad
ministrative or police service,
command as much as $45,000 in
dowry. Engineers come next at
$40,000, followed by physicians
at $35,000.
Any college graduate can get
a bride with a dowry ranging
up to $5650, while brides with
less affluent parents can pick
up a college dropout for half
that.
In a country where the aver
age per capita income is $160,
dowries sometims run 10 to 20
times a fatner's annual income.
The figures, part of an anti
dowry exhibition that opened
recently in the capital, were
compiled by an aggressive
women's rights group known
as the Mahila Dakshata Samiti,
or Women's Vigilance Com
mittee.
"We've got to end this belief
that women are objects that are
to be bargained over," said the
committee's chairman,
Pramilla Dandavate, a member
of India's lower house of Par
liament.
Banned 20 years ago
Although dowries were of
ficially banned by Parliament
20 years ago, they continues to
flourish. In a country where
most marriages are still ar
ranged by the parents, the
greed of the groom's family is
matched by intense social pres
sures to marry daughters early
and well.
Driven by the increased ac
cess to consumer goods by In
dia's urban middle classes, the
size of dowries has increased
sharply in recent years.
Rather than straight cash, the
dowry usually comes in a mix
ture of household appliances,
motor scooters, education fees
and other forms of material
support.
According to Dandavate, the
committee's dowry figures
were compiled from hundreds

of interviews with parents of
recently married daughters.
She said they were higher
than those mentioned in a 1974
government report on the
problem, a fact she attributed
to inflation and increased ag
gressiveness on the part of
grooms' parents, who often
view dowry as a once-in-a-life
time windfall to secure their
son's and their own financial
futures.
Dowries and corruption
Exorbitant dowries are ac
knowledged as a prime reason
behind India's large-scale pub
lic corruption. A father feels lit
tle guilt if the bribe he solicits
will help ensure his daughter's
marriage.
There are few alternative
ways of getting the money.
Unlike material goods,
which are simply repossessed
by the owner if payments stop,
brides are rarely returned if
promised dowry demands are
not fulfilled.

Instead, they are hounded,
in some cases tortured and in
extreme instances even killed
by their in-laws.
Dandavate claimed that
more than 350 brides in the
capital last year were victims of
such disputes. Most die of
burns, disguised either as
kitchen accidents or suicides.
The Women's Vigilance
Committee 'has demanded
stricter enforcement of a re
cent order requiring an autop
sy by two doctors on any young
woman dying an unnatural
death who has been married
less than five years.
Dandavate has also sub
mitted a parliamentary bill to
close loopholes in the current
anti-dowry legislation. The bill
has been accepted by Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's gov
ernment.
The anti-dowry exhibition is
scheduled to tour several
northern cities after it closes in
New Delhi.

flourish. In a country where
most marriages are still ar
ranged by the parents, the
greed of the groom's family is
matched by intense social pres
sures to marry daughters early
and well.
Driven by the increased ac
cess to consumer goods by In
dia's urban middle classes, the
size of dowries has increased
sharply in recent years.
Rather than straight cash, the
dowry usually comes in a mix
ture of household appliances,
motor scooters, education fees
and other forms of material
support.
According to Dandavate, the
committee's dowry figures
were compiled from hundreds

of interviews with parents of
recently married daughters.
She said they were higher
than those mentioned in a 1974
government report on the
problem, a fact she attributed
to inflation and increased ag
gressiveness on the part of
grooms' parents, who often
view dowry as a once-in-a-life
time windfall to secure their
son's and their own financial
futures.
Dowries and corruption
Exorbitant dowries are ac
knowledged as a prime reason
behind India's large-scale pub
lic corruption. A father feels lit
tle guilt if the bribe he solicits
will help ensure his daughter's
marriage.
There are few alternative
ways of getting the money.
Unlike material goods,
which are simply repossessed
by the owner if payments stop,
brides are rarely returned if
promised dowry demands are
not fulfilled.

Instead, they are hounded,
in some cases tortured and in
extreme instances even killed
by their in-laws.
Dandavate claimed that
more than 350 brides in the
capital last year were victims of
such disputes. Most die of
burns, disguised either as
kitchen accidents or suicides.
The Women's Vigilance
Committee 'has demanded
stricter enforcement of a re
cent order requiring an autop
sy by two doctors on any young
woman dying an unnatural
death who has been married
less than five years.
Dandavate has also sub
mitted a parliamentary bill to
close loopholes in the current
anti-dowry legislation. The bill
has been accepted by Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's gov
ernment.
The anti-dowry exhibition is
scheduled to tour several
northern cities after it closes in
New Delhi.
New Delhi, India — What's a
husband worth? In this male
dominated society, the answer
is "a lot."
On India's increasingly lu
crative marriage market the
most eligible bachelors, those
with budding careers in elite
branches of the country's ad
ministrative or police service,
command as much as $45,000 in
dowry. Engineers come next at
$40,000, followed by physicians
at $35,000.
Any college graduate can get
a bride with a dowry ranging
up to $5650, while brides with
less affluent parents can pick
up a college dropout for half
that.
In a country where the aver
age per capita income is $160,
dowries sometims run 10 to 20
times a fatner's annual income.
The figures, part of an anti
dowry exhibition that opened
recently in the capital, were
compiled by an aggressive
women's rights group known
as the Mahila Dakshata Samiti,
or Women's Vigilance Com
mittee.
"We've got to end this belief
that women are objects that are
to be bargained over," said the
committee's chairman,
Pramilla Dandavate, a member
of India's lower house of Par
liament.
Banned 20 years ago
Although dowries were of
ficially banned by Parliament
20 years ago, they continues to
flourish. In a country where
most marriages are still ar
