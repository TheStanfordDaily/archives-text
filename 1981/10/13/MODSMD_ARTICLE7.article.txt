# Poles resort to barter; zloty weak
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland — Burglars
who broke into a food store in
the village of Kolacin 60 miles
south of here recently stole a
considerable quantity of
vodka, wine, chocolate, sugar
and other products, but they
ignored the money in the cash
drawer.
"They took only the valuable
things," the newspaper Green
Banner said.
The newspaper was not kid
ding. The zloty is in such dis
repute that even the Russian
ruble and other East Bloc cur
rencies attract a premium price
among Polish black market
eers.
The collapse of Poland's cur
rency is an important factor in
the current crisis, contributing
to rampant inflation and
pushing Poland backward in
time toward an economy based
more on barter and less on
money.
It has also, however, made
the American dollar virtually a

second Polish currency. The
dollar and other convertible
Western currencies are much
in demand because they can be
used to buy imported goods
that are otherwise unavailable.
Glut of zlotys
The problem is that there are
so many zlotys around and so
few things to buy. "Inflationary
overhang," as it is called here,
is estimated at 900 billion zlotys
(almost $27 billion) and isgrow
ing at a rate of 45 million a day.
"If money is more abundant
than goods, the goods disap
pear immediately because
their value is greater than that
of the money," Danuta Za
grodzka, an analyst for the
magazine Polityka, observed.
Czeslaw Bobrowski, a lead
ing Polish economist, writing in
the newspaper Life of Warsaw,
put it this way:
"Shop shelves are empty not
only because supplies have
dwindled but also because of
the flight from money, because
of people buying and stock
piling everything there is to

buy. More and more people,
starting with farmers and end
ing with miners, express
doubts whether there is really
any point in working if there is
nothing you can buy for what
you earn."
While the government and
the Solidarity free trade union
federation argue about the
best way to cure the problem
(immediate price increases to
soak up the extra cash? A
freeze on savings accounts?
Scrapping the zloty in favor of a
revalued one?) individual Poles
are trying to cope in more prac
tical ways.
Barter is increasingly com
monplace, particularly in rural
areas. Farmers do not want
zlotys, but they will sell their
livestock to the state in return
for a chance to buy coal.
Barter is a growing
phenomenon in the cities, as
well. In Warsaw, one sees
handwritten signs on bulletin
boards in government min
istries offering to exchange
cigarettes for canned meat
products or beer.
Long lines for goods
Bartering is another factor in
the long lines that can be seen
all over the city. People don't
line up just for goods they
need. "If they see something a

little different that they think
they can trade, they buy it,"
one Western resident said.
Complicating the picture is
the fact that, unlike the situ
ation in the Soviet Union, it is
legal for Poles to have Western
hard, or convertible currency.
In fact, it is estimated that they
now hold some $1.5 billion.
The Western currencies can
be used to buy the imported
goods sold in the 400 special
shops around the country.
A Western visitor is inun
dated with offers to change
money. The going rate is at
least 10 times the official ex
change of 33.7 zlotys to the
dollar. That's double the black
market rate of only a year ago,
according to Polish sources.
Asked the appropriate tip for
a bellman, the concierge at
Warsaw's Victoria Inter-Con
tinental Hotel replied: "100
zlotys or $1.
Restaurants offer a 25 per
cent discount for paying with a
Western credit card.
Just after World War 11, re
called one Pole, the mere
possession of U.S. currency was
a crime here, punishable by
death. "We've come a long
way since then," he laughed.

doubts whether there is really
any point in working if there is
nothing you can buy for what
you earn."
While the government and
the Solidarity free trade union
federation argue about the
best way to cure the problem
(immediate price increases to
soak up the extra cash? A
freeze on savings accounts?
Scrapping the zloty in favor of a
revalued one?) individual Poles
are trying to cope in more prac
tical ways.
Barter is increasingly com
monplace, particularly in rural
areas. Farmers do not want
zlotys, but they will sell their
livestock to the state in return
for a chance to buy coal.
Barter is a growing
phenomenon in the cities, as
well. In Warsaw, one sees
handwritten signs on bulletin
boards in government min
istries offering to exchange
cigarettes for canned meat
products or beer.
Long lines for goods
Bartering is another factor in
the long lines that can be seen
all over the city. People don't
line up just for goods they
need. "If they see something a

little different that they think
they can trade, they buy it,"
one Western resident said.
Complicating the picture is
the fact that, unlike the situ
ation in the Soviet Union, it is
legal for Poles to have Western
hard, or convertible currency.
In fact, it is estimated that they
now hold some $1.5 billion.
The Western currencies can
be used to buy the imported
goods sold in the 400 special
shops around the country.
A Western visitor is inun
dated with offers to change
money. The going rate is at
least 10 times the official ex
change of 33.7 zlotys to the
dollar. That's double the black
market rate of only a year ago,
according to Polish sources.
Asked the appropriate tip for
a bellman, the concierge at
Warsaw's Victoria Inter-Con
tinental Hotel replied: "100
zlotys or $1.
Restaurants offer a 25 per
cent discount for paying with a
Western credit card.
Just after World War 11, re
called one Pole, the mere
possession of U.S. currency was
a crime here, punishable by
death. "We've come a long
way since then," he laughed.
The problem is that the zloty
has not.
Warsaw, Poland — Burglars
who broke into a food store in
the village of Kolacin 60 miles
south of here recently stole a
considerable quantity of
vodka, wine, chocolate, sugar
and other products, but they
ignored the money in the cash
drawer.
"They took only the valuable
things," the newspaper Green
Banner said.
The newspaper was not kid
ding. The zloty is in such dis
repute that even the Russian
ruble and other East Bloc cur
rencies attract a premium price
among Polish black market
eers.
The collapse of Poland's cur
rency is an important factor in
the current crisis, contributing
to rampant inflation and
pushing Poland backward in
time toward an economy based
more on barter and less on
money.
It has also, however, made
the American dollar virtually a

second Polish currency. The
dollar and other convertible
Western currencies are much
in demand because they can be
used to buy imported goods
that are otherwise unavailable.
Glut of zlotys
The problem is that there are
so many zlotys around and so
few things to buy. "Inflationary
overhang," as it is called here,
is estimated at 900 billion zlotys
(almost $27 billion) and isgrow
ing at a rate of 45 million a day.
"If money is more abundant
than goods, the goods disap
pear immediately because
their value is greater than that
of the money," Danuta Za
grodzka, an analyst for the
magazine Polityka, observed.
Czeslaw Bobrowski, a lead
ing Polish economist, writing in
the newspaper Life of Warsaw,
put it this way:
"Shop shelves are empty not
only because supplies have
dwindled but also because of
the flight from money, because
of people buying and stock
piling everything there is to

buy. More and more people,
starting with farmers and end
ing with miners, express
doubts whether there is really
any point in working if there is
nothing you can buy for what
you earn."
