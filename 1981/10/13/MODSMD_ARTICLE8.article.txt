# Norway tests supply-side theory
## 
### Washington Post 
London — With a mandate from voters
to reduce taxes and the reach of govern
ment, Norway's new Conservative Prime
Minister Kaare Willoch takes office today
at a time of uncertainty and change
throughout Scandinavia.
After decades of post-war political con
sensus, steady economic growth and ex
panding government social programs,
Scandinavia's wealthy welfare state socie
ties are under strain. Willoch's per
formance will be watched closely as a test
of whether his supply-side economics can
help solve their problems of high taxes, in
creasing inflation, declining growth, rising
unemployment, burgeoning bureaucra
cies and big budget deficits.
"Norwegians are not tired of the welfare
state," Willoch told the record number of
foreign reporters who went to Oslo for last
month's election. "But they know you can
not pay for a welfare state without eco
nomic growth, and you cannot have eco
nomic growth with taxes as high as ours."
Exiting Labor party
Willoch's minority Conservative gov
ernment will replace the left-of-center La
bor government of outgoing Prime Min
ister Gro Harlem Brundtland, which was
defeated in last month's national election.
Pundits described the result as a "conser
vative wave" of mostly younger voters
moving to the right in protest of high taxes
and big government bureaucracy.
Willoch's Conservatives, who dramati
cally increased their representation in the
155-seat Norwegian Parliament from 41 to
54, will have the silent backing of there

ligious Christian Peoples Party, with 15
seats, and the farmer-based Center Party,
with 11. They did not join in what could
have been an 80-seat coalition govern
ment because the Conservatives would
not agree to a demand by the Christian
Peoples Party that Norway's liberal abor
tion law be repealed.
This could make it more difficult for
Willoch to achieve his goals of holding

down government spending while reduc
ing taxes and stimulating parts of the Nor
wegian economy that do not benefit from
the country's considerable North Sea oil
revenues. Willoch already has said that
change would be gradual.
Reduce, not dismantle
He also has emphasized that he aims
only to bring under control rather than
dismantle the generous welfare state social
programs built up by the Labor Party in
Norway ahd by sister Social Democratic
parties in neighboring Scandinavian coun

tries. The tightening squeeze of world re
cession on the export-dependent Scan
dinavian economies in recent years has
made it more difficult to pay for their wel
fare state programs without raising taxes so
high or allowing government budget defi
cits to grow so large that they make the
countries' economic problems worse.
The increasingly painful pinch of high
taxes has helped increase voter support
significantly for conservative parties in
Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in
elections and opinion polls in recentyears.
But much of the conservatives' new sup
port has come from fading centrist parties
leaving the social democratic parties still
the largest in all four countries.
Results a must
This means the conservatives must pro
duce results or they soon will be replaced,
according to Scandinavian politicians and
analysts. "Those young voters who
switched to the conservatives will be frus
trated and turned off if taxes, for example,
are not cut as they expect," Henry Valen, a
leading Norwegian political and public
opinion analyst, warned in Oslo.
He pointed to the sharp increase in votes
for the far-right Progress Party in the Nor
wegian election. It unexpectedly won four
seats in Parliament on promises to try to
stop growth of the welfare state and end all
government intervention in the economy.
In neighboring Sweden, a shifting gov
ernment coalition of right-of-center
parties so far has failed during the past five
years to reduce government spending or
taxes.

taxes.
London — With a mandate from voters
to reduce taxes and the reach of govern
ment, Norway's new Conservative Prime
Minister Kaare Willoch takes office today
at a time of uncertainty and change
throughout Scandinavia.
After decades of post-war political con
sensus, steady economic growth and ex
panding government social programs,
Scandinavia's wealthy welfare state socie
ties are under strain. Willoch's per
formance will be watched closely as a test
of whether his supply-side economics can
help solve their problems of high taxes, in
creasing inflation, declining growth, rising
unemployment, burgeoning bureaucra
cies and big budget deficits.
"Norwegians are not tired of the welfare
state," Willoch told the record number of
foreign reporters who went to Oslo for last
month's election. "But they know you can
not pay for a welfare state without eco
nomic growth, and you cannot have eco
nomic growth with taxes as high as ours."
Exiting Labor party
Willoch's minority Conservative gov
ernment will replace the left-of-center La
bor government of outgoing Prime Min
ister Gro Harlem Brundtland, which was
defeated in last month's national election.
Pundits described the result as a "conser
vative wave" of mostly younger voters
moving to the right in protest of high taxes
and big government bureaucracy.
Willoch's Conservatives, who dramati
cally increased their representation in the
155-seat Norwegian Parliament from 41 to
54, will have the silent backing of there

ligious Christian Peoples Party, with 15
seats, and the farmer-based Center Party,
with 11. They did not join in what could
have been an 80-seat coalition govern
ment because the Conservatives would
not agree to a demand by the Christian
Peoples Party that Norway's liberal abor
tion law be repealed.
This could make it more difficult for
Willoch to achieve his goals of holding

down government spending while reduc
ing taxes and stimulating parts of the Nor
wegian economy that do not benefit from
the country's considerable North Sea oil
revenues. Willoch already has said that
change would be gradual.
Reduce, not dismantle
He also has emphasized that he aims
only to bring under control rather than
dismantle the generous welfare state social
programs built up by the Labor Party in
Norway ahd by sister Social Democratic
parties in neighboring Scandinavian coun

tries. The tightening squeeze of world re
cession on the export-dependent Scan
dinavian economies in recent years has
made it more difficult to pay for their wel
fare state programs without raising taxes so
high or allowing government budget defi
cits to grow so large that they make the
countries' economic problems worse.
The increasingly painful pinch of high
taxes has helped increase voter support
significantly for conservative parties in
Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in
elections and opinion polls in recentyears.
But much of the conservatives' new sup
port has come from fading centrist parties
leaving the social democratic parties still
the largest in all four countries.
Results a must
This means the conservatives must pro
duce results or they soon will be replaced,
according to Scandinavian politicians and
analysts. "Those young voters who
switched to the conservatives will be frus
trated and turned off if taxes, for example,
are not cut as they expect," Henry Valen, a
leading Norwegian political and public
opinion analyst, warned in Oslo.
He pointed to the sharp increase in votes
for the far-right Progress Party in the Nor
wegian election. It unexpectedly won four
seats in Parliament on promises to try to
stop growth of the welfare state and end all
government intervention in the economy.
In neighboring Sweden, a shifting gov
ernment coalition of right-of-center
parties so far has failed during the past five
years to reduce government spending or
taxes.
