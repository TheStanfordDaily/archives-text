# Hopes, problems figure in African future

Nairobi, Kenya (AP) —
"Slowly, slowly," goes an Ethi
opian proverb, "an egg will
walk by its own feet." Op
timists who see Africa as a sym
bolic egg say it will hatch into
prosperity by the year 2000.
Others expect it, if not to crack,
to simply rot away.
The record is bleak: a dozen
wars, five million refugees,
growing starvation among a
population expected to double

in 20 years. Each year, African
problems affect the developed
world with greater impact.
A significant number of op
timists say emergent Africa
started off tragically but say this
has produced a new realistic
approach.
New pragmaticism
"We had to see for ourselves,
like a kid who was told not to
play with matches," says Elebe
Ma Ekonzo, a Zairian Cabinet

minister and writer. "We were
burned, and now we know."
The new realism, cited by the
optimists, has begun to make
an impact. Nearly half the
emerging nations espouse a
form of state socialism, much
of it tinged with Marxist-
Leninist ideology, but most
now see a role for private en
terprise if it aids development.
Vast mineral deposits, fertile
lands and rich human re
sources lend weight to op
timism. But, at the same time,
Africa's immense diversity
stimulates internal conflict and
outside interference.
Since 1960, the number of
mouths to feed has doubled,
but food production has hardly
grown. Nearly half the people
on the continent face possibly
critical food shortages. An
African born today, on aver
age, will not live to 45. One in
five will die within a year.
Total economic aid of $6
billion yearly does not cover
food imports.
Lower birth rate needed
Old ways of life, like the
herds of game, dwindle, but
the tradition of large families
remains. Political turmoil,
scanty communication with ru
ral areas and religious taboos
hinder family planning.
In Kenya, the average moth
er has eight children, and the
population grows 4 percent a
year, the world's highest rate.
Kenya's economy, growing 1 Vi
percent a year, slips ever
farther behind.
Gulfs are widening between
rich and poor. Of the world's
31 poorest countries, 21 are in
Africa. Their inhabitants earn
75 cents a day on average. But
most use no money at all, living
on subsistence plots as they did
when outsiders first explored
African coasts.
"Africa is dying," Fdem Kod
jo, head of the Organization of

African Unity, said last year.
Without change, he added,
Africa might become "a
perfect model for coun
terdevelopment."
Crises threaten to dim the
bright spots. Tanzania raised its
literacy rate from 10 to 75 per
cent since independence 20
years ago, but cannot pay its
teachers. Zambia built hospi
tals but patients must bring
their own food and medicine
and sometimes sleep three to a
bed.
Most African borders were
drawn at a conference of Eu
ropean powers in Berlin, in
1884, with little regard for the
tribes that were split, the re
sources that were separated
from badlands.
In the mid-20th century, in
dependence came suddenly.
Foreign powers and businesses
began what Tanzanian Presi
dent Julius Nyerere called "the
second scramble for Africa.''
Inexperienced nations loaded
up on overpriced technology
that created new dependence.
Since then, world crises have
hurt. Africans must now pro
duce four times more than they
did 30 years ago to buy the
same things. The cost of im
porting oil is especially ruin
ous, taking 30 percent of what
Africans earn through their
own exports.
Droughts and floods cripple
fragile economies, and often
governments cannot aid vic
tims, much less repair damage.
At the same time, mismanage
ment, corruption and tribalism
take a calamitous toll.
Power elites formed, and
leaders in almost every nation
dismantled democratic institu
tions to ensure that the opposi
tion could not unseat them.
Still, half of the leaders who
brought their nations to inde
pendence were deposed later
in military coups.

Vast mineral deposits, fertile
lands and rich human re
sources lend weight to op
timism. But, at the same time,
Africa's immense diversity
stimulates internal conflict and
outside interference.
Since 1960, the number of
mouths to feed has doubled,
but food production has hardly
grown. Nearly half the people
on the continent face possibly
critical food shortages. An
African born today, on aver
age, will not live to 45. One in
five will die within a year.
Total economic aid of $6
billion yearly does not cover
food imports.
Lower birth rate needed
Old ways of life, like the
herds of game, dwindle, but
the tradition of large families
remains. Political turmoil,
scanty communication with ru
ral areas and religious taboos
hinder family planning.
In Kenya, the average moth
er has eight children, and the
population grows 4 percent a
year, the world's highest rate.
Kenya's economy, growing 1 Vi
percent a year, slips ever
farther behind.
Gulfs are widening between
rich and poor. Of the world's
31 poorest countries, 21 are in
Africa. Their inhabitants earn
75 cents a day on average. But
most use no money at all, living
on subsistence plots as they did
when outsiders first explored
African coasts.
"Africa is dying," Fdem Kod
jo, head of the Organization of

African Unity, said last year.
Without change, he added,
Africa might become "a
perfect model for coun
terdevelopment."
Crises threaten to dim the
bright spots. Tanzania raised its
literacy rate from 10 to 75 per
cent since independence 20
years ago, but cannot pay its
teachers. Zambia built hospi
tals but patients must bring
their own food and medicine
and sometimes sleep three to a
bed.
Most African borders were
drawn at a conference of Eu
ropean powers in Berlin, in
1884, with little regard for the
tribes that were split, the re
sources that were separated
from badlands.
In the mid-20th century, in
dependence came suddenly.
Foreign powers and businesses
began what Tanzanian Presi
dent Julius Nyerere called "the
second scramble for Africa.''
Inexperienced nations loaded
up on overpriced technology
that created new dependence.
Since then, world crises have
hurt. Africans must now pro
duce four times more than they
did 30 years ago to buy the
same things. The cost of im
porting oil is especially ruin
ous, taking 30 percent of what
Africans earn through their
own exports.
Droughts and floods cripple
fragile economies, and often
governments cannot aid vic
tims, much less repair damage.
At the same time, mismanage
ment, corruption and tribalism
take a calamitous toll.
Power elites formed, and
leaders in almost every nation
dismantled democratic institu
tions to ensure that the opposi
tion could not unseat them.
Still, half of the leaders who
brought their nations to inde
pendence were deposed later
in military coups.
Nairobi, Kenya (AP) —
"Slowly, slowly," goes an Ethi
opian proverb, "an egg will
walk by its own feet." Op
timists who see Africa as a sym
bolic egg say it will hatch into
prosperity by the year 2000.
Others expect it, if not to crack,
to simply rot away.
The record is bleak: a dozen
wars, five million refugees,
growing starvation among a
population expected to double

in 20 years. Each year, African
problems affect the developed
world with greater impact.
A significant number of op
timists say emergent Africa
started off tragically but say this
has produced a new realistic
approach.
New pragmaticism
"We had to see for ourselves,
like a kid who was told not to
play with matches," says Elebe
Ma Ekonzo, a Zairian Cabinet

minister and writer. "We were
burned, and now we know."
The new realism, cited by the
optimists, has begun to make
an impact. Nearly half the
emerging nations espouse a
form of state socialism, much
of it tinged with Marxist-
Leninist ideology, but most
now see a role for private en
terprise if it aids development.
