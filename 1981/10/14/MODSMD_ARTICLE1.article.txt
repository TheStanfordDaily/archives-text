# ASSU sets fee election
## 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU Senate last night placed 15 organizations on
the ballot for the autumn fee assessment election Oct. 28
and 29.
The Senate approved every group which the Senate Fi
nance Committee had previously approved. These in
clude all 10 groups which asked to be placed on the
ballot this year and five groups already on the ballot from
last spring.
New groups with one quarter fee assessments include
the Bridge, Stanford Alumni Network, Stanford Commit
tee on Political Education (SCOPE), Stanford for Environ
mental Education, Stanford Progressive Alliance, Stan
ford Women's Center, and Volunteers in Asia (VIA).
New groups trying for two quarter assessments are the
Academic Organizations Board, the Stanford Band, and
the Campus Entertainment Board.
Groups approved from last year are the Boathouse,
Graduate Student Association, Legal Counseling (3 quar
ters), Program fee (2 quarters), and the Publications
I? ...
Each fall quarter fee assessment will cost students $1 if
it passes. However, if the fee assessment is for more than
one quarter, students will have to pay another $1 each
additional quarter.
Following the Senate Finance Committee recommen
dations, Senate members voted to support all but two of

the fee assessments. SCOPE and VIA received neutral
recommendations.
"If an organization presents a financially sound
budget and shows a serious intent to serve the Stanford
community, then we want to let the students have a
chance to decide on the ballot," said Mark Epstein, sen
ate finance chairman.
One group which was not placed on the ballot was the
Cultural Program Board, because its proposal has not yet
been finalized.
According to Fred Buhl, Council of Presidents mem
ber who has been working to start the new group, the
board would handle funding for the Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Black Students Union, Movimen
to Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, and the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization. All these groups are currently
included in the program fee funding.
"We are hoping to bring them (the organizations) into
the mainstream of the ASSU and to facilitate better rela
tions between the minority and majority communities at
Stanford," Buhl s?iid.
Buhl also said he did not introduce the proposed
board on the senate floor because the Asian community
wished to discuss the matter further.
"We will do some research, and spring quarter you
may see a board of this type," Buhl said. "It is a positive
move for the ASSU."
