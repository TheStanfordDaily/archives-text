# Student board scouts guest professors

You'd probably expect Stanford to har
bor a stable pool of professors, top-notch
but beyond student influence.
But a student organization, the Guest
Professorship Board, does indeed have an
influence on the academic atmosphere
here. The board brings special professors
here each year in an effort to provide vari
ety in education.
"This is one of the only opportunities on
campus for students to really take a hand in
what they're being taught," said Luke
Cole, chairman/facilitator of the Guest
Professorship Board.
According to Cole, the board began in
the late 1960s as a tool to bring to campus
professors who , could supplement and
complement a Stanford education. The
board's purpose has changed little since
then.
"We're still trying to bring people to
campus who will offer a different per
spective, hopefully stir up constructive
controversy on campus," Cole said.
The Guest Professorship Board is a com
pletely student-run organization. At the
heart of the board is a core committee of
five people, a new addition this year.
The core committee assumes overall re
sponsibility for the board, especially for
fiscal arrangements, and also provides gui
dance, assistance and coordination. Cole
explained, "The core committee is like a
resource for other people on the board to
come to."
Tod Bergstrom, a member of the core
committee, said, "The neat thing about the
guest professorship board is that anyone
from the school can come in and invite
whoever they feel would be a good guest
professor. All you have to do is have an
idea of who you'd like to bring . . . and
write that person and ask him to become a

guest professor."
If the prospective professor responds
positively to the request, the board's ma
chinery starts churning to make all the
necessary arrangements, such as for travel,
housing, classroom space and office hours.
Bergstrom said, "There's a whole range of
activities that people can get involved
with."
Guest professors' expenses are paid with
student fee assesment funds. Cole ex
plained, "The students pay the salary
through the fee assessment. Every single
student is helping to pay for the organiza
tion."

The board also raises funds through oth
er University organizations and sponsors
fund-raising events given by the visiting
professors.
The only arrangement the students do
not handle is the accreditation of guest
professors. Laura Selznick, director of the
Undergraduate Special Programs through
which many guest professors are ac
credited, explained, "The accreditation
for guest professors comes from the Uni
versity and there cannot be a guest pro

fessor unless there is University credit."
In the past, the Guest Professorship
Board has had tremendous success in its
recruitment of guest professors. Last year,
for example, it brought three professors:
former Illinois Congressman and presi
dential candidate John Anderson, en
vironmentalist David Brower and educa
tion lobbyist Andre Burnett.
According to Bergstrom, all three pro
fessors were able to bring "a practical and
realistic perspective to education not nor
mally found at Stanford."
Last year's guest professors also strove to
make an impact on students and on the
campus outside of the classroom. Brower's
course put out a newspaper, Anderson
participated in a number of symposiums,
and Burnett was asked to remain here as
professional co-director of SWOPSI.
Although the board has no concrete
plans yet for this year's guest professors, it
does have a number of ideas and possi
bilities in the works. It is trying to get up a
journalist series, and also arrange for a
playwright or resident artist to teach for a
quarter. Bergstrom said that a couple of
feminists are very interested in co
teaching a course spring quarter.
It is not unusual at the beginning of the
year for the board not to know who the
guest professors will be. "At iliis point
we're actually ahead of the game,"
Bergstrom noted, "just for the fact that
we've written letters to people and we
have a basic plan that we're going to try to
follow."
"Last year a lot of people with a great
deal of enthusiasm showed up. We
worked well together and we ac
complished something that I think we can
be proud of," Bergstrom said.
