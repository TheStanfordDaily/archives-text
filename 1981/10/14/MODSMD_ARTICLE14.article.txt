## Viewpoint/Steve Borish Environmentalist' misleading label 
### 
Political debate often crystallizes
around a single term, or label, with
which those on one side of an issue
beat their opponents over the head.
The history of politics is full of jÂ§ch
nasty epithets: we have had "round
heads," "whigs," "commies," and
now the latest in a long series, "en
vironmentalists."
The grinning politician, ignorant
though he may be, seizes with an in
tuitive cunning on such labels, for he
knows that it is all too easy to get peo
ple to think in simple stereotypes. He
knows only too well how to berate
and insult his opponents without

considering any of the issues they
raise. He knows how to reach down
into the hidden fears of the silent ma
jority, and play on their emotional re
sponses in behalf of his own short run
self-interest.
It is interesting, in this light, to see
how much of the current political de
bate concerning conservation in
American turns on the uses of this
single term: "environmentalist."
One cannot pick up a copy of those
stellar journals Time and Newsweek
without finding the term used in an
incendiary fashion by the leading fig
ures of the day, and accepted un
critically by the editorial staff in its
stories.
Secretary of the Interior James
Watt has made much political capital
by using it, as has President Ronald
Reagan himself, in categorizing peo
ple who oppose their policies in the
areas of land use,, resource man
agement, and pollution control. Watt
has deftly singled out, for instance,
the backpacker, who wishes to be
able to hike in virgin wilderness, as an
example of what he means by an "en

vironmentalist."
The essence of what being an en
vironmentalist seems to mean is a
narrow, selfish sort of person who
does not want to "share" the vast re
sources of America with others, but
who wants them kept so that only he
and his ilk can use tl\em. As opposed
to the selfish, egotistical and self-cen
tered environmentalist, Watt speaks
as a man of the people, wisely rising
above the infantile extremism of his
opponents, and impartially adminis
tering the affairs of the interior in a
way that is fair to all Americans, not
just a few.

This is a very clever use of lan
guage, and there is no question that
he has succeeded in raising a locust
cloud of confusion in the minds of
many Americans as to what the real
issues are. But consider for a mo
ment, just what is an environmen
talist? Is it someone who is "for" the
environment? Is that what an en
vironmentalist is? This would imply
that its opposite, an "anti-environ
mentalist," is someone who is
"against" the environment.
Th? . is absurd. How can anyone be
"against" the environment? Watt
and Reagan, like ourselves, are walk
ing bags or seawater held together by
a few carbon rings. They are, like
ourselves, totally and completely de
pendent on clean air to breathe, un
contaminated water to drink, and
nourishing food to eat. Where do air,
water and food come from? They
come from the environment. Even
Watt and Reagan cannot be so short
sighted and hypnotized by their own
rhetoric that they are "against" the
environment.
What, then, is an environmen

talist? Consider again, a moment:
acid rain kills fish in the lakes and
streams not only of the Adirondacks,
but of southern Norway. Radioactive
wastes like strontium 90 and cesium
137, dumped off both coasts by the
Atomic Energy Commission with the
onset of the nuclear age, are slowly
being taken into the food chains as
ocean currents bring them to the sur
face and they are absorbed by
phytoplankton.
Every day another 50 million
gallons of liquid wastes are dumped
into industrial surface-water im
poundments; it is not surprising that
our groundwater, a resource many
times greater than all American rivers
and streams combines, is threatened.
A survey published by congress in
Oct. 1980, indicates that more than 90
percent of the 26,000 industrial sites
across the nation containing liquid
wastes go "virtually unmonitored." Is
this what is meant by "free en
terprise?"
What is an "environmentalist?"
There is no such thing; the concept
itself is meaningless. It is only a clever
stereotype created by a politician to
obscure the real question, the ques
tions that no one will face honestly.
No, no one will face it honestly: not
the Reagan administration, intent on
making the world safe for big oil and
its friends, not the American worker,
who can's see past his own paycheck,
nor the mass media, who with few ex
ceptions swallow the Reagan stere
otypes and mouth pious platitudes
about economic growth and the
need for stern fiscal measures.
What is the real issue, that no one
will face? It is not the question of
"environmentalists," but the reality
of environmental devastations reali
ty that is invisible only because we do
not want to see it, though its signs are
everywhere to be seen. It is a legacy
for which the future, if there is one,
may someday remember us and
curse our names.
