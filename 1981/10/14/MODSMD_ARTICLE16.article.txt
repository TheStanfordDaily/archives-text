## Europe fears, resents neutron bomb 
### 
In The Stanford Daily of Oct. 12,
Edward Teller, senior research fellow
of the Hoover Institution, gives an
eloquent defense of the neutron
bomb. Although he does not say so
explicitly, his argument is probably
directed against the widespread op
position in European NATO coun
tries against the recent presidential
decision to produce such a weapon.
The core of his argument seems to be
that a weapon with limited effects
would have a larger credibility in a
mutual deterrence policy. Massive
retaliation with large nuclear weap
ons lacks credibility because of the
vast destruction that would be in
curred by both parties. Teller seems
to worry that our opponents would
not believe that NATO would be will
ing to take such a risk. And, of course,
we in turn tend not to believe that
the Soviet Union would want to take

the risk.
That is why it worked until now.
This is what Teller wants to change.
Introduction of a nuclear weapon
with limited and therefore tolerable
effect will lower the deployment
threshold, assuming that its use will
not lead to an all-out nuclear war im
mediately. This is indeed what the
opponents to the president's recent
decision believe.
Still, I do not think that it is primari
ly this line of thought which is at the
bottom of the European opposition
to the neutron bomb decision. What
really worries Europeans is that the
neutron bomb or, rather, granate is a
weapon to be employed by troops in
combat. To Europeans it seems high
ly unlikely that NATO and Warsaw
Pact forces will ever meet directly on
U.S. or Russian territory. If ever they
will meet in close combat, this will in

all probability happen on European
soil. So it is in Europe that the neu
tron bomb would be used. To put the
matter bluntly, the neutron bomb
opens the possibility for the United
States and the Soviet Union to en
gage in nuclear warfare entirely out
side their own countries. That is what
European countries fear and resent.
European opposition against the
neutron bomb is, it seems to me, not
the result of a growing neutralist and
pacifist or even anti-American at
titude, but of simple, straightforward
fear. Americans may not think this a
very heroic attitude, but it is human.
Lack of consideration on the part of
the U.S. government for this all too
human European sentiment, may
well in the end lead to anti-U.S. feel
ings in Western Europe.
