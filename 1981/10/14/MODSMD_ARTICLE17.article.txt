## Investors must recognize importance of political cycles 
### 
Investors must pay special attention to
both economic and political cycles if they
expect to plan profitable overseas invest
ments in the future. Business leaders have
long recognized the impact of cyclical eco
nomic developments on their activities, but
have consistently ignored similar develop
ments in political cycles.
The key management assumption in the
acceptance of business cycles is that no mat
ter how much the economic situation may
deteriorate, the process of economic re
covery can be expected to get underway in
reasonable time, and the outlook will im
prove. No similar assumption is made in
commonly accepted approaches to political
affairs. Here, cycles are seldom isolated, if
they are recognized at all. Elected officials
and political parties, of course, rise, flourish,
and in time disappear. But these events
aren't seen as following any particular pat
tern or consistency.
A fresh approach to forecasting political
trends is needed to formulate a new, positive

strategy toward overseas investments in the
future. The essential ingredients to such an
approach are 1) recognition that enduring
political success almost unavoidably de
pends heavily upon sustained economic
progress, which is not easily achieved; 2)
awareness that the power of the market
forces cannot be denied indefinitely; 3) ac
ceptance that private entrepreneurial prin
ciples, incentives, technologies and man
agement skills are vital to competitive capital
investment performance; 4) belief that there
are longer term compounding values in in
vesting in a country when the needs are
great and the people as well as the govern
ment leaders realize that they cannot attain
their goals without foreign help; and 5) far
greater understanding by private managers
and investors of sensitive political decision
making process and the practical operations
of government in foreign nations as well as in
the United States.
The principal reason that market forces
eventually prevail must be that humans with

ingenuity and self-interest are involved in all
economic activities. The power of economic
market forces over political and governmen
tal actions can be seen in the recent break
down of government economic controls in
many parts of the world. Wage and price re
straints in the United States under the Nixon
and Carter administrations each failed to last
much longer than a year.
Spark to flames of entrepreneurship exist
in most parts of the world, in a variety of cul
tures and political systems. Moreover, within
and across nations, a basic conflict between
individual self-reliance and dependence
upon government can be found which con
tributes to or reinforces political cycles.
Entrepreneurship is a national resource
which political leaders too frequently fail to
appreciate and encourage for the better
ment of their people. Some leaders in cer
tain countries realize that a surge of en
trepreneurship can cause some political risks
for them because it demands more individ
ual freedom. But, the fundamental point is

that political cycles are accentuated by the
lack of entrepreneurial spirit. It is in the gen
eral interest to promote it.
In the global setting of the 1980s, the eco
nomic needs of developing countries in par
ticular will require more foreign investment.
Most corporation managements and ex
ecutives of major financial institutions are
now exceedingly sensitive to the political
and economic problems of nations in which
they have existing or are considering invest
ments. They tend to concentrate on un
favorable developments and carry their wor
risome thoughts into diminished actual or
future values of invested assets. No wonder
managements are hesitant to push ahead
vigorously with new expansion programs.
The current tendency for management in
vestors to confine new investments to the
most politically stable areas, particularly
where corporate control can be the greatest,
in time may produce some unsettling results.
This is because 1) politically and economical
ly "safe" investments are likely to produce

narrow profit margins as competitors also
flock to thg same havens, and 2) the "safe"
investments are almost certain to become
the areas where governments can
progressively tighten regulatory standards,
operating conditions and taxes.
Many U.S. private sector leaders take
strong stands against foreign governments,
with some justification, because political
leaders and civil servants do not com
prehend the negative impact of many even
well-intended government regulations on
the private sector's operations and invest
ment returns.
The new challenge to managements is to
seek broader and more penetrating ways to
judge the potential return from future over
seas investments not only on conventional
economic and financial grounds, but also on
calculated political grounds. The results
should be strikingly positive.

are longer term compounding values in in
vesting in a country when the needs are
great and the people as well as the govern
ment leaders realize that they cannot attain
their goals without foreign help; and 5) far

and investors of sensitive political decision

the United States.
The principal reason that market forces
eventually prevail must be that humans with

ingenuity and self-interest are involved in all
economic activities. The power of economic
market forces over political and governmen
tal actions can be seen in the recent break
down of government economic controls in
many parts of the world. Wage and price re
straints in the United States under the Nixon
and Carter administrations each failed to last
much longer than a year.
Spark to flames of entrepreneurship exist
in most parts of the world, in a variety of cul
tures and political systems. Moreover, within
and across nations, a basic conflict between
individual self-reliance and dependence
upon government can be found which con
tributes to or reinforces political cycles.
Entrepreneurship is a national resource
which political leaders too frequently fail to
appreciate and encourage for the better
ment of their people. Some leaders in cer
tain countries realize that a surge of en
trepreneurship can cause some political risks
for them because it demands more individ
ual freedom. But, the fundamental point is

that political cycles are accentuated by the
lack of entrepreneurial spirit. It is in the gen
eral interest to promote it.
In the global setting of the 1980s, the eco
nomic needs of developing countries in par
ticular will require more foreign investment.
Most corporation managements and ex
ecutives of major financial institutions are
now exceedingly sensitive to the political
and economic problems of nations in which
they have existing or are considering invest
ments. They tend to concentrate on un
favorable developments and carry their wor
risome thoughts into diminished actual or
future values of invested assets. No wonder
managements are hesitant to push ahead
vigorously with new expansion programs.
The current tendency for management in
vestors to confine new investments to the
most politically stable areas, particularly
where corporate control can be the greatest,
in time may produce some unsettling results.
This is because 1) politically and economical
ly "safe" investments are likely to produce

narrow profit margins as competitors also
flock to thg same havens, and 2) the "safe"
investments are almost certain to become
the areas where governments can
progressively tighten regulatory standards,
operating conditions and taxes.
Many U.S. private sector leaders take
strong stands against foreign governments,
with some justification, because political
leaders and civil servants do not com
prehend the negative impact of many even
well-intended government regulations on
the private sector's operations and invest
ment returns.
The new challenge to managements is to
seek broader and more penetrating ways to
judge the potential return from future over
seas investments not only on conventional
economic and financial grounds, but also on
calculated political grounds. The results
should be strikingly positive.

Investors must pay special attention to
both economic and political cycles if they
expect to plan profitable overseas invest
ments in the future. Business leaders have
long recognized the impact of cyclical eco
nomic developments on their activities, but
have consistently ignored similar develop
ments in political cycles.
The key management assumption in the
acceptance of business cycles is that no mat
ter how much the economic situation may
deteriorate, the process of economic re
covery can be expected to get underway in
reasonable time, and the outlook will im
prove. No similar assumption is made in
commonly accepted approaches to political
affairs. Here, cycles are seldom isolated, if
they are recognized at all. Elected officials
and political parties, of course, rise, flourish,
and in time disappear. But these events
aren't seen as following any particular pat
tern or consistency.
A fresh approach to forecasting political
trends is needed to formulate a new, positive

strategy toward overseas investments in the
future. The essential ingredients to such an
approach are 1) recognition that enduring
political success almost unavoidably de
pends heavily upon sustained economic
progress, which is not easily achieved; 2)
awareness that the power of the market
forces cannot be denied indefinitely; 3) ac
ceptance that private entrepreneurial prin
ciples, incentives, technologies and man
agement skills are vital to competitive capital
investment performance; 4) belief that there
are longer term compounding values in in
vesting in a country when the needs are
great and the people as well as the govern
ment leaders realize that they cannot attain
