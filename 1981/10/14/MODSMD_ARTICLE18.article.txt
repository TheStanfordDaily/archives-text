## Mobile MX basing bad idea from start 
### 
Presumably, the argument is over.
President Ronald Reagan's advisers
realized it would be politically un
wise, at least, for Reagan to forsake
his roots. Thus they told him (it ap
pears doubtful that Reagan decides
much of anything for himself these
days) he ought to spare the Western
states the ignominy of becoming the
Pentagon's toy chest, and the pro
posed mobile basing system for the
MX missile was killed. Thank you,
Edwin Meese et. a/. Nevertheless,
Mark Swanson felt compelled to
comment (Daily, Oct. 9), and he de
serves a response.
One hopes someone can convince
Swanson that the whole idea was pre
posterous to begin with, then maybe
he won't feel so bad. When one re
alizes that the mobile basing system

While the debate over basing went on, the So
viets must have been either insulted by the
low estimation of their intelligence or snicker

must have been dreamed up by some
five-star West Point grad with a yen
for new empires, an ecstatic view of
trillion-dollar debt limits, and a fond
ness for slot cars — call him a "games
theorist" if you must be polite in the
face of absurdity — then one can see
how it got started.
Swanson bases his argument in fa
vor of the mobile basing system on
the familiar hysteria — the Russians
are coming. And bringing with them

missiles which are bigger, better and
faster. Since the prevailing U.S. poli
cy (The Rules of the Game) is de
fensive, we must only protect
ourselves from the drooling com
munist monster, who is doubtless
watching us every moment with his
eyes to our alleged "window of vul
nerability" and his trembling finger
poised on the launch button. For this
reason conventional wisdom gave us
the MX and its "racetrack" basing
scheme.
But Swanson's own simple
arithmetic undermines his argument.
He claims it would be a half-hour or
so before a Soviet "first strike" would
reach its target. With a mobile basing
system we would then have time to
move our retaliatory missiles out of
the way.
What possible advantage would
this avail the American nuclear
forces? In the time we were scrambl
ing around huge missiles, which we
must assume do not get moved very
fast, we might have launched dozens,
if our cold retaliatory hearts so de
sired. By what measure do we "out
wit the enemy?"
While the debate over basing wore
on, the Soviets, for their part, must
have been either insulted by the low

estimation of their intelligence or
snickering at the Pentagon's stupid
ity. They will never be so foolish as to
launch a first strike as long as the
NATO allies maintain some
semblance of retaliation capability,
whether it be MX or Titan or Trident.
And round and round she goes...
Which prompts one to agree with
at least one point raised by Swanson
— that serious arms control is long
past necessary. One can only hope
that soon we will all find the wisdom
to give up this ridiculous charade.
Swanson also addresses himself to
his opposition — "a scattered gather
ing of selfish Great Basin groupies"
— in a rude, cynical appraisal which
betrays his ignorance of the
thousands of people who live and
work in the region and who have op
posed the racetrack scheme all
along. Not surprisingly, they do not
view the Great Basin as a wasteland,
as apparently Swanson does. They
are not "groupies" of anything. They
simply believe that their government
should not disrupt their lives and
property for the sake of an imagined
military advantage. My brother lives
out in Wendover, Utah, in the heart
of MX country, which perhaps quali
fies me as a "groupie," and not un
willingly.
In any case, I would suggest to
Swanson that he travel to Nevada and
Utah and meet some of the folks,
have a look around. Perhaps then his
opinion would be different.
