# CPI overestimates inflation
## 
### Phil Chritton 
In a rare state of agreement, lead
ing economists are calling the Con
sumer Price Index, an inflation yard
stick considered to be the world's
most quoted economic statistic,
"bizarre," "severely flawed," and
even "idiotic."
"Roughly speaking," said Michael
Boskin, research associate for the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Research
and economics professor here, "total
inflation for the decade of the '70s
was overstated by about 15 percent
(due to misleading CPI figures)."
Because the inflated statistics from
the CPI are used in calculating cost of
living adjustments for 31 million So
cial Security beneficiaries, 20 million
food stamp recipients, and eight mil
lion union workers, among others,
the issue of reforming the faulty CPI
is both significant and without real
opposition.
At the Stanford management level,
however, CPI data has, for several

years, been left out of the complex
economic forcasting system used in
calculating budgets, according to
Tim Warner, assistant provost in the
Office of Management and Budget,
and Arlene Williams, management
analyst.
The CPI quotes the current prices
in a set group of items purchased fre
quently by consumers — items re
ferred to as a "basket of goods" in
cluding everything from bread and
soap to automobiles and airline
tickets.
Each item is assigned a "weight"
according to the share of consumers'
income it receives. Finally, a total
price for the basket of goods is calcu
lated through a combination of cur
rent prices and consumption weights
for the items included. The resulting
figure is then compared to the price
of a previous year's basket of goods.
Whatever percentage increase it has
over the previous year is said to be in
flation. This process is done monthly

by the Federal Bureau of Labor and
Statistics (BLS).
Of the many deficiencies found in
the CPI, the index is set for reform in
1985 — "only one of them really mat
ters," explained Hoover Senior Fel
low Robert Hall. According to Hall,
95 percent of the problem with the
CPI is that housing and mortgage
costs are given too much weight. Not
only is the purchase price of the
home added into the index, but the
mortgage payments are as well. In ef
fect, the index counts the same con
sumption twice, he said.
"This obvious blunder in the way
(the BLS) set up the index," he said,
"grossly overstates the amount of
housing people buy."
Hall said that while the CPI predicts
housing expenditures will be greater
during periods of high interest rates,
it neglects the capital gains made by
people whose homes simultaneously
increase in value.
