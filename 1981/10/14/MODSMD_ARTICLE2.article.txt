# CPI overestimates inflation
## 
### Phil Chritton 
In a rare state of agreement, lead
ing economists are calling the Con
sumer Price Index, an inflation yard
stick considered to be the world's
most quoted economic statistic,
"bizarre," "severely flawed," and
even "idiotic."
"Roughly speaking," said Michael
Boskin, research associate for the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Research
and economics professor here, "total
inflation for the decade of the '70s
was overstated by about 15 percent
(due to misleading CPI figures)."
Because the inflated statistics from
the CPI are used in calculating cost of
living adjustments for 31 million So
cial Security beneficiaries, 20 million
food stamp recipients, and eight mil
lion union workers, among others,
the issue of reforming the faulty CPI
is both significant and without real
opposition.
At the Stanford management level,
however, CPI data has, for several

years, been left out of the complex
economic forcasting system used in
calculating budgets, according to
Tim Warner, assistant provost in the
Office of Management and Budget,
and Arlene Williams, management
analyst.
The CPI quotes the current prices
in a set group of items purchased fre
quently by consumers — items re
ferred to as a "basket of goods" in
cluding everything from bread and
soap to automobiles and airline
tickets.
Each item is assigned a "weight"
according to the share of consumers'
income it receives. Finally, a total
price for the basket of goods is calcu
lated through a combination of cur
rent prices and consumption weights
for the items included. The resulting
figure is then compared to the price
of a previous year's basket of goods.
Whatever percentage increase it has
over the previous year is said to be in
flation. This process is done monthly

by the Federal Bureau of Labor and
Statistics (BLS).
Of the many deficiencies found in
the CPI, the index is set for reform in
1985 — "only one of them really mat
ters," explained Hoover Senior Fel
low Robert Hall. According to Hall,
95 percent of the problem with the
CPI is that housing and mortgage
costs are given too much weight. Not
only is the purchase price of the
home added into the index, but the
mortgage payments are as well. In ef
fect, the index counts the same con
sumption twice, he said.
"This obvious blunder in the way
(the BLS) set up the index," he said,
"grossly overstates the amount of
housing people buy."
Hall said that while the CPI predicts
housing expenditures will be greater
during periods of high interest rates,
it neglects the capital gains made by
people whose homes simultaneously
increase in value.
Hall also criticized the index be
cause it considers most consumers
today to be buying homes at the cur
rent interest rate, and does not ac
curately reflect the vast majority of
people who already own homes with
lower fixed mortgage interest rates
from five, 10 or 25 years ago.
All of these miscalculations tend to
raise greatly the CPI inflation rate,
though few consumers are actually
buying houses, according to Hall.
Hall also said that policy-makers
currently in office, including those in
the Reagan Administration, will com
ment very little on the CPI because
past administrations have been ac
cused of tampering with data in or
der to make the rate of inflation ap
pear lower.
In the September 24, 1981 issue of
The Wall Street Journal, Martin Fels
tein, Harvard economist and presi
dent of the National Bureau of Eco
nomic Research, said overstated in

flation from the CPI has helped cause
the unprecedented explosion of So
cial Security benefits in the last dec
ade.
Feldstein said, "The Social Security
system is in serious financial trou
ble." He said 20 to 30 percent tax
rates are now projected for the long
term, in orderto meet changing pop
ulation distributions if benefits are
not decreased or revenues in
creased. He explained that those
who were granted the inflated in
creases will now receive them for life.
The CPI has been disregarded here
for two years, according to Warner.
Instead a much more comprehensive
system of cross-indexing is combined
with polls taken of top University
economists, officials in the San Fran
cisco Federal Reserve, and other pre
dicting groups to make economic
"forecasts."
Williams said, "I'd like to dispel any
belief that (the data for planning
budgets) is just pulled out of a news

paper.
She said the University's budgets
are determined by a "widely copied"
and very extensive model through
which "at least 100 runs (on the com
puter) are made every fall" to make
five-year financial forecasts. Williams
said she believes, "as a statistic, it the
CPI is good, but only as a measure of
prices." She cited overuse as the key
problem of the CPI.
