# Signs point to recession
## 
### Newsday 
New York — The signs that
the nation is slipping into
something more serious than a
brief and mild recession are
multiplying like the litigants in
the federal bankruptcy courts.
While Dun & Bradstreet re
ports that bankruptcies are
running 41 percent ahead of
last year, the theory that the
United States could get away
with a brief and relatively pain
less downturn is being shaken
daily.
Developments of signifi
cance include these:
—Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan is talking like a worried
man. "A tight money supply in
a downward economic cycle
could exacerbate the trouble
we're in," said Regan. His sug
gestion that the Federal Re
serve Board ease up in its poli
cies met with a rebuff from Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker.
—Manufacturing plants are
turning increasingly idle. The
capacity utilization rate in Au
gust was 79.2 percent, a drop of
0.6 percent.
—Initial claims for un
employment benefits, which
are measured weekly and pro
vide an even more up-to-date

job picture than the monthly
unemployment statistics, are
exploding. Claims reached
512,000 in the week ending
Sept. 26. This is an increase of
100,000 from the level prevail
ing two months ago.
—Auto sales are collapsing.
The Commerce Department
reported that total domestic
sales, which began September
at a 8.4-million annual rate, had
shrunk to only 5.6 million by
the end of the month.
This may be one recession
Wall Street welcomes.
Said Edward Yardeni, vice
president and chief economist
of E.F. Hutton, "The sharp sell
offs in the stock and bond mar
kets during July and August
suggested that investors also
saw no easy way out of the cur
rent dilemma of tight-money
policies and large federal defi
cits.
"But don't despair. Recent
data shows the economy is slip
ping into a recession. If so, a
liquidity crisis and a surge in
short-term interest rates
should be averted. Moreover,
a decline in interest rates sud
denly appears much more like
ly."
But even if a recession gets

Wall Street off President
Ronald Reagan's back, a
deeper-than-expected re
cession at this point could
cause some critical problems
for Reagan next year.
For another thing, the effects
of a recession tend to wear off
very slowly. Even if economic
activity has entered the re
covery stage by next spring or
summer, the high unemploy
ment rates that are likely to ac
company the recession should
persist well into the fall when
Reagan will be trying to elect a
new crop of Republicans to
Congress.
The president is in a tight
spot now because he is com
mitted not to take the kind of
stimulative measures that
would hasten the recovery
from a recession.
"I would hope," said Nor
man Ture, the undersecretary
of the Treasury for tax and eco
nomic affairs, "that we would
ride it out. I would certainly
hope that nobody in the ad
ministration hopes that there is
anything we could do about it.
The things that people have
tried to do in the past to try to
stop recessions have been
counterproductive."
