### Washington Post 
Ventress, La. — Felman Battley, 3 soft
spoken black man, has scratched out a liv
ing picking cotton and pecans for most of
his 59 years in Pointe Coupee parish, fat
tening pigs and raising vegetables out back
to supplement what the family buys on
credit at the grocery store up the road.
Most years, he was lucky to make $2500.
Soon, Battley expects to pay cash for a
new Ford, build "a nice comfortable
home," give his daughter, Felicia, enough
money so she won't have to work her way
through college at Louisiana State Univer
sity, and travel first class to Europe with his
wife, Ide. Two of Battley's sisters are
itching to go to Las Vegas.
"We have an oil well in the back yard,"
Battley said with a grin.
Any day now, the mail carrier will deliver
the family's first royalty check from an oil
and natural gas well pumping furiously on
the Battley property at the rate of 5.5 mil
lion cubic feet of gas and 288 barrels of oil a
day. The family's take — to be divided
equally among Battley, his 87-year-old
mother, Celestine, and nine brothers and
sisters — comes to $20,000 a month.
"When I picked pecans and cotton, I was
just getting by; wasn't enough to say noth
ing about," reflected Battley. From his
mother's porch, he gazes off toward the
gleaming oil and gas rig hissing in the cow
pasture. His sharecropper father Alex
bought the 34 acres with the proceeds
from an onion crop in 1946. "Now," he
said, "it looks like we're going to be rich."
The Battley well, and others like it, prom
ise to bring enormous wealth to hundreds
of poor blacks and blue-collar Cajuns in
this moss-hung parish of live oak and sugar
cane plantations, parking a former under
class in high cotton and forever altering
the course of this Deep South community
along the False River.
Their sudden good fortune amidst this
county of 23,000 where one out of four
people gets food stamps comes from the
hottest spot in oil-rich Louisiana's
Tuscaloosa Trend, a deep pocket of oil and
natural gas that cuts a swath 20 miles wide
across the backwoods and alligator
bayous.
The first deep drilling rig hit gas on a
cane plantation here in 1975. Since then,
the cost of leasing a single acre has sky
rocketed from $50 to as much as $40,000.
Geologists project some 35 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas reserves worth upward
of $250 billion in the Tuscaloosa. The abun
dant pockets of natural gas attracted
oilmen after prices were deregulated for
gas found below 15,000 feet, where the
rich strikes are,,; feeing made in Pointe
Coupee.
At $9 per 1000 cubic feet, such gas will
mean higher heating bills for the energy
starved Northeast this winter and huge
profits for oil giants who risk as much as $10

million to sink a well.
Beneath the willows in small towns like
Ventress and New Roads that dot the False
River, the gas money has started working a
slow transformation, clogging traffic with
18-wheelers weighted down under rigging
and drill bits. Pharmacist Bubba Porciau
aims to stop counting out prescriptions
and start raising quarterhorses. Others
have bought new cars and remodeled old
homes.
"If everything pans out — the (25-year)
life expectancy of the gas fields, people's
ability to manage the money — there will
be more millionaires" per acre in Pointe
Coupee parish than any place its size in the
United States, predicted Calvin Thomas,
senior geologist with the Louisiana De
partment of Natural Resources in Baton
Rouge.
So far, the prosperity has been demo
cratic, making both rich and poor land
owners richer, State law and oil-patch cus
tom dictate that anyone with an acre or
two touching any 640-acre unit carved up
by state conservation officials foi drilling
gets to share in the spoils.
"It's touched rich and poor, black and
white — no one's been left out," said at
torney John Wayne Jewell, 38, of New
Roads. He has hit the lawbooks hard to
protect unsophisticated landowners from
savvy oilmen who, by all accounts, have
snapped up more than a few mineral leases
at bargain prices.

Most natives are still living on the edge of their
Americ an dream. One man left a royalty check for
$150,000 on his dresser for days before asking the local
banker what to do with it. Others don't trust banks.
Among those are Cajuns who cashed their checks,
plopped the money into safety deposit boxes and
went rabbit hunting.

Anna Battley Cador, 65, leased her land
to Chevron in 1973 for $15 an acre and one
sixth royalty, she says, a pittance at today's
prices. She never consulted a lawyer. "Our
mistake," site conceded now. Still, Cador
and her husband, Joseph, a retiied con
struction worker, stand to earn hundreds
of thousands of dollars from a well near
their tidy brick home and their share of the
Battley well.
But tradition dies hard in the Deep
Soyth, especially for once-poor folks set in
their ways. The Cadors still plant turnips
and sweet potatoes out back "just the way
our parents taught us," she said. "It's hard
to shake loose and be extravagant, even
though you know you can buy anything

you want."
While lace relations have been slow to
evolve from plantation days here, some
blacks newly rich report a recent thaw.
"Now, white people look up to you if
you're prospering," said Anna Cador.
"Sales people treat you differently."

The parish, half black, half white, in
cludes thousands who will miss out be

said Overstreet, a retired maid. She lives
on $167 a month Social Security, renting a
drafty wood shack for $25 a month. Behind

her house, a gas well rises like the Empire
State Building from a sugar cane field. "If
they had land to sell, I didn't have money
to buy it."
She has read all about the Battleys in
Ebony magazine, even tuned them in on
her black-and-white TV on "That's In

their good luck nor envies them the re
porters who descend on their yard to ask
the same question: "How does it feel to be
suddenly rich?"
"It feels very, very good," said Dorseline
Battley Nelson, 44, whose husband cuts
hair and works as a janitor. "I'm looking
forward to my new life. I don't ever want to
go back to picking pecans and cotton."

his 59 years in Pointe Coupee parish, fat
tening pigs and raising vegetables out back
to supplement what the family buys on
credit at the grocery store up the road.
Most years, he was lucky to make $2500.
Soon, Battley expects to pay cash for a
new Ford, build "a nice comfortable
home," give his daughter, Felicia, enough
money so she won't have to work her way
through college at Louisiana State Univer
sity, and travel first class to Europe with his
wife, Ide. Two of Battley's sisters are
itching to go to Las Vegas.
"We have an oil well in the back yard,"
Battley said with a grin.
Any day now, the mail carrier will deliver
the family's first royalty check from an oil
and natural gas well pumping furiously on
the Battley property at the rate of 5.5 mil
lion cubic feet of gas and 288 barrels of oil a
day. The family's take — to be divided
equally among Battley, his 87-year-old
mother, Celestine, and nine brothers and
sisters — comes to $20,000 a month.
"When I picked pecans and cotton, I was
just getting by; wasn't enough to say noth
ing about," reflected Battley. From his
mother's porch, he gazes off toward the
gleaming oil and gas rig hissing in the cow
pasture. His sharecropper father Alex
bought the 34 acres with the proceeds
from an onion crop in 1946. "Now," he
said, "it looks like we're going to be rich."
The Battley well, and others like it, prom
ise to bring enormous wealth to hundreds
of poor blacks and blue-collar Cajuns in
this moss-hung parish of live oak and sugar
cane plantations, parking a former under
class in high cotton and forever altering
the course of this Deep South community
along the False River.
Their sudden good fortune amidst this
county of 23,000 where one out of four
people gets food stamps comes from the
hottest spot in oil-rich Louisiana's
Tuscaloosa Trend, a deep pocket of oil and
natural gas that cuts a swath 20 miles wide
across the backwoods and alligator
bayous.
The first deep drilling rig hit gas on a
cane plantation here in 1975. Since then,
the cost of leasing a single acre has sky
rocketed from $50 to as much as $40,000.
Geologists project some 35 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas reserves worth upward
of $250 billion in the Tuscaloosa. The abun
dant pockets of natural gas attracted
oilmen after prices were deregulated for
gas found below 15,000 feet, where the
rich strikes are,,; feeing made in Pointe
Coupee.
At $9 per 1000 cubic feet, such gas will
mean higher heating bills for the energy
starved Northeast this winter and huge
profits for oil giants who risk as much as $10

million to sink a well.
Beneath the willows in small towns like
Ventress and New Roads that dot the False
River, the gas money has started working a
slow transformation, clogging traffic with
18-wheelers weighted down under rigging
and drill bits. Pharmacist Bubba Porciau
aims to stop counting out prescriptions
and start raising quarterhorses. Others
have bought new cars and remodeled old
homes.
"If everything pans out — the (25-year)
life expectancy of the gas fields, people's
ability to manage the money — there will
be more millionaires" per acre in Pointe
Coupee parish than any place its size in the
United States, predicted Calvin Thomas,
senior geologist with the Louisiana De
partment of Natural Resources in Baton
Rouge.
So far, the prosperity has been demo
cratic, making both rich and poor land
owners richer, State law and oil-patch cus
tom dictate that anyone with an acre or
two touching any 640-acre unit carved up
by state conservation officials foi drilling
gets to share in the spoils.
"It's touched rich and poor, black and
white — no one's been left out," said at
torney John Wayne Jewell, 38, of New
Roads. He has hit the lawbooks hard to
protect unsophisticated landowners from
savvy oilmen who, by all accounts, have
snapped up more than a few mineral leases
at bargain prices.

Most natives are still living on the edge of their
Americ an dream. One man left a royalty check for
$150,000 on his dresser for days before asking the local
banker what to do with it. Others don't trust banks.
Among those are Cajuns who cashed their checks,
plopped the money into safety deposit boxes and
went rabbit hunting.

Anna Battley Cador, 65, leased her land
to Chevron in 1973 for $15 an acre and one
sixth royalty, she says, a pittance at today's
prices. She never consulted a lawyer. "Our
mistake," site conceded now. Still, Cador
and her husband, Joseph, a retiied con
struction worker, stand to earn hundreds
of thousands of dollars from a well near
their tidy brick home and their share of the
Battley well.
But tradition dies hard in the Deep
Soyth, especially for once-poor folks set in
their ways. The Cadors still plant turnips
and sweet potatoes out back "just the way
our parents taught us," she said. "It's hard
to shake loose and be extravagant, even
though you know you can buy anything

you want."
While lace relations have been slow to
evolve from plantation days here, some
blacks newly rich report a recent thaw.
"Now, white people look up to you if
you're prospering," said Anna Cador.
"Sales people treat you differently."

Most years, he was lucky to make $2500.
Soon, Battley expects to pay cash for a
new Ford, build "a nice comfortable
home," give his daughter, Felicia, enough
money so she won't have to work her way
through college at Louisiana State Univer
sity, and travel first class to Europe with his
wife, Ide. Two of Battley's sisters are
itching to go to Las Vegas.
"We have an oil well in the back yard,"
Battley said with a grin.
Any day now, the mail carrier will deliver
the family's first royalty check from an oil
and natural gas well pumping furiously on
the Battley property at the rate of 5.5 mil
lion cubic feet of gas and 288 barrels of oil a
day. The family's take — to be divided
equally among Battley, his 87-year-old
mother, Celestine, and nine brothers and
sisters — comes to $20,000 a month.
"When I picked pecans and cotton, I was
just getting by; wasn't enough to say noth
ing about," reflected Battley. From his
mother's porch, he gazes off toward the
gleaming oil and gas rig hissing in the cow
pasture. His sharecropper father Alex
bought the 34 acres with the proceeds
from an onion crop in 1946. "Now," he
said, "it looks like we're going to be rich."
The Battley well, and others like it, prom
ise to bring enormous wealth to hundreds
of poor blacks and blue-collar Cajuns in
this moss-hung parish of live oak and sugar
cane plantations, parking a former under
class in high cotton and forever altering
the course of this Deep South community
along the False River.
Their sudden good fortune amidst this
county of 23,000 where one out of four
people gets food stamps comes from the
hottest spot in oil-rich Louisiana's
Tuscaloosa Trend, a deep pocket of oil and
natural gas that cuts a swath 20 miles wide
across the backwoods and alligator
bayous.
The first deep drilling rig hit gas on a
cane plantation here in 1975. Since then,
the cost of leasing a single acre has sky
rocketed from $50 to as much as $40,000.
Geologists project some 35 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas reserves worth upward
of $250 billion in the Tuscaloosa. The abun
dant pockets of natural gas attracted
oilmen after prices were deregulated for
gas found below 15,000 feet, where the
rich strikes are,,; feeing made in Pointe
Coupee.
At $9 per 1000 cubic feet, such gas will
mean higher heating bills for the energy
starved Northeast this winter and huge
profits for oil giants who risk as much as $10

million to sink a well.
Beneath the willows in small towns like
Ventress and New Roads that dot the False
River, the gas money has started working a
slow transformation, clogging traffic with
18-wheelers weighted down under rigging
and drill bits. Pharmacist Bubba Porciau
aims to stop counting out prescriptions
and start raising quarterhorses. Others
have bought new cars and remodeled old
homes.
"If everything pans out — the (25-year)
life expectancy of the gas fields, people's
ability to manage the money — there will
be more millionaires" per acre in Pointe
Coupee parish than any place its size in the
United States, predicted Calvin Thomas,
senior geologist with the Louisiana De
partment of Natural Resources in Baton
Rouge.
So far, the prosperity has been demo
cratic, making both rich and poor land
owners richer, State law and oil-patch cus
tom dictate that anyone with an acre or
two touching any 640-acre unit carved up
by state conservation officials foi drilling
gets to share in the spoils.
"It's touched rich and poor, black and
white — no one's been left out," said at
torney John Wayne Jewell, 38, of New
Roads. He has hit the lawbooks hard to
protect unsophisticated landowners from
savvy oilmen who, by all accounts, have
snapped up more than a few mineral leases
at bargain prices.

Most natives are still living on the edge of their
Americ an dream. One man left a royalty check for
$150,000 on his dresser for days before asking the local
banker what to do with it. Others don't trust banks.
Among those are Cajuns who cashed their checks,
plopped the money into safety deposit boxes and
went rabbit hunting.

Anna Battley Cador, 65, leased her land
to Chevron in 1973 for $15 an acre and one
sixth royalty, she says, a pittance at today's
prices. She never consulted a lawyer. "Our
mistake," site conceded now. Still, Cador
and her husband, Joseph, a retiied con
struction worker, stand to earn hundreds
of thousands of dollars from a well near
their tidy brick home and their share of the
Battley well.
But tradition dies hard in the Deep
Soyth, especially for once-poor folks set in
their ways. The Cadors still plant turnips
and sweet potatoes out back "just the way
our parents taught us," she said. "It's hard
to shake loose and be extravagant, even
though you know you can buy anything

you want."
While lace relations have been slow to
evolve from plantation days here, some
blacks newly rich report a recent thaw.
"Now, white people look up to you if
you're prospering," said Anna Cador.
"Sales people treat you differently."

the same question: "How does it feel to be

"It feels very, very good," said Dorseline
Battley Nelson, 44, whose husband cuts
hair and works as a janitor. "I'm looking
forward to my new life. I don't ever want to
go back to picking pecans and cotton."
Ventress, La. — Felman Battley, 3 soft
spoken black man, has scratched out a liv
ing picking cotton and pecans for most of
his 59 years in Pointe Coupee parish, fat
tening pigs and raising vegetables out back
to supplement what the family buys on
credit at the grocery store up the road.
