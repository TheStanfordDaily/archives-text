## Consistency is the key Cardinal booters look to get back on track vs Santa Clara 
### Adam Berns 
"This could be our most
critical game so far this sea
son," said Stanford soccer
coach Nelson Lodge about to
night's match against Santa
Clara.
This reasoning is based on
the fact that there now seem to
be six teams fighting for only
three playoff spots in the
Western Region: Santa Clara,
the University of San Francisco,
UCLA, San Diego, San Jose
State, and Stanford. Because
Stanford has already lost to
UCLA and San Jose, the Santa
Clara game is a must for the
Cardinals. Starting time for the
game 7:30 p.m., at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium.
Beating Santa Clara will by
no means be an easy task. The
team comes off an extremely
well played and very clear up
set of a strong San Diego team
that beat both USF and San Jose
State earlier this year.
Even though Lodge admitted
that most outsiders give Santa
Clara a slight edge, he feels that
the game will be even.
He watched the Santa Clara
victory over San Diego, and no
ticed that all of their scoring

came on set plays. One of the
keys tonight will be whether or
not the Cards can neutralize
this element in the game.
"In the games I've seen, they
never stop running/' said
Lodge. "They are big on de
fense so that you have to go
through them, not over them.
But most of all, they have an ex
ceptionally talented goal
keeper and a very textbook
style of play."
Another key in tonight's
game will be how well the
Cardinal defense can contain a
very potent Santa Clara of
fensive attack, spearheaded by
leading scorer Mike Hunter.
"We're going to have to de
fend Mike Hunter as well as
their center to have a chance to
win," Lodge said.
Fortunately, the Cardinal de
fense should be strenghtened
this week by the return of cen
ter stopper Doug Clark, who
had to sit out of the UCLA
game due to a severe charley
horse.
From an offensive stand
point, Stanford will have to im
prove from last Saturday's 3-0
loss to UCLA. Lodge said that
he feels the key will be more

support from the midfielders.
"We will have to be more of
a 1-2 touch team," he said. "We
need more midfield support.
Our attackers need support,
and will be more effective with
six to seven people downfield
rather than just three."
Stanford will also have to
vary its offense and be less pre
dictable if it hopes to defeat
Santa Clara. "In the UCLA
game most of our movement
was vertical," Lodgeexplained.
"We're going to have to add
more lateral movement to our
attack."
After Saturday's loss the
Cardinals will probably drop
from fourth place to eighth in
the Far Western rankings,
while Santa Clara will probably
rise to first or second place. Be
cause of the great balance in
the region, neither team can af
ford a loss tonight.
"If we lose to Santa Clara,
there is a strong indication that
we'll have no chance of getting
into the playoffs unless some
thing improbable happens,"
Lodge explained. "However if
we win, it puts us back into
playoff consideration.

win," Lodge said.
Fortunately, the Cardinal de
fense should be strenghtened
this week by the return of cen
ter stopper Doug Clark, who
had to sit out of the UCLA
game due to a severe charley
horse.
From an offensive stand
point, Stanford will have to im
prove from last Saturday's 3-0
loss to UCLA. Lodge said that
he feels the key will be more

support from the midfielders.
"We will have to be more of
a 1-2 touch team," he said. "We
need more midfield support.
Our attackers need support,
and will be more effective with
six to seven people downfield
rather than just three."
Stanford will also have to
vary its offense and be less pre
dictable if it hopes to defeat
Santa Clara. "In the UCLA
game most of our movement
was vertical," Lodgeexplained.
"We're going to have to add
more lateral movement to our
attack."
After Saturday's loss the
Cardinals will probably drop
from fourth place to eighth in
the Far Western rankings,
while Santa Clara will probably
rise to first or second place. Be
cause of the great balance in
the region, neither team can af
ford a loss tonight.
"If we lose to Santa Clara,
there is a strong indication that
we'll have no chance of getting
into the playoffs unless some
thing improbable happens,"
Lodge explained. "However if
we win, it puts us back into
playoff consideration.
