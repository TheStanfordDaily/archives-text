# Cardinal stickers tie University of Pacific

The Stanford Women's Field
Hockey team thought classes
were finished for the day when
they trotted onto Roble Field
yesterday afternoon. By the
time the match was over, the
University of Pacific team had
showed them differently,
handing the Cards a frustrating
2-2 tie.
"They taught us a lesson,"
said Stanford link Kathy Nich
olson, "that when we let up for
two seconds that's what can
happen."
What happened was the
Stanford team played three
quarters of the game in UOP
territory, yet could only come
up with two first half scores.
That should have been enough
to win.
Stanford opened the scoring
when Patsy Huntington fired a
shot past the UOP goalie, suc
cessfully concluding a sus
tained Cardinal attack early in
the game. UOP countered
strongly with a series of shots
on the home team's goal, but
were denied following a series
of equally valiant saves by Stan
ford defenders.
When play returned to the
Tiger side of the field, Stan

ford's fifth-man offense
proved successful as Nicholson
was there put in a rebound shot
off the goalie's pads, giving the
Cards a 2-0 lead.
But midway through the sec
ond half, the UOP team got
tired of playing defense and
decided to visit the Stanford
side of the field for a change.
Worn from the rigors of an un
successful assault on the UOP
goal, the Cardinal defense had
become momentarily vulner
able. The Tigers took im
mediate advantage of the Stan
ford letdown, scoring two
goals within a ten minute peri
od to shock the Cards into re
ality.
With just moments to play
UOP was penalized and Stan
ford got one more chance but
failed.
Huntington squared up with
the UOP goalie for the penalty
shot as the two teams waited
behind, leaving the outcome
to be decided by the two op
posing players.
The Cardinal forward swung
back and fired the shot.
"I put the ball right where I
wanted it," said Huntington
later. "She just made a good
save."
