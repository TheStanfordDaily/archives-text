# Yanks, Dodgers take first games

New York (AP) — Graig Net
tles, a batting flop in the East
Division playoffs, hammered a
three-run double with two out
in the first inning and the New
York Yankees went on to de
feat the Oakland A's 3-1 last
night in the opening game of
the American League Cham
pionship Series.
Veteran left-hander Tommy
John, his sinker pitch working
to perfection, scattered six hits
in six innings and was nicked
for a run in the fifth on Dwayne
Murphy's RBI grounder.
Ron Davis and Rich Gossage,
New York's bullpen aces, held
Oakland hitless over the final
three innings.
Nettles, held to one single in
17 at-bats as the Yankees edged
the Milwaukee Brewers three
games to two in the East
playoffs, laced his bases

loaded double to left-center
on an 0-2 pitch from Mike Nor
ris. The Oakland ace blanked
the Yankees on four more hits
after that — one pitch too late
— until he was relieved by Tom
Underwood with one out in
the eighth.
The game was uneventful for
the most part, although the
crowd of 55,740 was expecting
fireworks with Oakland Man
ager Billy Martin going against
the club he managed during
two turmoil-filled terms.
In the Oakland eighth, after
Murphy drew a one-out walk,
Cliff Johnson stepped out of
the batter's box several times
after falling behind on the
count, 1-2. Davis, obviously up
set by the tactics, walked John
son after jawing with plate um
pire Nick Bremigan.
Gossage, who saved all three

victories against Milwaukee,
took over at that point and re
tired Tony Armas and pinch
hitter Wayne Gross on groun
ders to second base.
Norris started out well
enough, striking out Jerry
Mumphrey, New York's first
batter. But Larry Milbourne,
who has seven hits in his last
nine postseason at-bats, sin
gled to right and Dave Winfield
walked.
Norris fell behind Reggie
Jackson 2-0 and Martin went to
the mound for a brief chat.
Jackson eventually grounded
into a forceout. But, after Jack
son stole second without a
throw, Norris walked Oscar
Gamble on a 3-2 pitch, loading
the bases.
Nettles cleared them, driving
Norris' 0-2 delivery up the alley
in left-center. Milbourne and
Jackson scored easily and
Gamble barreled across the
plate with a head-first dive,
preventing catcher Jeff New
man from handling the relay
throw. Bob Watson then
crushed a towering drive to
left-center, a home run in any
other ball park, but center
fielder Murphy ran it down in
Yankee Stadium's spacious
Death Valley.
After the first inning, the
Yankees did not get another
runner beyond first until the
seventh. In the New York
eighth, Milbourne led off with
a single, his third hit, and one
out later, Underwood replaced
Norris. He walked Jackson and
pinch-hitter Lou Piniella sin
gled, but Armas, Oakland's ri
fle-armed right fielder, threw
Milbourne out at the plate. The
Yankees argued the play, and
Milbourne appeared to be safe
on a television replay.

Los Angeles (AP) — Ron Cey,
who hadn't swung at bat in a
game in more than a month,
lined a run-scoring double,
and Pedro Guerrero and Mike
Scioscia hit consecutive
eighth-inning home runs yes
terday to back Burt Hooton
and the Los Angeles Dodgers
to a 5-1 victory over the Mont
real Expos in the first game of
their National League Cham

pionship series.
Both eighth-inning homers
came after two were out. Cey
started the uprising with a sin
gle to center and Guerrero fol
lowed with his homer to left off
reliever Jeff Reardon who re
placed starter Bill Gullickson.
Scioscia then belted his shot to
right-center.
t The second inning double
was Cey's first hit since he sus
tained a broken bone in his left
forearm when he was hit by a
pitch from San Francisco's Tom
Griffin on Sept. 8. On Monday,
Dodgers' Manager Tom
Lasorda announced that his
third baseman was fit for duty.
Cey responded with a double
that started a two-run burst,
continuing a four-year Dodger
Stadium jinx for the Expos.
The Expos have won just
twice in their last 20 ap
pearances at Dodger Stadium;
a lack of timely hitting yester
day spoiled the Expos' first
League Championship outing.
They were shut out until the
ninth inning when they scored
their lone run on doubles by
Gary Carter and Larry Parrish.
That was only the fourth run off
Dodgers pitching in the last 51
innings. Steve Howe replaced
reliever Bob Welch at that
point,and gaveuponlyasingle
to Warren Cromartie before
the game ended on the
Dodgers' fourth double play.
Steve Garvey started the
Dodger second with sharply hit
ground single to left. Montreal
right-hander Bill Gullickson
worked the count to 3-2 on Cey
before the man they call "Pen
quin" slapped the ball into the
corner in right to score Garvey.
Hooton allowed six hits
before he was relieved in the
eighth inning by Welch. A key
to Hooton's success had been
his ability to keep the fleet
rookie Tim Raines off base, but
when Raines singled with one
out in the eighth, Lasorda went
to Welch.
Welch struck out the first
man he faced — Scott, and
Dodgers' left fielder Dusty
Baker made a diving grab of a
long fly ball in the gap on a
drive by Dawson.

Los Angeles (AP) — Ron Cey,
who hadn't swung at bat in a
game in more than a month,
lined a run-scoring double,
and Pedro Guerrero and Mike
Scioscia hit consecutive
eighth-inning home runs yes
terday to back Burt Hooton
and the Los Angeles Dodgers
to a 5-1 victory over the Mont
real Expos in the first game of
their National League Cham

pionship series.
Both eighth-inning homers
came after two were out. Cey
started the uprising with a sin
gle to center and Guerrero fol
lowed with his homer to left off
reliever Jeff Reardon who re
placed starter Bill Gullickson.
Scioscia then belted his shot to
right-center.
t The second inning double
was Cey's first hit since he sus
tained a broken bone in his left
forearm when he was hit by a
pitch from San Francisco's Tom
Griffin on Sept. 8. On Monday,
Dodgers' Manager Tom
Lasorda announced that his
third baseman was fit for duty.
Cey responded with a double
that started a two-run burst,
continuing a four-year Dodger
Stadium jinx for the Expos.
The Expos have won just
twice in their last 20 ap
pearances at Dodger Stadium;
a lack of timely hitting yester
day spoiled the Expos' first
League Championship outing.
They were shut out until the
ninth inning when they scored
their lone run on doubles by
Gary Carter and Larry Parrish.
That was only the fourth run off
Dodgers pitching in the last 51
innings. Steve Howe replaced
reliever Bob Welch at that
point,and gaveuponlyasingle
to Warren Cromartie before
the game ended on the
Dodgers' fourth double play.
Steve Garvey started the
Dodger second with sharply hit
ground single to left. Montreal
right-hander Bill Gullickson
worked the count to 3-2 on Cey
before the man they call "Pen
quin" slapped the ball into the
corner in right to score Garvey.
Hooton allowed six hits
before he was relieved in the
eighth inning by Welch. A key
to Hooton's success had been
his ability to keep the fleet
rookie Tim Raines off base, but
when Raines singled with one
out in the eighth, Lasorda went
to Welch.
Welch struck out the first
man he faced — Scott, and
Dodgers' left fielder Dusty
Baker made a diving grab of a
long fly ball in the gap on a
drive by Dawson.
New York (AP) — Graig Net
tles, a batting flop in the East
Division playoffs, hammered a
three-run double with two out
in the first inning and the New
York Yankees went on to de
feat the Oakland A's 3-1 last
night in the opening game of
the American League Cham
pionship Series.
Veteran left-hander Tommy
John, his sinker pitch working
to perfection, scattered six hits
in six innings and was nicked
for a run in the fifth on Dwayne
Murphy's RBI grounder.
Ron Davis and Rich Gossage,
New York's bullpen aces, held
Oakland hitless over the final
three innings.
Nettles, held to one single in
17 at-bats as the Yankees edged
the Milwaukee Brewers three
games to two in the East
playoffs, laced his bases

loaded double to left-center
on an 0-2 pitch from Mike Nor
ris. The Oakland ace blanked
the Yankees on four more hits
after that — one pitch too late
— until he was relieved by Tom
Underwood with one out in
the eighth.
The game was uneventful for
the most part, although the
crowd of 55,740 was expecting
fireworks with Oakland Man
ager Billy Martin going against
the club he managed during
two turmoil-filled terms.
In the Oakland eighth, after
Murphy drew a one-out walk,
Cliff Johnson stepped out of
the batter's box several times
after falling behind on the
count, 1-2. Davis, obviously up
set by the tactics, walked John
son after jawing with plate um
pire Nick Bremigan.
Gossage, who saved all three

victories against Milwaukee,
took over at that point and re
tired Tony Armas and pinch
hitter Wayne Gross on groun
ders to second base.
Norris started out well
enough, striking out Jerry
Mumphrey, New York's first
batter. But Larry Milbourne,
who has seven hits in his last
nine postseason at-bats, sin
gled to right and Dave Winfield
walked.
Norris fell behind Reggie
Jackson 2-0 and Martin went to
the mound for a brief chat.
Jackson eventually grounded
into a forceout. But, after Jack
son stole second without a
throw, Norris walked Oscar
Gamble on a 3-2 pitch, loading
the bases.
Nettles cleared them, driving
Norris' 0-2 delivery up the alley
in left-center. Milbourne and
Jackson scored easily and
Gamble barreled across the
plate with a head-first dive,
preventing catcher Jeff New

throw. Bob Watson then
