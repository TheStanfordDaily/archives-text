Austin, Texas (AP) â€” Texas,
leapfrogging into the No.l spot
in college football with a 20-
point victory over Oklahoma,
now faces an even more impor
tant game, said Coach Fred
Akers.
Texas defeated Oklahoma
34-14 in a nationally televised
game at Dallas on Saturday and
next travels to Fayetteville,
Ark., for a regionally televised
Southwest Conference contest
with Arkansas.
Akers said theOklahoma vic
tory was "fun, great the way it
turned out for us" and impor
tant nationally, "but it's not as
important as the Arkansas
game. It's a conference game,
and Arkansas is a quality foot
ball team."
"Arkansas is as talented as

anyone we're going to see,"
said Akers, a former Arkansas
quarterback.
Asked if he preferred being
No.l or N0.2 going into the Ar
kansas game, Akers replied,
"Not since there's nothing I
can do about it, no."
He noted, however, "The
choices are getting more lim
ited as we go along."
Texas, with the help of a loss
by top-ranked Southern Cali
fornia, moved up from the
from N0.3 spot Monday, leav
ing Penn State N0.2 in The As
sociated Press poll.
"Nothing I say or do will
make us No.l or N0.2," Akers
said of the rankings. "They (op
ponents) shoot at us, regard
less, and that's why it doesn't
bother us to be ranked high."

Texas received 35 first place
votes for 1274 points to 24 first
place ballots and 1262 points
for Penn State in voting by a na
tionwide panel of 66 sports
writers and sportscasters. Pit
tsburgh was third with three
first place ballots and 1192
points, followed by North Car
olina (4) and 1126, Michigan,
Clemson, Southern Cal, Mis
souri, Georgia and SMU.
The Second Ten consists of
Florida State, lowa, Miami of
Florida, Wisconsin, Alabama,
Mississippi State, Brigham
Young, Washington State, Ne
braska and Arizona State.
The loss to Texas dropped
Oklahoma, which was 10th last
week, out of the Top Twenty
for the first time since Nov. 25,
1970. The Sooners had been in
the rankings for 147 con

secutive weeks during the reg
ular season, two shy of Michi
gan's all-time mark of 149
weeks, which ended on Sept.
23,1980.
Texas is the fourth team this
season to hold the No.l spot in
the AP poll. Michigan, the pre
season and first-week leader,
gave way to Notre Dame for
one week, before Southern Cal
pushed them off the top rung.
Asked if he was worried
about a letdown after the emo
tional victory over the Sooners,
Akers said, "You have to be
concerned with something like
that."
But he said if "you stop and
analyze the importance" of the
Arkansas game, "I wouldn't
think we'll have much trouble
getting their (the players') at
tention."
