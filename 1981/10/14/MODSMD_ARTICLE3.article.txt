# University pays student $140,000
## Injury brings settlement 
### Bill Ainsworth 
A student who charged the Uni
versity with negligence, after an acci
dent he suffered two years ago when
his hand went through a plate glass
door of a residence hall, was recently
awarded a $140,000 cash settlement
out of court.
Two weeks ago the University,
while admitting no negligence on its
part, awarded junior Bill Buchanan
that sum as well as the equivalent cost
of four years at Stanford just before
Buchanan's lawsuit was scheduled to
begin trial, according to University
attorney Rodney Johnson.
As a result of the lawsuit Johnson
said that the people involved in the
case, including representatives from
the maintenance shop, residence
hall's administration, the law office
and the safety office are going to
meet sometime this week to re-eval
uate the University's policy on the
safety of glass doors.
This meeting would not have the
power to make any changes involv
ing a substantial increase in expen
ditures, according to Johnson, who
said, "whether or not there is a spe
cific change at this meeting, at least
we're trying to look at the whole pic
ture."
Replacement cost
However, Director of Housing and
Food Services Ed Scoles said he does
not envision replacing all the remain
ing plate glass doors and adjacent
windows with safety glass because of
the estimated replacement cost of $1
million.
"There are so many other pressing
needs in residence halls. It would run
into millions of dollars to replace all
the remaining plate glass... If I had
ten million dollars I might do it,"
Scoles said.
Scoles said that 99 percent of the
glass in the residence halls is plate
glass because building codes in the
'60s required it. In many cases, Scoles
\Sfid the plate glass has a panic bar or a
fixed barasa handhold to prevent ac
cidents. Scoles refused to comment
about the Buchanan case specifically.
Housing Facilities Manager Terry
McGovern said state law does not re
quire retrofitting existing plate glass
doors, which were required by pre
vious building codes, with safety
glass. Here, McGovern said, the
current policy is to replace existing
plate glass in windows with safety
glass when the glass is broken.
A similar policy of replacement by
attrition is being followed in the resi
dence halls of UC-Berkeley, said ad
ministrator Robert Jacobs. But ac
cording to Will Lamar, a maintenance
official at Berkeley, all the main en

trance glass doors and adjacent areas
have been replaced within the last
few years so that they all contain safe
ty glass.
Palo Alto assistant building official
Fred Cullum said the reason for the
state-mandated change from plate to
safety glass was the increased safety
offered by safety glass.
"There are a tremendous number
of fatalities from standard plates ev
ery year,"said Cullum.
Glass injuries
Safety glass greatly reduces the risk
of injury resulting from shattered
glass because when it is shattered, ac
cording to Cullum, it goes into small
granules that have round edges.
"With safety glasses you don't get the
sharp edges or the large pieces of
glass that you get with plate glass."
Buchanan's accident, which has
raised questions about the Univer
sity's glass policy, took place in No
vember 1979 at Soto House in Wilbur
hall following a water fight. Accord
ing to Johnson, when Buchanan
started running away from the per
son he had just doused with water
and he put his left hand on the bar to
the door, it slipped off the bar and
went through the window, cutting a
median nerve and a radial artery.
The injury resulted in a major
blood loss, several weeks of hospi
talization and continued pain. It also
restricted Buchanan's ability to move
two fingers and a thumb independ
ently of one another and it left his left
hand without much strength, Bu
chanan told the Daily before the re
cent settlement which now prohibits
him from discussing the case.
In the lawsuit Buchanan con
tended that the University was neg
ligent in maintaining the safety bar
and that the bar was loose at the time
of the accident.
"Part of the reason I went to the
lawsuit was to prevent further acci
dents from happening," Buchanan
said.
No discussion
Included in the terms of the settle
ment is a clause which does not allow
the plaintiff or his attorney to discuss
the settlement with the press or to
seek publicity. Instead, all questions
concerning the case must be
directed to Johnson.
"Apparently Stanford does not
want publicity," said Buchanan's law
yer Jan Champion of the Boccardo
law firm. Champion said that a no
discusion clause is "not unheard of,
but not routine."
Johnson said the reason for the no
discussion clause, which according
to Champion was something Stan
ford wanted in the settlement, was

the University's concern with the
Boccardo firm's reputation for publi
cizing its cases.
There were two reasons for the set
tlement of the lawsuit, Johnson said.
The first was that the University did
not want Buchanan to have to go
through the trial and exacerbate any
psychological problems connected
with the injury.
"We felt it would be good for Bill
himself to get back into school,"
johnson said.
Settlement unsure
The second reason for the settle
ment, according to Johnson, was the
uncertainty of the value of income
that the jury may feel Buchanan
could lose as a result of the injury.
"There was a real factor of uncertain
ty. There's a possibility that the jury
would want to reward him a lot.
There's always the uncertainty that
the jury could decide against you,"
Johnson said.
Injury risk
Although dozens of glass windows
are broken every year at the resi
dence halls, only a few result in in
juries, said Scoles. "Presumably lac
erations in safety glass would be less
severe. But any kind of glass involves
a certain risk," he said.
Johnson said that since Buchanan's
accident there have been no major
accidents involving glass.
It was another accident, this one at
a summer conference, that
prompted the University to look into
the area of glass safety in the early
'70s. At that time the University at
tached bars on the doors for safety
even though there was no regulation
requiring such a practice.
"We began our policy of replacing
broken glass doors with safety glass
before the state law," Johnson said.
The University's practicesconcern
ing glass are good considering the
amount of glass breakage and the
(act that thete aren't many injuries
associated with these breakages, he
added.
"The University has a responsi
bility, and in this case it was meeting
all the standards. Bill ran through the
door. He's old enough to realize that
glass cuts," Johnson said.
Buchanan, however, denied run
ning through a glass door. "I was
basically opening the door when my
arm slipped through the door," he
said.
Johnson said that part of dorm
education is holding students re
sponsible for their own actions. "I
think it's the University's responsi
bility to keep horseplay down to a
minimum," he said.

hall following a water fight. Accord
ing to Johnson, when Buchanan
started running away from the per
son he had just doused with water
and he put his left hand on the bar to
the door, it slipped off the bar and
went through the window, cutting a
median nerve and a radial artery.
The injury resulted in a major
blood loss, several weeks of hospi
talization and continued pain. It also
restricted Buchanan's ability to move
two fingers and a thumb independ
ently of one another and it left his left
hand without much strength, Bu
chanan told the Daily before the re
cent settlement which now prohibits
him from discussing the case.
In the lawsuit Buchanan con
tended that the University was neg
ligent in maintaining the safety bar
and that the bar was loose at the time
of the accident.
"Part of the reason I went to the
lawsuit was to prevent further acci
dents from happening," Buchanan
said.
No discussion
Included in the terms of the settle
ment is a clause which does not allow
the plaintiff or his attorney to discuss
the settlement with the press or to
seek publicity. Instead, all questions
concerning the case must be
directed to Johnson.
"Apparently Stanford does not
want publicity," said Buchanan's law
yer Jan Champion of the Boccardo
law firm. Champion said that a no
discusion clause is "not unheard of,
but not routine."
Johnson said the reason for the no
discussion clause, which according
to Champion was something Stan
ford wanted in the settlement, was

the University's concern with the
Boccardo firm's reputation for publi
cizing its cases.
There were two reasons for the set
tlement of the lawsuit, Johnson said.
The first was that the University did
not want Buchanan to have to go
through the trial and exacerbate any
psychological problems connected
with the injury.
"We felt it would be good for Bill
himself to get back into school,"
johnson said.
Settlement unsure
The second reason for the settle
ment, according to Johnson, was the
uncertainty of the value of income
that the jury may feel Buchanan
could lose as a result of the injury.
"There was a real factor of uncertain
ty. There's a possibility that the jury
would want to reward him a lot.
There's always the uncertainty that
the jury could decide against you,"
Johnson said.
Injury risk
Although dozens of glass windows
are broken every year at the resi
dence halls, only a few result in in
juries, said Scoles. "Presumably lac
erations in safety glass would be less
severe. But any kind of glass involves
a certain risk," he said.
Johnson said that since Buchanan's
accident there have been no major
accidents involving glass.
It was another accident, this one at
a summer conference, that
prompted the University to look into
the area of glass safety in the early
'70s. At that time the University at
tached bars on the doors for safety
even though there was no regulation
requiring such a practice.
"We began our policy of replacing
broken glass doors with safety glass
before the state law," Johnson said.
The University's practicesconcern
ing glass are good considering the
amount of glass breakage and the
(act that thete aren't many injuries
associated with these breakages, he
added.
"The University has a responsi
bility, and in this case it was meeting
all the standards. Bill ran through the
door. He's old enough to realize that
glass cuts," Johnson said.
Buchanan, however, denied run
ning through a glass door. "I was
basically opening the door when my
arm slipped through the door," he
said.
Johnson said that part of dorm
education is holding students re
sponsible for their own actions. "I
think it's the University's responsi
bility to keep horseplay down to a
minimum," he said.
A student who charged the Uni
versity with negligence, after an acci
dent he suffered two years ago when
his hand went through a plate glass
door of a residence hall, was recently
awarded a $140,000 cash settlement
out of court.
Two weeks ago the University,
while admitting no negligence on its
part, awarded junior Bill Buchanan
that sum as well as the equivalent cost
of four years at Stanford just before
Buchanan's lawsuit was scheduled to
begin trial, according to University
attorney Rodney Johnson.
As a result of the lawsuit Johnson
said that the people involved in the
case, including representatives from
the maintenance shop, residence
hall's administration, the law office
and the safety office are going to
meet sometime this week to re-eval
uate the University's policy on the
safety of glass doors.
This meeting would not have the
power to make any changes involv
ing a substantial increase in expen
ditures, according to Johnson, who
said, "whether or not there is a spe
cific change at this meeting, at least
we're trying to look at the whole pic
ture."
Replacement cost
However, Director of Housing and
Food Services Ed Scoles said he does
not envision replacing all the remain
ing plate glass doors and adjacent
windows with safety glass because of
the estimated replacement cost of $1
million.
"There are so many other pressing
needs in residence halls. It would run
into millions of dollars to replace all
the remaining plate glass... If I had
ten million dollars I might do it,"
Scoles said.
Scoles said that 99 percent of the
glass in the residence halls is plate
glass because building codes in the
'60s required it. In many cases, Scoles
\Sfid the plate glass has a panic bar or a
fixed barasa handhold to prevent ac
cidents. Scoles refused to comment
about the Buchanan case specifically.
Housing Facilities Manager Terry
McGovern said state law does not re
quire retrofitting existing plate glass
doors, which were required by pre
vious building codes, with safety
glass. Here, McGovern said, the
current policy is to replace existing
plate glass in windows with safety
glass when the glass is broken.
A similar policy of replacement by
attrition is being followed in the resi
dence halls of UC-Berkeley, said ad
ministrator Robert Jacobs. But ac
cording to Will Lamar, a maintenance
official at Berkeley, all the main en

trance glass doors and adjacent areas
have been replaced within the last
few years so that they all contain safe
ty glass.
Palo Alto assistant building official
Fred Cullum said the reason for the
state-mandated change from plate to
safety glass was the increased safety
offered by safety glass.
"There are a tremendous number
of fatalities from standard plates ev
ery year,"said Cullum.
Glass injuries
Safety glass greatly reduces the risk
of injury resulting from shattered
glass because when it is shattered, ac
cording to Cullum, it goes into small
granules that have round edges.
"With safety glasses you don't get the
sharp edges or the large pieces of
glass that you get with plate glass."

"The University has a responsi
bility, and in this case it was meeting
all the standards. Bill ran through the
door. He's old enough to realize that
glass cuts," Johnson said.
Buchanan, however, denied run
ning through a glass door. "I was
basically opening the door when my
arm slipped through the door," he
said.
Johnson said that part of dorm
education is holding students re
sponsible for their own actions. "I
think it's the University's responsi
bility to keep horseplay down to a
minimum," he said.
A student who charged the Uni
versity with negligence, after an acci
dent he suffered two years ago when
his hand went through a plate glass
door of a residence hall, was recently
awarded a $140,000 cash settlement
out of court.
Two weeks ago the University,
while admitting no negligence on its
part, awarded junior Bill Buchanan
that sum as well as the equivalent cost
of four years at Stanford just before
Buchanan's lawsuit was scheduled to
begin trial, according to University
attorney Rodney Johnson.
As a result of the lawsuit Johnson
said that the people involved in the
case, including representatives from
the maintenance shop, residence
hall's administration, the law office
and the safety office are going to
meet sometime this week to re-eval
uate the University's policy on the
safety of glass doors.
This meeting would not have the
power to make any changes involv
ing a substantial increase in expen
ditures, according to Johnson, who
said, "whether or not there is a spe
cific change at this meeting, at least
we're trying to look at the whole pic
ture."
Replacement cost
However, Director of Housing and
Food Services Ed Scoles said he does
not envision replacing all the remain
ing plate glass doors and adjacent
windows with safety glass because of
the estimated replacement cost of $1
million.
"There are so many other pressing
needs in residence halls. It would run
into millions of dollars to replace all
the remaining plate glass... If I had
ten million dollars I might do it,"
Scoles said.
Scoles said that 99 percent of the
glass in the residence halls is plate
glass because building codes in the
'60s required it. In many cases, Scoles
\Sfid the plate glass has a panic bar or a
fixed barasa handhold to prevent ac
cidents. Scoles refused to comment
about the Buchanan case specifically.
Housing Facilities Manager Terry
McGovern said state law does not re
quire retrofitting existing plate glass
doors, which were required by pre
vious building codes, with safety
glass. Here, McGovern said, the
current policy is to replace existing
plate glass in windows with safety
glass when the glass is broken.
A similar policy of replacement by
attrition is being followed in the resi
dence halls of UC-Berkeley, said ad
ministrator Robert Jacobs. But ac
cording to Will Lamar, a maintenance
official at Berkeley, all the main en

trance glass doors and adjacent areas
have been replaced within the last
few years so that they all contain safe
ty glass.
Palo Alto assistant building official
Fred Cullum said the reason for the
state-mandated change from plate to
safety glass was the increased safety
offered by safety glass.
"There are a tremendous number
of fatalities from standard plates ev
ery year,"said Cullum.
Glass injuries
Safety glass greatly reduces the risk
of injury resulting from shattered
glass because when it is shattered, ac
cording to Cullum, it goes into small
granules that have round edges.
"With safety glasses you don't get the
sharp edges or the large pieces of
glass that you get with plate glass."
Buchanan's accident, which has
raised questions about the Univer
sity's glass policy, took place in No
vember 1979 at Soto House in Wilbur
hall following a water fight. Accord
ing to Johnson, when Buchanan
started running away from the per
son he had just doused with water
and he put his left hand on the bar to
the door, it slipped off the bar and
went through the window, cutting a
median nerve and a radial artery.
The injury resulted in a major
blood loss, several weeks of hospi
talization and continued pain. It also
restricted Buchanan's ability to move
two fingers and a thumb independ
ently of one another and it left his left
hand without much strength, Bu
chanan told the Daily before the re
cent settlement which now prohibits
him from discussing the case.
In the lawsuit Buchanan con
tended that the University was neg
ligent in maintaining the safety bar
and that the bar was loose at the time
of the accident.
"Part of the reason I went to the
lawsuit was to prevent further acci
dents from happening," Buchanan
said.
No discussion
Included in the terms of the settle
ment is a clause which does not allow
the plaintiff or his attorney to discuss
the settlement with the press or to
seek publicity. Instead, all questions
concerning the case must be
directed to Johnson.
"Apparently Stanford does not
want publicity," said Buchanan's law
yer Jan Champion of the Boccardo
law firm. Champion said that a no
discusion clause is "not unheard of,
but not routine."
Johnson said the reason for the no
discussion clause, which according
to Champion was something Stan
ford wanted in the settlement, was

the University's concern with the
Boccardo firm's reputation for publi
cizing its cases.
There were two reasons for the set
tlement of the lawsuit, Johnson said.
The first was that the University did
not want Buchanan to have to go
through the trial and exacerbate any
psychological problems connected
with the injury.
"We felt it would be good for Bill
himself to get back into school,"
johnson said.
Settlement unsure
The second reason for the settle
ment, according to Johnson, was the
uncertainty of the value of income
that the jury may feel Buchanan
could lose as a result of the injury.
"There was a real factor of uncertain
ty. There's a possibility that the jury
would want to reward him a lot.
There's always the uncertainty that
the jury could decide against you,"
Johnson said.
Injury risk
Although dozens of glass windows
are broken every year at the resi
dence halls, only a few result in in
juries, said Scoles. "Presumably lac
erations in safety glass would be less
severe. But any kind of glass involves
a certain risk," he said.
Johnson said that since Buchanan's
accident there have been no major
accidents involving glass.
It was another accident, this one at
a summer conference, that
prompted the University to look into
the area of glass safety in the early
'70s. At that time the University at
tached bars on the doors for safety
even though there was no regulation
requiring such a practice.
"We began our policy of replacing
broken glass doors with safety glass
before the state law," Johnson said.
The University's practicesconcern
ing glass are good considering the
amount of glass breakage and the
(act that thete aren't many injuries
associated with these breakages, he
added.
"The University has a responsi
bility, and in this case it was meeting
all the standards. Bill ran through the
door. He's old enough to realize that
glass cuts," Johnson said.
Buchanan, however, denied run
ning through a glass door. "I was
basically opening the door when my
arm slipped through the door," he
said.
Johnson said that part of dorm
education is holding students re
sponsible for their own actions. "I
think it's the University's responsi
bility to keep horseplay down to a
minimum," he said.
