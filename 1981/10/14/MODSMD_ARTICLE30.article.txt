# Andretti appeals Indy decision
## 
### 
Indianapolis (AP) — A ruling
that Bobby Unser did riot cheat
would have been easier to ac
cept than the one that ac
knowledged his guilt but al
tered the prescribed penalty,
said Mario Andretti, who is ap
pealing last week's reversal of
the Indianapolis 500.
A special United States Auto
Club (USAC) appeal board
fined Unser $40,000 for illegally
passing cars under the yellow
caution light, but the panel
voted 2-1 to overturn a one-lap)
penalty that earlier haa
dropped him to second place
behind Andretti.
The one-lap penalty was im
posed a day after the May 24
race, but the panel said it
should have been assessed at
the time of the infraction to
give Unser a chance to Pnake
up the lost lap.
"That's the part that really
turned me around," Andretti
said.
future behavior (by a driver in a
race) tough to control. That's
the danger of this precedent, I
can tell you that.
"How would you know how
far you can go, taking advan

tage of every situation, know
ing if you take advantage of it
and cross the finish line first,
the race will never be taken
away from you regardless of
what the rule book says if you
have a good enough counsel
working for you?"
Andretti said he decided to
appeal Unser's victory "be
cause I think I would have
much easier accepted a verdict
of 'no guilt' (on Unser's part)
than a verdict of tampering
with the penalty that violation
definitely carries."
Andretti's attorney, Forrest
Bowman, said the protest by
Andretti — sent to USAC over
the weekend — was based on
the contention that "the court
of appeals conducted the pro
cedure in violation of the
USAC rules book in that they
did not give adequate notice of
the hearing to all concerned
parties."
"We had a right to receive
notice of the proceedings,"
said Forrest. "The same notice
that Penske Cars Ltd. (Unser's
racing team) received or the
Indy 500 stewards received, in
order to participate in all of the
pre-trial procedures in time to

make objections to the con
stitution of the panel, to partic
ipate in pre-trial agreements
and prepare for the hearing."
Although the scheduled
hearing was well publicized
before it was convened in June,
Bowman said "the actual no
tice (to Andretti) was a tele
gram the morning the hearing
started."

Earlier Monday, the Indian
apolis Motor Speedway an
nounced a revised prize list
which would award $299,124 to
Unser and a second-place
prize of $128,974 to Andretti.
The Speedway said, how
ever, no money would be paid
until official word was received
from USAC that all appeal pro
cedures had been completed.
