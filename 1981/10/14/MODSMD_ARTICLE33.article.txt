Carter supports AW ACS sale
Washington — Former President Jimmy Carter,
joining President Ronald Reagan in his battle over
AWACS radar planes for Saudi Arabia, said the sale is
"a litmus test of America's reliability" and is needed
for peace in the Middle East.
"I think it's very important that once the president
makes a commitment of that kind to a valuable friend
like the Saudi Arabians that the Senate approve what
the president has proposed," Carter said Monday as
he arrived for a two-day stay in Washington — his first
extended trip back since he was president.
"A lot of foreign countries can't understand the in
tricacies of American law and they look upon a prom
ise by the president as being a commitment on the
part of our own nation," he added.
Meanwhile, former President Gerald Ford, who lost
the White House to Carter in 1976, said he also will
join Reagan's lobbying drive for the sale.
"I can assure you that if the Congress turns down
President Reagan on the AWACS deal, it will have a
devastating effect on our attempt to pursue the proc
ess of peace in the Middle East," Ford told reporters
Monday in Arizona.
In a letter to Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) that was made
public Monday, Carter said, "In many ways, this has
become a litmus test of America's reliability" and
added that "the beneficial influence of the moderate
Arab nations is a valuable resource which we should
nourish whenever it is practical to do so."
Supreme Court decision
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yester
day to decide some of the most contentious social is
sues in America, including busing, censorship by
school boards, and tax exemptions for private
schools.
The court ended a two-year hands-off policy on
school busing cases by agreeing to decide whether
voters can prevent state courts or local school boards
from imposing busing plans.
It said it will consider the authority of school boards
to remove what they consider objectionable books
from school libraries and classrooms.
And it accepted for review the question of whether
the government can revoke the tax-exempt status of
religious schools that practice racial discrimination.
In the busing cases, the justices will consider the
constitutionality of successful anti-busing initiatives
by voters in California and the state of Washington.
The court also agreed to enter a nationwide con
troversy over books. School officials across the coun
try are faced with demands, largely from conservative
and fundamentalist organizations, to purge their li
braries and curricula of books these groups consider
objectionable.
Congress dislikes new cuts
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's plan to
get a head start on new budget cuts by deferring
about $1 billion in 1982 spending drew a lukewarm
to-chilly response from congressional leaders yester
day, and House Republican leader Robert Michel
(III.) said it faces serious trouble.
In a decidedly pessimistic appraisal of the outlook
for the plan in the House, Michel told reporters that
the "prospects... are not good" on item-by-item cut
backs in individual programs.
The deferral strategy, disclosed last week, is aimed
at holding down spending until Congress acts on Rea
gan's latest budget proposals, which anticipate deep
cuts in many social programs, including some that
were protected in the first round of reductions.
Spending in excess of the new proposals would be
put off until Nov. 20, when stop-gap spending author
ity for the government expires. The savings would
amount to about $1 billion — and possibly much
more — and later would be carried over into ap
propriations bills or an omnibus spending-cut meas
ure to replace the stop-gap authority next month.
House Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.) and Majority
Leader James Wright (D-Texas) denounced the new
budget plan yesterday as an assault on congressional
prerogatives and a reneging on promises made earlier
by the administration.

U.S. weapons for the Middle East
Washington — The Pentagon sought yesterday to
backpedal on assertions by Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig that the United States would hold ex
panded joint military maneuvers in the Middle East
and speed deliveries of arms to Egypt and Sudan.
Officials said publicized plans to display American
military might in the Middle East, in the aftermath of
the assassination last week of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat, had caused some anxiety among U.S. al
lies in the region who shy away from high-profile
identification with the United States.
Haig said in Cairo Sunday that the United States
planned to expand previously scheduled joint ma
neuvers, code-named "Operation Bright Star." He
also said Washington would accelerate arms de
liveries as "concrete manifestations" of U.S. de
termination to maintain a strong presence in the vac
uum left in the area after Sadat's death.
Juan Carlos in the U.S.
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday
promised King Juan Carlos of Spain that he will press
for Spain's early entry into the NATO alliance, and the
king in turn offered to use his close ties with moderate
Arab leaders to promote peace in the Middle East.
Hailing the king as a "champion of democracy,"
Reagan said he and the Spanish monarch had dis
cussed "the importance of forging even closer
Western unity and cohesion in the face of a de
termined Soviet challenge."
Speaking to reporters after 1 Vi hours of meetings at
the White House with the king and assorted advisers,
Reagan added:
"We spent considerable time comparing notes on
the Middle East and the interest which our two coun
tries share in promoting peace and stability in that
troubled region so recently shaken by the tragic
death of Egyptian President Sadat."
Tobin takes Nobel prize
Stockholm — Yale University Professor James
Tobin, the chief architect of a theory analyzing how
families and businesses juggle debts and assets against
risk and return, has been awarded the 1981 Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
The Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the
prize yesterday to the 63-year-old native of Cham
paign, 111., for his "analysis of financial markets and
their relations to expenditure decisions, em
ployment, production and prices."
His analysis deals with changes in financial markets
and how they affect households and firms and their
decisions on how they spend, consume, invest and in
cur debts.
Tobin was graduated from Harvard University in
1939 and received his doctorate there in 1947. He has
been professor at Yale since 1955. He was a member of
the Presidential Council of Economic Advisers in
1961-62 and was director of the Cowles Foundation
for Economic Research during the years 1955-61 and
1964-65. He is the author of three books and several
articles.
Stock market edges up
The stock market was little changed yesterday in a
muted response to a new round of cuts in the bank
prime lending rate.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up
.76 to 870.24.
Gainers held a narrow lead over losers in the over
all tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
Numerous banks across the country lowered their
prime lending rates by a full percentage point today,
from 19 to 18 percent.
