Staff lunch
Don't miss the staff lunch with
President Donald Kennedy today â€”
all old, new and in-between staffers
are welcome. That means you: writ
ers, editors, photographers, produc
tion staff and other staff members.
Meet the man about whom you've
been reporting. Ask the question
that has been in your thoughts for the
past month. Eat some food. They'll all
be there.
