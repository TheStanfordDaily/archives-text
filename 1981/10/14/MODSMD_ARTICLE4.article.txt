# False pass got 'Chief' on field
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Counterfeit field passes allowing a
man dressed in traditional Native
American costume to ride a horse
into Stanford Stadium during half
time of Satuday's UCLA football
game have been turned over to the
district attorney's office, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. No arrests have been made
as yet.
A police investigation has found
that the two passes were printed by a

firm in San Jose. Police have also ac
quired a copy of the check used to
pay for the copies, Herrington said.
According to Herrington, the
check was imprinted with "Friends of
the Standford (sic) Indian" and were
signed by Larry Ziebell.
Ziebell, a Palo Alto insurance
agent, is president of Friends of the
Stanford Indian, a group which has
attempted to bring back the Indian
or a suitable compromise as the Uni
versity's symbol. The Indian was the

University's mascot until 1972.
Interviewed yesterday, Ziebell said
that he had "no comment" about the
check.
Zeibell said that while he wasat the
game and did follow the horse and its
rider to the field, he did not wear a
pass and did not open the gate to al
low the horse to enter.
Herrington said a special events
patrol officer at the game saw some
one trying to enter through an outer
locked gate and began to walk over
to the gate when someone else lying
on the ground yelled to the officer
and said that he was injured.
The officer turned around to the
supposedly injured person, and then
the horse came through the gate. As
the officer turned back to see the
horse the downed person disap
peared, Herrington said.
"We don't know if he (the person
on the ground) was part of the ruse or
not," Herrington said. "We don't
know where they got the key."
As the horse and rider galloped to
the inside gate at least two people ran
down and cleared the way. Accord
ing to Herrington, they displayed
field passes, and the officer opened
the gate. Other officers watching
what was occurring decided not to
get in the way of the horse, Her

rington said.
Ziebell identified the horse's rider
as Chief Spotted Wolf, a member of
the Nt-z Perce tribe who lives near
San Luis Obispo. He said Chief
Spotted Wolf was asked by some
alumni to come to a Stanford game
afterthey saw him at a July 4 parade in
Redwood City.
"I don't know who talked to him
first," Zeibell said. "Evidently some
one gave the Chief (Spotted Wolf) a
pass."
Ziebell said that Friends of the
Stanford Indian has existed since
1971, and he has been active in the
group since 1976. This is his first year
as president of the organization.
He claimed that the group has
2300-2400 members, mostly Stanford
alumni members. Ziebell is not a
Stanford alumnus nor has he any af
filiation with the University. "I grew
up in the Bay area," Ziebell said.

"President (Donald) Kennedy and
Andy Geiger (Stanford athletic direc
tor) didn't go to Stanford either."
Ziebell explained that his group
wishes to return the Indian or a com
promise figure such as "chief" to be
the University's symbol.
The special appearance of an Indi
an at a Stanford football game was
the first since 1979, when Timm Wil
liams, also called Chief Lightfoot,
made a surprise visit. Williams had
been the Stanford Indian for 21 years
until 1972 when then-President Rich
ard Lyman announced that the Indi
an would no longer be Stanford's
mascot. Lyman then called the return
of the Indian a "non-negotiable issue
as far as I'm concerned."
Herrington said that he has turned
over evidence to the district at
torney's office to consider for a crim
inal suit and to the University coun
sel's office to consider for a civil suit.

been the Stanford Indian for 21 years
until 1972 when then-President Rich
ard Lyman announced that the Indi
an would no longer be Stanford's
mascot. Lyman then called the return
of the Indian a "non-negotiable issue
as far as I'm concerned."
Herrington said that he has turned
over evidence to the district at
torney's office to consider for a crim
inal suit and to the University coun
sel's office to consider for a civil suit.
Counterfeit field passes allowing a
man dressed in traditional Native
American costume to ride a horse
into Stanford Stadium during half
time of Satuday's UCLA football
game have been turned over to the
district attorney's office, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. No arrests have been made
as yet.
A police investigation has found
that the two passes were printed by a

firm in San Jose. Police have also ac
quired a copy of the check used to
pay for the copies, Herrington said.
According to Herrington, the
check was imprinted with "Friends of
the Standford (sic) Indian" and were
signed by Larry Ziebell.
Ziebell, a Palo Alto insurance
agent, is president of Friends of the
Stanford Indian, a group which has
attempted to bring back the Indian
or a suitable compromise as the Uni
versity's symbol. The Indian was the

University's mascot until 1972.
Interviewed yesterday, Ziebell said
that he had "no comment" about the
check.
Zeibell said that while he wasat the
game and did follow the horse and its
rider to the field, he did not wear a
pass and did not open the gate to al
low the horse to enter.
Herrington said a special events
patrol officer at the game saw some
one trying to enter through an outer
locked gate and began to walk over
to the gate when someone else lying
on the ground yelled to the officer
and said that he was injured.
The officer turned around to the
supposedly injured person, and then
the horse came through the gate. As
the officer turned back to see the
horse the downed person disap
peared, Herrington said.
"We don't know if he (the person
on the ground) was part of the ruse or
not," Herrington said. "We don't
know where they got the key."
As the horse and rider galloped to
the inside gate at least two people ran
down and cleared the way. Accord
ing to Herrington, they displayed
field passes, and the officer opened
the gate. Other officers watching
what was occurring decided not to
get in the way of the horse, Her

rington said.
Ziebell identified the horse's rider
as Chief Spotted Wolf, a member of
the Nt-z Perce tribe who lives near
San Luis Obispo. He said Chief
Spotted Wolf was asked by some
alumni to come to a Stanford game
afterthey saw him at a July 4 parade in
Redwood City.
"I don't know who talked to him
first," Zeibell said. "Evidently some
one gave the Chief (Spotted Wolf) a
pass."
Ziebell said that Friends of the
Stanford Indian has existed since
1971, and he has been active in the
group since 1976. This is his first year
as president of the organization.
He claimed that the group has
2300-2400 members, mostly Stanford
alumni members. Ziebell is not a
Stanford alumnus nor has he any af
filiation with the University. "I grew
up in the Bay area," Ziebell said.

"President (Donald) Kennedy and
Andy Geiger (Stanford athletic direc
tor) didn't go to Stanford either."
Ziebell explained that his group
wishes to return the Indian or a com
promise figure such as "chief" to be
the University's symbol.
The special appearance of an Indi
an at a Stanford football game was
the first since 1979, when Timm Wil
liams, also called Chief Lightfoot,
made a surprise visit. Williams had
been the Stanford Indian for 21 years
until 1972 when then-President Rich
ard Lyman announced that the Indi
an would no longer be Stanford's
mascot. Lyman then called the return
of the Indian a "non-negotiable issue
