# E. Palo Alto: incorporation fight; water problems
## Battle heating up over incorporation 
### Dan McMillan 
After seven months of wrangling over East Palo
Alto's fight to become a separate city, no end to the
struggle is in sight. Tomorrow's meeting of the Local
Area Formation Commission (LAFCo) of San Mateo
County wil at best conclude what is only the first step
in a long process. At the current rate, residents of East
Palo Alto may not be able to vote on incorporation
(cityhood) until 1983, if ever.
This delay should surprise no one. The incorpora
tion issue is a difficult one for all concerned, fraught
with tension and bitterness. To East Palo Alto's black
majority, incorporation represents self-de
termination — an end to the absentee government by
county officials in Redwood City, long been viewed as
demeaning.
The predominantly white, middle-class residents of
East Palo Alto west of the Bayshore Freeway, however,
see incorporation as a threat of being tossed into the
same boat with a community incapable of self-gov
ernment and doomed to financial insolvency.
Barbara Mouton, mayor of East Palo Alto, gave both
philosophical and practical reasons for incorporating.
"Right now," said Mouton, "we're just neglected

stepchildren of the county. We think it's degrading."
Mouton said she also feels that a local government,
run by East Palo Alto residents, would be more re
sponsive to the needs of the community.
Arn Cenedella of the Menlo Park Annexation Com
mittee explained why he and other west of Bayshore
residents oppose incorporation. He insists East Palo
Alto lacks a tax base sufficient to support a city gov
ernment.
He said he doubts that the east of Bayshore resi
dents, the majority of East Palo Alto's population, can
govern themselves. Cenedella gave three examples of
what he thought were poor services in East Palo Alto
to illustrate his point:
— the sanitation department, long known for its
poor service,
— the recreation district, with its inadequate facil
ities,
— the Ravenswood School District, in which three
members of the board of trustees are under indict
ment for mismanagement of funds.
"How," asks Cenedella, "is a city on the verge of
bankruptcy, which is where they'll be in five years,
going to improve these services?"
Cenedella and others fear that the black-domi
nated community leadership doesn't care about the
west of Bayshore residents. Cenedella said, "if west of
Bayshore weren't economically important, they
wouldn't give a damn."
Cenedella said he wanted Menlo Park to annex his
neighborhood; such a move would destroy East Palo
Alto's tax base, rendering incorporation impossible.
However, he and others feel they have more in common
with the middle-class citizens of Menlo Park and want to
enjoy the high quality of services provided by that city.
According to Cenedella, 85 percent of East Palo Alto's
west of Bayshore residents have signed a petition favor
ing annexation by Menlo Park.
Mouton and the East Palo Alto Citizens Committee on
Incorporations (EPACCI) view such arguments as con
trived, citing racism as the chief obstacle to incorpora
tion. Mouton countered Cenedella's claims with these
objections:
(1) — Two studies, one by consultant Angus McDonald
and one by Tom Fletcher and Phil Vincent of SRI Interna
tional, say East Palo Alto does have the tax base it needs in
order to incorporate.
(2) — The sanitation department, recreation district,
and school district are autonomous bodies; their poor
performance cannot be blamed on East Palo Alto. In
corporation would bring sanitation and recreation un
der local control; the school district would stay auton
omous.
(3) — Menlo Park doesn't want the west of Bayshore
section. Its city council passed a 3-1 resolution support
ing incorporation and had Mayor Peg Gunn deliver is
personally at the Sept. 16 LAFCo meeting.
Both sides said that special interests and "back-room

politics" have played a role in the incorporation con
troversy. Mouton claimed that "real estate speculators
are behind much of the opposition: they don't want
property values to drop west of Bayshore."
Cenedella said San Mateo County doesn't collect
enough taxes from East Palo Alto to provide services
there, and is thus forced to subsidize East Palo Alto. Eor
this reason, claims Cenedella, county officials want to
"dump" the region. "All the political pressures," he said,
"are for incorporation." Today, almost seven months af
ter EPACCI filed its petition for cityhood, a final decision
is still a long way off.
At the LAFCo meeting of September 16, Arlen
Gregorio moved to approve incorporation. Before a
vote on this motion, John Ward moved to place the west
of Bayshore section under the administration of Menlo
Park, leaving EPA in a "holding pattern" to allow further
study. Ward's motion passed 3-2.
This motion delays LAFCo's final decision indefinitely;
at the September 21 meeting, however, Ward moved to
suspend the previous week's decision, pending re
consideration. LAFCowill meet tomorrow to take anoth
er vote.
If LAFCo approves incorporation, the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors must then study the issue,
opening a new round of public hearings and
acrimonious debate. Should the board of supervisors
also approve incorporation, the residents of East Palo
Alto will then vote on the issue. No one knows when that
might happen.
