# E. Palo Alto: incorporation fight; water problems
## Battle heating up over incorporation 
### Dan McMillan 
After seven months of wrangling over East Palo
Alto's fight to become a separate city, no end to the
struggle is in sight. Tomorrow's meeting of the Local
Area Formation Commission (LAFCo) of San Mateo
County wil at best conclude what is only the first step
in a long process. At the current rate, residents of East
Palo Alto may not be able to vote on incorporation
(cityhood) until 1983, if ever.
This delay should surprise no one. The incorpora
tion issue is a difficult one for all concerned, fraught
with tension and bitterness. To East Palo Alto's black
majority, incorporation represents self-de
termination — an end to the absentee government by
county officials in Redwood City, long been viewed as
demeaning.
The predominantly white, middle-class residents of
East Palo Alto west of the Bayshore Freeway, however,
see incorporation as a threat of being tossed into the
same boat with a community incapable of self-gov
ernment and doomed to financial insolvency.
Barbara Mouton, mayor of East Palo Alto, gave both
philosophical and practical reasons for incorporating.
"Right now," said Mouton, "we're just neglected

stepchildren of the county. We think it's degrading."
Mouton said she also feels that a local government,
run by East Palo Alto residents, would be more re
sponsive to the needs of the community.
Arn Cenedella of the Menlo Park Annexation Com
mittee explained why he and other west of Bayshore
residents oppose incorporation. He insists East Palo
Alto lacks a tax base sufficient to support a city gov
ernment.
He said he doubts that the east of Bayshore resi
dents, the majority of East Palo Alto's population, can
govern themselves. Cenedella gave three examples of
what he thought were poor services in East Palo Alto
to illustrate his point:
— the sanitation department, long known for its
poor service,
— the recreation district, with its inadequate facil
ities,
— the Ravenswood School District, in which three
members of the board of trustees are under indict
ment for mismanagement of funds.
"How," asks Cenedella, "is a city on the verge of
bankruptcy, which is where they'll be in five years,
going to improve these services?"
Cenedella and others fear that the black-domi
nated community leadership doesn't care about the
west of Bayshore residents. Cenedella said, "if west of
Bayshore weren't economically important, they
