# New well causes an odor in water
## 
### Jonathan Greene 
East Palo Alto's drinking water has often had a
strong odor since a new well began operation in late
July.
"The water is frequently so bad that I consider mov
ing," said Joel Silberman, one of many Stanford stu
dents who live in the section of East Palo Alto west of
the Bayshore Freeway.
According to Edward Barnes, senior civil engineer
for the San Mateo County Department of Public
Works, "Some elements in the well water combine
with the chlorine in the San Francisco system water to
produce an odor." He said he did not know what the
substance was.
Until the installation of the new well at Bay and
Gloria streets, the East Palo Alto Water District was
supplied exclusively by San Francisco's Hetch-Hetchy
aqueduct, as are Stanford, Palo Alto and other nearby
communities. San Mateo County, which operates the
district, decided to install the $200,000 well to replace
some of the costly aqueduct water after San Francisco
raised the rate to 43 cents per hundred cubic feet.
After tests demonstrated a violation of the state wa
ter standard for odor, Barnes was forced to "cut back
use of the well to five hours a day, from 10 a.m. to 3

p.m. on weekdays only, when fewer residents are
home." Complaints to his office have fallen off from
"about seven or eight new ones per day to practically
none."
Barnes said he wants to run the well as much as pos
sible, both to detect any equipment problems before
the well's warranty runs out and to save money for the
district.
Meanwhile, Barnes suggested, residents who are
dissatisfied with theii water may install filters on their
taps or use bottled water.
Barnes insisted the water is safe despite any odor.
Art Burton, director of Sequoia Analytical Laboratory,
which tests the water for the county, said "We've
done all the state required tests, which are very ex
tensive. The water meets all standards (except that) it
has exceeded the state odor standard on occasion."
However, Burton admitted that "there are many
possible contaminants not on the state list. Other tests
to identify the source of the odor could be done and
haven't been, such as a complete organic analysis. But
they are very expensive — about $1000 a sample."
Catherine Ling, who is following the problem for
the California Health Department, defended the state
standards. "These criteria are used all over the coun
try," she said. She said she was not aware of any addi
tional tests that should be performed.
"It is not uncommon that this type of problem oc
curs," she said. "As far as we know, Barnes is doing the
best he can to clear up the problem."
