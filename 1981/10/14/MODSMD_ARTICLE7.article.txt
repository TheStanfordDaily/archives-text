## insulin pump to aid diabetics 
### 
From the Daily wire services
with staff reports by Bill Beyda
A tiny insulin pump, im
planted beneath the skin and
controlled by a micro
computer, promises to free
diabetics from their daily, life
sustaining insulin injections.
The first recipient of the new
device was a 52-year-old nun.
Dr. Helmut Mehnert per
formed the operation in the
Munich-Schwabing Municipal
Hospital on Aug. 5, implanting
the pump beneath the right
clavical and hooking it into a
vein.
The patient was released
from the hospital 10 days later.
She soon returned to her
teaching job and has been liv
ing a normal, active life due to
the pump's action in correcting
the excessive blood sugar that
characterizes diabetes, a
metabolic disorder.
The Stanford Medical Center
is presently using a larger ma
chine as an "artificial pan
creas" to perform this function
for patients, said the Med Cen
ter's Dr. Gerald Reaven.
"The machine we are pres
ently using is known as a closed
system. The machine is rather
large and monitors the pa
tient's blood to determine
what additions, if any, are
needed," Reaven said.
"The other type of pump is
known as an open system,
where the pump does not
monitor the blood, but pumps
only the amount of insulin it
has been mechanically set for,"
he said. This is the type the Ger
man team has developed.
There were many problems
in the new pump's develop
ment, said Mehnert, chief of
the hospital's diabetes research
group. The first was the for
mulation of a concentrated
form of insulin that would
neither decompose over long
periods of time nor block the
fine tube linking the pump to
the vein.
The biggest obstacle was the
development of a breakdown
free pump and control mecha
nism. It was accomplished by

the West German company
Siemens cooperating with phy
sicians of the hospital's re
search team over a period of
eight years.
The pump is the size of a
pack of cigarettes and weighs
six ounces when filled. It is im
planted under local anesthesia
in an operation comparable to
the implantation of a cardiac
pacemaker, said Mehnert.
The pump is hooked into a
vein via a tiny tube and the in
sulin flows constantly, provid
ing an almost perfect dupli
cation of the natural action of
the pancreas. The tube is just
wide enough to allow the in
sulin through, but too narrow
for blood to back up and foul
the pump.
The flow of insulin is regu
lated from outside the body,
and can be varied according to
the time of day, increasing after
meals, for example.
The Munich pump is not the
first. Such devices have been
implanted in patients' ab
dominal cavities in hospitals in
Austria, France and the United
States.
The sub-clavicle pump dif
fers in that it injects insulin
directly into the bloodstream.
But even this is not unique.
Direct-line insulin pumps had
already been developed, but
they functioned from outside
the body, posing the problem
of inconvenience and infec
tion.
The Munich pump, the first
to combine the features of im
plantation and direct injection,
is considered a breakthrough.
The pump's insulin reservoir is
refilled by injection every
three weeks, and the battery is
replaced by minor surgery
once a year.
Mehnert said he anticipates
no problems, but plans to ob
serve the recipient for at least a
year before attempting a sec
ond implant. He said he fore
sees large-scale production in
two or three years, but de
clined to speculate on the
price.

A tiny insulin pump, im
planted beneath the skin and
controlled by a micro
computer, promises to free
diabetics from their daily, life
sustaining insulin injections.
The first recipient of the new
device was a 52-year-old nun.
Dr. Helmut Mehnert per
formed the operation in the
Munich-Schwabing Municipal
Hospital on Aug. 5, implanting
the pump beneath the right
clavical and hooking it into a
vein.
The patient was released
from the hospital 10 days later.
She soon returned to her
teaching job and has been liv
ing a normal, active life due to
the pump's action in correcting
the excessive blood sugar that
characterizes diabetes, a
metabolic disorder.
The Stanford Medical Center
is presently using a larger ma
chine as an "artificial pan
creas" to perform this function
for patients, said the Med Cen
ter's Dr. Gerald Reaven.
"The machine we are pres
ently using is known as a closed
system. The machine is rather
large and monitors the pa
tient's blood to determine
what additions, if any, are
needed," Reaven said.
"The other type of pump is
known as an open system,
where the pump does not
monitor the blood, but pumps
only the amount of insulin it
has been mechanically set for,"
he said. This is the type the Ger
man team has developed.
There were many problems
in the new pump's develop
ment, said Mehnert, chief of
the hospital's diabetes research
group. The first was the for
mulation of a concentrated
form of insulin that would
neither decompose over long
periods of time nor block the
fine tube linking the pump to
the vein.
The biggest obstacle was the
development of a breakdown
free pump and control mecha
nism. It was accomplished by

the West German company
Siemens cooperating with phy
sicians of the hospital's re
search team over a period of
eight years.
