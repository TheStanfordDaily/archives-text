# Satellite service station in space
## 
### Laurence Brothers 
The near future may see
the establishment of a ser
vice station in space, an or
biting drydock where satel
lites and other space vehi
cles might be repaired or re
conditioned. The first step
to such a structure is being
taken now by scientists at
the Lockheed Missiles and
Space Division.
The "space service sys
tem" is "in the conceptual
phase right now/' said Janet
Wrather, publicrelationsof
ficial at Lockheed. The sys
tem will "use the space shut
tle to repair, retrieve and re
furbish satellites," Wrather
said.
The system will be essen
tial to the space program. "It
would be needed before
the decade is out," she said.
As it is now, any un
manned satellite or space

vehicle that is damaged or
completely fulfills its func
tion is just junk floating
around in orbit — a hazard
to any other equipment
nearby and a block to any
one wanting to use the orbit
being obstructed by the
debris. As more and more
satellites break down or are
no longer useful, less and
less space is available for
new missions.
Even on manned space
vehicles repairs are difficult
because space equipment is
not standardized; repairs
must be done on the specif
ic parts or systems that fail.
Space scientists now hope
that satellite and vehicle
equipment will become
modular and systematized,
allowing astronauts using
the service system to easily
replace failed modules with
stock units rather than rely

ing on repairs.
Several new vehicles are
being built to be re
modeled by the service sys
tem. Carl Patterson of
Lockheed said that these in
cluded the space telescope
to be deployed by the space
shuttle in 1984, and thegam
ma-ray observatory. When
these experiments have per
formed their original func
tions, astronauts should be
able to reconfigure the
equipment to yield new re
sults without the expense of
a new mission.
Patterson said that there
are several distinct steps
Lockheed scientists are now
working on. First the system
must have the ability to
deploy, to actually ap
proach the satellite.
Hopefully the shuttle will
perform this role.

Next, the system must
provide a base from which
to observe a satellite or ve
hicle and determine wheth
er repairs are required. As it
is now, astronauts in orbit
have no physical support
from which to work in
"weightless" space.
The system must also pro
vide some means for the
shuttle technicians to re
trieve the piece of equip
ment they wish to repair.
Most importantly, there
must be tools, parts and per
sonnel available to perform
the major functions of sup
port service: replacing
failed items or systems, re
pair or restoration of sys
tems, and reconfiguration
of old systems and addition
of new ones.
Finally, the shuttle must
be able to bring a severely
damaged vehicle "back to
the shop" here on Earth.
As Patterson said, "If
you're going to get econom
ic benefit, that's what you're
going for." Patterson said
he envisions in the
longterm future, the ability
of a space operations cen
ter, a permanent structure
to overhaul spacecraft in or
bit and perhaps form the
nucleus for large-scale con
structions in space.
Conceivably, as proposed
by Gerard O'Neill and the
L-5 society, a group which
advocates the colonization
of space, the service system
might be of use in building
permanent structures for
human habitation.
Besides the space tele
scope and the gamma ray
observatory, Patterson said
that the Multi-Mission
Spacecraft (MMS) would be
built to accommodate the
repair system. The MMS
would be able to perform a
given mission and then be
reconfigured for another,
like the space shuttle.
Although Lockheed is
working under contract to
the NASA Johnson Space
Center on the service sys
tem, it seems obvious that
the system's military uses

probably now overweigh its
civilian ones. Military satel
lites are among those which
can be reached by the shut
tle, and spy satellites have
notoriously short lives due
to their proximity to the at
mosphere. In addition, the
proposed anti-satellite pro
gram (commonly known as
"killer" satellites) would
almost certainly require
some sort of extensive sup
port system.
Lockheed is also working
on the IRAS Space Tele
scope, a joint project of the
United States, Great Britain
and the Netherlands. "The
primary mission of the IRAS
satellite is to do an 'all-sky
map' — a complete pic
ture of the skies as seen
from Earth orbit," explained
Gary Thornley, manager of
the IRAS telescope support
office, "This map will be a
unique event because it will
be photographed in infra
red light, a wavelength
which on Earth is blocked by
the atmosphere."
"Speculation among sci
entists is that a million or
more new IR stars will be
discovered," said Thornley.
The IRAS scientists will issue
a catalogue of the new infra
red sources discovered and
anticipate many new dis
coveries based on the in
formation gathered by the
satellite. Unfortunately, the
IRAS satellite will be orbit
ing in a high polar orbit out
of reach of the shuttle based
service system — 900 kilo
meters (about 500 miles) off
the ground.
The multinational project
will be conducted in several
phases. The body of the ir
recoverable spacecraft has
already been built by
Holland, and the telescope
constructed in the United
States. When the telescope
is launched, hopefully next
August, the satellite's in
formation will be beamed to
receivers in Great Britain.
From there, the data will be
processed at the jet Pro
pulsion Laboratories in
Pasadena.

modular and systematized,
allowing astronauts using
the service system to easily
replace failed modules with
stock units rather than rely

ing on repairs.
Several new vehicles are
being built to be re
modeled by the service sys
tem. Carl Patterson of
Lockheed said that these in
cluded the space telescope
to be deployed by the space
shuttle in 1984, and thegam
ma-ray observatory. When
these experiments have per
formed their original func
tions, astronauts should be
able to reconfigure the
equipment to yield new re
sults without the expense of
a new mission.
Patterson said that there
are several distinct steps
Lockheed scientists are now
working on. First the system
must have the ability to
deploy, to actually ap
proach the satellite.
Hopefully the shuttle will
perform this role.

Next, the system must
provide a base from which
to observe a satellite or ve
hicle and determine wheth
er repairs are required. As it
is now, astronauts in orbit
have no physical support
from which to work in
"weightless" space.
The system must also pro
vide some means for the
shuttle technicians to re
trieve the piece of equip
ment they wish to repair.
Most importantly, there
must be tools, parts and per
sonnel available to perform
the major functions of sup
port service: replacing
failed items or systems, re
pair or restoration of sys
tems, and reconfiguration
of old systems and addition
of new ones.
Finally, the shuttle must
be able to bring a severely
damaged vehicle "back to
the shop" here on Earth.
As Patterson said, "If
you're going to get econom
ic benefit, that's what you're
going for." Patterson said
he envisions in the
longterm future, the ability
of a space operations cen
ter, a permanent structure
to overhaul spacecraft in or
bit and perhaps form the
nucleus for large-scale con
structions in space.
Conceivably, as proposed
by Gerard O'Neill and the
L-5 society, a group which
advocates the colonization
of space, the service system
might be of use in building
permanent structures for
human habitation.
Besides the space tele
scope and the gamma ray
observatory, Patterson said
that the Multi-Mission
Spacecraft (MMS) would be
built to accommodate the
repair system. The MMS
would be able to perform a
given mission and then be
reconfigured for another,
like the space shuttle.
Although Lockheed is
working under contract to
the NASA Johnson Space
Center on the service sys
tem, it seems obvious that
the system's military uses

probably now overweigh its
civilian ones. Military satel
lites are among those which
can be reached by the shut
tle, and spy satellites have
notoriously short lives due
to their proximity to the at
mosphere. In addition, the
proposed anti-satellite pro
gram (commonly known as
"killer" satellites) would
almost certainly require
some sort of extensive sup
port system.
Lockheed is also working
on the IRAS Space Tele
scope, a joint project of the
United States, Great Britain
and the Netherlands. "The
primary mission of the IRAS
satellite is to do an 'all-sky
map' — a complete pic
ture of the skies as seen
from Earth orbit," explained
Gary Thornley, manager of
the IRAS telescope support
office, "This map will be a
unique event because it will
be photographed in infra
red light, a wavelength
which on Earth is blocked by
the atmosphere."
"Speculation among sci
entists is that a million or
more new IR stars will be
discovered," said Thornley.
The IRAS scientists will issue
a catalogue of the new infra
red sources discovered and
anticipate many new dis
coveries based on the in
formation gathered by the
satellite. Unfortunately, the
IRAS satellite will be orbit
ing in a high polar orbit out
of reach of the shuttle based
service system — 900 kilo
meters (about 500 miles) off
the ground.
The multinational project
will be conducted in several
phases. The body of the ir
recoverable spacecraft has
already been built by
Holland, and the telescope
constructed in the United
States. When the telescope
is launched, hopefully next
August, the satellite's in
formation will be beamed to
receivers in Great Britain.
From there, the data will be
processed at the jet Pro
pulsion Laboratories in

OUTERSPACE SERVICE STATION — An artist's conception of an outerspace satellite
service system that would repair, refurbish, or prepare orbiting spacecraft for return to
earth.
The near future may see
the establishment of a ser
vice station in space, an or
biting drydock where satel
lites and other space vehi
cles might be repaired or re
conditioned. The first step
to such a structure is being
taken now by scientists at
the Lockheed Missiles and
Space Division.
The "space service sys

phase right now/' said Janet
Wrather, publicrelationsof

said.
The system will be essen

would be needed before
the decade is out," she said.
As it is now, any un
manned satellite or space

vehicle that is damaged or
completely fulfills its func
tion is just junk floating
around in orbit — a hazard
to any other equipment
nearby and a block to any
one wanting to use the orbit
being obstructed by the
debris. As more and more
satellites break down or are
no longer useful, less and
less space is available for
new missions.
Even on manned space

must be done on the specif
