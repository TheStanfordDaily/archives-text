## Transfer students are happy with their West Coast school 
### Katherine Hutt 
"My only regret is that I didn't come here
as a freshman," said Palmer McDonald, a
transfer from Harvard College. He's been at
Stanford for two weeks.
Not all transfer students would agree with
McDonald, but their general reactions to the
Farm seem overwhelmingly positive.
"Transfers are a lot more appreciative than
other students because they have a basis of
comparison. As a result, transfers may enjoy
themselves more than other people,"
McDonald said.
The University's transfer admissions pro
gram leaves room for 200 to 300 new students
entering either the sophomore or junior
classes. According to Lisa Biermann of the
transfer admissions office, the University
does not have the same type of formal re
cruitment process as it does for freshman ap
plicants, but the admissions process is just as
competitive.

"The attitude at the school
/ came from was that if you
acted like you were
enjoying it, you weren't
serious about your work.
People here are more
concerned about what
you do when you're not
working than how hard
the work is/'
Palmer McDonald

In fact, this quarter it was more difficult to
enter Stanford as a transfer than as a
freshman. Out of 2000 transfer applicants, 225
were admitted, or roughly 10 percent. Of
these, approximately 170 are now enrolled.
Of 14,029 freshman applicants, 17.7 percent
were offered admission.
Admissions officers give equal weight to all
parts of a student's application,and don't just
look for good grades; and in spite of the geo
graphical diversity of the transfers, Biermann
said that this factor is not taken into account
in the selection process.
What are the transfers' reactions to this
whole process? Most are favorably impressed
with the application they fill out. "It's less
grade-oriented than I expected and more
geared to the essence of your application,"
said junior Barb Schuler, a transfer from the
University of Virginia. McDonald said he
thinks that the application shows the Univer
sity's interest in "well-rounded people."
Once the students have been accepted,
they receive information from the Transfer
Admissions office, the Academic Information
Center, the Housing office and the Transfer
Orientation committee. Each of these depart
ments has specific policies regarding the new

students.
Laurie Pollock, who evaluates all courses
taken outside of Stanford for credit, sends a
letter to all transfers notifying them of their
tentative number of units. The maximum
number awarded for work done at another
college is 90, and up to 45 additional units can
be earned by the College Entrance Examina
tion Board Advanced Placement tests.
For the most part, according to Pollock,
only courses which are substantially similar to
courses offered at Stanford can be trans
ferred. But she said that students can petition
for their work to be reevaluated.
The housing system her& guarantees
sophomore transfers two years on campus
and juniors one. According to Mario Ac
questa, undergraduate housing coordinator,
transfers are assigned rooms on a space-avail
able basis as vacancies arise after the regular
draw takes place. They are assigned housing
before people on the waiting list.
Transfers are allowed to indicate their pref
erences out of several categories of resi
dences (such as all-women, trailers and apart
ments), but they are not guaranteed place
ment in a specific residence of their choice.
Reaction to this system seems generally
positive. "I think they handle it as well as they
can handle it," said Barbie Hook, formerly a
student at Wheaton College in Illinois.
"It sure was nice to know that I had a place
to stay," said Nan Zender, a sophomore from
Seattle University.
McDonald said he believes that the hous
ing office does a good job integrating the
transfers with all four classes here, but
Schuler said that transfers should not be
housed in predominantly freshman dorm
areas.
Transfer orientation, which takes place
concurrently with freshman orientation, is
run by a coordinator and volunteers chosen
each spring. This year the program was run by
Robin Lesser, who entered Stanford as a
transfer herself, along with 30 volunteers.
Transfer orientation differs from the
freshman program because there are fewer
people involved and the volunteers get to
know the new students better, said this year's
Freshman Orientation Coordinator Adam
Elsesser. Also more emphasis is placed on ac
ademics since the transfers are more certain
of what courses and majors they are in
terested in, Elsesser said.
One of the questions most frequently
asked of transfers upon their arrival is, "Why
did you choose Stanford?" After more than
two weeks here, the obvious question is,
"Has the place lived up to your expecta
tions?"
For McDonald, Stanford definitely has. The
main reason, he said, is that "the attitude at
the school I came from was that if you acted
like you were enjoying it, you weren't serious
about your work. People here are more con
cerned about what you do when you're not
working than about how hard the work is."
Schuler said that athough she likes the Uni
versity, it's a little too preprofessional "... I
think people here are choosing their occupa
tions before getting their education."
