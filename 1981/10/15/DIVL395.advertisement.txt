Did you
know
we can find
abreast
cancer
as small as
the head of
a pin?
Such a tiny cancer can
almost always be cured. A
cancer of this size can best
be found by mammography
—a technique of low dose
breast x-rays. Using far
less radiation than ever
before, mammography
can detect a cancer long
: before a lump can be felt.
While the cancer is still
highly curable.
Not every woman needs
mammography. But for
those women over 50 or
with special reasons to bt)
concerned, like those %ith
symptoms or a strong
family history of breast
cancer, mammography
can find a tiny cancer
before ithas spread.
Ask your doctor about
mammography.
