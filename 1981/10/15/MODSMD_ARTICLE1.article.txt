# Bradbury, Vidal to speak here

### Katie Smith 
Ray Bradbury and Gore Vidal, two
of America's best-known authors,
are scheduled to give lectures here
this year, the ASSU Speaker's Bureau
has announced.
Bradbury, one of the country's
foremost science fiction writers, and
Vidal, a well-known novelist, will
speak as part of a winter quarter
"writers series," according to Speak
er's Bureau chair Glynn O'Donnell.
Bradbury has been writing science
fiction since 1947, and received wide
acclamation for his series of short
stories, Martian Chronicles, and his
futuristic novel Farenheit 451. Since
beginning his career he has been in
volved in writing radio-drama,
screen plays, poetry and stage pieces,
all in the science-fiction vein.
A graduate of Philips Exeter
Academy, and West Point, Vidal has
won reknown for novels such as
Myra Breckinridge, Two Sisters and
An Evening with Richard Nixon. He
was the Democratic-liberal can
didate for the U.S. Congress in 1960.
The Bureau intends to have a dif
ferent author speak each week of the
quarter as a part of that series.
This quarter the Speaker's Bureau
is working on Rape Awareness Week,
the Third World Coalition Series and
this week's La Semarta de la Raza, a
series of activities celebrating the
union of Latin America.
The Bureau has not yet made plans
for spring quarter speakers.
O'Donnell encourages interested
students to drop by the ASSU office
with ideas.
"The Speaker's Bureau is a student
service," said Council of Presidents
member Mariann Byerwalter. "Any
student can come with suggestions to
access a notable person, can present
funding ideas for a particular speak
er, and take steps to invite that per
son here to campus."
The Bureau wants to stimulate stu
dents with a wide variety of speakers.
In the past, it has sponsored figures
ranging from comedian-im
personator David Frye and actress
Lina Wertmuller, to last year's head
liners, former senator George Mi-
Govern and feminist Bella Abzug.
Meanwhile, the Guest Pro
fessorship Board (GPB) is contacting
prospects for instructors. Letters
have already been sent to journalists
Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley,
author |ohn Cheever and radical
feminist Katy McKinnon, K a law
school professor, and Andrea
Dworkin. The Board is also in the
process of contacting some "former
Presidents," Andrew Young, and
other prominent figures. So far only
Cronkite has replied. "I am currently
unable to accept your offer but I
would like to keep your invitation on
file as a possibility for some time in
the future," he wrote.
Byerwalter, who serves as a COP
contact for the Board feels that "hav
ing John Anderson come to teach last
year was a real boost of confidence to
members of the GPB. Getting him
was a challenge, and his acceptance
legitimized the Board's status, giving
them leverage for future sponsor

ships."
However, "big names" are not
always good teac hers, evidenced by
the fact that many students were dis
appointed with Anderson's course.
Byerwalter agreed, but added "that
was due more to the limitations of
the political science department than
to the capabilities ot the man himself.
He was required to teach the 'legisla
tive process,' rather than something
that would more incorporate his
presidential campaign views. The
readings were extensive but onK
three units of credit was offered for
the course."
Luke Cole, a member of last year's
GPB and the Board's chairman this
year, felt Anderson's guest pro
fessorship was successful.
"Only $5000 of his $10,000 salary
came out of the Board's budget; the
rest was fund-raised," said Coles.
"His three days per week here were
virtually our time to schedule. He
had a lot of student involvement and
made numerous dorm speaking en
gagements. If we scheduled a paid
speaking engagement during those
days (such as his speech for the
Kidney Foundation), the revenue
went to the Board."
Cole also urged students to attend
Board meetings, held Wednesdays at
noon in the ASSU office. "We have
an open board which anyone can
join, $30,000 to work with this year,
and we need student input, ideas and
enthusiasm."
