## Soviets see US losing in Mid-East 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — The Soviet Union
has begun to signal its belief
that the death of Egyptian Pres
ident Anwar Sadat is a fresh op
portunity to reassert its in
fluence in that key Middle
Eastern country and that it ex
pects, at the very least, a gradu
al shift from Cairo leading to a
more anti-American Islamic
world.
After a period of relative re
straint, the Soviet press during
the past two days has
blossomed with commentaries
and reports about the situation
in Egypt that blame the Reagan
administration for "crude in
terference" in its internal af
fairs and denounce "sinister"
plans for an alleged U.S. in
vasion of Libya.
The official Tass news agency
charged Tuesday night that the
United States was "feverishly
stepping up war preparations
in the Middle East" and de
scribed planned arms de
liveries to Egypt and Sudan as
"extremely dangerous and
reckless playing with fire."
These pronouncements lace
together two central themes
that have emerged from Mos
cow's reaction to the assassina
tion of Sadat.
Charge U.S. has lost ally
First is that the United States
has lost not only its key ally in
the Arab world but also the po
litical leader who helped rec
oncile Washington's de
termination to continue un
qualified support for Israel
with the requirement to main
tain a viable U.S. political posi
tion in the Middle East.
The second is that the new
Egyptian leadership — despite
its professed wish to continue
Sadat's pro-Western orien
tation — will want to distance
itself from the United States
and move closer to the Arab
world.
While there is no evidence
that a major policy reassess
ment is under way in Moscow,
the press reports seem to re
flect an effort to keep ev
erybody in the region off bal
ance. Moreover, the Soviets
appear to feel that both the re
cent events and time play into
their hands.
More Moscow involvement
As a result the Soviets have
cautiously reasserted their in
tentions to re-enter the Middle

East dispute with a govern
ment-to-government note to
the United States asserting that
"what is happening around
Egypt cannot but affect the in
terests of the Soviet Union's se
curity." However, they have re
frained from bellicose
statements of intentions to
counter U.S. moves.
Instead, one of the main
thrusts of Soviet propaganda in
recent days focused on Arab
pressure on the new Cairo
leadership to return to the
Arab family. This included kid
glove treatment of recently
elected President Hosni
Mubarak and the presentation
of Sadat's assassination as the
work of his political opponents
rather than of an isolated re
ligious fanatic.
Another theme centers on
what is seen here as an unstable
political situation in Egypt.
American military moves are
perceived as an effort to shore
up the new leadership, "to
ensure its adherence to the

Sadat's course," as Tass put it.
Neither the United States
nor Moscow knows for sure
what Mubarak's policies will
be. While Egypt's new leader
received much of his military

there, he was in the forefront
last month of an Egyptian move
to expel all Soviet technicians
and reduce by half the Soviet
embassy staff.
According to diplomats,

Moscow expects the departure
of Sadat to terminate the Camp
David process.
Tass said that "it would be
well for certain persons to re

liveries of the latest weapons
