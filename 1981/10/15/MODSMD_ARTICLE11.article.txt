# Colombian rebels fight army
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bogota, Colombia — This country has yet to
draw the attention paid to El Salvador or
Guatemala, but there are increasing signs that
the kind of bloody struggle besetting those lands
may be spreading south to Colombia.
While not conclusive, the signals are these: an
increasingly aggressive and daring guerrilla
movement that is supported by Cuba, a nervous
right-wing military establishment that feels un
fairly constrained, a tired and unimaginative ci
vilian leadership, an apathetic population and a
seriously lopsided distribution of wealth and
privilege.
In the last few months, fighting between the
military and the guerrillas has reached a level not
seen since the civil war of the 1940s and early
1950s in which 200,000 people are believed to
have died.
Terrorists have robbed banks of millions of
dollars, fired mortar shells into the presidential
palace in downtown Bogota and kidnapped me
dia stars to publicize their demands.'
High-ranking American officials based in
Washington say that leaders of two rival guerrilla
movements — the M-19 and the pro-Soviet Col
ombian Armed Revolutionary Forces — were
summoned to a meeting in Havana. There, the
report goes, Cuban leaders told the guerrillas to
settle their differences and unify their attacks on
the government.
Military torture reported
On the other side, the Colombian military has
pushed to the limit its already wide powers to
fight the terrorists. There are reports of torture
and deaths of leftists, farmers and politicians. In
a widely publicized speech, army commander
Gen. Fernando Landazabal Reyes warned that
the battle may be reaching a "point of no re
turn."
He indicated that the civilian leaders do not
understand the "full dimension (of) the threat to
the country," and he called on them to "exercise
their influence so that the armed forces will be
respected in their efforts to bring peace to the
country."
That was almost universally viewed as a threat
of a military coup unless the civilians support

without question the military's tactics in dealing
with the guerrillas. President Julio Cesar Turbay
Ayala called off a foreign trip when he heard
about Landazabal's comments. His decision was
viewed here as an effort to forestall any military
move.
Civilian rulers disagree
On the civilian side, there is disagreement,
confusion and a lack of new ideas for meeting
the threat and the underlying problems rending
the society.
Colombia has been governed by civilians
since 1958 and in that time it has developed a
form of democracy that provides for elections to
congress and the presidency but also apportions
Cabinet seats and other positions between the
two main parties.
Much of the current unrest stems from the lef
tist guerrilla groups taking advantage of the dis
content among traditional party leaders arising
from this system of virtual coalition politics.
Human rights violations
The insurgency is also fueled by the country's
widespread poverty and by the allegedly wide
spread human rights violations by government
forces in their effort to defeat the guerrillas.
Concern over the government's ability to han
dle the current strains heightened in the wake of
last month's Liberal Party convention to choose
a candidate for next May's presidential election.
A controversial former president was chosen,
with only lukewarm support.
The opposition Conservative Party, some of
whose leaders are more liberal than the Liberals,
is in disarray and may not be able to take advan
tage of the Lopez candidacy.
None of the probable conservative candidates
has a vigorous program to deal with the guerrilla
threat and the underlying social-economic
problems. None has a strong enough popular
base to discourage the army if it should decide to
stage a coup. All of the infighting and maneu
vering involving aging and well-worn politicians
is unlikely to spark the involvement of the tradi
tionally indifferent populace.
Low voter participation
The last presidential elections drew less than
30 percent of the eligible voters.

Civilian rulers disagree
On the civilian side, there is disagreement,
confusion and a lack of new ideas for meeting
the threat and the underlying problems rending
the society.
Colombia has been governed by civilians
since 1958 and in that time it has developed a
form of democracy that provides for elections to
congress and the presidency but also apportions
Cabinet seats and other positions between the
two main parties.
Much of the current unrest stems from the lef
tist guerrilla groups taking advantage of the dis
content among traditional party leaders arising
from this system of virtual coalition politics.
Human rights violations
The insurgency is also fueled by the country's
widespread poverty and by the allegedly wide
spread human rights violations by government
forces in their effort to defeat the guerrillas.
Concern over the government's ability to han
dle the current strains heightened in the wake of
last month's Liberal Party convention to choose
a candidate for next May's presidential election.
A controversial former president was chosen,
with only lukewarm support.
The opposition Conservative Party, some of
whose leaders are more liberal than the Liberals,
is in disarray and may not be able to take advan
tage of the Lopez candidacy.
None of the probable conservative candidates
has a vigorous program to deal with the guerrilla
threat and the underlying social-economic
problems. None has a strong enough popular
base to discourage the army if it should decide to
stage a coup. All of the infighting and maneu
vering involving aging and well-worn politicians
is unlikely to spark the involvement of the tradi
tionally indifferent populace.
Low voter participation
The last presidential elections drew less than
30 percent of the eligible voters.
Bogota, Colombia — This country has yet to
draw the attention paid to El Salvador or
Guatemala, but there are increasing signs that
the kind of bloody struggle besetting those lands
may be spreading south to Colombia.
While not conclusive, the signals are these: an
increasingly aggressive and daring guerrilla
movement that is supported by Cuba, a nervous
right-wing military establishment that feels un
fairly constrained, a tired and unimaginative ci
vilian leadership, an apathetic population and a
seriously lopsided distribution of wealth and
privilege.
In the last few months, fighting between the
military and the guerrillas has reached a level not
seen since the civil war of the 1940s and early
1950s in which 200,000 people are believed to
have died.
Terrorists have robbed banks of millions of
dollars, fired mortar shells into the presidential
palace in downtown Bogota and kidnapped me
dia stars to publicize their demands.'
High-ranking American officials based in
Washington say that leaders of two rival guerrilla
movements — the M-19 and the pro-Soviet Col
ombian Armed Revolutionary Forces — were
summoned to a meeting in Havana. There, the
report goes, Cuban leaders told the guerrillas to
settle their differences and unify their attacks on
the government.
Military torture reported
On the other side, the Colombian military has
pushed to the limit its already wide powers to
fight the terrorists. There are reports of torture
and deaths of leftists, farmers and politicians. In
a widely publicized speech, army commander
Gen. Fernando Landazabal Reyes warned that
the battle may be reaching a "point of no re
turn."
He indicated that the civilian leaders do not
understand the "full dimension (of) the threat to
the country," and he called on them to "exercise
their influence so that the armed forces will be
respected in their efforts to bring peace to the
country."
That was almost universally viewed as a threat
of a military coup unless the civilians support

without question the military's tactics in dealing
with the guerrillas. President Julio Cesar Turbay
Ayala called off a foreign trip when he heard
about Landazabal's comments. His decision was
viewed here as an effort to forestall any military
move.
