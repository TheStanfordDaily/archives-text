## Religious groups expand options 
### Jim Tassopulos 
The following article is part I of a two part
series on religious organizations in the
Stanford community, aimed at providing a
cohesive, in-depth picture of the variety of,
groups which are currently growing in
popularity among students.

Many would argue that people at Stan
ford perceive the intellect to be supreme.
Given this belief, one would expect re
ligion to play a minor role in the life of the
average Stanford student. However, a
wide variety of religious groups exist on
campus; and most of them are growing
rapidly.
There are six official on-campus min
istries, which, to the uninformed observer
reading registration-time brochures, may
all seem very similar.
But their programs and belief systems
are markedly different. Some represent
traditional church services, while others,
aligned with no church, simply emphasize
a personal relationship with other Chris
tians and God, or social enlightment.
The fastest growing Christian organiza
tion is the Stanford Christian Fellowship or
"Intervarsity" led by Greg Read. Partici
pation in this organization has increased
steadily over the past three years. In fact,
Read projects a permanent membership of
200 for the year.
The programs of the group are based on
the fundamental need to "allow Christ
into your life and to follow his words
(spoken in the Bible) completely."
Intervarsity
Intervarsity meets every Wednesday at
7:00 p.m. in the Meyer Forum Room.
Meetings emphasize group fellowship,
utilizing songs praising jesus and exalting
the human spirit to bring the students to
gether.
Read also gives a sermon at each meet
ing, based on a strict interpretation of the
Bible and the need for commitment to
Christ.
Most students who join Intervarsity do
not, at the beginning, consider themselves
to be devout Christians, according to
Read. However, they improve steadily and
rapidly toward this goal.
Read feels that the efforts of students in
the group has been the greatest factor con
tributing to the increased involvement. He
does not see a major change in the needs
or attitudes of students.
Bill Peatman, a member of Intervarsity
for the past year, chose to join after he
began to consider Christianity "as more
than a pastime." The reasons he became
an active member of Intervarsity centered
around their quality teaching and the op
portunity for meaningful interpersonal re
lationships.
Campus Crusade
Campus Crusade for Christ is another
non-denominational organization which

offers the opportunity for a close, one to
one relationship with Christ and fellow
Christians. Participation in this group has
increased steadily over the past three years
and the number of active members now
stands at 80.
Group director Dave Horner, who is
starting his first year at Stanford, antici
pates an upstep very shortly (similar to that
of Intervarsity's) which will further in
crease participation.
Horner distinguished Campus Crusade
from other groups by its small group Bible
studies for Christians and for those who
are "just curious," and by its discipleship
groups which train students to spread the
word and spirit of Christ. Horner believes
that Campus Crusade is probably more in
terested in evangelism than are other cam-

pus groups, stating, "We're going to show
people who we are and what we have to
offer."
Because of Campus Crusade's close con
nection to an international organization,
they are also able to organize "big events"
which could make them the most visible
Christian group on campus this year.
Campus Crusade also holds a large
meeting every Tuesday night in the lounge
of Kappa Sigma Fraternity which combines
song and Biblical teaching.
Episcopal Fellowship and the Catholic Stu
dent Center
Different in many ways from Intervarsity
and Campus Crusade, the Episcopal Fel
lowship and the Catholic Student Center
also provide opportunity for fellowship
and religious education. These groups are
closely tied with church worship and tradi
tion.
Reverend Phil Wiehe, director of the
Episcopal Fellowship at Stanford, cites a
substantial growth in student participation
over the past five years. He believes that a
combination of changing student needs
and group outreach and publicity are re

sponsible for the growth.
Reverend Wiehe also points to world
events as playing a part in the expanded
participation as in a social cause related
ministry: "There will never be a lack of is
sue now, considering the Reagan adminis
tration and its policies."
Unlike these organizations, the
Episcopal Fellowship gives a rather low
priority to evangelism. Reverend Wiehe
stresses that while bringing people to the
lord is important, reaffirming faith within a
ministry is also necessary.
According to Father Eugene Boyle, the
Catholic Newman Center stresses "the in
tellect seeking for faith," using a combina
tion of scripture, reason, and tradition.
Again, evangelism is not an important
function.
Besides the church services, the Center
sponsors various social and educational ac
tivities, and co-sponsors political forums in
the areas of peace and social justice.
United Christian Campus Ministry
Providing a completely different em
phasis, the United Christian Campus Min
istry (UCCM) offers programs to enlighten
students and to aid the less fortunate.
The ministry serves and is funded by four
protestant denominations, but there is
very little traditional Christian worship. In
stead, the group sponsors programs like
"Issues in Contemporary Theology" and
the "Inquirers Class." Students simply
choose to attend the events that interest
them the most.
UCCM is also the leading sponsor of
most social forums dealing with peace,
arms limitations, and hunger. It is, along
with Hillei, the most socially aware and ac
tive of the religious groups.
Byron Bland, minister for the group,
states, "Instead of pursuing any one faith,
we try to think about various beliefs and
theological perspectives."
Memorial Church
Memorial Church, under the direction
of Dean Hamerton-Kelly, summarizes
another distinct format, for religious
education and worship at Memorial
Church: "Preaching, teaching, music, and
service â€” all on a high level of quality.
These are the key elements."
Memorial Church attempts to meet the
needs of the entire university community.
Also, the Church does not provide op
portunities for small group experiences or
fellowship so important to other Christian
groups.
Hamerton-Kelly sees Memorial
Church emphasizing a "very sophisticated
and intellectual version of religion. The
church challenges accepted ideas as much
as confronts them." . .
These factors, plus a theo
logical approach to the Bible, have caused
the leveling off of active participation in
the church. Hamerton-Kelly
believes many students are opt
ing for the more conservative,
strict interpretation approach
to religion of Intervarsity, Cam
pus Crusade, and the Menlo
Park Presbyterian Church.
"The deeply devout seek out
a church more pious than our
own," he commented, adding
that, "The more conservative
groups emphasize absolute au
thority of the Bible and the
centrality of Jesus. We tend to
be softer on both these mat
ters."
However, Hammerton-Kelly
is proud of the fact that stu
dents later in their Stanford ca
reer become involved in the
church because it is a good way
to re-investigate and re-eval
uate religion after possibly
making the ritualistic break
from home conditioning.
Also, very devout students
whocome to the university and
join a conservative church or
go into fellowship with other
Christians may find their re
ligious faith cracking under
various personal and intellec
tual pressures. They leave re
ligion altogether, but at a later
time come back at a more lib
eral, intellectual level, "a more
tentative form of faith," pro
vided by Memorial Church.

a personal relationship with other Chris
tians and God, or social enlightment.
The fastest growing Christian organiza
tion is the Stanford Christian Fellowship or
"Intervarsity" led by Greg Read. Partici
pation in this organization has increased
steadily over the past three years. In fact,
Read projects a permanent membership of
200 for the year.
The programs of the group are based on
the fundamental need to "allow Christ
into your life and to follow his words
(spoken in the Bible) completely."
Intervarsity
Intervarsity meets every Wednesday at
7:00 p.m. in the Meyer Forum Room.
Meetings emphasize group fellowship,
utilizing songs praising jesus and exalting
the human spirit to bring the students to
gether.
Read also gives a sermon at each meet
ing, based on a strict interpretation of the
Bible and the need for commitment to
Christ.
Most students who join Intervarsity do
not, at the beginning, consider themselves
to be devout Christians, according to
Read. However, they improve steadily and
rapidly toward this goal.
Read feels that the efforts of students in
the group has been the greatest factor con
tributing to the increased involvement. He
does not see a major change in the needs
or attitudes of students.
Bill Peatman, a member of Intervarsity
for the past year, chose to join after he
began to consider Christianity "as more
than a pastime." The reasons he became
an active member of Intervarsity centered
around their quality teaching and the op
portunity for meaningful interpersonal re
lationships.
Campus Crusade
Campus Crusade for Christ is another
non-denominational organization which

offers the opportunity for a close, one to
one relationship with Christ and fellow
Christians. Participation in this group has
increased steadily over the past three years
and the number of active members now
stands at 80.
Group director Dave Horner, who is
starting his first year at Stanford, antici
pates an upstep very shortly (similar to that
of Intervarsity's) which will further in
crease participation.
Horner distinguished Campus Crusade
from other groups by its small group Bible
studies for Christians and for those who
are "just curious," and by its discipleship
groups which train students to spread the
word and spirit of Christ. Horner believes
that Campus Crusade is probably more in
terested in evangelism than are other cam-

growing rapidly.

pus groups, stating, "We're going to show
people who we are and what we have to
offer."
Because of Campus Crusade's close con
nection to an international organization,
they are also able to organize "big events"
which could make them the most visible
Christian group on campus this year.
Campus Crusade also holds a large
meeting every Tuesday night in the lounge
of Kappa Sigma Fraternity which combines
song and Biblical teaching.
Episcopal Fellowship and the Catholic Stu
dent Center
Different in many ways from Intervarsity
and Campus Crusade, the Episcopal Fel
lowship and the Catholic Student Center
also provide opportunity for fellowship
and religious education. These groups are
closely tied with church worship and tradi
tion.
Reverend Phil Wiehe, director of the
Episcopal Fellowship at Stanford, cites a
substantial growth in student participation
over the past five years. He believes that a
combination of changing student needs
and group outreach and publicity are re

sponsible for the growth.
Reverend Wiehe also points to world
events as playing a part in the expanded
participation as in a social cause related
ministry: "There will never be a lack of is
sue now, considering the Reagan adminis
tration and its policies."
Unlike these organizations, the
Episcopal Fellowship gives a rather low
priority to evangelism. Reverend Wiehe
stresses that while bringing people to the
lord is important, reaffirming faith within a
ministry is also necessary.
According to Father Eugene Boyle, the
Catholic Newman Center stresses "the in
tellect seeking for faith," using a combina
tion of scripture, reason, and tradition.
Again, evangelism is not an important
function.
Besides the church services, the Center
sponsors various social and educational ac
tivities, and co-sponsors political forums in
the areas of peace and social justice.
United Christian Campus Ministry
Providing a completely different em
phasis, the United Christian Campus Min
istry (UCCM) offers programs to enlighten
students and to aid the less fortunate.
The ministry serves and is funded by four
protestant denominations, but there is
very little traditional Christian worship. In
stead, the group sponsors programs like
"Issues in Contemporary Theology" and
the "Inquirers Class." Students simply
choose to attend the events that interest
them the most.
UCCM is also the leading sponsor of
most social forums dealing with peace,
arms limitations, and hunger. It is, along
with Hillei, the most socially aware and ac
tive of the religious groups.
Byron Bland, minister for the group,
states, "Instead of pursuing any one faith,
we try to think about various beliefs and
theological perspectives."
Memorial Church
Memorial Church, under the direction
of Dean Hamerton-Kelly, summarizes
another distinct format, for religious
education and worship at Memorial
Church: "Preaching, teaching, music, and
service â€” all on a high level of quality.
These are the key elements."
Memorial Church attempts to meet the
needs of the entire university community.
Also, the Church does not provide op
portunities for small group experiences or
fellowship so important to other Christian
groups.
Hamerton-Kelly sees Memorial
Church emphasizing a "very sophisticated
and intellectual version of religion. The
church challenges accepted ideas as much
as confronts them." . .
These factors, plus a theo
logical approach to the Bible, have caused
the leveling off of active participation in
the church. Hamerton-Kelly
believes many students are opt
ing for the more conservative,
strict interpretation approach
to religion of Intervarsity, Cam
pus Crusade, and the Menlo
Park Presbyterian Church.
"The deeply devout seek out
a church more pious than our
own," he commented, adding
that, "The more conservative
groups emphasize absolute au
thority of the Bible and the
centrality of Jesus. We tend to
be softer on both these mat
ters."
However, Hammerton-Kelly
is proud of the fact that stu
dents later in their Stanford ca
reer become involved in the
church because it is a good way
to re-investigate and re-eval
uate religion after possibly
making the ritualistic break
from home conditioning.
Also, very devout students
whocome to the university and
join a conservative church or
go into fellowship with other
Christians may find their re
ligious faith cracking under
various personal and intellec
tual pressures. They leave re
ligion altogether, but at a later
time come back at a more lib
eral, intellectual level, "a more
tentative form of faith," pro
vided by Memorial Church.
The following article is part I of a two part
series on religious organizations in the
Stanford community, aimed at providing a
cohesive, in-depth picture of the variety of,
groups which are currently growing in
popularity among students.

Many would argue that people at Stan
ford perceive the intellect to be supreme.
Given this belief, one would expect re
ligion to play a minor role in the life of the
average Stanford student. However, a
wide variety of religious groups exist on
campus; and most of them are growing
rapidly.
There are six official on-campus min
istries, which, to the uninformed observer
reading registration-time brochures, may
all seem very similar.
But their programs and belief systems
are markedly different. Some represent
traditional church services, while others,
aligned with no church, simply emphasize

Bible and the need for commitment to
Christ.
Most students who join Intervarsity do
not, at the beginning, consider themselves
to be devout Christians, according to
Read. However, they improve steadily and
rapidly toward this goal.
Read feels that the efforts of students in
the group has been the greatest factor con
tributing to the increased involvement. He
does not see a major change in the needs
or attitudes of students.
Bill Peatman, a member of Intervarsity
for the past year, chose to join after he
began to consider Christianity "as more
than a pastime." The reasons he became
an active member of Intervarsity centered
around their quality teaching and the op
portunity for meaningful interpersonal re
lationships.
Campus Crusade
Campus Crusade for Christ is another
non-denominational organization which

offers the opportunity for a close, one to
one relationship with Christ and fellow
Christians. Participation in this group has
increased steadily over the past three years
and the number of active members now
stands at 80.
Group director Dave Horner, who is
starting his first year at Stanford, antici
pates an upstep very shortly (similar to that
of Intervarsity's) which will further in
crease participation.
Horner distinguished Campus Crusade
from other groups by its small group Bible
studies for Christians and for those who
are "just curious," and by its discipleship
groups which train students to spread the
word and spirit of Christ. Horner believes
that Campus Crusade is probably more in
terested in evangelism than are other cam-

pus groups, stating, "We're going to show
people who we are and what we have to
offer."
Because of Campus Crusade's close con
nection to an international organization,
they are also able to organize "big events"
which could make them the most visible
Christian group on campus this year.
Campus Crusade also holds a large
meeting every Tuesday night in the lounge
of Kappa Sigma Fraternity which combines
song and Biblical teaching.
Episcopal Fellowship and the Catholic Stu
dent Center
Different in many ways from Intervarsity
and Campus Crusade, the Episcopal Fel
lowship and the Catholic Student Center
also provide opportunity for fellowship
and religious education. These groups are
closely tied with church worship and tradi
tion.
Reverend Phil Wiehe, director of the
Episcopal Fellowship at Stanford, cites a
substantial growth in student participation
over the past five years. He believes that a
combination of changing student needs
and group outreach and publicity are re

sponsible for the growth.
Reverend Wiehe also points to world
events as playing a part in the expanded
participation as in a social cause related
ministry: "There will never be a lack of is
sue now, considering the Reagan adminis
tration and its policies."
Unlike these organizations, the
Episcopal Fellowship gives a rather low
priority to evangelism. Reverend Wiehe
stresses that while bringing people to the
lord is important, reaffirming faith within a
ministry is also necessary.
According to Father Eugene Boyle, the
Catholic Newman Center stresses "the in
tellect seeking for faith," using a combina
tion of scripture, reason, and tradition.
Again, evangelism is not an important
function.
Besides the church services, the Center
sponsors various social and educational ac
tivities, and co-sponsors political forums in
the areas of peace and social justice.
United Christian Campus Ministry
Providing a completely different em
phasis, the United Christian Campus Min
istry (UCCM) offers programs to enlighten
students and to aid the less fortunate.
The ministry serves and is funded by four
protestant denominations, but there is
very little traditional Christian worship. In
stead, the group sponsors programs like
"Issues in Contemporary Theology" and
the "Inquirers Class." Students simply
choose to attend the events that interest
them the most.
UCCM is also the leading sponsor of
most social forums dealing with peace,
arms limitations, and hunger. It is, along
with Hillei, the most socially aware and ac
tive of the religious groups.
Byron Bland, minister for the group,
states, "Instead of pursuing any one faith,
we try to think about various beliefs and
theological perspectives."
Memorial Church
Memorial Church, under the direction
of Dean Hamerton-Kelly, summarizes
another distinct format, for religious
education and worship at Memorial
Church: "Preaching, teaching, music, and
service â€” all on a high level of quality.
These are the key elements."
Memorial Church attempts to meet the
needs of the entire university community.
Also, the Church does not provide op
portunities for small group experiences or
fellowship so important to other Christian
groups.
Hamerton-Kelly sees Memorial
Church emphasizing a "very sophisticated
and intellectual version of religion. The
church challenges accepted ideas as much
as confronts them." . .
These factors, plus a theo
logical approach to the Bible, have caused
the leveling off of active participation in
the church. Hamerton-Kelly
believes many students are opt
ing for the more conservative,
strict interpretation approach
to religion of Intervarsity, Cam
pus Crusade, and the Menlo
Park Presbyterian Church.
"The deeply devout seek out
a church more pious than our
own," he commented, adding
that, "The more conservative
groups emphasize absolute au
thority of the Bible and the
centrality of Jesus. We tend to
be softer on both these mat
ters."
However, Hammerton-Kelly
is proud of the fact that stu
dents later in their Stanford ca
reer become involved in the
church because it is a good way
to re-investigate and re-eval
uate religion after possibly
making the ritualistic break
from home conditioning.
Also, very devout students
whocome to the university and
join a conservative church or
go into fellowship with other
Christians may find their re
ligious faith cracking under
various personal and intellec
tual pressures. They leave re
ligion altogether, but at a later
time come back at a more lib
eral, intellectual level, "a more
tentative form of faith," pro
vided by Memorial Church.
The following article is part I of a two part
series on religious organizations in the
Stanford community, aimed at providing a
cohesive, in-depth picture of the variety of,
groups which are currently growing in
popularity among students.

Many would argue that people at Stan
ford perceive the intellect to be supreme.
Given this belief, one would expect re
ligion to play a minor role in the life of the
average Stanford student. However, a
wide variety of religious groups exist on
campus; and most of them are growing
rapidly.
There are six official on-campus min
istries, which, to the uninformed observer
reading registration-time brochures, may
all seem very similar.
But their programs and belief systems
are markedly different. Some represent
traditional church services, while others,
aligned with no church, simply emphasize
a personal relationship with other Chris
tians and God, or social enlightment.
The fastest growing Christian organiza
tion is the Stanford Christian Fellowship or
"Intervarsity" led by Greg Read. Partici
pation in this organization has increased
steadily over the past three years. In fact,
Read projects a permanent membership of
200 for the year.
The programs of the group are based on
the fundamental need to "allow Christ
into your life and to follow his words
(spoken in the Bible) completely."
Intervarsity
Intervarsity meets every Wednesday at
7:00 p.m. in the Meyer Forum Room.
Meetings emphasize group fellowship,
utilizing songs praising jesus and exalting
the human spirit to bring the students to
gether.
Read also gives a sermon at each meet
ing, based on a strict interpretation of the
Bible and the need for commitment to
Christ.
Most students who join Intervarsity do
not, at the beginning, consider themselves
to be devout Christians, according to
Read. However, they improve steadily and
