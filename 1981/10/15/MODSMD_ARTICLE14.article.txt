# Sleeping on the Job?

### Jeff Sims 
Each summer, while many
Stanford students are busy
catching up on the sleep they
missed the year before,
Lambda Nu hosts researchers
studying the sleeping patterns
of a group of children and
adolescents. Each year the
same group of children return
for a period of three days to
have their sleep monitered by
Dr. Mary Carskadon of Stan
ford's Research Center and her
staff.
"What we have been doing is
a longitudinal assessment of
sleep in adolescents — observ
ing the changes in sleep that
take place through advanced
years," Carskadon said, who
has headed the Lambda Nu
study for the past six years.
Carskadon's research is only
part of the variety of sleep re
search and treatment of sleep
disorders that has been going
on here under the direction of
Dr. William Dement, head of
the Sleep Research Center.
According to Steve Coburn
of the Center, sleep is still a fair
ly unexplored area. In fact,
Stanford is one of the few
places in the country where
sleep is being investigated.
"This is really a frontier of
medicine," Coburn said. "Lit
erally one-third of people's
lives is unknown by most doc
tors. Medical students learn
almost nothing of sleep dis
order in medical school."
According to Coburn, this
lack of knowledge results in sit
uations where physicians often
incorrectly diagnose or inef
fectively treat many patients'
sleep problems. Patients finally

come to the Sleep Center after
the failure of other treatments
to solve their problems.
"By the time we eventually
see some patients, they may
have had problems for 20 or 30
years," said Coburn.
But researchers are working
to cure these problems, espe
cially in the Stanford Center.
Three of the major areas in
which significant progress has
been made are in narcolepsy,
sleep apnea, and insomnia.
Narcolepsy, a condition in
which people suddenly fall
asleep at inappropriate mo
ments, was described in medi
cal literature almost a century
ago, but significant discoveries
have been made in the last
twenty years. Scientists now
know that REM sleep, a condi
tion which involves muscle
paralysis, occurs in most peo
ple a while after sleep has com
menced. But narcoleptics, if
triggered by excitement or
other strong emotions, can slip
directly into REM sleep and its
accompanying muscle paral
ysis.
Dr. Dement and his col
leagues at the Sleep Research
Center have been investigating
this disease, and havefound in
creasingly persuasive evidence
that the condition seems to be
hereditary. Experiments with
dogs have shown that offspring
of narcoleptic parents tend to
have the disease, and humans
as well seem to inherit
narcolepsy.
Sleep apnea, a recently de
scribed condition, is a periodic
breathing obstruction during
sleep associated with heavy
snoring, excessive daytime

sleepiness and high blood
pressure.
Researchers here have
found that sleep apnea patients
have irregular heart rhythms
that can lead to death while
they are asleep. Sleep apnea is
especially prevalent among the
elderly.
According to Coburn, two
out of five people over 62 may
have the problem. Many are
not even aware of it.
Another form of sleep apnea
may be the sudden infant
death syndrome. "Crib Death"
is the leading cause of infant
mortality in the United States
today.
A less serious, although
widespread problem, is insom
nia. Last year the Sleep Re
search Center placed ads in the
Daily and other local news
papers recruiting insomniacs
for drug testing experiments.
According to Coburn, the Re
search Center did work for
drug companies who wanted
to satisfy their FDA require
ments.
"Many drugs," said Coburn,
"have serious side effects.
Dalmane, for example, has a
long half-life and takes a long
time to wash out from the
body. As a result, the patient
remains sleepy the next day."
"Many doctors who give
their patients these drugs just
don't understand all the side
effects," Coburn said.
For those who do not have
serious somnolence problems,
sleep researcher Mary
Carskadon offers a bit of ad
vice: "College students need
more sleep."

have had problems for 20 or 30
years," said Coburn.
But researchers are working
to cure these problems, espe
cially in the Stanford Center.
Three of the major areas in
which significant progress has
been made are in narcolepsy,
sleep apnea, and insomnia.
Narcolepsy, a condition in
which people suddenly fall
asleep at inappropriate mo
ments, was described in medi
cal literature almost a century
ago, but significant discoveries
have been made in the last
twenty years. Scientists now
know that REM sleep, a condi
tion which involves muscle
paralysis, occurs in most peo
ple a while after sleep has com
menced. But narcoleptics, if
triggered by excitement or
other strong emotions, can slip
directly into REM sleep and its
accompanying muscle paral
ysis.
Dr. Dement and his col
leagues at the Sleep Research
Center have been investigating
this disease, and havefound in
creasingly persuasive evidence
that the condition seems to be
hereditary. Experiments with
dogs have shown that offspring
of narcoleptic parents tend to
have the disease, and humans
as well seem to inherit
narcolepsy.
Sleep apnea, a recently de
scribed condition, is a periodic
breathing obstruction during
sleep associated with heavy
snoring, excessive daytime

sleepiness and high blood
pressure.
Researchers here have
found that sleep apnea patients
have irregular heart rhythms
that can lead to death while
they are asleep. Sleep apnea is
especially prevalent among the
elderly.
According to Coburn, two
out of five people over 62 may
have the problem. Many are
not even aware of it.
Another form of sleep apnea
may be the sudden infant
death syndrome. "Crib Death"
is the leading cause of infant
mortality in the United States
today.
A less serious, although
widespread problem, is insom
nia. Last year the Sleep Re
search Center placed ads in the
Daily and other local news
papers recruiting insomniacs
for drug testing experiments.
According to Coburn, the Re
search Center did work for
drug companies who wanted
to satisfy their FDA require
ments.
"Many drugs," said Coburn,
"have serious side effects.
Dalmane, for example, has a
long half-life and takes a long
time to wash out from the
body. As a result, the patient
remains sleepy the next day."
"Many doctors who give
their patients these drugs just
don't understand all the side
effects," Coburn said.
For those who do not have
serious somnolence problems,
sleep researcher Mary
Carskadon offers a bit of ad
vice: "College students need
more sleep."
Each summer, while many
Stanford students are busy
catching up on the sleep they
missed the year before,
Lambda Nu hosts researchers
studying the sleeping patterns
of a group of children and
adolescents. Each year the
same group of children return
for a period of three days to
have their sleep monitered by
Dr. Mary Carskadon of Stan
ford's Research Center and her
staff.
"What we have been doing is
a longitudinal assessment of
sleep in adolescents — observ
ing the changes in sleep that
take place through advanced
years," Carskadon said, who
has headed the Lambda Nu
study for the past six years.
Carskadon's research is only
part of the variety of sleep re
search and treatment of sleep
disorders that has been going
on here under the direction of
Dr. William Dement, head of
the Sleep Research Center.
According to Steve Coburn
of the Center, sleep is still a fair
ly unexplored area. In fact,
Stanford is one of the few
places in the country where
sleep is being investigated.
"This is really a frontier of
medicine," Coburn said. "Lit
erally one-third of people's
lives is unknown by most doc
tors. Medical students learn
almost nothing of sleep dis
order in medical school."
According to Coburn, this
lack of knowledge results in sit
uations where physicians often
incorrectly diagnose or inef
fectively treat many patients'
sleep problems. Patients finally

come to the Sleep Center after
the failure of other treatments
to solve their problems.
"By the time we eventually
see some patients, they may
have had problems for 20 or 30
years," said Coburn.
But researchers are working
