## Garey Ramey Credit doesn't grow on trees 
### 
It is widely held that money does
not grow on trees. Those who dwell
on this point presumably wish money
did grow on trees, so they could pick
as much as they wanted. They fail to
consider that if this were the case, the
money would have no value. It
would be like trying to pay for gro
ceries with a stack of oak leaves.
This point may seem obvious, but
sober world policymakers continue
to profess their desire for a limitless
source of money. Leaders of Western
and Third World nations alike pro
mote schemes to expand world liq
uidity through institutions such as
the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). They con
demn the tight money policies of the
Cj.S. Federal Reserve with outrage
and indignation.

The global economy is presently
faced with the dilemma of debilitat
ing inflation and stagnant economic
growth, problems that cannot be
solved by means of easy money. On
the contrary, the monetary profli
gacy of the recent past has been re
sponsible for much of the present
distress, and continuation of these
policies can only lead to a de
terioration of the economic situ
ation, if not catastrophe.
Easy money manifests itself in read
ily available credit from banks, gov
ernments and international institu
tions. Expansionary monetary poli
cies by central banks put large re
serves of cash in the hands of multi
national commercial banks, who
then make loans to other nations.
Governments themselves offer leni
ent credit terms to induce nations to
buy their exports.
Finally, loans are readily available
from the international banks. The

IMF especially has the ability to ex
pand world liquidity through "spe
cial drawing rights," or SDRs, which
serve as world money and thus play a
significant role in augmenting in
ternational purchasing power.
These forces together are expand
ing the "world money supply" at a
fantastic rate. As the liquidity of na
tions expands without a correspond
ing rise in supplies of real goods, the
nominal prices of these goods must
increase. This inflation is especially
harmful to the resource-poor coun
tries who are net purchasers of real
goods.
High international inflation has led
to a tremendously unstable world
economy. Productive investment
and economic development have
been undermined by these uncer-

tainties, while the environment has
fostered predatory policies such as
tariffs which close off markets to de
veloping countries. It is ironic indeed
that the supposedly benevolent
Western nations have sought to pro
vide the Third World with plenty of
purchasing power to buy Western
goods, while at the same time deny
ing them access to Western markets.
The result, of course, is impoverished
nations, deep in debt, unable to de
velop due to restricted trade.
Many nations have piled up gigan
tic debt burdens and must continue
to borrow frantically to pay the in
terest alone. For years Denmark, for
example, financed its trade deficits
with loans. Faced with a weakening
kroner and high inflation, the Danish
government acted to reduce
domestic income in order to lower
imports. Although imports have
gone down significantly, the current
deficit has increased due to the in

terest burden.
The practice of easy money has
made it simple for unwise govern
ments to fall into the dilemma of
Denmark. For a developing country,
the political pressure to take advan
tage of liberal credit can be over
whelming, even if such loans do not
appreciably contribute to economic
development. With huge interest
payments to make, the time may
come when a large borrower such as
Brazil cannot meet its obligations. A
default such as this would wipe out
the balance sheets of the multi
national banks, leading to a financial
crisis whose potential impact cannot
be imagined.
Clearly, expanded world liquidity
is no solution to these problems.
World credit must instead be
tightened up. Development projects
must be carefully screened to insure
that they will contribute to output of
real goods, and so justify their financ
ing. Most importantly, the world
market must be opened up to allow
developing nations to compete free
'y-
Interestingly, these are the precise
measures which the Reagan adminis
tration is forcefully advocating. De
spite widespread criticism that the
administration possesses no
coherent foreign policy, action has
been taken to address the global eco
nomic malaise in a manner that leads
the world in a new direction. In his
addressto the 36th annual meeting of
the IMF and the World Bank, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan called for re
duced lending by these institutions,
in addition to immediate liber
alization of world trade.
If Reagan's call is heeded, then a
real solution to underdevelopment
and world economic instability will
be within reach. But there is tremen
dous political allure in the notion of a
quick, painless solution, something
for nothing. Even the idea of a magic
money orchard can dominate our ec
onomic thinking.
