## Neutron bomb: an inadequate defense 
### 
So, Edward Teller wants us to know that the neu
tron bomb would benefit peace (Daily, Oct. 12).
No great surprise, that. After all, the weapon was
developed a decade ago at the Lawrence Liver
more Laboratory. And Edward Teller was the
founder and long-time director of that laboratory.
The weapon was conceived and developed under
his direction. So it is no wonder that he wants us to
believe that it is a good thing.
Only when we begin to look at the factual
statements in support of his assertion do we begin
to wonder. He tells us that this weapon, . . fired
from a hundred miles behind the lines .. . has
marked advantages over conventional anti-tank
weapons in portability."
Whatever does he mean by this? Conventional
anti-tank weapons are some of the most compact
and effective weapons now available. Hand car
ried, hand launched weapons can now be wire
guided or laser directed to an almost certain direct
hit. The Israelifarmy can tell you all about that —
the blackened wreckage of its tanks still litters the
Sinai desert. The cost of these weapons is so low
that a battlefield can be blanketed with these
weapons for less than the cost of a single troop of

tanks.
Teller also tells us that.. the relatively thin ar
mor of a tank ... is totally inadequate against..
the radiation from the neutron bomb. What he
doesn't say is that adding a few slabs of boron
loaded plastic to the turret will effectively shield
the crew from the neutron radiation. That just
leaves the civilian population who, as he points
out, "will be killed by instant radiation." Not, you
will note, killed instantly by the radiation, but
killed slowly by the radiation. It takes about 10 days
of diarrhea and vomiting to die of radiation.
It is the politics of his proposal which completely
amaze the mind. He tells us that "neutron bombs
should be available for use in defense of and on
one's own land." Well, of course, one should be
free to do whatever one wishes with one's own
land. But a quarter of a million people came to
gether in Bonn last weekend to point out that the
plains of Northern Europe are not Edward Teller's
own land. Not Edward Teller's, not Alexander
Haig's, not Richard Allen's and not mine or yours.
Neutron bombs dropped on Idaho, or even
Atherton probably wouldn't raise much of a politi
cal outcry in North Germany. But if you go to

Luneburg 01 Hanover and ask them there if they
want it, they will look at you strangely and say
"Nein, danke."
With the last sentence of Teller's piece I have no
disagreement. He speaks of "a dangerous future
which becomes the more dangerous the less we
think about it." It's nice we agree about some
thing.
I wonder though, why Teller comes to us with
such a strangely careless argument to explain why
the neutron bomb will finally give us peace. He's
not a careless man. He knows the facts as well as
anyone. When a man appears to be giving a false
argument about something that may affect my
chances of life or death it begins to worry me.
Is this whole structure of nuclear deterrence,
this whole nightmare of the two great powers be
having, as Oppenheimer observed, "like two scor
pions in a bottle," this whole crazy scheme sup
ported solely by arguments as fallacious as Teller's?
I suspect that it is.

tanks.
Teller also tells us that.. the relatively thin ar
mor of a tank ... is totally inadequate against..
the radiation from the neutron bomb. What he
doesn't say is that adding a few slabs of boron
loaded plastic to the turret will effectively shield
the crew from the neutron radiation. That just
leaves the civilian population who, as he points
out, "will be killed by instant radiation." Not, you
will note, killed instantly by the radiation, but
killed slowly by the radiation. It takes about 10 days
of diarrhea and vomiting to die of radiation.
It is the politics of his proposal which completely
amaze the mind. He tells us that "neutron bombs
should be available for use in defense of and on
one's own land." Well, of course, one should be
free to do whatever one wishes with one's own
land. But a quarter of a million people came to
gether in Bonn last weekend to point out that the
plains of Northern Europe are not Edward Teller's
own land. Not Edward Teller's, not Alexander
Haig's, not Richard Allen's and not mine or yours.
Neutron bombs dropped on Idaho, or even
Atherton probably wouldn't raise much of a politi
cal outcry in North Germany. But if you go to

Luneburg 01 Hanover and ask them there if they
want it, they will look at you strangely and say
"Nein, danke."
With the last sentence of Teller's piece I have no
disagreement. He speaks of "a dangerous future
which becomes the more dangerous the less we
think about it." It's nice we agree about some
thing.
I wonder though, why Teller comes to us with
such a strangely careless argument to explain why
the neutron bomb will finally give us peace. He's
not a careless man. He knows the facts as well as
anyone. When a man appears to be giving a false
argument about something that may affect my
chances of life or death it begins to worry me.
Is this whole structure of nuclear deterrence,
this whole nightmare of the two great powers be
having, as Oppenheimer observed, "like two scor
pions in a bottle," this whole crazy scheme sup
ported solely by arguments as fallacious as Teller's?
I suspect that it is.
