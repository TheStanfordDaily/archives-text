## Dunking displays tacit acquiesence to blight 
### 
In reference to your article, "Zetes
dunk woman, house status in
doubt," (Daily, Oct. 12), we as wit
nesses to the euphemistic "dunking"
wish to correct an incorrectly re
ported statement and to address the
remarks quoted from the Zete Psi
president, Mike Zboralske.
The Mills student who was the vic
tim of this unprovoked attack was
never party to an argument (as was
erroneously reported), though one
of the women who left with her did
have a heated exchange with a house
member who told the dripping and
crying 20-year-old to get off of the
house's carpet. The same house

member also inquired whether the
shivering and unassisted party-goer
was in any way sexually gratified by
her inadvertent plunge. It was at this
time that our group of friends de
cided that if this was Stanford, we
preferred East Oakland, and left to
find help for our friend.
As to the statement made by Zete
president Zboralske'"She definitely
did not hit her heat* ), the doctors'
reports will speak for themselves. We
counter with the question — what
does it take? So her skull wasn't frac
tured — this time. Must some other
unsuspecting woman attend a Zete
exchange and be maimed or

mutilated before some form of ac
tion will be taken?
Stanford University, by allowing
such rot to blight the Farm and its vis
itors, gives tacit acquiesence to this
kind of unconscionable behavior. In
the real world, o.ie calls the SPCA or
the town kennel when confronted
with abusive animals; 'tis a pity it's
not so simple when dealing with the
animals on the Farm.

In the rush of registration I doubt if
many students were aware of the fact
that a former Stanford graduate stu
dent, Rashid Sadrolhefazi, was ex
ecuted without benefit of trial by an
Iranian firing squad on Sept. 22.
Sadrolhefazi returned home early
in 1979 filled with hope for a new Iran
based on the democratic principles
inherent in Islam. In letters and
phone calls to friends he described

the exhilaration of his first months at
home. At night he guarded his neigh
borhood against attacks by diehard
supporters of the exiled shah, later
he worked in the fields helping with
the harvest of much needed wheat.
Best of all, he delighted in several
weeks of bouncing in a jeep around
southeastern Iran compiling an in
ventory of the educational needs of
the impoverished villages.
Along with several other Stanford
men, Sadrolhefazi went on to serve
as an aide to President Abdolhassan
BaniSadr. Before BaniSadr's escape
to France, he and his aides went into
hiding. Sadrolhefazi was soon found
and held in prison for three months
preceding his execution. I have
spoken to his father in Iran and
learned that his family had good rea
son to believe that he was to have
been released soon.
Sadrolhifazi still has many good
friends on campus who are shocked
by his death as well as by the hun
dreds of other senseless executions
carried out by the present reac
tionary regime. Those of us who
knew Sadrolhefazi remember a gen
erous, intense, restless young man,
always the person to call whenever
anyone needed help of any kind. I
know, he was my best friend.

supporters of the exiled shah, later
he worked in the fields helping with
the harvest of much needed wheat.
Best of all, he delighted in several
weeks of bouncing in a jeep around
southeastern Iran compiling an in
ventory of the educational needs of
the impoverished villages.
Along with several other Stanford
men, Sadrolhefazi went on to serve
as an aide to President Abdolhassan
BaniSadr. Before BaniSadr's escape
to France, he and his aides went into
hiding. Sadrolhefazi was soon found
and held in prison for three months
preceding his execution. I have
spoken to his father in Iran and
learned that his family had good rea
son to believe that he was to have
been released soon.
Sadrolhifazi still has many good
friends on campus who are shocked
by his death as well as by the hun
dreds of other senseless executions
carried out by the present reac
tionary regime. Those of us who
knew Sadrolhefazi remember a gen
erous, intense, restless young man,
always the person to call whenever
anyone needed help of any kind. I
know, he was my best friend.

In reference to your article, "Zetes
dunk woman, house status in
doubt," (Daily, Oct. 12), we as wit
nesses to the euphemistic "dunking"
wish to correct an incorrectly re
ported statement and to address the
remarks quoted from the Zete Psi
president, Mike Zboralske.
The Mills student who was the vic
tim of this unprovoked attack was
never party to an argument (as was
erroneously reported), though one
of the women who left with her did
have a heated exchange with a house
member who told the dripping and
crying 20-year-old to get off of the
house's carpet. The same house

member also inquired whether the
shivering and unassisted party-goer
was in any way sexually gratified by
her inadvertent plunge. It was at this
time that our group of friends de
cided that if this was Stanford, we
preferred East Oakland, and left to
find help for our friend.
As to the statement made by Zete
president Zboralske'"She definitely
did not hit her heat* ), the doctors'
reports will speak for themselves. We
counter with the question — what
does it take? So her skull wasn't frac
tured — this time. Must some other
unsuspecting woman attend a Zete
exchange and be maimed or

mutilated before some form of ac
tion will be taken?
Stanford University, by allowing
such rot to blight the Farm and its vis
itors, gives tacit acquiesence to this
kind of unconscionable behavior. In
the real world, o.ie calls the SPCA or
the town kennel when confronted
with abusive animals; 'tis a pity it's
not so simple when dealing with the
animals on the Farm.

Execution in Iran
In the rush of registration I doubt if
many students were aware of the fact
that a former Stanford graduate stu
dent, Rashid Sadrolhefazi, was ex
ecuted without benefit of trial by an
Iranian firing squad on Sept. 22.
Sadrolhefazi returned home early
in 1979 filled with hope for a new Iran
based on the democratic principles
inherent in Islam. In letters and
phone calls to friends he described

the exhilaration of his first months at
home. At night he guarded his neigh
borhood against attacks by diehard
supporters of the exiled shah, later
he worked in the fields helping with
the harvest of much needed wheat.
Best of all, he delighted in several
weeks of bouncing in a jeep around
southeastern Iran compiling an in
ventory of the educational needs of
the impoverished villages.
Along with several other Stanford
men, Sadrolhefazi went on to serve
as an aide to President Abdolhassan
BaniSadr. Before BaniSadr's escape
