# Curb wants state budget restraint, criminal codes strongly enforced
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
Lt. Governor Mike Curb, speaking
yesterday at a Palo Alto and Los Altos
Republican Women's Club meeting
in Los Altos, said he believes Califor
nians want a return to basics: regu
lated budget spending, more jobs,
feasible housing prices and quality
education.
The way to deliver the basics, Curb
told an audience of 120, is to run the
state like a business.
"We have to get the finest people
to serve this state," Curb said, "peo
ple with common sense, with a busi
nesslike approach to the state."
Curb said the state budget must be
controlled and state laws must be
more strictly enforced to achieve
those basic goals.
Curb, a 1982 gubernatorial can
didate, criticized Governor Jerry
Brown's spending programs, saying
they lack regulation. When President
Ronald Reagan was governor, said
Curb, the state was left with a budget
surplus because of fiscal restraints.
Brown, however, does not apply
restraints, Curb said. He cited as an
example Brown's failure to ease
spending despite the passage of
Proposition 13. As a result, Curb said,
the state is in a financial mess.

While state spending should be
controlled, Curb said state residents
need financial breaks. He would like
to see an end to the inheritance tax
and he wants tax-free savings ac
counts offered in order to increase
savings rates as a backbone to mort
gage-lending programs.
Curb would also like stricter law
enforcement.
"There is a lack of necessary laws
and convictions in this state and the
death penalty is not being enforced,"
Curb said. "Capital punishment must
once again be enforced in the state.
We have no alternative."
Curb predicts the "Victim's Bill of
Rights" initiative will pass in Decem
ber. The initiative will achieve stricter
law enforcement, he said.
The initiative covers 10 points,
Curb explained. Among the areas
covered in the initiative are allow
ances for additions of five years to the
sentences of persons with prior felo
ny convictions. Temporary insanity
pleas and plea bargaining would also
be limited and the number of youths
sent to federal prisons over the Cali
fornia Youth Authority would be in
creased. The CYA releases offenders
when they reach 25 years of age.
Curb also said that if he were gov

ernor, he would appoint judges who
reflect the interests of Californians.
"Jerry Brown has appointed 650
judges who are mostly liberal," Curb
said. "These people do not stand for
what you believe in or I believe in."
Curb cited Chief Justice Rose Bird
as an example of a judge who does
not pass laws reflected by the wishes
of Californians.
"If I had it my way, I'd recall Rose
Bird," Curb said.
Curb also briefly addressed other
issues.
On Governor Brown: "I will do ev
erything in my power to make sure
he is not elected to the United States
Senate."
On the Peripheral Canal issue: "I
. .. am not supporting it. . .We don't
need it at the present time and we
can't afford it. It's not responsible
from a fiscal point of view."
On illegal aliens: "We have to give
our own people the incentive to
work. Until then we will have illegal
aliens here." (Curb said able-bodied
Americans find it's easier to be on
welfare than work, which makes it
easier for illegal aliens to get jobs.)
On Diablo Canyon: "We can't do
without it to get the energy needed.

lated budget spending, more jobs,
feasible housing prices and quality
education.
The way to deliver the basics, Curb
told an audience of 120, is to run the
state like a business.
"We have to get the finest people
to serve this state," Curb said, "peo
ple with common sense, with a busi
nesslike approach to the state."
Curb said the state budget must be
controlled and state laws must be
more strictly enforced to achieve
those basic goals.
Curb, a 1982 gubernatorial can
didate, criticized Governor Jerry
Brown's spending programs, saying
they lack regulation. When President
Ronald Reagan was governor, said
Curb, the state was left with a budget
surplus because of fiscal restraints.
Brown, however, does not apply
restraints, Curb said. He cited as an
example Brown's failure to ease
spending despite the passage of
Proposition 13. As a result, Curb said,
the state is in a financial mess.

While state spending should be
controlled, Curb said state residents
need financial breaks. He would like
to see an end to the inheritance tax
and he wants tax-free savings ac
counts offered in order to increase
savings rates as a backbone to mort
gage-lending programs.
Curb would also like stricter law
enforcement.
"There is a lack of necessary laws
and convictions in this state and the
death penalty is not being enforced,"
Curb said. "Capital punishment must
once again be enforced in the state.
We have no alternative."
Curb predicts the "Victim's Bill of
Rights" initiative will pass in Decem
ber. The initiative will achieve stricter
law enforcement, he said.
The initiative covers 10 points,
Curb explained. Among the areas
covered in the initiative are allow
ances for additions of five years to the
sentences of persons with prior felo
ny convictions. Temporary insanity
pleas and plea bargaining would also
be limited and the number of youths
sent to federal prisons over the Cali
fornia Youth Authority would be in
creased. The CYA releases offenders
when they reach 25 years of age.
Curb also said that if he were gov

ernor, he would appoint judges who
reflect the interests of Californians.
"Jerry Brown has appointed 650
judges who are mostly liberal," Curb
said. "These people do not stand for
what you believe in or I believe in."
Curb cited Chief Justice Rose Bird
as an example of a judge who does
not pass laws reflected by the wishes
of Californians.
"If I had it my way, I'd recall Rose
Bird," Curb said.
Curb also briefly addressed other
issues.
On Governor Brown: "I will do ev
erything in my power to make sure
he is not elected to the United States
Senate."
On the Peripheral Canal issue: "I
. .. am not supporting it. . .We don't
need it at the present time and we
can't afford it. It's not responsible
from a fiscal point of view."
On illegal aliens: "We have to give
our own people the incentive to
work. Until then we will have illegal
aliens here." (Curb said able-bodied
Americans find it's easier to be on
welfare than work, which makes it
easier for illegal aliens to get jobs.)
On Diablo Canyon: "We can't do
without it to get the energy needed.
