## Abortion defies certain resolution 
### 
When columnist Ellen Goodman
criticized the U.S. Supreme Court for
ruling that no woman has a constitu
tional right to an abortion at public
expense, she wrote that her mail
"was replete with pictures of pickled
fetuses, dire warnings of hellfire, and
suggestions that the world would be
a better place if my mother had
aborted me."
The issue of abortion is a painful
one. It provokes anger and outrage
because it touches the most sensitive
nerve ends.
Much of the recent debate has
been over the banning of public
funds for abortions, but the truth is
that it is about much more than that.
It is about rights — the right to life,
the right of a woman to decide

whether to terminate her pregnancy
(which the Supreme Court affirmed
in Roe vs. Wade), the rights of the in
dividual (including children), the
rights of the majority, the rights of
the minority, the rights of society and
(as someone completed the list) the
right to be wrong.
It is also one of those issues that is
argued with intense emotion in
terms of its ultimate morality or im
morality. After all, an abortion in
volves the destruction of "a firm of
human life — life in utero, but life
nonetheless."
The Supreme Court did not rule on
the exact moment that life occurs or
when the fetus "becomes human."
How could it? The scientists and doc
tors have been unable to settle these
questions among themselves be
cause abortion is rarely just a techni
cal procedure. There are too many
other considerations that go beyond
the bounds of scientific knowledge.
The Supreme Court simply said
that abortion in the early stages of
pregnancy "should be a medical, not
a criminal matter, and that the
judgment should be left to the wom
an and her doctor." In short, it sent
the question back to the privacy of
individual conscience. But the
Court's decision did not resolve the
"warring moralities." The moral
dilemma still remains.
But what kind of morality is it that
allows and encourages the anti-abor
tionists to impose their views and be
liefs on those who hold other convic
tions?
If one listened only to the anti
abortionists, one might never know
that a substantial 60-37 percent ma
jority of Americans supports the
Court's decision legalizing abortions
during the first three months of preg
nancy.
If such a decisive majority favors le
galized abortions, why are the anti
abortion forces gaining ground polit

ically?
The answer is not hard to find. The
anti-abortionists are a passionate, or
ganized, one-issue minority with po
litical clout. They have adopted the
same tactic used so effectively by the
left in the 1960s and 1970s when it
portrayed the war in Vietnam as a
struggle between "right" and
"wrong," between those who were
moral and those vho were immoral.
The anti-aboi onists, with their
own unbending devotio? to "truth"
and "right principle," iash out at
their enemies who, very simply, are
those who do not think the way they
do. When they are asked (by Loi'is
Harris) what they would do if a can
didate for political office who stood
for most of the things they believe in
took a stand on abortion they dis
agreed with, most of them said they
would make their vote dependent on
this single issue and vote against the
candidate. Anyone who betrays the
fundamental truth will be punished.
Truth cannot be compromised.
The real danger of the anti-abor
tionists is not that they oppose abor
tion. Far more disturbing is that, like
many others who regard themselves
as morally right and superior, they
seek refuge in the creation of a rigid,
"either-or" world, a world where
there are no grays — only black or
white, good or bad.
People who view abortion simply
as an unending struggle between
good and evil need not be con
cerned with accommodating a plu
rality of values or a diversity of in
terests. Convinced that they possess
the inviolable truth, they stand apart
from those who look upon demo
cratic politics not as a passion for
certitude, but as a creative process of'
peaceful and practical reconciliation.
