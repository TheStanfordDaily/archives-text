## New oil drilling lease plan debated 
### Doug Burman 
On Oct. 9, the Oversight and Investiga
tionssubcommitteeof the House Commit
tee on Interior and Insular Affairs held a
field hearing in San Francisco to discuss the
impacts of oil drilling on California's outer
continental shelf (OCS).
Testimony from government, environ
mental, and industry representatives
focused on proposed Lease Sale 73, which
includes tracts of off Marin, San Francisco,
Santa Cruz, Big Sur, and Mendocino coasts
and is scheduled for January 1983. Interior
Secretary James Watt's proposed ac
celerated five-year leasing plan was also
hotly debated.
Michael Fischer, executive director of
the California Coastal Commission,
pointed out that many of the areas in Lease
Sale 73 are adjacent to the four con
troversial basins in Lease Sale 53, and that
the same arguments for exempting these
central and northern California tracts hold
for the new sale.
"The benefits derived from leasing these
areas are outweighed by the potential
damage to the economics and environ
ment of the north coast," said Fischer.
"What was the point of spending federal,
state, and local governments' time and
money to carefully analyze the impacts of
OCS development in an area, only to have
Mr. Watt brush aside these conclusions?"
he asked.
Last spring, Watt had reinstated the four
basins deleted by his predecessor, Cecil
Andrus, from Lease Sale 53, but was forced
to remove them this summer after the state
of California, led by Governor Jerry
Brown, filed and won a lawsuit charging
that Watt had failed to follow the require
ments of the Coastal Zone Management
Act.
However, Watt has indicated that he
would like to put these same tracts up for
bidding in Lease Sale 73. Trent Orr, an at
torney with the Natural Resources De
fense Council, argued that such an in
clusion would be illegal under the rules of
the current five-year leasing plan, but
added that "the recent history of OCS ac
tivities has shown that the Secretary is
none too reluctant to violate the law when
it suits his purpose."

Tracts in the Point Reyes and Channel Is
lands marine sanctuaries may also be of
fered in the new sale, reflecting the Ad
ministration's current suspension of oil
drilling prohibitions in such sanctuaries.
Watt has recently proposed hisown five
year OCS plan to replace the one prepared
by Andrus. According to John Fields, the
acting manager of the Pacific OCS office in
the Bureau of Land Management, Watt's
plan would "streamline" the leasing proc
ess by reducing the comment period

before a proposed notice of sale and by of
fering broad areas all at once rather than
packages of scattered tracts.
Streamlining will simplify the leasing
process and result in "a considerable time
and dollars savings for the government,"
said Fields.The new plan will also substan
tially increase the total amount of acreage
offered for leasing, from a total of 15 mil
lion acres at a rate of 1.5-3 million acres per
year under the Andrus plan, to nearly 1
billion acres offered at a rate of 200 million
acres per year.

"It is neither feasible nor necessary to
have a precise understanding of all the
possible environmental risksand multiple
use conflicts of the entire process prior to a
lease offering, primarily because the loca
tion and quantity of oil and gas is not
known," Fields said.
But Rep. John Burton (D-San Francisco)
strongly criticized the new plan, pointing
out that a recent court decision held that
the Andrus plan was deficient in address
ing local impacts on specific areas as re
quired by federal law. To pursue a plan

'The recent history of
Outer Continental
Shelf activities has
shown that
theSecretary is none
too reluctant to
violate the law when
it suits his
purpose.' â€” Trent
Orr, attorney for
Natural Resources
Defense Council

even more full of generalities "is com
pletely illogical," Burton said, and is un
likely to stand up in court.
Arthur Spaulding, the vice-president
and general manager of the Western Oil
and Gas Association, testified that despite
large leasing areas, commercially de
veloped fields "will involve only a few lo
calized areas along the entire coastline."
Attempts to block central and northern
California tracts from the leasing process,
he said, "represent a serious imbalance be
tween the need for energy development
and environmental protection."
"Worldwide, the offshore provides 22
percent of current oil production, but only
13 percent of the U.S. current production
is offshore. That significant lag continues
to expose the U.S. to the threat of oil em
bargoes by foreign governments, ex
cessive foreign payments, the export of
jobs, and further debasement of the
dollar," Spaulding said.
Santa Cruz County Supervisor Gary Pat
ton countered this, saying that "our na
tional energy problem relates not to our
inability to produce petroleum resources
appropriately, but to our inordinate con
sumption of those resources." He stated
that coastal communities would be willing
to "provide" an equal amount of energy
through conservation measures in order to
avoid oil development that threatens a $12
billion local fishing and tourism industry.
Patton also attacked Watt's five-year
plan as a stepchild of the oil industry,
claiming that a report submitted in May
1981 by the American Association of Petro
leum Geologists "urged almost word for
word" what Watt has proposed.
