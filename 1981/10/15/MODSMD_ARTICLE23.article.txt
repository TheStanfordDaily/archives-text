# Bair Island: realty or refuge

The battle lines are drawn for what could
become a lengthy struggle between a sub
sidiary of Mobil Oil Company and local en
vironmental groups over the fate of Bair Is
land, a 2000-acre area of marshlands and
abandoned salt ponds located east of High
way 101 in Redwood City.
Redwood Shores, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Mobil Oil) acquired the island in 1973 but has
been waiting until land reclamation became
economically feasible, said Jack Masciarelli, a
spokesman for the firm. The company recent
ly proposed an amendment to the Redwood
City General Plan, which is the first legal step
in a development process that at the earliest
will be completed in 1993.
Redwood Shores, which will prepare the
site and then contract with other developers
for the actual building construction, pro
poses to create 3723 housing units and 12,900
jobs on the Bair Island site, including single
family dwellings, townhouses, apartments, a
hotel, shopping center, marina, and other
structures.
"Wearevery much in control of whattypes
of housing end up on the land," said
Masciarelli."But there's a lot of conflict com
ing from what we call the bird people."
Malka Kopell, conservation director for the
Palo-Alto based Penninsula Conservation
Center (PCC), called the area "the largest
spawning ground for birds in the South Bay."
Several endangered species, including the
least tern and the clapper rail, nest on the
isolated northern portion of the island con
tained in the South San Francisco Bay Na
tional Wildlife Refuge. The area is also a pri
mary breeding site for local populations of
black-crowned and great blue heron, Cas
pian tern, snowy egret, and many other spec
ies of Bay Area waterfowl.
Masciarelli pointed out that they plan to
develop less than one-third of Bair Island,

and that the sensitive nesting regions are
slated to be left alone. But biologist Mike
Rigney, research director of the South Bay In
stitute of Avian Studies, said "the threat in
volves having such a large human population
in proximity to a previously isolated colony."
Although the human inhabitants of the
new development might not pose a direct
threat to the birds, he explained, the dogs,
cats, and rats that inevitably follow human ex
pansion would. Such predators could easily
cross channels and wipe out nests which, due
to the low vegetation of the area, are located
on or near the ground.
The breeding areas must continue to be
isolated from people if the populations are to
remain stable, said Rigney. "If we destroy Bair
Island, we're removing a lot of a very special
ized habitat that isn't all that common any
more all at once."
Kopell is coordinating a Redwood City
Shoreline Coalition that is currently cam
paigning to educate residents about the mul
ti-faceted effects of this development. They
are conducting phone-a-thons, distributing
information packets, and taking people out
to the island in flat-bottomed boats.
The coalition is also pressuring the
Redwood City Council to make the environ
mental impact report (EIR) for the develop
ment plan more widely available to citizens.
"It's very hard to get hold of it right now,"
said Kopell.
The coalition is not only worried about the
ecological effects of the development. Other
concerns are the increase in traffic conges
tion along Whipple Avenue and Highway
101, and land subsidence problems.
The Redwood City Council will hold a pub
lic hearing in November to decide whether to
grant Redwood Shores a development per
mit. Though state and federal permits will
eventually be required as well, both sides are
preparing for a showdown.
