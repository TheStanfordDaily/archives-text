# Air standards up for grabs
## 
### Melanie Julian 
Millions consider the South
Bay, with its rugged hills and
dependable sunshine, a de
sirable place to live, work, or
even go to school. But the pic
turesque hiUs trap pollutants
and the warm sunshine drives
chemical reactions which
create smog, so that a thick
brownish haze seems to de
velop daily over this otherwise
enviable environment.
The South Bay becomes a
dump for the airborn garbage
of the second largest popu
lation center in the state. With
topography and population as
givens, improvement of air
quality can only occur by re
ducing emissions per polluter.
The Bay Area Air Quality
Management District has been
accomplishing this task since
it set up shop ten years ago.
But the legislation that made it
possible, the 1970 Clean Air
Act, is up for reauthorization in
1982, and already promises to
become one of the biggest en

vironmental battles of the dec
ade.
Ozone is the chief compo
nent in photochemical smog
and one of the two pollutants
for which the Bay Area violates
national health standards.
Carbon monoxide, an invisible
gas which is primarily emitted
by automobiles, is the second.
Both violations occur in the
Santa Clara/San Jose valley. All
other places in the Bay Area are
largely in compliance with the
Act, whereas in 1969 dangerous
ozone levels appeared
throughout the air basin.
The years of research, plan
ning, monitoring, and enforce
ment mandated by the Clean
Air Act are responsible for this.
An entire industry has sprung
up to provide monitoring
equipment and pollution con
trol technology. However, of
ficials warn that continued ef
fort is needed to add the South
Bay to the list of compliance
areas.
The sides have already

begun to squareoff. A National
Clean Air Coalition, comprised
of 19 environmental, labor, and
health organizations, cites
opinion polls that show an ov
erwhelming (86 percent} pub-
Vic support for the same or
stronger Clean Air Act.
However, the industries
most affected by the regu
lations claim that "streamlin
ing" of the Act is an economic
necessity, and that the law of
diminishing returns makes cur
rent emission standards un
reasonably expensive.
Several bills have been in
troduced into both Houses
which alter various parts of the
Act, but most people are hold
ing their breath until the Rea
gan administration makes pub
lic its proposals for air quality
control.
So far, the EPA draft pro
posals leaked to congressmen
have produced controlled pan
ic among environmentalists.
