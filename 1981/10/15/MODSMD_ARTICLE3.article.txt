# Two top law schools asking recruiters to help pay costs
## 
### Cici Oremland 
Although financially strapped
times have forced two prominent law
schools to request contributions
from visiting recruiting firms to help
defray costs of on-campus advertis
ing and interview procedures, there
are no plans to do the same here, the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter (CPPC) reports.
Boalt Hall, UC-Berkeley's law
school, and the Columbia University
School of Law, now ask firms wishing
to recruit on their campuses for
donations to finance their placement
centers, according to a recent report
in The New York Times. Universities
and colleges have in the past offered
placement center services free to re
cruiting firms.
Stanford's law school does not plan
to implement such a policy in the
near future. Nor are there such plans
currently under consideration at the
business school or at the Career Plan

ning and Placement Center (CPPC).
The CPPC recently considered ask
ing firms that hold on-campus re
cruitment for donations to offset ad
vertisement costs only, but decided
not to implement the suggestion.
"The amount (of money) dona
tions would actually generate would
not have a significant enough impact
on our budget (to warrant im
plementation)," said Melinda
Kaewert, superintendent of re
cruitment activities.
According to Kaewert, the CPPC
considered asking for donations be
cause of rising costs of the advertising
services the center renders for com
pany representatives.
She said the suggestion was also re
jected because the CPPC did not
want firms that recruit here to feel
obliged to subsidize Stanford student
offices.
TheCPPC does charge firmsslsoto
participate in the annual Job Faire

held last week. The fee covers the ad
ditional publicity and rentalscostsfor
the event.
Boalt began its donation policy last
fall, asking firms for donations of
around $150 to defray costs of the re
cruitment process and to upgrade
the office computer. About 35 per
cent of the aproximately 600 firms
that recruit at Boalt made the re
quested donations, netting the office
over $30,000.
"We operate on a shoestring
budget without the funding many
other public university offices have,"
said Susan Kishi, Boalt placement
center's assistant director.
She said the center is funded
through endowment that the staff
feels is better spent in other areas,
such as in library donations and im
provements.
No other placement center at Cal is
asking for donations from firms wish
ing to recruit on-campus at this time.
