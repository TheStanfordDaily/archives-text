## Movies/Steve Vineberg Women without men, or direction 
### 
Both Raggedy Man and Heartland are
dominated by women who, in the after
math of marriages, have learned to cul
tivate reserves of strength and raise father
less children. Anita (Sissy Spacek) in Rag
gedy Man divorced her unfaithful hus
band and now, in a small Texas town in the
last years of the Second World War, she is
stuck in a job she detests — as a telephone
operator — because her boss, claiming
that wartime constraints necessitate the
freezing of positions in the phone com
pany, refuses to even recommend her for a
transfer. She struggles to retain her privacy
and dignity among petty gossips and leer
ing men who assume that, being a
divorcee, she is promiscuous. The pro
tagonist of Heartland, Elinore Randall
(Conchata Ferrell), brings her young
daughterto live with heronafarmin Burnt
Fork, Wyoming in 1910, where she has
signed on as housekeeper for gruff,
laconic Clyde Stewart. Elinore has to sur
vive the harsh, pitiless winter, and more
than that, to establish permanent resi
dence in Burnt Fork so that she will be able
to own land there. Though Raggedy Man
was made by men (Jack Fisk directed from
a script by William Witliff) and Heartland
by a team of men and women (Beth Ferris
and Bill Kittredge co-authored it, Richard
Pearce directed it, and it is distributed by
an organization called Wilderness Wom
en), the two movies share a feminist vision,
which is rare in American movies. If we
judged movies solely on their intentions,
we might heap praises on these pictures,
which are both directorial debuts; but, as
Pauline Kael once pointed out, filmmakers
are not politicians, and so we have to look
further than their platforms: both Raggedy
Man and Heartland are dull and inert.
Part of the problem here may lie, iron
ically, in the noble intentions of the people
who evolved these films. The two heroines
seem to have been created by concerned
adults as non-sexist models for their chil
dren, not as fully fleshed out women, and
both actresses conform to the restraints of
the writing. This is particularly dismaying if
one has seen Sissy Spacek and Conchata
Ferrell in other roles that unleashed the
quirkier sides of their talents. On stage,
Ferrell uses her big frame for power, like

Colleen Dewhurst: in Lanford Wilson's
The Hot L Baltimore in 1972, playing a
whore, she straddled a chair in the hotel
lobby in the first act and seized the show
by force. In Heartland, she doesn't use her
weight to any purpose; she holds back, as
if the movie would collapse if she applied
pressure. It probably would, but thijj/vom
an could build a real story of feminine
strength and heroism out of the ruins. In
stead, her performance is limited pretty
much to looks of determination and op
timism. She has one fine scene — when she
finally marries Stewart (Rip Torn, strait
jacketed by a beard and a brogue), she
buries her terror in domestic fussiness and
embarrassed laughter — but there isn't
much percentage in a role so thinly con
ceived.
Spacek's chameleon quality has been
both an asset and a liability: when she gets
hold of a meaty part (as in Carrie and 3
Women) she is wonderful, but she tends to
fade out when she plays uninteresting
characters. That may explain why her per
formance in Coal Miner's Daughter
stopped growing in the middle of the mov
ie, when the script began to fall apart and
what had been an unusual, evocative dra
ma slipped into soap opera. There's noth
ing wrong with her acting in Raggedy Man
— but there's nothing to carry away from
it, either, except for one speech in which
she gives expression to her frustration at
being "frozen" in her job. The scene that
Witliff evidently fashioned as her big mo
ment — when she tells her boss off and
walks out — doesn't erupt; Spacek clings
virtuously to the limits of her character and
the result isadisplay oftasteful badtemper
froma mistreated but unimaginative wom
an. Eric Roberts, who plays a sailor who
stumbles into Anita's life, acts Spacek off
the screen — and throws the movie off bal
ance, because she sends him on his way
two-thirds of the way through and we lose
interest in the rest while waiting, in vain,
for his return.
Jack Fisk served as art director for
Terence Malick on Badlands and Days of
Heaven, and though he shows an im
pressive grasp of film technique (and the

movie is well photographed by Ralf Bode),
Raggedy Man is an art director's movie —
individual shots matter more tnan whole
sequences. That's Malick's legacy. We re
tain the image of Spacek taking clothes off
a line in the dark, backlit by a kitchen lamp,
but even immediately afterward we can't
remember how the violent climax, in
which a pair of psychos terrorize Anita and
her sons, was put together. Though
Witliff's script is far from exciting, it
touches on some incendiary topics; there
is a southern Gothic sensibility at work in
the treatment of the town's mysterious fig
ure, the Raggedy Man (Sam Shepard), and
the way in which the two men who want to
get at Anita use her children to do so. Fisk
seems to be responsible for defanging the
menace in this movie and making it homey
and benign, as if he were directing To Kill a
Mockingbird (to which Witliff's story bears
a distinct resemblance in the later scenes).
Only William Sanderson's scary portrayal
of Calvin, the more potent of the two
lechers — when Anita refuses his initial ad
vances, he has the haunted look of a man
badly scarred, for whom each fresh rejec
tion recalls former pain — suggests what
the movie might have been if Fisk had
plunged into the darker recesses of the
material.
At least Raggedy Man is craftsmanlike;
Heartland looks awfully drab. We're sup
posed to be moved by the elemental
strength of women like Elinore and rugged
Grandmother Landauer (Lilia Skala, whose
lifetime of travelling around Wyoming
hasn't cut through her eastern European
accent), and by the consolation these sur
vivors provide for each other. But it's hard
to feel anything when director Pearce
trains his camera, over and over again, on
the pouring of coffee and the stirring of
soup. It's a parched, meager film with
about as much passion for its characters as
the documentaries we were shown in
school that tried to teach us to admire the
pioneers. The script is really a reworked
antique — it goes back to Lillian Gish in
The Wind — but someone might have
salvaged it. Heartland's pedantic approach
to the struggles of women without men —
and Raggedy Man's sentimental approach
— serve to trivialize the issue.

Jack Fisk served as art director for
Terence Malick on Badlands and Days of
Heaven, and though he shows an im
pressive grasp of film technique (and the

movie is well photographed by Ralf Bode),
Raggedy Man is an art director's movie —
individual shots matter more tnan whole
sequences. That's Malick's legacy. We re
tain the image of Spacek taking clothes off
a line in the dark, backlit by a kitchen lamp,
but even immediately afterward we can't
remember how the violent climax, in
which a pair of psychos terrorize Anita and
her sons, was put together. Though
Witliff's script is far from exciting, it
touches on some incendiary topics; there
is a southern Gothic sensibility at work in
the treatment of the town's mysterious fig
ure, the Raggedy Man (Sam Shepard), and
the way in which the two men who want to
get at Anita use her children to do so. Fisk
seems to be responsible for defanging the
menace in this movie and making it homey
and benign, as if he were directing To Kill a
Mockingbird (to which Witliff's story bears
a distinct resemblance in the later scenes).
Only William Sanderson's scary portrayal
of Calvin, the more potent of the two
lechers — when Anita refuses his initial ad
vances, he has the haunted look of a man
badly scarred, for whom each fresh rejec
tion recalls former pain — suggests what
the movie might have been if Fisk had
plunged into the darker recesses of the
material.
At least Raggedy Man is craftsmanlike;
Heartland looks awfully drab. We're sup
posed to be moved by the elemental
strength of women like Elinore and rugged
Grandmother Landauer (Lilia Skala, whose
lifetime of travelling around Wyoming
hasn't cut through her eastern European
accent), and by the consolation these sur
vivors provide for each other. But it's hard
to feel anything when director Pearce
trains his camera, over and over again, on
the pouring of coffee and the stirring of
soup. It's a parched, meager film with
about as much passion for its characters as
the documentaries we were shown in
school that tried to teach us to admire the
pioneers. The script is really a reworked
antique — it goes back to Lillian Gish in
The Wind — but someone might have
salvaged it. Heartland's pedantic approach
to the struggles of women without men —
and Raggedy Man's sentimental approach
— serve to trivialize the issue.


Conchata Ferrell and Rip Torn in Heartland
Both Raggedy Man and Heartland are
dominated by women who, in the after
math of marriages, have learned to cul
tivate reserves of strength and raise father
less children. Anita (Sissy Spacek) in Rag
gedy Man divorced her unfaithful hus
band and now, in a small Texas town in the
last years of the Second World War, she is
stuck in a job she detests — as a telephone
operator — because her boss, claiming
that wartime constraints necessitate the
freezing of positions in the phone com
pany, refuses to even recommend her for a
transfer. She struggles to retain her privacy
and dignity among petty gossips and leer
ing men who assume that, being a
divorcee, she is promiscuous. The pro
tagonist of Heartland, Elinore Randall
(Conchata Ferrell), brings her young
daughterto live with heronafarmin Burnt
Fork, Wyoming in 1910, where she has
signed on as housekeeper for gruff,
laconic Clyde Stewart. Elinore has to sur
vive the harsh, pitiless winter, and more
than that, to establish permanent resi
dence in Burnt Fork so that she will be able
to own land there. Though Raggedy Man
was made by men (Jack Fisk directed from
a script by William Witliff) and Heartland
by a team of men and women (Beth Ferris
and Bill Kittredge co-authored it, Richard
Pearce directed it, and it is distributed by
an organization called Wilderness Wom
en), the two movies share a feminist vision,
which is rare in American movies. If we
judged movies solely on their intentions,
we might heap praises on these pictures,
which are both directorial debuts; but, as
Pauline Kael once pointed out, filmmakers
are not politicians, and so we have to look
further than their platforms: both Raggedy
Man and Heartland are dull and inert.
Part of the problem here may lie, iron
ically, in the noble intentions of the people
who evolved these films. The two heroines
seem to have been created by concerned
adults as non-sexist models for their chil
dren, not as fully fleshed out women, and
both actresses conform to the restraints of
the writing. This is particularly dismaying if
one has seen Sissy Spacek and Conchata
Ferrell in other roles that unleashed the
quirkier sides of their talents. On stage,
Ferrell uses her big frame for power, like

Colleen Dewhurst: in Lanford Wilson's
The Hot L Baltimore in 1972, playing a
whore, she straddled a chair in the hotel
lobby in the first act and seized the show
by force. In Heartland, she doesn't use her
weight to any purpose; she holds back, as
if the movie would collapse if she applied
pressure. It probably would, but thijj/vom
an could build a real story of feminine
strength and heroism out of the ruins. In
stead, her performance is limited pretty
much to looks of determination and op
timism. She has one fine scene — when she
finally marries Stewart (Rip Torn, strait
jacketed by a beard and a brogue), she
buries her terror in domestic fussiness and
embarrassed laughter — but there isn't
much percentage in a role so thinly con
ceived.
Spacek's chameleon quality has been
both an asset and a liability: when she gets
hold of a meaty part (as in Carrie and 3
Women) she is wonderful, but she tends to
fade out when she plays uninteresting
characters. That may explain why her per
formance in Coal Miner's Daughter
stopped growing in the middle of the mov
ie, when the script began to fall apart and
what had been an unusual, evocative dra
ma slipped into soap opera. There's noth
ing wrong with her acting in Raggedy Man
— but there's nothing to carry away from
it, either, except for one speech in which
she gives expression to her frustration at
being "frozen" in her job. The scene that
Witliff evidently fashioned as her big mo
ment — when she tells her boss off and
walks out — doesn't erupt; Spacek clings
virtuously to the limits of her character and
the result isadisplay oftasteful badtemper
froma mistreated but unimaginative wom
an. Eric Roberts, who plays a sailor who
stumbles into Anita's life, acts Spacek off
the screen — and throws the movie off bal
ance, because she sends him on his way
two-thirds of the way through and we lose
interest in the rest while waiting, in vain,
for his return.

adults as non-sexist models for their chil
dren, not as fully fleshed out women, and
both actresses conform to the restraints of
the writing. This is particularly dismaying if
one has seen Sissy Spacek and Conchata
Ferrell in other roles that unleashed the
quirkier sides of their talents. On stage,
Ferrell uses her big frame for power, like

Colleen Dewhurst: in Lanford Wilson's
The Hot L Baltimore in 1972, playing a
whore, she straddled a chair in the hotel
lobby in the first act and seized the show
by force. In Heartland, she doesn't use her
weight to any purpose; she holds back, as
if the movie would collapse if she applied
pressure. It probably would, but thijj/vom
an could build a real story of feminine
strength and heroism out of the ruins. In
stead, her performance is limited pretty
much to looks of determination and op
timism. She has one fine scene — when she
finally marries Stewart (Rip Torn, strait
jacketed by a beard and a brogue), she
buries her terror in domestic fussiness and
embarrassed laughter — but there isn't
much percentage in a role so thinly con
ceived.
Spacek's chameleon quality has been
both an asset and a liability: when she gets
hold of a meaty part (as in Carrie and 3
Women) she is wonderful, but she tends to
fade out when she plays uninteresting
characters. That may explain why her per
formance in Coal Miner's Daughter
stopped growing in the middle of the mov
ie, when the script began to fall apart and
what had been an unusual, evocative dra
ma slipped into soap opera. There's noth
ing wrong with her acting in Raggedy Man
— but there's nothing to carry away from
it, either, except for one speech in which
she gives expression to her frustration at
being "frozen" in her job. The scene that
Witliff evidently fashioned as her big mo
ment — when she tells her boss off and
walks out — doesn't erupt; Spacek clings
virtuously to the limits of her character and
the result isadisplay oftasteful badtemper
froma mistreated but unimaginative wom
an. Eric Roberts, who plays a sailor who
stumbles into Anita's life, acts Spacek off
the screen — and throws the movie off bal
ance, because she sends him on his way
two-thirds of the way through and we lose
interest in the rest while waiting, in vain,
for his return.
Jack Fisk served as art director for
Terence Malick on Badlands and Days of
Heaven, and though he shows an im
pressive grasp of film technique (and the

movie is well photographed by Ralf Bode),
Raggedy Man is an art director's movie —
individual shots matter more tnan whole
sequences. That's Malick's legacy. We re
tain the image of Spacek taking clothes off
a line in the dark, backlit by a kitchen lamp,
but even immediately afterward we can't
remember how the violent climax, in
which a pair of psychos terrorize Anita and
her sons, was put together. Though
Witliff's script is far from exciting, it
touches on some incendiary topics; there
is a southern Gothic sensibility at work in
the treatment of the town's mysterious fig
ure, the Raggedy Man (Sam Shepard), and
the way in which the two men who want to
get at Anita use her children to do so. Fisk
seems to be responsible for defanging the
menace in this movie and making it homey
and benign, as if he were directing To Kill a
Mockingbird (to which Witliff's story bears
a distinct resemblance in the later scenes).
Only William Sanderson's scary portrayal
of Calvin, the more potent of the two
lechers — when Anita refuses his initial ad
vances, he has the haunted look of a man
badly scarred, for whom each fresh rejec
tion recalls former pain — suggests what
the movie might have been if Fisk had
plunged into the darker recesses of the
material.
At least Raggedy Man is craftsmanlike;
Heartland looks awfully drab. We're sup
posed to be moved by the elemental
strength of women like Elinore and rugged
Grandmother Landauer (Lilia Skala, whose
lifetime of travelling around Wyoming
hasn't cut through her eastern European
accent), and by the consolation these sur
vivors provide for each other. But it's hard
to feel anything when director Pearce
trains his camera, over and over again, on
the pouring of coffee and the stirring of
soup. It's a parched, meager film with
about as much passion for its characters as
the documentaries we were shown in
school that tried to teach us to admire the
pioneers. The script is really a reworked
antique — it goes back to Lillian Gish in
The Wind — but someone might have
salvaged it. Heartland's pedantic approach
to the struggles of women without men —
and Raggedy Man's sentimental approach
— serve to trivialize the issue.
