# George can play that there guitar

### Trey Ellis 
George Benson and Sadao
Watanabe are as different as
two greats can be. Both
Benson's guitar and Watanbe's
sax shoot out some of the best
sounds in modern jazz; but
Watanabe is a performer,
Benson a showman.
Watanabe is not your aver
age sax player. Though dressed
in the traditional saxman's
white shoes with stylish narrow
laces, tailored pants, narrow tie
and, of course, sleeves rolled
up to the middle of the fore
arm, Watanabe is the only
Japanese sax player I have ever
seen. His hair is slicked back
and receding, and his face
shows the many wrinkles of
middle age. To a capacity Cir
cle Star crowd, his accent was
thick and completely incom
prehensible.
Like BBs bouncing off a steel
plate, Watanabe shoots note
after note, clear and sharp and
fast. His eyes are scrunched
shut, and his face is fused
around the mouthpiece.
Sometimes stooping over, at
other times reeling back, he
clutches the saxophone as if it
were sucking away his breath.
Watanabe's guitarist is also

impressive. Bobby Bruin is just
as intense as Watanabe, and
only a few steps off the caliber
of Benson's playing. Given
room to improvise, his many
solos almost stole the show and
received roaring applause, sec
ond only to Watanabe's.
The band played smoothly
and crisply, flowing from solo
to group jam to solo with pro
fessional ease. No pretension
and no hype marred their per
formance. My only complaint
has to do with the theater itself.
Although the acoustics in the
Circle Star are good,
Watanabe's intimate style real
ly cries out for a smaller club.
Still, it wasn't the Cow Palace.
But Benson needs all the
room he can get. His style is
showy and polished and is
perfect for the large dinner
theater. After a 20-minute wait
between warm-up and head
liner, Benson's bandconfident
ly jogged down the aisle and
hopped upon stage. They were
all happy and smiling, warming
up a bit and joking with each
other. Then the announcer
said, "Ladies and gentlemen,
the Circle Star Theatre is proud
to present Mr. George


George Benson
