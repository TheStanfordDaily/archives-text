# George can play that there guitar
## 
### Trey Ellis 
George Benson and Sadao
Watanabe are as different as
two greats can be. Both
Benson's guitar and Watanbe's
sax shoot out some of the best
sounds in modern jazz; but
Watanabe is a performer,
Benson a showman.
Watanabe is not your aver
age sax player. Though dressed
in the traditional saxman's
white shoes with stylish narrow
laces, tailored pants, narrow tie
and, of course, sleeves rolled
up to the middle of the fore
arm, Watanabe is the only
Japanese sax player I have ever
seen. His hair is slicked back
and receding, and his face
shows the many wrinkles of
middle age. To a capacity Cir
cle Star crowd, his accent was
thick and completely incom
prehensible.
Like BBs bouncing off a steel
plate, Watanabe shoots note
after note, clear and sharp and
fast. His eyes are scrunched
shut, and his face is fused
around the mouthpiece.
Sometimes stooping over, at
other times reeling back, he
clutches the saxophone as if it
were sucking away his breath.
Watanabe's guitarist is also

impressive. Bobby Bruin is just
as intense as Watanabe, and
only a few steps off the caliber
of Benson's playing. Given
room to improvise, his many
solos almost stole the show and
received roaring applause, sec
ond only to Watanabe's.
The band played smoothly
and crisply, flowing from solo
to group jam to solo with pro
fessional ease. No pretension
and no hype marred their per
formance. My only complaint
has to do with the theater itself.
Although the acoustics in the
Circle Star are good,
Watanabe's intimate style real
ly cries out for a smaller club.
Still, it wasn't the Cow Palace.
But Benson needs all the
room he can get. His style is
showy and polished and is
perfect for the large dinner
theater. After a 20-minute wait
between warm-up and head
liner, Benson's bandconfident
ly jogged down the aisle and
hopped upon stage. They were
all happy and smiling, warming
up a bit and joking with each
other. Then the announcer
said, "Ladies and gentlemen,
the Circle Star Theatre is proud
to present Mr. George


George Benson
Benson!" Of course, everyone
went wild, wheeling around in
their seats to see his entrance.
One mighty white spot zapped
Benson and followed him
down the aisle as he slowly
strutted. He shook the hands of
some of the people on the
aisles, obviously pleased with
his reception. Jumping up on
stage, he donned his guitar and
immediately started in.
No singing at first, just his in
humanly quick fingers dancing
over the neck and body of the
guitar like two fiddler crabs on
speed. No shit.
Shaking his pelvis and hop
ping from foot to foot, Benson
didn't even seem to concen
trate as the notes flew out. He
laughed and looked around,
had a good time, as his fingers
did all the work.
Then he began singing. Start
ing out with his version of

"Here Comes the Sun,"
Benson displayed a sweet,
high, breathy voice seldom
heard on his records. Next
came "Star of the Story" and
"What's on Your Mind," where
he gave us simultaneous scat
singing and guitar playing,
But in one of the best songs
of the evening, "Moody's
Mood," Benson brought out
his percussionist, Vicki Randle,
to accompany him. Sweet and
soulful, she was a real surprise.
They workedtogether beau
tifully, gazing into each others'
eyes with such affection that
the audience cooed and sighed
its approval.
Ending with "This Mas
querade," "Give Me the
Night," and a few more pelvic
thrusts, he completely con
trolled the crowd, making
thousands of people sway from
side to side. And of course
there was a standing ovation

and, of course, there was an
encore.
Everyone knew exactly what
he was going to play but we still
roared when those famous first
chords of the Drifters' "On
Broadway" sprang from his
guitar. Many people through
out the theater jumped back to
their feet and clapped their
hands over their heads. But the
cheering really went wild (of
course) when Benson wailed,
"But they're all wrong, I know
they are/'Cause I can play this
here guitar!" And if for some
reason you didn't know that
this was the time to cheer, the
bright red spot on him should
have given you a clue.
The refrain from"The
Greatest Love of All," sums up
George Benson's apparent phi
losophy: "No matter what they
say to me/They can't take away
my dignity. . .To love yourself
is the greatest love of all."

some of the people on the
aisles, obviously pleased with
his reception. Jumping up on
stage, he donned his guitar and
immediately started in.
No singing at first, just his in
humanly quick fingers dancing
over the neck and body of the
guitar like two fiddler crabs on
speed. No shit.
Shaking his pelvis and hop
ping from foot to foot, Benson
didn't even seem to concen
trate as the notes flew out. He
laughed and looked around,
had a good time, as his fingers
did all the work.
Then he began singing. Start
ing out with his version of

"Here Comes the Sun,"
Benson displayed a sweet,
high, breathy voice seldom
heard on his records. Next
came "Star of the Story" and
"What's on Your Mind," where
he gave us simultaneous scat
singing and guitar playing,
But in one of the best songs
of the evening, "Moody's
Mood," Benson brought out
his percussionist, Vicki Randle,
to accompany him. Sweet and
soulful, she was a real surprise.
They workedtogether beau
tifully, gazing into each others'
eyes with such affection that
the audience cooed and sighed
its approval.
Ending with "This Mas
querade," "Give Me the
Night," and a few more pelvic
thrusts, he completely con
trolled the crowd, making
thousands of people sway from
side to side. And of course
there was a standing ovation

and, of course, there was an
encore.
Everyone knew exactly what
he was going to play but we still
roared when those famous first
chords of the Drifters' "On
Broadway" sprang from his
guitar. Many people through
out the theater jumped back to
their feet and clapped their
hands over their heads. But the
cheering really went wild (of
course) when Benson wailed,
"But they're all wrong, I know
they are/'Cause I can play this
here guitar!" And if for some
reason you didn't know that
this was the time to cheer, the
bright red spot on him should
have given you a clue.
The refrain from"The
Greatest Love of All," sums up
George Benson's apparent phi
losophy: "No matter what they
say to me/They can't take away
my dignity. . .To love yourself
is the greatest love of all."
George Benson and Sadao
Watanabe are as different as
two greats can be. Both
Benson's guitar and Watanbe's
sax shoot out some of the best
sounds in modern jazz; but
Watanabe is a performer,
Benson a showman.
Watanabe is not your aver
age sax player. Though dressed
in the traditional saxman's
white shoes with stylish narrow
laces, tailored pants, narrow tie
and, of course, sleeves rolled
up to the middle of the fore
arm, Watanabe is the only
Japanese sax player I have ever
seen. His hair is slicked back
and receding, and his face
shows the many wrinkles of
middle age. To a capacity Cir
cle Star crowd, his accent was
thick and completely incom
prehensible.
Like BBs bouncing off a steel
plate, Watanabe shoots note
after note, clear and sharp and
fast. His eyes are scrunched
shut, and his face is fused
around the mouthpiece.
Sometimes stooping over, at
other times reeling back, he
clutches the saxophone as if it
were sucking away his breath.
Watanabe's guitarist is also

impressive. Bobby Bruin is just
as intense as Watanabe, and
only a few steps off the caliber
of Benson's playing. Given
room to improvise, his many
solos almost stole the show and
received roaring applause, sec
ond only to Watanabe's.
The band played smoothly
and crisply, flowing from solo
to group jam to solo with pro
fessional ease. No pretension
and no hype marred their per
formance. My only complaint
has to do with the theater itself.
Although the acoustics in the
Circle Star are good,
Watanabe's intimate style real
ly cries out for a smaller club.
Still, it wasn't the Cow Palace.
But Benson needs all the
room he can get. His style is
showy and polished and is
perfect for the large dinner
theater. After a 20-minute wait
between warm-up and head
liner, Benson's bandconfident
ly jogged down the aisle and
hopped upon stage. They were
all happy and smiling, warming
up a bit and joking with each
other. Then the announcer
said, "Ladies and gentlemen,
the Circle Star Theatre is proud
to present Mr. George


George Benson
Benson!" Of course, everyone
went wild, wheeling around in
their seats to see his entrance.
One mighty white spot zapped
Benson and followed him
down the aisle as he slowly
strutted. He shook the hands of
some of the people on the
aisles, obviously pleased with
his reception. Jumping up on
stage, he donned his guitar and
immediately started in.
No singing at first, just his in
