# Cukor's 50-year trek
## 
### Jim Mattson 
Rich and Famous, which
opened last weekend, stars
Jacqueline Bisset and Can
dice Bergen as best friends
who don't really like each
other. The movie is usually
enjoyable; it never soars,
but it isconsistently interest
ing and always beautifully
put together. And, some
times, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only
be attributed to the direc
tor, George Cukor. Gerald
Ayres' screenplay doesn't
supply the best material he's
ever worked with — it's a
write-by-numbers script,
with the plot and dialogue

roughed in but never really
blended. Cukor's gift is for
making it seem that it's not
the plot and words that are
important, but the way
they're placed on the
screen. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's
trust in his material — the
brittle contrivances of the
Ayres script are softened by
Cukor's patience with them.
In an age where most mov
ies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gun
point for consumption by
captive audiences, it's a

treat to see a film made with
a little kindness.
In this atmosphere, it's
not really surprising that
Bisset and Bergen are both
better than they've ever
been. Bisset, playing a nov
elist suffering from writer's
block, manages to project
intelligence and vulner
ability. The movie never ex
plains where she got her ac
cent (maybe she had a Brit
ish nanny?), but she seems
to have captured an authen
tically American sense of
frustration over being si
multaneously talented and
unproductive.
Bergen's never been an

especially good actress, but
she's turning into some
thing that, given the right
treatment, is almost as in
teresting: a "personality."
She was the best thing going
for Starting Over, where she
played Burt Reynold's
screwball ex-wife who,
upon deciding that she was
a singer, damned anyone
who tried to tell her other
wise. Bergen plays another
oddball in Rich and Famous,
where she is Merry Noel, a
southern-accented, wide
faced, utterly tireless writer

of trashy novels, which she
justifies by describing as
successful trash. The "new"
Bergen (as opposed to the
old, pretty-but-boring
Bergen) seems to have stud
ied acting in Feiffer car
toons. Her Merry Noel is a
caricature of unearned suc
cess; like most good
caricatures, something
about her rings true.
The movie is set up as a
series of skirmishes be
tween the two women:
they're fighting even before
we know them. These fights,
disturbingly, are also where
the movie is at its worst. It's
as if Cukor, wanting to get
on to more interesting
things, told his actresses to
get the scenes over with as
quickly as they could —
which isn't really such a bad
explanation, seeing as
Cukor was called in after
production had already
begun as a replacement for
another director.
There's a nice moment at
the end of one of the pair's
squabbles when Bergen
stops the argument by be
ginning to play, very lustily,
on an out-of-tune piano —
it's like something out of a
Silly Symphony, where the
narrative position of oneob
ject is magically taken on by
another. A moment like this
can redeem five or six
creaky scenes, and, happily,
Rich and Famous is full of
nice moments.
As Rich and Famous is re
leased, Cukor celebrates his
fiftieth year as a film direc
tor. His credits include some
of the finest entertainments
Hollywood produced: The
Philadelphia Story, Gaslight,
the Judy Garland version of
A Star is Born, and many
others. He's now 82, the
oldest man ever to direct a
Hollywood film. He is still a
man of talent and taste.
I hope he lives forever.

faced, utterly tireless writer

of trashy novels, which she
justifies by describing as
successful trash. The "new"
Bergen (as opposed to the
old, pretty-but-boring
Bergen) seems to have stud
ied acting in Feiffer car
toons. Her Merry Noel is a
caricature of unearned suc
cess; like most good
caricatures, something
about her rings true.
The movie is set up as a
series of skirmishes be
tween the two women:
they're fighting even before
we know them. These fights,
disturbingly, are also where
the movie is at its worst. It's
as if Cukor, wanting to get
on to more interesting
things, told his actresses to
get the scenes over with as
quickly as they could —
which isn't really such a bad
explanation, seeing as
Cukor was called in after
production had already
begun as a replacement for
another director.
There's a nice moment at
the end of one of the pair's
squabbles when Bergen
stops the argument by be
ginning to play, very lustily,
on an out-of-tune piano —
it's like something out of a
Silly Symphony, where the
narrative position of oneob
ject is magically taken on by
another. A moment like this
can redeem five or six
creaky scenes, and, happily,
Rich and Famous is full of
nice moments.
As Rich and Famous is re
leased, Cukor celebrates his
fiftieth year as a film direc
tor. His credits include some
of the finest entertainments
Hollywood produced: The
Philadelphia Story, Gaslight,
the Judy Garland version of
A Star is Born, and many
others. He's now 82, the
oldest man ever to direct a
Hollywood film. He is still a
man of talent and taste.
I hope he lives forever.


(L to R) Candice Bergen, George Cukor, and Jacqueline
Bisset.
Rich and Famous, which
opened last weekend, stars
Jacqueline Bisset and Can
dice Bergen as best friends
who don't really like each
other. The movie is usually
enjoyable; it never soars,
but it isconsistently interest
ing and always beautifully
put together. And, some
times, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only
be attributed to the direc
tor, George Cukor. Gerald
Ayres' screenplay doesn't
supply the best material he's
ever worked with — it's a
write-by-numbers script,
with the plot and dialogue

roughed in but never really
blended. Cukor's gift is for
making it seem that it's not
the plot and words that are
important, but the way
they're placed on the
screen. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's
trust in his material — the
brittle contrivances of the
Ayres script are softened by
Cukor's patience with them.
In an age where most mov
ies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gun
point for consumption by
captive audiences, it's a

treat to see a film made with
a little kindness.
In this atmosphere, it's
not really surprising that
Bisset and Bergen are both
better than they've ever
been. Bisset, playing a nov
elist suffering from writer's
block, manages to project
intelligence and vulner
ability. The movie never ex
plains where she got her ac
cent (maybe she had a Brit
ish nanny?), but she seems
to have captured an authen
tically American sense of
frustration over being si
multaneously talented and
unproductive.
Bergen's never been an

especially good actress, but
she's turning into some
thing that, given the right
treatment, is almost as in
teresting: a "personality."
She was the best thing going
for Starting Over, where she
played Burt Reynold's
screwball ex-wife who,
upon deciding that she was
a singer, damned anyone
who tried to tell her other
wise. Bergen plays another
oddball in Rich and Famous,
where she is Merry Noel, a
southern-accented, wide
faced, utterly tireless writer

of trashy novels, which she
justifies by describing as
successful trash. The "new"
Bergen (as opposed to the
old, pretty-but-boring
Bergen) seems to have stud
ied acting in Feiffer car
toons. Her Merry Noel is a
