# Joel's mixed intentions
## 
### David Schmelzer 
There's a dual nature to Billy Joel's decision to
make a live album composed entirely of his mu
sic made before The Stranger was released (until
which almost nobody knew his music). On the
one side, you've got to give him credit for an in
novative idea — making a concert album
without hits. On the other, you wonder whether
this idea was as "artistic" a one as his extensive
liner notes would have you believe. This may be
coincidental, but he's managed to take a year off
from creating a new studio album and still come
out with a record that's "new" to most listeners.
Whether or not he (or his record company) took
this into account, Songs in the Attic is likely to be
more profitable than a conventional live album
would be.
Taking him at his word — essentially that he'd
always wanted to do better versions of his ob
scure material — he comes off pretty well. The
sound quality is far better than you'll find on
most live albums, which isn't surprising con
sidering it's done by super-producer Phil
Ramone. Of course, the album still rides on just
how good that obscure material is, but Billy Joel
is much too fine a writer to not be able to cull
one good record from the material of four.
One question is whether he achieves his in
tention of remaking 11 songs that sound better
live than they do "on the record." He introduces
this rationale specifically to explain his exclusion
of "Piano Man" — a curious omission consider
ing it's probably the best of the "songs in the at
tic" he's trying to represent. But then it's also the
only song that his casual fans would likely have
heard from that period, and the only one that
would keep this from being a "new album" to
them.
To give him credit where it is certainly de
served, he does succeed in making better ver
sions of several of the songs. Billy Joel is such a

captivating, energetic, stylish live performer that
it would be much more surprising if he didn't
improve any of them. He's taken "Miami 2017,"
already a very good song, and made it into a vi
brant, superb one. There's really not much more
he could do with it. His piano playing is as
dynamic as you could hope for (and you could
hope for a lot from him). And Liberty DeVito just
goes wild on the drums, adding an area of ex
citement that the original lacked.
Joel writes in his liner notes that, when "Cap
tain Jack" was recorded in Philadelphia, the au
dience "set off a kind of internal explosion and
the adrenalin screamed through their (his band
members') veins" when the band "pushed their
amplifiers into ear-bleeding overdrive" and he
felt "piano strings snapping and breaking under
thefingers in (his) left hand." Wow. Kinda makes
you wish you coulda been there, doesn't it? Even
without that, his recording of the moment does
top his original. The Songs in the Attic version
has all the intensity and energy he says he's
trying to rapture.
But when he asks, "Why make a carbon copy"
of "Piano Man," you might respond, "Well,
then, why make a carbon copy of 'Summer High
land Falls'? Orof'She'sGota Way'? Orof'You're
My Home'?" Sure, they're good songs —
"You're My Home" is even better than that —
but they don't sound any different live than they
do on the record, either. But then they never got
any airplay, so they don't taint his "new-old"
album concept. On the same lines, why not in
clude "Angry Young Man," or "The Enter
tainer," which do sound different live?
The album is still a very good live recording,
replete with all the enthusiasm and virtuoso pi
ano jams that Billy Joel always delivers. It's just
those much-repeated "artistic intentions" that I
wonder about.

coincidental, but he's managed to take a year off
from creating a new studio album and still come
out with a record that's "new" to most listeners.
Whether or not he (or his record company) took
this into account, Songs in the Attic is likely to be
more profitable than a conventional live album
would be.
Taking him at his word — essentially that he'd
always wanted to do better versions of his ob
scure material — he comes off pretty well. The
sound quality is far better than you'll find on
most live albums, which isn't surprising con
sidering it's done by super-producer Phil
Ramone. Of course, the album still rides on just
how good that obscure material is, but Billy Joel
is much too fine a writer to not be able to cull
one good record from the material of four.
One question is whether he achieves his in
tention of remaking 11 songs that sound better
live than they do "on the record." He introduces
this rationale specifically to explain his exclusion
of "Piano Man" — a curious omission consider
ing it's probably the best of the "songs in the at
tic" he's trying to represent. But then it's also the
only song that his casual fans would likely have
heard from that period, and the only one that
would keep this from being a "new album" to
them.
To give him credit where it is certainly de
served, he does succeed in making better ver
sions of several of the songs. Billy Joel is such a

captivating, energetic, stylish live performer that
it would be much more surprising if he didn't
improve any of them. He's taken "Miami 2017,"
already a very good song, and made it into a vi
brant, superb one. There's really not much more
he could do with it. His piano playing is as
dynamic as you could hope for (and you could
hope for a lot from him). And Liberty DeVito just
goes wild on the drums, adding an area of ex
citement that the original lacked.
Joel writes in his liner notes that, when "Cap
tain Jack" was recorded in Philadelphia, the au
dience "set off a kind of internal explosion and
the adrenalin screamed through their (his band
members') veins" when the band "pushed their
amplifiers into ear-bleeding overdrive" and he
felt "piano strings snapping and breaking under
thefingers in (his) left hand." Wow. Kinda makes
you wish you coulda been there, doesn't it? Even
without that, his recording of the moment does
top his original. The Songs in the Attic version
has all the intensity and energy he says he's
trying to rapture.
But when he asks, "Why make a carbon copy"
of "Piano Man," you might respond, "Well,
then, why make a carbon copy of 'Summer High
land Falls'? Orof'She'sGota Way'? Orof'You're
My Home'?" Sure, they're good songs —
"You're My Home" is even better than that —
but they don't sound any different live than they
do on the record, either. But then they never got
any airplay, so they don't taint his "new-old"
album concept. On the same lines, why not in
clude "Angry Young Man," or "The Enter
tainer," which do sound different live?
The album is still a very good live recording,
replete with all the enthusiasm and virtuoso pi
ano jams that Billy Joel always delivers. It's just
those much-repeated "artistic intentions" that I
wonder about.
There's a dual nature to Billy Joel's decision to
make a live album composed entirely of his mu
sic made before The Stranger was released (until
which almost nobody knew his music). On the
one side, you've got to give him credit for an in
novative idea — making a concert album
without hits. On the other, you wonder whether
this idea was as "artistic" a one as his extensive
liner notes would have you believe. This may be
coincidental, but he's managed to take a year off
from creating a new studio album and still come
out with a record that's "new" to most listeners.
