# Optimistic Kinks
## 
### Stefan Malmoli 
I guess The Kinks have finally
gotten what they deserve after
giving the people what they
wanted for over 15 years. They
gave us "You Really Got Me
Now" in 1964, "Waterloo Sun
set" in 1967, Arthur in 1969, and
"Lola" in 1970. Now, in 1981,
The Kinks have finally received
their just deserts. The Kinks are
now riding the biggest wave of
their highly underrated career.
They have recently played
Madison Square Garden for
their first time ever, and their
new album, Give the People
What They Want, is already
top-20. And, above all, instead
of going commercial or
pop/new wave, The Kinks still
do what they want along with
giving the people what thqy
want.
This new album is Ray
Davies's latest masterpiece. It
recalls The Kinks past, present,
and future, and it puts the
Kinks-influenced heavy metal
groups to shame. Listening to
Dave Davies's guitar licks on
"Destroyer," "Back to Front,"
and "Around the Dial" on the
new album will make you
forget that Styx or AC/DC even
existed.
However, it isn't Dave
Davies's licks or Mick Avory's
excellent drumming that
makes this album worth re
viewing. It is Ray Davies's song
writing genius that makes it
special. He is as vital,
vituperative, humorous, para
noid, and exciting as ever. I
don't think Ray could even
come close to falling into one
of his depressing phases, espe
cially with Chrissie Hyncle's
bodily presence around him.
The Kinks, in giving the peo
ple what they want, also give
the people some things that
they need. They touch on
many taboo topics throughout
the album and cut down many

false American values. To be
gin with, the title track is about
America's sick obsession with
violence in relation to tele
vision and the public's relish
for killing: "The Romans really
did things right/Throwing
Christians to the lions sold out
every night/Give the people
what they want.. .Give them
lots of sex, perversion, and
rape, give 'em lots of violence
and plenty to hate.. .Blow out
your brains and do it
right/Make sure it's prime time
and on a Saturday night."
Another violent topic that
Ray Davies puts into a different
light is in the album's best
ballad, "Killer's Eyes." This
track touches on a situation
that no one else would ever
dare approach — the shooting
of John Lennon. However,
Davies doesn't eulogize Len
non as in George Hamilton's
mediocre tribute, "All Those
Years Ago." Instead, the song
takes a backward look at the
killer, because it is America's
diseased need to immortalize
its infamous killers.
Finally, though, The Kinks
show us their sincerity by end
ing with an optimism rarely
found in Ray Davies's works. In
"Better Things," we are again
returned to The Kinks past, be
cause this song has a typical
1965 Kinks melody (similar to
"Til the End of the Day"). How
ever, we aren't given circa 1965
lyrics. Instead, the lyrics are a
beacon for surviving the past
(as The Kinks have done) and
the hope of future survival.
This album certainly is
honest to the people and gives
them exactly what they want.
But in closing the album with
such a positive song, The Kinks
are also trying to give the peo
ple what they desperately
need. I just hope the people lis
ten!

come close to falling into one
of his depressing phases, espe
cially with Chrissie Hyncle's
bodily presence around him.
The Kinks, in giving the peo
ple what they want, also give
the people some things that
they need. They touch on
many taboo topics throughout
the album and cut down many

false American values. To be
gin with, the title track is about
America's sick obsession with
violence in relation to tele
vision and the public's relish
for killing: "The Romans really
did things right/Throwing
Christians to the lions sold out
every night/Give the people
what they want.. .Give them
lots of sex, perversion, and
rape, give 'em lots of violence
and plenty to hate.. .Blow out
your brains and do it
right/Make sure it's prime time
and on a Saturday night."
Another violent topic that
Ray Davies puts into a different
light is in the album's best
ballad, "Killer's Eyes." This
track touches on a situation
that no one else would ever
dare approach — the shooting
of John Lennon. However,
Davies doesn't eulogize Len
non as in George Hamilton's
mediocre tribute, "All Those
Years Ago." Instead, the song
takes a backward look at the
killer, because it is America's
diseased need to immortalize
its infamous killers.
Finally, though, The Kinks
show us their sincerity by end
ing with an optimism rarely
found in Ray Davies's works. In
"Better Things," we are again
returned to The Kinks past, be
cause this song has a typical
1965 Kinks melody (similar to
"Til the End of the Day"). How
ever, we aren't given circa 1965
lyrics. Instead, the lyrics are a
beacon for surviving the past
(as The Kinks have done) and
the hope of future survival.
This album certainly is
honest to the people and gives
them exactly what they want.
But in closing the album with
such a positive song, The Kinks
are also trying to give the peo
ple what they desperately
need. I just hope the people lis
ten!

I guess The Kinks have finally
gotten what they deserve after
giving the people what they
wanted for over 15 years. They
gave us "You Really Got Me
Now" in 1964, "Waterloo Sun
set" in 1967, Arthur in 1969, and
"Lola" in 1970. Now, in 1981,
The Kinks have finally received
their just deserts. The Kinks are
now riding the biggest wave of
their highly underrated career.
They have recently played
Madison Square Garden for
their first time ever, and their
new album, Give the People
What They Want, is already
top-20. And, above all, instead
of going commercial or
pop/new wave, The Kinks still
do what they want along with
giving the people what thqy
want.
This new album is Ray
Davies's latest masterpiece. It
recalls The Kinks past, present,
and future, and it puts the
Kinks-influenced heavy metal
groups to shame. Listening to
Dave Davies's guitar licks on
"Destroyer," "Back to Front,"
and "Around the Dial" on the
new album will make you
forget that Styx or AC/DC even
existed.
However, it isn't Dave
Davies's licks or Mick Avory's
excellent drumming that
makes this album worth re
viewing. It is Ray Davies's song
writing genius that makes it
special. He is as vital,
vituperative, humorous, para
noid, and exciting as ever. I
don't think Ray could even
come close to falling into one
of his depressing phases, espe
cially with Chrissie Hyncle's
bodily presence around him.
