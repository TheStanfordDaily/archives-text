House rejects AWACS sale
Washington — The House of Representatives
rejected the Reagan administration's 58.5
billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia 301-111 yes
terday, with 108 Republicans voting against
President Ronald Reagan in his first major for
eign policy battle with Congress.
The arms package includes missiles and fuel
tanks for Saudi Arabia's F-15 fighters, eight
aerial tankers, and five AWACS radar sur
veillance planes, which have become the cen
ter of the controversy.
Even before the House vote, the overwhelm
ing defeat had been conceded by the White
House, which had pinned its hopes for saving
the controversial agreement on blocking the
same veto measure when it comes to a vote in
the Senate next week. Unless both houses veto
the sale, it automatically will go into effect next
month.
Putting the fight at the top of his agenda, Rea
gan met with eight uncommitted senatorsat the
White House yesterday and personally pleaded
for their support.
He gained some ground in his uphill fight
when four of them declared afterward that they
wouid support the administation in next week's
showdown.
Republican Sens. James Abdnor of South Da
kota, John East of North Carolina, Mack Mat
tingly of Ceorgia and Dan Quayle of Indiana
said they had been satisfied by Reagan's as
surances that securit> measures would guaran
tee protection of sophisticated military tech
nology involved in the sale.
On Capitol Hill, Sens. Charles Percy (R-lll.)
and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) formally an
nounced they would back the administration.
The major gain for Reagan was the commit
ments from Quayle and Mattingly. Both of the
Republican freshmen had been counted as un
committed and had conditioned their support
on being persuaded that U.S. technology would
be protected from compromise.
Although the president described himself as
"cautiously optimistic," the administration ap
peared headed for another setback todav when
the veto resolution will be voted on by the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee.
After hearing the final testimony from the ad
ministration this morning, the committee is
scheduled to take the first Senate test vote.
Senate says no more cuts
Washington — Senate Republican leaders, in
more bad budget news for President Ronald
Reagan, indicated yesterday they will approve
no more than half his proposed appropriations
cuts and postpone action on the rest of his defi
cit-reducing proposals until next year.
An aide to Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Mark Hathetd t R-Ore.') said the com
mittee will begin marking up appropriations

bills next week with a goal of $5 billion in outlay
savings-less than half the $10.4 billion that Rea
gan wants.
And Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) told reporters he does not
foresee action this year on the other two main
components of the new budget plan that Rea
gan announced last month: cuts in entitlement
or basic benefit programs and selective tax in
creases.
In the absence of an agreed-to alternative
strategy for achieving Reagan's goal of $16
billion in new savings and more revenues, this
means that more than two thirds of the program
could be put off until next year-an election year
in which painful spendingcutsand tax increases
become more difficult. Moreover, although the
fiscal year runs until Oct. 1, 1982, delay means
diminished opportunities for big savings.
Carter denounces tax cuts
Washington — Jimmy Carter extended Presi
dent Ronald Reagan one hand in help and gave
him the back of the other on Tuesday as he
pushed an arms sale to Saudi Arabia but said his
successor's tax cuts are "unfair and excessive"
and his overall foreign policy too warlike.
Carter and Reagan met alone in the Oval Of
fice for about 30 minutes late in the afternoon.
Leaving the White House, Carter stopped at a
microphone only long enough to say that his
torically, meetings with the president are con
fidential and "that's a principle I think ought to
be restored."
He said he had a "good, constructive and
friendly meeting," and, when asked whether he
had gotten along well with Reagan, said:
"We've always gotten along well."
The former president, making his first ex
tensive visit to the nation's capital since he de
parted in defeat last January, offered strong
support for the $8.5-billion deal, includ
ing five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes. He based his argument on the
need to support a presidential decision — even
though this one was "a close call."
"Once the president makes that commit
ment, it's important that the commitment is
fulfilled," he said at a news conference prior to
his meeting with Reagan. "A default would en
danger the relationship with the Saudis."
Egyptian president sworn in
Cairo — Pledging total fidelity to the policies
of slain President Anwar Sadat and the
of the law" to those resorting to violence in
Egypt, Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, 53, was for
mally sworn in before a heavily guarded Na
tional Assembly yesterday as Egypt's new leader
and only its fourth president.
The ceremony took place a day after a na
tionwide referendum overwhelmingly ap
proved him as Sadat's successor and eight days

almost to the hour after the former president's
assassination at a military parade by a small
group of Moslem fanatics.
Wearing a black suit and tie in mourning for
Sadat, Mubarak told his shaken nation that
Egypt was in "deep pain" and said the loss was
"catastrophic" and the situation "critical" for
the country. But he added, "We shall not give
in; we shall not surrender."
He promised to remain loyal to the principles
and commitments of the late president, specifi
cally mentioning the American-sponsored
Camp David accords and Egypt's peace treaty
with Egypt. And he declared Egypt's de
termination not to go back on tos decision,
"even if they were disliked by bigger powers."
This appeared to be a reference to the Soviet
Union, which has vehemently attacked the
peace accords and the treaty.
"Camp David and peace with Israel will con
tinue in all its letter and commitment," he said,
seeking to reassure both the United States and
Israel. "We shall continue the autonomy nego
tiations to put the Palestinians on the beginning
of the road to get their lawful rights."
Unrest resumes in Poland
Warsaw — Nearly 12,000 women garment
workers protesting food shortages occupied
textile mills west of Warsaw for the second day
yesterday, while 10,000 workers in two small
towns south of the capital ended a 24-hour
strike, Solidarity officials said.
Solidarity and Poland's Communist govern
ment sought new talks to defuse the unrest, but
government sources said negotiations ap
peared unlikely before the Central Committee
meets Friday to decide on its next step in deal
ing with the independent union.
The striking women workers of Zyrardow, a
city of 37,000 west of Warsaw, occupied 12 fac
tories in shifts, leaving the buildings only to care
for their families.
Tadeusz Narkun, a Solidarity spokesman, said
the women would continue to paralyze the fab
ric center until "there is improvement of mar
ket deliveries."
Stock market declines
New York — The stock market took its
sharpest drop in six weeks yesterday amid con
cern over third-quarter earnings reports and
fears that interest rates were headed upward
again.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
14.93 to 850.65, for its largest loss since it
dropped 17.22 points on Sept. 3.
Today's weather

Senate says no more cuts
Washington — Senate Republican leaders, in
more bad budget news for President Ronald
Reagan, indicated yesterday they will approve
no more than half his proposed appropriations
cuts and postpone action on the rest of his defi
cit-reducing proposals until next year.
An aide to Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Mark Hathetd t R-Ore.') said the com
mittee will begin marking up appropriations

bills next week with a goal of $5 billion in outlay
savings-less than half the $10.4 billion that Rea
gan wants.
And Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) told reporters he does not
foresee action this year on the other two main
components of the new budget plan that Rea
gan announced last month: cuts in entitlement
or basic benefit programs and selective tax in
creases.
In the absence of an agreed-to alternative
strategy for achieving Reagan's goal of $16
billion in new savings and more revenues, this
means that more than two thirds of the program
could be put off until next year-an election year
in which painful spendingcutsand tax increases
become more difficult. Moreover, although the
fiscal year runs until Oct. 1, 1982, delay means
diminished opportunities for big savings.
Carter denounces tax cuts
Washington — Jimmy Carter extended Presi
dent Ronald Reagan one hand in help and gave
him the back of the other on Tuesday as he
pushed an arms sale to Saudi Arabia but said his
successor's tax cuts are "unfair and excessive"
and his overall foreign policy too warlike.
Carter and Reagan met alone in the Oval Of
fice for about 30 minutes late in the afternoon.
Leaving the White House, Carter stopped at a
microphone only long enough to say that his
torically, meetings with the president are con
fidential and "that's a principle I think ought to
be restored."
He said he had a "good, constructive and
friendly meeting," and, when asked whether he
had gotten along well with Reagan, said:
"We've always gotten along well."
The former president, making his first ex
tensive visit to the nation's capital since he de
parted in defeat last January, offered strong
support for the $8.5-billion deal, includ
ing five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes. He based his argument on the
need to support a presidential decision — even
though this one was "a close call."
"Once the president makes that commit
ment, it's important that the commitment is
fulfilled," he said at a news conference prior to
his meeting with Reagan. "A default would en
danger the relationship with the Saudis."
Egyptian president sworn in
Cairo — Pledging total fidelity to the policies
of slain President Anwar Sadat and the
of the law" to those resorting to violence in
Egypt, Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, 53, was for
mally sworn in before a heavily guarded Na
tional Assembly yesterday as Egypt's new leader
and only its fourth president.
The ceremony took place a day after a na
tionwide referendum overwhelmingly ap
proved him as Sadat's successor and eight days

almost to the hour after the former president's
assassination at a military parade by a small
group of Moslem fanatics.
Wearing a black suit and tie in mourning for
Sadat, Mubarak told his shaken nation that
Egypt was in "deep pain" and said the loss was
"catastrophic" and the situation "critical" for
the country. But he added, "We shall not give
in; we shall not surrender."
He promised to remain loyal to the principles
and commitments of the late president, specifi
cally mentioning the American-sponsored
Camp David accords and Egypt's peace treaty
with Egypt. And he declared Egypt's de
termination not to go back on tos decision,
"even if they were disliked by bigger powers."
This appeared to be a reference to the Soviet
Union, which has vehemently attacked the
peace accords and the treaty.
"Camp David and peace with Israel will con
tinue in all its letter and commitment," he said,
seeking to reassure both the United States and
Israel. "We shall continue the autonomy nego
tiations to put the Palestinians on the beginning
of the road to get their lawful rights."
Unrest resumes in Poland
Warsaw — Nearly 12,000 women garment
workers protesting food shortages occupied
textile mills west of Warsaw for the second day
yesterday, while 10,000 workers in two small
towns south of the capital ended a 24-hour
strike, Solidarity officials said.
Solidarity and Poland's Communist govern
ment sought new talks to defuse the unrest, but
government sources said negotiations ap
peared unlikely before the Central Committee
meets Friday to decide on its next step in deal
ing with the independent union.
The striking women workers of Zyrardow, a
city of 37,000 west of Warsaw, occupied 12 fac
tories in shifts, leaving the buildings only to care
for their families.
Tadeusz Narkun, a Solidarity spokesman, said
the women would continue to paralyze the fab
ric center until "there is improvement of mar
ket deliveries."
Stock market declines
New York — The stock market took its
sharpest drop in six weeks yesterday amid con

dropped 17.22 points on Sept. 3.

House rejects AWACS sale
Washington — The House of Representatives
rejected the Reagan administration's 58.5
billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia 301-111 yes
terday, with 108 Republicans voting against
President Ronald Reagan in his first major for
eign policy battle with Congress.
The arms package includes missiles and fuel
tanks for Saudi Arabia's F-15 fighters, eight
aerial tankers, and five AWACS radar sur
veillance planes, which have become the cen
ter of the controversy.
Even before the House vote, the overwhelm
ing defeat had been conceded by the White
House, which had pinned its hopes for saving
the controversial agreement on blocking the
same veto measure when it comes to a vote in
the Senate next week. Unless both houses veto
the sale, it automatically will go into effect next
month.
Putting the fight at the top of his agenda, Rea

White House yesterday and personally pleaded
for their support.
He gained some ground in his uphill fight
when four of them declared afterward that they

no more than half his proposed appropriations
cuts and postpone action on the rest of his defi
cit-reducing proposals until next year.
An aide to Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Mark Hathetd t R-Ore.') said the com
mittee will begin marking up appropriations

bills next week with a goal of $5 billion in outlay
savings-less than half the $10.4 billion that Rea
gan wants.
And Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) told reporters he does not
foresee action this year on the other two main
components of the new budget plan that Rea
gan announced last month: cuts in entitlement
or basic benefit programs and selective tax in
creases.
In the absence of an agreed-to alternative
strategy for achieving Reagan's goal of $16
billion in new savings and more revenues, this
means that more than two thirds of the program
could be put off until next year-an election year
in which painful spendingcutsand tax increases
become more difficult. Moreover, although the
fiscal year runs until Oct. 1, 1982, delay means
diminished opportunities for big savings.
Carter denounces tax cuts
Washington — Jimmy Carter extended Presi
dent Ronald Reagan one hand in help and gave
him the back of the other on Tuesday as he
pushed an arms sale to Saudi Arabia but said his
successor's tax cuts are "unfair and excessive"
and his overall foreign policy too warlike.
Carter and Reagan met alone in the Oval Of
fice for about 30 minutes late in the afternoon.
Leaving the White House, Carter stopped at a
microphone only long enough to say that his
torically, meetings with the president are con
fidential and "that's a principle I think ought to
be restored."
He said he had a "good, constructive and
friendly meeting," and, when asked whether he
had gotten along well with Reagan, said:
"We've always gotten along well."
The former president, making his first ex
tensive visit to the nation's capital since he de
parted in defeat last January, offered strong
support for the $8.5-billion deal, includ
ing five Airborne Warning and Control System
radar planes. He based his argument on the
need to support a presidential decision — even
though this one was "a close call."
"Once the president makes that commit
ment, it's important that the commitment is
fulfilled," he said at a news conference prior to
his meeting with Reagan. "A default would en
danger the relationship with the Saudis."
Egyptian president sworn in
Cairo — Pledging total fidelity to the policies
of slain President Anwar Sadat and the
of the law" to those resorting to violence in
Egypt, Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, 53, was for
mally sworn in before a heavily guarded Na
tional Assembly yesterday as Egypt's new leader
and only its fourth president.
The ceremony took place a day after a na
tionwide referendum overwhelmingly ap
proved him as Sadat's successor and eight days

almost to the hour after the former president's
assassination at a military parade by a small
group of Moslem fanatics.
Wearing a black suit and tie in mourning for
Sadat, Mubarak told his shaken nation that
Egypt was in "deep pain" and said the loss was
"catastrophic" and the situation "critical" for
the country. But he added, "We shall not give
in; we shall not surrender."
He promised to remain loyal to the principles
and commitments of the late president, specifi
cally mentioning the American-sponsored
Camp David accords and Egypt's peace treaty
with Egypt. And he declared Egypt's de
termination not to go back on tos decision,
"even if they were disliked by bigger powers."
This appeared to be a reference to the Soviet
Union, which has vehemently attacked the
peace accords and the treaty.
"Camp David and peace with Israel will con
tinue in all its letter and commitment," he said,
seeking to reassure both the United States and
Israel. "We shall continue the autonomy nego
tiations to put the Palestinians on the beginning
of the road to get their lawful rights."
Unrest resumes in Poland
Warsaw — Nearly 12,000 women garment
workers protesting food shortages occupied
textile mills west of Warsaw for the second day
yesterday, while 10,000 workers in two small
towns south of the capital ended a 24-hour
strike, Solidarity officials said.
Solidarity and Poland's Communist govern
ment sought new talks to defuse the unrest, but
government sources said negotiations ap
peared unlikely before the Central Committee
meets Friday to decide on its next step in deal
ing with the independent union.
The striking women workers of Zyrardow, a
city of 37,000 west of Warsaw, occupied 12 fac
tories in shifts, leaving the buildings only to care
for their families.
Tadeusz Narkun, a Solidarity spokesman, said
the women would continue to paralyze the fab
ric center until "there is improvement of mar
ket deliveries."

dropped 17.22 points on Sept. 3.

House rejects AWACS sale
Washington — The House of Representatives
rejected the Reagan administration's 58.5
billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia 301-111 yes
terday, with 108 Republicans voting against
President Ronald Reagan in his first major for
eign policy battle with Congress.
The arms package includes missiles and fuel
tanks for Saudi Arabia's F-15 fighters, eight
aerial tankers, and five AWACS radar sur
veillance planes, which have become the cen
ter of the controversy.
Even before the House vote, the overwhelm
ing defeat had been conceded by the White
House, which had pinned its hopes for saving
the controversial agreement on blocking the
same veto measure when it comes to a vote in
the Senate next week. Unless both houses veto
the sale, it automatically will go into effect next
month.
Putting the fight at the top of his agenda, Rea
gan met with eight uncommitted senatorsat the
White House yesterday and personally pleaded
for their support.
He gained some ground in his uphill fight
when four of them declared afterward that they
wouid support the administation in next week's
showdown.
Republican Sens. James Abdnor of South Da
kota, John East of North Carolina, Mack Mat
tingly of Ceorgia and Dan Quayle of Indiana
said they had been satisfied by Reagan's as
surances that securit> measures would guaran
tee protection of sophisticated military tech
nology involved in the sale.
On Capitol Hill, Sens. Charles Percy (R-lll.)
and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) formally an
nounced they would back the administration.
The major gain for Reagan was the commit
ments from Quayle and Mattingly. Both of the
Republican freshmen had been counted as un
committed and had conditioned their support
on being persuaded that U.S. technology would
be protected from compromise.
Although the president described himself as
"cautiously optimistic," the administration ap
peared headed for another setback todav when
the veto resolution will be voted on by the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee.
After hearing the final testimony from the ad
ministration this morning, the committee is
scheduled to take the first Senate test vote.
Senate says no more cuts
