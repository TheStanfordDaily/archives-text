# Professor Gould speaks on Poland, unions
## Centralization might hurt unions 
### Richard Zimler 
Stanford law professor William
Gould, who recently returned from
Poland and the first national labor
union convention ever held in an
Eastern Bloc state, spoke Tuesday at
the Bechtel International Center.
Gould, an expert in trade union
law and labor relations, emphasized
the struggle over centralization cur
rently being waged within Poland's
labor union Solidarity.
Citing the drift of power toward a
central group of leaders and repre
sentatives, Gould asserted that the
fear among many at the convention
was that "this trend toward cen
tralization will eventually lead to a
Communist Party structure."

For Poles, said Gould, this structure
has traditionally implied a "bureau
cratization" — the creation of a cen
tral authority insensitive to the needs
of workers.
Hoping to avoid that fate were
those at the convention seeking to
"undercut" Solidarity's central
power organization. According to
Gould, infighting became so strong
that when the chairman of the Cen
tral Coordinating Committee, Lech
Walesa, asked to speak out of turn,
"there was a substantial group that
did not want him to speak at all."
Although under attack from some
at the convention, Walesa succeeded
in getting 11 of his nominees selected
for Solidarity's new presidium. The

convention did, in addition, achieve
a consensus on a union platform.
The focal point of this program, ac
cording to Gould, is the right of
workers to select management.
"Self-management legislation is at
the heart of what is going on in Po
land today," he said. "One part of the
picture . . . within its grasp to change
. . . is management and bureau
cracy"
Emphasizing Solidarity's call for a
"second house of Parliament to be
created . . . out of this new group of
manageis," Gould said such legisla
tion would be "the first step towards
a self-governing Poland."
Legislation has been slow in com
ing, however. Proposals drafted and
agreed upon by both the govern
ment and Solidarity in Sept., 1980,
have yet to be made law.
There is a deadlock, according to
Gould, over the issues of minimum
membership requirements for
unions, and the government's right
to de-register a union "found to have
behaved inconsistently with its con
stitution."
Gould pointed out that Solidarity's
ambivalence towards these earlier
proposals may also have something
to do with the deadlock. Explaining
that the legislation would impose
limits on political strikes, Gould said
that some within Solidarity now
agree with the government that such
legislation is not as pressing as it once
was.
The ambivalence and tension
within Solidarity apparently has not
hurt its strength, however. Accord
ing to Gould, it is now the largest
union in Poland, claiming 9.4 million
members. Furthermore, the shift in
membership away from the Com
munist Party's "branch" unions
"continues to move Solidarity's
way," he said.
. Indeed, the most pressing prob
lems facing Solidarity, according to

Gould, will come from outside the
union organization: from the Soviet
Union, which may not tolerate
further moves towards independ
ence, and from Poland's own
beleaguered economy which may
grow worse as winter approaches.
Speaking of the United States'' role
in possibly helping to stabilize this
shaky future, Gould reminded the
audience that "the West has always
let Poland down." He maintained
that instead, the United States now
needs to "express concern and will
ingness to aid."

law and labor relations, emphasized
the struggle over centralization cur
rently being waged within Poland's
labor union Solidarity.
Citing the drift of power toward a
central group of leaders and repre
sentatives, Gould asserted that the
fear among many at the convention
was that "this trend toward cen
tralization will eventually lead to a
Communist Party structure."

For Poles, said Gould, this structure
has traditionally implied a "bureau
cratization" — the creation of a cen
tral authority insensitive to the needs
of workers.
Hoping to avoid that fate were
those at the convention seeking to
"undercut" Solidarity's central
power organization. According to
Gould, infighting became so strong
that when the chairman of the Cen
tral Coordinating Committee, Lech
Walesa, asked to speak out of turn,
"there was a substantial group that
did not want him to speak at all."
Although under attack from some
at the convention, Walesa succeeded
in getting 11 of his nominees selected
for Solidarity's new presidium. The

convention did, in addition, achieve
a consensus on a union platform.
The focal point of this program, ac
cording to Gould, is the right of
workers to select management.
"Self-management legislation is at
the heart of what is going on in Po
land today," he said. "One part of the
picture . . . within its grasp to change
. . . is management and bureau
cracy"
Emphasizing Solidarity's call for a
"second house of Parliament to be
created . . . out of this new group of
manageis," Gould said such legisla
tion would be "the first step towards
a self-governing Poland."
Legislation has been slow in com
ing, however. Proposals drafted and
agreed upon by both the govern
ment and Solidarity in Sept., 1980,
have yet to be made law.
There is a deadlock, according to
Gould, over the issues of minimum
membership requirements for
unions, and the government's right
to de-register a union "found to have
behaved inconsistently with its con
stitution."
Gould pointed out that Solidarity's
ambivalence towards these earlier
proposals may also have something
to do with the deadlock. Explaining
that the legislation would impose
limits on political strikes, Gould said
that some within Solidarity now
agree with the government that such
legislation is not as pressing as it once
was.
The ambivalence and tension
within Solidarity apparently has not
hurt its strength, however. Accord
ing to Gould, it is now the largest
union in Poland, claiming 9.4 million
members. Furthermore, the shift in
membership away from the Com
munist Party's "branch" unions
"continues to move Solidarity's
way," he said.
. Indeed, the most pressing prob
lems facing Solidarity, according to

Gould, will come from outside the
union organization: from the Soviet
Union, which may not tolerate
further moves towards independ
ence, and from Poland's own
beleaguered economy which may
grow worse as winter approaches.
Speaking of the United States'' role
in possibly helping to stabilize this
shaky future, Gould reminded the
audience that "the West has always
let Poland down." He maintained
that instead, the United States now
needs to "express concern and will
ingness to aid."
