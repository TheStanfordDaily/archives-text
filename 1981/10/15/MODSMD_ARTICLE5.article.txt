# Professor Gould speaks on Poland, unions
## Centralization might hurt unions

Stanford law professor William
Gould, who recently returned from
Poland and the first national labor
union convention ever held in an
Eastern Bloc state, spoke Tuesday at
the Bechtel International Center.
Gould, an expert in trade union
law and labor relations, emphasized
the struggle over centralization cur
rently being waged within Poland's
labor union Solidarity.
Citing the drift of power toward a
central group of leaders and repre

fear among many at the convention
was that "this trend toward cen
tralization will eventually lead to a
Communist Party structure."

For Poles, said Gould, this structure
has traditionally implied a "bureau
cratization" â€” the creation of a cen

of workers.
Hoping to avoid that fate were
those at the convention seeking to
"undercut" Solidarity's central
power organization. According to
Gould, infighting became so strong
that when the chairman of the Cen

Walesa, asked to speak out of turn,
"there was a substantial group that
did not want him to speak at all."
Although under attack from some
at the convention, Walesa succeeded
in getting 11 of his nominees selected
for Solidarity's new presidium. The

convention did, in addition, achieve
a consensus on a union platform.
The focal point of this program, ac
cording to Gould, is the right of
workers to select management.
"Self-management legislation is at
the heart of what is going on in Po
land today," he said. "One part of the
picture . . . within its grasp to change
. . . is management and bureau
cracy"
Emphasizing Solidarity's call for a
"second house of Parliament to be
created . . . out of this new group of
manageis," Gould said such legisla

a self-governing Poland."
Legislation has been slow in com
