# Palo Alto to vote on gay ordinance
## 
### Bambi Haggins 
Measure B, an ordinance prohibit
ing discrimination based on sexual
orientation, will appear on the Palo
Alto ballot Nov. 3. The ordinance,
placed on the ballot by a 6-3 vote of
the City Council last june, would pro
tect persons from discrimination in
any aspect of employment, union
membership (where the business or
union has more than five members)
and real estate transactions.
However, it would provide some
exceptions to the practices such as
occupational qualifications, dress
and conduct regulations which are
job related, seniority, domestic ser
vices and child care in theemployer's
home, rental of owner-occupied
space and religious organizations
that provide services not subsidized
by the city.
Similar ordinances have been
passed in San Francisco, Berkeley,
and Los Angeles, but Santa Clara
County defeated such an ordinance
by a one percent margin in 1979.
Support for Measure B, which in
terprets "sexual orientation" to in
clude homosexuals, bisexuals and
heterosexuals, comes from a variety
of Palo Alto residents and local lead
ers. Paul "Pete" McCloskey, the 12th
district's congressman, came out in
support of the measure early in the
campaign, as did Palo Alto Mayor
Alan Henderson. Other support for
the measure comes from the Palo
Alto Human Relations Committee,
Palo Alto Ministerial Association and
Palo Alto Coalition for Equal Rights
(PACER).
PACER, which has been working
with the Stanford Gay People's
Union (GPU), has solicited endorse
ments from many prominent mem
bers of the community including
Nobel laureate Robert Hofstadter.
"We have been in close coopera
tion with PACER," said Rhio Hiersch,
a spokesman for the GPU. "We've

been doing everything from fund
raising to publicity. Many of our
members are PACER members and
will be out canvassing neighbor
hoods, giving out information on
Measure B."
According to PACER staff member,
Steve Harris, the support for Measure
B is not concentrated solely among
young or gay members of the com
munity. The issue, according to pro
ponents, is not that narrow. Harris
contended, "in matters of basic hu
man needs such as housing and em
ployment, a person's race, religion,
sex or ancestry are, should be, illegal
grounds for discrimination. Measure
B merely adds sexual orientation."
Some Stanford faculty members
(have recently) become involved
with the campaign effort including
Ron Rebholtz, Will Laben and iohn
Winkler.
No public organization has been
formed to oppose the ordinance.
Opposition to the measure is neither
as widespread nor as organized as its
proponents. Some individuals have
publicly devoured the ordinance,
but no one has begun any active
campaigning in its opposition.
"Palo Alto is, after all, a reasonably
intelligent town," said Hiersch. "It's
generally well-educated, arid I think
we can expect the measure to pass."
Nevertheless, council members
Fred Eyerly and Anne Witherspoon
claim there is no compelling need for
such a law in Palo Alto. "Only 100 gay
individuals," according to the posi
tion paper signed by Eyerly and
Witherspoon, "reported ex
periences of discrimination in Palo
Alto, a city of 56,000 with an em
ployment base of over 100,000.
"I don't see a need for such an or
dinance," stated Eyerly, "because
there have not been a significant
number of cases of discrimination
that would make such an ordinance
