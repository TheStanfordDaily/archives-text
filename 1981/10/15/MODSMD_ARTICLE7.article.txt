# Campus lighting improved
## 
### Lauren Goldman 
Only two days into the new
school year, a woman was at
tacked on campus — just outside
Tresidder Union. The Harvest
Dance, only yards away, was in full
swing.
Occurences such as this lend a
degree of pertinency to the focal
issue of last week's rape awareness
program — namely, what can be
done to improve the safety of
women here?
Rape awareness week was
meant to help students cope with
this problem in a variety of ways.
There were films about rape, as
sertiveness training sessions for
women, men-against-violence
talks, and much more.
One topic which was not given
much focus, however, was the
campus lighting issue. The issue
has two sides, first, the adminis
tration has been working hard to
improve campus lighting in recent
years and many students seem to
be happy with the progress al
ready made. Second, the women
most concerned about campus
safety are not sure more lighting is
the best answer.
Students and administration
alike agree that campus lighting
can be helpful. It builds a sense of
security and makes it easier to spot
would-be attackers.
"A well-lit campus is going to
deter someone who might be hid
ing behind a tree or bush," said Ed
Scoles, director of housing and
food services.
Thus in recent years the General
Plant Improvement (GPI) program
has allocated $200,000 annually for
campus lighting improvements. A
10-year lighting plan was drawn
up in 1980,75 percent of which has
already been completed, accord
ing to Max Mazenko, director of
the planning office.
Areas that have received new
lighting in recent months include
Alvarado Row, the strip between
Tresidder and Old Union (where
last week's assault occured), and
half of Santa Teresa Street. Areas
currently being considered in
clude the portion of Santa Teresa
Street near Roble Gym and
Lagunita Court, the path behind
558 Mayfield and a stretch along
Lake Lagunita.leading to the pro
posed undergraduate student
housing.
"We're trying to stay one step
ahead of the game," explained
Mazenko.
"When we've asked for light

ing, we've gotten it," said Patricia
Brandt, assistant dean of campus
activities. She noted that the plan
ning office came to the Women's
Center of its own initiative for in
put.
The planning office meets with
representatives from housing fa
cilities, campus police, SURE,
ASSU and other organizations in
what is known as the Personal
Safety Committee. Among other
issues, the committee discusses
potential locations for new out
door lighting. A list of needs is
created, and then it's up to the GPI
to review the list and allocate
funds. The whole process from in
itial consideration to illumination
takes slightly over one year. Re
cently installed lamps along
Alvarado Row were part of the
1980-81 planning cycle, for exam
ple. The 1981-82 cycle should be
completed early this winter, and
projects under present considera
tion for 1982-83, such as around
Roble Gym, will not actually be in
working order until late next fall.
Nevertheless, even areas de
termined "low priority" by the
planning committee eventually
receive attention, according to
Mazenko. Andy Cargile, coordi
nator of SURE, praised Mazenko's
efforts, saying, "With the money
he's got, he's putting it where it's
needed. I couldn't imagine it
being done much better at all."
Cargile is also impressed by
Mazenko's efforts to gain as many
student opinions as possible. If
students or resident fellows are
concerned about lighting in a par
ticular area, they can usually get
good results by going to the de
partment of residential education
or the ASSU-sponsored Personal
Safety Committee. If it's some
thing as simple as replacing a
lightbulb, Res Ed will put in a work
order and it can usually be ac
complished in about a week. The
only problem, according to Eliz
abeth Hiyama, director of admin
istration for Res Ed, is that "often
no one reports these things."
In fact, according to Cargile,
many students don't realize how
much impact they have. When, on
occasion, complaints about glar
ing parking lot fixtures or lights
which shine in students' windows
have been addressed to Res Ed,
the complainers were surprised to
learn they could take their con
cerns directly to Mazenko at the
planning office.

Nevertheless, these women all
expressed that lighting was not
the only, nor necessarily the best,
answer to campus safety. Some
areas on campus are bright, but
unsafe, they said. The middle of
the Quad was used as an example.
Other factors which must be
considered on assessing safety in
clude level of isolation and the
possibilities for escape.

up in 1980,75 percent of which has
already been completed, accord
ing to Max Mazenko, director of
the planning office.
Areas that have received new
lighting in recent months include
Alvarado Row, the strip between
Tresidder and Old Union (where
last week's assault occured), and
half of Santa Teresa Street. Areas
currently being considered in
clude the portion of Santa Teresa
Street near Roble Gym and
Lagunita Court, the path behind
558 Mayfield and a stretch along
Lake Lagunita.leading to the pro
posed undergraduate student
housing.
"We're trying to stay one step
ahead of the game," explained
Mazenko.
"When we've asked for light

ing, we've gotten it," said Patricia
Brandt, assistant dean of campus
activities. She noted that the plan
ning office came to the Women's
Center of its own initiative for in
put.
The planning office meets with
representatives from housing fa
cilities, campus police, SURE,
ASSU and other organizations in
what is known as the Personal
Safety Committee. Among other
issues, the committee discusses
potential locations for new out
door lighting. A list of needs is
created, and then it's up to the GPI
to review the list and allocate
funds. The whole process from in
itial consideration to illumination
takes slightly over one year. Re
cently installed lamps along
Alvarado Row were part of the
1980-81 planning cycle, for exam
ple. The 1981-82 cycle should be
completed early this winter, and
projects under present considera
tion for 1982-83, such as around
Roble Gym, will not actually be in
working order until late next fall.
Nevertheless, even areas de
termined "low priority" by the
planning committee eventually
receive attention, according to
Mazenko. Andy Cargile, coordi
nator of SURE, praised Mazenko's
efforts, saying, "With the money
he's got, he's putting it where it's
needed. I couldn't imagine it
being done much better at all."
Cargile is also impressed by
Mazenko's efforts to gain as many
student opinions as possible. If
students or resident fellows are
concerned about lighting in a par
ticular area, they can usually get
good results by going to the de
partment of residential education
or the ASSU-sponsored Personal
Safety Committee. If it's some
thing as simple as replacing a
lightbulb, Res Ed will put in a work
order and it can usually be ac
complished in about a week. The
only problem, according to Eliz
abeth Hiyama, director of admin
istration for Res Ed, is that "often
no one reports these things."
In fact, according to Cargile,
many students don't realize how
much impact they have. When, on
occasion, complaints about glar
ing parking lot fixtures or lights
which shine in students' windows
have been addressed to Res Ed,
the complainers were surprised to
learn they could take their con
cerns directly to Mazenko at the
planning office.

Nevertheless, these women all
expressed that lighting was not
the only, nor necessarily the best,
answer to campus safety. Some
areas on campus are bright, but
unsafe, they said. The middle of
the Quad was used as an example.
Other factors which must be
considered on assessing safety in
clude level of isolation and the
possibilities for escape.

Only two days into the new
school year, a woman was at
tacked on campus — just outside
Tresidder Union. The Harvest
Dance, only yards away, was in full
swing.
Occurences such as this lend a
degree of pertinency to the focal
issue of last week's rape awareness
program — namely, what can be
done to improve the safety of
women here?
Rape awareness week was
meant to help students cope with
this problem in a variety of ways.
There were films about rape, as
sertiveness training sessions for
women, men-against-violence
talks, and much more.
One topic which was not given
much focus, however, was the
campus lighting issue. The issue
has two sides, first, the adminis
tration has been working hard to
improve campus lighting in recent
years and many students seem to
be happy with the progress al
ready made. Second, the women
most concerned about campus
safety are not sure more lighting is
the best answer.
Students and administration
alike agree that campus lighting
can be helpful. It builds a sense of
security and makes it easier to spot
would-be attackers.
"A well-lit campus is going to
deter someone who might be hid
ing behind a tree or bush," said Ed
Scoles, director of housing and
food services.
Thus in recent years the General
Plant Improvement (GPI) program
has allocated $200,000 annually for
campus lighting improvements. A
10-year lighting plan was drawn
up in 1980,75 percent of which has
already been completed, accord

the planning office.
