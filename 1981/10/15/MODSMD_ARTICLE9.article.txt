# Non-Africans in raid, says Morocco

Rab.it, Morocco (AP) — The
desert war in the Western Sa
hara is heating up again, with
Morocco reporting an attack
from "neighboring countries"
in which tanks and Soviet
made anti-aircraft missiles
were used against Moroccan
forces for the first time.
In a letter sent to President
Ronald Reagan, French Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand, King
Khaled of Saudi Arabia, U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim, and other world
leaders, King Hassan II charged
the rocket launchers were
manned by non-Africans. He
did not specify what country
the missile crews might be
from.
Hassan said two Moroccan
aircraft were shot down by mis
siles Tuesday in a battle "of ex
treme gravity" at the desert
outpost of Gue\ta Zemmur, in
the southern part of theformer
Spanish Sahara 19 miles east of
the border with Mauritania.
The king said his aviators had
a clear view of the launchers
and there was no doubt that

they saw SAM-6s or SAM-Bs,
Soviet-made surface-to-air
missiles.
Morocco has been fighting
guerrillas of the Polisario Front
since 1976 for control of the
sparsely populated but phos
phate-rich territory on its
southern border which Spain
ceded to it and Mauritania.
Not Africans, Hassan says
"And that is the grave fact
that we are signaling, because
no state in the region, even less
the Polisario, has African tech
nicians, and we stress the word
African, capable of employing
such arms judiciously and in an
effective manner," Hassan
said. Mauritania made peace
with the Polisario in 1979 and
pulled back its forces, and Mo
rocco annexed the entire terri
tory.
The guerrillas have been
supported from the start by
neighboring Algeria, a long
time foe of Hassan. Recently,
they have gotten significant
backing from Col. Moammar
Khadafy, the Libyan leader.
Hassan's letter said in the

battle at Guelta Zemmur, 150
miles south of the old border
between Morocco and the
Spanish Sahara, Moroccan
forces for the first time since
the conflict began detected
"the presence of several dozen
tracked tanks."
He said the planes shot down
were a U.S.-made C-130 trans
port flying at 18,000 feet and a
French-built Mirage F-1 flying
at top speed at 30,000 feet.
Unsure point of origin
Hassan did not provide other
details of the battle but said,
"The attackers could only have
come from neighboring coun
tries." He did not elaborate.
But his use of the plural in
dicated he meant that the force
had come from southwest Al
geria and across northern
Mauritania via the Route du
Mauritanie, a 360 mile run on
the only main road through
that part of the Sahara.
Hassan said the attack "grav
ely compromises" a peace
process started at last July's
summit meeting of the Or
ganization of African Unity.
