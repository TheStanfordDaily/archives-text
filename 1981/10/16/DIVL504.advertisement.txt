Red or white? Where and when?
If you're afraid of
cancer you're not alone
But some people are so afraid
that they won't go to the
doctor when they suspect
something's wrong
They're afraid the
doctor might "find some
thing" This kind of fear can
prevent them from discover
ing cancer in the early stages
when it is most often curable
These people run the
risk of letting cancer scare
them to death
