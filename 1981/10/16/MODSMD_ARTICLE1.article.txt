# Phi Delt calendar enrages campus feminist groups
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer Melinda Zachary 
The Phi Delta Theta calendar — is it
"an elite girly magazine" or an "in
nocent and sincere attempt to
portray the women at Stanford?"
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity is
publishing a calendar of Stanford
women in which it intends to present
between 12 and 25 women in a variety
of academic, athletic and social set
tings around the campus.
The calendar is scheduled to come
out in late November or karly De
cember.The fraternity claims it was
begun as a fundraising project with
the intention of donating the pro
ceeds to "women's charities."
Women from the Women's Center
maintain that no women's organiza
tion on campus will accept the mon
ey under the conditions of the pro
duction process outlined by the
fraternity, beginning with a photog
raphy session last night.
On Oct. 7, the fraternity invited 150
women to particpate in a preliminary
photography session at the Phi Delt
house last night. Approximately 60
women attended, most of them reci
pients of an invitation. The fraternity
also put an announcement in the Dai
ly's "Once Around the Quad" sec
tion, in which it stated that the event
was open to all women "interested in
photographing for the 1982 edition of
the Women of Stanford Calendar."
According to the process oulined
by Phil Gyori, the director of the
project, the next step will be to
choose 12 to 25 women based on
their "photographs and the short
biography cards" they filled out last
night. The women will be chosen by a

panel consisting of two men, two
women, and, according to Gyori,
possibly two faculty members.
The final pictures of the women
will be taken the last week in Octo
ber and the themes, outfits and set
tings of the photographs will be
chosen by the women and the pho
tographer, according to the fraterni
ty plan.
Two weeks ago, Gyori contacted
Sharon Silverstine at the Women's
Center to inform her of the fraterni
ty's interest in producing the calen
dar. At that time the Phi Delts' plans
were not crystalized and they were
still looking for suggestions on the
format, according to Gyori.
Silverstine agreed that the fraterni
ty members' plans were strictly ten
tative at that time and said that during
this first phone conversation, it
seemed they were "looking for sub
stantive and positive input." She said
she agreed to call Gyori again after
communicating with other women
about the project.
When she returned his call approx
imately two weeks later, she said the
fraternity had finalized its plans and
claimed that it was committed to vari
ous people and could not reshape
the project.
In light of the second phone con
versation and the subsequent meet
ing Wednesday afternoon with sev
eral representatives from the Wom
en's Center and two representatives
from the fraternity, Dayna Goldfine,
from the Women's Center, said, "It
seems he (Gyori) doesn't want any
kind of substantive input; what he
wants is complicity."
"We went to them (women at the
Women's Center) first, attempting to
be diplomatic," said Gyori.
In the second phone conversation

the fraternity was looking for names
of "women's charities" which would
be interested in accepting the mon
ey, according to Gyori. The Phi Delts
were also wondering if any of the
women from the Women's Center
would be willingtoserveonthejudg
ing committee, said Gyori.
"The selection is structurally
wrong. Nothing done along the way
will make it any better," said Karen
Davis at the meeting Wednesday.
Yesterday, in a separate interview,
Silverstine, Davis, Goldfine and oth
ers said Wednesday's meeting was an
attempt to offer them "lip-service,"
not a sincere request for suggestions.
According to Catherine MacKin
non, a law professor and feminist
here, the women offered several sug
gestions, including sending a pho
tographer around the campus to
photograph a more diverse group of
women than the one invited to at
tend the session yesterday evening.
MacKinnon stressed the need to
present minorities, older women,
working women, professors and
handicapped women in any
portrayal of "Stanford Women."
"Why don't you just call it the Phi
Delta Stanford girls?" Davis asked
Gyori Wednesday.
Gyori claims the women from the
center "didn't make any suggestions
that fit anywhere in our structure."
He also said the women were "mali
cious and hostile."
MacKinnon said that at the meet
ing Wednesday she and others sug-
the professional pho
tographer and holding a photogra
phy contest which wouldfeature
women at Stanford in various en
vironments and work places. Regard
ing the commitment to the 150 wom-


CALENDAR CONTEST — More than 50 women attended a photography session at the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity last night to apply for a spot in the frat's 1982 calendar. The calendar has sparked
much controversy on campus.
en who received invitations, she sug
gested that a few representatives
from the Women's Center discuss
the implications of the calendar as it
is now planned with the women in
vited to attend last night.
According to both Gyori and
MacKinnon these proposals were
not well-received.
According to MacKinnon, Gyori's
first priority is to sell the calendar and
whatever it takes to sell it makes it jus
tified. He also believes, according to
MacKinnon, that the only people
who would buy a calendar about
women are men. "And that cuts him
off from a large potential market,"
she said.
Gyori said, "We have a problem
because on the one hand there are
the feminist groups saying 'you can't
pick for looks/ and on the other
hand if it's going to be bought it's got
to be appealing. To be appealing to
our market, it's got to be attractive."
"I get a real sick feeling when I
think of women being shown as ob
jects to be used for men's pleasure,"
said Shelly Antonio at the meeting
Wednesday.
Last night when women walked
into the Phi Delt house, they re
ceived an informational sheet which
explained the format of the calendar,
the production process and which
stated that all profits would go to Stu
dents United for Rape Elimination
(SURE) — a student escort service.
Jeffrey Bird, last year's president
and a leader in the calendar project,
said the calendar was intended to
show "some pride in the student
body" and "to show that the old
sayings about Stanford were no long
er true."
Bird also said the fraternity was
trying to relax relations between men
and women here. "We're trying to
show that not everything about men
and women has to be seen in a sexist
light."
"I learned that there was another
body or faction on this campus that I
had no idea existed — not in that rad
ical or extreme a position," said
Gyori. "I guess I was sheltered. If
these attitudes are alive I think peo
ple should know,"he said.
