## Religion: believing or practicing? 
### Jim Tassopulos 
The following article is part two of a
two-part series on religious
organizations in the Stanford com
munity, aimed at providing a cohesive,
in-depth picture of the variety of
groups which are currently growing in
popularity among students. It begins
with a continuation of the listing of ma
jor religious organizations here.
Hillel
The Hillel Foundation, an umbrella
organization serving all Jewish students
on campus, is primarily a secular or
ganization. The group is led by Rabbi
Mark Cartun and emphasizes social ac
tivities and socio-political activities
which range from an Israeli action com
mittee to programs devoted to hunger
and social justice.
Despite these significant political in
terests, Hillel as a group does not argue
consistently for any one political per
spective. Cartun explains the heavy em
phasis on these issues by stating that
they reflect the strong interests of the
majority of Jewish students on campus.
Although Cartun is interested in
educating Jews about their religious
faith, he strongly de-emphasizes at
tempts to impose religion on members.
He does administer religious services
and teaches students how to perform
the rituals, but this is a very small part of
the group's purpose.
Cartun states, "Only about 20-25 per
cent of the membership of Hillel con
sider themselves significantly religious
in their faith . .. Hillel simply provides a
place for Jews to meet other Jews."
Each religious group in the Stanford
community differs in its perception of
student needs and in its approach to
fulfilling those needs.
Intervarsity, the Stanford Christian
Fellowship, and Campus Crusade for
Christ are eager to spread Christ's
message. Greg Read, leader of In
tervarsity, said that current members of
his group went door to door at the be
ginning of this year to explain their pro
gram to new students. Read added that
if a group becomes too popular, it may
not really be teaching "the gospel."
Group director of Campus Crusade,
Dave Horner, emphasized the intellec
tual evidence for the existence and res
urrection of Christ and was anxious to
"prove his case": "I want to make it
clear you don't have to put your brain
on the shelf to be a Christian," he said.
On the other end of the spectrum,
Dean Hamerton-Kelly stated that God
was something that "had to be argued
for." And Byron Bland, minister of the
United Christian Campus Ministry
(UCCM) acknowledged the large part
practicing Christianity plays in UCCM
activities and forums, but stressed social
enlightenment over religious trans
formation.
Most of the leaders agreed that Stan
ford students wanted something more
than their secular academic and social
experience.

Read stated, "Students are realizing
that the valuable Stanford degree and
the temporal success that it may bring
aren't all they're cracked up to be. Stu
dents are "looking for something to
prop up their lives. . . and give it mean
ing."
Horner commented on the strong
emphasis on material success at Stan
ford, but added that he thought stu
dents could become equally dis
illusioned with this success. He said, the
pressure to be successful prevents stu
dent's from being themselves. And
these same people are inwardly longing
for spiritual satisfaction.
Many of the leaders used the in
creased suicide rate as evidence of the
despair and loneliness present in some
students' lives. All emphasized counsel
ing services available to bolster a stu
dent's confidence and reassure him
that he is not alone with his problems.
All groups have varying perspectives
on the need for involvement in con
temporary socio-political issues.
Intervarsity and Campus Crusade are
almost completely apolitical. Horner
said, "We try not to be politically in
volved as a group, but "most members
are politically interested and con
cerned.
Horner's philosophy states that in
ternational problems cannot be solved
until problems within each individual
person are corrected. He states, "There
is something wrong in the heart of man.
Jesus forgives the garbage and changes
persons from the inside out. More and
more people must become this way
before the larger problems are solved."
The Episcopal Fellowship, the New
man Center, UCCM, Memorial
Church, and Hillel all actively sponsor
socio-political forums. With UCCM as
head sponsor, the first four groups are
presenting a lecture series which will
include such topics as "The MX Missile
System," and "Central American Refu
gee Resettlement."
Reverend Wiehe, director of the
Episcopal Fellowship at Stanford,
stated, "It's important to make people
aware of the anguishes of the world."
Religion does not exist in a vacuum and
must be applied to problems in the real
world, he said.
Another example of UCCM and
Hillel's commitment to social issues is
the draft counseling service both pro
vide.
Two years ago, Hillel led the drive for
Cambodian relief. Rabbi Mark Cartun
stated, "All members, no matter how
much they disagree on other matters
are terribly concerned with social jus
tice."
Dean Hamerton-Kelly agreed that in
volvement in social issues is important,
but not the most important function of
a church: "Preaching and teaching imp
inge on real life. I try to avoid artificial
distinctions between religion and soci
ety, but I do avoid combining religion

with party politics."
Another key issue arising from the
presence of religious activities on a col
lege campus involves the conflict be
tween complete commitment to a par
ticular religious faith and the values of
the university.
All leaders emphasized that everyone
enters a discussion with some presup
positions. Richard Lamb, a member of
Intervarsity who is majoring in chemical
engineering, stated that in his involve
ment with Intervarsity he has had to
face a purely secular, "be the best" view
of the world that conflicts with his per
sonal beliefs. "Christians are forced to
question . . . they are confronted the
most with a different position."
Read admitted that religious faith
could be a hindrance in some academic
pursuits, but he added that most mem
bers of Intervarsity have an intellectual
commitment. He stated, "The fact that
Christianity matters makes you want to
see if it holds water."
And Horner stated, "I encourage
people to take many types of classes
and look at even more material." He
added that many philosophy classes he
took in college were unobjective be
cause they looked at Christianity in a
purely symbolic way. Most classes were
biased against Biblical Christianity, ac
cording to Horner.
Reverend Wiehe had one complaint
concerning religious studies classes. He
stated that most classes explored re
ligion as an object which could be
sliced up. He emphasized that one
should not consider Christianity as rep
resented in books as the entire picture.
Father Eugene Boyle of the Catholic
Newman Center praised the high
caliber of teaching in Stanford's re
ligious studies department.
Professor Lee Yearley of the religious
studies department stressed that classes
deal with the more sophisticated and
reflective parts of Chrisfianity, as se*Â»n
in the writings of the great thinkers. He
added that it is very difficult to "show" a
student the nature and any
religion.
Yearley stated. "We attempt to find
some kind of balance between sympa
thy for the profundity of Christianity
and an honest dealing with the serious
problems of any system of thought ad
dressing the problems of life."
Yearley stressed that this can be dif
ficult for students. He stated, "To some
degree, students are going to have to al
low their religious ideas to come under
the same scrutiny as socio-political
ideas . . . you have to think deeply and
well about things you care about."
Although Yearley made clear he
knew of no simplistic bias among the
teachers in the department, he'said that
where the emphasis is on critical
analysis, students can open themselves
up to more criticism if they strongly ad
vocate one view without any criticism.

He stressed that he would nev
er downgrade anyone for in
telligently advocating a certain
world view.
To summarize the differences
among the different groups on
campus, one can compare the
various reactions to the ques
tion: "Can one live a mean
ingful, moral, and valuable life
without being a Christian?"

Read responded, "The death
of Jesus doesn't make sense to
me if there is any other way."
He quoted Kierkegaard saying
"If most people saw what they
were without Christ, the only
choice would be suicide."
Horner said that meaning or
value may be possible without
Christ, but people can only be
truly satisfied after they have
admitted Christ into their lives.
In terms of what God values, all

fall short and need Christ for
redemption, he added.
Bland of UCCM had a very dif
ferent view: "Christian belief is
a reality out there. .. whatit of
fers does not need to be
pushed. Christian identity has
much to offer, but others must
be respected. It's definitely
possible to be fulfilled without
Christ."
Dean Hamerton-Kelly re
sponded: "There is no reliable
correlation between the con
fession of Christ and the good
life or the truth or salvation. I
would like to see the whole
world honestly devoted to
God, but I'm happy to rejoice
in the good, decent, hon
orable, and humane people
who do not make religious
confession"
