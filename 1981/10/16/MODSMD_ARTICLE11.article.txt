# Taking care of business

To most undergraduates, the Business School
at Stanford represents one of the great unex
plored territories of our time. Few under
graduates have infiltrated the veil of aloofness
that surrounds our Business School and as a re
sult we have lost touch with some of the most
promising minds on the Farm.
When most of us think about biz school stu
dents, we create a picture of a group of money
loving young conservatives, resplendentin their
flawless haircuts and three-piece suits. But, as
with most stereotypes, this picture simply
doesn't hold up.
Dan Spiegelman, afirst-year business student,
proves that biz grads are much like any other

'There is no free time—only
study time and necessity
time. In your free time you
do anything that keeps you
from having to use your
mind, anything that frees you
from thinking'—John Alber,
first-year student at Sanford
Business School

students at Stanford. Not only does he dress in
striped rugby shirt and jeans, but he also goes
out on weekends.
"So far it hasn't been as hard as everyone said
it would be," Spiegelman says, referring to the
Business School. "I'm really glad I chose Stanford
. . . it's like a country club here, with its own golf
course, tennis courts, palm trees . . . the at
mosphere is great."
Spiegelman's free time is split between athlet
ics, working out and taking in parties. Once he
is finished with his studies here, he plans to enter
the managing or planning department of a cor
poration.
According to Spiegelman, the lack of com
munication between graduate and under
gaduate students is due to the fact that "there
aren't many natural contacts. Grads and under
grads don't take classes together, and so they
don't usually interact."
For most business grad students, the ultimate
goal is the MBA, or Master of Business Adminis
tration. To achieve the MBA, a biz student must
gain 108 units in two years.
Typically, a student will earn 60 units in the
first year and 48 in the second. 44 of these first
year units represent required- courses, which
leaves only 16 units for electives, inside or out
side the department. Understandably, biz stu
dents do a lot of hard work.
"There is no free time — only study time and
necessity time," says John Alber, afirst-yearbusi
ness student. "In your free time you do anything
that keeps you from having to use your mind,
anything that frees you from thinking. When I
watch T.V., I watch the screen without concen
trating on what's going on so that I can escape
from thought."

If Alber's picture of academic life is somewhat
grim, at least he does not say that it is without en
joyment. "This is probably the hardest and most
fun experience I will ever go through," he says.
"The material is fascinating — it's really a great
challenge."
The core curriculum of the Business Schoolis
designed to develop an understanding in four
general areas: First is human behavior or how
people will react to different organizational
structures and situations. Second is the external
business environment, focusing on the econo
my and society. The third area deals with man
agement problems in accounting, finance and
marketing. Finally, the business student must
develop skills in the application of qualitative
techniques, including computer methods, to
business problems.
In the long run, all this hard work seems to
prove lucrative as well as worthwhile. Stanford's
Graduate School of Business has.been rated by
MBA Magazine as being the best of its kind in
the country, deposing long-time business capi
tal Harvard.
And holders of a Stanford MBA are in de
mand. 36 percent of the class of '81 was hired by
manufacturing companies soon after gradu
ation, with another 26 percent joining financial
services firms and 21 percent joining consulting
firms. If it seems that these jobs would prove too
tedious and/or demanding, consider that the
starting salaries for these jobs range from $20,000
to $40,000 per year, with the median around
$30,000. This makes things somewhat more ap
petizing.
But who are these soon-to-be-rich individ
uals? Most of them are graduates of an ac
credited college or university with such majors
as social sciences, humanities, economics, engi
neering, science, and business. No specific ma
jor, minimum academic average, or minimum
GMAT test score is required for admission into
the Stanford Business School.
The class of 1981 was drawn from 145 colleges
and universities in 28 countries. Out of 5024 ap
plicants for that class, only 309 were accepted.
Of these, 56 were foreign students and 37 were
ethnic minorities.
Another fallacy in the stereotypical picture of
the average business student is that, almost in
variably, the student is a man. In actuality, 25
percent of the students in the class of '81s MBA
program were women.
Abby Homans, a second year graduate stu
dent, is an officer in the "Women in Man
agement" program at the Business School. The
program, according to Homans, was formed ten
years agowhen the numberof women attending
the biz school started to rise.
Homans cites two purposes of "Women in
Management." "First, it allows women here to
get to know each other and the female faculty.
Second, it helps women explore career options
in business." According to Homans, the career
opportunities for women in business increase
constantly in importance.
It is encouraging to know that even if our foot
ball team is rather mediocre, and our weather is
completely unpredictable, our business school
is the best around.
