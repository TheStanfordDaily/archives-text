For an academic community which thrives on
powerful visions and new waysof looking at the
world, the loss of Anthropology Prof. Michelle
Rosaldo seems particularly cruel.
Rosaldo, who died in a hiking accident last
weekend in the Philippines, leaves behind her a
family, including small children, and many
colleagues, students and other friends within
the University who were deeply touched by her
sensitivity and passion. Her passing is to them all
the more tragic.
But she has also left behind a powerful voice
which asked difficult questions and always
challenged us to confront different ways of
approaching our short time on earth. In
addition to her own successful work in
anthropology, she was a driving force behind
both the Center for Research on Women and
the Feminist Studies Program, and was the
associate editor of Signs, the national scholarly
journal on women and society.

In a society often given to assigning roles to
human beings based on their sex, race, age or
other such characteristics, she dared to question
the basis of many of those distinctions, and she
inspired many of those around hertodothe
same.
She set other examples no less important.
Speakers at the memorial gathering at Stanford
on Tuesday emphasized her ability to tie the
threads of her life into one, an ability rare and
prized among those subject to the pressures of
an academic environment. Those who knew her
best knew that she was the same person at home
as she was in school and everywhere else; she
left no part of her life neglected.
Finally, although her passing is mourned, her
example remains strong.One person said
Tuesday that, as any good teacher does, Shelly
Rosaldo started a lot of balls rolling while she
was here. Those balls will continue to roll.
