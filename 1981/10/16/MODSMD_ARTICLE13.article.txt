# Dispose of mascot pest
## 
### 
There's a pest on campus which makes it's
annual appearance each fall when the
opportunity arises to annoy an audience of
70,000 or 80,000 at a home football game.
This pest does not represent the economic
threat posed by the Mediterranean fruit fly or
the irritation of ants in Manzanita Park, but it
nonetheless serves to revive old controversies
and waste a good amount of time better
devoted to more timely issues.
Sure enough, the pest made its annual
appearance last Saturday during halftime of the
Stanford-UCLA game, when the "mascot issue"
once again stained an otherwise enjoyable day
for Stanford fans.
The pest is not a single person or group;
rather, it is embodied in the form of "Chief
Spotted Wolf," who rode the pinto pony onto
the field, and the allegedly 2000-strong
association which is unable or unwilling to
comprehend the offense which native
Americans understandably take in having their
race used and misused as a mascot.
In the words of University President Donald
Kennedy, theevent itself wassimply "not that
big a deal."
But because even an innocuous housefly will
continue to annoy unless it either goes away or
is swatted, the University has acted correctly in

turning over to the District Attorney's office
evidence regarding the unauthorized
trespassing of the Indian and the horse onto the
field Saturday, which apparently was
accomplished through forged field passesand a
ruse outside the gate.
As long as the Indian symbol continues to
make its annual appearance and provoke
further discussion of thefeasiblity or
infeasibility of its return to the University, the
matter will not die. We are disappointed that
security was so easily circumvented in this case.
The event is, rightly, "not that big a deal," but
this kind of situation does nothing but
perpetuate the problem. Apparently the
security force also needs to be made more
aware of the necessity of keeping unauthorized
persons off the playing field.
As one spectator at Statuday's game noted,
"They'll pick up and throw out some 10-year
old for trying to get a player's autograph, but
they let that guy on, horseand all."
We urge the University to help the Stanford
community be rid of this pest by keeping
unauthorized persons off the playing field at
football games. And we support the added swat
necessitated by this violation of the law and call
for prosecution of Chief Spotted Wolf and
others responsible <or forging the passes.
