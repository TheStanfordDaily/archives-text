## Sadat remains hero to most Egyptians 
### 
We were disturbed and disap
pointed at the letter (Daily, Oct. 12)
titled "Sadat never a hero to Egyp
tians, Arab Neighbors". The letter
was signed by the Arab Student As
sociation at Stanford (ASAS). We feel
that ASAS should not speak on behalf
of the Egyptians, without being in
real contact with the events in Egypt,
nor the Egyptians at Stanford. As
Egyptians, we feel that we are closer
to the sentiments and opinions of the
Egyptian people, than any non-Egyp
tian ASAS spokesperson would be.
Although some Egyptians do not
necessai ily agree with some of his in
ternal policies, Anwar El Sadat re
mains a hero to most of the Egyptian
people. He will always remain the
hero of the October 1973 war, in
which the Egyptians, together with
their other Arab neighbors, regained
their pride after the humiliating de
feat in 1967 during Nasser's time. We
believe that war put Egypt and its oth
er Arab neighbors in a position of
strength. It is that moral victory
which changed the image of Arabs as
people not able to defend them
selves, one which enabled them to
pursue a solution to the Middle East
problem by peaceful means.
Let us not forget that Egypt paid
with the blood of its people, and its
ailing economy to achieve this gain.
In 1974, the year after the October
war, Egypt, a poor country of 40 mil
lion, paid 33.9 percent of its GNP for
defense. The oil-rich Arab states in
that same year paid less than 6 per
cent of their GNP for defense. Those
same countries had a large influx of

revenues, in the wake of the dramatic
oil price increases, which would not
have occurred without the October
1973 war. There is a difference be
tween paying nominal monies and
lip service to a cause, and between
giving up a large part of oneself for it.
We think it is the right of Egypt to
choose its way in war and peace
when it is disproportionately bearing
the largest burden. Egypt has proven
that it can wage war, but it has pre
ferred to wage peace. It has chosen
peace due to conviction and
strength, not weakness. It is also the
prerogative of the Egyptian people to
speak for themselves. When Anwar El
Sadat waged peace, he was express
ing the will of the Egyptian people.

Go home, be happy
With the death last week of Anwar
Sadat, the world has lost a leader in a
region of the world where, sadly, to
lerance and understanding are gen
erally an afterthought, not a way of
life.
Therefore, it causes me concern
when I read statements by the Arab
Student Association at Stanford (Dai
ly,, Oct 12.), that Sadat's "demise has
been a source of happiness and relief
in his own country and many other
places."
If that is the feeling of Stanford's
Arab student population, particularly
within a community of scholars,
might I suggest they fold their tents
and fly themselves home where they
can be happy and relaxed, rather
than sitting in the California sun, oc
cupying classroom space we could
use at our academic institutions, paid
for by patient, long-suffering Ameri
cans through our support of the
Agency for International Develop
ment?

As one who for several years was at
Oxford, attached to Christ Church
and Magdalen, and as a member of
the Stanford faculty since 1941, I was
surprised and disappointed that Ox
ford did not welcome with en
thusiasm the prospect of a Stanford
"campus" there. Joe Rodota's col

umn (Daily, Oct. 13) explains why.
The problem is not simply at
Cliveden. I recall visiting the Vienna
"campus" with my wife. We entered
the lounge where students were sit
ting. Instead of getting up to greet us
— I knew some of them — they re
mained seated, said "Hi!" and did
not even invite us to sit down. They
were simply louts.
Unfortunately it is a national
phenomenon. When I was in the So
viet Union lecturing at the Academy
of Sciences, I was being taken around
one of the great palaces of Leningrad
when a group of American students
entered, looking like unmade beds.
It was an incredible sight. One of my
hosts asked angrily: "Who are these
so-called students who go around
looking like tramps?"
Below the Joe Rodota article is a
letter about the Stanford Band, de
scribed as incomparably classless. Dr.
Milton Bonzell should be thanked
for calling a lout a lout.
One excuse might be to say that
this loutishness is a universal
phenomenon today among students.
There is some truth in this, but there
is no reason why Stanford should be
pre-eminent. As Editor of the World
Affairs Report I study carefully the
Soviet press and that of other coun
tries to analyze the image of America.
It is an ugly image, and our univer
sities should make every effort to
change it. It is perhaps the greatest
contribution they could make to the
preservation of peace.

We were disturbed and disap
pointed at the letter (Daily, Oct. 12)
titled "Sadat never a hero to Egyp
tians, Arab Neighbors". The letter
was signed by the Arab Student As
sociation at Stanford (ASAS). We feel
that ASAS should not speak on behalf
of the Egyptians, without being in
real contact with the events in Egypt,
nor the Egyptians at Stanford. As
Egyptians, we feel that we are closer
to the sentiments and opinions of the
Egyptian people, than any non-Egyp
tian ASAS spokesperson would be.
Although some Egyptians do not
necessai ily agree with some of his in
ternal policies, Anwar El Sadat re
mains a hero to most of the Egyptian
people. He will always remain the
hero of the October 1973 war, in
which the Egyptians, together with
their other Arab neighbors, regained
their pride after the humiliating de
feat in 1967 during Nasser's time. We
believe that war put Egypt and its oth
er Arab neighbors in a position of
strength. It is that moral victory
which changed the image of Arabs as
people not able to defend them
selves, one which enabled them to
pursue a solution to the Middle East
problem by peaceful means.
Let us not forget that Egypt paid
with the blood of its people, and its
ailing economy to achieve this gain.
In 1974, the year after the October
war, Egypt, a poor country of 40 mil
lion, paid 33.9 percent of its GNP for
defense. The oil-rich Arab states in
that same year paid less than 6 per
cent of their GNP for defense. Those
same countries had a large influx of

revenues, in the wake of the dramatic
oil price increases, which would not
have occurred without the October
1973 war. There is a difference be
tween paying nominal monies and
lip service to a cause, and between
giving up a large part of oneself for it.
We think it is the right of Egypt to
choose its way in war and peace
when it is disproportionately bearing
the largest burden. Egypt has proven
that it can wage war, but it has pre
ferred to wage peace. It has chosen
peace due to conviction and
strength, not weakness. It is also the
prerogative of the Egyptian people to
speak for themselves. When Anwar El
Sadat waged peace, he was express
ing the will of the Egyptian people.

Go home, be happy
With the death last week of Anwar
Sadat, the world has lost a leader in a
region of the world where, sadly, to
lerance and understanding are gen
erally an afterthought, not a way of
life.
Therefore, it causes me concern
when I read statements by the Arab
Student Association at Stanford (Dai
ly,, Oct 12.), that Sadat's "demise has
been a source of happiness and relief
in his own country and many other
places."
If that is the feeling of Stanford's
Arab student population, particularly
within a community of scholars,
might I suggest they fold their tents
and fly themselves home where they
can be happy and relaxed, rather
than sitting in the California sun, oc
cupying classroom space we could
use at our academic institutions, paid
for by patient, long-suffering Ameri
cans through our support of the
Agency for International Develop
ment?

As one who for several years was at
Oxford, attached to Christ Church
and Magdalen, and as a member of
the Stanford faculty since 1941, I was
surprised and disappointed that Ox
ford did not welcome with en
thusiasm the prospect of a Stanford
"campus" there. Joe Rodota's col

umn (Daily, Oct. 13) explains why.
The problem is not simply at
Cliveden. I recall visiting the Vienna
"campus" with my wife. We entered
the lounge where students were sit
ting. Instead of getting up to greet us
— I knew some of them — they re
mained seated, said "Hi!" and did
not even invite us to sit down. They
were simply louts.
Unfortunately it is a national
phenomenon. When I was in the So
viet Union lecturing at the Academy
of Sciences, I was being taken around
one of the great palaces of Leningrad
when a group of American students
entered, looking like unmade beds.
It was an incredible sight. One of my
hosts asked angrily: "Who are these
so-called students who go around
looking like tramps?"
Below the Joe Rodota article is a
letter about the Stanford Band, de
scribed as incomparably classless. Dr.
Milton Bonzell should be thanked
for calling a lout a lout.
One excuse might be to say that
this loutishness is a universal
phenomenon today among students.
There is some truth in this, but there
is no reason why Stanford should be
pre-eminent. As Editor of the World
Affairs Report I study carefully the
Soviet press and that of other coun
tries to analyze the image of America.
It is an ugly image, and our univer
sities should make every effort to
change it. It is perhaps the greatest
contribution they could make to the
preservation of peace.
