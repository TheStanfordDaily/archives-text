## Band expresses student opinions 
### 
My worries about the Stanford
Band began a few weeks ago when I
heard President Donald Kennedy
speak at an informal gathering at
Manzanita Park. When asked what
he thought of the Band, President
Kennedy replied that he felt the Band
had lost the "old humor," or that, at
best, the Band's displays of this hu
mor were few and far between. Later,
I remember, I could have kicked my
self for not saying anything at that
point, because in truth I had thought
the Band's Ohio State pre-game and
half-time shows were as hilarious as
ever and in good spirit.
At last weekend's game with
UCLA, I felt the need to defend the
group again because I sensed a de
flated ego on the part of the Band.
But it was the anger expressed in Dr.
Milton Bonzell's letter (Daily, Oct.
13) that finally convinced me some
thing needed to be said on its behalf.
Dr. Bonzell's viewpoint can be
matched by hundreds of other alum
ni, and that is at the root of the Band's
problem. I do not disagree with the
opinion that something needs to be

done to improve and increase the
humor of the Band, but I cannot dis
miss it, as Bonzell does, as a "disgrace
and embarrassment to the University
and its alumni."
I must admit, upon beginning to
read his letter, I had to look at the
name at the bottom just to make sure
it hadn't been written by one of my
parents. I've been hearing them
complain about "The Stanford Band"
for years. But such is the predicament
that first created the Stanford Band.
What originally began as a rebellion
against the establishment and estab
lished forms of marching bands sud
denly rose in popularity until it be
came a celebrated part of Stanford.
Now, however, the sentiment of the
alumni has changed, and once again
there seems to be a "generation gap"
between alurnni and students.
What Bonzell and other alumni
don't understand, it seems, is that the
Band is not theirs alone; in fact, the
Band is very much ours as students of
this university. What I value most
about the Band is that it is not merely
for entertainment, but also for ex
pression of the students' opinions.
No other band in the country at
tempts to comment on foreign policy
or the state of affairs at home. No
other band could because they are
too busy shaping meaningless de
signs and patterns on the football
field. I, myself, would rather be
spoken to and accordingly forced to
react, whether it be negatively or
positively. If anyone thinks the Band
can be tamed into the geometric rig
idness of other collegiate bands,
they're wrong.
As far as how their music sounds,
Dr. Bonzell completely misses the
point of the Stanford Band. Their mu
sic was never meant to be beautiful
or polished; it never has been nor
will it ever be. What is so wonderful
about the music the band plays is that
it is so infectious. I guess you have to
be in San Francisco on the night
before Big Game, pressed against
hundreds of joyous Stanford stu
dents at the rally, all dancing to that
"incomparable" rock and 1011 only

the Stanford Band can produce. The
exhilaration I feel when the base
drum pumps rhythm into my veins
cannot be even remotely matched by
the stagnant beat of other bands.
And as for the Band's performance of
the "National Anthem," I still find it
stirring, and increasingly so with each
time I hear it played. I cannot im
agine it being otherwise.
What I hope to express on behalf
of the Band is not so much that I find
Dr. Bonzell completely wrong in his
comment on the Band. There is room
for improvement in any organiza
tion. But I would like to emphasize
that the Band is created by and
belongs to the students, and it is not
there simply for the pleasure of the
alumni at tailgates and games. The
Band would love to entertain them
What a strange mixture of sadness
and frustration I felt for the alumni
when the Indian once again rode
onto the field at halftime last week
end. The act of trying to impose an
out-dated and unwanted figure
upon the student body was so futile,
despite the nostalgic beauty of the
Indian and his pony prancing onto
the field.
The dilemma of the Stanford Band
is similar to that of the Indian. Just as
the Stanford mascot dilemma cannot
be resolved by the re-instatement of
the Indian, neither can the Band's
dilemma be resolved by forcing it
into the old style of a conventional
college band. I hope that despite its
flaws and the disdain of those of
fended by them, the Stanford Band
will survive the conservative trend of
our society toward conformity and
continue to exist as a dynamic or
ganization for student expression
and enjoyment. That "old humor" of
the Stanford Band will always stem
from its absurdity and its refusal to
conform. As Herb Caen once com
mented (but surely now denies),
"Thank God for the Stanford Band!"
And for Pete's sake, don't ever let
that music stop.
