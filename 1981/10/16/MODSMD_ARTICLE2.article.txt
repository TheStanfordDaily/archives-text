# Emphasis on small companies
## Trustees hire overseas investment firm 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees approved Monday the ap
pointment of G. T. Management Ltd., a British in
vestment firm, as the University's international in
vestment manager. This decison is the most recent
example of what Director of Investment Rodney
Adams calls "a continuum" of improvements in in
vestment policy, dating back to the strategic plan
ning done with the help of the Graduate School of
Business in the mid-19705.
Upon the recommendation of the Committee
on Investments, the Board of Trustees also ap
proved changes in the allocation of endowment
investment assets. The board shifted 7.7 percent of
the total endowment investment pool — approx
imatelys6o million — from fixed income invest
ment holdings to equity investment holdings.
This means the University is moving more heav
ily into the stock market. Also, the University will
nearly double its international investments and
will begin investing in smaller, less prominent
companies.
These changes "move the Stanford endowment
to a very innovative limit," said Adams. "This is a
less conservative, more agressive stance. It's a sig

nificant step," he said.
G.T. has been allotted $50 million to invest, but
has initially been given $15 million as an experi
ment, the committee report said.
Harvard University, Yale University and
Dartmouth College have also implemented similar
changes in endowment policy, Adams said. "We
four tend to have led the way for endowment
funds in the past four years," he said.
"We believe we can increase the expected real
return by about one percent. If we are successful,
we will obtain an added return of $5 to 7 million on
the endowment," Adams said.
Adams explained that a committee had been
working on rewriting the investment guidelines
since January and approved a new set of guidelines
in June. According the next step was to
findan investment managementfirm which would
work well with the new guidelines.
In selecting an investment manager, the Univer
sity looked for an international portfolio, diver
sification, research capabilities and familiarity with
quantitative, analytical and portfolio management
techniques, according to the report of the Com
mittee on Investments.
The committee also examined the investment

performance records of several companies before
selecting G. T. Management. During the five-year
period ending i960, G.T. global accounts returned
approximately 22 percent compounded, com
pared with a "World Index" return of 14.7 percent.
Performance records for the other firms con
sidered by Stanford were unavailable.
"We wanted a firm that is very knowledgeable
about countries that are growing faster than the
U. 5.," Adams said.
He said he expected to see investment in coun
tries such as Japan, Australia, West Germany and
the United Kingdom. Regarding the possibility of
investments in Third World countries, Adams said
"There just doesn't appear to be the mechanism.
"There's little possibility for investment in the
Middle East." Middle Eastern countries are "out
investing in America,"he said.
"There's always a sense that we should buy
American (stock), and we've endeavored to over
come the natural proclivities that we've had to be
more isolationist," Adams said. He said the issue of
foreign investment was never dealt with on a moral
or ethical basis, but was examined in terms of com
prehending foreign markets.
