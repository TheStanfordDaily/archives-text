# Drug fights chemotherapynausea

New York â€” Medical researchers re
ported Wednesday that they have been
able to control vomiting in most cancer pa
tients treated with a widely used
chemotherapy agent whose side effects
are so sickening it makes some people stay
away from the doctor.
Physicians at Memorial-Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center in New York City said the
experimental drug metoclopramide in
high doses is a "safe and effective" treat
ment for nausea triggered by the powerful
anti-cancer agent cisplatin. Nausea and
vomiting are the most frequent and de
bilitating reactions to chemotherapy.
"I think metoclopramide will be helpful
in reducing this most difficult problem,"
said Dr. Richard Gralla, who headed the
Memorial study team. He said the medi
cine, rejected years ago because it seemed
ineffective, began working after doctors
used it at 10 times its normal dosage. Mild
sedation was the most frequent side effect.
"It is not the last word," Gralla said. "More
work will be needed to see if it is effective
against other agents. But it is much more
helpful than anything we have used."
The study team said the major drawback
of the drug, which is still being in
vestigated and so unavailable for general

use, is that it takes too long to be used on
outpatients. Patients must spend hours re
ceiving the drug intravenously.
THC, the active ingredient of marijuana,
and some anti-nausea drugs have been
useful in controlling nausea associated
with some anti-cancer drugs. But they do
not work against cisplatin and other
stronger agents. Cisplatin, used alone or in
combination with other agents, has a high
success rate in curing cancer of the tes
ticles and ovaries. It also is used, although
with lesser effectiveness, with cancer of
the bladder and lung and with tumors of
the head and neck.
. However, it is so powerful, many cannot
tolerate it. At some centers, as many as half
the patients taking cisplatin, sometimes
called "the most dreaded of all the drugs"
taken by cancer patients, miss appoint
ments or delay therapy. Says Dr. John
Laszlo of Duke Medical Center: "The un
willingness of some of these patients to
subject themselves repeatedly to days of
severe nausea and vomiting . .. yiay cost
them the chance for cure."
In a randomized study reported in
Wednesday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, Gralla said 21 patients
on intravenous metoclopromide had a

mean total of onlyoneepisodeof vomiting
after their monthly chemotherapy treat
ment. That compared with a mean number
of 12 vomiting spells for those taking
chlorperazine (Compazine), a common
anti-nausea drug, and 10.5 for those taking
a placebo.
Although the study was not a large one,
Gralla said it has been extended now to 200
patients. About 40 percent had no vomit
ing spells. Another 40 percent had a major
reduction in vomiting attacks. The remain
ing 20 percent did not respond.
Doctors do not know precisely how the
drug works. But Gralla said some re
searchers believe it blocks receptors in the
brain that pick up the drug in the blood
stream and trigger the nervous system's
vomiting response. Another theory is that
metoclopramide stops the stomach from
swelling, the first step in vomiting, thus
cutting short the reaction chain.
Officials of the National Cancer Institute
could not be reached for comment, but
other experts said the study appeared to
be an important step in the future control
of anti-cancer agents. "It seems evident
that the stage is set for rapid progess in
anti-emitic anti-nausea therapy," Duke's
Laszlo said.
