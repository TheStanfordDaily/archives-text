# Hostages refuse to drop Iran suit
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” A group of
former U.S. hostages in Iran
said they will pursue their $5
million damage suit against
Iran because the Iranian gov
ernment should be held ac
countable for its actions against
U.S. Embassy personnel.
The lawsuit was filed in Los
Angeles last February by Sgt.
John McKeel, and has now
been joined by 11 other former
hostages. The first hearing is
scheduled in federal court in
Los Angeles on Oct. 26.
Several former hostages said

at a press conference that they
joined in the lawsuit after
much thought because they
felt their constitutional rights
had been abrogated by the
agreement signed with Iran by
the U.S. government that led to
their release last January after
444 days in captivity.
That agreement barred any
grievance claims against Iran
by the former U.S. hostages in
U.S. courts. It also canceled any
attachments against Iranian as
sets in the United States and
transferred the handling of
claims by U.S. firms to an in
ternational tribunal.

The dozen men now joined
in the suit, half of them military
personnel, say they have a right
to sue for damages despite the
agreement.
"The government of Iran has
to answer for the acts of ter
rorism it allowed to occur,"
said William Royer, now a State
Department employee in the
capital. "I want to see the gov
ernment of Iran held accoun
table."
Retired Army Col. Charles
Scott, of Stone Mountain, Ga.,
said he had no ax to grind with
former President Jimmy Carter
over the agreement. "He did

what was necessary to get us re
leased."
Last June, the Supreme
Court upheld the validity of the
U.S. agreement with Iran. Davis
maintained, however, that the
ruling dealt only with com
mercial claims, and did not ad
dress the issue of damage suits
by former hostages.
"I feel we just can't let this
thing go away," said returned
hostage Alan Golacinski,
former security officer at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran, and
now assigned to the U.S. War
College. "There is a great deal
of principle involved here."
