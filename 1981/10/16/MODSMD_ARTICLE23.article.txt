# Watt ouster planned
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — The Sierra
Club has scheduled a lobbying
assault on Washington next
week in its effort to persuade
President Ronald Reagan to
fire Secretary of the Interior
James Watt — but the well
planned assault is supposed to
look like a spontaneous
grassroots politcal effort.
An eight-page "confiden
tial" memo circulated to Sierra
Club chapters throughout the
country from the club's San
Francisco headquarters lays
out detailed plans for achiev
ing maximum political and me
dia impact from the Washing
ton venture while at the same
time "deliberately pushing our
image as a grassroots political
force."
The memo, a copy of which
was obtained by the Los Angel
es Times, also carries the ad
monition that the plan remain
"absolutely confidential" lest
Watt and his supporters learn
of it in advance and "take
counteraction which could se
riously blunt the political and
media impact we are seeking."
The idea is for club members
from throughout the country
to gather in Washington on
Monday and deliver to Con
gress petitions with at least a
million signatures calling for

Watt's ouster. The million-sig
nature goal was reached last
week.
'Planning media impact'
"Politically, this kind of na
tional gathering of political ac
tivists from each chapter in
Washington, D.C., will be a first
for the Sierra Club,"says the
memo, which was drafted last
August by Sierra Club Presi
dent Joe Fontaine and the
club's federal affairs director,
Doug Scott. "It can have major
lobbying impact. It is an un
paralleled opportunity to cap
the existing impact of our 'Re
place Watt' campaign with a
major push in Washington,
D.C., heavly emphasizing the
unique grassroots political
strength of the Sierra Club!"
The memo lays out strategy
for everything from carefully
orchestrated airport press con
ferences as club members de
part their home cities to plans
for arrival in Washington and
breakfasts or lunches with re
porters to ensure a second
wave of publicity. It envisions
stories that declare, "Mighty
nationwide Sierra Club as
sembles volunteer leaders in
Washington with 1 million-plus
petitions against Watt poli
cies."
The local chapters are told
that their airport press con

ferences should be staged to
assure maximum television
coverage and should include
"a nice big throng of club folks
and others to cheer at every
anti-Watt statement and to
conduct a kind of 'pep rally' for
your chapter representative as
he or she departs."
The timing of the press con
ferences, the memo says,
"should guarantee big play in
Saturday evening papers and
on Saturday evening television,
and in Sunday papers. It also
sends a signal, through the me
dia coverage, to your con
gressional delegation that you
are comming — and that the
story of your presentation of
the petitions in Washington,
D.C., will be getting significant
press coverage at home, as a
follow-up to the airport rally
story."
Scott said in a telephone in
terview Wednesday that he
had no apologies for the cloak
and-dagger nature of the
memo and its obvious thrust at
mass media manipulation.
"We're making an effort to
show that the story of the pub
lic revulsion over Watt and his
policies is as thoroughly pre
sented in every medium of
communication as we can," he
said.

gress petitions with at least a
million signatures calling for

Watt's ouster. The million-sig
nature goal was reached last
week.
'Planning media impact'
"Politically, this kind of na
tional gathering of political ac
tivists from each chapter in
Washington, D.C., will be a first
for the Sierra Club,"says the
memo, which was drafted last
August by Sierra Club Presi
dent Joe Fontaine and the
club's federal affairs director,
Doug Scott. "It can have major
lobbying impact. It is an un
paralleled opportunity to cap
the existing impact of our 'Re
place Watt' campaign with a
major push in Washington,
D.C., heavly emphasizing the
unique grassroots political
strength of the Sierra Club!"
The memo lays out strategy
for everything from carefully
orchestrated airport press con
ferences as club members de
part their home cities to plans
for arrival in Washington and
breakfasts or lunches with re
porters to ensure a second
wave of publicity. It envisions
stories that declare, "Mighty
nationwide Sierra Club as
sembles volunteer leaders in
Washington with 1 million-plus
petitions against Watt poli
cies."
The local chapters are told
that their airport press con

ferences should be staged to
assure maximum television
coverage and should include
"a nice big throng of club folks
and others to cheer at every
anti-Watt statement and to
conduct a kind of 'pep rally' for
your chapter representative as
he or she departs."
The timing of the press con
ferences, the memo says,
"should guarantee big play in
Saturday evening papers and
on Saturday evening television,
and in Sunday papers. It also
sends a signal, through the me
dia coverage, to your con
gressional delegation that you
are comming — and that the
story of your presentation of
the petitions in Washington,
D.C., will be getting significant
press coverage at home, as a
follow-up to the airport rally
story."
Scott said in a telephone in
terview Wednesday that he
had no apologies for the cloak
and-dagger nature of the
memo and its obvious thrust at
mass media manipulation.
"We're making an effort to
show that the story of the pub
lic revulsion over Watt and his
policies is as thoroughly pre
sented in every medium of
communication as we can," he
said.
