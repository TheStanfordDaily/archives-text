New York — The U.S. economy is snared in a
world of Catch-22 situations, "a sort of paradox
wherein one set of events is contradicted by an
other," says Henry Kaufman, Wall Street econo
mist.
"Escapes, if any, are few and hold real prob
lems," he told a meeting of financial executives.
"The chances of going wrong in anything we do
are many." Solutions create problems; to fill a
hole you dig another.
Said the man "the street" considers an eco
nomic seer: "The best-intended decisions may
produce the wrong results; measures of relief
for some may produce unanticipated pain for
others."
Corporations and banks are strapped for cred
it. Liquidity, or the availability of assets quickly
convertible to cash, in some cases may be a
myth, dependent on further short-term borrow
ing, he suggested.
"Indeed, a noose is tightening around the
credit markets,"and interest rates — now falling
— will rise again, he said.
He expressed displeasure with President
Ronald Reagan's approach to economic prob
lems. It would have been preferable, he said, to
have had "a sharp thrust to a balanced budget in
fiscal 1982," plus tax cuts limited to spurring in
vestments, and a monetary policy underscored
with measures to "foster a greater perception of
risk by financial intermediaries."
But the problems run deeper, said Kaufman.
At the beginning of his address — to a meeting
here of the Financial Executives Institute he
laid it on the line in unmistakably clear observa

tion.
"For the moment," he said, "it is sufficient to
say that in the past few decades, our consump
tion and life style have overwhelmed our in
dustrial and innovative zeal."
Kaufman's influence — on securities prices,
corporate decisions, and government policy —
can be vast. His speech made poor entertain
ment:
— "The high level of interest rates, combined
with the rapid growth of the variable interest
rate costs structure of business, is taking its toll
on corporate profits."
— "The interest expense of nonfinancial cor
porations accounted for 30 percent of profits
before taxes in the first half of 1981. This ratio av
eraged 25 percent in the 1970s and only 19 per
cent in the 19605."
— "Unfortunately," he told the financial ex
ecutives, "some pain wiil continue to be in
flicted on the economy and credit markets. We
have backed ourselves into a difficult corner."
Now, he said, the economy has a clash of fiscal
stimulus and "monetary restraint that en
courages clashes in the markets, resulting in ec
onomic sputter and spurt and even running the
risk of more dangerous economic and financial
consequences."
Kaufman doesn't seek to encourage. He seeks
to be realistic. If his speech was not entertaining
it was because the economy isn't encouraging.
To seek entertainment from today's economy,
he seemed to say, was to kid yourself and laugh
at yourself.
