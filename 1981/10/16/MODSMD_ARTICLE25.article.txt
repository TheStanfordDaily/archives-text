# Cult of 'The Way' growing and getting military membership
## 
### Washington Post 
New Knoxville, Ohio — Hannah Janney, who grew up
on a farm in northern Virginia, remembers feeling
amazed the first time she saw The Way International
headquarters rising out of the relentlessly flat Mid
western landscape. Amid endless miles of cornfields
were meticulous gardens, man-made ponds, gurgling
white marble fountains and buildings so freshly painted
they gleamed under the summer sun.
Most impressive, Janney recalls, was the sight of 16,000
brothers and sisters who had flocked to this tiny hamlet
outside Dayton for an annual week-long festival, called
The Rock of Ages. Like Janney, they were devout mem
bers of The Way, a little-known fundamentalist Christian
sect, which some theologians believe to be the nation's
second largest cult.
The Way now has an estimated 40,000 followers —
more than Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
"Everybody thinks the Moonies are the big cult because
they've gotten the lion's share of publicity, but the Way is
much bigger and more pervasive," says Lowell Streiker,
director of San Francisco'santi-cult Freedom Counseling
Center. The only larger cult in the United States, said
Streiker, is The Church of Scientology.
'Survival and book-burning'
Founded nearly 40 years ago by Victor Wierwille, now
65, The Way exemplifies the growth of religious cults in
American Christianity, a phenomenon that some re
ligious scholars say tends to accelerate in times of eco
nomic and political stress. "There are times in history
when the soil is ripe for the growth of cults," said Thomas
Schafer, a professor at Chicago's McCormick Divinity
School. One of the characteristics that distinguishes cults
from religious movements is members devotion to and
obedience of a living leader, Schafer said.
The Way meets that criterion, combining Wierwille's
off-beat brand of born-again Christianity with survival
training, faith healng and speaking in tongues.
Wierwille, an graduate of Princeton Theological Semi
niary and a former minister of the United Church of
Christ, has added aggressive Dale Carnegie-like sales
manship techniques and ultraconservative political
views. He teaches followers to hold regular book-burn
ings — former members say they were encouraged to
burn materials not published by the sect and instructs
them to read books that call the Nazi Holocaust a hoax
perpetrated by Jews and Communists.
'Attracting the military'
Although The Way has maintained a relatively low pro
file despite its growth in the past decade, the sect is at
tracting the attention of some members of Congress
troubled by its recruiting methods, its now-abandoned
firearms training program and its efforts to attract young
military personnel.

Critics, many of them former members, call The Way
dangerous. They tell stories of firearms training, sleep
deprivation, psychological manipulation and blind al
legiance to Wierwille, whom The Way members often
compare to Jesus Christ.
"That's just a bunch of out and out lies," said Vince
Finnegan, The Way's chief recruiter, who said the lies are
spread by Jews "and the adversary, the Devil, who
doesn't want the word to live When you look within
yourself there's emptiness . . . there are no answers out
side God's word."
'Low profile'
Many attracted to the word as The Way interprets it are
young, lonely, depressed or confused, caught in adoles
cent identity crises, trapped in shaky marriages. Some
are searching for direction and meaning, for more in
timacy than their own families offered.
Psychiatrists critical of cult methods and former Way
members say the friendship, comfort and sense of
purpose The Way offers mask the fact that the group re
cruits pliable members who are obedient and help pro
vide The Way continued financial support.
Because The Way is a homegrown Midwestern sect
whose members hold regular jobs, wear everyday
clothes and hairstyles, and do not live in isolation,
Streiker says, the group has avoided the scrutiny other
cults have received.
There is no dispute that The Way and Wierwille, who
declined to be interviewed, have prospered. From his
150-acre family farm and headquarters here Wierwille
presides over a tax-exempt multi-million-dollar religious
empire.
'Moving on Washington'
Only 15 years ago Wierwille scoured tiny Midwestern
hamlets on his raspberry-colored Harley-Davidson mo
torcycle, inviting farm families to attend services in his
living room. Today, he has mostly forsaken his motor
cycle, traveling instead by customized private jet or lux
ury bus to visit his disciples in more than 45 countries and
all 50 states. He has moved into Washington and targeted
area suburbs and Virginia's Tidewater area, with its huge
concentration of military personnel, as fertile territory
for recruiting. "There's a lot of interest in The Way in
Washington," said Finnegan. "We do real well there."
Way officials say it has 500 active members in the Wash
ington area and counts among its members US Court of
Claims Judge Robert Seto. "Are you aware that the
Mormons are a cult? That the Jewish religion is a cult?"
asked Seto. "The Way believes in the Lord Jesps Christ
and the word of God."
The Way spokesman Alison Heaney says Way mem
bers are "Bible-toting pacifists." Until last February,
however, Way members received organized firearms
training with ,22-caliber pistols and rifles.

That training and The Way's interest in military re
cruitment bothers Rep. William Whitehurst (R-Va.) who
represents the Tidewater area. "We're very concerned,"
said Whitehurst aide Peter Loomis. "Military people are
far from home and they would be ideal recruits for The
Way."
'Uncle Harry's Day'
During the last week of training, recruits are taught to
speak in tongufes — usually a stream of unintelligible syl
lables The Way members and other fundamentalists re-

gard as the word of God and proof of spiritual rebirth.
One of The Way's more unusual rituals occurs every
March 15 when The Way members celebrate "Uncle
Harry's Day,"the anniversary of the death of Wierwille's
beloved older brother who is buried at The Way head
quarters. On that day, members burn books or what The
Way members call "Devil-inspired" objects — clothing,
jewelry, records, television sets — that remind them of
their past lives.
'Missionary of The Way'
New members join The Way's 2000 missionaries as
signed to cities far from their homes at their own ex
pense. Former members say the traveling further severs
family ties and cements new ones. Way missionaries are
supposed to go home only for a funeral.
Janney said she received firearms training at Emporia
with a .22-caliber rifle. Janney and others also prepared a
detailed autobiography: "I want the where, what, who,
when, why and how regarding every major decision

point in your life," Wierwille wrote corps members. "For
example: I got into sex in the sixth grade; I started drugs
when I was 12; I robbed the local liquor store." Janney
also was required to keep a diary of only positive
thoughts. She said it was subject to unannounced inspec
tion.
"Prepare for attack"
"We were supervised all the time," she recalled.
"There was never any time to just be by yourself. You
always had to be doing something. I got there just after
Jonestown and Wierwille told us that the U.S. Army had
killed those people and covered it up. We were constant
ly taught that when the Communists or whoever took
over, we had to be the ones to survive. We always had to
have our backpacks ready, have supplies of canned
goods and firewood, never let the gas tank get more than
half empty."
Janney said that in October 1979 Wierwille told corps
members to get their guns ready and prepare to defend
themselves against a nuclear attack. "He told us that God
had spoken to him and that the Communists were going
to attack," she recalled. "We were supposed to speak in
tongues and pray around the clock and not tell anyone
or else word might leak out. There was just mass panic. I
got ready to go out into the field, but then Wierwille told
us that our speaking in tongues had averted the attack."
Way officials said that never happened either. They
said the firearms training was discontinued this year, the
victim of unwarranted negative publicity. "It was just a
hunter's safety course," said The Way's Washington area
director Michael Rood, a former Marine Corps
marksman. "We teach people how to floss their teeth, do
jet-style packing and handle guns."
'Forays into polities'
Despite The Way's financial success, its relationship
with New Knoxville residents is edgy — even though
Wierwille places advertisements in a local newspaper re
minding residents that the group spends more than
$25,000 a month in the community. Way members' ef
forts to enter local politics have made many people here
nervous.
Last year, county prosecutor Scott Jarvis, a Way mem
ber who also served as the group's chief lawyer, was de
feated for re-election. During his tenure, Jarvis pro
voked an uproar by deputizing an armed three-member
police force of Way members called "The Bless Patrol,"
which has since been disbanded.
But despite the controversy, the criticism and the fears
that The Way is somehow dangerous, its members say
they are only interested in spreading the word of The
Way. "We're a horrible failure if we're trying to take over
the world," Heaney said. "But then again, people
thought Jesus Christ wanted to overthrow the govern
ment."

members say the friendship, comfort and sense of

Because The Way is a homegrown Midwestern sect
whose members hold regular jobs, wear everyday
clothes and hairstyles, and do not live in isolation,
Streiker says, the group has avoided the scrutiny other
cults have received.
There is no dispute that The Way and Wierwille, who
declined to be interviewed, have prospered. From his
150-acre family farm and headquarters here Wierwille
presides over a tax-exempt multi-million-dollar religious
empire.
'Moving on Washington'
Only 15 years ago Wierwille scoured tiny Midwestern
hamlets on his raspberry-colored Harley-Davidson mo
torcycle, inviting farm families to attend services in his
living room. Today, he has mostly forsaken his motor
cycle, traveling instead by customized private jet or lux
ury bus to visit his disciples in more than 45 countries and
all 50 states. He has moved into Washington and targeted
area suburbs and Virginia's Tidewater area, with its huge
concentration of military personnel, as fertile territory
for recruiting. "There's a lot of interest in The Way in
Washington," said Finnegan. "We do real well there."
Way officials say it has 500 active members in the Wash
ington area and counts among its members US Court of
Claims Judge Robert Seto. "Are you aware that the
Mormons are a cult? That the Jewish religion is a cult?"
asked Seto. "The Way believes in the Lord Jesps Christ
and the word of God."
The Way spokesman Alison Heaney says Way mem
bers are "Bible-toting pacifists." Until last February,
however, Way members received organized firearms
training with ,22-caliber pistols and rifles.

That training and The Way's interest in military re
cruitment bothers Rep. William Whitehurst (R-Va.) who
represents the Tidewater area. "We're very concerned,"
said Whitehurst aide Peter Loomis. "Military people are
far from home and they would be ideal recruits for The
Way."

gard as the word of God and proof of spiritual rebirth.
One of The Way's more unusual rituals occurs every
March 15 when The Way members celebrate "Uncle
Harry's Day,"the anniversary of the death of Wierwille's
beloved older brother who is buried at The Way head
quarters. On that day, members burn books or what The
Way members call "Devil-inspired" objects — clothing,
jewelry, records, television sets — that remind them of
their past lives.
'Missionary of The Way'
New members join The Way's 2000 missionaries as
signed to cities far from their homes at their own ex
pense. Former members say the traveling further severs
family ties and cements new ones. Way missionaries are
supposed to go home only for a funeral.
Janney said she received firearms training at Emporia
with a .22-caliber rifle. Janney and others also prepared a
detailed autobiography: "I want the where, what, who,
when, why and how regarding every major decision

point in your life," Wierwille wrote corps members. "For
example: I got into sex in the sixth grade; I started drugs
when I was 12; I robbed the local liquor store." Janney
also was required to keep a diary of only positive
thoughts. She said it was subject to unannounced inspec
tion.
"Prepare for attack"
"We were supervised all the time," she recalled.
"There was never any time to just be by yourself. You
always had to be doing something. I got there just after
Jonestown and Wierwille told us that the U.S. Army had
killed those people and covered it up. We were constant
ly taught that when the Communists or whoever took
over, we had to be the ones to survive. We always had to
have our backpacks ready, have supplies of canned
goods and firewood, never let the gas tank get more than
half empty."
Janney said that in October 1979 Wierwille told corps
members to get their guns ready and prepare to defend
themselves against a nuclear attack. "He told us that God
had spoken to him and that the Communists were going
to attack," she recalled. "We were supposed to speak in
tongues and pray around the clock and not tell anyone
or else word might leak out. There was just mass panic. I
got ready to go out into the field, but then Wierwille told
us that our speaking in tongues had averted the attack."
Way officials said that never happened either. They
said the firearms training was discontinued this year, the
victim of unwarranted negative publicity. "It was just a
hunter's safety course," said The Way's Washington area
director Michael Rood, a former Marine Corps
marksman. "We teach people how to floss their teeth, do
jet-style packing and handle guns."
'Forays into polities'
Despite The Way's financial success, its relationship
with New Knoxville residents is edgy — even though
Wierwille places advertisements in a local newspaper re
minding residents that the group spends more than
$25,000 a month in the community. Way members' ef
forts to enter local politics have made many people here
nervous.
Last year, county prosecutor Scott Jarvis, a Way mem
ber who also served as the group's chief lawyer, was de
feated for re-election. During his tenure, Jarvis pro
voked an uproar by deputizing an armed three-member
police force of Way members called "The Bless Patrol,"
which has since been disbanded.
But despite the controversy, the criticism and the fears
that The Way is somehow dangerous, its members say
they are only interested in spreading the word of The
Way. "We're a horrible failure if we're trying to take over
the world," Heaney said. "But then again, people
thought Jesus Christ wanted to overthrow the govern
ment."
New Knoxville, Ohio — Hannah Janney, who grew up
on a farm in northern Virginia, remembers feeling
amazed the first time she saw The Way International
headquarters rising out of the relentlessly flat Mid
western landscape. Amid endless miles of cornfields
were meticulous gardens, man-made ponds, gurgling
white marble fountains and buildings so freshly painted
they gleamed under the summer sun.
Most impressive, Janney recalls, was the sight of 16,000
brothers and sisters who had flocked to this tiny hamlet
outside Dayton for an annual week-long festival, called
The Rock of Ages. Like Janney, they were devout mem
bers of The Way, a little-known fundamentalist Christian
sect, which some theologians believe to be the nation's
second largest cult.
The Way now has an estimated 40,000 followers —
more than Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
"Everybody thinks the Moonies are the big cult because
they've gotten the lion's share of publicity, but the Way is
much bigger and more pervasive," says Lowell Streiker,
director of San Francisco'santi-cult Freedom Counseling
Center. The only larger cult in the United States, said
Streiker, is The Church of Scientology.
'Survival and book-burning'
Founded nearly 40 years ago by Victor Wierwille, now
65, The Way exemplifies the growth of religious cults in
American Christianity, a phenomenon that some re
ligious scholars say tends to accelerate in times of eco
nomic and political stress. "There are times in history
when the soil is ripe for the growth of cults," said Thomas
Schafer, a professor at Chicago's McCormick Divinity
School. One of the characteristics that distinguishes cults
from religious movements is members devotion to and
obedience of a living leader, Schafer said.
The Way meets that criterion, combining Wierwille's
off-beat brand of born-again Christianity with survival
training, faith healng and speaking in tongues.
Wierwille, an graduate of Princeton Theological Semi
niary and a former minister of the United Church of
Christ, has added aggressive Dale Carnegie-like sales
manship techniques and ultraconservative political
views. He teaches followers to hold regular book-burn
ings — former members say they were encouraged to
burn materials not published by the sect and instructs
them to read books that call the Nazi Holocaust a hoax
perpetrated by Jews and Communists.
'Attracting the military'
Although The Way has maintained a relatively low pro
file despite its growth in the past decade, the sect is at
tracting the attention of some members of Congress
troubled by its recruiting methods, its now-abandoned
firearms training program and its efforts to attract young
military personnel.

Critics, many of them former members, call The Way
dangerous. They tell stories of firearms training, sleep
deprivation, psychological manipulation and blind al
legiance to Wierwille, whom The Way members often
compare to Jesus Christ.
"That's just a bunch of out and out lies," said Vince
Finnegan, The Way's chief recruiter, who said the lies are
spread by Jews "and the adversary, the Devil, who
doesn't want the word to live When you look within
yourself there's emptiness . . . there are no answers out
side God's word."
'Low profile'
Many attracted to the word as The Way interprets it are
young, lonely, depressed or confused, caught in adoles
cent identity crises, trapped in shaky marriages. Some
are searching for direction and meaning, for more in
timacy than their own families offered.
Psychiatrists critical of cult methods and former Way

family ties and cements new ones. Way missionaries are
supposed to go home only for a funeral.
Janney said she received firearms training at Emporia
with a .22-caliber rifle. Janney and others also prepared a
detailed autobiography: "I want the where, what, who,
when, why and how regarding every major decision

point in your life," Wierwille wrote corps members. "For
example: I got into sex in the sixth grade; I started drugs
when I was 12; I robbed the local liquor store." Janney
also was required to keep a diary of only positive
thoughts. She said it was subject to unannounced inspec
tion.
"Prepare for attack"
"We were supervised all the time," she recalled.
"There was never any time to just be by yourself. You
always had to be doing something. I got there just after
Jonestown and Wierwille told us that the U.S. Army had
killed those people and covered it up. We were constant
ly taught that when the Communists or whoever took
over, we had to be the ones to survive. We always had to
have our backpacks ready, have supplies of canned
goods and firewood, never let the gas tank get more than
half empty."
Janney said that in October 1979 Wierwille told corps
members to get their guns ready and prepare to defend
themselves against a nuclear attack. "He told us that God
had spoken to him and that the Communists were going
to attack," she recalled. "We were supposed to speak in
tongues and pray around the clock and not tell anyone
or else word might leak out. There was just mass panic. I
got ready to go out into the field, but then Wierwille told
us that our speaking in tongues had averted the attack."
Way officials said that never happened either. They
said the firearms training was discontinued this year, the
victim of unwarranted negative publicity. "It was just a
hunter's safety course," said The Way's Washington area
director Michael Rood, a former Marine Corps
marksman. "We teach people how to floss their teeth, do
jet-style packing and handle guns."
'Forays into polities'
Despite The Way's financial success, its relationship
with New Knoxville residents is edgy — even though
Wierwille places advertisements in a local newspaper re
minding residents that the group spends more than
$25,000 a month in the community. Way members' ef
forts to enter local politics have made many people here
nervous.
Last year, county prosecutor Scott Jarvis, a Way mem
ber who also served as the group's chief lawyer, was de
feated for re-election. During his tenure, Jarvis pro
voked an uproar by deputizing an armed three-member
police force of Way members called "The Bless Patrol,"
which has since been disbanded.
But despite the controversy, the criticism and the fears
that The Way is somehow dangerous, its members say
they are only interested in spreading the word of The
Way. "We're a horrible failure if we're trying to take over
the world," Heaney said. "But then again, people
thought Jesus Christ wanted to overthrow the govern
ment."
New Knoxville, Ohio — Hannah Janney, who grew up
on a farm in northern Virginia, remembers feeling
amazed the first time she saw The Way International
headquarters rising out of the relentlessly flat Mid
western landscape. Amid endless miles of cornfields
were meticulous gardens, man-made ponds, gurgling
white marble fountains and buildings so freshly painted
they gleamed under the summer sun.
Most impressive, Janney recalls, was the sight of 16,000
brothers and sisters who had flocked to this tiny hamlet
outside Dayton for an annual week-long festival, called
The Rock of Ages. Like Janney, they were devout mem
bers of The Way, a little-known fundamentalist Christian
sect, which some theologians believe to be the nation's
second largest cult.
The Way now has an estimated 40,000 followers —
more than Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
"Everybody thinks the Moonies are the big cult because
they've gotten the lion's share of publicity, but the Way is
much bigger and more pervasive," says Lowell Streiker,
director of San Francisco'santi-cult Freedom Counseling
Center. The only larger cult in the United States, said
Streiker, is The Church of Scientology.
'Survival and book-burning'
Founded nearly 40 years ago by Victor Wierwille, now
65, The Way exemplifies the growth of religious cults in
American Christianity, a phenomenon that some re
ligious scholars say tends to accelerate in times of eco
nomic and political stress. "There are times in history
when the soil is ripe for the growth of cults," said Thomas
Schafer, a professor at Chicago's McCormick Divinity
School. One of the characteristics that distinguishes cults
from religious movements is members devotion to and
obedience of a living leader, Schafer said.
The Way meets that criterion, combining Wierwille's
off-beat brand of born-again Christianity with survival
training, faith healng and speaking in tongues.
Wierwille, an graduate of Princeton Theological Semi
niary and a former minister of the United Church of
Christ, has added aggressive Dale Carnegie-like sales
manship techniques and ultraconservative political
views. He teaches followers to hold regular book-burn
ings — former members say they were encouraged to
burn materials not published by the sect and instructs
them to read books that call the Nazi Holocaust a hoax
perpetrated by Jews and Communists.
'Attracting the military'
Although The Way has maintained a relatively low pro
file despite its growth in the past decade, the sect is at
tracting the attention of some members of Congress
troubled by its recruiting methods, its now-abandoned
firearms training program and its efforts to attract young
military personnel.

Critics, many of them former members, call The Way
dangerous. They tell stories of firearms training, sleep
deprivation, psychological manipulation and blind al
legiance to Wierwille, whom The Way members often
compare to Jesus Christ.
"That's just a bunch of out and out lies," said Vince
Finnegan, The Way's chief recruiter, who said the lies are
spread by Jews "and the adversary, the Devil, who
doesn't want the word to live When you look within
yourself there's emptiness . . . there are no answers out
side God's word."
'Low profile'
Many attracted to the word as The Way interprets it are
young, lonely, depressed or confused, caught in adoles
cent identity crises, trapped in shaky marriages. Some
are searching for direction and meaning, for more in
timacy than their own families offered.
Psychiatrists critical of cult methods and former Way
members say the friendship, comfort and sense of
purpose The Way offers mask the fact that the group re
cruits pliable members who are obedient and help pro
vide The Way continued financial support.
Because The Way is a homegrown Midwestern sect
whose members hold regular jobs, wear everyday
clothes and hairstyles, and do not live in isolation,
Streiker says, the group has avoided the scrutiny other
cults have received.
There is no dispute that The Way and Wierwille, who
declined to be interviewed, have prospered. From his
150-acre family farm and headquarters here Wierwille
presides over a tax-exempt multi-million-dollar religious
empire.
'Moving on Washington'
Only 15 years ago Wierwille scoured tiny Midwestern
hamlets on his raspberry-colored Harley-Davidson mo
torcycle, inviting farm families to attend services in his
living room. Today, he has mostly forsaken his motor
cycle, traveling instead by customized private jet or lux
ury bus to visit his disciples in more than 45 countries and
all 50 states. He has moved into Washington and targeted
area suburbs and Virginia's Tidewater area, with its huge
concentration of military personnel, as fertile territory
for recruiting. "There's a lot of interest in The Way in
Washington," said Finnegan. "We do real well there."
Way officials say it has 500 active members in the Wash
ington area and counts among its members US Court of
Claims Judge Robert Seto. "Are you aware that the
Mormons are a cult? That the Jewish religion is a cult?"
asked Seto. "The Way believes in the Lord Jesps Christ
and the word of God."
The Way spokesman Alison Heaney says Way mem
bers are "Bible-toting pacifists." Until last February,
however, Way members received organized firearms
training with ,22-caliber pistols and rifles.

That training and The Way's interest in military re
cruitment bothers Rep. William Whitehurst (R-Va.) who
represents the Tidewater area. "We're very concerned,"
said Whitehurst aide Peter Loomis. "Military people are
far from home and they would be ideal recruits for The
Way."
'Uncle Harry's Day'
During the last week of training, recruits are taught to
speak in tongufes — usually a stream of unintelligible syl
lables The Way members and other fundamentalists re-

gard as the word of God and proof of spiritual rebirth.
One of The Way's more unusual rituals occurs every
March 15 when The Way members celebrate "Uncle
Harry's Day,"the anniversary of the death of Wierwille's
beloved older brother who is buried at The Way head
quarters. On that day, members burn books or what The
Way members call "Devil-inspired" objects — clothing,
jewelry, records, television sets — that remind them of
their past lives.
'Missionary of The Way'
New members join The Way's 2000 missionaries as
signed to cities far from their homes at their own ex
pense. Former members say the traveling further severs
family ties and cements new ones. Way missionaries are
supposed to go home only for a funeral.
