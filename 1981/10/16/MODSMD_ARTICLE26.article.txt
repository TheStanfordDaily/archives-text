# Libraries add new computer catalog

### Libbi Chambers 
Studentsand faculty using
the Stanford libraries can
now benefit from a new
computerized serial
catalog, according to David
Weber, director of the uni
versity libraries.
The university devoted a
three-year $869,000 Federal
grant to financing the
project, which involves
nearly every library on cam
pus. In addition, Stanford's
catalog now includes list
ings from more than 25 oth
er university research librar
ies.
This greatly increases the
resources available to re
searchers, while saving
them the extra time it would
take to search each collec
tion.
To implement the pro
gram, a Library of Congress
cataloging system was util
ized. Most of the actual
work involved was done by
library staff members. At
present, the computer ter
minal must be operated
with the assistance of a li
brarian. Catalog access will
soon be available for inde
pendent use.
Stanford library adminis
trators have expressed many
positive opinions concern
ing the effects of the
project. Law librarian
Myron lacobstein stressed

that serials in the fields of
law, medicine, and science
will now be more accessible
outside the libraries them
selves. This should prove to
be a great boon to scholars
who rely on up-to-date in
formation.
Some rare and previously
uncatalogued materials
found in the Hoover Institu
tion will now be easier to lo
cate. Some of these man
uscripts date back to the
mid-19th century, stated
Joseph Kladko, head of
technical services at Hoo
ver.
Title 11-C, a Federal pro
gram which provided funds
for the catalog project, has
been striving to increase
sharing among the various
university research libraries.
At the same time, the partic
ipating libraries are able to
save money by avoiding un
necessary duplication of
holdings.
This year, the Stanford li
braries are using a $208,000
grant (again from the Title
11-C program) to com
puterize a file of books pub
lished in the United Statesin
the years 1801 to 1805. Ac
cording to james Myers, as
sistant director of technical
services, there is a great
need for this, since fewer
than 1 percent of these
books are currently on line.
