# Frosh look-alikes keep heads turning

### Mark Zeigler 
They are both 5-foot-6 1 /:, have
light brown hair and blue eyes. They
often wear the same clothes. They are
both freshmen at Stanford, and even
share the same classes.
In fact, both girls wave, say "hi," an
swer questions, and do just about ev
erything else exactly alike.
This dynamic duo is none other than
the identical twins Amy and Anne
Smith.
Originally from Cheyene, Wyoming,
and most recently from Martinez, Cali
fornia, the Smith sisters have had the
Stanford community in knots over
who's who, what's what, and where's
where.
From just looks, it is virtually im
possible to tell the twins apart, and the
fact that they dress alike only com
pounds the problem. As a result, "To
other people we are one unit," Anne
remarked.
But appearances aside, their person
alities indeed differ. Although the two
have the same interests, they claim to
be moody. Often, one girl's disposition

will be completely opposite of her sis
ter's.
Both wind down in different ways as
well. "I like to relax by writing songs,
while Amy will do something like go to
a park," Anne commented.
Furtherm6re, Amy likes apple pie
and exotic foods, while Anne prefers
cheesecake and exotic desserts.
The two stated that throughout jun
ior high and high school they had been
plagued by people comparing them
and deciding which twin was more tal
ented at a certain skill.
But, as Amy noted, both would rather
"work as a team.
"We decided to use our strengths for
each other rather than against each oth
er," Anne said. "We're like each other's
best friend," she added.
And that is how it has been all their
lives. Have they ever become tired of
constantly expressing the true meaning
of the word "twins?" Anne replied, "I
don't know it any other way."
During childhood, their parents
treated the two as equals to their five

brothers. They were never forced to act
like twins, but did so voluntarily be
cause "we were going to pursue the
same interests," according to Amy.
Their predominant interest is singing,
as both girls possess fine voices and
creative minds. In fact, the duo toured
the country, also stopping in Bermuda
and the Caribbean, to perform at ban
quets, on cruise ships and the like for
two years before coming to Stanford.
The twins have recently landed a job
at the Golden Spike (in the Stanford
Bam) doing what they call the "Amy
and Annie sound." Their entire show is
made up of their own arrangements.
They have also put on their act for the
Gong Show and at the Grand Old Opri.
Although Amy and Annie have made
local commercials, they have yet to be
the Doublemint Twins.
In fact, calling these two enterprising
would be an understatement: they
formed and now help manage Amy An
nie Enterprises. "Amy handles the
bookwork, I do the PR," Annie ex
plained.

The Smith sisters seem to be enjoying
Stanford so far and are happy to both be
here. However, if one twin was not ac
cepted, the other would not have at
tended Stanford, and the "team" would
have set up camp elsewhere.
"We both told our parents at dif
ferent times that we wanted to go to
Stanford," Amy mentioned. It wassome
time before both twins realized that
Stanford was a common dream.
Amy and Anne plan to continue
being and acting like "twins," perhaps
for the rest of their lives. They also will
have similar wardrobes, a luxury they
have enjoyed.
The twins believe that wearing the
same clothes is "easy. You don't have to
think about what you're going to wear.
You just have to call up the other sister
and ask her what to put on."
Also, as Amy points out, dressing
alike "keeps them (people) on their
toes." That it does. Fortunately, there is
a way to distinguish one twin from the
other. Anne has a slight indentation on
the upper right side of her right eye. '

a park," Anne commented.
Furtherm6re, Amy likes apple pie
and exotic foods, while Anne prefers
cheesecake and exotic desserts.
The two stated that throughout jun
ior high and high school they had been
plagued by people comparing them
and deciding which twin was more tal
ented at a certain skill.
But, as Amy noted, both would rather
"work as a team.
"We decided to use our strengths for
each other rather than against each oth
er," Anne said. "We're like each other's
best friend," she added.
And that is how it has been all their
lives. Have they ever become tired of
constantly expressing the true meaning
of the word "twins?" Anne replied, "I
don't know it any other way."
During childhood, their parents
treated the two as equals to their five

brothers. They were never forced to act
like twins, but did so voluntarily be
cause "we were going to pursue the
same interests," according to Amy.
Their predominant interest is singing,
as both girls possess fine voices and
creative minds. In fact, the duo toured
the country, also stopping in Bermuda
and the Caribbean, to perform at ban
quets, on cruise ships and the like for
two years before coming to Stanford.
The twins have recently landed a job
at the Golden Spike (in the Stanford
Bam) doing what they call the "Amy
and Annie sound." Their entire show is
made up of their own arrangements.
They have also put on their act for the
Gong Show and at the Grand Old Opri.
Although Amy and Annie have made
local commercials, they have yet to be
the Doublemint Twins.
In fact, calling these two enterprising
would be an understatement: they
formed and now help manage Amy An
nie Enterprises. "Amy handles the
bookwork, I do the PR," Annie ex
plained.

The Smith sisters seem to be enjoying
Stanford so far and are happy to both be
here. However, if one twin was not ac
cepted, the other would not have at
tended Stanford, and the "team" would
have set up camp elsewhere.
"We both told our parents at dif
ferent times that we wanted to go to
Stanford," Amy mentioned. It wassome
time before both twins realized that
Stanford was a common dream.
Amy and Anne plan to continue
being and acting like "twins," perhaps
for the rest of their lives. They also will
have similar wardrobes, a luxury they
have enjoyed.
The twins believe that wearing the
same clothes is "easy. You don't have to
think about what you're going to wear.
You just have to call up the other sister
and ask her what to put on."
Also, as Amy points out, dressing
alike "keeps them (people) on their
toes." That it does. Fortunately, there is
a way to distinguish one twin from the
other. Anne has a slight indentation on
the upper right side of her right eye. '


AMY AND ANNIE OR AN
NIE AND AMY?? — Amy
and Annie Smith (left to
right!) are first-year under
eradauates here this year,
but if you didn't know they
were both here, you
just think you were seeing
double.
They are both 5-foot-6 1 /:, have
light brown hair and blue eyes. They
often wear the same clothes. They are
both freshmen at Stanford, and even
share the same classes.
In fact, both girls wave, say "hi," an
swer questions, and do just about ev
erything else exactly alike.
This dynamic duo is none other than
the identical twins Amy and Anne
Smith.
Originally from Cheyene, Wyoming,
and most recently from Martinez, Cali
fornia, the Smith sisters have had the
Stanford community in knots over
who's who, what's what, and where's
where.
From just looks, it is virtually im
possible to tell the twins apart, and the
fact that they dress alike only com
pounds the problem. As a result, "To
other people we are one unit," Anne
remarked.
But appearances aside, their person
alities indeed differ. Although the two
have the same interests, they claim to
be moody. Often, one girl's disposition

will be completely opposite of her sis
ter's.
Both wind down in different ways as
well. "I like to relax by writing songs,
while Amy will do something like go to
a park," Anne commented.
