# Research cuts may go over original 12 percent estimate
##

The Reagan administration's budg
etary deferral strategy may result in
greater losses to University reasearch
groups than the already predicted 12
percent, according to Vice Provost
Gerald Lieberman.
Elaborating on President Donald
Kennedy's report to the Faculty Sen
ate yesterday, Lieberman explained
that national research agencies have
been instructed to plan their budgets
this year based on 88 percent of the
amount proposed for them by the
Reagan administration last March.

This means that if Congress does
not increase the proposed alloca
tions, national research agencies,
many of which support research at
Stanford, will have 12 percent fewer
funds than they had anticipated last
spring.
The effect on research here is still
unknown because agencies have not
decided how they will allocate their
money. According to Lieberman, if
agencies fund only the top programs,
decreasing the tcftal number of
groups they sponsor, the University
should not fare badly, due to the
competitiveness of its programs. But,
if the agencies opt for across-the
board cuts — funding all groups but
giving each one less — Stanford's
losses would amount to much more
than 12 percent, Lieberman ex
plained.
Summing up the situation,
Lieberrrtan said, "It's great con
fusion." But Kennedy added,"There
is in this world, I keep saying, a place
for relentless optimism."
Turningtotheannual report of the
Committee on Research (C-Res), the
senate unanimously adopted an
amendment to the University's poli
cy on faculty consulting.
The current policy allows faculty
members to consult (in organizations
outside of the University) no more
than 13 days per quarter. Faculty
members are required to report the
quantity, but not the nature, of their
outside consulting.
The senate added the following
amendment: "In cases where ques
tions arise regarding potential or ap
parent conflict between consulting
activities and the faculty member's I
University duties, the faculty mem- !
ber shall disclose, upon the specific \
request from the cognizant Dean,
the Provost, or the President, the !

» names of companies for whom
■ he/she consults (as defined in the
, current consulting policy statement),
: the general nature of each consulting
• agreement (as opposed to detailed
technical aspects), and the number
of days committed per consulting
agreement."
According to C-Res, the danger of
this being an invasion of privacy "is
outweighed by the advantage of
open disclosure to serve as a protec
tion to the individual faculty mem
ber, the department, and the Univer
sity."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth commented, "We have
to get some guidelines as to what a
conflict of interest is. This document
is a first step, but I would hate to see it
(the issue) end here."
Further discussion centered on
Law Prof. Barbara Babcock's pro
posed amendment to eliminate the
first clause, which she said she be
lieved connotes "a bad guy turning
someone in." But C-Res Chairman
Ingram Olkin, statistics professor, ex
plained that the committee's intent
was to advocate this disclosure only
in special cases, not to make it the
norm. He said he favored specifying
the disclosure only in cases where
questions arise.
Babcock's amendment was subse
quently defeated, and the commit
tee's amendment was adopted as
submitted.
On the faculty housing front, Prov
ost Albert Hastorf reported that con
structionof condominiums in the Pe
ter Coutts area is underway. He said
the 140 units are planned to be ready
for occupation next summer and fall.
Some will be for sale, while others
will be held as rental units, he said.
The units will be priced between
$160,000 and $260,000.
