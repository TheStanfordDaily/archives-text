# Watt proves profitable to Republicans

Washington — He has be
come the black-knight darling
of Doonesbury, a regular in
Johnny Carson's monologues
and the 'favorite bad-guy
caricature of editorial car
toonists from coast to coast.
His reputation, deserved or
not, as a man who would make
Bambi a trophy on his office
wall, has spawned a cottage in
dustry for his opponents, who
churn out T-shirts and bumper
stickers emblazoned: "Watt?
Me Worry?"
But if Interior Secretary
James Watt, the most con
troversial member of President
Reagan's Cabinet, has environ
mentalists worried, he is be
coming the toast of another
group: Republican money
raisers taking aim on next
year's congressional elections.
Some GOP money men say
Watt is the best fund-raising
draw they have, other than
Reagan. And one of his top
aides confirmed Wednesday
that Watt will spend more time
out raising Republican cam
paign money than he will in his
Interior Department office the
rest of this year. Doug Baldwin,
Watt's assistant secretary for
public affairs, said Watt has

fund-raising appearances
scheduled in North and South
Dakota, California, New Mexi
co, South Carolina and Louisi
ana in the next month. Baldwin
also said Watt is spending two
or three nights a week at fund
raisers here.
Watt's heavy political sched
ule is a complete turnaround
from his early tenure as interior
secretary. For almost six
months, Watt turned down all
out-of-town speaking en
gagements as he attempted to
put his own, controversial
stamp on the Interior Depart
ment.
His early actions drew strong
fire from environmentalists,
but also apparently set the
stage for his new role as a GOP
hero on the rubber-chicken
circuit.
"Frankly, we're delighted
every time every time
Doonesbury comes out and
hits him again," Baldwin said.
"It's making him a folk hero."
Watt, obviously, is not a folk
hero with all the folks. But his
outspoken policies on the de
velopment of the nation's nat
ural resources place him in the
middle of one of the biggest
money games in America. That
apparently is paying off at polit

ical dinners.
A spokesman for the Re
publican National Committee
said Watt has raised more than
$400,000 for the committee in
the last six weeks and that he is
a "tremendous draw, one of
our top requests (from office
seekers)."
Republican polls are show
ing that Watt's combative flair
cuts both ways politically,
polarizing groups into strong
support and strong opposition.
It's the strong support that has
Watt packing them in at Re
publican fund-raisers, just as
the strong opposition will pack
Washington with environmen
talists next week.
In an assault organized
almost like a Vietnam War pro
test, environmentalists from 50
states are to storm Washington
with a million signatures on
Sierra Club petitions asking
Reagan to fire Watt.
Watt's emergence as a draw
ing card at Republican fund
raising functions came during a
month-long, late-summer
Western trip Watt designed to
shore up his image at a time
when it seemed most tattered.
At the time, some of Watt's
policies were being revised
rapidly in response to heat
both in the courts and political

circles. He was embroiled in
nasty battles with House Dem
ocratic leaders and trying to
calm down California Re
publicans wprried about his
off-shore oil-drilling policies.
Rumors circulated that the
White House was warning him
to back off, especially with the
1982 elections nearing.
In his native Rocky Moun
tain West, however, Watt mix
ed scenic tours of national
parks with hard politics at
fund-raisers in Montana, Utah,
Idaho, Arizona and New Mexi
co. Local politicians estimated
that the Watt appearances
added 15 to 20 percent to the
expected take.
Since then Watt has raised
money in Maryland and Penn
sylvania and plans a major
Southern swing next month.
Baldwin said the pace — at least
half Watt's time going to mon
ey raising for the rest of the
year — will continue after a
short lull before the campaign
season moves into full swing
next year. Last week Watt ad
dressed 9,000 regular Re
publican donors at a dinner in
Long Beach, Calif. — in a state
where Republicans seemed
more worried about him than
wanting him just months ago.
"They're raising a lot of mon
ey out of James Watt," Baldwin
said of the environmentalists.
He did not find it necessary to
add that Doonesbury and
Johnny Carson just seemed to
be good for business, all
around.
