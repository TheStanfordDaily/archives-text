# Linguists spell out major

With help from the Undergraduate Studies
Committee, the Linguistics Department h»
restructured their program requirementsjjft
the undergraduate level so that the former
Human Language major could become the
new "Linguistics" major.
What does this study entail? According to
department head Professor Elizabeth
Traugott, linguistics does not simply involve
studying many languages:
"Linguists study language as a human facul
ty and changing social institution. Among the
questions they deal with are: is language
unique to humans? how do languages work?
how do we acquire languages? can machines
be made to understand human languages?"
The restructured linguistics program thus
offers undergraduates a solid major with an
interdisciplinary bent that encorporates hu
manities, social and physical sciences.
The new major tackles these questions by
outlining specializations in eight specific and
diverse areas. These include formal
linguistics, general linguistics, linguistics and
literature, linguistics of a particular language
family, linguistics in education, linguistics in
cognitive science, sociolinguistics, speech
production and language perception, and in
dividually designed programs.
Traugott felt that the department needed
restructuring for purely academic reasons:
"We tended to offer a major with lots of
breadth but no depth. Students found it at
tractive at the beginning but frustrating at the
end," she said.
The greatest alteration in the new program
is that the six course core requirement has
been dropped. Formerly, students needed to
take at least two courses from at least three of
the following areas: social aspects of lan
guage, psychological .and biological aspects
of language, languages and literature, formal

aspects of language, in order to meet the ma
jor requirements.
Students now need only one preliminary
course, linguistic theory and analysis (Ling.
110). After completing these requirements,
the student can then begin concentrating in
one of eight different specializations.
formal linguistics, which combines
mathematical skills and philosophy, remains
the most popular of the eight areas,
linguistics and cognitive science — a psy
chology/philosophy tract — and soci
olinguistics, which explores education and
society, are two other popular areas.
Although the department had only six
linguistics majors last year, Traugott said that
interest is growing. Coterminal students are
especially attracted to the 36-unit Masters
Degree program.
Cunningham is pleased with the present
linguistics program. He feels the new course
offerings add depth to the major, while the ti
tle "Linguistics" provides a name befitting a
"respectable academic discipline."
According to Cunningham, "The depart
ment's literature about the major is also now
clearer and gives a better indication of where
the studies might lead, careerwise."
Traugott stressed the variety of career op
portunities for the linguistics major. She cited
the logic training learned in Linguistics as ide
al for law school hopefuls. Past graduates in
the field have not only chosen careers in
linguistics but also in business, banking, law,
education and journalism.
And for those choosing careers in the field
of linguistics, Traugott predicts increased op
portunity in the next decade, especially to the
expanding artificial intelligence research,
where cognitive language plays an important
role. In fact, the Sloan Foundation recently
awarded Stanford a large grant for post doc
toral fellows in the cognitive sciences.
