## Stanford, USC come off different kinds of upsets It's that time of year again: the Trojan grudge game 
### Mike Oneal 
There are three blocks within the foot
ball season which take on special meaning
to any fan of the Stanford game.
The first is opening day when you can sit
back and get your first look at the Cardinal
offense everyone talked about all summer.
The last is Big Game when, no matter what
has happened since opening day, you get
drunk and roar at the rivalry.
The middle block is that two week peri
od at the fulcrum of the season when Stan
ford plays UCLA and USC back to back.
The Cards have usually played a couple of
conference games by that time but it's still
not clear how the season is shaping up. "If
we can just beat those So. Cal schools. . ."
they say.
Well, Stanford beat one of them, UCLA,
last week and thanks (however ironically)
to a scrappy Arizona team, this year's trip
to the Coliseum retains its significance —
despite the Cards' 0-4 start.
Stanford is tied for fourth place in the
Pacific-10 Conference with five other
teams. USC, which dropped from No.l to
N0.7 last week after its 13-10 loss to Arizo
na, is among them. If the Card's can win
this week's game and the rest of their sea
son and if Washington State, nowon top of
the Pac-10, loses two, Stanford will go to
the Rose Bowl.
Wait a minute — let's not get carried
away.
Stanford has won only one game this
year and plays one of "the most outstanding
Southern California teams ever this week.

The odds-makers gave USC 14V2 points
yesterday outlining the prevalent feeling
nationally that the Trojans should take
Stanford for a ride.
Heisman Trophy front-runner Marcus
Allen is the major reason why.
Allen, who has 1136 yards rushing in five
games this year, is looking for his sixth
straight 200-yards-plus day against Stan
ford. The 6-foot-2, 202-pound senior
tailback has simply devastated the NCAA
this year behind All-America guard Roy
Foster and tackle Don Mosebar.
Stanford defensive coordinator Jack
Harbaugh looks at him with awe.
"When I was coaching at Michigan (he
was there for seven years) we played
against Charles White, Rickey Bell and
Lynn Cain and Allen is comparable to all of
them," Harbaugh said. "But it's a team
thing. He's a great back, they have a great
line and it's a great concept there. We
haven't put in anything special just be
cause of Allen. We'll just have to match our
best against their best and see what hap
pens."
Stanford's best on defense has been get
ting better all the time, but the Card defen
ders, led recently by Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week Dave Morze, will have
to have the game of their lives to halt the
Allen attack.
The Trojans' loss to Arizona had to take
some of the weight off Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin's shoulders. Allen ran
for 211 yards that day and USC came up
with only the 10 points.

Offensively, Stanford must watch out for
USC linebacker Chip Banks another in a
long line of fast, hard hitting Trojan de
fensemen. Card left tackle Jim Dykstra said
Banks was one of the quickest linebackers
to the ball he had ever seen. Offensive co
ordinator Jim Fassel agrees.
"John Robinson said Banks was the most
dominating defensive player in the coun
try," Fassel said. "I agree. He's awsome. He
gets to the ball so quickly it's incredible."
Fassel said that Stanford will rely again
on t the quick flare-out pass to Darrin
Nelson which worked so well against
UCLA last week. He expects to run the ball
a lot and look to pass it at least as much as
last week, but generally, he said, "We're
gonna try to misdirect people and get the
ball to Darrin in the wide open spaces."
The one thing the Cards can take hope
in is the fact that they have incredibly ex
plosive potential under fire. The last quar
ters of the Purdue, Ohio State and UCLA
games proved that clearly enough. If we
can take the past as example, being 14-
point underdogs could mean a great day
for Stanford football. It did two years ago
when quarterback Turk Schonert brought
the Cards back from a 21-0 halftime deficit
to tie the No.l ranked Trojans in the Col
iseum. Dykstra thinks it could help out
again.
"There's a positive feeling after a win at
practice," the senior said. "It feels good
out here. I think they'll (USC) be mad after
the loss last week but I think we can win it.
We always play well down there."

SEE JOHN RUN — Stanford fans may see a lot of the kind of thing pictured here, when
quarterback John Elway and the Cardinals take on powerhouse USC tomorrow at the
Coliseum. The previously No.l ranked Trojans come off an embarassing 13-10 loss to Ari
zona last week, while the Cards are still riding high from a 26-23 upset over UCLA.

N0.7 last week after its 13-10 loss to Arizo
na, is among them. If the Card's can win
this week's game and the rest of their sea
son and if Washington State, nowon top of
the Pac-10, loses two, Stanford will go to
the Rose Bowl.
Wait a minute — let's not get carried
away.
Stanford has won only one game this
year and plays one of "the most outstanding
Southern California teams ever this week.

The odds-makers gave USC 14V2 points
yesterday outlining the prevalent feeling
nationally that the Trojans should take
Stanford for a ride.
Heisman Trophy front-runner Marcus
Allen is the major reason why.
Allen, who has 1136 yards rushing in five
games this year, is looking for his sixth
straight 200-yards-plus day against Stan
ford. The 6-foot-2, 202-pound senior
tailback has simply devastated the NCAA
this year behind All-America guard Roy
Foster and tackle Don Mosebar.
Stanford defensive coordinator Jack
Harbaugh looks at him with awe.
"When I was coaching at Michigan (he
was there for seven years) we played
against Charles White, Rickey Bell and
Lynn Cain and Allen is comparable to all of
them," Harbaugh said. "But it's a team
thing. He's a great back, they have a great
line and it's a great concept there. We
haven't put in anything special just be
cause of Allen. We'll just have to match our
best against their best and see what hap
pens."
Stanford's best on defense has been get
ting better all the time, but the Card defen
ders, led recently by Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week Dave Morze, will have
to have the game of their lives to halt the
Allen attack.
The Trojans' loss to Arizona had to take
some of the weight off Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin's shoulders. Allen ran
for 211 yards that day and USC came up
with only the 10 points.

Offensively, Stanford must watch out for
USC linebacker Chip Banks another in a
long line of fast, hard hitting Trojan de
fensemen. Card left tackle Jim Dykstra said
Banks was one of the quickest linebackers
to the ball he had ever seen. Offensive co
ordinator Jim Fassel agrees.
"John Robinson said Banks was the most
dominating defensive player in the coun
try," Fassel said. "I agree. He's awsome. He
gets to the ball so quickly it's incredible."
Fassel said that Stanford will rely again
on t the quick flare-out pass to Darrin
Nelson which worked so well against
UCLA last week. He expects to run the ball
a lot and look to pass it at least as much as
last week, but generally, he said, "We're
gonna try to misdirect people and get the
ball to Darrin in the wide open spaces."
The one thing the Cards can take hope
in is the fact that they have incredibly ex
plosive potential under fire. The last quar
ters of the Purdue, Ohio State and UCLA
games proved that clearly enough. If we
can take the past as example, being 14-
point underdogs could mean a great day
for Stanford football. It did two years ago
when quarterback Turk Schonert brought
the Cards back from a 21-0 halftime deficit
to tie the No.l ranked Trojans in the Col
iseum. Dykstra thinks it could help out
again.
"There's a positive feeling after a win at
practice," the senior said. "It feels good
out here. I think they'll (USC) be mad after
the loss last week but I think we can win it.
We always play well down there."

SEE JOHN RUN — Stanford fans may see a lot of the kind of thing pictured here, when
quarterback John Elway and the Cardinals take on powerhouse USC tomorrow at the
Coliseum. The previously No.l ranked Trojans come off an embarassing 13-10 loss to Ari
zona last week, while the Cards are still riding high from a 26-23 upset over UCLA.
There are three blocks within the foot
ball season which take on special meaning
to any fan of the Stanford game.
The first is opening day when you can sit
back and get your first look at the Cardinal
offense everyone talked about all summer.
The last is Big Game when, no matter what
has happened since opening day, you get
drunk and roar at the rivalry.
The middle block is that two week peri
od at the fulcrum of the season when Stan
ford plays UCLA and USC back to back.
The Cards have usually played a couple of
conference games by that time but it's still
not clear how the season is shaping up. "If
we can just beat those So. Cal schools. . ."
they say.
Well, Stanford beat one of them, UCLA,
last week and thanks (however ironically)
to a scrappy Arizona team, this year's trip
to the Coliseum retains its significance —
despite the Cards' 0-4 start.
Stanford is tied for fourth place in the
Pacific-10 Conference with five other
teams. USC, which dropped from No.l to
N0.7 last week after its 13-10 loss to Arizo
na, is among them. If the Card's can win
