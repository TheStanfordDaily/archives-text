### 
Oakland (AP) â€” Willie Ran
dolph snapped a scoreless tie
with a two-out homer in the
sixth inning and the New York
Yankees captured their 33rd
American League pennant by
beating the Oakland A's 4-0 last
night to complete a three
game sweep of the league
championship series.
Craig Nettles, who already
had driven in six runs in the first
two games of the series, ripped
a two-out three-run double
over the head of cenfferfielder
Rick Bosetti in the ninth inning
to put an end to the 1981 story
of the upstart A's.
Dave Righetti, the Yankees
22-year-old rookie left-hander,
held Oakland scoreless
through six innings, but after
throwing 112 pitches, he was
replaced by Ron Davis and
then Goose Gossage who fin
ished up for the World Series
bound Yankees. In all, they
held the A's to five hits.
Former Yankee managerand
player Billy Martin's A's could
score only four runs in three
games against New York while
the Yankees scored 20.
New York stranded nine
runners through the first five
innings, which took two hours
to play. Finally, Randolph

ended the tension by picking
on a 1-0 delivery by Matt
Keough that he lofted high
over the left field wall for his
first home run since April and
his first in postseason play since
1977.
New York won the first two
games of the AL Championship
Series at Yankee Stadium by
scores of 3-1 and 13-3, setting
playoff records with their run
total and 19 hits in the second
game. It looked like they were
on their way to another rout as
Keough struggled, then wrig
gled from one jam after anoth
er before finally yielding toone
of the Yankees' least potent
bats.
A woeful batting slump
down the stretch had dropped
Randolph from his normal
leadoff spot to ninth in the
New York order. He came into
the game hitting just .214, on 6-
for-28, through seven playoff
games.
In the sixth, though, he final
ly broke out, sending the Yan
kees in quest of their 23rd
World Series championship.
Bob Watson led off the in
ning, and his fly ball to the wall
in right field may have been an
omen. Keough had thrown 70
pitches through four innings,

and nothing looked easy for
the A's right-hander. The next
batter, Rick Cerone, grounded
to third, and that gave Ran
dolph his opportunity.
He had not hit a home run
since April 28, but this one
more than made up for it.
Righetti also struggled in the
early going as the A's had
runners in scoring position in
each of the first three innings.
But he settled down, retiring
the final seven batters he faced
before he was lifted in favor of
Davis.
Davis, who struck out three
in 11-3 innings of relief in game
one of this series, retired six
straight before Gossage came
on in the ninth.
In his stint, Righetti struck
out four and walked two, yield
ing four singles. His worst in
ning was the second, when he
allowed consecutive one-out
singles to Kelvin Moore and
Dave McKay. But he struck out
Jeff Newman, and Rob Picciolo
grounded into an inning-end
ing forceout, as Oakland's best
threat went by the boards.
The Yankees wrapped it up
in the ninth with three un
earned runs. Jerry Mumphrey
led off with a walk, and Larry
Milbourne laid down a sacrfice

bunt to Keough. Everyone was
safe, however, when second
baseman McKay dropped the
throw from his pitcher.
Keough struck out the next
batter, Dave Winfield, and
Martin went to his bullpen.
Tommy Underwood came in
to pitch to Bobby Murcer, who
had replaced Jackson as the
designated hitter, and Lou
Piniella was sent in to hit for
Murcer. Piniella singled to left
but Henderson's replacement,
Mike Heath, cut down Mum
phrey trying to score as
Milbourne went to second.
A sharp single to right by Os
car Gamble loaded the bases
for Nettles.
Nettles, who had gone hit
less in his previous four trips,
hit a long fly ball that seemed to
confuse Bosetti. It eluded his
desperation stab and went to
the base of the wall in center
field, clearing the bases.
In the end, it was the Yan
kees, the big kid on the block,
who prevailed. It wasatriumph
of Bully Ball over Billy Ball.
Now, the Yankees await the
winner of the Montreal-Los
Angeles series, which resumes
tomorrow night in Montreal
tied at one victory apiece.
