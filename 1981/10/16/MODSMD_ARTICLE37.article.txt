Traveling down to see Stanford football this
weekend? While you're there don't forget to
pay a visit to another Cardinal team. The wa
ter polo team also heads South this weekend
for a double header. The Cardinals will do
battle with the USC Trojans Friday night at
7:30 p.m. at the Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.
The second of Stanford's double header will
be against UCLA Saturday morning at 11 a.m.
in Westwood.
Stanford, unofficially ranked No.l and with
a perfect 17-0 record, is attempting to be
come the first team in 12 years to finsh the
season undefeated. The Cards are also look
ing for their fourth NCAA title in six years.
This is the Cardinals' first Pacific-10 road
trip, and head coach Dante Dettamanti is very
enthusiastic. "This is always a very good trip
for us," he said. "The team gets very psyched
and really concentrates on playing good ball.
"Odd as it may seem, we always play these
teams better at their own pools," he added.
USC is ranked N0.7 and, though a young
and erratic team, has upset such highly re

garded powers as Long Beach state and
UCLA. The Trojans had an excellent recruit
ing year that included the signing of Mike
Spicer, the No.l high school player in the na
tion last season.
The Cardinals have faced N0.3 ranked
UCLA twice this season and came out vic
torious in both matches. The Cards' main
game plan will be to shutdown UCLA's senior
hole man Vince Tonne, who fired four goals
in the last meeting between the two teams.
The Stanford water polo team has thor
oughly dominated the collegiate scene this
year, outscoring its opponents almost 3-1 in
total goals. Led by seniors Jody Campbell,
Alan Mouchawar, Chris Kelsey, Bill Taylor,
and Vince Vanelli, the experienced Cards are
regarded as one of the best teams ever to play
the game.
So, if you're in Los Angeles this weekend,
come out to the Plaza, get psyched for Satur
day's football game, and watch Stanford's
winnngest team in its quest for an undefeated
season and yet another NCAA title.
