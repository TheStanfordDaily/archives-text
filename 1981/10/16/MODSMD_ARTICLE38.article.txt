# John Kosner: answers to questions that might bother you
## 
### 
So much of a sportswriter's life involves questions. Do
you ask the right questions when you interview? And,
more to the point, do you have the right answers when
other people ask you challenging questions?
Having found myself besieged by questions this week,
I am anxious to start answering. So here it is — Real, In
credible "Q and A":
Q: Is Yankee owner George Steinbrenner really "the ori
ginal born loser", as Lowell Cohn of the San Francisco
Chronicle', insists?
A: Nope. If anything, George is the original born winner.
A lunatic, sure. But a winner. Always a winner.
After watching the Yankees dismantle Milwaukee last
Sunday evening, my dad remarked that "Steinbrenner
understands two things — capitalism and Darwinism."
Indeed, George's ability to make shiploads of money is
topped only by his knowledge of how to spend that
money.

Steinbrenner doesn't just build one team; he builds a
team and a half. His Yankees are deep, fast, powerful,
deft and — like their owner — irrepressible. They have
become baseball's Grim Reapers. There's Reggie and
Winfield and Guidry and, most of all, there's Goose
Gossage. And that's just the front line.
If George is overly hard on his beloved "overpriced fat
cats," it is only because he expects of them just what he
expects of himself.
Which is everything. And why not? With this club, to
think anything less than a championship is to think like,
well, a loser.
Q: How is Stanford going to do against USC tomorrow?
A: If the improving Card defense can force Trojan quar
terback John Mazur to throw more often than he wants
to, Stanford has an excellent shot of winning this game.
No fooling.
However, if the mammoth SC offensive line has its way

(as it did in last season's 34-9 Trojan romp), marvelous
Marcus Allen (1136vards, 12 touchdowns, and an NCAA
record fivestraight 200-yards-plus rushing efforts in five
outings) might outscore Stanford by himself. As a team,
the Cards have scored four fewer TD's than Allen and
have yet to put the ball in the end zone three times in a
game. To beat USC tomorrow, anything less than three
TD's won't suffice.
Q: Why didn't ABC-TV show highlights of the 49ers re
markable 45-14 wipeout of the Cowboys on Monday
Night Football?
A: ABC didn't show the 49er highlights because the
network is covering the Los Angeles-Dallas game this
Sunday night and didn't want to do anything that might
lessen the ratings for that matchup. While this is predic
table policy, it is also shoddy journalism. For all its hype,
ABC only "tells it like it is" when it feels like it.
Q: Is Washington State (5-0, ranked No. 18 in the nation)

for real?
A: Probably not. The Cougars have really fattened up on
some unspeakable competition (Colorado, Montana
State, Pacific, and Oregon State). The team's one big vic
tory (24-21 over Arizona State) came against a team that
took WSU for granted. No one will do that again. And
that may be the problem — for just look what's coming
up. Tomorrow, UCLA is in Pullman. After that, the
Cougars finish up the month at Arizona (Oct. 24) and
USC (Oct 31). Did anybody say 5-3?
Q: When was the last time Ohio State or Michigan didn't
represent the Big Ten at the Rose Bowl?
A: In 1968, when Indiana went and lost to USC. It could
happen again this year. Wisconsin (4-1, ranked No. 13)
has already beaten Michigan, Purdue, and Ohio State.
However, the Badgers have yet to play a road game and
four of their last six contests are away from Madison

Gossage. And that's just the front line.
If George is overly hard on his beloved "overpriced fat
cats," it is only because he expects of them just what he
expects of himself.
Which is everything. And why not? With this club, to
think anything less than a championship is to think like,
well, a loser.
Q: How is Stanford going to do against USC tomorrow?
A: If the improving Card defense can force Trojan quar
terback John Mazur to throw more often than he wants
to, Stanford has an excellent shot of winning this game.
No fooling.
However, if the mammoth SC offensive line has its way

(as it did in last season's 34-9 Trojan romp), marvelous
Marcus Allen (1136vards, 12 touchdowns, and an NCAA
record fivestraight 200-yards-plus rushing efforts in five
outings) might outscore Stanford by himself. As a team,
the Cards have scored four fewer TD's than Allen and
have yet to put the ball in the end zone three times in a
game. To beat USC tomorrow, anything less than three
TD's won't suffice.
Q: Why didn't ABC-TV show highlights of the 49ers re
markable 45-14 wipeout of the Cowboys on Monday
Night Football?
A: ABC didn't show the 49er highlights because the
network is covering the Los Angeles-Dallas game this
Sunday night and didn't want to do anything that might
lessen the ratings for that matchup. While this is predic
table policy, it is also shoddy journalism. For all its hype,
ABC only "tells it like it is" when it feels like it.
Q: Is Washington State (5-0, ranked No. 18 in the nation)

for real?
A: Probably not. The Cougars have really fattened up on
some unspeakable competition (Colorado, Montana
State, Pacific, and Oregon State). The team's one big vic
tory (24-21 over Arizona State) came against a team that
took WSU for granted. No one will do that again. And
that may be the problem — for just look what's coming
up. Tomorrow, UCLA is in Pullman. After that, the
Cougars finish up the month at Arizona (Oct. 24) and
USC (Oct 31). Did anybody say 5-3?
Q: When was the last time Ohio State or Michigan didn't
represent the Big Ten at the Rose Bowl?
A: In 1968, when Indiana went and lost to USC. It could
happen again this year. Wisconsin (4-1, ranked No. 13)
has already beaten Michigan, Purdue, and Ohio State.
However, the Badgers have yet to play a road game and
four of their last six contests are away from Madison
So much of a sportswriter's life involves questions. Do
you ask the right questions when you interview? And,
more to the point, do you have the right answers when
other people ask you challenging questions?
Having found myself besieged by questions this week,
I am anxious to start answering. So here it is — Real, In
credible "Q and A":
Q: Is Yankee owner George Steinbrenner really "the ori
ginal born loser", as Lowell Cohn of the San Francisco
Chronicle', insists?
A: Nope. If anything, George is the original born winner.
A lunatic, sure. But a winner. Always a winner.
After watching the Yankees dismantle Milwaukee last
Sunday evening, my dad remarked that "Steinbrenner
understands two things — capitalism and Darwinism."
Indeed, George's ability to make shiploads of money is
topped only by his knowledge of how to spend that
money.

Steinbrenner doesn't just build one team; he builds a
team and a half. His Yankees are deep, fast, powerful,
deft and — like their owner — irrepressible. They have
become baseball's Grim Reapers. There's Reggie and
Winfield and Guidry and, most of all, there's Goose
Gossage. And that's just the front line.
If George is overly hard on his beloved "overpriced fat
cats," it is only because he expects of them just what he
expects of himself.
Which is everything. And why not? With this club, to
think anything less than a championship is to think like,
well, a loser.
