# Defensive line wins fame
## 
### Nick Gault 
Stanford's offense aparently rediscovered
itself iri last Saturday's 26-23 victory over UCLA.
News of the offenses' well being, however,
comes as better information to the Cardinal fan
than it has in many a season.
Why? Stanford finally appears to have estab
lished a defense capable of a consistently solid
performance to complement this offense. In
case you hadn't noticed, as most offense-ori
ented fans have not, the defense hasn't allowed
any of the five teams they have faced to pass the
30-point mark.
Over the years the theory on the Farm has
been that if the defense could just keep oppo
nents in the 10-20 point range, the high powered
Cardinal offense would insure a season that fin
ished with a good Bowl game, and not with
Berkeley. It looks like this might be the year that
theory is tested.
Doug Rogers, a four-year starter at defensive
tackle, said "We're definitely playing the best
defense I've seen since I've been at Stanford."
As a veteran lineman, Rogers should know, for
no where else than in the trenches has the
progress been so evident.
The line, made up of Rogers and John Bergren
at tackles and Pat Mitchell at nose guard, has an
altogether different look from the Stanford
fronts of old. Rather than using a "Stand up and
read" approach coming off the ball as did last
year's line, Rogers, Bergren and Mitchell act as
part of the new "attack" defense — now they
make an all out charge with each snap. The new
approach means they don't have to wait for the
play to take shape before reacting.
Bergren said "this has meant we're doing
things on their side of the ball more. We do a lot
of veering or angleing, and we're getting behind
the line more than we could last year."
The success of the line is in large part thanks to
a new, more rigorous conditioning and weight
training program. New strength coach Steve
Schulz has utilized an expanded weight-training
facility to significantly beef up a Cardinal de
fensive line that used to be literally out-muscled
by opposing teams.
"There's no question that the weight-training
and conditioning has helped," affirmed

Bergren. "We're out-playing opponents in the
second half." Rogers agreed. "I feel much better
than I did last year about playing the fourth quar
ter. That's when superior strength really shows
itself," he said.
The strength program has made a new man
out of Bergren in narticular. Boosting his weight
from 215 to 240 pounds, Bergren has strapped
power onto his 6-foot-5 frame. He leads the
team in quarterback sacks, but his inside play
against the run has been perhaps more im
pressive.
Pat Mitchell has also benefited from some
new muscle, going from 215 to 240 pounds over
the summer as well, and making the transition
from inside linebacker to nose guard, a position
he seems better suited to. "I like the line be
cause you get more of a feel for the game," he
said. "I like to be in on every play."
Rogers retains the awesome 6-5, 265-pound
dimensions he has always owned, but it is un
questionably stronger. As a senior and the
squad's third leading tackier (76) and leading
sacker last year with 4, he is looked to as the lead
er of the line.
"Doug, with his skills and size, just has to per
form for us," stated head coach Paul Wiggin.
"Not just fill a position, but be the dominant
player that he can be. He needs to set the tempo
for us.
Tommorow Bergren, Mitchell and Rogers
face the once again monstrous USC offensive
line that has drawn, once again, praise from all
around the country. To make matters worse
there is Marcus Allen, a leading Heisman Trophy
candidate and the man who follows these
behemoths. "We can't even start to think about
Marcus," said Bergren. "First we've got to get
behind their line."
Bergren's memories of last year's USC game
are what he calls, simply, "frustration." The
game was his first college start, and he was thor
oughly bullied. But in the 1980 season Bergren
was a 215-pound freshman. In 1981 he is anxious,
like his two linemates, to show theTrojans some
stuff they aren't accustomed to seeing in a Stan
ford defense: a lot of strength, and a full on at
tack.

of veering or angleing, and we're getting behind
the line more than we could last year."
The success of the line is in large part thanks to
a new, more rigorous conditioning and weight
training program. New strength coach Steve
Schulz has utilized an expanded weight-training
facility to significantly beef up a Cardinal de
fensive line that used to be literally out-muscled
by opposing teams.
"There's no question that the weight-training
and conditioning has helped," affirmed

Bergren. "We're out-playing opponents in the
second half." Rogers agreed. "I feel much better
than I did last year about playing the fourth quar
ter. That's when superior strength really shows
itself," he said.
The strength program has made a new man
out of Bergren in narticular. Boosting his weight
from 215 to 240 pounds, Bergren has strapped
power onto his 6-foot-5 frame. He leads the
team in quarterback sacks, but his inside play
against the run has been perhaps more im
pressive.
Pat Mitchell has also benefited from some
new muscle, going from 215 to 240 pounds over
the summer as well, and making the transition
from inside linebacker to nose guard, a position
he seems better suited to. "I like the line be
cause you get more of a feel for the game," he
said. "I like to be in on every play."
Rogers retains the awesome 6-5, 265-pound
dimensions he has always owned, but it is un
questionably stronger. As a senior and the
squad's third leading tackier (76) and leading
sacker last year with 4, he is looked to as the lead
er of the line.
"Doug, with his skills and size, just has to per
form for us," stated head coach Paul Wiggin.
"Not just fill a position, but be the dominant
player that he can be. He needs to set the tempo
for us.
Tommorow Bergren, Mitchell and Rogers
face the once again monstrous USC offensive
line that has drawn, once again, praise from all
around the country. To make matters worse
there is Marcus Allen, a leading Heisman Trophy
candidate and the man who follows these
behemoths. "We can't even start to think about
Marcus," said Bergren. "First we've got to get
behind their line."
Bergren's memories of last year's USC game
are what he calls, simply, "frustration." The
game was his first college start, and he was thor
oughly bullied. But in the 1980 season Bergren
was a 215-pound freshman. In 1981 he is anxious,
like his two linemates, to show theTrojans some
stuff they aren't accustomed to seeing in a Stan
ford defense: a lot of strength, and a full on at
tack.


TROUBLE IN TROJAN TRENCHES — The Stanford de
fensive line blitzkrieged the Bruin offense last weekend,
and could prove the decisive factor against the USC Tro
jans tomorrow at the Coliseum. Shown here displaying

Keller Strother/Daily
the new "attack" style of play, tackle Doug Rogers
(N0.60), nose guard Pat Mitchel (N0.75) and tackle John
Bergren (N0.85) converge on a Bruin ballcarrier.
Stanford's offense aparently rediscovered
itself iri last Saturday's 26-23 victory over UCLA.
News of the offenses' well being, however,
comes as better information to the Cardinal fan
than it has in many a season.
Why? Stanford finally appears to have estab
lished a defense capable of a consistently solid
performance to complement this offense. In
case you hadn't noticed, as most offense-ori
ented fans have not, the defense hasn't allowed
any of the five teams they have faced to pass the
30-point mark.
Over the years the theory on the Farm has
been that if the defense could just keep oppo
nents in the 10-20 point range, the high powered
Cardinal offense would insure a season that fin
ished with a good Bowl game, and not with
Berkeley. It looks like this might be the year that
theory is tested.
Doug Rogers, a four-year starter at defensive
tackle, said "We're definitely playing the best
defense I've seen since I've been at Stanford."
As a veteran lineman, Rogers should know, for
no where else than in the trenches has the
progress been so evident.
The line, made up of Rogers and John Bergren
at tackles and Pat Mitchell at nose guard, has an
altogether different look from the Stanford
fronts of old. Rather than using a "Stand up and
read" approach coming off the ball as did last
year's line, Rogers, Bergren and Mitchell act as
part of the new "attack" defense — now they
make an all out charge with each snap. The new
approach means they don't have to wait for the
play to take shape before reacting.
Bergren said "this has meant we're doing
things on their side of the ball more. We do a lot
of veering or angleing, and we're getting behind
the line more than we could last year."
