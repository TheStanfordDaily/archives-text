### Adam Berns 
Stanford may have come
close but as everyone knows,
close only counts with horse
shoes and hand grenades, for
the Cardinal soccer team lost a
2-1 heartbreaker Wednesday
night to a highly regarded San
ta Clara team.
Stanford took control of the
game early in the first half by
dominating the midfield and
taking several shots at the Santa
Clara goal. Although the
Cardinals had little trouble get
ting the ball downfield, the op
posing defense stiffened up
considerably whenever they
got close to the goal. One of
the primary reasons why Santa
Clara was able to contain Stan
ford's attack was their marking
of Cardinal striker Willie Giucci
and double marking of leading
scorer Jorge Titinger.

However, with only 47 sec
onds left in the first half, Stan
ford was finally able to score.

After a Santa Clara defender
seemingly misplayed a ball,
Card freshman Angel Vasquez
passed to Giucci who shot the
ball past the goalkeeper.
The Cardinals started the
second half with great control
and precise passes, again domi
nating the midfield. Un
fortunately, Santa Clara's de
fense was difficult to penetrate
because of tight man-to-man
coverage.
Midway through the second
half the game turned around in
one of most frustrating fash
ions possible. After a poor
Stanford pass in ti e midfield,
Santa Clara quickly countered
and striker Richard Smith made
a break for the Stanford goal.
Fouled by a defender, Santa
Clara was awarded a penalty
kick which forward Mark
Hunter made easily, tying the
game.
After the penalty kick the
Cardinals simply let down, in a

replay of last week's loss to
UCLA. The momentum had
shifted to Santa Clara, and a
couple of minutes later for
ward Tony Vertongen faked
out two Stanford defenders
and slid the ball by goalkeeper
Willie Burkhart.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge cited the penalty kick as
the turning point of the game.
Though he genuinely felt his
team should have won the
game, he admitted that Santa
Clara's attack in general was
well executed. "They used a lot
of long passes," he said. "It's a
'run and gun' type of thing and
our defenders had difficulty
keeping up with their quick
strikers."
The most frustrating thing
for Lodge was Santa Clara's
marking of Stanford strikers.
"This was the first time I have
ever seen a team double mark
any of our players," he re
marked. He added that when a
team is playing man-to-man so

extensively, it's necessary for
strikers to lose their marks,
which the Cards were not very
successful in doing.
The most critical problem
the Cardinals now face is not
letting down again, even
though their playoff chances
are considerably diminished.
