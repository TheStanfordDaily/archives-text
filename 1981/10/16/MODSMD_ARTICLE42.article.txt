The Philadelphia Story
Monday, Kresge
This is one oTthose movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play — no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in
cludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over
the Rainbow" as if he'd stake his
reputation on it.

foundry worker, Gladys Belcher,
a former welder, Lyn Childs, a
former burner, Lola Weixel, a
former welder, and Margaret
Wright, a former ammunitions

we hear them tell howthey found
exceptionally fulfilling em

The Interview footage is in
tercut with the propaganda films
made for home consumption
during the war. The contrast be

This film will make you ap

Autumn Sonata ★★★Vi
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ull
man give exciting, obsessively
single minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating, becuase its vision
cannot do justice to either the
performances or Bergman's as
sured visual conception. But your
frustration is, finally, erased by
joy. Even if Bergman was not yet
ready to go all the way with a
movie again, his actresses are,
and they take the movie right to
the limit, roaring through it like
two great ladies of the theater
who haven't forgotten their zest.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with From the Life of the
Marionettes.

Fox, Redwood CHy
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation
Stanley Kurbrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelation finds
mankind ready to make a giant
leap into the unknown. In
Kubrick's vision, what we're leap
ing from is particularly bleak. His
characters are engulfed in tech
nology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendid emptiness of
space, they seem drained and va
cant: they've carried the work
ethic out between the planets.
Space must ultimately be a seduc
tress, and mankind meets its
greater fate only through the
kindness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood, and a computer
named Hal. Plays tomorrow night
only.

Rich and Famous ***
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the
only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston asa
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill
ing to give up any method of
making life more comfortable.
Tonight only, with Network.

Stevie **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The film deals with the life of
Stevie Smith, a poet of middle
class English suburbia and a per
sonal hero for producer/star
Glenda )ackson. "She is one of
our greatest writers." Jackson has
said about her. "She knew that
the real drama of life is lived on a
relatively minute scale."
Besides the timidity of Smith's
character and her colorless life
there is the additional problem of
turning into a film what was ori
ginally a play with the same cast
— Jackson as Stevie and Mona
Washbourne as Lion Aunt. Un
fortunately the film does not live I
up to the challenge, despite the!

brilliant performances by both
jackson and Washbourne. It is
not much more than a play on the
screen.
In spite of its faults, Jackson
almost succeeds in convincing
you to like the film — if you drop
your guaid, you probably will.
—' Jiri Weiss
Arthur
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us lastsummer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, playsa wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Gallipoli ★ * 1 /2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Gunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

The Horse's Mouth *★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness stars as Gulley
Jimson in this adaptation of the
great Joyce Cary Novel. His
jimson has been softened and
sentimentalized. He's no longer
the disagreeable old artist willing
to use anyone in order to con
tinue painting; he's developed
something that 'ooks incredibly
like a heart. But even with that
change, it is difficult to imagine
any actor making a better Jimson
than Guinness. He makes you
feel the man's passion and ner
vous energy; he makes you be
lieve that there's a place in the

Mommie Dearest ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a loan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who hasstudied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this roJe.

The Postman Always Rings
Twice *★
Mountain View Theater
The newest version of James
M. Cain's taut, mean little pot
boiler, starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange, has a convinc
ing period look, and the director,
Bob Kafelson, has done a good
job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
larking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you
take away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
Playing with First Monday in

Festival Cinema, Palo AHo
John Huston directed this very
odd knock-about comedy. It's
never entirely clear what's hap
pening, or why. In its own screwy
way, the film is often funny and
sometimes endearing — but
there's no denying that it's a mess
of a movie. The script, by Truman
Capote, is said to have been writ
ten the night before and handed
to the actors on the set, which
probably explains the somewhat
more-than-usually bemused ex

here a blond, co-stars.

Stardust Memories
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
In this reexamination of his
own career, Woody Allen re
assesses everything he's done
before. Stardust Memories marks
a return to zero in order to begin
anew. The mood is as disturbing
as Interiors; the structure is as
loose as Bananas. The final result
is different from anything Allen's
done before: freed from the con
fines of a strict storyline, Allen
runs wild through half-forgotten
fantasies and half-remembered
romantic interludes.
After the premiere of Man
hattan, Allen maintained that his
next film would be a comedy
without jokes. There are fokes in
Stardust Memories — some great
ones — but Allen's prediction
captures the feel of his latest film.
Stardust Memories is a drama
without a storyline.
— J.M.
Raiders of the Lost Ark ★★
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Raiders is a tribute to the ad

(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur

The Philadelphia Story
Monday, Kresge
This is one oTthose movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play — no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in
cludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over

reputation on it.

Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ull
man give exciting, obsessively

And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be

softened by Cukor's patience

The film deals with the life of

Glenda )ackson. "She is one of
our greatest writers." Jackson has
said about her. "She knew that
the real drama of life is lived on a

Besides the timidity of Smith's
character and her colorless life
there is the additional problem of
turning into a film what was ori

— Jackson as Stevie and Mona
Washbourne as Lion Aunt. Un
fortunately the film does not live I
up to the challenge, despite the!

brilliant performances by both

For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad

less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog

Mommie Dearest ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a loan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who hasstudied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus

The Postman Always Rings
Twice *★
Mountain View Theater
The newest version of James
M. Cain's taut, mean little pot
boiler, starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange, has a convinc
ing period look, and the director,
Bob Kafelson, has done a good
job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
larking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you
take away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
Playing with First Monday in

py little thriller, made on a shoe

is about paranoia, pure, simple,
and nasty: inhabitants of a small
Californian town realize, with
somewhat of a shock, that their
friends, lovers and relatives have
been replaced by emotionless
clones It's one of those silly ideas
that really gets to you — you'll be

sometimes endearing — but
there's no denying that it's a mess
of a movie. The script, by Truman
Capote, is said to have been writ

to the actors on the set, which
probably explains the somewhat
more-than-usually bemused ex

John Huston directed this very

sometimes endearing — but
there's no denying that it's a mess
of a movie. The script, by Truman

probably explains the somewhat

Stardust Memories
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
In this reexamination of his
own career, Woody Allen re
assesses everything he's done
before. Stardust Memories marks
a return to zero in order to begin
anew. The mood is as disturbing
as Interiors; the structure is as
loose as Bananas. The final result
is different from anything Allen's
done before: freed from the con
fines of a strict storyline, Allen
runs wild through half-forgotten
fantasies and half-remembered
romantic interludes.
After the premiere of Man
hattan, Allen maintained that his
next film would be a comedy
without jokes. There are fokes in
Stardust Memories — some great
ones — but Allen's prediction
captures the feel of his latest film.
Stardust Memories is a drama

Raiders of the Lost Ark ★★
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent

none of it. Raiders was made in an

The Philadelphia Story
Monday, Kresge
This is one oTthose movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play — no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in
cludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over

And, sometimes, it is graceful.

best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers

softened by Cukor's patience

The film deals with the life of

Glenda )ackson. "She is one of
our greatest writers." Jackson has
said about her. "She knew that
the real drama of life is lived on a

Besides the timidity of Smith's
character and her colorless life
there is the additional problem of
turning into a film what was ori

— Jackson as Stevie and Mona
Washbourne as Lion Aunt. Un
fortunately the film does not live I
up to the challenge, despite the!

brilliant performances by both

Gallipoli ★ * 1 /2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Gunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic

the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog

Alec Guinness stars as Gulley

something that 'ooks incredibly
like a heart. But even with that
change, it is difficult to imagine
any actor making a better Jimson

Mommie Dearest ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a loan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who hasstudied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this roJe.

job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
larking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you

Mommie Dearest ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a loan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who hasstudied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this roJe.

The Postman Always Rings
Twice *★
Mountain View Theater
The newest version of James
M. Cain's taut, mean little pot
boiler, starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange, has a convinc
ing period look, and the director,
Bob Kafelson, has done a good
job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
larking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you
take away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

sometimes endearing — but
there's no denying that it's a mess

Stardust Memories
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
In this reexamination of his
own career, Woody Allen re

a return to zero in order to begin
anew. The mood is as disturbing
as Interiors; the structure is as
loose as Bananas. The final result
is different from anything Allen's
done before: freed from the con
fines of a strict storyline, Allen
runs wild through half-forgotten
fantasies and half-remembered
romantic interludes.
After the premiere of Man

next film would be a comedy
without jokes. There are fokes in
Stardust Memories — some great
ones — but Allen's prediction
captures the feel of his latest film.

Raiders is a tribute to the ad

represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted

George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the

It has been acclaimed by the ov

a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur

The Philadelphia Story
Monday, Kresge
This is one oTthose movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barry stage play — no photo
graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in
cludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew

said about her. "She knew that

Besides the timidity of Smith's

Gallipoli ★ * 1 /2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Gunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Gunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Alec Guinness stars as Gulley
Jimson in this adaptation of the
great Joyce Cary Novel. His
jimson has been softened and
sentimentalized. He's no longer
the disagreeable old artist willing
to use anyone in order to con
tinue painting; he's developed
something that 'ooks incredibly
like a heart. But even with that
change, it is difficult to imagine
any actor making a better Jimson
than Guinness. He makes you
feel the man's passion and ner

lieve that there's a place in the
world for dreamers.

Mommie Dearest ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a loan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who hasstudied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this roJe.

The Postman Always Rings

Mountain View Theater
The newest version of James
M. Cain's taut, mean little pot
boiler, starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange, has a convinc

Bob Kafelson, has done a good
job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
larking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you
take away James Cain's scummy

In this reexamination of his

is different from anything Allen's

runs wild through half-forgotten

romantic interludes.
After the premiere of Man

It has been acclaimed by the ov

confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very

The Philadelphia Story
Monday, Kresge
This is one oTthose movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip

Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir

aren't just anybody: the cast in

The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean spirited (like Ed

ters itself away. Julie Andrews

Stevie **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The film deals with the life of
Stevie Smith, a poet of middle
class English suburbia and a per
sonal hero for producer/star
Glenda )ackson. "She is one of
our greatest writers." Jackson has
said about her. "She knew that
the real drama of life is lived on a
relatively minute scale."
Besides the timidity of Smith's
character and her colorless life
there is the additional problem of
turning into a film what was ori
ginally a play with the same cast
— Jackson as Stevie and Mona
Washbourne as Lion Aunt. Un
fortunately the film does not live I
up to the challenge, despite the!

brilliant performances by both
jackson and Washbourne. It is
not much more than a play on the
screen.
In spite of its faults, Jackson
almost succeeds in convincing
you to like the film — if you drop
your guaid, you probably will.

Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,

comedies that were foisted upon
us lastsummer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, playsa wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the
only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston asa
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill
ing to give up any method of
making life more comfortable.

Stevie **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The film deals with the life of
Stevie Smith, a poet of middle
class English suburbia and a per
sonal hero for producer/star
Glenda )ackson. "She is one of
our greatest writers." Jackson has
said about her. "She knew that
the real drama of life is lived on a
relatively minute scale."
Besides the timidity of Smith's
character and her colorless life
there is the additional problem of
turning into a film what was ori
ginally a play with the same cast
— Jackson as Stevie and Mona
Washbourne as Lion Aunt. Un
fortunately the film does not live I
up to the challenge, despite the!

brilliant performances by both
jackson and Washbourne. It is
not much more than a play on the
screen.
In spite of its faults, Jackson
almost succeeds in convincing
you to like the film — if you drop
your guaid, you probably will.

Arthur
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us lastsummer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, playsa wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Gallipoli ★ * 1 /2
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Gunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

The Horse's Mouth *★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness stars as Gulley
Jimson in this adaptation of the
great Joyce Cary Novel. His
jimson has been softened and
sentimentalized. He's no longer
the disagreeable old artist willing
to use anyone in order to con
tinue painting; he's developed
something that 'ooks incredibly
like a heart. But even with that
change, it is difficult to imagine
any actor making a better Jimson
than Guinness. He makes you
feel the man's passion and ner
vous energy; he makes you be
lieve that there's a place in the
world for dreamers.
Ronald Neame directed. Plays
next Thursday with Brian Forbes'
The Wrong Box.

Mommie Dearest ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a loan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who hasstudied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this roJe.

The Postman Always Rings
Twice *★
Mountain View Theater
The newest version of James
M. Cain's taut, mean little pot
boiler, starring Jack Nicholson
and Jessica Lange, has a convinc
ing period look, and the director,
Bob Kafelson, has done a good
job of recreating a desolate, un
derpopulated patch of rural Cali
fornia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
larking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige —
including the casting of Jack
Nicholson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direc
tion, which seems to be telling us
to study carefully what requires
no more than a glance. For if you
take away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
Playing with First Monday in
October.

Invasion of the Body
Snatchers ***
Fox, Redwood City
Don Siegel directed this snap
py little thriller, made on a shoe
string budget in the '50s but bet
ter looking than most other mov
ies of that period or this. The story
is about paranoia, pure, simple,
and nasty: inhabitants of a small
Californian town realize, with
somewhat of a shock, that their
friends, lovers and relatives have
been replaced by emotionless
clones It's one of those silly ideas
that really gets to you — you'll be
anxiously examining the face of
your companion as you leave for
signs of spiritual emptiness.
Starts next Thursday with Vil
lage of (he Damned.

Beat the Devil ★ *'/;
Festival Cinema, Palo AHo
John Huston directed this very
odd knock-about comedy. It's
never entirely clear what's hap
pening, or why. In its own screwy
way, the film is often funny and
sometimes endearing — but
there's no denying that it's a mess
of a movie. The script, by Truman
Capote, is said to have been writ
ten the night before and handed
to the actors on the set, which
probably explains the somewhat
more-than-usually bemused ex
pression Humphrey Bogart af
fects throughout. Jennifer Jones,
here a blond, co-stars.
Double-billed through
Wednesday with Pulp, starring
Michael Caine.

Stardust Memories
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
In this reexamination of his
own career, Woody Allen re
assesses everything he's done
before. Stardust Memories marks
a return to zero in order to begin
anew. The mood is as disturbing
as Interiors; the structure is as
loose as Bananas. The final result
is different from anything Allen's
done before: freed from the con
fines of a strict storyline, Allen
runs wild through half-forgotten
fantasies and half-remembered
romantic interludes.
After the premiere of Man
hattan, Allen maintained that his
next film would be a comedy
without jokes. There are fokes in
Stardust Memories — some great
ones — but Allen's prediction
captures the feel of his latest film.
Stardust Memories is a drama
without a storyline.

Raiders of the Lost Ark ★★
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.
