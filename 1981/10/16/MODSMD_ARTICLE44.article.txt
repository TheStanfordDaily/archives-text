The Student Entrepreneur's
Guide — How to Start and Run
Your Own Parttime Small Busi
ness, written by Brett King
stone, is a 159-page book
which purports to be "a basic
how-to guide for students who
are interested in starting a part
time small business." The first
75 and last 21 pages of the book
are superfluous to this point.
The remaining 63 pages, how
ever, are worth the $4.95 asking
price, if you are serious about
starting a small business.
In order to create a docu
ment thick enough to be mar
keted as a serious publication,
Kingstone incorporated a sig
nificant amount of chest-beat
ing and examples of how oth
ers have started their own busi
ness. This portion of the book,
which is by far the largest sec
tion of the book, would be in
teresting to those who are avid
fans of Brett Kingstone or
would like to read how others
have profited by their often
unique and creative business
ventures. These portions of the
book, however, are not to the
point. The two primary "how
to" sections, "Getting Started"
and "Administering the Busi
ness," however, are quite use
ful.
Having started two corpo
rations myself, and being a
CPA, I can relate to much of

what is covered in the "Getting
Started" section. Kingstone has
done an admirable job of pro
viding check lists and repro
ductions of the numerous bu
reaucratic forms and pro
cedures which are necessary to
do business in the state of Cali
fornia. In addition, most other
states have similar forms and
procedures to those of Califor
nia. Bv reviewing the require
ments for the state of Califor
nia, a reader should be able to
muddle through the filing pro
cedures in other states. The
way Kingstone has written this
section, with little narrative
and a lot of reproduction of
forms is quite useful, especially
to students who decide to go
through the process. It should
be emphasized here, that a Stu
dent Entrepreneur's Guide is
not all inclusive. It does not
purport to explain exactly how
to complete every form, nor
does it guarantee that every
form necessary to operate your
particular business is listed or
described.
The "Administering the
Business" section could fall
into the category of "a little bit
of knowledge is dangerous." It
is obviously impossible to cov
er all the accounting, legal and
tax implications necessary to
consider when starting a small
business. This 41-page section,
27 pages of which are repro
duction of forms, is a fairly use
ful survey of the types of ac
counting, legal and tax con
siderations which must be
thought through prior to the

establishment of any business.
However, it is my opinion that
no potential businessperson
should rely exclusively on the
information presented in this
chapter. For example, the area
of payroll taxes and income
taxes is so technical and impor
tant that it warrants specific in
vestigation based on each busi
ness' unique circumstances.

Upon reading Kingstone's
summary of how to comply
with these provisions, the
reader may get the opinion
that the book tells it all.
I do not want to give the
wrong impression. This portion
of the book is extremely useful
to anyone considering starting
a business, if it is used as a sam
ple of what needs to be con
sidered, rather than an all-in
clusive list of what to do. Of
course, this can be said for the
entire book.
In summary, The Student En
trepreneur's Guide — How to
Start and Run Your Own Part
time Small Business is worth
$4.95. However, you should
not follow it like a cookbook. If
you have started your own
small business, or are thinking
of starting a small business, es
pecially if you are a parttime
entrepreneur, I recommend
that you buy and read this
book, but don't stop there. This
book is quite shallow in very
important areas. It would be
impossible for any book to go
into depth regarding ev
erything that needs to be con
sidered when starting a busi
ness. Many of these considera
tions are specific to the type
and location of the business. If
you are going to start a busi
ness, be sure to thoroughly
search not only your business
and the market you are trying
to serve, but the local bureau
cratic requirements and the le
gal and tax requirements nec
essary to comply with the laws
of the jurisdiction in which you
are going to operate.
