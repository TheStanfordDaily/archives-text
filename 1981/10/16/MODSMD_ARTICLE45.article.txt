Mazes and Monsters
by Rona Jaffe
Delacorte Press
$13.95, 329pp.
What could possibly be
the saving grace of a book
that is so obviously about
the game Dungeons and
Dragons that the book edi
tor felt compelled to seek
out a "D&D" player to write
the review?
Believe it or not, that self
same downfall, a fixation
with the "D&D" game,
works not only to redeem
the book, but is also the
point of departure for Rona
Jaffe's entertaining novel,
Mazes and Monsters. The
book centers around four
college students who meet
several times a week to play
the game, and as the plot
thickens they become more
obssessed with the game,
and their characters. The
book presents an interest
ing portrait of human rela
tionships, for when each of
the students joins in the
game, the reader is told of
their upbringing and home
life, and thus, their chosen
characters in the game seem
to fit neatly into place in
their lives.
Although it is interesting
enough, in and of itself, the
novel doesn't take off until
Robbie, one of the players,
disappears, disrupting both
the game and the lives of the
other students.
It seems that Robbie's dis

appearance is somehow
linked to the character he
had played in the game, and
the circumstances and na
ture of his disappearance
are eerie enough to frighten
the other players into stop
ping the game, and destroy
ing all their gaming imple
ments.
Unfortunately, the police
hear about the connection
between the game and the
missing boy, and soon the
press has picked up on the
story. Robbie's frightened
friends continue to deny
their involvement with the
game, and they try to go on

with their lives, while still
wondering what has hap
pened to their missing
friend.
The book moves quickly
once the characters are set
up and the story line begins
to unfold. The ending sur
prises and saddens the
reader, leaving one to
ponder the thin line be
tween fantasy and reality.
Mazes and Monsters is
quite unlike other novels
written about "D&D" for it

is not just another written
out version of what hap
pened to a group of players
on an adventure. The book
manages to use the game as
a vehicle for the plot, and
non-initiates to the "D&D"
game can follow the plot
and enjoy the book as well
as anyone else.
In fact, if you've never
played the game and have
been wondering about it, or
know a friend you'd like to
introduce to the game, this
book is an excellent guide
to the fundamentals and in
tracacies of "D&D."
Mazes and Monsters is
Jaffe's eleventh novel; it fol
lows her recent success in
Class Reunion, one of the
top novels of the last two
years. Jaffe seems equally
skillful in the genre of a sus
pense thriller.
Jaffe is concerned not
only with how one plays
"D&D" but with what hap
pens to those who partici
pate in it. She explores the
world of today's college stu
dents and their parents and
is sensitive to the relations
between them. The
scenario she paints is both
realistic and frightening.
Finally, Jaffe describes in
Mazes and Monsters a Me
dieval war game which at
tracts college students of to
day's generation, thus pres
enting a complex view of
what many people consider
merely a fantasy game.
