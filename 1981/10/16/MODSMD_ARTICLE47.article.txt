# Kim's 'Inversions' a revelation in science and art

Inversions
by Scott Kim
BYTE Books
$8.95, 122pp.
On the cover of Inversions artist and
writer Scott Kim describes his recent
book as "a catalogue of calligraphic
cartwheels." Inversions, however, is not
merely a catalogue of innovative design
but a highly stylized personal product
that tests the reader's visual perception
and belief that what he recognizes is real.
Though Scott may be a familiar figure to
some on the Farm, others will be curious
as to the identity of Scott Kim. This identi
ty, like Scott's book, cannot be simply ex
plained. I had the opportunity to in
terview Scott last week and found this in
tense and personable young man still
breathless from an East Coast promo
tional book tour.
Scott is a graduate student in computer
science and art, and is working toward a
doctorate in computer typography. His
undergraduate degree at Stanford was re
ceived in yet another field, music. Scott's
diversity and creative momentum are evi
dent as he speaks about the publication of
Inversions, describing it as "the natural
next step in my career," and one cannot
conceive of it as anything but that.
While Scott attributes Stanford Art Prof.
Matt Kahn's class in basic design as a
motivating force toward the pursuit of
graphic art, he was not previously particu
larly fascinated by art itself. Instead, he
says that "I was infected very early with
the romance of the alphabet." What Scott
learned by playing with letters was so im
pressive that BYTE Books, a computer
company and division of McGraw-Hill,
supported Scott's publication after seeing
his work.
The uniqueness of Inversions stems
from the fact that Scott personally
directed every aspect of publication.
"This was extremely important to me,"
said Scott. "During about 1 Vi years I
wrote, designed, illustrated and typeset
the book. My experience came from
helping Computer Science Assoc. Prof.
Doug Hofstadter (who wrote the fore
ward to Inversions) with the production
of his book, Godel, Esther, Bach: an
Eternal Golden Braid "
In Kim's own introduction he states his
motif: "The essential theme of Inversions
is that we can see the nature of a subject
more clearly when we turn it upside
down." The title of the book describes

the process through which Scott trans
forms, reverses and geometrically or
ganizes word and letter forms. Scott's in
novation emerges with his choice of a title
as well as with his art; Inversions captures
the right connotation and more im
portantly to Scott, is itself a rotational in
version of the author's name.
The book is neatly arranged by Kim. A
series of visually striking images of words
that literally jump off the page strictly
adheres to Scott's initial statement,
"Always I have tried to make the style of
the lettering reflect the meaning of the
word. Thus the form echoes the content."
One discovers 57 spellbinding pages of
words that describe symmetries: upside
down, infinity, calligraphic themes:
Merry Christmas, Alphabet, and historical
and contemporary names: Pilobolus,
Asimov, Gutenberg, Einstein, and a varie
ty of other words invoking visual design.
The basic colors used by Scott are black
against white with occasional bright red
to highlight a word within a word or re
petitive pattern.

The accompanying text is as structurally
cohesive as are Scott's images; he begins
with a discussion of symmetry and let
terforrns then continues with actual step
by-step guidelines for a reader per
forming an inversion. Lovers of the fine
arts in general will find Scott's final sec
tion valuable. He suggests the association
of inversions to disciplines such as music
and art, where the mental processes in
volved are (he same.
I found Scott's definition of symmetry
startling. We learn that though the ex
perience is very familiar, we have a very
limited vocabulary with which to talk
about it. In Scott's words, "most of us rare
ly practice putting visual and spatial con
cepts into words, we do not verbally dist
inguish between left/right and
top/bottom symmetry, even though we
know the two reversals are visually dif
ferent." Scott expands our vocabulary to
include other spatial and non-spatial
transforms. This part of Inversions forces
the reader to consider carefully visual
concepts he takes for granted
Kim emphasizes the necessity of under-

standing the ambiguity and relational
characteristics of symmetry as a pre-req
uisite to drawing an inversion. The sym
metric design based on a word or name
must satisfy both legibility and symmetry
in a manner appropriate to the meaning
of the word. Given this standard, I asked
Scott whelher any artistic neophyte such
as myself could ever attempt an inversion.
"I think most people could produce an
inversion," said Scott. "The most impor
tant thing is to really think about writing,
about the alphabet, and then to con
sciously sharpen one's perception:
through visual exercises. I usually know
within several minutes whether an in
version will work out."
Scott became animated as he discussed
his favorite inversions. Sequoia, designed
for a campus literary publication, is one of
Scott's first designs. The designs Scott
created with the words Synergy and
Pilobolus are other examples of in
versions that have become synonomous
with campus organizations. Infinity is an
other of Scott's favorites; he likes the

mental freedom it invokes and the fact
i.idt it is computer generated. Approx
imately one-third of Scott's designs were
pioduced in conjunction with a com
puter
Scott's dynamic use of computers fol
lows other well-defined goals. "My aim,"
said Scott, "is to be able to support my
work in computer science with rny art."
Again Scott has turned the usual rela
tionship upside-down. "Many artists fear
computers," he explained. "Computers
should be a tool for artists to allow new
sorts of experimentation." Scott hopes to
build a computer program which would
be used by a typesetter to augment the
use of typeface. Ultimately, he would like
to expand the field of word-processing so
that everyone can be his own typesetter.
Scott singled out his computer science
advisor, Prof. Donald Knuth, for en
couragement and inspiration in the de
sign of typeface.
Scott's approach to the computer is
novel, for he views it as an instrument
which allows the artist to have greater
personal control over his work as he is
able to typeset and arrange his own pa
pers, and anticipateaudience reactions to
his designs.
What other explorations will Scott
Kim's future take? The Los Angeles-raised
graduate student plans to continue his
upside down interpretation of the world
with an eventual sequel to Inversions. "In
the meantime," said Scott, "I want to
enter the graphic arts business, work on
logo designs to be used on cards, posters,
and t-shirts, and possibly devise films
based purely on visual word-play." Scott
recently devised a logo for Scientific
American Inversions will also spark lec
tures; Scott would like to voice issues
contained therein such as an awareness of
letters and their history, calligraphy, and
the relation of computers and art.
The fluidity and deftness of Scott Kim's
vision has infused every page of In
versions. I found the $8.95 price a bargain
when you consider that you gain not only
a beautiful book but a new perspicacity
on the world. Inversions is now available
at the Bookstore in paperback; Scott will
hold a book-signing and discussion date
in upcoming weeks. For all those who
persist in maintaining that "seeing is be
lieving," an hour with Scott Kim and In
versions should challenge their faith and
propose new ideas about the significnace
of art.
