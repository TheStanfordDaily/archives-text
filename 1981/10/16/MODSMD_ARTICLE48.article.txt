Senate committee downs AWACS sale
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations committee
voted vesterday in favor of killing an $8.5 billion sale of U.S.
air defense weapons to Saudi Arabia, but the Reagan admin
istration inched ahead in its search for votes for the final
showdown in Congress later this month.
Before the vote, President Ronald Reagan persuaded Sen.
Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) to vote for the sale.
Pressler said the president had satisfied him that he will
shortly send Congress assurances that the security of the so
phisticated weapons technology will be protected.
Pressler, who had been intensely lobbied by the adminis
tration said he went into the committee meeting prepared to
vote against the sale unless satisfactory assurances from the
president were forthcoming.
He said his decision was based not only on assurances the
president gave him by phone but also on Reagan's emphasis
that his personal prestige is "on the line."
Yesterday, the administration won its first test vote in the
AWACS debate. The Senate Armed Services Committee re
leased a report, concluding that the proposed sale was in the
United States' national security interest.
Reagan refuses to boost foreign aid
1 Philadelphia — President Ronald Reagan assailed the Sovi
et Union yesterday as having nothing to offer the global
poor, while he rejected the claims of "some shrill voices"
that he is tightfisted with America's helping hand.
Reagan offered no promise of boosted foreign aid in the
vears to come — though he noted the United States already
gives more than any other nation.
Instead, he said a greater contribution "is to follow
through with our own economic recovery" coupled with
greater private investment in foreign trade.
"By getting our own economic house in order, we win,
they win, we all win," the president said, referring to the in
dustrial democracies on one hand and the poorest nations
on the other.
The speech, before the World Affairs Council, affirmed
Reagan's thoughts on international economics.
Demos seek to restore Social Security
Washington — Democrats pressed for a multibillion
doliar tax increase upon the oil industry as the Senate de
bated yesterday legislation to restore the $122 minimum So
cial Security benefit for more than 2.5 million recipients.
Republican aides expressed confidence that a combina
tion of GOP senators and severai Democrats would defeat
the move by Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) to repeal a por
tion of the "windfall profits" tax reduction Congress gave
the oil industry earlier this year. The reduction of the tax on
"newly discovered" oil was part of a bill to cut personal in
come taxes over three years.
Eagleton said his proposal would raise about $14.2 billion
through 1990. The money would be earmarked for a new So
cial Security Reserve Trust Fund.
Republicans said the tax break granted earlier this year is
an incentive to explore for more domestic oil and help the
country lessen its dependence on imports.
But with the defeat of the amendment, the Senate was ex
pected to vote final approval for restoration of the Social Se
curity minimum benefit. Reagan is expected to sign the bill.
The House has voted to restore the minimum Social Secur
ity benefit for all three million recipients.
The Senate measure would restore the minimum benefit
for current recipients except for those whose income from
federal, state or local government pension exceeds $300 a
month.
AWACS jets patrol over Egypt
Cairo — Two U.S. Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) jets arrived yesterday from their base in Oklahoma
to provide Egypt's new president, Hosni Mubarak, with a
concrete symbol of U.S. support for his government.
The planes arrived as Mubarak announced his 31-member
Cabinet, which was virtually the same as that of his slain

predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
Attention in Egypt focused on the arrival of the U.S. radar
planes. Announcement ir\ Washington that the AWACS
would be immediately deployed here was greeted with satis
faction by the Egyptian government, which said the real rea
son for the planes' arrival was to patrol its tense western
border with Libya.
When the planes had been expected to land, the word
circulated that the AWACS had entered Egyptian air space
and would soon be at Cairo West. However, apparently on
orders from the U.S. military, they were diverted to another
"undisclosed" Egyptian airfield.
However, General Nasser announced a "change pf plans"
— the AWACS on entering Egyptian air space had im
mediately gone on patrol and would not be landing until
midnight.
Nasser said the decision was "political" but he did not
know whether it had been taken by the Egyptian or U.S. gov
ernment.
A U.S Embassy spokesmen, queried about Nasser's asser
tion that both AWACS had been put on immediate duty
without even landing and with their'trews unrested, in
dicated that the AWACS had not actually begun flying mis
sions yet.
While here to attend Sadat's funeral, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig met with Mubarak, Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali and the defense minister, Gen. Abdel Halim Abu
Ghazala, to promise continued U.S. support.
Haig announced the expansion of previously planned
joint military maneuvers in Egypt's western desert andagree
ment to step up deliveries of military hardware. He also
hinted at new commitments of support, both military and ec
onomic, for Sudan.
Reagan seeks to restrict FOIA
Washington — The Reagan administration downgraded
the Freedom of Information Act yesterday as "a highly over
rated instrument" for disclosing official misdeeds and urged
Congress to adopt a wide-ranging set of restrictions on it for
the sake of "effective government."
Testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, Asst.
Attornev General lonathan Rose offered a new set of restric
tions and other changes that he said would make it far less
expensive and burdensome to administer.
The proposed amendments would accord far more secre
cy to law enforcement records, business data, and ail types of
records "concerning individuals" than they have under
present law.
The administration bill would also change the definition of
government records within the reach of the law so that it
would no longer be able to touch "diaries, journals, tele
phone logs, desk calendars, or personal or research notes"
that government officials often keep.
Another provision in the bill would whittle down the au
thority that federal courts have under current law to de
termine whether national security information was properly
classified.
Under the bill Rose presented, which has been entitled
"The Freedom of Information Improvements Act," the
courts could order the release of classified documents only
on a finding that the government's decision to keep them se
cret was "arbitrary and capricious."
The Justice Department argued that this would constitute
little change from present practice anyway, since the courts
are already obliged to give "substantial weight" to the "ex
pertise" of the government agencies involved.
Bulgarian wins Nobel literature prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Elias Canetti, a shy and reclusive
Bulgarian-born writer whose works reflect themes of death
and the Nazi regime he fled, won the 1981 Nobel Prize in lit
erature Wednesday.
The 76-year-old author of plays, novels and memoirs writ
ten in German was cited by the Swedish Academy "for writ
ings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic
power."
Canetti has been widely known for five decades iri Europe
an literary circles but his translated works have sold only

about 100,000 copies in the United States since the 19405, ac
cording to his New York publisher, The Crossroad Publishing
Co.
Michael Samuel of the BBC's Bulgarian section said Canet
ti was so shy he refused to be interviewed. He described the
author as "really more of a philosopher than a writer" who
was strongly influenced by Franz Kafka. Samuel said Canetti
was a prolific writer "at one time" but has not written any
thing in recent years.
Canetti, who lives in England and is a naturalized British
subject, has spent time in Switzerland and Austria, where he
learned German.
Gandhi suspicious of no-war pact
New Delhi — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, speaking at a
time of growing concern here among Indians and diplomats
alike that a fourth war between India and Pakistan might be
looming on the horizon, yesterday declared that India will
not provoke a war with its neighbor and rival to the west.
She added, however, that Pakistan's offer of a no-war pact
with India raised suspicions because it was coupled with the
acceptance of sophisticated weapons from the United States.
U.S. Seriate action on part of the U.S. aid package to Pakistan
could come as early as next week.
One senior Western diplomat went so far in a briefing for
American correspondents late last month to predict that
there is a "slightly better than 50-50 chance" of a Indo-Paki
stan war within the next two years that would be instigated
bv India because "Indira Gandhi just cannot tolerate a re
surgent Pakistan which will constitute somewhat of a threat
to India."
Gandhi appeared to be trying to set these fears to rest in an
interview yesterday with three correspondents for American
publications.
Govt, resumes Solidarity negotiations
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government resumed nego
tiations with the Solidarity union movement for the first time
in two months here yesterday, hoping to avert a major con
frontation over the country's food crisis.
The talks opened in an atmosphere of tension, with the
200-member Polish Communist Party Central Committee
scheduled to begin a potentially volatile plenary meeting to
day and continued labor unrest in the country.
In the central Polish city of Piotrkow, Solidarity and pro
government trade unions have set up a joint strike commit
tee in protest over food shortages. It is believed to be the first
such collaboration since Solidarity was founded, and it il
lustrates that anger over the government's handling of the
food situation cuts across political lines.
In a related development, an influential group of Polish in
tellectuals released a statement yesterday saying that the cur
rent government has become "paralyzed," and that a new
coalition government of national compromise should be
formed. Although there were few details, the statement said
that the ministries of defense, foreign affairs and interior
should be reserved for the Polish United Workers (Com
munist) Party.
Market stages modest rally
New York — The stock market staged a modest rally yes
terday with many of the blue-chip and glamor issues that
sold off Wednesday leading the recovery.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials, off 14.93 points in
the previous session, rebounded 5.61 to 856.26.
The daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange showed
about eight issues advancing in price for every seven that lost
ground, and the exchange's composite index rose .42 to
69.39.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with a few patchy morning low
clouds near the ocean. Lows in the 40s to low 50s. Highs in the
60s to mid 70s. Westerly winds to 20 mph afternoons.

Senate committee downs AWACS sale
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations committee
voted vesterday in favor of killing an $8.5 billion sale of U.S.
air defense weapons to Saudi Arabia, but the Reagan admin
istration inched ahead in its search for votes for the final
showdown in Congress later this month.
Before the vote, President Ronald Reagan persuaded Sen.
Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) to vote for the sale.
Pressler said the president had satisfied him that he will
shortly send Congress assurances that the security of the so
phisticated weapons technology will be protected.
Pressler, who had been intensely lobbied by the adminis
tration said he went into the committee meeting prepared to
vote against the sale unless satisfactory assurances from the
president were forthcoming.
He said his decision was based not only on assurances the
president gave him by phone but also on Reagan's emphasis
that his personal prestige is "on the line."
Yesterday, the administration won its first test vote in the
AWACS debate. The Senate Armed Services Committee re
leased a report, concluding that the proposed sale was in the
United States' national security interest.
Reagan refuses to boost foreign aid
1 Philadelphia — President Ronald Reagan assailed the Sovi
et Union yesterday as having nothing to offer the global
poor, while he rejected the claims of "some shrill voices"
that he is tightfisted with America's helping hand.
Reagan offered no promise of boosted foreign aid in the
vears to come — though he noted the United States already
gives more than any other nation.
Instead, he said a greater contribution "is to follow
through with our own economic recovery" coupled with
greater private investment in foreign trade.
"By getting our own economic house in order, we win,
they win, we all win," the president said, referring to the in
dustrial democracies on one hand and the poorest nations
on the other.
The speech, before the World Affairs Council, affirmed
Reagan's thoughts on international economics.
Demos seek to restore Social Security
Washington — Democrats pressed for a multibillion
doliar tax increase upon the oil industry as the Senate de
bated yesterday legislation to restore the $122 minimum So
cial Security benefit for more than 2.5 million recipients.
Republican aides expressed confidence that a combina
tion of GOP senators and severai Democrats would defeat
the move by Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) to repeal a por
tion of the "windfall profits" tax reduction Congress gave
the oil industry earlier this year. The reduction of the tax on
"newly discovered" oil was part of a bill to cut personal in
come taxes over three years.
Eagleton said his proposal would raise about $14.2 billion
through 1990. The money would be earmarked for a new So
cial Security Reserve Trust Fund.
Republicans said the tax break granted earlier this year is
an incentive to explore for more domestic oil and help the
country lessen its dependence on imports.
But with the defeat of the amendment, the Senate was ex
pected to vote final approval for restoration of the Social Se
curity minimum benefit. Reagan is expected to sign the bill.
The House has voted to restore the minimum Social Secur
ity benefit for all three million recipients.
The Senate measure would restore the minimum benefit
for current recipients except for those whose income from
federal, state or local government pension exceeds $300 a
month.
AWACS jets patrol over Egypt
Cairo — Two U.S. Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) jets arrived yesterday from their base in Oklahoma
to provide Egypt's new president, Hosni Mubarak, with a
concrete symbol of U.S. support for his government.
The planes arrived as Mubarak announced his 31-member
Cabinet, which was virtually the same as that of his slain

predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
Attention in Egypt focused on the arrival of the U.S. radar
planes. Announcement ir\ Washington that the AWACS
would be immediately deployed here was greeted with satis
faction by the Egyptian government, which said the real rea
son for the planes' arrival was to patrol its tense western
border with Libya.
When the planes had been expected to land, the word
circulated that the AWACS had entered Egyptian air space
and would soon be at Cairo West. However, apparently on
orders from the U.S. military, they were diverted to another
"undisclosed" Egyptian airfield.
However, General Nasser announced a "change pf plans"
— the AWACS on entering Egyptian air space had im
mediately gone on patrol and would not be landing until
midnight.
Nasser said the decision was "political" but he did not
know whether it had been taken by the Egyptian or U.S. gov
ernment.
A U.S Embassy spokesmen, queried about Nasser's asser
tion that both AWACS had been put on immediate duty
without even landing and with their'trews unrested, in
dicated that the AWACS had not actually begun flying mis
sions yet.
While here to attend Sadat's funeral, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig met with Mubarak, Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali and the defense minister, Gen. Abdel Halim Abu
Ghazala, to promise continued U.S. support.
Haig announced the expansion of previously planned
joint military maneuvers in Egypt's western desert andagree
ment to step up deliveries of military hardware. He also
hinted at new commitments of support, both military and ec
onomic, for Sudan.
Reagan seeks to restrict FOIA
Washington — The Reagan administration downgraded
the Freedom of Information Act yesterday as "a highly over
rated instrument" for disclosing official misdeeds and urged
Congress to adopt a wide-ranging set of restrictions on it for
the sake of "effective government."
Testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, Asst.
Attornev General lonathan Rose offered a new set of restric
tions and other changes that he said would make it far less
expensive and burdensome to administer.
The proposed amendments would accord far more secre
cy to law enforcement records, business data, and ail types of
records "concerning individuals" than they have under
present law.
The administration bill would also change the definition of
government records within the reach of the law so that it
would no longer be able to touch "diaries, journals, tele
phone logs, desk calendars, or personal or research notes"
that government officials often keep.
Another provision in the bill would whittle down the au
thority that federal courts have under current law to de
termine whether national security information was properly
classified.
Under the bill Rose presented, which has been entitled
"The Freedom of Information Improvements Act," the
courts could order the release of classified documents only
on a finding that the government's decision to keep them se
cret was "arbitrary and capricious."
The Justice Department argued that this would constitute
little change from present practice anyway, since the courts
are already obliged to give "substantial weight" to the "ex
pertise" of the government agencies involved.
Bulgarian wins Nobel literature prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Elias Canetti, a shy and reclusive
Bulgarian-born writer whose works reflect themes of death
and the Nazi regime he fled, won the 1981 Nobel Prize in lit
erature Wednesday.
The 76-year-old author of plays, novels and memoirs writ
ten in German was cited by the Swedish Academy "for writ
ings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic
power."
Canetti has been widely known for five decades iri Europe
an literary circles but his translated works have sold only

about 100,000 copies in the United States since the 19405, ac
cording to his New York publisher, The Crossroad Publishing
Co.
Michael Samuel of the BBC's Bulgarian section said Canet
ti was so shy he refused to be interviewed. He described the
author as "really more of a philosopher than a writer" who
was strongly influenced by Franz Kafka. Samuel said Canetti
was a prolific writer "at one time" but has not written any
thing in recent years.
Canetti, who lives in England and is a naturalized British
subject, has spent time in Switzerland and Austria, where he
learned German.
Gandhi suspicious of no-war pact
New Delhi — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, speaking at a
time of growing concern here among Indians and diplomats
alike that a fourth war between India and Pakistan might be
looming on the horizon, yesterday declared that India will
not provoke a war with its neighbor and rival to the west.
She added, however, that Pakistan's offer of a no-war pact
with India raised suspicions because it was coupled with the
acceptance of sophisticated weapons from the United States.
U.S. Seriate action on part of the U.S. aid package to Pakistan
could come as early as next week.
One senior Western diplomat went so far in a briefing for
American correspondents late last month to predict that
there is a "slightly better than 50-50 chance" of a Indo-Paki
stan war within the next two years that would be instigated
bv India because "Indira Gandhi just cannot tolerate a re
surgent Pakistan which will constitute somewhat of a threat
to India."
Gandhi appeared to be trying to set these fears to rest in an
interview yesterday with three correspondents for American
publications.
Govt, resumes Solidarity negotiations
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government resumed nego
tiations with the Solidarity union movement for the first time
in two months here yesterday, hoping to avert a major con
frontation over the country's food crisis.
The talks opened in an atmosphere of tension, with the
200-member Polish Communist Party Central Committee
scheduled to begin a potentially volatile plenary meeting to
day and continued labor unrest in the country.
In the central Polish city of Piotrkow, Solidarity and pro
government trade unions have set up a joint strike commit
tee in protest over food shortages. It is believed to be the first
such collaboration since Solidarity was founded, and it il
lustrates that anger over the government's handling of the
food situation cuts across political lines.
In a related development, an influential group of Polish in
tellectuals released a statement yesterday saying that the cur
rent government has become "paralyzed," and that a new
coalition government of national compromise should be
formed. Although there were few details, the statement said
that the ministries of defense, foreign affairs and interior
should be reserved for the Polish United Workers (Com
munist) Party.

New York — The stock market staged a modest rally yes

The Dow jones average of 30 industrials, off 14.93 points in
the previous session, rebounded 5.61 to 856.26.
The daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange showed

Senate committee downs AWACS sale
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations committee
voted vesterday in favor of killing an $8.5 billion sale of U.S.
air defense weapons to Saudi Arabia, but the Reagan admin
istration inched ahead in its search for votes for the final
showdown in Congress later this month.
Before the vote, President Ronald Reagan persuaded Sen.
Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) to vote for the sale.
Pressler said the president had satisfied him that he will
shortly send Congress assurances that the security of the so
phisticated weapons technology will be protected.
Pressler, who had been intensely lobbied by the adminis
tration said he went into the committee meeting prepared to
vote against the sale unless satisfactory assurances from the
president were forthcoming.
He said his decision was based not only on assurances the
president gave him by phone but also on Reagan's emphasis
that his personal prestige is "on the line."
Yesterday, the administration won its first test vote in the
AWACS debate. The Senate Armed Services Committee re
leased a report, concluding that the proposed sale was in the
United States' national security interest.
Reagan refuses to boost foreign aid
1 Philadelphia — President Ronald Reagan assailed the Sovi
et Union yesterday as having nothing to offer the global
poor, while he rejected the claims of "some shrill voices"
that he is tightfisted with America's helping hand.
Reagan offered no promise of boosted foreign aid in the
vears to come — though he noted the United States already
gives more than any other nation.
Instead, he said a greater contribution "is to follow
through with our own economic recovery" coupled with
greater private investment in foreign trade.
"By getting our own economic house in order, we win,
they win, we all win," the president said, referring to the in
dustrial democracies on one hand and the poorest nations
on the other.
The speech, before the World Affairs Council, affirmed
Reagan's thoughts on international economics.
Demos seek to restore Social Security
Washington — Democrats pressed for a multibillion
doliar tax increase upon the oil industry as the Senate de
bated yesterday legislation to restore the $122 minimum So
cial Security benefit for more than 2.5 million recipients.
Republican aides expressed confidence that a combina
tion of GOP senators and severai Democrats would defeat
the move by Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) to repeal a por
tion of the "windfall profits" tax reduction Congress gave
the oil industry earlier this year. The reduction of the tax on
"newly discovered" oil was part of a bill to cut personal in
come taxes over three years.
Eagleton said his proposal would raise about $14.2 billion
through 1990. The money would be earmarked for a new So
cial Security Reserve Trust Fund.
Republicans said the tax break granted earlier this year is
an incentive to explore for more domestic oil and help the
country lessen its dependence on imports.
But with the defeat of the amendment, the Senate was ex
pected to vote final approval for restoration of the Social Se
curity minimum benefit. Reagan is expected to sign the bill.
The House has voted to restore the minimum Social Secur
ity benefit for all three million recipients.
The Senate measure would restore the minimum benefit
for current recipients except for those whose income from
federal, state or local government pension exceeds $300 a
month.
AWACS jets patrol over Egypt
Cairo — Two U.S. Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) jets arrived yesterday from their base in Oklahoma
to provide Egypt's new president, Hosni Mubarak, with a
concrete symbol of U.S. support for his government.
The planes arrived as Mubarak announced his 31-member
Cabinet, which was virtually the same as that of his slain

predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
Attention in Egypt focused on the arrival of the U.S. radar
planes. Announcement ir\ Washington that the AWACS
would be immediately deployed here was greeted with satis
faction by the Egyptian government, which said the real rea
son for the planes' arrival was to patrol its tense western
border with Libya.
When the planes had been expected to land, the word
circulated that the AWACS had entered Egyptian air space
and would soon be at Cairo West. However, apparently on
orders from the U.S. military, they were diverted to another
"undisclosed" Egyptian airfield.
However, General Nasser announced a "change pf plans"
— the AWACS on entering Egyptian air space had im
mediately gone on patrol and would not be landing until
midnight.
Nasser said the decision was "political" but he did not
know whether it had been taken by the Egyptian or U.S. gov
ernment.
A U.S Embassy spokesmen, queried about Nasser's asser
tion that both AWACS had been put on immediate duty
without even landing and with their'trews unrested, in
dicated that the AWACS had not actually begun flying mis
sions yet.
While here to attend Sadat's funeral, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig met with Mubarak, Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali and the defense minister, Gen. Abdel Halim Abu
Ghazala, to promise continued U.S. support.
Haig announced the expansion of previously planned
joint military maneuvers in Egypt's western desert andagree
ment to step up deliveries of military hardware. He also
hinted at new commitments of support, both military and ec
onomic, for Sudan.
Reagan seeks to restrict FOIA
Washington — The Reagan administration downgraded
the Freedom of Information Act yesterday as "a highly over
rated instrument" for disclosing official misdeeds and urged
Congress to adopt a wide-ranging set of restrictions on it for
the sake of "effective government."
Testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, Asst.
Attornev General lonathan Rose offered a new set of restric
tions and other changes that he said would make it far less
expensive and burdensome to administer.
The proposed amendments would accord far more secre
cy to law enforcement records, business data, and ail types of
records "concerning individuals" than they have under
present law.
The administration bill would also change the definition of
government records within the reach of the law so that it
would no longer be able to touch "diaries, journals, tele
phone logs, desk calendars, or personal or research notes"
that government officials often keep.
Another provision in the bill would whittle down the au
thority that federal courts have under current law to de
termine whether national security information was properly
classified.
Under the bill Rose presented, which has been entitled
"The Freedom of Information Improvements Act," the
courts could order the release of classified documents only
on a finding that the government's decision to keep them se
cret was "arbitrary and capricious."
The Justice Department argued that this would constitute
little change from present practice anyway, since the courts
are already obliged to give "substantial weight" to the "ex
pertise" of the government agencies involved.
Bulgarian wins Nobel literature prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Elias Canetti, a shy and reclusive
Bulgarian-born writer whose works reflect themes of death
and the Nazi regime he fled, won the 1981 Nobel Prize in lit
erature Wednesday.
The 76-year-old author of plays, novels and memoirs writ
ten in German was cited by the Swedish Academy "for writ
ings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic
power."
Canetti has been widely known for five decades iri Europe
an literary circles but his translated works have sold only

about 100,000 copies in the United States since the 19405, ac
cording to his New York publisher, The Crossroad Publishing
Co.
Michael Samuel of the BBC's Bulgarian section said Canet
ti was so shy he refused to be interviewed. He described the
author as "really more of a philosopher than a writer" who
was strongly influenced by Franz Kafka. Samuel said Canetti
was a prolific writer "at one time" but has not written any
thing in recent years.
Canetti, who lives in England and is a naturalized British
subject, has spent time in Switzerland and Austria, where he
learned German.
Gandhi suspicious of no-war pact
New Delhi — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, speaking at a
time of growing concern here among Indians and diplomats
alike that a fourth war between India and Pakistan might be
looming on the horizon, yesterday declared that India will
not provoke a war with its neighbor and rival to the west.
She added, however, that Pakistan's offer of a no-war pact
with India raised suspicions because it was coupled with the
acceptance of sophisticated weapons from the United States.
U.S. Seriate action on part of the U.S. aid package to Pakistan
could come as early as next week.
One senior Western diplomat went so far in a briefing for
American correspondents late last month to predict that
there is a "slightly better than 50-50 chance" of a Indo-Paki
stan war within the next two years that would be instigated
bv India because "Indira Gandhi just cannot tolerate a re
surgent Pakistan which will constitute somewhat of a threat
to India."
Gandhi appeared to be trying to set these fears to rest in an
interview yesterday with three correspondents for American
publications.
Govt, resumes Solidarity negotiations
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government resumed nego
tiations with the Solidarity union movement for the first time
in two months here yesterday, hoping to avert a major con
frontation over the country's food crisis.
The talks opened in an atmosphere of tension, with the
200-member Polish Communist Party Central Committee
scheduled to begin a potentially volatile plenary meeting to
day and continued labor unrest in the country.
In the central Polish city of Piotrkow, Solidarity and pro
government trade unions have set up a joint strike commit
tee in protest over food shortages. It is believed to be the first
such collaboration since Solidarity was founded, and it il
lustrates that anger over the government's handling of the
food situation cuts across political lines.
In a related development, an influential group of Polish in
tellectuals released a statement yesterday saying that the cur
rent government has become "paralyzed," and that a new
coalition government of national compromise should be
formed. Although there were few details, the statement said
that the ministries of defense, foreign affairs and interior
should be reserved for the Polish United Workers (Com
munist) Party.

New York — The stock market staged a modest rally yes

The Dow jones average of 30 industrials, off 14.93 points in

Senate committee downs AWACS sale
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations committee
voted vesterday in favor of killing an $8.5 billion sale of U.S.
air defense weapons to Saudi Arabia, but the Reagan admin
istration inched ahead in its search for votes for the final
showdown in Congress later this month.
Before the vote, President Ronald Reagan persuaded Sen.
Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) to vote for the sale.
Pressler said the president had satisfied him that he will
shortly send Congress assurances that the security of the so
phisticated weapons technology will be protected.
Pressler, who had been intensely lobbied by the adminis
tration said he went into the committee meeting prepared to
vote against the sale unless satisfactory assurances from the
president were forthcoming.
He said his decision was based not only on assurances the
president gave him by phone but also on Reagan's emphasis
that his personal prestige is "on the line."
Yesterday, the administration won its first test vote in the
AWACS debate. The Senate Armed Services Committee re
leased a report, concluding that the proposed sale was in the
United States' national security interest.
Reagan refuses to boost foreign aid
1 Philadelphia — President Ronald Reagan assailed the Sovi
et Union yesterday as having nothing to offer the global
poor, while he rejected the claims of "some shrill voices"
that he is tightfisted with America's helping hand.
Reagan offered no promise of boosted foreign aid in the
vears to come — though he noted the United States already
gives more than any other nation.
Instead, he said a greater contribution "is to follow
through with our own economic recovery" coupled with
greater private investment in foreign trade.
"By getting our own economic house in order, we win,
they win, we all win," the president said, referring to the in
dustrial democracies on one hand and the poorest nations
on the other.
The speech, before the World Affairs Council, affirmed
Reagan's thoughts on international economics.
Demos seek to restore Social Security
Washington — Democrats pressed for a multibillion
doliar tax increase upon the oil industry as the Senate de
bated yesterday legislation to restore the $122 minimum So
cial Security benefit for more than 2.5 million recipients.
Republican aides expressed confidence that a combina
tion of GOP senators and severai Democrats would defeat
the move by Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) to repeal a por
tion of the "windfall profits" tax reduction Congress gave
the oil industry earlier this year. The reduction of the tax on
"newly discovered" oil was part of a bill to cut personal in
come taxes over three years.
Eagleton said his proposal would raise about $14.2 billion
through 1990. The money would be earmarked for a new So
cial Security Reserve Trust Fund.
Republicans said the tax break granted earlier this year is
an incentive to explore for more domestic oil and help the
country lessen its dependence on imports.
But with the defeat of the amendment, the Senate was ex
pected to vote final approval for restoration of the Social Se
curity minimum benefit. Reagan is expected to sign the bill.
The House has voted to restore the minimum Social Secur
ity benefit for all three million recipients.
The Senate measure would restore the minimum benefit
for current recipients except for those whose income from
federal, state or local government pension exceeds $300 a
month.
AWACS jets patrol over Egypt
Cairo — Two U.S. Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) jets arrived yesterday from their base in Oklahoma
to provide Egypt's new president, Hosni Mubarak, with a
concrete symbol of U.S. support for his government.
The planes arrived as Mubarak announced his 31-member
Cabinet, which was virtually the same as that of his slain

predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
Attention in Egypt focused on the arrival of the U.S. radar
planes. Announcement ir\ Washington that the AWACS
would be immediately deployed here was greeted with satis
faction by the Egyptian government, which said the real rea
son for the planes' arrival was to patrol its tense western
border with Libya.
When the planes had been expected to land, the word
circulated that the AWACS had entered Egyptian air space
and would soon be at Cairo West. However, apparently on
orders from the U.S. military, they were diverted to another
"undisclosed" Egyptian airfield.
However, General Nasser announced a "change pf plans"
— the AWACS on entering Egyptian air space had im
mediately gone on patrol and would not be landing until
midnight.
Nasser said the decision was "political" but he did not
know whether it had been taken by the Egyptian or U.S. gov
ernment.
A U.S Embassy spokesmen, queried about Nasser's asser
tion that both AWACS had been put on immediate duty
without even landing and with their'trews unrested, in
dicated that the AWACS had not actually begun flying mis
sions yet.
While here to attend Sadat's funeral, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig met with Mubarak, Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali and the defense minister, Gen. Abdel Halim Abu
Ghazala, to promise continued U.S. support.
Haig announced the expansion of previously planned
joint military maneuvers in Egypt's western desert andagree
ment to step up deliveries of military hardware. He also
hinted at new commitments of support, both military and ec
onomic, for Sudan.
Reagan seeks to restrict FOIA
Washington — The Reagan administration downgraded
the Freedom of Information Act yesterday as "a highly over
rated instrument" for disclosing official misdeeds and urged
Congress to adopt a wide-ranging set of restrictions on it for
the sake of "effective government."
Testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, Asst.
Attornev General lonathan Rose offered a new set of restric
tions and other changes that he said would make it far less
expensive and burdensome to administer.
The proposed amendments would accord far more secre
cy to law enforcement records, business data, and ail types of
records "concerning individuals" than they have under
present law.
The administration bill would also change the definition of
government records within the reach of the law so that it
would no longer be able to touch "diaries, journals, tele
phone logs, desk calendars, or personal or research notes"
that government officials often keep.
Another provision in the bill would whittle down the au
thority that federal courts have under current law to de
termine whether national security information was properly
classified.
Under the bill Rose presented, which has been entitled
"The Freedom of Information Improvements Act," the
courts could order the release of classified documents only
on a finding that the government's decision to keep them se
cret was "arbitrary and capricious."
The Justice Department argued that this would constitute
little change from present practice anyway, since the courts
are already obliged to give "substantial weight" to the "ex
pertise" of the government agencies involved.
Bulgarian wins Nobel literature prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Elias Canetti, a shy and reclusive
Bulgarian-born writer whose works reflect themes of death
and the Nazi regime he fled, won the 1981 Nobel Prize in lit
erature Wednesday.
The 76-year-old author of plays, novels and memoirs writ
ten in German was cited by the Swedish Academy "for writ
ings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic
power."
Canetti has been widely known for five decades iri Europe
an literary circles but his translated works have sold only

about 100,000 copies in the United States since the 19405, ac
cording to his New York publisher, The Crossroad Publishing
Co.
Michael Samuel of the BBC's Bulgarian section said Canet
ti was so shy he refused to be interviewed. He described the
author as "really more of a philosopher than a writer" who
was strongly influenced by Franz Kafka. Samuel said Canetti
was a prolific writer "at one time" but has not written any
thing in recent years.
Canetti, who lives in England and is a naturalized British
subject, has spent time in Switzerland and Austria, where he
learned German.
Gandhi suspicious of no-war pact
New Delhi — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, speaking at a
time of growing concern here among Indians and diplomats
alike that a fourth war between India and Pakistan might be
looming on the horizon, yesterday declared that India will
not provoke a war with its neighbor and rival to the west.
She added, however, that Pakistan's offer of a no-war pact
with India raised suspicions because it was coupled with the
acceptance of sophisticated weapons from the United States.
U.S. Seriate action on part of the U.S. aid package to Pakistan
could come as early as next week.
One senior Western diplomat went so far in a briefing for
American correspondents late last month to predict that
there is a "slightly better than 50-50 chance" of a Indo-Paki
stan war within the next two years that would be instigated
bv India because "Indira Gandhi just cannot tolerate a re
surgent Pakistan which will constitute somewhat of a threat
to India."
Gandhi appeared to be trying to set these fears to rest in an
interview yesterday with three correspondents for American
publications.
Govt, resumes Solidarity negotiations
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government resumed nego
tiations with the Solidarity union movement for the first time
in two months here yesterday, hoping to avert a major con
frontation over the country's food crisis.
The talks opened in an atmosphere of tension, with the
200-member Polish Communist Party Central Committee
scheduled to begin a potentially volatile plenary meeting to
day and continued labor unrest in the country.
In the central Polish city of Piotrkow, Solidarity and pro
government trade unions have set up a joint strike commit
tee in protest over food shortages. It is believed to be the first
such collaboration since Solidarity was founded, and it il
lustrates that anger over the government's handling of the
food situation cuts across political lines.
In a related development, an influential group of Polish in
tellectuals released a statement yesterday saying that the cur
rent government has become "paralyzed," and that a new
coalition government of national compromise should be
formed. Although there were few details, the statement said
that the ministries of defense, foreign affairs and interior
should be reserved for the Polish United Workers (Com
munist) Party.
