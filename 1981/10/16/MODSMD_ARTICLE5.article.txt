# Statistics reveal decrease in summer crimes
## 
### Hillary Earnest 
Contrary to rumors of a massive
crime wave which supposedly swept
the Stanford campus this summer,
the crime rate here during June, July
and August was much lowerthan that
of the summer of 1980, according to
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
Niemeyer quoted figures which
showed decreases in reported bur
glary, grand theft, petty theft, bicycle
theft, theft of motor vehicles and
possession of stolen property from
the summer of 1980 to this past sum
mer. "I keep hearing rumors of a
massive crime wave this summer,"
Niemeyer said, "but the figures
we've got just don't support that
rumor.
"I think our efforts are finally
paying off," Niemeyer said. He cited
increased student awareness of
crime prevention methods as the
main determinant in the lower crime
rate. Niemeyer said he was pleased
with the success of the OUTREACH
program, whose participants dis
tribute maps and pamphlets regard
ing crime prevention to students in
campus residences.
He noted, however, that jhere was
an increase in cases of reported van
dalism, citing 27 instances this past
summer and 23 cases during the sum
mer of 1980.
Three cases of possible theft from

row and fraternity houses during the
summer are currently being in
vestigated by University officials, ac
cording to Asst. Row Director
Michael Jackson. Kitchenequipment
was found missing from a self-op and
from a co-op on the row.
Officials are also investigating a
possible theft from a storage room at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity house.
Several thousand dollars worth of
personal belongings were reported
missing from a deadbolted storage
room when students returned to the
house in mid-September. According
to Geoff Miller, president of the
house, a window to the storage room
was found open.
Stereo components, skis, golf
clubs, three bicycles, a refrigerator
and a box of personal effects are in
cluded on a list sent by Miller to ttte
row office. The University can be
held liable for those items only if neg
ligence on its part can be proven.
"I'm not accusing anyone," Miller
said. "I really don't know whose fault
this is, but I thought it should be
brought to their (row office officials')
attention. Maybe something can be
done in the future to prevent this
from happening."
Heloisa Edwards, row facilities
manager, said windows at the KA
house not boarded up probably
should have been.
"My only complaint is that the
houses are too accessible during the

summer," Miller said. "There is not
enough attention paid to the
workmen who go in and out and
leave the windows and doors opens
while they're inside."
Edwards said that the workmen
have instructions to lock the houses
behind them, but that this did not
always happen. She that many of
the summer employees are students
who are used to the houses being un
locked and are not conscious of safe
ty.
According to KA member Jeff
Holland, the caretaker assigned to
the cluster of houses which Includes
the KA house told the row office
about lax security measures taken by
the workmen.
Although the report from KA is the
only report of a theft from a storage
room during the summer, many stu
dents who did not lock up their
belongings in a Universlty-desig
nated storage room returned to find
them gone this fall.
Jackson explained that in strict
terms, the University, as landlord of
the houses, has the right to remove
anything left in the houses and not in
a designated storage room at the end
of the year.
"Our mindset was not to punish
the students but rather to prepare
the houses for new students moving
in," Jackson said. In an effort to
clean, repair and standardize the

rooms, many items left in the rooms
were removed.
"We had no set policy on what we
trashed and what we kept," Edwards
said. She explained that she and her
staff made case-by-case judgments
whether to remove something from a
room.
She said items in good condition or
tagged by a student were generally
not removed, although some were
moved to different parts of the
house. Many items left by the student
and in poor condition were assumed
to be abandoned and were removed,
said Edwards.
"It was my observation that the stu
dents didn't care about the stuff that
was left," Edwards said. She added
that most of the items found in the
rooms were recycled or given to
charity, and said there was "an in
credible amount" left in the houses.

ßEACH might also better encourage
students to be more safety conscious
when storing their belongings for the
summer months.
"Students are starting to use more
preventative methods," Niemeyer
said. "It's important that they don't
make things available for thieves.
Make it as difficult as you can for
them to take something of yours,"he
said.

cluded on a list sent by Miller to ttte
row office. The University can be
held liable for those items only if neg
ligence on its part can be proven.
"I'm not accusing anyone," Miller
said. "I really don't know whose fault
this is, but I thought it should be
brought to their (row office officials')
attention. Maybe something can be
done in the future to prevent this
from happening."
Heloisa Edwards, row facilities
manager, said windows at the KA
house not boarded up probably
should have been.
"My only complaint is that the
houses are too accessible during the

summer," Miller said. "There is not
enough attention paid to the
workmen who go in and out and
leave the windows and doors opens
while they're inside."
Edwards said that the workmen
have instructions to lock the houses
behind them, but that this did not
always happen. She that many of
the summer employees are students
who are used to the houses being un
locked and are not conscious of safe
ty.
According to KA member Jeff
Holland, the caretaker assigned to
the cluster of houses which Includes
the KA house told the row office
about lax security measures taken by
the workmen.
Although the report from KA is the
only report of a theft from a storage
room during the summer, many stu
dents who did not lock up their
belongings in a Universlty-desig
nated storage room returned to find
them gone this fall.
Jackson explained that in strict
terms, the University, as landlord of
the houses, has the right to remove
anything left in the houses and not in
a designated storage room at the end
of the year.
"Our mindset was not to punish
the students but rather to prepare
the houses for new students moving
in," Jackson said. In an effort to
clean, repair and standardize the

rooms, many items left in the rooms
were removed.
"We had no set policy on what we
trashed and what we kept," Edwards
said. She explained that she and her
staff made case-by-case judgments
whether to remove something from a
room.
She said items in good condition or
tagged by a student were generally
not removed, although some were
moved to different parts of the
house. Many items left by the student
and in poor condition were assumed
to be abandoned and were removed,
said Edwards.
"It was my observation that the stu
dents didn't care about the stuff that
was left," Edwards said. She added
that most of the items found in the
rooms were recycled or given to
charity, and said there was "an in
credible amount" left in the houses.

when storing their belongings for the

"Students are starting to use more
preventative methods," Niemeyer
said. "It's important that they don't
make things available for thieves.
Make it as difficult as you can for
them to take something of yours,"he

Contrary to rumors of a massive
crime wave which supposedly swept
the Stanford campus this summer,
the crime rate here during June, July
and August was much lowerthan that
of the summer of 1980, according to
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
Niemeyer quoted figures which
showed decreases in reported bur
glary, grand theft, petty theft, bicycle
theft, theft of motor vehicles and
possession of stolen property from
the summer of 1980 to this past sum
mer. "I keep hearing rumors of a
massive crime wave this summer,"
Niemeyer said, "but the figures
we've got just don't support that
rumor.
"I think our efforts are finally
paying off," Niemeyer said. He cited
increased student awareness of
crime prevention methods as the
main determinant in the lower crime
rate. Niemeyer said he was pleased
with the success of the OUTREACH
program, whose participants dis
tribute maps and pamphlets regard
ing crime prevention to students in
campus residences.
He noted, however, that jhere was
an increase in cases of reported van
dalism, citing 27 instances this past
summer and 23 cases during the sum
mer of 1980.
Three cases of possible theft from

row and fraternity houses during the
summer are currently being in
vestigated by University officials, ac
cording to Asst. Row Director
Michael Jackson. Kitchenequipment
was found missing from a self-op and
from a co-op on the row.
Officials are also investigating a
possible theft from a storage room at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity house.
Several thousand dollars worth of
personal belongings were reported
missing from a deadbolted storage
room when students returned to the
house in mid-September. According
to Geoff Miller, president of the
house, a window to the storage room
was found open.
Stereo components, skis, golf
clubs, three bicycles, a refrigerator
and a box of personal effects are in
