## El Salvador suffers from war; economy may soon collapse 
### 
from the Daily wire services
San Salvador, El Salvador —
Two years after dictator Hum
berto Romero was deposed in
a military coup here, El
Salvador is in the grip of re
newed political violence and
facing economic disaster.
That violence has claimed
more than 20,000 lives in the
past two years in the fight be
tween the ruling civilian-mili
tary junta and the combined
opposition Revolutionary
Democratic Front (FDR),
spearheaded by its military
wing, the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front (FMLN).
In that period, opposition
forces have carried out more
than 1700 attacks on industrial
installations, and the ensuing
flight of capital abroad is esti
mated at more than $2 billion.
Meanwhile, as a result of
closures and destruction in in
dustry, more than 20,000 peo
ple have been put out of work,
according to the regime's
statistics. At the same time, El
Salvador's vital exports have
been hard hit by the critical
drop in prices on world com

modity markets. This has led to
a loss of international earnings
which has dried up interna
tional credit for the purchase
of vital raw materials.
Dense population, casualties
The economy of El Salvador,
smallest and most densely pop
ulated of the Central American
states, is predominantly agri
cultural, with 63 percent of to
tal area used for crops and
pasture.
In this state of virtual civil
war, the rural population has
been the hardest hit. The
FMLN guerrillas have launched
two general offensives, each of
which has been contained by
government forces, and fol
lowed up with strenuous mop
ping-up operations.
The war between the regime
and the opposition has spilled
over into the international
scene, with both sides seeking
to win political and diplomatic
support from the maximum
number of foreign states.
France, Mexico recognize re
bels
The stance assumed by
France and Mexico in Septem

ber, when they jointly recog
nized the Revolutionary Dem
ocratic Front and its military
wing as representing the peo
ple of El Salvador, has led to "a
cooling in relations between
the official regime here and
those two states.
Similarly, the regime's at
titude has soured toward
Nicaragua, after it proposed
mediation in El Salvador at the
United Nations on Oct. 7, a
proposal described by Presi
dent Duarte as "interven
tionist."
Moreover, the proposal led
Salvadoran Vice President and
armed forces chief Col. Jaime
Abdul Gutierrez to express the
hope on Oct. 9 of "coordi
nated action" against
Nicaragua by anti-communist
governments in Central Ameri
ca—a possibility that brought
Guatemalan President Romeo
Lucas here three days later for
talks.
Gutierrez has charged that
Nicaragua is being used as a
base for supplying arms to the
Salvadoran underground.
