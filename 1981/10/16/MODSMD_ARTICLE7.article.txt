Athens, Greece â€” A shift in Greece's political
power and a resulting period of instability ap
pear increasingly likely, observers said, as in
tense verbal, and even some physical clashes
have been reported in the campaign leading up
to Sunday's general elections.
Andreas Papandreou's Opposition Pan
hellenic Socialist Movement could become
Greece's leading party for the first time after
being formed six years ago, according to the ob
servers.
But, they added, it was doubtful that the party
could gain an absolute majority in the 300-seat
Parliament.

The ruling New Democratic Party expects to
lose 30 of its 175 seats in Parliament, party in
siders said. That shift in power could mean a pe
riod of instability in Greece, with new elections
within a year, because of the opposite views of
Greece's two major parties and the unlikelihood
of coalition rule.
The campaign that got.under way Sept. 20,
heated up abruptly over the weekend when five
people were seriously wounded in clashes be
tween member of Prime Minister George Rallis'
New Democracy Party and supporters of Papan
dreou's Panhellenic Socialists at Heraklion, on
the souther island of Crete, which is the site of a
large U.S. military base.
