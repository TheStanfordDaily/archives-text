### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — Citing the Palestine Liberation
Organization's status as an observer at the
United Nations, Foreign Minister Sunao
Sonoda said yesterday that Japan would
consider its future handling of the PLO's
status "in that direction."
Sonoda made the statement in Par
liament hours after PLO leader Yasser
Arafat left Japan to continue a five-nation
tour.
The foreign minister said, however, that
meetings between Arafat and himself and
between the PLO leader and Prime Min
ister Zenko Suzuki Wednesday produced
no change in Japan's policy "at this mo
ment." After the meetings — the first
Arafat has held with leaders of a U.S. ally —
Japanese spokesmen said only that there
was no change in Japan's policy toward the
PLO.
Pressed by a Socialist legislator to recog
nize the PLO as the "sole, legitimate repre

sentative of the Palestinian people,"
Sonoda replied:
"Arafat pointed out (to me) that the PLO
is an observer at the United Nations and is
recognized as a member of the Arab Sum
mit Conference. While noting the position
(of the PLO) among the Palestinian people,
Japan will handle it (the PLO's status) in
that direction."
Minister says no changes
Sonoda's statement, which created an
instant controversy, prompted Vice For
eign Minister Ryozo Sunobe to tell re
porters afterwards that there was still no
change in japan's policy of regarding the
PLO as an "important" — but not the sole
— representative of the Palestinian peo
ple.
In Parliament, Sonoda also said Japan
was not prepared to call the PLO the
"sole" representative of the Palestinians
but he added that "the distinction be
tween saying that the PLO was 'an impor

tant representative' and saying that it was
'the sole legitimate representative' is not
very great."
"It's up to them (the PLO) as to whether
they can consolidate their power" among
the Palestinian people, he added.
No diplomatic rights
As far as official diplomatic recognition
is concerned, however, Sonoda flatly ruled
out giving the PLO office in Tokyo any dip
lomatic privileges.
Arafat, departing on a chartered jet foi
Hanoi, Vietnam, received the same kind ol
security protection that marked his arrival
here Monday.
At Haneda Airport alone, police
mobilized 6,000 security forces.
After visiting Vietnam, he was to travel tc
Moscow. Before arriving here, Arafat mei
with leaders in China and North Korea.
