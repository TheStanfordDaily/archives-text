# Trustees OK faculty housing aid
## 
### Heather Millar 
The board of trustees has approved
a $2 million faculty housing allow
. ance program which will be funded
primarily by the sale of the Peter
* Coutts Condominiums on the south
end of campus.
■ v"It represents a huge commit
ment," said Robin Hamill, director of
Housing Programs. "The trustees
have realized that housing is the key
to Stanford's survival as one of the
top institutions in thecountry." Ham
ill said she hopes the program will be
in operation by Jan. 1,1982.
Hamill said each year the Univer
sity must recruit approximately 90
professors to replace those who
leave. She said that while the number
of scholars actually recruited has not
declined in recent years, "we get
turned down more often than we
used to." She said that last year the
University failed to attract two "very
prominent" scholars to the School of
Humanities and Sciences because of
the high cost of housing.
The new program, according to
Hamill, is intended to make housing
in the University area affordable to
new professors. It will supplement
the salaries of new faculty who de
cide to buy a house during their first
three years here, she said.
The program, while primarily for
new professors, will also "grand
father" those who joined the faculty
after August 31, 1979, according to
Hamill. She said approximately 150
faculty members and their families
will benefit from the program.
The allowance they will receive is
not a loan, but extra salary, which is
added to the professor's paycheck
for seven years after he buys a house,
said Hamill. Each year the allowance
decreases by one-seventh. Hamill
three major committees make rec
ommendations to the board which
are almost always followed.
Members meet eight times per
year, and for each meeting they are
provided with a hefty agenda which
generally fills at least 70 pages,
crammed full of budgets and build
ing plans, faculty appointments and
stock portfolio reports and whatever
else the University's administration
compiles for their review.
Reports on academic programs
like the Western Culture Require
ment or yearly run-throughs of the
work of Hoover Institution round out
the meetings.
The board has ample time for re
view of the agenda before they at
tend the meetings — often they will
question certain items or bring up
problems with certain provisions, ex
plained Kimball.
"One thing the board will not to
lerate is having anything shoved
down its throat. If they bring us
something at the last minute that we

haven't prepared for, we'll just say
'I'm sorry, we'll discuss that at the
next meeting," he said. Fortunately,
according to Kimball, this is a rare oc
currence, but in the past certain
"walk-on" items — reports on Uni
versity personnel, discussion of legal
actions against the University (like
the suit in which Stanford is named as
a co-defendant along with Surgeon
Zoltan Lucas who recently went on a
leave of absence after being accused
of research fraud by another doctor)
— have come before the board with
little or no opportunity for scrutiny
or reports to the press or community.
Tomorrow we'll focus on the
membership of the board, high
lighting the incredible diversity and
expertise present there. Future re
ports will deal with the "changing of
the guard", as we move from the
Richard Lyman/Peter Bing team to
Donald Kennedy and William Kim
ball in the 80's; student members of
the board's committees; current is
sues troubling certain members of
the board; profiles of the University

administrators who work closel>' with
the board arid a look at the changing
structure and relationship of the
board of trustees to the adminis
tration, with a new emphasis on fun
draising and development.
A former member noted that one
feature of the group which dist
inguishes it from most corporate
boards is that "we tend to operate by
consensus — and at times that move
ment appears to be barely faster than
glacial."
We think there are a lot more dist
inguishing factors — like dedication,
common goals, and the "privilege"
many trustees say they feel in being
associated with a lasting quality in
stitution.
