# Trustees OK faculty housing aid
## 
### Heather Millar 
The board of trustees has approved
a $2 million faculty housing allow
. ance program which will be funded
primarily by the sale of the Peter
* Coutts Condominiums on the south
end of campus.
â–  v"It represents a huge commit
ment," said Robin Hamill, director of
Housing Programs. "The trustees
have realized that housing is the key
to Stanford's survival as one of the
top institutions in thecountry." Ham
ill said she hopes the program will be
in operation by Jan. 1,1982.
Hamill said each year the Univer
sity must recruit approximately 90
professors to replace those who
leave. She said that while the number
of scholars actually recruited has not
declined in recent years, "we get
turned down more often than we
used to." She said that last year the
University failed to attract two "very
prominent" scholars to the School of
Humanities and Sciences because of
the high cost of housing.
The new program, according to
Hamill, is intended to make housing
in the University area affordable to
new professors. It will supplement
the salaries of new faculty who de
cide to buy a house during their first
three years here, she said.
The program, while primarily for
new professors, will also "grand
father" those who joined the faculty
after August 31, 1979, according to
Hamill. She said approximately 150
faculty members and their families
will benefit from the program.
The allowance they will receive is
not a loan, but extra salary, which is
added to the professor's paycheck
for seven years after he buys a house,
said Hamill. Each year the allowance
decreases by one-seventh. Hamill
