# Sudan gaining US attention; Libyan proximity brings arms
## 
### Washington Post 
Khartoum, Sudan — In the 10
days since the assassination of
Egyption President Anwar
Sadat, Sudan has become the
newest area of East-West con
frontation in Africa. The Unit
ed States has warned Libya and
the Soviet Union that they risk
retaliation if they meddle in the
affairs of Egypt's southern
neighbor.
Sudanese Minister of Secur
ity arid Vice President Omer
Mohammed Tayeb said Satur
day that Libya had started con
centrating troops on its border
with Sudan two weeks ago,
preparing to overthrow Presi
dent Caafar Mohamed
Nimeiri's government.
The United States has rushed
to Nimeiri's defense, saying it
would speed up delivery of
$100 million in arms aid in re
sponse to Libyan air attacks on
border areas that started last
month. U.S. military exercises
are planned in Sudan for the
first time next month.
Economic problems
Ironically, some Western
diplomats feel that one of the
major dangers to the rule of
Nimeiri comes front the Rea
gan administration's own poli
cy of pushing for tougher terms
from the International Mone
tary Fund in bailing out Third
World economies. The IMF is
believed to be seeking an aus
terity ptogram here that could
produce explosive public dis
content.
The Sudan's chronic troubles
were given little notice by out
siders until the assassination of
Sadat, Nimeiri's closest ally.
Now Nimeiri is doing his ut
most to shore up his military
and get public expression of
U.S. suppoit against Libya.
"People said the Libyans
would never go to Chad," said
Tayeb, referring to the more
than 5,000 Libyans troops now
in that neighboring country as
the result of a civil war. "But
they did. The leaders of Africa
were sleeping."
Such mundane concerns
have not marked the flurry of
statements that have come
from Washington and Cairo
since Sadat's death introduced
a new element of uncertainty

in the Middle East. In a series of
saber-rattling interviews in
Cairo, Nimeiri raised the
specter of a direct invasion by
Libya, which he called a "cat's
paw" of the Soviet Union, and
threatened a "preventive war"
against Libya.
U.S. warning to Khadafy
The tone of American re
marks suggested that the Unit
ed States was drawing a line in
the desert sands of Sudan,
Africa's largest country, and
telling Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafy and his Soviet
backers that they had better
not cross it.
"Nimeiri is not shy about
standing up to Khadafy," a
Western diplomat said. "That is
an important reason why he's
getting support from the U.S.
He's willing to stand up and be
counted."
"Of course, Nimeiri is exag
gerating," another diplomat
said, adding that there was
"certainly not" any chance of a
large-scale Libyan invasion
across the Chadian frontier.
About 5,000 of Khadafy's
troops have been based in
Chad since they helped to end
a civil war in that neighboring
Central African nation last
year.
Sudan, on the edge of Arab
and black Africa, accuses
Khadafy of financing a secret
underground army and train
ing Sudanese dissidents in Lib
ya to overthrow Nimeiri. Last
month more than 10,000 per
sons were arrested after an
abortive coup attempt with al
leged Libyan involvement.
Most analysts think that
Nimeiri has strong backing
within the military, which
should be aided by the arrival
of modern American equip
ment soon. They also feel that a
popular uprising against
Nimeiri is unlikely to succeed
unless he fails to get control of
the economy.
Large foreign debt
One ambassador said the
state of the economy is the
main threat to the president.
The government's foreign debt
totals $3 billion, and a team
from the International Mone
tary Fund arrived this week to
hold talks on Sudan's request

for $250 million in support
funds urgently needed to cov
er balance-of-payments prob
lems.
Imports are outrunning ex
ports by about $1 billion a year
and about 85 percent of the
revenue from sales abroad
must be used for fuel. Inflation
is estimated at 50 percent, and
there is an exodus of un
employed youth from the vast
country almost a third the size
of the United States.
Some diplomats believe
Nimeiri's war-scare campaign
is aimed partly at influencing
the Reagan administration into
making Sudan an exception to
the IMF strictures.
In words ringing of Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Nimeiri said last week: "It is not
impossible to find me staging
an operation inside Tripoli, be
cause I want and love martyr
dom. We do not shy away from
death, but we search for it."
Most Sudanese have lost
count of the numerous coup
attempts, many minor, some
serious, against Nimeiri since
he seized power in a military
uprising in 1969. A conservative
estimate would be 15.
Egypt has pledged to come
to Nimeiri's aid in the event of a
Libyan invasion.
U.S. military package
The bulk of the U.S. military
aid package, which should be
gin arriving in two months un
der the speeded-up schedule,
will be air-defense equipment,
American sources said. About
two dozen American military
technicians will be sent to
Sudan on temporary duty to
train Sudanese to operate the
equipment.
Sudan is also supposed to get
"two or three" F-5 fighters and
some M-60 tanks, although
$100 million will not stretch far.
It is understood that this is
just the beginning of a long
term U.S. plan to upgrade
Sudan's military. The $100 mil
lion is opposed to Libya's
forces of more than 100 ad
vanced Soviet MiGs and
French Mirages and 2,600 Sovi
et tanks, a Western military at
tache said.

Mohammed Tayeb said Satur
day that Libya had started con
centrating troops on its border
with Sudan two weeks ago,
preparing to overthrow Presi
dent Caafar Mohamed
Nimeiri's government.
The United States has rushed
to Nimeiri's defense, saying it
would speed up delivery of
$100 million in arms aid in re
sponse to Libyan air attacks on
border areas that started last
month. U.S. military exercises
are planned in Sudan for the
first time next month.
Economic problems
Ironically, some Western
diplomats feel that one of the
major dangers to the rule of
Nimeiri comes front the Rea
gan administration's own poli
cy of pushing for tougher terms
from the International Mone
tary Fund in bailing out Third
World economies. The IMF is
believed to be seeking an aus
terity ptogram here that could
produce explosive public dis
content.
The Sudan's chronic troubles
were given little notice by out
siders until the assassination of
Sadat, Nimeiri's closest ally.
Now Nimeiri is doing his ut
most to shore up his military
and get public expression of
U.S. suppoit against Libya.
"People said the Libyans
would never go to Chad," said
Tayeb, referring to the more
than 5,000 Libyans troops now
in that neighboring country as
the result of a civil war. "But
they did. The leaders of Africa
were sleeping."
Such mundane concerns
have not marked the flurry of
statements that have come
from Washington and Cairo
since Sadat's death introduced
a new element of uncertainty

in the Middle East. In a series of
saber-rattling interviews in
Cairo, Nimeiri raised the
specter of a direct invasion by
Libya, which he called a "cat's
paw" of the Soviet Union, and
threatened a "preventive war"
against Libya.
U.S. warning to Khadafy
The tone of American re
marks suggested that the Unit
ed States was drawing a line in
the desert sands of Sudan,
Africa's largest country, and
telling Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafy and his Soviet
backers that they had better
not cross it.
"Nimeiri is not shy about
standing up to Khadafy," a
Western diplomat said. "That is
an important reason why he's
getting support from the U.S.
He's willing to stand up and be
counted."
"Of course, Nimeiri is exag
gerating," another diplomat
said, adding that there was
"certainly not" any chance of a
large-scale Libyan invasion
across the Chadian frontier.
About 5,000 of Khadafy's
troops have been based in
Chad since they helped to end
a civil war in that neighboring
Central African nation last
year.
Sudan, on the edge of Arab
and black Africa, accuses
Khadafy of financing a secret
underground army and train
ing Sudanese dissidents in Lib
ya to overthrow Nimeiri. Last
month more than 10,000 per
sons were arrested after an
abortive coup attempt with al
leged Libyan involvement.
Most analysts think that
Nimeiri has strong backing
within the military, which
should be aided by the arrival
of modern American equip
ment soon. They also feel that a
popular uprising against
Nimeiri is unlikely to succeed
unless he fails to get control of
the economy.
Large foreign debt
One ambassador said the
state of the economy is the
main threat to the president.
The government's foreign debt
totals $3 billion, and a team
from the International Mone
tary Fund arrived this week to
hold talks on Sudan's request

for $250 million in support
funds urgently needed to cov
er balance-of-payments prob
lems.
Imports are outrunning ex
ports by about $1 billion a year
and about 85 percent of the
revenue from sales abroad
must be used for fuel. Inflation
is estimated at 50 percent, and
there is an exodus of un
employed youth from the vast
country almost a third the size
of the United States.
Some diplomats believe
Nimeiri's war-scare campaign
is aimed partly at influencing
the Reagan administration into
making Sudan an exception to
the IMF strictures.
In words ringing of Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Nimeiri said last week: "It is not
impossible to find me staging
an operation inside Tripoli, be
cause I want and love martyr
dom. We do not shy away from
death, but we search for it."
Most Sudanese have lost
count of the numerous coup
attempts, many minor, some
serious, against Nimeiri since
he seized power in a military
uprising in 1969. A conservative
estimate would be 15.
Egypt has pledged to come
to Nimeiri's aid in the event of a
Libyan invasion.
U.S. military package
The bulk of the U.S. military
aid package, which should be
gin arriving in two months un
der the speeded-up schedule,
will be air-defense equipment,
American sources said. About
two dozen American military
technicians will be sent to
Sudan on temporary duty to
train Sudanese to operate the
equipment.
Sudan is also supposed to get
"two or three" F-5 fighters and
some M-60 tanks, although
$100 million will not stretch far.
It is understood that this is
just the beginning of a long
term U.S. plan to upgrade
Sudan's military. The $100 mil
lion is opposed to Libya's
forces of more than 100 ad
vanced Soviet MiGs and
French Mirages and 2,600 Sovi
et tanks, a Western military at
tache said.
Khartoum, Sudan — In the 10
days since the assassination of
Egyption President Anwar
Sadat, Sudan has become the
