Warsaw — 1 he election of
General VVojciech
Jaruzelski, Poland's prime
minister and army chief, to
the key post of Communist
Party leader is viewed here
as a compromise between
warring factions within the
Polish regime.
It is the first time a career
soldier has been appointed
first secretary of the Polish
Communist Party — and a
measure of the party's grow
ing sense of desperation as it
seeks ways of dealing with
the independent Solidarity
trade union. By electing
Jaruzelski to succeed
Stanislaw Kania, the policy
making central committee
appeared to be wanting to
convince the Polish people
of the seriousness of the
crisis and to demonstrate
thut it has the army's back
ing in the event of any major
showdown.
Will lie succeed?
It is an open question,
however, whether the 58-
year-old army general will
be able to succeed where
Kania failed. He faces the
same complex political situ
ation, having to cope simul
taneously with pressure
from Solidarity's increasing
ly militant rank-and-file, a
badly divided Communist
Party, impatient Soviet Bloc

allies and a rapidly de
teriorating economy as win
ter approaches.
What is more, much of
the public confidence he
was able to inspire when he
was appointed prime min
ister in February has worn
off. The glamor of his
bemedalled uniform has
faded as he got bogged
down in administrative de
tail, frequently unable to
impose his will either on the
labyrinthine government
bureaucracy or Solidarity's
mistrustful leaders.
But, while Jaruzelski has
not been able to give the na
tion charismatic leadership,
he has managed to avoid
making enemies. There is
general respect for him in
Poland as a person — and he
enjoys a reputation, rare for
Communist Party leaders, of
upright honesty and integri
ty-
Together with Kania, with
whom he is closely as
sociated, Jaruzelski is identi
fied in the public mind with
the party's "line of agree
ment" — the formula by
which the regime pledged
to resolve Poland's political
and economic problems by
negotiation rather than by
force. He is likely to main
tain this line as long as he is
politically able.
Some analysts, however,

believed that Jaruzelski may
be forced to endorse radical
measures — including the
possible declaration of a
state of emergency — in or
der to placate Moscow and
hardliners at home. They
claimed that the real power
in Poland now rested with
the ideological chief, Stefan
Olszowski, who has been
associated with the party's
conservative wing.
Jaruzelski's high personal
standing was confirmed at
elections to the central
committee during the ex
traordinary Communist
Party congress in August. He
collected 1615 out of a pos
sible 1965 votes — far more
than any prominent party
politician.
The reason for his success
then lay in the fact that, as a
military man, he was not as
sociated with any particular
faction in the party. In yes
terday's election, many
viewed him as the sole can
didate with a chance of unit
ing the different interest
groups in the Polish leader
ship.
Wojciech Jaruzelski was
born on July 6,1923. The re
gion was overrun by the So
viet Union during World
War II and Jaruzelski joined
the pro-Communist Polish
army in exile formed on So
viet territory.
