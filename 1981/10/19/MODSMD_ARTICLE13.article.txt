# Inside the Children's Hospital...

The attractive, one-story building hardly
resembles a hospital. On the inviting wood
entry doors are carved large sturdy trees.
Inside the entrance hall are showcases dis
playing beautiful and varied doll collec
tions, and down another hallway isashow
case of model airplanes.
The smell of cookies permeate the
hallway fromia room where are
busy baking. "These are for'my mom,"
beams one boy proudly. As the project
comes to an end, another girl sighs, "I've
got to get to my homework. I haven't had
time for it yet â€” you'd think they'd give us
a break!"
These sights and sounds, not ordinarily
indicative of a pediatric center, are found
in the Stanford Children's Hospital, lo
cated on Willow Road near the Stanford
Shopping Center.
The hospital is dedicated to the care and
treatment of children suffering from ill
nesses such as cystic fibrosis, cerebral
palsy, and cancer.
It is a tertiary care center equipped to
provide very specialized treatment for
children. .WLtIV.-..catastrophic diseases or
complex disabilities. According to Vicki
Applegate, director of community affairs,
for many of the patients referred by their
physicians or a community hospital, treat
ment at the Stanford Children's Hospital is
the last available alternative.
The hospital has 60 inpatient beds, a
large outpatient department, and various
other support departments.
Approximately 50 percent of the pa
tients are from the San Francisco Bay Area
while the rest are referred from various
parts of the state and country.
The hospital assesses the most current
data from clinical studies conducted in
other parts of the nation in an effort to pro
vide its patients with the best care possible.
Moreover, the hospital has the technolog
ical and specialty services of Stanford Med
ical School at its disposal. It also conducts
its own research and joins other research
projects taking place in renowned hospi
tals nationwide.
According to Applegate, the hospital
combines the best medical care possible
with programs designed to provide sup
port for the child and his or her family. This
aspect of the program is significant since

patients treated at the hospital are general
ly chronically ill.
Applegate commented: "The most as
tounding aspect of the program is the fact
that vJe striVe for non-institutional en
viron rrteht. llVe try to be as family orien
tated as we cant>b,'realizing it is a big part
of the child's treatment and recovery."
The hospital tries to treat its patients in as
short a hospitalization period as possible.
According to Applegate, the goal is to lib
erate the child from the restrictions that
the serious illness imposes on the life of
the child and his family. For those children
who must be hospitalized, the hospital at
tempts to provide a balanced environ
ment. "We try to provide unique, person
alized care," said Applegate.
The child's medical needs are discussed
with a support staff which attempts to meet
the child's personal needs as well. The
medical and support staff coordinate a
program to help the child adapt to hospi
talization.
The hospital's Child Life Program, af
filiated with Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict, offers its patients a chance to attend
school. Organized activities are scheduled
for the children from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. with
programs such as occupational, recrea
tional and musical therapy. These pro
grams help to offset the vigorous medical
attention and therapy the children must
undergo, said Applegate.
In this effort to provide as non-institu
tional an environment as possible, many
physical aspects of the hospital are unique:
doctors and staff do not wear uniforms,
children are encouraged to dress in their
own clothes, and there are no specified vis
iting hours.
Children seem to adapt fairly well to the
environment said Applegate. She believes
that children are pretty resilient. "As long
as they have a sense of support from family
and staff, they seem better able to cope
with the situation than most adults. It is the
family that has a hard time adjusting."
The hospital provides a family counsel
ing program. Social workers and medical
staff meet with the family and child to pro
vide as much information and advice as
possible in an effort to help the family
come to terms with their new situation.
Families are encouraged to spend time
with the child.

The Ronald McDonald House, located
near the hospital, was a gift from approx
imately 130 restaurants in the Bay Area,
and provides a place for families who live
far away to stay while their child receives
treatment. The thirteen room house is also
a place where families can share their ex
periences with other families of chronical
ly ill children.
Gifts and donations are an important
source of income for the hospital. The
complex and specialized nature of treat
ment is expensive and most families can
not afford to pay for it. The hospital de
pends on MediCal and California Chil
dren's Services to provide some reim
bursement and auxiliary groups help raise
money by coordinating fundraising
projects, Applegate said. The hospital is
dependent upon the community to pro
vide the best care possible for patients.
Volunteers, who generally commit three
hours per week, play a large part in the
communities' support of the Children's
Hospital. "Our hospital could not function
successfully without volunteers. They're
like a breath of fresh air for the hospi
talized patients," said Brenda Barnard, as
sistant director of the volunteer program.
The volunteers serve in a variety of areas
from clerical work to dealing with patients
on a one-to-one basis. They also play an ac
tive role in the Child Life program and can
be involved with special projects or enter
tainment events.
Many Stanford students have been in
volved in such volunteer work and special
programs. A few years ago the Stanford
football team paid a visit to the hospital,
and according to Applegate, "The kids just
loved it!"
Orientations are held monthly for pros
pective volunteers. At these meetings,
they learn about the history of the hospital,
the type of patients it treats, and rules and
regulations for volunteers. Interviews are
held to place students in areas of student
preference and hospital needs.
These are only a few of the many aspects
of Children's Hospital aimed toward satis
fying the special needs of seriously ill chil
dren. These programs are derived from the
hospital's dedication to the overall well
being of their patients. "Our goal, said Ap
plegate, "is to make the quality of life as
high as possible."'
