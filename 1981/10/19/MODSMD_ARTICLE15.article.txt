# The 						Comm. Dept. to move to a new home in the Quad
## 
### Polly Grunfeld 
Next year, the Department of Communica
tion will move into a new location in the
Quad. With this new location come new facil
ities, new equipment and a new emphasis for
the Stanford communication department.
Upon the completion of the three year, $12
million construction project targeted for the
fall of 1982, the communication department
will share the "new building 120" with the so
ciology department. The building had been
completely gutted and is in the process of
being rebuilt to meet with seismic require
ments.
Sensitive to the structural integrity of the
historical Quadrangle, the architects
(Esherick, Homsey, Dodge & Davis, and
Stone, Marraccini & Patterson) along with the
Stanford Planning Office are preserving the
old stone exterior of the building.
They are working closely with Dr. Henry
Breitrose, chairman of the communication
department, and Dr. Bernard Cohen of the
sociology department, in designing the build
ing to meet the needs of the departments and
to satisfy safety requirements.
Provisions have been made for an
enormous amount of wiring to accomodate a
vast computer usage. The communication
department will boast two labs complete with

journalism video display terminals, a 50-seat
project room, sound and audio studios, and a
2800-square foot TV studio in the basement
and sub-basement.
This will be a welcome move from their
present quarters — a set of temporary build
ings near Roble tennis courts, originally used
to house the Graduate School of Business
(GSB). Dr. Breitrose is confident that the new
facilities will enhance both the learning and
research opportunities available in the com
munications department.
To complement the new location, approx
imately $550,000, mostly from contributions
and gifts, is budgeted toward the purchase of
new equipment.
The focus of the program is also shifting,
due to industry deregulations and alternative
technologies. The new emphasis will be on
broadcast journalism, rather than com
mercial broadcasting and public TV, and a
new undergraduate communication theory
course is being developed.
Dr. Breitrose hopes to stabilize enrollment
in the department at its present level. He
looks toward the new facilities as a major
force that will enhance the teaching and
learning of communications — an industry
"driven by technology."
