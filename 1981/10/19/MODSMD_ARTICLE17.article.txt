## Editorial No room for searches 
### 
Room searches aren't funny at all. Those of us
who ask for a degree of respect while at Stanford
and who treat the Fundamental Standard as
more than another document to sign before
entering the school should thank those
administrators who cancelled room searches
planned for Row Houses. We should also hope
reasons of principle rather than of pragmatism
prompted the cancellation.
Searches planned for the week of Oct. 5-9
were to be conducted by Heloisa Edwards, row
and cluster facilities manager, to inspect room
conditions and student possession of University
furniture. Edwards told residents the time and
mannerof thesearch — whichfollows
expensive residence renovation — and assured
them, "I will not be looking for 'illicit'
substances or plants. Relax!"
Relax? It is difficult to judge which is more
abhorrent: the invasion of privacy
accompanying a room search or certain
University officials' inability to understand that
concern for individual liberties might be the
primary objection to the search.
While the University may have the legal right
to inspect residences it owns, administrators
must realize that a legal right does not provide
the moral justification for gratuitous exercises of
power — especially when such actions infringe
basic rights of community members.
The Board of Trusteesin 1963 adopted the
statement "in student affairs, Stanford seeks the
largest individual liberty consistent with good
work and orderly conduct" as a rule of conduct
associated with the Fundamental Standard. This
statement recognizes that respect for personal
liberties must lie at the heart of actions between
and toward students.
A room search by agentsof the University isa
clear breach of those liberties and should be

treated as nothing less than a challenge to the
basis of respect that theoretically underlies
actions within the University community. The
respect embodied in the Fundamental Standard
is of paramount importance; the principles of
the Standard are the University'sequivalent of
the Bill of Rightsorcomprise, perhaps,
Stanford's conscience.
If students deserve to be treated in accord
with the Standard, they, too, must heed the
Standard's mandate to show "respect for order,
morality, personal honor,andthe rightsof
others." Such language may sound archaic
given prevailing tolerance fordiverse moral
codes, but it nevertheless prohibits theft of
common furniture.
Any search must be treated not only as a
response to an immediate problem of cases of
Standard violations but also with the realization
that a search questions the honor and integrity
of everyone whose room is inspected.
Perhaps the most disturbing part of the
planned search isthatobjectionsgrounded in
principle were not treated seriously, if they were
considered at all. The University ignored other,
potentially more effective measures in its rush to
conduct room searches. Problems of inventory
and private use of common property should
have been addressed through greater publicity
of the problems', through actions of house
managers and resident advisors, through house
meetings, and through refusal to replace
missing furniture long before a blanket search
of student rooms was even contemplated.
Money should be only one of many issues the
University considers when it plans an action
violating residents' liberties and mocking
principles of just conduct. The Daily hopes
personal respect and concern for individual
rights prevent any future plans for room
searches.
