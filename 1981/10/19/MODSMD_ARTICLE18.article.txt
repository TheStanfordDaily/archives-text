# BEYOND OUR CONTROL/Editor's Viewpoint
## On professors and students 
### 
Brown University Prof. Jacob Neusner created
a stiron the Brown campus late last spring when
he submitted a letter to the Brown Daily Herald
which was headlined, "A commencement
speech ygu won't hear." In the letter, Neusner
berated graduating students for the host of
academic and social ills which he felt they had
exhibited during their time at school.
These included poor performance, apathetic
attitudes and self-centeredness. He also blasted
the school's environment for tolerating
"routine and slipshod presentation" and for
promoting "an altogetherforgiving world, in
which whatever slight effort you gave was all
that was demanded."
Quoting a professor at Rutgers, Neusner
wrote, "College has spoiled you by reading
papers that don't deserve to be read, listening to
comments that don't deserve a hearing, paying
attention even to the lazy, ill-informed and
rude. We had to do it, for the sake of education.
But nobody will ever do it again. College has
deprived you of adequate preparation for the
next 50 years. It has failed you by being easy,
free, forgiving, attentive, comfortable,
interesting, unchallenging fun. Good luck
tomorrow."
Although he never did deliver the speech,
Neusner's words are no less significant, even
prophetic. And by no meansdotheyapply only
to Brown University.
Stanford students are, for the most part,
spoiled; we're dishonest to admit otherwise.
The University is known to graduate schools
across the land for grade inflation so great that
it's difficult to judge transcripts clearly; we're
told by the University's official grading policy
that As and Bs, constitute, respectively,
"exceptional" and "superior" performance,
when in fact most students here consider it a

tragedy to receive anything less.
We'reallowed to drop classes whenever it's
convenient, and to remove failures from the
academic record; the message is that it's simply
not possible to fail here. In general, for most, the
standards by which they are judged bear
precious little relation to what they have actually
achieved — or failed to achieve.
What Neusner also wrote, by way of
explanation, disturbs me a great deal. "It was
that we (professors) did not want to be
bothered, and the easy way out was pretense:
smiles and easy Bs."
That is a bad situation as well. In the long run,
no professor is doing students a favor by praising
work that is not acceptable, giving grades that
are not earned, endorsing waysof thinking that
are faulty. Granted, it appears easier on the
professors, who feel they have less to be
bothered with, and easier on the students, who
are duped into believing they somehow have
less to worry about.
Unfortunately, what we're being taught in this
regard is very unlikely tocontinue to hold true,
at least for those who leave here, and professors
are not really doing their jobs unlessthey make
an effort to teach usthat. Beyond here, failures
are failures; they are learned from, and in time
overcome; but they are still acknowledged.
Good work is recognized, but so too is bad
work, and bad work has bad consequences.
Those who are dull, lazy or unmotivated are
recognized as such, and quitters are not heroes.
None of these are particularly pleasant facts,
but facts they are. Professors here are doing us
nothing short of a disservice, by the examples
they set and the standards they enforce, to teach
us otherwise.

rude. We had to do it, for the sake of education.
But nobody will ever do it again. College has
deprived you of adequate preparation for the
next 50 years. It has failed you by being easy,
free, forgiving, attentive, comfortable,
interesting, unchallenging fun. Good luck
tomorrow."
Although he never did deliver the speech,
Neusner's words are no less significant, even
prophetic. And by no meansdotheyapply only
to Brown University.
Stanford students are, for the most part,
spoiled; we're dishonest to admit otherwise.
The University is known to graduate schools
across the land for grade inflation so great that
it's difficult to judge transcripts clearly; we're
told by the University's official grading policy
that As and Bs, constitute, respectively,
"exceptional" and "superior" performance,
when in fact most students here consider it a

tragedy to receive anything less.
We'reallowed to drop classes whenever it's
convenient, and to remove failures from the
academic record; the message is that it's simply
not possible to fail here. In general, for most, the
standards by which they are judged bear
precious little relation to what they have actually
achieved — or failed to achieve.
What Neusner also wrote, by way of
explanation, disturbs me a great deal. "It was
that we (professors) did not want to be
bothered, and the easy way out was pretense:
smiles and easy Bs."
That is a bad situation as well. In the long run,
no professor is doing students a favor by praising
work that is not acceptable, giving grades that
are not earned, endorsing waysof thinking that
are faulty. Granted, it appears easier on the
professors, who feel they have less to be
bothered with, and easier on the students, who
are duped into believing they somehow have
less to worry about.
Unfortunately, what we're being taught in this
regard is very unlikely tocontinue to hold true,
at least for those who leave here, and professors
are not really doing their jobs unlessthey make
an effort to teach usthat. Beyond here, failures
are failures; they are learned from, and in time
overcome; but they are still acknowledged.
Good work is recognized, but so too is bad
work, and bad work has bad consequences.
Those who are dull, lazy or unmotivated are
recognized as such, and quitters are not heroes.
None of these are particularly pleasant facts,
but facts they are. Professors here are doing us
nothing short of a disservice, by the examples
they set and the standards they enforce, to teach
us otherwise.
