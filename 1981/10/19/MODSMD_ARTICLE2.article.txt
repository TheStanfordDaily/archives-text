# Hoover in the 80s: moving to greater national prominence
## Profs divided on Hoover influence 
### Phil Chritton 
While the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace con
tinues to win national acclaim, espe
cially since the 1980 presidential elec
tion, its support among Stanford fac
ulty is less than unanimous.
Although most faculty members
didn't hesitate to praise the institu
tion as a valuable University re
source, they disagreed considerably
about its conservative inclinations
and the quality of research carried
out there.
History and Political Science Prof.
Alexander Dallin, who resigned from
a position at Hoover four years ago,
said the institution's political orien
tation is "something that doesn't
belong on a campus." He said he
finds the results of much Hoover
work to be "absolutely predictable."
Dallin explained that during his
timewith the institution, although no
one told him what to write, things be
came "awkward" because an "in
formal pressure" was placed upon
him while working.
And, although Dallin said he feels
the institution has some excellent
scholars, he called the Hoover fellow
selection process "rather one-sided
and self-perpetuating" for conserva
tives.
History Prof. Carl Degler, however,
sees the Institution's conservative
outlook as desirable for the Univer
sity's diversity, balancing out Stan
ford's liberal and radical elements.
Economics Prof. Paul Evans also
said it would be hard to find anyone
in his department who didn't think
having Hoover next door was a valu

able resource.
Evans said the institution's money
brings some of the best people
around, such as Senior Fellow Robert
Hall, an economist. Evans explained
that the Economics Department
"couldn't afford the salary to keep
Hall here."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall described fellows at the
Hoover Institution as "simply not a
group of 100 percent right-wing fa
natics." He said Hoover does support
political liberals, though rarely to do
politically-oriented work.
Marshall also praised the institu
tion's work, saying "Hoover books
are brilliantly free of jargon and very
readable." He said the fellows are us
ing "very, very considerable skill in
turning out stuff that is in some cases
really good scholarship."
However, he claimed that many
Hoover books, especially those re
garding domestic policy, are logically
and factually quite good, but "are
based on false assumptions."
To explain his point, Marshall re
ferred to a book by Martin Anderson,
Reagan's Domestic Policy Adviser
and former Hoover fellow. Marshall
said Anderson's thesis that poverty
