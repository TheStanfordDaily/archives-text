# Mideast forum page
## 
### 
Anwar Sadat is dead. President Reagan wants to sell
AW ACS to Saudi Arabia. The Arab world is divided,
and Egypt's political future is uncertain. The Mideast
is in turmoil.
What does all this mean? What will happen
tomorrow, next month, next year? What is America's
role in this region in the days ahead?
We think these questions are critical. For that
reason, the Daily is planning a special forum page for
Tuesday, Oct. 27. Submissions should be typed,
double-spaced, on a 57-space line. Optimum length
is 750 words. Bring your columns to the Daily opinions
office by 2 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23.
This is your forum â€” tell us what you think.
