## Give new dorms solar power 
### 
With front page coverage in the
Daily the following day, I assume
most students are aware of the
groundbreaking ceremony for the
new dorms which took place last
Monday, Oct. 12.
The ceremony was indeed quite
lovely and I am sure well deserved in
honoring the wonderful service
which the Sterlings have given Stan
ford. I also recognize the necessity of
treating the "Stanford family" well.
Yet I cannot resist commenting on
the irony of the situation..
I became involved with the plan
ning of the new dorms almost two
years ago when I and several others
unmentioned sought a housing com
plex designed with energy conserva
tion in mind. The main emphasis of
our lobbying was to get a solar hot
water system incorporated into the
new structures. In the process, I be
came a member of the planning
committee.
Upon submitting a responsible
cost analysis of such a solar system,
we proved that it was cost effective.
Nevertheless, the University said
such a system was not presently "ec
onomically practical." Accordingly,
no solar hot water system exists in the
plans.

Oh, provisions have been made to
retrofit once the economics become
"more attractive," but from what I
gather no schedule presently exists
for review. Clearly though, the time
for installation was upon construc
tion.
It is truly a sad state of affairs when
a leading university refuses to take
the initiative in such a vital concern as
energy, especially when refusal is on
account of dubious economic
feasibility. Economics aside, the
proper decision would have been to
install a solar system. Is this how a re
spected university treats an issue our
former president called the "moral
equivalent of war?"
Well, the ceremony Was a roaring
success. How could it fail, supplied as
it was with two bars, plenty of waiters
to serve the guests, and tables liter
ally piled high with food?
Too bad that despite the tuition we
pay socially responsible investments
are unaffordable. I am glad to see,
though, that the cash still flows freely
for those really important invest
ments, such as that ceremony last
Monday.
