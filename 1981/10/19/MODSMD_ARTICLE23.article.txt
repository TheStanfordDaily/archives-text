## Only 'just wars' merit participation 
### 
I almost scrapped this column,
thinking my topic, military service, an
untimely topic. But even now, two
AWACS crank their engines, soon to
depart for Egypt's western border.
Weapons sit on government tarmacs
awaiting transport to the Sudan. Spe
cial Forces train Honduran and El
Salvadorean troops. It's a hot world
and the draft call may be just a C-130
away.
Yet, as Stanford students, we
should not be the first in greens. This
is college, home of protest and
guardian of the national conscious
ness. At Stanford and places like it —
Harvard, Columbia, Berkeley — civil
disobedience worked, an insane war
came to an end. Perhaps we can
create an axiom: other people fight,
students protest the fighting.
If a war is unjust, protest seems our
only recourse. Americans breed indi
vidualism and libertarian ideal in
their children. Civil disobedience, a
taboo in other countries, permeates
us like comforting narcotic gas. We
are the children of liberty, and pro
test, if not our civil right, is our God
given one. When government lead
ers make grave, potentially deadly
errors, we will be there, placards and
epithets at the ready.
During these hair trigger times, the
bit of radicalism under young Ameri
ca's skin comforts tremendously.
With some decisive action, the U.S.
community can strip the gears of
America's war machine.
American students may have more
radicalism in their veins than neces
sary. Campus opinion condemns mil
itary service as something unen
durable; a noble value becomes a
moral Frankenstein. As students at a
"first line university," we must serve
during noble wars just as readily as
we protest ignoble ones.
The point may appear absurd, for
America, at least in recent years, has
waged few just wars. But just wars do
exist: witness the European theater
during World War II; Libya, Israel
and Poland could all be sites of
modern just wars.
The general framework for de
termining -if a war is justified is a
simple one in most cases. Economic
interests may or may not qualify, de
pending on the vitality of, say, an in

terrupted resource supply. The clas
sic example of such an interest, oil,
could qualify because a major inter
ruption is serious business: many
American livelihoods depend on a
steady supply of crude.
One scenario unequivocally quali
fies for a declaration of war. If, as dur
ing World War 11, a fanatical govern
ment threatens its citizenry, or sys
tematic genocide spreads through
out a region, then a military confron
tation to stop the threat is ap
propriate.
Certainly each individual must de
cide whether a war is just. And if it is,
students must accede to the draft or
enlist to prevent the recurrence of a
debacle like the situation in which
we found ourselves in Vietnam.
Vietnam inadvertantly became a
form of genocide. At the same time
that President Lyndon Johnson was
launching the Great Society, he was
assembling an army composed large
ly of blacks and chicanos. Allowing a
disproportionate number of minor
ities to fill military ranks dilutes the
unified commitment to the war and
devalues the life of blacks and
chicanos as compared to whites.
Before we take to the streets in out
rage, we should consider those who
cannot afford the luxury of civil dis
obedience.
Also, the officers' corps must be
drawn from campuses. This was not
usually the case during the Vietnam
war, and both Vietnamese and Amer
ican enlisted men suffered because
of it. Unless rational men become of
ficers, those positions are taken by
psychopaths, near psychopaths and
joy-killers. My Lai happened precise
ly because the officers involved lost
their sense of right; they became ob
sessed with the control they had over
human life and their ability to end it.
As bizarre as this might sound, mili
tary officers must hate war. They
should constantly question their ac

tions and carefully consider the con
sequences of their decisions. If Wil
liam Calley and his superiors had felt
the inner turmoil of a well-de
veloped conscience, My Lai might
still be just the name of another ob
scure village.
Responsibility in wartime, or just
before wartime, does not lie solely
with those who serve. Because of the
government's behavior during the
Vietnam era, American youth lost a
great deal of their faith in Washing
ton and the entire political process.
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon, by failing to ask for a declara
tion of war, bypassed Congress and
quashed the representative voice;
because of this, America suffered un
der ten years of lies and distortions.
The Reagan Administration, and
future administrations as well, can
count on national backing of future
military action only if they regain the
national trust and guarantee — and
deliver — an honest flow of informa
tion about the war.
Universities occupy a unique place
in American society; by being here,
we are supposedly possessed of spe
cial knowledge that allows us to
make subtle ethical distinctions. In
this role, civil disobedience is an im
portant and precious tool. The ex
ercise it in opposition toanything but
the most serious improprieties is
nothing short of criminal.
Michael Herr concludes his book,
Dispatches with, "Vietnam, Vietnam,
Vietnam. We have all been there."
We have all been there; perhaps, if
we scrape and fight and love peace,
we will never again enter an un
declared war. But every war is not
Vietnam, nor is every battle a crime.
Students must prepare, when and if a
just war comes, to stand in the armed
line.

devalues the life of blacks and

Before we take to the streets in out
rage, we should consider those who
cannot afford the luxury of civil dis
obedience.
Also, the officers' corps must be
drawn from campuses. This was not
usually the case during the Vietnam
war, and both Vietnamese and Amer
ican enlisted men suffered because
of it. Unless rational men become of
ficers, those positions are taken by
psychopaths, near psychopaths and
joy-killers. My Lai happened precise
ly because the officers involved lost
their sense of right; they became ob
sessed with the control they had over
human life and their ability to end it.
As bizarre as this might sound, mili
tary officers must hate war. They
should constantly question their ac

tions and carefully consider the con
sequences of their decisions. If Wil
liam Calley and his superiors had felt
the inner turmoil of a well-de
veloped conscience, My Lai might
still be just the name of another ob
scure village.
Responsibility in wartime, or just
before wartime, does not lie solely
with those who serve. Because of the
government's behavior during the
Vietnam era, American youth lost a
great deal of their faith in Washing
ton and the entire political process.
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon, by failing to ask for a declara
tion of war, bypassed Congress and
quashed the representative voice;
because of this, America suffered un
der ten years of lies and distortions.
The Reagan Administration, and
future administrations as well, can
count on national backing of future
military action only if they regain the
national trust and guarantee — and
deliver — an honest flow of informa
tion about the war.
Universities occupy a unique place
in American society; by being here,
we are supposedly possessed of spe
cial knowledge that allows us to
make subtle ethical distinctions. In
this role, civil disobedience is an im
portant and precious tool. The ex
ercise it in opposition toanything but
the most serious improprieties is
nothing short of criminal.
Michael Herr concludes his book,
Dispatches with, "Vietnam, Vietnam,
Vietnam. We have all been there."
We have all been there; perhaps, if
we scrape and fight and love peace,
we will never again enter an un
declared war. But every war is not
Vietnam, nor is every battle a crime.
Students must prepare, when and if a
just war comes, to stand in the armed
line.

I almost scrapped this column,
thinking my topic, military service, an
untimely topic. But even now, two
AWACS crank their engines, soon to
depart for Egypt's western border.
Weapons sit on government tarmacs
awaiting transport to the Sudan. Spe
cial Forces train Honduran and El
Salvadorean troops. It's a hot world
and the draft call may be just a C-130
away.
Yet, as Stanford students, we
should not be the first in greens. This
is college, home of protest and
guardian of the national conscious
ness. At Stanford and places like it —
Harvard, Columbia, Berkeley — civil
disobedience worked, an insane war
came to an end. Perhaps we can
create an axiom: other people fight,
students protest the fighting.
If a war is unjust, protest seems our
only recourse. Americans breed indi
vidualism and libertarian ideal in
their children. Civil disobedience, a
taboo in other countries, permeates
us like comforting narcotic gas. We
are the children of liberty, and pro
test, if not our civil right, is our God
given one. When government lead
ers make grave, potentially deadly
errors, we will be there, placards and
epithets at the ready.
During these hair trigger times, the
bit of radicalism under young Ameri
ca's skin comforts tremendously.
With some decisive action, the U.S.
community can strip the gears of
America's war machine.
American students may have more
radicalism in their veins than neces
sary. Campus opinion condemns mil
itary service as something unen
durable; a noble value becomes a
moral Frankenstein. As students at a
"first line university," we must serve
during noble wars just as readily as
we protest ignoble ones.
The point may appear absurd, for
America, at least in recent years, has
waged few just wars. But just wars do
exist: witness the European theater
during World War II; Libya, Israel
and Poland could all be sites of
modern just wars.
The general framework for de
termining -if a war is justified is a
simple one in most cases. Economic
interests may or may not qualify, de
pending on the vitality of, say, an in

terrupted resource supply. The clas
sic example of such an interest, oil,
could qualify because a major inter
ruption is serious business: many
American livelihoods depend on a
steady supply of crude.
One scenario unequivocally quali
fies for a declaration of war. If, as dur
ing World War 11, a fanatical govern
ment threatens its citizenry, or sys
tematic genocide spreads through
out a region, then a military confron
tation to stop the threat is ap
propriate.
Certainly each individual must de
cide whether a war is just. And if it is,
students must accede to the draft or
enlist to prevent the recurrence of a
debacle like the situation in which
we found ourselves in Vietnam.
Vietnam inadvertantly became a
form of genocide. At the same time
that President Lyndon Johnson was
launching the Great Society, he was
assembling an army composed large
ly of blacks and chicanos. Allowing a
disproportionate number of minor
ities to fill military ranks dilutes the
unified commitment to the war and
devalues the life of blacks and
chicanos as compared to whites.
