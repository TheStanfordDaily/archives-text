## Tod Bergstrom/Luke Cole Price is right for Reagan's deal 
### 
It's time once again for Let's Make
a Deal, and here's America's top
trader and T.V.'s big dealer, Monty
Hall.. .
"Thank you very much and wel
come to Let's Make a Deal, the mar
ketplace of America! For our first
deal today, does anyone in the au
dience have an ardvaark? No?
C'mon! How about a set of five oper
ational AWACS planes?"
(A sightly stooped, older man,
wearing a cowboy outfit jumps up.)
"I do! I brought five AWACS
planes to trade with you, Monty!"
"What's you name sir, and what do
you do for a living?"

Tm afraid not, Ron. It's against the rules.,.of
the free market system to have both the Social
Security System and an Economic plan with a
balanced budget/

"My name's Ron, Ronald Reagan.
I'm the President of the United
States."
"Well good for you, Ron! Tell us,
how do you happen to have five
AWACS planes here with you to
day?"
"To tell you the truth, Monty, I
tried to trade them last week for
some foreign oil interests on The
Price is Right, but Bob Barker said I
couldn't do it without Congress' ap
proval."
"That certainly explains it, Ron. In
any event, I see you've brought your
lovely wife with you today . . .
"No, Monty, Nancy's at home with
the china. This is Bonzo, my pet
chimp and sidekick."
"I see. Well Ron, for today's first
deal I'm willing to trade what my as
sistant, Jay Stewart, has on his tray, for
your five AWACS planes. . . what'll it
be?"
"I'd love to Monty, but only if you
can assure me that the AWACS will
be used solely for defensive
purposes."
"I think we can go along with that.
Yes, our producer says we have a

deal. Now, Jay, what do we have in
the box for Ron?"
"Well, Monty, Ron has just won
the new SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM!
Yes, Ron, you're well on your way to
owning and operating your own wel
fare state with this new, fully func
tional SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM,
which comes complete with all the
options, including AID TO FAMILIES
WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN, UN
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, and
MEDICARE. And all this is brought to
you by one of America's leading eco
nomic stimulators, THE LIBERAL
TRADITION COMPANY."
"Monty, it's just what I've always

wanted!"
"Hold on a moment, Ron, we're
not finished yet ... I have another
deal for you — how would you like to
trade the SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM
for a brand new ECONOMIC PLAN
with a BALANCED BUDGET?"
"Monty, do you mean to say that I
can have both the Social Security Sys
tem and a New Economic Plan with a
balanced budget?"
"I'mafraid not, Ron. It's against the
rules of Let's Make a Deal and the
free market system to have both the
Social Security System and and an Ec
onomic Plan with a balanced budget.
You're going to have to choose
either one or the other."
"But Monty, I promised my friends
back in TV land that I would win
both!"
"I'm sorry, Ron, but you can only
have one."
"Monty, can I talk this over with
my chimpanzee before I decide?"
"By all means."
(Ron and Bonzo have a hasty con
ference.)
"Monty, we've decided to take the

new Economic program with a bal
anced budget and forget the Social
Security program — all those old
people are going to die soon enough
anyway."
"Shrewd thinking, Ron — and you
too, Bonzo. I like a man and a chimp
who know what they're committed
to.
"And now for the big deal of the
day! Ron, are you a gambler? Are you
willing to bet your winnings today on
what's behind door number one,
door number two, or door number
three?"
"I don't know, Monty, Bonzo and I
have been pretty conservative in the
past. .. but we'll take a chance."
"Okay, Ron, the lovely Carol Mer
rill will show you what is behind two
out of the three doors. . . Jay?"
"Behind door number one we
have every family's dream ... A pre
served environment! (Oooohs from
the crowd) Yes, Ron, you too can
own this beautiful completely
foliated, pollution free set of na
tional parks!"
"Wow... I don't know what to say,
other than I owned one of those
once and I gave it to my friend Jimmy
Watt to play with and he messed it all
up. No, they're too hard to deal with
. . . Can I see what's behind door
number two?"
"Sure, Ron .. . Well, what do we
have here? It's a female Supreme
Court Justice! What do you think of
that, Ron?"
"Oh no, Monty — I've already got
one of those, why would I need an
other?"
"Okay Ron, that only leaves door
number three — the mystery door!
Are you sure you want to go ahead?"
"Yes, Monty, I feel I owe it to God
and my country."
"Well Ron, our times up for today
"But remember, folks, tune in next
year as Ronald Reagan gambles his
entire economic plan, complete with
balanced budget, on the unknown
behind door number three!"

deal for you — how would you like to
trade the SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM
for a brand new ECONOMIC PLAN
with a BALANCED BUDGET?"
"Monty, do you mean to say that I
can have both the Social Security Sys
tem and a New Economic Plan with a
balanced budget?"
"I'mafraid not, Ron. It's against the
rules of Let's Make a Deal and the
free market system to have both the
Social Security System and and an Ec
onomic Plan with a balanced budget.
You're going to have to choose
either one or the other."
"But Monty, I promised my friends
back in TV land that I would win
both!"
"I'm sorry, Ron, but you can only
have one."
"Monty, can I talk this over with
my chimpanzee before I decide?"
"By all means."
(Ron and Bonzo have a hasty con
ference.)
"Monty, we've decided to take the

new Economic program with a bal
anced budget and forget the Social
Security program — all those old
people are going to die soon enough
anyway."
"Shrewd thinking, Ron — and you
too, Bonzo. I like a man and a chimp
who know what they're committed
to.
"And now for the big deal of the
day! Ron, are you a gambler? Are you
willing to bet your winnings today on
what's behind door number one,
door number two, or door number
three?"
"I don't know, Monty, Bonzo and I
have been pretty conservative in the
past. .. but we'll take a chance."
"Okay, Ron, the lovely Carol Mer
rill will show you what is behind two
out of the three doors. . . Jay?"
"Behind door number one we
have every family's dream ... A pre
served environment! (Oooohs from
the crowd) Yes, Ron, you too can
own this beautiful completely
foliated, pollution free set of na
tional parks!"
"Wow... I don't know what to say,
other than I owned one of those
once and I gave it to my friend Jimmy
Watt to play with and he messed it all
up. No, they're too hard to deal with
. . . Can I see what's behind door
number two?"
"Sure, Ron .. . Well, what do we
have here? It's a female Supreme
Court Justice! What do you think of
that, Ron?"
"Oh no, Monty — I've already got
one of those, why would I need an
other?"
"Okay Ron, that only leaves door
number three — the mystery door!
Are you sure you want to go ahead?"
"Yes, Monty, I feel I owe it to God
and my country."
"Well Ron, our times up for today
"But remember, folks, tune in next
year as Ronald Reagan gambles his
entire economic plan, complete with
balanced budget, on the unknown
behind door number three!"

It's time once again for Let's Make
a Deal, and here's America's top
trader and T.V.'s big dealer, Monty
Hall.. .
"Thank you very much and wel
come to Let's Make a Deal, the mar
ketplace of America! For our first
deal today, does anyone in the au
dience have an ardvaark? No?
C'mon! How about a set of five oper
ational AWACS planes?"
(A sightly stooped, older man,
wearing a cowboy outfit jumps up.)
"I do! I brought five AWACS
planes to trade with you, Monty!"
"What's you name sir, and what do
you do for a living?"

Tm afraid not, Ron. It's against the rules.,.of
the free market system to have both the Social
Security System and an Economic plan with a
balanced budget/

"My name's Ron, Ronald Reagan.
I'm the President of the United
States."
"Well good for you, Ron! Tell us,
how do you happen to have five
AWACS planes here with you to
day?"
"To tell you the truth, Monty, I
tried to trade them last week for
some foreign oil interests on The
Price is Right, but Bob Barker said I
couldn't do it without Congress' ap
proval."
"That certainly explains it, Ron. In
any event, I see you've brought your
lovely wife with you today . . .
"No, Monty, Nancy's at home with
the china. This is Bonzo, my pet
chimp and sidekick."
"I see. Well Ron, for today's first
deal I'm willing to trade what my as
sistant, Jay Stewart, has on his tray, for
your five AWACS planes. . . what'll it
be?"
"I'd love to Monty, but only if you
can assure me that the AWACS will
be used solely for defensive
purposes."
"I think we can go along with that.
Yes, our producer says we have a

deal. Now, Jay, what do we have in
the box for Ron?"
"Well, Monty, Ron has just won
the new SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM!
Yes, Ron, you're well on your way to
owning and operating your own wel
fare state with this new, fully func
tional SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM,
which comes complete with all the
options, including AID TO FAMILIES
WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN, UN
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, and
MEDICARE. And all this is brought to
you by one of America's leading eco
nomic stimulators, THE LIBERAL
TRADITION COMPANY."
