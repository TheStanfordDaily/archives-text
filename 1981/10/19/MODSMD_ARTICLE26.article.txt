## Cash in on 'Stanford-in-advertising' 
### 
Not until Charles Darwin read
Lyell's Principles of Geology did he
connect observed phenomena and
evolution. I felt the same burst of en
lightenment when I walked into a
Safeway market the other day.
A simple San Francisco Chronicle
article was my Muse. The headline:
"Elementary school's enrollment
down; soon higher education to be
affected."
Then Safeway comes into play.
Sales down, looking for customers.
The connection was inevitable. I
soon realized the immediate future:
Stanford in advertising.
"This week at Stanford, get two
higher educations for the price of
one," ran across my mind. God, what
a potential. And I didn't even con
sider the double coupons.
"Grade point bingo. For every ap

plication we receive you'll collect a
GP bingo card. Get three 4.00's in a
row and you'll cash in on a big
future." The consolation prizes
couldn't be too bad either: your
name immortalized on a fountain.
"Higher grades overall. Bring a
copy of your transcript from any oth
er school with 20 classes or less and if
we can't beat it, you'll receive double
your tuition in cash." What potential,
what students could say no? Who
cares about declining enrollment in
elementary schools, Stanford can
hardly sell a nation.
"Pay for only the classes you go to.
If you can't stomach a lecture, we'll
triple your final grade, and if pro
fessors don't make the class attractive
to you, they don't get paid. What oth
er major University can makeanoffer
like that?" Wow, professors under

my review, my whim to wander into
class. I can just imagine: The Quad is
a neo-Castro street. Callers line the
row of neon signs in front of Mem
Chu.
The voices melt into a montage of
"Hey kid, come here, you'll never
see a geophysics lecture like this
again, c'mon, c'mon, they're hot,
they're molten, you've never seen
tectonics move like this and wait until
you see their fault lines." "Hey kid,
you Homo sapiens, got Homo erec
tus in the family, put away your
philately, and come and get a real
piece of evolutionary anatomy."
Madison Avenue blares the way
into the business school. "Tired of
shmutz all over your brain, try Stan
ford, for a fresh clean you all through
the day." A little creative packaging
would tidy things up a bit. The
Astrophysics department, proud of
the new Voyager Saturn shots, would
be painted red and emblazed with
"NO more dirty rings." CERAS could
use a little red lighting to set the
mood for the 20 foot flashing
billboard "The House of 111-Com

pute."
"And this class has only been of
fered by an 83 year-old professor at
CIT who drives from Pasadena on
Sundays. I'll back my car over your
dog Spot if you don't come to Stan
ford."
"Tired of standing in lines. Sure
you are. Well, at Stanford, if you ever
have more than three people in your
line, we'll build another building,
dorm, school, library, university.
Money, who needs it, we'll offer you
an education at our cost, yes, one
higher education at our cost. Please,
only one education per family, offer
limited to supply on hand."
Well, even if they weren't suc
cessful, the end would be glorious.
Forget the four horsemen, just bring
a van to Stanford's going out of busi
ness sale. We lost our lease, and ev
erything has to go. We're moving out
professors, staff, buildings, Hoover
Tower. First come first served and no
returns please."

soon realized the immediate future:
Stanford in advertising.
"This week at Stanford, get two
higher educations for the price of
one," ran across my mind. God, what
a potential. And I didn't even con
sider the double coupons.
"Grade point bingo. For every ap

plication we receive you'll collect a
GP bingo card. Get three 4.00's in a
row and you'll cash in on a big
future." The consolation prizes
couldn't be too bad either: your
name immortalized on a fountain.
"Higher grades overall. Bring a
copy of your transcript from any oth
er school with 20 classes or less and if
we can't beat it, you'll receive double
your tuition in cash." What potential,
what students could say no? Who
cares about declining enrollment in
elementary schools, Stanford can
hardly sell a nation.
"Pay for only the classes you go to.
If you can't stomach a lecture, we'll
triple your final grade, and if pro
fessors don't make the class attractive
to you, they don't get paid. What oth
er major University can makeanoffer
like that?" Wow, professors under

my review, my whim to wander into
class. I can just imagine: The Quad is
a neo-Castro street. Callers line the
row of neon signs in front of Mem
Chu.
The voices melt into a montage of
"Hey kid, come here, you'll never
see a geophysics lecture like this
again, c'mon, c'mon, they're hot,
they're molten, you've never seen
tectonics move like this and wait until
you see their fault lines." "Hey kid,
you Homo sapiens, got Homo erec
tus in the family, put away your
philately, and come and get a real
piece of evolutionary anatomy."
Madison Avenue blares the way
into the business school. "Tired of
shmutz all over your brain, try Stan
ford, for a fresh clean you all through
the day." A little creative packaging
would tidy things up a bit. The
Astrophysics department, proud of
the new Voyager Saturn shots, would
be painted red and emblazed with
"NO more dirty rings." CERAS could
use a little red lighting to set the
mood for the 20 foot flashing
billboard "The House of 111-Com

pute."
"And this class has only been of
fered by an 83 year-old professor at
CIT who drives from Pasadena on
Sundays. I'll back my car over your
dog Spot if you don't come to Stan
ford."
"Tired of standing in lines. Sure
you are. Well, at Stanford, if you ever
have more than three people in your
line, we'll build another building,
dorm, school, library, university.
Money, who needs it, we'll offer you
an education at our cost, yes, one
higher education at our cost. Please,
only one education per family, offer
limited to supply on hand."
Well, even if they weren't suc
cessful, the end would be glorious.
Forget the four horsemen, just bring
a van to Stanford's going out of busi
ness sale. We lost our lease, and ev
erything has to go. We're moving out
professors, staff, buildings, Hoover
Tower. First come first served and no
returns please."

Not until Charles Darwin read
Lyell's Principles of Geology did he
connect observed phenomena and
evolution. I felt the same burst of en
lightenment when I walked into a
Safeway market the other day.
A simple San Francisco Chronicle
article was my Muse. The headline:
"Elementary school's enrollment
down; soon higher education to be
affected."
Then Safeway comes into play.
Sales down, looking for customers.
The connection was inevitable. I
soon realized the immediate future:
Stanford in advertising.

higher educations for the price of
