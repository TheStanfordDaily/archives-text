## Papandreou begrudges only CIA 
### 
Washington — Bad news, bad
news. That's what the American in
telligence community has been re
ceiving lately from abroad. And it
may soon be in for more.
Next week, Greeks are likely to
elect front-runner Andreas Papan
dreou, a flamboyant, 62-year-old
economist as their next prime min
ister.
The bad news isn't that the socialist
candidate plans to lead Greece from
NATO, nor that he's vowed to close
America's four military bases in his
country next spring.
The bad news is that Papandreou
has a grudge against the CIA.
Educated at Harvard during the
early 19405, Papandreou has taught
economics at the Universities of Min

nesota, California and Northwestern.
During his 20 years in this country, he
served in the U.S. Navy, married an
American and developed many last
ing friendships.
But on the morning of April 21,
1967, during a military coup, Papan
dreou was arrested in Athensand im
prisoned for eight months. In his
book Democracy at Gunpoint, he
blames the CIA and the Pentagon for
their involvement in the coup.
According to academic friends in
America, Papandreou's days in pris
on loom heavily on his conscience.
Friends call him a '"60s radical" who
will steer Greece toward the non
aligned movement popular with
many developing countries. They say
he'd probably follow the lead of
Mexico's Lopez Portillo in support
ing the Salvadoran resistance.
In another book, Paternalistic Cap
italism, Papandreou criticizes AmerK
ca's course during the 1960s in the
developing world. "The United
States holds the stage as the main
global, counterrevolutionary in
terventionist force," he wrote. "Viet
nam, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, the Do
minican Republic, Guatemala and
Greece are some of the largest mon
uments erected in the wake of this
counterrevolutionary expansionism
of postwar America
While security analysts may dis
agree with Papandreou's outlook,
they don't doubt his intellect. Says
one friend who served with him in
the UC-Berkeley economics depart
ment, "He is head and shoulders
above any other leader in Western
Europe in terms of clarity, vision, re
sponsibility and general in
telligence."
And he won't let the U.S. live down
its recent history.
Since President Reagan delivered
his treatise on violent crime a few
weeks ago in New Orleans, few ob
servers have noted his limited con
cern for white-collar crime.
According to one federal estimate,
"crime in the suites" cost Americans
$50 billion per year.
Jimmy Carter and former Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti ranked
kickbacks, embezzlement and cor

porate mischief among their top en
forcement priorities. "There's been a
definite change in emphasis," con
ceded an aide to the Senate Judiciary
Committee recently.
Of course, next to murderers and
heroin pushers, white-collar crimi
nals can appear harmless. These days,
you don't need to live in New York
City to have your future threatened
at gunpoint.
By encouraging lawmen to focus
their limited resources on violent
criminals, the Reagan administration
probably presumes that Americans
have lost interest in catching elusive
white-collar crooks.
But Reagan's advisers should avoid
crime-enforcement double stan
dards. "As a general rule, the public
views corruption as severely as larce
ny and most street crime," said Rob
ert M. Figlio, a University of Pennsyl
vania criminologist who is working
on a major crime-victimization study.
Egypt was facing a dubious eco
nomic future at the time of President
Anwar Sadat's death. According to
the London-based 8 Days magazine,
Egypt's oil earnings have suffered
from slipping world prices; its in
come from residents working abroad
has begun to level off; and foreign
tourist dollars have held around $700
million annually.
Here's an update on Ronald Rea
gan's call for volunteers: Last year,
the Reagans contributed just slightly
more than $3,000 to charity, less than
1.4 percent of their $200,000-plus in
come. Perhaps Reagan will give more
of his "fair share" this year as social
programs around the nation lose
their aid and compete for philan
thropists' dollars.
Finally, peace activists are alarmed
in England by a recent government
pamphlet, "Protect and Survive," in
forming citizens that they can shield
themselves from nuclear blasts by
wrapping their heads in their jackets
and whitewashing their windows.

their limited resources on violent
criminals, the Reagan administration
probably presumes that Americans
have lost interest in catching elusive
white-collar crooks.

crime-enforcement double stan

Egypt was facing a dubious eco
nomic future at the time of President
Anwar Sadat's death. According to
the London-based 8 Days magazine,
Egypt's oil earnings have suffered
from slipping world prices; its in

has begun to level off; and foreign
tourist dollars have held around $700
million annually.
Here's an update on Ronald Rea
gan's call for volunteers: Last year,
the Reagans contributed just slightly
more than $3,000 to charity, less than
1.4 percent of their $200,000-plus in
come. Perhaps Reagan will give more
of his "fair share" this year as social
programs around the nation lose
their aid and compete for philan

themselves from nuclear blasts by
wrapping their heads in their jackets
and whitewashing their windows.

Washington — Bad news, bad
news. That's what the American in
telligence community has been re
ceiving lately from abroad. And it
may soon be in for more.
Next week, Greeks are likely to
elect front-runner Andreas Papan
dreou, a flamboyant, 62-year-old
economist as their next prime min
ister.
The bad news isn't that the socialist
candidate plans to lead Greece from
NATO, nor that he's vowed to close
America's four military bases in his
country next spring.
The bad news is that Papandreou
has a grudge against the CIA.
Educated at Harvard during the
early 19405, Papandreou has taught
economics at the Universities of Min

nesota, California and Northwestern.
During his 20 years in this country, he
served in the U.S. Navy, married an
American and developed many last
ing friendships.
But on the morning of April 21,
1967, during a military coup, Papan
dreou was arrested in Athensand im
prisoned for eight months. In his
book Democracy at Gunpoint, he
blames the CIA and the Pentagon for
their involvement in the coup.
According to academic friends in
America, Papandreou's days in pris
on loom heavily on his conscience.
Friends call him a '"60s radical" who
will steer Greece toward the non
aligned movement popular with
many developing countries. They say
he'd probably follow the lead of
Mexico's Lopez Portillo in support
ing the Salvadoran resistance.
In another book, Paternalistic Cap
italism, Papandreou criticizes AmerK
ca's course during the 1960s in the
developing world. "The United
States holds the stage as the main
global, counterrevolutionary in
terventionist force," he wrote. "Viet
nam, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, the Do
minican Republic, Guatemala and
Greece are some of the largest mon
uments erected in the wake of this
counterrevolutionary expansionism
of postwar America
While security analysts may dis
agree with Papandreou's outlook,
they don't doubt his intellect. Says
one friend who served with him in
the UC-Berkeley economics depart
ment, "He is head and shoulders
above any other leader in Western
Europe in terms of clarity, vision, re
sponsibility and general in
telligence."
And he won't let the U.S. live down
its recent history.
Since President Reagan delivered
his treatise on violent crime a few
weeks ago in New Orleans, few ob
servers have noted his limited con
cern for white-collar crime.
According to one federal estimate,
"crime in the suites" cost Americans
$50 billion per year.
