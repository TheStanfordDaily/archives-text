## Savor solitude and enjoy the company 
### 
A couple nights ago, during my dinner break
from work, I was driving downtown towards the
fast food restaurants and sandwich stores, when I
decided that I was in the mood for some good
food, so I swung my car around and drove to
Ming's Chinese restaurant. For those of you that
don't know, Ming's is a very ritzy restaurant, the
place all the people at my high school took their
dates when they wanted to show off.
It didn't occur to me then that it might be inap
propriate to go to such a nice, expensive restaurant
by myself. However, the hostesses had to have a
small conference to figure out where I should sit.
When the waiter came to my table, before he was
willing to take away the other place setting at the
cozy 'table for two,' he felt it necessary to verify the
phenomenon by asking,"Justfor one? No one else
coming?"
I thought at first that I was just being paranoid,
but when I wandered through the dining rooms, I
observed couples, families, and large groups all
eating together — I seemed to be the only person
alone in the whole restaurant.
The waiters thought it was quite strange. They
didn't seem to think that I could possibly enjoy my
meal unless I had someone to talk to, and that
without a constant stream of conversation, I would
surely get bored or depressed. So, they took turns
coming by my table and talking to me, tossing out
inquiries about my meal, my tea r even my profi

ciency with chopsticks.
I found the whole thing all too funny to be of
fended, but I did begin to wonder what our society
has against people who like to be alone. I've been
told that this is not the case in big cities, or over
seas, but in Menlo Park (where I grew up and went
to high school) very few people go out anywhere
alone.
It appears that I am just different from other
people. I like being alone often, not just when I'm
taking a stroll or a bath, or other 'acceptable'
alone-activities. There have been times when I just
got the urge to go bowling, miniature golfing, or to
a movie, and when I can't seem to find anyone else
with the same inclination, I would just go, by my
self, and not give the matter too much thought.
Perhaps I looked younger then, and it was more
'socially acceptable.' I don't know why, but lately
people have begun to warn me about going out by
myself. They say, "you might see someone you
know, and you never know what they'll think,"
and "someone might think you're trying to get
picked up."
I don't really think all the fuss is based on my
being a woman. No, I just think that most small
town Americans don't like to be alone, or they sim
ply can't relate to someone who does (something
along the lines of the'fine if that's what you're into,
just don't do it around me' attitude).

This is unfortunate. I think I'm beginning to gain
a glimmer of understanding for the hassles and in
conveniences to which someone who has been
divorced or widowed is subjected.
However, for people who strive to be aware, the
world seems to be awash with 'isms.' I know that a
good many people here try to avoid sexism, racism
and classism, and often get discouraged as they
struggle, for in our society, there are so many
things that we are taught to take for granted, that
trying to be a sensitive and aware person isn't all
that easy.
Thus, I don't see our society's lack of com
prehension of loners as a cause, or an 'ism' to look
out for. Rather, I think it's more of a quaint custom,
impressed upon most of us as we grew up, when
we were taught 'acceptable' patterns of social
izing.
Nevertheless, I can think of countless times I've
heard people tell me that they wanted to see a cer
tain movie, or try a restaurant they had heard
about, but didn't do so because they "couldn't
find anyone to go with."
Next time, go ahead and take a chance — go
with yourself. You may discover some of the joys of
being alone, and perhaps surprise yourself by en
joying your own company.
