# Market figures show profit drops

New York — A new item has
been added to Wall Street's
long list of economic worries
— less-than-inspiring earnings
reports from some of the na
tion's leading companies.
All the returns aren't yet in
for the July-September quar
ter, and no one is writing off
the period as a uniform disaster
for corporate profits.
But several concerns with
large fan clubs in the invest
ment world have issued
"down" earnings reports in re
cent days, adding to concern
about the present state and
future prospects of business ac
tivity.
The most prominent of these
was International Business Ma-

chines, which on Tuesday re
ported a 22 percent drop in net
income — its first quarterly de
cline since the end of 1979.
Among others recording
lower results were Polaroid,
Honeywell, Schering-Plough,
Dow Chemical, Merck and
NCR, not to mention such Wall
Street stalwarts as Merrill Lynch
and E.F. Hutton.
In many of these instances,
weak earnings showings had
been expected, given the trou
bled economic environment in
which business has been oper
ating for months. But the stocks
of some of the companies in
volved were buffeted by selling
anyway.
IBM fell more than 4 points

to the low 50s, forexample, hit
ting its lowest price in a year
and a half. IBM shares, the No.
1 holding of investing institu
tions, have dropped about 20
points since early January.
"It is not the sign of a basical
ly healthy market when stocks
which are already down sharp
ly from their highsare still reac
ting to lower earnings," said
Newton Zinder, an analyst at
E.F. Hutton.
Indeed, the market as a
whole did not have a very
healthy week. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials fell
21.31 to 851.69, more than can
celling out the previous week's
12.27-point gain.
For multinational companies

like IBM, Merck and Schering-
Plough, one major source of
earnings problems has been
the strength of the dollar in for
eign exchange.
Current accounting rules —
for which changes have been
proposed — require such com
panies to adjust their earnings
for currency changes whether
gains and losses are actually re
alized or not.
In reporting its results Friday,
Merck said foreign exchange
charges reduced its earnings by
25 percent, or $27.60 million.
Analysts point out that these
companies' reported numbers
could quickly improve if the
dollar stabilizes or weakens, or
if the accounting rules are
modified.
