# Democrats in strategy battle
## 
### Washington Post 
Baltimore â€” Warned by one of their leading
economic advisers that President Ronald Rea
gan's program could look pretty good at elec
tion time next year, top officials of the Demo
cratic Party struggled Saturday to find new poli
cies that could fuel a political comeback.
Along the way, they stumbled into some of
their old divisions over busing, welfare and af
firmative action, as New York Mayor Edward
Koch provoked angry responses from black of
ficials and some liberals to his barbed attacks on
those programs.
The first meeting of the Democratic National
Strategy Council of federal, state and local
elected officials produced no clear consensus
on an alternative to Reaganomics.
While former vice president Walter Mondale
said Reagan's mixture of tax cuts and budget re
ductions is "crazy" and won't work, Walter
Heller, former chairman of the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers, said that might not be at all ob
vious a year from now.
Heller said the president's economic program
is laden with contradictions, but warned the
Democrats "not to delude ourselves into think
ing Reaganomics will self-destruct politically."
On the contrary, he said, by next fall, Reagan
"might make a plausible case" for success. At
that time, he predicted, taxes will be down 15
percent, interest rates will be reduced "substan
tially," inflation will be lowered by 30 or 40 per
cent and the economy will be on the way back
up from the slump that is now under way.
"I conclude," said Rep. Gillis Long (D-La.),
"that you think we may be running next year
when the American people think it's a great suc
cess?"
"It could be made to look pretty good," Heller
said, adding that most of the costs of the Reagan
program should be more obvious by 1984.
Mondale told a news conference later that if
the economy prospers the Democrats will fight
the 1982 campaign "on other issues. This party
cannot appear to want to win off the heartache
of the American people," he said.
Mondale was the final speaker at a two-hour
session Saturday morning, when most of the 55
Democratic officials offered their own, widely
disparate prescriptions for the future.
He said he found consensus on the im
portance of economic growth, social justice, en
vironmental protection, energy self-sufficiency,

strong defense and control of nuclear weapons.
Those same themes were emphasized in party
chairman Charles Manatt's closing statement,
which promised that task forces of the 100-mem
ber council would provide "new strategies for
hope" to replace the Republicans' "old ideas."
The faint outline of a possible Democrat!'" ec
onomic alternative appeared in the afterr oon
discussion, led by Reps. Timothy Wirth of C ilo
rado and Richard Gebhardt of Missouri. It en
visages increased investment in education, e
search and technology, targeted tax cuts and
much more direct involvement of government
with business and labor in shaping long-term in
vestment decisions.
California Gov. Jerry Brown, promoting a simi
lar approach, said the policies of Franklin Roo
sevelt could serve the Democrats as a guide.
"The creation of private wealth is inextricably
linked to public investment," he said, "and the
Reagan program ignores that fundamental fact.
But even as vaguely described, the new eco
nomics drew expressions of misgivings from
Democrats as diverse as Detroit Mayor Coleman
Young and Miami Congressman Dante Facell.
Both said the Democrats might wind up repre
senting only the losing constituencies and re
gions in the kind of economic transition such a
plan would speed.
Comments in the six hours of round tables
that began Friday night showed how far the
Democrats are from agreement on any of the
major issues facing the country. Most of the de
bate was polite in tone, but Koch stirred an angry
reaction with his remarks.
The New York mayor, who has been nomi
nated by both the Democrats and the Re
publicans for re-election next month, said too
many federal programs had been run "ass
backwards," and asserted that Democrats were
defeated last year "because we were out of step
with the country" on such issues as busing, wel
fare and job quotas.
State Sen. Clarence Mitchell of Baltimore,
shouting his response, said that if the Democrats
try to "out-conservative the conservatives, then
the Democratic Party is doomed."
Outside the hall, Koch had a roughly worded
exchange with Rep. Charles Rangle of New
York, who told him he should not offer himself
"as an example to the national party when you
lost all the Hispanic and black precincts" in the
recent New York Democratic primary.
