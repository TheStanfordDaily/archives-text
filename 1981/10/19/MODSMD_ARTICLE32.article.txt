# California's schools now seen wearing 'Nation's dunce cap'
## 
### Washington Post 
Los Angeles — Once hailed as among the
most successful public school systems in the
country, with firm tax support and high-scor
ing graduates, California's high schools have
fallen into a serious slump.
The tax-cutting fervor that climaxed with
the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 is being
blamed, in part, for a sharp drop in California
seniors' test scores and lack of preparation
for college when compared with seniors in
other states. But there are other factors as
well: an increase in the number of students
taking "lifestyle" instead of more traditional
academic courses, a lessening of require
ments for high school graduation, and a ten
dency of some high school students to take
life easy and to denigrate careers and hard
work.
"California now finds itself in the uncom
fortable position of wearing a national
dunce cap," said the state board of educa
tion president, Ann Leavenworth. Although
many factors seem to have influenced the
decline, most attention is being focused on
the school-spending limits imposed by Prop
osition 13, part of a tax-cutting mood that

continues to sweep the country. Critics of
the school system cite these developments:
— In the past six years, California has
slipped from 12th to 49th place, just ahead of
Nevada, in the percentage of personal in
come spent on public schools, according to
the National Education Association. Several
high schools have shortened their school
day and elmininated many of their advanced
courses.
— California high school seniors' reading
and language scores have dropped in the last
decade from about midpoint to the bottom
third of a national percentile scale.
— A College Board survey of California
students in the top third of their high school
classes showed them taking significantly
fewer math courses than such students in
other states. Equivalent gaps were found in
other subjects.
— Stanford University, one of the state's
premier private colleges, reported a four
point drop in just one year in the percentage
of California applicants meeting its entrance
requirements, while the proportion of quali
fied out-of-state applicaats remained steady.
California officials say they see no im

mediate relief from the budget cuts, particu
larly since a state surplus that had cushioned
the Proposition 13 tax cuts now has been
spent. The most important impact of the cuts
may be on teachers, they say. The cuts have
affected the quality of instruction by increas
ing class size, limiting special projects, reduc
ing pay raises and leaving the best teachers
feeling "battered and tired," said Don Hill, a
high school teacher and member of the
elementary school board in San Mateo.
Art, music and sports have borne the brunt
of the cuts, said Reno Lorenz, vice principal
of Los Angeles' Chatsworth High School,
which has cut the school day for juniors and
seniors from six to five periods. "But the sol
id courses are going to be more restricted
also. Higher level courses are seldom given
and if there is a conflict, the kid loses out,"
he said.
Student test scores, in a state always at the
forefront of educational innovation, have
also appeared to suffer from the advent of
new, more "relevant" courses introduced in
high schools during the late 1960s and early
'70s. Seniors interviewed at South Pasadena
High School, where most of them take only a

half-load because of new rules, said students
gravitate toward one of the new courses,
"human physiology," as an easy way to meet
the science requirement without wrestling
with chemistry.
The University of California, with cam
puses throughout the state, has encouraged
this attitude by admitting freshmen strictly
on the basis of grade points without noting
the difficulty of the courses taken.
Robert Keavney, now enrolled at UCLA,
remembers having a heated argument with
his father, a high school principal, when he
decided to join many of his friends in taking
a light load his senior year. His senior year at
Arcadia High School consisted of one dif
ficult English course, plus three courses in
cluding physical education and office
monitor which demanded little or no work.
His father wanted him to take a fourth year of
mathematics, but Keavney was concerned
about maintaining the 3.6 grade average
which insured his admission to the univer
sity. "I didn't see any point in taking a hard
course and getting a bad grade," he said.
The shock of life at UCLA, however, was
considerable, and at age 22 he is still two

years from graduation. He said he realized
too late "that the grading in high school was
unbelievably easy." Looking back now, he
said, "it never seemed that there was any
homework."
Although the number of hispanic stu
dents, with their problems coping with eng
lish-language instruction may be part of the
problem, national surveys also show a de
cline in the rigor and number of courses
being taken by California students, even
those in the top third of the class who plan to
go to college.
According to a survey of more than a mil
lion high school students who took last
year's Scholastic Aptitude Test, 65 percent of
college-bound senior males take at least two
years of physical science, but in California
that figure is 50 percent. For females, it is 50
percent nationally but 30 percent in Califor
nia. The national average for males taking at
least four years of mathematics is 67 percent,
but in California 57 percent. For females it is
51 percent nationally but 38 percent in Cali
fornia.

those in the top third of the class who plan to
go to college.
According to a survey of more than a mil
lion high school students who took last
year's Scholastic Aptitude Test, 65 percent of
college-bound senior males take at least two
years of physical science, but in California
that figure is 50 percent. For females, it is 50
percent nationally but 30 percent in Califor
nia. The national average for males taking at
least four years of mathematics is 67 percent,
but in California 57 percent. For females it is
51 percent nationally but 38 percent in Cali
fornia.
Los Angeles — Once hailed as among the
most successful public school systems in the
country, with firm tax support and high-scor
ing graduates, California's high schools have
fallen into a serious slump.
The tax-cutting fervor that climaxed with
the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 is being
blamed, in part, for a sharp drop in California
seniors' test scores and lack of preparation
for college when compared with seniors in
other states. But there are other factors as
well: an increase in the number of students
taking "lifestyle" instead of more traditional
academic courses, a lessening of require
ments for high school graduation, and a ten
dency of some high school students to take
life easy and to denigrate careers and hard
work.
"California now finds itself in the uncom
fortable position of wearing a national
dunce cap," said the state board of educa
tion president, Ann Leavenworth. Although
many factors seem to have influenced the
decline, most attention is being focused on
the school-spending limits imposed by Prop
osition 13, part of a tax-cutting mood that

continues to sweep the country. Critics of
the school system cite these developments:
— In the past six years, California has
slipped from 12th to 49th place, just ahead of
Nevada, in the percentage of personal in
come spent on public schools, according to
the National Education Association. Several
high schools have shortened their school
day and elmininated many of their advanced
courses.
— California high school seniors' reading
and language scores have dropped in the last
decade from about midpoint to the bottom
third of a national percentile scale.
— A College Board survey of California
students in the top third of their high school
classes showed them taking significantly
fewer math courses than such students in
other states. Equivalent gaps were found in
other subjects.
— Stanford University, one of the state's
premier private colleges, reported a four
point drop in just one year in the percentage
of California applicants meeting its entrance
requirements, while the proportion of quali
fied out-of-state applicaats remained steady.
California officials say they see no im

mediate relief from the budget cuts, particu
larly since a state surplus that had cushioned
the Proposition 13 tax cuts now has been
spent. The most important impact of the cuts
may be on teachers, they say. The cuts have
affected the quality of instruction by increas
ing class size, limiting special projects, reduc
ing pay raises and leaving the best teachers
feeling "battered and tired," said Don Hill, a
high school teacher and member of the
elementary school board in San Mateo.
Art, music and sports have borne the brunt
of the cuts, said Reno Lorenz, vice principal
of Los Angeles' Chatsworth High School,
which has cut the school day for juniors and
seniors from six to five periods. "But the sol
id courses are going to be more restricted
also. Higher level courses are seldom given
and if there is a conflict, the kid loses out,"
he said.
Student test scores, in a state always at the
forefront of educational innovation, have
also appeared to suffer from the advent of
new, more "relevant" courses introduced in
high schools during the late 1960s and early
'70s. Seniors interviewed at South Pasadena
High School, where most of them take only a

half-load because of new rules, said students
gravitate toward one of the new courses,
"human physiology," as an easy way to meet
the science requirement without wrestling
with chemistry.
The University of California, with cam
puses throughout the state, has encouraged
this attitude by admitting freshmen strictly
on the basis of grade points without noting
the difficulty of the courses taken.
Robert Keavney, now enrolled at UCLA,
remembers having a heated argument with
his father, a high school principal, when he
decided to join many of his friends in taking
a light load his senior year. His senior year at
Arcadia High School consisted of one dif
ficult English course, plus three courses in
cluding physical education and office
monitor which demanded little or no work.
His father wanted him to take a fourth year of
mathematics, but Keavney was concerned
about maintaining the 3.6 grade average
which insured his admission to the univer
sity. "I didn't see any point in taking a hard
course and getting a bad grade," he said.
The shock of life at UCLA, however, was
considerable, and at age 22 he is still two

years from graduation. He said he realized
too late "that the grading in high school was
unbelievably easy." Looking back now, he
said, "it never seemed that there was any
homework."
Although the number of hispanic stu
dents, with their problems coping with eng
lish-language instruction may be part of the
problem, national surveys also show a de
cline in the rigor and number of courses
being taken by California students, even
those in the top third of the class who plan to
