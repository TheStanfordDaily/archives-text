## Trials and tribulations in Southland 1-5 Cardinals can't catch Trojans, lose again 25-17 
### Sally Jenkins 
Ear away across an expanse of rolling hills, lies a king
dom called the Coliseum. That domain is ruled by a peo
ple called Trojans, and they protect their quaint dwelling
with vehemence.
The Stanford football team ventured into that strong
hold Saturday — into the land of gleaming helmets and
the goose step, the land of Clearasil and LaCoste shirts
where the roars of the crowd are unnerving in their mag
nitude — and proved that barring flukes, it is impossible
to win in the Coliseum
In a game marked by sloppiness on both sides and
plagued with penalties, the Cardinals werealmost humil
iated. Only a fourth quarter two-touchdown burst and a
remarkable statistic — Heisman Trophy candidate
Marcus Allen was held to 153 yards rushing, whereas he
had been averaging 227 per game previously — made the
25-17 final score as close as it appears.
But for awhile the Trojans seemed just as ready to be
taken by Stanford as they were by the University of Ari
zona last weekend, 13-10. They were penalized 13 times

for 129 yards, and scored only 3 points in the second half
after racking up 22 quick ones in the first.
After a dismal three quarters offensively that yielded
only a Mark Harmon 28-yard field goal in the second
quarter, the Cardinals finally got their aerial game un
derway and went 80 yards in 8 plays for a touchdown late
in the fourth quarter. On a drive coaxed along by a 15-
yard personal foul penalty on USC, John Elway threw to
tight end Chris Dressel for 13 yards, halfback Darrin
Nelson ran for 7, and Elway threw again to flanker Emile
Harry for 13 yards and a first down to move the Cardinals
to the Trojan 26 yatdline.
On first down Elway went back to pass again, and un
der pressure from the Trojan defensive line, was forced
to scramble. His foot race in the backfield broke the play
open and gave flanker Mike Tolliver enough time to get
open in the left corner of the end zone, and Elway drilled
it to him for the touchdown.
Moments later Elway found Dressel in the opposite
corner of the end zone for a two-point conversion, and
suddenly the Cardinals were not as far out of things as

the Trojans would have liked.
The Cardinal defense, led by tackles Doug Rogers and
John Bergren, and inside linebacker Dave Morze, held
the Trojans, i.e. Marcus Allen and his magical offensive
line, and forced them to punt with6:o9 remainingon the
clock. Elway then began a relentless passing attack in
what was perhaps the most difficult drive of the season
for the Cards.
The offense went 80 yards in 18 plays for the touch
down, converting on two fourth down attempts along
the way. Passes to split end Don Lonsinger and fullback
Mike Dotterer moved the Cards to the Trojan 44 yard
line before the drive stalled. Elway was thrown for a 5-
yard loss by defensive tackle Dennis Edwards who almost
single-handedly ruined the game for him, and the Cards
faced a fourth-and-15 situation. Under pressure yet
again, Elway found Lonsinger across the middle for 17
yards, giving them a first down on the 27 yard line.
Completions to Dressel and White for 10 and 8 yards
respectively put the Cards on the 9 before the drive

stalled again. On fourth-and-4 Elway was pursued by Ed
wards again, who forced him to go around the right end.
Two yards short of the first down when he was hit by Ed
wards, Elway decided to fumble the ball since it was
fourth down anyway. What he did was fumble the ball
forward to the 3 and out of bounds for a first down in a
play that Stanford head coach Paul Wiggin called
"brilliant."
On the very next play Elway hit Tolliver again in the
end zone on a three- yard pass. A two-point conversion
play intended for Harry failed, asdid the ensuing onside
kick attempt, and the Trojans ran out the clock.
The first half was thoroughly dominated by the Tro
jans, the Trojans, and the Trojans again as they capital
ized on Cardinal mistakes. Quarterback John Mazur
demonstrated a surprisingly efficient throwing game as
the Cardinal front line unravelled the mystery of Marcus
Allen. Forced into throwing situations when Allen was
repeatedly stopped short on second down situations,
Mazur connected with split end Jeff Simmonscontinual
ly, and eventually began to go the air even on first down.


HOLD ON TIGHT, IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT — Junior
flanker Mike Tolliver, who caught four passes Saturday
for 60 yards, has become the mainstay of the Stanford re-
