# Expos, LA rained out, play today

### 
Montreal (AP) â€” There was
rain in Montreal yesterday, but
few tears.
Postponment of the decid
ing game in the National
league Championship Series
between the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the Expos
brought no requiem.
Though meddlesome in the
plans for the World Series,
which is scheduled to start
tomorow night in New York,
the delay actually gave both
starting pitchers a welcomed
extra day of rest.
Both Ray Burris of Montreal
and Fernando Valenzuela of
Los Angeles would have been
pitching on three days rest.
Now they will have four days.
"It just gives me an added
day of strength," said Burris,

"so that's encouraging for
me."
"Any time a pitcher gets an
extra clay's Dodger
Manager Tom Lasorda, "that's
got to be good."
The weather brought a 3-
hour, 25-minute delay before
the game was called, and dur
ing the delay both Valenzuela
and Burris warmed up.
"I didn't go full strength,"
said Burris, who outdueled
Valenzuela in the second game
of this five-game series, win
ning 3-0.
Burris said each pitcher han
dles his preparation differently
for a big game.
"I thought about my wife
and kid, what they were doing.
I took it easy and answered
some fan mail," he said.

Burris also spent time in the
locker room during the delay
reading Psalms from the bible.
He said he was not nervous.
"How can I get nervous?
There's nothing I can do about
it. Its in God's hands," Burris
said.
Catcher Mike Scioscia said
Valenzuela, who speaks no
English, wasn't bothered by the
waiting either.
"I don't really think it af
fected him at all," said Scioscia,
who said he's seen a big change
in the 20-year-old Mexican
since the start of the year.
"He's opened up. He's more
sure of himself. He plays little
practical jokes on people," he
said. "I can't think now what
they are but they're small kinds
of things that make you know

he feels good."
1 he Expos got another bene
fit from the rain.
Pitcher Steve Rogers, who
was available for bullpen duty
yesterday after winning Friday
night's game, will be even
more ready to bail out Burris if
that should be necessary. Ace
reliever Jeff Reardon has been
injured and his status remains
uncertain.
Montreal Manager Jim Fan
ning says Reardon is 100 per
cent. Reardon says he's OK,
but he hasn't pitched since the
Expos returned home. And the
additon of Rogers in the
bullpen could be a major ad
vantage.
"It's kind of exciting to think
you might be involved," said
Rogers.
