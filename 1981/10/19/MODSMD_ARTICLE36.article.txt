# The 						fourth quarter kids

### Mike Oneal 
It's become a rather com
mon sentiment around the Bay
Area that there is something
wrong with the Stanford of
fense. It lacks its usual zip and
flow.
It might not have been so
disquieting to watch the Cards
drop five of their last six games
if they hadn't been dropping
passes and opportunities as
well. Stanford's football team
hasn't been connecting on the
big plays this year and instead
of exploding down the field, it
bulls its way — or it doesn't
move at all.
Until the fourth quarter.
In five of the six contests this
season, those against Purdue,
Ohio State, Arizona, UCLA and
USC, Stanford has fussed
around for the first three quar
ters of the game only to start its
comeback in the fourth. In
each of those games, with the
possible exception of UCLA,
Stanford was spared humil
iation by a late, go for broke
surge, when strategy and game
plan were thrown out in favor
of an almost nostalgic taste of
scramble and pass.
Stanford
< 5 for 36 yards pass
ing in the first half Saturday but
finished the game 23-45 for 235
yard*. The Cards scored three
points over the first three quar
ters but tallied 14 in the last.
The problem is that these
fourth quarter blasts haven't
been enough to win games.
Though they show character
unestablished earlier in the
game, they still aren't brilliant.
Elway's controversial fumble
which set up the Cards' final
touchdown late in the game
Saturday was a stroke of genius

but a drastic, emergency meas
ure. As Chris Baker said in the
Los Angeles Times yesterday
"Here's the script: Stanford
plays poorly in the first half,
falling behind, then rallies in
thesecond half — only tocome
up short."
Offensive coordinator Jim
Fassel said it another way.
"In the first half we showed
an inability to throw and catch
the ball. In the fourth quarter
we found the groove. We
didn't do anything that dif
ferent, we just started playing
better," Fassel said.
That "groove" has become
an elusive quantity — nobody
seems to know where it comes
from. Most agree, though, that
it has something to do with a
young team's penchant to start
out slowly.
"I think it takes us a while to
get going," said split end Don
Lonsinger, who, as a junior, is
getting his first real playing
time this year. "We're not ex
ecuting like we should. It being
our (a number of the receivers)
first year, that's part of it."
The Cardinal passing attack
undoubtedly suffers from the
loss of Ken Margerum (who
graduated last year and now
plays for the Chicago Bears)
and more importantly from the
loss of All-Pac-10 receiver An
dre Tyler who has been missing
due to a broken foot. The Card
receiving corps shows poten
tial but it is clearly not as re
liable (six dropped passes Sat
urday) as the one Elway passed
to last year.
"The explosiveness and
potential are there," Tyler said,
"but for all these guys there's
going to be a year of learning."
Fassel agreed.

"Elway puts real zip on the
ball," he said, "and if you're
concentrating so hard on
trying to get open, and the ball
is not right on, it's hard to
catch."
The lack of a consistent pass
ing attack effects the Stanford
attack in general. Elway over
threw a number of balls in the
first half againsttheTrojansand
his lack of confidence diffused
throughout the squad.
Without the passing game, the
Cards don't click as well — they
hold back — and that's just
what the aggressive Stanford
concept cannot afford.
"The pass blocking was
fine," Elway said, "but I was
aiming the ball at first and I was
tentative. It was my fault in the
first half. If I had completed
those passes (those over
thrown) I don't know what
would have happened."
Tyler said he feels the fourth
quarter surges stem from a
"nothing to lose" attitude.
"We say, 'we gotta play like this
because if we don't, its gonna
be over.' That's been our trait
all year."
And if Stanford doesn't de
cide to pull it all together and
play a complete offense to
compliment its defense, the
season will be over.
Trojan coach john Robinson,
at least, sees some light for
Stanford.
"It's obviously premature to
judge a team the way things are
in college football." Robinson
said. "Stanford is a fine team
and can win the last five games.
It's the survivor that makes it.
Look at Oakland last year. They
just kept playing, and ended up
in the Super Bowl."
