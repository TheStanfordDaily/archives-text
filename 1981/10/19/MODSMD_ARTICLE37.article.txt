## 
### Lisa Stern 
"They are capable of playing
as well as any team in the coun
try on any given night,"
assessed Stanford head coach
Fred Sturm.
And indeed, the University
of the Pacific volleyball squad
lived up to its reputation last
Friday nightastheTigers tamed
Stanford in four games, 12-15,
15-11, 15-5 and 15-7 in Maples

Pavillion.
The Cardinals partially made
up for the loss yesterday in
non-conference play by beat
ing Cal-State Long Beach in
four games, but the loss
dropped the Cards' overall rec
ord to 18-9 and left the team
with a 2-1 mark in Northern
California Athletic Conference
competition.
Stanford's most impressive
play against Pacific came in the
first game of the match. UOP
jumped out into the domi
nating role, leading through
out the early and middle stages
of the game, 4-1, 7-2 and 11-4.
Then the Cards, trailing 12-7,
brought Brandace Hope off the

bench and she served for eight
straight points to give the Stan
ford spikers the 15-12 victory.
The Cards came out spiking
in game two, taking advantage
of Pacific's inconsistent service
game, and lead 6-3 early. The
Tigers steadied out the match
at 8-8, however, before pulling
ahead 10-8. Stanford did man
age to tie the score at 10, but
UOP came right back to post
five winning points and dead
lock the match score at 1-1.
The Tigers never looked
back.
In the next game, UOP
freshman Jan Saunders served
for eight consecutive points to
give the Stockton spikers a
commanding lead from which
Stanford never fully recovered.
The Cards picked up only
five points as they lost the
critical third game of the match
5-15 and game four also
belonged to Pacific which
quickly mounted a 7-1 advan
tage and held off a Cardinal
comeback attempt to win the
final contest 15-7.
The UOP squad, undefeated
in its last 27 NorCal matches, is
now 4-0 in conference play this
season. Stanford hasn't beaten
head coach Terry Liskevych's
Tigers in conference competi
tion for three years. Last fall,
Pacific, the defending NorCal
champion, was runner-up in
the AIAW post-season tour
nament.
Cardinal blockers Deanna
Boyette and Jan ( Linden looked
impressive for Stanford in the
defeat, while senior middle

blocker Jayne Gibson stole the
show for Pacific. Freshman Lin
da Vaughn also stood out for
UOP with service aces which
enabled the Tigers to pull
ahead in both games one and
three.
Sturm saidthe UOPsquad re
lied mainly on their outstand
ing talent in the match.
"They are a well-disciplined
team, especially in defense and
blocking," Sturm said, adding,
"The UOP team is just purely
superior in athletic ability.
Stanford turned itself around
yesterday, though, blasting the
Cal-State Long Beach team in
four games 15-0, 15-6, 12-15
and 15-9.
Sturm said it was the best
match the Cards have played in
three weeks pointing out that
"We played well for three
games which is what we didn't
do against UOP. We just played
better for longer."
