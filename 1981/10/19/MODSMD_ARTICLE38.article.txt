# Card poloists clean up down South despite Trojan trickery
## 
### Chris Addington 
A good team can handle any opposition and
any playing conditions and the Stanford water
polo team is certainly no exception.
When Stanford arrived at the Belmont Plaza
on the University of California campus Friday
night, they had a surprise waiting: USC was not
there.
In addition to being empty of players, the nor
mally 30-meter pool at Belmont had also been
shortened to only 25 yards.
USC, in a subtle tribute to the awsome power
of the Cardinals, had deciced to stall for as long
as possible in an attempt to destroy the mental
attitude of Stanford's team.
With only 10 minutes to go before the referee
called the match a forfeit, the Trojans crept out
of their hiding place and slipped into the pool.
Stanford was given the ball without a sprint in re
ward for showing up on time and Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti decided to turn the tide on
USC by calling a time out to settle things down.
"It was obvious what they were trying to do,"
Dettamanti said. "Our fast break is our chief
weapon and by shortening the pool they tried to
take that away. We've never played short course
in the Plaza and the USC head coach tried to tell
me it was totally normal."
When the game finallly started, USC had one
more trick in its bag. The Trojans ran a game plan
reminiscent of Stone Age water polo. They only
penetrated with three players leaving the rest
back by their own goal as a further hindrance to
the Cardinal fast break.
The Cardinals just smiled and blasted USC

right out of the pool.
Stanford got off to a slow start as it adjusted to
the unorthodox style of play, but things picked
up and the Cards led 7-3 at the half and 10-4 at
the end of the third period. Even the Stanford
bench got in on the act as they outscored So. Cal.
3-1 in the last quarter to make it 13-5 when the
buzzer sounded.
Stanford connected on five-of-eight man-up
situations and thanks to the sit-on-the-ball-and
pray offense of USC, they had only two ejections
called against them. The Cards had eight players
break into the scoring column, headed by Jamie
Bergeson with four.
Stanford showed up in Westwood the next
morning ready for anything but UCLA decided
to play by the book. Perhaps in retrospect the
Bruins wished they had tried a little trickery of
their own.
Playing its finest first quarter ball of the year,
Stanford rocketed to a 5-0 early lead. The Cards
tallied two more before UCLA could recover
late in the second period.
The last half of the game resembled an amuse
ment park shooting gallery. With a comfortable
nine goal lead, Dettamanti decided to give the
starters a break. Shots flew from everywhere at
both goals and when the smoke cleared, the
final score stood at 18-12 in favor of Stanford.
"I was a little disappointed in the play of my
second unit," Dettamanti said, "But it was un
derstandable with such a large lead."
Stanford had 10 players break into the scoring
with Alan Mouchawar's four goals heading the
list. The Cardinals also connected on an in
credible six out of seven man-up situations.

Stanford was given the ball without a sprint in re
ward for showing up on time and Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti decided to turn the tide on
USC by calling a time out to settle things down.
"It was obvious what they were trying to do,"
Dettamanti said. "Our fast break is our chief
weapon and by shortening the pool they tried to
take that away. We've never played short course
in the Plaza and the USC head coach tried to tell
me it was totally normal."
When the game finallly started, USC had one
more trick in its bag. The Trojans ran a game plan
reminiscent of Stone Age water polo. They only
penetrated with three players leaving the rest
back by their own goal as a further hindrance to
the Cardinal fast break.
The Cardinals just smiled and blasted USC

right out of the pool.
Stanford got off to a slow start as it adjusted to
the unorthodox style of play, but things picked
up and the Cards led 7-3 at the half and 10-4 at
the end of the third period. Even the Stanford
bench got in on the act as they outscored So. Cal.
3-1 in the last quarter to make it 13-5 when the
buzzer sounded.
Stanford connected on five-of-eight man-up
situations and thanks to the sit-on-the-ball-and
pray offense of USC, they had only two ejections
called against them. The Cards had eight players
break into the scoring column, headed by Jamie
Bergeson with four.
Stanford showed up in Westwood the next
morning ready for anything but UCLA decided
to play by the book. Perhaps in retrospect the
Bruins wished they had tried a little trickery of
their own.
Playing its finest first quarter ball of the year,
Stanford rocketed to a 5-0 early lead. The Cards
tallied two more before UCLA could recover
late in the second period.
The last half of the game resembled an amuse
ment park shooting gallery. With a comfortable
nine goal lead, Dettamanti decided to give the
starters a break. Shots flew from everywhere at
both goals and when the smoke cleared, the
final score stood at 18-12 in favor of Stanford.
"I was a little disappointed in the play of my
second unit," Dettamanti said, "But it was un
derstandable with such a large lead."
Stanford had 10 players break into the scoring
with Alan Mouchawar's four goals heading the
list. The Cardinals also connected on an in
credible six out of seven man-up situations.
