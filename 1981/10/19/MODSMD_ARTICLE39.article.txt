# Pate plasters Pensacola

Pensacola, Fla. (AP) â€”
Jerry Pate shot a front-run
ning, 1-under-par 71 fora 3-
stroke victory yesterday in
the Pensacola Open and
Tom Kite ended Tom
Watson's four-year reign as
pro golf's leading money
winner.
Pate, of Pensacola, led
throughout the final 18
holes over the 7,133-yard
Perdido Bay Club course
and scored his second vic
tory of the season with a 271
total, 16 shots under par.
Pate, who won the U.S.
Open in his rookie season of
1976, collected $36,000 from
the total purse of $200,000,
boosting his year's earnings
to $279,662 with the season
now complete.
Although it was much
smaller, the $11,600 check
picked up by Kite almost
certainly was even more
welcome. It made him the

year's leading money-win
ner with a final total of
$375,699, ending Watson's
four-yearstreak at the top of
the money standings.
Kite, who had to make an
eagle-2 in Friday's round to
qualify for the final 36 holes,
finished with a 69 in the chil
ly, windy weather and a tie
for third at 275 with rookie
Fred Couples.
Steve Melnyk, with a clos
ing 70, was second behind
Pate in the golf tournament
with a 274 total.
Bruce Lietzke, George
Cadle and Howard Twitty
were next at 276. Twitty and
Lietzke had closing 70's, Ca
dle 71.
None of them really were
able to put any pressure on
Pate. He opened the day's
play with a 4-shot lead and
wasn't really threatened.
Melnyk once pulled to
within 2 strokes, but Pate

birdied the 15th and 16th
and had it locked up.
Watson also failed in his
last-gasp attempt to win a
fifth consecutive Player-of
the-Year title. He had to win
here to do it, and, with a
pace-setting 64 in the first
round, appeared primed
and readytodo just that. But
he followed with rounds of
76,69 and 70 and finished far
back in the pack at 281.
So, with the official sea
son complete, that distinc
tion went to Bill Rogers,
who did not compete here.
Rogers won the British
Open, the World Series of
Golf, the Heritage Classic
and the Texas Open.
Kite, who finished the
season with an incredible
stringof 17 finishes of eighth
or better in his last 18 starts,
also won the coveted
Vardon Trophy with a stroke
average of 69.80.
