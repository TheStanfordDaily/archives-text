# EPA cityhood moves closer
## 
### Dan McMillan 
The Local Agency Formation Com
mission (LAFCo) of San Mateo Coun
ty has approved East Palo Alto's peti
tion for cityhood. After a 10-hour
marathon session Thursday night
LAFCo voted 3-2 to incorporate all of
East Palo Alto, except for the land
west of the Bayshore Freeway and
north of Euclid and Manhatten Ave
nues, nicknamed the "island" by
commissioners.
The commission says it wants
Menlo Park to annex the "island."
Annexation, however, is extremely
unlikely: the Menlo Park City Coun
cil has already refused to take any
part of East Palo Alto.
According to commissioner Arlen
Gregorio, "This area has a communi
ty of interest with Menlo Park. Peo
ple living there identify with Menlo
Park and look to that city for ser
vices."

Dianne Otterby, who lives in the
"island" and opposes annexation,
said "they (LAFCo) wanted a safe
compromise."
Nearly 30 people addressed the
commission, including consultants,
lawyers, representatives of citizens'
groups, and private individuals.
Ruben Abrica, speaking for the
West of Bayshore Rentersand Home
owners Association, said "the majori
ty of (East Palo Alto residents) west of
Bayshore support incorporation of
all of East Palo Alto." He said the as
sumption that people west of
Bayshore want to join Menlo Park is
the view of property owners, and
hardly representative of an area
where 92 percent of all housing units
are rented.
Consultants James Smith and
Gerald Udinsky, hired by the Menlo
Park Annexation Committee, told
the commission that incorporation is

not economically feasible. They
sharply criticized the report of LAF-
Co's consultant, Angus McDonald,
who supports incorporation.
McDonald said that "in view of
how little time these economists
have had to study the facts, I will try
not to be overly hard on them." He
went on to dismiss each of Odinsky's
and Smith's comments as either out
right false or based on unorthodox
analytical methods.
According to Asst. County Man
ager Jay Gellert, "the (County) Board
of Supervisors has not done a good
job of running East Palo Alto" and
will not be able to maintain the exist
ing level of services there. Gellert ex
plained that although the Reagan ad
ministration has cut federal money
for state welfare and health pro
grams, local laws forbid cutting
payments. As a result, he said, the
county will have to cut other pro
grams instead, including services it
now provides in East Palo Alto.
Berkeley Driessel, vice chairman of
the East Palo Alto Municipal Council,
echoed the sentiments of many
speakers with his remarks. In
corporation, he said, would grant the
residents "the simple right to vote on
what concerns the very essence of
their lives."
Although disappointed that LAFCo

excluded the "island" from in
corporation, most East Palo Alto
cityhood supporters said they were
pleased at the decision. "We're sorry
about the section north of Euclid,"
said Abrica, "but this is still an impor
tant victory."
The County Board of Supervisors
must approve incorporation before
East Palo Alto residents can vote on
the issue. If LAFCo and the board
hold themselves to a strict schedule
in the coming months, incorporation
will make the April 1982 ballot.
