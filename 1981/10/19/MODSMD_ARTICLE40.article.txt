# Rain, ratings and the Big O roof
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Montreal — The National
League playoffs were already
featuring subdued TV ratings
and the attendance could have
been higher and yesterday, just
when all the excitement on the
field was about to crescendo,
bad weather hit too.
Rain fell through the late af
ternoon and early evening and
at 7:36 p.m. EDT, more than
three hours after the sched
uled start of Game 5 which
would decide if it was the
Dodgers or Expos who'd be

going to the World Series, it
was postponed until 10:05 this
morning. And this morning, for
the first time this fall, there is
snow in the local weather fore
cast.
You could say yesterday's
cancellation had been un
avoidable, except for the fol
lowing:
—A Montreal weatherman
said the rain was stopping yes
terday evening and he thought
they could have played.
—National League president
Chub Feeney conceded they
probably could already have
gotten the game in if they'd
started it in the early afternoon,
which is when baseball games
used to be started, except that
the network — NBC in this case
— wanted to put on a little NFL
first.
"We agreed to it," Feeney
said. "They wanted to lead in
with football games. We had
no objection, it gives you bet
ter ratings. Now you can use

that."
—There is also the matter of
the roof that was supposed to
be erected over Stade Olym
pique, which was one reason
the league ventured into a city
this far north 13 years ago.
This was before the stadium
started settling into the soil of
La Belle Province, and the de
sign of the tower was suspected
of being incapable of support
ing the weight of a dome, and
the whole complex was found
to have been built at the price
of one of the most impressive
cost overruns in the history of
Western civilization. The com
plex, consisting of the stadium,
a swimming pool and a
velodrome, cost $600 million,
which is one reason no one in
Montreal is holding his breath
until more money is allocated
for a roof. The roof is now sit
ting in Le Havre, France, too far
away to be of any use for to-

day's game.
"The roof was supposed to
be on five, six years ago,"
Feeney said at his post rainout
press conference. "They're still
working on it. Sometimes these
thingstakesometime. I assume
there'll be a roof in the next
couple of years."
. , ii ■ .1
Aside from that, the rainout
was fairly inevitable, so
50 players shrugged and went
home. The Dodgers who'd
checked out of their hotel for
the second day in a row,
checked back in for the second
day in a row.
The stadium was only about
half full at 4:05, the scheduled
starting time of Game 5, but the
tarp was out and the players
were holed up. Burris spent the
time reading the Bible.
Valenzuela laid around the
training room, and not one of
his teammates worried about
how he was taking all this un
bearable pressure, 20 years old
or no 20 years old.
