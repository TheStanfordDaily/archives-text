# SF keeps winning, Oakland starts

Milwaukee (AP) — Surprising San
Francisco had been averaging nearly 27
points per game, but Coach Bill Walsh
credited the pass rush for the 49ers' 13-3
National Football League victory over the
Green Bay Packers yesterday.
"They couldn't cope with our pass
rush," said Walsh, whose 49ers are 5-2 with
a 4-game winning streak. "Fred Dean's
rush and the young guys made the dif
ference. Our defense has done the job.
They can control the game for us."
Joe Montana passed for 210 yards for the
49ers, setting up a 1-yard plunge by Johnny
Davis for the go-ahead touchdown and 2
field goals by Ray Wersching. Defensive
ends Dean and Lawrence Pillers protected
the 49ers' lead with 4 quarterback sacks, 3
of them by Pillers.
Pillers said he was free to rush because
the Packers' often double-teamed Dean, a
former all-pro signed by the 49ers two
weeks ago.
"They double-teamed Fred with a tackle
and a back, and I was able to beat the
guard," Pillers said. "We knew they had
troubles at tackle, so we exploited their
weaknesses."
Coach Bart Starr, whose Packers slipped
to 2-5, agreed that the 49ers' pass rush was
the key.
"Very much so," Starr said. "We simply
didn't have the time needed. When you
have to keep a back in to help block, it ob

viously limits the things you can do."
Oakland (AP) — The Oakland Raiders
finally won, breaking a three-week scoring
drought, and they did it with flair.
"We brought back some of the Raiders'
tradition, coming from behind and win
ning in the final minutes. That's impor
tant," said Coach Tom Flores.
The Super Bowl champions snapped out
of their offensive rut to beat the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers 18-16 yesterday on Chris
Bahr's 44-yard field goal with 2:21 left in
the game.
"I thought I might have kicked it too far
tothe right,"said Bahr, describing histhird
field goal of the day. "But it was about four
feet inside the upright. I guess everyone
on that side of the stadium blew hard for
me."
Bahr watched from the sidelines as Tam
pa Bay moved upfield and got into field
position in the closing seconds.
"I was just hoping they'd mess up some
how, and fortunately they did," said the
Oakland kicker.
Ted Hendricks, who had blocked an ex
tra point attempt earlier, slapped down
what could have been the winning points
for Tampa Bay, messing up the Bucs' field
goal attempt.
"I got about a third of my palm on the
ball. It was just enough," said Hendricks.
"It burns me up that we couldn't make a
field goal. This is supposed to be the 'big
time.' It wasn't the kicker's fault, it was a

bad snap/' said Tampa Bay Coach John
McKay.
Tampa Bay, which had a three-game Na
tional Football League winning streak,
trailed 15-0 at' halftime. The Bucs, 4-3,
rallied in the second half behind the pass
ing of Doug Williams, whose 77-yard
touchdown pass to Kevin House woke up
the offense, and took a 16-15 lead on
rookie Bill Capece's 26-yard field goal with
5:01 remaining.
Williams completed a 40-yard pass to
Jimmie Giles on the Bucs' final possession.
After moving to the Oakland 13-yard line,
Tampa Bay stopped the clock with eight
seconds remaining and called on Capece.
Hendricks, the All-Pro linebacker, got a
hand on the ball, slowing it down just
enough that Capece's 30-yard attempt fell
several yards short.
Oakland quarterback Marc Wilson com
pleted four passes for 44 yards as the Raid
ers drove from their 21 to the Tampa Bay 26
for the game-winning kick by Bahr.
Jim Plunkett, the quarterback who took
Oakland to its Super Bowl victory last sea
son, did not play yesterday.
The Raiders' offensive line, which has
undergone some personnel changes re
cently, gave Wilson good protection — he
was not sacked — and opened up holes for
a running attack which netted 194 yards.
Kenny King led the rushers, with 87 yards
on 17 carries.

hand on the ball, slowing it down just
enough that Capece's 30-yard attempt fell
several yards short.
Oakland quarterback Marc Wilson com
pleted four passes for 44 yards as the Raid
ers drove from their 21 to the Tampa Bay 26
for the game-winning kick by Bahr.
Jim Plunkett, the quarterback who took
Oakland to its Super Bowl victory last sea
son, did not play yesterday.
The Raiders' offensive line, which has
undergone some personnel changes re
cently, gave Wilson good protection — he
was not sacked — and opened up holes for
a running attack which netted 194 yards.
Kenny King led the rushers, with 87 yards
on 17 carries.

STICKWOMEN FALTER — The Stanford field hockey team dropped a heartbreaker over
the weekend to a tough Cal State Long Beach squad. Long Beach is the defending AIAW
champion.
Milwaukee (AP) — Surprising San
Francisco had been averaging nearly 27
points per game, but Coach Bill Walsh
credited the pass rush for the 49ers' 13-3
National Football League victory over the
Green Bay Packers yesterday.
"They couldn't cope with our pass
rush," said Walsh, whose 49ers are 5-2 with
a 4-game winning streak. "Fred Dean's
rush and the young guys made the dif
ference. Our defense has done the job.
They can control the game for us."
Joe Montana passed for 210 yards for the
49ers, setting up a 1-yard plunge by Johnny
Davis for the go-ahead touchdown and 2
field goals by Ray Wersching. Defensive
ends Dean and Lawrence Pillers protected
the 49ers' lead with 4 quarterback sacks, 3
of them by Pillers.
Pillers said he was free to rush because
the Packers' often double-teamed Dean, a
former all-pro signed by the 49ers two
weeks ago.
"They double-teamed Fred with a tackle
and a back, and I was able to beat the
guard," Pillers said. "We knew they had
troubles at tackle, so we exploited their
weaknesses."
Coach Bart Starr, whose Packers slipped
to 2-5, agreed that the 49ers' pass rush was
the key.
"Very much so," Starr said. "We simply
didn't have the time needed. When you
have to keep a back in to help block, it ob

viously limits the things you can do."
Oakland (AP) — The Oakland Raiders
finally won, breaking a three-week scoring
drought, and they did it with flair.
"We brought back some of the Raiders'
tradition, coming from behind and win
ning in the final minutes. That's impor
tant," said Coach Tom Flores.
The Super Bowl champions snapped out
of their offensive rut to beat the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers 18-16 yesterday on Chris
Bahr's 44-yard field goal with 2:21 left in
the game.
"I thought I might have kicked it too far
tothe right,"said Bahr, describing histhird
field goal of the day. "But it was about four
feet inside the upright. I guess everyone
on that side of the stadium blew hard for
me."
Bahr watched from the sidelines as Tam
pa Bay moved upfield and got into field
position in the closing seconds.
"I was just hoping they'd mess up some
how, and fortunately they did," said the
Oakland kicker.
Ted Hendricks, who had blocked an ex
tra point attempt earlier, slapped down
what could have been the winning points
for Tampa Bay, messing up the Bucs' field
goal attempt.
"I got about a third of my palm on the
ball. It was just enough," said Hendricks.
"It burns me up that we couldn't make a
field goal. This is supposed to be the 'big
time.' It wasn't the kicker's fault, it was a

bad snap/' said Tampa Bay Coach John
McKay.
Tampa Bay, which had a three-game Na
tional Football League winning streak,
trailed 15-0 at' halftime. The Bucs, 4-3,
rallied in the second half behind the pass
ing of Doug Williams, whose 77-yard
touchdown pass to Kevin House woke up
the offense, and took a 16-15 lead on
rookie Bill Capece's 26-yard field goal with
5:01 remaining.
Williams completed a 40-yard pass to
Jimmie Giles on the Bucs' final possession.
After moving to the Oakland 13-yard line,
Tampa Bay stopped the clock with eight
seconds remaining and called on Capece.
Hendricks, the All-Pro linebacker, got a
hand on the ball, slowing it down just
enough that Capece's 30-yard attempt fell
several yards short.
