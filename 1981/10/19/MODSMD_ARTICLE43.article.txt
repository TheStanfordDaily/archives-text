# NCAA berth in jeopardy
## Hockers lose to Long Beach 4-1 
### Mike Thurman 
Saturday was a good day for
the Beach.
The Long Beach State field
hockey team felt right at home
under the clear skies and hot
sun at Roble field, rallying to
give Stanford its first con
ference loss by a margin of 4-1.
That margin, while potential
ly undoing the Cards' hopes for
a playoff berth, is highly decep
tive. If the NCAA Selection
Committee decides not to in
vite the Stanford team back
East this fall purely on the basis
of that final score between two
of the West Coast's pow
erhouse squads, it will be a
shame.
If they had attended the
match, they would have seen a
scrappy young Stanford team
constantly challenging the 1980
AIAW champions in the first
half, finally taking a 1-0 lead
into halftime on a Patsy Hunt
ington slapshot in front of the
Long Beach goal.
But as coach Onnie Killefer
said, "We're still learning how
to play for 70 minutes."
Similar to last Tuesday's tie
with University of Pacific, tem
porary letdowns in the
Cardinal attack cost the team
heavily. In contrast to the UOP
match, however, the Long
Beach State team had explosive
scoring power when the Cards

relaxed.
Mid-way through the sec
ond half, Long Beach broke the
Stanford shutout, tying the
score on one of their notorious
corner plays.
"I get six grey hairs every
time I see their corner team,''
said Killefer.
Unfortunately the Cards saw
a lot of the Long Beach corner
team in the second half and the
49ers seemed intent on hold
ing a clinic concerning all the
ways they could score off the
corner play. For the next seven
teen minutes, the seventh
ranked Long Beach State team
kept up a steady assault on the
Stanford goal, scoring inside
on assists from the outside and
scoring outside on assists from
the inside.
Stanford goalie Amy Bernard
had the undesirable chore of
stopping the hard Long Beach
corner shots.
"They had one where they
brought the ball out in front,
then took it back outside for
the shot," Bernard said. "There
was no way I could get back in
time."
Huntington cited Long
Beach State's team experience
as a major factor in the Stanford
loss.
"I think it's a sign that we're

still maturing as a team that we
have trouble when another
team comes at us," Huntington
said. "We seem to need to be
on the attack or else we let up a

little."
"But I can't feel that badly,"
she added. "Our team started
four sophomores and one
freshman."
