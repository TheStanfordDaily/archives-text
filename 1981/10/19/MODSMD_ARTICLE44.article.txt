Reagan, Mitterrand begin summit
Williamsburg, Va. — President Ronald Reagan and
French President Francois Mitterrand began a summit
meeting yesterday with expressions of mutual friend
ship against the historic background of the 1781
Yorktown victory, where the Americans, with vital
French assistance, won their war of independence.
However, the summit opened with indications of
important differences between the two nations.
Mitterrand criticized the Reagan administration for
its reluctance to increase aid to the world's poor na
tions. He urged the United States to move quickly into
strategic arms negotiations with Moscow, and also
said he opposed U.S. policy on Central America, the
Middle East and the need for a world energy policy.
The summit comes four days before Mitterrand and
Reagan meet again with leaders of 20 other nations at
Cancun, Mexico, to discuss international develop
ment.
Mitterrand said that if Cancun does not bring the
richand poor nations closer together, itwouldbe bet
ter not to have such a summit because failure would
risk a disastrous new round of criticism of the in
dustrial world by the poor.
Mitterrand expressed the hope that Cancun will
bring progress toward an international energy policy
to help poor nations with crippling fuel costs.
Mitterrand spoke on the anti-war movement in Eu
rope, saying that recent developments have
heightened Europeans' concerns that their nations
are being marked out as a future nuclear battlefield
by the superpowers.
On the Middle East, Mitterrand lined up against the
United States' playing the role in attempts to make
peace, saying that the peace process must be started
by the Mideast states themselves.
Mitterrand said that not only the United States, but
also "ultimately" the Soviet Union, must be involved
in the peace process.
Reagan acknowleges recession
Washington — President Ronald Reagan acknowl
edged yesterday for the first time that the U.S. econo
my is in a recession.
"I think there's a slight and I hope a short re
cession," Reagan said before departing to meet
French President Francois Mitterrand. "I think ev
eryone agrees on that."
Administration economists, while agreeing the
economy is weak, have been reluctant to say that it is
in a recession. A growing number of forecasters, how
ever, expect the slump to continue until sometime in
the first half of next year.
High interest rates — the result of the efforts by the
Federal Reserve to slow the growth of the money sup
ply to hold down inflation — are blamed by econo
mists for the slide into recession.
Administration officials have no plans to change ec
onomic policies in order to counter the recession.
The Reagan economists are counting on faster
money growth, and a slump in credit demand as
sociated with the recession, to bring down interest
rates and spur a recovery. Additional business and
personal income tax cuts already on the books for
next year as part of Reagan's economic policy pack
age will help, too, they believe.
Poland selects new leader
Warsaw — Poland's Communist Party leader,
Stanislaw Kania, resigned yesterday in the face of
mounting criticism by political opponents of his in
ability to meet the challenge posed by the independ
ent Solidarity trade union.
The party's policy-making Central Committee re
placed him with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who al
ready holds the posts of prime minister and defense
minister and becomes the first military man to head
Poland's Communist Party.
After his election, Jaruzelski said the most impor
tant task was "to fulfill public expectations for change
and an improvement in the situation and to overcome
the crisis and strenghten the socialist state." He also
described Poland's alliance with the Soviet Union as
of "invaluable significance."
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said
it was "too soon for a full assessment" of the change
but that "since February, as premier, Jaruzelski has as
sociated himself with a policy of seeking negotiated
solutions with Solidarity."
Polish political sources said one reason for
Jaruzelski's election was that he still appeared to en
joy some credibility with the Kremlin. He has played a
major role in integrating Poland's defense effort with

the rest of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
Greek socialists win election
Athens, Greece — Andreas Papandreou's Pan
hellenic Socialist movement that promises French
style socialization and looser ties with the West, won a
victory in the Greek national elections yesterday.
"We seek stable change," Papandreou said in a vic
tory statement. He appealed for national unity behnd
his program of change, but the moderation of his re
marks did not quiet anxiety among many of Greece's
allies.
"We are very concerned," one Western diplomat
here said.
Prime Minister George Rallis, whose New De
mocracy Party has brought an unprecedented period
of political stability to Greece in the seven years since
the military dictatorshp was overthrown, conceded
defeat scarcely three hours after the polls had closed.
The results were jarring to some of Greece's allies,
including the United States. Papandreou had con
ducted a campaign flavored with anti-Americanism,
and also advocating diminished ties to both NATO
and the European Common Market.
Papandreou did nothing in his victory statement
last night to clarify ambiguities in his campaign
statements on loosening ties with the West and termi
nating American military bases in Greece.
Saudi peace plan splits PLO
Beirut, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia's blueprint for
Middle East peace has split the ranksof Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization, attracted a mixed
reaction in Israel and drawn a cool "no comment"
from the United States.
The eight-point plan laid down by crown Prince
Fahd will be presented to an Arab summit next month
as an alternative to the struggling U.S.-inspired Camp
David accord.
The proposals call for:
—Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories oc
cupied in 1967.
—Dismantling of all Israeli settlements in occupied
territory.
—Guaranteed access to all holy places for all faiths.
—Emphasizing the rights of the Palestinian people
and compensating those who do not wish to return.
—A transition period of "a few months" under U.N.
auspices.
—Proclamation of an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital.
—The right of all states in the area to live in peace.
—The United Nations or "certain members" to
guarantee the plan.
Fahd said he drew on United Nations resolutions
for all the major points of the plan.
From the Israeli point of view, the plan is un
balanced and contains red flag issues such as dividing
Jerusalem, creating a Palestinian state and uprooting
Jewish settlements. However, the plank that calls for
the right of all states in the area to live in peace was
seen as tacit recognition of the Jewish state's right to
exist.
Dayan buried in Israel
Nahalal, Israel — Moshe Dayan, who for a gener
ation quintessentially symbolized to the world young
Israel struggling for its survival, was buried yesterday
in a starkly simple ceremony.
Thousands of Israelis joined with the entire govern
ment, the armed forces' general staffs and foreign
dignitaries to pay final respects to Dayan.
Dayan died Friday of a massive heart attack at age
66.
Menachem Begin, who in 1979 was forced to accept
Dayan's resignation as foreign minister in a dispute
over the future of negotiations on Palestinian auton
omy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said:
"He was a man without fear — and therefore he
could serve as an example to others. He was un
equaled in our generation in fulfilment of the ancient
Jewish heritage embodied in t4ie command 'after
me,'"
Dayan, among other posts, held the jobs of Israeli
army chief of staff, agriculture minister, defense min
ister and foreign minister.
