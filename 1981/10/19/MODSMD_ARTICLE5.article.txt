# PA Council race strikes few sparks
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
With the elections for Palo Alto city
council members only two weeks
away, it is notable that this year's race
has lacked the heated debates and
divisive campaigning which had
characterized municipal elections
here for the past ten years.
Even though there are ten can
didates competing for five open
spaces on the city council, the cam
paigns have been mild, with more
emphasis on the individual ex
perience of each candidate rather
than on their views on any particular
; question.
Although there are definite prob
lems which have to be addressed by
the council in the coming months,
such as dealing with funding cuts re
sulting from Proposition 13 changes,
no major local issues have become
tt\e focal potnt of the candidate's
campaigns.

News analysis

"They've been struggling to find
â€¢an issue," said Palo Alto Mayor Alan
Henderson, who first ran in a Palo
Alto election in 1971. "It's totally dif
ferent from the time I first began
campaigning for city council, when it
was an open battle between the 'es
tablishment' and the 'residential'
camps."
At that time, he explained, there
were issues such as hjgh rise control,
partitioning of foothilf' land, and
baylands conservation which had the
community divided into pro-de
velopement and pro-conservation
sides.
According to other members of
the Palo Alto political community,
these issues were intensified by the
fact that the candidates ran together
as slates, thus solidifying and allign
ing interests on a much larger scale.
Also, Palo Alto was involved at the

time in programs above and beyond
county commitments, such as drug
rehabilitation, which involved many
citizens who might otherwise not
have been concerned with the politi
cal situation.
Yet today, most of these devisive is
sues have been settled. As current
city council member Fred Eyerly
stated, "We have reached a city limit
in terms of building, so there is more
concern within the community that
Palo Alto be maintained as a good
place to live."
"Six years ago, it was a pretty hard
fought campaign," said Eyerly.
"There were four council members
seated over three incumbents. More
seemed to be at stake then."
And yet there are issues which will
confront the city council next year,
such as how to deal with purchasesof
schools that the city board of educa
tion might decide to sell.
"One of the main issues we will
have to consider is what to do about
the school sites," said current City
Council Member Ann Witherspoon.
"If we decide to buy the sites (such as
Terman Junior High, which was
closed last year), we will need to de
termine where the money will come
from. Also, we will have to decide
what to do with the site: change it to
housing? Or maybe rezone the area
for another purpose."
Another prime issue which will be
considered by the council is the Stan
ford West project, a proposed de
velopment of 1300 apartments along
Willow Road between the Oak Creek
apartments and Children's Hospital.
The project is within Palo Alto juris
diction, and any new housing there
must be approved by the council.
"It's an issue nobody seems to have
wrestled with," said Witherspoon.
"There is a dichotomy here. Most
councils haven't wanted Stanford
West, and yet at the same time they
don't want Stanford to impinge on
the Palo Alto housing market."
A related issue is the extension of
Willow Road through the Stanford
Shopping Center, which must also be
approved by the city council. Stan
ford and officials in the city of Menlo
Park contend that such a step is nec
essary to accomodate increased traf
fic from the Stanford West project.
Yet the "crusading" environment
of the past few elections is gone. Ac
cording to Henderson, the city coun
cil in the past two years has become
primarily residentialist, taking a more
moderate stance on the issues, and
this is reflected in the current elec
tions.
"Now times call for a more mod
erate approach," said Henderson.
"The issues which the council will
have to consider need that sort of ob
jectivity."
Henderson and others did express
some concern, however, that the
moderate campaigning may affect
voter turnout for the election.
"Although, in the past, the elec
tions were also in an off-year," said
Henderson. "And turnout for can
didate's nights (question and answer
debates held at local high schools)
has been normal."
