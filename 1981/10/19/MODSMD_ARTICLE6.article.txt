# Marotta directs publicity efforts

The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace reached new
heights of recognition when Ronald
Reagan, an honorary fellow there,
won last year's presidential election
and named several Hoover re
searchers to positions in his adminis
tration. However, the Institution's
rise to national prominence has been
an ongoing process and has been
achieved partly through the efforts of
Public Affairs Coordinator George
Marotta. .
Marotta's job has been to publicize
the scholarship done at Hoover. His
most effective technique is called
"op-ed": opinion pieces are sent ev
ery day to 120 newspapers to be run
opposite the editorial page. This tac
tic was begun in 1977, when 17 such
pieces were published. Last year 180
pieces were published. So far this
year 200 articles have been published
Hoover has become established
among the media as a source of in
formation on political issues. On the
day of the Sadat assassination, Hoo

ver received 15 calls from media, in
cluding Time Magazine and United
Press International, about the event's
effect on Middle East politics.
Marotta emphasized that Hoover's
function is to do research and not to
produce op-ed pieces. "I come by af
ter the research has already been
done and then ask the scholar if he
wants to do an op-ed piece," he ex
plained, "so it's (an op-ed piece), not
really diverting our attention."
Marotta added "if nobody knows
about the research you're doing,
what have you accomplished? We
have an obligation to society in gen
eral to make available the results of
research."
Marotta, who himself has held sev
eral government positions, said his
experience is a mixture of political
science and public affairs. Concern
ing his current job, he said, "If I can
get it (research) out, I don't care who
the reader is."
Marotta's most recent under
takings include encouraging re
search fellows to give speeches to
students in dorms. The purpose of
the speeches, Marotta explained, is
to expose undergraduates to the
work done at Hoover, and also to en
courage researchers to put their

work into a presentable form for
publication in books and op-eds.
Another project is to put most ma
jor college papers on the op-ed list.
Marotta said, "Some of the op-ed
pieces which the Daily ran stirred up
quite a bit of controversy. So I
thought that I could reach future
opinion leaders with our research by
going to other college newspapers.
All our op-eds go to the top 20 col
lege newspapers: Harvard,
Dartmouth, etc. Unfortunately we
don't have any indications yet that
they're doing much with them, but I
still think it's a good idea."
Several scholars associated with
Hoover hold positions in the Reagan

administration, including Martin An
derson, White House director of pol
icy development, and National Se
curity Adviser Richard Allen, both
Hoover Fellows.
He also indicated that in spite of
the Institution's ties with the Reagan
administration, the views developed
here are not totally conservative. He
said that according to researchers
who have visited Hoover, "There is a
wider range of views at Hoover than
in most universities."
Marotta said he believes Hoover
will continue to grow in importance.
"We're sitting on a gold mine," he
said. "With the information society
that is now being created, there will
be a great demand for facts. And, the
University is a source of facts with a
lot of validity. The ideas have always
been here; now they are being trans
mitted."

really diverting our attention."
Marotta added "if nobody knows
about the research you're doing,
what have you accomplished? We
have an obligation to society in gen
eral to make available the results of
research."
Marotta, who himself has held sev
eral government positions, said his
experience is a mixture of political
science and public affairs. Concern
ing his current job, he said, "If I can
get it (research) out, I don't care who
the reader is."
Marotta's most recent under
takings include encouraging re
search fellows to give speeches to
students in dorms. The purpose of
the speeches, Marotta explained, is
to expose undergraduates to the
work done at Hoover, and also to en

work into a presentable form for
publication in books and op-eds.
Another project is to put most ma
jor college papers on the op-ed list.
Marotta said, "Some of the op-ed
pieces which the Daily ran stirred up
quite a bit of controversy. So I
thought that I could reach future
opinion leaders with our research by
going to other college newspapers.
All our op-eds go to the top 20 col
lege newspapers: Harvard,
Dartmouth, etc. Unfortunately we
don't have any indications yet that
they're doing much with them, but I
still think it's a good idea."
Several scholars associated with
Hoover hold positions in the Reagan

administration, including Martin An
derson, White House director of pol
icy development, and National Se
curity Adviser Richard Allen, both
Hoover Fellows.
He also indicated that in spite of
the Institution's ties with the Reagan
administration, the views developed
here are not totally conservative. He
said that according to researchers
who have visited Hoover, "There is a
wider range of views at Hoover than
in most universities."
Marotta said he believes Hoover
will continue to grow in importance.
"We're sitting on a gold mine," he
said. "With the information society
that is now being created, there will
be a great demand for facts. And, the
University is a source of facts with a
lot of validity. The ideas have always
been here; now they are being trans
mitted."
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace reached new
heights of recognition when Ronald
Reagan, an honorary fellow there,
won last year's presidential election
and named several Hoover re
searchers to positions in his adminis
tration. However, the Institution's
rise to national prominence has been
an ongoing process and has been
achieved partly through the efforts of
Public Affairs Coordinator George
Marotta. .
Marotta's job has been to publicize
the scholarship done at Hoover. His
most effective technique is called
"op-ed": opinion pieces are sent ev
ery day to 120 newspapers to be run
opposite the editorial page. This tac
tic was begun in 1977, when 17 such
pieces were published. Last year 180
pieces were published. So far this
year 200 articles have been published
Hoover has become established
among the media as a source of in
formation on political issues. On the
day of the Sadat assassination, Hoo

ver received 15 calls from media, in
cluding Time Magazine and United
Press International, about the event's
effect on Middle East politics.
Marotta emphasized that Hoover's
function is to do research and not to
produce op-ed pieces. "I come by af
ter the research has already been
done and then ask the scholar if he
wants to do an op-ed piece," he ex
plained, "so it's (an op-ed piece), not
really diverting our attention."
Marotta added "if nobody knows
about the research you're doing,
what have you accomplished? We
have an obligation to society in gen
eral to make available the results of
