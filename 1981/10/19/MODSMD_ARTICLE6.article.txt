The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace reached new
heights of recognition when Ronald
Reagan, an honorary fellow there,
won last year's presidential election
and named several Hoover re
searchers to positions in his adminis
tration. However, the Institution's
rise to national prominence has been
an ongoing process and has been
achieved partly through the efforts of
Public Affairs Coordinator George
Marotta. .
Marotta's job has been to publicize
the scholarship done at Hoover. His
most effective technique is called
"op-ed": opinion pieces are sent ev
ery day to 120 newspapers to be run
opposite the editorial page. This tac
tic was begun in 1977, when 17 such
pieces were published. Last year 180
pieces were published. So far this
year 200 articles have been published
Hoover has become established
among the media as a source of in
formation on political issues. On the
day of the Sadat assassination, Hoo

ver received 15 calls from media, in
cluding Time Magazine and United
Press International, about the event's
effect on Middle East politics.
Marotta emphasized that Hoover's
function is to do research and not to
produce op-ed pieces. "I come by af
ter the research has already been
done and then ask the scholar if he
wants to do an op-ed piece," he ex
plained, "so it's (an op-ed piece), not
really diverting our attention."
Marotta added "if nobody knows
about the research you're doing,
what have you accomplished? We
have an obligation to society in gen
eral to make available the results of
research."
Marotta, who himself has held sev
eral government positions, said his
experience is a mixture of political
science and public affairs. Concern
ing his current job, he said, "If I can
get it (research) out, I don't care who
the reader is."
Marotta's most recent under
takings include encouraging re
search fellows to give speeches to
students in dorms. The purpose of
the speeches, Marotta explained, is
to expose undergraduates to the
work done at Hoover, and also to en
courage researchers to put their
