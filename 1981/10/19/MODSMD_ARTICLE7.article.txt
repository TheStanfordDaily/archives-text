# Board of trustees exhibits dedication, change

They are a rare and mysterious
breed. It's difficult to spot them in a
crowd unless you know who you're
looking for. On the 28 or 29 days
when they're not tucked away in
meetings here on campus, they fan
out over the country, disguised as
doctors, lawyers, politicians, journal
ists, judges and educators, with only a
crimson "S" on a blue silk tie, or a
Stanford Magazine on their coffee
tables to cast suspicion about their
identity.
Who are these phantom as
sociates? Government agents? The
Medfly task force? No, no such in
famous title fits this group, which is
probably best known to students as
the people who keep raising our tui
tion: the Stanford University Board
of Trustees.
They approve buildingdesignsand
programs, accept gifts, determine
how various balances in zero-sum
areas will be maintained, just like any
other corporate board.
However, as board President Wil
liam Kimball noted before he took
over as president last June, "For
tunately a good friend of mine — a

former trustee — took me to lunch
and said 'Bill, one thing you have to
remember is that you can't run a uni
versity like you run a corporation;
you can't fire anybody, everything is
done by committee., What an ex
ecutive says in half a page, a univer
sity man will say in five.' It'sabsolutely
true and it's one of the best pieces of
advice I've ever had. It would have
taken me a year of frustration to learn
it myself."
As part of our commitment to
reaching greater understanding of
this vastly complex university, the
Daily will, through this series of
articles and through subsequent
pieces, explore the human elements
behind the building renovation votes
and the logistics of the board's work.
In addition to more penetrating
study of how the structure of the
board affects the board's decisions in
this university environment, we are
also curious about notions such as
why, for instance, board members
devote at least one or two days a
month out of very busy schedules to
flying here from all over the country?
What about Stanford draws them to
serve? What satisfaction do they get
out of being trustees?

We realize that a portion of the
trustees in fact don't attend the meet
ings regularly. A source close to the
board estimates that about 24 of the
32 members are present at each of
the eight meetings per year, "but that
figure can be misleading because
several of'them only make half the
meetings."

STANFORD UNIVERSITY
BOARD OF TRUSTEES

A glance through the information
bulletin gives some of the bare facts
about the people who run Stanford.
In a nutshell, board members have
the power to appoint or remove the
president; they fix all University per
sonnel's salaries; they are custodians

of the endowment. The board ad
ministers the invested funds, sets the
annual budget and determines poli
cies for operation and control of the
University. The board, which oper
ates under its own guidelines, can be
composed of a minimum of 25 mem
bers to a maximum of 35 people.
Finally, they are charged with the
responsibilities of establishing and
maintaining an educational system
which will "fit undergraduates for
some useful purpose" and afford
equal facilities and advantages to
both sexes.
Naturally, the board members
themselves are at least as important
as is their list of formal duties.
The past year has chronicled sever
al changes in the board's composi
tion, including a new president, the
addition of several new members
and the stepping down of other
pivotal figures who have brought
Stanford to where it is today.
While the transitions are likely to
be smooth, they cannot help but pro
pel Stanford in slightly different
directions as the board fast ap
proaches 100 years of attempting to
qualify students "for personal suc
cess and direct usefulness in life," as

they were charged in the 1885 Found
ing Grant of Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford.
The board of trustees has grown
from a small, homogenous handful
of rich and influential San Francis
cans who held meetings in each oth
er's parlors to its present 31-person
size.
But the issues have grown, as well.
Energy cost increases which at
times are double or triple predicted
rates, the licensing of patents on the
stuff of which life is made, the dilem
ma of trying to house fair if not ade
quate amounts of undergraduates,
graduate students, staff and faculty in
one of the most expensive housing
markets in the nation and the ongo
ing task of repairing relationships
with hundreds of alumni and friends
of Stanford whose allegiance was lost
in the not-so-long ago years of con
flict and violence on campus
prompted by the Vietnam war: all are
in the realm of the board's concern.
Unlike many boards, several
trustees noted, ours does not have
executive committees which decide
major issues. All matterscome before
the entire board for a vote although

said although the allowance is gone
after seven years, salaries will have in
creased enough to allow professors
to make mortgage payments on their
own.
"I would not have come here
without them (housing programs),"
said Asst. Prof, of Law Bob Weissberg.
"The main attraction (here) was the
environment. The trade-off is that
without the University's doing, the
environment is simply too ex
pensive," he said.
In addition to the new housing al
lowance program, the University also
operates a co-investment program

for faculty and staff (COIN) which of
fers low interest home loans to em
ployees of the University, in return
for a portion of the commission
when the home is sold.
Since COIN was started on a pilot
basis in February 1980, it has helped
almost 100 eligible applicants buy a
home, according to a recent Campus
Report article. COIN has now been
made permanent, and the board of
trustees has approved a $10 million
expansion of the program.
"The two programs in combina
tion should make the Peter Coutts
Condominiumsaffordable tothefac
ulty," said Hamill.

flying here from all over the country?
What about Stanford draws them to
serve? What satisfaction do they get
out of being trustees?

We realize that a portion of the
trustees in fact don't attend the meet

board estimates that about 24 of the
32 members are present at each of
the eight meetings per year, "but that

STANFORD UNIVERSITY
BOARD OF TRUSTEES

A glance through the information
bulletin gives some of the bare facts
about the people who run Stanford.
In a nutshell, board members have
the power to appoint or remove the
president; they fix all University per
sonnel's salaries; they are custodians

of the endowment. The board ad
ministers the invested funds, sets the
annual budget and determines poli
cies for operation and control of the
University. The board, which oper
ates under its own guidelines, can be
composed of a minimum of 25 mem
bers to a maximum of 35 people.
Finally, they are charged with the
responsibilities of establishing and
maintaining an educational system
which will "fit undergraduates for
some useful purpose" and afford
equal facilities and advantages to
both sexes.
Naturally, the board members
themselves are at least as important
as is their list of formal duties.
The past year has chronicled sever
al changes in the board's composi
tion, including a new president, the
addition of several new members
and the stepping down of other
pivotal figures who have brought
Stanford to where it is today.
While the transitions are likely to
be smooth, they cannot help but pro
pel Stanford in slightly different
directions as the board fast ap
proaches 100 years of attempting to
qualify students "for personal suc
cess and direct usefulness in life," as

they were charged in the 1885 Found
ing Grant of Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford.
The board of trustees has grown
from a small, homogenous handful
of rich and influential San Francis
cans who held meetings in each oth
er's parlors to its present 31-person
size.
But the issues have grown, as well.
Energy cost increases which at
times are double or triple predicted
rates, the licensing of patents on the
stuff of which life is made, the dilem
ma of trying to house fair if not ade
quate amounts of undergraduates,
graduate students, staff and faculty in
one of the most expensive housing
markets in the nation and the ongo
ing task of repairing relationships
with hundreds of alumni and friends
of Stanford whose allegiance was lost
in the not-so-long ago years of con
flict and violence on campus
prompted by the Vietnam war: all are
in the realm of the board's concern.
Unlike many boards, several
trustees noted, ours does not have
executive committees which decide
major issues. All matterscome before
the entire board for a vote although

said although the allowance is gone
after seven years, salaries will have in
creased enough to allow professors
to make mortgage payments on their
own.
"I would not have come here
without them (housing programs),"
said Asst. Prof, of Law Bob Weissberg.
"The main attraction (here) was the
environment. The trade-off is that
without the University's doing, the
environment is simply too ex
pensive," he said.
In addition to the new housing al
lowance program, the University also
operates a co-investment program

for faculty and staff (COIN) which of
fers low interest home loans to em
ployees of the University, in return
for a portion of the commission
when the home is sold.
Since COIN was started on a pilot
basis in February 1980, it has helped
almost 100 eligible applicants buy a
home, according to a recent Campus
Report article. COIN has now been
made permanent, and the board of
trustees has approved a $10 million
expansion of the program.
"The two programs in combina
tion should make the Peter Coutts
Condominiumsaffordable tothefac
ulty," said Hamill.
They are a rare and mysterious
breed. It's difficult to spot them in a
crowd unless you know who you're
looking for. On the 28 or 29 days
when they're not tucked away in
meetings here on campus, they fan
out over the country, disguised as
doctors, lawyers, politicians, journal
ists, judges and educators, with only a
crimson "S" on a blue silk tie, or a
Stanford Magazine on their coffee
tables to cast suspicion about their
identity.
Who are these phantom as
sociates? Government agents? The
Medfly task force? No, no such in
famous title fits this group, which is
probably best known to students as
the people who keep raising our tui
tion: the Stanford University Board
of Trustees.
They approve buildingdesignsand
programs, accept gifts, determine
how various balances in zero-sum
areas will be maintained, just like any
other corporate board.
However, as board President Wil
liam Kimball noted before he took
over as president last June, "For
