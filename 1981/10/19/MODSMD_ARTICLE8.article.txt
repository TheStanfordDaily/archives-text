## Conference in Mexico will discuss Third World 
### Los Angeles Times (First of two parts) 
At one end of the scale is
poverty-ridden Bangladesh,
where 13 percent of all new
born infants die within a year
and little more than half the
population has access to safe
water supplies.
At the other end is booming
Brazil, where aggressive in
dustrialists now sell airplanes
— and no longer just such
things as shoes and coffee — to
the United States.
Brazil and Bangladesh are
two of the more than 100 na
tions that make up what is
loosely known as the Third
World, countries that are part
of neither the First World of the
United Stats and its industrial
allies nor the Second World of
the Soviet Union and its Eastern
Euiopean satellites.
This week, President Ronald
Reagan will travel to Cancun,
Mexico, for a North-South
summit with 14 nations repre
senting the world's less-de
veloped realm and eight (in
cluding the United States) rep
resenting the industrial one.
T he Soviet Union and the other
Second World nations are
staying away, although two
other Communist countries,
China and Yugoslavia, will at
tend as part of the South dele
gation.
1 hird World heterogeneity
Too diverse to qualify as an
alliance, the Third World's
motley membership ranges
from the rich (Kuwait, with an
nual per-capita income of
$17,100) to the poor (Mali, with
$140), from the small (Guyana,
with 800,000 people) to the
huge (China, with 960 million),
and from the democratic (Ven
ezuela) to the despotic (Libya).
The only thing that con
sistently unites these nations of
"the South," as they also have
come to be known, is a single
goal: Tobetaken moreserious
ly in both economic and politi
cal terms by their more north
erly industrial neighbors. A a
group, they have 75 percent of
the world's population with
only 20 percent of its income.
They want to reverse that im
balance, starting now.
The North-South meeting
Thursday and Friday in Cancun
comes at a critical time for the
Third World. The shocking oil
price boosts of the 1970s have
left scores of these nations with
huge, unsustainable trade defi
cits and many of them with
enormous debts to U.S. and Eu
ropean banks.
Prospects not hopeful
Moreover, the prospects for
the 1980s are not encouraging,
economists and bankers say.
"For the first half of the dec
ade, at least, 4he outlook is
grim," said John Sewell, presi
dent of the Overseas Develop
ment Council, a Washington
research group that studies
Third World economies. The
troubles could be severe
enough to wipe out some of
the hard-won gains of the last
10 years, he and some other an
alysts fear.
Meanwhile, the United
States and its industrial allies
face growing risks from the
spreading turmoil in the South,
and some analysts believe the
danger could ultimately sur
pass that from any direct
challenge by Moscow.
In addition, they contend, an
open society like that of the
United States is especially vul
nerable to the weapons of ter
rorism that are gaining ever
wider application in the Third
World these days.
