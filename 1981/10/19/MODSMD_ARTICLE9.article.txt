# Nixon Middle East tour brings advice to Reagan
## 
### Washington Post 
Paris — Former president Richard Nixon, re
turning from a trip to meet with leaders of five
Arab nations, called Saturday night for an eco
nomic quarantine of Libya and said Israel should
be prodded to step up its negotiations on
Palestinian autonomy.
All the leaders he spoke with on his private vis
it, made after he attended the funeral of Egyp
tian president Anwar Sadat, expressed concern
about Libyan leader Moatnmar Khadafy, Nixon
said.
"An international threat requires an interna
tional response," he said. "Our military options
are limited. Another course which might be
considered is to impose an international eco
nomic quarantine on Libya. As one Mideast
leader put it to me bluntly, 'Why doesn't the
West quit buying oil from Khadafy?' "
Came in typed statement
Nixon's written statement, typed and dupli
cated by a U.S. Embassy secretary here, took the
form of an analysis of positions held by the lead
ers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia and Moroc
co, and some cautious advice on how the Rea
gan administration should proceed in the
Middle East following the assassination of Sadat.
Nixon, who made most of his trip on Air Force
One and planes of other governments, was wait
listed to leave for New York on a commercial
flight yesterday, a spokesman said.
The report seemed less striking by its content
— generally consonant with the Reagan admin
istration's views — than by the fact that the dis
graced former president made it at all, sharing
his assessment and opinion with the U.S. public
on critical issues faced by President Ronald Rea
gan.
Nixon's chief aide, Nick Ruwe, said the former
president had U.S. Embassy administrative of
ficer Charles Emmons call The Washington Post,
The New York Times and the Associated Press
bureaus here to have the statement picked up at
Nixon's suite in theCrillon Hotel, traditional Par
is headquarters for visiting dignitaries.
Trying elder statesman role
In doing so, Nixon seemed to come closer to
seeking the role of elder statesman than at any
time since his resignation as president under
pressures of the Watergate scandal in 1974. His
trips to China in 1976 and to Europe on three
other occasions produced no such formal
statements analyzing foreign affairs and pro
claiming positions on U.S. policy.
"This was, if the term is right, more substan
tive," said Ruwe.
Nixon was part of the official U.S. delegation
to Sadat's funeral Oct. 10, with former presidents
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and former secre
tary of state Henry Kissinger, along with Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig and other officials.
Instead of returning to the United States with
Carter and Ford, Nixon flew in a Saudi plane to
Jeddeh for discussions with King Khalid and
Crown Prince Fahd, then continued to Jordan,
Tunisia and Morocco for talks with leaders of
those countries.
At the time, State Department spokesman
Dean Fischer emphasized that, although Nixon
had informed Haig of his plans to make the trip,
he was going as a private citizen without any mis

sion from the U.S. government. Ruwe reiterated
that point Saturday night, saying:
"He wasn't carrying any secret messages or
anything like that. It was getting the view of
these moderate Arab leaders."
Ruwe recalled, however, that Nixon would
make a report to Maig on his findings. Asked
whether the proposed sale of Airborne Warning
and Control Systems (AVVACS) planes to Saudi
Arabia was part of his discussion with the Saudi
leaders, Ruwe said: "They weren't talking about
Piper Cubs. Yes, AWACS were discussed, and
the Middle East after Sadat."
Nixon arranged trip
Nixon arranged the trips while still in the Unit
ed States, after learning he would be part of the
U.S. delegation, Ruwe said, responding in each
case to open invitations. Emmons said facilities
accorded Nixon by the U.S. Embassy were stan
dard procedure for a former president, includ
ing a direct line from the embassy switchboard
to Nixon's Crillon suite and embassy officials to
handle logistics for Nixon, Ruwe and Nixon's Se
cret Service detail.
Nixon warned that refusal by the United States
to sell AVVACS planes to Saudi Arabia could
"cool" the friendship with the United States of
the countries he visited.
"There can be no settlement of the Mideast
dispute without the enthusiastic support of
these moderate Arab countries," he added.
After noting that all the leaders he met ex
pressed belief that the Camp David autonomy
talks will fail to bring progress on the "Palesti
nian issue," Nixon said:
"They all believe the United States must at
some point enter into talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization. In this respect I would
point out (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak
is in a difficult position. On one hand, if heaban
dons Camp David he betrays his country by not
getting back the Sinai. On the other hand, if he
goes foiward on Camp David he risks betraying
his Arab brothers unless substantial piogress is
made on the Palestinian issue."
Camp David or PLO talks
Direct talks with the PLO will be "inevitable"
unless progress comes out of the Camp David
talks, Nixon reiterated, and this should be "an
incentive for Israel to negotiate on Palestinian
autonomy in the Camp David process."
In the meantime, he said, the United States
should persist in refusal to negotiate with the
PLO, while at the same time opening the way for
European allies to do so to avoid leaving a vacu
um "if Camp David fails to produce progress on
Palestinian rights."
Nixon called Khadafy "more than just a desert
rat" and "an international outlaw.."
Libya is the third-largest source of U.S. oil im
ports, after Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. Nixon said
the United States is"rnoving in that direction" of
boycotting Libyan oil and should encourage
Japan and NATO allies to do the same.
At the same time, he went on, the United
States should make it clear that, despite the fate
of Sadat and the shah of Iran, it is not dangerous
to be a friend of the United States. To do so, Nix
on suggested military and economic aid pro
grams to relieve internal pressures in "target na
tions like the Sudan."

his assessment and opinion with the U.S. public
on critical issues faced by President Ronald Rea
gan.
Nixon's chief aide, Nick Ruwe, said the former
president had U.S. Embassy administrative of
ficer Charles Emmons call The Washington Post,
The New York Times and the Associated Press
bureaus here to have the statement picked up at
Nixon's suite in theCrillon Hotel, traditional Par
is headquarters for visiting dignitaries.
Trying elder statesman role
In doing so, Nixon seemed to come closer to
seeking the role of elder statesman than at any
time since his resignation as president under
pressures of the Watergate scandal in 1974. His
trips to China in 1976 and to Europe on three
other occasions produced no such formal
statements analyzing foreign affairs and pro
claiming positions on U.S. policy.
"This was, if the term is right, more substan
tive," said Ruwe.
Nixon was part of the official U.S. delegation
to Sadat's funeral Oct. 10, with former presidents
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and former secre
tary of state Henry Kissinger, along with Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig and other officials.
Instead of returning to the United States with
Carter and Ford, Nixon flew in a Saudi plane to
Jeddeh for discussions with King Khalid and
Crown Prince Fahd, then continued to Jordan,
Tunisia and Morocco for talks with leaders of
those countries.
At the time, State Department spokesman
Dean Fischer emphasized that, although Nixon
had informed Haig of his plans to make the trip,
he was going as a private citizen without any mis

sion from the U.S. government. Ruwe reiterated
that point Saturday night, saying:
"He wasn't carrying any secret messages or
anything like that. It was getting the view of
these moderate Arab leaders."
Ruwe recalled, however, that Nixon would
make a report to Maig on his findings. Asked
whether the proposed sale of Airborne Warning
and Control Systems (AVVACS) planes to Saudi
Arabia was part of his discussion with the Saudi
leaders, Ruwe said: "They weren't talking about
Piper Cubs. Yes, AWACS were discussed, and
the Middle East after Sadat."
Nixon arranged trip
Nixon arranged the trips while still in the Unit
ed States, after learning he would be part of the
U.S. delegation, Ruwe said, responding in each
case to open invitations. Emmons said facilities
accorded Nixon by the U.S. Embassy were stan
dard procedure for a former president, includ
ing a direct line from the embassy switchboard
to Nixon's Crillon suite and embassy officials to
handle logistics for Nixon, Ruwe and Nixon's Se
cret Service detail.
Nixon warned that refusal by the United States
to sell AVVACS planes to Saudi Arabia could
"cool" the friendship with the United States of
the countries he visited.
"There can be no settlement of the Mideast
dispute without the enthusiastic support of
these moderate Arab countries," he added.
After noting that all the leaders he met ex
pressed belief that the Camp David autonomy
talks will fail to bring progress on the "Palesti
nian issue," Nixon said:
"They all believe the United States must at
some point enter into talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization. In this respect I would
point out (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak
is in a difficult position. On one hand, if heaban
dons Camp David he betrays his country by not
getting back the Sinai. On the other hand, if he
goes foiward on Camp David he risks betraying
his Arab brothers unless substantial piogress is
made on the Palestinian issue."
Camp David or PLO talks
Direct talks with the PLO will be "inevitable"
unless progress comes out of the Camp David
talks, Nixon reiterated, and this should be "an
incentive for Israel to negotiate on Palestinian
autonomy in the Camp David process."
In the meantime, he said, the United States
should persist in refusal to negotiate with the
PLO, while at the same time opening the way for
European allies to do so to avoid leaving a vacu
um "if Camp David fails to produce progress on
Palestinian rights."
Nixon called Khadafy "more than just a desert
rat" and "an international outlaw.."
Libya is the third-largest source of U.S. oil im
ports, after Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. Nixon said
the United States is"rnoving in that direction" of
boycotting Libyan oil and should encourage
Japan and NATO allies to do the same.
At the same time, he went on, the United
States should make it clear that, despite the fate
of Sadat and the shah of Iran, it is not dangerous
to be a friend of the United States. To do so, Nix
on suggested military and economic aid pro
grams to relieve internal pressures in "target na
tions like the Sudan."
Paris — Former president Richard Nixon, re
turning from a trip to meet with leaders of five
Arab nations, called Saturday night for an eco
nomic quarantine of Libya and said Israel should
be prodded to step up its negotiations on
Palestinian autonomy.
All the leaders he spoke with on his private vis
it, made after he attended the funeral of Egyp
tian president Anwar Sadat, expressed concern
about Libyan leader Moatnmar Khadafy, Nixon
said.
"An international threat requires an interna
tional response," he said. "Our military options
are limited. Another course which might be
considered is to impose an international eco
nomic quarantine on Libya. As one Mideast
leader put it to me bluntly, 'Why doesn't the
West quit buying oil from Khadafy?' "
