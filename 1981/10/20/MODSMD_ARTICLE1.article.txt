# Schawlow laser research wins Nobel
## Spectroscopy work earns share in award for Physics

The call came about 4 a.m. A re
porter was on the line with con
gratulations and the perennial "How
does it feel?" question. Soon the
phone was jangling off the hook and
press photographers were at the
door.
Meanwhile, University spokesmen
were already at work preparing press
releases and researching scientific in
formation they would soon be asked
to decipher "in laymen's terms."
Around here that only means one
thing: another Nobel Laureate for
Stanford.
Prof. Arthur Schawlow, 60, was
named as one of three recipients of
this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, the
Swedish Academy of Science an
nounced yesterday.
Fresh from a brief appearance
before an undergraduate physics
section, Schawlow told those
gathered for a hastily-assembled
press conference yesterday morning
that receiving the award, which he
was given for his work in laser spec
troscopy, is "a great honor and dis
tinction. It shows the work we're
doing is appreciated.
"But there's a lot of beautiful
things left in the world for us to find,"
he said.
Half of the $180,000 prize will go to
Swedish physicist Kai Siegbahn.
Schawlow and Harvard scientist
Nichollas Bloembergenn will split
the remaining $90,000, tax-free
award.
Although practical applications for
much of Schawlow's work are as yet
unspecific, the Laureate explained
that refinements in laser spec
troscopy will allow scientists to
"probe molecules in a purer way
than before.
"The laser provides us with a
uniquely powerful tool to seek out
very small numbers of atoms and
molecules — even as few as one —
and to learn about their properties,
how they go together to form
chemical compounds," said
Schawlow, who came to Stanford in
1961.
"I think we'll find that in food and
milk, for instance, we'll find some
new molecules, things that we think
are harmful. But we'll have to decide

what we can live with," he said. "Ever
since there were lasers we've been
trying to figure out what to do with
them."
Schawlow's laser research is some
times seen as pure science, with few
practical applications. However, in
several published articles Schawlow
has written that lasers have been ap
plied to such diverse activities as
shucking oysters, correcting typing
errors, fusing atoms, laying straight
lines for garden beds, drilling holes
in diamonds and repairing detached
retinas.
"Every time you do it you get sur
prises," he said.
"If we had wanted to help people
with blindness we certainly wouldn't
have been fooling around with
(lasers)," Schawlow said.
The hectic morning following the
award's announcement was some
thing of a rerun for Schawlow, who
holds three degrees in physics from
the University of Toronto. In 1964, he
had been tipped that he was to re
ceive the Nobel Prize in Physics for
his early work in lasers, and a similar
retinue of reporters and photogra
phers showed up at his home. But the
word came later that the prize had
been won by Schawlow's brother-in
law and co-worker Charles Townes,
and two Russian physicists.
"I knew when they awarded prizes
but I had no particular reason to be
lieve I would get it this year," he said.
Although the first call was from a re
porter, the Swedish Academy later
confirmed the announcement.
One hundred percent of the fund
ing for Schawlow's research is from
federal sources.
The pending budget cuts, he said,
"are going to hurt everybody. A time
when we face economic problems is
not the time to cut back on research
and scientific education."
Yet, Schawlow also admitted that a
lot of laser research money has been
wasted, especially in pursuit of de
fense technology. Schawlow,
himself, has resisted offers to work
on secret defense projects for the
government.
"I have every reason to be patri
otic, but I'd rather work on things I
can discuss openly with my students,
so I've never worked on secret

NOBEL LAUREATE BEAMS — Physics Prof. Arthur Schawlow holds up a copy of Microwave Spectroscopy,
which he co-authored with fellow laureate Charles Townes. This particular copy, however, includes .1
rather unique item — a tiny red-beamed laser. Schawlow, who told a press conference yesterday,
"there's a lot of beautiful things left in the world for us to find," has been a professor here since 1%1.
