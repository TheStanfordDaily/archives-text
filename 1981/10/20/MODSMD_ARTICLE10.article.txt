# Canada raps U.S. for acid rain
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bracebridge, Canada —
When President Ronald Rea
gan made his first official visit
to Ottawa last March, hun
dreds of angry Canadians tried
to drown out his speech with
shouts of "Stop acid rain!" To
them, the issue was stark and
simple: American industry was
spewing out pollutants into the
atmosphere that came down
later in rain that was destroying
the lakes of Canada.
As far as many Canadians are
concerned, acid rain is the sin
gle most rancorous and frus
trating issue festering between
their country and the United
States. They feel angry and
helpless while trying to deal
with a danger that they believe
comes in good part from
beyond their borders. Those
feelings are exacerbated by
Reagan's own preference for
industrialists over environmen
talists, and it is easy for Canadi
ans to mark him as the villain.
However, the issue — al
though very real — is neither so

simple nor stark as the pro
testers make out. Although
there are not as many scientific
doubts about the precise
sources, trajectories, and ef
fects of the pollutants that
create acid rain as some Ameri
can power companies con
tend, there are a few, and those
are sometimes brushed aside
by Canadian politicians.
Moreover, Canada has as bad a
record as the United States in
controling the emissions that
bring about acid rain.
Slow effect of rain
Acid rain — although harm
ful enough — works in subtle
ways. This subtlety allows some
American politicians to insist
they have found flaws in theev
idence, thus helping to turn a
scientific problem into a politi
cal controversy marked by
high-flown political rhetoric.
A special House of Com
mons subcommittee, in a re
cent report, said, "Canada is
facing the greatest environ
mental threat in the 114 years
of our existence as a nation."
John Roberts, Canada's min
ister of the environment, re
cently told a group of Ameri
can journalists that acid rain
"raises a clear and present dan
ger in our society." He con
tinued, "Are you going to stop
dumping your garbage in our
backyard?"
Pollution travels
Acid rain would probably
not be as much of a problem
today if environmentalists had
not succeeded a decade ago in
forcing coal-burning power
plants and other industries into
building enormous
smokestacks that spew sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides
higher into the skies. That
helped make the air cleaner in
industrial cities, but also spread
the pollution farther afield.
Once in the air, the pollut
ants travel long distances,
sometimes hundreds of miles,
and are transformed through a
little-understood oxidation

process into sulfuric acid and
nitric acid.
An independent group of
scientists, a U.S. National Re
search Council committee of
American, Canadian, Swedish
and Norwegian scientists, has
studied the problem.
The committee said in a re
cent report, "Although claims
have been made that direct ev
idence linking power-plant
emissions to the production of
acid rain is inconclusive, we
find the circumstantial evi
dence for their role over
whelming ."
By itself, acid rain does not
seem to create much of a prob
lem. Normal farmland, for ex
ample, with a high level of
limestone or other alkalines in
the soil, simply catches the acid
rain and neutralizes it. The
process is known as buffering.
Low alkaline soils
But some regions are not
very good at buffering because
their soils lack alkalines. The
Adirondack Mountains in New
York is one of them. So is much
of eastern Canada, where
glaciers scoured away the
topsoil thousands of years ago.
This part of Ontario — the
area around Lake Muskoka, a
little more than 100 miles north
of Toronto — illustrates the na
ture of the problem. This is one
of the most susceptible areas of
North America: researchers
have documented cases of 140
dead lakes in Ontario and 212
dead lakes in New York.
In all, the United States emits
28.5 million tons of sulfur diox
ide a year while Canada emits
5V2 million tons. With more
American power companies
turning to coal for energy and
with a large number applying
to the Environmental Protec
tion Agency for relaxation of
existing standards, the Ameri
can total may increase in the
next few years. The Canadian
total, however, is expected to
decrease.
