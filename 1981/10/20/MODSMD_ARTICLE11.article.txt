# Thailand debating bill on abortion
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bangkok, Thailand â€” A
movement to legalize abor
tions has aroused a passionate
debate in Thailand.
One lawmaker has vowed to
shave his head in Parliament if a
bill to legalize abortions be
comes law. Another opponent
ofjrbortion has denounced the
bill's supporters as sinners and
murderers.
The measure has already
passed the lower house of Par
liament and is being debated in
the Senate. Barring a major
change of sentiment, the bill is
expected to become law.
If it does, Thailand will have
broken new ground for most of
Southeast Asia. Abortion is il
legal in Indonesia and
Malaysia, both predominantly
Moslem countries, and in the
Philippines, which is 80 percent
Catholic. There is an exception
in Malaysia, but only if it can be
proved that the woman's preg
nancy endangers her life.
Singapore, which is so mod
ernized that it is beyond com
parison with other countries in
the region, has abortion on de
mand if the pregnancy is less
than 24 weeks old.
Dr. Suporn Kerdsawang,
chief spokesman for the pro
abortion forces, said at least 1
million Thai women have il
legal abortions annually. He es
timated that "10,000 of them
are dying at the hands of un
trained quack doctors."
"We are trying to save lives,
not destroy them," said
Suporn, a widely known
gynecologist and family-plan
ning expert.
Thailand has a law that per
mits abortion under only two
circumstances: if the woman's
health would be endangered
by giving birth or in the case of
rape.
The proposed legislation
would, for all practical
purposes, grant abortions on
demand. A woman could get
an abortion if her mental or
physical health was en
dangered, if the child would be
mentally or physically re
tarded, for social or financial
reasons or because a con
traceptive prescribed by a doc
tor did not work.
Advocates say there proba
bly will be an increase in the
number of abortions, at least at
first, if the bill becomes law, bu
they scoff at the idea that wom
en will become more promis
cuous. Sixty percent of the
women seeking illegal abor
tions, they say, are married.
Replying to the argument
that a Buddhist country like
Thailand should not legislate
the taking of a life, Suporn
asked: "Should we then legis
late against the killing of cows
and other animals for food? I
think it is more a matter of what
we are doing it for. Does it bet
ter the condition of the peo
ple?"
