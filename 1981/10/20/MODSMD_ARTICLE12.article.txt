## Distribution dilemma â€” students face new requirements 
### David Jaekle 
Over the past few years, new distribution
requirements have been added to the Stan
ford curriculum, and many students have
found these requirements slightly bewilder
ing. Questions have ranged from "Why must
I take history?" to "Do these things change
all the time?"
Although there have been several recent
changes, distribution requirements are not
altered easily. Any change in the require
ments is the result of research and debate,
culminating in passage by the Faculty Senate.
Changes have been numerous over the
past few decades. In the mid-19505, a general
studies program was passed. This program
consisted of a freshman writing course, a
Western Civilization course, and a series of
other course requirements including eight
units of humanities in at least two of its three
divisions, 10 units in social sciences in at least
two of its seven divisions, and 17 units of nat
ural sciences in one of its two divisions.
Distribution requirements in 1950
Students also had to take a math, logic or
foreign language course and complete a
two-unit senior colloquia.
The idea behind these requirements was
expressed in The Undergraduate in the Uni
versity: "that self-study at Stanford ... may
become a permanent habit of mind." In The

Study of Education at Stanford, printed in
November 1968, the Stanford Steering Com
mittee called for reform of these require
ments because of their "rigidity, super
ficiality, selectiveness and unreality."
Requirements change in 1970
The findings of the steering committee
and other committees of the Academic Sen
ate brought about the decision to drop the
existing general studies program in early
19705. Among the courses dropped was the
Western Civilization requirement dating
from 1935.
In place of the general studies program
came a group of simplified distribution re
quirements which consisted of a freshman
writing course, three courses in the human
ities, three in the social sciences and three in
the sciences.
Western Culture requirement
The first step toward the creation of what
would become the present set of distribu
tion requirements came with the appoint
ment of the Committee on Reform and Re
newal of Liberal Education at Stanford
(CORRIES) by the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
Consisting of 13 faculty members and two
students, the committee was given six
months to find areas that needed change at
Stanford. Among the committee's recom

mendations in January 1975 was a descrip
tion of a Western Culture requirement made
up of a three-quarter sequence of courses in
one of a series of tracks.
In the end, theC-US recommended a two
year pilot Western Culture program over
and above the existing distribution require
ments. In June of 1978, the academic senate
passed the Western Culture Program for the
academic years 1978-79 and 1979-80. The ac
ademic senate passed guidelines for applica
tion, course development and evaluation
put forth by the C-US, with some revision.
Other requirements
Due to the broad nature and number of
other distribution requirements, the need
for a new set of distribution requirements in
conjunction with the newly formed Western
Culture requirements was realized. Lougee
said, "We started at the bottom and worked
our way up. We asked if we even needed dis
tribution requirements and went from
there."
There were other reasons for the call for
new requirements. According to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Norman Wessels,
"We wanted to see a more symmetrical ap
proach to the undergraduate education at
Stanford."

In January 1979, the C-US presented seven
areas to the Academic Senate (along with the
Western Culture requirement), as new dis
tribution requirements. The C-US proposed
the Western Culture to be a three-quarter
series and the other courses to be one quar
ter if possible. "We were aiming for a total of
10 units," Prof. Lougee said.
These seven areas were: 1) literature and
fine arts; 2) philosophical and religious
thought; 3) humandevelopmentandbehav
ior; 4) social processes and institutions; 5)
mathematical sciences; 6) natural sciences;
and 7) technology and applied sciences.
The Academic Senate passed the format
that exists today on Jan. 24, 1980. The C-US
set up seven subcommittees to establish
criteria for the acceptance and disapproval
of courses to satisfy the distribution require
ments.
According to Prof. Paul Seaver, chairman
of the History Department, the professors
usually brought the course they wanted ap
proved to the department chairman and he
in turn presented thecourses broughtto him
to the proper subcommittee. Prof. Lougee
stated, "We had a great deal of faculty in
volvement. Many professors grew more
aware of their own courses because of the
formal process of interviews prescribed by

theC-US."
Some 300 courses were approved and pre
sented to the academic senate by the C-US
from the courses recommended by the sub
committees. The academic senate reviewed
and passed the courses they approved in the
summer of 1980.
President Donald Kennedy said he ap
proves of the new set of requirements and
hopes "they will last for some time."
Future changes
In the next few years, the only foreseeable
change will be a requirement for entering
students to have taken at least three years of
a foreign language in high school or pass an
equivalent foreign language test. This re
quirement will take effect with the entering
class of the 1902-83 academic year.
Freshman Thomas O'Rielly was positive
about the changes. "They (distribution re
quirements) get the engineering majors and
pre-med students to take a look in the liberal
arts, and the liberal arts majors to look at the
technical side of things."
If all goes according to plan, there will be a
period of calm in the field of distribution re
quirements, although periodic changes and
adjustments in the courses offered to satisfy
the requirements will take place as they are
called for.
