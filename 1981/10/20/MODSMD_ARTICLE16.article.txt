## Lauren Saunders Lobbying a hidden cost 
### 
Considerable amounts of ink have
been spilt recently in discussions of
military spending — should we
spend more? less? for AWACS? MX
missiles? The list of topics is endless.
Leaving aside these debates over
amounts, as well as considering of
the merits of various weaponry sys
tems, there is one seemingly obvious
question regarding defense spend
ing which is rarely asked: exactly
what are we paying for?
The answer is not simply "a cruise
missile," or "development of a
Stealth bomber"; much more goes
into the bid for a government con
tract than the mere cost of the weap
on itself. No one is questioning the
inclusion of research costs nor regu
lar business expenses. Hidden in the
total eventually footed by taxpayers,
however, is one item of more
dubious legitimacy: lobbying ex
penses.
Especially in the current political
climate of budget austerity, is it right
that the government pick up the tab
incurred by corporations in the
pursuit of these lucrative contracts?
This is just what has been happening,
as revealed by recently released
audits of 10 major defense contrac
tors conducted by the Defense Con
tract Auditing Agency (DCAA) in
1976 and 1977. (After the Air Force
denied a Freedom of Information Act
request from Common Cause, a
Washington-based public interest
group, the group went to court and
was awarded the audits in January.)
The audits describe millions of
dollars in various lobbying expenses
which are routinely charged against
the bill presented to the govern
ment. This includes everything from
the salaries of defense industry lob
byists themselves, to films made to
promote a given weapon, to enter

tainment items related to the main
tenance of a Washington con
dominium, such as maid service, bar
tenders and silverware.
It must be noted that in most cases
the defense contractors are doing
nothing illegal. "Public relations"
costs are a legitimate business ex
penses which may be included in the
final contract bid. (There are regu
lations prohibiting the inclusion of
purely entertainment or advertising
related expenses, but when ques
tioned regarding items such as foot
ball tickets or yachts, contractors
could claim they had simply made a
mistake.)
To compound the problem, past
efforts to define and subsequently
exclude "lobbying" from other busi
ness expenses have failed. The dis
tinction between legitimate costs in
curred in information gathering and
distribution as opposed to attempts
at influencing legislation is a fine
one, and in many cases the two cate
gories overlap. In fact, defense lob
byists are more often than not de
scribed as "legislative liaisons" —
though the job undoubtedly in
cludes exerting pressure as well as
simply providing information.
Nevertheless, in 1977 the Defense
Acquisition Regulations Council
(which writes the regulationsgovern
ing defense contracting) attempted
to come up with a definition of lob
bying. The recommendation was
circulated for comment throughout
industry and other governmental
agencies and generally received fa
vorable reviews from the latter
group. After the expected strenuous
opposition from the contractors
themselves, however, the issue was
left to fade, the government citing
the impossibility of getting a wide
consensus on the definition.

Naturally, no such attempt is going
to be perfect, nor will it please ev
eryone, least of all those who benefit
from the absence of any restrictions
on lobbying expense. This is not,
however, a valid reason to abandon
attempts at opposing such practices.
Unfortunately, the situation is a vi
cious circle. The DCAA has only an
advisory role to the contracting of
ficer in the Pentagon, and it is the lat
ter who makes the final decision.
Yet especially in light of the cons
tant flow of money and personnel
between the defense contractors and
the executive branch, there is a de
cided need for a check on the power
of the contracting officers. The prob
lem in Congress is similar. Though
members of congress would be in the
position to pass legislation restrain
ing government from paying for the
expenses of the defense lobby, in the
meantime this very money can be
used to pressure them not to do so.
While it is ridiculous to require tax
payers to subsidize a company
goosehunting lodge in Maryland, an
even more dangerous blow to our
political system is the influence
which lobbying money buys. De
fense contractors have every right to
free speech in order to promote their
interests and even to influence legis
lators to support their views. Need
less to say, their opportunities to do
so already greatly outweigh those of
the average citizen, whose voice is
rarely heard. Some of this may be un
avoidable, but it is going more than a
little too far to expect this citizen to
pay for the booming voice of the de
fense industry — whether we agree
with what it is saying or not.
