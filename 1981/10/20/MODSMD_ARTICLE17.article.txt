## Removing litter makes a difference 
### 
Has anyone ever wondered what
happens to the cans, bottles, pizza
slices, malt cartons and Kentucky
Fried Chicken that are left in and
around the football stadium after
each game?
At 7 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 11, while
most of Stanford slept off the effects
of a victory celebration, the members
of the University women's crew met

at the stadium to spend 5Vi back
breaking hours removing debris of
which the above list is merely a small
sample.
This is not the occasion to argue
whether a University team should
have to fund itself by collecting the
garbage left by another sport's spec
tators; the Stanford women's crew

needs the money. What ought to be
said is that the difference between an
ugly task and a hellish one is the
courtesy or carelessness of the foot
ball fans. If you would be a hero, take
your litter out of the stadium when
you leave.
