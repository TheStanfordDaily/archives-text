## Policy doesn't meet housing needs 
### 
We feel compelled to point out the
serious omission in the article "Ceil
ing Set on Residency in Escondido" (
Daily, Oct. 2). We speak as active
members of the Graduate Student
Association (GSA); our purpose is to
point out the real problem con
nected with graduate student hous
ing which University policy has so far
failed to address.
We do not doubt that the new
housing policy — which guarantees
new graduate students one year of
on-campus housing (four years for
students with children) — will con
siderably ease the newcomers' transi
tion to Stanford. However, for the
majority of singleand married gradu
ate students without children, this
new policy is at best a cosmetic solu
tion serving to hide the real problem,
which the Daily article completely ig
nored: the fact that there is simply
not enough on-campus housing, or
affordable housing off campus, to
meet graduate students' needs.
There are presently 1500 units of
graduate housing in Escondido Vil

lage, Crothers Memorial and
Crothers combined; this housing is
allocated among nearly 6000 gradu
ate students. By contrast, 5100 of the
approximately 6500 undergraduates
now live in University housing. Thus,
only 25 percent of graduate students
can now be housed on campus, com
pared to 80 percent of the under
grads.
This means that after his or her first
year, the typical graduate student will
be forced to live off-campus. In fact,
the new policy notwithstanding,
there still isn't enough on-campus
housing for all first-year grad stu
dents plus all married students with
children, should they all wish to be
housed. But off-campus living is
hardly an attractive alternative: as is
well known, rents in the Palo Alto
area are among the highest in the na
tion.
Last year, the average graduate stu
dent living off-campus spent $250 a
month on rent alone, out of a fellow
ship stipend of $360/ month or an as
sistantship stipend of $475/ month.
Not surprisingly, he or she always
teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
Having established that the true
problem is a lack of graduate student
housing, we ask: what is the Univer
sity doing to remedy this situation?
Last week, construction began on 800
new units of undergraduate housing
which, when completed, will allow
all undergraduates four years of on
campus housing. For faculty, the Uni
versity plans to build 140 units of
housing on Peter Coutts Hill and now
proposes to provide housing sub
sidies to new faculty in addition to
the existing subsidized mortgage
program. Yet nothing is even in the
planning stage as regards new gradu
ate housing, except for 350 places of
admittedly temporary housing in
Manzanita Park trailers .which will

not even scratch the surface of the
problem.
The University's insensitivity to
graduate housing needs is evident
throughout its treatment of the
Escondido Village question in thelast
year. When the need for a time limit
on residency in EV was first raised, no
mention was made of plans for a one
year limit. This was first announced
late in the summer, when many peo
ple were away and without an op
portunity for prior comment by the
majority of graduate students. We
question the attitude which allows a
decision affecting nearly one-half
the student body to be made without
a concerted effort to seek student in
put.
Yet this action was fully consistent
with the past treatment of graduate
housing needs. Over the last two
years, Escondido Village rents have
gone up much faster than have grad
uate stipends. Last year, there was
even talk of raising EV rents to pre
vailing off-campus levels, with the
additional revenue to be used in part
to finance the new undergraduate
dorms!
Rather than constructing addi
tional graduate housing and thus
meeting a real need, the University
seems to be moving in the opposite
direction: making graduate housing
sufficiently unattractive (through in
creased rents and enforced turnover)
to rdduce the demand to the existing
level of supply. While new under
graduate dorms are being built and
every effort is made to provide facul
ty with affordable housing, the Uni
versity's policy toward graduate
housing is one of outright neglect.

meet graduate students' needs.
There are presently 1500 units of
graduate housing in Escondido Vil

lage, Crothers Memorial and
Crothers combined; this housing is
allocated among nearly 6000 gradu
ate students. By contrast, 5100 of the
approximately 6500 undergraduates
now live in University housing. Thus,
only 25 percent of graduate students
can now be housed on campus, com
pared to 80 percent of the under
grads.
This means that after his or her first
year, the typical graduate student will
be forced to live off-campus. In fact,
the new policy notwithstanding,
there still isn't enough on-campus
housing for all first-year grad stu
dents plus all married students with
children, should they all wish to be
housed. But off-campus living is
hardly an attractive alternative: as is
well known, rents in the Palo Alto
area are among the highest in the na
tion.
Last year, the average graduate stu
dent living off-campus spent $250 a
month on rent alone, out of a fellow
ship stipend of $360/ month or an as
sistantship stipend of $475/ month.
Not surprisingly, he or she always
teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.
Having established that the true
problem is a lack of graduate student
housing, we ask: what is the Univer
sity doing to remedy this situation?
Last week, construction began on 800
new units of undergraduate housing
which, when completed, will allow
all undergraduates four years of on
campus housing. For faculty, the Uni
versity plans to build 140 units of
housing on Peter Coutts Hill and now
proposes to provide housing sub
sidies to new faculty in addition to
the existing subsidized mortgage
program. Yet nothing is even in the
planning stage as regards new gradu
ate housing, except for 350 places of
admittedly temporary housing in
Manzanita Park trailers .which will

not even scratch the surface of the
problem.
The University's insensitivity to
graduate housing needs is evident
throughout its treatment of the
Escondido Village question in thelast
year. When the need for a time limit
on residency in EV was first raised, no
mention was made of plans for a one
year limit. This was first announced
late in the summer, when many peo
ple were away and without an op
portunity for prior comment by the
majority of graduate students. We
question the attitude which allows a
decision affecting nearly one-half
the student body to be made without
a concerted effort to seek student in
put.
Yet this action was fully consistent
with the past treatment of graduate
housing needs. Over the last two
years, Escondido Village rents have
gone up much faster than have grad
uate stipends. Last year, there was
even talk of raising EV rents to pre
vailing off-campus levels, with the
additional revenue to be used in part
to finance the new undergraduate
dorms!
Rather than constructing addi
tional graduate housing and thus
meeting a real need, the University
seems to be moving in the opposite
direction: making graduate housing
sufficiently unattractive (through in
creased rents and enforced turnover)
to rdduce the demand to the existing
level of supply. While new under
graduate dorms are being built and
every effort is made to provide facul
ty with affordable housing, the Uni
versity's policy toward graduate
housing is one of outright neglect.

We feel compelled to point out the
serious omission in the article "Ceil
ing Set on Residency in Escondido" (
Daily, Oct. 2). We speak as active
members of the Graduate Student
Association (GSA); our purpose is to
point out the real problem con
nected with graduate student hous
ing which University policy has so far
failed to address.
We do not doubt that the new
housing policy — which guarantees
new graduate students one year of
on-campus housing (four years for
students with children) — will con
siderably ease the newcomers' transi
tion to Stanford. However, for the
majority of singleand married gradu
ate students without children, this
new policy is at best a cosmetic solu
tion serving to hide the real problem,
which the Daily article completely ig
nored: the fact that there is simply
not enough on-campus housing, or
affordable housing off campus, to
meet graduate students' needs.
