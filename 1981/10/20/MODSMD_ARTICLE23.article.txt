## Reagan policy prolongs foreign oil fix 
### 
President Ronald Reagan has often been ac
cused of lacking foreign policy direction. His
critics label his policy, or lack thereof, as erratic,
misconceived and misdirected. But any animal
tends to act in an irrational and unpredictable way
when cornered. The leaders of nations are the
same way. It's very difficult to pursue a cohesive
foreign policy when your back is against the wall.
A cornered animal will turn savage in attempts to
gain freedom. Much like this trapped animal, Rea
gan's objective is freedom — freedom from the in
security of the foreign oil supply. In recent years
the United States has become increasingly depen
dent on this foreign oil. The United States has lost
the self-sufficiency that distinguished it from other
nations; it cannot produce all the oil which it con
sumes. The scarcity of oil has greatly added to its
cost. Even worse, the whims of OPEC send the
price of fossil fuels spiraling into the heavens. But
Reagan, instead of decreasing our dependency on
the obviously unpredictable supply, has increased
it.
Without oil, the lifeblood of U.S. industry, Rea
gan's economic plans will grind to a screeching
halt. Inflation, already abetted by oil costs, will
continue to tear huge chunks out of the Gross Na
tional Product (GNP). The balanced budget will be
merely an empty promise. New investment, on
which Reaganomics depends so heavily, will van
ish. Reagan's whole vaunted economic program,
in fact, will collapse'around him.
Reagan has cut off his own escape route by cut
ting funds for alternative energy sources from his
budget, leaving the use of foreign oil as his only
option. His foreign policy is predicated upon keep
ing the lifeblood of U.S. industry pumping through
the nation's veins.
The proposed sale of AWACS to Saudi Arabia is
wholly consistent with this policy. The rationale
given for this sale, the most important foreign poli
l

cy question Reagan has faced, is the protection of
Saudi Arabia from encroachment by the Soviet
Union and its allies. The house of Saud, however, is
most vulnerable to internal strife. Its military is pri
marily mercenary, and listing the warring factions
within the country would fill volumes. In the event
of a revolution incited by Soviet sympathizers, the
most likely case, these sophisticated toys would
end up in Russian hands. The sale may make this
sort of revolution even more imminent.
But Saudi Arabia, like a spoiled child, has
stamped its feet and threatened an oil tantrum if
denied the shiny new playthings. Reagan has no al
ternative but to seek to appease our "moderate
friends." All this is not done in the name of U.S. de
fense interests, mind you, but in the fulfillment of

'The leaders of nations are the
same way. It's very difficult to
pursue a cohesive foreign
policy when your back is
against the wall/

Reaganomics.
The current Libya-Sudan crisis gives even more
damning evidence for Reagan's preoccupation
with oil. Reagan is standing tough against the Lib
yan ruler Col. Moammar Khadafy, and daring him
to invade the Sudan as he has threatened. Also,
Reagan is fully supportive of Hosni Mubarak's em
bryonic regime in Egypt, allied to Sudan. The Presi
dent has provided for military support to be trans
ferred to Egypt. In the next few days, 4000 Ameri
can troups, two AWACS, and B-52 bombers will ar
rive to give Khadafy pause.
This sounds like a convincing show of support.
Reagan has not seen fit, however, to implement

economic sanctions against the Libyans. At a press
conference Monday, Reagan was asked why he
did not stop buying Libyan oil. He replied that this
action was useless, because someone else would
buy the oil and finance Khadafy's activities — "We
would be cutting off our nose to spite our face."
Evidently, we conclude that we should finance
Khadafy's terrorist activities.
Listening to Reagan's words, one believes that
he is working to create bipolar hegemony. He
seeks to divide the world into Russian and Ameri
can spheres of influence. We are the good guys in
white, the protectors of democracy, while the Rus
sians are the evil villains spreading world revolu
tion. It's a simple psychological tactic aimed at
uniting Americans against a common enemy. Rea
gan hopes to recreate all the naivete and positive
euphoria of the 50s. The Russians are also the only
power threatening U.S. interests in the Middle
East.
Looking at Reagan's actions, however, an out
sider would conclude that the United States is an
addict, cringing at the thought of being denied an
other oil fix. Like addicts, we need more and more
to produce an industrial "high" — a rise in output.
Without this fix, the industrial infrastructure would
be reduced to rubble.
The answer to any addiction is not to increase
the use of the addictive. The solution is to
withdraw gradually from the drug, decreasing de
pendency. The U.S. must withdraw from its oil ad
diction. We must find alternative energy sources;
we must use our "American ingenuity" to create
new energy. Reagan's solution, securing a foreign
oil supply, is a short-term answer; furthermore, it
increases our dependency to a dangerous point. In
the long run, Reagan's foreign policy will cripple
the very economy he set about to cure.

President Ronald Reagan has often been ac
cused of lacking foreign policy direction. His
critics label his policy, or lack thereof, as erratic,
misconceived and misdirected. But any animal
tends to act in an irrational and unpredictable way
when cornered. The leaders of nations are the
same way. It's very difficult to pursue a cohesive
foreign policy when your back is against the wall.
A cornered animal will turn savage in attempts to
gain freedom. Much like this trapped animal, Rea
gan's objective is freedom — freedom from the in
security of the foreign oil supply. In recent years
the United States has become increasingly depen
dent on this foreign oil. The United States has lost
the self-sufficiency that distinguished it from other
nations; it cannot produce all the oil which it con
sumes. The scarcity of oil has greatly added to its
cost. Even worse, the whims of OPEC send the
price of fossil fuels spiraling into the heavens. But
Reagan, instead of decreasing our dependency on
the obviously unpredictable supply, has increased
it.
Without oil, the lifeblood of U.S. industry, Rea
gan's economic plans will grind to a screeching
halt. Inflation, already abetted by oil costs, will
continue to tear huge chunks out of the Gross Na
tional Product (GNP). The balanced budget will be
merely an empty promise. New investment, on
which Reaganomics depends so heavily, will van
ish. Reagan's whole vaunted economic program,
in fact, will collapse'around him.
Reagan has cut off his own escape route by cut
ting funds for alternative energy sources from his
budget, leaving the use of foreign oil as his only
option. His foreign policy is predicated upon keep
ing the lifeblood of U.S. industry pumping through
the nation's veins.
The proposed sale of AWACS to Saudi Arabia is
wholly consistent with this policy. The rationale
given for this sale, the most important foreign poli
l

cy question Reagan has faced, is the protection of
Saudi Arabia from encroachment by the Soviet
Union and its allies. The house of Saud, however, is
most vulnerable to internal strife. Its military is pri
marily mercenary, and listing the warring factions
within the country would fill volumes. In the event
of a revolution incited by Soviet sympathizers, the
most likely case, these sophisticated toys would
end up in Russian hands. The sale may make this
sort of revolution even more imminent.
But Saudi Arabia, like a spoiled child, has
stamped its feet and threatened an oil tantrum if
denied the shiny new playthings. Reagan has no al
ternative but to seek to appease our "moderate
friends." All this is not done in the name of U.S. de
fense interests, mind you, but in the fulfillment of

'The leaders of nations are the
same way. It's very difficult to
pursue a cohesive foreign
policy when your back is
against the wall/

Reaganomics.
The current Libya-Sudan crisis gives even more
damning evidence for Reagan's preoccupation
with oil. Reagan is standing tough against the Lib
yan ruler Col. Moammar Khadafy, and daring him
to invade the Sudan as he has threatened. Also,
Reagan is fully supportive of Hosni Mubarak's em
bryonic regime in Egypt, allied to Sudan. The Presi
dent has provided for military support to be trans
ferred to Egypt. In the next few days, 4000 Ameri
can troups, two AWACS, and B-52 bombers will ar
rive to give Khadafy pause.
This sounds like a convincing show of support.
Reagan has not seen fit, however, to implement

economic sanctions against the Libyans. At a press
conference Monday, Reagan was asked why he
did not stop buying Libyan oil. He replied that this
action was useless, because someone else would
buy the oil and finance Khadafy's activities — "We
would be cutting off our nose to spite our face."
Evidently, we conclude that we should finance
Khadafy's terrorist activities.
Listening to Reagan's words, one believes that
he is working to create bipolar hegemony. He
seeks to divide the world into Russian and Ameri
can spheres of influence. We are the good guys in
white, the protectors of democracy, while the Rus
sians are the evil villains spreading world revolu
tion. It's a simple psychological tactic aimed at
uniting Americans against a common enemy. Rea
gan hopes to recreate all the naivete and positive
euphoria of the 50s. The Russians are also the only
power threatening U.S. interests in the Middle
East.
Looking at Reagan's actions, however, an out
sider would conclude that the United States is an
addict, cringing at the thought of being denied an
other oil fix. Like addicts, we need more and more
to produce an industrial "high" — a rise in output.
Without this fix, the industrial infrastructure would
be reduced to rubble.
The answer to any addiction is not to increase
the use of the addictive. The solution is to
withdraw gradually from the drug, decreasing de
pendency. The U.S. must withdraw from its oil ad
diction. We must find alternative energy sources;
we must use our "American ingenuity" to create
new energy. Reagan's solution, securing a foreign
oil supply, is a short-term answer; furthermore, it
increases our dependency to a dangerous point. In
the long run, Reagan's foreign policy will cripple
the very economy he set about to cure.
