## The
						Rolling Stones... Playacting a long run of classic Mom and Pop decadence 
### Tony Kelly 
The Rolling Stones
Candlestick Park/
San Francisco
17 October 1981
You mean there wasn't a
baseball game?
Of course not — the Giants
would never draw that many
people. Even Mick Jagger, the
main reason for the 130,000 ap
pendages of that beast known
as "The Audience" appearing
at the Rolling Stones shows
ever the weekend, wore an
Oakland A's jersey during part
of the two-hour concert. Think
Candlestick Park will ever let
anyone play there again?
The question doesn't really
come to mind, however, since
the entire idea of the stadium
rock show is a dinosaur in to
day's penny-wise culture. Oh
yeah, the Stones did sell out in
impressive amounts of time
when tickets went on sale all
over the country. But the
Stones have transcended the
level of mere rock band — they
are at once an event, a com
modity, and a circus. No other
performer or band in rock can
claim that title, for it is a crown
for a past kingdom.
Indeed,, even the mighty
Stones needed a little help in
making this latest (last?) tour so
successful. Many of the alleged
fans on the scene at
Candlestick were not followers
of the music at all, but rather
curious tourist types who
wanted to know what the buzz
was about. The mass musical
communion of years past has
now become the twenty dollar
peep show. A pretty expensive
way to be hip, if you ask me.
A pretty painful method,
too, if you happened to be at
the Stick on Saturday or Sunday
hoping to see anything. Not
only were there the expected
crushes of humanity-in-grid
lock turning the stadium into a
large economy version of the
Old Waldorf, but the same
folks who camped out, hid out,
and smoked out the night
before the concert were now
startlingly quiet, as if getting a
good spot on the grass (or good
grass on the spot) was really the
focus of the weekend. Any per
former that dared disturb the
splendidly comatose mob was
subtly washed away with a tidal
wave of poiite applause. And
I'm not just talkingabout open
ing acts here. Too bad for the
audience.
But wait just a minute. If the
Rolling Stones' road show ap
peared to be missing some
thing live (and I think it'ssafeto
say it did), then to blame the
fact solely on the audience
would be just as unfair as to
blame it entirely on the head
liners, who didn't even wake
up on Saturday until after
George Thorogood had scut
tled safely offstage after his
opening set. Sure, the au
dience was, by and (very) large,
lifeless and unenthusiastic. But
maybe, just maybe, the reason
why was in the show itself.
Before you start taking down
the wooden cross and heavy
duty nails from the attic, I
should admit — or rather de
clare outright — that I did have
a good time at Candlestick on
Saturday, and that the Rolling
Stones put on a very enjoyable
show. I don't go to a show with
the intention of being disap
pointed or bored any more
than the next guy. I do go to
watch, and to possibly com
municate with the per
formers) in a way that can't be
done in the sterile environ
ment of records. This is known
in the trade as "getting into it".
I also go to review, and this is
where the Stones concert be
gins to trip me up. In a lot of
ways, reviewing this show is
like reviewing the beach, ex
cept you don't get sand in your
toes. For instance, the first
words I heard upon my arrival
at the stadium were, "Need any
acid, man?" (and welcome to
Candlestick Park to you, too).
The audience, though not ex
actly rowdy (a typical 49ers
crowd ranks far higher on the
Disgust-o-Meter), was almost
grotesque in its sheer size, and
thus matched the security
guards perfectly. Still, the at
mosphere was far from in
timidating, and could con
ceivably have provided a good
background for a challenging
band or two to make the event

fit the hype.
And now one runs into prob
lems.
The first act of the festival,
George Thorogood and the
Destroyers, opened the show
close to 11 a.m. As an act,
George and the boys were a
perfectly logical choice to lead
off the day (especially com
pared to Prince in LA and Jour
ney in Philadelphia, who had
the sheer gall to proclaim
themselves "the number one
band in America" — not bad
for an opener). However, as a
musician, Thorogood is a man
without a home.
George Thorogood is a living
Ghost of Rock and Roll, Past
and Present — but certainly not
one for the future. His brand of
electric pyrotechnics and rock
abilly raveups , though proba
bly lifted straight from the Bet
ty Crocker Cookbook of "Hot
Solos", ends up sounding like
the equivalent to a TV dinner.
Look, look, see George
duckwalk across the stage to
that rock 'n' roll music. Go,
Johnny, go. Oh, look and see
George play the guitar over his
head, and 'scuse me while I kiss
the sky. Wow, George and that
big sax player (dressed in black)
can sure dance together across
the stage real well. It's just as if
they were — well, born to run
across that stage. And if you
look real hard, you can also see
the obvious Chuck Berry, Hen
drix, and Springsteen in
fluences following right
alongside George, silently
laughing about how far people
will go when they think they
can entertain others.
What happened to George
Thorogood is common among
younger musicians; he has be
come so tied up in his recrea
tions of the past that his work
becomes nothing more than
rehashes, with the vital ele
ment of soul and/or passion
sorely suffering the hurt. Ac
cordingly, little enthusiasm was
present in the audience during
the short one-hour set, as befits
a man whose idea of com
munication to the audience is a
series of vague fill-in-the-blank
platitudes about California.
That's right, George — keep
'em smiling,and you can stay
on the Stones tour. Say thank
you to the nice band.
The J. Geils Band, next on the
agenda in the early afternoon,
hit upon a much improved au
dience, but for slightly suspect
reasons. Just as George and the
Destroyers were at their best
when playing the safest, most
familiar workhorse tunes, the
Geils band hittheirstride when
deliberately acting as weird as
possible. I suppose there's
nothing really wrong with that
— rock and roll is a freak show
in more ways than one, after all
— but when lead singer Peter
Wolf jumps around like a frog
during the instrumental break
in "Love Stinks", I don't think

Lauren Goldman/Daily
of rock and roll.
Actually, the band did a
good job musically, hitting
upon a much fuller and ori
ginal sound than the De
stroyers. At least in this case,
keyboard synthesizers really
are the best thing since the
wheel. And when some good
old Stax/Motown touches are
added to the songs through a
rickety Farfisa organ (truly one
of my fave instruments), the
songs move in a truly ir
resistible manner.
But still, there are things
about the J. Geils band that
stick in one'scraw — if not your
craw, then mine. For instance,
who really needs a full-time
harmonica player in their
band? Who told Peter Wolf to
jump like that all the time? And
who the hell taught the band
about clothes! Despite some
arresting music, the Geils band
seems to strive for a cartoon
look that doesn't really do
themselves or their fans justice.
This is not to say by any
means that playacting is
detrimental to rock. To the
contrary, a good pose every
now and then provides a much
needed focal point for the au
dience to refer to. Much of the
aura of prodigal son Bruce
Springsteen lies in the belief
that we all know him so well;
and even if that isn't true, that
perception of accessibility
makes Springsteen the source
of inspiration that he un
deniably is.
The Rolling Stones play their
roles as characters too, and that
fact was evident Saturday at
Candlestick. Each band mem
ber was in true form; Mick Jag
ger singing and dancing as if his
life depended on it, Keith Rich
ards and Ron Wood grinding
out the most polished "raw
guitar" sound in the world, Bill
Wyman and Charlie Watts
playing tortoises to Mick's
hare. But there's another
dimension to the roleplaying
onstage — one of basic charac
ter development.
The Stones have been reap
ing the benefits of a mini-ren
aissance recently, based on
their newfound "maturity" in
music and lyrics. But whatever
that maturity may have
brought about in their minds,
their stage show is still the
Mom and Pop decadence of
the past ten (or more) years. It
is this discrepancy that points
up both the success and failure
of the Candlestick Park show.
The medium of rock and roll
as a form of expression de
pends more than anything else
on change — the eternal con
flict of emotions in human na
ture. To deny the process of
time and try to remain in stasis
not only saps the performer of
his strength, but cheats the au
dience of a fresh perspective
provided by a favorite artist.
This is truer in rock than in any
other medium, for rock is more

dependent on the youth ideal.
Mick Jagger, by trying to
hold back the clock for 20
years, unfortunately shows a
chink in the armor through his
stubborn determination to
never grow old. The Stones are
praised for their maturity, yet
Jagger refuses to build on this
base, instead remaining on the
same path that carried them to
stardom in 1964. Indeed, "Time
is on My Side" was performed
in the show Saturday. That's a
lot of playacting.
But on the other hand, per
haps the popularity of the Roll
ing Stones is due to this very
consistency. By staying the
same throughout faster-burn
ing trends, the Stones build a
sort of credibility with their au
dience. For a similar example,
look to the resurgence in pop
ularity of the Doors in recent
years. Let's face it — jim Mor
rison is a romantic figure, and
his mystery is heightened by
the fact that he is dead. It's
alright, then, to trust the Doors
never to change. Morrison
won't let his audience down by
turning Christian on them, or
retiring to a sedate and se
cluded home life, away from
the fans. By retreating to their
classic stance of youth in re
bellion, the Rolling Stones
keep in touch with an audience

not of their peers, but their de
scendants.
Of course there is another
crucial difference: the Rolling
Stones are still alive. But it is
one thing to be alive and quite
another to be living. At the
show at Candlestick Park Satur
day, the Stones fans around me
wasted little time getting into
(that term again) the older
songs that were played, and for
me, "You Can't Always Get
What You Want" was a major
highlight. But when the band
started to play newer material,
the general response was like
finding a stain on the counter
in a greasy spoon — it's ex
pected, but still not very pleas
ant. And as for "Start Me Up",
well, next time you see Keith
Richards give him this dead
horse to flog for me, OK?
Last Saturday the Rolling
Stones were what they have
been for twenty years now:
vain, derivative, superbly tal
ented, charismatic, smart, and
rich. In short, they are classic
British heroes for the American
audience. That role carries a lot
of weight with it, and so per
haps it is better that the Stones
hold on to it, sacrificing their
further development in favor
of continued success. Some
how, I don't think they're com
plaining.
