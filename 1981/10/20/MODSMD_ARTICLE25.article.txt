Tattoo You
Rolling Stones Records
One of these days the Rolling Stones
are going to put out an album of what
they call "new" material without ever
having to write or record the songs. At
lantic Records will just find some tech
nically adroit producer to amalgamate
excerpts from past Stones songs so as to
make the cuts on the album sound like
they are new ones. "The world's
greatest rock and roll band" will again
hit the top of the charts, with what will
be nothing more than a highly dis.-
guised anthology album.
Upon listening to the Stones' newes,t
release Tattoo You, the question that
must be asked is whether perhaps such
an album has already arrived. Is it really
pure coincidence that there are no
credits given on the albirm? What's
needed here is not a review of Tattoo
You, but rather some investigative re
porting.
Reviews , however, are a lot easier
than investigations, so in the true spirit
of the Glimmer Twins the more leisure
ly and convenient route will be taken in
approaching this new Stones record.
Though it is certainly enjoyable to poke
fun at such hard-luck cases as Mick Jag
ger and Keith Richards, the fact is that
their formula for pop music creation
has worked quite well over the last dec
ade and a half; an album like Tattoo You
, which fuses a lot of these past for
mulaic elements, certainly shows few
signs of creative energy, but in so doing
gives most Stones fans exactly what they
want.
Throughout the 70s, the Rolling
Stones were never on the vanguard of
the popular music scene; rather, their
strength lied in taking established musi
cal trends and incorporating them into
the patented Stones sound. Probably
the best recent example of this was
1978's Some Girls, in which trends such
as disco, Motown, and coun
try/western all served as bases for songs
on the album; nothing new was created
by the Stones, but there was a lot of ma
terial that sounded new for the Stones.
Now that the 80s have begun under a
dearth of new musical trends (none
with wide appeal, that is), the Rolling
Stones have found themselves in a
dilemma: who do they reach to? In lis
tening to Tattoo You, it seems as though
the answer is past Stones' material, sim
ply because such material is as popular
as anything else right now. In a sense,
the Stones have begun to steal their
own material because there is nothing
else to steal.
The first side of Tattoo You, surely the
weaker side, is truly illustrative of this
point. The guitar licks on the side's
opener, "Start Me Up", are so familiar
sounding that one might guess Keith
Richards performed them during one
of his blood transfusions. The songs
"Hang Fire" and "Neighbors" are basic
rockers which seem to appear on the
album to please the younger Stones
fans who are going to like anything fast
and loud, as well as to provide Mick
with something to dance to when the
guys play this material live. "Black Lim
ousine" is the token "Isn't it good to
hear the Stones playing R & B again"
song on the album (cf. "Down in the

Hole" from Emotional Rescue). "Little T
& A" appears only because the Stones
need at least one song on every album
to bother the feminists {of course they
don't really mean any harm,. . .).
Side One's only saving grace is
"Slave", which features some amazing
saxophone work by Sonny Rollins that
contributes a hypnotic jazz finish remi
niscent of the end of "Can You Hear Me
Knocking" from Sticky Fingers.
Clearly, it is the material on Side Two
that has led to all the recent talk about
how the Rolling Stones have
"matured"; rather than dealing with
sex, drugs, and the usual hedonism, the
lyrical themes center around fear, need
for companionship, and self-doubt.
Again, however, it is not as if the boys —
er, men — have never dealt with such
subjects before; one need only re
member such songs as "Can't Akvays
Get What You Want" or "Wild Horses".
Side Two opens with the song that
makes it clear that Mick still has hopes
of someday winning the"Black ( Vocalist
of the Year" award; "Worried About
You" features Jagger utilizing the same

vocal style he did at the beginning of
"Emotional Rescue" (thank you,
Smokey Robinson) in order to sing lyr
ics which seem to be a sequel to "Miss
You".
The final four songs, oddly enough
the finest on the album, take the lis
tener back to the Stones' early-to
mid-70s sound. "Tops" and "No Use in
Crying" move at the kind of deliberate,
dragged-out pace (Mick whining the
lyrics) that made so many of the songs
on Exile on Main Street so effective.
"Heaven", in which Mick's vocals are

intentionally made diffici/ft t tQ under
stand as he sings in- a high-pitched,
ethereal kind of voice, is almost a twin
brother to Exile's "Just Wanna See His
Face".
The final song on the album, "Wait
ing on a Friend" has been taken by
many to be the true sign that lagger has
mellowed. Indeed, the lyrics to the
SQng show Jagger at his most sentimen
tal ("I need someone I can cry to, I need
someone I can trust"). Whatever hap
pened to songs like "Star, Star" with
Jagger singjng "if I ever get back to New
York girl, gonna make you jump all
night"? | '
But again, Jagger has
cated "what happens after physical
pleasure" songs before; what is truly
sophisticated about "Waiting on a
Friend", as well as the second side of
Tattoo You, is the music that backs the
songs up. The group provides a kind of
polished sound that is quite rare for the
Stones. In other words, the cuts on Side
Two probably work better on record
than live.
Since this review began on a negative

note, it might as well end on a positive
one. Are the Rolling Stones still the
world's greatest rock band? Let's put it
this way: at least they don't release
three-record sets when they have only
one record of material (yeah, that's a
low blow at the Clash, but that's what
they get for making their whole Ameri
can tour twenty-one nights in New York
City). Though it is true that virtuallly ev
ery song on Tattoo You show 1 ] vestiges
of past Stones songs, at least the group
chose to steal a lot of fine material from
a worthy source — themselvesi
