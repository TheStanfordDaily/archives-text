# Checking out the Motels
## 
### Greg Mills The Motels 
The Keystone/Palo Alto
14 October 1981
The time of the Motels is at hand. Playing
at the Keystone on Wednesday night after
recently emerging from the recording stu
dio, Martha Davis and Co. gave a show which
should erase any doubts about their future as
a band. This bunch is here to stay. After
opening acts by Blade Brown and an un
bearable, pretentious LA band called Catch
playing (non)music amid shouts for the
Motels, the audience was finally gratified by
a warm, fun, and classy performance.
First of all, you're probably wondering if
Martha Davis, vocalist, guitarist and lead
presence in the Motels, looks as great in per
son as she does on the album covers. Let's

just say that most of the guys at the front of
the stage seemed to forget completely about
the women by their sides, especially when
Martha came and sat on the edge of the stage
or ventured out onto the dance floor. Her
wide eyes, tousled hair, oversized dress, and
even the chipped fingernail polish on her
toenails gave her an appealing little-girl
charm, and also gave the audience a feeling
of closeness with her that is far too seldom
achieved, even in clubs. Martha's uniquely
soft, sexy vocals were backed very proficient
ly by the four male members of the band,
each of whom seemed to have quite a bit of
personality and (God forbid) fun.
As loyal Motels fans all know, the group
has put out two albums so far: The Motels
and Careful. However, they were obviously
not hindered by any lack of material. They
played new songs for nearly half of their set,
some of which will be on their next album,
scheduled for release in February.
The performance started out in relatively
mellow fashion, with the band taking a little
time to get warmed up. A number of slower
songs were played, culminating with "Total
Control', with a saxophone solo by erstwhile
keyboard player Marty Jourard.
After receiving a round of applause forthis
solo, Jourard seemed to come alive, and the
rest of the band also loosened up as they
began to pick up the tempo and more peo
ple started dancing. Martha began to take off
articles of clothing here and there, Jourard
started getting wild at the keyboards, and
soon everyone was having a great time. Even
lead guitarist Tim McGovern, looking some
what like a frontal lobotomy victim, began to
liven up, playing some very impressive solos.
During the hour and a half concert, the
band played most of the songs from both
albums, as well as some very good sounding
new ones. Judging by the songs played, the
new Motels album will not be radically dif
ferent from the other two, but will be a natu
ral progression of their same basic sound,
with still more new rhythms and interesting
lyrics.
After leaving the stage, the band was
called back twice for encores that included
"Porn Reggae," "People, Places and
Things," and "Anticipating," and left the au
dience very enthusiastic and very up. The
Motels play new music; they play it well,
they have fun -Joing it, and they let the au
dience join in the fun. It's comforting to
know that some bands can still do all that
once in a while.
The Motels' music is very innovative and
interesting, but seems to appeal to only a
certain kind of musical taste, as witnessed by

the group's limited popularity through two
albums. In concert, though the songs are the
same, the appeal is much greater due to the
presence of Martha Davis. However, the
songs themselves deserve more credit than
they generally receive. The lyrics are intrigu
ing, and certainly not full of cliches. The
rhythms created by interaction between Mc-
Govern's guitar and Brian Glaslock's drums,
especially apparent in "Envy", are unique,
and Martha Davis' vocals, while not especial
ly powerful, are definitely inimitable.
With the combination of uniquely appeal
ing vocals and tight backup instrumentals,
the Motels have a sound all their own, and
that sound is bound to catch on sooner or
later. Bands that sound like other bands are
expendable, and generally the world would
be much better off without them. But the
Motels are a first-rate band, and are really
needed if modern music is to continue to
evolve.
