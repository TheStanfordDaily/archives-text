### Mike Halo 
Gary US Bonds/Kim Carnes
The Warfield Theatre/San Francisco
11 October 1981
There is something very unnatural
about seeing a rock act in a hall designed
for the presentation of plays or movies.
The Warfield Theatre in San Francisco is a
prime example: while lots of money has
gone into light, and sound equipment,
there's no getting around — or should I
say past — that proscenium arch, which
serves as a very effective Iron Curtain be
tween performer and audience.
Beyond that, there are the theater seats,
which prohibit jumping and.dancing on
the spectator's part, and would probably
further discourage the perfprmer from
mingling, if he dared to jump down off
the stage in the first place; and the
cramped stage itself, which limits move
ment even further.
Be that as jt may, there's something
even more unnatural about the way rock
acts are scheduled in the city — for some
mysterious reason, most of the best of
them (mainstream, anyway) take place at
the Old Waldorf and at the boring, un
comfortable Warfield Theatre. Which is
why I found myself there, at the Warfield,
last week, scrunched up in a theater seat
and praying that Kim Carnes would lose
her voice so that Gary U.S. Bonds could
come on early.
Looking back, it's obvious that the most
unnatural thing about the whole evening
was how Kim Carnes, after stinking up the
joint for an hour and a quarter, received a
long and loud standing ovation.
Carnes, as everyone must know by
now, recorded "Bette Davis Eyes," a rath
er trivial, monotonous song which still
represents the cream of her oeuyre. All of
Carnes's songs sound the same to begin
with, and this is reinforced by her rough,
throaty voice; it grabs you the first time
you hear "Bette Davis Eyes" on the radio,
but after an hour of hearing it march re
lentlessly back and forth across the same
five notes, you've had enough for a life
time. The only Carnes original that sticks
in my mind is a song called "Say You
Don't Know Me" (slated for her next
album), which bears an uncanny thematic
and lyrical resemblance to "Walk On By"
(a much better song).
Carnes's biggest problem isn't her
songs or her singing, though; it's some
thing in the way she moves. I have never
seen a professional entertainer with a
more painful lack of stage presence than

Kim Carnes. She appears to gradu
ated from the Barry Manilow.School of
stage movement — she stomps stiffly
around stage, doing occasional deep
knee bends when she can find the beat,
and ends most songs by pointing and star
ing at the ceiling (she looks best in profile,
and the light men do tricky things with
spotlights along her outstretched arm).
Luckily, she was worst on her opening
song, a cover of "Under My Thumb," dur
ing which she continually pretended to
squash the audience under fjier thumb.
After that, nothing sh£ did could seem
too embarrassing. (Whoever her ar
ranging managed the not irlcdnsiderable
feat of making "Under My Thumb"
sound exactly like "Bette Davis Eyes,"
complete with synthesized handclaps.)
Stage presence is a very intangible
thing, of course — discussions of it in
evitably end with, "Well, he/she has it,
and that's that." Gary U.S. Bonds has it
coming out his ears, but I couldn't begin
to explain what "it" is that makes that
true. Bonds (for whom Carnes was the
warm up) had some obyious things going
for him — better songs (several of which
were written by Steve Van Zandt and
Bruce Springsteen) and a better band
(particularly sax man' Joey Stan) — but I
have a feeling that with Carnes's songs,
and her band, he still woGId have put on a
great show. And the band probably
would have sounded better.
What sets Bonds apdrt, I think, is ex
perience and a great defil of courage. He
has the experience — 18 years of playing
second-line clubs and halls between his
last two albums — because of the
courage. It's the same force that lets him
get away with doing
a doo-wop cover of "The Pretender." In
concert, he tells a funny story (Bonds, like
Springsteen, talks to his audience; most
rock performers alternately exhort and
insult them) about how "Bruce and
Steve" promised to protect him if jackson
Browne didn't like the song. But when he
sings it, you can tell that it was his idea all
along, and that he never doubted himself
for a minute.
Watching Bonds brings to mind a line
from another StevejiVan Zandt song: "I
know he's talkin' bout the,way I feel/And
I don't want to go home.'/ Especially not
when going home means walking out
onto Market Street at night. Gary
Bonds can make even the Warfield
Theatre seem like home. j
