Solidarity vows self-restraint
Warsaw — The Solidarity free trade union
movement, in its first official reaction to new
challenges issued by the Communist Party Cen
tral Committee over the weekend, pledged yes
terday to end "unjustified protests," but
warned against "decisions which might sharpen
"the situation and be conducive to social con
flict."
The reaction came in a telegram sent by the
union's leadership to local units around the
country.
In individual reactions, meanwhile, some Sol
idarity officials suggested that the resignation of
Stanislaw Kania and his succession as party chief
by Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski may ease rela
tions between the party and the free trade
union movement.
Half of Poland's provinces "are plunged into
strikes, threatened strikes, and strike alerts due
to food," according to the official PAP news
agency. The most serious work stoppage is in
the textile center of Zyrardow, where workers
completed their seventh day on strike Monday
in a protest over food shortages.
Western analysts here, meanwhile, ques
tioned yesterday whether the Parliament would
pass a party-proposed strike ban, knowing that
Solidarity considers the right to strike the cor
nerstone of its gains since it emerged from na
tionwide protests in the summer of 1980. Even if
Parliament did enact such a ban, the analysts
said, it would be unenforceable. "I think most
of the Polish leadership, no matter on what side
they find themselves, know this," one diplomat
added.
New budget strategy devised
Washington — White House officials reached
agreement Sunday with Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) on a new budget plan
that would cut less in spending and raise more
in revenues than President Ronald Reagan re
quested last month, according to sources.
The plan, roughly in line with a strategy de
veloped by Senate Republican leaders last Fri
day, is aimed at reaching Reagan's goal of more
than $100 billion in new savings by 1984.
But, the sources said, it falls $2.5 billion to $3
billion short of Reagan's target of $16 billion in
additional savings — on top of $35 billion al
ready approved by Congress — for the 1982 fis
cal year that began Oct 1.
As recommended by Senate leaders, only $5
billion to $6 billion would be cut from ap
propriations, in contrast to the $10.4 billion that
Reagan recommended. Reagan had proposed
that $2 billion be cut from spending increases
planned for the Pentagon, with the rest to be
cut from non-defense programs. Senate Ap
propriations Committee Chairman Mark Hat
field (R-Ore.) has proposed a cut of $4 billion
from defense and other Senate sources have
said $3 billion in defense cuts are likely...
The major difference between the con
gressional and administration proposals comes
in the area of revenues, with the agreement call
ing for $48 billion in new revenues over the
three-year period, or about double what Rea
gan proposed.
The compromise — reached between Ma
jority Leader Baker and White House chief of
staff James Baker, presidential counselor Edwin
Meese and Office-of Management and Budget
Director David Stockman — reflected con
gressional anxiety over further heavy budget
cuts in the wake of deep cutbacks in domestic
spending that Congress approved last summer
at Reagan's behest.

The accord is also seen as relieving pressure
that has been building in Congress for a deferral
of the big individual income tax cuts that Con
gress also approved last summer.
Haig concealed Nixon junket
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig helped arrange former president Richard
Nixon's four-nation Mideast tour without in
forming President Ronald Reagan or anyone in
the White House, White House officials said
Sunday.
Dean Fischer, Haig's spokesman, denied that
Haig did any more than supply the former presi
dent with briefing books on the countries he
planned to visit.
But according to the White House version,
presidential counselor Edwin Meese and chief
of staff James Baker were angry that the Nixon
trip was kept secret from them and Reagan and
puzzled why Haig, who was Nixon's top White
House aide in the last months of his adminis
tration, acted in secret.
Haig's action reawakened feelings in the
White House that the secretary of state is not
willing to subordinate himself as part of a Rea
gan team.
The major unanswered question about Nix
on's four-nation trip is whether it served Rea
gan well or badly. No president wants to have a
former president play the role of statesman in
foreign capitals unless there is close coordi
nation between the former president and the
White House.
Reagan seeks voting changes
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has
belatedly served notice he believes provisions
of the voting rights bill the House passed earlier
this month are "pretty extreme," and he will
seek weakening amendments in the Senate.
An aide said yesterday one amendment un
der consideration would increase significantly
what the government has to prove to find a state
or local jurisdiction in violation of the act. It
would require the government to prove not
only that minority-group members were ex
cluded from public office or denied the right to
vote by local election laws, but also that the of
ficials responsible for the local laws intended
the discrimination.
Opponents say such a change would cripple
further efforts to open up all-white city coun
cils, school boards and commissions to minority
groups, and that the offering of such a proposal
could put Reagan on a collision course with
House Republicans who overwhelmingly voted
to support the bill as passed.
The administration avoided taking a specific
position on the voting rights bill as it moved eas
ily through the Democratic House. The bill is
now expected to have a much more difficult
time in the Republican Senate, where conserva
tive Sen. Strom Thurmond(R-S.C) has not
scheduled it for hearings before his Judiciary
Committee until January.
Earlier this month, the House by a lopsided
vote of 389-24 passed an extension of the 1965
voting rights act with a provision stating explicit
ly that the government need not prove intent to
discriminate to find a violation.
The Civil Rights Act specifically spells out that
there is no need to prove intent, and until a con
troversial Supreme Court decision last year,
there was no precedent for requiring proof of
intent under the Voting Rights Act.
But in a split vote approved by only four of
the justices, the Supreme Court found in 1980
that the Constitution "does not entail the right
to have Negro candidates elected" and that the

city of Mobile, Alabama, was not deliberately
discriminating against blacks when it enacted
an at-large system of electing its commissioners
in 1911.
Lawyers say that it is virtually impossible for
them to prove intent in racial discrimination
cases.
1.2 million sign Watt petition
Washington — The Sierra Club brought 1.2
million signatures demanding the ouster of In
terior Secretary James Watt to the Capitol steps
yesterday in what the group claimed was the
largest citizen petition ever presented to Con
gress.
Sierra Club volunteers from 46 states lined up
in front of a banner proclaiming "More than 1
million Americans know Watt's Wrong" and
presented the signatures as the culmination of a
six-month "Dump Watt" campaign.
"We and millions of Americans believe Sec
retary Watt and his programs are radically out of
step with what the people want as our policy
toward natural .resources and the environ
ment," said Sierra Club President Joseph Fon
taine.
Doug Baldwin, Watt's chief spokesman, at
tacked the petition drive as a media event
aimed at getting new members and money for
the Sierra Club.
Environmental leaders said they now planned
to broaden their attack to include all of Rea
gan's environmental policies as part of an effort
to bring out the "green vote" and make the en
vironment an issue in the 1982 congressional
elections.
Court considers death penalty
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to rule on a major undecided ques
tion concerning capital punishment in a case
that could decide the fate of scores of death
row inmates across the United States.
The justices said that they would decide
when, if ever, a person may be sentenced to die
for the crime of felony murder — that is, for par
ticipation in a serious crime that resulted in
death, even if the death was actually caused by
someone else.
The case the court will review involves Earl
Enmund, who is now on death row at the Flori
da State Prison.
Enmund was convicted of felony murder for
his role in the robbery of Thomas and Eunice
Kersey, an elderly couple found murdered in
Hardee County, Florida, six years ago.
No one has been executed for the crime of
felony murder in the United States since 1955,
according to the records of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund.
Stocks continue decline
New York — The stock market continued its
retreat yesterday after the Reagan adminis
tration conceded the nation is undergoing a re
cession and new indicators emerged of a declin
ing economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which tumbled 21.31 points last week, dropped
another 4.56 points to close at 847.13.
Today's weather
