# Colleagues shower laureate with praise, parties

An afternoon party in the Physics Lab capped off
a hectic but joyful day in that department, follow
ing the announcement of Prof. Arthur Schawlow's
sharing in the Nobel Prize for Physics.
"There were a lot of real intense people studying
in the library and the head of the department came
in and said 'I'm sorry to have to ask you all to leave
but we have to set up for a party,'" said junior jen
nifer Seymour. "It was great — he started apologiz
ing but then he said, 'This doesn't happen very
often but then we don't win a Nobel Prize very
often, either."
J. Dirk Walecka, chairman of the department,
later called the prize an honor for Stanford as well
as Schawlow. "I'm absolutely delighted that he was
recognized, especially since all the work has been
done in the Stanford Physics Department."

The jovial Schawlow, who is often seen tooling
around the campus on his moped, joked to those
at the party, "It must be some other guy."
However, among most of the Laureate's col
leagues and University President Donald Kennedy,
who called Schawlow a "distinguished researcher,
teacher and citizen of Stanford University," there
was little doubt that the award had gone to the
right man.
"I thought he should have gotten it a long time
ago," said Don Lyons, one of Schawlow's graduate
student assistants.
Alluding to the fact that Schawlow was not
awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964, when it had been
predicted that both he and his co-researcher and
brother-in-law Charles Townes would receive it
(Townes shared the prize that year with two Rus
sian scientists), doctoral physics student Tony Tay
lor noted "It would have been more appropriate

before, but it certainly is appropriate now." The
most important thing, he said, was that Schawlow's
distinguished career was finally recognized.
Meanwhile, students reported difficulty in con
centrating in lectures today — especially the Phys
ics 55 9 a.m. section which received a visit from the
newly distinguished Nobel Laureate.
Schawlow stopped by on his way to a press con
ference and told the class, "A while ago I found out
I was a very stupid person. But fortunately there
are a lot of other stupid people and there are a lot
of simple things that haven't been discovered. I
hope all of you can discover some of them and win
a Nobel Prize."
"It wasn't very easy to teach today," conceded
Prof. Theo Hansch, a close associate of Schawlow's.
"Everyone is jubilant. It's wonderful."
