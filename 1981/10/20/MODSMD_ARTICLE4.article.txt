# USGS restates tremblor warning

### Jonathan Greene 
Recent observations have led
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
to reaffirm its "hazard watch"
state for Southern California, ac
cording to a letter sent to the state
Office of Emergency Services.
The letter, dated Oct. 9, cited
variations in radon gas em
missions from wells and soil, re
ports of water level changes and
continued significant seismic ac
tivity in Southern California. This
activity, according to the USGS,
may be a secondary indication of
stress and strain below the earth's
surface, which preceeds earth
quakes.
The watch, which has been in
effect since July 1980, is the sec
ond of three possible alert states
and indicates "that a potential
catastrophic event of generally
predictable magnitude may occur
within an indefinite time (possibly
months or years)." No stronger
warning has been issued.
In a press conference yesterday,
USGS spokesman James Dieterich
explained that the USGS has been
monitoring radon emissions in
California from soil since 1975 and
more recently from wells, to de
termine its usefulness as a predic
tor, Emissions of radon, a radio

active gas, had increased sharply
prior to three past earthquakes in
China.
There are nearly 100 radon
monitors around the state, includ
ing one in Portola Valley near the
University. "Almost every site has
had fluctuations in radon levels,"
Dieterich said, though he added
that this could be unrelated to
seismic hazards.
USGS geologists' immediate
concern is Southern California.
The last "great earthquake" there
occurred in 1857, 124 years ago.
Dieterich put the "repeat time" at
about 140 years, give or take 10 to
20 years.
Also, widespread deformation,
or stretching and shrinking of the
earth's surface, was picked up by
the USGS monitoring network in
Southern California in 1978. The
activity coincided with a marked
increase in the level of earth
quakes of magnitude 5.0 and
above. Dieterich noted that these
surface actions are more reliable
indicators of an impending major
earthquake than the radon and
water findings.
"Most earth scientists don't ex
pect a Northern California earth
quake until after Southern Cali
fornia," he said.

FAKE QUAKE â€” These are but a few of the victims in last spring's
earthquake simulation. The drill's purpose was to determine
how well Stanford emergency teams could respond in the event
of a large quake.
