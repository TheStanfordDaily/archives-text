# New program could reduce cancers

Stanford medical economist David
Eddy has developed a program which
he claims could reduce by more than
25 percent the mortality and costs re
lated to four different types of
cancer.
In a study on the economic impact
of cancer prepared for the American
Cancer Society (ACS), Eddy said a
simple cancer-control program in in
dustry would prevent about 17,000
workers from dying of cancer every
year.
The study focuses on four major
types of cancer — lung, colon,

cervical and breast — which have
been shown to have a high cure rate
and fast recovery if detected and
treated early. The program Eddy sug
gests includes:
— Pap tests at least every three
years for women workers between
the ages of 20 and 65;
— Breast examinations yearly for
female workers between the ages of
20 and 65;
— Testing of stools annually for
men and women between 50 and 65
years age; and
— Campaigns designed to stop
workers from smoking.
Spokespersons from various in
dustries in the Santa Clara Valley

stated that similar programs are al
ready in effect, but that they would
be unwilling to require employees to
undergo physical examinations on
any basis.
"We certainly encourage our em
ployees to become aware of preven
tive measures such as the ones sug
gested in the study," said Katie Nut
ter of the Hewlett-Packard public re
lations office. "But we will not re
quire mandatory examinations, as
that crosses the fine line of invasion
of privacy."
Nutter said her company invites
the ACS to give classes to employees
on the seven early warning signs for
cancer, and also classes in how to quit

smoking.
"We have registered nurses at ev
ery site, and if anyone looks sick, they
will recommend a physical,"she said.
"The only time we require an ex
amination is if the individual is being
hired to do heavy physical labor,
such as lifting heavy boxes."
Eddy's study estimated that Ameri
can industry would save $800 million
annually and workers would save
$2.8 billion in lost wages. He deduced
these figures by calculating costs of
time lost from work, sick leave, salary
for temporary substitutes, per
manent employee replacements and
lost future earnings.
"It's very difficult to calculate how
much money cancer alone detracts
from the industry," said a spokes
person for the Eastman Kodak Co.
medical office. "In the three years
I've been here we've had four cases,
which seems to be a 'normal' rate."
Kodak also provides a physician on
site twice a week for employees who

have requested a physical exam.
Eddy studied statistics of 62 million
workers in private industry, two
thirds of the U.S. work force. Of
those workers, more than 120,000 de
velop cancer each year, and about
half that number die of the disease.
According to the ACS, the cost of
caring for these patients is over $1.2
billion.
