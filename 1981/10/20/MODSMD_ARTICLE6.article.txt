# Student groups to cosponsor concerts
## 
### Kirk Kernen 
The Pablo Cruise concert sched
uled last month could have marked
the return of concerts to Frost Am
pitheater. Despite its cancellation,
however, students can expect to see
more concerts here, according to
staff members from the newly
formed University Events and Ser
vices office.
On Sept. 1, Public Services merged
with the Office of Public Events to
become University Events and Ser
vices. Full-time professionals now
collaborate with ASSU organizations

to bring concerts here.
Before autumn quarter 1980, the
ASSU stopped sponsoring concerts
because of the large financial losses
they incurred with each one, accord
ing to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons. Last year the ASSU lost nearly
$100,000, and their loss can be mainly
attributed to the debts absorbed
from the concerts, he said. To avoid
draining all the funds in their treas
ury, the ASSU discontinued Special
Events, its concert sponsoring
project, Lyons said.
To examine the nature of the

losses, the ASSU set up a task force,
whose findings, according to Vicki
Holt, director of University Events
and Services, indicated that the losses
suffered by ASSU Special Events
could be largely traced to mis
management. It was decided to turn
over the management of concerts
and other entertainment to Public
Services, now University Events and
Services.
In addition to this new service, the
Committee on Contemporary Enter
tainment was organized about six
months ago by Lyons. This commit

tee reviews proposals for concerts
and integrates the efforts of the Uni
versity sponsor and the event's man
ager in order to produce the event
most economically.
The Pablo Cruise concert was pro
posed in August through the joint ef
fort of the Student-Alumni Network
(STAN) and the Stanford Alumni As
sociation. Margot Nelson, director of
Classes and Student Services for the
Alumni Association, said the pro
posal had to be approved by the
Committee on Contemporary Enter
tainment. After the approval, STAN
worked with University Events and
Services to negotiate a plausible con
tact.
Holt explained that STAN was co
sponsoring the concert with Bill
Graham Productions.
"We had very clearly expected to
make a profit. The arrangements
were made so that Bill Graham guar
anteed us a set amount of money and
a percentage of the gate; plus they

agreed to pay all University expenses.
"There were already 700 tickets
sold two weeks before the concert
. . . they were $11 apiece, $9 for Stan
ford students," Holt added.
Holt said she estimated a profit of
around $70,000. That money, she
said, would be channeled back to
STAN to support other areas within
the organization.
Lyons said he had no objections to
other concerts coming to Stanford.
"The idea, I applaud," he said.
