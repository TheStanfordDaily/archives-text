A renovation project for Cub
berley Auditorium that will improve
the building's classroom and
cinematic capabilities was recently
approved by the Board of Trustees.
According to project manager Clif
ford Morse, the primary considera
tion of the renewal will be the estab
lishment of "functional sight lines for
all of the seats in the auditorium to
the platform."
Morse explained, "As it is now, the
seats are arranged one behind the
other. The renewal will stagger the
seating in an attempt to have an ade
quate view for the whole auditorium.

This will improve the building's aca
demic function, which is the primary
objective of the project."
The auditorium has not been used
for classes in the last few years be
cause seats are worn and uncom
fortable, according to Morse. He said
the seats were considered to be of
excellent quality when they were first
installed in 1930, but "50 years is a
long time."
The reason the building was not
renovated earlier, Morse said, was
because of "funding priorities. There
were other projects on campus that
needed urgent attention. Now it's
Cubberley's turn."

Morse indicated that $600,000 in
project costs is budgeted for the ren
ovation. The money comes from the
University capital reserve fund,
augmented by contributions from an
alumnus in Southern California.
Morse said he would not reveal the
name of the donor, but indicated the
contribution was made with specific
objectives in mind.
"I can say that his concern is prima
rily with the improvement of the
cinematic capabilities of the
auditorium and having these
capabilities brought up to contem
porary standards," said Morse.
Cubberley is currently used for the

Saturday night Chaparral movies.
Morse said he hopes the auditorium
will also house expert panels, poetry
readings, and small drama groups
once the seating realignment is com
pleted.
Design for the renewal has begun,
and schematic drawings will be sub
mitted formally to the board in De
cember. Construction is expected to
start in May 1982 and to conclude by
next September.
Morse emphasized that the reno
vation project is essential. "At Stan
ford we build things to last forever,"
he said. "This one didn't quite make
it."
