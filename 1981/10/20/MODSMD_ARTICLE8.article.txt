## At Cancun, will the North help South in aid, trade? 
### Los Angeles Times 
(This is the second part of a two-part story on
this week's 14-nation North-South summit in
Cancun, Mexico.)
Economists commented on the significance of
the upcoming Cancun conference on the Third
World and North-South relations. A Calfornia
banker with 20 years experience in lending in
Latin American, said, "The time has passed when
we sat securely between two oceans, shielded
from everybody else. We understand that when
we think about the Russians, but we forget it
when we think about the Third World. When
there is change or unrest in these countries, it
can reach out and bite us."
He and others note that many of the most dif
ficult or worrisome developments for the Unit
ed States in recent years — the rise of the oil
cartel, the flood of refugees and other unskilled
immigrants, the Iranian revolution, the turmoil
in Central America, the murder of Egyptian Pres
ident Anwar Sadat — all have their roots in the
Third World.
Purely economic shocks — a sudden change
in the priceor availability of oil,a massive default
on debt — can have a devastating impact on a
heavily capitalized industrial society, and such
shocks are at least as likely to emanate from the
rapidly changing economies of the South as
from the more stable ones of the North.
Even as the South poses growing dangers for
the United States, many economists argue, it also
offers great opportunities.
These economists contend that by providing
the right kind of financing, access to markets,
and other assistance the United States and its in
dustrial allies could obtain a massive new supply
of low-cost imported textiles, clothing, con
sumer goods and other manufactured products,
while opening up broad new foreign markets for
their own computer, aircraft, electronics and so
phisticated service industries.
With this approach, the World Bank argues in
its "World Development Report 1981," the eco
nomic growth rate in the developing countries
would be increased an average of more than one
percentage point annually over this decade. As a
result, economists at the bank say, the growth
rate in the United States and the other industrial
countries would rise by at least 0.2 percent of a
percentage point over what it would otherwise
be.
While those numbers may appear small, by
1990 they would translate into 200 million fewer
people below the poverty level around the
world, and 500,000 more jobs in the United
States alone, the economists say.
U.S. officials, with support from those in such
other industrial countries as Britain and West
Germany, reject this view. They argue that ac
celerating the flow of aid, low-cost loans and
other forms of capital to the Third World would
produce only a little growth and a lot of infla

tion.
Furthermore, U.S. officials say, it is impossible
for the White House to seek congressional ap
proval for an increase in foreign aid while, amid
serious inflation and unemployment at home,
they are making deep cuts in the budget for
domestic programs.
Thus, instead of increasing the flow of aid to
the Third World countries, the United States is
moving to restrict that flow, and is urging them
to concentrate on expanding their exports and
improving the competitiveness of their own
economies.
It is "simply unrealistic," Secretary of State
Alexander Haig told the U.N. General Assembly
last month, for the developing countries to
count on any massive increase in the flow of re
sources from the industrial nations.

Without substantial new sources of funds, said
Sewell of the Overseas Deveopment Council,
the developing countries will have no choice
but to cut their imports severely and the result
will be slower growth, spreading inflation, in
creased unemployment and deepened poverty.
The program that the Third World nations
have been advancing for several years — and
which they are certain to raise again this week at
the Cancun conference — would provide new
sources of funds in several ways. Among other
things, it calls for:
— A step-up in government aid flows, to re
duce the need for borrowing from banks. Also,
increased access resources of the Interna
tional Monetary Fund without having to comply
with the usual lending restrictions the IMF im
poses.
— Higher prices for their raw material exports.
With the exception of oil, the prices of products
the Third World countries ship from their mines
and farms have generally fallen well behind the
world inflation rate in recent years.
— Special access to the markets of industrial
countries for the Third World's manufactured
goods. The developing countries argue that they
must have that access even while they continue
to protect their own factories against import
competition because otherwise they will never
get their manufacturing base established.

developing countries to count
pn any massive increase in the
flow of resources from the
industrial nations.

Without substantial new sources of funds, said
Sewell of the Overseas Deveopment Council,
the developing countries will have no choice
but to cut their imports severely and the result
will be slower growth, spreading inflation, in
creased unemployment and deepened poverty.
The program that the Third World nations
have been advancing for several years — and
which they are certain to raise again this week at
the Cancun conference — would provide new
sources of funds in several ways. Among other
things, it calls for:
— A step-up in government aid flows, to re
duce the need for borrowing from banks. Also,
increased access resources of the Interna
tional Monetary Fund without having to comply
with the usual lending restrictions the IMF im
poses.
— Higher prices for their raw material exports.
With the exception of oil, the prices of products
the Third World countries ship from their mines
and farms have generally fallen well behind the
world inflation rate in recent years.
— Special access to the markets of industrial
countries for the Third World's manufactured
goods. The developing countries argue that they
must have that access even while they continue
to protect their own factories against import
competition because otherwise they will never
get their manufacturing base established.
(This is the second part of a two-part story on
this week's 14-nation North-South summit in
Cancun, Mexico.)
Economists commented on the significance of
the upcoming Cancun conference on the Third
World and North-South relations. A Calfornia
banker with 20 years experience in lending in
Latin American, said, "The time has passed when
we sat securely between two oceans, shielded
from everybody else. We understand that when
we think about the Russians, but we forget it
when we think about the Third World. When
there is change or unrest in these countries, it
can reach out and bite us."
He and others note that many of the most dif
ficult or worrisome developments for the Unit
ed States in recent years — the rise of the oil
cartel, the flood of refugees and other unskilled
immigrants, the Iranian revolution, the turmoil
in Central America, the murder of Egyptian Pres
ident Anwar Sadat — all have their roots in the
Third World.
Purely economic shocks — a sudden change
in the priceor availability of oil,a massive default
on debt — can have a devastating impact on a
heavily capitalized industrial society, and such
shocks are at least as likely to emanate from the
rapidly changing economies of the South as
from the more stable ones of the North.
Even as the South poses growing dangers for
the United States, many economists argue, it also
offers great opportunities.
These economists contend that by providing
the right kind of financing, access to markets,
and other assistance the United States and its in
dustrial allies could obtain a massive new supply
of low-cost imported textiles, clothing, con
sumer goods and other manufactured products,
while opening up broad new foreign markets for
their own computer, aircraft, electronics and so
phisticated service industries.
With this approach, the World Bank argues in
its "World Development Report 1981," the eco
nomic growth rate in the developing countries
would be increased an average of more than one
percentage point annually over this decade. As a
result, economists at the bank say, the growth
rate in the United States and the other industrial
countries would rise by at least 0.2 percent of a
percentage point over what it would otherwise
be.
While those numbers may appear small, by
1990 they would translate into 200 million fewer
people below the poverty level around the
world, and 500,000 more jobs in the United
States alone, the economists say.
U.S. officials, with support from those in such
other industrial countries as Britain and West
Germany, reject this view. They argue that ac
celerating the flow of aid, low-cost loans and
other forms of capital to the Third World would
produce only a little growth and a lot of infla

tion.
Furthermore, U.S. officials say, it is impossible
for the White House to seek congressional ap
proval for an increase in foreign aid while, amid
serious inflation and unemployment at home,
they are making deep cuts in the budget for
domestic programs.
Thus, instead of increasing the flow of aid to
the Third World countries, the United States is
moving to restrict that flow, and is urging them
to concentrate on expanding their exports and
improving the competitiveness of their own
economies.
It is "simply unrealistic," Secretary of State
Alexander Haig told the U.N. General Assembly
last month, for the developing countries to
count on any massive increase in the flow of re
sources from the industrial nations.
