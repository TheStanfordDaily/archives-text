"Get your claws my
Pilot pen. See... I don't A
get no respect!*

"People have Ifcyi \ jfl
a hunger for
my Pilot Fineiiner be
cause they're
tor a
that writes through carbons And
Pilot charges only 79c tor it,
People get their hands on it and
forget ifs my pen So I don't get no respect! I don't make out any better
with my Pilot Razor Point. It writes whip-cream smooth
with on extra fine line, its metal collar helps keep
; the point from going squish-so people
love it. For only 89« they
should buy their own pen-
and show some re
spect for my
property.'^^^HppP^<^«Bp^^
