# Panel disagrees on desirable U.S. human rights posture

Sharply differing views on the role that human rights
should play in U.S. foreign policy emerged from four
panelists during last night's public forum on "Human
Rights in Conflict" sponsored by Amensty International.
The audience of about 250 at Kresge Auditorium heard
Senior Hoover Fellow John Bunzel criticize the policy of
publicly denouncing human rights violations, especially
when they occur toward allies.
"Many assumptions about human rights have to be
tempered," Bunzel said, and while the United States was
born out of a revolution for human rights there is no uni
versal standard. "We have to take the world as we find
it,"he said.
Bunzel mentioned the example of Egypt, where he
said it would be absurd for the United States to complain
about violations of human rights in light of Egypt's
strategic position as a Mideast ally.
"Sometimes national interest does not equal human
rights," Bunzel said. While the United States must re
main comitted to human rights, it must "take away hu
man rights out of the hands of ideologues," he added.
Bunzel said that quiet diplomacy "needs to be given a
chance," and quoted Harvard educator Paul Freund's
view that "absolute principle is as absurd as absolute
power."
"Torture is torture and murder is murder," Bunzel

said, biijt "the scale of torture and murder is also what
counts."
Bunzel went on to draw the distinction between au
thoritarian and totalitarian states that has made U.S. Am
bassador to the United Nations Jeanne Kirkpatrick fa
mous.
According to the distinction, "totalitarian states" —
such as the Soviet Union or China — try to permeate ev
ery aspect of life in an effort to transform human nature;
the "authoritarian" state — such as El Salvador or Chile
— wants only political power.
Where the totalitarian state wants worship the author
itarian wants only obedience, according to Bunzel.
The atrocities of totalitarian states are worse, said
Bunzel, because of their "scope."
Every one of the panelists disagreed with Bunzel on
this point.
"Political Science Prof, and Hoover Fellow Seymour
Martin Lipset argued that we cannot have a double stan
dard. "We have to work with evil," Lipset said, "but
we don't have to like them."
The United States has no reason to hide its outrage
over human rights violations, according to Lipset. "The
Argentiniansand Saudis don't conceal whatthey think of
us, why should we?"
