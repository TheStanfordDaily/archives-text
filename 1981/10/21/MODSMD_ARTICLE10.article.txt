## Editorial Arms sale too risky 
### 
Unless the Senate votes to reject the Reagan
administration's proposed armssaletoSaudi
Arabia, some of our most sophisticated military
hardware, including five AWACS, an F-15
enhancement package and AIM 9L
Supersidewinder missiles, will be en route to
Riyadh by 1985. This sale would be highly
imprudent, and we hope that the Senate joins
the House of Representatives in vetoing it.
The administration's intentions cannot be
faulted: Reagan sought to bolster stability in the
region, promote better U.S.-Saudi relations,
continue to guarantee Israel'*: security, and
insure that the weapons systems and the secrets
they contain do not somehow fall into Soviet
hands.
Unfortunately, the plan fallsshorton all four
counts.
In theory, the more advanced the weaponry a
nation possesses, the greater the defensive
capabilities it can claim. This is not so of Saudi
Arabia, which has neither the technology nor
the trained manpower to use its weapons to full
aadvantage in the face of a determined attack by
Soviet or Soviet-backed troops.
Further, as Congressman Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo) observed, "An AWACS flying at 30,000
feet will not be able to warn the Saudi
government about Moslem fundamentalism or
unrest in the oilfields. . . .Sidewinder missiles
would be of no value in defending the Grand
Mosque from another takeover by Moslem
fanatics." Internal unrest is and will continue to
be a major threat to the Saudi government.
Proponents of the sale assert that it is
necessary to better U.S.-Saudi relations. The
Saudis, however, have chosen a curious way of
reciprocating: they have described thissale as a
test of their relationship with the United States
and intimated that "unpleasant consequences"

might result if the country is "humiliated" by a
Congressional veto of the deal.
If the deal does go through, however, still
more unpleasant consequences might result.
Israel, America's staunchest ally in the Mideast,
would be placed in grave danger. Saudi control
of the AWACS would mean that Riyadh would
be apprised of the whereaboutsand movements
of every single Israeli aircraft. Though it is
unlikely that Saudi Arabia would wage its jihad
against Israel alone, knowing Israel's secrets
would make wresting away tactical and military
superiority — without which Israel is at the
mercy of the Arab world — easier.
Saudi Arabia, which has recognized neither
the Camp David accords nor Israel's right to
exist, has done a great deal to sabotage the
peace process by attempting to isolate Egypt in
the Arab world, providing financial supportto
the PLOand maintainingthat "theZionist
entity" isa greater enemy than the Soviet Union.
The AWACS —an integral part of ourown
defense system — will help us and our proven
allies only as long as their technology remains
secret This arms sale would place both
AWACS and the training manuals for their top
secret equipment in the hands of a government
whose long-term stability and allegiance to the
West is at best uncertain.
While it is important to build closer ties with
Saudi Arabia, it is wrong to do so at the possible
expense of the security of these sensitive
systems. The arms package will not necessarily
increase the security or stability of the region
nor will itstimulatestepped-upoil production.
The arms sale would endanger a close ally and
potentially compromise some of America's most
advanced technology. Not even an $8.5 billion
price tagcan justify such a tremendous risk.
