## Sell AWACS to Saud 
### 
Vehement, emotional opposition to the
AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia threatens to defeat
the Reagan administration proposal. Such
opposition, grounded on parochial concerns,
undermines a sensible foreign policy designed
to promote U.S. intereststhroughoutthe world.
While it is unfortunate that diplomacy must
involve the sale of arms, the United States is
neither powerful nor isolated enough to dictate
moral terms to the world. The arms sale is one
part of a process of gaining the influence and
credibility necessary to promoteourgoals — in
this case, an enduring peace in the Mideast that
secures our economic needs.
Foreign policy issues are domestic issues, too.
Do we heat our homes? Do we go to war? Does
our banking system survive? Saudi Arabia helps
shape answers to all these questions.
Peace in the region will notendure without
the support of Arab states. Defeat of the sale
would continue to exclude Arab nations from
any process leading to a common peace. The
abdication of American responsibilities in the
area would leave a void which soon might be
filled by other powers with different aims.
Saudi Arabia, for its own reasons, demands

and will receive complex weapons and
surveillance equipment. Thequestion is not
whether they will receive thosearms but who
will providethem. Control of the armsthrough
training, maintenance, and sale of spare parts is
better than no control at all.
The sale would not compromise vital
American technology. The Saudis can and will
acquire equally effective surveillance gear,
attack fighters, and missiles from Great Britain or
other powers if the sale is rejected.
The survival of the State of Israel is not at stake.
What threatens Israel and the region is
instability and polarization — not isolated arms
sales. Closer ties to Arab states are not
established at theexpenseof American support
of Israel. Indeed, the proposed sale comes at a
time when American relations with Israel are at
their closest in history. For example, American
diplomacy was effective toward Egypt, once a
sworn enemy of Israel.
That diplomacy must be grounded on close
American relations with all nations in the
region. Senate approval of the AWACS sale is
one part of that effort.
