## Stanford calendar requires diversity 
### 
When I got an invitation from the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity to pose for
their calendar, my first reaction was
uncontrollable anger. In fact, if
someone had walked into my trailer
at the time, I am certain that he or she
could have described me as being
malicious and "hostile" as I ex
pounded my views on the subject.
The calendar bothers me because I
think a calendar full of Miss America
type women is an unfair portrayal of
Stanford women. My favorite aspect
of the University is the diversity of the
student body.
I relish the fact that one can talk to
a communist and a conservative at
the same lunch table. I love the fact
that Stanford has gay women, anti
feminist women, feminist women,
sorority women, black women, white
women, hispanic women, Asian
women, Arabian women, Indian
women, physically handicapped
women; each with her own beauty.
Yet many of these women, their is
sues, and their particular beauty go
unnoticed by much of our student
body. As project coordinator Phil
Gyori said, "I learned that there was
another body or faction on this cam
pus that I had no idea existed," (Dai
ly, Oct. 16).
My anger is not centered around
the intentions of the Phi Delts, but at
their naivete, their lack of awareness
of the manner in which they are of
fending women. Former Phi Delt
president Jeffery Bird said, "We (the
Phi Delts) are trying to show that not
everything about men and women
has to be seen in a sexist light." I
agree. However, the manner in
which the Phi Delts chose to demon
strate their positive support of worn

en was sexist. Again, here is an exam
ple of a simple lack of awareness.
A child should not be punished
simply because he does not under
stand a math problem or has never
before encountered a word. In order
for the teacher to help her student,
she must understand the child's lack
of understanding. Similarly, it should
be pointed out to Gyori that if the
calendar were an accurate portrayal
of all the diversity underlying the
term Stanford women, then it would
indeed sell. Not only would the
calendar be attractive to the mem
bers of the fraternity system, but it
would appeal to all men: gay men,
w'nte men, black men, chicano men,
Asian men, Indian men, handi
capped men and to all women.
Those who bought it would not be
buying a girlie magazine but a calen
dar in which their friends were
portrayed as they are â€” beautiful for
what they bring to this campus as in
dividuals. The calendar would also
serve a most important function,
being a vehicle of communication.
The calendar that portrays the Stan
ford women in all their diversity
would create an awareness that is
presently lacking on this campus.
The calendar itself would be the
bridge of understanding, the bridge
of awareness over the vast chasm that
this entire incident exemplifies.
Gyori himself said, "I guess I was
sheltered. If these attitudes are alive,
I think people should know." I'd like
to see Gyori help people to under
stand these attitudes through the
publication of the Diversity of the
Stanford Women Calendar.
