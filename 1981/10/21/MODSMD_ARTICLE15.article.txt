## Women won't be relegated to kitchen 
### 
Washington — These aren't partic
ularly good times for women.
Each night, at theaters across the
nation, women are asked to bear Burt
Reynolds' baby (Paternity) or don
cellophane-bottomed designer jeans
(So Fine).
Meanwhile, former first "ladies"
Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson
launch a last-ditch campaign to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment, which
is all but dead.
Perhaps more depressing, the fed
eral government intends to redefine
rules on abortion and affirmative ac
tion, altering laws that have shaped
the lives of an entire generation of
women.
And journalists don't help matters
much. Ever-enlightened Playboy in
formed its readers last month that the
women's movement is finished. Oth
er publications such as Everywoman
still run silly features exploring "The
First Few Times in Bed."
Vet these untimely symptoms
don't portend the death of the wom
en's liberation movement. Inasmuch
as anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly would
love to lead the nation in a nagging
round of "I Told You So's," the wom
en's movement is merely slowing
down, weeding out and getting its act
together.
There's no doubt that the move
ment begun in the mid-1960s has ad
vanced the lives and fortunes of
women more than anyone had ex
pected.
It was no small matter, back then,
to question the roles of "girl" and
"wife" and explore one's own tal
ents. More than they know, the
movement paved the way for great
numbers of today's young women to
enter law practices, construction
trades and political contests.

During the 19705, women began to
paint in the details of their lives. They
pointed out that men underpaid
women, discriminated against them,
objectified them, abused them as
spouses and lovers, and foolishly be
lieved they could do without them.
This led to the popular notion that
the women's movement was a "war"
between the sexes. What bunk.
Whether the issue was suffrage or
reproductive rights, the women's
movement has always fed on "what it

'/Vfore than their male counterparts,
women have always worked to define
what they are. It's a phenomenon that
men can't entirely understand, much less
fully appreciate/

means to be a woman." More than
their male counterparts, women
have always worked to define what
they are. It's a phenomenon that men
can't entirely understand, much less
fully appreciate.
And though the movement is un
der bombardment from many camps
this fall, it's about to take off on an
other tack: "Now that we've gaineda
portion of the rights we deserve,"
women ask, "how can we juggle our
new responsibilities with the unique
ability to bear children?"
In her new book, The Second
Stage, feminist writer Betty Frieden
warns that unless women get beyond
"parroting . . . the cliches of wom
en's liberation," they'll never address
the undeniable conflict of having
both career and womb.
After years of struggling for the
right to choose, writes Frieden, wom
en now have difficulty choosing the
most traditional role: motherhood.
Until all choices are made free op
tions, women's liberation won't be
complete.
"We have been sustaining illusions
of choice where none exists. It is dan

gerous for women — or experts or
politicians or leaders of women — to
kid themselves that there is any real
choice that sidesteps the complex
problems women face today in mak
ing a new life of family, work and
love."
If Friedan's pro-family shift sounds
Schlaflyesque, she goes on to say that
the male experience can't be ignored
in the future. Men, she believes, are
in the best position to help because
they have wrestled with the three-

headed monster of family-work-love
for generations.
Many feminists are sure to reject
Friedan's appeal to "the enemy," as
well as her idyllic notion that sex
roles can change to everyone's satis
faction. Admittedly, it's difficult to be
optimistic when the gains of the last
15 years are often ignored by movie
producers, state legislators and the
first family.
But neither women nor men can
deny that the movement has more to
gain through new struggles than
through fighting to maintain a grip
on yesterday's achievements.
Most importantly, women will
confront — with or without men —
the meaning of their lives regardless
of the movement's fortunes. Juggling
several responsibilities is a pesonal
matter.
Despite a few signs that the 1950s
are back, women won't soon be re
legated to the kitchen. If they "go
back," they'll do so of their own voli
tion.

means to be a woman." More than
their male counterparts, women
have always worked to define what
they are. It's a phenomenon that men
can't entirely understand, much less
fully appreciate.
And though the movement is un
der bombardment from many camps
this fall, it's about to take off on an
other tack: "Now that we've gaineda
portion of the rights we deserve,"
women ask, "how can we juggle our
new responsibilities with the unique
ability to bear children?"
In her new book, The Second
Stage, feminist writer Betty Frieden
warns that unless women get beyond
"parroting . . . the cliches of wom
en's liberation," they'll never address
the undeniable conflict of having
both career and womb.
After years of struggling for the
right to choose, writes Frieden, wom
en now have difficulty choosing the
most traditional role: motherhood.
Until all choices are made free op
tions, women's liberation won't be
complete.
"We have been sustaining illusions
of choice where none exists. It is dan

gerous for women — or experts or
politicians or leaders of women — to
kid themselves that there is any real
choice that sidesteps the complex
problems women face today in mak
ing a new life of family, work and
love."
If Friedan's pro-family shift sounds
Schlaflyesque, she goes on to say that
the male experience can't be ignored
in the future. Men, she believes, are
in the best position to help because
they have wrestled with the three-

headed monster of family-work-love
for generations.
Many feminists are sure to reject
Friedan's appeal to "the enemy," as
well as her idyllic notion that sex
roles can change to everyone's satis
faction. Admittedly, it's difficult to be
optimistic when the gains of the last
15 years are often ignored by movie
producers, state legislators and the
first family.
But neither women nor men can
deny that the movement has more to
gain through new struggles than
through fighting to maintain a grip
on yesterday's achievements.
Most importantly, women will
confront — with or without men —
the meaning of their lives regardless
of the movement's fortunes. Juggling
several responsibilities is a pesonal
matter.
Despite a few signs that the 1950s
are back, women won't soon be re
legated to the kitchen. If they "go
back," they'll do so of their own voli
tion.

Washington — These aren't partic
ularly good times for women.
Each night, at theaters across the
nation, women are asked to bear Burt
Reynolds' baby (Paternity) or don
cellophane-bottomed designer jeans
(So Fine).
Meanwhile, former first "ladies"
Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson
launch a last-ditch campaign to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment, which
is all but dead.
Perhaps more depressing, the fed
eral government intends to redefine
rules on abortion and affirmative ac
tion, altering laws that have shaped
the lives of an entire generation of
women.
And journalists don't help matters
much. Ever-enlightened Playboy in
formed its readers last month that the
women's movement is finished. Oth
er publications such as Everywoman
still run silly features exploring "The
First Few Times in Bed."
Vet these untimely symptoms
don't portend the death of the wom
en's liberation movement. Inasmuch
as anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly would
love to lead the nation in a nagging
round of "I Told You So's," the wom
en's movement is merely slowing
down, weeding out and getting its act
together.
There's no doubt that the move
ment begun in the mid-1960s has ad
vanced the lives and fortunes of
women more than anyone had ex
pected.
It was no small matter, back then,
to question the roles of "girl" and
"wife" and explore one's own tal
ents. More than they know, the
movement paved the way for great
numbers of today's young women to
enter law practices, construction
trades and political contests.

During the 19705, women began to
paint in the details of their lives. They
pointed out that men underpaid
women, discriminated against them,
objectified them, abused them as
spouses and lovers, and foolishly be
lieved they could do without them.
This led to the popular notion that
the women's movement was a "war"
between the sexes. What bunk.

reproductive rights, the women's
movement has always fed on "what it
