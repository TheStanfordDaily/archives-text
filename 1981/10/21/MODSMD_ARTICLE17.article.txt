Students love chanting "All Right
Now" with the Band when Stanford
scores a touchdown, but few can join in
with thewordsof "Hail Stanford Hail"
at the end of the football game. The
people who can sing along are almost
invariably members of the Stanford
Glee Club.
Described by a member as "the only

really closely knit large choral groupat
Stanford," the Glee Club is partly
affiliated with the Music Department,
partly with the Dean of Student Affairs,
but mostly with a devoted and
energetic leader named Robert
MacKinnon.
MacKinnon directs the five groups
which make up the Glee Club — a 40 to
60 voice choir, a 25 piece orchestra, jazz
combo, and two small singing groups —
"The Axidentals," consisting of 12 men,
and"The Naturals," made up of 12
women.
"I'm called a half-time instructor but
the job takes 125 percent of my time,"
said MacKinnon, who has been director
since 1964.
The club is funded both by the
University and what the group earns
through paid concerts and their singing
Valentines. They perform dorm
concerts for free and thisyearthey
hope to add singing telegrams to their

list of activities.
Presently, the group isabout half
men and half women, but it has not
always been mixed. MacKinnon related
the history: "When I first started
directing the Glee Club it was an all
male group. In 1971, just afterthings
around Stanford started going co-ed,
we had an unusual distribution of
voices in the choir — too many tenors,

not enough sopranos. Oneof the
members suggested that we ask women
to join to solve the problem. We voted
'yes' and we've mixed the voices ever
since. It not only solved the vocal-range
problem, but also had a lot of social
benefits."
Though MacKinnon said he likes
prospective choir members to have
some sort of musical background,
anyone from freshman to graduate
student, from music majorto engineer
is eligible for the group. One unit of
academic credit per quarter is given to
student members. MacKinnon also
allows graduated studentstocontinue
singing, and he'll even takecommunity
members not affiliated with the
University if "they seem to fit in."
Membership in the club is on a
"rolling admissions" basis. Thereare
scheduled auditions at the beginning of
fall quarter, but after that, students can
try out anytime by arranging an

audition.
When asked what kind of music the
Glee Club sings, MacKinnon replied, "I
don't think there's anything that we
don'tsing. I like to start the Chorus on
serious works like Bach and Brahms.
That's where I really teachthemtosing.
Thenwe havealotof fun with some jazz
pieces and more contemporary works."
He described a typical concert
program as 50 percent classical works
such as Bach's "Hallelujah," and
Charles Ives' arrangement of "Psalm
150," and 50 percent upbeat tunes,
including selections from "Fiddler on
the Roof," "Oliver," and the Stanford
fight song medley.
MacKinnon has a unique method of
training his singers. At the beginning of
the year, after a mere three rehearsals,
he hasthegroupgiveafour-song
concert somewhere on campus. This
year their debut was Oct. 13 at Sigma
Chi. After three more rehearsals, they
sing again publicly, havingdoubled
their repertoire. Finally, in mid
autumn, they spend a tune-filled
weekend up at Greenwood Lodge in
the Soquel mountains, for their annual
Glee Club workshop.
After three days of what Westman
describes as "hard-singing," the group
has mastered all 20or so Glee Club
concert selections. They end the
workshop by performing at a local
Soquel mountain church, wherethe
appreciative congregation has
provided them with a potluck supper
for the last 11 years.
Going to the workshop is not the only
traveling that Glee Club members do.
Approximately every second year
MacKinnon arranges a spring singing
tour. Past tours have gone from as far
north as Seattle to as far south as San
Diego. Next year MacKinnon said he
hopes to arrange a tour covering three
northern California townsand three
cities in Oregon.
