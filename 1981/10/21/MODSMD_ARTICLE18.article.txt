# New campus snack bar plans grand opening for next week
## Tresidder will soon have crepes and quiche in its Corner Pocket 
### Michael Weiss 
The Corner Pocket, a new
snack bar addition to Tresidder
Union,will open next Monday.
Featuring crepes and quiche,
The Corner Pocket will offer
foods which are not presently
available at Tresidder's main
eating facility, Union
Crossroads.
As its name implies, The Cor
ner Pocket will be located at
the corner of Tresidder farthest
from The Coffee House, facing
White Plaza. The snack bar will
be accessible to people from
both inside and outside Tres
idder, and those who like to sit
on the Tresidder Union patio
during lunchtime will no long
er have to enter the building to
buy food.
On Nov. 20, a further alter
ation will be made at Tresidder
when brighter and more
energy efficient lights are put

into the main eating area of
Union Crossroads. The lights
will be unique in that they will
face the ceiling, and will then
reflect back onto the main
floor.
These brighter lights, along
with the fact that The Corner
Pocket will remain open for
business until 11 p.m. are de
signed to make Tresidderan at
traction to students at night.
Thiswould please the people
at Tresidder, said Greg
Larson, Tresidder assistant di
rector. Larson said Tresidder is
hoping the new lights will at
tract those students who like to
combine talking with studying.
"Maybe then Meyer Library
can become a library again,"
he said.
These lights, along with The

Corner Pocket, will be the fin
ishing touches of a renovation
program for the Tresidder
Union eating facility which was
first conceived of about four
years ago.
According to Ellie Op
penheim, the director of Tres
idder Union, three years ago
the plan was still "more of a
dream than a particular
project." Now, $237,000 later,
the plan is finally becoming a
reality.
The alterations have already
translated into better sales for
Union Crossroads. Larson said,
"Going by these first few days, I
think we may increaseoursales
by more than 20 percent over
last year."
The main stimulus for the
renovation program was the

increasingly harsh criticism
that Tresidder was receiving
about its main food service fa
cility. Larson said, "the eating
area had been given the single
largest allocation of space, and
yet it was also the ugliest space
in the building."
In a paper which sum
marized the reasons for the re
modeling program, Larson and
Mark Breier, who was a mem
ber of the remodeling plan's
advisory group, described the
Crossroads — then called the
Transition — in the following
way: "The dining area is both
noisy and dirty, and has a visual
effect like that of an old, large
airport lounge."
In order to alter the "uninvit
ing and outdated '60s style
cafeteria," the advisory group

— which consisted of Breier,
student Sam Howe, Dave Jor
dan, manager of Union
Crossroad's food service con
tractor, Servomation, Larson,
and Oppenheim — came up
with six major goals.
These included breaking up
the area's space through the
use of variations in the lights,
seating levels, and table loca
tions, an expansion of both the
absolute and functional seating
capacity, an improvement in
the serving efficienty, a change
from the multi-colored tik-s
which previously covered the
floor to new carpeting, and
finally, an improvement in the
general atmosphere.
While some of these goals
have been accomplished more
fully than others, they have all

been reached to a certain ex
tent. Cinnamon colored tiles
and new carpeting cover the
floors, plants have been placed
throughout the area, the seat
ing capacity has increased from
290 to 357, and the service area
has shown a marked increase in
efficiency.
These changes by them
selves have elicited a positive
response from people within
and without the Tresidder or
ganization. According to Maro
Felix, assistant manager of
Servomation, "Wow! This is
great," was the usual reaction
of students to the new look of
Union Crossroads during the
first few days of school.
Sheila Scobba, a member of
the food committee last year,
and this year Union Board

Chairperson, said of the
changes: "Well, you can't real
ly change it into something it
isn't. It's a cafeteria and it
always will be. However, with
the plants and the different set
up, I think it really is a lot nicer
than it used to be."
The Coffee House has not
been affected much by these
changes. Steve Weiss, manager
of the Coffee House, said he is
not worried about the forth
coming Corner Pocket.
"I think there is enough
business on this campus for
both places," he said. "It (The
Corner Pocket) may affect our
business to some great extent.
However, sometimes at night
last year, we had more business
than we could handle, and if
they take some of our business
away, it will just help to make
us less smoky, less hot and less
crowded."

on the Tresidder Union patio
during lunchtime will no long
er have to enter the building to
buy food.
On Nov. 20, a further alter
ation will be made at Tresidder
when brighter and more
energy efficient lights are put

into the main eating area of
Union Crossroads. The lights
will be unique in that they will
face the ceiling, and will then
reflect back onto the main
floor.
These brighter lights, along
with the fact that The Corner
Pocket will remain open for
business until 11 p.m. are de
signed to make Tresidderan at
traction to students at night.
Thiswould please the people
at Tresidder, said Greg
Larson, Tresidder assistant di
rector. Larson said Tresidder is
hoping the new lights will at
tract those students who like to
combine talking with studying.
"Maybe then Meyer Library
can become a library again,"
he said.
These lights, along with The

Corner Pocket, will be the fin
ishing touches of a renovation
program for the Tresidder
Union eating facility which was
first conceived of about four
years ago.
According to Ellie Op
penheim, the director of Tres
idder Union, three years ago
the plan was still "more of a
dream than a particular
project." Now, $237,000 later,
the plan is finally becoming a
reality.
The alterations have already
translated into better sales for
Union Crossroads. Larson said,
"Going by these first few days, I
think we may increaseoursales
by more than 20 percent over
last year."
The main stimulus for the
renovation program was the

increasingly harsh criticism
that Tresidder was receiving
about its main food service fa
cility. Larson said, "the eating
area had been given the single
largest allocation of space, and
yet it was also the ugliest space
in the building."
In a paper which sum
marized the reasons for the re
modeling program, Larson and
Mark Breier, who was a mem
ber of the remodeling plan's
advisory group, described the
Crossroads — then called the
Transition — in the following
way: "The dining area is both
noisy and dirty, and has a visual
effect like that of an old, large
airport lounge."
In order to alter the "uninvit
ing and outdated '60s style
cafeteria," the advisory group

— which consisted of Breier,
student Sam Howe, Dave Jor
dan, manager of Union
Crossroad's food service con
tractor, Servomation, Larson,
and Oppenheim — came up
with six major goals.
These included breaking up
the area's space through the
use of variations in the lights,
seating levels, and table loca
tions, an expansion of both the
absolute and functional seating
capacity, an improvement in
the serving efficienty, a change
from the multi-colored tik-s
which previously covered the
floor to new carpeting, and
finally, an improvement in the
general atmosphere.
While some of these goals
have been accomplished more
fully than others, they have all

been reached to a certain ex
tent. Cinnamon colored tiles
and new carpeting cover the
floors, plants have been placed
throughout the area, the seat
ing capacity has increased from
290 to 357, and the service area
has shown a marked increase in
efficiency.
These changes by them
selves have elicited a positive
response from people within
and without the Tresidder or
ganization. According to Maro
Felix, assistant manager of
Servomation, "Wow! This is
great," was the usual reaction
of students to the new look of
Union Crossroads during the
first few days of school.
Sheila Scobba, a member of
the food committee last year,
and this year Union Board

Chairperson, said of the
changes: "Well, you can't real
ly change it into something it
isn't. It's a cafeteria and it
always will be. However, with
the plants and the different set
up, I think it really is a lot nicer
than it used to be."
The Coffee House has not
been affected much by these
changes. Steve Weiss, manager
of the Coffee House, said he is
not worried about the forth
coming Corner Pocket.
"I think there is enough
business on this campus for
both places," he said. "It (The
Corner Pocket) may affect our
business to some great extent.
However, sometimes at night
last year, we had more business
than we could handle, and if
they take some of our business
away, it will just help to make
us less smoky, less hot and less
crowded."
The Corner Pocket, a new
snack bar addition to Tresidder
Union,will open next Monday.
Featuring crepes and quiche,
The Corner Pocket will offer
foods which are not presently
available at Tresidder's main
eating facility, Union
Crossroads.
As its name implies, The Cor
ner Pocket will be located at
the corner of Tresidder farthest
from The Coffee House, facing
White Plaza. The snack bar will
be accessible to people from
both inside and outside Tres
idder, and those who like to sit
on the Tresidder Union patio
during lunchtime will no long
er have to enter the building to
buy food.
