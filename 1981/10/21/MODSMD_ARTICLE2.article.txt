# Saudis' merit in AWACS sale debated
## 
### Cici Oremland 
With the final Airborne Warning
and Control System (AWACS) vote in
the Senate scheduled for Oct. 28, ex
perts debated Saudi Arabia's politi
cal stability and commitment to Unit
ed States' interests last night in the
Terra House Lounge.
Saudi Arabia remains one of the
United States' closest and "friend
liest" Arab nations and should be
trusted with the sale of AWACS, said
Dr. Michel Nabti, representative for
the San Francisco League of Arab
States. But, Saudi Arabia is too polit
ically unstable to handle the AWACS
without American supervision, coun
tered Ira Forman, forrfieV lOtfftyiST for
the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee.
Nabti said Saudi Arabia has dem
onstrated its loyalty to the United
States by remaining "the principal
moderating element" in the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC). "Saudi Arabia is
like the Vatican of the Moslem
world," he said.
He said the Saudis have continually
worked to keep the price of oil mod
erate, worked to maintain OPEC's oil
production to ensure a "reasonable"
price and insisted on maintaining the
U.S. dollar as the monetary base for
OPEC transactions. He also said
Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of U.S.
products and technology.
"Saudi Arabia has acted almost
consistently on behalf of American
interests," he said.
Forman said the Saudis have not
moderated the price of oil and, in
fact; raised it 100 percent in 1970. He
said, "The Saudis do us (the United
States) no favors by selling us their
oil."
He said the 1978 sale of F-15 fighter
planes was also to be a test of Saudia
moderation. He said the Saudis
promised that that sale was to be the

last Saudi request for U.S. arms.
Both debaters agreed that the po
litical situation in the Mideast is
critical to the defense of the United
States.
Nabti said Saudi Arabia is the
leader of the Islamic world and that
without proper AWACS protection,
invasion from Soviet-influenced
countries could mean the loss of oil
and the loss of U. S. geographical and
political leverage in the Mideast.
But Forman said it was essential for
the United States to maintain its pres
ence in Saudi Arabia if the AWACS
were to be sold to the Saudis. He said
Saudia Arabia has only become an in
ternational power recently because
its oil supplies are so large and that its
citizens are unloyal to their own re
gime. Egypt is the only Arab nation
with "a proud history of nation-state
status," and the United States closely
monitors the two AWACS stationed
there, he said.

"Saudi Arabia resembles a 14th
century feudal monarchy that has
wealth but is unable to protect it,"he
said.
He said the United States does not
offer such high technology equip
ment to any nation who asks. The
United States first offered to give the
AWACS to the Saudis with the condi
tion that the United States maintain
control of the planes; then, the Unit
ed States proposed selling the Saudis
the planes at a reduced price if the
two nations could arrange joint con
trol, he said. The Saudis rejected both
offers.
Forman said the threat to Saudi sta
\->\\\«Y internal, not from invading
countries. He said, "You cannot use
AWACS to shoot terrorists off the
mosques in Mecca."
With 11 senators still undecided af
ter the lastest Associated Press poll,
Forman said of the upcoming Senate
vote, "I think it'll be very close."

interests," he said.
Forman said the Saudis have not
moderated the price of oil and, in
fact; raised it 100 percent in 1970. He
said, "The Saudis do us (the United
States) no favors by selling us their
oil."
He said the 1978 sale of F-15 fighter
planes was also to be a test of Saudia
moderation. He said the Saudis
promised that that sale was to be the

last Saudi request for U.S. arms.
Both debaters agreed that the po
litical situation in the Mideast is
critical to the defense of the United
States.
Nabti said Saudi Arabia is the
leader of the Islamic world and that
without proper AWACS protection,
invasion from Soviet-influenced
countries could mean the loss of oil
and the loss of U. S. geographical and
political leverage in the Mideast.
But Forman said it was essential for
the United States to maintain its pres
ence in Saudi Arabia if the AWACS
were to be sold to the Saudis. He said
Saudia Arabia has only become an in
ternational power recently because
its oil supplies are so large and that its
citizens are unloyal to their own re
gime. Egypt is the only Arab nation
with "a proud history of nation-state
status," and the United States closely
monitors the two AWACS stationed
there, he said.

"Saudi Arabia resembles a 14th
century feudal monarchy that has
wealth but is unable to protect it,"he
said.
He said the United States does not
offer such high technology equip
ment to any nation who asks. The
United States first offered to give the
AWACS to the Saudis with the condi
tion that the United States maintain
control of the planes; then, the Unit
ed States proposed selling the Saudis
the planes at a reduced price if the
two nations could arrange joint con
trol, he said. The Saudis rejected both
offers.
Forman said the threat to Saudi sta
\->\\\«Y internal, not from invading
countries. He said, "You cannot use
AWACS to shoot terrorists off the
mosques in Mecca."
With 11 senators still undecided af
ter the lastest Associated Press poll,
Forman said of the upcoming Senate
vote, "I think it'll be very close."

obligation of teaching.
With the final Airborne Warning
and Control System (AWACS) vote in
the Senate scheduled for Oct. 28, ex
perts debated Saudi Arabia's politi
cal stability and commitment to Unit
ed States' interests last night in the
Terra House Lounge.
Saudi Arabia remains one of the
United States' closest and "friend
liest" Arab nations and should be
trusted with the sale of AWACS, said
Dr. Michel Nabti, representative for
the San Francisco League of Arab
States. But, Saudi Arabia is too polit
ically unstable to handle the AWACS
without American supervision, coun
tered Ira Forman, forrfieV lOtfftyiST for
the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee.
Nabti said Saudi Arabia has dem
onstrated its loyalty to the United
States by remaining "the principal
moderating element" in the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC). "Saudi Arabia is
like the Vatican of the Moslem
world," he said.
He said the Saudis have continually
worked to keep the price of oil mod
erate, worked to maintain OPEC's oil
production to ensure a "reasonable"
price and insisted on maintaining the
U.S. dollar as the monetary base for
OPEC transactions. He also said
Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of U.S.
products and technology.
"Saudi Arabia has acted almost
consistently on behalf of American
interests," he said.
Forman said the Saudis have not
moderated the price of oil and, in
fact; raised it 100 percent in 1970. He
said, "The Saudis do us (the United
States) no favors by selling us their
oil."
He said the 1978 sale of F-15 fighter
planes was also to be a test of Saudia
