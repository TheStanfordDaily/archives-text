## "A Hargadonian alumni-wishbook" 
### Joan O'Connell 
When not serving the
Stanford community, the
Board of Trustees' 31 mem
bers re-enter, relatively
speaking, normal everyday
life. Normal that is for a
group whose combined
biographies read like a wish
book dreamed up by Dean
of Ad missions F red
Hargadon.
In fact, were they to apply
to Stanford today, we're not
sure which adjective each
would use to describe him
or herself, but to fall back on
a former application essay
topic, if they were to write a
b00k...
Perhaps one would be
called Sunset — a magazine
for western living — Trustee
Melvin Lane is the maga
zine's publisher. Lane also
serves as chairman of Na
tional Gifts, one of the
board's primary fundraising
positions.
Or it might be called The
Responsibilities of Advertis
ing — at least that's the
name of the book board
member Otis Pease chose to
write. Pease spent 10 years
here as Coe Professor of
American History. In 1964
he got a close-up look at a
slice of history many of us
were too young to ap
preciate. He spent the sum
mer as a volunteer Freedom
School teacher in the Mis
sissippi Summer Project.
Or perhaps it would not
be a book at all, but rather
some of the most talked
about political news stories
of our time, such as Bert
Lance's financial problems,
or the CIA agent who sold
secrets to the Soviets, or
profiles of the man who
tried to assassinate Presi
dent Ronald Reagan — all
these were written by
trustee Philip Taubman, a
Washington correspondent
for The New York Times.
Taubman, an alumni ap
pointed trustee, is a former

reporter for Time magazine,
a former roving editor for
Esquire and a former editor
of the Daily.
Meanwhile, Warren
Christopher, the former
deputy secretary of state,
wrote perhaps the key
chapter in the story of the
release of the 52 Iranian
hostages; not on paper, per
haps, but as the primary
liason between Iran and the
United States. Not only is he
serving his second term on
the board, but he was also
featured speaker at last
June's commencement in
Frost Amphitheater, where
he stressed the importance
of communication.
So you hear our tuition is
going up because of PG&E
rate hikes? Probably trustee
Frederick Mielke, vice pres
ident of Pacific Gas & Elec
tric, could shed some light
on that one.
Speaking of price hikes,
what about gasoline? Per
haps we should bend the
ear of John Grey, president
of Standard Oil of Califor
nia. Or if you happen to be
back East, give trustee
Thomas Barrow a call; he's
vice chairman of Standard
Oil of Ohio.
John Packard, vice presi
dent of the board, is ex
ecutive vice president of
Scudder, Stevens & Clark,
Inc. in his spare time.
Hewlitt-Packard, mean
while, is well-represented
by John Young, corporate
president.
Turning to the world of
politics, John Gardner,
chairman and founder of
Common Cause and the
Secretary of Health, Educa
tion & Welfare in the John
son Administration, has
been a devoted trustee,
chairing the search commit
tee which nominated Wil
liam Kimball to fill Peter
Bing's spot as president of
the board. Gardner will
leave the board next fall, as

he has reached the retire
ment age of 70.
Meanwhile the wife of
West Virginia Governor
John "Jay" Rockefeller IV,
Sharon Percy Rockefeller, a
former civil rights activist
and ardent supporter of the
Equal Rights Amendment, is
also a board member. One
of only six women currently
on the board, Rockefeller is
joined by the program of
ficer of the Carnegie Foun
dation, Barbara Finberg,
Marlborough School

trustee Nancy Munger, Di
rector of the Rate Depart
ment for the Public Service
of New Mexico Joellyn
Kapp Murphy and finally
University of Michigan As
sociate Law Prof. Sallyanne
Payton.
The Storey House re
construction project re
ceived special interest from
Barbara Maxwell, a Los An
geles attorney; she is a
former president of the
house.
The board draws its mem

bers from all over the coun
try ranging from Boston —
from which trustee Nelson
Dong (an assistant U.S. at
torney) hails — to Canton,
Ohio, home of the chair
man of the board of the
Timken Corp., trustee Wil
liam Timken You can find
trustee George McCown,
Chairman of Sequoia Cor
poration, in Boise, Idaho,
while Varian Associates'
chairman, Edward Ginzton
lives close by in Palo Alto.
Both Thomas Ford, presi

dent of the Ford Land
Comp. and business consul
tant William Ayer reside in
Menlo Park.
New York is home for
Roger Lewis, former chair
man of AMTRAK and cur
rent chairman and chief ex
ecutive officer of Tele
Resources.
The board long ago aban
doned its image as a get-to
gether of San Francisco's
fine old families, but there
are several important
trustees from the City on the
board, including attorney
Frank "Sandy" Tatum and
president of Levi Strauss, Pe
ter Haas. Haas will also be
leaving the board next
month, on his 70th birthday.
Haas, Gardner and W.
Parmer Fuller, great-grand
son of the founder of the
paint company which bears
the family name, are among
the older members of the
board. Fuller will turn 70
next year.
If a "business en
trepeneur" is what you're
looking for, you need
search no further than
Mountain View to find
trustee Frank Lodato
Rudolph Munzer from
Long Beach is likely to ex
perience a lot of competi
tion among his time com
mitments — as a member of
the Los Angeles Olympic
Committee he is helping
that city prepare for the 1984
games. Perhaps he'll save a
seat for for Los Angeles at
torney Michael Ridley, also
a trustee.
For want of a more conve
nient way to mention two of
the board's higher profile
members, we'll just say they
are both "ex officio" mem
bers of most of the board's
committees. President of
the board, William Kimball
is also president of Kimball
and Company, an invest
ment corporation in San
Francisco. Donald Kennedy
runs a major university on
the mid-peninsula.
