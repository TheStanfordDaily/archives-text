# Citizen hostage feeling haunted by past
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Van Nuys, Calif. — From the beginning, Jerry
Plotkin was different. He was the only private
citizen of the 52 U.S. hostages held in Iran. He
was the only one whose past prison record be
came a part of the story of the detained Ameri
cans. He was the only one whose motives for
being in Iran were publicly questioned.
Today, when the 47-year-old businessman,
who has steadily maintained that he went to Iran
to arrange foreign labor contracts, talks about
his readjusment sincd the hostages' release, he
speaks in terms of those differences.
Like other hostages, he will talk of physical re
actions such as continuing insomnia. But unlike
the others, he talks of the "stigma" of his sudden
notoriety. While many other hostages went
home to parades, Plotkin was met at Los Angeles
International Airport by a throng of jostling re
porters asking whether he was a drug dealer. (He
had served two years in the 1960s on a federal
marijuana-smuggling conviction.)
"Even now," Plotkin said in a recent interview,
"when I meet people, people say, 'Ahhh, you
were over there....' Businessmen, I'm trying to
do business and their concern is the question.
You can see the question, even if it isn't asked."
As emotional as when he first came home, he
expresses himself more forcefully than before.
And although in January he seemed always close
to tears in the few interviews he gave, now he
seems barely able to contain his anger.
"I don't want sympathy," he said. "I don't
want to sound like sour grapes." On the other
hand, when asked to sum up this year, he re
plied: "My family and friends, they saved me.
Everything else has been negative."
The other hostages have been "embracing,"
he said — he was elected by them to the Family
Liaison Assistance Group board of directors.

Otherwise, he said he has felt like a "second
class citizen," separate from the others.
The feeling started right after he left Iran, he
said. "People didn't know what to do with me
when I got to Germany," he said, recalling the
group's stopover in Wiesbaden. "The Army
came in and they took care of the Army; the
Navy came in and took care of the Navy; the
Marines came in; the State Department came in.
I sat there.
"Finally, I said to a State Department guy:
'Where's somebody for the citizen? Aren't I a
person, too?' As the citizen, I became a second
class citizen."
Again when the hostages attended the medi
cal checkup reunion in White Sulphur Springs,
W. Va., last April, his name was omitted from all
lists, he said. "Only when I complained did they
give me some group sessions to go to."
Prevented like the other hostages from suing
Iran because of the release agreement, Plotkin
also was excluded as a private citizen from medi
cal benefits under the federal Hostage Relief Act
of 1980. When the presidential Commission on
Hostage Compensation recently proposed
paying the hostages $12.50 a day for the 444 days,
Plotkin thought he again was short-changed.
"I paid my own ransom as far as I'm con
cerned," he said.
Plotkin has a $60 million damage suit pending
against the San Fernando Valley Da/7y News for a
January story suggesting he had taken part in
drug activity in Iran, and he said he plansa suit in
the U.S. Court of Claims based on his loss of
rights to sue Iran.
In the early months he gave a few lectures, but
now, he said, "I'm not asked." Early book and
movie interest in his experience seems to have
died out, he added. "No one seems to care."

Otherwise, he said he has felt like a "second
class citizen," separate from the others.
The feeling started right after he left Iran, he
said. "People didn't know what to do with me
when I got to Germany," he said, recalling the
group's stopover in Wiesbaden. "The Army
came in and they took care of the Army; the
Navy came in and took care of the Navy; the
Marines came in; the State Department came in.
I sat there.
"Finally, I said to a State Department guy:
'Where's somebody for the citizen? Aren't I a
person, too?' As the citizen, I became a second
class citizen."
Again when the hostages attended the medi
cal checkup reunion in White Sulphur Springs,
W. Va., last April, his name was omitted from all
lists, he said. "Only when I complained did they
give me some group sessions to go to."
Prevented like the other hostages from suing
Iran because of the release agreement, Plotkin
also was excluded as a private citizen from medi
cal benefits under the federal Hostage Relief Act
of 1980. When the presidential Commission on
Hostage Compensation recently proposed
paying the hostages $12.50 a day for the 444 days,
Plotkin thought he again was short-changed.
"I paid my own ransom as far as I'm con
cerned," he said.
Plotkin has a $60 million damage suit pending
against the San Fernando Valley Da/7y News for a
January story suggesting he had taken part in
drug activity in Iran, and he said he plansa suit in
the U.S. Court of Claims based on his loss of
rights to sue Iran.
In the early months he gave a few lectures, but
now, he said, "I'm not asked." Early book and
movie interest in his experience seems to have
died out, he added. "No one seems to care."
Van Nuys, Calif. — From the beginning, Jerry
Plotkin was different. He was the only private
citizen of the 52 U.S. hostages held in Iran. He
was the only one whose past prison record be
came a part of the story of the detained Ameri
cans. He was the only one whose motives for
being in Iran were publicly questioned.
Today, when the 47-year-old businessman,
who has steadily maintained that he went to Iran
to arrange foreign labor contracts, talks about
his readjusment sincd the hostages' release, he
speaks in terms of those differences.
Like other hostages, he will talk of physical re
actions such as continuing insomnia. But unlike
the others, he talks of the "stigma" of his sudden
notoriety. While many other hostages went
home to parades, Plotkin was met at Los Angeles
International Airport by a throng of jostling re
porters asking whether he was a drug dealer. (He
had served two years in the 1960s on a federal
marijuana-smuggling conviction.)
"Even now," Plotkin said in a recent interview,
"when I meet people, people say, 'Ahhh, you
were over there....' Businessmen, I'm trying to
do business and their concern is the question.
You can see the question, even if it isn't asked."
As emotional as when he first came home, he
expresses himself more forcefully than before.
And although in January he seemed always close
to tears in the few interviews he gave, now he
seems barely able to contain his anger.
"I don't want sympathy," he said. "I don't
want to sound like sour grapes." On the other
hand, when asked to sum up this year, he re
plied: "My family and friends, they saved me.
Everything else has been negative."
The other hostages have been "embracing,"
he said — he was elected by them to the Family
Liaison Assistance Group board of directors.
