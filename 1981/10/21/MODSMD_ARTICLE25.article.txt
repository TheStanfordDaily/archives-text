## Interest rates irking small businesses! 
### 
New York — You can't talk to
small-business people today
without the subject of interest
rates coming up, accompanied
by frustration and anger and, it
seems, mounting hostility to
the Reagan economic pro
gram.
Their anger isn't confined to
President Ronald Reagan
alone. It goes back a long way,
well into the 1960s and the be
ginning of almost constant in
flation, years in which small
business feels it suffered too
quietly.
An economist of the Na
tional Federation of Independ
ent Business, which has more
than 500,000 members,
summed up the growing de
spair in testimony late last week
before a House Small Business
subcommittee.
"Thestateof small business is

dangerously weak," said
Edison Zayas, the economist.
"Over the last year, thousands
of small firms have gone out of
business, and today many
more are just holding on.
"For years now, the balance
sheets of small firms have been
eroded by an extensive period
of sluggish real sales, along
with high, unexpected infla
tion rates, huge increases in
energy costs, heavy regulatory
burdens and increased income
and labor taxes."
The result, said Zayas, "has
been a persistent reduction in
working capital, forcing more
firms to turn to external
sources of funds," which for
small businesses cost more
than 20 percent — a cost that in
these times of weakening de
mand, cannot be passed on as
higher prices.

In short, he concluded, after
having been severely de
bilitated by the adverse effects
of years of unsound govern
ment policies, many small firms
have now been knocked cold,
bankrupted, by high interest
rates.
In the view of some small
business spokesmen, often ex
pressed off the record, Reagan
must share with previous presi
dents and Congresses — and
with the Federal Reserve —
blame for today's high interest
rates.
The chief criticism of the
president is that he has per
mitted the war on inflation to
be waged too heavily by high
financing costs, ruining mar
kets for houses and cars and
making inventory costs pro
hibitive.
Real estate salesmen and car

dealers have joined in a cam
paign to pressure the adminis
tration, Congress and the Fed
to bring down rates, claiming
that while economic condf
tions might dictate relatively
high rates, room still exists for -
some easing without com
promising the fight against in
flation. A few points lower,
they suggest, would work won
ders.
The campaign has an un
usual technique forgainingthe
attention of congressmen. , k
The key to unlocking the
economy is lower interest
rates, say the campaigners. "So
send Congress your tired, your
battered, your worn-out keys."
It will remind them, they say,
of the house, car or truck you
couldn't buy, or of the business
you had to lock up for good.
