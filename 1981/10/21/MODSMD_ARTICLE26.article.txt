# Patent system hoping for change
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
In 1962, Wayne Knitting Mills of Chat
tanooga, Tenn., accused Russell Hosiery
Mills of Star, N.C., of violating its patent on
the shoetop-high footsock, a new hosiery
item being snapped up by thousands of
American women.
Fifteen years later, after appearing
before 17 different federal judges, Wayne
Knitting finally won its suit.
But what a Pyrrhic victory it proved to
be.
Only two years remained on the patent's
life before the footsock invention would
become public domain. And the final
damages awarded to Wayne Knitting did
not even cover half its legal fees, which ex
ceeded $500,000.
"It was a very disillusioning experience.
We put a couple of North Carolina patent
attorney's kids through college," said
Wayne Knitting Vice President Jack May.
The Wayne Knitting case is not an aber
ration in the Byzantine world of U.S. pat
ent law. For decades, inventors have strug
gled to fend off patent infringement, often
only to be hamstrung by technicalities and
the disarray of the patent system itself.
Changes for the better
But now, there are portents of a vastly
more favorable climate for patent holders,
offering the promise that inventors will
find it easier to escape protracted and cost
ly disputes over "intellectual property."
Many of the traditional approaches to
patent law practice are being revolu
tionized, thanks to profound — if little no
ticed — changes mandated by Congress,
the Supreme Court and the Justice Depart
ment in recent months.
Other proposals are still being debated,
such as one to create a single tribunal to
handle patent cases on a nationwide basis,
a step some hope would eliminate the
present great disparity between court find
ings around the country.
The recent changes are also creating
new incentives to reward innovation and
creativity — at a time when American in
ventors have been losing ground to for
eign scientists at an alarming rate.
"For decades, the judiciary and the oth
er branches (of government) have been
hostile to the patent system," said attorney
Irving Shapiro, one of the nation's most re
spected business leadersand former chair
man of Du Pont.
"But the good news is that we have
begun recognizing that the pendulum had
gone too far," Shapiro said. "Now there's a
greater recognition that you can't have re
serch and development wthout a healthy

respect for the patent system. Without
that, we'd be killing the goose that lays the
golden eggs."
Patent search maze
A patent secures for its holder the right
to prevent others from making, using or
selling his or her invention in this country.
In order to obtain a patent, an invention
must be a process, a machine, a variety of
plant, a product or a design that is different
from what already is known. Patents are
not issued for methods of doing business,
newly discovered laws of nature or purely
mental processes.
Most patents are granted for 17 years. An
invention, after its expiration, becomes
public property and is available for use by
anyone.
Of the 4.25 million patents the depart
ment has issued, almost 3.25 million are
now considered to be "in the public do
main."
Typically, when a person has conceived
an invention, he or she goes to a patent at
torney with a record of the invention, de
scribing what it is and how it works, per
haps accompanied by sketches, drawings
or photographs.
The attorney, or a patent researcher,
then sets out to ascertain if the invention
can be patented, or whether similar inven
tions already have been patented.
This sometimes tedious quest leads to
any one of 37 libraries operated by the Pat
ent and Trademark Office, a divsion of the
Commerce Department.
To make matters worse, between 7 per
cent and 25 percent of all patents ever is
sued are missing from patent office files,
especially patents in rapidly developing
fields.
Sloppiness and lack of staff
The main branch of the Patent and
Trademark library has the most complete
files, with some 500 different subject mat
ter headings and more than 100,000 sub
categories. But those records are on paper,
and thus are not immune from sloppiness
by searchers.
"We rely on patent attorneys to help po
lice the files," said Isaac Fleischmann, a
patent office spokesman. He said there
also is "a constant inventory going on year
in, year-out" to improve the integrity of
the records.
The integrity of such patent searches is
vital to the validity of a patent, if
challenged. And until Congress produced
a remedy that took effect July 1, courts
have been quick to invalidate a patent if its
holder had overlooked a pertinent prior
patent or invention and thus did not pres

ent that information to patent examiners.
The patent office relies on an inventory
legal representative to perform searches
because it is facing a backlog of 200,000
patent applications that grows by the day,
and so it does not allow its examiners to
conduct their own searches when con
sidering an application.
In an age when communications ad
vances stir the imagination, the patent of
fice is lagging far behind. Its 900 examiners,
for instance, must file their formal opin
ions on the question of patentability in
longhand.
It is not surprising, then, that "the aver
age time it takes to get a patent will con
tinue to increase by about two months
each year until it reaches three years in
1988," Commissioner Gerald Mossinghoff
of the Patent and Trademark Office saichn
an interview.
Litigation and invalidation
Mossinghoff's office issues about 60,000
patents a year, or 66 percent of all applica
tions filed. But although less than 2 percent
of all patents granted become embroiled
in litigation, half of those that do end up in
court are invalidated, according to
Fleischmann.
One such invalidation nearly 20 years
ago involved a device to help people start
to water sk'i. Even though a U.S. disWict
judge in Minnesota found that the
ladder-like device had met every test of
patentability, he invalidated the patent be
cause, he said, the gadget was "just too
simple to be patented," recalled Douglas
Henderson, a leading Washington patent
attorney.
The ruling was the first time that sim
plicity constituted grounds for unpaten
tability, according to Henderson, who said
he learned to water-ski with the help of
that device.
The most promising development, pat
ent attorneys say, has been the recent
turnaround in attitude by the courts — and
especially by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Over the years, the constitutional intent
of the patent system — to assure for society
the fruits of invention — became diluted
by a feeling that inventors were taking un
fair advantage of society, according to
Shapir~
In three recent opinions, the court's
new direction represents nothing short of
"a welcome relief from the outright
hostility against patents that we can find in
a number of earlier opinions," said Sidney
Diamond, Mossinghoff's predecessor as
patent commissioner.
