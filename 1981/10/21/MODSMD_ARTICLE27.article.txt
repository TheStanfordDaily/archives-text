## Yanks yoke Dodger Blue, take first game of Series 
### 
New York (AP) — Bob
Watson, one of those Yankees'
"Old Folks," hit a three-run
homer in the first inning that
carried New York to a 5-3 vic
tory last night over the Los An
geles Dodgers in the first game
of the 1981 World Series.
The 35-year-old Watson and
some of his veteran teammates
had come under fire by Yan
kees owner George Steinbren
n"-r during New York's Ameri
can League East Division
playoff series with Milwaukee.
But Watson, who had 11 hits in
the division and championship
series, answered Steinbren
ner's complaints again with a
home run in his first World
Series at-bat.
The victory went to Ron
Guidry, 11-5 with a 2.76 earned
run average during the season.
He checked Los Angeles on
four hits and six strikeouts
through seven innings before
retiring in favor of relievers
Ron Davis and Rich Gossage.
The Dodgers scored their last
two runs in the eighth inning,
but the Yankees were saved

from further damage in that
frame when third baseman
Craig Nettles made a spec
tacular leaping catch of a drive
by Steve Garvey.
It was the renewal of one of
baseball's most intense World
Series rivalries in a season that
had shattered tradition. The
Dodgers and Yankees have met
10 times previously in the fall
classic but they got here this
year only after winning
divisional playoffs forced by a
players' strike over free agent
compensation that gouged 59
days from the season.
The season's miseries were
all but forgotten by gametime.
With one out in the first,
Jerry Mumphrey singled to
right field off Dodgers left
hander Jerry Reuss. Reuss
struck out the dangerous Dave
Winfield on three pitches, and
there were two outs.
Lou Piniella, who replaced
the injured Reggie Jackson in
right field, strode to the plate
accompanied by deep
throated fans' cheers of
"Louuuu." Piniella hit Reuss'

first pitch down the right field
line and Mumphrey was forced
to hold at third when a fan
reached from the stands and
touched the ball.
That brought up Watson.
Reuss ran the count to 1-2
against Watson.
The burly right-handed hit
ter, who had six homers during
the regular season, lofted a
high fly ball towards the 385-
foot sign in right-center. The
ball cleared the fence by about
five feet and the Yankees took
a 3-0 lead in the first game of
their 33rd World Series ap

pearance.
Guidry, who started two of
the Yankees' playoff games
without a decision, struck out
four in a row at one stretch and
walked just two batters. He was
not overpowering but he
seemed to have the pitches
that would get him out of trou
ble when he needed them.
He gave up the first Dodger
run in the fifth when Steve
Yeager, a surprise starter at
catcher instead of Mike
Scioscia, belted his first pitch
over the right-field fence with
two out.

In the seventh inning, Ron
Cey led off with a sharp single
to left but Yankee left fielder
Winfield threw Cey out at sec
ond with a perfect peg. Guidry
walked the next hitter, Pedro
Guerrero, but he struck out
Rick Monday and got Yeagerto
fly out to right.
Davis, who along with
Gossage comprises perhaps
the best bullpen tandem in
baseball, walked the first two
batters he faced. That brought
on Gossage, who had four
saves in the Yankees' six pre
vious playoff victories. The

Goose gave up one hit in his
two innings and struck out two
to seal the fate of the Dodgers,
who have won just two of their
previous World Series with
New York.
The Yankees scored what
proved to be the winning run
off Reuss in the third inning.
With one out, Mumphrey lined
a soft single. After Winfield
flied to Dusty Baker at the wall
in left-center field — a spot that
would have been a homer in
any other major league park —
Mumphrey stole second.
Piniella then hit a looper to left,
past shortstop Bill Russell,
sending Mumphrey home and
chasing Reuss.
Bobby Castillo relieved for
the Dodgers and Piniella stole
his first base of the year without
so much as a glance from
Castillo. Castillo then walked
Watson, but Nettles flied out.
Reuss' 2 2 A inning stint was
his shortest of the year with the
exception of May 31, when he
pulled a hamstring in a game
against Cincinnati without re
tiring a hitter. His earliest pre

viousexit wasafter five innings.
The Yankees scored their
fifth run in the fourth on four
walks by Castillo, tying a World
Series record. The last was to
Winfield with the bases loaded.
After Davis walked pinch
hitter Derrel Thomas and
Davey Lopes to start the eighth,
Gossage came in. Pinch-hitter
Jay Johnstone greeted The
Goose with a single that
scored Thomas and sent Lopes
tothird. Another run scored on
Baker's sacrifice fly to right
field, but then Nettles, not
Gossage, shut the door.
Garvey who had singled
once and hit the ball hard twice
ripped a line drive to Nettles'
right. Nettles, who had
bedeviled the Dodgers with his
fielding in the 1978 World
Series, took two cat-steps to his
right, leaped into the air and
brought down Garvey's smash
for the second out of the in
ning.
Nettles got the final assist of
the inning as Cey grounded
into a routine force out to
third.

the Yankees' playoff games
without a decision, struck out
four in a row at one stretch and
walked just two batters. He was
not overpowering but he
seemed to have the pitches
that would get him out of trou
ble when he needed them.
He gave up the first Dodger
run in the fifth when Steve
Yeager, a surprise starter at
catcher instead of Mike
Scioscia, belted his first pitch
over the right-field fence with
two out.

In the seventh inning, Ron
Cey led off with a sharp single
to left but Yankee left fielder
Winfield threw Cey out at sec
ond with a perfect peg. Guidry
walked the next hitter, Pedro
Guerrero, but he struck out
Rick Monday and got Yeagerto
fly out to right.
Davis, who along with
Gossage comprises perhaps
the best bullpen tandem in
baseball, walked the first two
batters he faced. That brought
on Gossage, who had four
saves in the Yankees' six pre
vious playoff victories. The

Goose gave up one hit in his
two innings and struck out two
to seal the fate of the Dodgers,
who have won just two of their
previous World Series with
New York.
The Yankees scored what
proved to be the winning run
off Reuss in the third inning.
With one out, Mumphrey lined
a soft single. After Winfield
flied to Dusty Baker at the wall
in left-center field — a spot that
would have been a homer in
any other major league park —
Mumphrey stole second.
Piniella then hit a looper to left,
past shortstop Bill Russell,
sending Mumphrey home and
chasing Reuss.
Bobby Castillo relieved for
the Dodgers and Piniella stole
his first base of the year without
so much as a glance from
Castillo. Castillo then walked
Watson, but Nettles flied out.
Reuss' 2 2 A inning stint was
his shortest of the year with the
exception of May 31, when he
pulled a hamstring in a game
against Cincinnati without re
tiring a hitter. His earliest pre

viousexit wasafter five innings.
The Yankees scored their
fifth run in the fourth on four
walks by Castillo, tying a World
Series record. The last was to
Winfield with the bases loaded.
After Davis walked pinch
hitter Derrel Thomas and
Davey Lopes to start the eighth,
Gossage came in. Pinch-hitter
Jay Johnstone greeted The
Goose with a single that
scored Thomas and sent Lopes
tothird. Another run scored on
Baker's sacrifice fly to right
field, but then Nettles, not
Gossage, shut the door.
Garvey who had singled
once and hit the ball hard twice
ripped a line drive to Nettles'
right. Nettles, who had
bedeviled the Dodgers with his
fielding in the 1978 World
Series, took two cat-steps to his
right, leaped into the air and
brought down Garvey's smash
for the second out of the in
ning.
Nettles got the final assist of
the inning as Cey grounded
into a routine force out to
third.
New York (AP) — Bob
Watson, one of those Yankees'
"Old Folks," hit a three-run
homer in the first inning that
carried New York to a 5-3 vic
tory last night over the Los An
geles Dodgers in the first game
of the 1981 World Series.
The 35-year-old Watson and
some of his veteran teammates
had come under fire by Yan
kees owner George Steinbren
n"-r during New York's Ameri
can League East Division
playoff series with Milwaukee.
But Watson, who had 11 hits in
the division and championship
series, answered Steinbren
ner's complaints again with a
home run in his first World
Series at-bat.
The victory went to Ron
Guidry, 11-5 with a 2.76 earned
run average during the season.
He checked Los Angeles on
four hits and six strikeouts
through seven innings before
retiring in favor of relievers
Ron Davis and Rich Gossage.
The Dodgers scored their last
two runs in the eighth inning,
but the Yankees were saved

from further damage in that
frame when third baseman
Craig Nettles made a spec
tacular leaping catch of a drive
by Steve Garvey.
It was the renewal of one of
baseball's most intense World
Series rivalries in a season that
had shattered tradition. The
Dodgers and Yankees have met
10 times previously in the fall
classic but they got here this
year only after winning
divisional playoffs forced by a
players' strike over free agent
compensation that gouged 59
days from the season.
The season's miseries were
all but forgotten by gametime.
With one out in the first,
Jerry Mumphrey singled to
right field off Dodgers left
hander Jerry Reuss. Reuss
struck out the dangerous Dave
Winfield on three pitches, and
there were two outs.
Lou Piniella, who replaced
the injured Reggie Jackson in
right field, strode to the plate
accompanied by deep
throated fans' cheers of
"Louuuu." Piniella hit Reuss'

first pitch down the right field
line and Mumphrey was forced
to hold at third when a fan
reached from the stands and
touched the ball.
That brought up Watson.
Reuss ran the count to 1-2
against Watson.
The burly right-handed hit
ter, who had six homers during
the regular season, lofted a
high fly ball towards the 385-
foot sign in right-center. The
ball cleared the fence by about
five feet and the Yankees took
a 3-0 lead in the first game of
their 33rd World Series ap
