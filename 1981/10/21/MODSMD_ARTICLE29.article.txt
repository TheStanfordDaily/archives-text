## 
### Associated Press 
Penn State and Pittsburgh
moved into the top two posi
tions in The Associated Press
college football poll yesterday,
the first time in 36 years that
two Eastern teams have been
ranked 1-2.
With Texas, last week's No.l
team, falling to 10th after a
42-11 rout at the hands of Ar
kansas, the way was cleared for
Penn State and Pitt, 2-3 a week

ago, to move up in a tight race.
Penn State, a 41-16 winner
over Syracuse, received 36 of 66
first-place votes and 1283 of a
possible 1320 points from a na
tionwide panel of sports writ
ers and sportscasters.
Pitt, which trounced Florida
State 42-14, received 26 first
place votes and 1277 points.
The loss sank Florida State from
11th to 20th.
The other three first-place

ballots went to North Carolina,
which defeated North Carolina
State 21-10 and rose from
fourth to third with 1155 points.
The last time two Eastern
teams led the poll was in 1945, a
war year, when Army and Navy
finished 1-2.
Penn State is the fifth team to
be ranked No.l this season.
There have never been more
than five No.l teams in one
year since The AP poll began in

1936. The other 1981 leaders
were Michigan, Notre Dame,
Southern California and Texas.
Clemson, a 38-10 winner
over Duke, jumped from sixth
place to fourth with 1033
points. It marks the first time
that two Atlantic Coast Con
ference teams — North Caroli
na and Clemson — have ever
been among the top five.
Southern Cal climbed from


ist'tiuit' /riim.m UJily
fense. Things just don't seem to go the Cardinals' way any
more, just like this pass didn't quite make it to tight-end
Chris E)ressel against Ohio State, a 24-19 near miss.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH EVERYBODY? — Nobody, in
cluding head coach P«uil Wiggin and his coaching staff,
can figure out what the trouble is with the Stanford of-
seventh to fifth with 994 points
by defeating Stanford 25-17
and giant-killer lowa shot from
12th to sixth with 928 points for
a 9-7 upset of Michigan, which
skidded from fifth to 18th.
Georgia's defending na
tional champions moved up
from ninth to seventh with 902
pointsafter mauling Vanderbilt
53-21, while Southern Method
ist climbed from 10th to eighth
with 848 points after a 38-22

trouncing of Houston. Mis
souri, last week's No.B team,
dropped to 19th after losing to
lowa State 34-13.
Rounding out the Top Ten
are Mississippi State, up from
16th following a 14-10 triumph
over Miami, Fla., that knocked
the losers out of the Top Twen
ty, and Texas with 641 and 618
points, respectively.
The Second Ten consists of
Alabama, Arkansas, Brigham
Young, lowa, Nebraska, Wash

ington State, Arizona State,
Michigan, Missouri and Florida
State.
Last week, it was Florida
State, lowa, Miami, Wisconsin,
Alabama, Mississippi State,
BYU, Washington State, Ne
braska and Arizona State.
Miami's loss to Mississippi
State cost the Hurricanes their
spot in the Top Twenty and
Wisconsin disappeared after
losing to Michigan State 33-14.
