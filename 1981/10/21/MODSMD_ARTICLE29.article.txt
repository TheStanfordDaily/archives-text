## 
### Associated Press 
Penn State and Pittsburgh
moved into the top two posi
tions in The Associated Press
college football poll yesterday,
the first time in 36 years that
two Eastern teams have been
ranked 1-2.
With Texas, last week's No.l
team, falling to 10th after a
42-11 rout at the hands of Ar
kansas, the way was cleared for
Penn State and Pitt, 2-3 a week

ago, to move up in a tight race.
Penn State, a 41-16 winner
over Syracuse, received 36 of 66
first-place votes and 1283 of a
possible 1320 points from a na
tionwide panel of sports writ
ers and sportscasters.
Pitt, which trounced Florida
State 42-14, received 26 first
place votes and 1277 points.
The loss sank Florida State from
11th to 20th.
The other three first-place

ballots went to North Carolina,
which defeated North Carolina
State 21-10 and rose from
fourth to third with 1155 points.
The last time two Eastern
teams led the poll was in 1945, a
war year, when Army and Navy
finished 1-2.
Penn State is the fifth team to
be ranked No.l this season.
There have never been more
than five No.l teams in one
year since The AP poll began in

1936. The other 1981 leaders
were Michigan, Notre Dame,
Southern California and Texas.
Clemson, a 38-10 winner
over Duke, jumped from sixth
place to fourth with 1033
points. It marks the first time
that two Atlantic Coast Con
ference teams — North Caroli
na and Clemson — have ever
been among the top five.
Southern Cal climbed from

fense. Things just don't seem to go the Cardinals' way any
more, just like this pass didn't quite make it to tight-end
Chris E)ressel against Ohio State, a 24-19 near miss.
