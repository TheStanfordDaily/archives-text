## 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU Senate last night recommended to the
University's Office of Planning 13 projects to im
prove lighting on campus. The recommendations,
solicited by the University, pertain to projects
which should be completed within the next two
years, according to Senator Scott Parazynski, spon
sor of the lighting resolution.
Areas recommended for lighting projects this
year include the area surrounding Wilbur Hall, the
two main streets of Escondido Village, and Lasuen
Mall between Cubberley Auditorium and the
Quadrangle.
Site recommendations for next year include the

area between Lathrop House and Sigma Chi, Serra
Street near the Oval, the inner Quad, Roble-
Lagunita service road, the corners, courtyards, and
archways of the Quad, Lomita Ct. Drive, the phys
ics tank, the area Surrounding Mirrielees House,
thearea between Tresidder Union and Old Union,
and the area near the Old Firehouse.
Parazynski said the projects would be funded by
the University's $200,000 budget for lighting im
provements.
The senate also decided to ask the student affairs
committee to study further proposed resolutions
on street improvements and new sodium lights.
In other action, the senate changed the ASSU

Legal Counseling fee assessment from a three
quarter assessment to a two quarter assessment.
Senators also agreed to cover election costs for the
Campus Entertainment Board and the Committee
on Contemporary Entertainment if the groups'fee
assessments fail.
Three by-law changes were also the subject of
senate action last night. Senators provided the
structure for senate committees, allowed for the
disposition of the ASSU's assets in the event of the
association's dissolution, and reorganized the
ASSU Linen Service Project to sell linen on a quar
terly basis instead of distributing linen each week.
At the start of the meeting, Senate
Chair Dave Phelps extended the sen
ate's condolences to the surviving
family of Anthropology Prof.
Michelle Rosaldo, who died last
week in a hiking accident in the Phil
ippines.
The senate also announced that
the ASSU still needs applicants for
the positions of committee staff assis
tants, graduate senate associates, and
director of the new office of public
affairs. Senate associate applications
are due tomorrow and staff assistant
applications are due Friday.
Phelps said he had received no ap

plications for staff assistants by last
night and emphasized the im
portance of the positions. "The com
mittee staff assistants are a link be
tween student members on Univer
sity committees and the ASSU," he
said. "They review committee policy
and the students working on the
committees."
Phelps said more than 70 applica
tions had been turned in for ASSU in
tern positions and that 23 applica
tions had already been submitted for
undergraduate senate associates. In
terns will be selected by Friday, and
associates should be chosen by next
week.
