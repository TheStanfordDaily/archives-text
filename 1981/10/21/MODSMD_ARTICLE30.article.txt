## What's up in Cardland? 
### 
What's wrong with the football team?
The guys, ranked in several prestigious pre
season top-20 polls, are not looking too good.
So what on earth is going on here? What hap
pened to Stanford's vaunted "explosive of
fense?" What happened to the Stanford
Spoilers, the guys who used to thrive on pull
ing off those last second victories over ruffian
opponents?
Where are the CARDINALS?? Or the Grif
fins, or the Trees, or the. .. you know, the
guys you could have a great time watching at
the stadium even when you weren't allowed
to bring in booze. I'm talking about the
Cardiac Cards, the Schonert Controversy, the
Cordova Controversy for chrissake! Any
thing, any controversy. Maybe that'll fire 'em
up. Let's drag out the mascot thing again.
Let's try changing the team's colors. Maybe
it's the band's fault. Let's panic!
No, no, no. I didn't really mean that. Panic
is not worth it. They're having a tough time,
for sure, but worse things have happened.
Take 1960 (please), when, under coach Jack
Curtice, the Cards (then Indians) bit it to the
tune of 0-10.
The Daily called the team "the lowest level
to which Stanford football has ever fallen"
and apparently, the student body was pretty
shook up about the whole thing. In fact, a
"riot" broke out on the field following a 34-20
loss to San Jose State.
This incident, and other disappointing de
feats, eventually led to the hanging of Coach
Curtice in effigy near the Bookstore.
Nice.
Things didn't get much nicer for Curtice, or
the team, as the season progressed. Editorials
and letters began to appear in the Daily, some

calling for Curtice's resignation, others de
manding the de-emphasis of football.
Football, however, was not de-em
phasized. Curtice's contract ran out after two
more losing seasons and, to put it nicely, he
was sent packing. Then came coach John
Ralston, who emphasized both recruiting
and winning. The team did both, as Ralston
eventually led Stanford to back-to-back Rose
Bowls.
Since then, however, things have come
nearly full circle. Emphasis, it turns out, does
not always equal success. That, for Stanford, is
an unfortunate reality. So is a 1-5 record.
It is not the purpose of this column,
though, to promote the de-emphasis of foot
ball here. Nor is it my intent to blast the foot
ball team for being "losers."
Potentially, the team isStanford's best ever.
Most everyone will admit the team does not
deserve to be 1-5. But it is, and people who
really care about Stanford football are begin
ning to get restless.
You can tell up in the stands, where
speculation is running rampant. Some fans
have been calling for Paul Wiggin's head on a
hibachi since the loss to San Jose State. "Hey
Wiggin, nice play calling," I heard someone
yell last week as Darrin Nelson ran up the
middle for a micro-gain against USC.
Perhaps the play selection has been a little
questionable (though Wiggin doesn't call
them). Perhaps the team does need to throw
on first down and knock off this two-yards
and-a-cloud-of-dust stuff. Maybe Elway's re
ceivers do need more experience (or speed,
or both).
But hey, we can't go 0-10. And that, after all,
is something.

speculation is running rampant. Some fans
have been calling for Paul Wiggin's head on a
hibachi since the loss to San Jose State. "Hey
Wiggin, nice play calling," I heard someone
yell last week as Darrin Nelson ran up the
middle for a micro-gain against USC.
Perhaps the play selection has been a little
questionable (though Wiggin doesn't call
them). Perhaps the team does need to throw
on first down and knock off this two-yards
and-a-cloud-of-dust stuff. Maybe Elway's re
ceivers do need more experience (or speed,
or both).
But hey, we can't go 0-10. And that, after all,
is something.
What's wrong with the football team?
The guys, ranked in several prestigious pre
season top-20 polls, are not looking too good.
So what on earth is going on here? What hap
pened to Stanford's vaunted "explosive of
fense?" What happened to the Stanford
Spoilers, the guys who used to thrive on pull
ing off those last second victories over ruffian
opponents?
Where are the CARDINALS?? Or the Grif
fins, or the Trees, or the. .. you know, the
guys you could have a great time watching at
the stadium even when you weren't allowed
to bring in booze. I'm talking about the
Cardiac Cards, the Schonert Controversy, the
Cordova Controversy for chrissake! Any
thing, any controversy. Maybe that'll fire 'em
up. Let's drag out the mascot thing again.
Let's try changing the team's colors. Maybe
it's the band's fault. Let's panic!
No, no, no. I didn't really mean that. Panic
is not worth it. They're having a tough time,
for sure, but worse things have happened.
Take 1960 (please), when, under coach Jack
Curtice, the Cards (then Indians) bit it to the
tune of 0-10.
The Daily called the team "the lowest level
to which Stanford football has ever fallen"
and apparently, the student body was pretty
shook up about the whole thing. In fact, a
"riot" broke out on the field following a 34-20
loss to San Jose State.
This incident, and other disappointing de
feats, eventually led to the hanging of Coach
Curtice in effigy near the Bookstore.
Nice.
Things didn't get much nicer for Curtice, or
the team, as the season progressed. Editorials
and letters began to appear in the Daily, some

calling for Curtice's resignation, others de
manding the de-emphasis of football.
Football, however, was not de-em
phasized. Curtice's contract ran out after two
more losing seasons and, to put it nicely, he
was sent packing. Then came coach John
Ralston, who emphasized both recruiting
and winning. The team did both, as Ralston
eventually led Stanford to back-to-back Rose
Bowls.
Since then, however, things have come
nearly full circle. Emphasis, it turns out, does
not always equal success. That, for Stanford, is
an unfortunate reality. So is a 1-5 record.
It is not the purpose of this column,
though, to promote the de-emphasis of foot
ball here. Nor is it my intent to blast the foot
ball team for being "losers."
Potentially, the team isStanford's best ever.
Most everyone will admit the team does not
deserve to be 1-5. But it is, and people who
really care about Stanford football are begin
ning to get restless.
You can tell up in the stands, where
speculation is running rampant. Some fans
