Kevin MacMillan, the Stan
lord football teams' starting
free safety for the past three
years, has decided to end his
football career due to a chronic
hip injury.
MacMillan made the an
nouncement yesterday, calling
it"the hardest decision I've
ever had to make in my life."
"I've got to go on with my
life, and unfortunately, foot
ball won't be a part of it,"he
said. "I've gone through a lot of
mental anguish in coming to
this decision. It's hard to leave
something for which I've given
everything I've had for so
long."
MacMillan, a 6-foot-1, 185-
pound junior from Portland,
Oregon, first injured his hip his
freshman year against UCLA.
He then re-injured it the last
scrimmage of spring practice

his sophomore year, and
played with pain throughout
1980.
"After last year, I promised
myself that the next time I in
jured my hip, that that would
be it. But I re-injured it in early
ball (August), and felt a desire
to play at least one more game
before I ended my college
football career," he said.
That was the 1981 opener
against Purdue, a nationally
televised contest in which
MacMillan made 10 tackles,
but also fractured his left hand
in the first quarter.
"That should have been it
right there, but I was worried
about what people would say,"
he said. "But I finally realized
that the people who really
know me and know what I've
gone through with my hip,
would understand. I-had
the decision earlier, now I'm

just carrying it out."
In 1980, despite his hip prob
lem, MacMillan accounted for
44 tackles and accumulated
five pass deflections, two in
terceptions, and one fumble.
In his freshman year, he made
43 tackles and ranked sixth in
Pacific-10 interceptions with
three. He was named First
Team Freshman All-America
by Blue Chip Magazine that
year also.
"Kevin has shown tremen
dous dedication as an athlete,"
said Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin. "But he has no control
over his congenital hip prob
lem. Our hearts go out to him,
because we all know how
much he wants to play football.
There's a lot more to life than
football, however. I'm sure
Kevin will continue to enjoy,
and excel in, the other aspects
of Stanford University."
