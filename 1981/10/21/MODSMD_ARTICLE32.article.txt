# Westmont slated for today
## Booters belittle Pacific 
### Adam Berns 
When a lion is kicked enough times, it will
eventually wake up and bite you. Well, that's ex
actly what the Stanford soccer team did to the
University of Pacific Saturday. Coming off two
disappointing losses to UCLA and Santa Clara,
Stanford finally woke up and thoroughly domi
nated the Tigers in a 6-0 rout.
What was especially impressive about the win
was that Stanford was playing without two of its
best offensive competitors. Both Jorge Titinger,
the Cards leading scorer, and Ted Rafalovich, a
senior who leads the team in assists., were unable
to play due to injuries.
However, senior striker Willie Guicci filled the
gap by playing his best game as a Cardinal. He
scored five goals on the afternoon.
From the start of the game, Stanford was in to
tal control. The Cardinals kept the ball in UOP
territory throughout most of the first period. In
the first part of the half the Cards were hurt by
several offside penalties, but midway through
the period Guicci headed in a ball after a Stan
ford corner kick.
UOP struck back moments later on a quick
break, but defender Doug Clark made a great
save by kicking away what was the Tigers' only
really close shot of the afternoon. After that it
was all Stanford.
Guicci got the ball again within a couple of
minutes, this time on a breakaway. Using his
great speed, he raced downfield and shot the
ball past the Tiger goalkeeper.
However, "The Willie Guicci Show" was only
beginning. He missed another shot moments
later when the ball bounced off the goalpost,
but, hauling in the rebound, he made sure of the
next shot by putting it past the goalie who came
out to block it.
In the second half, Stanford continued its total
domination of UOP by playing in Tiger territory
for most of the period. Incredibly, there was no
letdown. In fact, the Cardinals were as fired up
playing with a 3-0 lead as they had been at the
start of the game.
Stanford's scoring went hand in hand with its
dominance. The Cardinals next goal was scored
by no other than Guicci again. After taking an
excellent pass, the striker faked out the goal

keeper, forcing him to commit himself. Guicci
then dribbled past him and fired the ball into an
open goal.
The Cards scored again midway through the
final half as freshman midfielder Angel Vasquez
put great moves on two UOP defenders and
passed to Guicci. Almost robot-like in his effi
ciency, Guicci scored.
The Cards began substituting heavily after that
goal, but the bench played as well as the first
team. Throughout the final 15 minutes they con
tinued to dominate play, and freshman mid
fielder Casio Conceicas headed in another goal,
making the final score 6-0.
Stanford head coach Nelson Lodge was very
excited about the win, and gave credit to the
Cardinals' wide open offense. "The key to our
success was our ability to spread out our of
fense," he said. "By spreading our offense out
we gave ourselves more room to work with."
Lodge was also excited about the play of mid
fielder Vasquez, who had been switched to cen
ter halfback before the game. It was obvious that
he felt more comfortable in his position as he
was near the ball all day.
The win was an important one for the
Cardinals. After the back-to-back losses to
UCLA and Santa Clara it was important for them
to back on the winning track. "This game was
critical for us," Lodge admitted after the game.
"Not only does it get us back in the win column,
but it also provides momentum for our road trip
next week."
Today, in the second and final game of Stan
ford's Southern California road trip, the
Cardinals take on Westmont College.
For a small school, Westmont has one of the
most highly regarded teams on the West Coast.
"They are one of the finest NAIA teams in the
West," Lodge said, adding that they are well
coached and have a firmly established program.
Lodge admitted that today's game will be a
tough one because Westmont combines a short
passing game with a long-ball threat. The coach
said he feels confident, however, that his
Cardinals are up to the task.
Both Titinger and Rafalovich are expected
back today to bolster the Stanford attack.

to play due to injuries.
However, senior striker Willie Guicci filled the
gap by playing his best game as a Cardinal. He
scored five goals on the afternoon.
From the start of the game, Stanford was in to
tal control. The Cardinals kept the ball in UOP
territory throughout most of the first period. In
the first part of the half the Cards were hurt by
several offside penalties, but midway through
the period Guicci headed in a ball after a Stan
ford corner kick.
UOP struck back moments later on a quick
break, but defender Doug Clark made a great
save by kicking away what was the Tigers' only
really close shot of the afternoon. After that it
was all Stanford.
Guicci got the ball again within a couple of
minutes, this time on a breakaway. Using his
great speed, he raced downfield and shot the
ball past the Tiger goalkeeper.
However, "The Willie Guicci Show" was only
beginning. He missed another shot moments
later when the ball bounced off the goalpost,
but, hauling in the rebound, he made sure of the
next shot by putting it past the goalie who came
out to block it.
In the second half, Stanford continued its total
domination of UOP by playing in Tiger territory
for most of the period. Incredibly, there was no
letdown. In fact, the Cardinals were as fired up
playing with a 3-0 lead as they had been at the
start of the game.
Stanford's scoring went hand in hand with its
dominance. The Cardinals next goal was scored
by no other than Guicci again. After taking an
excellent pass, the striker faked out the goal

keeper, forcing him to commit himself. Guicci
then dribbled past him and fired the ball into an
open goal.
The Cards scored again midway through the
final half as freshman midfielder Angel Vasquez
put great moves on two UOP defenders and
passed to Guicci. Almost robot-like in his effi
ciency, Guicci scored.
The Cards began substituting heavily after that
goal, but the bench played as well as the first
team. Throughout the final 15 minutes they con
tinued to dominate play, and freshman mid
fielder Casio Conceicas headed in another goal,
making the final score 6-0.
Stanford head coach Nelson Lodge was very
excited about the win, and gave credit to the
Cardinals' wide open offense. "The key to our
success was our ability to spread out our of
fense," he said. "By spreading our offense out
we gave ourselves more room to work with."
Lodge was also excited about the play of mid
fielder Vasquez, who had been switched to cen
ter halfback before the game. It was obvious that
he felt more comfortable in his position as he
was near the ball all day.
The win was an important one for the
Cardinals. After the back-to-back losses to
UCLA and Santa Clara it was important for them
to back on the winning track. "This game was
critical for us," Lodge admitted after the game.
"Not only does it get us back in the win column,
but it also provides momentum for our road trip
next week."
Today, in the second and final game of Stan
ford's Southern California road trip, the
Cardinals take on Westmont College.
For a small school, Westmont has one of the
most highly regarded teams on the West Coast.
"They are one of the finest NAIA teams in the
West," Lodge said, adding that they are well
coached and have a firmly established program.
Lodge admitted that today's game will be a
tough one because Westmont combines a short
passing game with a long-ball threat. The coach
said he feels confident, however, that his
Cardinals are up to the task.
Both Titinger and Rafalovich are expected
back today to bolster the Stanford attack.


BACK ON THE TRACK IN A BIG WAY — The Stanford soc
cer team refound itself last weekend after two disasterous
losses to UCLA and Santa Clara. The Cards steamrolled

the Tigers 6-0 Saturday afternoon, and travel to Westmont
today.
When a lion is kicked enough times, it will
eventually wake up and bite you. Well, that's ex
actly what the Stanford soccer team did to the
University of Pacific Saturday. Coming off two
disappointing losses to UCLA and Santa Clara,
Stanford finally woke up and thoroughly domi
nated the Tigers in a 6-0 rout.
What was especially impressive about the win
was that Stanford was playing without two of its
best offensive competitors. Both Jorge Titinger,
the Cards leading scorer, and Ted Rafalovich, a
senior who leads the team in assists., were unable
to play due to injuries.
However, senior striker Willie Guicci filled the
gap by playing his best game as a Cardinal. He
