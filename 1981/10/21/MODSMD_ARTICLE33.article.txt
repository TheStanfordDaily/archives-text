# Envious Stanhouse wants to play
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Las Vegas, Nev. — Don
Stanhouse was lastseen in April
emerging from the Dodgers'
clubhouse, carrying out his few
belongings. He'd been told to
clean out his locker, a sports
world ritual as familiar as it is
sad.
Like most players, Stanhouse
had cleaned out lockers
before. But he always had
walked out with hope as well as
with his stuffed pet gorilla and
a few bats. This was different.
This time he hadn't been
traded or even sent down.
He'd been waived — the un
kindest cut. Stanhouse had
been told, at age 30, that he was
through. It was just him and the
gorilla.
We pick up the story in Las
Vegas, hardly the place for a
man down on his luck. But then

Stanhouse's is not the usual
hard-luck story, not by a long
shot.
He's lounging in the swim
ming pool behind his new
house while watching soap op
eras on his portable TV and
drinking a beer. The sun is hot,
as it tends to get in the desert,
but Stanhouse is well oiled. In
fact, he has more suntan lo
tion than chairs in the sparsely
furnished house.
"I have the Dodgers to thank
for all this," says Stanhouse, an
ex-pitcher who will soon be
come an ex-bachelor. One de
velopment is as remarkable as
the other.
"They've enabled me to sit
by (actually in) my pool and
drink cold suds out of Stan the
Man Unusual cups," he says.
"When the Lord gave out
brains, he gave me feet instead.

I've always landed on my feet.
The year I became a free agent,
I got all that publicity in the
World Series. The year I get cut,
there's a baseball strike, and
I'm the one that's getting
paid."
Even floating on his back,
Stanhouse does appear to have
landed on his feet. For
Stanhouse is not your usual un
employed baseball player. He
has earned $340,000 this sum
mer floating on his back. He'll
earn the same the next summer
and the summer after that and
the summer after that.
When the Dodgers waived
Stanhouse they chose to eat
the remaining $1.36 million of
what was once a $2.1 million
contract rather than allow him
a place on their roster. A large
gulp, even at today's prices.
But don't get the idea this is a

happy ending. As far as
Stanhouse is concerned it's no
ending at all. He doesn't be
lieve he's thrown his last
baseball in anger, although
he's worried about what peo
ple must think of a player
whose team would pay so
much to be rid of him.
He's bored doing little more
than collecting paychecks on
the first and 15th of every
month. And it's a desperate
kind of boredom, a kind that
gnaws at your insides like an ul
cer. It's not at all a lazy man's
kind of boredom. As far as
Stanhouse is concerned, he's in
exile, a place where you can go
a little crazy.
"How much can you do in a'
day?" he asks, as a man in jail
might ask. "You run, you work
out, you watch a few soap op
eras. You eat. You sit in the sun
and have a beer. Your friends
are working. They don't have
time to play."
What Don Stanhouse wants
do is not to play but to pitch
again. And as much as he wants
to pitch, he wants even more
not to be remembered as
somebody's $2 million mistake.
He doesn't even know why he
was cut. That eats at him, too.
"I will play again," says
Stanhouse. He hopes to play
winter ball in December and
then catch on with a major
league team next spring. "I
know you can't be a jock all
your life. But I don't want any
one telling me when it's time. I
want to find out for myself."
A day spent with Don
Stanhouse, the one they call
Stan the Man Unusual, the one
the stuffed gorilla, is usual
ly worth a few laughs. Nobody
enjoys a joke more than
Stanhouse.
But between the jokes,

Stanhouse is dead serious. He
hasn't forgotten the day the
Dodgers told him to pack up.
He won't ever.
"It was a cold feeling," he
says under the hot sun. "It was
the same feeling as the day we
(Baltimore) lost the World
Series to Pittsburgh. I thought,
like in the song,'ls that all there
is?'
"But I walked out with my
head up. I told (Dodgers Presi
dent) Peter (O'Malley) good
by. I talked to the press. I didn't
want anybody to think I'd been
run out."
Yet, that's just what he'd
been. It's a curious story, even
now. How did it happen? Why
did it happen?
"I went into a depression,"
Stanhouse says,"I shed a few
tears. I moped around a lot. I
just wanted someone to tell me
why, just tell me why, so I can
accept it."
The Dodgers had signed
Stanhouse as a free agent
before the 1980 season. They

needed a relief pitcher and
Stanhouse, who had helped
put Baltimore in the World
Series the year before, was the
best available. For a $400,000
bonus and $340,000 for five
years, Stanhouse was a Dodger.
If an unusual Dodger.
He had (has) this big walrus
type mustache and a white
Afro that more than peeked
out from under his cap. He was
(is) also a bit outrageous. Not at
all what a Dodger is supposed
to be.
Worse, for the 1980 season
he wasn't at all what a relief
pitcher was supposed to be.
With a bad back and a bad arm,
he missed two-thirds of the
season. And when he did pitch
he didn't pitch well, especially
down the stretch when the
Dodgers were fighting Hous
ton for the division crown. The
Dodgers lost the title in a
playoff game. If Stanhouse had
lived up to half his promise, the
Dodgers probably would have
won the National League West.

And at the end of spring
training in 1981, forced to
choose between Stanhouse
and rookie Dave Stewart, the
Dodgers made the tough de
cision to let Stanhouse go.
"We had to bite the bullet,"
said Vice President Al Cam
panis, who made the decision.
But did they have to?
Couldn't the Dodgers have put
Stanhouse on the disabled list
and given him more time to get
ready? Couldn't they have
stuck with him as they have
with previous pitchers — Tom
my john, Doug Rau, Terry
Forster — especially since cut
ting him meant the loss of more
than a million dollars?
It would cost a team nothing
more than the minimum salary
to pick Stanhouse up, since the
Dodgers are obligated to pay
the rest. But no one has.
Actually, there have been
few whispers. There has been
no indication that Stanhouse
was let go for any reason other
than the Dodgers were con

vinced he could no longer
pitch effectively. No dark se
crets.
"Don has said that he's
tainted," O'Malley says.
"That's crazy. We cut or trade
or release people all the time.
I o say there's a stigma or some
thing, I don't buy that at all. He
knows and the whole world
knows that we're strong in
young pitchers.
"I didn't see how we could
put him on the disabled list. He
wasn't injured. He was healthy.
Not being ready, that's not a
reason to disable somebody."
Stanhouse remains con
vinced theie's something else.
"People have told me that
they'd heard I'd never wear a
Dodger uniform this year,"
Stanhouse says. "More than
one person told me that. I
don't know."
He just recently bought the
home here, moving here from
Marina Del Rey in Los Angeles
and from a few bad memories.
This is where he's starting his

new life with his fiancee, Kyle
Stevenson. They're to be mar
ried Satuiday in Dallas, her
home, in a wedding that'll be
big even for Big D.
"There'll be about 500 or 600
people there," Stanhouse says.
"I'm going to have nine atten
dants. I guess the whole thing
will cost about $50,000."
Stevenson's family — her
father's a Texas oilman — will
pay for the wedding. It looks
like Stanhouse has landed on
his feet again.
She's a flight attendant and
they met, not surprisingly, on
an airplane while Stanhouse
was playing for the Orioles.
"She fell for me immediate
ly," says Stanhouse, whose rep
utation as a swinging bachelor
always exceeded his renown as
a pitcher. "Something about a
girl in a uniform seeing a guy in
a uniform.
"Actually, her friend was dat
ing another Oriole who had a

two-seater car. She needed a
ride and I was there."
This past summer, she's been
there. I hey had dated for two
years, but Stanhouse had
always said he wouldn't get
married as long as he *as
playing. As soon as he wasn't,
he says,"I lost my excuse."
He proposed one night in
Dallas and after a few bottles of
champagne they were out run
ning in the streets, in the rain,
looking foi Stanhouse's best
friend, who also lives in Dallas,
to tell him the news. Then they
went to tell her parents.
"Her mother only wanted to
know one thing," Stanhouse
says."The date."
Stanhouse is looking forward
to Saturday as he's looking for
ward to nothing else. Maybe
that's because there isn't much
beyond a dream to look for
ward to otherwise
"It gave me something," fie
says."I needed something."
