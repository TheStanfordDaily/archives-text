# Envious Stanhouse wants to play
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Las Vegas, Nev. — Don
Stanhouse was lastseen in April
emerging from the Dodgers'
clubhouse, carrying out his few
belongings. He'd been told to
clean out his locker, a sports
world ritual as familiar as it is
sad.
Like most players, Stanhouse
had cleaned out lockers
before. But he always had
walked out with hope as well as
with his stuffed pet gorilla and
a few bats. This was different.
This time he hadn't been
traded or even sent down.
He'd been waived — the un
kindest cut. Stanhouse had
been told, at age 30, that he was
through. It was just him and the
gorilla.
We pick up the story in Las
Vegas, hardly the place for a
man down on his luck. But then

Stanhouse's is not the usual
hard-luck story, not by a long
shot.
He's lounging in the swim
ming pool behind his new
house while watching soap op
eras on his portable TV and
drinking a beer. The sun is hot,
as it tends to get in the desert,
but Stanhouse is well oiled. In
fact, he has more suntan lo
tion than chairs in the sparsely
furnished house.
"I have the Dodgers to thank
for all this," says Stanhouse, an
ex-pitcher who will soon be
come an ex-bachelor. One de
velopment is as remarkable as
the other.
"They've enabled me to sit
by (actually in) my pool and
drink cold suds out of Stan the
Man Unusual cups," he says.
"When the Lord gave out
brains, he gave me feet instead.

I've always landed on my feet.
The year I became a free agent,
I got all that publicity in the
World Series. The year I get cut,
there's a baseball strike, and
I'm the one that's getting
paid."
Even floating on his back,
Stanhouse does appear to have
landed on his feet. For
Stanhouse is not your usual un
employed baseball player. He
has earned $340,000 this sum
mer floating on his back. He'll
earn the same the next summer
and the summer after that and
the summer after that.
When the Dodgers waived
Stanhouse they chose to eat
the remaining $1.36 million of
what was once a $2.1 million
contract rather than allow him
a place on their roster. A large
gulp, even at today's prices.
But don't get the idea this is a

happy ending. As far as
Stanhouse is concerned it's no
ending at all. He doesn't be
lieve he's thrown his last
baseball in anger, although
he's worried about what peo
ple must think of a player
whose team would pay so
much to be rid of him.
He's bored doing little more
than collecting paychecks on
the first and 15th of every
month. And it's a desperate
kind of boredom, a kind that
gnaws at your insides like an ul
cer. It's not at all a lazy man's
kind of boredom. As far as
Stanhouse is concerned, he's in
exile, a place where you can go
a little crazy.
"How much can you do in a'
day?" he asks, as a man in jail
might ask. "You run, you work
out, you watch a few soap op
