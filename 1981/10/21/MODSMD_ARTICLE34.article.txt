The Stanford women's vol
leyball team will dive into ac
tion against their conference
rivals, the Fresno State Battlin'
Bulldogs at 7:30 p.m. tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cards, now 18-9 overall,
are coming off a good per
formance against Cal-State
Longbeach last Sunday after
noon. Stanford breezed by the
49ers in four games, 15-0,15-6,
1 *i-15, and 15-9. The win
brought the squad to 2-1 in
NorCal conference play.
Some new faces emerged as
key players for Stanford in the
victory over Longbeach.
Freshmen Susan Compton and
Brandace Hope each con
tributed valuable net strength
for the Cardinals. Sophomore
Bobbie Broer also was im
pressive in the win, adding
eight kills to the Cardinal total.
After facing the Battlin' Bull
dogs, Stanford will take to the
road for a Thursday night
matchup against the Santa
Clara Broncos. The Cards then

have a week off before meet
ing the rival San jose State
Spartans at home on Oct. 29.
Head coach Fred Sturm has
been emphasizing defense in
practice sessions this week. He
believes his squad's weakness
in the last two games has been
the result of surrendering too
many points.
His new coaching philoso
phy is based on the old sports
adage that the best offense is a
good defense.
"This week we will try to be a
stingy as possible in giving up
points," he said, "because we
have failed totighten upon de
fense when our opponents are
playing welJ."
Sturm said that he believes
tonight's opponents have the
potential to make the match
very competitive.
"Fresno State is capable of
playing very effective vol
leyball," he explained, "and,
although I've only seen them in
a game situation once, I believe
that they are a good, solid all
around team."
