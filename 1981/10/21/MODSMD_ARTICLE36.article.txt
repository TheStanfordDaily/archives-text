NSC officer fired
Washington — Maj. Gen. Robert Schweitzer,
the top military officer on the National Security
Council staff, was relieved of his White House
duties yesterday and sent back to the Army after
giving d hard-line speech about Soviet military
intentions that administration officials said was
unauthorized and "at some degree of variance"
with President Ronald Reagan's views.
Richard Allen, chief of the NSC staff, told re
porters it was with "great regret" that he had to
relieve Schweitzer but the general had broken a
rule that all public remarks by staff members
have to be cleared by Allen in advance.
Schweitzer, a highly officer, made
his remarks in a speech and subsequent ques
tion-and-answer session Monday before an au
dience of hundreds of Army officers and others
at the convention here of the Association of the
United States Army.
The meeting was open to the press and the as
sociation had put out press releases beforehand
advertising the panel discussion on "A global
srraiegic appraisal for the '80s" in which
Schweitzer took part. An account of his remarks
appeared in The Washington Post yesterday.
Allen said that he made up his mind to relieve
tho general after reading that account yesterday
morning. Reagan concurred in the decision and
said later in the day that he did not agree with
what the general had said. But he referred to
Schweitzer as "a fine soldier" whose services
will continue to be "of great benefit to the
country" in another post.
In his remarks, Schweitzer claimed that Mos
cow now has nuclear superiority over the Unit
ed States in all three legs of the strategic triad of
bombers and land-based and submarine-based
missiles, an assessment that is not accepted by
the Reagan administration. He spoke of a "drift
toward war" and said the "Soviets are on the
move; they are going to strike." The United
States, he claimed, was "in the greatest danger
that the republic has ever faced since its found
ing days."
Weinberger reassures NATO
Gleneagles, Scotland — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger assured European allies yes
terday that the United States would not "aban
don" them in time of limited nuclear war.
However, he said Washington would not
necessarily stagea nuclear missile attack if a bat
tletield nuclear weapon were released against
Western Europe.
Weinberger's remarks during a meeting of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense
ministers were in reaction to Western European
controversy over whether the United States
would sit back and let a limited nuclear war rage
in Europe while keeping U.S. territory safe from
Soviet attack.
Anti-nuclear activists have questioned the
willingness of the United States to get involved
in a limited nuclear war in Europe. They have
called a decision to deploy 572 new U.S. nuclear
missiles in Europe an attempt to remove the nu
clear link between the two continents.
This sentiment swelled over the weekend af
ter President Ronald Reagan told visiting Eu
ropean editors that nuclear attacks against
troops in Europe were possible "without it
bringing either one of the major superpowers
pushing the button."
Reagan's comment aroused a public outcry in
West Germany, where 250,000 demonstrators
marched two weeks ago to protest nuclear
weapons in Europe.
Soviets give support to PLO
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Bre/hnev, in a strong new sign of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, an
nounced yesterday that the Soviet Union was
awarding the PLO's Moscow office "official dip
lomatic status."
Arab diplomatic sources in Moscow con
sidered the move a Soviet and PLO response to
the strategic military alliance between the Unit
ed Stales and Israel announced in September.
They also said the Soviet action — while on the
surface little more than a protocol nicety — also
appeared to herald still closer political and mili
tary cooperation between Moscow and the

PLO.
Arafat, who arrived in Moscow on Monday,
told a news conference after his meeting with
Brezhnev that the announcement has "very
great political significance for the successful de
velopment of our struggle."
He said his talks with Soviet officials have
added importance in light of growing military
cooperation between the United States and Is
rael.
Arab sources in Moscow said talks between
Arafat and Soviet officials could include dis
cussions on air defense weapons for the PLO
and some said they expected an agreement on
new arms supplies.
In Beirut, Lebanon, a source close to the PLO
said, "I don't think this reflects much change
unless the Soviets are also providing weapons,
such as SAM-6 missiles."
North-South summit begins
Cancun, Mexico — The historic North-South
summit conference opens here tomorrow with
the U.S. delegation apprehensive that the talks
will be used to attack President Ronald Reagan
for rejecting the pleas of developing nations for
more financial aid.
Reagan will arrive here today and begin a
series of bilateral meetings that aides hope will
bring about a better understanding of the presi
dent's position and head off any acrimonious
debate about U.S. financial aid.
Immediately after arriving, he is scheduled to
meet with Mexican President jose Portillo, the
co-host. Later, both before and during the sum
mit conference, he is expected to meet in sepa
rate sessions with leaders from China, Nigeria,
the Philippines, India, Guyana, Nigeria, Vene
zuela, Saudi Arabia and Yugoslavia.
"These meetings should be very important
for the president," a Reagan foreign affairs ad
viser said. "It's a good opportunity for him to
meet face-to-face with other leaders and ex
plain our position."
Seven other industrial nations and 14 de
veloping nations will participate in the con
ference, which represents a success for the
Third World in its long attempt to organize a
concerted approach to economic reform.
The spotlight will be on Reagan, both be
cause the United States is a major source of as
sistance to poor nations and because Reagan,
rejecting the idea of "global negotiations," says
those nations now need to rely more on "the
magic of the marketplace" and less on aid for
their development.
Booze tax hike studied
Washington — The Reagan administration is
studying an increase in so-called "sin taxes" on
alcohol and tobacco, Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday.
Although Regan testified a month ago that
raising excise taxes would be "detrimental" to
the economy, he apparently relented under
pressure from Republican senators who want to
revise President Ronald Reagan's second
round austerity plan.
Meantime, chief White House economist
Murray Weidenbaum said a mild recession now
under way will increase unemploymentfrom its
September level of 7.5 percent to 8 percent by
the end of the year.
Weidenbaum told a group of business ex
ecutives that the administration would not re
sort to any "quick fixes" to reduce the jobless
rate since the president's program already in
cludes economy-stimulating tax cuts and
higher defense spending.
The administration officials' comments came
as Republican leaders in the Senate and House
met, but failed to reach agreement on, a revised
plan for cutting the budget and raising taxes to
meet Reagan's goal of limiting this fiscal year's
deficit to $43.1 billion.
In a related development, administration of
ficials said the recession may enlarge the
budget deficit for the fiscal year that began Oct.
1, requiring higher taxes to reach Reagan's goal
of a balanced budget by 1984.
The concession was made by Marina Picciot
to, assistant budget director, and Jerry Jordan, a
member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, in testimony before the Senate
Budget Commmittee.

Britain aids Sinai peace forces
London — Responding to an urgent U.S. re
quest, Britain is ready to join France and Italy in
contributing troops to the multinational Sinai
peace-keeping force called for under the Camp
David accords, according to European diplo
matic sources.
The British decision is contingent, the sources
said, on the 10 members of the European Eco
nomic Community agreeing on a formula for
tying participation in the Sinai force to progress
toward a comprehensive Middle East peace set
tlement, including solution of the problem of
Palestinian self-determination.
The favored approach appears to be the Eu
ropean Community's encouragement, without
formal endorsement, of someform of the eight
point peace plan suggested earlier this year by
Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia, according
to several European diplomats. The sources said
they expected a statement from the European
Community countries within the next few days
linking the plan with formal agreement by Brit
ain, France and Italy to participate in the Sinai
force.
The Reagan administration is pressing for a
declaration of European participation in the Si
nai force to carry the Camp David peace proc
ess through Israel's scheduled withdrawal from
the last third of the Sinai next April 26.
Park budget cuts hinted
Washington — The Reagan administration,
apparently beginning to carve away at some of
the federal government's traditional sacred
cows, is considering raising fees and decreasing
services in the national parks.
According to Interior Department docu
ments that administration officials labeled as
"confidential" and "preliminary," Interior Sec
retary James Watt and his staff have been con
sidering cutting the park services by an addi
tional $70 million in this fiscal year.
The result of such cuts would be either clos
ing parks — an option key Interior Department
officials consider unlikely — or reducing ser
vices and raising fees, according to the budget
analysis for the Interior Department.
Interior Department officials yesterday gave
the Interior subcommittee a proposed 1982
budget that calls for additional cuts of $37.5 mil
lion from "park management activity," which
includes the kinds of facilities that directly af
fect park visitors. Park management funds for
fiscal 1982 have already been reduced about $33
million.
National Park Service Director Russell
Dickenson said the cut would mean reduced
hours of operation, cutting in camping opera
tions and changes in park services. For example,
guided tours would be reduced and demon
strations by rangers might be limited dramati
cally because of the cuts.
Stocks up but forecast gloomy
The stock market turned higher yesterday,
halting a recent slide, with oil issues leading the
advance.
Airline, financial and steel stocks also posted
broad gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks, which fell 4.56 Monday after shedding
21.31 points last week, rose 4.75 to close at
851.88.
The number of shares rising in price held an
almost 2-1 lead over losers on the New York
Stock Exchange.
The gains came despite further evidence of a
declining economy.
The Commerce Department said personal
spending, a previous strong point in the econo
my, slowed sharply in September.
Administration officials, appearing before
the Senate Budget Committee, hinted strongly
that it may be impossible to balance the federal
budget by 1984 as President Ronald Reagan has
repeatedly promised.
Today's weather
Clouds and local fog this morning burning off
by afternoon. Mild but hazy afternoons
through Friday. Lows today 40s to mid 50s. Highs
60s to low 70s. Winds continue westerly 10 to 20
mph afternoons.

NSC officer fired
Washington — Maj. Gen. Robert Schweitzer,
the top military officer on the National Security
Council staff, was relieved of his White House
duties yesterday and sent back to the Army after
giving d hard-line speech about Soviet military
intentions that administration officials said was
unauthorized and "at some degree of variance"
with President Ronald Reagan's views.
Richard Allen, chief of the NSC staff, told re
porters it was with "great regret" that he had to
relieve Schweitzer but the general had broken a
rule that all public remarks by staff members
have to be cleared by Allen in advance.
Schweitzer, a highly officer, made
his remarks in a speech and subsequent ques
tion-and-answer session Monday before an au
dience of hundreds of Army officers and others
at the convention here of the Association of the
United States Army.
The meeting was open to the press and the as
sociation had put out press releases beforehand
advertising the panel discussion on "A global
srraiegic appraisal for the '80s" in which
Schweitzer took part. An account of his remarks
appeared in The Washington Post yesterday.
Allen said that he made up his mind to relieve
tho general after reading that account yesterday
morning. Reagan concurred in the decision and
said later in the day that he did not agree with
what the general had said. But he referred to
Schweitzer as "a fine soldier" whose services
will continue to be "of great benefit to the
country" in another post.
In his remarks, Schweitzer claimed that Mos
cow now has nuclear superiority over the Unit
ed States in all three legs of the strategic triad of
bombers and land-based and submarine-based
missiles, an assessment that is not accepted by
the Reagan administration. He spoke of a "drift
toward war" and said the "Soviets are on the
move; they are going to strike." The United
States, he claimed, was "in the greatest danger
that the republic has ever faced since its found
ing days."
Weinberger reassures NATO
Gleneagles, Scotland — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger assured European allies yes
terday that the United States would not "aban
don" them in time of limited nuclear war.
However, he said Washington would not
necessarily stagea nuclear missile attack if a bat
tletield nuclear weapon were released against
Western Europe.
Weinberger's remarks during a meeting of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense
ministers were in reaction to Western European
controversy over whether the United States
would sit back and let a limited nuclear war rage
in Europe while keeping U.S. territory safe from
Soviet attack.
Anti-nuclear activists have questioned the
willingness of the United States to get involved
in a limited nuclear war in Europe. They have
called a decision to deploy 572 new U.S. nuclear
missiles in Europe an attempt to remove the nu
clear link between the two continents.
This sentiment swelled over the weekend af
ter President Ronald Reagan told visiting Eu
ropean editors that nuclear attacks against
troops in Europe were possible "without it
bringing either one of the major superpowers
pushing the button."
Reagan's comment aroused a public outcry in
West Germany, where 250,000 demonstrators
marched two weeks ago to protest nuclear
weapons in Europe.
Soviets give support to PLO
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Bre/hnev, in a strong new sign of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, an
nounced yesterday that the Soviet Union was
awarding the PLO's Moscow office "official dip
lomatic status."
Arab diplomatic sources in Moscow con
sidered the move a Soviet and PLO response to
the strategic military alliance between the Unit
ed Stales and Israel announced in September.
They also said the Soviet action — while on the
surface little more than a protocol nicety — also
appeared to herald still closer political and mili
tary cooperation between Moscow and the

PLO.
Arafat, who arrived in Moscow on Monday,
told a news conference after his meeting with
Brezhnev that the announcement has "very
great political significance for the successful de
velopment of our struggle."
He said his talks with Soviet officials have
added importance in light of growing military
cooperation between the United States and Is
rael.
Arab sources in Moscow said talks between
Arafat and Soviet officials could include dis
cussions on air defense weapons for the PLO
and some said they expected an agreement on
new arms supplies.
In Beirut, Lebanon, a source close to the PLO
said, "I don't think this reflects much change
unless the Soviets are also providing weapons,
such as SAM-6 missiles."
North-South summit begins
Cancun, Mexico — The historic North-South
summit conference opens here tomorrow with
the U.S. delegation apprehensive that the talks
will be used to attack President Ronald Reagan
for rejecting the pleas of developing nations for
more financial aid.
Reagan will arrive here today and begin a
series of bilateral meetings that aides hope will
bring about a better understanding of the presi
dent's position and head off any acrimonious
debate about U.S. financial aid.
Immediately after arriving, he is scheduled to
meet with Mexican President jose Portillo, the
co-host. Later, both before and during the sum
mit conference, he is expected to meet in sepa
rate sessions with leaders from China, Nigeria,
the Philippines, India, Guyana, Nigeria, Vene
zuela, Saudi Arabia and Yugoslavia.
"These meetings should be very important
for the president," a Reagan foreign affairs ad
viser said. "It's a good opportunity for him to
meet face-to-face with other leaders and ex
plain our position."
Seven other industrial nations and 14 de
veloping nations will participate in the con
ference, which represents a success for the
Third World in its long attempt to organize a
concerted approach to economic reform.
The spotlight will be on Reagan, both be
cause the United States is a major source of as
sistance to poor nations and because Reagan,
rejecting the idea of "global negotiations," says
those nations now need to rely more on "the
magic of the marketplace" and less on aid for
their development.
Booze tax hike studied
Washington — The Reagan administration is
studying an increase in so-called "sin taxes" on
alcohol and tobacco, Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday.
Although Regan testified a month ago that
raising excise taxes would be "detrimental" to
the economy, he apparently relented under
pressure from Republican senators who want to
revise President Ronald Reagan's second
round austerity plan.
Meantime, chief White House economist
Murray Weidenbaum said a mild recession now
under way will increase unemploymentfrom its
September level of 7.5 percent to 8 percent by
the end of the year.
Weidenbaum told a group of business ex
ecutives that the administration would not re
sort to any "quick fixes" to reduce the jobless
rate since the president's program already in
cludes economy-stimulating tax cuts and
higher defense spending.
The administration officials' comments came
as Republican leaders in the Senate and House
met, but failed to reach agreement on, a revised
plan for cutting the budget and raising taxes to
meet Reagan's goal of limiting this fiscal year's
deficit to $43.1 billion.
In a related development, administration of
ficials said the recession may enlarge the
budget deficit for the fiscal year that began Oct.
1, requiring higher taxes to reach Reagan's goal
of a balanced budget by 1984.
The concession was made by Marina Picciot
to, assistant budget director, and Jerry Jordan, a
member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, in testimony before the Senate
Budget Commmittee.

Britain aids Sinai peace forces
London — Responding to an urgent U.S. re
quest, Britain is ready to join France and Italy in
contributing troops to the multinational Sinai
peace-keeping force called for under the Camp
David accords, according to European diplo
matic sources.
The British decision is contingent, the sources
said, on the 10 members of the European Eco
nomic Community agreeing on a formula for
tying participation in the Sinai force to progress
toward a comprehensive Middle East peace set
tlement, including solution of the problem of
Palestinian self-determination.
The favored approach appears to be the Eu
ropean Community's encouragement, without
formal endorsement, of someform of the eight
point peace plan suggested earlier this year by
Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia, according
to several European diplomats. The sources said
they expected a statement from the European
Community countries within the next few days
linking the plan with formal agreement by Brit
ain, France and Italy to participate in the Sinai
force.
The Reagan administration is pressing for a
declaration of European participation in the Si
nai force to carry the Camp David peace proc
ess through Israel's scheduled withdrawal from
the last third of the Sinai next April 26.
Park budget cuts hinted
Washington — The Reagan administration,
apparently beginning to carve away at some of
the federal government's traditional sacred
cows, is considering raising fees and decreasing
services in the national parks.
According to Interior Department docu
ments that administration officials labeled as
"confidential" and "preliminary," Interior Sec
retary James Watt and his staff have been con
sidering cutting the park services by an addi
tional $70 million in this fiscal year.
The result of such cuts would be either clos
ing parks — an option key Interior Department
officials consider unlikely — or reducing ser
vices and raising fees, according to the budget
analysis for the Interior Department.
Interior Department officials yesterday gave
the Interior subcommittee a proposed 1982
budget that calls for additional cuts of $37.5 mil
lion from "park management activity," which
includes the kinds of facilities that directly af
fect park visitors. Park management funds for
fiscal 1982 have already been reduced about $33
million.
National Park Service Director Russell
Dickenson said the cut would mean reduced
hours of operation, cutting in camping opera
tions and changes in park services. For example,
guided tours would be reduced and demon
strations by rangers might be limited dramati
cally because of the cuts.

According to Interior Department docu
ments that administration officials labeled as
"confidential" and "preliminary," Interior Sec
retary James Watt and his staff have been con
sidering cutting the park services by an addi
tional $70 million in this fiscal year.
The result of such cuts would be either clos
ing parks — an option key Interior Department
officials consider unlikely — or reducing ser
vices and raising fees, according to the budget
analysis for the Interior Department.
Interior Department officials yesterday gave
the Interior subcommittee a proposed 1982
budget that calls for additional cuts of $37.5 mil
lion from "park management activity," which
includes the kinds of facilities that directly af
fect park visitors. Park management funds for
fiscal 1982 have already been reduced about $33
million.
National Park Service Director Russell
Dickenson said the cut would mean reduced
hours of operation, cutting in camping opera
tions and changes in park services. For example,
guided tours would be reduced and demon
strations by rangers might be limited dramati
cally because of the cuts.
Stocks up but forecast gloomy
The stock market turned higher yesterday,
halting a recent slide, with oil issues leading the
advance.
Airline, financial and steel stocks also posted
broad gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks, which fell 4.56 Monday after shedding
21.31 points last week, rose 4.75 to close at
851.88.
The number of shares rising in price held an
almost 2-1 lead over losers on the New York
Stock Exchange.
The gains came despite further evidence of a
declining economy.
The Commerce Department said personal
spending, a previous strong point in the econo
my, slowed sharply in September.
Administration officials, appearing before
the Senate Budget Committee, hinted strongly
that it may be impossible to balance the federal
budget by 1984 as President Ronald Reagan has
repeatedly promised.

NSC officer fired
Washington — Maj. Gen. Robert Schweitzer,
the top military officer on the National Security
Council staff, was relieved of his White House
duties yesterday and sent back to the Army after
giving d hard-line speech about Soviet military
intentions that administration officials said was
unauthorized and "at some degree of variance"
with President Ronald Reagan's views.
Richard Allen, chief of the NSC staff, told re
porters it was with "great regret" that he had to
relieve Schweitzer but the general had broken a
rule that all public remarks by staff members
have to be cleared by Allen in advance.
Schweitzer, a highly officer, made
his remarks in a speech and subsequent ques
tion-and-answer session Monday before an au
dience of hundreds of Army officers and others
at the convention here of the Association of the
United States Army.
The meeting was open to the press and the as
sociation had put out press releases beforehand
advertising the panel discussion on "A global
srraiegic appraisal for the '80s" in which
Schweitzer took part. An account of his remarks
appeared in The Washington Post yesterday.
Allen said that he made up his mind to relieve
tho general after reading that account yesterday
morning. Reagan concurred in the decision and
said later in the day that he did not agree with
what the general had said. But he referred to
Schweitzer as "a fine soldier" whose services
will continue to be "of great benefit to the
country" in another post.
In his remarks, Schweitzer claimed that Mos
cow now has nuclear superiority over the Unit
ed States in all three legs of the strategic triad of
bombers and land-based and submarine-based
missiles, an assessment that is not accepted by
the Reagan administration. He spoke of a "drift
toward war" and said the "Soviets are on the
move; they are going to strike." The United
States, he claimed, was "in the greatest danger
that the republic has ever faced since its found
ing days."
Weinberger reassures NATO
Gleneagles, Scotland — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger assured European allies yes
terday that the United States would not "aban
don" them in time of limited nuclear war.
However, he said Washington would not
necessarily stagea nuclear missile attack if a bat
tletield nuclear weapon were released against
Western Europe.
Weinberger's remarks during a meeting of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense
ministers were in reaction to Western European
controversy over whether the United States
would sit back and let a limited nuclear war rage
in Europe while keeping U.S. territory safe from
Soviet attack.
Anti-nuclear activists have questioned the
willingness of the United States to get involved
in a limited nuclear war in Europe. They have
called a decision to deploy 572 new U.S. nuclear
missiles in Europe an attempt to remove the nu
clear link between the two continents.
This sentiment swelled over the weekend af
ter President Ronald Reagan told visiting Eu
ropean editors that nuclear attacks against
troops in Europe were possible "without it
bringing either one of the major superpowers
pushing the button."
Reagan's comment aroused a public outcry in
West Germany, where 250,000 demonstrators
marched two weeks ago to protest nuclear
weapons in Europe.
Soviets give support to PLO
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Bre/hnev, in a strong new sign of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, an
nounced yesterday that the Soviet Union was
awarding the PLO's Moscow office "official dip
lomatic status."
Arab diplomatic sources in Moscow con
sidered the move a Soviet and PLO response to
the strategic military alliance between the Unit
ed Stales and Israel announced in September.
They also said the Soviet action — while on the
surface little more than a protocol nicety — also
appeared to herald still closer political and mili
tary cooperation between Moscow and the

PLO.
Arafat, who arrived in Moscow on Monday,
told a news conference after his meeting with
Brezhnev that the announcement has "very
great political significance for the successful de
velopment of our struggle."
He said his talks with Soviet officials have
added importance in light of growing military
cooperation between the United States and Is
rael.
Arab sources in Moscow said talks between
Arafat and Soviet officials could include dis
cussions on air defense weapons for the PLO
and some said they expected an agreement on
new arms supplies.
In Beirut, Lebanon, a source close to the PLO
said, "I don't think this reflects much change
unless the Soviets are also providing weapons,
such as SAM-6 missiles."
North-South summit begins
Cancun, Mexico — The historic North-South
summit conference opens here tomorrow with
the U.S. delegation apprehensive that the talks
will be used to attack President Ronald Reagan
for rejecting the pleas of developing nations for
more financial aid.
Reagan will arrive here today and begin a
series of bilateral meetings that aides hope will
bring about a better understanding of the presi
dent's position and head off any acrimonious
debate about U.S. financial aid.
Immediately after arriving, he is scheduled to
meet with Mexican President jose Portillo, the
co-host. Later, both before and during the sum
mit conference, he is expected to meet in sepa
rate sessions with leaders from China, Nigeria,
the Philippines, India, Guyana, Nigeria, Vene
zuela, Saudi Arabia and Yugoslavia.
"These meetings should be very important
for the president," a Reagan foreign affairs ad
viser said. "It's a good opportunity for him to
meet face-to-face with other leaders and ex
plain our position."
Seven other industrial nations and 14 de
veloping nations will participate in the con
ference, which represents a success for the
Third World in its long attempt to organize a
concerted approach to economic reform.
The spotlight will be on Reagan, both be
cause the United States is a major source of as
sistance to poor nations and because Reagan,
rejecting the idea of "global negotiations," says
those nations now need to rely more on "the
magic of the marketplace" and less on aid for
their development.
Booze tax hike studied
Washington — The Reagan administration is
studying an increase in so-called "sin taxes" on
alcohol and tobacco, Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday.
Although Regan testified a month ago that
raising excise taxes would be "detrimental" to
the economy, he apparently relented under
pressure from Republican senators who want to
revise President Ronald Reagan's second
round austerity plan.
Meantime, chief White House economist
Murray Weidenbaum said a mild recession now
under way will increase unemploymentfrom its
September level of 7.5 percent to 8 percent by
the end of the year.
Weidenbaum told a group of business ex
ecutives that the administration would not re
sort to any "quick fixes" to reduce the jobless
rate since the president's program already in
cludes economy-stimulating tax cuts and
higher defense spending.
The administration officials' comments came
as Republican leaders in the Senate and House
met, but failed to reach agreement on, a revised
plan for cutting the budget and raising taxes to
meet Reagan's goal of limiting this fiscal year's
deficit to $43.1 billion.
In a related development, administration of
ficials said the recession may enlarge the
budget deficit for the fiscal year that began Oct.
1, requiring higher taxes to reach Reagan's goal
of a balanced budget by 1984.
The concession was made by Marina Picciot
to, assistant budget director, and Jerry Jordan, a
member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, in testimony before the Senate
Budget Commmittee.

Britain aids Sinai peace forces
London — Responding to an urgent U.S. re
quest, Britain is ready to join France and Italy in
contributing troops to the multinational Sinai
peace-keeping force called for under the Camp
David accords, according to European diplo
matic sources.
The British decision is contingent, the sources
said, on the 10 members of the European Eco
nomic Community agreeing on a formula for
tying participation in the Sinai force to progress
toward a comprehensive Middle East peace set
tlement, including solution of the problem of
Palestinian self-determination.
The favored approach appears to be the Eu
ropean Community's encouragement, without
formal endorsement, of someform of the eight
point peace plan suggested earlier this year by
Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia, according
to several European diplomats. The sources said
they expected a statement from the European
Community countries within the next few days
linking the plan with formal agreement by Brit
ain, France and Italy to participate in the Sinai
force.
The Reagan administration is pressing for a
declaration of European participation in the Si
nai force to carry the Camp David peace proc
ess through Israel's scheduled withdrawal from
the last third of the Sinai next April 26.
Park budget cuts hinted
Washington — The Reagan administration,
apparently beginning to carve away at some of
the federal government's traditional sacred
cows, is considering raising fees and decreasing
services in the national parks.
According to Interior Department docu

The British decision is contingent, the sources
said, on the 10 members of the European Eco
nomic Community agreeing on a formula for
tying participation in the Sinai force to progress
toward a comprehensive Middle East peace set
tlement, including solution of the problem of
Palestinian self-determination.
The favored approach appears to be the Eu
ropean Community's encouragement, without
formal endorsement, of someform of the eight
point peace plan suggested earlier this year by
Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia, according
to several European diplomats. The sources said
they expected a statement from the European
Community countries within the next few days
linking the plan with formal agreement by Brit
ain, France and Italy to participate in the Sinai
force.
The Reagan administration is pressing for a
declaration of European participation in the Si
nai force to carry the Camp David peace proc
ess through Israel's scheduled withdrawal from
the last third of the Sinai next April 26.
Park budget cuts hinted
Washington — The Reagan administration,
apparently beginning to carve away at some of
the federal government's traditional sacred
cows, is considering raising fees and decreasing
services in the national parks.
According to Interior Department docu
ments that administration officials labeled as
"confidential" and "preliminary," Interior Sec
retary James Watt and his staff have been con
sidering cutting the park services by an addi
tional $70 million in this fiscal year.
The result of such cuts would be either clos
ing parks — an option key Interior Department
officials consider unlikely — or reducing ser
vices and raising fees, according to the budget
analysis for the Interior Department.
Interior Department officials yesterday gave
the Interior subcommittee a proposed 1982
budget that calls for additional cuts of $37.5 mil
lion from "park management activity," which
includes the kinds of facilities that directly af
fect park visitors. Park management funds for
fiscal 1982 have already been reduced about $33
million.
National Park Service Director Russell
Dickenson said the cut would mean reduced
hours of operation, cutting in camping opera
tions and changes in park services. For example,
guided tours would be reduced and demon
strations by rangers might be limited dramati
cally because of the cuts.
Stocks up but forecast gloomy
The stock market turned higher yesterday,
halting a recent slide, with oil issues leading the
advance.
Airline, financial and steel stocks also posted
broad gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks, which fell 4.56 Monday after shedding
21.31 points last week, rose 4.75 to close at
851.88.
The number of shares rising in price held an
almost 2-1 lead over losers on the New York
Stock Exchange.
The gains came despite further evidence of a
declining economy.
The Commerce Department said personal
spending, a previous strong point in the econo
my, slowed sharply in September.
Administration officials, appearing before
the Senate Budget Committee, hinted strongly
that it may be impossible to balance the federal
budget by 1984 as President Ronald Reagan has
repeatedly promised.

NSC officer fired
Washington — Maj. Gen. Robert Schweitzer,
the top military officer on the National Security
Council staff, was relieved of his White House
duties yesterday and sent back to the Army after
giving d hard-line speech about Soviet military
intentions that administration officials said was
unauthorized and "at some degree of variance"
with President Ronald Reagan's views.
Richard Allen, chief of the NSC staff, told re
porters it was with "great regret" that he had to
relieve Schweitzer but the general had broken a
rule that all public remarks by staff members
have to be cleared by Allen in advance.
Schweitzer, a highly officer, made
his remarks in a speech and subsequent ques
tion-and-answer session Monday before an au
dience of hundreds of Army officers and others
at the convention here of the Association of the
United States Army.
The meeting was open to the press and the as
sociation had put out press releases beforehand
advertising the panel discussion on "A global
srraiegic appraisal for the '80s" in which
Schweitzer took part. An account of his remarks
appeared in The Washington Post yesterday.
Allen said that he made up his mind to relieve
tho general after reading that account yesterday
morning. Reagan concurred in the decision and
said later in the day that he did not agree with
what the general had said. But he referred to
Schweitzer as "a fine soldier" whose services
will continue to be "of great benefit to the
country" in another post.
In his remarks, Schweitzer claimed that Mos
cow now has nuclear superiority over the Unit
ed States in all three legs of the strategic triad of
bombers and land-based and submarine-based
missiles, an assessment that is not accepted by
the Reagan administration. He spoke of a "drift
toward war" and said the "Soviets are on the
move; they are going to strike." The United
States, he claimed, was "in the greatest danger
that the republic has ever faced since its found
ing days."
Weinberger reassures NATO
Gleneagles, Scotland — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger assured European allies yes
terday that the United States would not "aban
don" them in time of limited nuclear war.
However, he said Washington would not
necessarily stagea nuclear missile attack if a bat
tletield nuclear weapon were released against
Western Europe.
Weinberger's remarks during a meeting of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense
ministers were in reaction to Western European
controversy over whether the United States
would sit back and let a limited nuclear war rage
in Europe while keeping U.S. territory safe from
Soviet attack.
Anti-nuclear activists have questioned the
willingness of the United States to get involved
in a limited nuclear war in Europe. They have
called a decision to deploy 572 new U.S. nuclear
missiles in Europe an attempt to remove the nu
clear link between the two continents.
This sentiment swelled over the weekend af
ter President Ronald Reagan told visiting Eu
ropean editors that nuclear attacks against
troops in Europe were possible "without it
bringing either one of the major superpowers
pushing the button."
Reagan's comment aroused a public outcry in
West Germany, where 250,000 demonstrators
marched two weeks ago to protest nuclear
weapons in Europe.
Soviets give support to PLO
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Bre/hnev, in a strong new sign of support for
the Palestine Liberation Organization, an
nounced yesterday that the Soviet Union was
awarding the PLO's Moscow office "official dip
lomatic status."
Arab diplomatic sources in Moscow con
sidered the move a Soviet and PLO response to
the strategic military alliance between the Unit
ed Stales and Israel announced in September.
They also said the Soviet action — while on the
surface little more than a protocol nicety — also
appeared to herald still closer political and mili
tary cooperation between Moscow and the

PLO.
Arafat, who arrived in Moscow on Monday,
told a news conference after his meeting with
Brezhnev that the announcement has "very
great political significance for the successful de
velopment of our struggle."
He said his talks with Soviet officials have
added importance in light of growing military
cooperation between the United States and Is
rael.
Arab sources in Moscow said talks between
Arafat and Soviet officials could include dis
cussions on air defense weapons for the PLO
and some said they expected an agreement on
new arms supplies.
In Beirut, Lebanon, a source close to the PLO
said, "I don't think this reflects much change
unless the Soviets are also providing weapons,
such as SAM-6 missiles."
North-South summit begins
Cancun, Mexico — The historic North-South
summit conference opens here tomorrow with
the U.S. delegation apprehensive that the talks
will be used to attack President Ronald Reagan
for rejecting the pleas of developing nations for
more financial aid.
Reagan will arrive here today and begin a
series of bilateral meetings that aides hope will
bring about a better understanding of the presi
dent's position and head off any acrimonious
debate about U.S. financial aid.
Immediately after arriving, he is scheduled to
meet with Mexican President jose Portillo, the
co-host. Later, both before and during the sum
mit conference, he is expected to meet in sepa
rate sessions with leaders from China, Nigeria,
the Philippines, India, Guyana, Nigeria, Vene
zuela, Saudi Arabia and Yugoslavia.
"These meetings should be very important
for the president," a Reagan foreign affairs ad
viser said. "It's a good opportunity for him to
meet face-to-face with other leaders and ex
plain our position."
Seven other industrial nations and 14 de
veloping nations will participate in the con
ference, which represents a success for the
Third World in its long attempt to organize a
concerted approach to economic reform.
The spotlight will be on Reagan, both be
cause the United States is a major source of as
sistance to poor nations and because Reagan,
rejecting the idea of "global negotiations," says
those nations now need to rely more on "the
magic of the marketplace" and less on aid for
their development.
Booze tax hike studied
Washington — The Reagan administration is
studying an increase in so-called "sin taxes" on
alcohol and tobacco, Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday.
Although Regan testified a month ago that
raising excise taxes would be "detrimental" to
the economy, he apparently relented under
pressure from Republican senators who want to
revise President Ronald Reagan's second
round austerity plan.
Meantime, chief White House economist
Murray Weidenbaum said a mild recession now
under way will increase unemploymentfrom its
September level of 7.5 percent to 8 percent by
the end of the year.
Weidenbaum told a group of business ex
ecutives that the administration would not re
sort to any "quick fixes" to reduce the jobless
rate since the president's program already in
cludes economy-stimulating tax cuts and
higher defense spending.
The administration officials' comments came
as Republican leaders in the Senate and House
met, but failed to reach agreement on, a revised
plan for cutting the budget and raising taxes to
meet Reagan's goal of limiting this fiscal year's
deficit to $43.1 billion.
In a related development, administration of
ficials said the recession may enlarge the
budget deficit for the fiscal year that began Oct.
1, requiring higher taxes to reach Reagan's goal
of a balanced budget by 1984.
The concession was made by Marina Picciot
to, assistant budget director, and Jerry Jordan, a
member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, in testimony before the Senate
Budget Commmittee.

Britain aids Sinai peace forces
London — Responding to an urgent U.S. re
quest, Britain is ready to join France and Italy in
contributing troops to the multinational Sinai
peace-keeping force called for under the Camp
David accords, according to European diplo
matic sources.
The British decision is contingent, the sources
said, on the 10 members of the European Eco
nomic Community agreeing on a formula for
