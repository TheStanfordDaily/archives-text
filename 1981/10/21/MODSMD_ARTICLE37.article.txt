# Reshelving fee deters unnecessary buying
## 
### Ann Pedreira 
Students may have grumbled, but
the recently implemented Bookstore
policy of charging a 50 cent "reshelv
ing fee" for every book returned
seems to have solved the Bookstore's
book supply problem.
The new policy was designed "to
create an incentive not to buy books
that you aren't going to use, so other
students can buy them," according
to Bookstore manager Eldon Speed.
"Our first responsibility is to get the
books into the hands of students tak
ing classes," he said.
Students buying required books
for classes often find empty shelves
when they get to the Bookstore. The
Bookstore normally orders enough
for the maximum anticipated size of a
class, but often the number of people
considering a class excedes the
number of people whoend uptaking
the course.
Consequently, some students must
wait indefinitely for books they need
immediately. Ironically, many books
disappear only to reappear days, or
weeks later at the book return win
dow. But by that time, the Bookstore
may have already reordered books
and created an overabundance of
them.
Last winter and spring, the Book
store attempted to make students
more aware of the problem by print
ing leaflets designed to discourage
unnecessary book buying. But ac
cording to Speed, only this quarter's
enactment of reshelving fees has
brought about "substantial reduc
tions" in book returns.
Most students asked said they find

it hard to believe it costs the Book
store 50 cents to reshelve each book
and thought a lower fee would be
more acceptable. But after returning
money on the book, preparing the
book for resale, and finally reshelv
ing the book to its proper place, "Fif
ty cents is not too high at all," said
Speed. "In fact, we figured the actual
cost to be 67 cents per book," he
added.
To alleviate that problem, one stu
dent returning books responded,
"I'll go reshelve it myself."
The Bookstore made provisions for
students whose classes were can
celled or postponed, according to
Speed. "Clerks were made aware of
this possibility and were requested
not to charge those students," he ex
plained.
The main concern of the Book
store, he said, is not to make a greater
profit from the books they sell by
charging a reshelving fee, but rather
to prevent people from buying
books for classes they aren't sure
they will take.
Another change at the Bookstore
this fall is the new security alarm sys
tem. In an ongoing effort to combat
shoplifting, the Bookstore's new
method of crime prevention is, as de
scribed "one of the more
visual approaches." Speed said he
found the system to be necessary this
year because of last year's $200,000
loss to shoplifters.
"Rebates could have been
doubled last year had this shrinkage
not occurred," Speed said, even
though only a small number of peo
ple were responsible.
