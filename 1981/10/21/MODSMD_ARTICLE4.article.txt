# Board searches for young perspectives
## A 						tradition of dedication in Stanford trustees 
### Joan O'Connell (second in a series) 
It was a "small group of dedi
cated men," as President (Ray
Lyman) Wilbur referred to
them, who set about in the De
pression of the 1930s to release
the 19th century's grasp on the
Stanford endowment and keep
it from sinking with the value of
the railroad bonds it was re
quired to hold. . .Then most of
these same dedicated men,
surely encouraged by equally
dedicated women, helped the
University organize and put
into operation the fund-raising
programs that have had very
much to do with the develop
ment of the great schools and
distinguished departments we
are so proud of today. — from
"Historical Perspective" in
President Donald Kennedy's
inaugural program.
Today the groupislargerand
those "equally dedicated
women" are theoretically in a
position to make the decisions
as well as encourage their male
counterparts. Today's uncer
tain economic conditions pro
vide the framework within
which the trustees must try to
meet the soaring expenses and
energy bills the University is re
quired to pay.
A big part of what the group
continues to do still involves
fund raising. One trustee ex

plained that the board tends to
fill vacancies in the 35 available
chairs with persons likely to be
of the most use to the body at a
particular time.
It may mean having more
women on the board, or an
other doctor or lawyer, or
someone in the business com
munity from a certain area of
the country targeted for more
profitable development. Most
frequently trustees are picked
on the basis of the pivotal fund
raising capability which follows
from one or more of the above
qualities.
This fact is one which neither
board members nor adminis
trators tend to discuss com
fortably. More often, they will
stress a potential candidate's
dedication to Stanford and a
willingness to preserve the aca
demic integrity of the Univer
sity.
Money is by no means the
overriding value in board de
cision making. In fact, trustee
Barbara Maxwell pointed to
occasions when the board
voted to refuse large gifts or
donations as times when she
was most proud to be a trustee.
"Just last year we had an op
portunity to receive a good
deal of money. We talked and
talked about it and finally we
turned it down, because there
were just too many strings at
tached. It was very gratifying to

see that principles come ahead
of money," she said.
But Maxwell also acknowl
edged that fund raising is the
key task for the board to tackle.
"If we don't keep the Univer
sity going, everything else be
comes moot."
We asked Board President
William Kimball what makes a
good trustee.

"I look forwhat I call thefour
w's in a trustee; work, wisdom,
wealth or access to wealth and
wit. If a trustee doesn't have
two out of the first three, then
they probably can't really do
the job. An ideal trustee would
have all of those factors," Kim
ball said.
Kimball also noted that when
the board is nominating and
approving new members, they
tend to go in spurts, appointing
several lawyers or perhaps per
sons especially interested in

different areas of the Univer
sity.
"I think we have to look
where we need strengths and
then try to fill those slots," he
said.
Kimball joined others in the
belief that trustees do not rep
resent a specific constituency,
but rather the University as a
whole. This is an important
point, he noted, particularly
among alumni-elected trustees
who sometimes feel they
should especially represent
alumni interests.
Of the board's maximum of
35 seats, eight are reserved for
alumni-elected trustees who
serve a one-time, five-year
term. In this group, four are 36
years old or older, four are 35
years old or younger.
Maxwell said she thought it
was a good way to get younger
perspectives on the board.
The alumni-elected trustees
are appointed in a staggered
fashion, and Nancy Dietzof the
alumni asociation explained
that the procedure goes some
thing like this: Advertisements
are placed in the alumni
almanac and alumni are invited
to apply for a questionnaire
asking them personal, educa
tional and employment his
tory, as well as several essay
questions on why they want to
serve on the board.

Dietz said they expected
about 100 persons to return
those forms, at which point
that number will be narrowed'
down by theassociations' nom
inating committees and then
the entire alumni body will be
invited to cast their votes.
Currently alumni-elected
members on the board include
Nelson Dong, Frank Lodato,
Maxwell, George McCown,
Joellyn Murphy, John Packard,
Michael Ridley and Philip
Taubman. They enjoy the same
rights, privileges and status as
the rest of the board-ap
pointed members, the only dif
ference being that the other
board members may be reap
pointed for a second term. For
both groups the retirement age
is 70, a fact which prompted the
retirement of long-time board
member Robert Minge Brown
at last week's meeting.
We talked to Brown earlier
this week, and he shed some
interesting insights on the
board and its members.
Brown served a total of 16
years on the board, including a
term as its president, during
which he estimates that he

spent at least one third of his
time working on University
business. Brown has been
looked to for guidance and ad
vice by many of the members.
He, along with Parmer Fuller
and some other members who
have just recently gone off the
board after long years of ser
vice, were frequently referred
to as the "old timers" by other
trustees. Several trustees in fact
expressed some concern over
this.
"We seem to be changing
dramatically, it's hard to say
what is really going to happen
or who the new leaders will
be," said one trustee.
But Brown noted, "I think
experience moves people into
(key, pivotal roles). Experience
develops capabilities. When I
went on the board there were
no alumni-elected trustees and
no limit on terms. It takes a
while to get your feet wet. Af
ter a while somebody will
come along armed with that
experience." Brown added
that at present he sees the rela
tively young age of the board as
somewhat of a problem.
One area where particular
leadership qualities are most

often utilized is in the board's
committees. The two-day
board meetings usually feature
one day of meetings for the
three major committees, In
vestments, Finance & Adminis
tration and Academic Affairs &
Development. Special commit
tees have been set up to con
sider nominations, audit,
budget, venture capital, real
estate, investment responsi
bility, investment policy and
evaluations. There is also an ad
hoc committee on the Medical
Center and a the very impor
tant Major Gifts Committee
which works closely with the
fundraising office.
Trustee Nancy Barry Munger
serves as a member of that spe
cial committee in the capacity
of major gifts chairperson for
Los Angeles and overall chair
for Southern California. The
country is divided up into
roughly five fundraising areas
— the East, the Midwest, the
Northwest, the San Francisco
Bay Area and the Southern Cal
ifornia area — and it is in this
capacity that the board is cur
rently receiving a lot of en
couragment from Kimball and
the development office to help

in the effort.
She is the only woman on
this committee and says her
"major thrust" on the board is
in the fund-raising capacity.
We spoke to both Munger
and Maxwell about what they
saw as the role of women on
the board. Munger said that
while the current female mem
bership of six seemed low, she
did not favor any concerted ef
forts to increase that number.
"Women add a lot to the
board when particularly
notable ones surface," she
said, adding, however, that she
felt that potential women
trustees should be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis, as are
other trustees.
Munger said her interest in
servng on the board is linked
most closely to her interest in
education and young people
— she is the mother of Six chil
dren and two stepchildren,
three of whom have attended
the University.She also sits on
the Hoover Board of Overseers
and is a Stanford Library As
sociate.
Brown also warned against
creating a quota of women or
minority members on the
board, but apparently for dif
ferent reasons.
"I think itwould be a mistake
to start a proportional, repre
sentational quota of men and
women on the board," Brown
said. "I don't think women by
and large are successful fun

draisers. Women at this level
are usually not corporate ex
ecutives, and if they are, they
are too busy with the pressures
of their businesses and addi
tional pressures because they
are women, to really be suc
cessful fundraisers.
"If you had a board which
was half women I think you
would find you had severely

handicapped yourself in terms
of fundraising," he added.
Maxwell said that while
there are sometimes "certain
areas of expertise where (the
board) does not seem to recog
nize the women members'
points of view quite as much,"
she always has felt that she was
considered an equal member.
Munger commented that
she thought "there is less dis
crimination on the Stanford
board than others I have sat
on."
We asked several of the
trustees just what it was about
being on the board which

prompts them to give so much
time and effort. It's not mone
tary compensation — the
trustees are a volunteer group,
although the University main
tains that it should not be a fi
nancial hardship for one to
serve.
In other words, explained
Brown, the University will pro
vide reimbursements for the
trustees' travel expenses. He
said these are sometimes han
dled in the form of the trustee
making a "donation" to Stan
ford in the amount of the travel
expenses and then being reim
bursed, allowing for a tax de
duction. Of course, many
trustees never put in fora reim
bursement, he said.
Friendships made on the
board may add a positive ele
ment to the group's get-to
gethers, but that still doesn't
explain why trustees are so
dedicated and hard working.
Rather, sentiments ex
pressed by trustees like
Munger and former trustee
and president Brown, seem to
sum up most of the board
members' feelings.
"What really charges me is
the amount I can learn," said
Munger, a 1945 alumna. "I
have a great opportunity for
personal growth. And it's excit
ing to be around a place where
therearestudents who may be
come the nation's future lead
ers."
"It's faith in the institution,"
said Brown. "Some of the older
trustees like me were in a
group that went to Stanford
within about four or five years
of each other. We felt intellec
tually stimulated there and we
wanted to be involved with an
organization which was and is
growing."
"The thing that impresses me
most about a fine university
like Stanford is that it outlast'
everything," Kimball said "You
go to Germany, England, Spain
and you'll find universities that
have outlasted 50, maybe 75
governments, systems, geo
graphical boundaries. No mat
ter what we do, it will just keep
going."
