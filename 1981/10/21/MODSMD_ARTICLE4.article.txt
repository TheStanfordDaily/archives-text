# Board searches for young perspectives
## A
						tradition of dedication in Stanford trustees 
### Joan O'Connell (second in a series) 
It was a "small group of dedi
cated men," as President (Ray
Lyman) Wilbur referred to
them, who set about in the De
pression of the 1930s to release
the 19th century's grasp on the
Stanford endowment and keep
it from sinking with the value of
the railroad bonds it was re
quired to hold. . .Then most of
these same dedicated men,
surely encouraged by equally
dedicated women, helped the
University organize and put
into operation the fund-raising
programs that have had very
much to do with the develop
ment of the great schools and
distinguished departments we
are so proud of today. â€” from
"Historical Perspective" in
President Donald Kennedy's
inaugural program.
Today the groupislargerand
those "equally dedicated
women" are theoretically in a
position to make the decisions
as well as encourage their male
counterparts. Today's uncer
tain economic conditions pro
vide the framework within
which the trustees must try to
meet the soaring expenses and
energy bills the University is re
quired to pay.
A big part of what the group
continues to do still involves
fund raising. One trustee ex

plained that the board tends to
fill vacancies in the 35 available
chairs with persons likely to be
of the most use to the body at a
particular time.
It may mean having more
women on the board, or an
other doctor or lawyer, or
someone in the business com
munity from a certain area of
the country targeted for more
profitable development. Most
frequently trustees are picked
on the basis of the pivotal fund
raising capability which follows
from one or more of the above
qualities.
This fact is one which neither
board members nor adminis
trators tend to discuss com
fortably. More often, they will
stress a potential candidate's
dedication to Stanford and a
willingness to preserve the aca
demic integrity of the Univer
sity.
Money is by no means the
overriding value in board de
cision making. In fact, trustee
Barbara Maxwell pointed to
occasions when the board
voted to refuse large gifts or
donations as times when she
was most proud to be a trustee.
"Just last year we had an op
portunity to receive a good
deal of money. We talked and
talked about it and finally we
turned it down, because there
were just too many strings at
tached. It was very gratifying to

see that principles come ahead
of money," she said.
But Maxwell also acknowl
edged that fund raising is the
key task for the board to tackle.
"If we don't keep the Univer
sity going, everything else be
comes moot."
We asked Board President
William Kimball what makes a
good trustee.

"I look forwhat I call thefour
w's in a trustee; work, wisdom,
wealth or access to wealth and
wit. If a trustee doesn't have
two out of the first three, then
they probably can't really do
the job. An ideal trustee would
have all of those factors," Kim
ball said.
Kimball also noted that when
the board is nominating and
approving new members, they
tend to go in spurts, appointing
several lawyers or perhaps per
sons especially interested in

different areas of the Univer
sity.
"I think we have to look
where we need strengths and
then try to fill those slots," he
said.
Kimball joined others in the
belief that trustees do not rep
resent a specific constituency,
but rather the University as a
whole. This is an important
point, he noted, particularly
among alumni-elected trustees
who sometimes feel they
should especially represent
alumni interests.
Of the board's maximum of
35 seats, eight are reserved for
alumni-elected trustees who
serve a one-time, five-year
term. In this group, four are 36
years old or older, four are 35
years old or younger.
Maxwell said she thought it
was a good way to get younger
perspectives on the board.
The alumni-elected trustees
are appointed in a staggered
fashion, and Nancy Dietzof the
alumni asociation explained
that the procedure goes some
thing like this: Advertisements
are placed in the alumni
almanac and alumni are invited
to apply for a questionnaire
asking them personal, educa
tional and employment his
tory, as well as several essay
questions on why they want to
serve on the board.
