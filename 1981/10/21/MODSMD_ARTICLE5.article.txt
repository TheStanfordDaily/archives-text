# Hoover research fellowships offered to young scholars
## 
### Cici Oremland 
Younger university faculty mem
bers usually have neither the funding
nor the time to conduct research
projects free of their other academic
duties. But for the past 11 years, the
Hoover Institution has afforded
younger post-doctoral scholars from
around the country the opportunity
to participate in a special one-year
research fellowship program free of
their other teaching responsibilities.
Hoover selects between 12 to 15
scholars each year to come complete
research themes on domestic and in
ternational topics and prepare their
findings for publication. The 12 fel
lows selected for this year's National,
Peace and Public Affairs Fellow Pro
gram are here to research topics
ranging from Chinese socialism and
commerce to current domestic fi
nancial and business concerns.
Dr. Constantine Galskoy, director
of the program, said the fellowship
promotes research in a variety of pol
icy-related fields and from a variety
of academic disciplines. Previous fel
lows' backgrounds have included
law, economics, business adminis
tration, English, foreign languages
and history.
Galskoy said that primarily the
younger post-doctoral scholar or
junior faculty member is selected for
the program. The average age of the
fellows is 36 or 37.
"This is a career enhancement fel
lowship program ... we try to avoid
the very well-established, fully
tenured professor who has other op
portunities to achieve financial sup
port (for research work)," he said.
Despite Hoover's conservative ide
ological reputation, there are no ide
ological stipulations placed on the
fellows' research projects. "This is a
strictly academic program," said

Galskoy.
One Fellow, who is researching
politics and sociology in the Soviet
Union, said she felt no constraints on
her work. "My own writings are quite
in the other direction (politically
than Hoover's) ... and it is a great
compliment to Hoover to host such a
variety of people of such varying ide
ologies in such a cordial and con
genial atmosphere."
Hoover's only requirement for the
program is the completion of at least
a rough draft toward publication of
the research work by the end of the
year. Most Fellows are able to com
plete this requirement, said Galskoy.
Around 100 books and 700 articles
have been published by the pro
gram's Fellows over the past 10 years.
Galskoy said, "The program is not
for scholars to begin work on a re
search project but to allow them time
away from their teaching responsi
bilities to finish research work and
bring it into a publishable form."
Hoover provides each fellow with
an office, full access to all Hoover fa
cilities and library collections, and a
stipend. The average stipend is about
$18,000, but varies according to indi
vidual situations that include each
participant's salary, financial situ
ation if their research is conducted
during sabbatical leave, and certain
tax advantages accrued from re
search work, said Galskoy.
Stipends never match the partici
pant's regular salary because the fel
lows ar"e given no administrative or
teaching responsibilties at Hoover,
he said.
Galskoy also said the part of the
reason younger faculty members are
chosen for the program is that the
stipends offered are not sufficient to
attract a tenured professor.

politics and sociology in the Soviet
Union, said she felt no constraints on
her work. "My own writings are quite
in the other direction (politically
than Hoover's) ... and it is a great
compliment to Hoover to host such a
variety of people of such varying ide
ologies in such a cordial and con
genial atmosphere."
Hoover's only requirement for the
program is the completion of at least
a rough draft toward publication of
the research work by the end of the
year. Most Fellows are able to com
plete this requirement, said Galskoy.
Around 100 books and 700 articles
have been published by the pro
gram's Fellows over the past 10 years.
Galskoy said, "The program is not
for scholars to begin work on a re
search project but to allow them time
away from their teaching responsi
bilities to finish research work and
bring it into a publishable form."
Hoover provides each fellow with
an office, full access to all Hoover fa
cilities and library collections, and a
stipend. The average stipend is about
$18,000, but varies according to indi
vidual situations that include each
participant's salary, financial situ
ation if their research is conducted
during sabbatical leave, and certain
tax advantages accrued from re
search work, said Galskoy.
Stipends never match the partici
pant's regular salary because the fel
lows ar"e given no administrative or
teaching responsibilties at Hoover,
he said.
Galskoy also said the part of the
reason younger faculty members are
chosen for the program is that the
stipends offered are not sufficient to
attract a tenured professor.
