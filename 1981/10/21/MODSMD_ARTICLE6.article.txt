Recent work done by two
scientists, Dr. Theodore Bunch
and Dr. Sherwood Chang, of
NASA's Ames Research Center
in nearby Moffett Field, has led
to a new theory on the
formation of the solar system,
particularly the development
of certain meteoritesand
asteroids.
The Big Bang theory
contends that 20 billion years
ago, there was nothing in the
universe except a single,
intensely dense body
containing all the mass and
energy that would everexist.
This body blew up in a gigantic
Big Bang, scattering cosmic
debris across the universe.
As the debrisexpanded
outward (as it does even
today), it began consolidating,
attracted by the gravitational
field characteristic of all mass.
Within a few hundred million

years, the first generation of
stars had formed out of the
debris from the Big Bang.
The first generation of stars,
composed mostly of the
lightest element, hydrogen,
produced heavier elements by
thermonuclear fusion, the
combining of elements to form
heavier elements while giving
off tremendous amounts of
energy.
After about 15 billion years,
according to Dr VonEshleman
of the electrical engineering
department here (he is
presently working on the
Voyager missions), many of
these stars had exploded as
novas, scattering their mass
once more across the universe.
This mass, containing a much
greater array of elements than
were present at the conception
of the universe, again began
condensing to form new solar
systems, including ours.

Around five billion years
ago, our emerging solar system
was nothing but a tremendous
cloud of condensing second
generation cosmic debris. At
the center of this cloud, where
the density wasthegreatest,
arose the solar nebula, which
was heated by friction until
nuclear fusion began. In the
farther reaches of this cloud,
matter was condensing to form
planetesimals, which later
differentiated into planets,
moons, comets, asteroids, and
meteorites.
Previously, it was thought
thataspecial groupof
meteorites, called
carbonaceous chondrites
because they contain carbon,
reflected the composition of
the early planetesimals in this
solar system. However, Bunch
and Chang have shown that
these meteorites have in fact
undergo ie significant

chemical and physical changes
since they were planetesimals.
Earlier theories about the
carbonaceous chondrites
suggests that clays in them
were formed from cosmic gas
and dust, which was relatively
uniform in its composition
throughout the early solar
system. However, Bunch and
Chang have identified several
types of clays, dissimilar from
those found elsewhere in the
solar system, and all reflecting
modes of origin from the
degradation of minerals by the
leaching action of water.
The formation of clays
occured on "parent bodies,"
large formations from which
asteroids and meterorites later
broke away to assume their
present position in orbits
around the sun such as the
asteroid belt.
The parent bodies were
usually formed by the

aggregation of rocky material
and ice intosolid or semi-solid
matricies. Bunch and Chang
said they believe that this ice
was melted as the parent body
was heated, either by collisions
between the ice and minerals
in the early loose matrix or by
the radioactive decay of
aluminum 26 (an isotope of
common aluminum) of which
other researchers have found
traces. The waterthat was thus
formed produced the clays
presently found on
carbonaceous chondrites. This
process continued for
hundreds of thousands of
years, ending due to the
evaporation of water out of the
thin atmosphere or the water's
incorporation back into ice
because of cooling.
During this same period,
Bunch proposed that amino
acids found on the
carbonaceous chondrites were

also formed. These amino acids
are known as abiotic organic
molecules, because they
formed without the presence
of life. Bunch and Changalso
said they believe that there is a
good chance that water and
certain organic molecules
were actually incorporated
into the parent bodies and
planets directly from
interstellar space instead of
being formed in the
planetesimals as were most
molecules.
Eshleman added that since
the most common elements in
the universe are hydrogen,
oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen,
in that order, and that each
formscompounds, in order,
are water (H2O), methane
(CH4), and ammonia (NH3).
These facts suggest the
similarity of all solar systems in
their chemical composition,
and thus their possibility of

sustaining life.
Bunch cautioned, though,
that "there is a lot of carbon in
the solar system," and that its
presence does not
automatically indicate
excellent chance of there
being life. He said he is
doubtful that there isany life in
this solar system outside of
Earth, "except for maybe
Titan,"a moon of Jupiter.
NASA is presently organizing
a workshop for experts to
discuss the life of carbon from
its production in so-called
"carbon stars," to its
incorporation intothesolar
system, and finally to its
passage through the human
body.
Bunch and Chang are now
expanding their research to the
study of interplanetary dust
collected by NASA U-2 aircraft
atthe upperlimitsofthe
earth's atmosphere.
