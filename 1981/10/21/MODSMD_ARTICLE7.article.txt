# Physician questions possibility of 'winning' nuclear war
## 
### Paul Timmins 
Though some members of President
Ronald Reagan's cabinet feel the United
States can "win" a nuclear war, many of the
country's physicians are not so optimistic.
Dr. Peter Joseph, president of the San Fran
cisco Bay A.rea chapter of Physicians for So
cial Responsibility, spoke on the medical
consequences of nuclear war last Friday. The
lecture was sponsored by the San Andreas
Health Council in Palo Alto.
According to Joseph, the threat of nuclear
war warrants special concern from people in
the Palo Alto area. Two facilities nearby,
Moffett Field and Lockheed, seem likely
targets in the event of nuclear attack. A nu
clear explosion at either one of these sites
would probably level the entire Palo Alto
area, he said.
Joseph began his slide show with an ex
planation of the workings of a nuclear bomb.
He referred to nuclear explosions as "small
suns" in which energy and matter are
created and destroyed. The overall ex
plosion is the result of three phases; the first
phase, fission, produces the high tem
perature and pressure necessary for the sec
ond phase, fusion. These particles then col
lide with a uranium shell resulting in an addi
tional fission phase, Joseph explained.
In 1938 German scientists accomplished
the first fission of hydrogen atoms, he said. In
1942 the first controlled chain reaction took

place in the United States. The first bomb
detonated over Hiroshima on August 6,1945
killed 70,000 immediately; three days later
the bomb at Nagasaki killed 40,000.
After more than three decades of testing
and development, today's nuclear warheads
are much more sophisticated, and lethal,
than either of these — Joseph said the
Hiroshima bomb was only a "firecracker"
compared to today's more advanced nuclear
weapons.
People should be aware of the companies
involved in the production of nuclear weap
ons, Joseph said. Exxon, Gulf, Rockwell,
Monsanto, Allied Chemical, and Union
Carbide were several of the names on
Joseph's list of corporations taking part in
nuclear weapons production.
Joseph explained that damage done by a
nuclear bomb results from three major ef
fects of the explosion — blast, thermal, and
radiation. The blast from a nuclear explosion
would wipe out buildings for miles. The in
tense heat generated would char skin up to
seven miles away; second degree burns
would occur up to 10 miles away.
Things bursting into flames up to 10 miles
away create the possibility of a huge "fire
storm" which, according to Joseph, can in
crease the lethal effect of the explosion by a
factor of five. The radiation produced would
be 1000 times greater than that contained in
a nuclear power plant.

Severe burns represent the most over
whelming medical problem. The care of
burns requires incredibly sophisticated, ex
pensive, and time consuming treatment. In
the event of a nuclear war, facilities and per
sonel for the care of burn patients would be
drastically lacking, he said.
A nuclear blast digs a giant crater into the
earth and dust particles are sucked up into
the sky. Radioactive material adhering to the
dust creates a phenomenon know as "radi
oactive fallout."
Joseph compared this effect to the ex
plosion of Mt. St. Helens last year, which
spread ashes across most of the United
States. The presence of radioactive fallout
practically precludes the possibility of re
building after a nuclear war. Joseph added
that if the Soviet Union is forced to target all
of the MX missiles silos, the entire United
States will certainly be covered by radio
active fallout.
Plutonium, one of the most toxic sub
stances known, is an important element in
nuclear reactions. Plutonium localizes in
the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and
gonads. The ions enter the body and
transfer their energy to the tissue, chang
ing chemical bonds. The amount of in
tensive care needed for treatment of
cerebral, gastrointestinal, and
hematopoietic disorders arising from ex
posure to radiation simply won't be avail

able.
In addition to the immediate illnesses
caused by radiation, a nuclear war would
produce an estimated 10,000 non-lethal ge
netic mutations.
"The effect of irradiating human genetic
human material," said Joseph, "would be
felt for generations to come." Emphasizing
the serious consequences of radiation, he
added, "When you play around with the
genes, you're fooling around with the es
sence of what we are."
The nuclear radiation would also damage
the ozone layer of the atmosphere, which
blocks dangerous ultra-violet rays from the
sun. Without this protection, the earth's
ecosystem would collapse; crops would fail
and animals would go blind, he said.
Joseph also mentioned the rather obscure
effect radiation would have on the insect
population. Capable of withstanding greater
amounts of radiation, and no longer under
human control, insects would "multiply like
crazy," spreading plagues across the coun
try.

With regard to the long term effects,
Joseph admitted we really don't know what
they all will be. In fact, he said the unknowns
we face probably equal what we do know;
"We're on the edge of a precipice and we
don't know how deep it goes."
In conclusion, Joseph emphasized the im

portance of the public's awareness of the
horrifying effects of nuclear war. With this
grim realization, Joseph said he hopes that
people will begin to challenge the momen
tum of the arms race that has been building
up in the past years.
Physicians for Social Responsibility is a na
tional organization dedicated to public
education on the medical consequences of
nuclear war. One of the major obstacles in
hibiting this goal, says Joseph, is people's re
luctance to examine such an unpleasant sub
ject as nuclear war. "Most people don't
think about it, and they don't know,"he
said.
In the discussion that followed a slide
show, Joseph spoke of the modern concept
of "mutual assured destruction" (MAD).
With the incredible accuracy of the new mis
siles, nuclear powers now have the capability
to destroy their enemies' weapons. Knowing
that your enemy can render you powerless,
Joseph reasoned that "the pressure to
launch a first strike will be enormous."
Also mentioned in the discussion was the
nuclear weapons freeze proposal. This pro
posal calls for an agreement between all nu
clear powers to halt all production and tes
ting of nuclear weapons. Several groups in
California are presently trying to get this pro
posal on the state ballot.

California are presently trying to get this pro
posal on the state ballot.
Though some members of President
Ronald Reagan's cabinet feel the United
States can "win" a nuclear war, many of the
country's physicians are not so optimistic.
Dr. Peter Joseph, president of the San Fran
cisco Bay A.rea chapter of Physicians for So
cial Responsibility, spoke on the medical
consequences of nuclear war last Friday. The
lecture was sponsored by the San Andreas
Health Council in Palo Alto.
According to Joseph, the threat of nuclear
war warrants special concern from people in
the Palo Alto area. Two facilities nearby,
Moffett Field and Lockheed, seem likely
targets in the event of nuclear attack. A nu
clear explosion at either one of these sites
would probably level the entire Palo Alto
area, he said.
Joseph began his slide show with an ex
planation of the workings of a nuclear bomb.
He referred to nuclear explosions as "small
suns" in which energy and matter are
created and destroyed. The overall ex
plosion is the result of three phases; the first
phase, fission, produces the high tem
perature and pressure necessary for the sec
ond phase, fusion. These particles then col
lide with a uranium shell resulting in an addi
tional fission phase, Joseph explained.
In 1938 German scientists accomplished
the first fission of hydrogen atoms, he said. In
1942 the first controlled chain reaction took

place in the United States. The first bomb
detonated over Hiroshima on August 6,1945
killed 70,000 immediately; three days later
the bomb at Nagasaki killed 40,000.
After more than three decades of testing
and development, today's nuclear warheads
are much more sophisticated, and lethal,
than either of these — Joseph said the
Hiroshima bomb was only a "firecracker"
compared to today's more advanced nuclear
weapons.
People should be aware of the companies
involved in the production of nuclear weap
ons, Joseph said. Exxon, Gulf, Rockwell,
Monsanto, Allied Chemical, and Union
Carbide were several of the names on
Joseph's list of corporations taking part in
nuclear weapons production.
Joseph explained that damage done by a
nuclear bomb results from three major ef
fects of the explosion — blast, thermal, and
radiation. The blast from a nuclear explosion
would wipe out buildings for miles. The in
tense heat generated would char skin up to
seven miles away; second degree burns
would occur up to 10 miles away.
Things bursting into flames up to 10 miles
away create the possibility of a huge "fire
storm" which, according to Joseph, can in
crease the lethal effect of the explosion by a
factor of five. The radiation produced would
be 1000 times greater than that contained in
a nuclear power plant.

Severe burns represent the most over
whelming medical problem. The care of
burns requires incredibly sophisticated, ex
pensive, and time consuming treatment. In
the event of a nuclear war, facilities and per
sonel for the care of burn patients would be
drastically lacking, he said.
A nuclear blast digs a giant crater into the
earth and dust particles are sucked up into
the sky. Radioactive material adhering to the
dust creates a phenomenon know as "radi
oactive fallout."
Joseph compared this effect to the ex
plosion of Mt. St. Helens last year, which
spread ashes across most of the United
States. The presence of radioactive fallout
practically precludes the possibility of re
building after a nuclear war. Joseph added
that if the Soviet Union is forced to target all
of the MX missiles silos, the entire United
States will certainly be covered by radio
active fallout.
Plutonium, one of the most toxic sub
stances known, is an important element in
nuclear reactions. Plutonium localizes in
the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and
gonads. The ions enter the body and
transfer their energy to the tissue, chang
ing chemical bonds. The amount of in
tensive care needed for treatment of
cerebral, gastrointestinal, and
hematopoietic disorders arising from ex
posure to radiation simply won't be avail

able.
In addition to the immediate illnesses
caused by radiation, a nuclear war would
produce an estimated 10,000 non-lethal ge
netic mutations.
"The effect of irradiating human genetic
human material," said Joseph, "would be
felt for generations to come." Emphasizing
the serious consequences of radiation, he
added, "When you play around with the
genes, you're fooling around with the es
sence of what we are."
The nuclear radiation would also damage
the ozone layer of the atmosphere, which
blocks dangerous ultra-violet rays from the
sun. Without this protection, the earth's
ecosystem would collapse; crops would fail
and animals would go blind, he said.
Joseph also mentioned the rather obscure
effect radiation would have on the insect
population. Capable of withstanding greater
amounts of radiation, and no longer under
human control, insects would "multiply like
crazy," spreading plagues across the coun
try.

With regard to the long term effects,
Joseph admitted we really don't know what
they all will be. In fact, he said the unknowns
we face probably equal what we do know;
"We're on the edge of a precipice and we
don't know how deep it goes."
In conclusion, Joseph emphasized the im

portance of the public's awareness of the
horrifying effects of nuclear war. With this
grim realization, Joseph said he hopes that
people will begin to challenge the momen
tum of the arms race that has been building
up in the past years.
Physicians for Social Responsibility is a na
tional organization dedicated to public
education on the medical consequences of
nuclear war. One of the major obstacles in
hibiting this goal, says Joseph, is people's re
luctance to examine such an unpleasant sub
ject as nuclear war. "Most people don't
think about it, and they don't know,"he
said.
In the discussion that followed a slide
show, Joseph spoke of the modern concept
of "mutual assured destruction" (MAD).
With the incredible accuracy of the new mis
siles, nuclear powers now have the capability
to destroy their enemies' weapons. Knowing
that your enemy can render you powerless,
Joseph reasoned that "the pressure to
launch a first strike will be enormous."
Also mentioned in the discussion was the
nuclear weapons freeze proposal. This pro
posal calls for an agreement between all nu
clear powers to halt all production and tes
ting of nuclear weapons. Several groups in
California are presently trying to get this pro
posal on the state ballot.
