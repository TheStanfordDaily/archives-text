## Stanford brothers/ sisters adopt children 
### Susan Scheiber 
"My big brother is on the Stanford
football team!" More than 70 local
junior high school-aged children can
say they have big brothers or sisters
involved in athletics at Stanford â€”
students who volunteer their time,
through the Volunters For Youth (VFY)
program, to be a friend to youths who
are experiencing adjustment problems
athomeorinschool.
The Volunteers For Youth program is
sponsored by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) and is
funded here by the Athletic
Department and community
donations.
Stanford students are matched up,
according to mutual interests, on a one
to-one basis with junior high school
students who volunteer for the
program through theircounselors at
school. Asaresultofthiscareful
pairing, many relationships become
very close.

"I just help take the place of a good
friend," said Meg Metzgerof the
women's basketball team, whose little
sister is an eighth-grader from Palo
Alto. "She knows I'm always there
when she needs me and feels she can
call whenever she wants,"said
Metzger.
Stanford swimmer Linda Jezek also
said she feels that the program "works
very well. Kellyand I are really close."
Kelly is a 14-year-old girl from Palo Alto
who "basically just needsa friend,"said
Jezek. "She just has no one she really
feels close to at school."
Jezek takes her little sister to the
beach, bike-riding, and roller skating,
but the youngster's favorite activity is
spending the night at Jezek's house.
Though the VFY volunteersareonly
asked to spend two or three hours a
week with their little brothers and
sisters, manyspend uptofiveorsix
hours.
"My 12-year-old little brother and I

go to the Sunday Flicks and to soccer
games all the time," said Dave
Nussbaum. Nussbaum's little brother is
also a faithful fan of the Stanford
basketball team, on which Nussbaum
plays.
Volunteers are reimbursed for the
cost of the activities they enjoy with
their little siblings, although this year
there is "a shortage in the budget," said
Katy Dore, one of the seven student
directors of the VFY at Stanford.
Though reasons for joining the
program varied among the participants,
most agreed the feeling of helping
someone else was important.
"It's a good outlet for students to get
away from campus and just have a
friend," said Metzger, adding that "it's
especially good if you're considering a
career in counseling."
Nussbaum confessed thatthe
program gives him an excuse to pursue
activities he "couldn't get away with

except with a little kid along," citing the
Malibu Grand Prix as an example.
Though enjoyable, participating in
the VFY program is also a serious
commitment. "You have to be
dedicated," said Nussbaum. "A lot of
the kids come from split families. My
little brother has no father, and if I just
did the program for a couple of weeks
and then disappeared, it would hurt
him more than help." For this reason,
the youngsters keep the same big
brother or sister until the older siblings
graduate from Stanford.
Founded at Stanford in 1969 by Dr.
Stan Fischman, a child psychiatrist here,
the VFY was originally called simply the
Youth Program. In 1975, when the
program started expanding to other
NCAA member institutions, the name
was changed, and the NCAA promised
to sponsor the program nationwide and
to provide a national staff in 1977. This
year, the VFY will include 44 universities
and colleges.
