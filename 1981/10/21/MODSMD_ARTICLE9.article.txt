# Lectures focus on academic dancing

What has four arms, four
legs, a bow and strings, and can
be found making unusual
sounds and spontaneous
movements? A modern
dancer, an accompanist and
her cello performing im
provisational music and dance.
Last Thursday evening in
Tresidder Lounge, Elizabeth
Sischka and Gwendolyn
Watson led a lecture-demon
stration on "Interpretive Im
agination and Dance," the first
in a three-part STARTS lecture
series focusing on "Dance for
the Academic."
According to Cory Foster,
the creator/organizer of the
series, its goal is to "bring up
some of the intellectual ques
tions surrounding dance" and
to reach out to the academic
community.
Sishcka, a master's candidate
in dance education here, gave
a brief lecture describing the
"meanings" of modern dance
and improvisation, and their
evolution from a rebellious
movement against classical
ba\let (pioneered by Isadora
Duncan) into an ongoing at
tempt to break down the bar
riers between performers and
their audience.
The rapport that developed
between Sischka, Watson and
the small group of 15 audience
members, seemed to illustrate
her point quite well.
Watson, resident accom
panist for the Stanford dance
department, spoke about im
provisation as "a form of ex
pression for everyone ... in all
aspects of one's life," while Sis
chka explained the way im
provisation allows for "greater
freedom of action . . . often the
body speaks clearly what the
tongue refuses to utter."
The "demonstration" part of
the evening began when Sis
chka began an improvisation
based on an image she had
chosen for herself, while
Watson followed her with mu
sic she felt would "enhance
what we were seeing." The en
tire "duet" was unrehearsed.
The two then reversed roles
— Watson chose an image and
began to play, while Sischka
complemented the music with
movement. The audience was
encouraged to comment
and/or ask questions at the end

of each of the improvisations.
The pair explored various
approaches to improvisation
using an assortment of stimuli,
including verbal cues (sugges
tions from the audience), visual
cues (Sischka did a short piece
representing the "curiosity" of
her observers in the audience),
and poetry.
A handful of dancers in the
audience joined Sischka in a
few of the improvisations, mul
tiplying the possibilities for
movement. Each piece was al-

allows for greater
freedom of
action...often the
body speaks
clearly what the
tongue refuses to
utter'

lowed to "self destruct," that is,
to end as spontaneously as it
had begun. The last improvisa
tion of the evening invited ev
eryone in the audience to ac
tively participate with sound
and/or movement.
Watson led a "vocal warm
up," distributed a few per
cussive instruments, and en
couraged others to clap hands,
tap feet, etc. Everyone in the
group became involved —
humming, clapping, beating
on chairs — not only the dan
cers, but others who had come
for other reasons, such as an
engineer who explained he
was "tired of engineering."
There will be two more
Thursday evening programs in
the series. This coming Thurs
day, the lecture-demonstra
tion will be led by Fran Spector,
an instructor at the Pacific
Dance Center in Palo Alto. Her
program will be a class-like
evening with a focus on relaxa
tion techniques.
The third evening will fea
ture the Dionysian Duncan
Dancers, a San Francisco group
whose work is based on the
choreography of Isadora Dun
can.
