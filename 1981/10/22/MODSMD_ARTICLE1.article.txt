# Report cites potential earthquake hazards

A study which took place here last
year has helped to determine pro
cedures and rescue efforts in the
event of a major earthquake, accord
ing to James Gere, who headed the
Committee on Earthquake Prepared
ness.
The committee's report concluded
that "there is at least a 30 percent
probability" of an earthquake meas
uring up to 8.3 on the Richter scale
within the coming decade. Accord
ing to the report, the last local earth
quake of comparable magnitude was
the San Francisco earthquake df 1906,
which measured approximately 8.2.
"The duration of strong ground
shaking at the campus probably
would be in the range of 20 to 60 sec
onds for earthquakes such as these,
with attendant potential for great
damage to many structures and in
stallations," stated the report.
"Whether the next major earthquake
is generated on the nearby San An
dreas fault or on one of its branches
across the bay, the Stanford com
munity will be faced by its sternest
physical challenge since that April
morning in 1906.
"The price to be paid will depend
heavily upon how that challenge is
met," predicted the report.
According to Marvin Herrington,
Director of the Police Department,
Stanford's first earthquake drill, held
last April 21, helped a great deal in
preparing campus personnel for the
challenge of a real disaster.
"We wanted to see what kind of
problems to expect," said Her
rington. "We needed to get an idea
of how long it would take to search a
good size residence hall or academic
building. Roble was chosen as the
residence hall and Terman as the aca
demic building."
Herrington worked out a scenario
of events, such as blocked roads,
fires, arid other obstacles the rescue
personnel might have to encounter.
Campus workers were not aware of
these problems before the drill, said
Herrington.
"One hundred and twenty or so in
juries were simulated â€” the Medical
Center made them look real," said
Herrington.
According to Herrington, several
problems were uncovered. "One of
our main objectives was transport.
We wanted to see how long it would
take for Plant Services to bring the
rescue vehicles," he said.
"We ended up with a traffic jam.
We discovered that we needed to
train our people to get volunteers to
direct traffic and that we needed an
order of how to get in and out of a
given area," he said.
The drill tried to avoid "really ideal
conditions" according to Her
rington. "For realism, I assigned only
one officer to the scene. He really
had his hands full."
Another possible problem could

be overcrowding at the Medical Cen
ter, according to Herrington. "The
least hurt, because they are the most
mobile, will get to the hospital first
and could really inundate the place,"
he said.
Another major part of the exercise
was the assembly of the policy com
mittee "The policy committee would
be composed of President Kennedy,
the vice-president, and other of
ficials, and one of their jobs would be
to give guidance to the police," said
Herrington. "For example, if we did
not have enough resources to at
tended to all the problems, they
would decide which we should at
tend to first," he said.
Gere, from the Blume Earthquake
Center, who headed the committee,
said a program of renovation has sig
nificant strengthened much of the
Quad.
"The History Corner, for example,
has been upgraded, and the front
wall of Quad is being renovated now,
"said Gere.
Another hazard during an earth
quake could be the red tile roofs
found on most Stanford buildings.
"It is expected that many tiles will
become detatched during a strong
earthquake and drop to the ground,
which reinforces the familiar warn
ing that it is not advisable for a person
to run out of a building during an
earthquake," according to the Earth
quake Preparedness report. "Any
one standing outside but close to a
