# China wants decision on US arms sales to Taiwan

### Los Angeles Times 
Shanghai, China — Chinese Premier Zhao
Ziyang is expected to press President Ronald
Reagan hard to declare his administration's poli
cy on arms sales to Taiwan when the two leaders
meet at the North-South summit conference in
Cancun, Mexico, which opens today.
Both China and the United States are ready to
deepen their relationship substantially once the
Taiwan issue is put behind them, according to
Chinese diplomatic sources.
But Reagan is likely to defer his answer at least
until Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua visits
Washington two weeks later, reflecting the ad
ministration's continued ambivalence toward
relations with Peking and Taipei.
Zaho left Peking Tuesday for Mexico with
Huang and other Chinese officials. The two-day
summit conference of leaders of industrialized
and developing nations in the Mexican resort
town will be accompanied by extensive bilateral
meetings, including that of Reagan and Zhao at
the end of this week.
May deny closer U.S. ties
Anticipating a noncommittal answer from
Reagan on the sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan,
which has emerged as the crucial question in
Sino-American relations, Peking seems ready to
back away and deny the Reagan administration
the closer strategic cooperation it wants with
China as a further bulwark against the expansion
of the Soviet Union's global influence.
"Both sides really do want to break new
ground," said a close diplomatic observer of
Sino-American relations. "But Peking wants to
make sure that it hasn't cut the ground out from
under itself in doing so."
This deferral would not immediately imperil
relations between Washington and Peking — al
though the Soviet Union has proposed to the
Chinese leadership that they resume nego
tiations to settle bilateral differences — but it
would leave future development uncertain.
However, diplomats believe that both Peking
and Washington would eventually have to re
consider their "alliance of interests" if there
were no progress.

Reagan has been advised by American special
ists on China that the United States is now ap
proaching a critical juncture in its relationship
with Peking. The specialists have said that a ma
jor breakthrough can be made now to increase
mutual trust, securing the strategic partnership
and cementing it with the sale of American arms
and technology.
But the Taiwan lobby, which has great in
fluence among Reagan's political confidantes, is
working hard for a U.S. commitment to supply
the Chinese Nationalists with a new type of war
plane and other advanced weapons, both to
maintain the island's military strength and tosig
nal continued American political support for the
nationalists.
Taiwan wants U.S. arms
Northrop Corp., the leading contender to
manufacture the advanced fighter Taiwan
wants, is lobbying hard for sale of the new war
planes as soon as possible and is reportedly find
ing allies within the White House who contend
that China would not sever relations over such a
sale.
State department specialists, however, say
such a sale could undercut the leadership of
Deng Xiaoping, the powerful Communist Party
vice chairman who negotiated the estab
lishment of Sino-American relatons three years
ago.
Reagan so far has deferred the whole ques
tion, and diplomats in Peking believe he will try
to do so again when he meets Zhao.
The Chinese premier is prepared to put Pe
king's case even more forcefully than Foreign
Minister Huang Hua did to Secretary of State
Alexander Haig at a preliminary Cancun meet
ing in August.
Zhao apparently is willing to take a non-an
swer, diplomatic sources say, but Huang is ready
to press for a decision in negotiations in Wash
ington.
If Peking is not satisfied then, Sino-American
relations will likely be kept on the present
plateau despite the Reagan administration's de
sire to sell China substantial amounts of weap
ons and military technology.
