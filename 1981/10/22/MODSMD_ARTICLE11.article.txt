## Talking about the art of speaking 
### Adam Berns 
Would you believe Stanford offers a
class where the final exam is given in a local
restaurant, where extra-credit involves
speaking on a street corner in San
Francisco, and where you'll learn about
such diverse subjects as how to build a
nuclear bomb, fear of failure, competitive
sun-tanning, and how to defend yourself
against a football player?
The class is Practical Speech
Communication, undergraduate special
16A, taught by Jim Wagstaffe, who initiated
the class in 1976 as a third-year senior at
Stanford and has taught it ten times since
then.

'Davidian once pre
tended he was a tour
guide in the Cannery. He
started pointing out gar
bage cans and telling
people how these cans
were an example of func
tional art. You know how
people are when it
comes to tours — ev
erybody wants to join in.
Before long, Davidian
had given tours of gar
bage cans to over 125
people. People were
even snapping pictures
of the cansV

Currently a law clerk for a federal district
judge in San Francisco, Wagstaffe placed
third in the nation in original oratory in
high school, and placed first in the nation
in persuasive speaking as an
undergraduate at Stanford. He also placed
first in the western region in moot court
whileenrolled in Hastings Law School.
He is aided in teaching by Ben Davidian,
a friend from Hastings Law School, and
himself an accomplished speaker.
The three hour class meets on Tuesday
nights and is a combination of
performance and theory. Half of the class
period is spent on speech theory, and the
other half is spent giving speeches.
Wagstaffe focuses the first few classes on
teaching students how to give short,
impromptu speeches based on personal
experience. These lead up to giving longer
expository and persuasuve speeches
towards the end of the quarter. The final
exam consists of a speech given before a

large audience.
Creativity is a key element in the course.
Despite the class' relaxed atmosphere,
students are encouraged to work hard.
Not only does Wagstaffe give a large
amount of personal attention to each of his
students but he encourages them to get to
know one another and offer each other
constructive criticism.
Wagstaffe estimated he'd heard over
1200 in-class speeches in the course of
teaching the class. Topics include
speeches on streaking, the history of the
bra, a lengthy lesson on the origins of the
toilet, and even a persuasive speech done
on the evils of bongs where the speaker
gave the entire speech as Mr. Rogers.
Wagstaffe once even heard an impromptu
speech done entirely in Spanish.
"The first time my class was being
evaluated, a student of mine gave a speech
on how to forge a driver's license."
Wagstaffe explained. "There I was with a
University evaluator sitting in the back of
the class, watching a student tell the class
how to do something illegal. Luckily the
evaluator took it all in good stride... and
oh yes, everyone under 21 left class that
night with an Illinois driver's license,"
Wagstaffe said.
"Another experience I'll never forget is
when a student was giving a speech on
how to makeflyingringsoutof paper.
Near the end of the speech, after everyone
had successfully finished making their
rings, the speaker told everyone to take
their rings outside and showed them how
to make their rings fly. There I was outside
the library, with a bunch of students flying
rings/'
For extra credit in the class, students may
take part in a trip to San Francisco, where
they give speeches on the street in order to
get practice speaking before a varied
audience.
Wagstaffe recalled one of the more
humorous incidents he's had in San
Francisco: "Davidian once pretended he
was a tour guide in the Cannery. He started
pointing out garbage cans and telling
people how these cans were an example of
functional art. You know how people are
when it comes to tours — everybody wants
to join in. Before long, Davidian had given
tours of garbage cans to over 125 people.
People were even snapping pictures of the
cans!"
For most students, the highlight of the
class is the end of the quarter banquet or
final exam, held in a local restaurant.
Students are encouraged to invite friends
and family members, and each is asked to
give a 'special occasion' speech at the
dinner. Two class members serve as the
master and mistress of ceremonies while
the other five give speeches ranging from
informal toasts to instructors' roasts.
Wagstaffe takes all that is said at the
banquet in good stride. "People who do
the roasts almost always call my mother or
one of my brothers," Wagstaffe explained.
"They find out things about me and use
things in their speeches that I wouldn't
even want my fiance to know."
Wagstaffe said that some dinner

speeches caught him off guard. "I
remember the time that somebody did a
speech on streaking," Wagstaffe laughed
"This guy actually stripped to his
undershorts during the speech!"
Besides Wagstaffe and Davidian, the
banquet usually featuresa special guest
speaker. Special guests have ranged from
appellate court justice Robert Kane, to
ex-49er quarterback and Stanford
graduate John Brodie.
"Brodie was really funny," mused
Wagstaffe. "He was sitting by the podium
and when anybody came uptospeak, he

used to steal their notes. He was a strong
believer in speaking without notes. I really
felt sorry for those people who didn't
memorize their speeches."
Wagstaffe emphasized the importance
of being able to speak in front of people, as
he feels speech has been an area sorely
neglected by the University. "At the time t
started teaching the class there were no
other speech courses being taught on
campus," says Wagstaffe. "Today, there
still aren't any besides one small class in the
engineering department. It's absurd that at
a great university like this, something as
important as speech should be so sadly
neglected.
Though Wagstaffe is not paid for
teaching this class, he admits that he gets
great personal satisfaction watching a
student who was tremblingthe first week
of class become a poised and eloquent
speaker by the end of the quarter.

remember the time that somebody did a
speech on streaking," Wagstaffe laughed
"This guy actually stripped to his
undershorts during the speech!"
Besides Wagstaffe and Davidian, the
banquet usually featuresa special guest
speaker. Special guests have ranged from
appellate court justice Robert Kane, to
ex-49er quarterback and Stanford
graduate John Brodie.
"Brodie was really funny," mused
Wagstaffe. "He was sitting by the podium

used to steal their notes. He was a strong
believer in speaking without notes. I really
felt sorry for those people who didn't
memorize their speeches."
Wagstaffe emphasized the importance
of being able to speak in front of people, as
he feels speech has been an area sorely
neglected by the University. "At the time t
started teaching the class there were no
other speech courses being taught on
campus," says Wagstaffe. "Today, there
still aren't any besides one small class in the
engineering department. It's absurd that at
a great university like this, something as
important as speech should be so sadly
neglected.
Though Wagstaffe is not paid for
teaching this class, he admits that he gets
great personal satisfaction watching a
student who was tremblingthe first week
of class become a poised and eloquent
speaker by the end of the quarter.
Would you believe Stanford offers a
class where the final exam is given in a local
restaurant, where extra-credit involves
speaking on a street corner in San
Francisco, and where you'll learn about
such diverse subjects as how to build a
nuclear bomb, fear of failure, competitive
sun-tanning, and how to defend yourself
against a football player?
The class is Practical Speech
Communication, undergraduate special
16A, taught by Jim Wagstaffe, who initiated
the class in 1976 as a third-year senior at
Stanford and has taught it ten times since
then.

Currently a law clerk for a federal district
judge in San Francisco, Wagstaffe placed
third in the nation in original oratory in
high school, and placed first in the nation
in persuasive speaking as an
undergraduate at Stanford. He also placed
first in the western region in moot court
whileenrolled in Hastings Law School.
He is aided in teaching by Ben Davidian,
a friend from Hastings Law School, and
himself an accomplished speaker.
The three hour class meets on Tuesday
nights and is a combination of
performance and theory. Half of the class
period is spent on speech theory, and the
other half is spent giving speeches.
Wagstaffe focuses the first few classes on
teaching students how to give short,
impromptu speeches based on personal
experience. These lead up to giving longer
expository and persuasuve speeches
towards the end of the quarter. The final
exam consists of a speech given before a

large audience.
Creativity is a key element in the course.
Despite the class' relaxed atmosphere,
students are encouraged to work hard.
Not only does Wagstaffe give a large
amount of personal attention to each of his
students but he encourages them to get to
know one another and offer each other
constructive criticism.
Wagstaffe estimated he'd heard over
1200 in-class speeches in the course of
teaching the class. Topics include
speeches on streaking, the history of the
bra, a lengthy lesson on the origins of the
toilet, and even a persuasive speech done
on the evils of bongs where the speaker
gave the entire speech as Mr. Rogers.
Wagstaffe once even heard an impromptu
speech done entirely in Spanish.
"The first time my class was being
evaluated, a student of mine gave a speech
on how to forge a driver's license."
Wagstaffe explained. "There I was with a

the class, watching a student tell the class
how to do something illegal. Luckily the
evaluator took it all in good stride... and

Wagstaffe said.
"Another experience I'll never forget is
when a student was giving a speech on
how to makeflyingringsoutof paper.
Near the end of the speech, after everyone
had successfully finished making their
rings, the speaker told everyone to take
their rings outside and showed them how
to make their rings fly. There I was outside
the library, with a bunch of students flying
rings/'
For extra credit in the class, students may
take part in a trip to San Francisco, where
they give speeches on the street in order to
get practice speaking before a varied
audience.
Wagstaffe recalled one of the more
humorous incidents he's had in San
Francisco: "Davidian once pretended he
was a tour guide in the Cannery. He started
pointing out garbage cans and telling
people how these cans were an example of
functional art. You know how people are
when it comes to tours — everybody wants
to join in. Before long, Davidian had given
tours of garbage cans to over 125 people.
People were even snapping pictures of the
cans!"
For most students, the highlight of the
class is the end of the quarter banquet or
final exam, held in a local restaurant.
Students are encouraged to invite friends
and family members, and each is asked to
give a 'special occasion' speech at the
dinner. Two class members serve as the
master and mistress of ceremonies while
the other five give speeches ranging from
informal toasts to instructors' roasts.
Wagstaffe takes all that is said at the
banquet in good stride. "People who do
the roasts almost always call my mother or
one of my brothers," Wagstaffe explained.
"They find out things about me and use
things in their speeches that I wouldn't
even want my fiance to know."

Wagstaffe said.
"Another experience I'll never forget is
when a student was giving a speech on
how to makeflyingringsoutof paper.
Near the end of the speech, after everyone
had successfully finished making their
rings, the speaker told everyone to take
their rings outside and showed them how
to make their rings fly. There I was outside
the library, with a bunch of students flying
rings/'
For extra credit in the class, students may
take part in a trip to San Francisco, where
they give speeches on the street in order to
get practice speaking before a varied
audience.
Wagstaffe recalled one of the more
humorous incidents he's had in San
Francisco: "Davidian once pretended he
was a tour guide in the Cannery. He started
pointing out garbage cans and telling
people how these cans were an example of
functional art. You know how people are
when it comes to tours — everybody wants
to join in. Before long, Davidian had given
tours of garbage cans to over 125 people.
People were even snapping pictures of the
cans!"
For most students, the highlight of the
class is the end of the quarter banquet or
final exam, held in a local restaurant.
Students are encouraged to invite friends
and family members, and each is asked to
give a 'special occasion' speech at the
dinner. Two class members serve as the
master and mistress of ceremonies while
the other five give speeches ranging from
informal toasts to instructors' roasts.
Wagstaffe takes all that is said at the
banquet in good stride. "People who do
the roasts almost always call my mother or
one of my brothers," Wagstaffe explained.
"They find out things about me and use
things in their speeches that I wouldn't
even want my fiance to know."
Wagstaffe said that some dinner

speeches caught him off guard. "I
remember the time that somebody did a
speech on streaking," Wagstaffe laughed
"This guy actually stripped to his
undershorts during the speech!"
Besides Wagstaffe and Davidian, the
banquet usually featuresa special guest
speaker. Special guests have ranged from
appellate court justice Robert Kane, to
ex-49er quarterback and Stanford
graduate John Brodie.
"Brodie was really funny," mused
Wagstaffe. "He was sitting by the podium
and when anybody came uptospeak, he

The first time my class
was being evaluated, a
student of mine gave a
speech on how to forge a
driver's license. There I
was with a University
evaluator sitting in the
back of the class,
watching a student tell
the class how to do
something illegal. Luckily
the evaluator took it all in
good stride...and oh yes,

used to steal their notes. He was a strong
believer in speaking without notes. I really
felt sorry for those people who didn't
memorize their speeches."
Wagstaffe emphasized the importance
of being able to speak in front of people, as
he feels speech has been an area sorely
neglected by the University. "At the time t
started teaching the class there were no
other speech courses being taught on
campus," says Wagstaffe. "Today, there
still aren't any besides one small class in the
engineering department. It's absurd that at
a great university like this, something as
important as speech should be so sadly
neglected.
Though Wagstaffe is not paid for
teaching this class, he admits that he gets
great personal satisfaction watching a
student who was tremblingthe first week
of class become a poised and eloquent
speaker by the end of the quarter.
