## 
### Michael Weiss 
You're tired of dorm food. People tell you
about all the great restaurants in Palo Alto
and San Francisco, but you lack a car. It's 5
p.m. and you cannot imagine another night
of Stern delight. . .
Do not despair! There are several fun, ex

on campus. Here is a guide to some of the
more intriguing eating opportunities that ex
ist at the University.
Union Crossroads
Union Crossroads features plants, large
windows, and a selection of basic cafeteria
foods along with some more specialized

everyone from President Donald Kennedy to
John Elway to the cute girl in your history sec
tion.
Union Crossroads is open from 7 a.m. to 10
p.m. Monday through Friday and serves
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On weekends it
is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and offers break

cheesecake to croissants to rum balls.
Marcel's is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on

Madera-Okada cafeteria in Wilbur Hall, and

tables and video machines sit in the back.

weekdays. On Monday, the pub opens from 5

The abundance of plants, dim lights, and
dark wooden-colored tables make the Cof
fee House seem like a typical college hang
out.
Open from 10 a.m. to midnight Monday
through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Friday,
and 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. on the weekend, the

The menu features several different kinds
of pizza: mushroom, salami, ham and other

style and are smaller than American pizzas —
each is actually meant for one person, al
though they can be shared.
Prices for these items range from $1.90 to
$3.50, or 1900 to 3500 lira, as the menu reads.
Before or after your meal, you can enjoy mu
