# Peace Corps help Third World nations to help themselves
## 
### Jane McConnell 
In a village in Nepal, there is a river
spanned by an ancient suspension bridge.
The only way for the children of the village to
get back and forth from school is across this
narrow, rickety bridge, and parents often
keep their children home because of the
danger involved in the crossing. As a result,
the quality of education in the village suffers.
When a Peace Corps volunteer spent sev
eral months in the village directing the con
struction of a safer bridge the situation
changed. Projects like this, which help the
people of Third World nations help them
selves, are what the Peace Corps is all about.
College students are the primary source of
Peace Corps applicants, according to Re
cruitment Specialist Bernice Nelson. Stan
ford ranks third in Northern California col
lege campuses, behind UC-Berkeley and
UC-Santa Cruz, in recruitment applicants.
A recruiting team from San Francisco
spent three days at Stanford last week sign
ing up volunters for the service. The team
was also at the recent Job Faire and will be

returning to the campus Dec. 7-9, Jan. 11-13,
and April 12-15.
"We have been very successful in recruit
ing at Stanford in the past," said Nelson. "We
had to have been successful here to be re
turning five times this year."
Forty applicants were recruited at the Job
Faire, and Nelson expects a total of about 150
for the entire year.
This year marks the twentieth anniversary
of the Peace Corps, and in the course of
these yearsn more than 80,000 Americans
have served in over 60 countries. More than
a million lives are directly affected by the
Peace Corps every day.
Volunteers are usually college seniors and
graduate students, though anyone over 18 is
eligible to apply. "We have to say 18 years of
age or older for legal reasons," said Nelson.
"But most people do not have the ex
perience or maturity to be volunteers until
they are 21."
Majors in science, math, home econom
ics, education, and health fields are fre
quently requested as volunteers, though.

Nelson said a college degree is not necessary
for the job. Skills in carpentry, forestry, auto
mechanics, and plumbing are also in high
demand.
The application procedure begins with an
eight-page application form, which can be
picked up in the Career Planning and Place
ment Center. The application can be re
turned to the recruiting team during a cam
pus visit, or sent to Corps offices in San Fran
cisco. Upon receipt of the application, an in
terview is scheduled.
Before the interview, the applicant's skills
are matched with a job. For example, skill in
biology would enable a volunteer to teach
science, work in a fishery, or become in
volved in forestry, health programs, or com
munity services. During the interview, the
applicant is told what he or she is qualified
for, and is able to choose from among the
job possibilities.
After the interview, applicants are re
quired to give fingerprints, background and
passport information and undergo a physical
examination. At this time the applicant's
folder is sent to a placement bureau in Wash

ington, D.C. where it is screened. About half
of those who apply are accepted, and volun
teers are notified of their acceptance one to
six months prior to leaving for their assign
ment.
"We can tell how committed an individual
is just by his filling out all the forms," said
Nelson. Basically, the Peace Corps looks for
healthy, qualified volunteers with motiva
tion and a willingness to help others.
"We don't want people who are just in it
for a vacation. They often do not realize how
difficult the service is until the interview,
when we describe the actual rigors of the
job, and many people end up reconsider
ing," he said.
Once accepted into the program, a volun
teer undergoes three months of training in
the language, culture, and technology of the
country he will travel to. He will spend 24
months there, and receive a living allowance
of about $300 a month for food, housing, es
sentials, and spending money. In addition,
volunteers are given $125 for each month
served, at the end of the two years as a read

justment allowance.
Volunteers work directly with local vil
lagers. Their jobs include anything from
helping Filipino fishermen improve their
catches to developing disease-resistant veg
etables in West Samoa.
"We are especially interested in people
who can teach, on the village level, in the
fields of renewable energy and appropriate
technology — and that means almost anyone
who is good at working with his or her
hands," said Nelson. Jobs in these fields in
clude building windmills to pump water, im
proving the efficiency of making charcoal,
and developing simple solar devices.
According to Nelson, the benefits of the
program are limitless. "You get a chance to
travel, learn about another culture and lan
guage, and it doesn't look too bad on a re
sume, either."
Volunteers also cite personal and job ex
perience as benefits. "It wasn't so much the
idealistic, 'save-the-world' thing for me — it
was more for my personal satisfaction," said
one volunteer.
