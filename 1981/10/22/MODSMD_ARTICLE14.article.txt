## Alec Rawls Set nuclear contingency plan 
### 
No doubts that the facts of nuclear war provide the
element for a mutually effective deterrent to nuclear at
tack by either the U.S. or the USSR. But those elements
are at present not arranged in nearly the most effective
way to provide such deterrence. If the Soviets launched,
along with a nuclear first strike against our military capac
ity, an ultimatum that we not retaliate or be totally ob
literated, it is not at all certain that President Jimmy
Carter would not have bowed to the ultimatum. Presi
dent Ronald Reagan certainly would not.
The deterrent to nuclear war need not and should not
be subject to such vagaries. What is lacking is a publi
cized, clearly delineated, and ineluctable contingency
plan for nuclear war which insures that no first strike
could possibly be in the Soviets' interest. (A U.S. first
strike is already effectively deterred by the clear per
ception that the Soviets would make a devastating re
sponse.)
r urther, a contingency plan should insure that no sub
sequent scaling up of nuclear exchange could be in the
Soviets' interest. Such a plan would provide the best de
ter rence, and the best hope of extrication in the event of
nuclear embroilment. We can have enough warheads to
blow up the world a thousand times, and soon enough
probably will. Deterrence depends only on what the So
viets believe we will do with them.
I his fact has a great deal to do with the deployment of
the MX missile system, and our approach to nuclear de
fense up until now. Reagan has decided to deploy the
MX missiles in existing silos, along with a plan to upgrade
other aspects of our nuclear defense system. Senator
Tower spearheaded opposition to this plan on the
grounds that it would cut dangerously into the ability of
our land-based retaliatory forces to weather a Soviet first
strike.
There are two possible reasons for maintaining first
strike survivability of our land-based retaliatory forces,
112 irst is that we might want to try to weather a Soviet first
stiike should there be one, in the hopes of keeping our
options open. But what scenario could be more inviting
to the Soviets? Clearly this posture does not contribute
to effective deterrence.
I am sympathetic, of course, to the urgent desire of
anyone involved in determining the course of a nuclear
war to spare civilization from further destruction. But
bending over backwards to keep options like this open
as long as possible merely invite Russian opportunists to
tempt fate. Anyone who is calmed by Soviet assui ances is
urged to review the frightening Soviet duplicity in a situ
ation as dangerous as the Cuban missile crisis.
A second reason for wanting to maintain first strike
survivability might be that launching missiles upon veri
fication of a Soviet attack in progress is not plausible and
any retaliation, presumes survivability. Reagan's plan
calls for extensive upgrading of communications
networks. One effect would be to make retaliation upon
verification more plausible. Further, submarine based
missile systems are, for the forseeable future, in
vulnerable to Soviet pre-emptive attack. They currently

lack hard target capacity, but such capacity would be re
quired for few things other than hitting Soviet missiles in
their silos, which would not only occur in a U.S. pre
emptive strike, which presumably would never take
place.
First strike survivability of land-based retaliatory forces
thus seems an unnecessary goal, especially if we are to
attempt retaliation upon verification, and it is actually
detrimental to deterrence if it is perceived as stemming
from a desire to weather a first strike. Since it is non-es
sential, it would be a mistake to make survivability of our
land-based retaliatory forces the centerpiece of our de
fense system a, such Survivability is much less certain
than other aspects of nuclear war.
Moving away from survivability on the one hand sig
nals our intention to retaliate, since it abandons the pos
ture of keeping options open. Also, it makes attempted
retaliation upon verification clearly in our interest, even
after deterrence is moot, as the way to come out of a nu
clear first exchange best able still to affect Soviet actions.
Were we to retaliate to a Soviet first strike, both upon
verification with our land-based missiles if possible, and
with our submarine-based missiles, the Soviets would
undoubtedly regret having attacked. The thing to do is to
provide the Soviets with a certainty that the response
would be devastating. To this end our intention to re
spond should be made clear and irrevocable by setting
up in full Soviet view an ineluctable launching sequence
over which the president has no veto power. It would be
triggered only by verification established according to
objective criteria. Contingency plans have always been
the rule, of course, but they have always lacked the
crucial quality of ineluctability. Cutting the president out
of the decision insures that the retaliation cannot be
stopped by a president who might come to the unlikely
conclusion that, if a Soviet attack was already a reality, re
taliation would not serve the country's interest. For a
president like Reagan, who would surely retaliate any
way, this assurance is redundant but harmless. For a pres
ident like Carter who might have been conciliatory, the
assurance is crucial to maintaining effective deterrence.
It is surety of retaliation that provides deterrence, and
this can easily be attained with a broad range of mixes of
survivability and ability to launch upon verification,
which are easily supported by our present breadth of
armament under an ineluctable response program.
The thing to do is emphatically not to hold our cards
close. Our cards are played best by fixing in advance and
irrevocably our response to a Soviet gambit. Once a Sovi
et attack is under way our ace can no longer be played:
the threat of retaliation can no longer deter.
Only the most pessimistic Soviets observer would have
them launching a first strike without provocation. But if
events elsewhere started occuring at a rapid pace the So
viets might regard a nuclear gambit as a way, or worse,
the only way, to gain the upper hand. The plausibility of
this option must be eliminated.
