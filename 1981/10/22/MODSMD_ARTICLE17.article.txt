## Sadat: maybe a fool; not a leader 
### 
As an Arab I was deeply insulted by
Curtis Horton's characterization of
the Egyptian people (Daily, Oct. 12)
as being "fundamentally sick" for not
"beating their chests" when Presi
dent Anwar Sadat was assassinated.
And while I want to assert that it is
Horton's right to "beat" his own
chest if he wanted to, I strongly ob
ject to his negative appraisal of the
Egyptian people and the Stanford
community. I will not start an ex
change of insults with Horton, but I
would like to point out that he is at
best grossly misinformed about
Egypt.
I would like to draw his attention to
Noorah Said's excellent assessment
of the reasons which led to Sadat's
death (Daily, Oct. 11). Said's views
certainly express the feelings of the
overwhelming majority of the Egyp
tian people about Sadat's death, but I
would like to add a few points that
are relevant to Horton's article.
Sadat was not Egypt's "greatest
modern leader" as Horton claims; he
was, however, "greatest in a different
respect: he was definitely Egypt's

greatest modern fool. He lacked vi
sion and courage although he had
plenty of fantasies and much
foolhardiness. And he successfully
exhibited these qualities during his
tenure as Egypt's president in just
about everything he did.
• For example, he severed his rela
tions with the Soviets without being
assured, beforehand, of Western al
ternative of material support. (His fa
talistic trust in America was never ac
tually rewarded: the U.S. never com
pensated his army for the arms the
Soviets used to supply with him.)
• he demolished Egypt's socialist
institutions and opened its doors to
free enterprise without ever bother
ing about the details or wisdom of
the transition. This has hurled a
shocking number of the Egyptian
people into the chains of destitute
poverty without building any re
spectable alternative capitalist in
stitutions. His economic policies only
succeeded in increasing Egypt's de
pendence on the West.
• he mocked his own motto of "no
religion in politics and no politics in

religion" by proclaiming himself
"the Faithful President" and under
mined the very "democratic" institu
tions which he had established (to go
along with his economic policies), by
banning the wearing of national
dress and by throwing his opponents
into jail.
• he never exhibited his political
naivete more than in Camp David —
where he signed an agreement that
was a landmark of stupidity and
foolhardiness. Even the rulers of
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the Gulf
Shaikhdoms, and Morocco, who are
his equals and superiors in corrup
tion and definitely more dependent,
from an objective point of view, on
Western support, were too clever to
support the Camp David Accords. At
Camp David, Sadat gave Israel the
green light to enjoy an open season
on the Palestinian people, (since
Camp David, Israel has killed more
Palestinians than it had done since
1948, thanks to Sadat's ac
quiescence), without getting much
in exchange. He sincerely wanted
peace in the Middle East, but he
lacked any realistic understanding of
what it takes to achieve it. As a result,
he ignored the Palestinians and other
Arab countries and "went it" alone.
He fatalistically believed that the U.S.
held "ninety-nine percent," as he
used to say, of the peace cards. As a
result, he put his total trust, and Egypt
as well, in the U.S. hand.
But the U.S., which did not hold 99
percent of the cards to begin with,
never gave him peace. Instead, it
used him to further its own interests
in the Middle East and Africa. He was,
thus, told to hurl Egyptian troops to
Oman, Sudan, Zaire, and Chad, and
American military bases were built in
Egypt. Camp David did not give him
peace. Instead, it demoralized the
Egyptian people, severed Egypt from
the rest of the Arab World, increased
the violence and bloodshed in the
area (since Egypt had previously
checked Israel's actions), and put off
real peace indefinitely.
