## CIA could resume internal spying 
### 
Two weeks ago, the Reagan Ad
ministration issued a 23-page pro
posal that would permit the CIA to
resume internal spying and other
covert operations within the United
States. CIA internal activities were
stopped in the mid-'7os as a result of
the abuses uncovered by a Senate
committee investigating possible
wrongdoing. Some of these abuses
were: illegal mail opening, bugging,
wiretapping, breakins, and covert
surveillance of political groups.
The new proposal would vest the
CIA with the power to: review medi
cal, bank, and telephone records as
well as open mail without a court or
der; conduct covert actions within
the U.S., including infiltration of or
ganizations and surveillance of

citizens and absolve CIA chiefs of the
responsibility of reporting federal
crimes committed by subordinates.
When I first heard this report on
the news, I sat and listened. I did not
merely listen to the radio for news of
the proposal's enactment into law, I
listened to my fellow student and the
faculty of this school. I listened for a
cry of outrage against this violation of
our civil rights, yet I heard nothing.
Were the voices muffled, stifled by
the yoke of freedom which we so
proudly bear? I fear that these voices
could not be heard, because the
words were inadvertently lost in the
complexity of our daily lives; they
were somehow cast aside in the rush
to the bank or to class.
Seeing our collective voice so en

feebled, I feel the need to publicy ex
press my outrage, and perhaps stimu
late the social conscience within us
all to speak out, now. Can we sit by
silently as our rights are curtailed and
abrogated? Will we, like cattle,
march to the battlefields of the next
Vietnam to spill our blood in the
name of democracy?
Each day, as we sit by, non-commit
tal, shrouded in a veil of personal
concerns and apathy, we are in tacit
compliance with the dehumanizing
forces within our society. Shall we
find the cost of freedom buried in the
ground, or will our liberties wither
away as we hurry on our way, too
busy to care?
