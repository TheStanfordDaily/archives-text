## Actions measure progress of humanity 
### 
In a private little poll that I con
ducted recently, I asked a number of
people around campus whether they
thought that the human race is im
proving or deteriorating. The results
of this grand question turned out to
be rather banal — it was about 50-50,
perhaps leaning a little bit towards
improvement. One poor freshman
even exclaimed, "I just don't know
what I'll end up like in four years."
1 hough the statistical results of this
poll are somewhat less than fascinat
ing, I think that the people's attitudes
in their responses are very intriguing.
It seems that, for the most part, peo
ple feel that the course of the world is
natural and unalterable. No one sug
gested that whether the world gets
better or worse might depend on
some concerned members of the hu
man race.
Instead the tone seems to be that
we are being swept along in the
evolutionary rip-tide to "who
knows-where." The idea of evolu
tionary progress appears to have be
come a universally defined and ac
cepted metaphor for the automatic
unrolling of the path of the world.
I do not disagree with the idea that
the world is changing. I do object to
this attitude of helplessness before
the world's evolutionary flow, for to
say that progress (or regress) is in
evitable suggests no good reasons for
being socially or politically active in
the world. Rather, it gives us a reason
to be lazy. If we are bound to im
prove, we need not trouble to im
prove. In an automatic universe, the
pure doctrine of progress is no rea
son for being progressive.

If the definitions of terms like
evolution and progress seem un
clear, let's try the world "reform."
For reform implies an original form;
it implies that we are trying to shape
the world into a particular image. If
evolution is a methaphor for a me
chanical unrolling, then progress
might be a metaphor for walking
down a road. Reform, then, can be
seen as a metaphor for the process of
acting to return something which is
out of shape to its proper condition.
It would seem that in order for re
form to occur, we need a fixed image

'/ do object to this attitude of helplesness

of what the world should be like. To
make sense out of the past and the
future, we must be Sensible enough
to take what it is that we happen to
want, and to say that this is the aim 6f
evolution. Progress or advance have
no meaning unless we have to make
the whole world like that vision.
Such a vision is necessary for the
functioning of a government. In or
der to denounce or to affirm an issue,
and to expect people to act accord
ing to these judgements, a state must
point to some intrinsic "right" that
has been violated, or to a "wrong"
that must be avoided. In supporting
any authority or authoritative pre
cept as legitimte, lawmakers must as

sume some ethical standard which
the cited law or agency approaches.
This kind of fixed ideal is necessary
for the rebel as well as for the conser
vative. Rebellion is always against
some established structure, and, at its
best, revolution is also a turning
towards a desired goal. Unfortunate
ly, the modern rebel will gladly give
you a long list of what he will fight
against, but rarely will he tell you
what he will fight for.
The "question authority" notion is
becoming a very popular theme to
day. Utilizing our right to scrutinize

what was previously considered sa
cred has given us a certain amount of
power over our social and political
structures. Big government ma
neuvers no longer take place with
our blanket blessings, and we can
even make things difficult for the
University when they want to search
our rooms.
By criticizing authorities and by
doubting their claims to social sov
ereignty, we have been able to break
the bonds in which that certain cor
rupt forces in our country have kept
us. We can do this only when we have
a clear, well-thought out idea of what
is right and wrong. Such was the case
with Watergate — even the criminals

knew that they were criminals.
What seems to be happening now,
though, is that our rampant question
ing has chisled away at all established
authority structures, until all that we
are left with is ourselves. Thus we are
at a point of questioning our ex
istence.
Once we doubted the validity of
our own minds, we reach the end of
all questioning, for when we doubt
our ability to reason we doubt the
very thing that allows us to ask ques
tions and to make value judgements.
There is no more skeptical world
than one in which men ask them
selves if they have any selves. When
we doubt our existence, there is
nothing left for us to question, and
certainly nothing left for us to do.
It is time to stop looking for ques
tions and to start looking for answers.
We must decide where we want to go
and get on with it. To do this means
that we must first believe that our ra
tionality is not an illusion — that our
thoughts do indeed correspond to
reality.
From there we can consider what is
valuable, and in acting consistently
with these values, discuss where hu
manity needs to go; or more specifi
cally what we need to do. Most im
portantly, we have to be convinced
that we can have a significant impact
on the world. We must accept the
fact that our actions have conse
quences, and hence feel responsible
to live in a way that will lead us to
what we think is best for our society.

the whole world like that vision.
Such a vision is necessary for the
functioning of a government. In or
der to denounce or to affirm an issue,
and to expect people to act accord
ing to these judgements, a state must
point to some intrinsic "right" that
has been violated, or to a "wrong"
that must be avoided. In supporting
any authority or authoritative pre
cept as legitimte, lawmakers must as

sume some ethical standard which
the cited law or agency approaches.
This kind of fixed ideal is necessary
for the rebel as well as for the conser
vative. Rebellion is always against
some established structure, and, at its
best, revolution is also a turning
towards a desired goal. Unfortunate

you a long list of what he will fight
against, but rarely will he tell you
what he will fight for.
The "question authority" notion is
becoming a very popular theme to
day. Utilizing our right to scrutinize

what was previously considered sa
cred has given us a certain amount of
power over our social and political
structures. Big government ma
neuvers no longer take place with
our blanket blessings, and we can
even make things difficult for the
University when they want to search
our rooms.
By criticizing authorities and by
doubting their claims to social sov
ereignty, we have been able to break
the bonds in which that certain cor
rupt forces in our country have kept
us. We can do this only when we have
a clear, well-thought out idea of what
is right and wrong. Such was the case
with Watergate — even the criminals

knew that they were criminals.
What seems to be happening now,
though, is that our rampant question
ing has chisled away at all established
authority structures, until all that we
are left with is ourselves. Thus we are
at a point of questioning our ex
istence.
Once we doubted the validity of
our own minds, we reach the end of
all questioning, for when we doubt
our ability to reason we doubt the
very thing that allows us to ask ques
tions and to make value judgements.
There is no more skeptical world
than one in which men ask them
selves if they have any selves. When
we doubt our existence, there is
nothing left for us to question, and
certainly nothing left for us to do.
It is time to stop looking for ques
tions and to start looking for answers.
We must decide where we want to go
and get on with it. To do this means
that we must first believe that our ra
tionality is not an illusion — that our
thoughts do indeed correspond to
reality.
From there we can consider what is
valuable, and in acting consistently
with these values, discuss where hu
manity needs to go; or more specifi
cally what we need to do. Most im
portantly, we have to be convinced
that we can have a significant impact
on the world. We must accept the
fact that our actions have conse
quences, and hence feel responsible
to live in a way that will lead us to
what we think is best for our society.

In a private little poll that I con
ducted recently, I asked a number of
people around campus whether they
thought that the human race is im
proving or deteriorating. The results
of this grand question turned out to
be rather banal — it was about 50-50,
perhaps leaning a little bit towards
improvement. One poor freshman
even exclaimed, "I just don't know
what I'll end up like in four years."
1 hough the statistical results of this
poll are somewhat less than fascinat
ing, I think that the people's attitudes
in their responses are very intriguing.
It seems that, for the most part, peo
ple feel that the course of the world is
natural and unalterable. No one sug
gested that whether the world gets
better or worse might depend on
some concerned members of the hu
man race.
Instead the tone seems to be that
we are being swept along in the
evolutionary rip-tide to "who
knows-where." The idea of evolu
tionary progress appears to have be
come a universally defined and ac
cepted metaphor for the automatic
unrolling of the path of the world.
I do not disagree with the idea that
the world is changing. I do object to
this attitude of helplessness before
the world's evolutionary flow, for to
say that progress (or regress) is in
evitable suggests no good reasons for
being socially or politically active in
the world. Rather, it gives us a reason
to be lazy. If we are bound to im
prove, we need not trouble to im
prove. In an automatic universe, the
pure doctrine of progress is no rea
son for being progressive.

If the definitions of terms like
evolution and progress seem un
clear, let's try the world "reform."
For reform implies an original form;
it implies that we are trying to shape
the world into a particular image. If
evolution is a methaphor for a me
chanical unrolling, then progress
might be a metaphor for walking
down a road. Reform, then, can be
seen as a metaphor for the process of
acting to return something which is
out of shape to its proper condition.
It would seem that in order for re
form to occur, we need a fixed image

of what the world should be like. To
