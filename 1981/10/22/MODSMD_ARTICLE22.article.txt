# Getting down to brass tactics
## 
### Leon Dayan 
If you have ever wanted to create
your own work of art, study medieval
armor, learn different styles of calli
graphy, and at the same time find out if
you are of noble blood, then brass rub
bing might be the hobby for you.
Brass rubbing is the art of rubbing a
brass engraving on to paper with a
crayon-like resin, to reproduce the in
tricate detail of the original sculpture.
The process works like the traditional
lecture pastime of copying the design
on a coin by lightly rubbing a pencil
over a piece of paper held over the
coin.
The first in a series of four brass rub
bing classes taught by Walt Tunick and
sponsored by STARTS was held Mon
day, Oct. 19 in upstairs Tresidder at 7
p.m. The turnout was minimal but the
large display of brass etchings dating
back as many as 1000 years was im
pressive. Tunick ascribed the low turn
out (three people) to the fact that "most
people don't know what brass rubbing
is all about."
Simple though the process mayseem,
brass rubbing has been a key to his
torical studies of armor, calligraphy,
fashion and hairstyling. The technique
is also used by archaeologists, who can
record stone carvings on to paper with
much greater detail than by photogra

phy.
The appeal of brass rubbing lies,
however, in the ease with which some
one of minimal artistic skills can pro
duce a beautiful, decorative work of art
to give a dorm room, for example, an ar
tistic and novel touch.
Brass rubbing is extremely popular
among the thousands of tourists who
flock to Westminster Abbey each year
to see and rub the largest collection of
brass plates in the world. 8000 of the
9000 existing brasses are in England, and
of the 1000 that are not, 200 are in
Tunick's Brass Rubbing Studio in Palo
Alto, making his collection one of the
largest outside of England and the only
one of its kind in the Bay Area.
Tunick will be back again on Mon
day, Oct. 26 at 7 p.m. to what he hopes
will be a bigger crowd. The two hour
sessions cost $5, which is less than one
third of the price at Tunick's studio. The
fee covers all the materials and all the
rubbings you can make in addition to
some lessons on the use and history of
An added attraction to the hobby of
brass rubbing is that you may find clues
to your geneology. Tunick said, "I've
come across a number of people
who've found out that these knights or
other people on the brasses are actually
their ancestors."

A LESSON IN BRASS RUBBINGâ€”
The first in a series of four lessons in
brass rubbing began last Mondav
