## Prosaic 'Richard ll' lacks poetry 
### Jonathan Treitel 
There's a moment in the fourth act of
Richard 11, when the king has all but been
deposed by Bolingbroke, the futuie Henry
IV. . .and suddenly the stagf is a garden,
and two gardeners saunter in, musing on
horticulture. The older one speaks:
I will go root away
The poisonous weed which without
profit sucks
The soil's fertility from wholesome
flowers. . .
Whereupon the younger one strikes up
the Grand Metaphor:
. . .Our sea-walled garden, the whole
land
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers
choked up. . .
And we, sitting in the Geary Theater,
lean forward in our seats, for the Queen
has emerged from the dark i ,*sses of the
stage, and the gardeners will explain to her
the defeat of her husband.
And indeed it was with just such a dra
matic irony that the play began. First the
stage was dim, occupied only by a heavy
wooden platform, riddled with ladders
and steps like one of those impossible con
traptions in an Escher print.
Then the entire cast of the American
Conservatory Theatre production sprang
on and around the platform, and they
barked in turn the background history of
the fall of the House of Plantagenet.

The story's like this. Richard's father and
grandfather, Edward 111 and Edward the
Black Prince, were mighty warriors who
died when Richard was ten. The boy-king
began his reign okay under the tutelage of
John of Gaunt.
But as Richard grew older he became
fickle, annoyed his relatives, and
murdered one of them, the Duke of
Gloucester.
At which point Shakespeare took an in
terest, and wrote plays covering the next
150 years, from Richard II through to Rich
ard 111. . .
Cut. The royal court at Windsor Castle.
Cut. John of Gaunt's mansion.
And so the play progressed, cutting
crisply from one conflict to the next, until
the final, literal "cut" when Richard was
knifed to death and Bolingbroke grabbed
his crown.
Indeed this was no atmospheric produc
tion. The lighting was flat and rapid, almost
Brechtian. The scenes shifted smartly with
never a slow fade-out or a brooding si
lence.
As for the costumes (designed by Robert
Morgan), they were a sort of token courtly
dress, simplified like Star Trek costumes —
and each faction had its own color, so the
play was a succession of heraldic tableaux:
red fighting green, or blue against purple
— and Richard himself was yellow as "the
sun of York"; until that final scene.

Richard, played by J6hn Noah Her/ler, is
blustering, impetuous, wordy as Hamlet —
fiery when he should be magisterial, inef
fectual when he should be warlike. "Not a
bad man, just a bad king."
Whereas Bolingbroke (Lawrence Hecht)
is efficient, business-like, a "new man" of
the Renaissance. Not a king, but a dictator.
The minor characters acted as an en
semble, rather than playing "cameo
roles." john of Gaunt (William Paterson)
was suitably vehement in his death-bed
scene; and the choleric Duke of Norfolk
(Bruce Williams) raged and ranted with
gusto.
This clear-cut ensemble production has
its advantages. The intricate plot is un
ravelled with clarity. It's seldom boring, at
least in the first three acts.
But when Richard declares, "Not all the
water in the rough rude sea/Can wash the
balm off from an anointed king," it's just
not credible: for this Richard isn't majestic,
he isn't a commanding presence; and
when he's vanquished, imprisoned, and
pondering his fate, there is no lyricism of
tragedy, for this Richard isn't a poet or
philosopher.
If you're studying Shakespeare, or if
you're just interested in seeing one of his
convoluted plays rendered com
prehensible, this is a fine production to at
tend. But if you're seeking poetry and maj
esty, you won't find it here.

Whereas Bolingbroke (Lawrence Hecht)
is efficient, business-like, a "new man" of
the Renaissance. Not a king, but a dictator.
The minor characters acted as an en
semble, rather than playing "cameo
roles." john of Gaunt (William Paterson)
was suitably vehement in his death-bed
scene; and the choleric Duke of Norfolk
(Bruce Williams) raged and ranted with
gusto.
This clear-cut ensemble production has
its advantages. The intricate plot is un
ravelled with clarity. It's seldom boring, at
least in the first three acts.
But when Richard declares, "Not all the
water in the rough rude sea/Can wash the
balm off from an anointed king," it's just
not credible: for this Richard isn't majestic,
he isn't a commanding presence; and
when he's vanquished, imprisoned, and
pondering his fate, there is no lyricism of
tragedy, for this Richard isn't a poet or
philosopher.
If you're studying Shakespeare, or if
you're just interested in seeing one of his
convoluted plays rendered com
prehensible, this is a fine production to at
tend. But if you're seeking poetry and maj
esty, you won't find it here.

There's a moment in the fourth act of
Richard 11, when the king has all but been
deposed by Bolingbroke, the futuie Henry
IV. . .and suddenly the stagf is a garden,
and two gardeners saunter in, musing on
horticulture. The older one speaks:
I will go root away
The poisonous weed which without
profit sucks
The soil's fertility from wholesome
flowers. . .
Whereupon the younger one strikes up
the Grand Metaphor:
. . .Our sea-walled garden, the whole
land
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers
choked up. . .
And we, sitting in the Geary Theater,
lean forward in our seats, for the Queen
has emerged from the dark i ,*sses of the
stage, and the gardeners will explain to her
the defeat of her husband.
And indeed it was with just such a dra
matic irony that the play began. First the
stage was dim, occupied only by a heavy
wooden platform, riddled with ladders
and steps like one of those impossible con
traptions in an Escher print.
Then the entire cast of the American
Conservatory Theatre production sprang
on and around the platform, and they
barked in turn the background history of
the fall of the House of Plantagenet.

The story's like this. Richard's father and
grandfather, Edward 111 and Edward the
Black Prince, were mighty warriors who
died when Richard was ten. The boy-king
began his reign okay under the tutelage of
John of Gaunt.
But as Richard grew older he became
fickle, annoyed his relatives, and
murdered one of them, the Duke of
Gloucester.
At which point Shakespeare took an in
terest, and wrote plays covering the next
150 years, from Richard II through to Rich
ard 111. . .
Cut. The royal court at Windsor Castle.
Cut. John of Gaunt's mansion.
And so the play progressed, cutting
crisply from one conflict to the next, until
the final, literal "cut" when Richard was
knifed to death and Bolingbroke grabbed
his crown.
Indeed this was no atmospheric produc
tion. The lighting was flat and rapid, almost
Brechtian. The scenes shifted smartly with
never a slow fade-out or a brooding si
lence.
As for the costumes (designed by Robert
Morgan), they were a sort of token courtly
dress, simplified like Star Trek costumes —
and each faction had its own color, so the
play was a succession of heraldic tableaux:
red fighting green, or blue against purple
— and Richard himself was yellow as "the
sun of York"; until that final scene.

Richard, played by J6hn Noah Her/ler, is
blustering, impetuous, wordy as Hamlet —
fiery when he should be magisterial, inef
fectual when he should be warlike. "Not a
bad man, just a bad king."
Whereas Bolingbroke (Lawrence Hecht)
is efficient, business-like, a "new man" of
the Renaissance. Not a king, but a dictator.
The minor characters acted as an en
semble, rather than playing "cameo
roles." john of Gaunt (William Paterson)
