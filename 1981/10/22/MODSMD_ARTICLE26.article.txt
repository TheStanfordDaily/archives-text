# The 						ACT season opens
## 'Mama' timelier than you'd think 
### Fred Cheever 
I first read I Remember Mama in the
eighth grade, or thereabouts. The ex
perience didn't change my life. In fact, I
barely remembered it. Last Tuesday night,
when I walked into the theater to see the
opening of the American Conservatory
Theatre's I Remember Mama, I received
my program as usual. Upon opening mine
I discovered that the I Remember Mama
section included a recipe for "Mama's
meatballs." Suddenly, I remembered how
much I disliked the play. But, as it turned
out, I Remember Mama had more to offer
than meatballs.
It's not that I don't like to cook. I do
(though I often do better without a reci
pe). I have no quarrel with domesticity.
Domestic life is an important sphere, all
too often overlooked by the chroniclers of
our society. However, domestic comedy
doesn't set well with me (too many
episodes of My Three Sons during my

formative years). I Remember Mama is vin
tage domestic comedy
There is another element in I Remember
Mama I have trouble with: ethnic comedy.
In the early 1970'5, when masses of Ameri
cans finally became aware of the existence
of ethnic minorities, television produced a
new product to cater to this new social
awareness — you guessed it — the ethnic
situation comedy. It was a novel idea and
for years a great success. What many of the
devotees of TV ethnic sitcoms did not re
alize was that it was not a new form. The
same sort of thing had emerged in Ameri
can theater before. Looking back over our
theatrical history, two titles jump to mind.
The first is Life With Father, a comedy of
the rich, a minority which ha;, been with us
since the very beginning. The second is I
Remember Mama.
I Remember Mama is a play about Nor
wegians in San Francisco. Almost ev
erybody in it has a quaint accent, and all

the major characters over the age of 15
spend a good deal of time reminiscing
about the old country and what it was like
back there ven they vere yoong.
What, you ask, is my problem? What do I
have against these two perfectly respect
able types of comedy? Why have I spent
the bulK of this review identifying them
and attributing them to I Remember
Mama?
My problem with this type of comedy is
that it tiivializes things. Sometimes, very
important things. First, it trivializes the
ethnic experience by editing out the pain,
privation, prejudice, and frustration it en
tailed. These things are not funny. Second,
it trivializes domestic life by editing out
personalities until they fit perfectly into
the traditional Mama, Papa, Brother, Sis
ter, and Baby stereotypes that society and
the play assign them.

ACT production of I Remember Mama.
From this point of view the worst thing
about I Remember Mama is that it is very
good. It is a well-constructed play, sympa
thetically and convincingly put on by
ACT's impeccable company. For a minute,
near the end, you believe it all, every last
bit of it. You believe, for that instant, that
you know something new and nice about
the world. But that's a lie.
ACT has done a little bit to undermine
the seductive quality of its own produc
tion. All external authority figures in the
play are portrayed by black actors, an
absolute impossibility in the world in
which the play is supposed to have taken
place or in the world in which it was first
performed. It is an ironic touch.
So why did ACT, a responsible and im
portant theater company, produce I Re
member Mama? In a roundabout way I
think I have answered this question. I Re
member Mama, the play I disliked in
eighth grade, now inspires complex senti
ments, profound and conflicting. It is a
play that left me thinking, which is the last
thing I thought it would do.
