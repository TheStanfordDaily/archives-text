# 'Stuck' is too distanced
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Stuck by Adele Edling Shank,
subtitled "A Freeway Com
edy," is the third in her series of
"hyper-real" comedies. It
opened Wednesday at the
Magic Theatre in San Francis
co, where Winterplay (the sec
ond play in the series) was pre
miered a year ago. The first
play, Sunset/Sunrise, was first
performed in Louisville in 1980.
The term "hyper-real" is the
author's own, and derives from
the genre of hyper-realist pain
ting. By cluttering her plays
with great amounts of realistic
detail, she is attempting to dis
tance the audience, to make
the audience into voyeurs, so
that they can see themselves
more clearly through the char
acters on stage. Together with
her husband Theodore Shank
(who directed this produc
tion), Shank spent many hours
in financial-district bars listen
ing in on conversations in or
der to get dialogue material.
The action of Stuck ("inac
tion" may be a better word)
takes place during two traffic
jams — Act I is Spring AM, Act
II is Autumn PM — and centers
around two carpools of em
ployees at some large financial
district corporation. While

waiting for the snarls to clear,
the occupants of the two cars
set up small picnics and ex
change office gossip. Other
random drivers (two Italian
tourists, a woman who sells
doughnuts on roller-skates)
complete the cast.
The central characters in this
play measure their lives princi
pally in terms of their office ro
mances. Margaret (Victoria
Emory) is sleeping her way up
through the corporation. Rich
ard (John Lion), somewhat
bored with his 20-year mar
riage, is entranced by
Margaret. Jenny (Francine
Lembi) is attempting celibacy,
without much success. David
(Kenneth Kurtenbach) and
Carol (Sherry Steffens) are hav
ing a surreptitious affair.
Shank hopes to distance the
audience by emphasizing sur
face detail. To some extent she
is successful, since little detail is
told of the personal lives of the
characters. Certain details,
though, cannot help but trig

ger memories and fantasies in
the audience, much the way a
song can bring to mind old
friends. I found myself invo'un
tarily attracted to Jenny and
Richard — because of their
looks and mannerisms, not so
much because of what they
said — and began to view the
play with them as protagonists,
even though they are no more
central than a number of other
characters.
Shank's flat writing style also
creates strong ironic effects.
Richard, with his numbered
"Rules for Living," hints at a
complex past full of disillusion
ing experiences. Against the
general background of trivia,
such comments startle us be
cause of their lack of emphasis.
This technique has been used
more deliberately by such writ
ers as Camus and Handke for
just this reason.
Shank is able to mimic the
speech patterns of the charac
ters she portrays. However,
there is not much indication
that she understands the lan
guage they are speaking. It
seems that she has little sympa
thy for the people she is de
scribing: they are shallow and
uninterested in anything but
their current bed-partners. It is
as if she had gone to France and
concluded that the people
there are stupid because they
do not speak English. Office
gossip may appear frivolous,
but it can be a safe,
metaphorical way of dealing

with more complex emotional
problems.
Oddly enough, the night af
ter I saw Stuck, I went to see
Weekend by Jean Luc Godard.
It has much the same central
image (traffic jams and car acci
dents) and also one of the same
goals (distancing the au
dience). Godard, instead of
trying to be extremely realistic,
uses absurdity to prevent the
audience from identifying with
his characters.
There is some use of absurdi

ty by Shank. At the end of Act
11, an unknown driver in anoth
er car suddenly dies, presum
ably of a heart attack. This tech
nique is used sparingly, and as a
result seems artificial. Godard
uses it as a guiding principle,
and is more successful.
Because automobiles are
needed on the set for this play,
the Magic is performing Stuck
at Pier 3. This building is
cavernous and quite cool, so
patrons are advised to bring a
sweater.
