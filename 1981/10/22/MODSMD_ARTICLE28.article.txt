# LRB and ELO
## fall into the big-buck trap 
### David Schmelzer 
Call this the "Whatever happened
to. .." department. It's a disappointment
when artists who show some talent don't
follow through with their promise, either
because they make a mistake, or because
they throw away their integrity in a search
for more money, or because they just
weren't all that talented to begin with. Lit
tle River Band still may be in the first cate
gory, but E.L.O. is inescapably sucked into
one of the other two. Whatever, both
bands have current albums that are not
much more than paper-thin sellouts to the
mass market.
Oh, E.L.O. pretends to much more than
this. They call the album Time and allude
to cosmic mysteries with their cover of
spinning planets on a. wax background.
They sandwich the songs between a pro
logue and an epilogue. But then they
spend most of the album embarrassing
themselves.
Or rather, embarrassing him self, for not
even Jeff Lynne tries to conceal that the
other band members are little more than
his back-ups. From the band's beginning,
he's written, sung lead, sung back-up, and
played most of the instruments on all of
their albums. But, for a while, it looked like
he could come up with some interesting
ideas. He did with "Fire on High" — with
its almost flamenco-style acoustic guitar,
its reversed vocal tracks, and its "hallelu
jah" choruses. He did with their "Roll
Over Beethoven." But, starting with Out of
the Blue, it's seemed like he's decided to
store his brain in a bottle somewhere.
Time is his "concept" album, and he's
really hit bottom when his message is this
forgettable. Time's theme is, "What if a
man from 1981 could somehow project
himself into 2095? I bet he'd be pretty lone

ly." Deep, isn't it? Essentially all this con
cept provides is a slightly differentform for
an album filled with songs about how
much a guy misses his baby. The execution
of this limp theme is rarely very good, and
is sometimes so terrible that it's difficult to
hold back a chuckle.
The first of these moments comes right
at the start as Lynne uses a voicebox-as
computer gimmick that's been done many
times before, and which usually succeeds
in ruining the song. It never had that
chance with this one.
At least Time Exposure doesn't claim any
heavy meaning. Not surprisingly, though,
this is its problem.
The dilemma that Little River Band faced
after its First Under the Wire album was
whereto go from there. The world was fall
ing for new wave and they didn't know
how much longer their meandering pop
style could get an audience, so they
bought themselves a year to think about it
by putting out a (rather good) live album.
The decision they finally reached wasn't a
good one. They hired George Martin, the
former Beatles producer, to take control,
and what he did with them is predictable
from his background. He tightened up
their style, cut their long instrumentals, cut
down their studio time, and brought in a
bass player.
He also screwed up their music.
Under Martin's direction, Little River
Band has not only lost their distinctive jam
ming, they seem to have lost a lot of their
talent. Is this the Graham Goble who wrote
"It's a Long Way There," "Reminiscing,"
and who co-wrote "Fall From Paradise,"
who is now writing lines like, "Take it easy
on me/It should be easy to see/I'm getting
lost in the crowd/Hear me crying out
loud"? Is this the same Beeb Birtles who

also co-wrote "Fall From Paradise" and
who wrote "Broke Again" who's singing,
"Dance on ballerina, dance the night
away/Romance on ballerina, give yourself
today"? Glenn Shorrock, who did "Help is
on It's Way," among other songs, even
wrote a spaceship song that uses E.L.O.'s
insipid voicebox gimmick. Their new
member, Wayne Nelson, doesn't add any
thing apparent, since the group doesn't
emphasize bass anyway, and since his one
vocal, on "The Night Owls," just sounds
like he's doing a Glenn Shorrock im
pression.
Time Exposure is pretty much a collec
tion of bouncy four-minute tunes, so per
haps it's not surprising that its most in
teresting song only takes a minute and a
half. The problem is that "Full Circle" is
one song that should have been four
minutes. This "a capella" number is cut off
just as the instruments begin to become
prevalent. An intricate violin solo could
have made this song terrific, but, as it is, it's
just a vehicle for their strong harmonies.
Little River Band may not yet be as far
gone as E.L.O. They still have some
strengths, foremost among them being
Shorrock. His cutting voice and mature
style save "Man on Your Mind" and
"Don't Let the Needle Win" from joining
the scrapheap of songs like "Hold on
Tight." Goble and Birtles also still show oc
casional songwriting talent, the former
with "Full Circle" and the latter with "Sui
cide Boulevard." Now if they'd all just try
to be something more than just com
mercial on their next album. . .
But they won't, because they've done
what they set out to do. Both Time Ex
posure and Time are selling well, so we're
certain to see more of the same. And that's
sad.

member, Wayne Nelson, doesn't add any
thing apparent, since the group doesn't
emphasize bass anyway, and since his one
vocal, on "The Night Owls," just sounds
like he's doing a Glenn Shorrock im
pression.
Time Exposure is pretty much a collec
tion of bouncy four-minute tunes, so per
haps it's not surprising that its most in
teresting song only takes a minute and a
half. The problem is that "Full Circle" is
one song that should have been four
minutes. This "a capella" number is cut off
just as the instruments begin to become
prevalent. An intricate violin solo could
have made this song terrific, but, as it is, it's
just a vehicle for their strong harmonies.
Little River Band may not yet be as far
gone as E.L.O. They still have some
strengths, foremost among them being
Shorrock. His cutting voice and mature
style save "Man on Your Mind" and
"Don't Let the Needle Win" from joining
the scrapheap of songs like "Hold on
Tight." Goble and Birtles also still show oc
casional songwriting talent, the former
with "Full Circle" and the latter with "Sui
cide Boulevard." Now if they'd all just try
to be something more than just com
mercial on their next album. . .
But they won't, because they've done
what they set out to do. Both Time Ex
posure and Time are selling well, so we're
certain to see more of the same. And that's
sad.


Call this the "Whatever happened
to. .." department. It's a disappointment
when artists who show some talent don't
follow through with their promise, either
because they make a mistake, or because
they throw away their integrity in a search
for more money, or because they just
weren't all that talented to begin with. Lit
tle River Band still may be in the first cate
gory, but E.L.O. is inescapably sucked into
one of the other two. Whatever, both
bands have current albums that are not
much more than paper-thin sellouts to the
mass market.
Oh, E.L.O. pretends to much more than
this. They call the album Time and allude
to cosmic mysteries with their cover of
spinning planets on a. wax background.
They sandwich the songs between a pro
logue and an epilogue. But then they
spend most of the album embarrassing
themselves.
Or rather, embarrassing him self, for not
even Jeff Lynne tries to conceal that the
other band members are little more than
his back-ups. From the band's beginning,
he's written, sung lead, sung back-up, and
played most of the instruments on all of
their albums. But, for a while, it looked like
he could come up with some interesting
ideas. He did with "Fire on High" — with
its almost flamenco-style acoustic guitar,
its reversed vocal tracks, and its "hallelu
jah" choruses. He did with their "Roll
Over Beethoven." But, starting with Out of
the Blue, it's seemed like he's decided to
store his brain in a bottle somewhere.
Time is his "concept" album, and he's
really hit bottom when his message is this
forgettable. Time's theme is, "What if a
man from 1981 could somehow project
himself into 2095? I bet he'd be pretty lone

ly." Deep, isn't it? Essentially all this con
cept provides is a slightly differentform for
an album filled with songs about how
much a guy misses his baby. The execution
of this limp theme is rarely very good, and
is sometimes so terrible that it's difficult to
hold back a chuckle.
The first of these moments comes right
at the start as Lynne uses a voicebox-as
computer gimmick that's been done many
times before, and which usually succeeds
in ruining the song. It never had that
chance with this one.
At least Time Exposure doesn't claim any
heavy meaning. Not surprisingly, though,
this is its problem.
The dilemma that Little River Band faced
after its First Under the Wire album was
whereto go from there. The world was fall
ing for new wave and they didn't know
how much longer their meandering pop
style could get an audience, so they
bought themselves a year to think about it
by putting out a (rather good) live album.
The decision they finally reached wasn't a
good one. They hired George Martin, the
former Beatles producer, to take control,
and what he did with them is predictable
from his background. He tightened up
their style, cut their long instrumentals, cut
down their studio time, and brought in a
bass player.
He also screwed up their music.
Under Martin's direction, Little River
Band has not only lost their distinctive jam
ming, they seem to have lost a lot of their
talent. Is this the Graham Goble who wrote
"It's a Long Way There," "Reminiscing,"
and who co-wrote "Fall From Paradise,"
who is now writing lines like, "Take it easy
on me/It should be easy to see/I'm getting
lost in the crowd/Hear me crying out
loud"? Is this the same Beeb Birtles who

also co-wrote "Fall From Paradise" and
who wrote "Broke Again" who's singing,
"Dance on ballerina, dance the night
away/Romance on ballerina, give yourself
today"? Glenn Shorrock, who did "Help is
on It's Way," among other songs, even
wrote a spaceship song that uses E.L.O.'s
insipid voicebox gimmick. Their new
member, Wayne Nelson, doesn't add any
thing apparent, since the group doesn't
