In both his introductory notes and the
opening speech of The Glass Menagerie,
Tennesee Williams speaks of his play as a
memory. It is, of course, autobiographical,
butitisa memory of something else as well. It
is a remembrance of a time, the romantic pe
riod of the late '30s when the Depression was
ending and the war in Europe hadn't yet be
come an issue in most American's minds. To
say that this was a romantic time doesn't imp
ly that Williams's vision is a happy one. The
background for The Glass Menagerie is three
years when the author, like Tom in the play,
worked in a shoe factory and supported his
mother and sister (three years that he would
later deduct from his age as unproductive,
wasted time). The technique the author uses
to convey this memory is difficult to translate
into staging. When first produced in 1944,
Menagerie was considered a step away from
the theater of the day, i.e., realism, and a
triumph of "plastic theater," utilizing time
shifts, unreal dialogue, pantomime, and ex
pressionistic settings. The San Jose Repertory
Company's current production is true to the
image of the original concept, but lacks
depth, making for an uneven, if at times mag
netic, evening.
San Jose Repertory has recently, and for
tunately, been made home by a number of
actors formerly of the California Actors'
Theatre. Tom Ramirez is one of the very good
actors who has made this transition. As Tom,
the narrator and protagonist of The Glass
Menagerie, Ramirez delivers a strong, consis
tent performance. Although his age is a detri
ment to the portrayal of young Tom, Ramirez
shines in his guise as the narrator. His mono
logues, spoken as a merchant marine far re
moved from the action of the play (Tom of
another time), are filled with a brittle sense of
irony. Ramirez turns this irony into the
sarcasm with which Tom hides his true feel
ings. A technical actor par excellence,
Ramirez on occasion seems to be an actor in
love with his own voice, rather than having a
poet's passion for words, but the audience
will gladly sit back and listen to him speak.
The role of Amanda, Tom's mother, is an in
tricate weaving of gentility and emotional
strength. Her characterization is the pivotal
one in the play and, as such, is a very heavy
responsibility for the actor who portrays her.
Kandis Chappell, also formerly of CAT, does
her best to fulfill the requirements of this de
manding role. Her energy and stage presence
are commendable. Unfortunately, in creating
the subtleties of Amanda, Chappell often falls
short. In her dealings with the Gentleman
Caller and, most poignantly, Amanda's mon
ologue concerning the jonquils and the
beaux of her youth, Chappell is as charming a
Southern lady as has ever graced a Gov
ernor's Ball. Yet, the audience never sees the
stronger side of Amanda, a woman who has
raised her children alone and is aware of
Tom's wanderlust, which she accepts as an
unpleasant fact of life. In his character de

scription, Williams says, "There is much to ad
mire in Amanda, and as much to love and pity
as there is to laugh at." Chappell's Amanda is
played almost totally to be laughed at. Her
shrillness seems borrowed from Carol
Burnett's classic satires on Williams.
The play's last two characters, Laura and
Jim, her gentleman caller, act as catalysts in
the play. It is their contradictory natures, and
the outcome of their meeting, that pre
cipitates Laura's final withdrawal from reality.
Eventually, the audience is left to gather, it is
this withdrawal and the guilt it brings that
spurs Tom to leave. Just as Laura's shyness is
placed opposite Jim's gregarious humor, so
are the acting styles of Kathleen Amorose and
Charles Martinet contrasted. Amorose has
made a few good choices in her character
ization and she acts upon them well. How
ever, her decisions are usually tenuous. Rath
er than risking a bad portrayal, she never
seems to commit herself to a consistent line.
In this respect, Laura's discomfort in reality
becomes Amorose's awkwardness onstage.
One expects her to break character and, as if
in a rehearsal, ask to try her lines a second
time.
As for Jim, The Gentlemen Caller, Tom re
fers to him as "the long-delayed, but always
expected something that we live for."
Charles Martinet's Jim is exactly that. Not
only does his visit bring a ray of hope into
Laura's life, he lights up the last act of the play
as well. Martinet's Jim, a faded high-school
hero with an irresistible streak of optimism, is
a study of the man who lives life with his
heart. There is a silly/sweet pathos in this Jim
that picks up not only the audience, but the
actors as well. Jim's confusion when he unex
pectedly kisses Laura, sparks one of
Amorose's most compelling moments.
Of course, all successes and failures cannot
be laid entirely at the actor's feet. The overall
design of the play is ultimately director J. D.
Trow's. Ms. Trow has attempted an unusual
interpretation of The Glass Menagerie. With
the exception of Martinet, she has used her
actors only in a simplistic sense. The broad
characterizations and zany, almost "mug
ging," humor that surround even the most
explosive moments don't seem to be con
gruent with the script. Seldom does Trow al
low the cast to work on particulars of their
characters. This is indeed a shame, for they all
show abilities beyond their overall per
formance levels. Clearly, Trow has studied
the script, for at times the production
achieves the poetic. Still, throughout the bulk
of the show, Trow ignores the fragility of the
play's lyric qualities. Time and again, she has
let her actors break a moment by reciting
their lines as if they were biblical decrees,
when in restraint one could more clearly see
the artistry of the full creative process. Trow
should be applauded for her courage in stat
ing The Class Menagerie in more sweeping
terms than are usually employed, but in this
case the experiment failed.

actors who has made this transition. As Tom,
the narrator and protagonist of The Glass
Menagerie, Ramirez delivers a strong, consis
tent performance. Although his age is a detri
ment to the portrayal of young Tom, Ramirez
shines in his guise as the narrator. His mono
logues, spoken as a merchant marine far re
moved from the action of the play (Tom of
another time), are filled with a brittle sense of
irony. Ramirez turns this irony into the
sarcasm with which Tom hides his true feel
ings. A technical actor par excellence,
Ramirez on occasion seems to be an actor in
love with his own voice, rather than having a
poet's passion for words, but the audience
will gladly sit back and listen to him speak.
The role of Amanda, Tom's mother, is an in
tricate weaving of gentility and emotional
strength. Her characterization is the pivotal
one in the play and, as such, is a very heavy
responsibility for the actor who portrays her.
Kandis Chappell, also formerly of CAT, does
her best to fulfill the requirements of this de
manding role. Her energy and stage presence
are commendable. Unfortunately, in creating
the subtleties of Amanda, Chappell often falls
short. In her dealings with the Gentleman
Caller and, most poignantly, Amanda's mon
ologue concerning the jonquils and the
beaux of her youth, Chappell is as charming a
Southern lady as has ever graced a Gov
ernor's Ball. Yet, the audience never sees the
stronger side of Amanda, a woman who has
raised her children alone and is aware of
Tom's wanderlust, which she accepts as an
unpleasant fact of life. In his character de

scription, Williams says, "There is much to ad
mire in Amanda, and as much to love and pity
as there is to laugh at." Chappell's Amanda is
played almost totally to be laughed at. Her
shrillness seems borrowed from Carol
Burnett's classic satires on Williams.
The play's last two characters, Laura and
Jim, her gentleman caller, act as catalysts in
the play. It is their contradictory natures, and
the outcome of their meeting, that pre
cipitates Laura's final withdrawal from reality.
Eventually, the audience is left to gather, it is
this withdrawal and the guilt it brings that
spurs Tom to leave. Just as Laura's shyness is
placed opposite Jim's gregarious humor, so
are the acting styles of Kathleen Amorose and
Charles Martinet contrasted. Amorose has
made a few good choices in her character
ization and she acts upon them well. How
ever, her decisions are usually tenuous. Rath
er than risking a bad portrayal, she never
seems to commit herself to a consistent line.
In this respect, Laura's discomfort in reality
becomes Amorose's awkwardness onstage.
One expects her to break character and, as if
in a rehearsal, ask to try her lines a second
time.
As for Jim, The Gentlemen Caller, Tom re
fers to him as "the long-delayed, but always
expected something that we live for."
Charles Martinet's Jim is exactly that. Not
only does his visit bring a ray of hope into
Laura's life, he lights up the last act of the play
as well. Martinet's Jim, a faded high-school
hero with an irresistible streak of optimism, is
a study of the man who lives life with his
heart. There is a silly/sweet pathos in this Jim
that picks up not only the audience, but the
actors as well. Jim's confusion when he unex
pectedly kisses Laura, sparks one of
Amorose's most compelling moments.
Of course, all successes and failures cannot
be laid entirely at the actor's feet. The overall
design of the play is ultimately director J. D.
Trow's. Ms. Trow has attempted an unusual
interpretation of The Glass Menagerie. With
the exception of Martinet, she has used her
actors only in a simplistic sense. The broad
characterizations and zany, almost "mug
ging," humor that surround even the most
explosive moments don't seem to be con
gruent with the script. Seldom does Trow al
low the cast to work on particulars of their
characters. This is indeed a shame, for they all
show abilities beyond their overall per
formance levels. Clearly, Trow has studied
the script, for at times the production
achieves the poetic. Still, throughout the bulk
of the show, Trow ignores the fragility of the
play's lyric qualities. Time and again, she has
let her actors break a moment by reciting
their lines as if they were biblical decrees,
when in restraint one could more clearly see
the artistry of the full creative process. Trow
should be applauded for her courage in stat
ing The Class Menagerie in more sweeping
terms than are usually employed, but in this
case the experiment failed.
In both his introductory notes and the
opening speech of The Glass Menagerie,
Tennesee Williams speaks of his play as a
memory. It is, of course, autobiographical,
butitisa memory of something else as well. It
is a remembrance of a time, the romantic pe
riod of the late '30s when the Depression was
ending and the war in Europe hadn't yet be
come an issue in most American's minds. To
say that this was a romantic time doesn't imp
ly that Williams's vision is a happy one. The
background for The Glass Menagerie is three
years when the author, like Tom in the play,
worked in a shoe factory and supported his
mother and sister (three years that he would
later deduct from his age as unproductive,
wasted time). The technique the author uses
to convey this memory is difficult to translate
into staging. When first produced in 1944,
Menagerie was considered a step away from
the theater of the day, i.e., realism, and a
triumph of "plastic theater," utilizing time
shifts, unreal dialogue, pantomime, and ex
pressionistic settings. The San Jose Repertory
Company's current production is true to the
image of the original concept, but lacks
depth, making for an uneven, if at times mag
netic, evening.
San Jose Repertory has recently, and for
tunately, been made home by a number of
