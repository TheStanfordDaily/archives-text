# US â€” China student exchange program
## New guidelines possible for future exchanges 
### Christine Myers Senior staff writer 
Officials who administer scholarly
exchange programs between the
United States and the People's Re
public of China claim different in
terpretations of reciprocity in ex
change have clouded the first years
of the experiment.
As a result, the Chinese govern
ment reportedly will cut back the
number of American social scientists
permitted to visit China until a better
mutual understanding is reached.
In the larger scheme of U.S.-China
reconciliation, exchange programs
have proven an important aspect of
the relationship between the two na
tions. For the Chinese, they are an
important step toward mod
ernization. For the Americans, they
should help to cement a strong rela
tionship with China.
At issue is equality of access for
Americans, who complain they are
subjected to an overwhelming
number of restrictions while the Chi
nese scholars have virtually un
restricted access to materials.
According to Tom Fingar, assistant
director of Stanford's U.S.-China
program, American research in fields
such as history and anthropology has
been stymied by these restrictions.
Many American scholars are con

cerned that research may be further
hindered, as access seems to have
retrogressed with recent develop
ments.
New unofficial Chinese guidelines
for social science and humanities re
search restrict on-site investigation
to three weeks at a time, and only in
urban areas. In addition, American
exchange screening committees will
attempt to select applicants who are
better qualified linguistically and
professionally to work in China.
From its beginning in early 1979,
the exchange has lacked balance.
The number of foreign scholars in
the United States is significantly
greater than the number of Ameri

cans who leave. About 7000 Chinese
the United States since
the exchange's inception, while 31Y
estimated 600 to 700 Americans have
worked in China.
Chinese guests are generally in
terested in engineering and the basic
sciences, while American scholars
have for the most part been involved
in social science and humanities re
search.
Because social scientists and their
methodologies are still new to China,
Fingar said, the research possibilities
in China were not originally ex
pected to be very great. Also, it is dif
ficult to find qualified Chinese schol
ars who can be spared to work with

American researchers, which is what
the Chinese government prefers.
The dearth of real research about
"what makes Chinese society tick,"
according to Fingar, makes the first
tentative attempts to explore it a deli
cate situation. "We're so used to
being pounded and probed like
melons in our society, but the Chi
nese are not," said Fingar, noting that
Chinese and Americans have dif
ferent notions of what information is
private and must be protected by of
ficials.

Stanford and the politics of ex
change.)
