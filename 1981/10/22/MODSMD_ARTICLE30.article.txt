# Dern subhuman in 'Tattoo'
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
In his early pictures, Bruce Dern con
veyed such a strong sense of tension be
tween gentility and the menace lurking
beneath it that his performances —
always in supporting roles — often had
more resonance than those of the starts.
When his talents gained recognition
and he began to appear in larger parts
in major movies, the vocal and physical
oddities that had distinguished him as a
rear guard player, rather than being
supplanted by richer, more subtly
nuanced characterizations,
mushroomed. In Tattoo, as in every film
I've seen Dern in for the past five years,
he's about as understated as Lionel Bar
rymore used to be: he sends off psy
chotic vibrations even before he opens
his mouth. I had to think back to Drive,
He Said or The Great Gatsby — or his
last good work, as a latter-day Babbitt in
Michael Ritchie's Smile — to remember
why I ever thought he could act.
Tattoo is a dreadful movie about a tat

too artist named Carl Kinsky (Dern)
who becomes fixated on a model, Mad
dy Summers (Maud Adams); he invites
her to his apartment for dinner but
throws her out when she suggests that
they have sex, makes several abortive
attempts to see her again, and finally
kidnaps, tattoos and degrades her in a
scene that I can't describe because I
walked out early in the second hour.
What I saw of the film in no way of
fended me; it takes some skill to be of
fensive. Bob Brooks, who directed Tat
too — from a script by Joyce Bunuel —
not only can't tell a story; he can't de
cide on a tone and stick to it. About half
of the scenes I watched were stylized in
some not easily definable way: in a fam
ily dinner table exchange, for example,
Carl's relatives seemed to be deliberate
caricatures, but Brooks's purpose in
directing them in that way remained a
mystery — especially since the style
didn't carry over into the fashion pho

tography sequences, for example,
which had a peculiar, semi-satirical
tone. Brooks doesn't appear to have
worked out any of his ideas; the effect is
that of decisions pulled out of a hat
Maud Adams, a pretty model with
Raquel Welch lips and cheekbones,
gives a thoroughly unconvincing per
formance that is further marred by an
accent of indeterminate origin that
controls even the emotional color of
her line readings. I couldn't fathom
anything this woman did from the mo
ment she accepted the invitation of a
glaring lunatic to eat Japanese food
with him in Hoboken — but that, ob
viously, is not completely the fault of
the actress. No one could play the vic
tim in this graceless rehash of Psycho
and Taxi Driver and The Collector,
probably — and it's becoming increas
ingly difficult to play a human being at
all opposite Bruce Dern, who in this un
fortunate phase could probably turn
Othello into Grand Guignol.
