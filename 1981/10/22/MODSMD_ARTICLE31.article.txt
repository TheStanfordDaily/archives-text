# Getting high on dance

Pilobolus is commonly known as a genus of
phototropic fungi that grows on horse dung and
towards the light. Just a plain, brown mushroom.
It is also the name of one of the most successful
and popular modern dance companies in Amer
ica. It is a group of 10 dancers, six of whom per
form, that is anything but plain and brown.
The group was founded in 1970 by two
Dartmouth undergraduates who were "sort of
taking a composition dance class for easy units."
You know how that goes. However, when their
teacher saw their final composition — a piece
that initiated their unique, acrobatic dance style
—■ she whisked them to New York University to
perform at a college dance workshop. The au
dience was impressed, and the non-dance dan
cers received such encouragement from
modern dance masters Murray Louis and Alwin
Nikolais that they arrived back in Dartmouth de
vising ways to explain their new ambitions to
their friends, their advisors. . .their parents?
Thus the Vermont Natural Theatre, later
Pilobolus, was formed, and the mushroom
mushroomed.
The first performance of Pilobolus's residency
here last week opened with the composition en
titled "Molly's Not Dead," choreographed col
lectively by five of the dancers. This col
laborative process is typical of the group's
choreography. They have decided against a sin
gle artistic director, realizing that the input from
all the company members is a key to their suc
cess. Anyhow, "Molly's Not Dead" was obvious
ly a result of this process. It is danced by all six
dancers with great vigor and humor. How can I
describe it? Their moves are not pure, classical
dance by any means. Instead, they are a mixture
of acrobatics, drama, classical and modern tech
niques, and the Pilobolus imagination. That is,
ensemble hugging, clinging, crawling, and roll
ing, the like of which is seen nowhere else. They
do not insist on anything out of the ordinary.
They do, however, insist on strength, concentra
tion, precise movement, and nothing too seri
ous.
The second piece of the evening, "The Empty
Suitor," also collectively choreographed, dem
onstrated the company's ability to do drama as
well as dance. This piece is a clever enactment of
a street scene complete with beggars, news
papers, and a park bench. The most astonishing
movement in this piece came during Michael

Earl Black/Daily
Tracy's infallible balancing act upon six rolling
cylinders.
The third and final composition was "Day
Two," choreographed by Moses Pendleton —
one of the original Dartmouth undergraduates,
It all starts with a thunderstorm that flows into
music from the Talking Heads' album My Life in
the Bush of Ghosts. As was explained at
Pilobolus's lecture demonstration the night
before, this piece was inspired from the crazy rit
uals that developed between the group mem
bers while they played around during a 24-hour
thunderstorm — i.e., running naked through
Connecticut forests and rolling in the mud.
Well, whatever their secret may be, it allows
Pilobolus — with their strength, their ingenuity,
and their humor - to give a most impressive per
formance.
Mushroom or not, I was high on them. I think
everyone was high.
