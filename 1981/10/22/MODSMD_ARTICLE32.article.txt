## Duvall and De Niro face off; both are winners 
### Steve Vineberg 
| ) Robert Duvall's smile in True
{ Confessions is the smile both of
a cop who knows he's smart —
}• Officer Tom Spellacy — and of
an actor who knows he's good.
He has soaked himself in the
i, character he's playing; it drips
off him even when he doesn't
112 •
say a vyord. Duvall has for most
of the past decade been in the
J rear guard of the best Ameri
can actors: always acknowl
edged, especially by other per
formers, as first-rate, he has
I' never been a star, perhaps be
< cause he doesn't have the sort
of personality that lends itself,
to conventional casting — or,
to put it another way, he's not
handsome and he can't be
counted on to give the same
1 style of performance over and
over again. No one who saw
him in Apocalypse Now would
[ claim that he's too understated
for big theatrical parts: his
Lieutenant Kilgore, who
bombs an island so that he can
surf off it, wa%»so brilliantly
audacious that he eclipsed ev
erybody else in the film, and
one couldn't understand why
Coppola hadn't made Kilgore,
rather than the dully cryptic
Kurtz, the of Ameri
can insanity in Vietnam. Now,
in True Confessions, he plays a
man who stays sane in the
midst of Yeveral varieties of
chaos: the daily mire of his job
as an'LA. police detective, the
disaster his marriage has
turned into, and the unholy
mistakes of his past, when he
moonlighted as a Tniddleman
for a vice ring.
As Duvall plays him, Tommy
Spellacy's inability to delude
himself about what a mess he
has made of his life charges his
wit; that bull's-eye delivery re
flects years of seeing the joke in
the nasty truth. When Tommy
laughs, he sounds like he's
choking, and he laughs often in
appreciation of his own deft
ness. When a perfectly timed

obscenity silences an unfriend
ly maitre d', Tommy smiles
broadly and genuflects as he
makes his way to the table
where his brother the priest is
eating lunch.
As Monsignor Desmond
Spellacy, Robert De Niro still
has Jake La /ylotta's thick neck
from Raging Bull, but he looks
far different here: thinner yet
flabbier, out of shape, like a
wasted cherub. His fleshy
cheeks make his eyes look
beadier — eyes that register
each observation, 4s though
Des were punching potentially
valuable information into an
unseen computer, Des is as
wise a manipulator as his
brother — the priest as politi
cian — and he surrounds
himself with other manipu
lators, sacred and secular; the
dull, insulated look comes
from years of burying himself
in the suffocating atmosphere
of testimonial dinners and golf
games that front for business
transactions. It's an extremely
interesting performance, so
subtle that he doesn't appear
to be acting at all (as in The Last
Tycoon) — but don't let him
fool you. .
True Confessions, adapted
by John Gregory Dunne and
his wife Joan Didion from
Dunne's novel and directed by
Ulu Grosbard, has its roots in
the urban melodramas that
came out of Hollywood in the
'30s and '40s.
In novel form, True Con
fessions had good, tough
dialogue — the cops and hoods
and hookers were humorously
candid about their carnality —
but it lacked focus. The murder
mystery was so carelessly
plotted, and the wrap-up so
disappointing, that you felt that
Dunne must have been trying
to get at something else, some
thing more important. But the
relationship between the
brothers — potentially the

most intriguing element of the
story — never moved into the
foreground. Though the plot
has been simplified, the movie
compounds the book's faults,
partly because the script ren
ders them more clearly visible
in two hours but mostly be
cause it has Ulu Grosbard as di
rector when it needs Francis
Ford Coppola. Grosbard has a
good stage director's instinct
for establishing the mood of a
scene through the use of com
monplace detail: the scenes
that show us the routine of
cops whoare nolongersuscep
tible to shock have the same
authenticity as the early se
quences in his last movie,
Straight Time, in which Dustin
Hoffman played an incor
rigible thief just released from
prison. (Straight Time, which
was almost universally ignored
when it opened in 1978, was a
worthwhile treatment of the
subject of criminal recidivism.)
But Grosbard doesn't know
how to layer a scene, as the best
filmmakers do: there's only
one thing going on at a time in
this movie, and since he's an
honest worker and refuses to
pump artificial adrenalin into
the dramdtic situations, a low
key encounter (like the golf
game in which Des blackmails
one of his cronies) is likely to
be limp. I prefer this approach
to hysteria, of course, but I
can't help wishing Grosbard
had better film sense. The mov
ie wants shape — and more var
iation in tone, and a sharp,
haunting ending instead of the
soggy one Dunne and Didion
and Grosbard have given it.(It
would be so much better if it
ended two minutes earlier.)
However, it's possible, I
think, to reject much of the
writing and directing, and hate
the look of the movie (Owen
Roizman, a master photogra
pher, concentrates on grimy
browns and thick, lumpy tex
tures — like pea soup) — and
still love True Confessions.

Grosbard's real gift is for work
ing with actoi» (Dustin Hoff
man, Gary Biisey, and Harry
Dean Stanton were all at the
height of their powers in
Straight Time), arid the actors
carry this movie. Its hard to
think of a recent American
movie with a set of per
formances to match this one;
one has to return to last year's
Brubaker, or even farther back,
to the heyday of Robert
Altman. Everyone in True Con
fessions is good: Rose
Gregorio, Kenneth McMillan
as Tommy's earthy partner, Ed
Flanders as one of Des's pals,
trapped in a sticky situation be
cause of a girl he slept with,
Don Hedaya as an irrepressible
reporter who might have
stepped out of a Damon Run
yon story. Jeanette Nolan's one
scene as Des and Tom's moth
er, who has gone senile but not
soft, is probably the best of her
career — she practically
metamorphoses into Colleen
Dewhurst. As the old Cardinal,
who no longer masks his ma
neuvers or his dislikes with po
liteness, Cyril Cusack has a
great face-off with Burgess
Meredith; and you think, as
you do when you watch Burt
Lancaster in Atlantic City or
Cattle Annie and Little
Britches, of the nobility of ac
tors who continue to perform
like this way past what we
foolishly think of as their
prime.


Detective Tom Spellacy (Robert Duvall) and his brother Monsignor Desmond Spellacy (Robert De Niro) face each
other over coffee in True Confessions.
