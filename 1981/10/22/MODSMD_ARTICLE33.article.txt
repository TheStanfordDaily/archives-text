# 'Chariots' at front of pack

Chariots of Fire is compulsive viewing;
both a work of integrity and a highly enter
taining movie, it is something rare in modern
filmmaking.
Great care has been taken to get every de
tail right. There are no jarring anachronisms
(such as can be found in a film even of the
quality of Breaker Morant) to distract the au
dience from the main action. We see four
young Olympic runners in the context of
their own time and place — post-World War I
England, with its rigid social convention. But
wo still recognize in them the fierceambition
to excel that drives men on today. The effect
is very moving, perhaps more so when we re
alize that the story is true.
Chariots of Fire is the first feature film
directed by Hugh Hudson — yet another
"discovery" of producer David Puttnam, who
was responsible for the debut films of Alan
Parker (Midnight Express), Ridley Scott (The
Duellists), and Michael Apted (Stardust).
Hudson is quite clear that the choice of rel
atively unknown actors for leading roles is vi
tal to the film's impact. "With well-known ac
tors," he has said, "the film would have been
less believable."
And indeed Ben Cross, a young actor at
present with the Royal Shakespeare Com
pany, is very believable as Harold Abrahams,
the English Jew who gets back at the anti-
Semitism he meets with everywhere by de
termining to run better than anybody else.
Lan Charleson plays the difficult part of Eric
Liddell, the Scotsman torn between his desire
to run and a conviction of his mission as an
evangelising Christian, with great sensitivity.
And the part of th? likeable young aristocrat,

Lord Lindsay, who practises hurdling over
champagne glasses, is played most attractive
ly by a complete newcomer, Nicholas Farrell.
Well-known actors are also to be found,
but in supporting roles: Sir John Gielgud has
a delightful ten minutes on screen as the
pompous Master of Trinity College, Cam
bridge. Dfnnis Christopher (Breaking Away)
and Brad Davis (Midnight Express) have
cameo roles as the fearsome American
runners at the 1924 Olympics. And a surprise:
Lindsay Anderson, director of If. . . and Oh,
Lucky Man!, makes a rare acting appearance
as the Master of Caius College, Cambridge.
The Cambridge sequences of the film were
in fact shot in Britain's oldest public high
school, Eton College, and the director has
made excellent use of its ancient and impos
ing beauty. Indeed, beauty is one of the film's
greatest assets; we are conducted from the
formality of Cambridge, from the calm of
Lord Lindsay's beautiful house and gardens,
from the wild tranquility of the hills and val
leys of Scotland, to Paris and the fierce com
petition of the 1924 Olympic Games. And
here, Vangelis's brilliant score assists in rais
ing the audience to a pitch of excitement
almost as high as that of the runners them
selves.
The enormous popularity of Chariots of
Fire in Britain is almost certainly connected
with the British upsurge qf enthusiasm forthe
contemporary English runners and world rec
ord holders Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett.
But the film's appeal transcends national
boundaries, because it has something to say
about the nature of naked ambition which
will be understood by everyone, everywhere.
And it says it very well indeed.
