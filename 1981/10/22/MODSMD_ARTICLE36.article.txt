Reagan denies strategic policy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yes
terday denounced as "outright deception" the
assertion by some West European neutralists
and the Soviet Union that a nuclear war limited
to Europe is part of U.S. strategic planning.
A presidential statement, issued aboard Air
Force One during Reagan's flight to the North-
South summit meeting in Cancun, Mexico, ac
cused the Soviets of launching a propaganda
drive.
But the statement was also designed to clarify
a statement Reagan made last Friday when he
said that "you could have the exchange of tac
tical weapons against troops in the field without
it bringing either one of the major powers to
pushing the button."
Reagan's reply then to an interviewer's ques
tion on the theoretical possibility of a nuclear
war limited to Europe was immediately seized
on by opponents of NATO's plan to install new
tactical nuclear missiles in Europe to counter a
buildup of medium-range Soviet missiles there.
The Soviets quickly picked up the theme and
issued a statement by President Leonid
Brezhnev through Tass Tuesday denying Rea
gan's assertion that the Soviets believe a nuclear
war can be won. The statement also challenged
Reagan to renounce "the very idea of nuclear
attack as a criminal one."
Reagan said that "the suggestion that the
United States could even consider fighting a
nuclear war at Europe's expense is an outright
deception," Reagan said.
"The essense of U.S. nuclear strategy," the
President added, "is that no aggressor should
believe that the use of nuclear weapons in Eu
rope could reasonably be limited to Europe."
AWACS sale set back
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
uphill fight to save his $8.5 billion Saudi arms
sale from congressional rejection suffered a ma
jor setback yesterday when Senate Democratic
Leader Robert Byrd decided against the pack
age.
Byrd, whose vote and political weight was re
garded as critical by both sides, told the Senate
he fears the sale of AWACS radar planes and
F-15 jetfighter weaponry "places (U.S.) interests
in jeopardy.
"I am concerned that we are fast approaching
the point where we are handing over grenades
to potential adversaries in the region with the
pins already pulled," Byrd said.
He said he concluded the sale might fuel a
Moslem extremist rebellion in Saudi Arabia, es
calate the Middle East arms race and disrupt
Mideast peace efforts.
Byrd, who had dropped a hint Tuesday he
might vote for the sale, kept his true decision
secret until nearly 15 minutes into an hour-long
Senate speech on the subject.
Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston im
mediately predicted that Byrd's announcement
would stiffen Democrats' opposition and
"greatly increases the prospect that this sale will
be blocked.
"I regard this as the crucial turning point in
the debate," Cranston told the Senate.
Later, Cranston told reporters he now counts
55 votes committed or leaning against the sale,
41 for and 4 unpredictable.
NATO OKs new weapons
Gleneagles, Scotland — NATO defense min
isters reaffirmed their governments' intentions
yesterday to proceed with upgrading nuclear
weapons in Western Europe, the alliance's most
controversial program and the focus of revived
anti-nuclear movements on the continent.
As a concession to the strength of those

movements, the United States agreed in the
final communique of the defense ministers'
meeting here to aim ideally at abandoning the
program if the Soviets reciprocate by agreeing
to remove their European missile force during
U.S.-Soviet negotiations to start in Geneva Nov.
30.
That expressed goal can be used by politically
harrassed West European governments to hold
off some neutralist attacks, a senior U.S. defense
official said. But it was so hedged, he added, to
make it almost certain that they will not accept
that option.
According to the communique, the United
States will seek "equitable and verifiable agree
ments" with Moscow on keeping medium
range nuclear forces in Europe "at the lowest at
tainable levels. On the basis of reciprocity, the
zero level remains a possible option under ideal
circumstances."
"Zero level" means cancelling the NATO
program to deploy 572 U.S. ballistic and cruise
missiles starting in 1983. As the United States in
terprets this sentence, however, the senior of
ficial said, the Soviets would have to reciprocate
by "totally disbanding" the estimated 250 of its
new SS-20 missiles as well as 350 older SS-4 and
SS-5s targeted on Western Europe.
Political 'Slap' at Brown
Washington — The House adopted a Senate
approved amendment yesterday to give the
U.S. agriculture secretary the power to combat
Mediterranean fruit fly or other plant pest in
festations when he determines that affected
states are taking inadequate measures.
The farm legislation, approved by voice vote,
was widely viewed as a political slap at Califor
nia Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
Rep. William M« Thomas (R-Calif.) whq spon
sored the amendment, said the measure was
needed to prevent a repeat of the experience in
his state this year, when Brown agreed to aerial
pesticide spraying only after the federal gov
ernment threatened to quarantine all affected
fruits and vegetables in the state.
"If this legislation had been law earlier this
year, the federal government could have gone
into California and done what was right, over
riding what were clearly the political motives of
the governor in failing to spray," Thomas said in
an interview after adoption of his proposal.
B.T. Collins, Brown's chief of staff, asked
about House approval of the measure, said:
"That's politics. It looks like the farmers got
somthing and Thomas gets to take a shot at the
governor. If they want to throw stones, I can un
derstand that."
New nuclear policy passed
Washington — The Senate voted a major
change in U.S. nuclear non-proliferation policy
yesterday by requiring the president to suspend
all foreign aid to any country currently without
nuclear capability that explodes a nuclear de
vice.
The action, which surprised the adminis
tration, could eventually affect such U.S. allies
as Israel, South Africa and Taiwan, all of which
are suspected of seeking to develop nuclear
weapons and which also benefit from American
aid programs.
The unexpected amendment was offered by
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to a bill authorizing
$5.7 billion in foreign aid this fiscal year.
The Senate had just voted 51-45 to require
suspension of foreign aid to Pakistan or India if
either country detonates a nuclear device.
Aimed primarily at Pakistan, which is believed
to be developing nuclear weapons, that
amendment was offered by Sen. John Glenn (D-
Ohio).
Helms then proposed that the Glenn amend

ment be broadened to apply to all new entrants
into the nuclear club. The conservative Caroli
nian, normally an administration supporter, this
time chided the administration for failing to live
up to its professed non-proliferation policy.
"I'm surprised the administration is not leading
the effort to put some muscle into its non-pro
liferation policy," he said.
However, once Glenn prevailed, the adminis
tration welcomed Helms' amendment. "We
don't want to be in the position of discriminat
ing against Pakistan," a State Department of
ficial said, and added that the Helms variation
"will be easier to explain to Pakistan."
Reagan to curb immigration
Washington — The Reagan administration is
asking Congress to give the president ex
traordinary emergency powers to keep un
wanted immigrants off U.S. shores. It has also
proposed that the power of the courts to review
immigration decisions for fairness be sharply
curtailed.
In an effort to prevent a recurrence of last
year's influx of 140,000 Cubans and Haitians into
southern Florida, President Ronald Reagan —
as part of a top-to-bottom revision of immigra
tion laws — is asking for emergency authority
that could last as long as one year and would in
volve manyspecial powers:
— The president could order the sealing of
any harbor, port, airport, road or "any other
place, structure or location" to prevent un
wanted aliens from getting into the country.
— He could restrict travel by Americans, both
domestically and to a country named in an
emergency declaration. Any type of boat, vehi
cle or aircraft could be forbidden to go within a
certain distance of the designated country.
Aliens apprehended could be put into deten
tion camps to await deportation hearings, and
'they could only be»released at the discretion of
the attorney general. The attorney general
could transfer the immigrants from one facility
to another at will, and no court would have au
thority to review his decision.
The president is asking authority to board for
eign vessels on the high seas to search for illegal
aliens without authority of the foreign country
— which the administration acknowledges is a
violation of international law.
In enforcing the emergency provisions, the
president would be authorized to caN for as
sistance from the Army, Navy and Air Force, as
well as state and local agencies, and he could
empower them to assist activities including the
seizures of vessels, arrests and detention.
The legislation would allow the president to
declare the emergency situation any time he
determines that "a substantial number of aliens
who lack documents authorizing entry to the
United States" are either on their way or about
to embark.
