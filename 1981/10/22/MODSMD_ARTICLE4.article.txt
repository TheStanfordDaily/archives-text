# P.A. election lacks hot issues, controversy
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Even with ten candidates running
for five open positions, the Palo Alto
city council election has proved to be
one of the quietest campaigns in re
cent municipal history.
Perhaps because there is no single
overwhelming issue in this election,
each candidate has gone out of his or
her way to show just how they differ.
Heavy emphasis has been placed on
the individual's personal experience
and qualifications. The four incum
bents have emphasized their records
on the council, and the six other con
tenders have tried to demonstrate
the problems with the past and their
how their own plans for the council
deviate from that norm.
Yet it is difficult not to notice the
predominance of the moderate per
spective, of candidates who are will
ing to "preserve open space" in the
area while at the same time being
concerned with "the need for new
housing." Only a few have shown
any real deviation from that theme.

News analysis

A majority of the incumbents said
they feel the council has done a good
job by serving Palo Alto in a bal
anced, moderate fashion, and that
they would continue in that tradi
tion. Ellen Fletcher, an incumbent
who expressed this opinion, said she
"hasn't seen any real opposition to
council actions." Fletcher said she
felt two of the most important issues

facing the incoming council are land
use and traffic.
"They are interrelated problems/'
she said, "which involve questions
such as public transportation and
safe opportunities of bicycling."
Fletcher also said the "com
prehensive" approach should be ap
plied to the housing issue.
Betsy Bechtel, another incumbent,
expressed a similar moderate posi
tion. She stressed her support for
open foothills and preserving Arastra
lands as parklands, while at the same
time stating "I have voted for hous
ing and would do so in the future."
"We have to look very hard at
growth in the Palo Alto community,"
she said. "There have always been a
variety of people here, but un
fortunately I think it is becoming less
so."
Larry Klein, a third incumbent, was
also pleased with the approach of the
last council, and stated that one of
the main problems facing the council
in the future would be "to get a bet
ter handle on the number of jobs in
the area.
"We have more commuters than
any Bay Area city except San Francis
co," said Klein. "And we may lose
residents who make lower incomes."
Klein proposes that the city rezone
some industrial land to residential
status.
The fourth incumbent, Gary
Fazzino, claims that the next four
years are going to require a balance
between budget cutting and main
taining services within the communi
ty. He sees issues such as school site
purchases and protection of neigh
borhoods from noise and traffic as
major issues.
Other contenders for the council
positions each claim they are bring
ing a fresh, unique perspective to the
race itself and also to the council, if
olected.
"I basically represent another so
cio-economic class, the lower-mod
erate incomes, which aren't really
represented on the council now,"
said candidate john Fredrich. "Thus
I'm mostly concerned with issues
such as expediting affordable hous
ing construction and assuring that in
light of budget cuts services for sen
iors are not drastically reduced."
Edith Zitelli, another contender for
the council seat, said that the current
council concerns itself mostly with
land use and zoning issues.
"These are certainly important, but
I would also like to see some dis
cussion of issues such as toxic
chemical disposal among the in
dustries within Palo Alto," she said. "I
think neighborhood groups should
be able to go to a corporation and say
'what are you using and where are
you disposing of it."
Michael Cobb claims that he
would bring a new perspective to the
council of "the long-range picture."
Instead of approaching the issues
from a short term, "solution" per
spective, Cobb said his adminis
trative expertise would help in com
prehensive planning, especially on
such issues as school site purchases.
Herb Borok, although unavailable
for comment, has listed as one of his
primary objectives to "strictly en

force the laws covering open meet
ings, access to public records, cam
paign finances and conflicts of in
terest." Borok also brings to the cam
paign an extensive background in
conservation issues and advocating
affordable housing in Palo Alto.
Gail Wooley claims that her back
ground in the historical aspects of the
city would facilitate a realistic appr
roach to the issues. "Sometimes we
need to preserve, sometimes we
need to strike out, such as in dealing
with the housing issue, " she said.
Doug Winslow, another contender
for the council seat, wants the city
council to govern from the per
spective of "human values", which
includes protection from crime, den
sity and traffic intrusion and a com
mittment to open space and park
preservation.
