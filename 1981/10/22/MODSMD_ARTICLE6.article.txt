# Union ills still haunt the University
## 
### Jeffrey Golden (First in a series) 
When Stanford's clerical work
ers voted almost 2-to-l against af
filiating with United Stanford Em
ployees (USE) Union Local 715 last
spring, the University's official re
action mixed relief with cautious
conciliation.

News analysis

"I'm very pleased with the large
voter turnout (about 85' percent),
which indicates the importance of
the issue," said President Donald
Kennedy on the evening of May 7,
after the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) monitors an
nounced a final tally of 930-554
against unionization.
"I'm also gratified by the re
sult," he said. "But I recognize the
message that we must work to in
crease the awards and satisfac
tions associated with some very
important jobs at Stanford."
But as the routine of another ac
ademic year settles in, some of the
people holding those very impor
tant jobs openly doubt that the
message has been received. The
struggle waged last winter and
spring between the University and
the combined forces of the Office
Staff Organizing Committee

(OSOC) and USE 715 organizers
was emotional and at times bitter.
It opened new wounds that are
unlikely to heal soon.
It also aggravated some old
ones. OSOC's history begins in
June, 1979, when it evolved from a
discussion group of women office
workers at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC). Joyce
Tipps-Coates, a SLAC secretary
who chaired the group until last
July, when it disbanded, points to
a study that showed an average
yearly wage increase from
1976-1979 of 5.3 percent for SLAC
office workers and 19 percent for
technicians.
"Same old story," Tipps-Coates
said. "We were undervalued, ov
erworked, and underpaid."
Tipps-Coates said OSOC be
came a campus-wide group after
the SLAC management told the
women that all wages were set
solely by the University. Three
hundred office workers attended
OSOC's first all-campus meeting
on Aug. 1, 1979. For over a year,
members of the group spread
throughout the University the
message that clerical organization
was the only means of throwing
off, in the words of a Green Li
brary employee, "our second
class citizenship."

The group focused on wage
scales ("The University pays top
money to professors and expects
to find their staff at a discount,"
charged USE spokesperson Betsy
Murray); under-classification,
whereby supervisors allegedly ex
pect work designated for higher
paying positions to be performed
by lower-paid employees; job se
curity; child care and improved
working conditions.
By last November, OSOC had
collected almost 1100 "blue
cards," the official forms request
ing an NLRB-supervised vote to
settle the question of
unionization, from Stanford's ap
proximately 1900 office workers.
At the end of January, after a
series of meetings to set the for
mal details, the NLRB announced
May 7 as the date when the
clericals would decide whether to
join the University's technical
maintenance workers as members
of USE Local 715.
Why did the 1100 provisional
statements of interest in the union
represented by November's blue
cards shrink to half that many pro
union votes in the May election?
The answers — and there are
many from which to select — say

as much about the current mood
of some of the Stanford clericals as
they do about last year's cam
paign.
A few reasons are clearly non
controversial — routine turnover
of employees could explain some
missing pro-union votes, and the
NLRB regulation that no "super
visor" (a hazy category in some
Stanford offices) can vote in an
election for union certification
also disqualified a number of
signers.
But beyond those technical ad
justments, several of last year's or
ganizers blame the attrition on
what they see as a deceitful, in
timidating, and ultimately suc
cessful anti-union campaign or
chestrated by the University ad
ministration.
"They made it very difficult,"
said Jill Coelho, a Green Library
employee, "and very, very fright
ening."
"Except for the people over in
SLAC and those of us in the librar
ies, most people are isolated in
different departments, so we had
trouble really getting together,"
said Coelho. "The University had
a direct line to everyone and be
lieve me, they used it."
