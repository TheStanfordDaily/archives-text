## OPEC nears agreement on price 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — OPEC oil min
isters, trying for the third time this year to
unify prices, appear ready to reach agree
ment at a special meeting in Geneva on
Oct. 29 that was announced Tuesday by
OPEC president Subroto, Indonesia's
energy minister.
A single basic reference price has
eluded the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries since early
1979 when the Iranian revolution and, lat
er, the Iraq-Iran war, allowed OPEC's price
hawks to break ranks with moderate mem
bers and run up their oil charges.
The announcement of another emer
gency meeting on the issue, following frus
trating failures to reach agreement in May
and August, signals that previous obstacles
to a deal have fallen away. Subroto told re
porters in Jakarta, "We have already more
or less formed a consensus to unify
prices."
Although he declined to say the level at
which unity might be achieved, $34 per
barrel has been widely predicted.
Such a compromise would require of
ficial price reductions by the militant
North African producers, Libya and Alger
ia, as well as by such moderates as Vene
zuela. In return, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
dominant producer, would increase the
price for its Arabian light crude by $2 per
barrel.
Unity may boost prices
This may mean, in sum, a slight rise in the
average price of OPEC oil, since the Saudi
increase would outweigh the price cuts by
smaller producers. But a unified price
should still benefit consumers, since it is
expected to be accompanied by the prom
ise of a freeze in oil prices until the end of
next year.
The return to a unified price after two
years of disarray would be a triumph for
Saudi Arabia, as well as for the conserva
tion measures and the shift to alternative
sources of energy practiced by oil consum

ing countries that have been trying to
cushion the strain high oil prices have had
on their economies.
Saudi Arabia has kept its own produc
tion of less expensive oil high, thereby
helping to glut the market. Saudi strategy
appears to have been motivated partly to
reimpose order on the market, partly to
court U.S. favor, and partly to strengthen
Saudi Arabia's own position in OPEC.
The result, in any case, has been to force
most other OPEC producers to cut their
prices or suffer sales losses.

'We have already more or less formed a consensus
to unify prices ... My opinion is that here will not
be much problem conerning differentials — that
has been .. .settled already/
— OPEC president Subroto, energy minister from
Indonesia

Saudi's want freeze at $34
A Saudi proposal for a $34 per barrel uni
fied price, which included the strong hint
of a Saudi production cut, was spurned in
both meetings earlier this year, and Saudi
oil minister Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani
was said to be unwilling to attend further
special meetings unless agreement on his
country's desired unified price and ac
companying freeze would be assured.
Venezuela, which has a $36 per barrel
rate, proved a main obstacle to agreement
in August, claiming that domestic political
considerations prevented it from lowering
prices. Oil accounts for most of Venezue
la's export trade and for 72 percent of the
state's income.
But Venezuela's opposition has soft
ened in recent days as world demand for
OPEC oil continued to drop.
Drop in OPEC output
OPEC oil output fell to 20.7 million bar
rels per day in August, down 23 percent
from its level of a year ago, and, according

to industry sources, it may have slipped to
20 million barrels per day in September.
Also helping to ease the way toward
price unification was a decision by Iraq
earlier this month to reduce the price of its
crude by $2 per barrel in line with a $34 per
barrel reference.
Neither Algeria nor Libya, the highest
price producers, have shown public will
ingness to come down from their high
rates for an OPEC agreement, but Subroto
indicated Tuesday that the North African
producers could be covered in the fixing

of differentials imposed above the official
price which take account of oil quality.
"Unification will be the main part of the
discussions," Subroto said. "My opinion is
that there will not be much problem con
cerning differentials — that has been more
or less settled already."
Subroto said the special conference
would be a short one and any decision it
made on prices would be implemented
immediately.
Saudi Arabia's pressure tactics have an
gered other OPEC members. As a "good
will" gesture in August the Saudis an
nounced a cut in production by one mil
lion barrels per day to nine million barrels
per day. This still kept the Saudis as OPEC's
largest producer by far, accounting for 45
percent of the organization's total output.
In return for price unification, Saudi
Arabia can be expected to cut its produc
tion again to allow the harder-hit members
to sell more oil and sort out their financial
mess.
