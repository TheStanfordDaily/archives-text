# Many Brazilians follow African spiritism
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Salvador, Brazil — It is late,
past midnight. The tropical air
is heavy. A compelling,
mesmerizing, almost painful
pounding of drums creates a
nearly unbearable antici
pation.
Dozens of people sway and
chant as colorfully clad women
move rhythmically. There is a
scream. The dancer quivers
and bleats as if taken mad.
Ogun, the god of iron and war,
has entered and taken
possession of the dancer.
It is a night of mystery and
awe, a night of celebration of
spirits and gods. It is a night of
candomble.
Candomble, Macumba,
voodoo. All are names for re

lated forms of spiritism, the re
ligion brought from Africa by
blacks in slave ships and still
practiced by their millions of
descendants, particularly here
in northeastern Brazil.
To its adherents, who in
clude a growing number of
whites, candomble is no
bizarre cult, but a vibrant, liv
ing religion as valid as Chris
tianity, a theology that explains
the meaning of creation, life
and death.
To others, namely the Ro
man Catholic Church and
skeptical social observers, can
domble is black magic, super
stition and a fad.
A major social force
Whatever it is, candomble is
a force to be reckoned with. In

1960 there were 1000 terreiros,
or centers of candomble, here
in Salvador. Now, there are
3000.
In 1980, President Joao Bap
tista Figueiredo, a retired army
general and a re
alist, put his stamp of accep
tance on candomble as a na
tional force when he met with
Olga de Alaketo, leader of
Salvador's oldest and most im
portant candomble terreiro.
While the center of can
domble and Brazilian spiritism
in general is here in heavily
black Salvador, the practice is a
national movement with as
many as 300,000 temples
throughout Brazil.
And it is spreading across the
frontiers. An estimated 300
spiritist centers exist in
Uruguay and 180 in Argentina,
both highly Europeanized
countries with nearly all-white
populations.
Almost every night along the
super-chic beaches of Rio de
Janeiro and in its richest neigh
borhoods, followers of
macumba, as spiritism is called
there, set up shrines to the
gods.
And it is not unusual for even
European and American resi
dents of Salvador to become in
itiates of candomble.

of spells and believe that spirits
can enter a human body?
Reaffirms African values
Some social scientists con
tend that candomble is a racial
statement, an endorsement of
African values in a society
whose 55 percent white majori
ty thinks of itself as more Eu
ropean than Brazilian.
Others argue that can
domble is a rejection of the
modernization that has swept
over Brazil in the last 25 years,'
changing the old traditions and
values of a once rural and
simple society.
To Olga de Alaketo, the high
priestess of Salvador's major
terreiro, which has founded in
1625, candomble is not out of
step with the world's main
stream religions.
"Candomble isn't amuse
ment," she said during a recent
seminar on the cult. "It's a re
ligion, a respectable thing."
She discussed one of the
most controversial aspects of
candomble, its relationship to
Roman Catholicism.
"I am an African, bpt I am
also a Catholic. And as we re
spect the church, the church
should respect this piece of
African heaven that we have
here in Brazil."
Indeed, there is an intertwin
ing of the two. An initiate into
candomble must be a baptized
Catholic, and candomble cere
monies begin with each person
making the sign of the cross.

Reaffirms African values
Some social scientists con
tend that candomble is a racial
statement, an endorsement of
African values in a society
whose 55 percent white majori
ty thinks of itself as more Eu
ropean than Brazilian.
Others argue that can
domble is a rejection of the
modernization that has swept
over Brazil in the last 25 years,'
changing the old traditions and
values of a once rural and
simple society.
To Olga de Alaketo, the high
priestess of Salvador's major
terreiro, which has founded in
1625, candomble is not out of
step with the world's main
stream religions.
"Candomble isn't amuse
ment," she said during a recent
seminar on the cult. "It's a re
ligion, a respectable thing."
She discussed one of the
most controversial aspects of
candomble, its relationship to
Roman Catholicism.
"I am an African, bpt I am
also a Catholic. And as we re
spect the church, the church
should respect this piece of
African heaven that we have
here in Brazil."
Indeed, there is an intertwin
ing of the two. An initiate into
candomble must be a baptized
Catholic, and candomble cere

making the sign of the cross.
Salvador, Brazil — It is late,
past midnight. The tropical air
is heavy. A compelling,
mesmerizing, almost painful
pounding of drums creates a
nearly unbearable antici
pation.
Dozens of people sway and
chant as colorfully clad women
move rhythmically. There is a
scream. The dancer quivers
and bleats as if taken mad.
Ogun, the god of iron and war,
has entered and taken
possession of the dancer.
It is a night of mystery and
awe, a night of celebration of
spirits and gods. It is a night of
candomble.
Candomble, Macumba,
voodoo. All are names for re

lated forms of spiritism, the re
ligion brought from Africa by
blacks in slave ships and still
practiced by their millions of
descendants, particularly here
in northeastern Brazil.
To its adherents, who in
clude a growing number of
whites, candomble is no
bizarre cult, but a vibrant, liv
ing religion as valid as Chris
tianity, a theology that explains
the meaning of creation, life
and death.
To others, namely the Ro
man Catholic Church and
skeptical social observers, can
domble is black magic, super
stition and a fad.
A major social force
Whatever it is, candomble is
a force to be reckoned with. In

1960 there were 1000 terreiros,
or centers of candomble, here
in Salvador. Now, there are
3000.
In 1980, President Joao Bap
tista Figueiredo, a retired army
general and a re
alist, put his stamp of accep
tance on candomble as a na
tional force when he met with
Olga de Alaketo, leader of
Salvador's oldest and most im
portant candomble terreiro.
While the center of can
domble and Brazilian spiritism
in general is here in heavily
black Salvador, the practice is a
national movement with as
many as 300,000 temples
throughout Brazil.
And it is spreading across the
frontiers. An estimated 300
spiritist centers exist in
Uruguay and 180 in Argentina,
both highly Europeanized
countries with nearly all-white
populations.
Almost every night along the
super-chic beaches of Rio de
Janeiro and in its richest neigh
borhoods, followers of
macumba, as spiritism is called
there, set up shrines to the
gods.
And it is not unusual for even
European and American resi
dents of Salvador to become in
itiates of candomble.
