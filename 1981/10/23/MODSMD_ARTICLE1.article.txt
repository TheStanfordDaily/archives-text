# Chief describes energy woes
## Government must consider future goals, objectives 
### Bill Ainsworth 
The most important part of the
government's role in formulating
energy policy involves taking long
term objectives into account, said
Rusty Schweikert, chairman of the
California State Energy Commission,
yesterday at Tresidder Union.
Schweikert spoke at the beginning of
the three-day "Youth Wants to
Know" energy conference spon
sored by the National Energy Foun
dation.
"Rarely is a business, that by its na
ture must make a profit to survive
and grow, concerned with the long
run," Schweikert said. In contrast to
business, government does not have
profit as its only consideration, he

said. As a result, government can bet
ter assume reponsibility for the long
run, said Schweikert.
Schweikert, a former astronaut,
was here replacing Governor Jerry
Brown, who cancelled his original
commitment as the keynote speaker
at the conference.
Schweikert said the nation's
energy situation can best be de
scribed by comparing the United
State's dependence on oil to the de
pendence of a heroin addict on hero
in. "Today the challenges in energy
oil dependence are one of the major
problems we see," he said.
Part of our energy problem can be
explained by the fact that our almost
exclusive reliance on petroleum has
made us a society dependent on one
liquid fuel, Schweikert said. Now we
are suffering the classic results of that
dependency, which include in
creased susceptibility to crises,
Schweikert said."Just as in agricul

ture when you have the same crop
for miles and miles, you become
more vulnerable to crises," he
added.
In an effort to alleviate this prob
lem, California istryingto diversify its
energy supplies and options, accord
ing to Schweikert. One way Califor
nia is attempting to do this and to in
sure stability in light of the current
high levels of energy demand is to
move toward a greater use of re
newable resources, Schweikert said.
Assessing the transformation from
oil to renewable energy, Schweikert
said it has been successful in the
sense that innovation in conserva
tion, high technology such as
photovoltaic cells, and exploration
intoalternative energies such as wind
power have greatly increased since
the oil price hikes of the 70s. But, he
said, it has not been successful in
terms of increased public discussion
