## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem — Egyptian, U.S.
and Israeli officials began a
round of Palestinian autonomy
talks yesterday that could set
the tone for the post-Sadat
Middle East peace process.
The nine days of nuts-and
bolts discussions by mid-level
technical specialists were or
dered last month by the chiefs
of the U.S., Israeli and Egyptian
autonomy delegations in an ef
fort to reach agreement on
some modest details left unset
tled in the Camp David accords
before taking on the tough
fundamental issues.
But the talks took on a new
significance with the assassina
tion Oct. 6 of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat. All three
sides in the complex nego
tiations now are looking to the
discussions at a Tel Aviv hotel
to provide the first hint of the
direction the peace process
will take following Sadat's
death.
Begin optimistic on talks
Israeli Prime Minister Men
achem Begin told the foreign
affairs and defense committee

newspapers.
The Egyptian leader told the

for the Palestinians. He said
that if a Palestinian state is es

Egypt advocates and Israel op
poses — that steps must be
taken.to make sure it does not
become a Soviet satellite.
"We will never agree to a So

of our two nations," Mubarak
said.
The talks will be conducted

Autonomy tor Palestinians
Under the terms of the
three-year-old Camp David
peace accords, the purpose of
the negotiations is to establish
a framework that will provide
"full autonomy" for the 1.2 mil
lion Palestinians who live in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza districts. So far, the
three sides have not even been
able to agree on an official def
inition of the word "auton
omy."
The difficulties facing the ne

gotiators were summed up
Wednesday by Moshe Are.is,
chairman of the Israeli Par
liament Foreign Affair's and De
fense Committee.
He said over Israel Radio that
the positions of Israel and
Egypt are in a "different direc
tion of almost 180 degrees."
"Egypt has been looking for
an autonomy framework that
will assure eventual Israeli
withdrawal from Judeah,
Samaria and Gaza," Arens said.
"Israel in effect has been look- ?
ing for the opposite — a i
framework that will assure con
tinued Israeli presence in these
areas.
