# Schmidt backs up Reagan

### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany â€” In a further effort to
quell the furor here over remarks by President
Ronald Reagan about a limited nuclear war,
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
Wednesday formally backed the president's
comments, saying they represented no de
parture from Western alliance strategy.
"The strategy of the North Atlantic alliance,
unchanged for 30 years, has been the deterrence
of attack against Western Europe by threatening
to use all suitable military means," Schmidt-said
in a statement. "This deterrence strategy should
never have been, and in the future should never
be, misunderstood as preparing for leading a
war in Europe."
"President Reagan has neither put in doubt
nor veered from this valid deterrence strategy.
The president has also not called any detail of it
into question," said Schmidt.
Upcoming Soviet talks
The German leader's statement included five
other points covering alliance strategy as well as
the upcoming U.S.-Soviet negotiations on limit

ing European-based nuclear weapons. It was
read to reporters following a regular West Ger
man government Cabinet meeting at which, ac
cording to a Bonn spokesman, Reagan's com
ments were the main topic on the agenda.
The controversy erupted after Reagan, in an
interview in Washington last Friday with a group
of American editors, said he could conceive of
an exchange of tactical nuclear weapons that
would not automatically lead to the United
States and Soviet Union firing strategic nuclear
weapons at each other.
Alarmed by the prospect of a nucfear battle
limited to Europe, and deeply suspicious to be
gin with of the Reagan administration's security
designs, some politicians and media in West
Germany, Britain and elsewhere in Europe in
terpreted the president's statements as a distor
tion of Western doctrine and a threat to Europe
an security.
Among the critics were members of Schmidt's
Social Democratic Party, increasingly divided
over alliance plans to deploy new U.S. medium
range nuclear missiles in western Europe.
