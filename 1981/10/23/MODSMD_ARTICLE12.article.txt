## The 						incomparable LSJUMB: marching band in name only 
### Daniel Labov 
In 1963, two separate but simultaneous
revolutions shook the music world. In that
year the Rolling Stones appeared to join the
Beatles and others in changing the face of
rock music. The second was precipitated by
the dismissal of Jules Schucat, then the
director of the Stanford Band.
To protest this, members of the Band went
on strike Thissoon resulted in the re
creation of the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) as a
totally student-run organization, and ended
the era of the traditional marching band at
Stanford.
To this day, the LSJUMB remains a
controversial and uniqueorganization.
Moreconventional bands continue to
receive the staid approval and support of
their alumni while the LSJUMB tends to elicit
far more wide ranging and impassioned
responses.
Each year, about 225 hopefuls audition for
the 144 openings in the Band. Although this
process is somewhat selective, it is rumored
that those die-hards who continuously show
up to try out can become a big enough
nuisance that they get in regardlessof other
factors.

Others are welcome to become 'ringers',
and so obtain their chance to play along with
the Band.
Practices are held three times a week for
about two hours. "Disco" Ray Gruenewald
heads a manging crew of about six or seven
who take credit for attempting to organize
Band members.
The Band's repertoire consists mostly of
rock music, and they boast of well over 500
tunes from artists like the Stones, The
Beatles, Steely Dan, The Police and The Who
Undoubtedly, what differentiates the
Stanford Band from all others is their
performing style. Though called a
"marching band," LSJUMB does not march,
they simply "scatter" from one formation to
the next.
As Drum Major Patty Rose pointed out,
the Band aims to entertain "an intellectually
aware audience. They have to understand
US."
This philosophy results in shows with
complex themes as well as those that are
merely absurd. Both appeal to our senses of
intelligence, humor, and music.
Practices tend not to be rigorous as the
entire operation is loosely organized.
Though this lax discipline may be

detrimental to synchronization, it serves as
the springboard for originality and
spontaneity — concerns closer to the heart
of the Band.
Gruenewald encapsulated his managerial
philosophy: "I hate to tell anyone what to
do. If people want to play music during
practice, that's fine. If they want to throw a
frisbee around, that's fine too."
It is important to the Band that while
behavior may lapse, the quality of music
does not. Admitting herarely gets serious,
Gruenewald claimed, "I only get frustrated
when the music's not right."
However, the true fiberof the Band is not
its music or organization, but rather the
mettle of its individuals. Students areoften
amazed at the actionsof Band membersand
want to know, "is all this craziness an act or
their way of life?" .
The Stanford Dollies, who work closely
with the Band, explained that the "off the
wall" stereotype doesn't fit many of the
members once they are apart from the
group. Dolly Mary Lee MacKichan
commented: "Yeah, they're wild, but when
you get 'em alone, they're really normal."
While being "off the wall" is not their way

of life, neither is it a mere act for the sake of
performance. Some Band members, like
Patty Rose, claim to "eat, drink, and smoke
band." Yet the majority are better
characterized as "weekend partyersafter
being grim and responsible students all
week, they can let go with the Band.
How do they like being so zany? The most
common reply is a simple, "We wouldn't be
this way if wedidn't like it!" Gruenewald
remarked, "We believe this is the natural
state of affairs."
While there are sporadic complaints
among Stanford students about the quality
of the music, most love their marching band.
For a freshman, rocking outwiththeßand
for the first time is a memorable experience.
After a touchdown, as they begin to strike
up "All Right Now" the Band's intense
enthusiasm becomes contagious, and a
powerful, almost tangible energy permeates
the atmosphere. After experiencing
LSJUMB, many feel that no other band is
capable of holding their interest. Even the
very talented, precise, finely tuned UCLA
marching band is usually greeted with chants
of "bor-ing" and the jingle of keys.
Interestingly, the LSJUMB holds no ill will

towards their more traditional rivals (with
the possible exception of USC). In fact, said
Rose, "Many Band members would have
enjoyed playing for other bands, although
not as much after having experienced
LSJUMB,"
The change of pace offered by the
Stanford Band makes the members generally
well received wherever they go and they
deny responsibility for antagonizing other
bands, said Rose.
Recently, the LSJUMB has been levelled
with charges of tastelessness and obscenity.
Band members feel these charges are
basically untrue and do not attach much
weight to them. What the Band does is only
in the interest of humor, most members say.
"The purpose of the Band is to be
entertaining, not obscene/'said
Gruenewald.
\Nhen asVrdit the UnivetVily
administration could censor them, Rose
conceded only, "Well, they could try, but
we're smart enough not to bring the walls
down on our heads."
The charges against the Band amount to
no more than common mud-slinging, said
Gruenewald. "They'll always find something
tocriticize if they want."

common reply is a simple, "We wouldn't be
this way if wedidn't like it!" Gruenewald
remarked, "We believe this is the natural
state of affairs."
While there are sporadic complaints
among Stanford students about the quality
of the music, most love their marching band.
For a freshman, rocking outwiththeßand
for the first time is a memorable experience.
After a touchdown, as they begin to strike
up "All Right Now" the Band's intense
enthusiasm becomes contagious, and a
powerful, almost tangible energy permeates
the atmosphere. After experiencing
LSJUMB, many feel that no other band is
capable of holding their interest. Even the
very talented, precise, finely tuned UCLA
marching band is usually greeted with chants
of "bor-ing" and the jingle of keys.
Interestingly, the LSJUMB holds no ill will

towards their more traditional rivals (with
the possible exception of USC). In fact, said
Rose, "Many Band members would have
enjoyed playing for other bands, although
not as much after having experienced
LSJUMB,"
The change of pace offered by the
Stanford Band makes the members generally
well received wherever they go and they
deny responsibility for antagonizing other
bands, said Rose.
Recently, the LSJUMB has been levelled
with charges of tastelessness and obscenity.
Band members feel these charges are
basically untrue and do not attach much
weight to them. What the Band does is only
in the interest of humor, most members say.
"The purpose of the Band is to be
entertaining, not obscene/'said
Gruenewald.
\Nhen asVrdit the UnivetVily
administration could censor them, Rose
conceded only, "Well, they could try, but
we're smart enough not to bring the walls
down on our heads."
The charges against the Band amount to
no more than common mud-slinging, said
Gruenewald. "They'll always find something
tocriticize if they want."


In 1963, two separate but simultaneous
revolutions shook the music world. In that
year the Rolling Stones appeared to join the
Beatles and others in changing the face of
rock music. The second was precipitated by
the dismissal of Jules Schucat, then the
director of the Stanford Band.
To protest this, members of the Band went
on strike Thissoon resulted in the re
creation of the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) as a
totally student-run organization, and ended
the era of the traditional marching band at
Stanford.
To this day, the LSJUMB remains a
controversial and uniqueorganization.
Moreconventional bands continue to
receive the staid approval and support of
their alumni while the LSJUMB tends to elicit
far more wide ranging and impassioned
responses.
Each year, about 225 hopefuls audition for
the 144 openings in the Band. Although this
process is somewhat selective, it is rumored
that those die-hards who continuously show
up to try out can become a big enough
nuisance that they get in regardlessof other
factors.

Others are welcome to become 'ringers',
and so obtain their chance to play along with
the Band.
Practices are held three times a week for
about two hours. "Disco" Ray Gruenewald
heads a manging crew of about six or seven
who take credit for attempting to organize
Band members.
The Band's repertoire consists mostly of
rock music, and they boast of well over 500
tunes from artists like the Stones, The
Beatles, Steely Dan, The Police and The Who
Undoubtedly, what differentiates the
Stanford Band from all others is their
performing style. Though called a
"marching band," LSJUMB does not march,
they simply "scatter" from one formation to
the next.
As Drum Major Patty Rose pointed out,
the Band aims to entertain "an intellectually
aware audience. They have to understand
US."
This philosophy results in shows with
complex themes as well as those that are
merely absurd. Both appeal to our senses of
intelligence, humor, and music.
Practices tend not to be rigorous as the
entire operation is loosely organized.
Though this lax discipline may be

detrimental to synchronization, it serves as
the springboard for originality and
spontaneity — concerns closer to the heart
of the Band.
Gruenewald encapsulated his managerial
philosophy: "I hate to tell anyone what to
do. If people want to play music during
practice, that's fine. If they want to throw a
frisbee around, that's fine too."
It is important to the Band that while
behavior may lapse, the quality of music
does not. Admitting herarely gets serious,
Gruenewald claimed, "I only get frustrated
when the music's not right."
However, the true fiberof the Band is not
its music or organization, but rather the
mettle of its individuals. Students areoften
amazed at the actionsof Band membersand
want to know, "is all this craziness an act or
their way of life?" .
The Stanford Dollies, who work closely
with the Band, explained that the "off the
wall" stereotype doesn't fit many of the
members once they are apart from the
group. Dolly Mary Lee MacKichan
commented: "Yeah, they're wild, but when
you get 'em alone, they're really normal."
While being "off the wall" is not their way

of life, neither is it a mere act for the sake of
performance. Some Band members, like
Patty Rose, claim to "eat, drink, and smoke
band." Yet the majority are better
characterized as "weekend partyersafter
being grim and responsible students all
week, they can let go with the Band.
