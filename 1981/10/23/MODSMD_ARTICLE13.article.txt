# Roommate pairing more complex than a matter of height
## 
### Leon Dayan 
After living with someone
who was a total stranger only
three weeks ago, freshmen
may now be asking, "How did
they know how to pair me with
someone who would be such a
close friend?" Or, "Who is this
total stranger who lives on the
other side of the room and
what kind of bizarre experi
ment in diversity are they
trying to perform now?"
Typically freshman room
mates "get along well" but are
not "intimate friends," and this
is what the Office of Students
Affairs expects when freshman
housing assignments are com
pleted.
"Our general philosophy,"
said Anne Coxon, who coordi
nates freshmen assignments,
"is to try to match people who
will be harmonious, com
patible, and intellectually stim
ulating. We are not matching
best friends."
When freshman Sue Mun
caster of Branner Hall was
asked how she thought her
roommates were chosen, she
immediately replied,
"Height!" She herself is six feet

tall and her roommates are five
feet nine inches and five feet 10
inches. Others thought they
were picked out of a hat, or
chosen from the pictures sent
this summer.
Freshmen are often told by
resident assistants (R.A.'s) or
academic advisors that the
"height method" was used to
match roommates, but accord
ing to Coxon, "It's a rumor that
seems to be dying a slow
death."
Mike O'Reilly, an R.A. at
Larkin who did the actual pair
ing in 1980, explained, "Many
times people active in sports
will be roomed together, and
they are generally taller than
average."
Coxon coordinates the pair
ing process each summer, but
two former or current Stanford
students make the specific as
signments. This year these stu
dents were Karen Askey and
Greg Otte.
The coordinator's office first
breaks down the incoming
class into academic prefer
ence, geographical distribu
tion, and rural or urban back
ground. Each house then re

ceives about the same per
centage of groups, to make
them representative of the en
tire class. Afterthisstep,assign
ing takes place.
O'Reilly called the method
of assigning "enlightened ran
domness." Each person is first
roomed with someone from
another state and with a dif
ferent main academic interest.
"We try not to put two pre
meds or two engineering stu
dents together because of pos
sible competition," explained
Coxon.
Outside of academic interest
and geography, similarities are
desired. Those with some com
mon extracurricularactivity are
paired if possible.
O'Reilly said he gives musi
cal taste a high priority. "Two
strangers can suddenly feel to
tally at ease with one another
when both of them find out
they like The Pretenders," he
said.
The assigners use informa
tion from a white card asking
for general information. Cox
on said that the card is kept
small and unspecific so as not
to "raise expectations of a

perfect roommate." Coxon
added that the picture is not
used.
Even with the limited in
formation he had, O'Reilly said
that in rare cases, "I got the
feeling that the two would be
best friends for life."
When asked independently
how they would describe their
roommates, Terry Weissman
and Kirk Sanders of Arroyo
House, replied respectively,
"unbearably neat" and "in
credibly sloppy."
Weissman pointed out that
they do like the same kind of
music, but "it doesn't really
matter because although he
brought his stereo, he brought
no speakers."
Despite their differences,
the two get along "all right."
Said Sanders: "Seeing a mess
doesn't bother me, dealing
with it does."
If Karen Dustin, Jenny King,

and Marcia Diaz of Branner
Hall could use only one adjec
tive to describe their rela
tionship, it would be "jovial."
"At first we weren't open with
each other. We were trying to
be considerate. But now we
tease each other a little and get
along much better," said one.
The three don't usually do
things together socially, but
they believe that "makes it bet
ter for us when we're in the
room."
Ina Roy and Eileen Jensen of
Otero House are "not just
roommates, but also good
friends." Roy said that al
though the two both like
creative writing and fantasy, it
is not the "surface things" that
bring them together. "Our
morals, thoughts, and ideas are
a lot alike," she said.
"We are more than con
siderate — we keep each other
company, we go places togeth

er, and we cheer each other up
if one of us depressed,"said
Roy.
Interestingly, Roy left the in
formation card blank except
for requesting a non-smoking
roommate, while Jensen filled
it out extensively.
According to O'Reilly, ex
amples of roommates who can
not get along at all are rare. "I
haven't received any death
threats, but I get a lot of con
gratulations," he said.
"When roommates do have
a major conflict," said Norm
Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for residential
education, "first the R.A.'s try
to settle the problem. If they
can't, the Resident Fellows will
talk to the students, and in ex
treme cases possibly draw up a
written contract for the two to
abide by."
"One rule we try to stick to is
that freshman roommates may

not change. If the situation isir
reconciliable, a change may
occur, but that happens less
than once a year," said Rob
inson.
O'Reilly believes that the
"no switching" rule is good,
because he and his freshman
roommate wanted to switch,
but were not allowed. "It was a
learning experience, and now
the two of us are very good
friends," he said. "Most people
who want to change don't do
so because of any fundamental
conflict, but for superficial rea
sons like mannerisms, the way
the person talks, or where he is
from."
O'Reilly credited the success
of Stanford's system to the stu
dents. "Stanford students are
willing to get along, which
makes it easy for those of us
who do the assigning. It's hard
to make a big mistake."

because he and his freshman
roommate wanted to switch,
but were not allowed. "It was a
learning experience, and now
the two of us are very good
friends," he said. "Most people
who want to change don't do
so because of any fundamental
conflict, but for superficial rea
sons like mannerisms, the way
the person talks, or where he is
from."
O'Reilly credited the success
of Stanford's system to the stu
dents. "Stanford students are
willing to get along, which
makes it easy for those of us
who do the assigning. It's hard
to make a big mistake."
After living with someone
who was a total stranger only
three weeks ago, freshmen
may now be asking, "How did
they know how to pair me with
someone who would be such a
close friend?" Or, "Who is this
total stranger who lives on the
other side of the room and
what kind of bizarre experi
ment in diversity are they
trying to perform now?"
Typically freshman room
mates "get along well" but are
not "intimate friends," and this
is what the Office of Students
Affairs expects when freshman
housing assignments are com
pleted.
"Our general philosophy,"
said Anne Coxon, who coordi
nates freshmen assignments,
"is to try to match people who
will be harmonious, com
patible, and intellectually stim
ulating. We are not matching
best friends."
When freshman Sue Mun
caster of Branner Hall was
asked how she thought her
roommates were chosen, she
immediately replied,
"Height!" She herself is six feet

tall and her roommates are five
feet nine inches and five feet 10
inches. Others thought they
were picked out of a hat, or
chosen from the pictures sent
this summer.
Freshmen are often told by
resident assistants (R.A.'s) or
academic advisors that the
"height method" was used to
match roommates, but accord
ing to Coxon, "It's a rumor that
seems to be dying a slow
death."
Mike O'Reilly, an R.A. at
Larkin who did the actual pair
ing in 1980, explained, "Many
times people active in sports
will be roomed together, and
they are generally taller than
average."
Coxon coordinates the pair
ing process each summer, but
two former or current Stanford
students make the specific as
signments. This year these stu
dents were Karen Askey and
Greg Otte.
The coordinator's office first
breaks down the incoming
class into academic prefer
ence, geographical distribu
tion, and rural or urban back
ground. Each house then re

ceives about the same per
centage of groups, to make
them representative of the en
tire class. Afterthisstep,assign
ing takes place.
O'Reilly called the method
of assigning "enlightened ran
domness." Each person is first
roomed with someone from
another state and with a dif
ferent main academic interest.
"We try not to put two pre
meds or two engineering stu
dents together because of pos
sible competition," explained
Coxon.
Outside of academic interest
and geography, similarities are
desired. Those with some com
mon extracurricularactivity are
paired if possible.
O'Reilly said he gives musi
cal taste a high priority. "Two
strangers can suddenly feel to
tally at ease with one another
when both of them find out
they like The Pretenders," he
said.
The assigners use informa
tion from a white card asking
for general information. Cox
on said that the card is kept
small and unspecific so as not
to "raise expectations of a

perfect roommate." Coxon
added that the picture is not
used.
Even with the limited in
formation he had, O'Reilly said
that in rare cases, "I got the
feeling that the two would be
best friends for life."
When asked independently
how they would describe their
roommates, Terry Weissman
and Kirk Sanders of Arroyo
House, replied respectively,
"unbearably neat" and "in
credibly sloppy."
Weissman pointed out that
they do like the same kind of
music, but "it doesn't really
matter because although he
brought his stereo, he brought
no speakers."
Despite their differences,
the two get along "all right."
Said Sanders: "Seeing a mess
doesn't bother me, dealing
with it does."
If Karen Dustin, Jenny King,

and Marcia Diaz of Branner
Hall could use only one adjec
tive to describe their rela
tionship, it would be "jovial."
"At first we weren't open with
each other. We were trying to
be considerate. But now we
tease each other a little and get
along much better," said one.
The three don't usually do
things together socially, but
they believe that "makes it bet
ter for us when we're in the
room."
Ina Roy and Eileen Jensen of
Otero House are "not just
roommates, but also good
friends." Roy said that al
though the two both like
creative writing and fantasy, it
is not the "surface things" that
bring them together. "Our
morals, thoughts, and ideas are
a lot alike," she said.
"We are more than con
siderate — we keep each other
company, we go places togeth

er, and we cheer each other up
if one of us depressed,"said
Roy.
Interestingly, Roy left the in
formation card blank except
for requesting a non-smoking
roommate, while Jensen filled
it out extensively.
According to O'Reilly, ex
amples of roommates who can
not get along at all are rare. "I
haven't received any death
threats, but I get a lot of con
gratulations," he said.
"When roommates do have
a major conflict," said Norm
Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for residential
education, "first the R.A.'s try
to settle the problem. If they
can't, the Resident Fellows will
talk to the students, and in ex
treme cases possibly draw up a
written contract for the two to
abide by."
"One rule we try to stick to is
that freshman roommates may

not change. If the situation isir
reconciliable, a change may
occur, but that happens less
than once a year," said Rob
inson.
O'Reilly believes that the
"no switching" rule is good,
because he and his freshman
roommate wanted to switch,
but were not allowed. "It was a

a major conflict," said Norm
Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for residential
education, "first the R.A.'s try
to settle the problem. If they
can't, the Resident Fellows will
talk to the students, and in ex
treme cases possibly draw up a
written contract for the two to
abide by."
"One rule we try to stick to is
that freshman roommates may

not change. If the situation isir
reconciliable, a change may
occur, but that happens less
than once a year," said Rob
inson.
O'Reilly believes that the
"no switching" rule is good,
because he and his freshman
roommate wanted to switch,
but were not allowed. "It was a
learning experience, and now
the two of us are very good
friends," he said. "Most people
who want to change don't do
so because of any fundamental
conflict, but for superficial rea
sons like mannerisms, the way
the person talks, or where he is
from."
O'Reilly credited the success
of Stanford's system to the stu
dents. "Stanford students are
willing to get along, which
makes it easy for those of us
who do the assigning. It's hard
to make a big mistake."
