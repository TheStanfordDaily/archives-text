## Gary Ferries Quad jam fails commonsense 
### 
Left to itself, a system tends to be
come more and more disordered.
This occurs because randomness is
the natural order of things in the uni
verse. For a perfect demonstration of
this concept, one has only to visit the
Quad around, say, 11 a.m. on any
weekday. Better yet, imagine the
lurid spectacle as seen from the air,
perhaps by an over-eager Medfly pi
lot practicing for the night to come:
Like wheat shot from guns, teem
ing masses of humanity explodefrom
open doors as classes end. Some
pause to reclaim their bicycles, oth
ers proceed directly to join their
peers already on the paths and side
walks of the Farm. Bicyclists weave in
and out between the pedestrians,
avoiding collisions through skill, dar
ing, and a good measure of blind
luck. Others fall by the wayside, their
luck exhausted. At intersections, pe
destrians smoke one last cigarette,
then, bravely refusing a blindfold,
wade out into the crossfire. From
above, this riot of colors, machines,
animals and humanity resembles an
MCM aquatic ballet gone mad.
Yes, getting from point A to point B
at Stanford can be a harrowing ex
perience. Widespread indifference
to traffic laws and a lack of simple
common sense have combined to
create a traffic situation which is an
anarchist's dream. Often a simple
journey between buildings becomes
a complicated expedition asonecon
fronts a disorienting variety of ob
stacles, including mail trucks, bi
cycles, dogs, Porsches and unyield
ing cliques of pedestrians. Woe to
the unitiated novice who still be
lieves that the best way to get from
point A to point B isa straight line. He
will quickly learn that the best way to
get to point B is along any path which
gets him there in one piece, no mat
ter how convoluted that path may be.

Whenever a large number of peo
ple must travel a short distance in a
relatively short period of time, a cer
tain number of problems can be ex
pected. To minimize these problems,
civilized societies have created rules
and conventions which impose order
on traffic flow. Vet, there have always
been those who felt that they were
above the law, and ignored this traf
fic code. Stanford in the 80s is no ex
ception.
A stop sign means just that, "stop."
It does not mean "pause,"
"hesitate," "go right on through if
you're not in a car," or "have a nice
day." Also, contrary to popular be
lief, at an intersection with a four
way stop, it is the order of arrival
which uniquely determines the or
der of departure. The sticker prices
of the vehicles involved do not, re
peat not, have anything to do with it.
These two laws are wantonly ignored
as people cruise the campus. While it
is admittedly inconvenient for a
cyclist to stop at every stop sign, the
argument for doing so (or at least
yielding) is rather compelling. Quite
simply, a 2500-pound vehicle moving
at 25 mph packs quite a wallop com
pared to a 200-pound one moving at
7 mph. Skeptics may verify this by ask
ing any physics T.A.
Motorized vehicles are difficult
enough to deal with on the street,
but when certain privileged vehicles
are allowed to operate in restricted
areas, all hell breaks loose. To il
lustrate this, think about the last time
you were almost hit by a speeding
mail truck. Your years here will prob
ably be the last time in your whole
life that you associate "speed" with
"U.S. mail."
While traffic laws don't apply when
one gets onto the plazas and side
walks at the heart of the campus,
common sense still does. Un

fortunately, common sense, like
common courtesy, often isn't com
mon at all. Whether one sees it from
the viewpoint of a bicyclist wending
his way through aimlessly wandering
pedestrians, or as a pedestrian weav
ing in between unpredictable bicy
clists, some of the problems are ob
vious.
There is a potential problem every
time a bicyclist and a pedestrian, or
any combination thereof, cross
paths. Generally, this contest of wills
is decided by intimidation. The in
timidator continues on his way unim
peded, while the intimidated one
performs evasive action. Thus, get
ting around the Farm is like an
enormously complicated game of
"chicken."
While liable to offend those whose
concept of "turf" arises from "West
Side Story," there are two common
sense rules which would, if followed,
noticeably improve the sidewalk sit
uation. The first is that bicyclists
should slow down when entering a
heavily congested area. This would
give everyone more time to avoid
collisions. Secondly, pedestrians
traveling in large groups should do so
in such a manner so as to not pose an
insurmountable obstruction to traf
fic. This means that five people
should not walk five abreast on a nar
row sidewalk. This is easier for some
of us than for others.
Until someone invents a tele
portation device which will enable
one to travel three-fifths of a mile in
10 seconds, travel in crowded areas
will continue to be difficult. None
theless, it needn't be impossible.
Self-regulation is not just a part of the
hallowed Fundamental Standard, it is
part of being an adult.

concept of "turf" arises from "West
Side Story," there are two common
sense rules which would, if followed,
noticeably improve the sidewalk sit
uation. The first is that bicyclists
should slow down when entering a
heavily congested area. This would
give everyone more time to avoid
collisions. Secondly, pedestrians
traveling in large groups should do so
in such a manner so as to not pose an
insurmountable obstruction to traf
fic. This means that five people
should not walk five abreast on a nar
row sidewalk. This is easier for some
of us than for others.
Until someone invents a tele
portation device which will enable
one to travel three-fifths of a mile in
10 seconds, travel in crowded areas
will continue to be difficult. None

Self-regulation is not just a part of the

Left to itself, a system tends to be
come more and more disordered.
This occurs because randomness is
the natural order of things in the uni
verse. For a perfect demonstration of
this concept, one has only to visit the
Quad around, say, 11 a.m. on any
weekday. Better yet, imagine the
lurid spectacle as seen from the air,
perhaps by an over-eager Medfly pi
lot practicing for the night to come:
Like wheat shot from guns, teem
ing masses of humanity explodefrom
open doors as classes end. Some
pause to reclaim their bicycles, oth
ers proceed directly to join their
peers already on the paths and side
walks of the Farm. Bicyclists weave in
and out between the pedestrians,
avoiding collisions through skill, dar
ing, and a good measure of blind
luck. Others fall by the wayside, their
luck exhausted. At intersections, pe
destrians smoke one last cigarette,
then, bravely refusing a blindfold,
wade out into the crossfire. From
above, this riot of colors, machines,
animals and humanity resembles an
MCM aquatic ballet gone mad.
Yes, getting from point A to point B
at Stanford can be a harrowing ex
perience. Widespread indifference
to traffic laws and a lack of simple
common sense have combined to
create a traffic situation which is an
anarchist's dream. Often a simple
journey between buildings becomes
a complicated expedition asonecon
fronts a disorienting variety of ob
stacles, including mail trucks, bi
cycles, dogs, Porsches and unyield
ing cliques of pedestrians. Woe to
the unitiated novice who still be
lieves that the best way to get from
point A to point B isa straight line. He
will quickly learn that the best way to
get to point B is along any path which
gets him there in one piece, no mat
ter how convoluted that path may be.

Whenever a large number of peo
ple must travel a short distance in a
relatively short period of time, a cer
tain number of problems can be ex
pected. To minimize these problems,
civilized societies have created rules
and conventions which impose order
on traffic flow. Vet, there have always
been those who felt that they were
above the law, and ignored this traf
fic code. Stanford in the 80s is no ex
ception.
A stop sign means just that, "stop."
It does not mean "pause,"
"hesitate," "go right on through if
you're not in a car," or "have a nice
day." Also, contrary to popular be
lief, at an intersection with a four
way stop, it is the order of arrival
which uniquely determines the or
der of departure. The sticker prices
of the vehicles involved do not, re
peat not, have anything to do with it.
These two laws are wantonly ignored
as people cruise the campus. While it
is admittedly inconvenient for a
cyclist to stop at every stop sign, the
argument for doing so (or at least
yielding) is rather compelling. Quite
simply, a 2500-pound vehicle moving
at 25 mph packs quite a wallop com
pared to a 200-pound one moving at
7 mph. Skeptics may verify this by ask
ing any physics T.A.
Motorized vehicles are difficult
enough to deal with on the street,
but when certain privileged vehicles
are allowed to operate in restricted
areas, all hell breaks loose. To il
lustrate this, think about the last time
you were almost hit by a speeding
mail truck. Your years here will prob
ably be the last time in your whole
life that you associate "speed" with
"U.S. mail."
While traffic laws don't apply when
one gets onto the plazas and side
walks at the heart of the campus,
common sense still does. Un

fortunately, common sense, like
common courtesy, often isn't com
mon at all. Whether one sees it from
the viewpoint of a bicyclist wending
his way through aimlessly wandering
pedestrians, or as a pedestrian weav
ing in between unpredictable bicy
clists, some of the problems are ob
vious.
There is a potential problem every
time a bicyclist and a pedestrian, or
any combination thereof, cross
paths. Generally, this contest of wills
is decided by intimidation. The in
timidator continues on his way unim
peded, while the intimidated one
performs evasive action. Thus, get
ting around the Farm is like an
enormously complicated game of
"chicken."
