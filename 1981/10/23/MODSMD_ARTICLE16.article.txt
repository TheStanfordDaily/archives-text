## Measure B ensures fairness 
### 
Thank you for the informative arti
cle on Measure B (Daily, Oct. 15),
which would prohibit discrimination
based on sexual orientation. I'm writ
ing in response to an argument of
fered against the measure by Palo
Alto City Council member Anne
Witherspoon, who complains that,
"A person could be trapped by the
terms of the ordinance into an unin
tentional and unknowing discrimina
tion."
I thfnk that "unintentional dis
crimination" is a contradiction in
terms. Discrimination by itself im
plies a conscious choice. To dis
criminate against someone on the
basis of sexual orientation, you
would first have to form some idea of
that person's sexual orientation. Ac
cidental or inadvertent discrimina
tion by an individual is simply im
possible.

The sorts of "accidental dis
crimination" that the measure pro
hibits are those that result from poli
cies. A policy could have the effect of
discriminating based on sexual orien
tation, without being designed or in
tended to do so. For example, con
sider an apartment complex where
only married couples could rent a
one-bedroom apartment. Though
not necessarily intended to dis
criminate, the policy would havethat
effect. Or imagine a job for which
only married applicants were going
to be considered. Policies like these
are what Measure B is getting at. They
would be prohibited by the or
dinance.
Measure B will not trap persons
into unwitting violations of the law,
but the measure will help to ensure
that sexual orientation will no longer
be an issue when it comes to jobs,
housing and doing business in Palo

Alto. I think it deserves our en
thusiastic support.

Who really cares?
It is a great pity that so many of the
articles that appear in the Daily are of
such limited, parochial interest. Very
few people, for instance, can be seri
ously interested in whether or not
Phi Delta Theta publishes a calendar
or not, or in what the calendar con
tains. The quality of international
news coverage has improved a great
deal in the last two years, but the Dai
ly has yet to emerge as a forum of de
bate. Stanford students and faculty
are diverse and able. Why is it that
they do not have more to say about
ideas or important issues or how we
might improve the worlds
