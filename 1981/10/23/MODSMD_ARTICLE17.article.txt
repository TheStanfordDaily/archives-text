## Proud, white America must rid country of racist attitudes 
### 
Who is proud of being white?
I am. Now hold it. Don't jump to con
clusions until you have read what I have to
say.
It is a shame that we, as human beings,
have labeled ourselves as such; however,
yes, I am proud to be white, because that is
what I am. That is what I will forever remain.
That is what Cod has given me and that is
what I must deal with. Yet there is a blemish
on that pride, for what I stand for has been,
as a whole, as large a detriment to world
well-being as everything else combined.
Now, that is not too much to be proud of, is
it?
There are barriers set up all about and we
all have been responsible for their construc
tion — white, black, whoever. Great people
of our recent past have tried to open doors
through those barriers, so that we may enter
into either side, freely. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. did not open doors leading to
pathways of world peace only to have them
reclosed. No, he opened them so that we all
may walk through, and in turn, open future
doors for our followers (that is, if they sur
vive). The doors King opened deserve per

manence, and it is up to all of us to fight to
keep them open.
We, as Caucasians, can start among
ourselves to break barriers. It is not the black
man's responsibility to defend himself from
and attack the continuous onslaught of the
KKK and the like. You wouldn't reprimand
your neighbor's child, would you? Likely
not, because that would not be your job.
Consider this, white America: the KKK are
our children, and it is our responsibility to
either set them straight or snuff them out en
tirely.
Equal status for blacks, Chicanos, and all
minorities has been sought long enough.
Isn't it about time that we realize, as Dr. King
himself said, addressing a white audience,
that our true freedom is "inextricably bound
to the final freedoms of all minorities?" For
the moment, how can we allow ourselves to
be called free? Free from what? Free from
the burden we carry knowing that at least 26
black youths in Atlanta have been
murdered, due to that dreadful overhang of
racism?
You might ask, "With things as such, how
could you possibly be proud of being

white?" Answer: that's a good question. As 1
said before, there is a large blemish on that
pride. However, a self-love is very important.
If you do not start the breaking of barriers
within yourself, how can you possibly begin
breaking barriers around you? Said Prof.
Irwin Brown of Stanford's Psychology De
partment last January at the celebration of
King's birthday, "Find that love within your
self, first, so you'll mean it when you ap
proach your neighbor."
He then proceeded tosuggest we take that
love into our families, our household, and
watch that love grow within those to whom
you are closest, for they are but an extension
of you. Only then, once it has spread among
your kin, should you feel as if others should
hear, feel and touch what you so proudly
and profoundly feel in your soul toward
yourself and your family. Take it to your
neighbor, then, and once your street has
been secured, to your community. Do so by
your voice, your hands, your mind, your
heart, your love. And don't stop there, by no
means, don't stop there. Your city's people,
your country, and finally this world, our
earth, with so many walks of beautiful life, all

human, all different, unity and diversity un
der one sky, call for love — your love. The
progression is endless and continues to the
outermost parts of the universe, and don't
think it doesn't, because it does.
Idealistic? Yes. However, Brown was right
on another point that love can also move us
in a realistic manner: "We must start in our
own backyards," he says. Literally speaking,
here at Stanford, that includes the entire
world, for we are fortunate to have such an
international student body. However, let's
get back to the states, our most immediate
backyard. What could this intangible notion
called love possibly do to thwart the utter
absurdity of racial problems that continue to
exist in this country? Well for one, with
enough pressure, a firm voice, a firm hand
and an educated community bound by com
mitments to equality, we could get this Rea
gan administration to reverse its priorities to
where human rights are first (where they
should be), and not fourth or fifth down the
ladder.
Impossible? Hardly. With sufficient pres
sure the government has acted before. I
seem to recall in the not-so-distant past a so

cial-conscious group who was sytematically
and thoroughly dismantled by various CIA
plots. I do not know how dangerous this
group actually was, though I do know they
were armed. But so are many others. This
group's motives for continued existence
were near sacred: feed the poor, strive for
absolute equality and elevate themselves
into a position of respect. Hardly motives to
deserve being demolished. This group called
themselves the Black Panthers.
If our government could do $uch a thing
then, then there should be no question as to
what should be done to groups such as the
para-military "Christians" of the northern
Midwest, or the KKK, who have spread their
disease into every healthy corner of this
country. With groups as these, continuing to
do nothing but to create conflict, to disrupt,
to destroy, and to divide our inborn nature
of human love, and with no redeeming
motives or merit whatsoever, there is really
only one answer:
White America . . . let's keep our pride,
spank our children, and hope that further
doors may someday be opened.

partment last January at the celebration of
King's birthday, "Find that love within your
self, first, so you'll mean it when you ap
proach your neighbor."
He then proceeded tosuggest we take that
love into our families, our household, and
watch that love grow within those to whom
you are closest, for they are but an extension
of you. Only then, once it has spread among
your kin, should you feel as if others should
hear, feel and touch what you so proudly
and profoundly feel in your soul toward
yourself and your family. Take it to your
neighbor, then, and once your street has
been secured, to your community. Do so by
your voice, your hands, your mind, your
heart, your love. And don't stop there, by no
means, don't stop there. Your city's people,
your country, and finally this world, our
earth, with so many walks of beautiful life, all

human, all different, unity and diversity un
der one sky, call for love — your love. The
progression is endless and continues to the
outermost parts of the universe, and don't
think it doesn't, because it does.
Idealistic? Yes. However, Brown was right
on another point that love can also move us
in a realistic manner: "We must start in our
own backyards," he says. Literally speaking,
here at Stanford, that includes the entire
world, for we are fortunate to have such an
international student body. However, let's
get back to the states, our most immediate
backyard. What could this intangible notion
called love possibly do to thwart the utter
absurdity of racial problems that continue to
exist in this country? Well for one, with
enough pressure, a firm voice, a firm hand
and an educated community bound by com
mitments to equality, we could get this Rea
gan administration to reverse its priorities to
where human rights are first (where they
should be), and not fourth or fifth down the
ladder.
Impossible? Hardly. With sufficient pres
sure the government has acted before. I
seem to recall in the not-so-distant past a so

cial-conscious group who was sytematically
and thoroughly dismantled by various CIA
plots. I do not know how dangerous this
group actually was, though I do know they
were armed. But so are many others. This
group's motives for continued existence
were near sacred: feed the poor, strive for
absolute equality and elevate themselves
into a position of respect. Hardly motives to
deserve being demolished. This group called
themselves the Black Panthers.
If our government could do $uch a thing
then, then there should be no question as to
what should be done to groups such as the
para-military "Christians" of the northern
Midwest, or the KKK, who have spread their
disease into every healthy corner of this
country. With groups as these, continuing to
do nothing but to create conflict, to disrupt,
to destroy, and to divide our inborn nature
of human love, and with no redeeming
motives or merit whatsoever, there is really
only one answer:
White America . . . let's keep our pride,
spank our children, and hope that further
doors may someday be opened.
(Roger Lang is a senior majoring in an
thropology.)
Who is proud of being white?
I am. Now hold it. Don't jump to con
clusions until you have read what I have to
say.
It is a shame that we, as human beings,
have labeled ourselves as such; however,
yes, I am proud to be white, because that is
what I am. That is what I will forever remain.
That is what Cod has given me and that is
what I must deal with. Yet there is a blemish
on that pride, for what I stand for has been,
as a whole, as large a detriment to world
well-being as everything else combined.
Now, that is not too much to be proud of, is
it?
There are barriers set up all about and we
all have been responsible for their construc
tion — white, black, whoever. Great people
of our recent past have tried to open doors
through those barriers, so that we may enter
into either side, freely. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. did not open doors leading to
pathways of world peace only to have them
reclosed. No, he opened them so that we all
may walk through, and in turn, open future
doors for our followers (that is, if they sur
vive). The doors King opened deserve per

manence, and it is up to all of us to fight to
keep them open.
We, as Caucasians, can start among
ourselves to break barriers. It is not the black
man's responsibility to defend himself from
and attack the continuous onslaught of the
KKK and the like. You wouldn't reprimand
your neighbor's child, would you? Likely
not, because that would not be your job.
Consider this, white America: the KKK are
our children, and it is our responsibility to
either set them straight or snuff them out en
tirely.
Equal status for blacks, Chicanos, and all
minorities has been sought long enough.
Isn't it about time that we realize, as Dr. King
himself said, addressing a white audience,
that our true freedom is "inextricably bound
to the final freedoms of all minorities?" For
the moment, how can we allow ourselves to
be called free? Free from what? Free from
the burden we carry knowing that at least 26
black youths in Atlanta have been
murdered, due to that dreadful overhang of
racism?
You might ask, "With things as such, how
could you possibly be proud of being

white?" Answer: that's a good question. As 1
said before, there is a large blemish on that
pride. However, a self-love is very important.
If you do not start the breaking of barriers
within yourself, how can you possibly begin
breaking barriers around you? Said Prof.
