## Americans justify actions too often 
### 
and past trends. In Jerry Wertheim's
column "Only 'just wars' merit par
ticipation" (Daily, Oct. 19), he ex
presses more than simply his person
al viewpoint. He is expressing the
tone of a society preparing itself for
the worst.
It seems that the closer a nation
comes to confrontation, the more it
justifies that confrontation. Recall
public opinion before World War 11.
Americans were willing to send arms
to Europe, but not fight their war.
However, as time passed, public
opinion was changed, in part by the
appearance of articles such as
Wertheim's. America could not

avoid the confrontation, and thus the
citizens were, in effect, giving them
selves a "pep talk" via communica
tion media.
Anger over the useless waste of the
Vietnam "police action" situation
now seems muted by the realization
of the seriousness of Mideast, African
and European confronatations. Some
feared the death of Sadat would re
sult in an end to the Camp David ac
cords. Ironically, the Reagan admin
istration vowed to keep the peace by
threatening military actions against
all aggressors, such as Libya. We want
peace, and we're willing to kill for it.

Another front, that of nuclear
arms, merits discussion. At one time
America at war. Once again, it is a
definite possibility in light of current
nuclear war was viewed by all as un
winnable. However, this does not ap
pear to be the case, according to re
cent articles. If we make ourselves
believe the Soviets think they can win
a nuclear confrontation, naturally we
must make ourselves belive we can
meet this threat. Thus, we too begin
to think with a "winning" mentality.
A war in Europe likewise has been
an accepted possibility by Ameri
cans. Though we don't want to fight
on our own land, we've come to ac
cept foreign soil as an adequate bat
tleground. Of course, to protect our
allies, we need advanced battlefield
equipment. Thus we build newer and
better tanks, planes, nuclear missiles

and neutron bombs and store them
on foreign soil so that we can fend off
any attack — and win. It all sounds
quite simple. Obviously, it's not; but
our justification is there once we de
cide that we are a defensive force,
and that all we do is for our own, right
cause.
The modern trend is to justify our
actions instead of debatingtheirmer
it. Arms sales, threats, believing in
worthwhile wars, justification of mili
tary presence — all illustrate a for
ward trend that, like those of the
past, shows no sign of stopping until a
victor is determined by whatever
means necessary. This is not a very
bright picture, but it is one we are
forcing ourselves to understand and
live with.
