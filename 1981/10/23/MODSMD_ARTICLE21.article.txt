# Velvet and wigs, anyone?

### Heather Millar 
Halloween night. Costume shop owner
Len Hanson's front porch is dark. Suddenly,
the porch light flashes on and a bloody spec
tre confronts a group of trick-or-treaters that
have just started up the walk. Blood oozes
from the base of the bladeless knife in the
spectre's chest, and its powdered face looks
deathly pale. Shrieking, the children retreat.
The monster sprays warm water "blood" after
the group, and once again the porch is dark.
"If you have your own ideas," said Hanson,
who owns the "House of Humor" novelty
and costume shop in Mountain View, "you
can do a lot with costumes." Hanson
portrayed a hunchback so well one year that
neighbors almost called the police to report a
suspicious-looking character loitering
around the neighborhood.
This Halloween, trick-or-treat<?rs may be
sporting anything from a watermelon outfit
to a Carmen Miranda dress to a two-man pur
ple cow outfit with a snap-on udder — all
available in the Stanford area's costume
shops.
Costume shop owners says that so far, this
year gorillas are the most popular costumes
for men, and Playboy bunny outfits most
popular for women. Rubber chickens are also
in large demand — Hanson has sold as many
as six dozen in a single Halloween season.
"Women either want to be funny, sexy, or
beautiful," said Elaine Rupe, who works at
the "Characters" costume shop in Palo Alto.
One woman, Rupe remembers, tried to be

all three and bought a bright green clown wig
to go with her full-length formal.
Another customer bought a topless false
front and wore it the whole time she was in
the store. "I think she would have worn it
home, too," said Rupe, "but a friend who was
with with her convinced her not to."
According to Rupe, men seem more con
servative than women in their costume
choice. "They don't seem to want to dress up
as much," she said.
Alyce Balfor, chairperson of the "Costume
Bank" in Los Altos, has found that men often
rent Musketeer and Renaissance costumes
made of velvet and brocade, and trimmed
with sequins or braid. "Suites of Maille" —
doubletsof soda-can tabs crocheted together
with silver yarn — are also popular.
This year '20s and '30s styles have caught
the public's imagination, Balfor said. "Wom
en enjoy wearing flapper dresses and the soft
pastel, Gatsby 'dream girl' dresses," she said.
Men have been asking for Rhett Butler and
Daddy Warbucks.
With an inventory of over 3000 costumes,
99 percent of them made by Assistance
League of Santa Clara County volunteers who
run the project, the Costume Bank isthe larg
est costume resource in the Stanford area.
"We try to make a total look for the person,"
said Balfor.
Mermaids, snowmen, ham sandwiches,
dragons, — with a little work, a few ideas, and
some shopping around — can come alive Oc
