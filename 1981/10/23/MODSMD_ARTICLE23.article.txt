# Tresidder has bowling and other games
##

For most, Tresidder Union is the place
for a quick cup of coffee,_ a stop at the
bank, a visit to the ASSU offices or a search
for the latest copy of the Daily. But there is
another side of Tresidder — the Tresidder
Recreation Center.
The center boasts such activities as bowl
ing, video and pinball games, ping-pong,
and billiards. The mainstay of the center is
clearly the video and pinball games, even
though they were added more recently
than the bowling alleys which have been
around "as long as the building has —
about 18 years," said Recreation Manager
Cheryl St. Clair.
St. Clair and Tresidder's upper man
agement are trying to find the cure to the
alley's ails. In addition to student in
tramurals, lunch leagues, and evening
leagues, the center sponsors special dorm
nights and open bowling on Sunday eve
nings from 6 pm to midnight, for 45 cents
per line.
On other evenings, the cost is a dollar
per line. "We charge a dollar, but if you go
to Community House (another local bowl
ing center), they charge $1.15 to $1.50," St.
Clair explained. "It's a little more than I'd
like, but we have to cover overhead for ev
erything."
While Tresidder as a whole is non-profit,
each business is responsible for covering
the money that it uses in lighting and heat
ing.
"The Recreation Center comes out
ahead," St. Clair said. "But that's not in
cluding our overhead plus the expenses of

the people running the center (herself and
fifteen rotating student employees) and all
of Tresidder. Then we come out in the
red."
Another reason for what many students
may consider an inflated bowling price, is
that the center is not open solely to cam
pus affiliates.
"This isn't a student center," St Clair
said. "It's a community center, and that's
why we can't offer student discounts."
Dave Moskowitz, 1974 Stanford gradu
ate, stressed that, "you can't really say it is
just for Stanford students because the
community supports the campus and the
campus supports the community. Most
importantly, if the bowling was left to rely
merely on the students, it would never sur
vive.
On a typical evening, Tresidder Recrea
tion Center enjoys a good-sized, largely
student crowd in the gameroom area, and
a mix of area residents, leagues, and stu
dents at the bowling alleys. On one partic
ular night, only one of the nine alleys
being used (there are fourteen) was oc
cupied by Stanford students — six were
being used by a community league, ac
cording to St. Clair. When asked why she
comes to Tresidder, one woman in the
league said, "We like it here. The lanes are
good, it's not too crowded, and it's really
the only decent bowling alley in the area."
Moskowitz, who frequented the center
in the early 70s before he graduated,

added that "it's changed a lot. They've
added the gameroom, and it seems to be
used more now than in '71, '72, '73 — peo
ple were doing different things then."
The gameroom is rarely empty, even
during the day, said St. Clair. Some line up
to use the more popular games like Pac-
Man and Space Invaders, while others
keep pumping the quarters into such
video wonders as Donkey King, Frogger,
Missile Command, and Super Cobra, she
said.
Freshman Jim Kohn said he likes to play
the games "because it's a good study
break. I'll probably be coming here even
more as the quarter progresses and the
work starts piling up. There's nothing like a
game of Donkey King to get your mind off
Western Culture reading."
While the Recreation Center is running
smoothly, it isn't at maximum use. St. Clair
stressed, "We want to push student partici
pation, especially in the intramurals, stu
dent leagues, and lunch leagues, but we
haven't been successful and I'm not sure
why."
St. Clair took the job because she had
been involved with the student union at
her midwest university. "But when I got
here I was real disappointed," she ad
mitted. "Students at Stanford are not like
state university students. They pay so much
to come here, if they're involved in some
thing, it certainly isn't bowling."
The Recreation Center also acts as head
quarters for Stanford/Tresidder Outdoor
Programs (STOPS), a support service for all
Stanford outdoor organizations.
