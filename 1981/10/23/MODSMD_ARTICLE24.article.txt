## 
### Debbie Appel 
Fraternity bashes aren't the only places for
wining, dining and dancing this weekend. Al
though the Stanford Mothers' Club does not
promise traditional party staples such as
Murphy's Lawyers, kegs of beer and strawberry
daiquiris, their "Chrysanthemum Party and
Golden Boutique" on Sunday, Oct. 25, is guaran
teed to be a pleasant afternoon for everyone.
The party will be held from 1 to 5 p.m. at
Syntex, 3401 Hillside Ave. in Palo Alto. A $6
donation is requested at the door or tickets can
be purchased in advance.
There will be a tea dance with music by the
Stanford Jazz Band, including big band hits, the
Charleston, polkas and all forms of jazz. The
Mendicants, a Stanford choral group, will also
perform, and there will be a fashion show spon
sored by Saks Fifth Avenue with models includ
ing Stanford Dollies, coaches, alumni, parents,
and students.
One of the main attractions at the party will be
a boutique featuring items made by club mem
bers and Stanford moms all over the world. Ev
eryone is welcome to white champagne and
hors d'oeuvres, and football fans will appreciate
the television sets provided for the afternoon

games.
This party is the main fund-raising event for
the Mothers' Club, an organization which pro
vides scholarships and supports student health
at Stanford. Membership in the club is not lim
ited to mothers of past or present Stanford stu
dents but often includes community members
with an interest in Stanford affairs.
In addition to organizing fund-raising events,
the club sends out a newsletter to all Stanford
mothers soliciting contributions and selling
small items.
According to Elayne Christiansen, publicity
chairperson for the party, the club was founded
in 1924 "to give funds to start a hospital, because
at that time there were no health facilities for
students at Stanford."
The tradition of a tea began in 1972 as a small
Christmas present sale. It was such a success that
tHe idea caught on and expanded into the gala
event it is today.
Last year 700 people attended the party, rais
ing $11,000. The club raised a total of $26,018 last
year, which provided three full scholarships,
one partial scholarship, emergency aid grants to
students and support for various health services
at Stanford.
