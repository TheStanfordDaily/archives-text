## Reagan-Senate honeymoon over 
### 
from the Daily wire services
Washington— That "old black magic"
apparently is not working any longer with
Congress for President Ronald Reagan.
Nearly a month ago, the president reluc
tantly decided on a midcourse correction
in the 1982 budget to restore the faith of fi
nancial markets in his economic program.
As a result, he submitted a new round of
budget cuts and "revenue-enhancing"
measures to help reach his promised goal
of a balanced budget by 1984.
Unlike his previous budget victories,
Reagan was faced with a new atmosphere
in Congress. Republicans seemed unwill
ing to accept unquestioningly the line of
the White House and Reagan's austere
budget director, David Stockman.
Indeed, the president's package turned
out to be unacceptable. Reductions of 12
percent in nondefense appropriations —
programs heavily cut during the summer
— precipitated a split in Republican ranks.
Back on Capitol Hill, Senate Republican
leaders started reshaping Reagan's second
round of budget-cut proposals to their
own specifications. House Republicans
began work on their plan, too. Instead of
buying the administration's proposals out

skepticism that was not in evidence during
the first round, when political soundings
persuaded to give the president what
he wanted to restore the nation's econo
my.
"Last time, all the president had to do
was hoist the flag and all the senators
trooped into line,"said an aidetotheSen

tional congressional practices, back to the
trenches."
There are several reasons Congress has
reverted to slugging it out as usual, with
the Republicans in disarray on how to pro
ceed so they can save Reagan from defeat
and reach his and their budget-balancing
goal.
Some of the change has to do with the
chinks discovered in Reagan's armor. Con

ation. In addition, new national polls
showed public approval of additional
budget cuts was dropping. Thus, members
of Congress saw it might be possible to fol
low some course other than blind obe
dience.
Then, Wall Street failed to react favor
ably to passage of the Reagan economic
program — largely because of the pros
pects of continuing enormous budget def
icits — and interest rates remained high.
Members of Congress were fearful they
would be blamed if the hoped-for eco
nomic recovery failed to occur on sched
ule. They saw their futures on the line, with
the 1982 election looming.

In addition, Reagan's proposed cuts
were seen as going back on promises ad
ministration officials had made to win
votes for the budget in the first place.
Moderate Republicans from the Northeast
and Midwest — the Gypsy Moths —
thought the White House's proposals dealt
unfairly with programs they thought they
had saved from the budget ax, such as low
income energy assistance and student
loans, and treated defense spending too
gently.
Finally, Reagan's latest S 16-billion pack
age of budget cuts and tax-raising meas
ures — euphemistically called "revenue-

enhancing" measures — came up against
the appropriations committees. Until now,
members of these committees, which or
dinarily had the most to say about spend
ing, had seen themselves overshadowed
by the budget committees. No longer,
since the game was now being played on
their turf, as apropriations bills had to re
ceive their approval.
As more and more senators voice their
disapproval, the reshaping of the presi
dent's package starts in earnest. The skep
ticism about White House economic
projections is out in the open; the unwill
ingness to follow White House guidance
blindly is plain.
