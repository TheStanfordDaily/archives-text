# U.S. — China scholar exchange program
## Different traditions create difficulties 
### Christine Myers Senior staff writer (Part two of a series) 
Reciprocal arrangements for American scholars
who visit China can be frustrating to those who are
used to unrestricted access to data. But officials
who arrange Sino-American exchange programs
have their share of headaches, too.
The decision to turn toward the West's institu
tional and value systems can be a dangerous one
tor the Chinese politicians who invite foreign re
searchers to do fieldwork.
Thomas Fingar, assistant director of the Sino-
American exchange program here, said American
scholars sometimes find Chinese political con
siderations difficult to adjust to. "It's risky in a way
very few si holars can appreciate," he said.
Fingar said he believes that despite the nation's
development problems, the Chinese rtped to put
more effort into accommodating the fieldwork of*
humanities and social science researchers. He
cited complaints about difficulties in arranging in
tetvievvs and access to archival materials and card
catalogs. "They (the Chinese) have not done all
they could, or should have, to facilitate social sci
ence and humanities research," Fingar said.
Fingar noted that no other foreign nationals
were conducting research in China as far as he
knew. "From the Chinese point of view," he said,
"we have received very favorable treatment."
He said he believes the difference in perception
stems from a different Chinese scholarly tradition.
"The concept of an objective pursuit of knowl
edge is not as important as its relevance to policy
decisions," he said.

Fingar said problems with exchange programs
can often result from political policies that are im
possible to implement within China. "A lot of de
velopmental policies the current leadership is im
plementing are very high-risk, politically," he said.
Those policies involve training a large contingent
of technicians to help promote modernization,
which will in turn trickle down to the masses. The
risk involves uncertainty that current policies will
remain in effect in the future, which can affect par
ticipants' political standing.
One recent incident involving a Stanford an
thropology graduate student has heightened dis
cussions of scholarly versus political needs among
administrators of the program.
Fingar stressed the importance of keeping prob
lems in perspective, saying "For every example of a
problem in the program, there's probably an ex
ample of individual cooperation on the Chinese
side." \ "
The Ministry of Education oversees arrange
ments on the Chinese side. The State Scientific and
Technological Committee acts as an administrative
body, and works with the Chinese academies of
science and social sciences.
The Committee on Scholarly Communication
with the People's Republic of China serves as the
primary coordinating unit on the national level. It
is sponsored by the American Council of Learned
Societies and is administered in conjunction with
the National Academy of Sciences and the Social
Science Research Council.
The organizations function in a screening,
placement and funding capacity for competitive

programs such as the National Program for Ad
vanced Training and Research in £hina. About 50
applicants are selected for the National Program
each year and receive transportation and living
stipends for their work.
Stanford.is one of about 60 universities that par
ticipate in informal exchange programs through
agreements with their Chinese counterparts.
Fingar said the program here seems to work
well, especially because there is no quota for
scholars. "Stanford is free to choose the most high
ly qualified people at times when they are ready to
go," he said.
Between 120 and 130 Chinese scholars are visit
ing the University now, according to Fingar. Ten
more have finished their work and returned to
China.
Six University scholars have worked in China un
der informal agreements, mostly in thp fieldsof po
litical science and history. One is still working un
der this direct arrangement. At least 10 University
students have done research in history, political
science and geophysics in China under informal
agreements.
Another four scholars, one of whom is ,%till in
China, were placed through the National Program.
One other scholar has been selected through the
program but has not yet departed for China.
Under special arrangements with Chinese uni
versities, Stanford" provides tuition and fees for
most guest scholars. Graduate students from here
who are receiving stipends or fellowships may con
tinue to receive tnem in China, while Chinese uni
versities usually provide scholars' tuition.
