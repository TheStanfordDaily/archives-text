# Bellweather race nears end

### Washington Post 
Whippany, N.J. — When President Ronald
Reagan came to this suburb the other eve
ning to campaign for New Jersey Republican
gubernatorial candidate Thomas Kean, he
began his speech in an unusual way.
"Let me clear up a misunderstanding that
evidently exists with Tom's opponent," Rea
gan said. "It's not true that I am running for
governor of New Jersey. And it's not true that
I was going to take the Social Security away
from that little old lady on television."
Reagan's opener was a backhanded ac
knowledgement that "Tom's opponent,"
Democratic Rep. JamesFlorio, has succeeded
to some extent in making the president and
his budget policies an issue in the New Jersey
race.
The once-desultory campaign has caught
fire since Florio began swinging away in both
his speeches and television ads at Rea
ganomics and the derivative version of it he
says Kean would "superimpose" on New Jer
sey if elected.
Jhe result has been to make this election
more legitimately a test of public reactions to
Reagan's policies than it was last summer
when it was first dubbed a "referendum" on
Reaganomics.
The irony is that as the national importance
of the contest has grown because of Florio's
change of tactics, the chances of a Re
publican upset have increased.
Although Democrats have a big regis
tration edge, the COP has held the gov
ernorship only four of the last 28 years and
Florio has led in every published poll, Re
publicans claim that their private polls the last
two weeks have shown Kean narrowly ahead.
The Florio camp is closemouthed about its
polls, but a knowledgeable Democratic poli
tician said the last poll he had seen showed
Florio five percentage points ahead — a
margin he called "not safe enough for com
fort."
The New Jersey "referendum" concept
was born of two factors: Kean, a former
speaker of the New Jersey assembly, made
the centerpiece of his campaign in both the
primary and general election a plan for cut
ting state corporate and sales taxes to spur job
growth — an echo of Reaganomics.
And New Jersey has been a real two-party
battleground. Despite the Democrats' domi
nance in Trenton, Republican presidential
candidates have carried the state in the last
four elections. Reagan, who cut deeply into
blue-collar Democratic precincts in gaining
his 400,000-vote victory, said that "nowhere is
the political realignment more apparent than
here in New Jersey" because its "working
people finally realize that the Republican Par

ty is their party."
Early on, it was the Kean campaign that em
phasized Reaganomics, by targeting TV ads
against Florio's opposition to the Reagan
budget and tax cuts. But in the last two weeks,
Florio has forced the Reagan issue to the fore
front with classic Democratic attacks against
the "hard-hearted" policies of Reagan and
Kean.
Talking to a Bergen County labor breakfast,
where several of the union leaders readily ac
knowledged to reporters that they had
backed Reagan in 1980 and still thought he
was doing what one called "pretty good for
an apprentice," Florio called on them to
combat "the threat to the well-being of the
working people of New jersey" from the Rea
gan-Kean policies.
There and at a rally at Kean State College,
named for his rival's ancestors, Florio invoked
the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.,
who had traveled to New Jersey to endorse
him, as authority for the statement that there
is "a certain meanness" about the Reagan-
Kean philosophy, "a cavalier attitude about
people . . . that is really scary."
"We are not just electing a governor," he
said. "We are telling the nation we reject a
philosophy that seems to be prevailing."
Florio strategists say the head-on challenge
has begun to solidify the Democratic vote
and has halted the erosion they acknowledge
was taking place in Florio's early lead.
Florio said he thought the tactic was keep
ing Kean on the defensive. "Tom is a thought
ful guy," he said, "who was a moderate in the
legislature. He took this Reagan tax position
to get through the primary and now he's
stuck with it."
Republicans tell a different story. They say
Florio switched to the national issues only
when the polling showed Kean was moving
ahead on themajorstateconcerns: thedesire
for a change from two-term Democratic Gov.
Brendan Byrne, who is ineligible to succeed
himself; cutting crime and taxes; and bring
ing jobs into the state. Rather than solidifying
Democratic support, they said, Florio's at
tacks on Reagan have helped Kean regain Re
publican voters in south jersey who had been
supporting Florio as a hometown boy.
Kean told a reporter that "running against
Ronald Reagan is not the way to be elected
governor of New Jersey, not with all the burn
ing issues we have in the state. The issue in
this election is not Ronald Reagan. It's Tom
Kean and my program. And that's why I'm
going to win."
If he does win, however, Reagan has cer
tainly set the stage — with Florio's help — for
claiming a share of the victory.
