New York — Welcome to the
"basis-point society."
The phrase may not have
quite the familiar, telling ring
of such other modern-day de
scriptives as the "me decade"
or "the baby boom gener
ation."
But it is an apt one for an era
in which the latest develop
ments in interest rates can
dominate conversation at a
backyard barbecue as easily as
they can at the board meeting
of a bank.
Many members of the basis
point society may not have
known much about economics
and finance a few years ago.
But lately they have been tak

ing a crash course.
Latest yield
Today they can probably
quote you the latest yield on
their Treasury bill or money
market fund or All-Savers
certificate down to the last
"basis point," or one-hun
dredth of a percentage point.
The transformation has
created what many business
people believe to be a new
growth industry of imposing
proportions — financial ser
vices.
It has prompted securities
brokers to diversify out of their
traditional stocks-and-bonds
product lines into insurance,

real estate and cash man
agement.
Assetts work harder
And it has encouraged sever
al giants of the business world
— Prudential Insurance, Amer
ican Express and Sears
Roebuck — to buy up large
Wall Street firms.
"Consumers are quite ra
tionally dealing with inflation
by making their assets work
harder for them," said James
Robinson, chairman of Ameri
can Express, in a speech last
week to a Securities Industry
Association gathering. "They
are looking both for flexibility
and a competitive return on
their money.

Purchase power
"In today's markets these
knowledgeable consumers
wield immense power. It
behooves financial institutions
to recognize this power."
Thus, Amex's acquisition of
the brokerage house now
known as Shearson-American
Express; Prudential's takeover
of Bache Group, and Sears'
purchase of Dean Witter Rey
nolds and Coldwell Banker, a
big real estate firm.
"With these competitors
now aboard," Robinson asked,
"how far off course is it to think
of IBM, AT&T or Exxon as the
next generation of competi
tion?"
