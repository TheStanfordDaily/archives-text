# Plagued by injuries
## Sports Cards face Sun Devils 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford football team, plagued all season
by injuries, inefficiency and a murderous sched
ule, needs a win this weekend against the 5-1 Ar
izona State Sun Devils to preserve any hopes of a
winning season.
Experienced, brawny but quick, the Sun Dev
ils come off three consecutive execution-style
wins over Washington (26-7), Oregon (24-0), and
UC-Berkeley (45-17).
The Cardinals, on the other hand, come off a
25-17 loss to USC that left them almost literally
crippled. Halfback Darrin Nelson suffered
bruised ribs, defensive stalwart Dave Morze (in
side linebacker) missed this weeks' practice with
a sprained knee, wide reciever Mike Tolliver sus
tained a back injury that has him listed as uncer
tain to start, and defensive tackle John Bergren
suffered a pinched neck nerve.
Andre Tyler, the senior wide-receiver who
broke his foot at the start of the season, has still
not recovered and may undergo surgery soon,
which would dismiss any chance of playing this
year. Safety Kevin MacMillan recently re
covered from a broken hand only to reinjure his
hip in practice, and has ended his carreer.
The Cards are 1-2 in the Pacific-10 conference
after the loss to USC, and tied for 7th with UC-
Berkeley, as opposed to the 3-1 Sun Devils who
are in a tie for second place with Washington.
With the Cards' new-found defensive prowess
and ASU's surprisingly explosive offense, fans
may very well see the same kind of physical

showdown as last week. In between is the big
question mark of the game: can the Cardinal of
fense generate more than 14 points for the first
time all season?
Coached by former San Jose State coach Daryl
Rogers, the Sun Devils boast the kind of offense
that Stanford was supposed to have at thestart of
the season, with depth in the backfield balanced
by a highly effective passing game when they
need it.
Quarterback Mike Pagel, a 6-foot-2 200-
pound senior, leads an effort that has averaged
close to 500 yards per game. Although the Sun
Devils gain most of it on the ground by way of
tailback Robert Weathers, Pagel has completed
85-of-158 passes for 1086 yards and a Pac-10 lead
ing II touchdowns.
An all-purpose back, Weathers leads ASU in
both rushing and receiving. At 218-pounds, the
senior has already gained 661 yards in 118 times
carrying the ball for three touchdowns — setting
up an almost sure 1000-yard season — and has 16
receptions for 189 yards. Weathers is com
plemented at fullback by Gerald Riggs, a 6-2 230-
pound senior. He missed the Cal contest with a
sprained knee, but has racked up 512 yards on 71
attempts in only five games.
To combat the ASU offensive threat and try to
spark Stanford's own scoring attack, head coach
Paul Wiggin said that the Cards may resort to
some "diversionary" football, which means in
effect, fasten your seatbelts because the razzle
dazzle Instant Offense might make a comeback.

alias Agent 007 as his helmet indicates, takes on the Arizo

The Stanford football team, plagued all season
by injuries, inefficiency and a murderous sched
ule, needs a win this weekend against the 5-1 Ar
izona State Sun Devils to preserve any hopes of a
winning season.
Experienced, brawny but quick, the Sun Dev
ils come off three consecutive execution-style
wins over Washington (26-7), Oregon (24-0), and
UC-Berkeley (45-17).
The Cardinals, on the other hand, come off a
25-17 loss to USC that left them almost literally
crippled. Halfback Darrin Nelson suffered
bruised ribs, defensive stalwart Dave Morze (in
side linebacker) missed this weeks' practice with
a sprained knee, wide reciever Mike Tolliver sus
tained a back injury that has him listed as uncer
tain to start, and defensive tackle John Bergren
suffered a pinched neck nerve.
Andre Tyler, the senior wide-receiver who
broke his foot at the start of the season, has still
not recovered and may undergo surgery soon,
which would dismiss any chance of playing this
year. Safety Kevin MacMillan recently re
covered from a broken hand only to reinjure his
hip in practice, and has ended his carreer.
The Cards are 1-2 in the Pacific-10 conference
after the loss to USC, and tied for 7th with UC-
Berkeley, as opposed to the 3-1 Sun Devils who
are in a tie for second place with Washington.
With the Cards' new-found defensive prowess
and ASU's surprisingly explosive offense, fans
may very well see the same kind of physical

showdown as last week. In between is the big
question mark of the game: can the Cardinal of
fense generate more than 14 points for the first
time all season?
Coached by former San Jose State coach Daryl
Rogers, the Sun Devils boast the kind of offense
that Stanford was supposed to have at thestart of
the season, with depth in the backfield balanced
by a highly effective passing game when they
need it.
Quarterback Mike Pagel, a 6-foot-2 200-
pound senior, leads an effort that has averaged
close to 500 yards per game. Although the Sun
Devils gain most of it on the ground by way of
tailback Robert Weathers, Pagel has completed
85-of-158 passes for 1086 yards and a Pac-10 lead
ing II touchdowns.
An all-purpose back, Weathers leads ASU in
both rushing and receiving. At 218-pounds, the
senior has already gained 661 yards in 118 times
carrying the ball for three touchdowns — setting
up an almost sure 1000-yard season — and has 16
receptions for 189 yards. Weathers is com
plemented at fullback by Gerald Riggs, a 6-2 230-
pound senior. He missed the Cal contest with a
sprained knee, but has racked up 512 yards on 71
attempts in only five games.
To combat the ASU offensive threat and try to
spark Stanford's own scoring attack, head coach
Paul Wiggin said that the Cards may resort to
some "diversionary" football, which means in
effect, fasten your seatbelts because the razzle
dazzle Instant Offense might make a comeback.
