# It's Valenzuela vs. Righetti as NY takes 2-0 series lead to LA
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — They
call it Fernandomania and
fans of the Los Angeles
Dodgers hope the pitching
of the left-handed rookie
from Mexico can get their
club back into the World
Series picture against the
New York Yankees tonight.
Fernando Valenzuela,
who won his first eight de
cisions this season and fin
ished 13-7, goes against an
other rookie left-hander,
Dave Righetti, at Dodger
Stadium. It is the first time in
31 years a pair of first-year
major league pitchers have
started a World Series game.
The 5-foot-11, 180-pound
Valenzuela is 20 years old,
while the 6-3, 200-pound
Righetti is 22.

New York arrived in Los
Angeles with a 2-0 lead in
the best four-of-seven
series for baseball's cham
pionship.
"The only thing I'm going
to try to do is win the game,"
said the chunky Valenzuela
on the eve of his most im
portant outing. After being
the surprise starter in the
Dodgers' opening game of
the season, the 20-year-old
native of Etchohuaquila,
Mexico, went on to lead the
league in shutouts with
eight, complete games with
11, and strikeouts with 180.
The third game of the
Series is scheduled for 5:30
p.m. PDT and Los Angeles
Manager Tommy Lasorda
talks of recuperation for his

club, which was beaten 5-3
and 3-0 in Yankee Stadium.
"We play good baseball in
front of our fans," he said.
"In the best-of-seven, one
team has to win four."
He can remember the last
time the clubs met in the
World Series, in 1978. The
Dodgers won the fifst'two
games in their home stadi
um and then proceeded to
lose four straight and the
championship.
Incidentally, the winning
pitcher in that first game was
Tommy John, the winning
pitcher in New York on
Wednesday night. He be
came a free agent when the
Dodgers offered only a two
year contract and he wanted
one for three.
He now has pitched three
seasons for the Yankees,
and allowed only three
Dodger hits in the seven in
nings he worked against
them Wednesday, with
Goose Gossagefinishing up.
There was a possibility
that two of the stars of the
1978 series could return to
action in Los Angeles. Both
Reggie Jackson of the Yan
kees and Reggie Smith of
the Dodgers have been out
with injuries, although
Smith has pinch-hit in the
playoffs.
Jackson commented: "If
it was the last game of the
Series, I could play if I had
to. We had yesterday off so
I'll take the extra rest and
see if I can piay tonight."

Yankee Manager Bob
Lemon, who took over in
midseason from Gene
Michael, remained calm
and confident, but made no
comment on the status of
Jackson.
With Bucky Dent, the
shortstop star of the 1978
World Series, out of action,
Larry Milbourne came
through with the hit that
drove in the Yankees' first
run of the second game.
Milbourne was acquired
from Seattle in a trade after
the 1980 season.
For tonight's game and
the afternoon contests Sat
urday and Sunday, thestadi
um's 56,000-seat capacity
has been sold out. The Sun
day game will be played
only if the Dodgers win one
of the first two.

"We have hit weil in
Dodger Stadium," said
Dodgers' first baseman
Steve Garvey. "And we
came back in both the
divisional series with Hous
ton and the championship
series with Montreal."
But in Yankee Stadium,
the National League repre
sentatives collected just five
hits in the first game and
four in the second and were
shut down each time they
threatened winning rallies.
Although they're two
games in the hole, what
Garvey said is true — the
Dodgers have proved they
can come back
They fell behind Houston
2-0 in the NL West's five
game mini-series, then
roared back to win all three
games at Dodger Stadium.

major league pitchers have
started a World Series game.
The 5-foot-11, 180-pound
Valenzuela is 20 years old,
while the 6-3, 200-pound
Righetti is 22.

New York arrived in Los
Angeles with a 2-0 lead in
the best four-of-seven
series for baseball's cham
pionship.
"The only thing I'm going
to try to do is win the game,"
said the chunky Valenzuela
on the eve of his most im
portant outing. After being
the surprise starter in the
Dodgers' opening game of
the season, the 20-year-old
native of Etchohuaquila,
Mexico, went on to lead the
league in shutouts with
eight, complete games with
11, and strikeouts with 180.
The third game of the
Series is scheduled for 5:30
p.m. PDT and Los Angeles
Manager Tommy Lasorda
talks of recuperation for his

club, which was beaten 5-3
and 3-0 in Yankee Stadium.
"We play good baseball in
front of our fans," he said.
"In the best-of-seven, one
team has to win four."
He can remember the last
time the clubs met in the
World Series, in 1978. The
Dodgers won the fifst'two
games in their home stadi
um and then proceeded to
lose four straight and the
championship.
Incidentally, the winning
pitcher in that first game was
Tommy John, the winning
pitcher in New York on
Wednesday night. He be
came a free agent when the
Dodgers offered only a two
year contract and he wanted
one for three.
He now has pitched three
seasons for the Yankees,
and allowed only three
Dodger hits in the seven in
nings he worked against
them Wednesday, with
Goose Gossagefinishing up.
There was a possibility
that two of the stars of the
1978 series could return to
action in Los Angeles. Both
Reggie Jackson of the Yan
kees and Reggie Smith of
the Dodgers have been out
with injuries, although
Smith has pinch-hit in the
playoffs.
Jackson commented: "If
it was the last game of the
Series, I could play if I had
to. We had yesterday off so
I'll take the extra rest and
see if I can piay tonight."

Yankee Manager Bob
Lemon, who took over in
midseason from Gene
Michael, remained calm
and confident, but made no
comment on the status of
Jackson.
With Bucky Dent, the
shortstop star of the 1978
World Series, out of action,
Larry Milbourne came
through with the hit that
drove in the Yankees' first
run of the second game.
Milbourne was acquired
from Seattle in a trade after
the 1980 season.
For tonight's game and
the afternoon contests Sat
urday and Sunday, thestadi
um's 56,000-seat capacity
has been sold out. The Sun
day game will be played
only if the Dodgers win one
of the first two.

"We have hit weil in
Dodger Stadium," said
Dodgers' first baseman
Steve Garvey. "And we
came back in both the
divisional series with Hous
ton and the championship
series with Montreal."
But in Yankee Stadium,
the National League repre
sentatives collected just five
hits in the first game and
four in the second and were
shut down each time they
threatened winning rallies.
Although they're two
games in the hole, what
Garvey said is true — the
Dodgers have proved they
can come back
They fell behind Houston
2-0 in the NL West's five
game mini-series, then
roared back to win all three
games at Dodger Stadium.
Los Angeles (AP) — They
call it Fernandomania and
fans of the Los Angeles
Dodgers hope the pitching
of the left-handed rookie
from Mexico can get their
club back into the World
Series picture against the
New York Yankees tonight.
Fernando Valenzuela,
who won his first eight de
cisions this season and fin
ished 13-7, goes against an
other rookie left-hander,
Dave Righetti, at Dodger
Stadium. It is the first time in
31 years a pair of first-year
major league pitchers have
started a World Series game.
The 5-foot-11, 180-pound
Valenzuela is 20 years old,
