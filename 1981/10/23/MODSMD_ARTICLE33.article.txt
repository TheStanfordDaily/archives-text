Los Angeles (AP) â€” They
call it Fernandomania and
fans of the Los Angeles
Dodgers hope the pitching
of the left-handed rookie
from Mexico can get their
club back into the World
Series picture against the
New York Yankees tonight.
Fernando Valenzuela,
who won his first eight de
cisions this season and fin
ished 13-7, goes against an
other rookie left-hander,
Dave Righetti, at Dodger
Stadium. It is the first time in
31 years a pair of first-year
major league pitchers have
started a World Series game.
The 5-foot-11, 180-pound
Valenzuela is 20 years old,
while the 6-3, 200-pound
Righetti is 22.

New York arrived in Los
Angeles with a 2-0 lead in
the best four-of-seven
series for baseball's cham

"The only thing I'm going

said the chunky Valenzuela
on the eve of his most im
portant outing. After being
the surprise starter in the
Dodgers' opening game of
the season, the 20-year-old
native of Etchohuaquila,
Mexico, went on to lead the
league in shutouts with
eight, complete games with
11, and strikeouts with 180.
The third game of the
Series is scheduled for 5:30
p.m. PDT and Los Angeles
Manager Tommy Lasorda
talks of recuperation for his

club, which was beaten 5-3
and 3-0 in Yankee Stadium.
"We play good baseball in
front of our fans," he said.
"In the best-of-seven, one
team has to win four."
He can remember the last
time the clubs met in the
World Series, in 1978. The
Dodgers won the fifst'two
games in their home stadi
um and then proceeded to
lose four straight and the
championship.
Incidentally, the winning
pitcher in that first game was
Tommy John, the winning
pitcher in New York on
Wednesday night. He be
came a free agent when the
Dodgers offered only a two
year contract and he wanted
