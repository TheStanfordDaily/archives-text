# Water poloists to meet UC-Davis
## 
### Chris Addington Hell Week 
It conjures up visions of
scavenger hunts, kidnappings,
and parties.
But not for the Stanford wa
ter polo team. Hell Week for
them consists of one thing:
conditioning and more condi
tioning.
Since the Cardinals are
playing the Division II UC-

Davis Aggies tomorrow at de-
Guerre pool, head coach
Dante Dettamanti designated
this week as the pinnacle of the
season. From this game on, it's
a 112 ive-week-long downhill
coast to the Nationals.
For the players, however, a
pinnacle means only one
thing: swimming.
The 2500 yards of basic con
ditioning may not seem like

much, but when one considers
the counter-attack after coun
ter-attack done during a game
in a 30-meter pool, the yardage
piles up.
Add to that the morning
workouts with weights and the
infamous Stanford Stadium
steps, and it makes for a tired
bunch of water polo players.
Coach Dettamanti plans to
keep upthisschedule until ear

ly next week, when things will
taper off in preparation for the
Pacific-10 conference and Pa
cific Coast Athletic Association
tourney. Stanford will go
against the top four teams in
the PCAA, inc~ the pow
erhouses UC-lrvine, and Long
Beach.
The match will begin at 10:30
a.m., and admission is free.
