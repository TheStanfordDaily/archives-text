# Seattle-Pacific in town Saturday
## Card booters split two this week 
### Adam Berns 
This week the injury plagued Stanford
soccer team travelled to Westmont Col
lege to play Dominguez Hills and West
mont. The Cardinals managed a split rec
ord, beating Dominguez Hills 3-2 while
losing to Westmont 3-0.
Stanford coach Nelson said that his team
did not play well in either game but noted
that injuries have also had a major affect.
Senior striker Jorge Titinger is still injured
and was only one of several starters unable
to play. In addition, forward Ted
Rafalovich, who leads the Cards in assists
was playing with a minor injury.
Tuesday, Stanford played Dominguez
Hills, a team Lodge said was one of the
finest Division II teams in the nation last
year. However, Lodge said that beyond
five or six really good players this year,
there was a real dropoff in talent. That's
where Stanford had the advantage.
However, Lodge was unimpressed by
Stanford's play on Tuesday. "Our win over

Dominguez Hills was one of the few games
where we played poorly and yet were still
able to win," Lodge said.
Stanford won the game 3-2 and all three
goals were scored by senior striker Willie
Guicci. One of them was scored on a pen
alty kick while the other two came on as
sists from Rafolovich and freshman mid
fielder Angel Vasquez.
Stanford started the game quickly, scor
ing in the first five minutes and ended it in
the same style by scoring the winning goal
with less than four minutes to play.
On Wednesday, the Cardinals played an
excellent Westmont team and lost 3-0. It
was a tough loss for Stanford because the
game was really much closer than the
score indicated. "We were flat and tired
from the day before," Lodge says,"and
Westmont is an excellent team."
Westmont's first two goals were ex
ecuted well and in remarkablysimilarfash
lon. Both began from about 60 yards back
when a Westmont defender faked to the

left and then shot a perfect pass 55-60 yards
down the field on the right hand side and
both ended when a streaking s iker took
the pass and scored.
Unfortunately for the Cards, the third
Westmont goal was just poor luck and
that's the goal that took Stanford out of the
game. Westmont had a free kick from
around 22 yards out and the ball deflected
off the edge of the Cardinal wall into the
goal. Ironically, if the ball hadn't been de
flected by a Stanford player, it probably
wouldn't have gone in.
This Saturday the Cardinals will certainly
have their hands full as they take on'Seat
tle-Pacific here at Harry Maloney field.
Lodge is concerned about the game be
cause Seattle-Pacific has a wide variety of
offensive weapons.
"They play a vary diversified game,"
Lodge said. "They play with both long and
short passes and mix it up very well."
Lodge also noted that Seattle-Pacific is
not a team to be taken lightly.

BOOTERS SPLIT TWO — Stanford's soccer team lost one game and won another this
week. Although the Cards upset the No.1 team in the country, the University of Conn
ecticut, three weeks ago, their season has been up and down since then due to inconsis
tency and injuries. They play Seattle-Pacific tomorrow.
