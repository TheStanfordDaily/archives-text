### Lisa Stern 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball squad roped and tied
the Fresno State Lady Bulldogs
in three straight games, 15-6,
15-1, and 15-6 at home in
Maples Pavilion on Wednesday
night.
The victory, which came in
just less than one hour of play,
brings the Cards overall season
record to 19-9, and it ups their
league mark to 3-1 in NorCal
conference competition.
Fresno, meanwhile, plunges to
0-4 in league play to remain in
the conference cellar.
Stanford dominated the
Bulldogs from the beginning of
the first game. With the score
tied at three, sophomore Bobbi
Broer served for five points to
give the Cardinals a decisive
8-3 lead, a margin that their op
ponents could never surpass.

Fresno managed to pull within
five points to make the score
11-6 before senior Jan Linden
served out the match to furnish
the Card spikers with a 15-6 ad
vantage.
In game two of the contest,
Stanford surged to an early 5-0
lead. The Lady Bulldogs scored
their only point in the game
midway through the action to
make the score 7-1. Broer
agaom showed service
strength and consistency in a
four point rally to break the
game wide open, 11-1. The
Cards finished off Fresno short
ly thereafter to take the second
game, 15-1.
Stanford Head coach Fred
Sturm then decided to rest
starters Linden, Chris An
derson, and Deanna Boyette
before the first serve of the
third game. Fresno quickly

jumped off to a five point lead,
taking advantage of the Cards
lapse in momentum. However,
the spikers quickly regrouped
and, with Broer again serving,
pulled ahead 7-5. Freshman
Deidra Dvorak then served for
four points as the Cardinal
spikers went on to win the third
contest 15-6.
Broer, at her middle block
ing position, played her usual
aggressive style of volleyball
for the Cardinals, Redshirted
last season, she has come on to
regularly add 13 kills each
game to the spiker's effort.
Broer also leads the con
ference in blocked shots with a
mean of five per game.
Boyette, a junior, also per
formed exceptionally well out
side hitter for Stanford. She
contributed five kills in the sec
ond game alone, and she has

become the squad's leading
percentage hitter with a .303
average.
Coach Sturm was very
pleased with the team's effort
in the match. He said that he
was especially enthusiastic
about his squad's developing
maturity on the court.
"What sticks out in my
mind," he began, "is that we
played steady volleyball. It is
never easy to play at a high
level when your opponent is
playing at a lower level."
Responding to the question
of the spiker's lapse in intensity
at the onset of the third game,
Sturm quickly explained the
problems inherent in substitut
ing players in the middle of a
match.
