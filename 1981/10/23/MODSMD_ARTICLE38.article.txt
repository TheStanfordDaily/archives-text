## What in the hell kind of college grid season is this anyway? 
### John Kosner 
Is the 1981 college football season a
hoax? I ask you. If you take this sport seri
ously do you really run the risk of brain
damage?
You decide.
Here's the evidence: Seven Saturdays
into this most bewildering of seasons, the
Washington State Cougars (whose last
trip to the Rose Bowl came during the
Great Depression) are alone atop the
Pac-10 Conference. Also on top of their
worlds — as unbelievable as it seems —
are the lowa Hawkeyes in the Big Ten, and
the SMU Mustangs in the Southwest Con
ference.
For those in iove with the status quo (so

long the rule in college football) the news
only gets worse. Notre Dame is 2-3. Okla
homa is 2-2-1. Ohio State, Michigan, and
Nebraska have already lost twice each.
And not to worry, USC and Alabama
haven't been spared either — Arizona
having converted the haughty Trojans
into cactus juice two weeks ago and
Georgia Tech having brushed back the
Tide in Birmingham last month.
And then there's Texas. You want some
"Great Moments in Sports?" Try last Sat
urday's Texas-Arkansas game. Here's Tex
as — undefeated and ranked No. 1 —with
its pretty face sitting all over the cover of
the current SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, com
ing in to play its archrival at Little Rock

where, strange as it sounds, it had not
been beaten since 1965.
So what happens? You got it. The Long
horns fold up like a tent. Midway through
the third period the Hogs lead by 36
points. They coast, 42-11. You figure it
out.
And the beat goes on. This week, for
the first time since 1945, two Eastern
schools — Penn State and Pittsburgh,
both 5-0 — are one, two in the polls. But
look who's next . . . North Carolina (6-0)
and Clemson (6-0).
Two ACC schools in the nation's top
four? And it's not February? What in the
name of the Prudential College
Scoreboard is going on here?

I'm glad I asked. The answer is balance.
Principally through its anti-stockpiling
scholarship restrictions, the NCAA has
finally succeeded in bringing to college
football the sort of competitive balance
that college basketball has enjoyed for
the past five years. The freshman eligibili
ty rule has further added balance by ef
fectively spreading the country's talent
around. The new (and more sensible) ra
tionale among recruits seems to be: why
sit somewhere for two years if you can
play somewhere else for four?
Another reason for college football's
new balancing act is the growing tenden
cy among today's high school stars to play

their college ball closer to home. Two
notable examples are Stanford's John
Elway and Georgia's Herschel Walker,
both of whom turned down the polo
pastures of powerful USC for campuses a
bit more in their comfort zone.
The end result of college football's
brave new wave is the most amusing and
appealing season in memory. And if you
want something to hold onto in this fall of
flux, there are at least three propositions
worth putting money on — 1) Marcus Al
len to win the Heisman, 2) Penn State's
magnificent offensive guard Sean Farrell
to take the Out land Trophy, and 3) the Pitt
Panthers to be No. 1.
