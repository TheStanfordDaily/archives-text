THE GOLDEN SPIKE
700 Welch Road
Old Stanford Barn
321-8304
Give the Golden Spike Restaurant
and Bar a month, and I've no doubt it will
be a Stanford tradition. As it is, there are a
few things lacking, but owner Steve
Schwartz has some exciting ideas in the
works which can only improve this already
excellent restaurant.
Located at the rear of the Old Stanford
Barn, The Golden Spike is a mere two
weeks old. Schwartz has adopted a railroad
motif for this establishment, and for once a
cute idea has been pulled off far short of
tacky. The place has a nice, spacious feel
ing; the building's rustic beamed ceiling
has been successfully incorporated into
the interior design. The furnishings are
subtle, if a bit crowded. One of the nicer
touches is the huge antique bar, sprung
from Montana. At present, only beer and
wine are available, but a fully stocked bar
will look smashing in the mirrored panel
behind the bar.
Our party sampled three main courses:
London broil, prime rib, and a house spe
cial, the Golden Spike burger. We found
the food to be exceptionally well pre
pared; our meals were cooked precisely as
ordered, and the portions were generous.
Perhaps the best thing about The
Golden Spike is that students will find it af
fordable. Lunch prices range from $3 for
sandwiches (with fruit and some of the
best steak fries around) to $7 for a crab and
cheese meal (as long as you're trying to im
press your date, why not order the seafood

salad for $6). Dinner prices run from $4.50
steak sandwiches to $9.50 for the prime rib.
Keep in mind that these prices appear to
be well under those of other restaurants
while the portions are very generous.
Service was a bit slow, but our waitress
was very friendly and conscientious. In
fact, all the employees seemed genuinely
eager to please the customers.
Steve Schwartz brings expertise to his
new restaurant: he opened his first restau-

rant in Washington state after his
sophomore year at Stanford. The Golden
Spike looks and tastes like a class act, so
Schwartz must have learned something up
North. He has staffed his place with young
and energetic employees, some of whom
helped him with the actual rebuilding and
the interior decor.
Among the plans Schwartz has for The

Golden Spike is a separate room for busi
ness lunches or private buffets. Breakfast
will appear at the restaurant within the
week. And Schwartz is determined to
bring quality live entertainment back
within reach of Stanford students (and
their pocketbooks). In the next few weeks,
Norton Buffalo and Boz Scaggs' band will
perform after 9 p.m.
If the little kid in you gets the urge to
play with electric trains, The Golden Spike
is for you. Schwartz has a large train at

shoulder level throughout the restaurant
which is supposed to deliver drinks to your
table. It wasn't carrying any cargo when we
were there, but it was handy for sending
notes across the room.
Eat at The Golden Spike. You won't be
disappointed.

is for you. Schwartz has a large train at

shoulder level throughout the restaurant
which is supposed to deliver drinks to your
table. It wasn't carrying any cargo when we
were there, but it was handy for sending
notes across the room.
Eat at The Golden Spike. You won't be
disappointed.
