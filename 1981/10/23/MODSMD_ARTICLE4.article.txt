# Keeping the University out of trouble...
## Rosenzweig faces Washington cuts, research conflicts 
### Katie Smith 
University President Donald Ken
nedy praised Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president of public affairs, last
spring for providing "extraordinarily
effective" representation in Wash
ington and "quick analysis" of the
developments there affecting the
University.
Rosenzweig has weathered harsh
criticism and received high praise
since his arrival here in 1962. How
ever, he said, "I find a real satisfaction
in working for an important institu
tion lil«t' Stanford I loivprsitiot aro
tne last regaining set of institutions
that value openness and tolerance of

dissent."
Rosenzweig acts as a chief spokes
man of the University. "I don't try to
project an image for Stanford — just
reality," he said.
He spearheads fundraising and
must foresee and analyze the way
both outside issues and internal
changes will affect life here.
Bob Beyers, director of News and
Publications, said he is "very much
impressed with the way (Rosen
zweig) thinks through long-term is
sues which affect Stanford and
higher education."
Currently, most of these issues re
late to the rising costs of education
and government cutbacks of Univer
sity funds. He said the result of the
decline in research grants and gradu
ate fellowships will be a sharper focus
on the undergraduate tuition-paying
body. "Faculty members are learning
that their future well-being depends
on how attractive they are to under
graduates," Rosenzweig told a New
York Times reporter last spring.
He said he thinks the renewed un
dergraduate focus was a positive step
for the University. "I think univer
sities are at their healthiest when fac
ulties are talking about under
graduates," he said.
He noted that while the University
owed most of its growth during the
'60s to research, "research is isolat
ing, leading to narrower lines of in
quiry."
Regarding his work, Rosenzweig
said, "It is now established in practice
that research facilities and govern

ment are inextricably dependent.
Universities need the support of the
public and, therefore, the support of
the government. And, the govern
ment needs the minds and the re
search facilities of the universities."
He stressed it is not a government
university partnership but, rather, a
non-dependent support system that
is needed.
While foreseeing financial worries,
Rosenzweig admitted that the Uni
versity's past gift record has been
good. He attributed that success to
hard work, a good professional staff,
and (alumni) volunteers. "We don't
have a lot of established wealth
among the alumni, as do the eastern
institutions, so we've had to look for
non-affiliated donors," he said.
