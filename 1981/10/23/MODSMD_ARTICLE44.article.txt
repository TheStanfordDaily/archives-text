CAFFE SANTA
MADDALENA
233 University Ave.

.322-1846
Quick: Name a place where
you can get good, convenient,
reasonably priced food in an
informal, relaxed setting. Try
Caffe Santa Maddalena for all
this and more: a small,
cafeteria-style restaurant spe
cializing in fine Italian food and
quaint Italian charm.
Sandwiched between Mills
the Florist and the recently re
vived Stanford Theater on Uni
versity Avenue, Caffe Santa
Maddalena now inhabits the
building that housed Ben
nington's Cafeteria for the past
few decades.
We were somewhat sur
prised by the cafeteria set-up,
expecting a more formal din
ing room (in the tradition of
Frederick Maddalena's other
downtown restaurant). In

stead, we were greeted at the
door, invited to help ourselves
to trays, napkins and silver
ware, and introduced to the
menu and the food line.
Although neither I nor my
guest speak Italian beyond
Bon Giorno,' the women be
hind the counter helped us
make our way through the all-
Italian menu, explaining the a
la carte selections as we moved
down the line. (We later
learned that this was the ori
ginal line used in Bennington's
all these years.)
(An aside here: While we
loaded up our trays with the
entire meal (except dessert) in
one trip, customers may prefer
to select their meals course by
course, or some may choose to
order from their table and have
dishes brought to them by the
waitresses who are "more than
happy to serve you." Patrons
are encouraged to make them
selves comfortable and choose
their own dining pace.)

We began at the beginning,
with antipasti (even I recog
nized that word), selecting
marinated artichokes ($2.95)
and the house salad ($2.75).
The artichoke hearts were ex
cellent, served on a bed of let
tuce with tomatoes; the tossed
salad was not particularly un
usual but tasty.
For entrees we chose the
eggplant parmigiana ($4.95)
and the lasagne ($5.25), both of
which were served in generous
portions and covered with
meat sauce. Also included
were sauteed vegetables and
Italian bread. The vegetables,
assorted strips of carrots, zuc
chini and onions, were well
buttered and sauteed lightly
enough to remain crisp and
fresh. I was disappointed with
the meager allotment of one
piece of bread per customer,
discovering that diners are en
couraged to purchase whole
baguettes (or half-baguettes)
