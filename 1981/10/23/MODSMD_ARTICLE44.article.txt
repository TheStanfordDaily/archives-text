Quick: Name a place where
you can get good, convenient,
reasonably priced food in an
informal, relaxed setting. Try
Caffe Santa Maddalena for all
this and more: a small,
cafeteria-style restaurant spe
cializing in fine Italian food and
quaint Italian charm.
Sandwiched between Mills
the Florist and the recently re
vived Stanford Theater on Uni
versity Avenue, Caffe Santa
Maddalena now inhabits the
building that housed Ben
nington's Cafeteria for the past
few decades.
We were somewhat sur
prised by the cafeteria set-up,
expecting a more formal din
ing room (in the tradition of
Frederick Maddalena's other
downtown restaurant). In

stead, we were greeted at the
door, invited to help ourselves
to trays, napkins and silver
ware, and introduced to the
menu and the food line.
Although neither I nor my
guest speak Italian beyond
Bon Giorno,' the women be
hind the counter helped us
make our way through the all-
Italian menu, explaining the a
la carte selections as we moved
down the line. (We later
learned that this was the ori
ginal line used in Bennington's
all these years.)
(An aside here: While we
loaded up our trays with the
entire meal (except dessert) in
one trip, customers may prefer
to select their meals course by
course, or some may choose to
order from their table and have
dishes brought to them by the
waitresses who are "more than
happy to serve you." Patrons
are encouraged to make them
selves comfortable and choose
their own dining pace.)

We began at the beginning,
with antipasti (even I recog
nized that word), selecting
marinated artichokes ($2.95)
and the house salad ($2.75).
The artichoke hearts were ex
cellent, served on a bed of let
tuce with tomatoes; the tossed
salad was not particularly un
usual but tasty.
For entrees we chose the
eggplant parmigiana ($4.95)
and the lasagne ($5.25), both of
which were served in generous
portions and covered with
meat sauce. Also included
were sauteed vegetables and
Italian bread. The vegetables,
assorted strips of carrots, zuc
chini and onions, were well
buttered and sauteed lightly
enough to remain crisp and
fresh. I was disappointed with
the meager allotment of one
piece of bread per customer,
discovering that diners are en
couraged to purchase whole
baguettes (or half-baguettes)
decided to try the house
ie to accompany my meal
d found the Italian Frascati, a
(dium dry white wine, quite
lasant. My companion en

\s for dessert, we had dif
ulty choosing from among
e many mouth-watering
ections, but finally decided

P. 75); Zuppa Inglese -- a

Also available on the menu

nd diners may also opt for

and salad ($3.50), soup and
ortellini ($3.95), etc. Various
andwiches are also offered.

atmosphere was

all-Italian theme:

stone-tile floor
were imported
from Italy, Italian
prints line the walls.

to accompany the meal. (Clay
Patterson, co-owner, later ex
plained that this question of
whether or not to serve baskets
of bread was still undecided.)
Both the eggplant and
lasagne were outstanding,
athough we both preferred the
rich flavor of the lasagne. We

also sampled the three varieties
of tortellini (pasta stuffed with
veal and chicken, available in
various size dishes). Of the
three sauces, we favored the al
Sicialana -- a wonderful pink
sponge cake surrounding a
creamy mocha
rum filling ($1.75). A variety of
coffees are available as well, in-

eluding caffe mocha, caffe
latte, and others, ranging from
$1 to $1.75 each.
Since everything here is a la
carte, meal prices can run any
where from $4 to $10, depend
ing on your appetite. Caffe
Santa Maddalena offers a flex
ible menu for a quick, light
lunch, a leisurely and satisfying
dinner, or anything in be
tween.
We truly enjoyed the entire
meal and the restaurant's clear
commitment to well-prepared
Italian food. Even the at
mosphere was consistent with
the all-Italian theme: the small
marble cafe tables and the
stone-tile floor were imported
from Italy, Italian prints linethe
walls, and Italian music plays in
the background.
My one hesitation about the
future of Caffe Santa Mad
dalena concerns its attempt to
present a compromise be
tween fast food and fine food.
Students may not appreciate a
cafeteria-away-from-home
when they are trying to escape
from food service and hashers,
and Palo Altans may consider
these prices rather high con
sidering the informality of the
place. Still, I found this ex
perience offered a nice com
bination of a tasty sit-down
meal and a quick cafeteria Ital

Caffe Santa Maddalena for all

cializing in fine Italian food and

Sandwiched between Mills

Maddalena now inhabits the

We were somewhat sur
prised by the cafeteria set-up,
expecting a more formal din

to trays, napkins and silver
ware, and introduced to the
menu and the food line.
Although neither I nor my

Bon Giorno,' the women be

make our way through the all-
Italian menu, explaining the a
la carte selections as we moved
down the line. (We later
learned that this was the ori
ginal line used in Bennington's
all these years.)
(An aside here: While we
loaded up our trays with the
entire meal (except dessert) in
one trip, customers may prefer
to select their meals course by
course, or some may choose to
order from their table and have
dishes brought to them by the
waitresses who are "more than
