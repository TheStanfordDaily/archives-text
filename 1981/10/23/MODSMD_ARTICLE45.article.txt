It's a classv place — right down to the valet
pjrking. You know, the kind of place you'd like to
take your parents the next time they come visiting.
But don't let that scare you off; actually this is also
the kind of place you can come to for a bowl of
chili or a hamburger. And besides, it's not often
you have the opportunity to dine in a national his
torical monument. (This is a building designed by
architect Julia Morgan.)
The interior has been restored to its original
structure, complete with high-beamed ceilings,
balconies, and huge fireplaces on opposite sides of
the wide open dining room. The room has been
sectioned off to give the feeling of intimacy
without sacrificing spaciousness. When the weath
er warms up again there will be food service on the
back patio as well.
Mac Arthur Park's menu is extensive as well as
versatile, and virtually everything is made in their
own kitchen — from Nanny's chili to Judy's Mud
Pie (more about that later). There is something
here sure to please everyone's tastes.
A fresh artichoke appetizer ($2.75) and a small
bowl of chili ($2.95) got our meal off to a great start.
The artichoke came with melted butter for dipping
as well as a delicious herbed mayonnaise, and the
chili was excellent: full of big chunks of meat and
mildly spicy.
We skipped soup (onion and gazpacho are avail
able) and went on to salad. Both the house salad
($2.25) and the wilted spinach salad (small: $2.75)
were good choices to accompany our meals. Oth
er salads offered, including the large version of tne
spinach salad, are easily ordered as meals in them
selves.
The menu displays a variety of specials, sand
wiches, and side orders in addition to the lengthy
list of ribs, steaks, etc. (Ribs are one of the things
Mac Arthur Park in San Francisco is famous for.)
Our party tried three of the house specialties: Ribs

and Chicken ($9.45), Porterhouse Steak ($14.95 for
22 ounces), and one of the fresh fish specials: New
Zealand grouper ($8.75).
Surprisingly, the ribs were not all that ex
traordinary, but the portion was generous. To
gether with the large piece of chicken, the
was more than satisfactory. The steak was huge (of
course), extremely well-prepared and served with
a pile of crispy onion strings (also available as a side
order for $1.75 and well worth trying). The grouper
— a very meaty fish, similar to shark — was de
licious: charbroiled and covered with sauteeed
mushrooms. On the side came an enormous
baked potato and a large stalk of broccoli (slightly
undercooked).
If this sounds like a tremendous amount of food,
it was. Still, we managed to save room for dessert,
and thoroughly enjoyed our choices. Judy's Mud
Pie ($2.50) lived up to its outstanding reputation:
chocolate and coffee ice cream in an oreo cookie
crust, covered with chocolate sauce and crushed
peanuts; the White Chocolate Ice Cream ($2.65)
was even better than it sounds: a very rich Italian
style ice cream sprinkled with shavings of white
chocolate -- highly recommended for ice cream

and chocolate lovers alike; last but not least, we
tried the Fruit Cobbler ($2): a warm mixture of
pears and apples in a crust and topped with a
dollop of fresh cream.
With our meal, we had a dry chenin blanc (from
Grand Cru's Vineyards), one of the least expensive
selections onthewinelistatslo.Wefoundit pleas
antly fruity without too much sugar.
Service throughout the meal was very good; our
waitress was both personable and knowledgeable
about the menu. We noticed an assortment of
crayons was available at every table -- for children
of all ages (including grownups) to doodle with.
(The white placemats were hard to resist.) Accord
ing to our waitress, the crayon idea caught on with
lunchtime customers, and soon dinner patrons
were demanding equal playtime.
One of the nicest things about Mac Arthur Park
is its attention to the entire meal; side orders and
salads are prepared with as much care as the main
courses, and the net effect is one of quality and
elegance.

were good choices to accompany our meals. Oth
er salads offered, including the large version of tne
spinach salad, are easily ordered as meals in them
selves.
The menu displays a variety of specials, sand
wiches, and side orders in addition to the lengthy
list of ribs, steaks, etc. (Ribs are one of the things
Mac Arthur Park in San Francisco is famous for.)
Our party tried three of the house specialties: Ribs

and Chicken ($9.45), Porterhouse Steak ($14.95 for
22 ounces), and one of the fresh fish specials: New
Zealand grouper ($8.75).
Surprisingly, the ribs were not all that ex
traordinary, but the portion was generous. To
gether with the large piece of chicken, the
was more than satisfactory. The steak was huge (of
course), extremely well-prepared and served with
a pile of crispy onion strings (also available as a side
order for $1.75 and well worth trying). The grouper
— a very meaty fish, similar to shark — was de
licious: charbroiled and covered with sauteeed
mushrooms. On the side came an enormous
baked potato and a large stalk of broccoli (slightly
undercooked).
If this sounds like a tremendous amount of food,
it was. Still, we managed to save room for dessert,
and thoroughly enjoyed our choices. Judy's Mud
Pie ($2.50) lived up to its outstanding reputation:
chocolate and coffee ice cream in an oreo cookie
crust, covered with chocolate sauce and crushed
peanuts; the White Chocolate Ice Cream ($2.65)
was even better than it sounds: a very rich Italian
style ice cream sprinkled with shavings of white
chocolate -- highly recommended for ice cream

and chocolate lovers alike; last but not least, we
tried the Fruit Cobbler ($2): a warm mixture of
pears and apples in a crust and topped with a
dollop of fresh cream.
With our meal, we had a dry chenin blanc (from
Grand Cru's Vineyards), one of the least expensive
selections onthewinelistatslo.Wefoundit pleas
antly fruity without too much sugar.
Service throughout the meal was very good; our
waitress was both personable and knowledgeable
about the menu. We noticed an assortment of
crayons was available at every table -- for children
of all ages (including grownups) to doodle with.
(The white placemats were hard to resist.) Accord
ing to our waitress, the crayon idea caught on with
lunchtime customers, and soon dinner patrons
were demanding equal playtime.
One of the nicest things about Mac Arthur Park
is its attention to the entire meal; side orders and
salads are prepared with as much care as the main
courses, and the net effect is one of quality and
elegance.

MAC ARTHUR PARK
27 University Ave.

It's a classv place — right down to the valet
pjrking. You know, the kind of place you'd like to
take your parents the next time they come visiting.
But don't let that scare you off; actually this is also
the kind of place you can come to for a bowl of
chili or a hamburger. And besides, it's not often
you have the opportunity to dine in a national his
torical monument. (This is a building designed by
architect Julia Morgan.)
The interior has been restored to its original
structure, complete with high-beamed ceilings,
balconies, and huge fireplaces on opposite sides of
the wide open dining room. The room has been
sectioned off to give the feeling of intimacy
without sacrificing spaciousness. When the weath
er warms up again there will be food service on the
back patio as well.
Mac Arthur Park's menu is extensive as well as
versatile, and virtually everything is made in their
own kitchen — from Nanny's chili to Judy's Mud
Pie (more about that later). There is something
here sure to please everyone's tastes.
A fresh artichoke appetizer ($2.75) and a small
bowl of chili ($2.95) got our meal off to a great start.
The artichoke came with melted butter for dipping
as well as a delicious herbed mayonnaise, and the
chili was excellent: full of big chunks of meat and
mildly spicy.
We skipped soup (onion and gazpacho are avail
able) and went on to salad. Both the house salad
($2.25) and the wilted spinach salad (small: $2.75)
were good choices to accompany our meals. Oth
er salads offered, including the large version of tne
spinach salad, are easily ordered as meals in them
