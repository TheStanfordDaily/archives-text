Metropolis **★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Fritz Lang directed this 1926
epic, set around the year 2000.
The metropolisof the title is a city
inhabited by the very rich and
their machine-like slaves. Lang's
command of spectacle is very
keen: the crowd scenes have a
texture and personality all their
own. The film was extremely ex
pensive for its time (and it shows
it in its intricate sets and special
effects); its commercial failure so
shook the fortunes of the studio
that produced it, UFA, that it nev
er recovered.
Plays Monday only with The
Cabinet of Dr. Cafigari.

The 39 Steps ★***
Monday, Kresge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
' nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.

Arthur ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 19.16) us well as the 1V
serials and comics of the '50s. it
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
Geotge Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of 'he
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance; it's exciting.on the sur
face but dull at its center. For alt
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

For Your Eyes Only **
New Varsity ,1 Palo Alio
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Muonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic ot
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the producers plan to re
place him with a younger model
soonj. He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — for a
terrific, cliche-reversing car
chase where Bond is forced to ex
change his Lotus for a Citroen. If
the moviemakers had been as
playful with the Bond formula
through the rest of the film, For
Your Eyes Only might have
passed for ente.tainmeiH instead
of an exercise in cinematic stasis.

|obn fowled book is a Vic

the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,

adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and \rrna

during the filming of The trench
Lieutenant's Woman, 'f he charac

Gorton did the meticulous pro

a splendid score, and the photog

Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa

Close Encounters of the Third
Kind ****
Fox, Redwood Cily
Steven Spielberg recut his 1977
science-fantasy, removing cum
bersome sections and adding
new footage. There's more to the
movie's ending now, but thetwo
most striking additions are one
scene and a single shot. In the
new scene, Dreyfuss explains
how he grew up with Disney's
Pinocchio and we begin to get a
sense of the film's narrative roots.
The new shot, very bdef and tell
ing, shows the great shadow of a
spacecraft wedding the fantastic
and the commonplace as it glides
over Indiana farmlands. A terrific
movie.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

So Fine
Mountain View Theater
Dumb as hell, in appalling taste
— and hilarious. Andrew
Bergman wrote and directed this

ebullient nature of the comedy.
Ryan O'Neal, more assured than
usual, plays an English instructor
who is kidnapped by gangsters
and put to work in his father's
dress business. Bergman has sur
rounded O'Neal with a cast of
jokers worthy of Preston Sturges
— Mariangeia Melato, Jack War

Mommie Dearest *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks cn her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
oetrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her lears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 19.16) us well as the 1V
serials and comics of the '50s. it
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
Geotge Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of 'he
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance; it's exciting.on the sur
face but dull at its center. For alt
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

For Your Eyes Only **
New Varsity ,1 Palo Alio
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Muonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic ot
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the producers plan to re
place him with a younger model
soonj. He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — for a
terrific, cliche-reversing car
chase where Bond is forced to ex
change his Lotus for a Citroen. If
the moviemakers had been as
playful with the Bond formula
through the rest of the film, For
Your Eyes Only might have
passed for ente.tainmeiH instead
of an exercise in cinematic stasis.

Steven Spielberg recut his 1977
science-fantasy, removing cum
bersome sections and adding
new footage. There's more to the
movie's ending now, but thetwo
most striking additions are one
scene and a single shot. In the
new scene, Dreyfuss explains
how he grew up with Disney's
Pinocchio and we begin to get a
sense of the film's narrative roots.
The new shot, very bdef and tell

spacecraft wedding the fantastic
and the commonplace as it glides
over Indiana farmlands. A terrific
movie.
Plays Sunday and Monday with

So Fine
Mountain View Theater
Dumb as hell, in appalling taste
— and hilarious. Andrew

ebullient nature of the comedy.
Ryan O'Neal, more assured than
usual, plays an English instructor
who is kidnapped by gangsters
and put to work in his father's
dress business. Bergman has sur
rounded O'Neal with a cast of
jokers worthy of Preston Sturges
— Mariangeia Melato, Jack War

keeps them supplied with tip-top

Mommie Dearest *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks cn her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
oetrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her lears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.

The metropolisof the title is a city
inhabited by the very rich and
their machine-like slaves. Lang's
command of spectacle is very
keen: the crowd scenes have a
texture and personality all their

pensive for its time (and it shows
it in its intricate sets and special

The 39 Steps ★***
Monday, Kresge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
' nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.

Not a great movie, but often

us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when

Close Encounters of the Third

Fox, Redwood Cily
Steven Spielberg recut his 1977
science-fantasy, removing cum
bersome sections and adding
new footage. There's more to the
movie's ending now, but thetwo
most striking additions are one
scene and a single shot. In the
new scene, Dreyfuss explains
how he grew up with Disney's
Pinocchio and we begin to get a
sense of the film's narrative roots.
The new shot, very bdef and tell

spacecraft wedding the fantastic
and the commonplace as it glides
over Indiana farmlands. A terrific
movie.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

Dumb as hell, in appalling taste

Ryan O'Neal, more assured than
usual, plays an English instructor
who is kidnapped by gangsters

Mommie Dearest *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks cn her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
oetrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her lears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.

Fritz Lang directed this 1926
epic, set around the year 2000.
The metropolisof the title is a city
inhabited by the very rich and
their machine-like slaves. Lang's
command of spectacle is very
keen: the crowd scenes have a
texture and personality all their
own. The film was extremely ex
pensive for its time (and it shows
it in its intricate sets and special

The 39 Steps ★***
Monday, Kresge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
' nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.

Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,

comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when

Raiders is a tribute to the ad

It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance; it's exciting.on the sur

there's no denying that it s a mess

This 1919 horror film, with its

Mommie Dearest *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks cn her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
oetrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her lears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.

Fritz Lang directed this 1926
epic, set around the year 2000.
The metropolisof the title is a city
inhabited by the very rich and
their machine-like slaves. Lang's
command of spectacle is very
keen: the crowd scenes have a
texture and personality all their
own. The film was extremely ex
pensive for its time (and it shows

The 39 Steps ★***
Monday, Kresge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
' nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.

Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **

Raiders is a tribute to the ad

represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
Geotge Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of 'he
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance; it's exciting.on the sur

the hype about its adolescent

It's not as bloated as the last Bond

it's perhaps the least sadistic ot
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the producers plan to re
place him with a younger model
soonj. He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — for a
terrific, cliche-reversing car
chase where Bond is forced to ex
change his Lotus for a Citroen. If
the moviemakers had been as
playful with the Bond formula

epic, set around the year 2000.
The metropolisof the title is a city
inhabited by the very rich and
their machine-like slaves. Lang's
command of spectacle is very
keen: the crowd scenes have a
texture and personality all their
own. The film was extremely ex
pensive for its time (and it shows
it in its intricate sets and special
effects); its commercial failure so
shook the fortunes of the studio
that produced it, UFA, that it nev
er recovered.
Plays Monday only with The
Cabinet of Dr. Cafigari.

Gulla) who is married to a proud,
suffering countess (Margit Carl
quist!. All of the lovers meet for a
weekend at the country estate of
the countess' mother (Naima

I bittersweet comic roundelay is,
simply put, one of the greatest of
all movies.

The 39 Steps ★***
Monday, Kresge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high-spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
' nocence. Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.

Arthur ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Northern Lights ****
New Varsily, Palo Alto
Artful black and white photog
raphy combines with fresh direct
ing skills to create a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for
farmers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwoodeti but
non-professional actors appear
in this sometimes slow-moving
winner of last year's Cannes
Golden Camera awaid. See it tor
its human characterizations and
poignant plot.
Plays Tuesday through Thurs

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 19.16) us well as the 1V
serials and comics of the '50s. it
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
Geotge Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of 'he
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance; it's exciting.on the sur
face but dull at its center. For alt
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Rich and Famous ***
Bijou, Palo Alio
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never oars Out it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, ft isgracek'l
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to tht directoi,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply th**
best materia! he's ever worked
with — it's write-by-numbeis
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material —■ the brittle con
trivances of the Avres script are
softened by Cukor's patience,
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by capiive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness

For Your Eyes Only **
New Varsity ,1 Palo Alio
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Muonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic ot
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the producers plan to re
place him with a younger model
soonj. He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — for a
terrific, cliche-reversing car
chase where Bond is forced to ex
change his Lotus for a Citroen. If
the moviemakers had been as
playful with the Bond formula
through the rest of the film, For
Your Eyes Only might have
passed for ente.tainmeiH instead
of an exercise in cinematic stasis.
Starts next Thursday with John
Houston's Victory.

Gallipoli
Fin*- Arts, Palo A(U>
For the first hourand a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the oid
Gungj Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood widi this eclectic
rites-of-manhood materia! about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robr. them of
the.r youth. I he problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
give> us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes ra'her than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
< iiement Despite Weir's talent
and the lalent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
hiovie.

The French lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
|obn fowled book is a Vic
torian novel with its own buiit-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and \rrna
(Meryi Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The trench
Lieutenant's Woman, 'f he charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Cari Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Coliie r , who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dick en* character.

Close Encounters of the Third
Kind ****
Fox, Redwood Cily
Steven Spielberg recut his 1977
science-fantasy, removing cum
bersome sections and adding
new footage. There's more to the
movie's ending now, but thetwo
most striking additions are one
scene and a single shot. In the
new scene, Dreyfuss explains
how he grew up with Disney's
Pinocchio and we begin to get a
sense of the film's narrative roots.
The new shot, very bdef and tell
ing, shows the great shadow of a
spacecraft wedding the fantastic
and the commonplace as it glides
over Indiana farmlands. A terrific
movie.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

So Fine
Mountain View Theater
Dumb as hell, in appalling taste
— and hilarious. Andrew
Bergman wrote and directed this
series of sketches unified only by
the characters and the daffy,
ebullient nature of the comedy.
Ryan O'Neal, more assured than
usual, plays an English instructor
who is kidnapped by gangsters
and put to work in his father's
dress business. Bergman has sur
rounded O'Neal with a cast of
jokers worthy of Preston Sturges
— Mariangeia Melato, Jack War
den, Richard Kiel, Mike Kellin,
Fred Gwynne Angela Pietro Pinto
and Bruce Millhoiland — and
keeps them supplied with tip-top
dialogue.
Double-billed with 10.

Beat the Devil i
Saturday, Kresge
John Huston directed this very
odd knock-about comedy It's
never entirely clear what's hap
pening, or why. In its own screwy
way, the film is often funny and
sometimes endearing — but
there's no denying that it s a mess
of a movie. The script, by Truman
Capote, is said to have been writ
ten the night before and handed
to the actors on ihe set, which
probably explains the somewhat
more-ihan-usually bemused ex
pression Humphrey Bogait a!
fects throughout Jennifer Jones,
here a blond, co-stars

The Cabinet of Dr. Caliban
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This 1919 horror film, with its
\.rrikirig impressionistic back
grounds. was an immense in
fluence on German cinema up
through the time Hitier came to
power. Its story is narrated by a
madman, and its strange, dis
torted sets and meandering stot y
reflect a madman's view of a
malevolent world.
Plays Monday only with Me
tropolis.

Altered Stales *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Ken Russeil (Women i/> low,
lummy) directed; Paddy
Chayefsky (Marty) wrote the
script This tale of a man who
turns into an ape and does other,
equally eccentric tnings after he
fakes a rare- drug reflects the
worst aspects of both its creators
Russell gives it pointless visual
flamboyance; C'navefsky lends it
pointless visual discussions
(' What is man? Is there a God?
When do we eat?"), its special ef
fects, however, are very pretty —
the movie practically begs you to
stop thinking long enough to en
joy them — and ihe soundtiack
(" Megasound") is loud and
creepy. It's amazing what great
things you can do wiih no ideas at
i all.

Mommie Dearest *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks cn her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
oetrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her lears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.
