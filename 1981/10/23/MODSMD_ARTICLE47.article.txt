Global economics discussed
Cancun, Mexico — President Ronald Reagan
set U.S. conditions yester day for participation in
progress toward global negotiations on world
economic problems, a process sponsored by
the developing world and endorsed by Wash
ington's allies.
In conciliatory far different in tone
from his Philadelphia speech last week on eco
nomic development, the president said he
takes seriously the commitment to move
toward global negotiations. But, he posed con
ditions that made clear United States remains
the most reluctant partner in a process that
would be designed to give the world's poorer
nations more power over the world's economy.
Reagan's speech at the opening session of the
22-nation summit on international cooperation
and development here, was one U.S. officials
want perceived as a step toward meeting the
demands of other nations for global nego
tiations, but foreign leaders immediately fell to
debating how large a s'ep Reagan had taken.
Global negotiations have become the central
issue of this summit, and initial reaction ranged
from pleasure that Reagan had not closed the
door on further progress to suspicions that his
stand was primarily a damage-limiting measure
aimed to keep Canc un from ending as a summit
in which the United States stood alone.
U.S officials said they anticipate a "very
positive" reaction, because Reagan is willing to
continue the dialogue even if he doesn't sup
port global negotiations coordinated through'
the United Nations, a framework the poor na
tions want. As a result of Reagan's speech, U.S.
officials said, they expect talk o* the "new in
ternational economic order,' which the United
States resists, will diminish.
Modernized weapons urged
London — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger warned here yesterday that failure to
modernize NATO's nuclear program would
greatly reduce the prospects of Soviet-Ameri
can taiks for controlling nuclear arms in Europe.
He also said such inactivity would invite Soviet
aggression.
He exposed more publicly than before the
U.S. strategy for getting wavering European na
tions to deploy 572 U.S. ballistic and cruise mis
siles Otherwise, he said, the arms control talks
will be "vastly more difficult, to put it mildly."
If nations such as Holland and Belgium shirk
on their 1979 commitment to accept 48 cruise
missiles each, he impiied, then the arms reduc
tion talks starting November 30 between the
United States and the Soviet Union would be
jeopardized.
Weinberger spoke here to the Royal Institute
of International Affairs (RIIA) one day after a
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear
meeting in Scotland presented a united front
on the most contentious issue facing the North
Atlantic alliance.
In a communique the meeting,
NATO defense ministers reaffirmed the 1979
NATO decision to modernize medium-range
nuclear missiles while pursuing bilateral efforts
to reduce these weapons on both sides.
Medfly copter crashes
Fremont — A Medfly helicopter returning to
base after spraying malathion crashed into a
house, killing the pilot and injuring seven peo
ple yesterday, officials reported.
Medfly project director Jerry Scribner said
the crash does not mean the controversial
spraying program is unsafe, and he said heli
copters will continue spraying the pesticide
malathion to help eradicate the Mediterranean
fruit fly.
The Bell 205 chopper apparently ran into en
gine trouble in thick fog, ripped through a
power line and tumbled into the house, police
and fire officials said.
The Alameda County Coroner's office identi
fied the pilot as Charles Donald Faircloth, 35, or
iginally of Salemburg, North Carolina. He was
alone in the craft when it crashed.

Cut in student funds proposed
Washington — In keeping with the adminis
tration's latest budget-cut request, the Educa
tion Department has proposed regulations that
would lop more than 700,000 college students
off the list of those eligible to receive federal
higher education grants for the needy.
The regulations assume Congress will accept
the Reagan administration's funding levef of
$2,187 billion for the program this fiscal year.
Congressional aides and higher education lob
byists said they doubt the administration figure
will be approved.
Under the proposed rules for the so-called
Pell grants, about 1.958 million students would
be eligible for the 8-year-old program, accord
ing to a department spokesman, compared with
the 2.7 million students who received $2.4
billion in grants this fall. The maximum grant
would remain at $1,670 a year.
A typical family of four, with both parents
working and one college student, would be
eligible for a grant only if its income was less
than $15,860, according to the regulations. Cur
rently, the same family can make up to about
$28,000 and still be eligible.
Secretary Terrel Bell has offered an alternate
plan, requiring congressional approval, to
"create a more equitable distribution of limited
Pell grant funds." He said that if changes were
approved that would count more family assets
in determining need, more students could get
grants and families of four making up to $27,054
would be eligible. The spokesman said the
changes would mean 2.5 million students
would be able to get grants, but the grants
would be smaller.
Strikes plague Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa urged restraint yesterday as union radi
cals considered calling a nationwide walkout
over food shortages. More than 150,000 Polish
workers began a province-wide general strike
and 2,000 drivers blared horns on Warsaw's
main freeway in defiance of Communist author
ities.
"Let's be reasonable and let's not cross the
borders of the line of agreement," Waiesa told
Solidarity leaders meeting in the Baltic port of
Gdansk to discuss a proposed one-hour strike
next Wednesday over food shortages. The gov
ernment has warned it might impose martial
law unless the strikes are halted.
Meanwhile, some 150,000 workers at 700 fac
tories began a province-wide general strike in
western Zielona Cora demanding the dismissal
of officials who fired a Solidarity manager at a
state farm, even though he was reinstated.
About 12,000 women workers occupied
garment factories in Zyrardow, 20 miles west of
Warsaw, for the 10th day protesting food short
ages.
Lower budget deficit planned
Washington — Republican Congressional
leaders reached tentative agreement yesterday
on an alternative to President Ronald Reagan's
latest government austerity plan that would
lower projected budget deficits by $115 billion
over the next three years.
Even so, said Senate Majority leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), deficits will be so big that it
may not be possible to balance the budget in
fiscal year 1984 as the president promised.
The GOP leaders yielded to House Re
publicans' protests and deferred any action on
tax increases until next year and aimed for
much smaller spending cuts than the $13 billion
reduction Reagan proposed for this fiscal year.
"The deficit may run as high as $80 billion in
(the current) fiscal year 1982," Baker said. Presi
dent Reagan has estimated the deficit at $59
billion if no further budget cuts are made.
While Baker refused to divulge specific num
bers until he presents the plan to Reagan early
next week, one Republican participant said the
target for spending reductions this fiscal
would be $8 billion, or $5 billion less than Rea
gan asked.
The GOP leaders also agreed to try to make a
"down payment" on reducing public benefit

Hijack attempt thwarted
New York — An man who attempted to hijack
an American Airlines DC-10 jumbo jet flying
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to New York City
early today was seized shortly after the airplane
landed here, police reported.
The man, who claimed he had an explosive
device and two accomplices among the flight's
passengers, demanded to be taken to Quebec,
Canada, police said. The pilot apparently was
able to convince the hijacker that they should
land at Kennedy International Airport because
of bad weather beyond New York City.
The jet. American Flight 676 due to arrive at
Kennedy at 3:08 a.m. EDT today, landed around
2:45 a.m.
Around 3:05 a.m. the hijacker was seized and
the 98 passenger and 11 crew members were al
lowed to leave the airpane, according to police
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jer
sey, operators of the airport.
The suspect was not immediately identified.
No explosives were found aboard the plane.
Stance on voting rights denied
Washington — Attorney General William
Smith backed away yesterday from President
Ronald Reagan's charge that House-passed leg
islation extending the Voting Rights Act was
"extreme."
"I don't believe that the president ever said
any such thing," Smith said when asked after a
National Press Club speech about Reagan's
criticism of the House action. "The fact is that
he has not as yet taken a position on that ques
tion."
Reagan, in a meeting with newspaper editors,
discussed the House's rejection of amendments
that would have weakened the 1965 law and its
decision to extend the statute.
"I think (the House) has maybe been pretty
extreme in what it's done," he said, according
to a transcript of the meeting made available by
the White House. "I'm hopeful that the Senate
is going to be more reasonable in what's done."
PATCO loses representation
Washington — A federal labor panel voted
2-1 yesterday tostrip the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization of its right to repre
sent air controllers because of the union's call
for an illegal strike against the government.
The order by the Federal Labor Relations Au
thority said federal law and the union's actions
in calling a nationwide strike last August "plain
ly requires revocation of PATCO's status" as the
air controllers' collective bargaining represent
ative.
Before the ruling was announced, PATCO at
torney Richard Leighton had indicated the
union would appeal immediately to the U.S.
Court of Appeals to stay the agency's order.
The panel's order marked the first time the
government has put a union out of business by
permanently stripping it of its bargaining au
thority.
Stocks still falling steadily
New York — Stock prices retreated yesterday
as evidence continued to accumulate of a
weakening economy.
Several individual issues dropped in response
to earnings disappointments or announce
ments that quashed takeover speculation.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
.85 Wednesday, slipped another 2.76 to 848.27.
Losers held a 2-1 edge on gainers in the daily
tally at the New York Stock Exchange, and the
Big Board's composite index dropped .27 to
69.39.

Global economics discussed
Cancun, Mexico — President Ronald Reagan
set U.S. conditions yester day for participation in
progress toward global negotiations on world
economic problems, a process sponsored by
the developing world and endorsed by Wash
ington's allies.
In conciliatory far different in tone
from his Philadelphia speech last week on eco
nomic development, the president said he
takes seriously the commitment to move
toward global negotiations. But, he posed con
ditions that made clear United States remains
the most reluctant partner in a process that
would be designed to give the world's poorer
nations more power over the world's economy.
Reagan's speech at the opening session of the
22-nation summit on international cooperation
and development here, was one U.S. officials
want perceived as a step toward meeting the
demands of other nations for global nego
tiations, but foreign leaders immediately fell to
debating how large a s'ep Reagan had taken.
Global negotiations have become the central
issue of this summit, and initial reaction ranged
from pleasure that Reagan had not closed the
door on further progress to suspicions that his
stand was primarily a damage-limiting measure
aimed to keep Canc un from ending as a summit
in which the United States stood alone.
U.S officials said they anticipate a "very
positive" reaction, because Reagan is willing to
continue the dialogue even if he doesn't sup
port global negotiations coordinated through'
the United Nations, a framework the poor na
tions want. As a result of Reagan's speech, U.S.
officials said, they expect talk o* the "new in
ternational economic order,' which the United
States resists, will diminish.
Modernized weapons urged
London — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger warned here yesterday that failure to
modernize NATO's nuclear program would
greatly reduce the prospects of Soviet-Ameri
can taiks for controlling nuclear arms in Europe.
He also said such inactivity would invite Soviet
aggression.
He exposed more publicly than before the
U.S. strategy for getting wavering European na
tions to deploy 572 U.S. ballistic and cruise mis
siles Otherwise, he said, the arms control talks
will be "vastly more difficult, to put it mildly."
If nations such as Holland and Belgium shirk
on their 1979 commitment to accept 48 cruise
missiles each, he impiied, then the arms reduc
tion talks starting November 30 between the
United States and the Soviet Union would be
jeopardized.
Weinberger spoke here to the Royal Institute
of International Affairs (RIIA) one day after a
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear
meeting in Scotland presented a united front
on the most contentious issue facing the North
Atlantic alliance.
In a communique the meeting,
NATO defense ministers reaffirmed the 1979
NATO decision to modernize medium-range
nuclear missiles while pursuing bilateral efforts
to reduce these weapons on both sides.
Medfly copter crashes
Fremont — A Medfly helicopter returning to
base after spraying malathion crashed into a
house, killing the pilot and injuring seven peo
ple yesterday, officials reported.
Medfly project director Jerry Scribner said
the crash does not mean the controversial
spraying program is unsafe, and he said heli
copters will continue spraying the pesticide
malathion to help eradicate the Mediterranean
fruit fly.
The Bell 205 chopper apparently ran into en
gine trouble in thick fog, ripped through a
power line and tumbled into the house, police
and fire officials said.
The Alameda County Coroner's office identi
fied the pilot as Charles Donald Faircloth, 35, or
iginally of Salemburg, North Carolina. He was
alone in the craft when it crashed.

Cut in student funds proposed
Washington — In keeping with the adminis
tration's latest budget-cut request, the Educa
tion Department has proposed regulations that
would lop more than 700,000 college students
off the list of those eligible to receive federal
higher education grants for the needy.
The regulations assume Congress will accept
the Reagan administration's funding levef of
$2,187 billion for the program this fiscal year.
Congressional aides and higher education lob
byists said they doubt the administration figure
will be approved.
Under the proposed rules for the so-called
Pell grants, about 1.958 million students would
be eligible for the 8-year-old program, accord
ing to a department spokesman, compared with
the 2.7 million students who received $2.4
billion in grants this fall. The maximum grant
would remain at $1,670 a year.
A typical family of four, with both parents
working and one college student, would be
eligible for a grant only if its income was less
than $15,860, according to the regulations. Cur
rently, the same family can make up to about
$28,000 and still be eligible.
Secretary Terrel Bell has offered an alternate
plan, requiring congressional approval, to
"create a more equitable distribution of limited
Pell grant funds." He said that if changes were
approved that would count more family assets
in determining need, more students could get
grants and families of four making up to $27,054
would be eligible. The spokesman said the
changes would mean 2.5 million students
would be able to get grants, but the grants
would be smaller.
Strikes plague Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa urged restraint yesterday as union radi
cals considered calling a nationwide walkout
over food shortages. More than 150,000 Polish
workers began a province-wide general strike
and 2,000 drivers blared horns on Warsaw's
main freeway in defiance of Communist author
ities.
"Let's be reasonable and let's not cross the
borders of the line of agreement," Waiesa told
Solidarity leaders meeting in the Baltic port of
Gdansk to discuss a proposed one-hour strike
next Wednesday over food shortages. The gov
ernment has warned it might impose martial
law unless the strikes are halted.
Meanwhile, some 150,000 workers at 700 fac
tories began a province-wide general strike in
western Zielona Cora demanding the dismissal
of officials who fired a Solidarity manager at a
state farm, even though he was reinstated.
About 12,000 women workers occupied
garment factories in Zyrardow, 20 miles west of
Warsaw, for the 10th day protesting food short
ages.
Lower budget deficit planned
Washington — Republican Congressional
leaders reached tentative agreement yesterday
on an alternative to President Ronald Reagan's
latest government austerity plan that would
lower projected budget deficits by $115 billion
over the next three years.
Even so, said Senate Majority leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), deficits will be so big that it
may not be possible to balance the budget in
fiscal year 1984 as the president promised.
The GOP leaders yielded to House Re
publicans' protests and deferred any action on
tax increases until next year and aimed for
much smaller spending cuts than the $13 billion
reduction Reagan proposed for this fiscal year.
"The deficit may run as high as $80 billion in
(the current) fiscal year 1982," Baker said. Presi
dent Reagan has estimated the deficit at $59
billion if no further budget cuts are made.
While Baker refused to divulge specific num
bers until he presents the plan to Reagan early
next week, one Republican participant said the
target for spending reductions this fiscal
would be $8 billion, or $5 billion less than Rea
gan asked.
The GOP leaders also agreed to try to make a
"down payment" on reducing public benefit

Hijack attempt thwarted
New York — An man who attempted to hijack
an American Airlines DC-10 jumbo jet flying
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to New York City
early today was seized shortly after the airplane
landed here, police reported.
The man, who claimed he had an explosive
device and two accomplices among the flight's
passengers, demanded to be taken to Quebec,
Canada, police said. The pilot apparently was
able to convince the hijacker that they should
land at Kennedy International Airport because
of bad weather beyond New York City.
The jet. American Flight 676 due to arrive at
Kennedy at 3:08 a.m. EDT today, landed around
2:45 a.m.
Around 3:05 a.m. the hijacker was seized and
the 98 passenger and 11 crew members were al
lowed to leave the airpane, according to police
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jer
sey, operators of the airport.
The suspect was not immediately identified.
No explosives were found aboard the plane.
Stance on voting rights denied
Washington — Attorney General William
Smith backed away yesterday from President
Ronald Reagan's charge that House-passed leg
islation extending the Voting Rights Act was
"extreme."
"I don't believe that the president ever said
any such thing," Smith said when asked after a
National Press Club speech about Reagan's
criticism of the House action. "The fact is that
he has not as yet taken a position on that ques
tion."
Reagan, in a meeting with newspaper editors,
discussed the House's rejection of amendments
that would have weakened the 1965 law and its
decision to extend the statute.
"I think (the House) has maybe been pretty
extreme in what it's done," he said, according
to a transcript of the meeting made available by
the White House. "I'm hopeful that the Senate
is going to be more reasonable in what's done."
PATCO loses representation
Washington — A federal labor panel voted
2-1 yesterday tostrip the Professional Air Traffic

Washington — Attorney General William
Smith backed away yesterday from President
Ronald Reagan's charge that House-passed leg
islation extending the Voting Rights Act was
"extreme."
"I don't believe that the president ever said
any such thing," Smith said when asked after a
National Press Club speech about Reagan's
criticism of the House action. "The fact is that
he has not as yet taken a position on that ques
tion."
Reagan, in a meeting with newspaper editors,
discussed the House's rejection of amendments
that would have weakened the 1965 law and its
decision to extend the statute.
"I think (the House) has maybe been pretty
extreme in what it's done," he said, according
to a transcript of the meeting made available by
the White House. "I'm hopeful that the Senate
is going to be more reasonable in what's done."
PATCO loses representation
Washington — A federal labor panel voted
2-1 yesterday tostrip the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization of its right to repre
sent air controllers because of the union's call
for an illegal strike against the government.
The order by the Federal Labor Relations Au
thority said federal law and the union's actions
in calling a nationwide strike last August "plain
ly requires revocation of PATCO's status" as the
air controllers' collective bargaining represent
ative.
Before the ruling was announced, PATCO at
torney Richard Leighton had indicated the
union would appeal immediately to the U.S.
Court of Appeals to stay the agency's order.
The panel's order marked the first time the
government has put a union out of business by
permanently stripping it of its bargaining au
thority.

Global economics discussed
Cancun, Mexico — President Ronald Reagan
set U.S. conditions yester day for participation in
progress toward global negotiations on world
economic problems, a process sponsored by
the developing world and endorsed by Wash
ington's allies.
In conciliatory far different in tone
from his Philadelphia speech last week on eco
nomic development, the president said he
takes seriously the commitment to move
toward global negotiations. But, he posed con
ditions that made clear United States remains
the most reluctant partner in a process that
would be designed to give the world's poorer
nations more power over the world's economy.
Reagan's speech at the opening session of the
22-nation summit on international cooperation
and development here, was one U.S. officials
want perceived as a step toward meeting the
demands of other nations for global nego
tiations, but foreign leaders immediately fell to
debating how large a s'ep Reagan had taken.
Global negotiations have become the central
issue of this summit, and initial reaction ranged
from pleasure that Reagan had not closed the
door on further progress to suspicions that his
stand was primarily a damage-limiting measure
aimed to keep Canc un from ending as a summit
in which the United States stood alone.
U.S officials said they anticipate a "very
positive" reaction, because Reagan is willing to
continue the dialogue even if he doesn't sup
port global negotiations coordinated through'
the United Nations, a framework the poor na
tions want. As a result of Reagan's speech, U.S.
officials said, they expect talk o* the "new in
ternational economic order,' which the United
States resists, will diminish.
Modernized weapons urged
London — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger warned here yesterday that failure to
modernize NATO's nuclear program would
greatly reduce the prospects of Soviet-Ameri
can taiks for controlling nuclear arms in Europe.
He also said such inactivity would invite Soviet
aggression.
He exposed more publicly than before the
U.S. strategy for getting wavering European na
tions to deploy 572 U.S. ballistic and cruise mis
siles Otherwise, he said, the arms control talks
will be "vastly more difficult, to put it mildly."
If nations such as Holland and Belgium shirk
on their 1979 commitment to accept 48 cruise
missiles each, he impiied, then the arms reduc
tion talks starting November 30 between the
United States and the Soviet Union would be
jeopardized.
Weinberger spoke here to the Royal Institute
of International Affairs (RIIA) one day after a
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear
meeting in Scotland presented a united front
on the most contentious issue facing the North
Atlantic alliance.
In a communique the meeting,
NATO defense ministers reaffirmed the 1979
NATO decision to modernize medium-range
nuclear missiles while pursuing bilateral efforts
to reduce these weapons on both sides.
Medfly copter crashes
Fremont — A Medfly helicopter returning to
base after spraying malathion crashed into a
house, killing the pilot and injuring seven peo
ple yesterday, officials reported.
Medfly project director Jerry Scribner said
the crash does not mean the controversial
spraying program is unsafe, and he said heli
copters will continue spraying the pesticide
malathion to help eradicate the Mediterranean
fruit fly.
The Bell 205 chopper apparently ran into en
gine trouble in thick fog, ripped through a
power line and tumbled into the house, police
and fire officials said.
The Alameda County Coroner's office identi
fied the pilot as Charles Donald Faircloth, 35, or
iginally of Salemburg, North Carolina. He was
alone in the craft when it crashed.

Cut in student funds proposed
Washington — In keeping with the adminis
tration's latest budget-cut request, the Educa
tion Department has proposed regulations that
would lop more than 700,000 college students
off the list of those eligible to receive federal
higher education grants for the needy.
The regulations assume Congress will accept
the Reagan administration's funding levef of
$2,187 billion for the program this fiscal year.
Congressional aides and higher education lob
byists said they doubt the administration figure
will be approved.
Under the proposed rules for the so-called
Pell grants, about 1.958 million students would
be eligible for the 8-year-old program, accord
ing to a department spokesman, compared with
the 2.7 million students who received $2.4
billion in grants this fall. The maximum grant
would remain at $1,670 a year.
A typical family of four, with both parents
working and one college student, would be
eligible for a grant only if its income was less
than $15,860, according to the regulations. Cur
rently, the same family can make up to about
$28,000 and still be eligible.
Secretary Terrel Bell has offered an alternate
plan, requiring congressional approval, to
"create a more equitable distribution of limited
Pell grant funds." He said that if changes were
approved that would count more family assets
in determining need, more students could get
grants and families of four making up to $27,054
would be eligible. The spokesman said the
changes would mean 2.5 million students
would be able to get grants, but the grants
would be smaller.
Strikes plague Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa urged restraint yesterday as union radi
cals considered calling a nationwide walkout
over food shortages. More than 150,000 Polish
workers began a province-wide general strike
and 2,000 drivers blared horns on Warsaw's
main freeway in defiance of Communist author
ities.
"Let's be reasonable and let's not cross the
borders of the line of agreement," Waiesa told
Solidarity leaders meeting in the Baltic port of
Gdansk to discuss a proposed one-hour strike
next Wednesday over food shortages. The gov
ernment has warned it might impose martial
law unless the strikes are halted.
Meanwhile, some 150,000 workers at 700 fac
tories began a province-wide general strike in
western Zielona Cora demanding the dismissal
of officials who fired a Solidarity manager at a
state farm, even though he was reinstated.
About 12,000 women workers occupied
garment factories in Zyrardow, 20 miles west of
Warsaw, for the 10th day protesting food short
ages.
Lower budget deficit planned
Washington — Republican Congressional
leaders reached tentative agreement yesterday
on an alternative to President Ronald Reagan's
latest government austerity plan that would
lower projected budget deficits by $115 billion
over the next three years.
Even so, said Senate Majority leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), deficits will be so big that it
may not be possible to balance the budget in
fiscal year 1984 as the president promised.
The GOP leaders yielded to House Re
publicans' protests and deferred any action on
tax increases until next year and aimed for
much smaller spending cuts than the $13 billion
reduction Reagan proposed for this fiscal year.
"The deficit may run as high as $80 billion in
(the current) fiscal year 1982," Baker said. Presi
dent Reagan has estimated the deficit at $59
billion if no further budget cuts are made.
While Baker refused to divulge specific num
bers until he presents the plan to Reagan early
next week, one Republican participant said the
target for spending reductions this fiscal
would be $8 billion, or $5 billion less than Rea
gan asked.
The GOP leaders also agreed to try to make a
"down payment" on reducing public benefit

Hijack attempt thwarted
New York — An man who attempted to hijack
an American Airlines DC-10 jumbo jet flying
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to New York City
early today was seized shortly after the airplane
landed here, police reported.
The man, who claimed he had an explosive
device and two accomplices among the flight's
passengers, demanded to be taken to Quebec,
Canada, police said. The pilot apparently was
able to convince the hijacker that they should
land at Kennedy International Airport because
of bad weather beyond New York City.
The jet. American Flight 676 due to arrive at
Kennedy at 3:08 a.m. EDT today, landed around
2:45 a.m.
Around 3:05 a.m. the hijacker was seized and
the 98 passenger and 11 crew members were al
lowed to leave the airpane, according to police
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jer
sey, operators of the airport.
The suspect was not immediately identified.
No explosives were found aboard the plane.

would be $8 billion, or $5 billion less than Rea

Hijack attempt thwarted
New York — An man who attempted to hijack
an American Airlines DC-10 jumbo jet flying
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to New York City
early today was seized shortly after the airplane
landed here, police reported.
The man, who claimed he had an explosive
device and two accomplices among the flight's
passengers, demanded to be taken to Quebec,
Canada, police said. The pilot apparently was
able to convince the hijacker that they should
land at Kennedy International Airport because
of bad weather beyond New York City.
The jet. American Flight 676 due to arrive at
Kennedy at 3:08 a.m. EDT today, landed around
2:45 a.m.
Around 3:05 a.m. the hijacker was seized and
the 98 passenger and 11 crew members were al
lowed to leave the airpane, according to police
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jer
sey, operators of the airport.
The suspect was not immediately identified.
No explosives were found aboard the plane.
Stance on voting rights denied
Washington — Attorney General William
Smith backed away yesterday from President
Ronald Reagan's charge that House-passed leg
islation extending the Voting Rights Act was
"extreme."
"I don't believe that the president ever said
any such thing," Smith said when asked after a
National Press Club speech about Reagan's
criticism of the House action. "The fact is that
he has not as yet taken a position on that ques
tion."
Reagan, in a meeting with newspaper editors,
discussed the House's rejection of amendments
that would have weakened the 1965 law and its
decision to extend the statute.
"I think (the House) has maybe been pretty
extreme in what it's done," he said, according
to a transcript of the meeting made available by
the White House. "I'm hopeful that the Senate
is going to be more reasonable in what's done."
PATCO loses representation
Washington — A federal labor panel voted
2-1 yesterday tostrip the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization of its right to repre
sent air controllers because of the union's call
for an illegal strike against the government.
The order by the Federal Labor Relations Au
thority said federal law and the union's actions
in calling a nationwide strike last August "plain
ly requires revocation of PATCO's status" as the
air controllers' collective bargaining represent
ative.
Before the ruling was announced, PATCO at
torney Richard Leighton had indicated the
union would appeal immediately to the U.S.
Court of Appeals to stay the agency's order.
The panel's order marked the first time the
government has put a union out of business by
permanently stripping it of its bargaining au
thority.

Global economics discussed
Cancun, Mexico — President Ronald Reagan
set U.S. conditions yester day for participation in
progress toward global negotiations on world
economic problems, a process sponsored by
the developing world and endorsed by Wash
ington's allies.
In conciliatory far different in tone
from his Philadelphia speech last week on eco
nomic development, the president said he
takes seriously the commitment to move
toward global negotiations. But, he posed con
ditions that made clear United States remains
the most reluctant partner in a process that
would be designed to give the world's poorer
nations more power over the world's economy.
Reagan's speech at the opening session of the
22-nation summit on international cooperation
and development here, was one U.S. officials
want perceived as a step toward meeting the
demands of other nations for global nego
tiations, but foreign leaders immediately fell to
debating how large a s'ep Reagan had taken.
Global negotiations have become the central
issue of this summit, and initial reaction ranged
from pleasure that Reagan had not closed the
door on further progress to suspicions that his
stand was primarily a damage-limiting measure
aimed to keep Canc un from ending as a summit
in which the United States stood alone.
U.S officials said they anticipate a "very
positive" reaction, because Reagan is willing to
continue the dialogue even if he doesn't sup
port global negotiations coordinated through'
the United Nations, a framework the poor na
tions want. As a result of Reagan's speech, U.S.
officials said, they expect talk o* the "new in
ternational economic order,' which the United
States resists, will diminish.
Modernized weapons urged
London — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger warned here yesterday that failure to
modernize NATO's nuclear program would
greatly reduce the prospects of Soviet-Ameri
can taiks for controlling nuclear arms in Europe.
He also said such inactivity would invite Soviet
aggression.
He exposed more publicly than before the
U.S. strategy for getting wavering European na
tions to deploy 572 U.S. ballistic and cruise mis
siles Otherwise, he said, the arms control talks
will be "vastly more difficult, to put it mildly."
If nations such as Holland and Belgium shirk
on their 1979 commitment to accept 48 cruise
missiles each, he impiied, then the arms reduc
tion talks starting November 30 between the
United States and the Soviet Union would be
jeopardized.
Weinberger spoke here to the Royal Institute
of International Affairs (RIIA) one day after a
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear
meeting in Scotland presented a united front
on the most contentious issue facing the North
Atlantic alliance.
In a communique the meeting,
NATO defense ministers reaffirmed the 1979
NATO decision to modernize medium-range
nuclear missiles while pursuing bilateral efforts
to reduce these weapons on both sides.
Medfly copter crashes
Fremont — A Medfly helicopter returning to
base after spraying malathion crashed into a
house, killing the pilot and injuring seven peo
ple yesterday, officials reported.
Medfly project director Jerry Scribner said
the crash does not mean the controversial
spraying program is unsafe, and he said heli
copters will continue spraying the pesticide
malathion to help eradicate the Mediterranean
fruit fly.
The Bell 205 chopper apparently ran into en
gine trouble in thick fog, ripped through a
power line and tumbled into the house, police
and fire officials said.
The Alameda County Coroner's office identi
fied the pilot as Charles Donald Faircloth, 35, or
iginally of Salemburg, North Carolina. He was
alone in the craft when it crashed.

Cut in student funds proposed
Washington — In keeping with the adminis
tration's latest budget-cut request, the Educa
tion Department has proposed regulations that
would lop more than 700,000 college students
off the list of those eligible to receive federal
higher education grants for the needy.
The regulations assume Congress will accept
the Reagan administration's funding levef of
$2,187 billion for the program this fiscal year.
Congressional aides and higher education lob
byists said they doubt the administration figure
will be approved.
Under the proposed rules for the so-called
Pell grants, about 1.958 million students would
be eligible for the 8-year-old program, accord
ing to a department spokesman, compared with
the 2.7 million students who received $2.4
billion in grants this fall. The maximum grant
would remain at $1,670 a year.
A typical family of four, with both parents
working and one college student, would be
eligible for a grant only if its income was less
than $15,860, according to the regulations. Cur
rently, the same family can make up to about
$28,000 and still be eligible.
Secretary Terrel Bell has offered an alternate
plan, requiring congressional approval, to
"create a more equitable distribution of limited
Pell grant funds." He said that if changes were
approved that would count more family assets
in determining need, more students could get
grants and families of four making up to $27,054
would be eligible. The spokesman said the
changes would mean 2.5 million students
would be able to get grants, but the grants
would be smaller.
Strikes plague Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa urged restraint yesterday as union radi
cals considered calling a nationwide walkout
over food shortages. More than 150,000 Polish
workers began a province-wide general strike
and 2,000 drivers blared horns on Warsaw's
main freeway in defiance of Communist author
ities.
"Let's be reasonable and let's not cross the
borders of the line of agreement," Waiesa told
Solidarity leaders meeting in the Baltic port of
Gdansk to discuss a proposed one-hour strike
next Wednesday over food shortages. The gov
ernment has warned it might impose martial
law unless the strikes are halted.
Meanwhile, some 150,000 workers at 700 fac
tories began a province-wide general strike in
western Zielona Cora demanding the dismissal
of officials who fired a Solidarity manager at a
state farm, even though he was reinstated.
About 12,000 women workers occupied
garment factories in Zyrardow, 20 miles west of
Warsaw, for the 10th day protesting food short
ages.
Lower budget deficit planned
Washington — Republican Congressional
leaders reached tentative agreement yesterday
on an alternative to President Ronald Reagan's
latest government austerity plan that would
lower projected budget deficits by $115 billion
over the next three years.
Even so, said Senate Majority leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), deficits will be so big that it
may not be possible to balance the budget in
fiscal year 1984 as the president promised.
The GOP leaders yielded to House Re
publicans' protests and deferred any action on
tax increases until next year and aimed for
much smaller spending cuts than the $13 billion
reduction Reagan proposed for this fiscal year.
"The deficit may run as high as $80 billion in
(the current) fiscal year 1982," Baker said. Presi
dent Reagan has estimated the deficit at $59
billion if no further budget cuts are made.
While Baker refused to divulge specific num
bers until he presents the plan to Reagan early
next week, one Republican participant said the
target for spending reductions this fiscal
would be $8 billion, or $5 billion less than Rea
gan asked.
The GOP leaders also agreed to try to make a
"down payment" on reducing public benefit
