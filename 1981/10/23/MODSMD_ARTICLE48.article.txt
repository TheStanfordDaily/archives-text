Journalism's Saint Meg
Yes, you probably do redd News

The Washington Post's editorial
page, but did you ever think that you
would be able to talk to Meg Green
field â€” maybe even share your most
secret journalistic fantasy? You can:

at the Tuesday staff lunch, noon.
Staff party
It's time to conform to the stere
otype of the two-fisted, hell-if-I'm
going- under-the-table-first drinking
journalist. Or just come enjoy the un
matched company and food. Today
at 4:30.
