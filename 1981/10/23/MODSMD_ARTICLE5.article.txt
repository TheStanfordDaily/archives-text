# Massy restricted by tighter budget, deadlines

President Ronald Reagan's budget
cuts are affecting people 'hroughout
the nation, and no administrator
feels these cuts more profoundly
than William Massy, the University's
vice president of business and fi
nance, who is responsible for allocat
ing a major proportion of Stanford's
capital.
Areas which fall under Massy's ju
risdiction are: accounting and finan
cial control, facilities, construction,
operations, maintenance, invest
ments, personnel and non-academic
support services, such as income
producing real estate, police, fire,

and food service.
Massy said the total investment as
sets of the University amount to $900
million. According to Rodney
Adams, director of finance, this
number includes investments in the
endowmerrt division ($7OO million)
plus an expendable funds pool ($2OO
million). Adams said, "any penny not
spent is working."
Massy said over the past four years
he has noticed a quickening of pace
in his job that is also apparent in all
other administrative functions at
Stanford. "More problems are oc
curring more frequently; we're
doing more on tighter time lines,"
said Massy.
The feeling that events are more
pressed than ever before results from
a combination of many factors, said
Massy. Besides the problems as
of ofir energy choices. "Public dis
cussion is usually limited to pro or
con nuclear power," he said.
"Seldom is that orientation produc
tive."
Schweikert cited Secretary of the
Interior James Watt as an example of
someone who promotes this limited
dialogue. "The 180-degree turn that
Watt is attempting to perform is not
productive and not successful. Vir
tually everything he has done is
going into the court system."
Since transportation makes up 45
percent of the state's overall energy
needs, and virtually all of that is
fulfilled by petroleum-based liquid
fuels, Schweikert said the develop
ment of an alternative liquid fuel
presents a major challenge to Cali
fornia. So far the most promising al
ternative fuel appears to be
methanol, he said. "One of our stud
ies shows that methanol, derived
from coal, if it were produced now,
would cost the same as petroleum,"
he added.
In the end, decisions on energy,
the environment and resource utili
zation are all connected with the val
ue system of the elected official mak
ing the decision, Schweikert said.
After the speech, Schweikert told
the Daily that the Reagan adminis
tration'senergy policy is'going to
have a dramatic effect on the work of
the California Energy Commision.
"They've taken $5 million out of our
budget in federal cutbacks of pro
grams in conservation and solar

energy," he said.
These programs, which were
funded jointly by state and federal
funds, will be severely affected, ac
cording to Schweikert. Through
these programs the California Energy
Commission has been able to award
grants to local governments, hospi
tals and schools to help fund projects
that would increase energy savings
by these institutions, he said.
"Federal policies are totally ori
ented toward subsidizing nuclear
power," Schweikert said. Over $300
million has been shifted in the feder
al government's budget from solar to
nuclear power, he added.
According to Schweikert, the Rea
gan administration has proposed
eliminating the federal tax credit for
solar and conservation projects. This
will place all the burden for tax cred
its on state governments and de
crease the incentive for switching to
renewable sources of energy, he
said. ,«
The Reagan administration has also
made a shift in policy regarding nu
clear proliferation, Schweikert said.
"The view is that nuclear materials
are a commodity like wheat. They are
trying to shift responsibilities for the
sales of nuclear materials from the
Energy Department to the State De
partment," he added.
In addition to Schweikert, the
energy conference is hosting energy
researchers and speakers from the
energy industry and public lobbying
groups. Approximately 125 Califor
nia high school students and teachers
are attending the conference.

Commission has been able to award
grants to local governments, hospi
tals and schools to help fund projects
that would increase energy savings
by these institutions, he said.
"Federal policies are totally ori
ented toward subsidizing nuclear
power," Schweikert said. Over $300
million has been shifted in the feder
al government's budget from solar to
nuclear power, he added.
According to Schweikert, the Rea
gan administration has proposed
eliminating the federal tax credit for
solar and conservation projects. This
will place all the burden for tax cred
its on state governments and de
crease the incentive for switching to
renewable sources of energy, he
said. ,«
The Reagan administration has also
made a shift in policy regarding nu
clear proliferation, Schweikert said.
"The view is that nuclear materials
are a commodity like wheat. They are
trying to shift responsibilities for the
sales of nuclear materials from the
Energy Department to the State De
partment," he added.
In addition to Schweikert, the
energy conference is hosting energy
researchers and speakers from the
energy industry and public lobbying
groups. Approximately 125 Califor
nia high school students and teachers
are attending the conference.
President Ronald Reagan's budget
cuts are affecting people 'hroughout
the nation, and no administrator
feels these cuts more profoundly
than William Massy, the University's
vice president of business and fi
nance, who is responsible for allocat
ing a major proportion of Stanford's
capital.
Areas which fall under Massy's ju
risdiction are: accounting and finan
cial control, facilities, construction,
operations, maintenance, invest
ments, personnel and non-academic
support services, such as income
producing real estate, police, fire,

and food service.
Massy said the total investment as
sets of the University amount to $900
million. According to Rodney
Adams, director of finance, this
number includes investments in the
endowmerrt division ($7OO million)
plus an expendable funds pool ($2OO
million). Adams said, "any penny not
spent is working."
Massy said over the past four years
he has noticed a quickening of pace
in his job that is also apparent in all
other administrative functions at
Stanford. "More problems are oc
curring more frequently; we're
doing more on tighter time lines,"
said Massy.
The feeling that events are more
pressed than ever before results from
a combination of many factors, said
Massy. Besides the problems as
of ofir energy choices. "Public dis
cussion is usually limited to pro or
con nuclear power," he said.
"Seldom is that orientation produc
tive."
Schweikert cited Secretary of the
Interior James Watt as an example of
someone who promotes this limited
dialogue. "The 180-degree turn that
Watt is attempting to perform is not
productive and not successful. Vir
tually everything he has done is
going into the court system."
Since transportation makes up 45
percent of the state's overall energy
needs, and virtually all of that is
fulfilled by petroleum-based liquid
fuels, Schweikert said the develop
ment of an alternative liquid fuel
presents a major challenge to Cali
fornia. So far the most promising al
ternative fuel appears to be
methanol, he said. "One of our stud
ies shows that methanol, derived
from coal, if it were produced now,
would cost the same as petroleum,"
he added.
In the end, decisions on energy,
the environment and resource utili
zation are all connected with the val
ue system of the elected official mak
ing the decision, Schweikert said.
After the speech, Schweikert told
the Daily that the Reagan adminis
tration'senergy policy is'going to
have a dramatic effect on the work of
the California Energy Commision.
"They've taken $5 million out of our
budget in federal cutbacks of pro
grams in conservation and solar

energy," he said.
These programs, which were
funded jointly by state and federal
funds, will be severely affected, ac
cording to Schweikert. Through
these programs the California Energy
Commission has been able to award
grants to local governments, hospi
tals and schools to help fund projects
that would increase energy savings
by these institutions, he said.
