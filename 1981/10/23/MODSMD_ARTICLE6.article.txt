# Inter-Israeli dialogue promotes coexistence
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
An Arab Israeli and a Jewish Israeli
spoke about their hope for a
"dialoque of understanding" last
night to a group of approximately 40
students and community members.
Both are students at the Hebrew Uni
versity in Jerusalem, where they have
been working for four years to pro
mote peaceful co-existence between
Israel and a Palestinian state, based
on the 1948 boundaries.
"My concern is that we are two na
tions. We have no alternative but to
recognize each other as a nation and
to learn to deal with each other," said
Nur tWeen tv\u*aNaY\, ar» *ra\D-lsr«e\i
studying political science and in
ternational relations.
Musallah and Dani Yuval, a Jewish-
Israeli studying psychology, are
members of a program whcih Yuval
described as "trying to create an at
mosphere where views can be dis
cussed and the capacity to listen and
understand each other's point of
view can be developed."
50 to 60 students, out of a student
body of approximately 15,000, partici
pate in one of the three discussion
groups, dealing with issues that are
central to understanding Arab-Israeli
relations within Israel, such as preju
dice, hatred amd mistrust.
"In general, Palestinians and Jews
deal with each other as the enemy,
not as equal humans. We are totally
segregated form each other,"

Musallah said, adding that this pro
gram was the first attempt to bring
Jews and Arabs together at the Uni
versity.
The only requirement for joining
one of the discussion groups is a will
ingness "to listen to the other side,"
said Yuhal."We're hoping that indi
viduals will come to know each other
as people, that they will learn about
each other's histories and cultures,"
he said.
"Contrary to most lews and Palesti
nians, I believe that we are dealing
with two nations. We come from two
different cultural backgrounds,"
Vuvart said, pointing m
language, community values and re
figion.
"The cultural differences are re
flected on campus, but instead of
coming to a dialogue, to an under
standing, there is a tendency to
polarize," he said.
Addressing the problem of de
termining how to define a person of
"Palestinian"origin, Yuval notedthat
there is a similar problem in de
termining Jewishness. Both he and
Musallah agreed that a sense of na
tionhood is a "very subjective thing."
Audience involvement was good,
with questions about the way in
which Palestine's boundaries could
be determined, the political scene in
Israel, and the balance and justifi
cation of the speaker's own presenta
tion.
