# West Bank major area of Mideast contention
##

Yehoshafat Harkabi, former chief
of Israeli military intelligence, under
lined the West Bank as the pressure
point in Arab-Israeli relations and
warned of a continually unstable
Mideast stunned by the death of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
Harkabi, a professor of Middle East
studies and International Relations at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
spoke to more than 50 students and
faculty at the American Studies
house last night.
Harkabi predicted Egypt and its
new president Hosni Mubarak will
be treading softly in the months to
come because they fear losing the Is
raeli-occupied Sinai, to be returned
to Egypt on April 12,1982. The Camp
David Peace Accords of 1978, which
called for the Israeli evacuation of
the Sinai, also included the hope of
full autonomy for Palestinians of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Full autonomy, said Harkabi, while
interpreted by the late Sadat and
then U.S. President Jimmy Carter to
mean independence, has meant
"something different " to Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
While Harkabi does not expect Be
gin to relinquish the Israeli occupa
tion of the West Bank, he prophesied
that a country occupying a region
they do not inhabit has little hope of
retaining the territory Openly
critical of Begin's reluctance to speed
West Bank autonomy, Harkabi said
delay on issue will continue to
weaken the spirit of the Camp David
Peace agreement and possibly
heighten Egypt-Israeli tensions. 7 his
breakdown may eventually add an
additional hostile neighbor to Isreal's
south, creating military tension on a
third front, said Harkabi.

If West Bank autonomy continues
to move slowly, thus damaging
Egypt-Israeli relations, Harkabi pre
dicted that Mubarak will continue to
develop relations with other Arab
countries which he has courted with
kinder words than did Sadat.
Harkabi does not foresee much
change in the attitudes of the Palesti
nian Liberation Organization (PLO)
which also demands Israeli evac
uation from the West Bank. Yet, the
PLO, whose goal is to reclaim all of
Palestine from Israel, will not be satis
fied with the release of the West Bank
only, he said.
If the West Bank were to achieve
autonomy, the already densely
farmed area would not be able to
handle the influx of Palestinians cur
rently settled on the East Bank of the
Dead Sea in Jordan, said Harkabi.
Faced with the option of either be
coming citizens of Jordan or moving
into the West Bank, many Palestinians
would undoubtedly go to their
homeland, causing population prob
lems unless additional land is pro
vided, he said.
Assessing the rest of the Mideast,
Harkabi saw instability increasing in
Sudan where Southern Yemeni
forces, supported by the Soviet
Union, might in the future threaten
Northern Yemen and the Sudanese
border. He predicted no political in
stability in Saudi Arabia soon, despite
its "anachronistic regime."
In answer toa question concerning
Israeli sentiment toward the sale of
U.S. AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia,
Harkabi replied, "We're sometimes
amazed that they are described as
'terrific' in their detection of military
movement. Some Israeli leaden
think they're no good."
