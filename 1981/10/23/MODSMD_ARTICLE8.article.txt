# Solidarity resumes leafleting: police clashes increasing
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's independent
trade union Solidarity has resumed thesaleof
leaflets and bulletins in the center of the in
dustrial city of Katowice following clashes
earlier this week with police wielding
truncheons and tear gas.
The incidents coincided with a new wave of
industrial unrest as workers in at least 10 of
Poland's 49 regions either struck or prepared
to strike to protest food shortages and price
rises.
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was flying
back from France to attend a Solidarity meet
ing following a week-long visit but was de
layed by a strike at Paris airport organized by
one of the unions that sponsored his trip.
The clashes between Solidarity supporters
and police in Katowice were seen here as the
kind of incident that may become more fre
quent should the government crack down on
union activities. The southern city, the hub of
Poland's coal mining region, was reported
quiet Wednesday.
Police attempt arrest
The trouble began when police attempted
to arrest Solidarity activists distributing union
publications from a van decorated with the
slogan "Freedom for political prisoners." A
crowd of about 5000 people chased the po
lice who replied with tear gas. The crowd
then overturned a police van and threw
stones at a police building.
A Solidarity activist arrested by police was
later released.
Over the past six months a couple of similar
incidents have taken place, starting with the
burning down of a small police station out
side Warsaw last April following a quarrel
over cigarettes. Last month there were more
serious riots in the western town of Konin
when police were unable to prevent clashes
between local residents and gypsies.

In all cases, Solidarity officials have tried to
contain the anger of the crowd to prevent
further violence. In Katowice Tuesday, the
riot police withdrew following the clashes
and order was kept during the night by the
workers' militia.
Fears of escalation
A common fear here is that some relatively
minor incident could flare up into major dis
turbances as winter approaches and the
economy deteriorates. The mood of ordinary
people forced to wait in line for hours for ev
erything from meat to detergent is becoming
more belligerent and impatient.
So far, however, both the government and
Solidarity still appear capable of defusing
such incidents before they get out of control.
The police reaction in Katowice Tuesday
seems to suggest that the authorities were
taken off guard by the reaction of the crowd.
For their part, local Solidarity officials de
nied police allegations that the activists were
engaged in distributing "anti-Soviet" and
"antistate" material. They also dismissed sug
gestions that the action was connected with
the resignation of Stanislaw Kania as Com
munist Party leader and his replacement by
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
No violent crackdown seen
Despite the tougher rhetoric emerging
from recent party meetings, and an intraparty
debate over the feasibility of declaring a state
of emergency, there is no evidence that the
authorities are preparing actively for a violent
crackdown on Solidarity in the near future.
On the other side, meanwhile, the mood of
rank-and-file Solidarity activists is becoming
increasingly militant. Wednesday, for exam
ple, 150,000 workers in the western province
of Zielona Cora went on a warning strike to
demand the removal of local officials accused
of mismanagement.

union activities. The southern city, the hub of
Poland's coal mining region, was reported
quiet Wednesday.
Police attempt arrest
The trouble began when police attempted
to arrest Solidarity activists distributing union
publications from a van decorated with the
slogan "Freedom for political prisoners." A
crowd of about 5000 people chased the po
lice who replied with tear gas. The crowd
then overturned a police van and threw
stones at a police building.
A Solidarity activist arrested by police was
later released.
Over the past six months a couple of similar
incidents have taken place, starting with the
burning down of a small police station out
side Warsaw last April following a quarrel
over cigarettes. Last month there were more
serious riots in the western town of Konin
when police were unable to prevent clashes
between local residents and gypsies.

In all cases, Solidarity officials have tried to
contain the anger of the crowd to prevent
further violence. In Katowice Tuesday, the
riot police withdrew following the clashes
and order was kept during the night by the
workers' militia.
Fears of escalation
A common fear here is that some relatively
minor incident could flare up into major dis
turbances as winter approaches and the
economy deteriorates. The mood of ordinary
people forced to wait in line for hours for ev
erything from meat to detergent is becoming
more belligerent and impatient.
So far, however, both the government and
Solidarity still appear capable of defusing
such incidents before they get out of control.
The police reaction in Katowice Tuesday
seems to suggest that the authorities were
taken off guard by the reaction of the crowd.
For their part, local Solidarity officials de
nied police allegations that the activists were
engaged in distributing "anti-Soviet" and
"antistate" material. They also dismissed sug
gestions that the action was connected with
the resignation of Stanislaw Kania as Com
munist Party leader and his replacement by
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
No violent crackdown seen
Despite the tougher rhetoric emerging
from recent party meetings, and an intraparty
debate over the feasibility of declaring a state
of emergency, there is no evidence that the
authorities are preparing actively for a violent
crackdown on Solidarity in the near future.
On the other side, meanwhile, the mood of
rank-and-file Solidarity activists is becoming
increasingly militant. Wednesday, for exam
ple, 150,000 workers in the western province
of Zielona Cora went on a warning strike to
demand the removal of local officials accused
of mismanagement.
