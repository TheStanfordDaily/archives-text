## South Africa deports black job-seekers to Transkei 'homeland,' unemployment 
### Washington Post 
Cape Town, South Africa —
Vakatshiwo Cocina is back in
town. And so are his wife and
five children, and at least 300
other blacks who were ar
rested, jailed and deported
from Cape Town to the inde
pendent homeland of Transkei
by South African authorities in
August.
With their return, the saga of
Cape Town's Nyanga squatter
site has taken its predicted
cyclical course and has demon
strated the limited deterrence
of the harsh treatment meted
out to the squatters in an at
tempt to stop them from
streaming out of their poor ru
ral areas into the white-con
trolled cities.
For more than a month, au
thorities and squatters en
gaged in a unique sort of guer
rilla combat in Nyanga. Police
tore down the squatters' lean
to's of plastic and corrugated
iron as fast as they were put up,
leaving about 2000 men, wom
en and children unprotected
against the cold winter rains.
All around thesite, known in
Cape Town vernacular as "No-
Name Camp," is a new barbed
wire fence, a catchall for bits of
litter and a barrier to would-be
squatters. Its gate is padlocked.
Some squatters who im
mediately attempted to return
to Cape Town were stopped at

police roadblocks on the high
way. For a few days, roadblocks
were also set up in the black
townships of Cape Town to
catch any "illegal" blacks who
had slipped by.
The episode strained rela
tions between South Africa and
Transkei, the first black reserve
or homeland to become "inde
pendent," a status recognized
only by South Africa. Trans
keian officials resented the

'Transkeians are entitled to come and
work in the Cape (of South Africa) as
much as any other racial group
because they have contributed to its
development/

forced return of the squatters
to a place offering no jobs.
Prime Minister George
Matanzima called Pretoria "a
big bully."
"Transkeians are entitled to
come and work in the Cape as
much as any other racial group
because they have contributed
to its development," said a
Transkeian official who did not
want to be named. His com
ments deftly ignored the fact
that — in South Africa's view —
his government forfeited the
right of Transkeian citizens to

any claim on South Africa by
accepting independence in
1976. These people are now
technically "foreigners" in the
87 percent of South Africa un
der white control.
At first South Africa tried to
smooth matters by sending
some white officials to Transkei
to screen the squatters to allow
those who had lost children
and possessions in their sum
mary deportation to come

back and get them. This so an
gered the squatters who were
demanding enough buses for
them all to return to Cape
Town, that the women bar
ricaded the doors of the hall,
surrounded the white officials
and berated them. They had to
be rescued by Transkeian of
ficials.
Next there were high-level
discussions between the South
African foreign minister and
two Transkeian Cabinet min
isters. South Africa gave Trans
kei $37,000 to help the squat

ters relocate to their villages.
But most of the squatters
looked upon their $65
dividend as fare to get back to
Cape Town. Many returned by
bus, train and plane, and others
hitchhiked.
The first stop for most re
turned squatters is the volun
teer-run Athlone advice office:
help to find lost relatives, to get
work permits, and, for women,
to gain permission to stay with
their working husbands.
Official government policy is
that Cape Town must be kept a
"preferential" area for the mix
ed-race population of "Col
oreds." This is why influx con
trol is so rigorously pursued
here and why the Nyanga
squatters became the focus of
government attention. By
keeping out families and re
stricting labor to yearly re
newable contracts, the author
ities hope to prevent new black
residential areas from develop
ing.
This policy ignores the fact
that Coloreds are migrating out
of Cape Town to take better
paying jobs in the more in
dustrialized Transvaal.
In the bigger picture, the
Nyanga squatters are a drop in
the bucket. Comprehensive
studies estimate that as many as
one and a half million black
squatters are living in and
around South African cities.
