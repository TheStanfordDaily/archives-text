AOB — YES
The two-quarter Academic Organizations
Board fee assessment serves two purposes: It
funds the Board itself, and it helps fund the4o
academic and preprofessional groups who serve
on the Board.
The Board and these organizations sponsor or
co-sponsor virtually all of Stanford's
extracurricular academic activities. This is an
important role: too often, students don't take
academics beyond the classroom.
Band — NO
The Band involves a lot of students, alumni
and Stanford fans; a road trip every year makes
for a good attitude among Band members; and'
the Band can be a goodwill ambassador.
However, there is more to getting a fee
assessment than wanting oneand relyingon
past glories.
Students, we believe,are willingtosupporta
good time for the Band — whether it be a road
trip or beer. However we believe there has been
a lack of willingness on the Band's part to
reciprocate by taking their zaniness seriously.
Students are willing to pay for a good show, but
the shows simply haven't been good.
Withholding this request for a two-quarter fee
asessment will be a clear message from students
that they expect higher quality performances.
Boathouse — NO
We urge rejection of the one-quarter
Boathouse fee assessment not because we wish
to force the Boathouse out of existence for lack
of funding, but instead to force the University to
assume a responsibility it has passed off to the
students long enough.
There is no question that the Boathouse and
beach facilities on Lake Lagunita are desired by
the students, faculty and staff of the University.
But why should the students be forced to pay for
these facilities? The University knows as well as
we do it should be picking up the cost of
keepingthe lake safe and fun for all.
The Bridge — YES
There are few places where students can
receive free daytime and nighttime counseling.
The Bridge, a student-run organization located
on campus, is one ofthem. While not every
student takes advantage of this service, it is,
nevertheless, vital to those who do. In addition
to providing drop-in counseling five days a
week and a phone service every night, the
Bridge offers peer counseling classes, dorm
outreach programs, workshops, information
and referrals.
CEB —NO
ASSU senators are responding to complaints
of how they've handled the lack-of-concerts
issue by passing the buck, and by asking
students to fund their "solution" through a two
quarter fee assessment: more than $20,000. Half
the funds would cover losses from any
unsuccessful projects sponsored by other
campus groups, and part would support the
Board and parties. Parties are being used to
improve the image of the ASSU at everyone's
expense. The Campus Entertainment Board
(CEB) has no record of success and only the
senate's guarantee that it will be effective.
CSA—YES
Despite the factthat almost half of all Stanford
students are in the graduate and professional
schools, most University services and student
programs are directed primarily towards
undergraduates. The Graduate Student
Association (GSA) is the only organization on
campus working for the special needs and
interests of the graduate community as a whole.
In the past year, the GSA has sponsored grad
oriented social events, aided other, more
specialized graduate organizations, and worked
with the administration on such issues as
housing, stipends and teaching assistantships.
Legal Counseling — YES
Local attorneys and students at our own Law
School provide a wide range of legal advice and
services to registered students free of charge.
Unlike many other organizations, the Legal
Counseling office has no source of funds other
than fee assessments. Legal services insurance
may be the wave of the future, but it will never
be purchased as cheaply as this two-quarter fee
assessment will provide.
Program Fee — YES
The program fee is virtually the only source of
funds fora great number of non-academic
student organizations. These groups provide
unique services to a diverse sample of the
student body. The ASSU, which administers the
program fee, divides upthe fund among those
groups.
Because these groups are so dependent on
voluntary student funding, they could not
survive if this two-quarter fee assessment did
not pass.

Many campus organizations were denied fee assessments last spring not necessarily because
the majority of students disapproved of them, but rather because less than 20 percent of the
student body bothered to vote in the assessment elections. This is unfortunate — several of •
the groups up for vote provide valuable services to the entire student population. The Daily
is presenting here the editorial board's voting recommendations for this week's special
election. They are based on a review of each of the organization's proposed budgets and
interviews with representatives from the groups. We urge students to consider the merits of
each fee assessment proposal on the ballot and to VOTE this Wednesday and Thursday, Oct.
28 and 29.

Publications Board — YES
The ASSU Publications Board is the only
agency whose sole function is to provide
logistical and financial support for student
publications at Stanford. Aside from assisting
ongoing publications, the Board isa primary
source of assistance for innovative projects
regardless of size or philosophical outlook.
Most importantly, the Pub Board establishes and
maintains journalistic independence with its
strict policy of non-interference in the
operations and editorial content of the
publications it supports.
SCOPE —YES
Stanford students are often accused of
knowing little of national government, but if this
is so, it is despite the efforts of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education (SCOPE).
SCOPE arranged George McGovern's speech
last spring, helped bring John Anderson to
campus, and treated the campus to the wit and
purported wisdom of William F. Buckley. Only
the students' fee assessment support allows
them to listen to speakers of such high
prominence and caliber. While we hope that
SCOPE remembers to provide its costly speakers
adequate publicity and facilities conducive to
greater attendance, SCOPE deserves student
support.
SEE —YES
A one-time, one-quarter fee assessment
cannot alone support a new organization.
Without careful planning, a clearsense of
purpose and at least a core group of able and
dedicated students to guide it through its first
uncertain steps, the organization is doomed to
collapse.
Stanford for Environmental Education (SEE)
does have those qualities, though. In its first four
weeks of existence, SEE has planned numerous
events focusing on "awareness of the earth, its
problems and potential." Its membership will
make every effort to give an objective
presentation of each issue, and deserves the
chance to prove itself.
SPA —YES
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA) seeks
a one-quarter fee assessment to sponsor
programs, symposia, a journal and expenses to
support various campus social-action
organizations. These include environmental
and energy groups, and Third World, minority
and women's rights organizations. Such
educational efforts, even if promoted by a
campus coalition with strong political leanings,
is deserving of student support because they
bring to this campus people and perspectives
which might not be available here otherwise.
STAN — NO
The Student-Alumni Network providesan
important service. STAN promotes class
activities and opportunites for graduates to
share career experiences with current students,
and linksalumni families in the area with new
students. However, STAN should be supported
by other University organizations, such as the
Bowman Alumni House or the Office of
Development. Solicitation of alumni for
involvement in the "day-in-the-field"or
"experience-by-degrees" programs should be
covered by the Alumni Association and not by
student fee assessments, which must be
reserved for groups with both less of a claim to
University support and more of a need of
students' funds.
VIA —YES
Volunteers In Asia (VIA) isa nationally
renowned program which offers studentsthe
opportunity to experience Southeast Asian
culture for six months to two years. The only
program of its kind, it sets up contacts through
an Asian institution and arranges for suitable
livingconditions.
Although only 50 to 60 students actually go to
the host nations, we feel that the quality of their
experience, as well asthe number of lives they
touch, both here and abroad, make up for the
small percentage of students who are afforded
the opportunity first-hand.
Women's Center — YES
The Women's Center provides a numberof
valuable services to the Stanford community. As
a hub of feminist resourcesand programming,
the center offers a supportive atmosphere to
women and men alike.
Among the services available through the
Women's Center are a 24-hour information
tape, an extensive book and periodical library
and numerous educational programsand
events.
While the Daily suggests a stronger program
of fiscal management to provide the best
possible development and utilization of Center
funds, we support the programs and services
made available by the Women's Center.

programs, symposia, a journal and expenses to
support various campus social-action
organizations. These include environmental
and energy groups, and Third World, minority
and women's rights organizations. Such
educational efforts, even if promoted by a
campus coalition with strong political leanings,
is deserving of student support because they
bring to this campus people and perspectives
which might not be available here otherwise.
STAN — NO
The Student-Alumni Network providesan
important service. STAN promotes class
activities and opportunites for graduates to
share career experiences with current students,
and linksalumni families in the area with new
students. However, STAN should be supported
by other University organizations, such as the
Bowman Alumni House or the Office of
Development. Solicitation of alumni for
involvement in the "day-in-the-field"or
"experience-by-degrees" programs should be
covered by the Alumni Association and not by
student fee assessments, which must be
reserved for groups with both less of a claim to
University support and more of a need of
students' funds.
VIA —YES
Volunteers In Asia (VIA) isa nationally
renowned program which offers studentsthe
opportunity to experience Southeast Asian
culture for six months to two years. The only
program of its kind, it sets up contacts through
an Asian institution and arranges for suitable
livingconditions.
Although only 50 to 60 students actually go to
the host nations, we feel that the quality of their
experience, as well asthe number of lives they
touch, both here and abroad, make up for the
small percentage of students who are afforded
the opportunity first-hand.
Women's Center — YES
The Women's Center provides a numberof
valuable services to the Stanford community. As
a hub of feminist resourcesand programming,
the center offers a supportive atmosphere to
women and men alike.
Among the services available through the
Women's Center are a 24-hour information
tape, an extensive book and periodical library
and numerous educational programsand
events.
While the Daily suggests a stronger program
of fiscal management to provide the best
possible development and utilization of Center
funds, we support the programs and services
made available by the Women's Center.
AOB — YES
The two-quarter Academic Organizations
Board fee assessment serves two purposes: It
funds the Board itself, and it helps fund the4o
academic and preprofessional groups who serve
on the Board.
The Board and these organizations sponsor or
co-sponsor virtually all of Stanford's
extracurricular academic activities. This is an
important role: too often, students don't take
academics beyond the classroom.
Band — NO
The Band involves a lot of students, alumni
and Stanford fans; a road trip every year makes
for a good attitude among Band members; and'
the Band can be a goodwill ambassador.
However, there is more to getting a fee
assessment than wanting oneand relyingon
past glories.
Students, we believe,are willingtosupporta
good time for the Band — whether it be a road
trip or beer. However we believe there has been
a lack of willingness on the Band's part to
reciprocate by taking their zaniness seriously.
Students are willing to pay for a good show, but
the shows simply haven't been good.
Withholding this request for a two-quarter fee
asessment will be a clear message from students
that they expect higher quality performances.
Boathouse — NO
We urge rejection of the one-quarter
Boathouse fee assessment not because we wish
to force the Boathouse out of existence for lack
of funding, but instead to force the University to
assume a responsibility it has passed off to the
students long enough.
There is no question that the Boathouse and
beach facilities on Lake Lagunita are desired by
the students, faculty and staff of the University.
But why should the students be forced to pay for
these facilities? The University knows as well as
we do it should be picking up the cost of
keepingthe lake safe and fun for all.
The Bridge — YES
There are few places where students can
receive free daytime and nighttime counseling.
The Bridge, a student-run organization located
on campus, is one ofthem. While not every
student takes advantage of this service, it is,
nevertheless, vital to those who do. In addition
to providing drop-in counseling five days a
week and a phone service every night, the
Bridge offers peer counseling classes, dorm
outreach programs, workshops, information
and referrals.
CEB —NO
ASSU senators are responding to complaints
of how they've handled the lack-of-concerts
issue by passing the buck, and by asking
students to fund their "solution" through a two
quarter fee assessment: more than $20,000. Half
the funds would cover losses from any
unsuccessful projects sponsored by other
campus groups, and part would support the
Board and parties. Parties are being used to
improve the image of the ASSU at everyone's
expense. The Campus Entertainment Board
(CEB) has no record of success and only the
senate's guarantee that it will be effective.
CSA—YES
Despite the factthat almost half of all Stanford
students are in the graduate and professional
schools, most University services and student
programs are directed primarily towards
undergraduates. The Graduate Student
Association (GSA) is the only organization on
campus working for the special needs and
interests of the graduate community as a whole.
In the past year, the GSA has sponsored grad
oriented social events, aided other, more
specialized graduate organizations, and worked
with the administration on such issues as
housing, stipends and teaching assistantships.
Legal Counseling — YES
Local attorneys and students at our own Law
School provide a wide range of legal advice and
services to registered students free of charge.
Unlike many other organizations, the Legal
Counseling office has no source of funds other
than fee assessments. Legal services insurance
may be the wave of the future, but it will never
be purchased as cheaply as this two-quarter fee
assessment will provide.
Program Fee — YES
The program fee is virtually the only source of
funds fora great number of non-academic
student organizations. These groups provide
unique services to a diverse sample of the
student body. The ASSU, which administers the
program fee, divides upthe fund among those
groups.
Because these groups are so dependent on
voluntary student funding, they could not
survive if this two-quarter fee assessment did
not pass.

Many campus organizations were denied fee assessments last spring not necessarily because
the majority of students disapproved of them, but rather because less than 20 percent of the
student body bothered to vote in the assessment elections. This is unfortunate — several of •
the groups up for vote provide valuable services to the entire student population. The Daily
is presenting here the editorial board's voting recommendations for this week's special
election. They are based on a review of each of the organization's proposed budgets and
interviews with representatives from the groups. We urge students to consider the merits of
each fee assessment proposal on the ballot and to VOTE this Wednesday and Thursday, Oct.
28 and 29.

Publications Board — YES
The ASSU Publications Board is the only
agency whose sole function is to provide
logistical and financial support for student
publications at Stanford. Aside from assisting
ongoing publications, the Board isa primary
source of assistance for innovative projects
regardless of size or philosophical outlook.
Most importantly, the Pub Board establishes and
maintains journalistic independence with its
strict policy of non-interference in the
operations and editorial content of the
publications it supports.
SCOPE —YES
Stanford students are often accused of
knowing little of national government, but if this
is so, it is despite the efforts of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education (SCOPE).
SCOPE arranged George McGovern's speech
last spring, helped bring John Anderson to
campus, and treated the campus to the wit and
purported wisdom of William F. Buckley. Only
the students' fee assessment support allows
them to listen to speakers of such high
prominence and caliber. While we hope that
SCOPE remembers to provide its costly speakers
adequate publicity and facilities conducive to
greater attendance, SCOPE deserves student
support.
SEE —YES
A one-time, one-quarter fee assessment
cannot alone support a new organization.
Without careful planning, a clearsense of
purpose and at least a core group of able and
dedicated students to guide it through its first
uncertain steps, the organization is doomed to
collapse.
Stanford for Environmental Education (SEE)
does have those qualities, though. In its first four
weeks of existence, SEE has planned numerous
events focusing on "awareness of the earth, its
problems and potential." Its membership will
make every effort to give an objective
presentation of each issue, and deserves the
chance to prove itself.
SPA —YES
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA) seeks
a one-quarter fee assessment to sponsor
programs, symposia, a journal and expenses to
support various campus social-action
organizations. These include environmental
and energy groups, and Third World, minority
and women's rights organizations. Such
educational efforts, even if promoted by a
campus coalition with strong political leanings,
is deserving of student support because they
bring to this campus people and perspectives
which might not be available here otherwise.
STAN — NO

student body bothered to vote in the assessment elections. This is unfortunate — several of •
the groups up for vote provide valuable services to the entire student population. The Daily
is presenting here the editorial board's voting recommendations for this week's special
election. They are based on a review of each of the organization's proposed budgets and
interviews with representatives from the groups. We urge students to consider the merits of
each fee assessment proposal on the ballot and to VOTE this Wednesday and Thursday, Oct.
28 and 29.

Publications Board — YES
The ASSU Publications Board is the only
agency whose sole function is to provide
logistical and financial support for student
publications at Stanford. Aside from assisting
ongoing publications, the Board isa primary
source of assistance for innovative projects
regardless of size or philosophical outlook.
Most importantly, the Pub Board establishes and
maintains journalistic independence with its
strict policy of non-interference in the
operations and editorial content of the
publications it supports.
SCOPE —YES
Stanford students are often accused of
knowing little of national government, but if this
is so, it is despite the efforts of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education (SCOPE).
SCOPE arranged George McGovern's speech
last spring, helped bring John Anderson to
campus, and treated the campus to the wit and
purported wisdom of William F. Buckley. Only
the students' fee assessment support allows
them to listen to speakers of such high
prominence and caliber. While we hope that
SCOPE remembers to provide its costly speakers
adequate publicity and facilities conducive to
greater attendance, SCOPE deserves student
support.
SEE —YES
A one-time, one-quarter fee assessment
cannot alone support a new organization.
Without careful planning, a clearsense of
purpose and at least a core group of able and
dedicated students to guide it through its first
uncertain steps, the organization is doomed to
collapse.
Stanford for Environmental Education (SEE)
does have those qualities, though. In its first four
weeks of existence, SEE has planned numerous
events focusing on "awareness of the earth, its
problems and potential." Its membership will
make every effort to give an objective
presentation of each issue, and deserves the
chance to prove itself.
SPA —YES
The Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA) seeks
a one-quarter fee assessment to sponsor
programs, symposia, a journal and expenses to
support various campus social-action
organizations. These include environmental
and energy groups, and Third World, minority
and women's rights organizations. Such
educational efforts, even if promoted by a
campus coalition with strong political leanings,
is deserving of student support because they
bring to this campus people and perspectives
which might not be available here otherwise.
STAN — NO
The Student-Alumni Network providesan
important service. STAN promotes class
activities and opportunites for graduates to
share career experiences with current students,
and linksalumni families in the area with new
students. However, STAN should be supported
by other University organizations, such as the
Bowman Alumni House or the Office of
Development. Solicitation of alumni for
involvement in the "day-in-the-field"or
"experience-by-degrees" programs should be
covered by the Alumni Association and not by
student fee assessments, which must be
reserved for groups with both less of a claim to
University support and more of a need of
students' funds.
VIA —YES
Volunteers In Asia (VIA) isa nationally
renowned program which offers studentsthe
opportunity to experience Southeast Asian
culture for six months to two years. The only
program of its kind, it sets up contacts through
an Asian institution and arranges for suitable
livingconditions.
Although only 50 to 60 students actually go to
the host nations, we feel that the quality of their
experience, as well asthe number of lives they
touch, both here and abroad, make up for the
small percentage of students who are afforded
the opportunity first-hand.
Women's Center — YES
The Women's Center provides a numberof
valuable services to the Stanford community. As
a hub of feminist resourcesand programming,
the center offers a supportive atmosphere to
women and men alike.
Among the services available through the
Women's Center are a 24-hour information
tape, an extensive book and periodical library
and numerous educational programsand
events.
While the Daily suggests a stronger program
of fiscal management to provide the best
possible development and utilization of Center
funds, we support the programs and services
made available by the Women's Center.
AOB — YES
The two-quarter Academic Organizations
Board fee assessment serves two purposes: It
funds the Board itself, and it helps fund the4o
academic and preprofessional groups who serve
on the Board.
The Board and these organizations sponsor or
co-sponsor virtually all of Stanford's
extracurricular academic activities. This is an
important role: too often, students don't take
academics beyond the classroom.
Band — NO
The Band involves a lot of students, alumni
and Stanford fans; a road trip every year makes
for a good attitude among Band members; and'
the Band can be a goodwill ambassador.
However, there is more to getting a fee
assessment than wanting oneand relyingon
past glories.
Students, we believe,are willingtosupporta
good time for the Band — whether it be a road
trip or beer. However we believe there has been
a lack of willingness on the Band's part to
reciprocate by taking their zaniness seriously.
Students are willing to pay for a good show, but
the shows simply haven't been good.
Withholding this request for a two-quarter fee
asessment will be a clear message from students
that they expect higher quality performances.
Boathouse — NO
We urge rejection of the one-quarter
Boathouse fee assessment not because we wish
to force the Boathouse out of existence for lack
of funding, but instead to force the University to
assume a responsibility it has passed off to the
students long enough.
There is no question that the Boathouse and
beach facilities on Lake Lagunita are desired by
the students, faculty and staff of the University.
But why should the students be forced to pay for
these facilities? The University knows as well as
we do it should be picking up the cost of
keepingthe lake safe and fun for all.
The Bridge — YES
There are few places where students can
receive free daytime and nighttime counseling.
The Bridge, a student-run organization located
on campus, is one ofthem. While not every
student takes advantage of this service, it is,
nevertheless, vital to those who do. In addition
to providing drop-in counseling five days a
week and a phone service every night, the
Bridge offers peer counseling classes, dorm
outreach programs, workshops, information
and referrals.
CEB —NO
ASSU senators are responding to complaints
of how they've handled the lack-of-concerts
issue by passing the buck, and by asking
students to fund their "solution" through a two
quarter fee assessment: more than $20,000. Half
the funds would cover losses from any
unsuccessful projects sponsored by other
campus groups, and part would support the
Board and parties. Parties are being used to
improve the image of the ASSU at everyone's
expense. The Campus Entertainment Board
(CEB) has no record of success and only the
senate's guarantee that it will be effective.
CSA—YES
Despite the factthat almost half of all Stanford
students are in the graduate and professional
schools, most University services and student
programs are directed primarily towards
undergraduates. The Graduate Student
Association (GSA) is the only organization on
campus working for the special needs and
interests of the graduate community as a whole.
In the past year, the GSA has sponsored grad
oriented social events, aided other, more
specialized graduate organizations, and worked
with the administration on such issues as
housing, stipends and teaching assistantships.
Legal Counseling — YES
Local attorneys and students at our own Law
School provide a wide range of legal advice and
services to registered students free of charge.
Unlike many other organizations, the Legal
Counseling office has no source of funds other
than fee assessments. Legal services insurance
may be the wave of the future, but it will never
be purchased as cheaply as this two-quarter fee
assessment will provide.
Program Fee — YES
The program fee is virtually the only source of
funds fora great number of non-academic
student organizations. These groups provide
unique services to a diverse sample of the
student body. The ASSU, which administers the
program fee, divides upthe fund among those
groups.
Because these groups are so dependent on
voluntary student funding, they could not
survive if this two-quarter fee assessment did
not pass.

Many campus organizations were denied fee assessments last spring not necessarily because
the majority of students disapproved of them, but rather because less than 20 percent of the
student body bothered to vote in the assessment elections. This is unfortunate — several of •
the groups up for vote provide valuable services to the entire student population. The Daily
