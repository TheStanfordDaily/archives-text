## A.I. will defend beliefs to the death 
### 
"I disapprove of what you say, but I
will defend to the death your right to
say it." Many of us are familiar with
these words of the French
philosopher Voltaire. Still, it seems
that since securing rights to freedom
of thought and expression in this
country, Americans pay little or no
attention to the fates of others who
attempt the same in their native
lands.
Each year, thousands of the world's
citizens are imprisoned, tortured and
even executed simply because their
beliefs and those of their govern
ments conflict. It's an awful state of
affairs which is perhaps difficult for
those who live in the freedom of the
United States to understand. Never
theless, we must try for we cannot
fully enjoy the freedom of our socie
ty while ignoring the responsibility
we have to those who do not live in
freedom themselves. How many
Americans would be willing to take
any action at all to improve condi
tions in other nations? Very few, it
seems. How many, then, would be
willing to die to protect the beliefs of
others?
Last week marked the twentieth
birthday of an organization which
has gained reknown throughout the
world as a defender of individuals
against their governments. Some na
tions only recognized this event
while others just ignored it. It was a
day of celebration, however, for peo
ple everywhere who care about the
rights of the individual. These men
and women joined in celebrating the
birthday of Amnesty International
(Al), one of the few significant move
ments for individual liberties remain
ing in the world.
Members of Al have been labeled
"western ideological saboteurs" in

the Soviet Union, "instruments of
communist terrorism" in Brazil and
even "counter-revolutionary" in
Ethiopia. No matter what political
game they play, governments in gen
eral fear Al because it stands up for
people when they are threatened by
systems that abuse them. Strangely
enough, the only weapon Al has at its
disposal is the truth. Quite often,
though, nothing more is necessary.
Al's strategy is simple. Each year,
the London-based group chooses a
limited number of so-called "pris
oners of conscience" (two or three
thousand) on whom members con
centrate their efforts. "Prisoners of
conscience" are men, women and
children "detained anywhere for
their beliefs, color, sex, ethnic origin,
language or religion." No individual
who has committed or advocated a
violent act is eligible for the group's
help. These prisoners, now termed
"adoptees" are divided among Al's
worldwide constituency of over 2500
volunteer groups. Volunteer groups
write in behalf of their "adoptees" to
government and military officials, re
questing either a speedy and fair trial
or immediate release.
Surprisingly, Al's strategy of con
fronting power with truth seems to
work: nearly half of all their "adop
tees" are released.
Other than the coordination of re
search and letter writing, Al plays
very few other roles. Occasionally,
legal services will be provided to a
particular prisoner. Al members
point to passages from the United
Nations Universal Declaration of Hu
man Rights to justify their activities:
Article 3, "Everyone has the right to
life, liberty and security of person";
Article 5, "No one shall be subjected
to torture or to cruel, inhuman or de
grading treatment or punishment";

Article 9, "No one shall be subjected
to arbitrary arrest, detention or ex
ile."
Worthy of note is the fact that
almost every country accused of tor
turing and killing "prisoners of cons
cience" signed the above declara
tion. Al works to remind those na
tions of the commitments they them
selves made.
It is important to remember that Al
is independent of any government,
political, ideological or religious
grouping. All potential violations of
the U.N. Declaration of Human
Rights are treated on a case by case
bais. Governments are not singled
out for revolution or reform, merely
bombarded with letters and bad pub
licity whenever their treatment of a
particular individual becomes unac
ceptable.
The true merits of the group come
to lisht in letters from grateful
"adoptees" like Julio de Pena
who was taken in a mass arrest in the
Dominican Republic. He wrote:
"When the first 200 letters came,
the guards gave me back my clothes.
Then the next 200 letters came, and
the prison director came to see me.
When the next pile of letters arrived,
the director got in touch with his su
perior. The letters kept coming: 3000
of them. The President was informed.
The letters still kept arriving and the
President called the prison and told
them to let me go."
Maybe we could all learn from the
example of Amnesty International:
people who care about the freedom
of others can and should make a dif
ference.
