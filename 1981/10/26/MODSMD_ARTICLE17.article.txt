## EPA without teeth is like Pentagon minus MX missiles 
### 
Anne Gorsuch has me worried.
The director of the Environmental
Protection Agency appears to be dis
mantling her organization from the
bottom up. Her confidential pro
posal to the Office of Management
and Budget (which was recently
leaked to Congress) to cut 44 percent
from the EPA budget for 1983 will no
doubt be joyously received by David
Stockman. But I doubt the American
people will be very fond of the idea.
But Mrs. Gorsuch isn't the only
person in Washington that has me
worried. President Ronald Reagan
himself, I'm sure, is in favor of
Gorsuch's plan, not only for its effect
on the federal budget, but also for its
impact on the business community.
Unfortunately, our president is only
concerned about protecting the
American people from hostile acts by
foreign nations, and he has little or
no desire to protect U.S. citizens
from an equally great domestic dan
ger â€” air and water pollution.
I believe it's time we all asked the
Congress to persuasively inform Mr.
Reagan that the American people
want a healthy Environmental Pro
tection Agency. A watchdog without
teeth is like the Pentagon without
MX missiles.
