## Tracey Minkin In Hell, culture not overrated 
### 
Our story thus far: the Author, for
unknown reasons, landed in Hell last
summer. She discovered the general
plan of the inferno to be much like
Dante's conceptualization, save a
forgotten circle lying off to the side
behind a screen door. This circle of
Hell, home of the Affected and Pre
tentious, has presented thus far a
stairway with landings for (in de
scending order) Faddists, Swingers
and Name Droppers. This conclud
ing segment finds the Author bravely
descending into lower and more
fiery depths of superficiality. . .
Passing the Name Droppers to de
scend yet another flight, the dark
ening stairwell opens on a large land
ing with three doors. All three doors
are open, and each room contains a
dining room table, and what appear
to be dinner guests.
The first dinner party is very low
key, hushed with dampers of in
telligentsia. The men, wearing rose
tinted Annie Hall glasses and slightly
rumpled wool blazers, tug at their
beards as they sip an unpretentious
yet esoteric wine. The women, simi
larly attired, spread C ;n enbert on
thin crackers, tug on their boots, and
strike an inquisitive pose Discussion
rambles, touching on the New
Yorker's review of John Irving's
newest book, the latest seminar at
the Center for Humanistic Studies,
Buckley's recent piece in the Na
tional Review, and the Marx Brothers
film festival at the local art theatre.
The discussion next door is muted
also, and is gently washed over by a
tinkling harpsichord. Culture drips
from the antique chandelier. The
men, with clean-shaven faces and
immaculately coiffed hair and nails,
smooth the tiniest wrinkle in their
gray pinstripe three-piece suits,
while gazing discreetly at their equal
ly lovely companions. And the worn

en are indeed lovely, impeccably
dressed in conservative yet chic eve
ning wear; their make-up perfect,
their hair sassooned just that morn
ing.
A few rather expensive prints are
strategically placed and highlighted
on the walls, as is one collection by a
"new and stellar talent." They flash
tickets for different concerts, operas,
plays, and ballets, and insist on con
vincing their neighbors that their
own pet performer's "dramatic in
tensity" far outreaches the other's ar
tist's "clarity of insight."

Discussion rambles,
touching on the
New Yorker's review
of John Irving's
newest b00k,...
Ruckley's recent
piece in the
National Review, and
the Marx Brothers
film festival at the lo
< al art theatre."

This quiet conversation is soon ov
erwhelmed by the more vocal dis
putes going on next door. A liberal
soiree, and they're debating in full
force. Like defectors from Green
wich Village, their look is complete
with frizzy hair, second-hand
clothes, and gaudy jewelry. They are
all white, but talk black. They are all
heterosexual, but talk about
homosexual issues. They are all em
ployed at the local university, but talk
farm-workers' rights. They argue
ERA, busing and socialized medicine.
They reminisce about the 60s, and re

mind each other to write in Eugene
McCarthy's name again on the up
coming presidential ballot. They sip
Beck's beer in defiance of Coors, and
toast the slackening of anti-mari
juana laws.
The caretaker from the Faddist
floor has appeared in the hallway.
"We're closing up for the night,
you'll have to turn around and go
back up. Besides it really gets ugly af
ter this Pseudo-floor — I mean
pseudo intellectuals, cultured, and
liberals are nasty, but there are
animals down there further; the
nouveau-riche, the snobs, why with
all that primal screaming and those
cuisinarts grinding away, the din nev
er stops. Even though the bunch on
this floor is pretty noisy, I'd much
rather be here than down there.
Well, I don't know for sure, when the
punishment comes down on this
floor, I wouldn't want to be here
either.
They're gonna cancel the intellec
tuals' magazine subscriptions, re
voke the cultured's season tickets,
and make the liberals listen to the
"Checkers Speech" over and over
again. That'll be ugly.
But that's not my business. I just
clean up. So, take that freight
elevator up to the top and try back on
Saturday — we're open 'till nine. So
maybe I'll see you sometime, and,
here, take this 'I Like Ike' button, it's
my last one. That's the elevator on
your right."
So I learned a lot in Hell this sum
mer. Was it worth it? Well, I didn't get
the money or the resume material
that a congressional internship in
Washington would have pulled. But
what a tan!
