# Law dean claims quality replacements
## 
### Phil Chritton 
The recent departures of five leading Law School
faculty members, including former Dean Charles
Meyers, are unrelated and do not seriously alter
the quality or reputation of the institution, accord
ing to Acting Dean J. Keith Mann.
Though the final search committee recommen
dations for a new dean are not expected until the
end of autumn quarter, Mann cited successful re
cruiting for new faculty members as the basis for
his optimism about the school's status.
After leaving the Law School, Meyers went into a
private energy law practice, while professor Wil
liam Baxter joined the Justice Department and Vic
tor Li was appointed director of the U.S. East-West
Center in Hawaii. Thomas Ehrlich took an offer to
be provost at the University of Pennsylvania and
Anthony Amsterdam went to NYU.
"We regret these losses," said Mann, "but they
do not reflect an institutional emergency. There's
no connecting thread, just a set of individual cir
cumstances surrounding each of these de
partures." He said, however, that the Law School
does not expect to lose more than one faculty
member per year.
Mann explained that the faculty "all left for dif
ferent and what they regarded as compelling rea
sons," though he added it is rare for senior Stan
ford law faculty to join other schools or go into
private practice.
Mann, however, is "exceptionally" pleased with

the group of five newly recruited faculty, including
Robert Ellickson from USC and Robert Mnookin
from Boalt, now full professors here. A special law
course will also be taught in the spring by Shirley
Hufstedler, secretary of education in the Carter
administration.
Mann said students hoping to take courses from
the faculty who left would be affected, "but on the
other hand, there are students quite interested in
what these new people are offering. It's a cost
benefit analysis, I guess."
In the early 60s, Mann said, several Columbia
faculty came to Stanford, greatly increasing Stan
ford's reputation at the time, but creating "a very
severe loss for Columbia."
The recent situation at Stanford doesn't repre
sent anything like that, he said, "although it's
something we don't take lightly."
Mann said, "From outside of the institution,
even one as small as the Law School, the school ap
pears to be very static." However, he said, when
one is connected with it through academic admin
istration, "you realize it tends to be quite dynamic.
"The Faculty Appointments Committee recruits
people year 'round — it's the most important job
we do.
"We have a lot of people in the 'pipeline,' so to
speak," he said. For example, "We go to the Su
preme Court and interview all the clerks interested
in law-teaching every year." Mann will be doing
such recruiting with President Donald Kennedy in

Washington D.C. this November, asthe two intend
to introduce Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to a
Stanford alumnus currently being sought after as a
potential faculty member.
If the recruits are interested and appear to meet
the Law School's standards, they are invited to see
Stanford and meet the faculty. While visiting,
Mann said, "we try to get some idea how their
mind works. We put quite an emphasis on
teaching as well as research."
Mann said searches are now being conductd to
locate faculty specializing in international law,
where Ehrlich and Li specialized, in natural re
sources, Meyers' field, and in business law. If no
one meeting Stanford's criteria can be found, said
Mann, visitors may be used, or assistant professors
may be persuaded to go into a new area — a proc
ess known as "grow your own."
Mann said Stanford is nonetheless a very attrac
tive place for potential professors, and tends to
speak for itself in recruiting. "Our most difficult
problem in getting faculty is that housing costs in
this area are at least double what they are any place
else."
Other recruiting difficulties cited by Mann are
the recent salary gaps between entry-level law
teachers and beginning jobs with big-city law firms
(about a $10,000 difference) and the relocation
problems of two-career families.
