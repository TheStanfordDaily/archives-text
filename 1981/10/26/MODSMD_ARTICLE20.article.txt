## Bush voodoo doll O.K.'s Reaganomics 
### 
A little over a year ago, then-presi
dential candidate George Bush was
campaigning against an economic
program which he labeled "voodoo
economics". Since that time, Bush
has become vice president of the
very administration responsible for
the economic program which he so
vehemently denounced. To what
strange circumstance do we owe this
sudden and complete trans
formation?
The answer is simple and obvious:
in some dark, subterranean recess of
the White House there is a heavily
guarded closet marked "Top Secret".
In that closet there is a doll which
closely resembles George Bush.
Through the head of that doll there is
a large pin.
Amidst all of the speculation about
exactly how Reaganomics is sup
posed to work, it is becoming in
creasingly clear that magic is to play a
central role. Reagan's heavy reliance
on "invisible hands"and hisappoint
ment of David Stockman, perhaps
better known as witch doctor/cult
figure Mugabe Nkomo Freemarket,
are two sure signs. Reagan himself
provided incontrovertible evidence
of the crucial role of magic in his eco
nomic program when he recently
asked Third World leaders to rely on
the "magic of the marketplace."
It is reassuring that the present ad
ministration is well-versed in magic,
however, for nothing short of magic
could make Reaganomics work. A

central assumption of Reaganomics
is drawn from the Laugher Curve, or
the idea that a reduction in tax rates
will cause such an explosive increase
in production (and consequently in
taxable income) that tax revenues
will actually increase. This theory is
always good for a laugh at conven
tions of economists, but as an eco
nomic policy it leaves something to
be desired.

Another indication of the strength
of Reagan's magic is the fact that his
tax cut, which is a classic Keynesian
maneuver to stimulate the economy
in times of recession, has been magi
cally transformed into a "supply
side" tax cut designed to increase
production and supposedly thereby
reduce inflation. Hopefully, this mag
ical transformation will circumvent
the inflationary effects of a Keynesian
tax cut in an already inflationary
economy.

Evidently, the banks and the Feder
al Reserve Board are not convinced:
interest rates are at near-record
levels and promise to remain so for
some time to come. While this is the
only restraint on inflation (Reagan
certainly hasn't provided any), it also
stifles investment and could con
tribute to a recession. In addition,
high interest rates are likely to re
move any chance of balancing the

budget, since the government must
finance its debt at these high interest
rates.
Some supply-siders have even ad
vocated a return to the gold stan
dard, a move which a recent critic
likened to the chairman of the Amer
ican Medical Association recom
mending that leeching be re-in
stituted as a medical procedure, or
the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court calling forthe useof trial by or

deal. Indeed, with the current fad for
magic, these practices, along with
alchemy, astrology, and a host of oth
ers may be just around the corner.
And how is the Reagan adminis
tration spending its, or rather our,
money? Certainly not on anything
economically useful like education,
basic industrial research and de
velopment, or a search for alternative
energy resources. If the Reagan ad
ministration were to invest even 10
percent of its projected four-year,
trillion-dollar defense buildup on
basic research and development, our
economy would experience a burst
of growth rivaling that of the in
dustrial revolution.
Unfortunately, it seems that the
Reagan administration's program,
with its inherent contradictions of in
flationary tax cuts and high defense
spending fighting against high in
terest rates and a desire for a bal
anced budget, demonstrates a pref
erence for magic and voodoo over
sound economic thinking.
I'm afraid I'll have to stop here, for
I suddenly have the most piercing
headache, as if somebody were stick
ing .. . there, it's gone; my head just
feels numb now. Where was I? Oh
yes, Reaganomics. Best thing since
the wheel. You see, first you take this
tax cut. ..

always good for a laugh at conven
tions of economists, but as an eco
nomic policy it leaves something to
be desired.

Another indication of the strength
of Reagan's magic is the fact that his
tax cut, which is a classic Keynesian
maneuver to stimulate the economy
in times of recession, has been magi
cally transformed into a "supply
side" tax cut designed to increase
production and supposedly thereby
reduce inflation. Hopefully, this mag
ical transformation will circumvent
the inflationary effects of a Keynesian
tax cut in an already inflationary
economy.

Evidently, the banks and the Feder
al Reserve Board are not convinced:
interest rates are at near-record
levels and promise to remain so for
some time to come. While this is the
only restraint on inflation (Reagan
certainly hasn't provided any), it also
stifles investment and could con
tribute to a recession. In addition,
high interest rates are likely to re
move any chance of balancing the

budget, since the government must
finance its debt at these high interest
rates.
Some supply-siders have even ad
vocated a return to the gold stan
dard, a move which a recent critic
likened to the chairman of the Amer
ican Medical Association recom
mending that leeching be re-in
stituted as a medical procedure, or
the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court calling forthe useof trial by or

deal. Indeed, with the current fad for
magic, these practices, along with
alchemy, astrology, and a host of oth
ers may be just around the corner.
And how is the Reagan adminis
tration spending its, or rather our,
money? Certainly not on anything
economically useful like education,
basic industrial research and de
velopment, or a search for alternative
energy resources. If the Reagan ad
ministration were to invest even 10
percent of its projected four-year,
trillion-dollar defense buildup on
basic research and development, our
economy would experience a burst
of growth rivaling that of the in
dustrial revolution.
Unfortunately, it seems that the
Reagan administration's program,
with its inherent contradictions of in
flationary tax cuts and high defense
spending fighting against high in
terest rates and a desire for a bal
anced budget, demonstrates a pref
erence for magic and voodoo over
sound economic thinking.
I'm afraid I'll have to stop here, for
I suddenly have the most piercing
headache, as if somebody were stick
ing .. . there, it's gone; my head just
feels numb now. Where was I? Oh
yes, Reaganomics. Best thing since
the wheel. You see, first you take this
tax cut. ..

A little over a year ago, then-presi
dential candidate George Bush was
campaigning against an economic
program which he labeled "voodoo
economics". Since that time, Bush
has become vice president of the
very administration responsible for
the economic program which he so
vehemently denounced. To what
strange circumstance do we owe this
sudden and complete trans
formation?
The answer is simple and obvious:
in some dark, subterranean recess of
the White House there is a heavily
guarded closet marked "Top Secret".
In that closet there is a doll which
closely resembles George Bush.
Through the head of that doll there is
a large pin.
Amidst all of the speculation about
exactly how Reaganomics is sup
posed to work, it is becoming in
creasingly clear that magic is to play a
central role. Reagan's heavy reliance
on "invisible hands"and hisappoint
ment of David Stockman, perhaps
better known as witch doctor/cult
figure Mugabe Nkomo Freemarket,
are two sure signs. Reagan himself
provided incontrovertible evidence
of the crucial role of magic in his eco
nomic program when he recently
asked Third World leaders to rely on
the "magic of the marketplace."
It is reassuring that the present ad
ministration is well-versed in magic,
however, for nothing short of magic
could make Reaganomics work. A

central assumption of Reaganomics
is drawn from the Laugher Curve, or
the idea that a reduction in tax rates
will cause such an explosive increase
in production (and consequently in
taxable income) that tax revenues
will actually increase. This theory is
always good for a laugh at conven
tions of economists, but as an eco
nomic policy it leaves something to
be desired.
