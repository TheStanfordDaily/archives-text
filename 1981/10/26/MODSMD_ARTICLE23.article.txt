## Studyentertainment at Meyer 
### 
Students don't go to Meyer Library
to study. Students go to be enter
tained. The reason why ASSU Special
Events lost so much money was be
cause the University wouldn't allow
concerts in Meyer. When the Stones
requested to play Meyer before settl
ing for Candlestick Park, Mick Jagger
was quoted as saying, "We wanted to
play Meyer because we knew it had

turnstiles."
I go to Meyer Library to meet girls.
I always thought that if students
would only wear name tags at Meyer,
it would be easy to meet girls and not
nearly as noisy. Also, students
wouldn't have to ask so many ridicu
lous questions like the ones this girl
was asking me the other day:
Girl: Excuse me, but are you good
in algebra?
Jordan: No.
Girl: Aren't you in my film class? I
know I've seen you somewhere
before.
Jordan: No.
Girl: Can I borrow your ID, I go to
Menlo College and I need to check
out this book here?
Jordan: Yeah, really . . . hey, I was
thinking about applying there. Uh,
you want to grab a beer with me or
something?
Girl: No.
The only time students use Meyer
to study is when they have reserved
reading to do. I could never under
stand why a student needed to show
a Stanford ID for reserved reading
until I had a friend visit me from
Maine. "Do you think we could do
some reserved reading at Meyer one
night?" he asked naively. "Well,
maybe," I replied, "do you have a
fake Stanford ID? They card pretty
heavily."
I hate reserved reading. I think I've
spent at least one-half of my time
here at Stanford waiting for my
number to flash on the reserved
reading board. I understand the Uni
versity installed the lighted number
board in the library with the idea that
Meyer could be converted into a
Bingo center if campus bowling con
tinues to drop in popularity.
I've never been able to understand

the people who study in those glass
rooms. I think they're the real scary
people on this campus: the
murderers, the thieves, the drug ad
dicts, the pre-meds. Why don't these
people just go to Green Library and
get a locker or something? These are
the people who go talk to the pro
fessor after class. If it weren't for
these guys, we wouldn't need the
Bridge.
Meyer does offer the student some
valuable services. Probably the most
useful service is the Library Tour.
Meyer tours are conducted daily, but
remember: No cameras or tape rec
orders. In fact, this year's new attrac
tion on the tour is the Photocopy
Room. A repaired change machine
and new psychedelic photocopy ma
chines are magnificent attractions. A
Library Tour requirement may re
place the Western Culture require
ment, if Harvard University takes the
initiative. Self-guided tours have re
cently been added and includea tour
of the Human Sexuality Center, "a
small non-ciiculating browsing col
lection." No joke. Most likely, audio
visual materials will be added to the
collection next year.
It's the "little things" about Meyer
that students find so irritating. It
shouldn't take longer to check out a
book and find it than it takes to read
it. Students shouldn't be forced to
walk past J. Henry's portrait every
time they go to the library. The guy
deserved to have a moustache
painted on him.
This irritation and others like it
contribute to the Meyer madness
which has become Stanford tradi
tion.
