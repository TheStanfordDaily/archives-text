## Wastes don't belong in Canada's backyard 
### 
Washington — Most Americans don't make it a policy to dump garbage in
their neighbor's backyard.
But if they did, it would be easier to understand why Americans are annoy
ing the hell out of most Canadians.
Our neighbors to the north claim that air pollution from coal-fired power
plants in the Midwest is responsible for the acid rain that falls on the pristine
lakes and forests of Ontario and Quebec. Over 200 lakes there are dead or
dying due to acidification and Canadians claim that the province's tourist
based commerce won't survive unless the U.S. cleans up its skies.
Unfortunately, our government has only challenged the Canadians to
prove their charge. And that's next to impossible.
Scientists believe that sulfur dioxides and nitrous oxides released by power
plants into the atmosphere blow downwind, mix with water vapor and fall
elsewhere as acid precipitation. Yet experts are a long way from linking
smokestacks to acidified lakes.
Clouding and chilling the current squabbles is Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau's plan to nationalize a hunk of U.S. interests in Canada's formidable
energy resources. Trudeau also plans to build more power plants, perhaps
with an eye for selling electricity to U.S. border towns. One Ohio con
gressman charged the Canadians with trying to put U.S. power companies out
of business.
Both sides should know that catcalls and bravado won't clear up the larger
confusion over international responsibility for a healthy environment.
In the United States, acid rain is no longer a Midwest-Northeast issue. Flori
dians from the Panhandle now blame Alabama for giving them acid rain.
Cities in Arizona and New Mexico want Southern California to curb air pollu
tion that's floated their way, and Kentuckians believe Southern Illinois must
do the same.
On our side of the border, the answer hinges on the future of the Clean Air
Act, which is due for reauthorization, and which may have caused the prob
lems in the first place. The 1970 Act forced states lo build taller smokestacks to
clean up local environments, yet resulted in the long-range transport of the
chemical particulates. Cleaning up sulfur and nitrogen emissions at the
source is the real answer and should be the next step.
The United States and Canada must get down to business. Both countries
clearly have grievances and faults in environmental protection. Yet both have
good reasons and strong responsibilities to work together. If we mean to get
along, let's begin now.
