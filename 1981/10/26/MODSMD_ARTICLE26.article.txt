## Catholics protesting nuclear arms 
### Los Angeles Times 
A number of Roman Catho
lic bishops in the United States
have recently escalated their
public opposition to the
toughened American stance in
the nuclear arms race, notably
the San Francisco archbishop
who condemned it as "im
moral."
And the choice presented by
them to the nation's 50 million
Roman Catholics is: Who is
wisest about maintenance of
peace — President Ronald
Reagan or Pope John Paul II??
The Pope's warnings against
amassing ever-greater nuclear
weaponry, delivered to the
United Nations and to an au
dience in Hiroshima, are fre
quently quoted in contrast to
the Reagan administration's
policy of trying to deter Soviet
thoughts of nuclear war
through improved U.S. retalia
tion capabilities.
Archbishop John Quinn of
San Francisco surprised partici
pants in a Mass Oct. 4 at St.
Mary's Cathedral with a strong
ly worded pastoral statement
saying, "The teaching of the
church is clear: nuclear weap
ons and the arms race must be
condemned as immoral."
Quinn received a standing ova
tion at the end of his statement
and aides said the nearly 300
letters received since have

been virtually all favorable.
Quinn said modern popes
have recognized the right of
nations to responsible self-pro
tection to protect themselves
against unprincipled and dan
gerous enemies.
"The moral problem arises,
however, when the effects of
our defensive weapons are no
longer fully predictable or
within or control," said Quinn,
who served as president of the
National Conference of Catho
lic Bishops from 1977 to 1980.
Because of the widespread
destruction envisioned in a
head-to-head U.S.-Soviet con
flict, Quinn contended that
Catholic theoretical sanctions
for "just wars" do not apply in
this era.
"Strategic nuclear weapons
are designed precisely and ex
clusively to destroy entire cities
and their populations," he
said. "It is hard to imagine a
more lethal instrument of in
discriminate mass destruction
of civilian non-combatant pop
ulations."
Quinn quoted from Pope
John Paul's address early this
year in Japan: "To remember
Hiroshima is to abhor nuclear
war. To remember Hiroshima is
to commit oneself to peace . . .

Let us promise our fellow hu
man beings that we will work
untiringly for disarmament and
the banishing of all nuclear
weapons; let us replace vio
lence and hate with con
fidence and caring."
Elsewhere, after once tabling
the motion, the National
Council of Catholic Women's
1400 voting delegates at their
annual meeting early this
month went beyond any pre
vious stance they have taken
and approved overwhelmingly
a resolution that incorporated
the Pope's words to work tire
lessly for disarmament and nu
clear weapons abolition. A
proposed amendment to "also
support the Reagan adminis
tration's military policies ... in
its fight against communism"
was ruyled out of order be
cause of the contrast with the
intent of the resolution.
Earlier, several bishops had
been more specific in their op
position tothe arms race and its
effects.
— Bishop L. T. Matthiesen of
Amarillo, Texas, urged em
ployees to quit their jobs at the
nearby Pantex plant, which
does final assembly for nuclear
bombs, including the neutron
bomb.
— The two Catholic bishops
of Montana, Elden Curtiss of

Helena and Thomas Murphy of
C.rpat Palk-Rillings, said in Sep
tember that they would op
pose not only the deployment
of the MX missile in Montana
but also "the MX missile sysem
itself, since it contributes to this
escalation (of the nuclear arms
race)." They cited Pope John
Paul's charge in his United Na
tions speech two years ago that
the desire to be ready for war
means being able to start it.
— Archbishop Raymond
Hunthausen of Seattle, an ad
vocate of unilateral disarma
ment who had picketed earlier
against the nuclear-armed Tri
dent submarines based in
Washington, called for Chris
tians to protest the arms race by
refusing to pay half their in
come taxes.
Hunthausen stirred wide de
bate with his contention that
the failure of disarmament
talks "leaves us with only one
moral position in this tragic sit
uation, the position of unilat
eral disarmament with trust
and reliance on the Lord as our
security."
Jesuit Father James Schall, in
a column for the San Francisco
archdiocesan paper, the
Monitor, said the Seattle
archbishop's position"issome
thing that is not at all required
either by reason or by Catholic
teaching."
