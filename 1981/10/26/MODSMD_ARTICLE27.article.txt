# Earning reports signal recession

Now York — Heading into the last 10 weeks of
a bear market year, stock-market investors are
faced with what even the White House has rec
ognized as a recession.
President Ronald Reagan used the word last
weekend, adding the description "light, and I
hope short." But with evidence accumulating of
slowing business activity and downward pres
sure on corporate earnings, many stock-market
analysts weren't so optimistic.
"It would be an understatement to say that
third-quarter corporate earnings are 'uneven,'"
said Heinz Biel at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
"Some are surprisingly good, but many others
are far worse than analysts had predicted."
One of the biggest shocks the markets have
had to absorb in recent days was General Motors
Corp.'s report of a $468 million loss for the July-
September period. The news sent the stock of
the auto giant tumbling to its lowest levels in
more than six years.
But there were numerous other signals of eco
nomic trouble. Government reports showed the
second consecutive quarterly decline in the
gross national product, adjusted for inflation,
and sharp drops last month in production and
orders for durable goods at the nation's fac
tories." '■ >' •* '
Noting the 2.9 percent slide in durable-goods
orders, Allen Sinai at the economic forecasting

firm of Data Resources Inc., said, "What we have
is a very rapidly deteriorating economy."
Stock prices, not surprisingly, responded by
posting their second straight weekly decline.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 13.70 to 837.99 after recording a 21.31-
point loss the week before.
The New York Stock Exchange composite in
dex slipped .30 to 68.83. At the American Stock
Exchange, the market value index managed a .16
gain to 307.35.
While there was strong evidence of the re
cession taking hold, there was little sign that it
was bringing with it any immediate relief from
the pressures of inflation and high interest rates.
Reagan pointed out that the bank prime lend
ing rate, now at 18 percent, has come down 2Vi
percentage points from its peak earlier this year.
But long-term rates in the bond market re
mained near record highs.
And the latest reading on the consumer price
index, issued Friday, offered no comfort at all.
The index rose 1.2 percent in September, main
taining a two-digit annual pace.
A "worst-of-two-worlds scenario — high in
terest rates and a declining economy — is troub
ling both the bond and equity markets," said
James Joyce, director of research at Tucker, An
thony & R.L. Day Inc.
