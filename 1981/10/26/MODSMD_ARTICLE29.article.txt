Detroit — Consumer groups and U.S.
automakers are at odds over the federal
government's decision to scrap a decade
long effort to require automatic seat belts
or air bags in new cars.
Raymond Peck, National Highway Traf
fic Safety Administration administrator,
announced Friday that the government
was withdrawing its mandate for automatic
seat belts and air bags beginning with 1983
model cars.
"It's the equivalentof letting a plague go
untouched without trying to control it,"
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for
Auto Safety in Washington, said. "I think it
flies in the face of tjie agency's mandate to
protect the publicirom traffic accidents."
The Insurance Institute for Highway

Safety called the decision "a tragedy," pre
dicting continued higher medical costs for
car crash victims.
"I'm afraid the auto manufacturers have
won the day/' said Charles Bruse, Wash
ington spokesman for Allstate Insurance
Co.
At General Motors Corp., Betsy Ancker-
Johnson, vice president in charge of en
vironmental activities, /abeled the de
cision "consistent with the best interest of
the consumer, since olur marketing ex
perience has shown that consumers do not
want to be forced into wearing automatic
belts."
Chrysler Corp., in a statement, de
scribed the ruling as "a prime example of
good judgment."

"We believe that NHTSA has made a
wise decision and has committed its re
sources to the best strategy of all — to get
motorists to use the seat belts they already
have," said Roger Maugh, safety director
at Ford Motor Co.
"An unused safety device is no safety de
vice at all," Peck argued, citing studies
which he said showed Americans would
refuse to use the devices even though they
would be automatic.
"Our latest survey evidence shows that
there is a clear possibility that the auto
matic aspect of the new system could not
only fail to increase usage, but could itself
provoke negative public reactions," Peck
said.
