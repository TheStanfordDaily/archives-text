Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) is the first to admit his
stances on many political issues are
controversial.
"I don't make any friends on this
one" and"I don't win any votes on
thisone" are both frequently uttered
by McCloskey.
Labeled by friend and foe as a lib
eral Republican, McCloskey, 54, has
represented the 12th district since
1967. (The Stanford area, which is
currently part of the 12th district, will
soon come under the jurisdiction of
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, ac
cording to a redistricting plan recent

Now McCloskey is bringing his

only way hecan defeat hisopponents

is to reregister Democrats as Re

canvassing volunteer for every 100
potential votes.
The thrust of McCloskey's cam
paign, then, appears to be two-fold:
to raise money and to enlist voters in
order to prevent splitting votes
among the candidates in the Re
publican primary.
At the crux of McCloskey's cam
paign is his stance on three issues he
calls his priorities: his National Youth
Service proposal, the prevention of
nuclear war in the Middle East and
balancing the budget.
These are the issues McCloskey ad
dressed during a campaign ap
pearance Friday in San Francisco.
McCloskey proposed the National
Youth Service program at the Univer
sity two years ago. Designed to bring
the "best American" men and wom
en into military service, it offers 18
