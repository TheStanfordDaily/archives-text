# McCloskey details goals

Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) is the first to admit his
stances on many political issues are
controversial.
"I don't make any friends on this
one" and"I don't win any votes on
thisone" are both frequently uttered
by McCloskey.
Labeled by friend and foe as a lib
eral Republican, McCloskey, 54, has
represented the 12th district since
1967. (The Stanford area, which is
currently part of the 12th district, will
soon come under the jurisdiction of
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, ac
cording to a redistricting plan recent
ly passed by the state legislature.)
Now McCloskey is bringing his
maverick image into the 1982 sena
torial race â€” a race in which he and
seven others hope to beat incumbent
S.I. Hayakawa.
McCloskey announced his can
didacy in late September with a cam

paign fund of $400,000. A poll which
indicated he could win the senate
race against Governor Jerry Brown
was one of his main incentives to run.
Because the Republican field is full
of contestants, McCloskey said the
only way hecan defeat hisopponents

is to reregister Democrats as Re
publicans and enlist one McCloskey
canvassing volunteer for every 100
potential votes.
The thrust of McCloskey's cam
paign, then, appears to be two-fold:
to raise money and to enlist voters in
order to prevent splitting votes
among the candidates in the Re
publican primary.
At the crux of McCloskey's cam
paign is his stance on three issues he
calls his priorities: his National Youth
Service proposal, the prevention of
nuclear war in the Middle East and
balancing the budget.
These are the issues McCloskey ad
dressed during a campaign ap
pearance Friday in San Francisco.
McCloskey proposed the National
Youth Service program at the Univer
sity two years ago. Designed to bring
the "best American" men and wom
en into military service, it offers 18

year-olds four choices.
One, the individual could enlist for
two years of active duty at minimal
wage in return for four years of col
lege benefits.
Two, the individual could enlist for
six months of reserve duty and be on
call for 5V2 years in return for one
year of college benefits.
The third option would be to vol
unteer for one year of civilian ser
vice, such as the Peace Corps.
Finally, the individual could go
into a draft pool for six years, with the
possibility of being called into duty if
there is a lack of volunteers.
McCloskey calls the service a form
of "national self-discipline," and as a
retired colonel, says he strongly be
lieves in the youth's duty to serve the
country.
McCloskey also wants to see peace
achieved in the Middle East which,
he said, depends on the AWACS (Air
borne Warning and Control System)
sale to Saudi Arabia.
"It looks very difficult for the presi
dent to turn around the vote at this
stage," McCloskey said about the
sale vote which is predicted for de
feat. "This indicates the power of the
Israeli lobbv.
McCloskey concurs with President

Ronald Reagan's proposals to bal
ance the national budget. Like Rea
gan, he believes the Social Security
system is headed for bankruptcy due
to abuse of funds.
"The only reason Israel is against
the sale is because it preempts a first
strike, should there be a war," he
said, But, McCloskey added, "An
AWACS is not an offensive weapon.
It's a radar."
The AWACS sale would initiate
Middle East peace which, in turn,
McCloskey said, has failed because
Jordan has refused to participate in
any peace talks.
McCloskey said the key to Jor
danian involvement is through Saudi
Arabia, which sends Si.4 billion to
Jordan a year, and by establishing a
Palestinian homeland. (More than 1
million Palestinians live in Jordan.)
McCloskey also said the United
States sends $5 billion in aid to Egypt,
Israel and Jordan, a practice estab
lished by the Camp David accords.
The congressman suggested Jordan
could be induced to participate in
peace talks by "withholding benefits
. . . This is not a threat. I am not anti-
Israel," McCloskey said. "But if you
want Israel to survive there has to be
a Palestinian homeland."
