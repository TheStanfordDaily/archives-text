## 62 points most scored against Cards since 1954 Sun Devils scorch Stanford with blistering offense 
### Mike Oneal 
At least it hasn't been boring.
If anything can be said for Stanford's 1-6
doldrums so far this season, that is it.
Then again, it hasn't been much fun either
particularly for those players and coaches direct
ly involved, who since this epic began have been
trying to determine wherein lies their tragic
flaw.
Quarterback John Elway thought he had it fig
ured out last week after his team had lost to USC
25-17 despite a 14-point fourth quarter come
back.
"As soon as we get ourselves going in the first
half we'll be set," the 6-foot-4, 202-pound
Heisman Trophy nominee said.
But in a game Saturday which lent new mean
ing to the term "aerial circus," Elway threw for
215 yards and two touchdowns in the first quar
ter and Stanford still lost to Arizona State 62-36.
That's right, 62-36.
Unfortunately for the Cards, the day they
picked to unveil the pre-season's most highly
touted offense was the day they faced the na
tion's mid-season No.l attack. Although it is odd
that the struggling Cardinal offense finally
erupted against the No.l rated defense in the Pa
cific-10 conference, it is no surprise that the Sun
Devils came out roaring. They have been averag
ing 497.3 yards in total offense per game this
year. They had 743 Saturday.
Both teams combined for 1092 yards passing to
shatter the NCAA single game record by 181
yards. Elway, 270 yards and 3 TDs, and
sophomore second-stringer Steve Cottrell (who
entered the game midway through the second
quarter when Elway suffered a sprained finger
and a concussion, and finished out the game
with 311 yards and 2 TDs) combined for 581
yards. ASU quarterbacks Mike Pagel and Steve
Bratkowski had 511 yards.
Pagel, who threw for 466 yards and a
phenomenal seven touchdowns, breaking
former Stanford quarterback Steve Dils' Pac-10
records in both those catagories, simply embar
rassed the Cardinal defense. He threw long ef
fectively, threw in the seam effectively, threw to
the flat effectively and even handed-off effec

tively. The Sun Devils rushed for 232 yards.
What the Arizona State offense did was shoot
as many holes in the theory that Stanfprd has a
great defense this year as there are holes in the
Cards' pass coverage. While Stanford has been
solid against the run so far it has not shown any
thing against the pass. The Sun Devils came to
Stanford Stadium with such balanced firepower
that Stanford couldn't key on anything. As a re
sult, ASU ran reasonably well and completed
passes at will.
Despite key injuries to freshman right cor
nerbacks Eric Price and Jeff Arrillaga,
sophomore free safety Steve Lemon and senior
linebacker Dave Morze, the Stanford coaching
staff realizes there is more to the poor pass cov
erage than inexperience and lost personnel.
"We're still much improved against the run,"
Stanford head coach Paul Wiggin said. "But
we're not very good against the pass. I never felt
like we were really going to stop them."
Defensive coordinator Jack Harbaugh agreed.
"We just aren't good back there and we
haven't been," Harbaugh said. "The responsi
bility rests with me. We decided to concentrate
on the run (this year) and we'll have to shift our
emphasis now."
Harbaugh pointed out that the entire problem
doesn't lie in the secondary. There are three
phases of pass defense — the rush, linebackers
dropping back and then the defensive
backfield's responsibilities. Stanford's most glar
ing problem has been in the mid-distance seam
where players make the tackle but don't get
there in time to break up the pass.
"We have to get better in all phases of pass de
fense," Harbaugh said.
Elway and senior All-America halfback Darrin
Nelson set the pace on the third play of the
game. Nelson took off from the Card backfield
and raced 50 yards down the right sideline
where Elway hit him with an underthrown pass
deep in ASU territory for a 70-yakd touchdown
play.
The lead changed hands three times in the first
half as Elway and Pagel each threw for three
touchdowns, Stanford kicker Mark Harmon


IT'S SHOWTIME, FOLKS — Stanford halfback Darrin
Nelson, shown here tap dancing past an ASU defensive

Saturday. Though they suffered a 62-36 loss — their worst

season-long scoring slump in a big way.
booted one field goal and his Sun Devil coun
terpart, Luis Zendejas, kicked two. It was in the
waning seconds of that half, however, that the
tide might have turned against Stanford for
good.
After two long, mouth-watering Cottrell-led
drives, the Cards found themselves on the ASU 2
yard line, first and goal, with 15 seconds left in
the half. The score was 27-24 Arizona State. A
field goal would have tied the game going into
the locker room and capped off the Cards' best
first half of the season nicely. The call went to
tailback Vincent White who ran it over right
guard for no gain and the clock ran out.

"It was supposed to be an outside play," Wig
gin said after the game. "I was as surprised as
anyone else when I saw it run to the inside. We
called a 68-solid but the play was a 64-solid. It got
mixed up when it was sent in (to the huddle)."
Some feel the play changed the complexion of
the game.
"It could have been a whole different game, I
suppose," Cottrell said. "We could have put
them on their heels."
Instead the Cards slowed down offensively in
the second half while Pagel threw four more
touchdowns and ASU blew Stanford out of the
stadium, despite Cottrell's two fourth quarter
TD passes.
