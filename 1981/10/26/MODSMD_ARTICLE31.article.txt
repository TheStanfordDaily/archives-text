### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” Pedro
Guerrero and Steve Yeager
hit consecutive home runs
off Ron Guidry in the sev
enth inning, giving the Los
Angeles Dodgers a 2-1 vic
tory over the New York Yan
kees yesterday and a 3-2
lead in the World Series.
The Dodger Stadium
56,115 erupted in thunder
ous applause and cheers as
the Dodgers continued on a
comeback trail that began in
the National League West
Division seriesagainst Hous
ton.
The saga of the underdog
Dodgers continues tomor
row in Game 6 at Yankee
Stadium, where the Series
began. It was also the stadi
um where the Yankees built
a 2-0 lead over Los Angeles.
The Dodgers, however,

have won three in a row in
Dodger Stadium, forcing
the Yankees to accomplish
an unprecedented feat if
they expect to win their 23rd
World Series.
No team has ever won the
World Series by winning all
four games at home.
Jerry Reuss, the Dodgers'
starter and loser in Game 1,
held the Yankees to four hits
in Game 5, although he was
not overpowering. It was
Guidry who looked the
stronger of the two until the
seventh inning.
Guidry had struck out
nine, including Dusty Baker
to start the seventh. As the
crowd sat in silence, patient
ly awaiting the awakening of
their Dodgers as had hap
pened so frequently before,
it came on the second pitch

to Guerrero.
The Dodger right fielder
was 3-for-15 before the sev
enth inning of Sunday's
game. But he slammed an
0-1 pitch from Guidry deep
into the left-centerfield
bleachers, tying the game.
Guidry then worked the
count on Yeager to 1-2
before the Dodger catcher
launched the ball into the
stands at nearly the same
spot where Guerrero's
wound up.
The homers, the ninth hit
consecutively in World
Series history, gave the
Dodgers their third straight
victory.
Los Angeles will send Burt
Hooton, the loser in Game
2, against Tommy John, the
winner of the second game,
when the Series returns to

New York.
The only run off Reuss,
10-4 during the regular sea
son with a 2.29 ERA, came in
the second. Reggie Jackson
doubled on the first pitch of
the inning, and Bob Watson
was safe when second
baseman Davey Lopes
dropped his grounder for
an error. Jackson went to
third on the play and scored
moments later, when Lou
Piniella singled into left
field, driving a grounder be
tween third baseman Ron
Cey and shortstop Bill Rus
sell.
Lopes tied two World
Series records in the fourth
inning when he committed
two errors on one play and
his second and third mis
cues of the game. The errors
tied a record for the most in
any game by a player of any
position.
The two errors on one
play also tied a Series record
for a second baseman, com
mitted in 1905 by Dan
Murphy of the Philadelphia
Athletics and tied in 1973 by
Mike Andrews of the Oak
land A's.
The inning was probably
New York's staunchest
threat against Reuss after
the second. Reuss walked
Watson on four pitches to
start the fourth and Piniella
then hit a bouncer to Lopes'
left. The second baseman
bobbled the ball twice, then
dropped it for one error.
When he retrieved it, he
threw the ball past first for
another error as Watson
wound up on third and
Piniella went to second.
Lopes pulled the mitt
from his hand and mo
tioned as if to throw it into
the dirt.

However, Reuss began to
wriggle from the jam when
Rick Cerone grounded to
short and neither runner
was able to advance. Reuss
then walked Aurelio
Rodriguez intentionally,
bringing Guidry to the plate
with one out and the bases
loaded.
Guidry laid down a bunt
that headed straight for
Reuss, and the pitcher's
throw easily forced Watson
at home. Willie Randolph
hit a hard grounder to Steve
Garvey at first, and Garvey
took the play himself, end
ing the inning.
In the final five innings,
Reuss faced only one over
the minimum number of
hitters.
Dave Winfield got his first
hit in 17 trips to the plate
during the Series with one
out in the fifth. Winfield,
playing in his first World
Series, asked that the ball be
removed from play so he
could keep it as a souvenir,

then tossed it into the Yan
kee dugout.
The rangy outfielder was
cut down in the double play
that ended the threat, and
Reuss then retired the side
in order in thesixth,seventh
and eighth innings before
the Yankees got one last
shot in the ninth.
After Watson had
grounded to shortstop,
Piniella singled up the
middle. Bobby Brown came
in to run for him, but stood
and watched as Cerone 112 lied
to center field and
Rodriguez struck out to end
the game.
The victory was marred
for the Dodgers, however,
when Cey was beaned by a
pitch from reliever Rich
Gossage in the eighth in
ning. Gossage had thrown
one strike to the Dodger in
fielder, when his next pitch,
a 94 mph fastball, hit Cey in
the helmet.
