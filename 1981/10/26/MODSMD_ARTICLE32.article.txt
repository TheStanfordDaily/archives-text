# Salazar, Roe set world records in NY Marathon

New York (AP) — Alberto
Salazar, who boldly predicted
he would break the world rec
ord, and New Zealand's Allison
Roe, a late entrant, shattered
the men's and women's world
marks yesterday in the New
York City Marathon.
The soft-spoken, confident
Salazar, in only his second mar
athon — he also won the New
York City event in 1980 —
clipped more than 20 seconds
off the men's record, covering
the 26-mile, 385-yard course in
2 hours, 8 minutes, 13 seconds.
Roe, who won the 1981 Bos
ton Marathon only to be sus
pended for running in a pro
fessional race and later re
instated, sliced more than 12
seconds off the women's rec
ord, with a time of 2:25:29.
The previous men's mark
was 2:08:33.6, by Derek Clay
ton of Australia set May 30,
1969 at Antwerp, Belgium. The
previous women's record was
2:25:41.3, by Crete Waitz of
Norway in last year's New York

City Marathon. The injured
Waitz had to drop out of this
year's race between the 14 and
15-mile points.
"I dreamed of a world rec
ord, but not of two," said a
jubilant Fred Lebow, the race
director.
Salazar had put himself on
the spot by predicting that he
would smash the world record,
with a time of 2:08, or possibly
2:07. He wasn't far off.
"I opened my big mouth
(again) this year," said the 23-
year-old Salazar, who a year
ago had said he could break
2:10 in his first marathon, and
beat that with a clocking of
2:09:41. "A lot of people would
have been disappointed if I had
not done it."
He did it — convincingly.
Biding his time behind the
fast early pace set by Louis Ken
ny of Ireland, the deceptively
strong, 6-foot, 144-pound
Salazar waited until the 16-mile
mark before making his big
move.

At that point, Kenny had
faded and Salazar was dueling
Mexico's Jose Gomez, a first
time marathoner, and Poland's
Ryszard Marczak for the lead.
Then, Salazar, who came to
the United States with his fami
ly at age 2 and is a graduate of
the University of Oregon, put
on a remarkable burst. He ran
the next mile in an unofficial
4:33. It put him into the lead —
and more than 20 seconds
ahead of record pace.
After that, the smooth-strid
ing Salazar pulled away from
the record field of 16,000 en
trants and his only challenger
was the clock.
"I knew I would have to start
pushing," he said. "I picked it
(the pace) up and then I was
confident I would do it."
He was unchallenged the
rest of the way, and as he
crossed the finish line in Cen
tral Park, he was mobbed by a
horde of well-wishers.
