## Pagel fires for two Pac-10 marks 
### Sid Spaeth 
It only seems fitting that when any Pacif
ic-10 passing records fall, they should fall at
Stanford, in a typical Stanford football
game.
That game came Saturday, and Pac-10
records did indeed fall. A game that saw
Arizona state quarterback Mike Pagel
throw for 466 yards and 7 touchdowns
both conference records — only to be out
thrown by a combined John Elway-Steve
Cottrell attack of 581 yards.
But sometimes, statistics lie. In this case,
most of Stanford's yardage was piled up by
Cottrell after the outcome of the game was
obvious! ASU routing the Cardinals at
their own game 62-36.
ASU was directed by Pagel, an unsung
quarterback with an offense that until now
earned its supper with the run.
And yet, Pagel remains an old-style
quarterback who possesses only enough
physical attributes to lead a team to vic
tory, not win it by himself.
Pagel, who may never have to see his
name spelled as Pagle again, relaxed aftor
the game with a pinch of tobbacco in his
cheek and the game plays still written on
his wristband.
"I dreamt about games like this," he
said, "but I didn't know if it would ever
come true."
Pagel was the first to credit the team ef
fort that ASU has become known for.

"The offensive line did a great job pro
tecting me today," he said. "I don't think I
got hit all day (he didn't). We knew Stan
ford had a great rushing defense, and that
we'd have to throw the ball. There were
lots of gaps in their secondary and our re
ceivers did a great job of finding them."
After the third play of the game, it was
certain that the Stanford offense was on, as
Elway hit halfback Darrin Nelson with a 70-
yard scoring strike, but Pagel never let
them get away, and the first half turned out
to be a Pagel-Elway shootout.
"If Elway wouldn't have gotten hurt,"
Pagel said, "there's a good possibility that
we would still be out there throwing the
ball around."
To be sure, Cottrell did an excellent job,
but without Elway the strategy changed,
the magic was gone, and ASU was off to the
races.
"Both John and Pagel are great ath
letes," Cottrell commented. "Both can
throw well and both are great scramblers.
It's hard to compare the two because the
offenses are different. Arizona State has a
great running offense and they put more
emphasis on the run, where we put more
emphasis on the pass.
"Mike has a strong arm, but I think John
might throw a little harder," he added.
"They are both just ideally suited for their
type of offenses. I don't think John could
step into their offense and do the job Mike

is doing, and I don't think Mike could step
into our offense and do the things John
can do."
Arizona State coach Daryl Rogers was
not surprised by Pagel's performance, and
was unaware of any records until after the
game, he said.
"We knew that he was the most under
rated quarterback in the nation," he said
of his quarterback. "Elway and McMahon
(Brigham Young University) get all the
publicity as the best quarterbacks in the
nation, and they deserve it. All we have
said is that we have an underrated quarter
back."
After Pagels' sixth touchdown pass and a
Stanford fumble deep in it's own territory
an ASU assistant coach asked Rogers, "Is
he going to get another one?"
"Another what?" Rogers replied. After
Pagel hit Ron Wetzel with his seventh TD
pass, the same coach told Rogers, "That's
his seventh one."
"Rogers replied "Seventh what?"
"Seventh touchdown pass."
"Oh. Well, he's having a good day."
Asfaras Pagel isconcerned itwasagood
team day."It still hasn't really soaked in,"
he said. "I didn't know that I was close to
any records, but after the fumble in their
end and they (the ASU coaches) sent in
three pass plays in a row, I knew we were
close to some kind of record."

WHAT'S A PAGEL? — It's not a bagel, pagle, or a beagle, it's a quarterback. ASU' s Mike
Pagel had received very little publicity and suffered through many a misspelling ol his
name before his appearance at Stanford Stadium Saturday. But he should leap into the
NCAA limelight now, just as he leaped into the record books with his seven-tout hdown,
466-yard passing performance.

"Seventh touchdown pass."
"Oh. Well, he's having a good day."
Asfaras Pagel isconcerned itwasagood
team day."It still hasn't really soaked in,"
he said. "I didn't know that I was close to
any records, but after the fumble in their
end and they (the ASU coaches) sent in
three pass plays in a row, I knew we were
close to some kind of record."

WHAT'S A PAGEL? — It's not a bagel, pagle, or a beagle, it's a quarterback. ASU' s Mike
Pagel had received very little publicity and suffered through many a misspelling ol his
name before his appearance at Stanford Stadium Saturday. But he should leap into the
NCAA limelight now, just as he leaped into the record books with his seven-tout hdown,
466-yard passing performance.
It only seems fitting that when any Pacif
ic-10 passing records fall, they should fall at
Stanford, in a typical Stanford football
game.
That game came Saturday, and Pac-10
records did indeed fall. A game that saw
Arizona state quarterback Mike Pagel
throw for 466 yards and 7 touchdowns
both conference records — only to be out
thrown by a combined John Elway-Steve
Cottrell attack of 581 yards.
But sometimes, statistics lie. In this case,
most of Stanford's yardage was piled up by
Cottrell after the outcome of the game was
obvious! ASU routing the Cardinals at
their own game 62-36.
ASU was directed by Pagel, an unsung
quarterback with an offense that until now
earned its supper with the run.
And yet, Pagel remains an old-style
quarterback who possesses only enough
physical attributes to lead a team to vic
tory, not win it by himself.
Pagel, who may never have to see his
name spelled as Pagle again, relaxed aftor
the game with a pinch of tobbacco in his
cheek and the game plays still written on
his wristband.
"I dreamt about games like this," he
said, "but I didn't know if it would ever
come true."
Pagel was the first to credit the team ef
fort that ASU has become known for.

"The offensive line did a great job pro
tecting me today," he said. "I don't think I
got hit all day (he didn't). We knew Stan
ford had a great rushing defense, and that
we'd have to throw the ball. There were
lots of gaps in their secondary and our re
ceivers did a great job of finding them."
After the third play of the game, it was
certain that the Stanford offense was on, as
Elway hit halfback Darrin Nelson with a 70-
yard scoring strike, but Pagel never let
them get away, and the first half turned out
to be a Pagel-Elway shootout.
"If Elway wouldn't have gotten hurt,"
Pagel said, "there's a good possibility that
we would still be out there throwing the
ball around."
To be sure, Cottrell did an excellent job,
but without Elway the strategy changed,
the magic was gone, and ASU was off to the
races.
"Both John and Pagel are great ath
letes," Cottrell commented. "Both can
throw well and both are great scramblers.
It's hard to compare the two because the
offenses are different. Arizona State has a
great running offense and they put more
emphasis on the run, where we put more
emphasis on the pass.
"Mike has a strong arm, but I think John
might throw a little harder," he added.
"They are both just ideally suited for their
type of offenses. I don't think John could
step into their offense and do the job Mike

is doing, and I don't think Mike could step
into our offense and do the things John
can do."
Arizona State coach Daryl Rogers was
not surprised by Pagel's performance, and
was unaware of any records until after the
game, he said.
"We knew that he was the most under
rated quarterback in the nation," he said
of his quarterback. "Elway and McMahon
(Brigham Young University) get all the
publicity as the best quarterbacks in the
nation, and they deserve it. All we have
said is that we have an underrated quarter
back."
After Pagels' sixth touchdown pass and a
Stanford fumble deep in it's own territory
an ASU assistant coach asked Rogers, "Is
he going to get another one?"
"Another what?" Rogers replied. After
Pagel hit Ron Wetzel with his seventh TD
pass, the same coach told Rogers, "That's
his seventh one."
"Rogers replied "Seventh what?"
"Seventh touchdown pass."
"Oh. Well, he's having a good day."
