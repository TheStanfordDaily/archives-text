# Hopp and Schnurpfeil pace women's CC to No.2 ranking
## 
### Dick Hodge 
The Stanford community is
into running. The barrage of
joggers puffing around Lake
Lag or hoofing it down May
field Drive is seemingly end
less. Even President Donald
Kennedy runs. Everyone
knows that — people raffle to
have a chance to run with him.
The women's cross country
team, however, remains the
best kept secret on campus.
Undefeated, ranked second
nationally, and apparently with
a bright future ahead — most
of the runners are freshmen
But there is no secret as to why
the Cards are so successful: the
tremendous performances of
team captain Kim Schnurpfeil

and freshman phenom Ceci
Hopp. They've shared first and
second place at every cross
country meet this year. Nooth
er runners have finished close
to the pair. After all, two's com
pany, three's a crowd.
Success is nothing new to
Kim and Ceci; they've both
seen it before. Ceci, a freshman
from Cos Cob, Connecticut,
was simply the best high school
distance runner in the nation
last year. She won the Kenney
Prep National High School
Championship title, establish
ing her as the best in women's
cross country, and captured
the title in the Junior Naionals
at 3000 meters as well.
"I didn't really take running

seriously until senior year of
high school. Before then I was
running to get into a good col
lege. By the end I wanted to go
to a college with a good run
ning program," explained
Hopp. Whether serious about
running or not, Ceci had col
leges from coast to coast re
cruiting her. She had offers
from Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Virginia, and of course Stan
ford, which she chose, in part
due to the efforts of Coach
Brooks Johnson.
"Brooks called every week
end. He was very persistent,
but not too persistent. I could
feel that he cared about his
runners," she said.
Schnurpfeil, on the other

hand, wasn't even recruited by
Stanford out of high school. Al
though Berkeley contacted her
constantly, she had to call the
Stanford Athletic Department
on her own.
"We couldn't even consider
her for the program with her
high school best in the mile at
5:02," explained Johnson. "She
wouldn't be in our top fifteen
in terms of ranking. Of course,
the program has grown in the
last three years, and so has
Kim." Kim's performance since
at Stanford speaks for itself. As
a freshman she ran the 10th
fastest collegiate time in the
5000 meters, and last year she
became an All American at
5000 and 10,000 meters. Why

the sudden change?
"Kim's a very hard, conscien
tious worker at everything she
does," Johnson raved. "She
also carries an outrageously
high average in her pre- med
studies. She's just a great com
petitor."
The success of the duo is
more remarkable than might
seem at first glance. The victor
of each of the three meets so
far has set a new course record
in the process: Ceci at the
Fresno Invite, Kim at theCal In
vitational, and Ceci again at
home at the Stanford Invita
tional.
These performances have in
spired spectacular team fin
ishes, as Stanford has placed at
least five runners in the top ten
at each meet. Kim and Ceci are
quick to give the credit to
Coach Johnson, whom they
describe as strict and challeng
ing as well as caring and sensi
tive to the needs of his athletes.
"I was late to practice one
day and I never heard the end
of it," said Schnurpfeil. "You
don't talk when he does; when
you're there you concentrate

on running. But I don't want to
make him sound like a slave
driver. He's only strict about
certain things. And he can
sense a personal problem the
minute one arises."
Hopp echoed Kim. "He's re
ally a softie. We are so en
thusiastic that half the time he
tells us not to run as much, to
rest more. Since I've been here
I've completely trusted him."
Because Schnurpfeil is the
established star and the senior
team member as a junior, she
handles the duties of team cap
tain. Ceci feels that Kim does
an excellent job, and that ev
eryone looks up to her — "But
not just in running, in ev
erything,"she said. Kim isquite
modest, however, claiming
that her cooking ability, which
provides food for the team on
occasion, is heronly ingredient
for leadership. "I am the
oldest, but it's really been fun
and easy. I don't have to sell the
program to the girls, they're so
enthusiasticalready,"says Kim.
The two runners seem to be
as compatible as can be, run
ning, swimming, weight train

ing, and even says Coach John
son, sitting together on the bus
on road trips. Though they are
close friends and teammates,
they are fierce competitors and
potential rivals in each race. A
potentially sticky situation be
tween the two has not as yet
developed. "We talk to each
other during the race to relax.
It helps so much just to know
we'll both be out there for sup
port. But there's definite com
petition," said Schurpfeil.
"At workouts it is tough to
tell who's doing better. One
day one will feel good and
carry the pace and another day
it's the other. It's the same in a
race. For the first half we stick
together. But when it gets
down to the last mile, it's dif
ferent. I hate to lose and she
hates to lose."
Competitive drive. Team
Unity. Enthusiasm. These are
the characteristics that should
carry the team through this
year and the years to come.
One thing is for sure though.

seen it before. Ceci, a freshman
from Cos Cob, Connecticut,
was simply the best high school
distance runner in the nation
last year. She won the Kenney
Prep National High School
Championship title, establish
ing her as the best in women's
cross country, and captured
the title in the Junior Naionals
at 3000 meters as well.
"I didn't really take running

seriously until senior year of
high school. Before then I was
running to get into a good col
lege. By the end I wanted to go
to a college with a good run
ning program," explained
Hopp. Whether serious about
running or not, Ceci had col
leges from coast to coast re
cruiting her. She had offers
from Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Virginia, and of course Stan
ford, which she chose, in part
due to the efforts of Coach
Brooks Johnson.
"Brooks called every week
end. He was very persistent,
but not too persistent. I could
feel that he cared about his
runners," she said.
Schnurpfeil, on the other

hand, wasn't even recruited by
Stanford out of high school. Al
though Berkeley contacted her
constantly, she had to call the
Stanford Athletic Department
on her own.
"We couldn't even consider
her for the program with her
high school best in the mile at
5:02," explained Johnson. "She
wouldn't be in our top fifteen
in terms of ranking. Of course,
the program has grown in the
last three years, and so has
Kim." Kim's performance since
at Stanford speaks for itself. As
a freshman she ran the 10th
fastest collegiate time in the
5000 meters, and last year she
became an All American at
5000 and 10,000 meters. Why

the sudden change?
"Kim's a very hard, conscien
tious worker at everything she
does," Johnson raved. "She
also carries an outrageously
high average in her pre- med
studies. She's just a great com
petitor."
The success of the duo is
more remarkable than might
seem at first glance. The victor
of each of the three meets so
far has set a new course record
in the process: Ceci at the
Fresno Invite, Kim at theCal In
vitational, and Ceci again at
home at the Stanford Invita
tional.
These performances have in
spired spectacular team fin
ishes, as Stanford has placed at
least five runners in the top ten
at each meet. Kim and Ceci are
quick to give the credit to
Coach Johnson, whom they
describe as strict and challeng
ing as well as caring and sensi
tive to the needs of his athletes.
"I was late to practice one
day and I never heard the end
of it," said Schnurpfeil. "You
don't talk when he does; when
you're there you concentrate

on running. But I don't want to
make him sound like a slave
driver. He's only strict about
certain things. And he can
sense a personal problem the
minute one arises."
Hopp echoed Kim. "He's re
ally a softie. We are so en
thusiastic that half the time he
tells us not to run as much, to
rest more. Since I've been here
I've completely trusted him."
Because Schnurpfeil is the
established star and the senior
team member as a junior, she
handles the duties of team cap
tain. Ceci feels that Kim does
an excellent job, and that ev
eryone looks up to her — "But
not just in running, in ev
erything,"she said. Kim isquite
modest, however, claiming
that her cooking ability, which
provides food for the team on
occasion, is heronly ingredient
for leadership. "I am the
oldest, but it's really been fun
and easy. I don't have to sell the
program to the girls, they're so
enthusiasticalready,"says Kim.
The two runners seem to be
as compatible as can be, run
ning, swimming, weight train

ing, and even says Coach John
son, sitting together on the bus
on road trips. Though they are
close friends and teammates,
they are fierce competitors and
potential rivals in each race. A
potentially sticky situation be
tween the two has not as yet
developed. "We talk to each
other during the race to relax.
It helps so much just to know
we'll both be out there for sup
port. But there's definite com
petition," said Schurpfeil.
"At workouts it is tough to
tell who's doing better. One
day one will feel good and
carry the pace and another day
it's the other. It's the same in a
race. For the first half we stick
together. But when it gets
down to the last mile, it's dif
ferent. I hate to lose and she
hates to lose."
Competitive drive. Team
Unity. Enthusiasm. These are
the characteristics that should
carry the team through this
year and the years to come.
One thing is for sure though.
Kim Schnurpfeil and Ceci
Hopp are going places. Fast.
The Stanford community is
into running. The barrage of
joggers puffing around Lake
Lag or hoofing it down May
field Drive is seemingly end
less. Even President Donald
Kennedy runs. Everyone
knows that — people raffle to
have a chance to run with him.
The women's cross country
team, however, remains the
best kept secret on campus.
Undefeated, ranked second
nationally, and apparently with
a bright future ahead — most
of the runners are freshmen
But there is no secret as to why
the Cards are so successful: the
tremendous performances of
team captain Kim Schnurpfeil

and freshman phenom Ceci
Hopp. They've shared first and
second place at every cross
country meet this year. Nooth
er runners have finished close
to the pair. After all, two's com
