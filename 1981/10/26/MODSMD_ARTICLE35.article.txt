San Francisco (AP) — Joe Montana
threw a pair of first-period touchdown
passes and later set up two field goals for
the San Francisco 49ers, who ended 15
years of homefield frustration against Los
Angeles by registering a 20-17 National
Football League victory over the Rams yes
terday.
The 49ers, 6-2, won their fifth straight
game and increased their lead in the Na
tional Football Conference West to two
games over Los Angeles and Atlanta, both
4-4. The victory was San Francisco's first at
home over the Rams since 1966.
Montana hit Freddie Solomon on a 14-
yard touchdown pass and connected with
Dwight Clark on a 41-yard yarder, giving
the 49ers an early 14-0 lead. They never
trailed, but it took several big defensive
plays, including five sacks by Fred Dean, to
hold off the Rams.
The Rams' Frank Corral missed two field
goal attempts, including a 45-yard try with
13 seconds remaining in the game, and had
one attempt blocked.
Los Angeles moved to within three
points of the 49ers at 20-17, when Pat
Haden threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to
Wendell Tyler late in the third quarter.
Early in the third period, Dwaine Board
blocked a Corral field goal attempt after
the Rams moved to the San Francisco 8-
yard line.
Corral kicked a 25-yard field goal in the
second quarter and Mike Guman ran two
yards for a Los Angeles touchdown, mak
ing the score 14-10 in the second period.
But the 49ers led 17-10 at halftime, with
Montana's 50-yard completion to Earl

Cooper, setting up a 42-yard field goal by
Ray Wersching.
Montana passed the 49ers into field goal
range late in the third period, when
Wersching hit from 18 yards.
Montana completed a 29-yard pass to
Charle Young and a 12-yarder to Clark
enroute to the field goal by Wersching
which accounted for the 49ers' final
points.
The Rams outgained the 49ers, 401 yards
to 325, and also wasted 166 yards in punt re
turns.
Leroy Irvin, the leading punt-returner in
the NFL, brought back seven kicks for 127
yards. His 46-yard return early in the fourth
period gave Los Angeles a scoring op
portunity, but a sack by Dean ended the
Los Angeles threat.
Midway in the final quarter, the Rams
were stopped at the San Francisco 15, and a
32-yard field goal attempt by Corral hit the
right upright, caromed down and struck
the crossbar and then bounced back into
the end zone.
Haden was sacked six times for 54 yards
in losses. After the final sack, he completed
a fourth-down 33-yard pass to Preston
Dennard, and Corral made the final field
goal attempt. The kick was high enough
but went wide to the left.
The 49ers won before their second larg
est regular season home crowd in 11 sea
sons at Candlestick Park, 59,190.
Oakland (AP) — Kansas City rookie Billy
lackson rushed for three late touchdowns
and linebacker Gary Spani turned back a
final Oakland rally by streaking 91 yards to

score with a recovered fumble as the
Chiefs surged to a 28-17 victory over the
Raiders yesterday.
The come-from-behind National Foot
ball League victory was keyed by quarter
back Steve Fuller, who took over for Bill
Kenney in the third quarter with the Chiefs
trailing 17-0.
Jackson, out of Alabama, ran three yards
with just under two minutes to play for the
winning touchdown as the Chiefs im
proved their record to 6-2 while dropping
Oakland to 3-5.
Fuller ignited the Chiefs late in the third
quarter, engineering a 72-yard drive that
ended with a 29-yard burst by Jackson.
Midway through the final period Fuller
directed a 59-yard drive that ended with a
3-yard touchdown run by Jackson.
On their next possession, the Chiefs
went 83 yards to score on Jackson's three
yard run with 1:57 to play. The touchdown
was set up by a pass interference call on
Lester Hayes in the end zone.
Wilson, who took over from Jim
Plunkett as the Raiders' starting quarter
back the previous week, hit Morris Brad
shaw with a 6-yard scoring pass less than
two and a half minutes into the game.
The touchdown was set up when Johnny
Robinson recovered a bad Kansas City
snap on the second play of the game.
Early in the second period, Wilson found
Cliff Branch with a 53-yard pass to the
Chiefs' 8-yard line, and three plays later
the second-year pro bootlegged six yards
to make it 14-0.
Chris Bahr added a 51-yard field goal at
the end of the half for the Raiders.
