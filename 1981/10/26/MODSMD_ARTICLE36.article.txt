# Second toppling of No.1
## Card booters beat Seattle-Pacific 
### Adam Berns 
Once again the Stanford soc
?r team proved it has the abili
(to beat any team in the na
on. Saturday the Cardinals
loroughly dominated the
jattle-Pacific Falcons in a
unning 3-0 upset. Coming
ito the game, Seattle-Pacific
as the top-ranked division II
;am in the nation.
The game started out with a
Quple of quick breaks on both
des but after things settled
own, Stanford's midfield
arted to control the tempo of
it game. Early in the game the
nly things that prevented
tanford from scoring were a
?w passes which went just a lit
e too far.
However, the Cardinalssoon
?ctified the situation when
eshman midfielder Angel
asquez scored early in the
rst half on an assist from sen
>r Barry Linnett and sophmore
arge Titinger. The Falcon goal
eeper had a tendency of com
lg out of the box and Vas
uez's goal caught him out of
osition. Throughout the rest
112 the first half Stanford con

sistently pressured Seattle-Pa
cific and played well in the
midfield.
The second half started off
quickly with the Falcons taking
several shots at the Stanford
goal. Goalkeeper David Mann,
starting his first game as a
Cardinal, did an excellent job
making several key saves at the
Stanford goal.
This penetration into
Cardinal territory was getting
dangerous and the Cardinals
definitely needed to get the
game back towards the middle
of the field where they had
been dominating all day. On
the sidelines, Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge could be heard
yelling, "Take the pressure off
yourselves and release the
ball." Within a couple of
minutes that's exactly what
Stanford did, ending Seattle-
Pacific's only real threat of the
day.
A couple of minutes later,
the Cardinals struck back with
Titinger putting the ball in the
corner of the goal. The play was
set up on an excellent 30-yard
pass by senior defender Jack

McGannon.
After the goal, the Cardinals
really took control of the game.
Like a hawk sensing the kill,
Stanford controlled the ball,
consistently pressuring the
Falcons. Particularly impressive
was Titinger. Although he was
playing with a sprained knee,
he was still beating two-to
three defenders on the left
side, freeing up the middle for
the Stanford attack.
Stanford closed out the
game with McGannon scoring
a goal near the end of the sec
ond half with an assist from Tit
inger. McGannon's goal was
also important in that it typified
the support the Stanford of
fense was getting from the mid
field throughout the game.
After the game, a very en
thused Lodge was grinning
from ear to ear. "I'm just really
excited," he said. "We played
so well today. Without a doubt
this is our best game of the
year. It's even sounder than
our game against Connecti
cut."
Why did Stanford play so
well? Lodge said that it is the

first game where everything
finally clicked. "We combined
everything today," he noted.
"We played excellent defense,
dominated the midfield, and
had a fluid offensive attack.
This was a total team effort, the
type of game we've been trying
to play all year."
One individual who de
serves special notice is Vas
quez. One has to wonder
whether he's really one person
because he seemed to be five
places at once, and clearly dic
tated the tempo of the game.
"Angel was the player of the
game," Lodge said. "He was all
over the midfield and initiated
most of our attacks."
Tomorrow, Stanford will try
to maintain its winning ways by
taking on Cal-Poly SLO here at
Harry Maloney field.
Lodge said that Cal Poly is an
energetic team with a new
coach and will not offer the
Cardinals a chance to let down.
"The key is the same as it was
on Saturday. It's going to take a
total team effort to win," he
said.

BOOTERS BUST OUT â€” The Stanford soccer team defeated Seattle-Pacific Saturday 3-0.
It was the second time this season the Cardinals have overcome a No.l ranked team; the
first was a 2-0 upset over the University of Connecticut. The victory could conceivably
put the Cards back in line for some post-season play.
