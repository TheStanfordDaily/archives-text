# No. 1 Card poloists whip Aggies
## 
### Chris Addington 
The sun was warm, the sky was clear and
ounds of tailgating rippled through the
lir. All the ingredients of a Stanford Satur
fay were present. It was a heartbreaker for
hose in the stadium, but another routine
match for the boys at deGuerre.
I On this sunny Saturday the Stanford wa
iter polo team took on the UC-Davis Aggies
at deGuerre pool and stretched their string
of victories to 20 for the season.
The game was typical of almost every
Stanford match thus far this season. The
Stanford game plan, which works like a
machine in its quickness and ferdcity, can
be summed up in one word: coun
terattack.
And so, when the Cardinals feasted on
Davis, it was the counter which told the
story. Stanford blazed to a 7-0 first quarter
lead and increased that to 11-1 by the half.
From that point on Coach Dante Det
tamanti substituted freely and the final on
the scoreboard read 16-2. The game was to
put it lightly, a rout.
Dettamanti was proud of the play of his
second unit, which has seen a lot of action
this year. "The second team played really
well" he said, "It's hard to evaluate the
play of the game when people are coming

in and out off the bench, but overall I was
pleased." he added.
Senior Chris Kelsey lead all scorers with
five, followed by Jeff Stiling with three, and
Jody Campbell and Greg Lambert with two
each.
Stanford has manhandled so many
teams this year that many people might ask
the question "What makes the Cardinals
so good?" Perhaps the key lies in balance.
There is no standout player in the starting
seven; they're all incredible. Every game
has a different leading scorer and a dif
ferent pace-setter. Six of the Cardinals
players have scored 20 goals or more. Ev
eryone helps, everyone assists, and the
scoreboard lights up like a video machine.
Another insight into Stanford's success
can be seen in the score by quarters. The
Cards have been out-scoring their oppo
nents almost 8-1 in the first period, and 5-1
in the first half. Most teams find them
selves so far behind at the half that their
morale is gone, and Stanford cruises to an
easy victory.
In total scores Stanford has tallied 274
goals for an average of almost 14 per game.
Meanwhile, at the other end of the pool,
the iron curtain defense anchored by sen
ior goalkeeper Vince Vanelli has only al

lowed a stingy 4.5 goals per match.
Well, maybe it's just an incredibly lucky
year for Stanford. Hardly. Over the past 6Vi
years the Cardinals have amassed an amaz
ing 158-19-3 record. Stanford has won the
NCAA championships three times in 1976,
'78, '80, and finished third in both the years
they didn't win.
In the personnel department Stanford
has had 30 NCAA All-Americans, including
four who play this year, 11 World Univer
sity team members, 11 Pan-American team
members and 18 Olympians, including
present hole man Campbell.
Perhaps the most amazing tribute to the
power of the Stanford water polo team oc
cured last spring when the team took on
the Yugoslavian National Team. The
Cardinals battled the Yugoslavs to a 10-10
tie in the exhibition match. The Yugo
slavians, it should be mentioned, won the
silver medal at the 1980 Olympics.
Will this juggernaut ever slow down? In
all likelihood, yes. Next year Stanford loses
six seniors to the world of graduation and
the race for the NCAA crown will be wide
open. But in the past six years the Stanford
water polo team has created a legend that
won't be soon forgotten in the annals of
NCAA sports history.

From that point on Coach Dante Det
tamanti substituted freely and the final on
the scoreboard read 16-2. The game was to
put it lightly, a rout.
Dettamanti was proud of the play of his
second unit, which has seen a lot of action
this year. "The second team played really
well" he said, "It's hard to evaluate the
play of the game when people are coming

in and out off the bench, but overall I was
pleased." he added.
Senior Chris Kelsey lead all scorers with
five, followed by Jeff Stiling with three, and
Jody Campbell and Greg Lambert with two
each.
Stanford has manhandled so many
teams this year that many people might ask
the question "What makes the Cardinals
so good?" Perhaps the key lies in balance.
There is no standout player in the starting
seven; they're all incredible. Every game
has a different leading scorer and a dif
ferent pace-setter. Six of the Cardinals
players have scored 20 goals or more. Ev
eryone helps, everyone assists, and the
scoreboard lights up like a video machine.
Another insight into Stanford's success
can be seen in the score by quarters. The
Cards have been out-scoring their oppo
nents almost 8-1 in the first period, and 5-1
in the first half. Most teams find them
selves so far behind at the half that their
morale is gone, and Stanford cruises to an
easy victory.
In total scores Stanford has tallied 274
goals for an average of almost 14 per game.
Meanwhile, at the other end of the pool,
the iron curtain defense anchored by sen
ior goalkeeper Vince Vanelli has only al

lowed a stingy 4.5 goals per match.
Well, maybe it's just an incredibly lucky
year for Stanford. Hardly. Over the past 6Vi
years the Cardinals have amassed an amaz
ing 158-19-3 record. Stanford has won the
NCAA championships three times in 1976,
'78, '80, and finished third in both the years
they didn't win.
In the personnel department Stanford
has had 30 NCAA All-Americans, including
four who play this year, 11 World Univer
sity team members, 11 Pan-American team
members and 18 Olympians, including
present hole man Campbell.
Perhaps the most amazing tribute to the
power of the Stanford water polo team oc
cured last spring when the team took on
the Yugoslavian National Team. The
Cardinals battled the Yugoslavs to a 10-10
tie in the exhibition match. The Yugo
slavians, it should be mentioned, won the
silver medal at the 1980 Olympics.
Will this juggernaut ever slow down? In
all likelihood, yes. Next year Stanford loses
six seniors to the world of graduation and
the race for the NCAA crown will be wide
open. But in the past six years the Stanford
water polo team has created a legend that
won't be soon forgotten in the annals of
NCAA sports history.
The sun was warm, the sky was clear and
ounds of tailgating rippled through the
lir. All the ingredients of a Stanford Satur
fay were present. It was a heartbreaker for
hose in the stadium, but another routine
match for the boys at deGuerre.
I On this sunny Saturday the Stanford wa
iter polo team took on the UC-Davis Aggies
at deGuerre pool and stretched their string
of victories to 20 for the season.
The game was typical of almost every
Stanford match thus far this season. The
Stanford game plan, which works like a
machine in its quickness and ferdcity, can
be summed up in one word: coun
terattack.
And so, when the Cardinals feasted on
Davis, it was the counter which told the
story. Stanford blazed to a 7-0 first quarter
lead and increased that to 11-1 by the half.
From that point on Coach Dante Det
tamanti substituted freely and the final on
