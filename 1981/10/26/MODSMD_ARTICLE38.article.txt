Europeans protest arms race
More than 300,000 demonstrators rallied in
three European countries yesterday to protest a
U.S.-Soviet arms buildup they claim threatens
world peace.
In Brussels, at least 200,000 people staged
what police sources said was the largest demon
stration in Belgium since World War 11, while
more than 50,000 marchers paraded through
Paris and a similar number rallied in eastern sec
tor of Berlin.
Reflecting a growing tide of pacifism across
Europe, the protests followed similar demon
strations Saturday that drew more than 200,000
in Rome and 150,000 in London. Two weeks
ago, 250,000 anti-nuclear protesters rallied in
Bonn, West Germany.
Government ministers and leaders of politi
cal parties led the three-hour march that com
pletely jammed downtown Brussels.
Officially, police said there were only 65,000
demonstrators, but police sources admitted
that crowd was closer to the 200,000 esti
mated by reporters on the scene.
Although Belgium's outgoing left-center
coalition government was not officially sup
porting the demonstration, its parties all were
represented by Parliament members. At least
three Socialist members of the government
marched in front of the peaceful cortege, to
gether with chairmen of the Socialist and Com
munist parties.
In France and Belgium, the demonstrators
demanded dismantling of Soviet SS-20 missiles
aimed at the continent and protested U.S. plans
to deploy new U.S. Pershing II and cruise nucle
ar missiles in Britian, West Germany, Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands. The latter two
countries have postponed final approval of the
missile plans.
In Berlin, about 50,000 East Germans rallied
"for a secure peace and against NATO arma
ments," accusing the West of trying "to turn Eu
rope into an atomic battlefield," the official
ADN news agency said.
The agency said speakers called for an end to
the arms race, a ban on neutron weapons and
East-West talks on arms control.
The United States and Soviet Union have
scheduled talks .to begin Nov. 30 in Geneva,
Switzerland, on reducing nuclear arms in Eu
rope. Talks on controlling intercontinental misj
siles are expected to begin in early 1982, Reagan
administration officials say.
AWACS gaining more support
Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
fighting to save his $8.5 billion aircraft sale to
Saudi Arabia from congressional veto, told re
porters Saturday that the sale constitutes the
"greatest security" for both the United States
and Israel, and senators who refuse to see that
"are not doing their country a service."
In comments upon his return to Washington
from the 22-nation summit meeting in Cancun,
Mexico, Reagan said he had no intention of
withdrawing the proposal for the sale of the Air
borne Warning and Control System planes, and
repeated that ne was "cautious but optimistic"
that the sale would go through.
CBS News reported Saturday night that at
least fdur Republican senators currently on rec-.
ord as opposing the sale have promised Senate
Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) that
they will'change their votes at the last minute.
Republican Senate leadership sources, asked
about the report, quoted Baker as saying "it's
clear there will be switches," but they added he
will not say at this point how many there will be.
The president plans to mount a final lobbying
effort today that White House officials said
would continue up to 5 p.m. Wednesday, when

the Senate is scheduled to vote on the con
troversial deal. Administration officials said he
will see 18 senators in individual meetings
before the Wednesday vote.
Reagan has invited eight senators to the
White House today in an effort to reverse the
majority now on record as intending to vote for
a resolution opposing the sale.
Earthquake rocks Mexico City
Mexico City — A strong earthquake lasting
about three minutes shook Mexico City Satur
day night, rocking buildings and knocking out
power in a widespread area of the city.
Early newspaper reports said one person was
killed when part of a power pole fell, and that
others were injured fleeing theaters, restau
rantsand hotels. There was no official confirma
tion of the reports.
Residents described the quake as one of the
sharpest jolts in recent years. The quake
knocked out much of the area's telephone ser
vice, hampering efforts to determine effects of
the tremor.
The quake felled plaster, tripped burglar
alarms and snuffed out traffic lights in this capi
tal of 15 million people, and several accidents
were reported along major thoroughfares.
The Tacubaya Seismological Center said the
quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale,
capable of causing severe damage. The
epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean about 300
miles southwest, origin of many quakes that
shake this earthquake-prone nation, the center
said.
However, the U.S. Geological Survey's Earth
quake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
said the quake measured 7.1 on the Richter
scale of the center's seismograph, putting it in
the range of a major quake. Spokesman Frank
Baldwin pinpointed theepicenteron the Pacific
coast at a point about 220 miles southwest of the
capital.
Early newspaper reports said the quake was
felt in at least eight surrounding states but ap
parency only slightly in the state of Oaxaca to
the southwest, which Mexican seismologists
said was closest to the epicenter.
In the Holiday Inn a chunk of concrete fell
from an expansion beam joiningthe hotel's two
towers forcing some fleeing guests to jump a
three-foot chasm on the 15th floor to get to the
elevator.
Polish troops dispatched
Warsaw, Poland — Declaring that "ex
traordinary situations require extraordinary
measures," the Communist government is dis
patching troops to back up local officials in
some 2,000 Polish villages, it was disclosed yes
terday.
Accusing the independent labor federation
Solidarity of "blackmail," the government also
demanded an end to wildcat strikes by more
than 250,000 workers.
Gen. Tadeusz Hupalowski, minister of admin
istration, said the special military units would
fan out across Poland today to "help solve local
conflicts."
"Extraordinary situations require ex
traordinary measures," he said.
The government's actions did not appear to
be a step toward martial law, Western diplomat
ic observers said.
"We are facing winter and people are anx
ious," Hupalowski told Polish television. "The
situation is getting worse and the government is
doing everything it can to make survival pos
sible."
The government of Premier Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who has also served as head of the

Communist Party since last week, pledged Fri
day to send the units across Poland to help
move food to market, ease problems with fuel
distribution and "solve local conflicts."
The posting of small operational units of of
ficers and seasoned troops whose two-year en
listments have been extended appears to be an
economic move amid a deteriorating market
and fuel situation.
Local Solidarity chapters met across Poland to
assess the government move while planning for
anticipated winter difficulties and preparing for
a national warning strike Wednesday.
Initial reaction to the government's an
nouncement Friday ranged from indifference
to acceptance among leaders of the independ
ent labor federation.
Many union officials said they would wel
come the military presence if the troops help
improve the sometimes drastic food situation in
the countryside or provide more fuel and coal
to people there.
Illegitimate births increasing
Washington — Out-of-wedlock births in
creased 50 percent in the last decade to where
at least one of every six American babies now is
born to an unwed mother, new government
figures show.
Well over half — 55 percent — of all black
babies in 1979 were born to unwed mothers. Yet
the increase in out-of-wedlock births among
teen-agers is significantly greater for whites
than blacks, according to federal Census and
health statistics.
Experts say the increase is due to more wom
en wanting to wait until they are older to marry.
An unwed mother who decides to keep her
child also suffers less of a social stigma now.
"It's clear that the propensity to keep out of
wedlock children is rising," said Kristin Moore,
a specialist in teen-age pregnancy and out-of
wedlock births at the Urban Institute in Wash
ington. "This has always been true among
blacks but it's now true among whites. It's more
acceptable."
There are 6.4 million more women of child
bearing age in the United States now than a
decade ago — an increase of 4 percent. But ov
erall childbearing by unmarried women in
creased 6.1 percent over the same time, says the
National Center for Health Statistics.
In 1979, the most recent year for which com
prehensive national statistics have been com
piled, there were an estimated 597,800 out-of
wedlock babies born in America, accounting
for an estimated 17 percent of all births. In 1970,
unwed mothers had 399,000 babies, 10.7 per
cent of all births for the year.
Figures for 1980 and 1981 are unavailable, but
Stephanie Ventura of the Center for Health
Statistics said the rate of births to unwed moth
ers rose substantially between 1978 and 1979.
In 1970, 38 percent of all black babies were
born out of wedlock, compared with 55 percent
in 1979. For white babies, the percentage born
to unwed mothers rose from 5.7 in 1970 to 9.4 in
1979.
While many young women are making unin
formed decisions about their sexual activity and
contraceptives, Moore said, once they are
pregnant they seem to think more carefully
about whether to marry and have the child.
