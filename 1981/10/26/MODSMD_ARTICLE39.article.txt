The committee mentioned in Oct.
13's article "Student scholar's China
conduct investigated" was estab
lished to investigate the professional
conduct of a Ph.D. candidate, not to
determine whether the student's
conduct seriously hampered Sino-
American educational exchange as
reported. Sources claim that research
mistakes were made in Steven
Mosher's work; however the pro
fessors who were formerly oversee
ing the student's work made no such
claim.
Also, in regard to the Oct. 7 article
"Oxford denies Stanford Overseas,"
several clarifications are in order.
First, Stanford has no pfans of buying
any property in Oxford, but rather
plans to lease any property needed.
Secondly, no ties with other British
universities are under consideration,
although inquiries have been re
ceived. The Daily regrets any misun
derstanding caused by these errors.
