# Reagan advisers abound at Hoover

### Kathy Bodovitz 
"The highlight of the past year was
the election of Honorary Fellow
Ronald W. Reagan as President of the
United States." Thus begins the 1981
report of the Board of Overseers of
the Hoover Institution.
Hoover's pride in Reagan's elec
tion is easy to understand. Of Hoo
ver's 50 resident scholars, nearly 30
are advising Reagan in some capaci
ty, according to Hoover media rela
tions assistant Maryann Gilpatricl^.
Included in the 30 are six Hoover
fellows with full-time, White House
based government positions, who
therefore are currently on leave from
Hoover. Martin Anderson, senior fel
low, is assistant to the president for
policy development; Richard Allen,
former senior fellow, is assistant to
the president for national security af

fairs; Darrell Trent, senior research
fellow, is deputy secretary of trans
portation; and John Cogan, senior
research fellow, is the designate for
assistant secretary of labor for policy
evaluation and research.
In international affairs, Philip
Habib, senior research fellow, is assis
tant to the president for national se
curity affairs, and Richard Staar, Sen
ior Fellow, is the designate to be am
bassador to the Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction negotiations in Vi
enna.
Gilpatrick said the other 24 "seem
to go quite frequently to Washing
ton," as well as advise via telephone
conversations. And many of those
people are on Reagan's economic
policy advisory board.
As Senior Research Fellow George
Marotta pointed out, each of these

people "is one of the few experts by
definition in his field. So no matter
who the president is, these people
have to be involved."
Reagan's first link to the institution
was established when he appointed
Hoover Director Glenn Campbell to
the University of California Board of
Regents in 1968.
Then, in 1975 Reagan donated all
of his gubernatorial papers to the
Hoover Institution. He later added
his 1976 campaign paper§. "The Rea
gan collection,"Marotta said, "is the
biggest one here."
Later in 1975, Reagan was made an
honorary fellow of the Hoover In
stitution. "Thus," Gilpatrick said, "he
knew what was going on at Hoover,
the research being done and the
caliber of the people." (Hoover has
two other honorary fellows: Soviet
author Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
economist Friedrich Hayek.)
Reagan's established link con
tinues to flourish. A more recent
Hoover influence on the adminis
traton is The United States in the
1980s, a book published by the Hoo
ver Institution Press and edited by
senior fellows Alvin Rabushka and
Peter Duignan.
The 916-page volume, which came

out early this year, is a collection of
essays on domestic issues and foreign
affairs. According to the foreword by
Campbell, "The authors analyze the
central issues, describe the policy op
tions open to the country, and rec
ommend specific courses of action to
deal with or mitigate the problems
confronting the United States."
Duignan said, "It's a very impor
tant book with 32 looking at
what faces the U.S. in 1980. It was
written as an agenda for whoever be

came president in 1980, as an analysis
of what the U.S. has to do."
Of the book's 32 contributors,
Duignan said 22 were people who
ended up being Reagan's foreign
and domestic political advisers. "For
example, Fred Charles Ikle, wfVo
wrote the chapter on nuclear arms
and the arms race, is now the No. 3
man in the Department of Defense.
So his views are part of the thinking
of the administration now," Duignan
explained.

Many of the other essays, Duignan
said, focused on the need to rearm,
to contain communism, and to
deploy forces overseas. "We don't
know which were our ideas alone or
which they (the administration) had
been thinking already," he said. But
half a dozen of the authors are now in
high or mediumhigh government
positions, according to Duignan.
The book was financed from Hoo
ver's general funds, and has sold
more than 20,000 copies.

was established when he appointed
Hoover Director Glenn Campbell to
the University of California Board of
Regents in 1968.
Then, in 1975 Reagan donated all
of his gubernatorial papers to the
Hoover Institution. He later added
his 1976 campaign paper§. "The Rea
gan collection,"Marotta said, "is the
biggest one here."
Later in 1975, Reagan was made an
honorary fellow of the Hoover In
stitution. "Thus," Gilpatrick said, "he
knew what was going on at Hoover,
the research being done and the
caliber of the people." (Hoover has
two other honorary fellows: Soviet
author Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
economist Friedrich Hayek.)
Reagan's established link con
tinues to flourish. A more recent
Hoover influence on the adminis
traton is The United States in the
1980s, a book published by the Hoo
ver Institution Press and edited by
senior fellows Alvin Rabushka and
Peter Duignan.
The 916-page volume, which came

out early this year, is a collection of
essays on domestic issues and foreign
affairs. According to the foreword by
Campbell, "The authors analyze the
central issues, describe the policy op
tions open to the country, and rec
ommend specific courses of action to
deal with or mitigate the problems
confronting the United States."
Duignan said, "It's a very impor
tant book with 32 looking at
what faces the U.S. in 1980. It was
written as an agenda for whoever be

came president in 1980, as an analysis
of what the U.S. has to do."
Of the book's 32 contributors,
Duignan said 22 were people who
ended up being Reagan's foreign
and domestic political advisers. "For
example, Fred Charles Ikle, wfVo
wrote the chapter on nuclear arms
and the arms race, is now the No. 3
man in the Department of Defense.
So his views are part of the thinking
of the administration now," Duignan
explained.

Many of the other essays, Duignan
said, focused on the need to rearm,
to contain communism, and to
deploy forces overseas. "We don't
know which were our ideas alone or
which they (the administration) had
been thinking already," he said. But
half a dozen of the authors are now in
high or mediumhigh government
positions, according to Duignan.
The book was financed from Hoo
ver's general funds, and has sold
more than 20,000 copies.
"The highlight of the past year was
the election of Honorary Fellow
Ronald W. Reagan as President of the
United States." Thus begins the 1981
report of the Board of Overseers of
the Hoover Institution.
Hoover's pride in Reagan's elec
tion is easy to understand. Of Hoo
ver's 50 resident scholars, nearly 30
are advising Reagan in some capaci
ty, according to Hoover media rela
tions assistant Maryann Gilpatricl^.
Included in the 30 are six Hoover
fellows with full-time, White House
based government positions, who
therefore are currently on leave from
Hoover. Martin Anderson, senior fel
low, is assistant to the president for
policy development; Richard Allen,
former senior fellow, is assistant to
the president for national security af

fairs; Darrell Trent, senior research
fellow, is deputy secretary of trans
portation; and John Cogan, senior
research fellow, is the designate for
assistant secretary of labor for policy
evaluation and research.
In international affairs, Philip
Habib, senior research fellow, is assis
tant to the president for national se
curity affairs, and Richard Staar, Sen
ior Fellow, is the designate to be am
bassador to the Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction negotiations in Vi
enna.
Gilpatrick said the other 24 "seem
to go quite frequently to Washing
ton," as well as advise via telephone
conversations. And many of those
people are on Reagan's economic
policy advisory board.
As Senior Research Fellow George
Marotta pointed out, each of these

people "is one of the few experts by
definition in his field. So no matter
who the president is, these people
have to be involved."
