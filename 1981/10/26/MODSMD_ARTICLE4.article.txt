# Reagan advisers abound at Hoover

"The highlight of the past year was
the election of Honorary Fellow
Ronald W. Reagan as President of the
United States." Thus begins the 1981
report of the Board of Overseers of
the Hoover Institution.
Hoover's pride in Reagan's elec
tion is easy to understand. Of Hoo
ver's 50 resident scholars, nearly 30
are advising Reagan in some capaci
ty, according to Hoover media rela
tions assistant Maryann Gilpatricl^.
Included in the 30 are six Hoover
fellows with full-time, White House
based government positions, who
therefore are currently on leave from
Hoover. Martin Anderson, senior fel

policy development; Richard Allen,
former senior fellow, is assistant to
the president for national security af

fairs; Darrell Trent, senior research
fellow, is deputy secretary of trans

research fellow, is the designate for
assistant secretary of labor for policy
evaluation and research.
In international affairs, Philip
Habib, senior research fellow, is assis

policy advisory board.

Marotta pointed out, each of these

people "is one of the few experts by
definition in his field. So no matter
who the president is, these people
have to be involved."
Reagan's first link to the institution
was established when he appointed
Hoover Director Glenn Campbell to
the University of California Board of
Regents in 1968.
Then, in 1975 Reagan donated all
of his gubernatorial papers to the
Hoover Institution. He later added
his 1976 campaign paperÂ§. "The Rea
gan collection,"Marotta said, "is the
biggest one here."
Later in 1975, Reagan was made an
honorary fellow of the Hoover In
stitution. "Thus," Gilpatrick said, "he
knew what was going on at Hoover,
the research being done and the
caliber of the people." (Hoover has
