# University's policy risks conflicts of interest here
##

University policy regarding con
flicts of interest allows faculty and
personnel a greater degree of privacy
in their own research committments
than is available at most other institu
tions in the country. According to
University officials, this promotes
greater academic diversity and
creates less of a "policing" at
mosphere among professors here.
But this policy also increases the
risk of a conflict of interest remaining
unchallenged. Such a conflict, for in
stance, could involve a professor
doing research for a company he or
she has a financial interest in, or a
professor spending large amounts of
time on outside consulting which de
tracts from University activities.
The privileged position of Stanford
employees was emphasized by hear
ings held earlier this month to in
vestigate potential conflicts of in
terest by University of California pro
fessors. California Rural Legal As
sistance (CRLA) had filed a petition
charging that UC personnel were
benefitting financially from research
activities conducted at public ex
pense.
One of the many cases which they
cited was a professor in the Land, Air
and Water Resources Department at
UC-Davis who was to help direct re
search conducted under a $2.5 mil
lion contract, funded through a re
search company in which the pro
fessor is an officer.
The Fair Political Practices Com
mission decided to reopen hearings
as to whether UC professors should
be exempt from the state's conflict of
interest laws.
According to Gail Chase of CRLA,
Stanford is exempt from these laws
because of its private status. The Uni
versity is thus subject only to its own
policies for reporting research ac
tivities. And this policy, until last
week, required only that professors
"report fully the level of such ac
tivities upon request by relevant Uni
versity officers."
Last week, on the recommenda
tion of last year's Committee on Re
search, the Academic Senate voted
to amend this policy. In questions re
garding apparent or potential con
flicts of interest between consulting
activities and the faculty member's
Univeristy duties, the faculty mem
ber is now required to disclose, upon
request, "the names of companies
for whom he/she consults, the gen
eral nature of each consulting agree
ment (as opposed to detailed techni
cal aspects) and the number of days
committed per consulting agree
ment."
Thus there is nothing which man
dates professors to disclose any

potential conflicts.
Eric Hutchinson, a professor of
chemistry here and chairman of the
Academic Senate Committee on Re
search last year, stated that University
policy on conflict of interest dis
closure is regulated by the concept of
an Honor Code.
"The Honor Code is central to the
University, and it is expected to be
adhered to in all circumstances, in
cluding the reporting of conflict of
interest," he said.

Hutchinson said the new policy
asks "for a minimum amount of in
formation. We did not ask, for exam
ple, that the professor disclose the
amount of money he or she would
receive, as that would be an infringe
ment on privacy," he said.
Other universities, however, are
much more stringent in their poli
cies. According to Mary Rowe, in
ternal counsel for the Massachusets
Institute of Technology, all per
sonnel at that school "must inform
department heads (in writing) of all
outside activities, contracts, etc.,
before agreeing to undertake them.
"Part of our acknowledgement of
the terrific work of the people here is
that they are wanted by government
and industry for advice and/or re
search," she said. "We strongly en
courage outside liaisons, yet this way
we can monitor the time spent and
catch people who might deliberately
abuse consulting privileges at the ex
pense of MIT."
University President Donald Ken
nedy, however, maintained that oth
er universities must operate on an
honor code system as Stanford does.
"Other universities, whether they
require mandatory disclosure of out
side activities or not, don't check to
verify that each professor has re
ported all outside commitments," he
said. He added that whenever Stan
ford requires disclosure from the
professors (such as for auditing
purposes), "we can get it."
"Our policy encourages employ
ees to work with the University," said
Earl Cilley, director of the Office of
Sponsored Projects here. "My ex
perience is that most faculty mem
bers are quite sensitive to potential
conflict of interest, as it doesn't re
flect well on anybody."
Cilley said the recent amendments
in University policy are "more a mat
ter of being able to reassure the Uni
