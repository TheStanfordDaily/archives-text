# Investment responsibility group seeks effective means of change

May 10,1977 — Two-hundred ninety-four Stanford
students protesting the University's investments in
companies doing business in South Africa are ar
rested at the Old Union.
Dec. 27, 1977 — T/je Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR) replaces an earlier advisory com
mittee. The 12-member commission elects to en
courage ethical corporate practices by voting Stan
ford's stock on appropriate resolutions at stock
holders' meetings.
lime 9,1981 — The Commission votes 8-4 in favor of
a one-year moratorium on voting on stockholders'
resolutions. The ClR's report from the meeting states,
"the effort simply isn't worth the time and labor of the
faculty, alumni, students and staff involved." It con
tinues, "Stockholder resolutions ... do not appear to
be of any significance in changing corporate behav
ior" since they rarely receive more than 5 percent of
the vote.
The CIR will use this year to find better ways of pro
moting socially responsible corporate behavior, ac
cording to Director of Government Affairs Larry
Horton, a CIR co-chairman last year. However, he
does not expect the commission to make a report un
til the spring.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, the other co-chairman
last year, explained the problems that faced the com
mission in the past. The CIR would meet for eight
hours every Thursday to discuss resolutions sub
mitted by activist groups on issues ranging from ad
vertising by infant formula manufacturers to hazard
ous waste storage, Heller said.
As Stanford owns stock in more than 200 corpo
rations, and most stockholders' meetings occur in the
spring, the commission often felt rushed, according
to its June report. The CIR would usually have three
weeks to study a proposal, debate a resolution's mer
its, forward its recommendation to the trustees, and
have the trustees take action before a stockholders'
meeting.
According to Heller, many resolutions were poorly
worded or set unrealistic goals. He described CIR
members as anxious to do something about apart
heid, but said companies are limited by the laws of the
countries in which they do business. Companies must
be judged by their own actions, and cannot be ex

pectedlo'df business only in democracies, he said.
Like Heller, ex-officio CIR member Rodney Adams,
the University's director of finance, complained of
"overzealous language" in resolutions. He called the
moratorium "a brave thing to do." Adams believes
that while many issues remain to be solved, the com
mission, in many cases, is "fighting over battle
grounds that have already been won."
He suggested that through the efforts of groups
such as the CIR, corporations have been made aware
bf their responsibilities. Ten years ago the chairman of
an international corporation would have been unable
to name his company's: holdings in South Africa,
Adams said. Now that, chairman would know the
South African manager by name and would have vis
ited the country recenjtly.
Ken Perez, one of four students on last year's com
mission, disagrees with the majority decision. He feels
"the moratorium is not as active" a policy as the one
pursued last year. Yet he admits the CIR nas not suc
ceeded in its goals of informing the publicand chang
ing corporate policy. He, too, would like to find more
effective means of action.
As the Commission reforms this there are few
concrete suggestions for dis
misses divestment as an ineffective means of influenc
ing behavior, because Stanford owns too little stock in
any one corporation to affect it greatly. Horton sug
gests examining what other schools have done.
Heller suggests concentrating on one or two issues
a year, using Stanford research organizations to publi
cize findings, and, in extreme cases, divesting stock
while delivering a strong public statement explaining
the school's actions. This would allow the commission
to examine issues more thoroughly.
Perez believes the rightward shift in American for
eign policy has been accompanied by a conservative
shift in Stanford's student body. He believes the com
mission's chief value is as an educational tool. Perez
fears student members appointed this year will lose
the experience of ethical aebate that went into each
decision on a resolution.
While the commission debates the alternatives this
year, its public voice will be muted until the spring.
Perez worries about that. "We're on»a fishing expedi
tion," he said, "and most of the lake is closed."
