## Thousands in Britain protest arms race 
### Washington Post 
London — About 250,000 people dem
onstrated here Saturday in Britain's biggest
march and rally against nuclear weapons,
reflecting the recent strong resurgence of
the nuclear disarmament movement.
The all-day demonstration, the first of
several planned in Western Europeancapi
tals to mark U.N. Disarmament Week, was
similar in size to an large West German nu
clear disarmament rally two weeks ago in
Bonn! In Brussels, Belgium, 200,000 people

'America has to be told that it's Europe's business to
decide how to defend itself/
— British demonstrator

gathered yesterday to protest the East-
West arms race, as did 50,000 in Paris.
'Tf]p swelling crowd was urged in
speeches, songs and poems to do ev
erything possible to ban American and
British nuclear weapons from this country
and advance disarmament in the West and
East.
"This is one of the greatest days in the
history of this democracy," opposition
Labour Party leader Michael Foot told the
crowd. "The size of this demonstration
shows that we are not prepared to give in
to the dictates of the arms race."

Foot, other speakersand many marchers
attributed Saturday's large turnout and
other signs of considerable growth in nu
clear disarmament sentiment during the
past year here to growing fears that the
United States and the Soviet Union might
fight a limited nuclear war in Europe, spar
ing their own homelands.
They said these fears were heightened
when President Ronald Reagan said a
week ago that he could envision the ex
change of tactical nuclear weapons on a

European battlefield "without it bringing
either one of the major powers to pushing
the button."
"No American president should talk in
such terms," said Foot, a veteran disarma
ment campaigner whose party's policy is to
ban all nuclear weapons and American
bases from Britain if the party regains
power.
"I can't dismiss (Reagan's remarks) as a
gaffe," Foot told reportersat Saturday's ral
ly, "because the Western alliance strategy
is based on a so-called flexible response
(adopted by NATO in 1967) in which in

some circumstances the West could strike
first" with battlefield nuclear weapons.
He and other speakers said the disarma
ment movement's first priority was to try to
stop deployment of American cruise mis
siles in Britain beginning in late 1983 as part
of the NATO alliance's modernization of
theater nuclear weapons. Foot said Britain
should press the Reagan administration to
pursue the "zero option" of forgoing all
deployment of the cruise missiles and Per
shing 2 missiles in five NATO countries in
the European theater nuclear force nego
tiations with the Soviet Union scheduled
to begin in Geneva Nov. 30.
' Earlier this week NATO's defense min
isters meeting in Scotland as the Nuclear
Planning Group formally recognized that
option — with U.S. objection — in a decla
ration. Under the option the West would
forgo stationing the 572 new missiles in
Western Europe if the Soviet Union would
dismantle its SS-20 nuclear missiles
targeted on Western Europe. However,
experts believe the option is not very prac
tical because the Soviet Union is highly un
likely to dismantle its SS-20 missiles, and
the United States in any case would proba
bly also demand the Soviets remove other
tactical nuclear weapons as well.
The Pershing and cruise missiles are to
replace some of the thousands of aging
nuclear warheads the United States has
had deployed in Europe for two decades.

shows that we are not prepared to give in
to the dictates of the arms race."

Foot, other speakersand many marchers
attributed Saturday's large turnout and
other signs of considerable growth in nu
clear disarmament sentiment during the
past year here to growing fears that the
United States and the Soviet Union might
fight a limited nuclear war in Europe, spar
ing their own homelands.
They said these fears were heightened
when President Ronald Reagan said a
week ago that he could envision the ex
change of tactical nuclear weapons on a

European battlefield "without it bringing
either one of the major powers to pushing
the button."
"No American president should talk in
such terms," said Foot, a veteran disarma
ment campaigner whose party's policy is to
ban all nuclear weapons and American
bases from Britain if the party regains
power.
"I can't dismiss (Reagan's remarks) as a
gaffe," Foot told reportersat Saturday's ral
ly, "because the Western alliance strategy
is based on a so-called flexible response
(adopted by NATO in 1967) in which in

some circumstances the West could strike
first" with battlefield nuclear weapons.
He and other speakers said the disarma
ment movement's first priority was to try to
stop deployment of American cruise mis
siles in Britain beginning in late 1983 as part
of the NATO alliance's modernization of
theater nuclear weapons. Foot said Britain
should press the Reagan administration to
pursue the "zero option" of forgoing all
deployment of the cruise missiles and Per
shing 2 missiles in five NATO countries in
the European theater nuclear force nego
tiations with the Soviet Union scheduled
to begin in Geneva Nov. 30.
' Earlier this week NATO's defense min
isters meeting in Scotland as the Nuclear
Planning Group formally recognized that
option — with U.S. objection — in a decla
ration. Under the option the West would
forgo stationing the 572 new missiles in
Western Europe if the Soviet Union would
dismantle its SS-20 nuclear missiles
targeted on Western Europe. However,
experts believe the option is not very prac
tical because the Soviet Union is highly un
likely to dismantle its SS-20 missiles, and
the United States in any case would proba
bly also demand the Soviets remove other
tactical nuclear weapons as well.
The Pershing and cruise missiles are to
replace some of the thousands of aging
nuclear warheads the United States has
had deployed in Europe for two decades.

West arms race, as did 50,000 in Paris.
'Tf]p swelling crowd was urged in
speeches, songs and poems to do ev
erything possible to ban American and
British nuclear weapons from this country
and advance disarmament in the West and
East.
"This is one of the greatest days in the
history of this democracy," opposition
Labour Party leader Michael Foot told the
crowd. "The size of this demonstration
shows that we are not prepared to give in
to the dictates of the arms race."
