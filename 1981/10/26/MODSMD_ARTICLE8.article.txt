# Third World gives Reagan attentive ear at Cancun; issues remain for future talks
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Cancun, Mexico — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan returned
to Washington Saturday, hav
ing scored what in many re
spects was a diplomatic victory
at the Cancun economic de
velopment summit.
He came here expecting a
hostile reception from leaders
of developing countries who
considered him insensitive to
their needs and who had
deplored his refusal to increase
U.S. financial assistance to the
Third World.
But, expressions of such
hostility were rare. Instead, by
most accounts, Reagan con
vinced many of the Third
World leaders that, despite his
resistance to their demands for
massive changes in the world
economic system, he was sin
cerely concerned about their
plight.
Reagan and his aides also
achieved most of their key
goals, influencing the manner
in which upcoming "global ne
gotiations," that developing
countries have demanded con
cerning North-South econom
ic relations, will be conducted.
Many nations disappointed
Some of the other leaders at
the summit were clearly disap
pointed that more progress
was not made toward agree
ments to help the poor coun

tries. Leaders from France,
Canada and Brazil, for exam
ple, made tart comments about
the conference's lack of con
crete result.
For the most part, however,
leaders of developing and in
dustrial nations alike were at
least cautiously optimistic
about prospects for gains in the
wide variety of talks that are ex
pected on these issues in com
ing months.
A senior White House of
ficial credited the separate
bilateral sessions that Reagan
held with the leaders of 12 of
the T4 developing countries
present at the summit as a key
factor in helping create an at
mosphere of cooperation rath
er than confrontation.
Several countries expressed
regret at the nonparticipation
of the Soviet Union in the talks.
Discussions to follow
The Soviet Union, and many
other nations not represented
at Cancun, will get a chance to
join in at least some of the dis
cussions expected to proceed
in the summit's aftermath.
Those talks are scheduled to
take place in the United Na
tions — of which Moscow is a
member and where the de
veloping countries have the
dominant voice — and in such
specialized organizations as
the International Monetary

Fund and the World Bank,
where the industrial countries
are dominant.
According to administration
officials, informal conversa
tions will start almost im
mediately with several coun
tries — some that attended the
summit and many that did not.
If informal talks are successful,
there will then be formal talks
at the United Nations designed
to establish the format and
scope of the ultimate global
negotiation.
The United States line, as
Reagan set forth here, holds
that the decisions in the United
Nations should not interfere
with the independence of the
World Bank, the IMF, or other
such agencies.
France, Canada buck U.S.
The developing countries,
with some support from such
industrial nations as France and
Canada, oppose this restric
tion. In their view, one of the
key purposes of the global ne
gotiations would be to change
the rules and procedures of
those agencies to ease the ac
cess of the poorer countries to
their resources.
But Reagan was able to win
support from the British and,
apparently, the West Germans
on this point, and his narrower
definition of global nego

tiations appears increasingly
likely to rule.
Some gains lor the developing
Nevertheless, the develop
ing countries were seen as hav
ing several important op
portunities for gain, even in
this more restrictive format.
Among them:
•While the United Nations
won't be able to enact changes
in the independent agencies, it
will be able to propose them.
•Having insisted that the
Third World countries con
tinue taking their grievances
about the IMF and World Bank
to those agencies, the United
States and other leading mem
bers will face pressure to give
them a more friendly hearing.
•There are other key inde
pendent agencies where the
power of the developing coun
tries has grown. For example,
developing country member
ship in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, has
changed from one-half of the
total to nearly two-thirds.
•Reagan and the leaders of
the other industrial countries
did become more concerned
after hearing the Third World
leaders expound their prob
lems in detail at the summit,
U.S. officials maintained, and
that, they added, could bring
changes in the future.
