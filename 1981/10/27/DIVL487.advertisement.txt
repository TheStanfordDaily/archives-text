You've Set Your Standards
Now Set Ours...
We've been setting standards with our products since 1913,
when we first developed a household version of the bleach
that was to become our namesake. Today, The Clorox
Company is an international manufacturer of consumer
products, with numerous domestic and international facilities
and over 20 products in a variety of groups, many of which are
category leaders.
Our growth was no accident. We have a group of dedicated
scientists and engineers from various disciplines, that have
set high standards for themselves and in turn for our products.
We're looking for more graduates just like them for our
Technical Center in Pleasanton, California.
