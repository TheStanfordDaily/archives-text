# Kennedy speaks to student fundraisers

### Brad Williams 
University President Donald Ken
nedy, saying that "I'm just dying to
make it (the University) better,"
urged students to help in the drive to
raise money while speaking at the an
nual student volunteer orientation
meeting yesterday.
The meeting, whose purpose was
to encourage students to participate
in fundraising activities, included
Kennedy and Board of Trustees vice
president John Packard as speakers.
They emphasized the need for con
tinued financial support for the Uni
versity through fund drives, and the
hope that undergraduates involved
in fundraising will be likely to be
come generous alumni.
"The tuition is too high," said Ken
nedy, responding to a question from
the audience. But he added that no
relief is in sight. "We are subject to
the same costs as everyone else, and
for every dollar we raise tuition to
cover our increased costs we have to
put between 40 and 45 cents back
into financial aid to help students
deal with the cost,"he explained.
Kennedy refused to say exactly
what portion of an undergraduate's
costs are covered by tuition, saying

that it is impossible to differentiate
between undergraduate and gradu
ate expenses in the budget. A
brochure given out at the meeting,
however, put the figure at 49 per
cent.
According to Packard, Stanford
faces many financial difficulties dur
ing the next 15 or 20 years. Although
donations to the University more
than doubled during the '70s, those
funds actually lost ground when in
flation was taken into account. In ad
dition, electronics firms in silicon val
ley, major sources of funding in past
years, may no longer be supporting
the University to the degree they
have in the past, said Packard.
As one way of making up this defi
cit, students are being enlisted to
work in two programs. One of these,
the Heritage Fund, supports scholar
ships for freshmen and sophomores
with funds donated by individuals,
foundations and corporations. Stu
dent volunteers receive special train
ing from the University's top fund
raisers, then are paired with potential
donors taken from a list of 150. One
