## Old collections find new home 
### Jane McConnell 
There's only one place on campus
where you can find both the entire
filmscript to Saturday Night Fever un
der its original title "Tribal Rites of Sat
urday Night," and the earliest existing
Statute of the City of Marseille, dating
back to 1295. The place is the Louise R.
Lurie Rotunda in Cecil Green Library,
the new home of the Department of
Special Collections exhibits.
What used to be Green library's read
ing and reference room in the west
wing of the library is now the Charles
and Frances Field Room, the Depart
ment of Special Collections.
The Field Room contains a collection
of rare books, manuscripts, maps, and
photos noteworthy for their age, scarci
ty, and expense. Included in tne collec
tion are 70,000 rare books, five million
manuscripts and 1500 maps, according
to Director of Libraries David Weber.
"In terms of amount of material, we
probably rank in the top ten special col
lections libraries in the country," said
Readers' Services Librarian J. Richard
Philips.
Some of the books and manuscripts
are in air-conditioned cases on the
shelves, but most are in a separate stack
area, with temperature and humidity
controls.
The special collections hold a three
volume set of photographs taken in the
Pacific Coast, Oregon, and Vosemite
around 1870, recently priced at about
$300,000.
The collection also contains the first
edition of Euclid, complete with
marginal geometric illustrations; the
thirteenth century manuscript of Ovid's
Metamorphoses, one of two such

copies owned by an American univer
sity; and musical scores of Bach, Chopin
and Wagner handwritten by the com
posers.
In the theater collection are film and
television script, as well as old movie
posters and stills, theater programs, and
a variety of piano and vocal scores to
stage musicals.
The Brasch Newton Collection, one
of the two best collections of Newton in
the country, contains nearly all of New
ton's own works. The Gunst Collection
of fine printing, containing books on
book arts such as binding, illustrations
and printing, is the best such collection
in the area.
In the general rare books collection
there is a unique concentration on daily
life in eighteenth century England, with
pamphlets on topics ranging from self
improvement to catching rats.
The Felton collection of nineteenth
and twentieth century British and
American authors is very strong in D. H.
Lawrence, James Joyce, and Steinbeck.
Many of the books are first editions and
collector's copies.
In addition to the Special Collections
Rooms is the adjoining Rotunda exhibit
at the top of the grand staircase.
Housed in the exhibit are letters from
Abraham Lincoln to General Frederick
Steele, a showcase devoted to the
Chicano experience in California, and
an assortment of beautifully illustated,
first edition childrens' books.
The expanded area also includes a
spacious reading room and a seminar
room in which classes using depart
ment materials are held.

Benefits of the new location and ex
pansion include a quieter, less distract
ing space to consult the materials, bet
ter exhibition space and better con
servation of the materials, according to
Phillips.
The facilities are available to anyone
with legitimate research needs, which
includes Stanford students and faculty,
the community, and scholars from oth
er institutions. Recently, the Somerset
Maugham collection, which is the larg
est single body of Maugham correspon
dence in existence, was used extensive
ly for a biography written on Maugham.
The renovation and expanion was
made possible by gifts from Stanford
graduate and book collector Charles
Field, and his wife Frances; the Lurie
Foundation honors the late Louise R.
Lurie.
Approximately 450 people attended
the opening ceremony on October 9,
which Phillips called a "glittering event,
one of the more elaborate receptions
that has occurred in my years here."
Among the speakers present at the
ceremony was Richard Lyman, presi
dent of the Rockefeller Foundation and
former president of Stanford. He said,
"To attain the position from which one
can have some appreciate of human
kind's intellectual and spiritual achieve
ments, one must become conscious
through firsthand experience of what
books and manuscripts and maps have
meant to those achievements. That par
ticular brand of 'hands-on experience,'
whether it is literally hands-on or a mat
ter of peering through a protective glass
case, is only really obtainable from a
rare books room."
