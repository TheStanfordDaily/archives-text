# Depression is not uncommon and should be confronted
## 
### Brooke Isham 
Artist, authors, actresses, sci
entists and statesmen are all
prone. Nebuchadnezzar, Van
Gogh, Gaugin, Poe, Kafka,
Darwin, Churchill, Aldrin were
all known to have experienced
its symptoms. Depression is
present in all societies and is a
universal part of human ex
istence, said Dr. Philip Berger
of the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavorial Sci
ences in a speech last Thursday.
Dr. Berger, director of the
Stanford Mental Health
Clinical Research Center and
of the Schizophrenia Biology
Research Center, addressed
the topic of depression, focus
ing on its various forms, symp
toms, and historical context.
He also discussed various cur
rent medical research in the
field.
Dr. Thomas Gonda, chair
man of the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavorial Sci
ences, introduced the program,
"Sadness itself constitutes a
very human emotion that all of
us experience," he said, ex
plaining that depression is a se
rious extention of sadness.
Berger stated that sadness is
"a normal mode of grief." He
distinguished everyday de
pression or sadness from
clinical depression, in that the
latter is a serious mental dis
order with varied symptoms.
These symptoms — pessimism
concerning one's future, low
self-esteem, a loss of pleasure,
a feeling of unworthiness
about one's accomplishments,

a lowering of job performance
ability, a change in appetite or
sleep patterns, and thoughts of
death or suicide — are charac
teristics of the depressive syn
drome, according to Dr.
Berger.
Only 1.5 million patients are
presently being treated for
clinical depression. There are
four to six million patients ex
periencing "the psychic pain of
depression, who are not being
treated," Dr. Berger explained.
"I think all of you know from
personal experience, from
family members, that depres
sion is extremely common," he
said.

Only 7.5 million patients are presently
being treated for clinical depression.
There are four to six million patients
experiencing the 'psychic pain of
depression'who are not being
treated.

Berger further emphasized
the stress that may lead a vul
nerable person into depression
— a break-up of a close-rela
tionship, loss of social esteem,
change in employment, loss of
mobility or a change in bodily
outlook.
A person's vulnerability to
depression is caused by a ge
netic predisposition and en
vironmental factors, Berger
said.
The lecture was sponsored
by the Friends of Psychiatry and
Behavorial Sciences, who seek

to provide educational pro
grams and financially assist the
Department of Psychiatry and
Behavorial Sciences at Stan
ford.
Carol Weicz, the group's ad
ministrative director and only
full-time paid employee, ex
plained its purpose: "We are
trying to build a constituency
of people who will support
mental health."
To achieve this goal, Weicz
hopes that the lectures spon
sored by the organization will
provide "enlightenment,
educational information, and
maybe a desire to support
mental health research."

Weicz added that the lec
tures are designed "to change
some of the myths and images"
concerning mental health.
After only four years in ex
istence, Friends of Psychiatry
and Behavorial Sciences boasts
4000 new members. One-third
of the membership consists of
health-care professionals while
the other two-thirds are com
posed of patients or people
with an interest in mental
health, according to Weicz.
Membership is free and open

Artist, authors, actresses, sci
entists and statesmen are all
prone. Nebuchadnezzar, Van
Gogh, Gaugin, Poe, Kafka,
Darwin, Churchill, Aldrin were
all known to have experienced
its symptoms. Depression is
present in all societies and is a
universal part of human ex
istence, said Dr. Philip Berger
of the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavorial Sci
ences in a speech last Thursday.
Dr. Berger, director of the
Stanford Mental Health
Clinical Research Center and
of the Schizophrenia Biology
Research Center, addressed
the topic of depression, focus
ing on its various forms, symp
toms, and historical context.
He also discussed various cur
rent medical research in the
field.
Dr. Thomas Gonda, chair
man of the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavorial Sci
ences, introduced the program,
"Sadness itself constitutes a
very human emotion that all of
us experience," he said, ex
plaining that depression is a se
rious extention of sadness.
Berger stated that sadness is
"a normal mode of grief." He
distinguished everyday de
pression or sadness from
clinical depression, in that the
latter is a serious mental dis
order with varied symptoms.
These symptoms — pessimism
concerning one's future, low
self-esteem, a loss of pleasure,
a feeling of unworthiness
about one's accomplishments,

a lowering of job performance
ability, a change in appetite or
sleep patterns, and thoughts of
death or suicide — are charac
teristics of the depressive syn
drome, according to Dr.
Berger.
Only 1.5 million patients are
presently being treated for
clinical depression. There are
four to six million patients ex
periencing "the psychic pain of
depression, who are not being
treated," Dr. Berger explained.
"I think all of you know from
personal experience, from
family members, that depres
sion is extremely common," he
said.

Only 7.5 million patients are presently
being treated for clinical depression.
There are four to six million patients
experiencing the 'psychic pain of
depression'who are not being
treated.

Berger further emphasized
the stress that may lead a vul
nerable person into depression
— a break-up of a close-rela
tionship, loss of social esteem,
change in employment, loss of
mobility or a change in bodily
outlook.
