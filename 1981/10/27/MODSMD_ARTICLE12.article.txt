"VIISA is taking seriously what President
Ronald Reagan suggested â€” that the private sec
tor replace the government in social service pro
grams, particularly by using the skills of volun
teers," said Rev. Laurel Gray, regional director of
Volunteers in International Service and Aware
ness (VIISA).
VIISA, which has a local group on the Stanford
campus, is a non-profit organization that relies'
on private grants and proposals. It hopes to re
cruit volunteers to be a local support group
and/or participants in the projects in Central
America.
"We who are the middle-class Americans are
not tuned in to the depths of the poverty and
hunger of the Third World. We study about it
and read about it, but until we've actually ex
perienced it by really being there ourselves, we
won't totally comprehend what it is. That's the
awareness part of VIISA, to learn the taste and
smell of poverty," said Cray.
The program is designed to use the skills and
experiences of volunteers to "supplement the
situations" of people in Third World countries.

According to Gray, "VIISA does not require
Eeople to have a lot of skills. They only need to
e willing to be trained and concerned about
the needs of the Third World."
The main areas in which these skills are used
are health care, early child development, animal
husbandry, agriculture, community develop
ment and nutrition. VIISA's field projects in
volve only six week commitments from its volun
teers. The next project is scheduled for Novem
ber 29, 1981 to January 6, 1982. Other sessions
begin in December, June and July.
Gray will be coming to Stanford to present
slides and answer questions about Honduras
and the VIISA program. He isscheduled tospeak
during Third World Week on Tuesday, October
27 at 6:45 p.m. in Roble Hall and on Wednesday,
October 28 at 6:30 p.m. in Meyer Library room
146.
"Honduras was selected because it is the safest
.. . and probably the poorest country in Central
America," said Gray. In addition to Honduras,
VIISA also has contacts in the Philippines and
Taiwan. However, there are no current projects
underway in those countries.
