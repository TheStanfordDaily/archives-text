## Peter Spivack NCPACs legislate morality 
### 
If in a nation so diverse and heter
ogeneous as the United States there
can be an all-pervasive ethic, it is the
notion of fair play. The great cultural
melting pot bubbles and sputters,
wafting this ail-American odor
through out national psyche. We
play by the rules, or at least pretend
to, and expect our fellow members of
the world community to conform to
the dictates of the nation's cons
cience. What other country has a na
tional obsession with human rights?
Albeit, our moralistic outlook tends
to be a bit limiting when faced with
cold stark reality. And yet, this very
same outlook is an integral part of
our governmental institution and so
cietal fabric. In short, Americans dis
like "dirty pool."
U.S. election campaign laws are
specifically designed to keep the
game fair — to prevent the domi
nation of a candidate by any one per
son or group. Our elected officials
are sworn to uphold the Constitution
as the supreme Law of the Land, not
be the mouthpieces of corporate en
tities. Campaign contributions are
strictly regulated to protect against
the buying off of the people's repre
sentatives. Direct contributions and
campaign records are scrutinized
with a microscopic attention to de
tail. These laws have kept elections as
fair as any free elections can be for
decades.
Wherever there is a law, the old
saying goes, there is a loophole. The
election laws make no mention of in
direct contributions — contributions
that are not made to the candidate's
campaign fund but still help his
cause. This loophole went unnoticed
for years until groups such as the
Moral Majority and the National
Conservative Political Action Com
mittee (NCPAC) began to utilize it to
further their revisionist causes.
The NCPAC has two basic modes
of action. First, it solicits contribu
tions from registered Republicans for

a general campaign fund. Second, it
targets specific congressional races
and pumps money into a campaign
against the established incumbent,
usually a liberal democrat. In 1982,
for example, the group will attempt
to raise $100,000 to defeat Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan (D-New York), be
cause as Jerry Dolan, a NCPAC direc
tor, stated, Moynihan is "one of the
most liberal members of the Senate,
despite the fact that he hides behind
conservative rhetoric." NCPAC has
targeted our own Rep. Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) for defeat as well.

The NCPAC is helped in its efforts
by groups such as the Moral Majority
and anti-abortion pressure groups.
But while the NCPAC stresses a re
visionist conservatism, the Moral Ma
jority focusses on issues of personal
morality of the candidates. Now any
cynic will tell you that personal mo
rality has absolutely nothing to do
with politics. The Moral Majority has
managed to make personal beliefs on
issue, whipping elections up into
emotional frenzies of name-calling
and hurling epithets such as
"babykiller" at pro-abortion politi
cians. Their strategy is quite remi
niscent of the mudslinging cam
paigns of the early 1900s.
Once upon a time, the radical
right-wing groups were political
aberrations, mere Southern
backwoods, Bible-thumping
preachers. Now, however, they are

with in the political arena. They have
demonstrated an uncanny ability to

crystallize issues on their own terms,
diverting attention from the actual
political issues. The NCPAC has been
greeted with astonishing success. In
the last senatorial election, six of the
seven targeted incumbents, includ
ing such luminaries as Birch Bayh and
George McGovern, went down in ig
nominious defeat.
There is nothing wrong with the
beliefs of these organizations. It's a
free country. What is dangerous,
however, is their desire to impose
their moral structure on the rest of
the country. They seek to set into law

a constitutional amendment banning
abortion, no less the values they hold
dear, forcing the rest of the popu
lation to accept them. These motiva
tions constitute a clear and present
danger to individual liberties. This
legislation of morality cannot be to
lerated.
The only effective way to limit the
influence of these groups or any
groups seeking to control elections is
to change the election laws to in
clude indirect campaign contribu
tions. For in a two-party political sys
tem, a campaign against one can
didate is the same as a campaign for
the opposing candidate. I base my ul
timate argument on part of the very
Declaration of Independence that
established this nation: "... a gov
ernment of the people, for the peo
ple, and by the people."

a general campaign fund. Second, it
targets specific congressional races
and pumps money into a campaign
against the established incumbent,
usually a liberal democrat. In 1982,
for example, the group will attempt
to raise $100,000 to defeat Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan (D-New York), be
cause as Jerry Dolan, a NCPAC direc
tor, stated, Moynihan is "one of the
most liberal members of the Senate,
despite the fact that he hides behind
conservative rhetoric." NCPAC has
targeted our own Rep. Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) for defeat as well.

The NCPAC is helped in its efforts
by groups such as the Moral Majority
and anti-abortion pressure groups.
But while the NCPAC stresses a re
visionist conservatism, the Moral Ma
jority focusses on issues of personal
morality of the candidates. Now any
cynic will tell you that personal mo
rality has absolutely nothing to do
with politics. The Moral Majority has
managed to make personal beliefs on
issue, whipping elections up into
emotional frenzies of name-calling
and hurling epithets such as
"babykiller" at pro-abortion politi

niscent of the mudslinging cam

crystallize issues on their own terms,
diverting attention from the actual
political issues. The NCPAC has been
greeted with astonishing success. In
the last senatorial election, six of the
seven targeted incumbents, includ
ing such luminaries as Birch Bayh and
George McGovern, went down in ig
nominious defeat.
There is nothing wrong with the
beliefs of these organizations. It's a
free country. What is dangerous,
however, is their desire to impose
their moral structure on the rest of
the country. They seek to set into law

a constitutional amendment banning
abortion, no less the values they hold
dear, forcing the rest of the popu
lation to accept them. These motiva
tions constitute a clear and present
danger to individual liberties. This
legislation of morality cannot be to
lerated.
The only effective way to limit the
influence of these groups or any
groups seeking to control elections is
to change the election laws to in
clude indirect campaign contribu
tions. For in a two-party political sys
tem, a campaign against one can
didate is the same as a campaign for
the opposing candidate. I base my ul
timate argument on part of the very
Declaration of Independence that
established this nation: "... a gov
ernment of the people, for the peo
ple, and by the people."

If in a nation so diverse and heter
ogeneous as the United States there
can be an all-pervasive ethic, it is the
notion of fair play. The great cultural
melting pot bubbles and sputters,
wafting this ail-American odor
through out national psyche. We
play by the rules, or at least pretend
to, and expect our fellow members of
the world community to conform to
the dictates of the nation's cons
cience. What other country has a na
tional obsession with human rights?
Albeit, our moralistic outlook tends
to be a bit limiting when faced with
cold stark reality. And yet, this very
same outlook is an integral part of
our governmental institution and so
cietal fabric. In short, Americans dis
like "dirty pool."
U.S. election campaign laws are
specifically designed to keep the
game fair — to prevent the domi
nation of a candidate by any one per
son or group. Our elected officials
are sworn to uphold the Constitution
as the supreme Law of the Land, not
be the mouthpieces of corporate en
tities. Campaign contributions are
strictly regulated to protect against
the buying off of the people's repre
sentatives. Direct contributions and
campaign records are scrutinized
with a microscopic attention to de
tail. These laws have kept elections as
fair as any free elections can be for
decades.
Wherever there is a law, the old
saying goes, there is a loophole. The
election laws make no mention of in
direct contributions — contributions
that are not made to the candidate's
campaign fund but still help his
cause. This loophole went unnoticed
for years until groups such as the
Moral Majority and the National
Conservative Political Action Com
mittee (NCPAC) began to utilize it to
further their revisionist causes.
