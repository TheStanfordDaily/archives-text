## Conscience worthy of name would avoid war's misery 
### 
In his recent column Daily colum
nist Jerry Wertheim writes of just
wars and of noble wars (Daily, Oct.
19). Apparently, he would have usbe
lieve that war, the killing of humans
in quantity, is a noble activist when
we kill these other humans for a just
cause.
He says that, "The general
framework for determining if a war is
justified is a simple one in most
cases," yet he does not care to en
lighten us with his definition of a just
war. Nevertheless, he does provide
us with some examples from which
we can guess as to what constitutes a
just and noble cause for the murder
of a fellow man.
Obviously, according to this arti
cle, a war to protect our supply of
crude oil merits participation, for
"American livelihoods, depend on
. . . crude." Therefore, one can de
duce that war qualifies as just when
one group of people, (e.g. the

Saudis), threaten the way of life of an
other group of people, specifically in
this example, the Americans. So, if
the Saudis, in conjunction with the
other Arab peoples, decide to
withhold oil from the United States,
we Americans have the right; in
deed, we are pursuing "noble" ends
in massacring every Arabian in ex
istence. But what if the Arab people
decide that Americans — who com
prise six percent of the earth's popu
lation, who produce 18 percent of
the world's oil, and who consume 30
percent of the world's oil — in their
gluttonous waste of oil, are depriving
other people in this world of their
livelihood? Are not the Arab peoples
justified in not only withholding oil
from America, but also declaring war
on America and attempting to
massacre every American in ex
istence?
The article provides us with anoth
er example from which we can de

termine what justifies the slaughter
ing of other people. If a country with
a fantastically crazy leader goes on a
wild spree of genocide killing a sub
stantial percentage of his subjects,
the article tells us that we Americans
have the right and the responsibility
to march into that country and
eliminate that leader and all of his fol
lowers. Yes, I took back proudly on
our long tradition of crusading free
dom fighters, like when we marched
on Stalin's Russia and liberated mil
lions of starving people during his
Reign of Terror. Yes, tears of joy
came to my eyes when I first saw pic
tures of our flag-waving boys freeing
the oppressed Cambodians before
Pol Pot systematically destroyed
somewhere between 30 percent and
50 percent of the population just four
years ago. Continuing in this glorious
tradition, I am sure that, even now as
I write this article, presidential ad
visor Edwin Meese is deliberating
about waking President Ronald Rea
gan in order to have him organize an
impressive collection of neutron
bombs, nerve gas, and other
diabolical weapons of destruction in
order to free the opressed minorities
in South Africa, Chile, El Salvador, et
al.
Obviously, I cannot condone gen
ocide, but I question whether na
tions fight to protect people from
these horrors. For example, in World
War 11, we fought a great moral war
against Germany in order to free the
Jews, why did we wait until after
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor to de
clare war on Germany, when the Na
zis began oppressing the Jews almost
a decade earlier?
After his two examples, Wertheim
does give us a hint as to what could
justify an act of war, like dropping
fire bombs on an open city, as tne Al
lies did at Dresden in World War.ll.
Apparently, the decision to wage war
lies with the individual and his cons
cience. But, any conscience worthy
of its name, any conscience that un
derstands the suffering, misery, and
death implicit in war, can only
choose not to participate in war in
any form.
For a just war is a contradiction in
terms and reeksof thefilthy stench of
hypocrisy. Just means equitable, le
gitimate, and in this instance implies
that after the war, people will live in a
happier and better world. But can a
person truly live a happier life know
ing that he participated in the
slaughter of his fellow man? War
means dropping nuclear bombs that
instantly kill millions of people with
third degree burns, and that slowly
kill millions of people by diarrhea
and vomiting. War means spraying
people with nerve gas that instantly
paralyzes them. War means killing in
nocent men, women, and children
with the flaming gasoline jelly of
napalm. War means death, and I re
fuse to participate.

Apparently, the decision to wage war
lies with the individual and his cons
cience. But, any conscience worthy
of its name, any conscience that un
derstands the suffering, misery, and
death implicit in war, can only
choose not to participate in war in
any form.
For a just war is a contradiction in
terms and reeksof thefilthy stench of
hypocrisy. Just means equitable, le
gitimate, and in this instance implies
that after the war, people will live in a
happier and better world. But can a
person truly live a happier life know
ing that he participated in the
slaughter of his fellow man? War
means dropping nuclear bombs that
instantly kill millions of people with
third degree burns, and that slowly
kill millions of people by diarrhea
and vomiting. War means spraying
people with nerve gas that instantly
paralyzes them. War means killing in
nocent men, women, and children
with the flaming gasoline jelly of
napalm. War means death, and I re
fuse to participate.

In his recent column Daily colum
nist Jerry Wertheim writes of just
wars and of noble wars (Daily, Oct.
19). Apparently, he would have usbe
lieve that war, the killing of humans
in quantity, is a noble activist when
we kill these other humans for a just
cause.
He says that, "The general
framework for determining if a war is
justified is a simple one in most
cases," yet he does not care to en
lighten us with his definition of a just
war. Nevertheless, he does provide
us with some examples from which
we can guess as to what constitutes a
just and noble cause for the murder
of a fellow man.
Obviously, according to this arti
cle, a war to protect our supply of
crude oil merits participation, for
"American livelihoods, depend on
. . . crude." Therefore, one can de
duce that war qualifies as just when
one group of people, (e.g. the

Saudis), threaten the way of life of an
other group of people, specifically in
this example, the Americans. So, if
the Saudis, in conjunction with the
other Arab peoples, decide to
withhold oil from the United States,
we Americans have the right; in
deed, we are pursuing "noble" ends
in massacring every Arabian in ex
istence. But what if the Arab people
decide that Americans — who com
prise six percent of the earth's popu
lation, who produce 18 percent of
the world's oil, and who consume 30
percent of the world's oil — in their
gluttonous waste of oil, are depriving
other people in this world of their
livelihood? Are not the Arab peoples
justified in not only withholding oil
from America, but also declaring war
on America and attempting to
massacre every American in ex
istence?
The article provides us with anoth
er example from which we can de

termine what justifies the slaughter
ing of other people. If a country with
a fantastically crazy leader goes on a
wild spree of genocide killing a sub
stantial percentage of his subjects,
the article tells us that we Americans
have the right and the responsibility
to march into that country and
eliminate that leader and all of his fol
lowers. Yes, I took back proudly on
our long tradition of crusading free
dom fighters, like when we marched
on Stalin's Russia and liberated mil
lions of starving people during his
Reign of Terror. Yes, tears of joy
came to my eyes when I first saw pic
tures of our flag-waving boys freeing
the oppressed Cambodians before
Pol Pot systematically destroyed
somewhere between 30 percent and
50 percent of the population just four
years ago. Continuing in this glorious
tradition, I am sure that, even now as
I write this article, presidential ad
visor Edwin Meese is deliberating
about waking President Ronald Rea
gan in order to have him organize an
impressive collection of neutron
bombs, nerve gas, and other
diabolical weapons of destruction in
order to free the opressed minorities
in South Africa, Chile, El Salvador, et
al.
Obviously, I cannot condone gen
ocide, but I question whether na
tions fight to protect people from
these horrors. For example, in World
War 11, we fought a great moral war
against Germany in order to free the
Jews, why did we wait until after
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor to de
clare war on Germany, when the Na
zis began oppressing the Jews almost
a decade earlier?
After his two examples, Wertheim
does give us a hint as to what could
justify an act of war, like dropping
fire bombs on an open city, as tne Al
lies did at Dresden in World War.ll.
