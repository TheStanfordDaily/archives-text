## Backing of Marcos dangerous 
### 
The first reports said that President Ferdinand Marcos
of the Philippines had been invited by the Reagan ad
ministration to come to the U.S. Then there was a retrac
tion, and for a while no one knew whether or not Marcos
was coming to America on a state visit. When he finally
did come, the visit was kept low-key. Marcos passed
through some cities in the United States to the North-
South summit in Cancun, Mexico. He plans to spend sev
eral days in the U.S. on his way back from thesummitthis
week.
The Reagan administration's vacillation and reluc
tance to disclosing the exact status of Marcos' visit is un
derstandable. Anti-Marcos groups in the U.S. were de
termined to turn the visit into an embarrassment for the
administration. The Philippine Solidarity Network (PSN),
one such U.S.-based group plans a national day of pro
test to condemn hosting of such a well-known tyrant.
Marcos, who was to have stepped down from office in
1973, instead made himself dictator, disbanded Con
gress, closed newspapers, arrested thousands of oppo
nents and suspended all civil rights. To preserve the im
age of martial law as a temporary "crisis mechanism"
Marcos finally lifted it in January, while leaving intact all
his emergency powers.
The 1973 Constitution's sixth amendment remains in
force, guaranteeing that all presidential decrees, general
orders, and letters of instructions issued during martial
law still exist. Thus:
•The right to protest, organize, and demonstrate
peacefully is still restricted.
•Strikes in "vital industries" are still prohibited.
•Freedom of the press is curtailed.
People disappear, but not in numbers which might
provoke international outrage. A vaguely worded gen
eral order provides for preventive detention of anyone
suspected of threatening national security. Threatening
acts range from possession of "subversive materials" to
"rumor-mongering."
Faced with such facts, it seems ironic that Vice-Presi
dent George Bush, in a statement in Manila after Marcos'
well-publicized "free" elections in June 1981 said, "We
love your adherence to democratic principles, and to the
democratic processes. And we will not leave you in isola

tion to the degree that we have any vibrant strength."
The United States and the Philippines at present have a
symbiotic relationship. Marcos, whose country hosts the
two largest American military bases outside the United
States — bases whose military capacity reaches as far as
Southeast Asia and the Near East — ranks very high in the
list of U.S. priorities. It is no secret that these military
bases play a major role in Washington's global military
strategy. A right-wing think tank has described Subic
Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines as
probably the most important basing complexes in the
world if considered in terms of U.S. policy of naval
projection.
Obviously, Reagan knows that his ability to secure the
region and preserve a component of U.S. global fire
power depends a great deal on Marcos being in power.
Assured of U.S. support, Marcos has a fresh justification
of his mandate.
Marcos calls his dictatorship a "revolution from the
top" to save his people the trauma of a revolution from
below. To give his administration the appearance of de
mocracy, token opposition is "franchised."
Nationalist and democratic opposition in this land of
48 million people continues to grow as economic condi
tions worsen. Resentment isstrong. Students calling fora
return to democracy are not alone. Last September,
22,000 marched to support the united opposition's Na
tional Covenant for Freedom and Democracy. In
Bacolod, 12,000 marched for human rights.
Imposed without any justification and maintained
beyond necessity, the present administration under
Marcos enjoys little popular support. In continuing to
support such a regime with both economic and in
creased military aid, the U.S. is ignoring some of its prin
ciples.
Perhaps one reason history repeats itself is because
people refuse to learn from it. The United States has sup
ported repressive regimes in the past. The current trend
in the Philippines is not very different from thatevident
in Nicaragua or Iran, and the handwriting on the wall is
the same.

Obviously, Reagan knows that his ability to secure the
region and preserve a component of U.S. global fire
power depends a great deal on Marcos being in power.
Assured of U.S. support, Marcos has a fresh justification
of his mandate.
Marcos calls his dictatorship a "revolution from the
top" to save his people the trauma of a revolution from
below. To give his administration the appearance of de
mocracy, token opposition is "franchised."
Nationalist and democratic opposition in this land of
48 million people continues to grow as economic condi
tions worsen. Resentment isstrong. Students calling fora
return to democracy are not alone. Last September,
22,000 marched to support the united opposition's Na
tional Covenant for Freedom and Democracy. In
Bacolod, 12,000 marched for human rights.
Imposed without any justification and maintained
beyond necessity, the present administration under
Marcos enjoys little popular support. In continuing to
support such a regime with both economic and in
creased military aid, the U.S. is ignoring some of its prin
ciples.
Perhaps one reason history repeats itself is because
people refuse to learn from it. The United States has sup
ported repressive regimes in the past. The current trend
in the Philippines is not very different from thatevident
in Nicaragua or Iran, and the handwriting on the wall is
the same.

The first reports said that President Ferdinand Marcos
of the Philippines had been invited by the Reagan ad
ministration to come to the U.S. Then there was a retrac
tion, and for a while no one knew whether or not Marcos
was coming to America on a state visit. When he finally
did come, the visit was kept low-key. Marcos passed
through some cities in the United States to the North-
South summit in Cancun, Mexico. He plans to spend sev
eral days in the U.S. on his way back from thesummitthis
week.
The Reagan administration's vacillation and reluc
tance to disclosing the exact status of Marcos' visit is un
derstandable. Anti-Marcos groups in the U.S. were de
termined to turn the visit into an embarrassment for the
administration. The Philippine Solidarity Network (PSN),
one such U.S.-based group plans a national day of pro
test to condemn hosting of such a well-known tyrant.
Marcos, who was to have stepped down from office in
1973, instead made himself dictator, disbanded Con
gress, closed newspapers, arrested thousands of oppo
nents and suspended all civil rights. To preserve the im
age of martial law as a temporary "crisis mechanism"
Marcos finally lifted it in January, while leaving intact all
his emergency powers.
The 1973 Constitution's sixth amendment remains in
force, guaranteeing that all presidential decrees, general
orders, and letters of instructions issued during martial
law still exist. Thus:
•The right to protest, organize, and demonstrate
peacefully is still restricted.
•Strikes in "vital industries" are still prohibited.
•Freedom of the press is curtailed.
People disappear, but not in numbers which might
provoke international outrage. A vaguely worded gen
eral order provides for preventive detention of anyone
suspected of threatening national security. Threatening
acts range from possession of "subversive materials" to
"rumor-mongering."
Faced with such facts, it seems ironic that Vice-Presi
dent George Bush, in a statement in Manila after Marcos'
well-publicized "free" elections in June 1981 said, "We
love your adherence to democratic principles, and to the
democratic processes. And we will not leave you in isola

tion to the degree that we have any vibrant strength."
The United States and the Philippines at present have a
symbiotic relationship. Marcos, whose country hosts the
two largest American military bases outside the United
States — bases whose military capacity reaches as far as
Southeast Asia and the Near East — ranks very high in the
list of U.S. priorities. It is no secret that these military
bases play a major role in Washington's global military
strategy. A right-wing think tank has described Subic
Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines as
probably the most important basing complexes in the
world if considered in terms of U.S. policy of naval
projection.
Obviously, Reagan knows that his ability to secure the
region and preserve a component of U.S. global fire
power depends a great deal on Marcos being in power.
