# Assessment endorsements rebutted
## 
### 
The Daily is providing rebuttal
space here for those organizations
which the editorial board did not en
dorse for this week's fee assessment
election. Elections are to be held
tomorrow and Thursday.
Band
The Daily was wrong when it
claimed that there was a "lack of will
ingness" on the part of the Band to
put on good shows. Lack of willingn
ness has never been a problem with
the Band. We also question the
judgement that "the shows simply
haven't been good" this year. There
are many ways one could improve
the quality of the Band's per
formances, but withholding a large
part of its operating budget is not one
of them.
Finally, independent funding al
lows our band a freedom of ex
pression other bands do not enjoy.
Endorsing the Band would be a
clear message to the Daily to mind its
own business.
John Howard
Assistant Band Manager
Boathouse
The ASSU agrees wholeheartedly
with the Daily's contention that the
University "should be picking up the
costs of keeping the lake safe and fun
for all." Just as the University pro
vides for lifeguards and the opera
tion of the DeGuerre Pool, so it
should at Lake Lagunita. Along these
very lines the ASSU is negotiating for
such funding from the University.
Unfortunately, these funds have not
been allocated in this year's budget.
Consequently, a fee assessment isthe
only means to insure theoperation of
the lake and its facilities for this year.
Without the fee assessment, the Uni
versity may very well not fill the lake
this spring. For this reason we urge
the suport of the Boathouse fee
assessment.

As an ASSU Senator, I write to
apologize that our solution to the
"lack of Concerts issue" has been

found to be so potentially popular by
the Daily — moreover, I now see why
you recommend against a project
that students would like so much that
it would enhance the ASSU's image.
We stand by the Daily's premise that
no new projects should ever be
started, because they can never have
a past record of success.
Regrettably, our role as the Stu
dent Association differs from that of
the Daily in that we must recommend
those projects that students want and
need, regardless of the popularity it
may bring to any given group. We
therefore recommend that students
vote yes for the Campus Entertain
ment Board, despite the admirable
asceticism of the Daily editorial
board.
In conclusion, I only hope that stu
dents can forgive us for attempting to
provide a popular service to the stu
dent body.

STAN
The Daily pointed out that STAN
(Student-Alumni Network) provides
an important student service. How
ever, the Daily claims that STAN
should not be funded by students. By
allowing another group to fund
STAN, we would no longer exist asan
independent student group. We
therefore run the risk of having our
programs restricted by a non-student
organization.
This year we plan to offer class ac
tivities and career-oriented pro
grams with alumni as resources, as
well as programs providing graduate
undergraduate interaction. We need
your support. Please vote for the Stu
dent-Alumni Network (STAN)I

ASSU Senator
CEB
As an ASSU Senator, I write to
apologize that our solution to the
"lack of Concerts issue" has been

found to be so potentially popular by
the Daily — moreover, I now see why
you recommend against a project
that students would like so much that
it would enhance the ASSU's image.
We stand by the Daily's premise that
no new projects should ever be
started, because they can never have
a past record of success.
Regrettably, our role as the Stu
dent Association differs from that of
the Daily in that we must recommend
those projects that students want and
need, regardless of the popularity it
may bring to any given group. We
therefore recommend that students
vote yes for the Campus Entertain
ment Board, despite the admirable
asceticism of the Daily editorial
board.
In conclusion, I only hope that stu
dents can forgive us for attempting to
provide a popular service to the stu
dent body.

STAN
The Daily pointed out that STAN
(Student-Alumni Network) provides
an important student service. How
ever, the Daily claims that STAN
should not be funded by students. By
allowing another group to fund
STAN, we would no longer exist asan
independent student group. We
therefore run the risk of having our
programs restricted by a non-student
organization.
This year we plan to offer class ac
tivities and career-oriented pro
grams with alumni as resources, as
well as programs providing graduate
undergraduate interaction. We need
your support. Please vote for the Stu
dent-Alumni Network (STAN)I
