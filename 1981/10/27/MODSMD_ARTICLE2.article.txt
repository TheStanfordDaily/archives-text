# Post's Greenfield says media too smug
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
Meg Greenfield, Newsweek columnist and
Washington Post editorial page editor, criticized
herself, her paper and the news media last night
for their shortcomings in informing the public.
The 1978 Pulitzer Prize winner told the Terman
Auditorium crowd of about 200 that the press has
the job of enlarging the horizons of its readers, a
responsibility she said "newspapers have not fig
ured out how to do" clearly without sounding
"condescending."
In an informal style similar to that in her News
week columns, Greenfield described the difficulty
reporters face in explaining complex issues, such
as new weapons systems or the social impact of
budget cuts. "By the time I learn enough about a
subject to become an expert," she said,"l lose the
ability to explain it to the reader."
The Post editor talked about her own failings as
she described the latest controversy at that news
paper. The issue concerned a gossip column item
in the Post which quoted a source as saying that in
his last days as president, Jimmy Carter bugged
Blair House, where the Reagans were staying
before Inauguration Day.
Carter vehemently denied the allegation and
threatened to sue the Post. Greenfield, in re
sponse, wrote what she described as "the single

most unsuccessful editorial ever printed." In that
editorial Greenfield defended the Post's editors,
who, she told the audience, believed their source
when the article was published. The editorial gave
the impression that the Post had questioned the in
formation but nonetheless printed it, Greenfield
indicated. But by the time the editorial was pub
lished, the editors had begun to question some of
the information the source provided.
When it became clear to the Post that its source
was not as reliable as the editors had thought, the
paper printed a retraction.
Responding to questions after the talk, Green
field defended the use of anonymous sources as
necessary in some cases. She said loose practices
were being tightened up in the wake of the Janet
Cooke incident, in which a Post writer won a
Pulitzer Prize for a story she fabricated.
Greenfield said the press relies too frequently
on symbols, latching on to Gerald Ford's physical
clumsiness as a metaphor for his administration's
performance, or using the attack of Carter by a
"killer rabbit" to hint at his weak stature, instead of
taking the harder route of providing detailed de
scriptions of issues and policies.
Greenfield also attacked pompous language and
ways of speaking. "Editorial writers have no right
to talk about other people's voices," she said, but

she criticized television newscasters for the intona
tion they use to address their audiences. This false
ness and smugness, shared by all news media, ac
count for some of the distrust the public displays
toward them, Greenfield said.
She also denounced stories which have the ef
fect of glorifying the moral superiority of the poor
as "condescending."
The editorial page editor said that while she
takes seriously the editorials she writes, she does
not have an impression of the editorial board as an
all-powerful body. She referred to instances where
her paper advised the administration to do some
thing and it did the exact opposite.
The Post's editorial board has eight members,
Greenfield said The paper's policy on an issue is
usually determined by the strength of writers'
arguments during daily meetings, which the pub
lisher often attends, she said.
Greenfield did say her paper was not the only
one beset by embarrassing problems. She men
tioned a case where a Boston Globe editorial writ
er put a joke headline on an editorial about a
Carter proposal and the copy desk did not catch
the error. The Globe's editor opened the paper to
find the editorial headlined,"More Mush From
The Wimp."

herself, her paper and the news media last night
for their shortcomings in informing the public.
The 1978 Pulitzer Prize winner told the Terman
Auditorium crowd of about 200 that the press has
the job of enlarging the horizons of its readers, a
responsibility she said "newspapers have not fig
ured out how to do" clearly without sounding
"condescending."
In an informal style similar to that in her News
week columns, Greenfield described the difficulty
reporters face in explaining complex issues, such
as new weapons systems or the social impact of
budget cuts. "By the time I learn enough about a
subject to become an expert," she said,"l lose the
ability to explain it to the reader."
The Post editor talked about her own failings as
she described the latest controversy at that news
paper. The issue concerned a gossip column item
in the Post which quoted a source as saying that in
his last days as president, Jimmy Carter bugged
Blair House, where the Reagans were staying
before Inauguration Day.
Carter vehemently denied the allegation and
threatened to sue the Post. Greenfield, in re
sponse, wrote what she described as "the single

most unsuccessful editorial ever printed." In that
editorial Greenfield defended the Post's editors,
who, she told the audience, believed their source
when the article was published. The editorial gave
the impression that the Post had questioned the in
formation but nonetheless printed it, Greenfield
indicated. But by the time the editorial was pub
lished, the editors had begun to question some of
the information the source provided.
When it became clear to the Post that its source
was not as reliable as the editors had thought, the
paper printed a retraction.
Responding to questions after the talk, Green
field defended the use of anonymous sources as
necessary in some cases. She said loose practices
were being tightened up in the wake of the Janet
Cooke incident, in which a Post writer won a
Pulitzer Prize for a story she fabricated.
Greenfield said the press relies too frequently
on symbols, latching on to Gerald Ford's physical
clumsiness as a metaphor for his administration's
performance, or using the attack of Carter by a
"killer rabbit" to hint at his weak stature, instead of
taking the harder route of providing detailed de
scriptions of issues and policies.
Greenfield also attacked pompous language and
ways of speaking. "Editorial writers have no right
to talk about other people's voices," she said, but

she criticized television newscasters for the intona
tion they use to address their audiences. This false
ness and smugness, shared by all news media, ac
count for some of the distrust the public displays
toward them, Greenfield said.
She also denounced stories which have the ef
fect of glorifying the moral superiority of the poor
as "condescending."
The editorial page editor said that while she
takes seriously the editorials she writes, she does
not have an impression of the editorial board as an
all-powerful body. She referred to instances where
her paper advised the administration to do some
thing and it did the exact opposite.
The Post's editorial board has eight members,
Greenfield said The paper's policy on an issue is
usually determined by the strength of writers'
arguments during daily meetings, which the pub
lisher often attends, she said.
Greenfield did say her paper was not the only
one beset by embarrassing problems. She men
tioned a case where a Boston Globe editorial writ
er put a joke headline on an editorial about a
Carter proposal and the copy desk did not catch
the error. The Globe's editor opened the paper to
find the editorial headlined,"More Mush From
The Wimp."
