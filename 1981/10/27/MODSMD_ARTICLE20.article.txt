Vote this week
As the fee assessment election time
approaches (Oct. 28-29), the staff of
the Women's Center would like to
take this time to stress the im
portance of every member of the
ASSU taking the time to vote. Few
people realize the ASSU consists of
the entire students body at Stanford
on both the undergraduate and
graduate levels.
This opportunity to vote is the time
for members of the ASSU to support
those gro.-jps or organizations that
they feel deserve their fee
assessment dollars. Without these
monies, many groups which provide
valuable services to the Stanford
community are immobilized by a
lack of funds.
It is important to recognize that at
least 20 percent of the entire student
body must vote so that even those
groups which gain a majority vote are
awarded funds. The importance of
takirg the few minutes required to
vote out of your daily routine cannot
be understated.
As members of the ASSU, we all
consider ourselves responsible,
motivated adults. As such, there is

NO reason why 20 percent of our
population cannot vote.
With this in mind, vote on either
October 28 or 29. Vote for all of those
organizations whose contributions
and services you find valuable.
The Women's Center Staff
Aid your party
Like some others from the Hoover
Institution, I will shortly be making
my way to Washington, D.C. Only I
will not be working for the Reagan
Administration. I am a Democrat and
always have been, and in Washington
I will be spending part of my time
doing research for the Democratic
Party. I have not found the Hoover
Institution to be monolithically con
servative or Republican, and i have
never been made to feel out of place
here. There are, in fact, quite a few of
us Democrats here at Hoover.
Why am I leaving? Because now is
the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their party.
