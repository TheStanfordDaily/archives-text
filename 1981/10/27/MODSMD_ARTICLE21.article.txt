## Viewpoint/Mohamed Assad Egypt overdue for change 
### 
It has been more than two weeks since the assassina
tion of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and I feel we are
now better able to assess the situation in a more rational
fashion and away from the fanfare the media bombarded
us with. Now that the dust has settled, we distinguish def
inite winners, albeit, in the short, in the Egyptian drama.
In a careful examination of the post-Sadat political
scene some questions pop up nagging that false sense of
tranquility that we drifted into. How much more was
Sadat really needed for the "peace" process? What more
could he give that he did not already? And how long
could he last a symbol as he was for unconditional sur
render and for Arab boycott? The answers to these and
similar questions are invariably: not much. In short and
in the tradition of American campaigns terminology,
Jjadat has become a "liability."
Following the assassination of Sadat, the U.S. govern
ment moved very quickly to reassert its leading role in
the area and to achieve more strategic gains in Egypt and
the Middle East exploiting to the full extent the vacuurti
produced temporarily. Some of these gains are:
• A further increase in its political control over Egyptiar
domestic and foreign affairs. Haig suddenly became the
legal guardian of the Egyptian government that lost its
"daddy."
• Increasing its military presence in both Egypt and the
Sudan to the degree of near colonization of that area.
• Intensifying propaganda campaign against Libya similar
to that preceding the invasion of Uganda by Tanzanian
forces.
• The legitimization of its political and military endeavors
in the area under the pretext of "potentially destabiliz
ing threats" from the Soviet Union or Libya or, realistical
ly, from the people of their own countries.
This legitimization of American dominance is soon
carried to the rest of the Middle East. The AWACS sud
denly became the symbol of American protection; its
presence is the ultimate guardian from "impending So
viet occupation." Any country the AWACS do not bless
would soon fall to the knocking bear. It is precisely this
hysteria that is used as a process of legalizing American
dominance in the area.
Finally, the process started by Sadat that was intended
to carry the whole Arab world and Israel into strategic
ties and into American sphere was obviously faltering
and destined to a dead-end. Sadat became an obstacle
preventing other Arab regimes from joining the band
wagon, and a symbol against whom Egyptian opposition
is uniting, an ominous reminder of the last days of the
Shah. Egypt was definitely overdue for a facelift that does
not alter nor hurt the inner circle ruling Egypt and insure
the continuation of the status quo deflecting temporarily
the internal unrest. The drama is a classic example of a
deed, welcome in itself, and carried by honest people
that for a variety of reasons produces the wrong results.
