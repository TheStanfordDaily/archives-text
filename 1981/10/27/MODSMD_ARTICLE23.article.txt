## Palestine question needs resolution 
### 
The Middle East is indeed in turmoil, and will continue
to be so as long as the question of Palestine is not re
solved. This requires the correction of injustices which
have been inflicted upon the Palestinian people by the
Zionist movement, British colonialism, and the State of
Israel and its main ally — the United States. These in
justices include the massive demographic and land trans
formation in Palestine in the first half of this century, the
expulsion of most of the Palestiniansoutsidetheirhome
land in 1948 and 1967, the daily subjugation of more than
a million Palestinians on the West Bank, Gaza, and inside
Israel to the Israeli army's iron fist, and the massive bom
bing and shelling of Palestinian refugee camps in Leba
non.
These problems form the crux of the Arab-Israeli con
flict; the animosity between Israel and the Arab coun
tries is only an outcome of the Palestinian-Zionist con
flict over the land of Palestine. A cosmetic solution of the
Egyptian-Israeli type is misdirected because it treats the
symptom instead of facing the disease itself. The Camp
David Accords have only separated Egypt from the rest of
the Arab world, and strengthened Israeli power and in
transigence. The result has been an increased number of
fanatic Jewish settlers on the West Bank, and more Amer
ican-made bombs killing thousands of Palestinians and
Lebanese in Lebanon. Camp David Accords have not
achieved peace nor stability in the Middle East. They
have brought about war, death, hatred, and increased
U.S. military power in the area. This will indeed be the
outcome of any "solution" that does not address the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict directly.
While the Palestinians have offered several solutions
for this conflict, assuring peace and coexistence with the
jews in Palestine, the Zionist movement and Israeli gov
ernments have offered none; instead, they practiced ag
gression, annexation, dominance, and subjugation of
the Palestinian people. Proposals of "self-rule" on the

West Bank form an obvious euphemism for "legitimized
Israeli-rule" that they are not worth any analysis here.
In the 1920s and 19305, the Palestinians had very clear
proposals to solve the Palestinian-Zionist conflict. These
include: independence from colonial Britain, an end to
the massive land and demographic transformation, and
the establishment of a democratically representative
state for the Jews, Christians, and Moslems in Palestine.
The Zionist movement had its own clear proposals: the
continued use of the British colonial power to bring
about an even more massive land and demographic
transformation in Palestine in order to establish a Jewish
State for the Jews only.
In the past decade, the Palestinian people have put
forward the proposal of a secular democratic state in
Palestine where jews, Christians, and Moslems can live
together in one democratic state. The Israeli response
has been extremely negative. Later, many Palestinians
have accepted the idea of a two-state solution that in
sures the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state. The Israeli response has been the colonization of
more than a third of the West Bank and terrorization of
the Palestinians on the other two thirds. A great deal of
the Israeli reaction toward the Palestinians can be sum
marized in a statement by Golda Meier, a former Israeli
premier, when she said: "There was no such thing as
Palestinians ... It was not as though there was a Palesti
nian people . . . and we came and threw them out and
took their country from them. They did not exist."
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict cannot be resolved un
less the Israelis realize that there is a Palestinian people
whom they have displaced in Palestine, and start putting
forward "peace" instead of "war" formula for such a res
olution. Only then would the Arab-Israeli conflict have a
chance of being resolved.

together in one democratic state. The Israeli response
has been extremely negative. Later, many Palestinians
have accepted the idea of a two-state solution that in
sures the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state. The Israeli response has been the colonization of
more than a third of the West Bank and terrorization of
the Palestinians on the other two thirds. A great deal of
the Israeli reaction toward the Palestinians can be sum
marized in a statement by Golda Meier, a former Israeli
premier, when she said: "There was no such thing as
Palestinians ... It was not as though there was a Palesti
nian people . . . and we came and threw them out and
took their country from them. They did not exist."
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict cannot be resolved un
less the Israelis realize that there is a Palestinian people
whom they have displaced in Palestine, and start putting
forward "peace" instead of "war" formula for such a res
olution. Only then would the Arab-Israeli conflict have a
chance of being resolved.

The Middle East is indeed in turmoil, and will continue
to be so as long as the question of Palestine is not re
solved. This requires the correction of injustices which
have been inflicted upon the Palestinian people by the
Zionist movement, British colonialism, and the State of
Israel and its main ally — the United States. These in
justices include the massive demographic and land trans
formation in Palestine in the first half of this century, the
expulsion of most of the Palestiniansoutsidetheirhome
land in 1948 and 1967, the daily subjugation of more than
a million Palestinians on the West Bank, Gaza, and inside
Israel to the Israeli army's iron fist, and the massive bom
bing and shelling of Palestinian refugee camps in Leba
non.
These problems form the crux of the Arab-Israeli con
flict; the animosity between Israel and the Arab coun
tries is only an outcome of the Palestinian-Zionist con
flict over the land of Palestine. A cosmetic solution of the
Egyptian-Israeli type is misdirected because it treats the
symptom instead of facing the disease itself. The Camp
David Accords have only separated Egypt from the rest of
the Arab world, and strengthened Israeli power and in
transigence. The result has been an increased number of
fanatic Jewish settlers on the West Bank, and more Amer
ican-made bombs killing thousands of Palestinians and
Lebanese in Lebanon. Camp David Accords have not
achieved peace nor stability in the Middle East. They
have brought about war, death, hatred, and increased
U.S. military power in the area. This will indeed be the
outcome of any "solution" that does not address the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict directly.
While the Palestinians have offered several solutions
for this conflict, assuring peace and coexistence with the
jews in Palestine, the Zionist movement and Israeli gov
ernments have offered none; instead, they practiced ag
gression, annexation, dominance, and subjugation of
the Palestinian people. Proposals of "self-rule" on the

West Bank form an obvious euphemism for "legitimized
Israeli-rule" that they are not worth any analysis here.
In the 1920s and 19305, the Palestinians had very clear
proposals to solve the Palestinian-Zionist conflict. These
include: independence from colonial Britain, an end to
the massive land and demographic transformation, and
the establishment of a democratically representative
state for the Jews, Christians, and Moslems in Palestine.
The Zionist movement had its own clear proposals: the
continued use of the British colonial power to bring
about an even more massive land and demographic
transformation in Palestine in order to establish a Jewish
State for the Jews only.
In the past decade, the Palestinian people have put
forward the proposal of a secular democratic state in
Palestine where jews, Christians, and Moslems can live
together in one democratic state. The Israeli response
has been extremely negative. Later, many Palestinians
have accepted the idea of a two-state solution that in
sures the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state. The Israeli response has been the colonization of
more than a third of the West Bank and terrorization of
the Palestinians on the other two thirds. A great deal of
the Israeli reaction toward the Palestinians can be sum
marized in a statement by Golda Meier, a former Israeli
