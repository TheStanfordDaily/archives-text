## Sadat paid for courage 
### 
Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Pope John
Paul 11, and now, Anwar Sadat. Each of these men com
mitted themselves to the building of a more peaceful
world through nonviolent means. Each of them, with the
exception of the Pope, paid for their efforts with their
lives. A frightening conclusion can be drawn from these
senseless assassinations.
Gandhi, a self-effacing and humbly-living man, was
the architect of India's freedom from British rule
through nonviolent revolution. He made his ideas felt
when they were most needed — his nation's transition
from an imperial colony to an independent and func
tioning democracy. As in any such exchange of political
power, there existed the potential for bloody sectarian
strife. Yet, this humble and humane man and his non-,
violent creed influenced the people and events of his
time enough to bring about a peaceful solution to a
potentially violent situation.
Martin Luther King taught us about the inherent digni
ty of all people, and that they ought to be treated accord
ingly. He could have chosen to follow the anarchic trend
of many of the movements of the 19605. In doing so, his
"dream" would have been perverted into violent class
struggle. Instead, he appealed to both blacks and whites,
rich and poor. His was a sincere message of peace. Peo
ple responded to that, rather than to the harangues of
the extremists. In King's struggle to realize his "dream",
he did indeed prove the inherent dignity of human kincj.
As the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church,
John Paul II speaks for some 800 million people, however
he commands neither armies nor navies. In his travels
throughout the world, he has brought together millions
of people of all races, creeds and nationalities — to sing,
to pray, and to accept Christ's message. He spoke of lov
ing one's neighbor, of reconciliation, and of peace on
Earth. And yet, but for the grace of God, an assassin's bul
let would have claimed him as well.
And now this. A man who knew the futility of war and
the necessity of peace. A man who saw through the blind
hatred and the belligerent perspective of his Arab neigh
bors, and chose the only road that could possibly lead to
a brighter future for the people of Egypt — the way of
peace and of reconciliation. Anwar Sadat was a man of
rare vision and courage, and the world will be a sadder
place without him.
The tragedy of it all is, that we as a race seem so intent
on exterminating those whom we need the most — the
peacemakers. We find it easy to bow to the demands of
terrorists, to build newer and more terrifying weapons,
and to join the frenzied mobs chanting "Death to Ameri
ca!" or "Nuke Iran!", When people of conscience try to
make us face our collective insanity, they are slain, and
then forgotten. Every such person, every Gandhi and ev
ery Sadat, is to this world what burning candles are to a
darkened room — and with every such assassination the
darkness of war and chaos comes closer to overwhelm
ing us.
