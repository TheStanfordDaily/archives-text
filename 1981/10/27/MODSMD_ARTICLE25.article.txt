## U.S. tactics, cold war strategy worsen Mideast problems 
### 
Anwar Sadat was murdered by domestic
enemies. According to the Egyptian police
they were dissident army officers who op
posed Sadat's efforts to modernize Egypt.
Yet how did the U.S. government respond to
his death? The funeral was scarcely over
before the Pentagon announced large-scale
military maneuvers, complete with B-525, to
be held jointly with Egypt, Oman, and
Sudan. At the same time the Administration
dispatched two AWACS planes to Egypt and
speeded up delivery of $100 million worth of
military equipment to Sudan. (Sudan's Presi
dent Gaafar al-Nimeiri greeted this an
nouncement with the suggestion that he
might launch commando attacks against Lib
ya.)
President Ronald Reagan is continuing a
long-standing U.S. policy of making the
Middle East an ever-growing arsenal — to be
used, presumably, against aggression by the
Soviet Union or its clients. This year as in the
past, 60 percent of all our arms shipments

abroad will go to the area.
The recipients of the weapons are coun
tries beset with internal economic problems,
religious conflicts, and grievances deeply
rooted in past history. Flooding them with
arms is a dangerous substitute for a coherent
effort to reduce tensions that might at any
time explode into a major war.
Military aid to Egypt, for example, will not
help close the growing gap between the rich
ancl the poor or appease the religious fun
damentalists, but will only drain resources
from an already troubled economy. Just as
vastly increased arms sales to Iran hastened
the downfall of the Shah, more arms for
Saudi Arabia will exacerbate problems that
arise when a traditional culture is suddenly
exposed to Western technology and rapid
social change. Military aid to Sudan's Presi
dent Nimeiri is simply another example of
U.S. commitment to a shaky autocrat who is
unable to alleviate the desperate poverty of

his country. Nimeiri's main use for American
arms is to retain the loyalty of his army and
fend off internal enemies.
The most sterile aspect of U.S. policy in the
Middle East has been our failure to deal
directly with the conflict between Israel's re
fusal to give up captured territories and the
desire of four million Palestinians for a
homeland — a conflict that underlies and in
tensifies the area's troubles. The Camp David
agreements, like the shuttle diplomacy of
Henry Kissinger and Philip Habib, have done
nothing to resolve this conflict. Even the
scheduled autonomy talks between Israel
and Egypt can hardly be fruitful, since the
land in question — the occupied West Bank
— is now populated by at least 20,000 heavily
armed Israeli settlers who have vowed
bloody resistence to any meaningful self
rule by the Palestinians.
U.S. reliance on military aid and military al
liances in the Middle East, and its inattention

to the area's basic problems, are by-products
of our continuing cold-war assumptions.
Succeeding administrations have viewed the
Middle East largely as a target for Soviet ex
pansion, never recognizing that internal ten
sions exacerbated by our policies could
weaken existing governments and make
them more vulnerable to outside interven
tion.
In October 1977 there was a glimmer of
hope that this situation might change. The
United States and the Soviet Union issued a
joint call for Middle East peace negotiations
between "all parties involved in the con
flict," to be co-chaired by the two super
powers. The joint declaration urged a settle
ment that would ensure "the security of the
borders between Israel and the neighboring
Arab states," as well as "the legitimate rights
of the Palestinian people," and provide for
'the establishment of normal peaceful rela
tions on the basis of mutual recognition of

the principles of sovereignty, territorial inte
grity and independence."
The declaration drew a storm of protest
from Israel and was quickly abandoned by
the Carter administration. A month later
Anwar Sadat made his historic trip to Jerusa
lem and the Camp David process began. But
that process, with its resulting peace treaty,
failed to resolve the Palestinian question,
divided the Arab world, and shut out the So
viet Union from the role it had hoped to play
as joint peace maker. Today there is peace of
sorts in the Middle East. But Lebanon is a ru
ined country and its neighbors are stock
piling arms — including, perhaps, nuclear
weapons. There is an urgent need for the
United States to stop treating the Middle East
as an arena of cold war confrontation and to
begin the difficult but necessary effort to
find economic and political solutions to the
area's real problems.
