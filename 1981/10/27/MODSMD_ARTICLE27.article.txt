## Resist extremist demands 
### 
Should we support Palestinian de
mands for a sovereign homeland and
for Israel's withdrawal to the frontiers
of 1967? There may be three reasons
for it: Ourdesirefor peace,oursense
of justice, and our desire to please
powerful Arab states which support
these demands.
As to peace, the frontiers of 1967
clearly did not satisfy the enemies of
Israel: They started the blockade
which led to the six-day war and the
occupation of the disputed territo
ries. Returning these territories
would by itself not promote peace,
but provide a better position for war
against the enemy Israel.
As to the sense of justice, it should
apply equally to the Ibos of Nigeria,
the Kurds of Iraq, the Basques of
Spain, the Christians of Lebanon, and
others. As we hear very little of the
demands of those others we con
clude that our desire to please the
Saudis is the main reason for support
ing the PLO.

I am old enough to remember the
Munich agreements: The alleged op
pression of the German speaking mi
nority by Czechoslovakia lent an air
of justice to the demand for adding
partsof that country toGermany. The
agreement was intended to secure
peace. It doomed thefateof Czecho
slovakia, forced war upon Britain and
France, and ultimately brought mi
sery to Germany.
Today the Palestinians are in a situ
ation similar to that of the Sudeten
Germans, the Arab supporters of the
PLO play a role similar to that of Ger
many before Munich, and our ex
presidents talk like Chamberlain
before Munich.
Then as now an extreme faction
spoke for the whole population.
Then as now the appeal of extreme
positions had gained that faction
sympathy within and outside their
country. Then as now it seemed wise
to some to satisfy the demands of a
powerful country to gain its friend
ship. The result of this policy was the

quick destruction of Czechoslovakia,
an exhausting war forced on France
and Britain, and later great misery for
Germany. What can we expect today
of a policy of appeasement? War
against Israel by its enemies, domi
nation of most Arab states by the likes
of Khadaffi and Khomeini, and prob
ably a nuclear confrontation be
tween East and West.
What can we do? Perhaps not
much, but at least we can resist de
mands by extremists and continue to
support those who actively pursue
peace, as Sadat did, and to support
those who urgently need peace like
the Israelis and Egyptians. Life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness are the
rights of the Palestinians and of all
other minorities. Those rights can be
obtained in a framework other than
sovereignty and war, as shown for in
stance by the Druses in Israel and the
Christians in Egypt.
