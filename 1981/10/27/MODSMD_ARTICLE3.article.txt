# Fee vote crucial to organizations
## 
### Bambi Haggins 
More than $200,000 of possible
funding and the futures of more than
50 student organizations will be de
cided upon in the special election to
be held tomorrow and Thursday.
The special election is a result of an
unsuccessful effort to receive 20 per
cent of the student body's vote for
several fee assessments that ap
peared on last spring's ballot. This
election has also allowed groups not
on the spring ballot to vie for fee
assessment monies.
The ASSU has been waging an in
tense advertising campaign to get out
the vote. "We are hoping there will
be a greater voter turnout," said
Dave Phelps, ASSU Senate chair.
"There are so many groups that will
be affected by this election — espe
cially by the program fee assessment
and the AOB (Academic Organiza
tions Board)."
Phelps stressed that there are sev
eral projects that would be discon
tinued without the fee assessment.
The Legal Counseling Service would
immediately be stopped. "We
wouldn't be able to afford to pay the
lawyer's fees," said Phelps.
Tne Legal Service fee assessment
received a majority of the votes cast
in the spring election but the number
of votes cast on its assessment was
below the required 20 percent of the
student body. Because of that 20 per
cent requirement, the graduate as
well as the undergraduate vote is
being sought through flyers and ban
ners. Even an airplane flying over
Stanford Stadium at Saturday's game
reminded students of the upcoming
election. The graduate student vote
is vital to the election, according to
Phelps, because graduate students
constitute approximately 50 percent
of the student body. Without their
votes, 40 percent of the under
graduates would have to vote in or
der to get the required 20 percent.
The ASSU campaign is not the only
publicity about the campaign being
generated on campus. Leaders of
groups whose funding status is at
stake have been encouraging their
memberships to get out the vote.
This is especially true of the umbrella
groups that supply funding and sup
port for a number of organizations
and events — because the fate of
more than one organization is resting
on their prospective assessments in

the special election.
Academic Organizations Board
(AOB) and program fee are the two
assessments that will affect the most
students if they fail to pass. AOB is
comprised of the campus's academic
and preprofessional organizations
including International Relations So
ciety, Black Pre-Law, Native Ameri
can Pre-Law, History Under
graduates Association and the Amer
ican Studies Association. The only
source of funding for these groups
comes from the AOB and without it
the groups and their programs may
cease to exist.
The failure of the program fee
assessment to pass would immobilize
nearly 40 student organizations. The
program fee provides money for
groups that are too small to request a
fee assessment of their own or
groups that feel because of their
ethnic or social orientation passage
of a fee assessment would be unlike
ly. The Gay People's Union (CPU),
the Black Student Union (BSU) and
the Asian American Activities Center
(AAAC), are among the groups that
will be affected.
"It would be devastating," said a
spokesperson for the GPU. "We
wouldn't be able to maintain our re
sources — the telephone services,
the workshops, speakers, social ac
tivities and advertising for all of those
events. We would have to find alter
nate sources of income and drastical
ly curtail activities until we found the
funding."
The same sort of picture was
painted by Doris Wilson, spokesman
for the BSU. The group is funded
from the program fee and in turn,
funds several smaller organizations.
"It would be very detrimental to all of
the cultural, social and political or
ganizations dependent on us and in
turn, it would hurt the whole com
munity," said Wilson.
"The office space will be here but
none of the resources to do anything
with it," said Hope Nakamura of the
AAAC. Like all of the other groups
dependent on program fee monies,
the AAAC has no alternate source of
income. "A whole sector of the mi
nority community will not be ade
quately served," said Nakamura.
Other proposals involving um
brella groups include the Stanford
Progressive Alliance, a group which
encompasses a broad assortment of

social action organizations and spon
sors speaker series, forums and films;
the Women's Center, a resource cen
ter that operates a 24-hour informa
tion line, and co-sponsors events and
workshops including Rape Aware
ness Week; as well as the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), a non-partisan student or
ganization dedicated to sparking in
terest in and awareness of the politi
cal process and pressing political is
sues.
"We still have some money in the
bank," said Jeff Gutman of SCOPE,
"but without the fee assessment,
we'll be out of business. That's the
source of all our funding, without it
we can't possibly keep going."
SCOPE has sponsored speeches by
William Buckley, Malcolm Toone,
George McGovern and John An
derson in the past two years.
The Publications Board fee
assessment funds several publica
tions around campus. Some of those
publications face drastic cutbacks
and might have to stop publication.
Some of the publications affected by
the election are Stanford Libertarian,
Dial Tone and Sequoia.
There are other larger publications
that are less dependent on Publica
tions Board funding. "We would be
very happy if the publications board
fee assessment passed," said Seth
Zuckerman of the Stanford Inde
pendent, "but its failure to pass
would have less of an effect on us
than it would have on Sequoia or Au
rora, both of which are dependent
on Pub Board money."
Margaret Ward of Sequoia said
that the fee assessment would not af
fect this quarter's publication but
would definitely put those of winter
and spring in jeopardy. "Sequoia has
always been funded by the University
in one way or another — whether
through the Pub Board or some other
fund. Without the Pub Board money,
we are totally dependent on the sale
of a magazine that is sold at cost and
designed to, hopefully, break even,
but not to turn a profit. Sequoia
could be irrepairably damaged in this
economic crunch," said Ward.
Two other assessments that affect,
respectively, a wide and narrow por
tion of the Stanford community are
the Bridge and Volunteers in Asia.
While the Bridge would be able to
