## Country Joe McDonald: bringing the spirit of 1969 The 						rebel with a cause(s), still 
### Stephen Williams 
Country Joe McDonald has a
strong and steady, though calm
voice. In a time when beliefs
pass with the seasons, Country
Joe holds his serious and
thoughtful tenets steady. He is
an American musician in the
tradition of Woody Guthrie,
Bootsilla, and Exene of X.
Though they use different
forms, these musicians speak
their minds through music.
In contrast with the others,
one dead, two famous, Coun
try Joe's exhortations of Ameri
ca go relatively unnoticed. He
has not captivated the hearts
and minds of American music
fans since his legendary Fish
Cheer competed for attention
with Jimi Hendrix's version of
the Star Spangled Banner at the
Woodstock Music Festival, and
on the album of the same
name.
The Fish Cheer, a funny,
raucous diatribe against the

Vietnam war, made Country
Joe an American youth hero,
and also helped him become
an ex-rock star, at least in the
states. "Because of the Fish
Cheer, and because of politics,
I wound up getting blacklisted
in a way in the states, in the mu
sic business. Because of this,
you don't read much about
me," he maintains.
Country joe admits his belief
that he was blacklisted is
speculative, but supports his
claim with several stories. For a
time, during the Nixon admin
istration, his record company,
Rag Baby, was audited by the
Internal Revenue Service every

three months. "When asked
why, the auditors replied that
they were 'simply following or
ders/says Country Joe.
This, and other more subtle
forms of harrassment, have
stuck with Country joe, and he
is slightly put off when asked
where he has been for the last
five years. "People in the states
have to ask me that . . . but I
have been recording, and tour
ing Europe," he says. His rec
ords are distributee] by Fantasy
Records throughout Europe,
and he has little trouble book
ing concerts there.
Though Country Joe has
worked with many bands since
the Fish, he now performssolo,
"to make a statement about
energy, and American music,"
often playing acoustic guitar,
though he sometimes plays
electric. Touring with a lot of
equipment, a routine for most
rock bands, "is a waste of
energy and is misleading," ac-

cording to Country Joe. "You
don't need to be wasteful to
make good American music."
Vietnam hasn't left Country
Joe's thoughts, or become a
distant event to be perused in
movies and books. His music
reflects the plight of Vietnam
veterans, ana much of his re
cent political work has been
directed at those for whom the
war has not ended.
"There are still an enormous
number of wounded to attend
to from the Vietnam war," he
says, sounding likea lone med
ic on the battlefield. "It is an il
lusion that the warended. It isa
moving experience to meet

someone who is dying from ex
posure to Agent Orange."
Country Joe's concern for
the veterans reflects his gener
al dissatisfaction with the
world. "There is a war going
on, and it's been going on for a
long time, between the people
who want to survive, and the
people who don't care. We are
approaching our own doom,"
he says.
When asked what the aver
age person can do to correct
the situation he described,
Country Joe jumps. "That
question is almost ridiculous,"
he says. "But I will treat it with
some respect, assuming that it
comes from naivete. Look
around. You will see that there
are a million things to be done.
People all over are wondering
what can be done. While they
are wondering, they are driv
ing, not walking, littering the
land with debris, filling them
selves, their children, and their
friends with chemicals, and
casting votes on issues they
don't really understand. There
is so much to be done."
The legends and myths of
America are alive when Coun
try Joe speaks of the need to
learn "survival skills." These
are not the skills needed to
protect a cache of food from
roving bands of armed lunatic
urbanites, as espoused by the
recently media-hyped "sur
vivalists." Rather Country Joe
advocates that people must
learn to depend on them
selves, and not always pay
someone to complete their
tasks.
McDonald sees a generally
soft America where, "the
middle class feels that it has
been given life. In the not so
distant past people had to build
their lives. They didn't demand
convenience," he says.
Technology is making the
world a smaller place, in the
sense that people are more
aware of events on the other
side of the earth. Country Joe
believes that a "global aware
ness" is necessary before a
more just society will develop.
Nationalism is an outdated
concept for him.
He does not foresee any fun
damental changes for the
world in the next 50 or 60years,
barring nuclear war. Still, he
plans to work towards a global
society in which people are
aware that their actions affect
everyone, not just those in
their immediate sphere.
"A person must think all day,
every day, 'what am I doing
that is harming the world?'
Country Joe says, looking to
the floor.
After a minute he laughs and
says, "you know, I write songs
about flowers too. And when I
get home, and I'm tired, I wind
down with a beer like everyone
else."
