# And as a singer, well, he's a good rebel

### David Schmelzer 
Country Joe McDonald
Memorial Auditorium
24 October 1981
Every now and then a clear
distinction crops up between
entertainment and en
lightenment. One became ap
parent about half-way through
Country Joe McDonald's con
cert Saturday night at Memori
al Auditorium, probably when
his song about soldiers bleed
ing to death in Vietnam led into
one about dying from radiation
poisoning, followed by a musi
cal discussion of starving
natives in Jamaica.
McDonald's primary source
of fame is having been an
asterisk at Woodstock: the an
swer to "Name an artist who
was there along with Joplin,
Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane
and the rest." That he hasn't
equalled their popularity isn't
overly surprising, since a dedi
cated protest singer is rarely
going to tread the waters of
commercial success. And he is
dedicated; he still fights for
new causes and he still has a
peace sign plastered to his
guitar. For many of us Ameri
cans Country Joe is good to
have arouna because he can
fight our battles for the op
pressed while we drive our
Buicks home and watch
Laverne and Shirley. He's the
ultimate luxury item.
A lot of McDonald's career
has been spent in a continuous
bitter parody; he plays happy
little tunes while singing
"whoopee, we're all gonna
die." While this adds interest
ing and appreciated spice to a

music industry that seems pri
marily concerned with wheth
er or not Don's true love will be
enough to get Jenny back, it's
still difficult to consider Coun
try Joe as a party of the business
as a whole. Is he a thoughtful
singer or a muisical activist?
The latter dominated at his
concert.
Given this, the problem he
faces is finding new battles to

charge into. He spent some
time Saturday night talking
about the forgotten Vietnam
veterans and about how their
suicides after the war account
for more deaths that those that
happened during the war itself.
He talked briefly about El
Salvador (the concert was a
benefit for the Stanford Cen
tral American Action
Network). He sang about the
fast-disappearing whales. But
he also didn't adequately ex
plain some issues, particularly

one in which he criticized the
government for killing coyotes
in order to protect grazing cat
tle. So? What if they listen to
you and stop, Joe? Do you sing
a "Save the Cows" song them,
or maybe one to "Save the
Starving People?"
The crowd certainly didn't
quibble with him, what little
there was of it. They look more
like products of Woodstock

than he did — Saturday's bene
fit may have been enough to
singlehandedly revive the tie
dye industry. They were en
thusiastic and responsive, but
so few that they couldn't have
given SCAAN much monetary
support. People that stage a
benefit face the problem of not
wanting to spend much money
on promotion, yet needing the
promotion to draw enough
people to make the benefit
worthwhile. SCAAN apparent
ly didn't find the optimal bal

ance.
Country's Joe's opening acts,
local bands Blade Brown and
Wildebeest, were both good,
but played much too long. The
main attraction of a show that
starts at 8 p.m. shouldn't be
starting his set at 11 p.m.
Only one of Blade Brown's
members, Adlai Alexander,
performed Saturday. He
showed impressive vocal
power and a light touch on the
acoustic guitar, but he should
have cut his set by twenty
minutes. His songs were good,
( the point remains that he
was an opening act trying to
warm up an audience, not a
headliner showing oif his rep
ertoire.
The same applied to Wild
ebeest,-who played even long
er than Alexander. Saturday
night was their final per
formance together and \hey
went out well. They made \he
event seem even more like a
private party when they eat
about half of the small crowd t$
dance in the aisles. Most of.
their music was driving (if a bit
fragmented) rock, and their
lead singer was non-stop
energy. But, even though it was
their lastxtime together, they
had a responsibility to yield the
stage to McDonald long before
they did. The night was his, not
theirs, yet they played every bit
as long as he eventually did.
McDonald himself is such a
sincere and driven man that
you can't help but admire him
for his struggle for what's right.
But you admire him more as an
activist than as a popular enter
tainer.

ance.
Country's Joe's opening acts,
local bands Blade Brown and
Wildebeest, were both good,
but played much too long. The
main attraction of a show that
starts at 8 p.m. shouldn't be
starting his set at 11 p.m.
Only one of Blade Brown's
members, Adlai Alexander,
performed Saturday. He
showed impressive vocal
power and a light touch on the
acoustic guitar, but he should
have cut his set by twenty
minutes. His songs were good,
( the point remains that he
was an opening act trying to
warm up an audience, not a
headliner showing oif his rep
ertoire.
The same applied to Wild
ebeest,-who played even long
er than Alexander. Saturday
night was their final per
formance together and \hey
went out well. They made \he
event seem even more like a
private party when they eat
about half of the small crowd t$
dance in the aisles. Most of.
their music was driving (if a bit
fragmented) rock, and their
lead singer was non-stop
energy. But, even though it was
their lastxtime together, they
had a responsibility to yield the
stage to McDonald long before
they did. The night was his, not
theirs, yet they played every bit
as long as he eventually did.
McDonald himself is such a
sincere and driven man that
you can't help but admire him
for his struggle for what's right.
But you admire him more as an
activist than as a popular enter
tainer.



. . . and Saturday at the SCAAN benefit in Mem Aud
Country Joe McDonald
Memorial Auditorium
24 October 1981
Every now and then a clear
distinction crops up between
entertainment and en
lightenment. One became ap
parent about half-way through
Country Joe McDonald's con
cert Saturday night at Memori
al Auditorium, probably when
his song about soldiers bleed
ing to death in Vietnam led into
one about dying from radiation
poisoning, followed by a musi
cal discussion of starving
natives in Jamaica.
McDonald's primary source
of fame is having been an
asterisk at Woodstock: the an
swer to "Name an artist who
was there along with Joplin,
Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane
and the rest." That he hasn't
equalled their popularity isn't
overly surprising, since a dedi
cated protest singer is rarely
going to tread the waters of
commercial success. And he is
dedicated; he still fights for
new causes and he still has a
peace sign plastered to his
guitar. For many of us Ameri
cans Country Joe is good to
have arouna because he can
fight our battles for the op
pressed while we drive our
Buicks home and watch
Laverne and Shirley. He's the
ultimate luxury item.
A lot of McDonald's career
has been spent in a continuous
bitter parody; he plays happy
little tunes while singing
"whoopee, we're all gonna
die." While this adds interest
ing and appreciated spice to a

music industry that seems pri
marily concerned with wheth
er or not Don's true love will be
enough to get Jenny back, it's
still difficult to consider Coun
try Joe as a party of the business
as a whole. Is he a thoughtful
singer or a muisical activist?
The latter dominated at his
concert.
Given this, the problem he
faces is finding new battles to

charge into. He spent some
time Saturday night talking
about the forgotten Vietnam
veterans and about how their
suicides after the war account
for more deaths that those that
happened during the war itself.
He talked briefly about El
Salvador (the concert was a
benefit for the Stanford Cen
tral American Action
Network). He sang about the
fast-disappearing whales. But
he also didn't adequately ex
plain some issues, particularly

one in which he criticized the
government for killing coyotes
in order to protect grazing cat
tle. So? What if they listen to
you and stop, Joe? Do you sing
a "Save the Cows" song them,
or maybe one to "Save the
Starving People?"
The crowd certainly didn't
quibble with him, what little
there was of it. They look more
like products of Woodstock

than he did — Saturday's bene
fit may have been enough to
singlehandedly revive the tie
dye industry. They were en
thusiastic and responsive, but
so few that they couldn't have
given SCAAN much monetary
support. People that stage a
benefit face the problem of not
wanting to spend much money
on promotion, yet needing the
promotion to draw enough
people to make the benefit
worthwhile. SCAAN apparent
ly didn't find the optimal bal

ance.
