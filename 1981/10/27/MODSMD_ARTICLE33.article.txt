# 'Priest of Love' makes the difficult seem impossible
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Possibly the most difficult
kind of movie to pull off is the
biography of a genius. Creative
fire can spark a movie, but it is
an uncomfortable subject for
one; how can filmmakers con
vey a sense of energy so
ferocious and shining that it
can produce Don Giovanni or
the Guernica?.
Onscreen, biographies tend
to be absurd chronicles of en
counters of overdressed actors
bearing the names of famous
artists or politicians. They tend
to bog down in domestic
scenes and leak the sort of his
torical ironies that historical
hindsight makes easy. The peo
ple who put together Priest of
Love, the story of David
Herbert and Frieda van Rich
tofen Lawrence — Christopher
Miles, who directed, and Alan
Plater, who adapted the script
from Harry T. Moore's book
and Lawrence's letters — have
clearly striven to avoid the
traps of the genre, but in doing
so they have bungled the pic
ture in other, more surprising
ways.
Behind the credits, we see
the public burning, in 1915, of a
thousand copies of Lawrence's
The Rainbow, declared ob
scene, and we anticipate a
treatment of the persecution of
a visionary writer who sought
to liberate his readers and suf
fered in his lifetime constant
repudiation for the candid sex
ual content of his work. The ti
tle, too, suggest such an order
ing of the facts of Lawrence's
life; it derives from his own
lines "I shall always be a priest
of love, and a glad one, and I
shall preach my heart out. .

But that isn't what this movie
is about, although we return to
the subject of the censorship of
Lawrence's writing (and paint
ing) once every half hour or so.
Instead, after the opening
scene, Miles immediately
jumps ahead to 1922 and the
journey the Lawrences took to
Taos, New Mexico, at the in
vitation of a wealthy woman
named Mabel Dodge Luhan
who had an urge to play pa
troness to the scandalous gen
ius. Lawrence's visit to the
Luhan ranch, where Mabel's
native American husband Tony
led rites of worship to the sun
god, might furnish a funny
anecdotal episode for a film,
but why on earth would any
one begin the story of the Law
rences here?
The answer seems to be: to
steer the movie away from the
well trodden path of most bio
graphies, which stick to a
chronological structure. But
dramatically, Miles' plan is a
washout, because we don't yet
know these characters well
enough to understand the ec
centric ways in which they
communicate with each other.
Their behavior in this highly
unconventional setting, re
moved from any possible com
parison with their behavior at
home, holds no meaning for
us. It's as though Plater and
Miles had started somewhere
early in the second act of a two
act play and expected the
members of the audience to
carry the information and emo
tional baggage of the previous,
unperformed scenes in their

heads.
We want to know how this
marriage come to be, what
drew the blustering, manic
Lawrence (lan McKellen) and
the indomitable, passionate
Frieda (Janet Suzman) together
— but by the time we find out,
in a very brief flashback, we've
stopped waiting for an answer.
In this movie all the important
scenes are dispensed within
flashbacks so succinct that
they're practically apologies —
the death of Lawrence's moth
er, his eloping with Frieda, the
suspicion, during World War I,
that the two of them are Ger

man spies. In between, the
couple travels endlessly and
confusingly from new Mexico
to old Mexico to France and It
aly — the better part of this
movie is like those dreary hon
eymoon montages in romantic
dramas that audiences usually
don't pay attention to. New
characters wander in and
without explanation, and we
keep losing track of where the
Lawrences are and whom
they're talking to (or fighting
with). Frieda's daughters show
up unannounced, and all we
can remember about them is
that she had to leave them with
her husband when she ran off
with Lawrence and was for
bidden to see them again —
when did they come back into
her life? Early in the film, she
learns that Lawrence's tuber
culosis will kill him within two
years; when he finally dies, we
don't know how much time has
actually elasped.
Constructing a movie in this
fashion may sidestep cliche,
but it's perverse, and it doesn't
serve its male star, lan
McKellen, very well. I've seen
McKellen on stage twice — in a
technically precise but hollow
performance (as Salieri in Peter
Schaffer's award-heaped
Amadeus) and, five years ago,
as Leontes in The Winter's
Tale.) It was a piece of acting I'll
never forget: he played the
jealous king as a psychotic, and
his rages were so terrifying that
even in the springtime scenes,
when Leontes had repented,
you waited for him to erupt
once more. His interpretation
damaged the meaning of
Shakespeare's play, but it was
amazing, and his portrayal of
Lawrence ("Lorenzo," as

Frieda called him), a role in
which he is ideally cast, should
have been equally amazing.
That it is merely interesting, full
of strong moments (like one in
which he rips up the man
uscript of Women in Love in a
fit of fury provoked by the war
time army's disgraceful treat
ment of his wife) but lacking
unity and progression, is
almost certainly the fault of the
movie and none of his. In as
much as the picture is so vague
and scrambled, McKellen
shouldn't be blamed for
playing just a sketch of D. H.
Lawrence.
Janet Suzman comes off
much better; somehow, much
more of Frieda seems con
tained in each of her scenes.
It's easier to achieve that in
Frieda, who did not change her
moods with lightning rapidity
as her husband did, and who
was not, after all, a great writer
— though there is considerable
evidence that she was a great
woman. Suzman's per
formance is a comic portrait
that has something in it of the
Jewish mother tradition — she
is driven by possessive pride in
the achievements of a younger
husband to whom she is, in a
sense (like all of the women in
Lawrence's life), a maternal fig
ure.
Clothed in outfits that look
like cast-offs from a summer
stock production of Rio Rita,
Suzman is fiercely, poignantly
funny. In her most obstinate
moments, she recalls Dorothy
Tutin's fine portrayal of Sophie
Brzeska in The Savage Messiah
— another woman nursing the
creative spirit of her lover, the
sculptor Gaudier-Brzeska; at
her most sensuous, she might

be playing a close relative of
Masha in Chekhov's Three Sis
ters (a role with which she is
well acquainted.)
Priest of Love is intended, I
think, as a celebration of this
marriage, but only one scene,
which commences with Law
rence's beating Frieda and
ends with the two of then allied
against the intrustion of the
British soldiers, gets at the
strange balance that kept them
together. I can understand why
Miles and Plater wanted to stay
away from Lawrence's child
hood — who needs a remake
of Sons and Lovers, when no
body is likely to improve on

Wendy Hitler's and Trevor
Howard's performances as
Lawrence's parents? In fact the
movie would be better off
without even that flashback,
which must baffle anyone who
is unfamiliar with this part of
Lawrence's life. But to dispose
of the early stages of the
Lorenzo-Frieda relationship in
the same way is an even greater
folly than casting Ava Gardner
(who has never looked less hu
man) as a dotty, oversexed mil
lionaress. It makes nonsense of
the Lawrences' romance and
sabotages a biographical tale
that might, for once, have been
terrific movie material.


Look, Ma! No plot!
