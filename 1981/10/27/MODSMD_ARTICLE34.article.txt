# Lining up at the SF Film Festival
## 'Man of Iron' 
### Jiri Weiss 
Andrzej Wajda's new film
Man of Iron, featured at the
San Francisco International
Film Festival this year, is per
haps the most daring film to
come out of Eastern Europe in
recent years.
Man of Iron is a historical
document that combines both
fiction and documentary foot
age — including shots of tanks
firing on demonstrators in the
1970 riots — in a surprisingly
clear vision of the tumultuous
events that have taken place in
Poland in the past year. The
film is full of the kind of op
! timism and euphoria created
by the victories of the inde
: pendent labor union Solidarity
— the film seems to say that in
spite of the economic hard
[ ships everyone has to endure.
' In a united Poland, everything
I is possible.
That this film itself was pos
! sible testifies to just how far the
situation in Poland is out of the
hands of the Communist party.
The party is shown as an
isolated group of arrogant and
t] morally corrupt few who enjoy
? special privileges but are left
i behind by the fast pace of
I change. The party cannot even
! assure itself an adequate supp
' ly of vodka — an urgent neces
| sity to calm nerves — when
worker committees in Gdansk
impose a ban. A local party
boss has to keep his stash hid
den away in a double bass con
verted for the purpose. But
perhaps it is too easy to blame,
as Wajda does, all of Poland's
economic ills on the privileged
few, however corrupt they may
be.
It is possible that Man of Iron
simply fell through the cracks
and will not be shown in its cur
rent form in Poland. The film
was finished at a frantic pace in
May and was scheduled for in
spection at the censor five days
before it was due at the Cannes
International Film Festival
where the film received, in ad
dition to a standing ovation,
the "Golden Palm" award — 23
years after Wajda's film Kanal
received the "Silver Palm."
The character that holds this
complex film together is a very
edgy radio news reporter,
Winkiel, on a mission to dis
credit one of the leaders of Sol
idarity at the Gdansk shipyards.
Winkiel is a rat fresh out of the
Party sewer. He is a drunkard
with a bad conscience, who
sweats and fidgets throughout
the film calming down only
when he has had couple of
glasses of vodka.
Winkiel is a coward. He had
been sympathetic to the work

er movement in 1970 but has
been blackmailed into a state
of fear by his Party bosses. He
has no courage to join "the
other side," — as Solidarity is
referred to by the Party — until
it is too late. Winkiel only man
ages to drag his feet, begging
his employers for more time to
accomplish his onerous task, as
he gets drawn right into the
center of the Solidarity move
ment at the shipyards.
The film is a glorification of
Solidarity at times bordering
on propaganda: Winkiel is so
unsympathetic that he be
comes a caricature — a stere
otype ol a man who has no
moral standing because he has
betrayed his people. Winkiel's
repulsiveness could be the
fault of Marian Opania, who
portrays him, but the charac
terization is probably intended
on Wajda's part.
In contrast there are the un
blemished leaders of Solidarity
including the good natured
father figure of Lech Walesa,
the leader of Solidarity, who
appears not only in the
documentary sequences that
are interspersed throughout
this film but also plays himself.
In Man of Iron we get a his
torical perspective on the
workers movement since the
sixties. In a series of flashbacks,

we see Mateusz Birkut, a work
er in the Gdansk ship yards
scolding his son, Tomczyk, for
participating in the student
demonstrations of 1968 — the
workers refused to join the stu
dents then,but in 1970 it was
their turn.
The 1970 unrests were on a
much larger scale and included
the looting of special govern
ment shops stocked with food
stuffs that were and still are in
such short supply — this time it
was the students and intellec
tuals that stayed out. The army
was called in and some workers

were killed, Mateusz Birkut
among them.
The Polish Communist Party
has until recently succeeded in
dividing the country, pitting in
tellectuals, students and work
ers against each other in the
times of unrest. The film makes
clear that this is true no longer.
It is on the day of his father's
death that the young Tomczyk
decides to quit the university
and work in the docks as his
father has done. His reason is
simple: a worker is much more
able to fight the government —
in a worker's state he has much
less to lose than a journalist or a
film maker who can be sacked
anytime. This is precisely what
happens in the film.
Man of Iron is actually a se
quel to Wajda's earlier Man of
Marble, made ten years ago.
The earlier film dealt with the
efforts of Agnieszka, a young
student in television, to dis
cover what had happened with
Mateusz Birkut, who was a
worker hero during the
Stalinist era. Mateusz ended up
in disrepute and the marble
statue that had been erected in
his honor was confined to
gather dust in a museum
storage room. In her search
Agnieszka learns the details of
Mateusz' death from Tomczyk

but her boss loses interest in
the project when he finds out
how Mateusz died. Agnieszka
refuses to abandon the film be
cause she is committed to tell
Mateusz' story the whole
country and after a showdown
with her boss she finds herself
without a job.
It was this, the last sequence
of Man of Marble, that was
censored and this is where,
chronologically at least, Man of
Iron begins. Ten years later
Agnieszka — overacted at
times by Krystyna Janda — is
married to Tomczyk and con

sequently held under arrest by
the state which does not know
quite what to do with her.
To drive Wajda's point
home, Agnieszka's and
Tomczyk's wedding, which is
shown as a flashback, has Lech
Walesa and Anna Walen
tynowicz (whose firing trig
gered last year's strike) as wit
nesses.
Wajda told a French reporter
recently: "History intruded
into my film," — referring to
the censored sections which
ironically appear in Man of
Iron — "so I felt obliged, and
simultaneously entitled to pro
duce Man of Iron.
"It is the most difficult film I
have made up to now. The
events are so close to us. There
is no time between events such
as we had when we produced
the Man of Marble. But I
wanted to show what hap
pened in Poland in the last
months. I consider those
events of historical signifi
cance. For us Poles they are of
the utmost importance. We are
united, and perhaps this is the
reason for our success. .
Wajda has said that Man of
Iron is his first optimistic film.
"The last scene, when the gate
of the shipyard is opened and
the workers leave after a vic
torious strike, signifies great

social changes in which we all
invest such great hopes. We
want to believe that our soli
darity and an organized work
ers' movement for reforms will
be a guarantee that the old de
fects of the system will not be
repeated again."
Poles have managed to get
this far, a Czech friend told me
recently, because their exag
gerated sense of nationalism
and their religious faith unites
them — something which oth
er Eastern European nations
lack — but they have not yet
won.

"No need to be envious, friends. We will produce 'Man
of Rubber'
Andrzej Wajda's new film
Man of Iron, featured at the
San Francisco International
Film Festival this year, is per
haps the most daring film to
come out of Eastern Europe in
recent years.
Man of Iron is a historical
document that combines both
fiction and documentary foot
age — including shots of tanks
firing on demonstrators in the
1970 riots — in a surprisingly
clear vision of the tumultuous
events that have taken place in
Poland in the past year. The
film is full of the kind of op
! timism and euphoria created
by the victories of the inde
: pendent labor union Solidarity
— the film seems to say that in
spite of the economic hard
[ ships everyone has to endure.
' In a united Poland, everything
I is possible.
That this film itself was pos
! sible testifies to just how far the
situation in Poland is out of the
hands of the Communist party.
The party is shown as an
isolated group of arrogant and
t] morally corrupt few who enjoy
? special privileges but are left
i behind by the fast pace of
I change. The party cannot even
! assure itself an adequate supp
' ly of vodka — an urgent neces
| sity to calm nerves — when
worker committees in Gdansk
impose a ban. A local party
boss has to keep his stash hid
den away in a double bass con
verted for the purpose. But
perhaps it is too easy to blame,
as Wajda does, all of Poland's
economic ills on the privileged
few, however corrupt they may
be.
It is possible that Man of Iron
simply fell through the cracks
and will not be shown in its cur
rent form in Poland. The film
was finished at a frantic pace in
May and was scheduled for in
spection at the censor five days
before it was due at the Cannes
International Film Festival
where the film received, in ad
dition to a standing ovation,
the "Golden Palm" award — 23
years after Wajda's film Kanal
received the "Silver Palm."
The character that holds this
complex film together is a very
edgy radio news reporter,
Winkiel, on a mission to dis
credit one of the leaders of Sol
idarity at the Gdansk shipyards.
Winkiel is a rat fresh out of the
Party sewer. He is a drunkard
with a bad conscience, who
sweats and fidgets throughout
the film calming down only
when he has had couple of
glasses of vodka.
Winkiel is a coward. He had
been sympathetic to the work

er movement in 1970 but has
been blackmailed into a state
of fear by his Party bosses. He
has no courage to join "the
other side," — as Solidarity is
referred to by the Party — until
it is too late. Winkiel only man
ages to drag his feet, begging
his employers for more time to
accomplish his onerous task, as
he gets drawn right into the
center of the Solidarity move
ment at the shipyards.
The film is a glorification of
Solidarity at times bordering
on propaganda: Winkiel is so
unsympathetic that he be
comes a caricature — a stere
otype ol a man who has no
moral standing because he has
betrayed his people. Winkiel's
repulsiveness could be the
fault of Marian Opania, who
portrays him, but the charac
terization is probably intended
on Wajda's part.
In contrast there are the un
blemished leaders of Solidarity
including the good natured
father figure of Lech Walesa,
the leader of Solidarity, who
appears not only in the
documentary sequences that
are interspersed throughout
this film but also plays himself.
In Man of Iron we get a his
torical perspective on the
workers movement since the
sixties. In a series of flashbacks,

we see Mateusz Birkut, a work
er in the Gdansk ship yards
scolding his son, Tomczyk, for
participating in the student
demonstrations of 1968 — the
workers refused to join the stu
dents then,but in 1970 it was
their turn.
The 1970 unrests were on a
much larger scale and included
the looting of special govern
ment shops stocked with food
stuffs that were and still are in
such short supply — this time it
was the students and intellec
tuals that stayed out. The army
was called in and some workers

were killed, Mateusz Birkut
among them.
The Polish Communist Party
has until recently succeeded in
dividing the country, pitting in
tellectuals, students and work
ers against each other in the
times of unrest. The film makes
clear that this is true no longer.
It is on the day of his father's
death that the young Tomczyk
decides to quit the university
and work in the docks as his
father has done. His reason is
simple: a worker is much more
able to fight the government —
in a worker's state he has much
less to lose than a journalist or a
film maker who can be sacked
anytime. This is precisely what
happens in the film.
Man of Iron is actually a se
quel to Wajda's earlier Man of
Marble, made ten years ago.
The earlier film dealt with the
efforts of Agnieszka, a young
student in television, to dis
cover what had happened with
Mateusz Birkut, who was a
worker hero during the
Stalinist era. Mateusz ended up
in disrepute and the marble
statue that had been erected in
his honor was confined to
gather dust in a museum
storage room. In her search
Agnieszka learns the details of
Mateusz' death from Tomczyk

but her boss loses interest in
the project when he finds out
how Mateusz died. Agnieszka
refuses to abandon the film be
cause she is committed to tell
Mateusz' story the whole
country and after a showdown
with her boss she finds herself
without a job.
It was this, the last sequence
of Man of Marble, that was
censored and this is where,
chronologically at least, Man of
Iron begins. Ten years later
Agnieszka — overacted at
times by Krystyna Janda — is
married to Tomczyk and con

sequently held under arrest by
the state which does not know
quite what to do with her.
To drive Wajda's point
home, Agnieszka's and
Tomczyk's wedding, which is
shown as a flashback, has Lech
Walesa and Anna Walen
tynowicz (whose firing trig
gered last year's strike) as wit
nesses.
Wajda told a French reporter
recently: "History intruded
into my film," — referring to
the censored sections which
ironically appear in Man of
Iron — "so I felt obliged, and
simultaneously entitled to pro
duce Man of Iron.
"It is the most difficult film I
have made up to now. The
events are so close to us. There
is no time between events such
as we had when we produced
the Man of Marble. But I
wanted to show what hap
pened in Poland in the last
months. I consider those
events of historical signifi
cance. For us Poles they are of
the utmost importance. We are
united, and perhaps this is the
reason for our success. .
Wajda has said that Man of
Iron is his first optimistic film.
"The last scene, when the gate
of the shipyard is opened and
the workers leave after a vic
torious strike, signifies great

social changes in which we all
invest such great hopes. We
want to believe that our soli
darity and an organized work
ers' movement for reforms will
be a guarantee that the old de
fects of the system will not be
repeated again."

Andrzej Wajda's new film
Man of Iron, featured at the
San Francisco International
Film Festival this year, is per
haps the most daring film to
come out of Eastern Europe in
recent years.
Man of Iron is a historical
document that combines both
fiction and documentary foot
age — including shots of tanks
firing on demonstrators in the
1970 riots — in a surprisingly
clear vision of the tumultuous
events that have taken place in
Poland in the past year. The
film is full of the kind of op
! timism and euphoria created
by the victories of the inde
: pendent labor union Solidarity
— the film seems to say that in
spite of the economic hard
[ ships everyone has to endure.
' In a united Poland, everything
I is possible.
That this film itself was pos
! sible testifies to just how far the
situation in Poland is out of the
hands of the Communist party.
The party is shown as an
isolated group of arrogant and
t] morally corrupt few who enjoy
? special privileges but are left
i behind by the fast pace of
I change. The party cannot even
! assure itself an adequate supp
' ly of vodka — an urgent neces
| sity to calm nerves — when
worker committees in Gdansk
impose a ban. A local party
boss has to keep his stash hid
den away in a double bass con
verted for the purpose. But
perhaps it is too easy to blame,
as Wajda does, all of Poland's
economic ills on the privileged
few, however corrupt they may
be.
It is possible that Man of Iron
simply fell through the cracks
and will not be shown in its cur
rent form in Poland. The film
was finished at a frantic pace in
May and was scheduled for in
spection at the censor five days
before it was due at the Cannes
International Film Festival
where the film received, in ad
dition to a standing ovation,
the "Golden Palm" award — 23
years after Wajda's film Kanal
received the "Silver Palm."
The character that holds this
complex film together is a very
edgy radio news reporter,
Winkiel, on a mission to dis
credit one of the leaders of Sol
idarity at the Gdansk shipyards.
Winkiel is a rat fresh out of the
Party sewer. He is a drunkard
with a bad conscience, who
sweats and fidgets throughout
the film calming down only
when he has had couple of
glasses of vodka.
Winkiel is a coward. He had
been sympathetic to the work

er movement in 1970 but has
been blackmailed into a state
of fear by his Party bosses. He
has no courage to join "the
other side," — as Solidarity is
referred to by the Party — until
it is too late. Winkiel only man
ages to drag his feet, begging
his employers for more time to
accomplish his onerous task, as
he gets drawn right into the
center of the Solidarity move
ment at the shipyards.
The film is a glorification of
Solidarity at times bordering
on propaganda: Winkiel is so
unsympathetic that he be
comes a caricature — a stere
otype ol a man who has no
moral standing because he has
betrayed his people. Winkiel's
repulsiveness could be the
fault of Marian Opania, who
portrays him, but the charac
terization is probably intended
on Wajda's part.
In contrast there are the un
blemished leaders of Solidarity
including the good natured
father figure of Lech Walesa,
the leader of Solidarity, who
appears not only in the
documentary sequences that
are interspersed throughout
this film but also plays himself.
In Man of Iron we get a his
torical perspective on the
workers movement since the
sixties. In a series of flashbacks,

we see Mateusz Birkut, a work
er in the Gdansk ship yards
scolding his son, Tomczyk, for
participating in the student
demonstrations of 1968 — the
workers refused to join the stu
dents then,but in 1970 it was
their turn.
The 1970 unrests were on a
much larger scale and included
the looting of special govern
ment shops stocked with food
stuffs that were and still are in
such short supply — this time it
was the students and intellec
tuals that stayed out. The army
was called in and some workers

were killed, Mateusz Birkut
among them.
The Polish Communist Party
has until recently succeeded in
dividing the country, pitting in
tellectuals, students and work
ers against each other in the
times of unrest. The film makes
clear that this is true no longer.
It is on the day of his father's
death that the young Tomczyk
decides to quit the university
and work in the docks as his
father has done. His reason is
simple: a worker is much more
able to fight the government —
in a worker's state he has much
less to lose than a journalist or a
film maker who can be sacked
anytime. This is precisely what
happens in the film.
Man of Iron is actually a se
quel to Wajda's earlier Man of
Marble, made ten years ago.
The earlier film dealt with the
efforts of Agnieszka, a young
student in television, to dis
cover what had happened with
Mateusz Birkut, who was a
worker hero during the
Stalinist era. Mateusz ended up
in disrepute and the marble
statue that had been erected in
his honor was confined to
gather dust in a museum
storage room. In her search
Agnieszka learns the details of
Mateusz' death from Tomczyk

but her boss loses interest in
the project when he finds out
how Mateusz died. Agnieszka
refuses to abandon the film be
cause she is committed to tell
Mateusz' story the whole
country and after a showdown
with her boss she finds herself
without a job.
It was this, the last sequence
of Man of Marble, that was
censored and this is where,
chronologically at least, Man of
Iron begins. Ten years later
Agnieszka — overacted at
times by Krystyna Janda — is
married to Tomczyk and con

sequently held under arrest by
the state which does not know
quite what to do with her.
To drive Wajda's point
home, Agnieszka's and
Tomczyk's wedding, which is
shown as a flashback, has Lech
Walesa and Anna Walen
tynowicz (whose firing trig
gered last year's strike) as wit
nesses.
Wajda told a French reporter
recently: "History intruded
into my film," — referring to
the censored sections which
ironically appear in Man of
Iron — "so I felt obliged, and
simultaneously entitled to pro
duce Man of Iron.
"It is the most difficult film I
have made up to now. The
events are so close to us. There
is no time between events such
as we had when we produced
the Man of Marble. But I
wanted to show what hap
pened in Poland in the last
months. I consider those
events of historical signifi
cance. For us Poles they are of
the utmost importance. We are
united, and perhaps this is the
reason for our success. .
