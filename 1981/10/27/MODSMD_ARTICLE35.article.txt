# 'Southern Comfort' unsettling
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The ads for Walter Hill's nightmarish
Southern Comfort indicate a simple vari
ation on Deliverance, centered on the vic
timization of a troup of National Guardsmen
who have lost their way in the Bayou region
of Louisiana. Certainly the two films are ge
nerically related, but Southern Comfort —
easily the most interesting of the current
crop of movies — has a broader focus.
Hill, who seems to have abandoned the
kind of fantasy that turns on choreographed
violence (Hard Times, The Warriors), has
concerned himself, in parts of The Long
Riders and in this new film, with the nature
of violence. The ambush sequence in The
Long Riders, shot in agonizing slow motion
so that it seemed apocalyptic, examined the
shock of physical pain: the shattering of the
outlaws, so close and yet so stylized, recalled
the end of Bonnie and Clyde and the begin
ning of The Wild Bunch, in which the myth
of the invincible hero was smashed forever.
Southern Comfort is about the causes and
consequences of violence, which, according
to Hill, Richard Kane and David Giler, who
collaborated with him on the script, are syn
onymous.
A National Guard unit has been sent into
the Bayou swamps on war games; they steal
some canoes in an effort to backtrack, as
speedily as possible, when they can no long
er interpret their map. The Cajun owners of
the vessels return just as the guardsmen are
crossing the river, Stuckey (Lewis Smith),
"shoots" a volley of blanks at the Cajuns,
who respond with real gunfire that kills the
sergeant, Poole (Peter Coyote). The unit be
gins to fall apart, quarrelling among them
selves about where the blame lies. Never a
unified group to start with — these are not
soldiers — they are noyv eight men whose
only common bond is tfie increasing panic
and paranoia they feel as it becomes ap
parent that they lack leadership and that the
violence has not ended with Poole's death —
that, indeed, the Cajuns are determined to
eliminate all of them.
That this growing sense of danger and
helplessness manifests itself differently in
each man and that the internal struggles of
the group imperil them as much as trie ag
gression of the locals, are the subject of the
movie. Watching one man, Bowdoin (Carlos
Brown) painting a red cross on his chest and
decimating the shack of the first Cajun
(Brion Jones) they come across after Poole's
death, or another, Reece (Fred Ward), nearly
drowning this newly acquired prisoner in a
furious attempt to make him talk, one can
understand the frightening behavior of
hastily gathered armed authorities in highly

charged crowd situations; on one level,
Southern Comfort, which is set in 1973, ad
dresses the issues of the 1968 Chicago Con
vention riots and Kent State. In the most dis
turbing scene, the most rational of the men,
the chemical engineer Hardin (Powers
Boothe), fights and kills Reece, and after
wards sits, stunned, unable to comprehend
what led him to this action.
We can't explain it, either — at least, not in
a logical manner. It has something to do with
the pressure built up during the preceding
events, and the Cajun in the background,
yelling murderous encouragement in
Dastard English, and the weird, other-world
ly atmosphere. (The extraordinarily creative
photographer, Andrew Laszlo, who worked
with Hill on The Warriors, has shot this pic
ture in frosted, ghostly greens — greens so
consumed with fog that they look almost
blue — and the photography gets more and
more abstract as the film goes on.) It's the
eeriest violence I've seen in a movie since
the kung fu battle at the docks in Sam
Peckinpah's The Killer Elite.
On another level, of course, Southern
Comfort is a survival adventure, like De
liverance, and as a piece of craftmanship it is
impeccable. The initial scenes are banal, but
later on you realize that their ordinariness is
part of the construction: Hill catches you off
guard when the gun shots switch the tone of
the film. From the moment the men become
conscious of the intentions of the Cajuns a
brilliant reversal scene in which the baying
of approaching hunting dogs holds out the
promise of help on its way and then the dogs
appear, without their masters, and attack the
men — Hill and the editor, Freeman Davies,
clamp the film in a vise and keep tightening
it. As long as we remain in the woods, we
never see the attackers — only their handi
work, a series of traps, each one more terrify
ing than the last. Only one of the climaxes
disappointed me: Stuckey runs off alone, so
his death is predictable by unimaginative old
horror picture patterns, and since he simply
falls prey to a nature danger — quicksand —
it seems gratuitous.
Hill still has a lot to learn about directing
actors. You don't mix the characters up, but
for the most part we are given only the most
superficial kind of psychological detail,
which may account for the fact that Bow
doin's aberrant behavior doesn't really ring
true. This film is light years away from The
Warriors, yet one still finds traces of those
odd, automaton-like exchanges in the group
scenes. Hill doesn't always gauge the per
formers' abilities with accuracy, either —
Franklyn Seales (he played the more timid of

the two killers in The Onion Field) is not the
sort of actor who should be allowed a crying
fit at gunpoint.
Happily, there are good performers —
Powers Boothe (Jim Jones in the TV Guyana
Tragedy), an economical actor who prac
tically hypnotizes the camera, Keith Car
radine as Spencer, the cynic, T.K. Carter as
Cribbs, the spacey black dope dealer who
meets his end far too early, Lewis Smith, and
Les Lannom as Casper, Poole's ineffectual
second-in-command (though his per
formance leans in the direction of
caricature). Carradine, whose last role was
Jim Younger in Hill's The Long Riders, per
forms well, but one may have reservations
about him: Hill probably shouldn't have let
him freeze that amazing face in a grimace for
so much of the picture.
The most exciting section of Southern
Comfort is framed by the arrival of the
hounds and the arrival of a Cajun couple
who take Hardin and Spencer out of the
woods to a nearby town where a dance is
being held. Once the men actually confront
their adversaries head on, the movie loses
some of its mystery — and some of its sub
stance, too, since we are no longer dealing
with the effects of a hostile and very much
advantaged force (the Cajuns are fighting on
their own turf, after all, with their own weap
ons) on the morale of a band of men. How
ever, the last scenes have their own distinc
tion. We see the Cajuns at their most relaxed
— in celebration — but we can't shake off
the feeling of alienation. That's because, like
Hardin and Spencer, we don't belong, and
Hill refuses to open up in the movie, as he
might easily have done, to give us a picture
of ethnic warmth — in other words, he re
fuses to sentimentalize. And Ry Cooder,
whose superb score has been slightly disso
nant — off-putting — all along, gives the
town fiddler a plaintive tune to sing that
heightens our sense of uncomfortable re
moteness from these people.
Throughout the movie, our response to
the Cajuns is ambivalent. Though our sympa
thies lie with the trapped guardsmen, Hill
doesn't let us forget whose stupidity trig
gered the siege, and we can't applaud the re
venge two of the men take on the first (and
probably innocent) Cajun they run into. The
men don't imagine what the owners of the
canoes must have felt when Stuckey opened
fire on them — even though it wasn't real fire
— or how the intrusion of these strangers
might have affected them; but we do. You
don't realize until the movie has ended how
precarious a balance Hill has maintained.
Southern Comfort is a movie that expands in
retrospect.
