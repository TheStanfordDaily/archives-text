# 'They All Laughed'
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
As a transplanted New
Yorker, it seems incredible that
Peter Bogdanovich could make
such a loving and optimistic
comedy on the streets of the
big rotten apple as They All
Laughed, which premiered at
the Castro Theatre on the last
night of the San Francisco In
ternational Film Festival Satur
day.
In spite of the film's frivolity
and bubbling optimism in the
face of urban decay the film is
unadulterated fun. When peo
ple love each other, as the peo
ple who made this film did,
Bogdanovich explained, ev
erything — even New York City
— seems wonderful.
The film follows the exploits
of the agents of Odyssey De
tective Agency, located in the
chaotic Wall Street area of New
York City. Their motto "We
never sleep" is quite literally
true as the agency specializes
in following women who are
suspected of cheating on their
husbands. Distractions from
the slow pace of the work are
quite common among
Odyssey's agents — much to
the alarm of the agency's boss
Leon Leondopolis (George
Morfogen) who is hardly the
embodiment of the protestant
work ethic himself: he has a lit
tle something going with his
secretary, Amy (Linda
MacEwen).
The biggest playboy among
the agents is John Russo (Ben
Gazzara), who we find at the
beginning of the movie dealing
with his current relationship
with an overbearing but

adorable country and western
singer Christy Miller (Coleen
Camp) and at the same time
dating redhead cabbie "Sam"
(Patti Hansen). Russo is a lucky
man in every respect: he does
not have to approach women,
for they approach him; he
always manages to end up on
good terms with his old con
quests — in spite of the occa
sional outburst. What is even
more amazing is that the wom
en in his life not only know
about each other but are good
friends.
In spite of these pleasant dis
tractions that fill Russo's life, he
remains a lonely man and final
ly falls for an enigmatic middle
aged wife of a tycoon he is fol
lowing: a Mrs. Angela Niotes
(Audrey Hepburn). Almost as
lucky is Russo's associate, the
awkward preppie Charles
Rutledge (John Ritter) whofalls
head over heels in love — quite
literally — with the woman he
is tailing, beautiful blond
Dolores Martin (Dorothy Strat
ten). Charles' first face to face
encounter with the woman
takes place on the floor of a
roller skating rink — Charles
barely knows what a skate
looks like.
At first it seems that Charles
has no chance; Dolores,
besides being married, has a
handsome young Latin, Jose
(.Sean Ferrer), for a boyfriend.
Besides, Charles is shy and is
quite easily bossed around by
Christy, who finds him cute.
Christy does what she wants
with Charles — he just cannot
bring himself to protest.
Luckily, I guess, this film has a
happy end as all of the agents
blow their covers in amorous
pursuit. Jose as it turns out is
just wild about Christy, much

to Charles' relief, so Charles
manages .to have Dolores to
himself. The only people who
are left out in the cold, it seems,
are Russo, when Angela leaves
him, and Arthur (Blaine Novak)
the hippy companion of
Charles, who is haunted by the
images of women who are after
his throat.
They All Laughed is a very
funny film with some wonder
ful gags. Novak and Ritter
make a Laurel and Hardy pair.
Ritter complements with 60's
"coolness" — complete with
dark glasses and a joint — what
Novak achieves with his
clumsiness — he is constantly
tripping over himself, especial
ly when Dolores is in signt.
The film is a family movie,
not solely for its PG rating: it
was made by the Bogdanovich
family of friends that include
his two daughters.
Bogdanovich shot the film en
tirely on the streets of New
York with a hand held camera
hidden by a group of extras.
Many of the scenes in the
film had no dialogue written
ahead of time — Bogdanovich
is a believer in spontaneity —
and he often relied on single
takes. During one scene, for
example, Arthur skates across
Fifth Avenue in hot pursuit of
Angela — holding the rush
hour traffic was a one time af
fair. Nor were extras used by
Bogdanovich, so when Arthur
bumps into passersby. they are
unwilling victims. In one scene,
John Ritter recalled, he ran into
a revolving door pushing out a
woman with shopping bags.
"The woman was furious," Rit
ter said, but when he told her
that it was all for a movie he was
in she star.ted to apologize pro
fusely.

encounter with the woman
takes place on the floor of a
roller skating rink — Charles
barely knows what a skate
looks like.
At first it seems that Charles
has no chance; Dolores,
besides being married, has a
handsome young Latin, Jose
(.Sean Ferrer), for a boyfriend.
Besides, Charles is shy and is
quite easily bossed around by
Christy, who finds him cute.
Christy does what she wants
with Charles — he just cannot
bring himself to protest.
Luckily, I guess, this film has a
happy end as all of the agents
blow their covers in amorous
pursuit. Jose as it turns out is
just wild about Christy, much

to Charles' relief, so Charles
manages .to have Dolores to
himself. The only people who
are left out in the cold, it seems,
are Russo, when Angela leaves
him, and Arthur (Blaine Novak)
the hippy companion of
Charles, who is haunted by the
images of women who are after
his throat.
They All Laughed is a very
funny film with some wonder
ful gags. Novak and Ritter
make a Laurel and Hardy pair.
Ritter complements with 60's
"coolness" — complete with
dark glasses and a joint — what
Novak achieves with his
clumsiness — he is constantly
tripping over himself, especial
ly when Dolores is in signt.
The film is a family movie,
not solely for its PG rating: it
was made by the Bogdanovich
family of friends that include
his two daughters.
Bogdanovich shot the film en
tirely on the streets of New
York with a hand held camera
hidden by a group of extras.
Many of the scenes in the
film had no dialogue written
ahead of time — Bogdanovich
is a believer in spontaneity —
and he often relied on single
takes. During one scene, for
example, Arthur skates across
Fifth Avenue in hot pursuit of
Angela — holding the rush
hour traffic was a one time af
fair. Nor were extras used by
Bogdanovich, so when Arthur
bumps into passersby. they are
unwilling victims. In one scene,
John Ritter recalled, he ran into
a revolving door pushing out a
woman with shopping bags.
"The woman was furious," Rit
ter said, but when he told her
that it was all for a movie he was
in she star.ted to apologize pro
fusely.


The cast of 'They All Laughed'
As a transplanted New
Yorker, it seems incredible that
Peter Bogdanovich could make
such a loving and optimistic
comedy on the streets of the
big rotten apple as They All
Laughed, which premiered at
the Castro Theatre on the last
night of the San Francisco In
ternational Film Festival Satur
day.
In spite of the film's frivolity
and bubbling optimism in the
face of urban decay the film is
unadulterated fun. When peo
ple love each other, as the peo
ple who made this film did,
Bogdanovich explained, ev
erything — even New York City
— seems wonderful.
The film follows the exploits
of the agents of Odyssey De
tective Agency, located in the
chaotic Wall Street area of New
York City. Their motto "We
never sleep" is quite literally
true as the agency specializes
in following women who are
suspected of cheating on their
husbands. Distractions from
the slow pace of the work are
quite common among
Odyssey's agents — much to
the alarm of the agency's boss
Leon Leondopolis (George
Morfogen) who is hardly the
embodiment of the protestant
work ethic himself: he has a lit
tle something going with his
secretary, Amy (Linda
MacEwen).
The biggest playboy among
the agents is John Russo (Ben
Gazzara), who we find at the
beginning of the movie dealing
with his current relationship
with an overbearing but

adorable country and western
singer Christy Miller (Coleen
Camp) and at the same time
dating redhead cabbie "Sam"
(Patti Hansen). Russo is a lucky
man in every respect: he does
not have to approach women,
for they approach him; he
always manages to end up on
good terms with his old con
quests — in spite of the occa
sional outburst. What is even
more amazing is that the wom
en in his life not only know
about each other but are good
friends.
In spite of these pleasant dis
tractions that fill Russo's life, he
remains a lonely man and final
ly falls for an enigmatic middle
aged wife of a tycoon he is fol
lowing: a Mrs. Angela Niotes
(Audrey Hepburn). Almost as
lucky is Russo's associate, the
awkward preppie Charles
Rutledge (John Ritter) whofalls
head over heels in love — quite
literally — with the woman he
is tailing, beautiful blond
Dolores Martin (Dorothy Strat
ten). Charles' first face to face
encounter with the woman
takes place on the floor of a
roller skating rink — Charles
barely knows what a skate
looks like.
