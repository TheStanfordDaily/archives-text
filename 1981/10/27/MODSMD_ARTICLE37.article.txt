# Seger rocks â€” as usual

### Stefan Malmoli Bob Seger Nine Tonight Capitol Records 
In 1975, Bob Seger put out his first live
album, Live Bullet. This album consisted
of some great Detroit-based rock and roll
and showed how overlooked his early
material had been. The minor success of
Live Bullet, led immediately to the over
whelming triumph of Night Moves. This
album brought Seger and his Silver Bullet
Band national acclaim and platinum sales
status. His follow-up records Stranger in
Town and Against the Wind and his hot
tours only added to his commercial and
critical acceptance and put him at the top
of the charts.

Accordingly, his new double live
album, Nine Tonight, is a typically excit
ing high energy Bob Seger set. Recorded
in Detroit and Boston on his last tour in
June and October of 1980, this album con
tains the best of his material from the last
six years. Above all though, this album
doesn't disappoint. Seger and his band
excel on almost every cut and they im
prove on the versions on many of the stu
dio tracks.
The first thing one will notice about this
album is the clarity of the mix. There is an
excellent interplay of the music and the
crowd that doesn't interfere with the rec
ord listener's pleasure. Also, it is a low
mix, which is just tempting you to turn
that volume knob up a few notches.
In choosing the material for this album,
Seger decided on including a wide variety
of material, ranging from the tough rock
stance of "Feel Like a Number" to the
gentle ballad "You'll Accompany Me". In
between, we get some boogie-down
rhythm and blues numbers like the old
Memphis number "Tryin' to Live My Life
Without You" and just some good old

time rock and roll (as in the appropriately
titled "Old Time Rock and Roll").
The musicianship on the album is in ex
cellent form. Seger sounds as good live as
on record (if not better), and the band
adds a much tighter and gutsier sound
than in the studio. This harder sound adds
a new punch into much of the material
and improves many of the original ver
sions. The Agoinst the Wind material ben
efits the most from this new punch, espe
cially on "Betty Lou's Getting Out To
night" and "Her Strut".
This new punch can be accounted for
by the overall performance of the Silver
Bullet Band. The Chuck Berry derived
guitar chords figure perfectly with the
prominent bass playing of Chris

Campbell (check out "Hollywood
Nights" to see what I mean). But the real
tight and raw sound is brought together
by the saxophone virtuoso Alto Reed. His
sax playing is clean and cutting, and noth
ing short of exciting. His range of
switching styles of playing to accomodate
diferent types of songs is incredible. He
adds a new slow bluesy sax on "Main
street" and then blows his guts out on
"Let It Rock". Also, as a sign of his show
manship, he palys both alto and tenor sax
at the same time on a few numbers.
This record brings together all theexcit
ing qualities of rock and roll. It's fun, dan
ceable, hard and mean all at the same
time. )ust listening to the final and best
cut, the eight-minute "Let It Rock" shows
what rock isall about. This song cooks like
the Stones did this last weekend. It
doesn't try to be pretentious or claim to
be anything that it's not. It just rocks non
stop and that's it. No questions asked. Not
only is Nine Tonight a must for every Bob
Seger fan, but it is a must for anyone who
feels that rock has lost its original excite
ment.
