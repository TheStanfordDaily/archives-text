# Conflicts of interest hard to define, detect

Pinpointing specific instances of
conflict of interest among University
employees is like trying to find a
chameleon in the desert; University
policy is structured to protect pro
fessors and researchers in the name
of "privacy" and "pursuit of a liberal
education."
Professors and other officials of the
University quickly point out that con
flict of interest is an issue that is hard
to define and even harder to
traceamong faculty and researchers
here. While many speculate that
there are areas within the University
where such conflict is occurring,
there is noway under University poli
cy to ascertain conflicts without a
professor specifically volunteering
the information.
The potential for conflict is con
sidered to be limited primarily to the
hard sciences, mainly because of the
nature of the research and the large
amount of outside consulting pro
fessors do in these subjects.
"I can't give you data regarding the
number of professors who might be
involved in a conflict of interest, be
cause we don't ask for any," Vice
Provost Gerald Lieberman said.
"Very few have been brought to my
attention."
One of the few acknowl
edgements of a professor's involve
ment in a conflict of interest oc
curred in 1976, when renowned Stan
ford researcher Leonard Hayflick re
signed due to allegations that he
used University facilities while doing
tests for other researchers. It was also
alleged that he used some $9500 in
disputed fees that had gone into his
own bank account.
The Hayflick case illustrates what
several departments fear may be
happening, but they have no way of
knowing.
Conflict of interest is most often
thought of in terms of University pro
fessors having a financial interest in a
company they are doing research for
or using University facilities and time
to do outside, personal consulting.
One of the specific areas of the
University which concern adminis
trators because of its potential for this
type of conflict of interest is genetic
engineering.
Dr. Kenneth Melmon, a professor
at the Medical School here, said he
feels the problem is the close link be
tween the academic value of genetic

engineering and the commercial
gain to be made from any innova
tions in this field.
"Yet genetics knows they're in the
spotlight, and so they keep their rec
ords clean and deal straightforwardly
with the University," he said.
"In the the field of genetic engi
neering, people feel they have a level
of expertise at the University which
doesn't exist in private industry," said
Jon Claerbout of the geophysics de
partment, a member of this year's
Committee on Research. "Yet this
was true in engineering about 30
years ago. If there's a lot of money in
it, it will eventually get out to private
industry."

Another area, according to
Lieberman and others, where there is
a large potential for this sort of con
flict of interest is in the computer sci
ence field.
Some sources claimed that pro
fessors in the computer science de
partment spend time developing
software programs, which they then
market through companies which
they themselves have established.
"In areas like computer science,
it's particularly easy to do private
work on individual time, because no
body knows what anybody else is
doing," said Claerbout.
Melmon said he felt that legitimate
concerns regarding conflict of in
terest could be lessened if the Uni
versity had a policy whereby the de
partments routinely asked faculty
now much time they were spending
on outside consulting and the nature
of that consulting.
"Even if a person answers 'noth
ing', at least we're making an attempt
to find these thingsout. Itwould help
allay people's fears," he said.
Melmon said he didn't think this
was an invasion of privacy. "Consult
ing is, ultimately, for the sake of the
University," he said. "I don't think it's
an invasion to tell the University what
I'm doing with the time they have
given me to do the consulting."
