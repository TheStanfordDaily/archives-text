■he Yellowjackets, featuring Robben Ford
■ he Old Waldorf
B4 October 1981
[ The Yellowjackets, with the guest ap-
Kearance of Robben Ford, did not sting,
ut rather soothed one's body and soul
■vith their tight, all instrumental
■azz/fujion last Saturday night at the Old
Evaldorf.
[ The Yellowjackets, consisting of song
■vriter Russel Ferrante on keyboards,
ftassist, Jimmy Haslip and drummer Ricky
■.awson, and songwriter/guitarist supreme
»ord performed in the unpretentious
■nanner absent from so many concert
Rands today. They weren't trying to show
pbff their obvious and varied talents, nor
■vere they attempting to prove anything.
»ord and the Yellowjackets played their
■nusic with controlled emotion and near
. perfection. Nothing more, nothing less.
I Their performance was nine songs in
■ength, including all seven cuts from the
■fellowjackets' 1981 album of the same
name.
I To celebrate the occasion, unfortunate
ly, the Waldorf decided to try a new game.
Were are the rules:
I Pieces: A few hundred concert atten
dees, or a capacity crowd, called sardines.
I A large stage on risers where the dance
■oor usually is.
I A night club that serves dinner called the
ft)ld Waldorf. For the purposes of this
Bame, it will be called the sardine can.
■ Object: See how many sardines you can
■t into the sardine can, without using any
of the spacious stages to seat or stand
them. Anything goes.
I Winning: Successfully detracting one's
■ttention from the happenings on stage to
■he aches and pains in one's legs caused by
peeping them in the same place, crammed
- against the chair directly in front of them,
[for upwards of two and a half hours.
Last Saturday, the Waldorf won, and
convincingly at that. There was so

much room on stage between Ford and
Ferrante that they would have had to apply
Ma Bell's "Reach Out and Touch Some
one" theory to converse.
That aside, Ford et al. were spectacular,
except for one small detail. Haslip and
Lawson possess amazing talent, most of
which went untapped during the 80
minute show. Neither musician soloed, as
each kept the jumpy rhythm of the fusion
sound in perpetual motion. Nevertheless,
solos by Haslip and Lawson would have
only rounded out the truly special per
formances by Ferrante and Ford.
Ferrante's solos were crisp, yet fluid and
fit into the scheme of things like the inner
workings of a clock fit together. His slow,
methodical style on some songs was espe
cially pleasing. «ft
Ford stood on the far left of the stage,
segregated from the three Yellowjackets.
If Ferrante, Haslip, and Lawson were New
York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, then
Ford would have been Hawaii. Although
he was not the center attraction, hisexhibi
tion of musical ability was certainly worth
such a distinction. His hands glided over
his guitars with the same precision of a
surgeon and his scalpel. After a missed cue
on their forth song, "Imperial Strut," Ford
played flawlessly for the remainder of tht
concert. £30
The Yellowjackets' show, however, did
contain one major defect in the arrange
ment of songs. They played "Matinee
Idol," probably their best piece, second.
This caused an anti-climactic effect for the
next few pieces until "The Hornet." The
group closed with a magnificent version of
"Priscilla," which starts out slowly and sud
denly jumps into a funky base-line high
lighted by Ford's best solo of the night.
"Rush Hour," another fast moving song,
was the only encore.
The crowd, however, was not as recep
tive as it should have been; there were but
two standing ovations after songs. The
crowd seemed anemic at best as, for one

reason or another, their energy was
drained — although certainly not at the
hands of a no-name "warm-up" band that,
as quite often is the case, was unan
nounced until after everyone had
purchased tickets. This was an obvious
ploy by the Old Waldorf to sell more
drinks and successfully intoxicate the au
dience.
It also seemed that many of those pres
ent were at the Waldorf simply to view a
show, not the show. Very few appeared fa
miliar with the Yellowjackets' most recent
LP, which was released in June. But for
those who came to see Ford and co., they
left satiated, and not stung.^^

■he Yellowjackets, featuring Robben Ford
■ he Old Waldorf
B4 October 1981
[ The Yellowjackets, with the guest ap-
Kearance of Robben Ford, did not sting,
ut rather soothed one's body and soul
■vith their tight, all instrumental
■azz/fujion last Saturday night at the Old
Evaldorf.
[ The Yellowjackets, consisting of song
■vriter Russel Ferrante on keyboards,
ftassist, Jimmy Haslip and drummer Ricky
■.awson, and songwriter/guitarist supreme
»ord performed in the unpretentious
■nanner absent from so many concert
Rands today. They weren't trying to show
pbff their obvious and varied talents, nor
■vere they attempting to prove anything.
»ord and the Yellowjackets played their
■nusic with controlled emotion and near
. perfection. Nothing more, nothing less.
I Their performance was nine songs in
■ength, including all seven cuts from the
■fellowjackets' 1981 album of the same
name.
I To celebrate the occasion, unfortunate
ly, the Waldorf decided to try a new game.
Were are the rules:
I Pieces: A few hundred concert atten
dees, or a capacity crowd, called sardines.
I A large stage on risers where the dance
■oor usually is.
I A night club that serves dinner called the
ft)ld Waldorf. For the purposes of this
Bame, it will be called the sardine can.
■ Object: See how many sardines you can
■t into the sardine can, without using any
of the spacious stages to seat or stand
them. Anything goes.
I Winning: Successfully detracting one's
■ttention from the happenings on stage to
■he aches and pains in one's legs caused by
peeping them in the same place, crammed
- against the chair directly in front of them,
[for upwards of two and a half hours.
Last Saturday, the Waldorf won, and
convincingly at that. There was so

much room on stage between Ford and
Ferrante that they would have had to apply
Ma Bell's "Reach Out and Touch Some
one" theory to converse.
That aside, Ford et al. were spectacular,
except for one small detail. Haslip and
Lawson possess amazing talent, most of
which went untapped during the 80
minute show. Neither musician soloed, as
each kept the jumpy rhythm of the fusion
sound in perpetual motion. Nevertheless,
solos by Haslip and Lawson would have
only rounded out the truly special per
formances by Ferrante and Ford.
Ferrante's solos were crisp, yet fluid and
fit into the scheme of things like the inner
workings of a clock fit together. His slow,
methodical style on some songs was espe
cially pleasing. «ft
Ford stood on the far left of the stage,
segregated from the three Yellowjackets.
If Ferrante, Haslip, and Lawson were New
York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, then
Ford would have been Hawaii. Although
he was not the center attraction, hisexhibi
tion of musical ability was certainly worth
such a distinction. His hands glided over
his guitars with the same precision of a
surgeon and his scalpel. After a missed cue
on their forth song, "Imperial Strut," Ford
played flawlessly for the remainder of tht
concert. £30
The Yellowjackets' show, however, did
contain one major defect in the arrange
ment of songs. They played "Matinee
Idol," probably their best piece, second.
This caused an anti-climactic effect for the
next few pieces until "The Hornet." The
group closed with a magnificent version of
"Priscilla," which starts out slowly and sud
denly jumps into a funky base-line high
lighted by Ford's best solo of the night.
"Rush Hour," another fast moving song,
was the only encore.
The crowd, however, was not as recep
tive as it should have been; there were but
two standing ovations after songs. The
crowd seemed anemic at best as, for one

reason or another, their energy was
drained — although certainly not at the
hands of a no-name "warm-up" band that,
as quite often is the case, was unan
nounced until after everyone had
purchased tickets. This was an obvious
ploy by the Old Waldorf to sell more
drinks and successfully intoxicate the au
dience.
