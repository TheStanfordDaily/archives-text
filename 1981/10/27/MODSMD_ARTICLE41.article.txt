The Mabuhay Gardens
24 October 1981
It was a scene that would have pleased our
old droog Alex; a slamming, diving, squirm
ing horde.of leather-clad punks enjoying the
fine tunes at tf\e Mab.
To our less than enlightened reading au
dience, let me explain. I'm referring to Satur
day's (Oct. 24) show at San Francisco's pre
mier punk club, the Mabuhay Gardens (a.k.a.
Fab Mab), where Saccarine Trust,
the Minutemen, headlining T.5.0.L., and an
equally entertaining audience performed.
Saccarine Trust, a relatively unknown band
from God knows where, kicked off the show.
Plunging into new depths of cacophony, this
band managed to disgust everyone present
with their astounding lack of talent. Even the
more hardcore members of the audience,
who normally demand very little in the way of
musical quality, werethoroughly sickened by
the so-called "songs" the band threw up.
Apart from mentioning that the lead singer
was ugly beyond all comprehension, I won't
waste any more ink on this band.
Next, enter the Minutemen, a name ob
viously derived from the average length of
their songs. Playing to an understandably
sedate crowd, who suffered through the last
band, The Minutemen put on quite a good
show. Their songs were loud, beaty (150-175 a
minute), and very short to say the least. High
lights include a vastly improved rendition of
Van Halen's "Aint Talkin' About Love," con
densed down to about 20 seconds in length.
Also worth mentioning is the obese lead
singer/guitarist who threw his weight around
the entire stage with his graceful and fluid
dance steps.
At this point, the minute dance floor was
packed well with various mean-looking skin
head types, eagerly awaiting theTrue Sons Of
Liberty (T.5.0.L.). From the very moment of
their entrance, T.S.O.L. played with so much
intensity that the Mab was certain to burst

open. Sure enough, all it took was a little in
nocent hand motion by the charasmatic lead
singer to whip the crowd into a frenzy. Im
mediately, the slamming began, with the
tougher members of the audience barrelling
into their neighbors, be they male or female.
Even some of the younger enthusiasts insisted
on repeatedly swan diving from the stage
onto and into the writhing crowd far below.
Moving back to the subject of the band,
T.S.O.L. proved to be a group of original and

Their songs were loud, beaty

vastly talented musicians. The lead singer,
whose gyrations and screams were largely re
sponsible for the audience's enthusiasm, put
on a show Mick Jgger couldn't match if he
tried. All in all, T.S.O.L. appears to be a band
on the rise and is sure to move up from KFJC
to KFRC airplay before the year's end.
After all this, you might still ask, "Why
should I go to the Mab?" Well, the admission
price is relatively cheap (five dollars), there's
a bar and a restaurant, and you're bound to
make some fine new friends. But best of all,
you will never have to watch another Roller
Derby match, Big Time Wrestling bout, or
Three Stooges re-run, when you have all the
violence you could possibly ask for at your
fingertips.

The Mabuhay Gardens
24 October 1981
It was a scene that would have pleased our
old droog Alex; a slamming, diving, squirm
ing horde.of leather-clad punks enjoying the
fine tunes at tf\e Mab.
To our less than enlightened reading au
dience, let me explain. I'm referring to Satur
day's (Oct. 24) show at San Francisco's pre
mier punk club, the Mabuhay Gardens (a.k.a.
Fab Mab), where Saccarine Trust,
the Minutemen, headlining T.5.0.L., and an
equally entertaining audience performed.
Saccarine Trust, a relatively unknown band
from God knows where, kicked off the show.
Plunging into new depths of cacophony, this
band managed to disgust everyone present
with their astounding lack of talent. Even the
more hardcore members of the audience,
who normally demand very little in the way of
musical quality, werethoroughly sickened by
the so-called "songs" the band threw up.
Apart from mentioning that the lead singer
was ugly beyond all comprehension, I won't
waste any more ink on this band.
Next, enter the Minutemen, a name ob
viously derived from the average length of
their songs. Playing to an understandably
sedate crowd, who suffered through the last
band, The Minutemen put on quite a good
show. Their songs were loud, beaty (150-175 a
minute), and very short to say the least. High
lights include a vastly improved rendition of
Van Halen's "Aint Talkin' About Love," con
densed down to about 20 seconds in length.
Also worth mentioning is the obese lead
singer/guitarist who threw his weight around
the entire stage with his graceful and fluid
dance steps.
At this point, the minute dance floor was
packed well with various mean-looking skin
head types, eagerly awaiting theTrue Sons Of
Liberty (T.5.0.L.). From the very moment of
their entrance, T.S.O.L. played with so much
intensity that the Mab was certain to burst

open. Sure enough, all it took was a little in
nocent hand motion by the charasmatic lead
singer to whip the crowd into a frenzy. Im
mediately, the slamming began, with the
tougher members of the audience barrelling
into their neighbors, be they male or female.
Even some of the younger enthusiasts insisted
on repeatedly swan diving from the stage
onto and into the writhing crowd far below.
