Polish army moves to keep peace
Warsaw — Thousands of soldiers fanned out over Poland
yesterday to supervise preparations for winter and "maintain
law and order" as the nation's strike wave surged toward a
new crest.
"The situation in the country is beginning to slip out of
control," the popular Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy said in a
grim, front-page commentary.
With strikes and demonstrations affecting some two-thirds
of Poland's 49 provinces, the mounting protests appeared to
be the most serious since the worker upheaval that spawned
the independent labor federation Solidarity in August 1980.
Communist authorities earlier had sounded dark warnings
of martial law if the labor unrest continued, but the govern
ment's action yesterday was seen, initially, as strictly an eco
nomic measure.
Despite an attempt by Solidarity to defuse local anger over
food shortages and other issues through a one-hour na
tionwide protest scheduled tomorrow, no end was in sight to
the wildcat walkouts.
The troops' assignment seems to be bolstering strong cen
tral authority of the new party chief, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski. He also is premier and defense minister.
Meanwhile, there were reports of army and police patrols
in Konin, the central Polish city where about 65,000 workers
staged a 15-minute warning strike yesterday and were plan
ning a four-hour protest tomorrow.
Showdown vote on AWACS near
Washington -With a climactic Senate vote iust two days
away, President Ronald Reagan launched an all-out blitz on
the opposition yesterday in a bid to rescue his 58.5-billion
arms sale to Saudi Arabia.
Before the day was over, he had picked up one vote and
the opposition had gained one.
Reagan called seven senators to his office yesterday — five
declared opponents and two who were undecided — and
aides said he might talk to a dozen other Senators before the

vote tomorrow afternoon.
He is trying to overcome opposition to the sale of AWACS
radar planes and F-15 jet fighter weaponry, a plan already re
jected by the House by a 301-111 vote.
Sen. William Armstrong (R-Colo.) left the White House
yesterday saying he was still undecided, but announced a
few hours later that he will vote for the sale.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) who also had been uncom
mitted, took to the Senate floor even as the White House
meetings were in progress to say he will vote against the sale.
Yesterday's announcements by Armstrong and Leahy
raised the Senate line-up to 55-38 against the sale according
to the latest Associated Press count.
Opponents must win a majority of the senators present
and voting, 51 if all senators vote, to win approval of a veto
resolution against the sale.
Policeman dies disarming IRA bomb
London — A Scotland Yard explosives expert was killed
yesterday while trying to defuse a bomb planted by IRA
guerrillas in a fast-food restaurant on London's crowded Ox
ford Street, police said.
Another bomb was discovered in a nearby department
store and defused, police said. The Irish Republican Army is
sued a statement in Belfast claiming responsibility for the
bombs.
Earlier yesterday, police in Pontypridd, Wales discovered
and defused a fire bomb planted in a British army re
cruitment office. The office is only a few hundred yards from
the route Prince Charles and Princess Diana will take Thurs
day during their three-day tour of Wales.
Police said they suspected Welsh nationalist extremists of
planting the device, and had increased security around the
the royal newlyweds.
Yesterday's bombing was the third IRA attack in the British
capital since Oct.lo. Tnree people have been killed and 37
wounded in the blitz launched after a the collapse of a 7-
month hunger strike by convicted guerrillas in Northern Ire
land's Maze prison.

COP senators propose tax hikes
Washington — Senate Republicans intend to seek be
tween $50 billion and $70 billion in tax increases over the
next three years as part of their attempt to cut budget deficits
by $115 billion, sources said yesterday.
The sources disclosed the tentative target as Senate Fi
nance Chairman Bob Dole (R-Kan.) confirmed that his panel
would begin drafting a bill to raise taxes early next year.
Dole predicted that Congress would enact the increases,
but he spelled out few details, and did not mention how
much the committee's Republican majority hoped to raise
with its legislation.
But sources have reported that administration and con
gressional officials have drawn up a lengthy list of options,
including higher excise taxes on alcohol, toDacco and gaso
line, an import fee on crude oil and disallowing tax deduc
tions on consumer debt interest, except for home mortgages
and car loans.
Dole said he hoped hearings would start on the bill before
Congress adjourns for the year.
Sources said that no consensus has been reached among
Senate Republicans on which proposals to advance, al
though one official said the least desirable option was to
backtrack on the three-year, income-tax cut.
Market off in moderate trading
New York — Stock prices declined again yesterday in a ses
sion marked by weakness in General Motors and some other
blue-chip issues.
Analysts said concern over heavy federal borrowing
needs, inflation and the recession kept the market on the de
fensive.
Today's weather
Intermittent rain through tomorrow. Lows in the low to
mid 50s. Highs today in the low to mid 60s. Winds southerly
10 to 20 mph. Probability of precipitation 80 percent.

Polish army moves to keep peace
Warsaw — Thousands of soldiers fanned out over Poland
yesterday to supervise preparations for winter and "maintain
law and order" as the nation's strike wave surged toward a
new crest.
"The situation in the country is beginning to slip out of
control," the popular Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy said in a
grim, front-page commentary.
With strikes and demonstrations affecting some two-thirds
of Poland's 49 provinces, the mounting protests appeared to
be the most serious since the worker upheaval that spawned
the independent labor federation Solidarity in August 1980.
Communist authorities earlier had sounded dark warnings
of martial law if the labor unrest continued, but the govern
ment's action yesterday was seen, initially, as strictly an eco
nomic measure.
Despite an attempt by Solidarity to defuse local anger over
food shortages and other issues through a one-hour na
tionwide protest scheduled tomorrow, no end was in sight to
the wildcat walkouts.
The troops' assignment seems to be bolstering strong cen
tral authority of the new party chief, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski. He also is premier and defense minister.
Meanwhile, there were reports of army and police patrols
in Konin, the central Polish city where about 65,000 workers
staged a 15-minute warning strike yesterday and were plan
ning a four-hour protest tomorrow.
Showdown vote on AWACS near
Washington -With a climactic Senate vote iust two days
away, President Ronald Reagan launched an all-out blitz on
the opposition yesterday in a bid to rescue his 58.5-billion
arms sale to Saudi Arabia.
Before the day was over, he had picked up one vote and
the opposition had gained one.
Reagan called seven senators to his office yesterday — five
declared opponents and two who were undecided — and
aides said he might talk to a dozen other Senators before the

vote tomorrow afternoon.
He is trying to overcome opposition to the sale of AWACS
radar planes and F-15 jet fighter weaponry, a plan already re
jected by the House by a 301-111 vote.
Sen. William Armstrong (R-Colo.) left the White House
yesterday saying he was still undecided, but announced a
few hours later that he will vote for the sale.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) who also had been uncom
mitted, took to the Senate floor even as the White House
meetings were in progress to say he will vote against the sale.
Yesterday's announcements by Armstrong and Leahy
raised the Senate line-up to 55-38 against the sale according
to the latest Associated Press count.
Opponents must win a majority of the senators present
and voting, 51 if all senators vote, to win approval of a veto
resolution against the sale.

yesterday while trying to defuse a bomb planted by IRA
guerrillas in a fast-food restaurant on London's crowded Ox
ford Street, police said.

cruitment office. The office is only a few hundred yards from

planting the device, and had increased security around the
the royal newlyweds.

capital since Oct.lo. Tnree people have been killed and 37
wounded in the blitz launched after a the collapse of a 7-
month hunger strike by convicted guerrillas in Northern Ire
land's Maze prison.

COP senators propose tax hikes
Washington — Senate Republicans intend to seek be
tween $50 billion and $70 billion in tax increases over the
next three years as part of their attempt to cut budget deficits
by $115 billion, sources said yesterday.
The sources disclosed the tentative target as Senate Fi
nance Chairman Bob Dole (R-Kan.) confirmed that his panel
would begin drafting a bill to raise taxes early next year.
Dole predicted that Congress would enact the increases,
but he spelled out few details, and did not mention how
much the committee's Republican majority hoped to raise
with its legislation.
But sources have reported that administration and con
gressional officials have drawn up a lengthy list of options,
including higher excise taxes on alcohol, toDacco and gaso
line, an import fee on crude oil and disallowing tax deduc
tions on consumer debt interest, except for home mortgages
and car loans.
Dole said he hoped hearings would start on the bill before
Congress adjourns for the year.
Sources said that no consensus has been reached among
Senate Republicans on which proposals to advance, al
though one official said the least desirable option was to
backtrack on the three-year, income-tax cut.
