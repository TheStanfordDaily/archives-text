# Legal service needs fee vote to remain open
## 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU Legal Counseling office
says it will have to close its doors at
the end of this quarter if the group's
fee assessment does not pass in the
fall fee assessment election tomor
row and Thursday.
Legal Counseling provides free le
gal advice to registered students who
pay the $1 fee assessment each quar
ter. About 1000 students took advan
tage of the service last year, said Bon
nie Senko, administrative assistant.
"We don't want the office to close
because it's a valuable service,"
Senko said. "But if we don't get
enough students to vote we will have
to close."
Last spring Legal Counseling's fee
assessment would have been ap
proved, but it failed to receive the re
quired 20 percent of student votes on
trie issue. The group fell 17 voters
short, Senko said.
Legal Counseling was originally
formed in 1973 by an ASSU policy
board. The group chose the San Jose
legal firm of Morgan, Ruby, Teter,
Schofield, Franich, Bouchier and
Fredkin to staff the office. The firm
has been awarded the contract every
year since.
Attorneys from the firm are avail
able to students on an appointment
basis Mondays 1-5 p.m. and Tuesdays
and Thursdays 9a.m.-sp.m. All con
sultations are confidential, Senko
said.
According to Glen Schofield, su

pervising attorney at Legal Counsel
ing, he and four other lawyers work
part-time in the group's ASSU office
in Tresidder. All are Stanford Law
School graduates.
Schofield said Legal Counseling
"gives students the ability to sit down
with practicing attorneys, get advice,
and work out legal problems."
"Students would never go into
downtown Palo Alto for legal as
sistance because it would cost them
more than their problem is worth,"
he said.
Legal Counseling's annual budget
of approximately $34,000 is entirely
funded by fee assessments. Of that,
$2000 a month is paid to the law firm
and the rest is used to pay Senko and
to cover office and publicity ex
penses. Schofield estimates that he
receives about one-fourth his usual
hourly rate of $90 per hour when
working at the ASSU office.
Any registered Stanford student
can take advantage of Legal Counsel
ing as long as he has not taken back
his $1 fee assessment for the quarter,
Senko said. It is the only student ser
vice on the fee assessment ballot
which works in that way.
"Not as manystudentstaketheirsl
back from us as (they do) for others,"
Senko said. " It's legal insurance."
When students come in to the of
fice for consultations they are "en
titled to as much consultation time as
needed," Schofield said. "We try to
provide good, solid legal counseling

to the students."
Schofield said that he and the oth
er attorneys will write letters, make
telephone calls, and help students to
!>et up their cases properly if they
wish to go to court. The lawyers do
not take cases to actual court unless
the student personally hires them.
"Most problems that students have
can be resolved without going into
actual litigation," he said.
The most common problem areas
include housing, consumer relations,
and criminal cases (mostly traffic-re
lated), but the attorneys have also of
fered advice to students selling
houses or involved in securities

fraud The Legal Counseling office
will provide advice on almost every
problem except University-related
matters. In those cases staff lawyers
refer students to the Ombudsman.
Currently a majority of the stu
dents using Legal Counseling are
graduate students, but the number of
undergraduates has been increasing
over the last few years, according to
Senko.
"Some students feel they would be
wasting a lawyer's time by coming in
here but that's what we're here for,
that's what students are paying for."
