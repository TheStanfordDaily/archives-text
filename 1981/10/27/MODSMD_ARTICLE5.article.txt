# Third World Week starts with rally
## 
### Chitra Subramaniam 
Speaking at yesterday's noon rally in White Plaza in
itiating Third World Week, Sergy Floro, a founder of the
newly-constituted Third World Coalition, strongly de
nounced the Reagan administration's "charitable at
titude" toward the developing countries.
"The Third World nations do not want charity — what
they want is a just reparation of what has been taken
away from them," Floro said. "Nations with economic
power do not have the right to dictate terms to the rest of
the world," she added.
The rally marked the beginning of Third World Week,
the agenda for which was sparked by the recent North-
South summit in Cancun, Mexico.
Speaking on behalf of the African Students Associa
tion, Awetu Simesso said if the '50s and the '60s were
marked by a sometimes peaceful, sometimes violent
struggle for independence, the '70s were marked by dis
illusionment. "This disillusionment stems from flag inde
pendence these nations achieved — an independence
where the countries were politically free, but the eco
nomic reins were held elsewhere." According to Sim
esso, the agenda in the '80s for the South, which includes
underdeveloped and developing countries, should be
national liberation, and the agenda for the North, which
includes the developed countries, should be to vanquish
its economic hold on developing countries.
Stressing the social consequences of what he called
the "hegemony" of the North, Simesso said people in
the poor nations had begun to despise themselves, their
past and their culture. "The confusion in these countries
is thus genuine and overwhelming in its intensity," he
said.

Nilufer Cagatay, who spoke on behalf of the Associa
tion of Students from Turkey said that what brought
Third World nations together in a group was their past —
a past of colonialism, oppression and exploitation.
Questioning President Ronald Reagan's free-en
terprise plan for development and freedom in such
Third World countries as Taiwan, Brazil, Korea and the
Philippines, Cagatay said it was a well-known fact that
these countries had repressive regimes.
"Reagan's policy towards the Third World is just an ex
tension of his economic policy at home and it will in
crease the gap between the rich and the poor," said
Cagatay, referring to rich landlords and industrialists in
the developing nations.
Cagatay's views wereshared by Enrique Sanchez-Ruiz,
who stressed the inequality within nations. "There exists
a 'North' and 'South' within nations and justice is im
possible unless the very structure undergoes a change,"
he said. Representing the Seminar on the Political Econ
omy of Education in Mexico (a Stanford education
school program), Sanchez-Ruiz commented that un
fortunately Mexico had to adopt an almost neutral
stance at the Cancun summit because of its host status.
The speakers stressed the point that not much could
come out of a summit where there was no agenda, and
no communiques. "Reagan went to Cancun armed with
answers to questions that had not been defined," Floro
said.
Speaking again at the end of the rally, Floro urged soli
darity for justice in the Third World. "The Third World
Week, which includes symposia and films on issues relat
ing to development is the beginning of what the coali
tion hopes will be an ongoing debate," she said.

terprise plan for development and freedom in such
Third World countries as Taiwan, Brazil, Korea and the
Philippines, Cagatay said it was a well-known fact that
these countries had repressive regimes.
"Reagan's policy towards the Third World is just an ex
tension of his economic policy at home and it will in
crease the gap between the rich and the poor," said
Cagatay, referring to rich landlords and industrialists in
the developing nations.
Cagatay's views wereshared by Enrique Sanchez-Ruiz,
who stressed the inequality within nations. "There exists
a 'North' and 'South' within nations and justice is im
possible unless the very structure undergoes a change,"
he said. Representing the Seminar on the Political Econ
omy of Education in Mexico (a Stanford education
school program), Sanchez-Ruiz commented that un
fortunately Mexico had to adopt an almost neutral
stance at the Cancun summit because of its host status.
The speakers stressed the point that not much could
come out of a summit where there was no agenda, and
no communiques. "Reagan went to Cancun armed with
answers to questions that had not been defined," Floro
said.
Speaking again at the end of the rally, Floro urged soli
darity for justice in the Third World. "The Third World
Week, which includes symposia and films on issues relat
ing to development is the beginning of what the coali
tion hopes will be an ongoing debate," she said.
