## Third World and Developed siding off in race for UN chief 
### Post 
United Nations — The United Nations be
gins the process of electing a new secretary
general today, in a contest that pits the super
powers against the Third World and may
prove to be the institution's most important
decision of the year.
So far there are just two official candidates
— Austria's Kurt Waldheim, who is seeking an
unprecedented third five-year term, and
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Salim Salim, who
has the formal endorsement of more than
half the 156 members.
But there are at least half a dozen dark
horses ready to jump into the race if a dead
lock develops, which is a strong possibility.
Although the political and administrative
authority of any secretary general is severely
limited by the charter and institutional evolu
tion of the United Nations, there remains the
power to build or to erode the usefulness of
the institution.
Limited decision-making
Only the most intractable issues eventually
come to the secretary general, such as Af
ghanistan and Namibia, and on these his abili
ty to act as an intermediary is limited.
Even his administrative authority is circum
scribed by fiefdoms of his theoretical sub
ordinates, the chiefs of U.N. specialized
agencies and some of his own U.N. depart
ment heads, each of whom has an independ
ent power base of support from govern
ments.
But the secretary general can still speak out
publicly, demonstrate his effectiveness and
innovation as intermediary, catalyst or cons
cience. And so the selection of a new person
for the job is always a watershed for the Unit
ed Nations, and potentially for the world.
Waldheim has conducted a masterful 10-
year balancing act to satisfy the demands of
the rival power blocs, but the feeling has
grown among Third World diplomats that it is
time for one of their own to take the helm of
the organization they see asthe chief interna
tional mechanism for the advancement of
their common interests.
Waldheim known as cautious
Waldheim's innate caution is believed to
have earned him the support of both Wash
ington — although U.S. officials there insist
no decision will be made until the last mo
ment — and Moscow.
"An old shoe fits best," Soviet Ambassador

Oleg Troyanovsky has said.
The drama begins when the names of Salim
and Waldheim are put to the vote in secret
ballots at today's closed meeting of the 15-na
tion Security Council.
On the first ballot, each man is expected to
win the necessary nine votes — because
council members may vote for more than one
candidate. But the expectation isthateach in
itially will be vetoed, without prejudice to
contesting anew in subsequent rounds.
The United States is expected to veto Salim.
In Washington, some perceive him as an anti-
American radical. Salim led the cheers in the
U.N. aisles when Peking won the United Na
tion's China seat in 1971, much to the discom
fiture of George Bush, then U.N. ambassador
and now vice president.
Superpowers tear Salim
The Soviets are thought to fear that Salim,
an energetic and intelligent diplomat with
long U.N. experience, would prove an activist
as secretary general, and that he is too close
to Peking. But Moscow is expected to let the
United States apply the veto, to preserve the
Soviets' public record of support fortheThird
World.
The Chinese, who have always preferred a
Third World candidate, have let it be known
that they will veto Waldheim at least through
rounds in which Salim continues to hold the
needed nine votes.
Salim is expected to be supported by
France, Ireland and Spain among Western na
tions.
The 156-nation General Assembly, which
must approve the council nominee, has been
no more than a rubber stamp. But this year,
Salim has emerged as a group candidate,
rather than an individual running on his own
merits. He won formal endorsement of the
Organization of African Unity in June and of
the 83-nation Nonaligned Movement last
month.
Latin vote critical
Nevertheless, Algeria and other Salim
backers have been lobbying for votes to have
the assembly reject a council recommenda
tion of Waldheim's candidacy. And the Latin
Americans could join African nations to
create such an assembly majority in order to
promote the deadlock they seek. Several of
the other possible candidates are from Latin
America.

the institution.
Limited decision-making
Only the most intractable issues eventually
come to the secretary general, such as Af
ghanistan and Namibia, and on these his abili
ty to act as an intermediary is limited.
Even his administrative authority is circum
scribed by fiefdoms of his theoretical sub
ordinates, the chiefs of U.N. specialized
agencies and some of his own U.N. depart
ment heads, each of whom has an independ
ent power base of support from govern
ments.
But the secretary general can still speak out
publicly, demonstrate his effectiveness and
innovation as intermediary, catalyst or cons
cience. And so the selection of a new person
for the job is always a watershed for the Unit
ed Nations, and potentially for the world.
Waldheim has conducted a masterful 10-
year balancing act to satisfy the demands of
the rival power blocs, but the feeling has
grown among Third World diplomats that it is
time for one of their own to take the helm of
the organization they see asthe chief interna
tional mechanism for the advancement of
their common interests.
Waldheim known as cautious
Waldheim's innate caution is believed to
have earned him the support of both Wash
ington — although U.S. officials there insist
no decision will be made until the last mo
ment — and Moscow.
"An old shoe fits best," Soviet Ambassador

Oleg Troyanovsky has said.
The drama begins when the names of Salim
and Waldheim are put to the vote in secret
ballots at today's closed meeting of the 15-na
tion Security Council.
On the first ballot, each man is expected to
win the necessary nine votes — because
council members may vote for more than one
candidate. But the expectation isthateach in
itially will be vetoed, without prejudice to
contesting anew in subsequent rounds.
The United States is expected to veto Salim.
In Washington, some perceive him as an anti-
American radical. Salim led the cheers in the
U.N. aisles when Peking won the United Na
tion's China seat in 1971, much to the discom
fiture of George Bush, then U.N. ambassador
and now vice president.
Superpowers tear Salim
The Soviets are thought to fear that Salim,
an energetic and intelligent diplomat with
long U.N. experience, would prove an activist
as secretary general, and that he is too close
to Peking. But Moscow is expected to let the
United States apply the veto, to preserve the
Soviets' public record of support fortheThird
World.
The Chinese, who have always preferred a
Third World candidate, have let it be known
that they will veto Waldheim at least through
rounds in which Salim continues to hold the
needed nine votes.
Salim is expected to be supported by
France, Ireland and Spain among Western na
tions.
The 156-nation General Assembly, which
must approve the council nominee, has been
no more than a rubber stamp. But this year,
Salim has emerged as a group candidate,
rather than an individual running on his own
merits. He won formal endorsement of the
Organization of African Unity in June and of
the 83-nation Nonaligned Movement last
month.
Latin vote critical
Nevertheless, Algeria and other Salim
backers have been lobbying for votes to have
the assembly reject a council recommenda
tion of Waldheim's candidacy. And the Latin
Americans could join African nations to
create such an assembly majority in order to
promote the deadlock they seek. Several of
the other possible candidates are from Latin
America.

WALDHEIM AT CANCUN — U.N. Secretary General Kur! Waldheim bows as Mexican
President Jose Lopez Portillo salutes during welcoming ceremonies at the Cancun
North-South summit meeting last week.
United Nations — The United Nations be
gins the process of electing a new secretary
general today, in a contest that pits the super
powers against the Third World and may
prove to be the institution's most important
decision of the year.
So far there are just two official candidates
— Austria's Kurt Waldheim, who is seeking an
unprecedented third five-year term, and
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Salim Salim, who
has the formal endorsement of more than
half the 156 members.
But there are at least half a dozen dark
horses ready to jump into the race if a dead
lock develops, which is a strong possibility.
Although the political and administrative
authority of any secretary general is severely
limited by the charter and institutional evolu
tion of the United Nations, there remains the
power to build or to erode the usefulness of
the institution.
