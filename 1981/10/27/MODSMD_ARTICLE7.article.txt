# Spain receives Picasso work

### 
Madrid, Spain (AP) — A mile-long line of
Spaniards, some crossing themselves in rever
ence, filed through a metal detector Sunday for
a first peek 'at Pablo Picasso's masterpiece
"Guernica."
A dedicated le f tist, Picasso loaned "Guernica"
to New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1939
and said it must not return to his homeland until
democracy was re-established.
Thousands waited quietly in Madrid for up to
four hours before entering the Cason del Buen
Retiro — House of Happy Retirement — where
the stark grey, black and white mural went on
display for the first time in Spain. There was no
official crowd estimate.
100 th anniversary ol his birth
The exhibition at the Prado Museum annex
Sunday coincided with the 100 th anniversary of
Picasso's birth in Malaga, southern Spain.
Police said they were on alert for possible at
tacks by right-wing extremists opposed to the
mural, for 42 years a refugee in New York's
Museum of Modern Art.
The 11-foot by 25-foot mural is Picasso's

portrayal of human and animal suffering in the
German saturation bombing of Guernica, a
Basque market town, in support of the Fascist
Gen. Francisco Franco. Considered one of
Picasso's finest works, the painting is valued un
officially at $40 million.
Depicted fascist brutality
The April 26, 1937, attack killed an estimated
1600 people and became a world symbol of
fascist brutality. At least 800,000 people were
killed in the 1936-39 civil war between leftist Re
publican forces and Fascist rebels led by Franco.
The 91-year-old painter died in exile in France
in 1973, two years before Franco's death ended
34 years of dictatorship in Spain.
The government of Premier Leopoldo Calvo
Sotelo sponsored a Picasso centenary celebra
tion in Malaga on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the northern Basque city
Bilbao, an estimated 200,000 people demon
strated peacefully against proposed new restric
tions on regional autonomy. Some of the dem
onstrators also called for the transfer of the
Picasso mural to Guernica.
