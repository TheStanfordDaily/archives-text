# French want peace force in Chad
## 
### Washington Post 
Paris — Increasingly con
cerned about clashes between
rival armies in Chad and Libya's
growing occupation role there,
France has stepped up pressure
on friendly African govern
ments to dispatch a joint peace
force to the ravaged central
African country."
The new sense of urgency in
Paris grows from fears that
strife within the National
Union Transition Government,
headed by Chadian President
Goukouni Oueddei, and the
threat from Sudanese and
Egyptian-backed forces of
former defense minister Hiss
ene Habre will give Libyan
leader Moammar Khadafy rea
son to prolong and strengthen
his army's hold on Chad.
It also comes against a back
ground of increased Western
nervousness — particularly in
the Reagan administration —
over Khadafy's influence in
northeastern Africa following
the assassination of president
Anwar Sadat of Egypt earlier
this month.
U.S. seeks to limit Libyan sway
Although nothing has sur
faced to suggest Libyan in
volvement in the murder, Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig
has reiterated U.S. de
termination to resist Libyan
sponsored subversion in Egypt
and neighboring Sudan since
Sadat's death.
Sudanese President Jaafar
Nimeiri has cited Libyan bomb
ing of Sudanese border vil
lages, used as havens by
Habre's irregulars, as proof of
Libyan aggression and an in
dication of Khadafy's intention
to invade Sudan. Reports from
Khartoum, the Sudanese capi
tal, suggest Western diplomats
see less danger of Libyan at

tack. But Huig, in his effort fol
lowing Sadat's assassination to
show that Washington stands
by its friends, said the United
States will speed deliveries of
weapons to Nimeiri's army.
Chad former French colony
French concerns center on
Chad because of a colonial and
post-colonial role there that
lasted militarily until then-pres
ident Valery Giscard d'Estaing
pulled French troops out of the
chaotic, multi-sided civil war.
The conflict was finally settled
only when Libya intervened on
behalf of Goukouni nearly a
year ago with an expeditionary
force now estimated at more
than 8,000.
The new government of
President Francois Mitterrand
is determined not to renew
France's military role in Chad,
judged by his Socialist Party as
neocolonialist and unwise. At
the same time, Goukouni
openly has sought French help
in rebuilding a national army
and restoring Ndjamena, the
heavily damaged capital.
In addition, Paris is eager to
regain the confidence of its
African allies. These leaders
were shaken by Giscard's inac
tion as Libyan troops rolled
into Chad to aid Goukouni in
what was seen as a major blow
to French and Western in
fluence in Africa, and a boost
for the Khadafy's expansionist
plans.
Mitterrand wants a role
During a visit here by
Goukouni last month, Mitter
rand's government pledged to
help rebuild Ndjamena even
while Libyan troops remain, a
concession from the earlier
French position.
Simultaneously, French en
voys have been pressing the
Organization of African Unity

to act. The OALJ resolved atter
a summit meeting this spring to
send an inter-African peace
force to Chad by July to replace
the Libyan forces, but no
troops have been sent.
Now sharp clashes have bro
ken out near Mongo in central
Chad between forces headed
by Interior Minister
Mohammed Abba Said and ri
val bands led by Foreign Min
ister Ahmed Acyl. Libyan
troops are reported here to

'Above all, after the clear and
continuing military threat of (Sudanese
President Gaafar Mohamed) Nimeiri
against C/iad,a withdrawal of our forces
(in Chad) in the immediate future has
become .. . impossible/
— Libyan President Moammar Khadafy

have intervened on Acyl'sside,
underscoring the occupation
army's key role in Chadian af
fairs.
Libyans in Chad administration
At the same time, French of
ficials have reported indica
tions that Libyan troops in
eastern Chad, near the area
where Habre's rebels operate
from their Sudanese sanc
tuaries, have begun assuming
civilian administrative roles as
well as military duties. This has
reinforced fears here that un
less the OAU acts quickly,
Khadafy's troops will settle in
to stay, perhaps accomplishing
the "merger" he and
Goukouni have spoken of on
several occasions but never

consummated.
The Libyan leader dramat
ized these concerns in an in
terview broadcast last night on
Italian state television in which
he said Nimeri's support for
Habre makes it impossible for
Libyan troops to leave for
home this year as Khadafy had
promised they would — and
that indeed they will be
strengthened if Nimeiri and
President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt increase their support of

Habre.
"Above all, after the clear
and continuing military threat
of Nimeiri against Chad,"
Khadafy said, "a withdrawal of
our forces in the immediate
future has become un
fortunately — I say un
fortunately — impossible, de
spite the fact that we had
hoped to pull out by the end of
the year."
Against this background,
Mitterrand dispatched a cable
from the Cancun summit con
ference to President Daniel
arap Moi of Kenya, the current
OAU president, urging that the
pan-African peace force be
formed and sent to Chad
"without delay."
