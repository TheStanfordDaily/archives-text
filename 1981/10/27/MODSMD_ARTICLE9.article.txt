# NATO allies propose 'zero-level' cuts for theatre missile discussions with Soviets
## 
### Washington Post 
The Hague, Netherlands — Several Eu
ropean nations will propose this week that
the United States adopt a "zero-level op
tion" as its official opening bargaining
position in the theater nuclear forces (TNF)
negotiations with the Soviet Union sched
uled to begin in Geneva Nov. 30, allied de
fense and diplomatic officials have dis
closed.
The decision by West Germany, Italy and
the Netherlands to press the United States
to offer the controversial proposal at Ge
neva represents a move by them to defuse
the mass protests rolling across Europe
against the scheduled deployment in their
countries of a new generation of U.S. me
dium-range nuclear missiles, these of
ficials acknowledged.
European pressures resulted in NATO's
defense ministers last week endorsing the
zero option as a possible negotiating pro
posal at a meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland,
despite U.S. opposition.
Bonn, Rome and The Hague now want
to push for a stronger U.S. commitment to
this option. U.S. officials have been mod
erating their position on the plan but still
are doubtful whether they will accept it.
Hope to stop missile deployment
Under the "zero-level" approach, the
NATO allies would agree not to deploy any
of the now-planned 108 Pershing 2 and 464
ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe
if the Soviets reduce to zero their 250 or so
new SS-20 intermediate-range missiles,
each with three warheads, and about 300
remaining, older SS-4 and SS-5 medium
range missiles.
Until now, the official position of NATO
has been that the TNF talks should result in
an equal balance of theater-range missiles
on both sides, with no numbers men
tioned.
When this zero-option approach was
raised privately by the West dur
ing the Carter administration, Washington
officials rejected it, arguing that thereafter
the Soviets would not consider the allies
serious in wanting some arms limitations.
Reagan officials have criticized the zero
option idea, saying publicly that it raises
false hopes about what can be achieved
through negotiation and adding privately
that should the Soviets accept the idea, it

would leave them with an advantage in the
nuclear forces that remained.
Soviet response unsure
The allies, however, do not expect the
Soviets to accept the zero-option ap
proach, it was learned during interviews in
the past weeks with officials in London,
The Hague, Bonn and Rome.
Many European officials say privately
they would be disappointed if the Soviets
did. They see in NATO-based Pershing 2
and ground-launched cruise missiles, real
deterrents to the Soviets, weapons that
Moscow would fear more than the land
based NATO missiles now in Europe be
cause they could hit the Soviet homeland.
Rather, U.S. adoption of the zero option
at the beginning of the coming talks, these
European officials contend, is a necessary
public relations move. They hope it would
link, in the minds of their uneasy consti
tuents, the new long-range U.S. nuclear
tipped missiles to the SS-20s and thus
counter the massive Soviet propaganda
aimed at blocking any NATO deploy
ments, while Moscow keeps the missiles it
already has deployed.

missiles.

United States is planning to bring in a
whole new type, thus increasing the nucle
ar threat in Europe.
The United States and its NATO allies are
still working out the final detailsof mutual
ly accepted positions for the U.S. nego
tiators to take at the Geneva talks.
The coming round of talks with the Sovi
ets will aim at trying to work out arrange
ments on two key procedural issues, ac
cording to officials.
"We have to decide on what we want to

limit," one NATO official involved in the
process said last week, "and how we want
to limit."
The United States, in preparing its ap
proach, has sounded out the allies on the
idea of expanding the types of Soviet mis
siles that would be included in the initial .
round of negotiations to include the SS-22,
a new, solid-fueled, mobile missile that
U.S. intelligence says can travel 620 miles
and thus would be able to hit West Germa
ny from the western Soviet Union.
The Europeans' zero-level proposal and
the U.S. plan to include the SS-22 will be
put forward, according to NATO sources,
at a meeting Monday in Brussels of the
Special Consultative Group, the commit
tee charged with working out NATO's ne
gotiating position.
New concern about the SS-22 was a ma
jor finding of the recent six-month review
of the Soviet threat undertaken by another
NATO committee, the High Level Group,
at the suggestion of the Reagan adminis
tration.
U.S. analysts weresaid to havesuggested
that if 'hrough the Geneva talks equal lim
its were placed on the NATO-based U.S.
Pershing and cruise and Soviet SS-20 mis
siles, the Soviets could simply build more

SS-22s and thus retain the numerical ad
vantage in warheads aimed at Western Eu
rope.

The United States, in preparing its ap

idea of expanding the types of Soviet mis

round of negotiations to include the SS-22,
a new, solid-fueled, mobile missile that
U.S. intelligence says can travel 620 miles
and thus would be able to hit West Germa

The Europeans' zero-level proposal and
the U.S. plan to include the SS-22 will be
put forward, according to NATO sources,
at a meeting Monday in Brussels of the
Special Consultative Group, the commit

gotiating position.
New concern about the SS-22 was a ma

of the Soviet threat undertaken by another
NATO committee, the High Level Group,
at the suggestion of the Reagan adminis

The Hague, Netherlands — Several Eu

The decision by West Germany, Italy and
the Netherlands to press the United States

the mass protests rolling across Europe
against the scheduled deployment in their
countries of a new generation of U.S. me

European pressures resulted in NATO's
defense ministers last week endorsing the

Under the "zero-level" approach, the
NATO allies would agree not to deploy any
of the now-planned 108 Pershing 2 and 464
ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe
if the Soviets reduce to zero their 250 or so
new SS-20 intermediate-range missiles,
each with three warheads, and about 300
remaining, older SS-4 and SS-5 medium
range missiles.
Until now, the official position of NATO
has been that the TNF talks should result in
an equal balance of theater-range missiles
on both sides, with no numbers men
tioned.
When this zero-option approach was
raised privately by the West dur
ing the Carter administration, Washington
officials rejected it, arguing that thereafter
the Soviets would not consider the allies
serious in wanting some arms limitations.
Reagan officials have criticized the zero
option idea, saying publicly that it raises
false hopes about what can be achieved
through negotiation and adding privately
that should the Soviets accept the idea, it

would leave them with an advantage in the
nuclear forces that remained.
Soviet response unsure
The allies, however, do not expect the
Soviets to accept the zero-option ap
proach, it was learned during interviews in
the past weeks with officials in London,
The Hague, Bonn and Rome.
Many European officials say privately
they would be disappointed if the Soviets
did. They see in NATO-based Pershing 2
