# Fabric roof to top De Guerre Pavilion

A Teflon-coated fiberglass fabric
roof highlights preliminary plans for
the $2.8 million deGuerre Pavilion in
door sports complex scheduled for
completion in February 1983.
If the University gives the go
ahead by the end of the year, con
struction on the site located between
Encina Gym and the Old Pavilion will
begin in mid-june. The building will
house three indoor basketball
courts, two classrooms, 10 offices and
will seat 1250 spectators in bleachers.
Project Manager Clifford Morse
explained that overcrowded condi
tions at existing gyms Warranted con
struction of a new facility. "Stanford,
like the rest of the country, is ex
periencing a mania for athletics,"
Morse said. "We have to recognize
that the phenomenon is here and
make plans to deal with it both today
and in the future."
The construction of the new facil
ity, he said, will not only help to al
leviate overcrowding at existing facil
ities, but will also permit the ex
pansion of intramur&l and varsity ath
letic programs.
The adoption of plans for a fabric
roof came in April 1981, when Morse
was informed that there would be a
shortfall of funds for the then-pro
posed Department of Athletics, Phys
ical Education, and Recreation
(DAPER) Fieldhouse.
Architect Donald Crosby, of

Crosby-Thornton-Marshall As
sociates Architects, had initially de
signed a facility using conventional
construction systems and main
taining the "Stanford look" through
traditional red tile and buff colored
brick.
Crosby, a Stanford alumnus, subse
quently redesigned the structure, in
cluding the fabric roof, to meet with
the new budgetary limitations for the
project. Studies done by Crosby's
firm and Owens-Corning Fiberglas,
the manufacturers of the roofing fab
ric, reveal that structures with fabric
roofs are more economical to build
and to operate than customary roofs.
Operating costs of the fieldhouse
will be lower because of the trans
lucent roof, which will enable full
operation without the use of artificial
lighting during the daylight hours.
The translucent nature of the fabric
will produce a "glowing effect"
when the pavilion is lighted at night.
The fabric roofing structure will
also reduce ventilating loads â€” a re
sult of eliminating heat-generating
lights. The building will also be safer
in the event of an earthquake, Morse
said.
The major disadvantage to the fab
ric roofing structure is its apparent
life span of 20 to 30 years. Morse said
the architect is still investigating the
cost/benefit ratio of energy savings
versus the replacement cost of the
fabric.
The building is designed to take
roughly the shape of a circle and will
be adjacent to Encina Gym. The facil
ity would occupy approximately
30,200 square feet, which is enough
floor space to accommodate either
three basketball courts, four vol

leyball courts, 12 badminton courts
or floor space for gymnastics and
fencing. Plans also include an out
door basketball court, an outside
deck and landscaping.
Morse said he hopes to present the
preliminary plans to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and the ad
ministrative council in November.
