## Cardinal mascot portrays University's whimsical spirit 
### 
"What a stupid idea to have the color cardinal as the
official Stanford mascot!" Recently, we've heard these
words dribble from the mouths of some Stanford stu
dents, and we hope to set the record straight. Unrealized
by many, the color cardinal is steeped in Stanford history
and would be the most appropriate mascot for the Uni
versity.
Cardinal is the official color of Stanford. However, this
has not always been the case. Back in the fall of 1891, a
powerful controversy convulsed the campus as student
body meetings were held to select an official color for
the new University. At those heated meetings, a red silk
handkerchief (now on display at the Stanford Archives)
was vigorously waved in support of adopting the color
cardinal — but to no avail. Gold was finally chosen.
A few months later, in the spring of 1892, when final
preparations were underway for the first Stanford-Cali
fornia football game, a special meeting of the student
body was unexpectedly called. The small, unrepresen
tative group of students assembled reversed the decision
of the previous fall and adopted Cardinal as the official
school color.

An uproar ensued, bitterly dividing the campus. The
day of the first Big Game, March 19,1892, saw half of the
Stanford fans clad in red and the other half wearing gold.
The reporters present looked into the stands and ac
cidentally mistook the gold-shirted Stanford fans for Cal
rooters. When Stanford unexpectedly won 14-10, the
headlines of the San Francisco Sunday papers screamed:
"Cardinal triumphs o'er gold and blue." The color con
troversy had been settled by the press. For the next 30
years, Stanford and its athletic teams were almost ex
clusively identified by the nickname "Cardinals."
Then, in the early 19205, the press began referring to
Stanford's athletic squads as the "Indians," perhaps be
cause the red jerseys they wore made them "Redskins."
The name caught on and the "Indian" was officially
adopted as the school mascot by an ASSU executive
committee in 1930. In 1972,42 years later, after the native
American community had made its objections known,
the Athletic Department reverted to the nickname
"Cardinals" in lieu of the Indian mascot.
It should be noted here that the color Cardinal was
never the University mascot. The only official mascot the

school has ever had was the "Indian." However, with the
"Indian" mascot properly and permanently disposed of,
we feel the color Cardinal should now be adopted as the
school mascot, thereby keeping the traditional
nickname "Cardinals" for the University's athletic teams.
Our reasons are many.
The color Cardinal, as already demonstrated, has tre
mendous historical significance for Stanford. We have
been "Cardinals" for 47 years, "Indians" for only 42. So,
purists and many conservative alumni should support
permanently reinstating the original nickname
"Cardinals." Also, it would be fittingly ironic if a school
color born in controversy could end the mascot con
troversy.
Furthermore, having Cardinal as our school mascot
would aptly capture the whimsical spirit of this campus;
poking fun at the idea of even having a mascot by adopt
ing a color as one. Cardinal would be as nebulous and
undefined as the student body itself, allowing each indi
vidual to develop his own creative understanding of and
appreciation for the University mascot.
Now consider the other meanings of the word

"Cardinal" besides "bright red." "Cardinal," according
to Webster's, means "of main importance." Does this
not aptly characterize the preeminent position of our
school among U.S. universities? And of course every stu
dent is familiar with the four cardinal virtues so prevalent
here: justice, prudence, fortitude and temperance.
Regardless of the outcome of this week's mascot refer
endum, some things will remain the same. The tree will
still be the symbol of the Band, and those silly looking
gryphons will remain in front of the Athletic Depart
ment. And no doubt some insensitive alumni will con
tinue to push for reinstating the "Indian" mascot.
But those offensive and ineffective cries of "Bring back
the Indian" should really be replaced by more fervent
and historically accurae shouts to permanently "Bring
back the Cardinals." The time has come to once again
pull out that famous red silk handkerchief waved almost
90 years ago, using it as a rallying point around which to
reunite the school and end the mascot controversy for
ever.

handkerchief (now on display at the Stanford Archives)
was vigorously waved in support of adopting the color
cardinal — but to no avail. Gold was finally chosen.
A few months later, in the spring of 1892, when final
preparations were underway for the first Stanford-Cali
fornia football game, a special meeting of the student
body was unexpectedly called. The small, unrepresen
tative group of students assembled reversed the decision
of the previous fall and adopted Cardinal as the official
school color.

An uproar ensued, bitterly dividing the campus. The
day of the first Big Game, March 19,1892, saw half of the
Stanford fans clad in red and the other half wearing gold.
The reporters present looked into the stands and ac
cidentally mistook the gold-shirted Stanford fans for Cal
rooters. When Stanford unexpectedly won 14-10, the
headlines of the San Francisco Sunday papers screamed:
"Cardinal triumphs o'er gold and blue." The color con
troversy had been settled by the press. For the next 30
years, Stanford and its athletic teams were almost ex
clusively identified by the nickname "Cardinals."
Then, in the early 19205, the press began referring to
Stanford's athletic squads as the "Indians," perhaps be
cause the red jerseys they wore made them "Redskins."
The name caught on and the "Indian" was officially
adopted as the school mascot by an ASSU executive
committee in 1930. In 1972,42 years later, after the native
American community had made its objections known,
the Athletic Department reverted to the nickname
"Cardinals" in lieu of the Indian mascot.
It should be noted here that the color Cardinal was
never the University mascot. The only official mascot the

school has ever had was the "Indian." However, with the
"Indian" mascot properly and permanently disposed of,
we feel the color Cardinal should now be adopted as the
school mascot, thereby keeping the traditional
nickname "Cardinals" for the University's athletic teams.
Our reasons are many.
The color Cardinal, as already demonstrated, has tre
mendous historical significance for Stanford. We have
been "Cardinals" for 47 years, "Indians" for only 42. So,
purists and many conservative alumni should support
permanently reinstating the original nickname
"Cardinals." Also, it would be fittingly ironic if a school
color born in controversy could end the mascot con
troversy.
Furthermore, having Cardinal as our school mascot
would aptly capture the whimsical spirit of this campus;
poking fun at the idea of even having a mascot by adopt
ing a color as one. Cardinal would be as nebulous and
undefined as the student body itself, allowing each indi
vidual to develop his own creative understanding of and
appreciation for the University mascot.
Now consider the other meanings of the word

"Cardinal" besides "bright red." "Cardinal," according
to Webster's, means "of main importance." Does this
not aptly characterize the preeminent position of our
school among U.S. universities? And of course every stu
dent is familiar with the four cardinal virtues so prevalent
here: justice, prudence, fortitude and temperance.
Regardless of the outcome of this week's mascot refer
endum, some things will remain the same. The tree will
still be the symbol of the Band, and those silly looking
gryphons will remain in front of the Athletic Depart
ment. And no doubt some insensitive alumni will con
tinue to push for reinstating the "Indian" mascot.
But those offensive and ineffective cries of "Bring back
the Indian" should really be replaced by more fervent
and historically accurae shouts to permanently "Bring
back the Cardinals." The time has come to once again
pull out that famous red silk handkerchief waved almost
90 years ago, using it as a rallying point around which to
reunite the school and end the mascot controversy for
ever.

"What a stupid idea to have the color cardinal as the
official Stanford mascot!" Recently, we've heard these
words dribble from the mouths of some Stanford stu
dents, and we hope to set the record straight. Unrealized
by many, the color cardinal is steeped in Stanford history
and would be the most appropriate mascot for the Uni
versity.
Cardinal is the official color of Stanford. However, this
has not always been the case. Back in the fall of 1891, a
powerful controversy convulsed the campus as student

handkerchief (now on display at the Stanford Archives)
was vigorously waved in support of adopting the color
