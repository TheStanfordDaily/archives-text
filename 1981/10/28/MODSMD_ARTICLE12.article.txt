## Protect nation's foreign students from spying, intimidation 
### 
Washington — On the day of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat's assassination two
weeks ago, a petite 30-year-old Taiwanese
widow was trying to convince some dazed
congressmen of another political murder.
She held up some 8-by-10 color photographs
to prove her point: some men winced; oth
ers just averted their eyes.
"Several of the wounds in the right shoul
der and neck were sustained several hours
before his death. If these were not from tor
ture, what could have caused them/' asked
Su-jen Chen, wife of a late Carnegie Mellon
University math professor who died under
suspicious circumstances in Taiwan last year.
Mrs. Chen insists her promising young hus
band waygurdered by Taiwanese secret po
lice activities in the United

States.
Student spies in America, she said, tipped
off the government back home.
Members of the House Asian and Pacific
Affairs Subcommittee watched what they
could of the autopsy photographs. For com
mittee Democrats and Republicans, Mrs.
Chen's testimony only increased their
doubts that the good professor "committed
suicide" during a visit with relatives, as the
military government in Taipei claims.
The Chen case is the most recent evidence
of foreign governments spying on citizens
who study in the United States. Spies for the
Taiwanese, the FBI admits, report "un
patriotic behavior" from many American
college campuses to authorities back home.
According to college advisers around the

country, the threat of surveillance and coer
cion hangs over foreign students from South
Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other nations
as well.
Unfortunately, for many of the nation's
nearly 300,000 foreign students, America
isn't the "free country" they've heard so
much about. Many often find they aren't as
"free" to engage in political activities the
way their American counterparts are.
In Taiwan's case, paid spies infiltrate politi
cal groups and social clubs to monitor stu
dents who speak out against their govern
ment back home. The agents routinely in
timidate, harass and inform students that
their relatives back home will suffer if they
don't pipe down.
Unless the United States curbs foreign stu

dent harassment, aspiring scholars abroad
will wonder if academic freedom exists any
where in the world. And as long as foreign
students' rights are abridged, Americans be
come pawns in the games of bully govern
ments overseas.
So far, only one congressman has offered a
possible solution: establishing a "foreign
student hotline" at the Justice Department.
While that's well-intentioned, we doubt that
harassed foreigners will turn to the U.S. gov
ernment for help with their own govern
ments. Only a combination of actions might
prompt cowardly nations to quit their cloak
and-dagger shenanigans.
Limiting foreign assistance to such vio
lators as Taiwan and South Korea is one pos

sible answer. At the time of Chen's death,
the State Department was already holding
up, for human rights reasons, Taiwan's re
quest for mace and Tasers (a nasty anti-riot
device that fires muscle-relaxing needles
from a distance of about 20 feet). Larger arms
sales might be similarly postponed.
America should do everything it can be
keep out spies of all stripes. If specialists in
intimidation and torture manage to slip
through the borders, we must minimize
their operations for everyone's sake before
America becomes a terrorists' battleground.

The Chen case is the most recent evidence
of foreign governments spying on citizens
who study in the United States. Spies for the
Taiwanese, the FBI admits, report "un
patriotic behavior" from many American
college campuses to authorities back home.
According to college advisers around the

country, the threat of surveillance and coer
cion hangs over foreign students from South
Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other nations
as well.
Unfortunately, for many of the nation's
nearly 300,000 foreign students, America
isn't the "free country" they've heard so
much about. Many often find they aren't as
"free" to engage in political activities the
way their American counterparts are.
In Taiwan's case, paid spies infiltrate politi
cal groups and social clubs to monitor stu
dents who speak out against their govern
ment back home. The agents routinely in
timidate, harass and inform students that
their relatives back home will suffer if they
don't pipe down.
Unless the United States curbs foreign stu

dent harassment, aspiring scholars abroad
will wonder if academic freedom exists any
where in the world. And as long as foreign
students' rights are abridged, Americans be
come pawns in the games of bully govern
ments overseas.
So far, only one congressman has offered a
possible solution: establishing a "foreign
student hotline" at the Justice Department.
While that's well-intentioned, we doubt that
harassed foreigners will turn to the U.S. gov
ernment for help with their own govern
ments. Only a combination of actions might
prompt cowardly nations to quit their cloak
and-dagger shenanigans.
Limiting foreign assistance to such vio
lators as Taiwan and South Korea is one pos

sible answer. At the time of Chen's death,
the State Department was already holding
up, for human rights reasons, Taiwan's re
quest for mace and Tasers (a nasty anti-riot
device that fires muscle-relaxing needles
from a distance of about 20 feet). Larger arms
sales might be similarly postponed.
America should do everything it can be
keep out spies of all stripes. If specialists in
intimidation and torture manage to slip
through the borders, we must minimize
their operations for everyone's sake before
America becomes a terrorists' battleground.
