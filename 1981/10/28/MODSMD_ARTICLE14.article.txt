## Laud Phi Delts for fund-raising efforts 
### 
In response to the feminist outrage
over the Phi Delta Theta calendar of
Stanford women, I can't help but
conclude that it is these humorless
feminists that set equal rights back
about 30 years. As a participant in the
initial photography session and re
ception, I found nothing sexist nor
patronizing in either the calendar
project or the attitude of the fraterni
ty members. Everything was handled
very professionally, and all the girls
who arrived feeling slightly ap
prehensive were immediately put at
ease by the friendly, relaxed at
mosphere.
The Phi Delts should be lauded for
their fund-raising efforts for SURE,
not criticized by overzealous libbers
who take any appreciation of women
to be a personal insult. This total lack
of understanding of the fraternity's
motives makes the angry members of
the Women's Center appear comical
in their '60s brand of militant
feminism.
Shelley Antonio's comment about
feeling sick when she thinks of
"women being shown for men's
pleasure" (Daily, Oct. 16) points up
her misunderstanding of the calen
dar project, as well as a rather para
noid perspective regarding relations
between men and women in general.
The pictures that the Phi Delts will
use in their calendar will be natural
shots featuring both the campus and
the women in an attractive manner.
There won't be any "pin up" shots or
sexually suggestive poses that would
justify the feminist uproar over this
project.

Phil Gyori and all of the Phi Delts
who have spent the time and effort to
organize this event deserve our ap
preciation for contributing to SURE.
Maybe their efforts will help reduce
the number of campus assaults on
women this year. I would gladly sup
port the work of any group that is
contributing to such a badly needed
student service.
I feel very strongly about equal
rights for women, yet I fail to see the
sexist threat that Catherine MacKin
non and Dayna Goldfine perceive in
this project. One of the greatest hin
drances to the advancement of wom
en's rights is the abundance of bitter,
humorless women who confuse
equal rights with a war between the
sexes. We should be attempting to
bring men and women closer togeth
er, not alienating one sex from the
other over inconsequential issues. I
know I'll be glad the next time I need
SURE's services that the Phi Delts un
dertook their calendar project and
made a positive contribution to all of
the women at Stanford.

In response to the recent criticism
about the Phi Delt Calendar, we, as
women, say "Go for it, Phi Delts!"
Since this calendar has sparked such
controversy, we feel that it is neces
sary that the Stanford community re
alizes the the Women's Center is not

representing all of the women at
Stanford and should not purport to
do so.
There are many women in our
community who feel that a calendar
which "would feature women at
Stanford in various environments
and work places" would cause no
harm, as long as the women were
fully clothed. A calendar of this na
ture does not exploit women and
does not treat them as "sex objects."
As the Phi Delts are planning on giv
ing the procees to SURE, the Wom
en's Center should be grateful in
stead of "malicious and hostile," as
project coordinator Phil Gyori de
scribed them. SURE needs as much
money and support as possible, and
those needed funds do not lurk in
the bushes behind Tresidder Union.
To the Women's Center we would
like to address the following ques
tions: Why did Sharon Silverstein of

the Women's Center wait two weeks
before returning Gyori's phone call?
For such a pressing issue, a two week
wait is inexcusable. Had she acted
immediately, the misunderstanding
could have been avoided. Upon de
ciding to take action, she should have
decided to either constuctively
criticize the Phi Delts or to under
mine the project.
We are not fighting the Women's
Center and are by no means affiliated
with the Phi Delts. However, the
Women's Center's militancy will
profit no one. There are many press
ing problems and worthwhile causes
that face the woman of today and
that need our attention. So give the
Phi Delts a break, and stop wasting
your time and ours.
