The editorial recommending a "no" vote for the Campus
Entertainment Board (Daily, Oct. 26) was misleading. Part of the
requested assessment would serve as an insurance fund to cover
losses incurred by campus groups that sponsor concerts which
are later cancelled. The fund would not, as the editorial
suggested, cover losses from any unsuccessful project
sponsored by a campus group. The Daily regrets the error
although the editorial board still recommends a "no" vote.
