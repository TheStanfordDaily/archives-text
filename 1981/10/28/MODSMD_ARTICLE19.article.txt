## Tear gas spray gives false protection 
### 
by The Washington Post
Los Angeles â€” Sold by the millions and
hailed by advertisers as the nation's best
non-lethal crime-fighter, tear gas spray
cans have been characterized in reports by
California rape victims and police as inef
fective devices that may do more harm
than good.
Limited tests conducted by sheriffs' de
partments in Ventura and Alameda coun
ties, backed by reports from rape counsel
ors in Los Angeles, indicate that the most
popular type of irritant spray needs 24 sec
onds to take effect. Even then, the reports
say, it is relatively ineffective against at
tackers who wear sunglasses or are excited
or intoxicated.
Judy Ravitz, director of a private Los An
geles commission on assaults against wom
en, said about 80 women who used the
spray cans have reported in the last 15
months being unable to fend off an at
tacker because they could not get to the
can, could not operate it properly, or
found the spray had little effect.
Laurie Stevens, director of a rape hotline
in Pasadena, said, "I think it gives people a
false sense of security. People think these
little cans are going to save their lives."
Stevens said one woman, whose alleged
assailant's case in now in court, was raped
by a man who broke into her home. She
managed to reach a can of tear gas she kept
in the kitchen, but when she sprayed it in
his face, "he just laughed at her," Stevens
said.
Tear-gas manufacturers acknowledged
that some products on the market do not
work or have misleading advertising, the
focus now of an investigation by the Feder

al Trade Commission. But they said most of
the products, available in all but a few
states and the District of Columbia, can
help a potential crime victim escape an at
tacker if used properly.
Police and rape counselors complain
that women armed with tear gas get the
impression that it will actually stop an at
tacker, when it usually can do no more
than distract him briefly. A revised lesson
plan about to be added to the California
training classes says:"It is important to re
alize that tear gas does not paralyze."
But few states provide training or regu
late advertising for the spray cans. The
wrapper on a can of Paralyzer shows a
young woman spraying an attacker in the
face and standing over him as he crouches
with his face in his hands.
The wrapper says:"The 'PARALYZER'
has been editorialized on NBC, CBS, and
ABC television, in major newspapers and
national magazines, as a precision protec
tive instrument that will instantly stop even
a 300 lb. man up to 20 minutes, including
individuals under the influence of alcohol
and/or narcotics."
Asked if they could prove that claim,
spokesmen cited tests made at Edgewood
Arsenal and by the International Associa
tion of Chiefs of Police. Neither testing
center, however, has tried out the spray in
simulated attacks. The Edgwood Arsenal
used grenades or blowers, not spray cans,
in 1976 to test the irritant used by Paralyzer.
An International Association of Chiefs of
Police test in 1969 showed a 24-second de
lay before the same irritant took effect in a
spray-can test.
John Woods, an official with the Califor

nia justice Department responsible for
clearing tear-gas brands for use in the
state, said his office tests each project to
ensure the irritant contains the proper
chemicals, is not mislabeled and has a
properly functioning spray mechanism. -
He said California officials dropped the
idea of testing the effectiveness of the
spray because there was no way to covet
"all the cicumstances" in a potential at
tack.
The closest to a full field test occurred
earlier this year at the Police and Sheriff
Academy for Ventura County. Recruits
training at the academy acted as robbers
attacking local women enlisted for the test
by a production team for ABC-IV's
"20/20" program, which filmed the event.
According to Ventura County Lt. Steve
Giles, none of the 20 women involved was
able to stop her attacker, despite having
the spray can ready and managing in many
cases to shoot the simulated atta( kers
directly in the face. The police recruits,
who jumped from behind cars or walls,
"were able to do whatever they wanted to
do, with discomfort, but they were able to
do it" even after being sprayed, said
academy Sgt. Robert Brooks.
Brooks and Giles said all the women in
the test had taken the two-hour training
course required in California. Having seen
the results, Brooks said, "I wouldn't rec
ommend any of my family carrying tear
gas." He said his department's own officers
have found tear gas ineffective, particular
ly with individuals who are extremely
agitated or under the influence of drugs or
alcohol. "Most officers will use their Mace
once or twice, early in their careers, and
then not use it again," he said.
