The Hoover Institution yesterday
confirmed that its director, Dr. W.
Glenn Campbell, has been ap
pointed by President Ronald Reagan
chairman of the Intelligence Over
sight Board and a memeber of the
President's Foreign Intelligence Ad
visory Board.
The three-member oversight
board "is responsible for advising the
president as to the legality and pro
priety of intelligence activities," ac
cording to a Hoover press release.
The release said the 19-member for
eign intelligence advisory board,
headed by Ambassador Anne
Armstrong, is designed to "enhance"
the security of the United States by
improving the quality and effective
ness of intelligence."
A White House press release on
Campbell's appointment was issued
Oct. 20. The statement reached the
Hoover Institution and was released
yesterday, a Hoover spokesperson
said.
Campbell, 57, was unavailable for
comment.
National security advisor Richard
Allen called the two boards "key ele
ments in the president's program to
revitalize and strengthen American
intelligence capabilities" while
"ensuring that constitutional rights
.. . are fully protected," according to
the Hoover statement.
The two positions will require
Campbell to make periodic trips to
Washington, according to the Institu
tion's media relations assistant Mary
ann Gilpatrick. She said, however,
that Campbell will continue to direct
the Institution and would continue
to reside in Los Altos.
Campbell was born in Kokoma,
Ontario, Canada. He received his

B.A. at the University of Western On
tario before completing his Masters
and Ph.D in economics at Harvard
University. He taught economics
there from 1948-1951, when he be
came a research economist for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He later
directed a research for the American
Enterprise Association.
In 1960, Campbell was appointed
director of the Hoover Institituion.
He served on the President's Com
mission on White House Fellows be
tween 1969 and 1974 and was a mem
ber of the President's Committee on
Science and Technology in 1976.
Reagan, while governor of Califor
nia, appointed Campbell as a regent
of the University of California in 1960.
The Hoover director served on the
president-elect's transition advisory
board, on cabinet and subcabinet
positions and as chairman of an
education policy task force.
Campbell is also a member of the
Bohemian Club in San Francisco to
which Reagan belongs.
The new appointee to the In
telligence Oversight Board studied
economic development and foreign
aid programs for the U.S. Senate be
tween 1956 and 1957. He is co-author
of The American Competitive En
terprise Economy and editor and
principle author of The Economics of
Mobilization and War.
