# Ex-hostages damage suit denied
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — With seven
former Iranian hostages in the
courtroom, U.S. District Judge
William Gray dismissed their
multimillion-dollar damage
suit against the government of
Iran.
In all, 13 Americans freed
from the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran last january had asked
for $5 million each in damages.
But Assistant U.S. Attorney
Theodore Hirt asked that the
action be thrown out of court,
in part, for lack of jurisdiction
over an international agree
ment.
That agreement beween
then-President Carter and Iran

barred the hostages from
suing.
Gray declared that he did
"not have the slightest doubt"
that the 53 American hostages
were subjected to gross neg
lect during their captivity. He
suggested that the agreement
bordered on "extortion" un
der the pressure of the mo
ment.
Nevertheless, Gray said, the
Carter pact was the quid pro
quo for releasing the hostages
and, he added, Washington
should not "welsh" on that
agreement.
"Have you considered the
international repercussions
that might occur" should the

courts overturn that pact? the
jurist asked rhetorically.
Attorney James Davis, repre
senting the 13 former hostages,
argued that they were denied
their constitutional due proc
ess rights by not being allowed
to sue Iran for damages.
Davis noted that the U.S.-
Iranian agreement, signed in
Algiers on Jan. 19, did allow for
a $1 billion fund to be set aside
under the auspices of the Unit
ed Nations' International
Court of Justice to take care of
commercial claims against Iran.
There is no such fund for per
sonal claims.
Davis said the decision
would be appealed.

Not to fight the decision,
Davis said, "would send a sig
nal that Iran was right all
along."
Gray, explaining his reasons
for the dismissal, said that in a
sense the long incarceration of
the hostages was not unique
and that history shows many
examples of Americans who
have suffered or died on for
eign soil in the service of their
country.
Following Gray's decision,
Davis walked to the back of the
courtroom and talked with the
seven former hostages, some
of whom had brought their
families with them.
