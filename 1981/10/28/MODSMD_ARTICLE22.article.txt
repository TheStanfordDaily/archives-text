# Auto stocks rise foreseen
## 
### 
New York — These are the days that try supp
ly-sider souls, testing whether they have
courage sufficient to stay the course in the face
of terrible economic news.
These are days also that could provide millions
of Americans with an indelible lesson — that the
economic future isn't always a simple projection
of the present, because great changes may be
under way.
Supply-siding is a long-term theory in which
money is steered into investments that make the
production side of the economy more efficient

— so efficient, it is said, that the bounty can be
shared by all.
In the short term, however, it has at least one
undeniable consumer consequence: It means
tougher times, times such as these, when modest
attempts to buy cars and houses and good vaca
tions are frustrated.
In the short term it also means political prob
lems, such as those President Ronald Reagan
may soon be encountering from automobile
workers, homemakers and others who feel they
are getting a bad deal from the administration.
And so it is a time, therefore, when political
realities may intrude on economic convictions.
A time when the most convinced supply-siders
may, in the forest of details, lose courage in
• reaching the goal.
It is in this setting that a forecast of boom for
automakers produces a feeling of disbelief. But
there it is, an announcement from Value Line,
the biggest investment advisor of all, that its ana

lysts expect the U.S. auto industry, which lost
nearly $4 billion last year, to earn $3.6 million
next year, and nearly double that in the years
1984-1986.
Value Line makes mistakes, although probably
far fewer than the great majority of those who
claim to have insight into the future. It is also the
biggest advisory service, having won that status
over more than 50 years.
In the midst of the worst mid-October car
sales period in 23 years (from Oct. 11 to Oct. 20),
during which sales fell to a 5.1 million unit an
nual rate, the advisory service talks about 12 mil
lion units by 1984.
Between then and 1986, it declares, General
Motors stock, now selling around $40 a share,
could sell from between $145 to $175. Ford, now
less than $20 a share, might reach $60 to $80.
Chrysler, less than $5, could reach $16, and
American Motors, now less than $3, could reach
$12.
How can such a bullish forecast be made in the
midst of such pervasive gloom? Because, the ser
vice says, a number of factors, already at work,
will make their impact.
At the moment, automotive stocks are de
pressed, and so is the economy. The automobile
companies say wait until tomorrow and we'll
look a lot better. Reagan says wait until 1983 and
the economy will look as bright and shiney as
promised during the election campaign.
The question is whether or not the voting pub
lic is willing to invest in him.
It's a situation similar to investing in automo
tive stocks. It takes faith.
