Last night's game would have
been played on the latest date

Steinbrenner and Ron Cey, the
Dodgers third baseman.
Sunday night, after New
York had lost its third straight
game at Dodger Stadium,
Steinbrenner, the Yankees
owner, got into a fight in an
elevator in his hotel with two
young men whom he said
made derogatory remarks
about his team.
Steinbrenner sustained a
possible broken left hand from
a punch he said he threw, and
he said he was hit in the head
by a beer bottle one of the men
held. He knocked out three of
one of the men's teeth and
knocked both of them down,
Steinbrenner said.
Cey, meanwhile, was ex
pected to start Game Six after
being hit on the helmet with a
pitch from Yankees reliever
Rich Gossage in the eighth in
ning of Sunday's fifth game, a
2-1 Dodgers victory.
