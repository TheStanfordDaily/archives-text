Los Angeles (AP) â€” Boxing
promoter Harold Rossfields
Smith went to trial yesterday
charged with plotting to de
fraud Wells Fargo Bank of $21.3
million that vanished from a
bank branch early this year.
Questioning of 100 pros
pective jurors began in the
courtroom of U.S. District
Judge Consuelo Marshall.
Smith was named in a 32-
count indictment last July 30
accusing him and others of
conspiracy to defraud the
bank, of interstate transporta
tion of allegedly stolen bank
funds and of forgery.
Co-defendants include fel
low boxing promoter Sammie
Marshall and former Wells
Fargo official L. Benjamin Lew
is.
Smith contended he was the
dupe of a scheme by high bank
officials, but in the indictment,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean
Allison said Smith had hoped
to establish Muhammad Ali
Profession Sports Inc. and

Muhammad Ali Amateur
Sports Inc. "as the dominant
promoters of boxing matches
and other sporting events in
the United States."
Lewis, who pleaded guilty to
three counts in the embezzle
ment scheme, will not be sen
tenced until the trial of his two
co-defendants has concluded.
He admitted juggling bank rec
ords in a conspiracy with Smith
and Marshall as part of a plea
bargain in which Lewis agreed
to testify against the other two
men.
Also in August, Gene
Kawakami, former manager of
Wells Fargo's Miracle Mile
branch, pleaded guilty to one
count of misapplying $175,000
of the bank's funds by approv
ing a phoney loan application
which, in reality, transferred
the money to an account con
trolled by Kawakami.
Although Kawakami's indict
ment did not mention Smith or
the larger embezzlement case,

Allison, who is prosecuting the
Smith case, has said that the
cases are connected and that
Kawakami would be a witness
against Smith and Marshall.
In addition to the criminal
case, Wells Fargo has filed a
$46.3 million lawsuit against
Smith, Lewis, Marshall and oth
ers, seeking to recover the
$21.3 million plus $25 million in
punitive damages.
