# Card spikers spite Broncs, face SJS
## 
### Lisa Stern 
The Stanford women's volleyball team, coming off a 3-1 victory
over Santa Clara, will be back in action tomorrow night against the
San Jose State Spartans at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavillion.
The Cardinals overpowered Santa Clara on their home court
last Thursday evening, 15-1, 15-8, 0-15 and 15-4 to take the best
three-of-five game match.
The win gave the 20-9 Cards a 4-1 record in Northern California
Athletic Conference play and in this week's national ranking of
women's volleyball teams, the Stanford spikers are again rated
ninth in the NCAA.
Head coach Fred Sturm was pleased with his team's overall ef
fort in the one game road trip but he is still looking for consistency
from the unit.
"We were definitely at our best when our best was needed," he
said. "We played well enough to win the crucial points, which, I
think, is a good characteristic for any athletic team to have."
After resting the team last weekend, Sturm and asst. coach Don
Shaw have been preparing the squad for San Jose State by focus
ing principally on improved uniformity and game tactics.
"I want them (the players) to be prepared to play well at all
points during a game or during the match," Sturm explained.
The Spartans come into tomorrow night's match-up with an
even 10 wins and 10 losses on the season. Because SJS has com
piled a 3-2 record against conference rivals, the group is in a must
win situation if it is to be considered for post-season play.
San Jose is led by a strong coaching staff. Under the direction of
head coach Dick Montgomery, the Spartans beat nationally
ranked Northwestern as well as N0.5 Brigham Young University
last month. The two squads had both defeated Stanford earlier in
the season.
The Spartans will probably rely on the skilled leadership of set
ter Joyce Sprout and middle blocker Jody Breding. Both players
have added some consistency to the San Jose attack.
"San Jose really plays together well as a team," Sturm em
phasized in assessing his opponent's strengths. "They have really
improved since last year."
Stanford received news earlier this week that freshman middle
blocker Karen Lysaght will not be able to play tomorrow. Lysaght,
who came on strong off the bench for the Cards against Cal State-
Long Beach two weeks ago, will be out of action for at least four
weeks due to a sprained ankle she suffered in practice last week.
Coach Sturm believes his team will have to come on strong at
home to beat the Spartans.
"I always worry about a squad that really needs to win a game,"
he said, "so we'll still have to be prepared to play a very good
match."
