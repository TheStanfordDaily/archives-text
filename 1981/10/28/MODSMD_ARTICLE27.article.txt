# Sandoval takes 6th in marathon

### Mike Oneal 
He was once called "the greatest dis
tance runner in Stanford history" and Sun
day, Tony Sandoval showed why.
A 1976 graduate who now lives in Den
ver, Colo., Salazar kept up with a world
record pace and finished sixth in the New
York City Marathon with a time of 2:12.13,
four minutes behind top finisher and new
found world beater Alberto Salazar.
"We knew he was going to be good,"
said former Stanford coach Payton Jordan.
"He was good here, but he was a college
runner. He was young and with someone
like him, maturity will pay off. Nobody
worked harder or trained better."
Sandoval showed his potential early at
Stanford and capped an All-America ca
reer here with a senior effort right out of a

storybook.
On May 14, 1976, Sandoval became the
then Pacific-8 Conference 10,000-meter
champion by posting a major upset over
none other than world class superstar
Henry Rono. Rono at that time ran for The
University of Washington.
Seven days later, the native of Los
Alamos, N.M. missed qualifying for the
1976 LLS.Olympic team by finishing fourth
in the marathon trials held in Eugene, Ore.
Only the top three finishers were allowed
the trip to Montreal.
Sandoval made up for it though at the
1980 Olympic trials. That is, he partially
made up for it. He qualified first for the
marathon team that year but tragically
never made it to Moscow due to the US
boycott of those Games.

"He was the best in the country in his
senior year," Jordan said. "His upset of
Rono was quite a feat. He had the ability to
go out and push himself through the great
barriers that are in the way of running that
far — you have to take it to the limit and
then go farther. He was a courageous
runner — he simply loved to run. Some
times we had to hold him back."
Nobody held him back Sunday though
as he zipped to his sixth place finish behind
the man who shaved 20 seconds off the
world record with a time of 2:08.13.
Salazar, who resides in Eugene, had boldly
predicted that he would break the record.
He won the New York event last year by
beating Bill Rodgers, the marathon's four
year champion.
