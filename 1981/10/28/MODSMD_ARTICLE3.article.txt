# Computer expands library data access
## 
### Heather Millar 
University libraries acquired greater access to
bibliographical and cataloguing information Sept.
15 when they implemented Phase II of the Re
search Libraries Information Network (RUN II), ac
cording to James Myers, assistant director of tech
nical services.
However, since RUN II was implemented, librar
ians and researchers have been plagued by in
complete data and delayed, often faulty, computer
responses, said Meyers.
James Knox, assistant chief librarian of Green Li
brary's General Reference Department, said RLIN
has told library officials there will probably be
problems for the rest of this year, although it is
hoped many snags will be overcome in the next six
weeks.
Myers said that the present inconvenience
caused by the system is both "understandable and
worth it" in view of the power of the data available
through RLIN 11.

The Research Libraries Group (RLG), said Myers,
started the RLIN program in 1974, modeling RLIN
after Stanford's already existing computer system.
RLIN I linked the complete bibliographical and
cataloguing data-base of more than 25 RLG mem
bers nation-wide, Myers said. By logging onto a
computer here, according to Myers, RLIN I al
lowed the computer operator to trace a book to
any RLG library in the country.
According to Tina Kass, RLG director of library
systems and services, RLIN II reorganizes the near
ly 4 million records in the RLIN I data-base and ex
pands RLIN II by adding approximately 3 million
new records from member institutions' archives.
RLIN II also includes the installation of more so
phisticated cataloguing and acquisitions systems.
To install these networks,explained Kass, theen
tire system had to be shut down between August
24 and September 15. "We didn't have all the rec
ords in by September 15," she said "... we've
been spending all the time since adding records.

Having to load this data, said Myers, is at the root
of the reduced availability problem. The system is
now only operational on weekdays from 9:30 to 11
a.m. and from 2 to 6 p.m. Most of the remaining
computer time, said Myers, is spent loading files.
Compounding this problem, Myers said, RLG is
about eight weeks behind in loading Library of
Congress catalogues which supply approximately
60 percent of the catalogues available to Stanford.
As a result, said Myers, the library is holding books
in limbo, unused by patrons, until the catalogues
can be entered.
"The response time is the most frustrating
thing," said Knox.
According to Knox, the computer's response
time should be instantaneous, but that it often
stretches several minutes. "Sometimes, it gets so
bad you just get up and walk away," he said. How
ever Knox added, "Even before the changeover
