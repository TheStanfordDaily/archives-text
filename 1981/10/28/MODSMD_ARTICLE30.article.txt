# 5th-year senior starts for first time
## Vanelli is the man now

li seems that virtually ev
eryone at Stanford is painfully
aware of the misfortunes of the
football team this season. With
the exception of water polo
fans and loyal readers of the
Daily sports pages, however,
relatively few people know
that the Cardinal water polo
team is enjoying a spectacular
season that ranks with the best
in collegiate sporting history.
This is not really an unex
pected occurence, inasmuch
as the Cards are the defending
national champions and a vet
eran team with a collection of
talent comparable to the UCLA
basketball squads of the Lew
Alcindor and Bill Walton eras.
Led by All-Americas Jody
Campbell, James Bergeson,
Alan Mouchawar and Chris
Kelsey, the Stanford water
poloists have racked up 20
straight victories and are over
whelmingly favored to suc
cessfully defend their cham
pionship trophy next month at
the national tournament in
Long Beach.
The outstanding play of goal
ie Vince Vanelli has been an
important factor in the team's
success. A fifth-year student
completing a co-terminal pro
gram in industrial engineering,
Vanelli is starting on a regular
basis for the first time this sea
son after four years (one as a
redshirt) of playing in the im
posing shadow of four-time
All-America John Gansel.
Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti is undoubtedly
pleased that the ease with
which the Cards have beaten
their opponents apparently has
not engendered much over
confidence, at least not in his
goalie.
"Initially we expected to do
this well," said Vanelli, "but a
team can't rest on its laurels.
We have had one close game,
and I think that now we know
we're going to have to suck it

up in order to win."
Although he is confident
that Stanford can maintain its
perfect record through the
NCAA finals, Vanelli noted that
he has "never seen a Nationals
where a team has rolled over
every other team. There's vir
tually always a close game, and
we can't afford to take anybody
for granted."
Vanelli cited experience as
the main reason for the team's
great season. "We have prima
rily seniors on the starting
team," he said. "And nearly all
of them have had four years of
playing experience with a good
team."
Next year, however, Vanelli
and most of the other starters
will have graduated. Never
theless, he is extremely op
timistic about the team's future
following his departure.
"It's deceptive to say that we
have six graduating seniors be
cause the team next year is
going to be very, very strong,"
he pointed out. "We couldn't
say that it will be as strong as
this year's team, but I think it
will be strong enough to win
the NCAA's. We've got some
really top players, some good
redshirts coming back, and
Dante's had a good recruiting
year. I think we'll do quite
well."
Vanelli is similarly optimistic
about the future of freshman
Steve Moyer, his expected re
placement at goalie. "I think
Moyer is as good as I am," he
said. "He hasn't played as long,
but by next year he'll be great."
Vanelli's former status as
John Gansel's backup was very
similar to the situation encoun
tered by a quarterback named
Babe Laufenberg who signed a
letter of intent to play football
at Stanford three years ago.
Eventually he correctly sur
mised that he wouldn't get
much playing time as the
backup quarterback to John
Elway, and left the Farm.
When asked if he had ever

considered transferring to a
school where he could play
regularly, Vanelli replied: "The
reason I came to Stanford was
to go to school here. Water
polo was sort of a means to an
end. The thought of trans
ferring to another school never
crossed my mind."
Vanelli also praised his pred
ecessor, whom he described as
"a great guy and an amazing
goalie. No one ever doubted
my ability to play the goal, John
just happens to be a superior
athlete," he added.
Vanelli modestly gives credit
for his goaltending success to
his teammates. "The reason I
do well in water polo," he
stated, "is because of our per
sonnel. Our team plays ex
tremely good defense, so I can
look good with a team like this
in front of me."
Vanelli plans to go to work
after receiving his graduate
degree in Industrial Engineer
ing, but has no intention of
continuing his water polo ca
reer. Right now, he is looking
forward to the NCAA tour
nament and his chance to help
the Cards win another cham
pionship.
"It is really good for him that
he gets a chance to play on a
team that will hopefully be a
collegiate champion," said
Dettamanti. "He deserves it,
because he's put in a lot of
years, a lot of time and effort.
Vince has a chance to make All-
America this year ... I think
he's one of the best goalies in
collegiate water polo right
now."
After waiting patiently for
four years, backing up the man
whom Dettmanti called "prob
ably the best goalie in the
world," Vanelli has finally been
given the chance to display his
talent as Stanford's starting
goalie. His last season has so far
been ideal from both a team
and an individual standpoint,
and he will tell you that it was
definitely worth the wait.
