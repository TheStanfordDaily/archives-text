# Marathon champ Salazar angry at TAC
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Alberto Salazar, world
record holder in the marathon, in an un
characteristic display, has vented his anger
on The Athletic Congress, the governing
body for track and field in the United
States.
"I would rather get prize money directly
under-the-table than accepting it over
the-table and having to put it in a trust
fund with TAC," Salazar said Monday, one
day after setting the world mark with a
time of 2 hours, 8 minutes, 13 seconds in
the New York City Marathon.
By taking it under-the-table — a long
standing practice that has been publicly ig
nored by TAC and the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, the world
governing body for the sport — athletes do
not have to put the money in escrow or a
trust fund, as some of those openly accept
ing prize money have done.
A prime example was New Zealander Al
lison Roe, women's winner of Sunday's
New York City Marathon in 2:25:29, a

world mark for women. She had received
$4000 for finishing second in the Cascade
Run-Off at Portland, Ore. June 28. The 15-
kilometer road race was under the aus
pices of the Association for Road Racing
Athletes, a rebel professional group.
Roe was suspended, meaning she was
ineligible to participate in international
competition or the Olympic Games. But
she then agreed to put the $4000 into a
trust fund supervised by the New Zealand
Federation, and her amateur eligibility was
restored.
Meanwhile, two other long-distance
runners, Herb Lindsay of the United States
and Rod Dixon, a native New Zealander
now living in the United States have
agreed to put their prize money from
ARRA races into escrow accounts.
A TAC spokesman said the accounts
were "between the athletes and us. If the
lAAF decides at its meeting in Rome Dec.
12-13 that the money can be used for train
ing purposes, then the money will be put
into a trust fund."

Salazar, labeling TAC "hypocrites and
thieves," said he wants no part of trust
funds.
Ollan Cassell, executive director of TAC,
was supposed to attend a new conference
Monday following a meeting of interna
tional marathon race directors. But he
failed to show.
The University of Oregon graduate said
he was in favor of open racing.
"The athletes want it. Everybody wants
it. That's the way it should be," he said.
"What are we supposed to do: live like
bums?" Salazar said.
Fred Lebow, race director of the New
York City Marathon, said that the mara
thon directors were in favor of open com
petition.
Meanwhile, the under-the-table
payments will continue. Salazar reportedly
received $14,000 for his New York City
Marathon victory and Roe collected an es
timated $10,000.
