AWACS sale gains more votes
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
switched three opponents and picked up five
other votes from among the uncommitted yes
terday in a major gain for his fight to rescue an
$8.5 billion Saudi arms sale from Senate defeat.
The gains put the president within four votes
of a come-from-behind victory for the sale of
AWACS radar planes and F-15 jet fighter weap
onry.
The latest Associated Press count had 52 sena
tors declared against the sale, 46 announced or
leaning in favor, and two undecided.
Switching in favor of the sale were Sen. Roger
Jepsen (R-lowa) who had been a declared op
ponent, and Sens. Charles Grassley (R-lowa)
and J. James Exon (D-Neb.) both of whom had
been leaning against it.
Five senators who had been uncommitted
came out in favor of the sale yesterday. They
were: Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Harrison Schmitt (D-
N.M.), Walter Huddleston (D-Ky.), David Boren
(D-Okla.), and Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).
At the White House, Reagan lobbied senators
individually for the second day in a row yester
day and his chief spokesman said the president
was "very encouraged" by the day's develop
ments.
Solidarity plans strike today
Warsaw, Poland— Solidarity defiantly went
ahead with plans for a one-hour, nationwide
strike today over food shortages and other
problems. The Polish Communist Party's Cen
tral Committee and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
were reported preparing separate meetings.
Lech Walesa, leader of the independent labor
movement, had been expected to hold talks
with government officials yesterday, apparently
in hopes of heading off the walkout. But union
sources said he had not met any officials, and
that the nationwide protest would go ahead as
planned at noon.
The government information agency In
terpress said Polish troops were taking up posi
tions in villages and towns and their initial re
ception was "friendly."
Communist Party officials said the 200-mem
ber Central Committee would meet just ho.urs
after the strike, the biggest since a four-hour,
national walkout March 27. They said Gen. Wo
jciech JaruzelSki, the party chief, defense min
ister and prime minister, might reshuffle the
Cabinet or Communist Party Politburo.
The Hungarian news agency MTI said the
Warsaw Pact defense ministers would meet
soon in Budapest, Hungary. MTI did not give a
date but there have been fears of Soviet in
tervention in Poland ever since Solidarity was
created 14 months ago as the first union free of
party control in the Soviet bloc.
The Polish protest is expected to idle millions
of workers, and has been condemned by the
government and party as threatening Poland's
Apolitical, economic and defensive" founda
tions. It has also sparked protests from state-run
unions who vowed to work.
Persian Gulf base planned
Washington— In a dramatic expansion of the
"Carter Doctrine," which promised a U.S. re
sponse to any threat to the Persian Gulf, the
Reagan administration plans to build a military
force capable of unilaterally defendingtheGulf
region from a full-scale Soviet attack.
The administration is committed to deterring
such an attack, which it views as "the most dan
gerous potential threat to U.S. interests in the
region," according to documents released
Monday by the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
The administration's statements imply that
despite efforts to reach a regional "strategic
consensus" against a Soviet threat, the United

States is prepared to defend the gulf region
without significant assistance from either North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies or friendly
Gulf nations.
The commitment to defend the Gulf region
against any Soviet land invasion would require a
military capability vastly larger than now pro
vided by the Rapid Deployment Force, which
was designed to react to smaller conflicts.
The administration has not indicated how
much additional military spending the plan
would require, but it said first estimates would
be provided when the proposed defense
budget for fiscal year 1983 is given to Congress
in January.
Senate says scrap CIA proposal
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee urged the Reagan administration yester
day to scrap its proposal to let the CIA infiltrate
and try to influence U.S. organizations.
After a one-hour closed meeting, Committee
Chairman Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said the
panel unanimously agreed to recommend that
the administration retain the almost complete
ban on CIA infiltration of U.S. groups imposed
by then-President JimmyCarterin January'l97B.
"The CIA is designed to do foreign in
telligence, period," Vice Chairman Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said after the meeting.
Goldwater and Moynihan also announced
that the committee staff had completed gather
ing information in its investigation of CIA Direc
tor William Casey and would write a report,
which will be made public.
Goldwater said, "No basis has been found for
concluding that Casev is unfit to serve as direc
tor of central intelligence." But Moynihan said,
"The ultimate findings will await theconclusion
of that report." They said they could not predict
when that report would be finished.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson had no com
ment on the committee action, but a Reagan of
ficial, who declined to be identified, said last
week the administration was committed to stu
dying any recommendations the panel makes
even though Reagan has the authority to sign it
on his own.
The committee has been reviewing a draft
presidential order governing intelligence agen
cies which was prepared by the Reagan admin
istration as a replacement for Carter's order.
The Reagan draft, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Associated Press, would have giv
en the CIA authority, for the first time, to in
filtrate and secretly try to influence the activity
of domestic groups.
Meese defends planned cuts
San Francisco Presidential counselor Edwin
Meese 111 defended Reagan administration
plans to cut government-supported legal ser
vices to the poor and elderly yesterday by
saying that third-year law students and young
but unestablished attorneys could take up the
slack.
Meese suggested that the young lawyers
donate their time under the supervision of
more experienced attorneys in private practice
who "cannot afford to take time out... to deal
with direct legal services to the indigent" and
contended that such a move would "expand le
gal services to the poor a thousandfold."
Meese's comments were contained in a
speech dedicating a new law library at the Uni
versity of California's Hastings College of the
Law.
While he spoke, an estimated 300 chanting,
whistle-blowing demonstrators paraded in oc
casional showers on the street outside the
school's auditorium, banging on windows in an
effort to disrupt the speech and holding aloft
placards critical of both Meese and President
Ronald Reagan. Some contained profanity, and
one read, "If Meese Is For The Public Interest,

Then Ketchup Is a Vegetable."
The protest was largely in response to the ad
ministration's legal services cutbacks but some
of the hand-lettered signs indicated other
causes, and there also were several striking air
traffic controllers in evidence.
"Ed Meese represents the idea that govern
ment is for the rich, that the purpose of govern
ment is to protect the rich from the poor," said
Doron Weinberg, who described himself as a
leader of the "Hastings Anti-Meese Coalition."
He said no students were consulted on the
choice of Meese as speaker for the law library
dedication.
Policy for Chad may change
Washington— The Reagan administration is
reconsidering its tacit support of rebel forces in
Chad and may join France in backing the gov
ernment of President Goukouni Oueddei on
condition that a Libyan force of some 10,000
men withdraw.
This policy reassessment, State Department
spokesman Dean Fischer said yesterday, was
begun following a French initiative last week to
persuade the Organization of African Unity to
send a peace-keeping force to Chad to replace
the Libyan contingent, which initially in
tervened last year on Goukouni's side.
More recently, Libyan leader Moammar
Quadaffi has been threatening to back a rival of
Goukouni, Foreign Minister Ahmed Acyl, if
Goukouni continues to balk at the merger be
tween Chad and Libya that Quadaffi tried to
force on Chad last year.
In the immediate aftermath of the assassina
tion of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat earlier
this month, the Reagan administration issued a
statement of support for Egypt's closest ally, the
Sudan, which appeared to be threatened by
border attacks by Libyan forces in Chad. Plans
were announced to rush military equipment to
Sudan under an "emergency procedure."
Finnish President resigns
Helsinki — Finland witnessed the end of an
era yesterday as President Urho Kekkonen, at
81, announced his resignation for health rea
sons.
The Finnish statesman ruled this northern Eu
ropean country for 25 years, longer than any
president before him. In the eyes of the young
er generation, he embodies the very history of
Finland.
Kekkonen has come to be his country's sym
bol of peace and detente. He proposed a status
of neutrality for all of Scandanavia and em
braced the idea of a nuclear free zone in
northern Europe.
Kekkonen crowned his achievements in for
eign policy, which he considered the most im
portant aspect of politics, with the 1975 Helsinki
Agreement on security and cooperation in Eu
rope signed by 35 nations.

Warsaw, Poland— Solidarity defiantly went
ahead with plans for a one-hour, nationwide
strike today over food shortages and other
problems. The Polish Communist Party's Cen
tral Committee and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
were reported preparing separate meetings.
Lech Walesa, leader of the independent labor
movement, had been expected to hold talks
with government officials yesterday, apparently
in hopes of heading off the walkout. But union
sources said he had not met any officials, and
that the nationwide protest would go ahead as
planned at noon.
The government information agency In
terpress said Polish troops were taking up posi
tions in villages and towns and their initial re
ception was "friendly."
Communist Party officials said the 200-mem
ber Central Committee would meet just ho.urs
after the strike, the biggest since a four-hour,
national walkout March 27. They said Gen. Wo
jciech JaruzelSki, the party chief, defense min
ister and prime minister, might reshuffle the
Cabinet or Communist Party Politburo.
The Hungarian news agency MTI said the
Warsaw Pact defense ministers would meet
soon in Budapest, Hungary. MTI did not give a
date but there have been fears of Soviet in
tervention in Poland ever since Solidarity was
created 14 months ago as the first union free of
party control in the Soviet bloc.
The Polish protest is expected to idle millions
of workers, and has been condemned by the
government and party as threatening Poland's
Apolitical, economic and defensive" founda
tions. It has also sparked protests from state-run
unions who vowed to work.
Persian Gulf base planned
Washington— In a dramatic expansion of the
"Carter Doctrine," which promised a U.S. re
sponse to any threat to the Persian Gulf, the
Reagan administration plans to build a military
force capable of unilaterally defendingtheGulf
region from a full-scale Soviet attack.
The administration is committed to deterring
such an attack, which it views as "the most dan
gerous potential threat to U.S. interests in the
region," according to documents released
Monday by the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
The administration's statements imply that
despite efforts to reach a regional "strategic
consensus" against a Soviet threat, the United

States is prepared to defend the gulf region
without significant assistance from either North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies or friendly
Gulf nations.
The commitment to defend the Gulf region
against any Soviet land invasion would require a
military capability vastly larger than now pro
vided by the Rapid Deployment Force, which
was designed to react to smaller conflicts.
The administration has not indicated how
much additional military spending the plan
would require, but it said first estimates would
be provided when the proposed defense
budget for fiscal year 1983 is given to Congress
in January.
Senate says scrap CIA proposal
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee urged the Reagan administration yester
day to scrap its proposal to let the CIA infiltrate
and try to influence U.S. organizations.
After a one-hour closed meeting, Committee
Chairman Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said the
panel unanimously agreed to recommend that
the administration retain the almost complete
ban on CIA infiltration of U.S. groups imposed
by then-President JimmyCarterin January'l97B.
"The CIA is designed to do foreign in
telligence, period," Vice Chairman Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said after the meeting.
Goldwater and Moynihan also announced
that the committee staff had completed gather
ing information in its investigation of CIA Direc
tor William Casey and would write a report,
which will be made public.
Goldwater said, "No basis has been found for
concluding that Casev is unfit to serve as direc
tor of central intelligence." But Moynihan said,
"The ultimate findings will await theconclusion
of that report." They said they could not predict
when that report would be finished.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson had no com
ment on the committee action, but a Reagan of
ficial, who declined to be identified, said last
week the administration was committed to stu
dying any recommendations the panel makes
even though Reagan has the authority to sign it
on his own.
The committee has been reviewing a draft
presidential order governing intelligence agen
cies which was prepared by the Reagan admin
istration as a replacement for Carter's order.
The Reagan draft, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Associated Press, would have giv
en the CIA authority, for the first time, to in
filtrate and secretly try to influence the activity
of domestic groups.
Meese defends planned cuts
San Francisco Presidential counselor Edwin
Meese 111 defended Reagan administration
plans to cut government-supported legal ser
vices to the poor and elderly yesterday by
saying that third-year law students and young
but unestablished attorneys could take up the
slack.
Meese suggested that the young lawyers
donate their time under the supervision of
more experienced attorneys in private practice
who "cannot afford to take time out... to deal
with direct legal services to the indigent" and
contended that such a move would "expand le
gal services to the poor a thousandfold."
Meese's comments were contained in a
speech dedicating a new law library at the Uni
versity of California's Hastings College of the
Law.
While he spoke, an estimated 300 chanting,
whistle-blowing demonstrators paraded in oc
casional showers on the street outside the
school's auditorium, banging on windows in an
effort to disrupt the speech and holding aloft
placards critical of both Meese and President
Ronald Reagan. Some contained profanity, and
one read, "If Meese Is For The Public Interest,

Then Ketchup Is a Vegetable."
The protest was largely in response to the ad
ministration's legal services cutbacks but some
of the hand-lettered signs indicated other
causes, and there also were several striking air
traffic controllers in evidence.
"Ed Meese represents the idea that govern
ment is for the rich, that the purpose of govern
ment is to protect the rich from the poor," said
Doron Weinberg, who described himself as a
leader of the "Hastings Anti-Meese Coalition."
He said no students were consulted on the
choice of Meese as speaker for the law library
dedication.
Policy for Chad may change
Washington— The Reagan administration is
reconsidering its tacit support of rebel forces in
Chad and may join France in backing the gov
ernment of President Goukouni Oueddei on
condition that a Libyan force of some 10,000
men withdraw.
This policy reassessment, State Department
spokesman Dean Fischer said yesterday, was
begun following a French initiative last week to
persuade the Organization of African Unity to
send a peace-keeping force to Chad to replace
the Libyan contingent, which initially in
tervened last year on Goukouni's side.
More recently, Libyan leader Moammar
Quadaffi has been threatening to back a rival of
Goukouni, Foreign Minister Ahmed Acyl, if
Goukouni continues to balk at the merger be
tween Chad and Libya that Quadaffi tried to
force on Chad last year.
In the immediate aftermath of the assassina
tion of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat earlier
this month, the Reagan administration issued a
statement of support for Egypt's closest ally, the
Sudan, which appeared to be threatened by
border attacks by Libyan forces in Chad. Plans
were announced to rush military equipment to
Sudan under an "emergency procedure."
Finnish President resigns
Helsinki — Finland witnessed the end of an
era yesterday as President Urho Kekkonen, at
81, announced his resignation for health rea
sons.
The Finnish statesman ruled this northern Eu
ropean country for 25 years, longer than any
president before him. In the eyes of the young
er generation, he embodies the very history of
Finland.
Kekkonen has come to be his country's sym
bol of peace and detente. He proposed a status
of neutrality for all of Scandanavia and em
braced the idea of a nuclear free zone in
northern Europe.
Kekkonen crowned his achievements in for
eign policy, which he considered the most im
portant aspect of politics, with the 1975 Helsinki
Agreement on security and cooperation in Eu
rope signed by 35 nations.

AWACS sale gains more votes
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
switched three opponents and picked up five
other votes from among the uncommitted yes
terday in a major gain for his fight to rescue an
$8.5 billion Saudi arms sale from Senate defeat.
The gains put the president within four votes
of a come-from-behind victory for the sale of
AWACS radar planes and F-15 jet fighter weap
onry.
The latest Associated Press count had 52 sena
tors declared against the sale, 46 announced or
leaning in favor, and two undecided.
Switching in favor of the sale were Sen. Roger
Jepsen (R-lowa) who had been a declared op
ponent, and Sens. Charles Grassley (R-lowa)
and J. James Exon (D-Neb.) both of whom had
been leaning against it.
Five senators who had been uncommitted
came out in favor of the sale yesterday. They
were: Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Harrison Schmitt (D-
N.M.), Walter Huddleston (D-Ky.), David Boren
(D-Okla.), and Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).
At the White House, Reagan lobbied senators
individually for the second day in a row yester
day and his chief spokesman said the president
was "very encouraged" by the day's develop

unions who vowed to work.
Persian Gulf base planned
Washington— In a dramatic expansion of the
"Carter Doctrine," which promised a U.S. re
sponse to any threat to the Persian Gulf, the
Reagan administration plans to build a military
force capable of unilaterally defendingtheGulf
region from a full-scale Soviet attack.
The administration is committed to deterring
such an attack, which it views as "the most dan
gerous potential threat to U.S. interests in the
region," according to documents released
Monday by the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
The administration's statements imply that
despite efforts to reach a regional "strategic
consensus" against a Soviet threat, the United

States is prepared to defend the gulf region
without significant assistance from either North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies or friendly
Gulf nations.
The commitment to defend the Gulf region
against any Soviet land invasion would require a
military capability vastly larger than now pro
vided by the Rapid Deployment Force, which
was designed to react to smaller conflicts.
The administration has not indicated how
much additional military spending the plan
would require, but it said first estimates would
be provided when the proposed defense
budget for fiscal year 1983 is given to Congress
in January.
Senate says scrap CIA proposal
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee urged the Reagan administration yester
day to scrap its proposal to let the CIA infiltrate
and try to influence U.S. organizations.
After a one-hour closed meeting, Committee
Chairman Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said the
panel unanimously agreed to recommend that
the administration retain the almost complete
ban on CIA infiltration of U.S. groups imposed
by then-President JimmyCarterin January'l97B.
"The CIA is designed to do foreign in
telligence, period," Vice Chairman Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said after the meeting.
Goldwater and Moynihan also announced
that the committee staff had completed gather
ing information in its investigation of CIA Direc
tor William Casey and would write a report,
which will be made public.
Goldwater said, "No basis has been found for
concluding that Casev is unfit to serve as direc
tor of central intelligence." But Moynihan said,
"The ultimate findings will await theconclusion
of that report." They said they could not predict
when that report would be finished.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson had no com
ment on the committee action, but a Reagan of
ficial, who declined to be identified, said last
week the administration was committed to stu
dying any recommendations the panel makes
even though Reagan has the authority to sign it
on his own.
The committee has been reviewing a draft
presidential order governing intelligence agen
cies which was prepared by the Reagan admin
istration as a replacement for Carter's order.
The Reagan draft, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Associated Press, would have giv
en the CIA authority, for the first time, to in
filtrate and secretly try to influence the activity
of domestic groups.
Meese defends planned cuts
San Francisco Presidential counselor Edwin
Meese 111 defended Reagan administration
plans to cut government-supported legal ser
vices to the poor and elderly yesterday by
saying that third-year law students and young
but unestablished attorneys could take up the
slack.
Meese suggested that the young lawyers
donate their time under the supervision of
more experienced attorneys in private practice
who "cannot afford to take time out... to deal
with direct legal services to the indigent" and
contended that such a move would "expand le
gal services to the poor a thousandfold."
Meese's comments were contained in a
speech dedicating a new law library at the Uni
versity of California's Hastings College of the
Law.
While he spoke, an estimated 300 chanting,
whistle-blowing demonstrators paraded in oc
casional showers on the street outside the
school's auditorium, banging on windows in an
effort to disrupt the speech and holding aloft
placards critical of both Meese and President
Ronald Reagan. Some contained profanity, and
one read, "If Meese Is For The Public Interest,

Then Ketchup Is a Vegetable."
The protest was largely in response to the ad
ministration's legal services cutbacks but some
of the hand-lettered signs indicated other
causes, and there also were several striking air
traffic controllers in evidence.
"Ed Meese represents the idea that govern
ment is for the rich, that the purpose of govern
ment is to protect the rich from the poor," said
Doron Weinberg, who described himself as a
leader of the "Hastings Anti-Meese Coalition."
He said no students were consulted on the
choice of Meese as speaker for the law library
dedication.
Policy for Chad may change
Washington— The Reagan administration is
reconsidering its tacit support of rebel forces in
Chad and may join France in backing the gov
ernment of President Goukouni Oueddei on
condition that a Libyan force of some 10,000
men withdraw.
This policy reassessment, State Department
spokesman Dean Fischer said yesterday, was
begun following a French initiative last week to
persuade the Organization of African Unity to
send a peace-keeping force to Chad to replace
the Libyan contingent, which initially in
tervened last year on Goukouni's side.
More recently, Libyan leader Moammar
Quadaffi has been threatening to back a rival of
Goukouni, Foreign Minister Ahmed Acyl, if
Goukouni continues to balk at the merger be
tween Chad and Libya that Quadaffi tried to
force on Chad last year.
In the immediate aftermath of the assassina
tion of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat earlier
this month, the Reagan administration issued a
statement of support for Egypt's closest ally, the
Sudan, which appeared to be threatened by
border attacks by Libyan forces in Chad. Plans
were announced to rush military equipment to
Sudan under an "emergency procedure."
Finnish President resigns
Helsinki — Finland witnessed the end of an
era yesterday as President Urho Kekkonen, at
81, announced his resignation for health rea
sons.
The Finnish statesman ruled this northern Eu
ropean country for 25 years, longer than any
president before him. In the eyes of the young
er generation, he embodies the very history of
Finland.
Kekkonen has come to be his country's sym
bol of peace and detente. He proposed a status
of neutrality for all of Scandanavia and em
braced the idea of a nuclear free zone in
northern Europe.
Kekkonen crowned his achievements in for
eign policy, which he considered the most im
portant aspect of politics, with the 1975 Helsinki
Agreement on security and cooperation in Eu
rope signed by 35 nations.

AWACS sale gains more votes
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
switched three opponents and picked up five
other votes from among the uncommitted yes
terday in a major gain for his fight to rescue an
$8.5 billion Saudi arms sale from Senate defeat.
The gains put the president within four votes
of a come-from-behind victory for the sale of
AWACS radar planes and F-15 jet fighter weap
onry.
The latest Associated Press count had 52 sena
tors declared against the sale, 46 announced or
leaning in favor, and two undecided.
Switching in favor of the sale were Sen. Roger
Jepsen (R-lowa) who had been a declared op
ponent, and Sens. Charles Grassley (R-lowa)
and J. James Exon (D-Neb.) both of whom had
been leaning against it.
Five senators who had been uncommitted
came out in favor of the sale yesterday. They
were: Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Harrison Schmitt (D-
N.M.), Walter Huddleston (D-Ky.), David Boren
(D-Okla.), and Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).
At the White House, Reagan lobbied senators
individually for the second day in a row yester
day and his chief spokesman said the president
was "very encouraged" by the day's develop
ments.
Solidarity plans strike today
Warsaw, Poland— Solidarity defiantly went
ahead with plans for a one-hour, nationwide
strike today over food shortages and other
problems. The Polish Communist Party's Cen
tral Committee and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
were reported preparing separate meetings.
Lech Walesa, leader of the independent labor
movement, had been expected to hold talks
with government officials yesterday, apparently
in hopes of heading off the walkout. But union
sources said he had not met any officials, and
that the nationwide protest would go ahead as
planned at noon.
The government information agency In
terpress said Polish troops were taking up posi
tions in villages and towns and their initial re
ception was "friendly."
Communist Party officials said the 200-mem
ber Central Committee would meet just ho.urs
after the strike, the biggest since a four-hour,
national walkout March 27. They said Gen. Wo
jciech JaruzelSki, the party chief, defense min
ister and prime minister, might reshuffle the
Cabinet or Communist Party Politburo.
The Hungarian news agency MTI said the
Warsaw Pact defense ministers would meet
soon in Budapest, Hungary. MTI did not give a
date but there have been fears of Soviet in
tervention in Poland ever since Solidarity was
created 14 months ago as the first union free of
party control in the Soviet bloc.
The Polish protest is expected to idle millions
of workers, and has been condemned by the
government and party as threatening Poland's
Apolitical, economic and defensive" founda
tions. It has also sparked protests from state-run
unions who vowed to work.

day to scrap its proposal to let the CIA infiltrate
and try to influence U.S. organizations.
After a one-hour closed meeting, Committee
Chairman Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said the
panel unanimously agreed to recommend that
the administration retain the almost complete
ban on CIA infiltration of U.S. groups imposed
by then-President JimmyCarterin January'l97B.
"The CIA is designed to do foreign in
telligence, period," Vice Chairman Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said after the meeting.
Goldwater and Moynihan also announced
that the committee staff had completed gather
ing information in its investigation of CIA Direc
tor William Casey and would write a report,
which will be made public.
Goldwater said, "No basis has been found for
concluding that Casev is unfit to serve as direc
tor of central intelligence." But Moynihan said,
"The ultimate findings will await theconclusion
of that report." They said they could not predict
when that report would be finished.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson had no com
ment on the committee action, but a Reagan of
ficial, who declined to be identified, said last
week the administration was committed to stu
dying any recommendations the panel makes
even though Reagan has the authority to sign it
on his own.
The committee has been reviewing a draft
presidential order governing intelligence agen
cies which was prepared by the Reagan admin
istration as a replacement for Carter's order.
The Reagan draft, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Associated Press, would have giv
en the CIA authority, for the first time, to in
filtrate and secretly try to influence the activity
of domestic groups.
Meese defends planned cuts
San Francisco Presidential counselor Edwin
Meese 111 defended Reagan administration
plans to cut government-supported legal ser
vices to the poor and elderly yesterday by
saying that third-year law students and young
but unestablished attorneys could take up the
slack.
Meese suggested that the young lawyers
donate their time under the supervision of
more experienced attorneys in private practice
who "cannot afford to take time out... to deal
with direct legal services to the indigent" and
contended that such a move would "expand le
gal services to the poor a thousandfold."
Meese's comments were contained in a
speech dedicating a new law library at the Uni
versity of California's Hastings College of the
Law.
While he spoke, an estimated 300 chanting,
whistle-blowing demonstrators paraded in oc
casional showers on the street outside the
school's auditorium, banging on windows in an
effort to disrupt the speech and holding aloft
placards critical of both Meese and President
Ronald Reagan. Some contained profanity, and
one read, "If Meese Is For The Public Interest,

Then Ketchup Is a Vegetable."
The protest was largely in response to the ad
ministration's legal services cutbacks but some
of the hand-lettered signs indicated other
causes, and there also were several striking air
traffic controllers in evidence.
"Ed Meese represents the idea that govern
ment is for the rich, that the purpose of govern
ment is to protect the rich from the poor," said
Doron Weinberg, who described himself as a
leader of the "Hastings Anti-Meese Coalition."
He said no students were consulted on the
choice of Meese as speaker for the law library
dedication.
Policy for Chad may change
Washington— The Reagan administration is
reconsidering its tacit support of rebel forces in
Chad and may join France in backing the gov
ernment of President Goukouni Oueddei on
condition that a Libyan force of some 10,000
men withdraw.
This policy reassessment, State Department
spokesman Dean Fischer said yesterday, was
begun following a French initiative last week to
persuade the Organization of African Unity to
send a peace-keeping force to Chad to replace
the Libyan contingent, which initially in
tervened last year on Goukouni's side.
More recently, Libyan leader Moammar
Quadaffi has been threatening to back a rival of
Goukouni, Foreign Minister Ahmed Acyl, if
Goukouni continues to balk at the merger be
tween Chad and Libya that Quadaffi tried to
force on Chad last year.
In the immediate aftermath of the assassina
tion of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat earlier
this month, the Reagan administration issued a
statement of support for Egypt's closest ally, the
Sudan, which appeared to be threatened by
border attacks by Libyan forces in Chad. Plans
were announced to rush military equipment to
Sudan under an "emergency procedure."
Finnish President resigns

era yesterday as President Urho Kekkonen, at

sons.
The Finnish statesman ruled this northern Eu
ropean country for 25 years, longer than any
president before him. In the eyes of the young
er generation, he embodies the very history of
Finland.
Kekkonen has come to be his country's sym

of neutrality for all of Scandanavia and em
braced the idea of a nuclear free zone in

portant aspect of politics, with the 1975 Helsinki
