# Clericals say University pressure defeated union
## 
### Jeffrey Golden (Second in a series) 
to an earlier section of this story
published last week, Jeffrey Golden
delved into reactions to last spring's
clerical workers' union election and
found the issue far from resolved:
many concerns motivating the elec
tion still beset the University.
Although workers voted 930-554
not to affiliate themselves with Unit
ed Stanford Employees (USE) Union
Local 715, some clerical workers —
both opposing and favoring the
union — doubt the University will
address their grievances.
Low wage scales, job security, child
care, and improved working condi
tions were some issues that
prompted the often bitter election,
but the 1100 statements of interest in
a union filed last November
dwindled to half that number of pro
union votes.
Non-controversial reasons and
problems with USE prompted much
of the decline, but many union or
ganizers charge the University ad
ministration conducted a
purposefully anti-union effort. The
union was soundly defeated, but the
anti-union plurality is far from an in
dication that workers are pleased
with the conduct and outcome of the
election.

"They made it very difficult," said Jill Coelho, a
Green Library employee, "and very, very fright
ening."
Coelho, one of 12 members of an interim operating
committee of clerical workers that formed when the
Office Staff Organization Committee (OSOC) dis
banded last July, was referring to what she considered
a University-led anti-union campaign.
Her committee is now charged with writing a set of
by-laws and studying the question of how campus
worker organizations should relate to Union Local
715 in the future.
"Except for the people over in SLAC and those of us
in the libraries, most people are isolated in different
departments, so we had trouble really getting togeth
er. The University had a direct line to everyone and
believe me, they used it."
Coelho and others charged that the supervisors
held meetings "for hours and hours" during the work
day to discuss methods of countering union senti
ment, and that through the supervisors the University
put insistent organized pressure on the more passive
clericals to vote on the day of the election. She
charged the claim cannot be documented because
those involved are unwilling to register formal com
plaints.
Reports of harrassment and directed pressure were
the substance of several of the 18 election violation
charges that Local 715 filed with NLRB after the May
vote. Thirteen of those complaints had to be
withdrawn when the purported intimidation victims
refused to endorse the charges publicly, according to
715 organizer Kathy McKennan.
"They really came at us hard," McKennan said.
"We were so busy trying to teach people the most
basic things about what union is and how it works that
we just didn't have time to prepare them for an anti
union campaign like the one Stanford put on us
The five surviving violation charges dealt with Uni
versity flyers and announcements during the cam
paign. University President Donald Kennedy issued a
number of statements calling the "tense and hostile
atmosphere" that existing campus unions had in

troduced as "especially damaging to the working en
vironment." The administration then began to issue a
series of six topical bulletins that asserted unions take
more power from their members than they give and
that University pay scales and grievance procedures
were already superior to any that the union could of
fer.
Local 715 cited these bulletins as the basis for more
formal charges, claiming they constituted the kind of
unfair propaganda that NLRB regulations prohibit
during the "critical period" between blue card
certification and the election itself.
A University spokesman characterized the bulletins
as relevant information that was necessary "to allow
the workers to make an informed choice." During the
summer the NLRB decided this issue in favor of the
University, declaring the bulletins legitimate cam
paign material and throwing out the union com
plaints.
At the same time, the Board validated another
union charge and agreed to hold an election violation
hearing on it March 23. The question centers on an
article in the Campus Report of last March 11 that an
nounced wage increases of 12-22 percent for the
clerical workers. At the time, Joyce Tipps-Coates of
OSOC called the promise "a blatant attempt to in
fluence the election" and "unfair labor practice." In
retrospect she believes it "bought off" many workers
who otherwise would have voted for the union.
Stanford Manager of Employee Relations Felix
Barthelemy denied the wage announcement was
made for strategic reasons. "It was absolutely consis
tent with the way we've always done it," Barthelemy
said, noting that wage projections have been pub
lished in spring issues of Campus Report for many
years.
When asked why the raise was so much higher this
year (since 1975, the Campus Report has announced
ranges of wage increases that always have a bottom
end of 0 percent), Barthelemy said the 1981/82 raise
was determined long before the election campaign.
Kennedy also denied any tie between campaign
considerations and the raise, saying, "the package is
the result of our struggling with our market position."

UNION ELECTION — University clerical workers voted last spring
not to unionize, and some workers claim that pressure by the aa
ministration had a major impact on the outcome of the election.
If the NLRB rules next spring that
the wage announcement was an un
fair election ploy it could overthrow
last May's results and schedule a new
election. Given the normal waiting
periods involved, the clericals could
be voting again on union affiliation in
a year's time.
But no one is predicting that the
result would be fundamentally dif
ferent. "We could give them a run for
their money," said 715's McKennan.
"Almost everyone will look at their
paycheck and see they got 12 percent
and not 22 percent, and a lot of them
are going to be mad."
Others see the prospects for
unionization in a longer time frame.
"I think we would have lost last year
in any case," said Deborah Bundy of
Green Library, a union supporter.
"The University's pressure and scare
tactics only worked to widen the
margin. There's still a huge resistance
here. People have a self-image that
has nothing to do with unions, as if
unions are just for blue-collars. But
there was a huge change in that feel
ing last year, and it will continue."
Bundy said she doesn't believe the
numerical discrepancy between blue
cards and final pro-union votes rep
resents a major retreat. "The people

who signed those blue cards, and
there were a lot of them, were saying
'I'm not satisfied with the way things
are going here, and I want to look at
ways of changing it.' The union elec
tion didn't negate that," she said.
University officials see the election
result in a different light. While ad
mitting last week that the election in
dicated some dissatisfaction and
"room for improvement," staff
counsel Ross Campbell called the
outcome "a reaffirmation that the su
pervisors and the University can be
responsive."
But others besides last year's ac
tivists have their doubts. A secretary
in a small graduate department who
voted against unionization says she's
not sure how she'd vote in a second
election. "I just don't see myself as a
union person, and I can't see the
good in another level of bureaucracy
between me and the bosses," she
said. "But I'm very bothered aboutall
those sincere-sounding things the
University said around the time of
the election about recognizing that
change is necessary. They only said it
because they were under fire. Noth
ing has changed and nothing will,
they just swept it all under the rug.
I'm really very angry."

Coelho, one of 12 members of an interim operating
committee of clerical workers that formed when the
Office Staff Organization Committee (OSOC) dis
banded last July, was referring to what she considered
a University-led anti-union campaign.
Her committee is now charged with writing a set of
by-laws and studying the question of how campus
worker organizations should relate to Union Local
715 in the future.
"Except for the people over in SLAC and those of us
in the libraries, most people are isolated in different
departments, so we had trouble really getting togeth
er. The University had a direct line to everyone and
believe me, they used it."
Coelho and others charged that the supervisors
held meetings "for hours and hours" during the work
day to discuss methods of countering union senti
ment, and that through the supervisors the University
put insistent organized pressure on the more passive
clericals to vote on the day of the election. She
charged the claim cannot be documented because
those involved are unwilling to register formal com
plaints.
Reports of harrassment and directed pressure were
the substance of several of the 18 election violation
charges that Local 715 filed with NLRB after the May
vote. Thirteen of those complaints had to be
withdrawn when the purported intimidation victims
refused to endorse the charges publicly, according to
715 organizer Kathy McKennan.
"They really came at us hard," McKennan said.
"We were so busy trying to teach people the most
basic things about what union is and how it works that
we just didn't have time to prepare them for an anti
union campaign like the one Stanford put on us
The five surviving violation charges dealt with Uni
versity flyers and announcements during the cam
paign. University President Donald Kennedy issued a
number of statements calling the "tense and hostile
atmosphere" that existing campus unions had in

troduced as "especially damaging to the working en
vironment." The administration then began to issue a
series of six topical bulletins that asserted unions take
more power from their members than they give and
that University pay scales and grievance procedures
were already superior to any that the union could of
fer.
Local 715 cited these bulletins as the basis for more
formal charges, claiming they constituted the kind of
unfair propaganda that NLRB regulations prohibit
during the "critical period" between blue card
certification and the election itself.
A University spokesman characterized the bulletins
as relevant information that was necessary "to allow
the workers to make an informed choice." During the
summer the NLRB decided this issue in favor of the
University, declaring the bulletins legitimate cam
paign material and throwing out the union com
plaints.
At the same time, the Board validated another
union charge and agreed to hold an election violation
hearing on it March 23. The question centers on an
article in the Campus Report of last March 11 that an
nounced wage increases of 12-22 percent for the
clerical workers. At the time, Joyce Tipps-Coates of
OSOC called the promise "a blatant attempt to in
fluence the election" and "unfair labor practice." In
retrospect she believes it "bought off" many workers
who otherwise would have voted for the union.
Stanford Manager of Employee Relations Felix
Barthelemy denied the wage announcement was
made for strategic reasons. "It was absolutely consis
tent with the way we've always done it," Barthelemy
said, noting that wage projections have been pub
lished in spring issues of Campus Report for many
years.
When asked why the raise was so much higher this
year (since 1975, the Campus Report has announced
ranges of wage increases that always have a bottom
end of 0 percent), Barthelemy said the 1981/82 raise
was determined long before the election campaign.
Kennedy also denied any tie between campaign
considerations and the raise, saying, "the package is
the result of our struggling with our market position."

UNION ELECTION — University clerical workers voted last spring
not to unionize, and some workers claim that pressure by the aa
ministration had a major impact on the outcome of the election.
If the NLRB rules next spring that
the wage announcement was an un
fair election ploy it could overthrow
last May's results and schedule a new
election. Given the normal waiting
periods involved, the clericals could
be voting again on union affiliation in
a year's time.
But no one is predicting that the
result would be fundamentally dif
ferent. "We could give them a run for
their money," said 715's McKennan.
"Almost everyone will look at their
paycheck and see they got 12 percent
and not 22 percent, and a lot of them
are going to be mad."
Others see the prospects for
unionization in a longer time frame.
"I think we would have lost last year
in any case," said Deborah Bundy of
Green Library, a union supporter.
"The University's pressure and scare
tactics only worked to widen the
margin. There's still a huge resistance
here. People have a self-image that
has nothing to do with unions, as if
unions are just for blue-collars. But
there was a huge change in that feel
ing last year, and it will continue."
Bundy said she doesn't believe the
numerical discrepancy between blue
cards and final pro-union votes rep
resents a major retreat. "The people

who signed those blue cards, and
there were a lot of them, were saying
'I'm not satisfied with the way things
are going here, and I want to look at
ways of changing it.' The union elec
tion didn't negate that," she said.
University officials see the election
result in a different light. While ad
mitting last week that the election in
dicated some dissatisfaction and
"room for improvement," staff
counsel Ross Campbell called the
outcome "a reaffirmation that the su
pervisors and the University can be
responsive."
But others besides last year's ac
tivists have their doubts. A secretary
in a small graduate department who
voted against unionization says she's
not sure how she'd vote in a second
election. "I just don't see myself as a
union person, and I can't see the
good in another level of bureaucracy
between me and the bosses," she
said. "But I'm very bothered aboutall
those sincere-sounding things the
University said around the time of
the election about recognizing that
change is necessary. They only said it
because they were under fire. Noth
ing has changed and nothing will,
they just swept it all under the rug.
I'm really very angry."

715 organizer Kathy McKennan.
"They really came at us hard," McKennan said.

The five surviving violation charges dealt with Uni
versity flyers and announcements during the cam
paign. University President Donald Kennedy issued a
number of statements calling the "tense and hostile
atmosphere" that existing campus unions had in

troduced as "especially damaging to the working en
vironment." The administration then began to issue a
series of six topical bulletins that asserted unions take
more power from their members than they give and
that University pay scales and grievance procedures
were already superior to any that the union could of
fer.
Local 715 cited these bulletins as the basis for more
formal charges, claiming they constituted the kind of
unfair propaganda that NLRB regulations prohibit
during the "critical period" between blue card
certification and the election itself.
A University spokesman characterized the bulletins
as relevant information that was necessary "to allow
the workers to make an informed choice." During the
summer the NLRB decided this issue in favor of the
University, declaring the bulletins legitimate cam

plaints.
At the same time, the Board validated another
union charge and agreed to hold an election violation
hearing on it March 23. The question centers on an
article in the Campus Report of last March 11 that an
nounced wage increases of 12-22 percent for the
clerical workers. At the time, Joyce Tipps-Coates of
OSOC called the promise "a blatant attempt to in
fluence the election" and "unfair labor practice." In
retrospect she believes it "bought off" many workers
who otherwise would have voted for the union.
Stanford Manager of Employee Relations Felix
Barthelemy denied the wage announcement was
made for strategic reasons. "It was absolutely consis
tent with the way we've always done it," Barthelemy
said, noting that wage projections have been pub
lished in spring issues of Campus Report for many
years.
When asked why the raise was so much higher this
year (since 1975, the Campus Report has announced
ranges of wage increases that always have a bottom
end of 0 percent), Barthelemy said the 1981/82 raise
was determined long before the election campaign.
Kennedy also denied any tie between campaign
considerations and the raise, saying, "the package is
the result of our struggling with our market position."

UNION ELECTION — University clerical workers voted last spring
not to unionize, and some workers claim that pressure by the aa
ministration had a major impact on the outcome of the election.
If the NLRB rules next spring that
the wage announcement was an un
fair election ploy it could overthrow
last May's results and schedule a new
election. Given the normal waiting
periods involved, the clericals could
be voting again on union affiliation in
a year's time.
But no one is predicting that the
result would be fundamentally dif
ferent. "We could give them a run for
their money," said 715's McKennan.
"Almost everyone will look at their
paycheck and see they got 12 percent
and not 22 percent, and a lot of them
are going to be mad."
Others see the prospects for
unionization in a longer time frame.
"I think we would have lost last year
in any case," said Deborah Bundy of
Green Library, a union supporter.
"The University's pressure and scare
tactics only worked to widen the
margin. There's still a huge resistance
here. People have a self-image that
has nothing to do with unions, as if
unions are just for blue-collars. But
there was a huge change in that feel
ing last year, and it will continue."
Bundy said she doesn't believe the
numerical discrepancy between blue
cards and final pro-union votes rep
resents a major retreat. "The people

who signed those blue cards, and
there were a lot of them, were saying
'I'm not satisfied with the way things
are going here, and I want to look at
ways of changing it.' The union elec
tion didn't negate that," she said.
University officials see the election
result in a different light. While ad
mitting last week that the election in
dicated some dissatisfaction and
"room for improvement," staff
counsel Ross Campbell called the
outcome "a reaffirmation that the su
pervisors and the University can be
responsive."
But others besides last year's ac
tivists have their doubts. A secretary
in a small graduate department who
voted against unionization says she's
not sure how she'd vote in a second
election. "I just don't see myself as a
union person, and I can't see the
good in another level of bureaucracy
between me and the bosses," she
said. "But I'm very bothered aboutall
those sincere-sounding things the
University said around the time of
the election about recognizing that
change is necessary. They only said it
because they were under fire. Noth
ing has changed and nothing will,
they just swept it all under the rug.
I'm really very angry."
to an earlier section of this story
published last week, Jeffrey Golden
delved into reactions to last spring's
clerical workers' union election and
found the issue far from resolved:
many concerns motivating the elec
tion still beset the University.
Although workers voted 930-554
not to affiliate themselves with Unit
ed Stanford Employees (USE) Union
Local 715, some clerical workers —
both opposing and favoring the
union — doubt the University will
address their grievances.
Low wage scales, job security, child
care, and improved working condi
tions were some issues that
prompted the often bitter election,
but the 1100 statements of interest in
a union filed last November
dwindled to half that number of pro
union votes.
Non-controversial reasons and
problems with USE prompted much
of the decline, but many union or
ganizers charge the University ad
ministration conducted a
purposefully anti-union effort. The
union was soundly defeated, but the
anti-union plurality is far from an in
dication that workers are pleased
with the conduct and outcome of the
election.

"They made it very difficult," said Jill Coelho, a
Green Library employee, "and very, very fright
ening."
Coelho, one of 12 members of an interim operating
committee of clerical workers that formed when the
Office Staff Organization Committee (OSOC) dis
banded last July, was referring to what she considered
a University-led anti-union campaign.
Her committee is now charged with writing a set of
by-laws and studying the question of how campus
worker organizations should relate to Union Local
715 in the future.
"Except for the people over in SLAC and those of us
in the libraries, most people are isolated in different
departments, so we had trouble really getting togeth
er. The University had a direct line to everyone and
believe me, they used it."
Coelho and others charged that the supervisors
held meetings "for hours and hours" during the work
day to discuss methods of countering union senti
ment, and that through the supervisors the University
put insistent organized pressure on the more passive
clericals to vote on the day of the election. She
charged the claim cannot be documented because
those involved are unwilling to register formal com
plaints.
Reports of harrassment and directed pressure were
the substance of several of the 18 election violation
charges that Local 715 filed with NLRB after the May
vote. Thirteen of those complaints had to be
withdrawn when the purported intimidation victims
refused to endorse the charges publicly, according to
715 organizer Kathy McKennan.
"They really came at us hard," McKennan said.
"We were so busy trying to teach people the most
basic things about what union is and how it works that
we just didn't have time to prepare them for an anti
union campaign like the one Stanford put on us
