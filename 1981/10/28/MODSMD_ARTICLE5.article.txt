## Ehrlich speaks on 'Extinction' at Coyote Point Museum Ehrlich warns public 
### Kristen Christopher 
Stanford Prof. Paul Ehrlich
called for strong and im
mediate political action to halt
the current trend of habitat de
struction and species extinc
tion, speaking at the Coyote
Point Museum for Environ
mental Education last week.
Ehrlich, a professor of
biological sciences and a Bing
Professor of Population Stud
ies, made these comments in a
talk promoting Extinction, his
latest book which he co-au
thored with his wife, Anne
Ehrlich.
Ehrlich stressed that while
the destruction of species is a
natural part of the process of
evolution, the rate of destruc
tion today is anywhere from 40
to 400 times what it should be.
"Suddenly, we have opened
a drain wide — we have also
turned down the faucet," he
said, referring to the decreas
ing rate of speciation.
Why should people be con
cerned that the number of
species is decreasing rapidly?
The most significant answer to
this que sj,io n is the
"Ecosystems' Services Argu
ment," he said. This argument
maintains our society is sup
ported by natural ecosystems,
which regulate the quality of
our atmosphere by ameliorat
ing the weather, controlling
pollution, disposing of wastes,
and regulating the water cycle.
"These services are crucial to
our society and are done for
free," Ehrlich said. Thus, when
we kill off species, we are sim
ply harming society, since, ac
cording to Ehrlich, "All or
ganisms are working parts of
our society."
A major problem with the
"Ecosystems' Services Argu

ment" is its inability to predict
the consequences when a
species is lost, he said. How
ever, theecosystemsare nodif
ferent than the social system.
As an example, he cited the as
sassination of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat and our in
ability to predict its long-term
repercussions.
In order to prevent un
desirable consequences result
ing from habitat destruction
and species extinction, Ehrlich
said we have to undergo an
ethical revolution.
"Today, people think eco
nomics can operate independ
ently of ecology," he said. In
order to combat this distorted
view, "We need to develop a
whole new approach to the en
vironment and how we act po
litically," he said.
Ehrlich said he believes that
President Ronald Reagan is not
informed on environmental is
sues, and therefore, urged the
approximately 150 responsive
listeners to work for ecological
ly conscientious organizations,
such as Friends of the Earth, to
help cause a political and social
revolution.
"We will not get anywhere
unless we have political activity
by people like you here," he
said.
Ehrlich also commented on
malathion spraying, during a
question and answer period
following his lecture. While he
said he is in favor of the
spraying because he feels
worse problems will be created
if the fruit flies are not killed,
he also warned people with
very young children to be ex
tremely cautious because of
the lack of knowledge about
malathion's effects.

said, referring to the decreas
ing rate of speciation.
Why should people be con
cerned that the number of
species is decreasing rapidly?
The most significant answer to
this que sj,io n is the
"Ecosystems' Services Argu
ment," he said. This argument
maintains our society is sup
ported by natural ecosystems,
which regulate the quality of
our atmosphere by ameliorat
ing the weather, controlling
pollution, disposing of wastes,
and regulating the water cycle.
"These services are crucial to
our society and are done for
free," Ehrlich said. Thus, when
we kill off species, we are sim
ply harming society, since, ac
cording to Ehrlich, "All or
ganisms are working parts of
our society."
A major problem with the
"Ecosystems' Services Argu

ment" is its inability to predict
the consequences when a
species is lost, he said. How
ever, theecosystemsare nodif
ferent than the social system.
As an example, he cited the as
sassination of Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat and our in
ability to predict its long-term
repercussions.
In order to prevent un
desirable consequences result
ing from habitat destruction
and species extinction, Ehrlich
said we have to undergo an
ethical revolution.
"Today, people think eco
nomics can operate independ
ently of ecology," he said. In
order to combat this distorted
view, "We need to develop a
whole new approach to the en
vironment and how we act po
litically," he said.
Ehrlich said he believes that
President Ronald Reagan is not
informed on environmental is
sues, and therefore, urged the
approximately 150 responsive
listeners to work for ecological
ly conscientious organizations,
such as Friends of the Earth, to
help cause a political and social
revolution.
"We will not get anywhere
unless we have political activity
by people like you here," he
said.
Ehrlich also commented on
malathion spraying, during a
question and answer period
following his lecture. While he
said he is in favor of the
spraying because he feels
worse problems will be created
if the fruit flies are not killed,
he also warned people with
very young children to be ex
tremely cautious because of
the lack of knowledge about
malathion's effects.
