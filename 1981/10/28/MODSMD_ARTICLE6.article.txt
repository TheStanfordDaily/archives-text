# Schawlow explains his work with laser spectroscopy that won him the Nobel Prize

Two days after winning
the Nobel Prize in physics,
Stanford Prof. Arthur
Schawlow said the exact
reason he won is "still a little
bit vague". He has come to
the logical conclusion, how
ever, that he was awarded
the prize for an accumula
tion of his work with lasers,
which has most recently in
volved the development of
a technique called "laser
spectroscopy".
While lasers have been
used for quite some time to
examine the structure of at
oms and molecules, laser
spectroscopy has greatly in
creased the amount of de
tail that can be revealed.
According to Schawlow, a
spectroscope is used to
"tune a laser" so that only a
single wavelength of pure
color remains. This narrow
light beam allows physicists
to acquire more intricate
knowledge of the structure
of atoms and molecules, he
said, by analyzing the lines
of colored light that parti
cles emit after the laser is
focused on them.
The development of

tunable lasers by Schawlow
increases the resolution that
can beobtained by eliminat
ing "Doppler effects",
which blur the emitted lines
by atomic movement. In or
der to be effectively stud
ied, atoms need to standing
still and a properly tuned
laser is able to locate the sta
tionary atoms while remain
ing insensitive to the others.
Schawlow said that one of
the most significant tech
niques that has been de
veloped in connection with
laser spectroscopy reveals
the presence of hidden at
oms. Called "laser label
ing", this process involves
tagging the "visible" atoms
with a wavelength of pure
color and then probing the
substance with a light of an
other color to discover hid
den atoms. Tagging the at
oms is not difficult, he said,
as they are naturally
bleached by the laser for a
small fraction of a second.
"This process greatly in
creases the possibility of de
tecting a single molecule of
any substance," Schawlow
said.
The likelihood of being
able to detect impurities in

substances through laser
labeling is the first real ap
plication of laser spec
troscopy. Almost all of
Schawlow's work has been
purely scientific, concen
trating on the basicsof phys
ics. Information found
through laser use has

"77i/s process greatly increases the
possibility of detecting a single molecule
of any substance...there will be surprising
uses popping up as always in science."

enabled physicists to define
the constants of physics,
such as relative length and
energy between particles,
much more accurately.
Schawlow is confident,
however, that work with
laser spectroscopy will not
remain confined to physics
research. "There will be sur
prising uses popping up as
always in science," he said.
Schawlow, who shared
the Nobel Prize with Nich-

olas Bloembergen of
Harvard University and Kai
Siegbahn of Uppsala Uni
versity in Sweden, had
heard he had won the prize
in 1964 as co-inventor of the
laser. It was given instead to
his brother-in-law Charles
Townes, now a professor at

Berkeley, and two Russians
for development of the
maser, a device which issim
ilar to the laser, but involves
microwaves rather than vis
ible light. While Schawlow
said he feels the laser was
the more important de
velopment, he realizes the
Nobel Prize committee has
a difficult task to perform.
"I'm just happy to have it
now," he said.
