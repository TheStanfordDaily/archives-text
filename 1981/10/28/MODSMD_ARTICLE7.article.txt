Environmental education in
an aesthetically pleasing, tech
nologically innovative, and in
tellectually stimulating en
vironment is the goal of the
newly opened Coyote Point
museum in San Mateo.
The museum was built with
the hope of inspiring the gen
eral public to not only enjoy
the environment, but also to
understand its complexity, said
Museum Director Linda
Liebes. "The purpose of the
museum istoteach, inspireand
motivate through our exhibits
and programs."
The exhibition hall houses a
four level display, "The Place
Called San Mateo." The exhibi
tion seems to be incorrectly
titled, as there is only a per
iphery of emphasis on the en
vironment of San Mateo â€” the
main emphasis is placed on six
major ecological concepts.
Each of the three bottom
levels of the hall portrays two
of these concepts, while the
first level gives a geographical
overview. One wall is covered
by an abstract mural emphasiz
ing revolutions in science and
technology, and in the center
of the room stands a large,
brightly lit rock in tributetothe
sun. The ceiling is adorned
with hanging plaques which
display relevant quotations by
a large variety of individuals,
including author Henry David
Thoreau, activist Barry Com
moner and folksinger Pete
Seeger.
The first level embodies a
characteristic that extends
throughout the museum. As
Dr. Paul Ehrlich, professor of
biological sciences here, com
mented, the Coyote Point
Museum has a unique com
bination of classic and modern

aspects.
Like many other museums,
Coyote Point has a great deal of
writing which summarizes
complicated processes, such as
photosynthesis, to help visitors
understand basic concepts.
However, at Coyote Point,
there are also more stimulating
ways to learn.
On each of the three bottom
levels, there are two television
sets displaying computerized
games, which allow visitors to
learn about an ecological con
cept in a challenging way. For
instance, in the section called
"Cycles and Rhythms," the vis
itor assumes the role of a San
Mateo county supervisor and
then attempts to make de
cisions relating to land use. Re
sponses are typed onto a key
board accompanying the tele
vision, and the visitor is pre
sented with a score.
The Coyote Point Museum
has many other educational
games and displays, several of
which are directed towards the
young public. In the "Natural
Food Systems " section, for ex
ample, one can "Take a Big
Mac Apart" to find the source
of each of its components,
while in "Communities and
Ecosystems," one can observe
and listen to a working bee
community.
In each of the six subsections
on the lower levels of the ex
hibit, a problem which humans
have imposed on the environ
ment is presented along with a
solution which generally in
volves conservation, restraint
and careful planning on the
part of the public. All of these
problems are further ex
emplified by displays, such as
beer bottles floating in an
aquarium.
