## Florists offer tips on how to turn that brown thumb green 
### Polly Grunfeld 
An ideal dorm plant doesn't need a window with a view,
doesn't mind doing double duty as a paperweight, and can
live with loud music.
In choosing a plant, there's more to consider than how
often it has to be watered, or how many "pretty" flowers it
will produce. Cost is a major factor, especially with a tight
student budget. You should also consider how big the plant
will eventually get. Imagine your surprise when your baby
redwood tree begins to root into the desk.
An employee at Stanford Florists located on Emerson
Street suggested pothos, Chinese evergreen, grape ivy and
kangaroo ivy as the ideal dormitory plants. These green up
right plants don't need excessive light, water or attention.
A florist at the Plant Gallery located on University Ave
nue, recommended the mother-in-law tongue (snake
plant) or the devil's ivy (a hanging plant) as two that will
stand up well to the wear and tear of dormitory life.
Flowering plants need more attention. But for the student
determined to add a touch of color to his room, an African
violet or echezeria and kalanchoe (succulent plants with
bright orange or pink blossoms) will do the trick.
The price of a plant depends on its size, as well as its
genre. A 6-inch potted succulent plant may run from $6.50
to $50, while an Africa violent may be purchased for about
$3.
For a short-term relationship with flowers, try cut daisies
in water with a little bleach. The bleach purifies the water
and eliminates the need for changing it daily.
Whether a decoration, a companion, or "someone to talk
to," a plant has certain needs in terms of water, lighting and
room temperature. Even the sturdiest of plants need some
TLC (tender loving care).
