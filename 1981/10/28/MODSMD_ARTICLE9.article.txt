# Looking for jollity, jocundity, mirth?
## New "Thesaurus at Play" may be the game for you! 
### Madeline Kirbach 
Would you say thank you if your section leader said
you were indolent? Would a good cheerleader be
taciturn on the field? Do you consider yourself sa
pient?
If these questions left you addlepated, Thesaurus at
Play, a new card game created by a Palo Alto
philologist/inventor, might be for you.
Thesaurus at Play (TAP) is not for everyone, ad
mitted the game's creator, H.R. Sawyer. The game was
invented specifically for those of college age and
older "who aspire to reach the uppermost rungs of
logodaedalia," he said.
In essence, TAP is a card game which challenges its
players to learn the definitions of up to 9000 new
words. Each card in the special 52-card deck displays
two words, their pronunciations, their definitions and
their origin. The decks are arranged thematically cov
ering such topics as -manias and -phobias, eponyms
and toponyms, -ologies and -isms, a series of college
level words, and a specially-designed category of de
vinoms, words Sawyer called schematic deviants.
To play, the participants spin the color and
number-coded dial to determine which card to use.
The holder of that card then decides which of the two
words on the card hewill askthechallengertodefine.
The amount of points awarded each player depends
upon the accuracy of the challenger's definition.

By playing the game, the participants are able to im
prove their vocabulary through a relatively easy-to
learn method. Rather than simply memorizing a list of
words, the players increase their exposure to the his
tory, pronunciation, and connotation of words in a
social atmosphere.

" 'Thesaurus at Play' is not for
everyoneThe game was
invented specifically for those of
college age and older "who
aspire to reach the upper-most
rungs of logodaedalia."
— H.R. Sawyer

TAP was created for "those who read and like to un
derstand what they read without frequent reference
to the dictionary," Sawyer explained. In addition, he
said the game should appeal to "the logophiliac who
aspires a rich vocabulary as well as anyone who

acknowledges that — just as biologically you are what
you eat — socially and culturally you are what you
speak."
Sawyer described the game as "very high-brow"
and said quite emphatically that TAP is not for the
weak-minded or the advocate of boob tube enter
tainment.
Sawyer began compiling booklets of "elegant"
words 10 years ago for his son who had gone off to
boarding school. Later on, the logophiliac decided to
createa game using his increasing inventory of words.
After months of going to libraries and photocopying
definitions, origins and pronunciations,
project began to take form.
With the help of three Stanford graduates, the ao*
thor completed the editing and worked out the final
details of the game. He received permission from
Doubleday to use World Book Dictionary definitions
and gained a patent on his game.
Thesaurus at Play should be in local college book
stores, regular bookstores and game stores by early
November.
Those who master all of the words in their original
two decks can still enjoy TAP. There will be at least
three complete decks of 104 words per theme; and
eight new categories are in the works now, Sawyer
said. All totaled, he predicted that the entire game
will contain 9000 words.
