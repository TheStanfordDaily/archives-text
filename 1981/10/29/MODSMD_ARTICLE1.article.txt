# Pipe replacements slowing up traffic
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
The noisy construction around
Wilbur and Stern halls, which for the
past three weeks has created ripped
up streets, traffic jams and huge piles
of sand, is part of a program to re
place pipes in the heating line, ac
cording to Dennis Oblik, manager of
Utility Engineering.
The new pipes are being installed
near the residence halls and in sever
al other areas around campus in an
effort to save energy and to reduce
operating and maintenance costs.
The construction around Wilbur and
Stern is expected to last another
week or two. It is part of an ongoing
program to upgrade the physical
plant of the University by replacing
pipes in the heating line, according
to Oblik.
Pipe replacement will also take
place at the Medical Center and the
construction site of the Braun Music
Center, he said.
Recycling
The heating line carries water to
buildings for space and water heating
from the Central Energy Center. Af
ter the water is used it is recycled
back to the center in the form of
steam, and then reconverted into wa
ter and chemically treated to be used
again, Oblik said. In this way water is
conserved and recycled until it is lost
through leaks and evaporation, he
added.
The decision to replace the pipes
was prompted by the frequent re
pairs needed to maintain the former
pipe system, Oblik said. "We ran into
a problem with a certain type of pipe
that didn't serve our purpose," said
Jim Horgan, head of engineering and
construction.
The formerly used pipe, called
Chem Tite, was made of concrete

and was, according to Horgan, more
susceptible to breakage due to
ground movement.
Replacing the Chem Tite pipes are
steel Schedule 80 pipes, which are
wrapped with tar paper and a
fiberglass coating that provides in
sulation to reduce heat loss and to
protect the pipes from corrosion due
to ground movement, Oblik said.
Pipe life
In addition to the increased
durability of the pipes, a safeguard
against breakage will be provided by
placing the pipes in a bed of sand, he
said. "We're trying to eliminate fre
quent replacements. I hope the life
of the pipe will be 30 years. If proper
ly protected the replacement time
should be indefinite,"he added.
The increased insulation in the
new pipes will cut energy costs in half
because of the reduction of heat
losses, according to Oblik.
The five phases of the replacement
project and some additional small
engineering projects will cost
$748,000, which will come out of the
General Plant Improvement fund,
said Oblik.
Work on pipe replacement around
the construction site of the Braun
Music Center is scheduled to begin
this week and take 30 to 60 days, ac
cording to Oblik. Construction
around the Medical Center will
probably not begin for four to five
weeks and could last anywhere from
one to two months, depending on
the weather, he added.
Oblik said the improvement
project was based on the results of a
study, and that it was carried out on
the basis of the availability of funds
and the determination of how long
the existing pipes can remain oper
able.
