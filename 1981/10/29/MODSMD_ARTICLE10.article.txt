Islamabad, Pakistan â€” The rate of terrorist ac
tivity has gone up in Kabul, the capital of Afghan
istan, with frequent explosions reported,
Western diplomatic sources here said Tuesday.
They said four persons were wounded in a
powerful explosion outside the Interior Ministry
last Tuesday. Quoting an Afghan contact, the
sources added that members of the Afghan re
sistance fighting against the Soviet-backed gov
ernment kidnapped three military officers from
their residence in Kabul last Friday.
Islamic insurgents were moving against of
ficials in other areas also, the sources said, add
ing that the deputy commissioner of Balkh was
kidnapped during the same period.
Rebels control highways
Earlier this month travelers reported that rebel
groups were regularly stopping non-gov
ernmental traffic on a major highway leading
from Kabul to search for government officials.
According to Afghan sources, most government
officials now prefer to travel by air.
Fighting was also reported outside Kabul over
the weekend. The village of Khawaja Musafir,
about 6 miles from Paghman on the Kabuf-
Paghman road, was hit on Saturday when, diplo

matic observers reported, Soviet gunship heli
copters dropped bombs and rocketed the vil
lage while ground forces remained stationed in
the vicinity.
Troops in the past used to return to Kabul after
such operations.
Another Afghan source said guerrillas suf
fered 14 killed in an operation in Paghman.
Besides destroying several vehicles, the rebels
reportedly downed one helicopter by machine
gun fire. '
Intense fighting
Islamic opponents of the Afghan government
claimed several hundred Afghans and Russians
killed in the operation, and the diplomatic
sources said that the rebels' admission of their
unusual high casualties indicated that the "fight
ing was intense."
The Western diplomatic sources said the Af
ghan government was planning to cut trees
along the road to Paghman to deny cover to the
rebels. The same tactic was being applied in the
Logar Valley, where heavy fighting was re
ported.
Diplomats said guerrillas surrounded a large
military force in the Ahmed Khel Valley in Paktia
Province, but the outcome was not known.
