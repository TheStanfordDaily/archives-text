# Europeans discuss troop aid for upcoming Israeli Sinai exit
## 
### Washington Post 
London â€” The 10 European
Economic Community coun
tries are nearing agreement en
reviving their Middle East
peace initiative, under which
Britain, France, Italy and
Holland will participate in the
U.S.-led Sinai peace-keeping
force.
A diplomatic spokesman for
Britain, which currently holds
the EEC presidency, said a
"consensus is emerging" after
discussions among Common
Market foreign ministers who
met in Luxembourg at the be
ginning of this week.
Diplomats said there would be
more negotiations in the next
few days over the wording of
an announcement and the Eu
ropeans' rationale for partici
pation in the Sinai force.
They are still seeking the best
formula, according to Europe
an diplomatic sources, for tying
participation in the Sinai force
under the Camp David agree
ment with the Europeans' in
dependent initiative to involve
the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization in future peace ne
gotiations in the Middle East.

Camp David Iramework
The complexity of the Eu
ropean task increased Tuesday
with the statement by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan
Ali in Jerusalem, where he
completed talks with Israeli
leaders, that the Camp David
formula remains the
framework for future peace
negotiations.
On the other end of the
spectrum, Soviet President
Leonid Breznev said in Mos
cow that the Kremlin favors an
international conference on
the Middle East that would in
clude the Soviet Union and the
PLO, both of which have been
excluded from recent peace
moves.
The accelerating pace of in
itiatives from all quarters re
flects a growing perception
that the death of President
Anwar Sadat of Egypt has re
opened the bidding in Middle
East diplomacy.
The European contribution
to the Sinai force is expected to
include a few hundred troops
from Britain, France, Italy and
Holland. British participation
very likely would be followed
by Commonwealth members
Australia, New Zealand and
Canada.
U.S., Egypt want Europeans
Since the assassination of
Sadat, both the U.S. and Egyp
tian governments have been
pressing the Europeans to
agree to requests made earlier
to contribute to the interna
tional force, which will police
the final Israeli withdrawal next
April from the Sinai under the
Camp David agreement.
"There has been greater ur
gency since Sadat's death,"
said one diplomat, because of
the perceived need of the new
Egyptian government to
achieve the complete return of
the Sinai.
This was referred to publicly
for the first time in Luxem
bourg by French Foreign Min
ister Claude Cheysson, who
told reporters there that "now,
more than ever, it's important
that Egypt does not experience
failure."
Cheysson reportedly argued
most forcefully for rapid Eu

ropean Community agreement
to participation. The EEC's
newest member, Greece, ex
pressed strong doubts.
The Greek foreign minister
reportedly said that by partici
pating in the Camp David proc
ess the Europeans would com
promise their efforts to involve
the PLO and Arab nations
hostile to Camp David.
Arabs oppose mixed force
The Libyan and Syrian gov
ernments, two staunch oppo
nents of the Camp David
agreement, have warned that
participation in the Sinai force
could affect European interests
generally in the Middle East
and jeopardize restarting of a
formal "Euro-Arab" dialogue
between the EEC and the Arab
League, according to
diplomats here.
In an apparent answer to this
pressure, Cheysson told re
porters in Luxembourg Mon
day that "those who criticize
(the Sinai force) do so out of ill
will or because they do not
want the evacuation" of the Si
nai by Israel.
As for the Europeans,
Cheysson said, "It would be
absolutely incoherent to ap
plaud the pullback and refuse
to lend a hand. We must take
the risk. We must not let Egypt
down now."
Referring to efforts by the
Common Market nations col
lectively to wield greater in
ternational influence with in
dependent policies on ques
tions like the Middle East,
Cheysson added that partici
pation in the Sinai force "is vital
if the European Community is
to be more than a talking
shop."
Quiet approach in Europe
Other European diplomats
have refused to be as out
spoken as Cheysson for fear of
increasing the risk of damage
to the European Community's
relationships in the Middle
East, according to informed
sources. They are seeking in
stead to draft a joint statement
explaining participation iri the
Sinai force as compatible with
European peace initiatives in
the Middle East, the sources
said.
