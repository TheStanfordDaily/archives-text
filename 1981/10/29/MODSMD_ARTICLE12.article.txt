## Features on the Environment Students at ASSU Recycling Center concerned with waste 
### Karen Haberman 
Those bright green barrels
around campus are more than
just a place to stash some of
your trash and forget about it.
The ASSU Recycling Center, a
product of students' efforts to
reduce the amount of re
sources wasted here at Stan
ford, maintains approximately
500 such bins in 200 locations,
according to Project Co-Man
ager Fred Beddall.
"I don't kni©w of any other
university recycling program in
the country like ours; we're the
model," said Betsy Jordan, the
other co-manager of the
project.
Students pick up, sort and
sell recyclable items, with the
bulk of time spent in sorting,
according to Jordan. Located
on Pampas Lane just off Serra
Street, the center processes a
significant amount of materi
als, she said, citing an average
figure as 80 tons per month. In
comparison, the entire city of
Los Altos recycles about 110
tons per month.
"Last week, when our fiber
market took away three weeks
of cardboard, they needed an
18-wheeler, in its lowest gear,
to haul the load — over 32,000
pounds!" said Beddall. "It
warmed the cockles of my
heart to know all that good ma
terial was going to be re
cycled."
A major function of the cen
ter is educating the Stanford

community about the need for
recycling, said Jordan. "Half
the time we're in here, we're
answering questions," she said.
Wk,h a6taff of 20, Jordan said
the center has expanded as far
as it can if it is to remain stu
dent-run. Funding for the op
erations and employees comes
from revenues generated by
selling recycled items and from
fee assessments.
"We don't break even," ad
mitted Jordan. "But recycling
shouldn't have to break even.
Maybe you pay an occasional
fee assessment — you'll save
energy, resources, landfill. And
you'll pay less for having your
garbage removed."
Beddall agreed that campus
recycling efforts could be
greatly improved. Comment
ing on the attempt to recycle at
last year's home football
games, he said, "It should have
been so simple to take that six
pack of empty aluminum cans
from the game up the stairs and
deposit it into the recycling
bins. People just didn't do it."
A major recycling problem is
that people put non-recyclable
garbage in recycling bins. Last
Saturday, an inflatable plastic
swimming pool was found in
one of the bins. Items the cen
ter does accept include most
grades of paper, cardboard,
aluminum, tin and bimetals,
and used motor oil.
"One frustration I feel," said
Beddall, "is that although the

center saves the University ap
proximately $9000 each year
through decreased dumping
costs, the University has pro
vided little financial support
for the program since they in
itially donated and paved the
yard."
Another problem Beddall
identified is the pressure for a
better appearance. "Our col
lection locations are functional
and as attractive as possible giv
en our financial resources and
the carelessness of people who
misuse them. Old beer and
pop dissolves fiber barrels. And
putting your bottles near the
bin is not the same as in the
bin," he said.
The amount of materials that
have to be recycled concerns
Beddall. "Lifestyles should be
changed to generate less
waste," he explained. "Recycl
ing is just the tip of the iceberg,
though an important first step.
Packaging has to be reduced."
Beddall stressed that recycl
ing should not be separated
from the larger question of
waste in our society. "It's
shocking that there are people
rich enough that they can
throw away valuable resources,
and people poor enough that
you can find whole families
wading through the grossest
garbage, picking out
aluminum cans worth only
pennies/' he said.
Recycling on campus was

not originally a student effort.
Tom Sawyer, of the Peninsula
Recycling Company, ran a
smaller scale recycling pro
gram for about three years
prior to the ASSU takeover. He
began because people he
knew on campus requested
bins.
"First thing you knew, we
had them all over campus. It
grew and grew," said Sawyer.
He opened a lot on Pampas
Lane, near the current site, but
problems developed because
Plant Services gave Sawyer per
mission to use the lot without
the authority to do so. In the
summer of 1977, Sawyer re
ceived notice to close his oper
ation.
"They caught us with our
britches down," sajd Bob
Wenzlau, who was then a stu
dent involved in Tom's project.
He recounted that Sawyer tried
to negotiate with ASSU, but
ASSU felt strongly that recycl
ing should be run by the stu
dents.
Wenzlau and Ann Henkels,
then a Council of Presidents
member, wrote up what
Wenzlau called a "grand pro
posal." They stated the center
would make money, create
jobs, and save the University
money.
The University was skeptical,
and quick to point to four pre
vious failures by student
groups, said Wenzlau, but they
donated a site and lent money

to the students.
Wenzlau credited the suc
cess of the center to the sup
port of SWOPSI, who spon
sored his class, "Waste Age:
The Social, Economic, and En
vironmental Effects of Con
sumption." The class dis
covered the market for materi
als and began a publicity cam
paign.
"That was an example of how

SWOPSI can work," said
Wenzlau. A fee assessment
passed in autumn 1977, enabl
ing ASSU to buy a truck and
build shelters.
Clearly, for those involved,
recycling is not just something
to do while at Stanford. One of
the original project managers,
Jim Knox, now heads the
Ecology Action recycling pro
gram in Modesto. Bob
Wenzlau was the first manager

of Palo Alto Recycling, and, ac
cording to Beddall, continues
to have major influence on sol
id waste issues in the Bay Area.
Another project manager, Katy
Swain, started a recycling pro
gram in East Palo Alto.
"When I leave here I don't
want to go out and make a mil
lion dollars," said Jordan. "I
want to do something I believe
in — recycling."
