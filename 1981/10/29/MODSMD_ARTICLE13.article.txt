A door-to-door canvassing campaign
initiated by the California League of
Conservation Voters (CLCV), a group
organized to extend the political in
fluence of the environmental move
ment, has expanded to the South Bay
area as the league opened a new office
last week in Mountain View.
The canvass began last May to inform
residents about conservation issues and
raise funds for political support of en
vironmental causes. Since its inception
the canvass has reached over 50,000
supporters, registered 2000 voters, and
generated over 3000 volunteers. Its suc
cess has encouraged the league to in
crease activity throughout the Bay Area.
"It's remarkable what's been happen
ing," said Robert Girard, a Stanford law
professor and president of the board of
directors of CLCV. "It's a tremendous
boost for environmental causes. The
awareness that many environmental
battles are political in nature is grow
ing."
Girard credited much of the success
of the program to the dedication of in
dividual canvassers. "They're doing a
good job and believe in what they're
doing," he said.
Two Stanford students, Melanie
Julian and Steve Osgood, worked in the
campaign over the summer.They are
both majoring in human biology with
an emphasis in environmental policy.
Canvassers inform citizens of the
CLCV and the voting records of their
representatives, collect signatures on a
statement of citizen support, collect
data that can be used to target key pre
cincts, and identify citizen contacts.
They also register voters and keep track
of all contributers to contact in call
back campaigns before the election.
About 32 full-time canvassers worked
for the league over the summer, most of
them students, and there are about 20
full-time canvasers now on the staff.

Canvassers work on salary but are ex
pected to make quotas.
The canvassers are trained in effec
tive canvassing techniques and man
aged by a non-profit campaigning cor
poration. They work regular hours,
from 2 to 10 p.m. The routes are or
ganized and records are kept of monies
received, memberships, signatures and
general supporters. Each canvasser is
expected to bring in $50 to $80 a night.
Osgood said the quota system some
times made it hard on the canvassers, as
the difficulty of raising funds varied

up," Osgood said.
Julian was enthusiastic about her ex
perience and said "Lots of people are
behind us when they hear what, we're
doing. There's reallya lot of support out
there for environmental causes and a
need for this kind of organization.
We're really providing a service by
educating the voters, and providing a
politically effective channel for their
environmental concerns."
Julian said voter education was the
campaign's first goal, and it was impor
tant for canvassers to be knowledgable
of the issues. Her experience with CLCV
was tremendously educational, she
said.
Osgood said it was a great experience
to get paid for the kind of work he
could really believe in. He is still work
ing part-time at the new Mountain
View office.
The CLCV has contacted SCIRE and is
in the process of securing approval for
students who would like to obtain
SCIRE internship credit by working part
time as a canvasser.
The target of the canvassing campa
ing now is to prevent construction of
the Peripheral Canal by defeating
SB2OO, a bill involving state water policy,
in next June's election. Opposition to
the canal is strong around the Bay Area,
according to Canvass Director Marvin
Wanetick, and he said that the or
ganization hopes coordinate a canvass
in Los Angeles by this winter. The CLCV
has offices in San Francisco, Mountain
View and Los Angeles but currently
canvasses only out of their San Francis
co and Mountain View Offices.
"Our campaign has been outstand
ingly successful. Because people really
care about the issues, no matter what
the time of year or economy, we can
always find volunteers and financial
support,"said Wanetick.


greatly between demographic areas.
He said because of the less-educated
and transient populations of low-in
come areas, financial support was much
harder to solicit than in more affluent
areas.
"Sometimes it seems like a conflict of
ideology to measure how successful
your campaign was by how much you
collect, but it really does make you a
more effective and determined can-
