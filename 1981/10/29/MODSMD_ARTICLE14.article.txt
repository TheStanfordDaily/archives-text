# Anti-Watt petitions given to Congress
## 
### Dave Randall 
Early last week, Sierra Club representatives
from 46 states marched to the front steps of the
Capitol in Washington, D.C. with some two tons
of paper loaded in trucks behind them.
The papers contained approximately 1.1 mil
lion signatures of American citizens voicing
their disapproval of Interior Secretary James
Watt and the environmental policies of the Rea
gan administration. Delivery of these petitions
climaxed the six-month-long petition drive in
itiated by the Sierra Club last April.
Though the Sierra Club wanted to avoid a
"knee-jerk reaction" to Watt's appointment, ac
cording to Paul Swatek, conservation adminis
trator of the Sierra Club, the idea of a nationwide
petition drive came after several months of
assessing the merits and demerits of the new
Secretary.
In his first few months, Watt encouraged the
exploration and production of oil and gas in wil
derness areas, discontinued the updating of en
dangered and extinct species lists, and proposed
drilling for oil along the coast of northern Cali
fornia.
Calls expressing concern for Watt's policies
began to bombard the Sierra Club offices, said
Swatek. These calls, coming from a wide spec
trum of citizens (a coal company president ex
pressed his concern that Watt would polarize his
policies too much in the direction of pro-de
velopment) motivated officials of the club to do
something.
By the first part of April, the wheels began
turning within the Sierra Club to start the peti
tion campaign. Two weeks later, the first peti
tions rolled off the press, arid on April 16 the
club held a press conference to officially an
nounce the beginning of the drive. The initial
goal was to obtain one million signatures, which
the club would then present to Congress.
At peak times, the Sierra Club was receiving
anywhere from 45,000 to 50,000 signatures a
week, reported Swatek. Up to last week, over
1.1 million signatures had arrived (between
125,000 and 200,000 came from the Bay Area),
and more signatures are streaming into the
club's offices every day.
Watt has "become more of a lightning rod"
for criticism, said Swatek, and the petitions are

not aimed at him but at Congress. They urge
Congress to oppose all anti-environmental legis
lation proposed by the Administration.
The petitions delivered last week represent
only "the tip of the pine tree" of Watt opposi
tion, said Swatek. The Sierra Club hopes that this
issue will evoke a sense of responsibility in the
American people to counteract Watt's policies
— especially in the 1982 congressional elections.
"We feel it was very successful," said Swatek.
But how the elections come out will determine
how successful the petition drive has been, he
said.
On the other side of the coin, the Interior De
partment, according to Harmon Kallman, a pub
lic information officer for the department, views
the petition campaign as "a rather fruitless ex
ercise." The main objectives of the campaign
were to increase Sierra Club membership and
raise extra funding for the club, said Kallman.
The Sierra Club has seen a greater than 30 per
cent increase in membership (to around 245,000
members) since August of 1980. Exactly how
much of that increase was due to the petition
drive is unknown, but Swatek admitted that it
"has had a beneficial impact o.i our growth."
According to Kallman, the drive was merely a
mass media event, the number of signatures rep
resents only a small minority of the American
people, and the validity of each signature is un
clear.
"Anybody could sign the darn thing 'Barney
Google' or 'Charlie Brown/"said Kallman.
Events such as petition drives and demonstra
tions do not properly address the issues in con
troversy, he said.
Both the Swatek and Kallman agreed on one
point: Watt will not be removed i.om office as a
result of the petitions. A Cabinet member can
only be removed through executive decree or
through legislative impeachment, bothunlikely
occurrences.
Peter Steinhart, an English instructor at Stan
ford and writer on environmental issues, agreed
that Watt will not soon be looking for another
job, saying that the petition drive "won't affect
the administration and it won't remove Watt."
Steinhart observed, however, that the massive
campaign created enough publicity to cause
Watt to "pull in his horns a bit."

By the first part of April, the wheels began
turning within the Sierra Club to start the peti
tion campaign. Two weeks later, the first peti
tions rolled off the press, arid on April 16 the
club held a press conference to officially an
nounce the beginning of the drive. The initial
goal was to obtain one million signatures, which
the club would then present to Congress.
At peak times, the Sierra Club was receiving
anywhere from 45,000 to 50,000 signatures a
week, reported Swatek. Up to last week, over
1.1 million signatures had arrived (between
125,000 and 200,000 came from the Bay Area),
and more signatures are streaming into the
club's offices every day.
Watt has "become more of a lightning rod"
for criticism, said Swatek, and the petitions are

not aimed at him but at Congress. They urge
Congress to oppose all anti-environmental legis
lation proposed by the Administration.
The petitions delivered last week represent
only "the tip of the pine tree" of Watt opposi
tion, said Swatek. The Sierra Club hopes that this
issue will evoke a sense of responsibility in the
American people to counteract Watt's policies
— especially in the 1982 congressional elections.
"We feel it was very successful," said Swatek.
But how the elections come out will determine
how successful the petition drive has been, he
said.
On the other side of the coin, the Interior De
partment, according to Harmon Kallman, a pub
lic information officer for the department, views
the petition campaign as "a rather fruitless ex
ercise." The main objectives of the campaign
were to increase Sierra Club membership and
raise extra funding for the club, said Kallman.
The Sierra Club has seen a greater than 30 per
cent increase in membership (to around 245,000
members) since August of 1980. Exactly how
much of that increase was due to the petition
drive is unknown, but Swatek admitted that it
"has had a beneficial impact o.i our growth."
According to Kallman, the drive was merely a
mass media event, the number of signatures rep
resents only a small minority of the American
people, and the validity of each signature is un
clear.
"Anybody could sign the darn thing 'Barney
Google' or 'Charlie Brown/"said Kallman.
Events such as petition drives and demonstra
tions do not properly address the issues in con
troversy, he said.
Both the Swatek and Kallman agreed on one
point: Watt will not be removed i.om office as a
result of the petitions. A Cabinet member can
only be removed through executive decree or
through legislative impeachment, bothunlikely
occurrences.
Peter Steinhart, an English instructor at Stan
ford and writer on environmental issues, agreed
that Watt will not soon be looking for another
job, saying that the petition drive "won't affect
the administration and it won't remove Watt."
Steinhart observed, however, that the massive
campaign created enough publicity to cause
Watt to "pull in his horns a bit."
Early last week, Sierra Club representatives
from 46 states marched to the front steps of the
Capitol in Washington, D.C. with some two tons
of paper loaded in trucks behind them.
The papers contained approximately 1.1 mil
lion signatures of American citizens voicing
their disapproval of Interior Secretary James
Watt and the environmental policies of the Rea
gan administration. Delivery of these petitions
climaxed the six-month-long petition drive in
itiated by the Sierra Club last April.
Though the Sierra Club wanted to avoid a
"knee-jerk reaction" to Watt's appointment, ac
cording to Paul Swatek, conservation adminis
trator of the Sierra Club, the idea of a nationwide
petition drive came after several months of
assessing the merits and demerits of the new
Secretary.
In his first few months, Watt encouraged the
exploration and production of oil and gas in wil
derness areas, discontinued the updating of en
dangered and extinct species lists, and proposed
drilling for oil along the coast of northern Cali
fornia.
Calls expressing concern for Watt's policies
began to bombard the Sierra Club offices, said
Swatek. These calls, coming from a wide spec
trum of citizens (a coal company president ex
pressed his concern that Watt would polarize his
policies too much in the direction of pro-de
velopment) motivated officials of the club to do
something.
