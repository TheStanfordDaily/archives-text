## Mitterrand's socialist policies: square pegs in round holes 
### 
The people of Western countries look
with scorn at the Islamic fundamentalists
who strive to govern according to their re
ligious beliefs. Such practices, Westerners
reason, can only return the Mideast nations
to the chaos and backwardness of the Dark
Ages. In contrast, the modern democratic
governments of Western countries provide
vastly superior leadership, pursuing con
structive, visionary policies.
This generalization is being put to the test
in France. The supposedly forward-looking
government of newly-elected President
Francois Mitterrand has embarked on a vig
orous policy of concentrating economic
power in the hands of government. His pro
gram of tax increases, public employment
and intrusion into private business is the an
tithesis of the economic package put forth
by President Ronald Reagan.
The Mitterrand approach is not new, of
course. Large-scale government economic
intervention has been tried many times, and
its failures are largely responsible for the ec
onomic difficulties the world faces today. In
so fervently embracing such an ideology,
Mitterrand has become the Ayatollah of ec-

onomics. The French people will pay for this
with a stagnant, if not devastated, economy.
As long as governments have existed, the
idea of a centrally controlled economy has
been prominent. The notion of a free mar
ket, on the other hand, is much newer, as is
the science of economics itself. Growing out
of the Enlightenment and associated with
names such as Adam Smith and David
Ricardo, classical economics has argued that
economic activity would be most efficient if
economic exchange were free of either gov
ernment restrictions or collusion by individ
uals.
For modern economies, this dictum is
more valid than ever before. The complex,
multi-faceted nature of today's production
processes has turned central planning efforts
into nightmares. Schemes which dictate the
actions of each economic participant have
led to situations analogous to pounding
square pegs in round holes.
The Soviet economy, for example, has en
tered a stage in which planning only shackles
growth. The central planning apparatus,
which does not leave even the simplest de
cisions to managers, has given rise to a sys-

tem of unbelievable inefficiency and non in
centives for individual effort. Planning has
become a bureaucratic battleground where
huge agencies vie for influence, heedless of
the resulting economic chaos.
The Soviet agricultural sector demon
strates the failures of this system. While the
Soviets maintain a full 25 percent of their
workforce on the farms, as opposed to three
percent in the United States, agricultural
output has hardly grown at all — annual out
put gains averaged only 1.8 percent in the
past decade. Getting these workers off the
farms and into factories is a crucial economic
development goal, but the Soviet planning
system has shown little ability to achieve it.
Whether or not they practice central plan
ning, modern nations have transformed the
goal of social welfare and economic security
into a reality of wasteful spending and de
stroyed incentives. How can a nation hope to
build its economy and standard of living if all
able-bodied persons are guaranteed eco
nomic security regardless of their willingness
to work?
Clearly, the strategy of central planning
and universal social welfare has proved in its

many applications to be a dismal failure. It is
therefore amazing that Mitterrand has opted
to aggressively pursue this strategy. His pro
gram seeks nationalization and government
control of the banking and other sectors of
the French economy. He has moved to im
pose rigid central planning, especially in the
area of new investment.
Mitterrand's plan includes huge increases
in social welfare spending, including min
imum wage boosts and freely-available,
though unproductive, public jobs. Govern
ment spending will increase by 27.6 percent
in the first year. All of this will be financed by
huge tax increases and money-printing.
The international business community
predicts that the Mitterrand approach will
produce short-term benefits through 1982,
but by 1983 the French economy will be in a
dangerous situation. France relies to a tre
mendous degree on international dealings,
and the economic damage caused by the fall
ing value of the franc and collapsing interna
tional investment in France has already been
considerable. The damage can only increase
in view of the cautious, deflationary policies

pursued by France's major trading partners.
In this light, it is disheartening to observe
the fatalistic single-mindedness of Mitter
rand and his associates. In their socialistic
zeal they are steering the French economy
directly into the pit of government strangu
lation and foreign castigation. That they
seem oblivious to these dangers is all the
more depressing. By 1983, the French econo
my is certain to enter a period of stagnation
and high inflation much like that suffered by
the United States through the 19705.
The world at present is witnessing an out
break of fanatic religious fundamentalism
spearheaded by zealots who conspire to
seize power. They seek to rigidly impose
their ideals with no thought to the costs
which their countries must bear. Mitter
rand's religion is socialism, and his de
termination to remake the French economy
ignores the staggering burdens which his
program will clearly entail.
