## Budget cuts hamper scientific research 
### 
Among the casualties of the Reagan Adminis
tration's first nine months must be counted scien
tific research and education. Federal science poli
cy has degenerated into a shambles, as budget-cut
ting fervor has overwhelmed all inputfrom the sci
entific community. This is hardly surprising,
though, in view of the President's pre-inaugural
record.
According to an editorial in Science, "A search
of the New York Times index for pre- or post-elec
tion treatment of science or technology by Mr.
Reagan drew a blank . . . Our search for documen
tary information included the Republican National
Committee and the White House Press Informa
tion Office. Neither had anything positive to con
tribute."
The most disturbing feature of the Reagan sci
ence policy is the virtual elimination of science
education activities of the National Science Foun
dation (NSF), with budgetary reductions of about
85 percent. Among the programs to be abolished
are those for training secondary school science
teachers, disseminating information to the public
(museums and television), and bringing more
women and minorities into science;-support for
undergraduate instruction and research partici
pation will also be axed.
This bit of budget-cutting flies in the face of a
host of warnings about inadequate scientific
education in the United States, issued by NSF, the
American Academy for the Advancement of Sci
ence (AAAS), the Carter administration's Depart
ment of Education, and many professionals, Sci
ence reports, "Observers find it not only ironic but
downright puzzling that theßeagan people are
striking out at programs to fertilize budding scien

tific and engineering talent at the same time they
are calling for revitalization of the country's in
dustrial and military establishments." Other in
dustrialized nations, capitalist and socialist, put far
stronger emphasis on secondary school scientific
education than does the United States.
Nonmilitary research funding has clearly be
come a victim of Reaganomics. NSF support for the
natural sciences will increase slightly, but definite
ly not in proportion to the inflation rate. Social sci
ences, however, will be battered by a 70 percent
decrease in NSF support. Zvi Griliches, chairman of
the Harvard University economics department,
testified before the House Science and Technolo
gy Committee that these cuts would "cripple eco
nomic research for years to come." Ironically, NSF
in the past has funded research on what has be
come known as supply-side economics, the
dogma upon which Reaganomics is based.
Research funding by agencies other than the
NSF is being cut as well. For example, the Depart
ment of Agriculture is closing the Human Nutri
tion Center, a research unit that studied and pro
moted policies for healthful diets as a means of
avoiding diabetes, hypertension, and other
chronic diseases. Science reports, "The unit was
exceptional within USDA because it emphasized
consumer rather than producer interests . . . "
Dietary guidelines issued by this research unit
came under attack by the meat industry.
Given the fact that the Secretary of Agriculture,
the Deputy Secretary, and an Assistant Secretary all
worked in the meat industry prior to joining the
Reagan Administration, the elimination of the Hu
man Nutrition Center must be viewed as a cynical,
blatant payoff to a powerful lobby.
Energy Department research will be strongly

tilted toward nuclear power under the Reagan ad
ministration. Funding for research into energy
conservation and renewable energy sources will
be slashed by 70 percent or more. These cuts are
being made in the name of the so-called "free
market," but no such rationale applies to nuclear
energy, a creature of the State from its inception.
Funds for building the Clinch River Breeder Reac
tion, cut by Carter, will be renewed. Nuclear
power expenditures will account for fully 40 per
cent of the Energy Department research budget in
the fiscal year 1982.
Certainly the greatest beneficiary of the Reagan
'science policy' is the military establishment.
next fiscal year, military research and development
will consume greater than half of all federal re
search and development funds: a staggering $21.5
billion. Not included in this figure is nuclear weap
ons reearch, performed separately by the Energy
Department. Despite protests by Governor jerry
Brown and other Regents that the University of
California has better things to do than design in
struments of mass destruction, the UC Board of
Regents recently renewed its contract to operate
the Livermore and Los Alamos nuclear weapons
laboratories.
The Reagan science policy is misdirected in ev
ery way. Rather than educate scientists and engi
neers, schools and laboratories will be allowed to
deteriorate. Rather than promote public health,
information of benefit to consumers will be sup
pressed. Rather than construct a sane, safe national
energy policy, we can look forward to more reac
tor accidents and leaking drums of radioactive
waste.

laboratories.
The Reagan science policy is misdirected in ev
ery way. Rather than educate scientists and engi
neers, schools and laboratories will be allowed to
deteriorate. Rather than promote public health,
information of benefit to consumers will be sup
pressed. Rather than construct a sane, safe national
energy policy, we can look forward to more reac
tor accidents and leaking drums of radioactive
waste.

Among the casualties of the Reagan Adminis
tration's first nine months must be counted scien
tific research and education. Federal science poli
cy has degenerated into a shambles, as budget-cut
ting fervor has overwhelmed all inputfrom the sci
entific community. This is hardly surprising,
though, in view of the President's pre-inaugural
record.
According to an editorial in Science, "A search
of the New York Times index for pre- or post-elec
tion treatment of science or technology by Mr.
Reagan drew a blank . . . Our search for documen
tary information included the Republican National
Committee and the White House Press Informa
tion Office. Neither had anything positive to con
tribute."
The most disturbing feature of the Reagan sci
ence policy is the virtual elimination of science
education activities of the National Science Foun
dation (NSF), with budgetary reductions of about
85 percent. Among the programs to be abolished
are those for training secondary school science
teachers, disseminating information to the public
(museums and television), and bringing more
women and minorities into science;-support for
undergraduate instruction and research partici
pation will also be axed.
This bit of budget-cutting flies in the face of a
host of warnings about inadequate scientific
education in the United States, issued by NSF, the
American Academy for the Advancement of Sci
ence (AAAS), the Carter administration's Depart
ment of Education, and many professionals, Sci
ence reports, "Observers find it not only ironic but
downright puzzling that theßeagan people are
striking out at programs to fertilize budding scien

tific and engineering talent at the same time they
are calling for revitalization of the country's in
dustrial and military establishments." Other in
dustrialized nations, capitalist and socialist, put far
stronger emphasis on secondary school scientific
education than does the United States.
Nonmilitary research funding has clearly be
come a victim of Reaganomics. NSF support for the
natural sciences will increase slightly, but definite
ly not in proportion to the inflation rate. Social sci
ences, however, will be battered by a 70 percent
decrease in NSF support. Zvi Griliches, chairman of
the Harvard University economics department,
testified before the House Science and Technolo
gy Committee that these cuts would "cripple eco
nomic research for years to come." Ironically, NSF
in the past has funded research on what has be
come known as supply-side economics, the
dogma upon which Reaganomics is based.
Research funding by agencies other than the
NSF is being cut as well. For example, the Depart
ment of Agriculture is closing the Human Nutri
tion Center, a research unit that studied and pro
moted policies for healthful diets as a means of
avoiding diabetes, hypertension, and other
chronic diseases. Science reports, "The unit was
exceptional within USDA because it emphasized
consumer rather than producer interests . . . "
Dietary guidelines issued by this research unit
came under attack by the meat industry.
Given the fact that the Secretary of Agriculture,
the Deputy Secretary, and an Assistant Secretary all
worked in the meat industry prior to joining the
Reagan Administration, the elimination of the Hu
man Nutrition Center must be viewed as a cynical,
blatant payoff to a powerful lobby.
Energy Department research will be strongly

tilted toward nuclear power under the Reagan ad
ministration. Funding for research into energy
conservation and renewable energy sources will
be slashed by 70 percent or more. These cuts are
being made in the name of the so-called "free
market," but no such rationale applies to nuclear
energy, a creature of the State from its inception.
Funds for building the Clinch River Breeder Reac
tion, cut by Carter, will be renewed. Nuclear
power expenditures will account for fully 40 per
cent of the Energy Department research budget in
the fiscal year 1982.
Certainly the greatest beneficiary of the Reagan
'science policy' is the military establishment.
next fiscal year, military research and development
will consume greater than half of all federal re
search and development funds: a staggering $21.5
billion. Not included in this figure is nuclear weap
ons reearch, performed separately by the Energy
Department. Despite protests by Governor jerry
Brown and other Regents that the University of
California has better things to do than design in
struments of mass destruction, the UC Board of
Regents recently renewed its contract to operate
the Livermore and Los Alamos nuclear weapons
laboratories.
