# Kennedy tells undergraduates living, learning must co-exist

### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Emphasizing the importance of
merit and diversity in undergraduate
education, University President
Donald Kennedy last night urged a
group of 65 students to remember
that learning and life should not be
thought of as distinct entities.
"There simply are not watertight
compartments between living and
learning," Kennedy said. His speech,
which took place in Kresge
Auditorium, was entitled "Under
graduate Education: Purposes and
Prospects."
"The relationship (between learn
ing and life) gives students more
trouble these days, and that's true
whenever the economy is empty of
reassurance."
"We shouldn't think of college as a
preparation phase, in which we stuff
ourselves, and then go out to a living
phase in which we employ the stuf
fing," Kennedy said. "You are not
caterpillars, and you aren't going to
metamorphose into butterflies on
Commencement Day."
Kennedy said that in selecting each
entering class, the admissions office
aims for both merit and diversity,
which, he added, are "in some ways
conflicting and competing."
With regard to merit, Kennedy said

the University seeks students who
can best make use of the "ex
traordinary resources of this place."
Turning to the issue of diversity,
Kennedy said, "We regard it as a pri
mary obligation to represent the full
range of this society's diversity in a
Stanford class, and that applies to
ethnicity, economic circumstance, as
well as special interests academic in
terests and talents."
Kennedy expressed concern over
"the triumph of single interests, sin
gle issues, single values" in American
society.
"The particular values — some of
which are actually not so bad — are
not important to my point," said
Kennedy. "What is important is the
willingness of the advocates to assign
infinite weight to their particular val
ues, and to discount all competing
ones."
With respect to students' alleged
political indifference, Kennedy said
he wished that more students would
"stand up and take a little more
charge of their own destiny."
Yet he rejected the notion that stu
dents today are apathetic. "I think
the charge that students are less polit
ically aware is not true," he said. He
said that there may be less group talk
but that there is also less "group
think."
