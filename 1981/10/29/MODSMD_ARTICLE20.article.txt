## EPA needs solid tax base before incorporation 
### 
Nobody wants East Palo Alto — not
Palo Alto, not Menlo Park, not San
Mateo County, which is eager toshift
the burdens of its responsibility to
the local community. Nobody wants
the poor, especially if they are black,
although these are being replaced by
poor Latinos and poorer Asians with
additional language and cultural
handicaps.
It follows that East Palo Alto should
incorporate. By changing the charac
ter of the Municipal Council to the
final decision-making body, all our
problems will in time be solved. We
will stem the economic and social de
terioration. We will eliminate crime,
overcome social and financial dif
ficulties and attract industrial de
velopment for a needed tax base that

has eluded us all these years.
Thus the community will reach the
level of its potential and achieve the
prestige, equality and respect of the
surrounding wealthy white com
munities. But they will court us too
late to take advantage of our de
velopment into a prosperous com
munity.
Such is the basic logic which un
derlies the Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) decision to es
tablish a sphere of influence for a
new city of East Palo Alto, while itsur
reptiously nibbles away at our terri
torial tax base. How this magic trans
formation from scullery maid to a
Cinderella princess is to be ac
complished remains a mystery — our
fairy godmother is invisible.

Its theory is based on the advisabili
ty of local autonomy, and de
termining one's own future by pull
ing oneself up by one's own
bootstrap. East Palo Alto will be the
model that will prove Reagan's politi
cal and economic philosophy and so
become the example for other poor
communities of this nation as well as
for the poor developing nations of
the world.
However, the question that has not
yet been answered satisfactorily is:
when even wealthy established cities
face difficulties because of Proposi
tion 13 and other governmental cut
backs, how can a poor community
with few developed resources but
with overwhelming social problems,
establish a new city and supply

equivalent services without raising
taxes?
The surrounding communities are
responsible for the concentration of
the poor in a small isolated geograph
ic area. The poor are forced into the
area because low income housing is
not made available elsewhere. Yet
these communities need the reser
voir of unemployed, unskilled and
semi-skilled cheap labor that East
Palo Alto is compelled to house and
for whose needs it must provide if in
corporated. Is it surprising that these
cities are anxious to see East Palo Alto
incorporated and be relieved of the
responsibility of housing them?
