# Ronald McDonald house gives shelter, support for parents

They call it"the house that love built."
Comfortably nestled amidst the brightly
colored autumn trees, hidden behind the
Stanford Shopping Center and directly
adjacent to theChildren's Hospital here is
the Ronald McDonald House.
Neither a home for wayward Big Macs nor
a publicity gimmick of the world-famous
hamburgerempire, the Ronald McDonald
House serves as a "home away from home"
for families of children under treatment by
the staff of Children's Hospital at Stanford.
Sinceopening its doors May 17,1979, the
California ranch-style house has provided a
comfortable and inexpensive place to stay
for countless parents while their children are
being treated next door forsuch
catastrophic illnesses as cancer, cystic
fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Some
parents stay for only one night; others have
made it their homeforseven monthsor
more.
Its history seems to prove that it is, indeed,
a house built by love. The idea for the
Children's Hospital atStanford Family
Center (the official name of the Ronald
McDonald House) originated with a group
of three sets of parents in the spring of 1977.
Allofthem had children undertreatmentat
the hospital at the time.
"We had heard about Ronald McDonald
Houses which were already established in
Philadelphia and Chicago and we decided
that something like that was what we needed
here," said Sherron Kalbach of Los Altos,
whose young daughter wasthen receiving
treatment as an outpatient at Children's
Hospital.
"We put the idea together and sent it off to
McDonald's (corporate headquarters in
Chicago)," Kalbach said. "They soon got in
touch with usandasked ustoattend a
meeting of franchise operators in San
Francisco."
"We went to the meeting and gave our
pitch as to why we'd like to have it here and
what we thought it could do," continued
Kalbach. "The Northern California co-ops

(of McDonald's owner/operators) voted to
raise the money for the building."
In addition tothe original supporters from
San Francisco, McDonald's franchise owners
from the Monterey Bay, Sacramento, Valley,
Delta, Fresno and Lake Tahoe/Reno regions
later elected to become involved in the
project as well.
Through promotions of "Shamrock
Shakes" and sales of Ronald McDonald
Coloring Calendars, the McDonald's owners
raised more than half of the $350,000 needed
to remodel and constructthe building
around the existing floors and walls of a
former nurses' dormitory on hospital
grounds.
Kalbach explained thatoncethe parents
had the go-ahead from both McDonald's
and the board of directors of Children's
Hospital, then "we had to form a parents'
group and a board to run the house and to
raise money to furnish it."
The parents were successful in raising
$75,000, which went toward carpeting,
furnishingsand decorations.
Today, the house is supported by
contributions from national charities such as
the American Cancer Society and Easter
Seals, numerous community organizations
and individual donors. McDonald's
continues to lend substantial support, while
Nabisco Inc. and a local supermarket chain
donate food each month to keep the house's
two kitchens partially stocked.
The house's resident manager, Joan
Marinaro, explained that families are
provided with private bedrooms and
bathrooms for a daily rate of $5 — if the
family can afford it. If they cannot afford it,
there is no charge. Guests can store
groceries, cook, usethe laundry facilities
and watch T.V.; essentially, they can behave
much as they would in theirown homes. In
exchange, they are expected to maintain
their own quarters and to assist in keeping
clean the kitchens, laundry room and other
common areas.
"Many actually find the housekeeping
chores to be therapeutic," Marinarosaid. "It

gets their minds off their problems
temporarily, helps pass the time and gives
them a feeling of making a contribution."
Keeping the 13-bedroom house clean
occasionally is a problem, she admitted.
"Some people feel that it's their right to
stay here and that they don't have to help out
at all. That's the exception, though," she
said. "Most people feel that it's a privilege to
stay here, not a right, and they make a real
effort to help out."
Marinarosaid, "Ideally, the families
should run the houseand takecareof
themselves, while I function as the house
manager — rather than my spending a great
deal of time just trying to keep the place
clean."
According to Marinaro, the families
interact a great deal while at the house.
"This is probably the best place for them to
get support from each other. Some of the
best talks take place late in the evening or
while making space for each other in the
kitchen or simply breaking down and
sobbing together over a load of laundry. . .
they do a lot of sharing here," she said.
She pointed out that the children who stay
with their parentsat the housewhile
receiving treatment as outpatients
communicate a great deal, as well. "They do
a lot more sharing here than they do in the
hospital," she said.
The children who stay at Ronald
McDonald House suffer from a wide range
of illnesses, including various forms of
cancer, kidney, heart and respiratory
diseases, orthopedic problems, allergies and
occasionally psychosomatic illnesses.
Marinaro, who lives in private quarters at
the house with her husband, Nick, and
young son, Patrick, was a nurse at Children's
Hospital for seven years before Patrick was
born.
"Being here has given me a much better
appreciation for what families go through
when a child is ill," she said. "In the hospital,
nurses see families on much different terms
than I see them here. Here, I'm living with
them on a day-to-day basis, and I see the

traumas the entire family experiences, what
it can dotoa marriage, thestrain a child's
illness can cause between a husband and
wife."
Marinaro confided, "Being here has also
made me appreciate the good health of my
own family so much more."
The idea forthe first Ronald McDonald
House grew out of the experience in 1969 of

'Being here (the Ronald
McDonald House) has
given me a much better
appreciation for what
families go through when
a child is ill. In the hospital,
nurses see families on
much different terms than
I see them here. Here, I'm
living with them on a day
to-day basis, and I see the
traumas the entire family
experiences...

Fred Hill, then-tight end forthe Philadelphia
Eagles. At the time, Hill's three-year-old
daughter, Kim,wasa leukemia patient at
Philadelphia Children's Hospital.
Wanting to help in some way, and backed
by the enthusiasticsupportof his team's
owner, his coach and histeammates, Hill
asked Dr. Audrey Evans, director of
Oncology at the hospital, where money was
needed. She presented him with a lengthy
"shopping list" of ideas she had which
needed financial support.
Among Evans' ideas was a home for

parents who wanted to remain near their
hospitalized youngsters, but couldn't afford
the staggering expense of prolonged hotel
stays.
General Manager of the Eagles, Jim
Murray, approached advertising executive
Don Tucker man, who handled the
McDonald's account in Philadelphia, with a
proposition. He offered the services of star
quarterback Roman Gabriel to promote
Mcdonald's new "Shamrock Shakes" — in
exchange for some of the profit from the
shakes to be donated toward the purchase of
a house.
Tuckerman soon returned to Murray wilh
the answer that the McDonald's franchise
owners of Philadelphia would donateall of
the profit from the shakes. They asked in
return only that the Eagles consider naming
the house after the hamburger chain's c lown
character, Ronald McDonald.
The resultingsix-bedroom house, the first
of its kind, opened its doors in 1974. Since
then, it has served as a temporary home to
over 5000 people from 29 states and seven
foreign countries, according to figures
supplied by Bud Jones, National Ronald
McDonald House coordinator.
Last May, the original house in
Philadelphia was replaced by a much larger
16-bedroom house.
In the seven yearssince that first house
opened, 25 more Ronald McDonald Houses
have evolved with similar local support, and
12 more are scheduled to open this year.
Furthermore, there are 20 cities where a firm
commitment has been made to establish a
house, and an additional 41 cities where
community interest has been expressed.
Kim Hill, the little girl whose father started
the ball rolling, is now a healthy, athletic 15-
year-old whose leukemia has been in
remission for several years. She recently was
the honored guest at the dedication of the
new,enlarged house in Philadelphia.
"When we lived in Philadelphia," she said, I
sure didn't enjoy being sick, but if this house
is a result of my illness, then it must have
been for a good reason."
