### Steve Kaufman 
Claiming that "there must be
people to stand up and take on
the demagogues," Senator
Henry Jackson (D-Washington)
re-affirmed his position on hu
man rights in a speech given in
San Francisco last Saturday.
Speaking before the Anti-
Defamation League (ADL),
Jackson stressed the im
portance of free emigration
and cited recent clamp-downs
on Jewish emigration from the
Soviet Union as "a denial of
their fundamental rights."
The ADL, a Jewish organiza
tion which works to curb anti-
Semitism and racism in Ameri
ca and abroad, presented Jack
son with their Joseph Award
for Human Rights. The event,
honoring Jackson for hisefforts
in this field, drew a crowd of
more than 400 for dinner and
speeches at the Fairmont Ho
tel.
Jackson, in his acceptance
speech, called upon the Soviets
to once again reinstate free
emigration "for Jews and non-
Jews alike." Disturbed by the
marked drop in the number of
Soviet Jewish emigrees, Jack
son said "we must speak up for
those denied their fundamen
tal rights," and warned the So
viets of hardened U.S. policies
if the flow is not resumed.
Jackson also touched on the
Middle East situation, criticiz
ing "the lack of (U.S.) Middle
East policy." He highlighted
Libyan leader Moammar

Khadafy's role in destabilizing
the region, and noted that "we
need a credible presence there
to show Moscow we mean
business."
In a reference to the current
ly-debated AWACs issue, he
said that "Israel is an in
dispensable asset to the U.S.,
and I don't understand why
Reagan's administration is so
slow to get that point."
Jackson had high praise for
Egypt's slain president Anwar
Sadat, claiming that "Sadat's
death accentuates the instabili
ty in the area. Israel will soon
learn if it made with
Anwar Sadat or made peace
with Egypt."
Jackson, sponsor of the fa
mous jackson Amendment
which fies U.S.-Soviet trade to
Moscow's emigration policies,
praised the ADL for its role in
combatting racism and anti-
Semitism. He called the ADL a
"model for the kind of or
ganizations we need forever, if
freedom is to survive for gener
ations to come."
"We must recognize assaults
on basic human rights," he
said, "and the best way to do
that is to work with each other
on common ground." He cited
the change in public focus
from free emigration policies
to such issues as Iran, AWACS
and Middle East oil, and urged
a return to human rights "lest
we leave our allies on the bat
tlefield."
