# Mem Chu to gain new organ built by ex-student
## 
### Francesca Fraser Darling 
Memorial Church will have a new or
gan in 1983. This organ will comple
ment, not replace, the present organ,
which dates from the last decade of the
19th century and was installed when the
church first opened in 1903.
In 1906, during the great earthquake,
the organ proved its sturdy Victorian
qualities by surviving the incident. In
1913 when the church opened its doors
once again, the organ was on hand to
lend a suitably triumphant note to the
occasion.
Seventy years later the organ has
been surrounded by scaffolding again,

but this time it is in preparation for an
other organ — one which has a re
markable history of its own.
In the late 19505, Charles Fisk, a grad
uate student of physics at Stanford and a
member of the Memorial Church choir,
became interested in the organ and de
cided to find out how it worked. Music
Prof. Herbert Nanney, church organist,
enlightened him.
What happened next cannot be de
scribed in quite the same terms as St.
Paul's conversion on the road to Da
mascus, but a conversion did take
place. Fisk abandoned his physics stud
ies to learn the craft of organ building.

He is now a renowned organ builder,
with one of his works in Harvard Me
morial Church. In 1983 Fisk will see an
other of his organs in a university
church, this time at Stanford — where
he discovered his vocation.
The original organ is, suitably, a "ro
mantic" organ, appropriate for playing
the works of the 19th century romantic
composers. The modern one is
'baroque', which is built to play
baroque music. The two instruments
will sit side by side, the new one in be
tween the two parts of the present one.
Apart from obscuring the inside view
of the window at that point, the installa

tion will have no architectural effect. A
necessary alteration to accommodate
the new organ was the removal of the
acoustic ceiling material which had
been installed in 1919toalleviateechos.
To replace the former ceiling, Mem
Chu has chosen a sound system de
signed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman,
the group who designed the Davis Hall
sound system in San Francisco.
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel, said he was especially pleased
with the firm of building contractors
who have carried out the restructuring.
At times the scaffolding would be
within a foot of irreplaceable windows.
