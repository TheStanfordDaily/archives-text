## Abel Gance's 'Ode to Joy'—the joy of filmmaking 
### 
My first exposure to Abel Gance and his
epic, Napoleon, was in a Montreal rep
cinema two and a half years ago, when I
watched nearly four hours of silent and talk
ing film assembled under the title Bonaparte
and the Revolution. I had read, in Kevin
Brownlow's volume The Parade's Gone By
and elsewhere, of Gance's fabled use of split
screen, of his early color experiments and his
innovations with the hand-held camera, and
also that he'd continued to work on the film
even after its 1927 premiere in Paris, shooting
sound sequences in the '30s and, as late as
1971 (at the age of 82) trying to edit together
what pieces of the picture he had managed
to keep or dig up.
Bonaparte and the Revolution, Gance's
final effort, began with credits shot in two
tone Technicolor, but they turned out to be
a tease; the rest was in black and white, and
moreover contained none of the famous
triptych footage that, we are told, brought
Malraux and De Gaulle (then a captain) and
others at the Paris Opera to their feet 54 years
ago. The unholy melange of sound and silent
sequences, the scrambled narrative, the
acute sense one got that before him on a
small screen were the ruins of a great movie
— all these presented obstacles to an ap
preciation of what, after so many years of
working out his private obsession, Gance
had come up with. And yet one had to
marvel at the breadth of Gance's vision —
and there were passages so lyrical that they
rendered qualification unnecessary.
On Friday and Sunday evenings, Oct. 23
and 25, the San Francisco Opera housed a
new, four-hour reconstruction of the 1927
Napoleon (two-thirds of it tinted), for which
Brownlow, who has shared Gance's ob
session since the 1968 publication of The Pa
rade's Gone By, is responsible. Its distribu
tion has been handled by Francis Ford Cop
pola and Zoetrope Studios. (Who else? Cop
pola, the greatest American epic filmmaker
since D. W. Griffith — who was also an ad
mirer of Gance — has a history of recog
nizing the achievements of his peers.) And it
now has a splendid full-length scoie by
Carmine Coppola, who conducted the San
Francisco Opera Orchestra's performance of
it last weekend.
Not all of the original reels have been re
covered — Gance originally shot four trip

tych sequences, and this version only con
tains one (the finale, Napoleon's triumphal
entry into Italy) — but the experience is so
overwhelming that a filmgoer ought to ex
press, before anything else, simple gratitude.
It is as if, after hearing Don Giovanni sung in
pieces, in the wrong order and with excerpts
of The Magic Flute thrown in, we suddenly
saw it in a version nearly as close as one could
hope for to Mozart's original intention.
Actually, Napoleon is more evocative of
Beethoven (the subject of Gance's 1936 Le
Grand Amour de Beethoven) than Mozart.
Conceived entirely in huge, sweeping
strokes (perhaps Gance's audacious min
gling of styles prompts me to mix my
metaphors), highlighted by mob and battle
scenes that can truly be compared to Grif
fith's, Napoleon has a magnetic pull on the
audience from the opening scene, a snow
ball fight among the schoolboys at Brienne.
The first object we see is a tricorn hat that
clears the top of the barricade behind which
one of the "armies" fires its wintry volleys;
the hat belongs, of course, to Napoleon,
whose natural leadership is illustrated by this
early military endeavor. The face of Vladimir
Roudenko, who plays the young Bonaparte,
has an extraordinary nobility (and it matches
up well with that of Albert Dieudonne, who
takes over when Napoleon grows up) and a
singular untouchable quality that surpasses
arrogance — no one who saw that face could
be stupid enough to say that this boy was
merely full of himself. Brownlow tells us that
shooting this sequence was so exhilarating
for the kids in the cast that they carried on for
five days in sub-zero weather with boundless
enthusiasm (while a band played on the set);
watching it, one can believe the story.
Gance's tone is joyous and playful; the cam
era seems to be grinning.
During this scene my mind raced ahead to
the episode in the sriow in Cocteau's Les En
fants Terribles, and soon I realized that I
would be making such connections
throughout the picture. For those who have
seen a lot of movies, Napoleon may seem —
just as the great Griffith films seem when you
get to see them for the first time — like dis
covering the Rosetta Stone, for the clues to
so much of the film history to come are con
tained there. The freedom of camera move
ment projects beyond Renoir and Vigo (a

pillow fight at Brienne anticipates the one in
Vigo's Zero for Conduct) to the French New
Wave directors of the late '50s and '60s. The
rapid montage, which out-Eisensteins Eisen
stein, and which Gance developed in the
1918 /'Accuse, and the use of superimposed
images, is reflected in the experimental films
of Dziga Vertov and Rene Clair in the same
period. Our first glimpse of the Revolu
tionary triumvirate, Marat, Danton, and
Robespierre, has the eerie, baroque
caricaturing style we associate with /van the
Terrible. And of course, technologically,
Gance so far outreached his contemporaries
that the release date on the film seems at
times to be an outrageous lie: "Polyvision,"
the technique he and his cameraman Jules
Kruger invented for the triptychs, predates
Panavision by several decades.
However, to imply that Napoleon is only
an archaeological treat for film historians
would be to shortchange it scandalously: it's
a great movie, and great fun to watch. Yes,
one can find plenty that's wrong with it —
the tone of religious awe in some of the
scenes that are meant to show Napoleon's

effect on his countrymen, the sentimentality
of the return to his family at Corsica, the tedi
ous Napoleon-Josephine wooing scenes in
Part Two, and the stiff, Delsartean acting.
This last fault is easiest to forgive, because
Gance cast his actors for the qualities he saw
in his actors' faces, and these faces —
Dieudonne's, Gina Manes's, Antonin
Artaud's — imprint themselves on the mem
ory. Gina Manes, who plays Josephine, has
Gloria Swanson's wide vampness, though at
some moments her eyes are those of Orane
Demazis, the Fanny of Pagnol's Marseilles
trilogy and the star of Harvest; when
Napoleon sees her image on the globe as he
looks ahead to his conquests, we can under
stand how she could inspire him to win the
world. Artaud is fascinating to see in the
small role of Marat — not just because he is
such a famous figure in the annals of theater,
but mainly because, as in The Passion of Joan
of Arc, his frenzied glow is a feast for the
camera (even if he does act with his eye
balls).
Dieudonne plays Napoleon more like a
monument than a human being — a magnif

icent monument, but one that, for all its
strength and romantic grandeur, doesn't
move us. We're more likely to respond to
Nicolas Koline as Tristan Fleuri, whom we
first meet at Brienne, where he works in the
kitchen and cheers the young Napoleon on
in the snow fight. Fleuri pops up in this mov
ie with the delightful improbability of a
Dickens character — as an innkeeper in
Toulon during the 1793 siege, and again at
the beginning of Part Two, when, employed
in the documents office of the Revolution,
he saves Napoleon from the guillotine by
eating his papers. (This is at once the funniest
and most human scene in the film.) Koline
gives the most charming performance in the
picture; the most subtle, interestingly
enough, is that of Abel Gance himself, who
plays the calm, murderous Saint-Just.
One could argue that Gance's historical
perspective lacks depth and credibility, and
fault the movie in a dozen other ways, too —
just as one could say that King Lear has struc
tural problems or that Tchaikovsky was a
shameless sentimentalist. But who the hell
cares? Napoleon isn't a psychological study
of a conqueror, and it isn't even a view of his
tory — it's about the excitement of making
movies. It's about going farther th an anyone
ever had before (and most people have
since), about planting so many glorious sur
prises that the audience becomes collective
ly ten years old and riding a roller coaster for
the first time. Cameras are attached to horses
and carriages and swing, pendulum-like, in
the great convention scene; the screen
breaks up into nine frames to represent the
chaos of a children's pillow fight; a storm at
sea is intercut with the "storm" in the Na
tional Assembly, where the execution of the
Girondins is being debated, and the vis
ualization of the metaphor lends it stagger
ing force. And at the end, when Napoleon's
army explodes onto three screens at once,
we are mesmerized by Gance's cinematic
"Ode to Joy." He employs the triple image as
a kaleidoscope, to create a panorama and for
montage — the sequence blossoms beyond
our wildest expectations. As Abel Gance's
signature appeared across the triptych at
11:30 on Friday night, the audience leaped to
its feet, cheering and applauding. And grin
ning.
