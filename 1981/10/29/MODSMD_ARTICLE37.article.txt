FBI to police food stamp fraud
Washington — The FBI and Secret Service are
being used for the first time in a widening gov
ernment drive to wipe out food stamp fraud
and abuse, the head of the Justice Department's
special food stamp fraud unit said yesterday.
Assistant Attorney General Lowell Jensen said
the "nationw ide presence and large number of
staffed locations" of those two agencies will sig
nificantly bolster efforts of Agriculture Depart
ment and Postal Service investigators, who up
to now have been solely responsible for the na
tionwide probe.
"We do have strong indications that fraud has
permeated the food stamp program in distress
ingly large proportions," Jensen said. "We're
dealing roughly with a billion dollars that is
being wasted through abuse and fraud."
William Murphy, the assistant chief postal in
spector for criminal investigations, said his in
spectors have been hampered in the past be
cause of a lack of information, a problem Jensen
said the addition of the FBI and Secret Service
should help solve.
Jensen also said the intensified investigation
will target "a number of major metropolitan
areas where we believe major fraud in the food
stamp program may be occuring."
He declined to identify those cities in outlin
ing the administration's plan to beef up its anti
fraud enforcement efforts before the House
Government Operations subcommittee on in
tergovernmental relations and human re
sources.
In the past three years, food stamp fraud and
abuse has netted 1,200 prosecutions nationwide
involving criminal trafficking in food stamps,
Jensen said, with 799 of them coming in the last
12 months since the government heightened its
enforcement effort.
Senate fights domestic spying
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee is urging President Ronald Reagan to
drop a plan to allow CIA infiltration of domestic
groups and to make four or five other changes
in proposed new rules for U.S. intelligence
agencies.
Committee Chairman Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.) said the panel endorsed much of the draft
presidential order Tuesday but called on Rea
gan to retain the Carter administration's rule
that almost completely bars CIA penetration of
U.S. groups.
Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.) said the
committee agreed to recommend five or six
changes in the Reagan draft, mostly to clarify
sections "that, in lacking clarity, opened up the
presumption of greater access to civil liberties
violations by the CIA." He would not elaborate

but added that the committee hoped to com
plete its review of the draft order this week.
Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcomittee
on civil and constitutional rights planned the
first public hearings on the Reagan draft order
today.
Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) the subcommit
tee chairman, said the hearing will focus on the
draft's proposed elimination of ruleson collect
ing intelligence information about U.S. citizens
and on the dropping of standards guiding CIA
domestic activities.
Edwards said domestic intelligence should
remain the responsibility of the FBi. "There is
no indication that the FBI has not been doing its
job," he said before the hearing.
The Reagan draft would give the CIA author
ity, for the first time, to infiltrate and secretly try
to influence the activity of domestic groups.
Solidarity workers strike
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity workers by the
millions struck across Poland for an hour yester
day, singing the national anthem and waving
red and white flags. Communist Party chief Wo
jciech Jaruzelski demanded an end to the pro
tests, and his army indirectly warned of Soviet
intervention.
Jaruzelski, a general who is also defense min
ister and premier, spoke to the party's Central
Committee hours after the strike ended at 1
p.m.
"Our national anthem, revered by gener
ations...has become an accompanying tune to
various strikes and protest actions," he said.
"Poland has not yet perished — but it is per
ishing. There remains little time. This blockade
must be lifted."
The army newspaper, Zolnierz Wolnosci,
called the one-hour protest "political blackmail
and provocation" designed to push Poland into
"events reminiscent of Hungary in 1956 and
Czechoslovakia in 1968." The Soviet-led War
saw Pact, which crushed the uprising in Hunga
ry and a liberalization drive in Czecholovakia,
was reported preparing to meet soon in Buda
pest.
OPEC expected to raise prices
Geneva, Switzerland — The world oil cartel,
convening its second meeting in two months
today, is expected to fix base crude oil prices
that analysts say would slightly increase the cost
of fuel and heating oil in the United States.
"The way is paved to reach the target," said
Iraq's Tayeh Abdul Karim, one of 13 Organiza
tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries min
isters arriving for the special pricing session.
"We are very near to each other, so nothing can
prevent us from reaching a unified price."

Several OPEC sources said the ministers, who
adjourned a meeting here in August without
agreeing on a unified price structure, will this
time go along with the $34-per-barrel base
price pushed by Saudi Arabia. The current
OPEC base price, set in December 1980, is $36 a
barrel.
Heart drug trial cut short
Washington — A government agency has cut
short the clinical trial of a promising heart drug,
reportedly because it proved so effective that
doctors felt they could not delay its availability
to other patients.
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
said it will reveal today the findings and implica
tions of its study of propanolol, a so-called beta
blocker drug. A spokesman, York Onnen, con
firmed yesterday the results are "good news."
The three-year, $22-rnillion clinical trial was
undertaken to determine if propanolol could
help the 850,000 Americans who suffer heart at
tacks each year to avoid a fatal reocurrence.
The drug is currently prescribed for hyper
tension and angina pectoris, the chest pain as
sociated with coronary heart disease.
Dodgers take Series
New York — Pedro Guerrero drove in five
runs with a home run, a triple and a single as Los
Angeles defeated the New York Yankees 9-2 in
Game 6 last night, giving the never-say-die
Dodgers their fifth World Series title.
They won it in four straight games, dropping
the first two in Yankee Stadium before winning
three at home and the final game in New York.
In keeping with what they had done in the
first two stages of the 1981 postseason, the
Dodgers scratched and clawed their way to
their first world title in 16 years and their first
over the Yankees since 1963.
