# Senate votes to sell AWACS to Saudis
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€”A 52-48 Senate vote cleared the
way for the controversial $8.5 billion AWACS sale
to Saudi Arabia yesterday, handing President
Ronald Reagan a come-from-behind victory in his
first major foreign policy showdown with Con
gress.
Ending a fierce struggle that had gone on for
months, the vote turned back a bid by allies of Is
rael to veto an agreement concluded between the
Reagan administration and the Saudi government
last February for the sale of the sophisticated
planes and other armaments. j^ f|)
Three senators who had opposed trie sale
switched sides during the final debate, two of them
on the roll-call vote, to give the president his vic
tory. Until this week, the Senate had appeared cer
tain to veto the pact and block a presidential arms
sale for the first time in history.
The president carried the day when 41 Re
publicans, 10 Democrats and Independent Harry
Byrd of Virginia voted to kill a resolution that
would have disapproved the sale. Voting for the
resolution were 36 Democrats and 12 Republicans.
The House voted 301 to 111 two weeks ago to
'disapprove the sale, but both houses of Congress

must reject proposed arms sales before they are
dead.
The White House managed to reverse several
opposing Republican senators and save the agree
ment by sending Congress a five-page letter of as
surances regarding sale of the Airborne Warning
and Control System planes to the Saudis that went
beyond the language of the official agreement
itself.
In recent days, the president had also given top
priority to personal appeals to senators to support
him, arguing that defeat would gravely undermine
his foreign policy leadership. He waged his cam
paign into the last hours of Senate consideration.
Opponents of the sale maintained to the end
that it would accelerate the arms race in the vol
atile Middle East, undermine the security of Israel,
and jeopardize the security of sophisticated mili
tary technology by putting it into the hands of a
potentially unstable government in Saudi Arabia.
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.) told senators before
they voted that the issue had turned into a "Frank
enstein" with "an importance far exceeding reali
ty."
Reagan called it a test of his command of Ameri
can foreign policy. Opponents saw it as a threat to

the security of Israel and to the sanctity of Ameri
ca's most advanced military technology.
The package involved not only sale of five Air
borne Warning and Control Systems radar planes
to Saudi Arabia, but also 1177 Sidewinder missiles,
101 fuel pods and six flying tankers to stretch the
range and firepower of F-15 jets already in
possession of the Arab kingdom.
The president devoted the day to buttonholing
senators, two summoned for private persuasion in
the intimacy of the small study in the White House
residence. His lobbying campaign on the first ma
jor foreign policy debate of his presidency rivaled
the intensity of his Successful effort to cut govern
ment spending and taxes.
"He makes persuasive arguments based on the
fact that we only have one president of the United
States at a time," said Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-
Neb.), after 40 minutes with Reagan. "He indicated
that it is difficult for him to conduct foreign policy
with a defeat of this nature."
And so, after nearly a month of debate, two op
ponents switched to Reagan and two others said
they were reconsidering their opposition. All
three are Republicans.
Slade Gorton of Washington and
William Cohen of Maine switched in
favor of the sale, as did Mark An
drews of North Dakota.
Hours before the vote, Reagan de
clared in a letter to the Senate that
the sale of AWACS radar planes and
the jet fighters are no threat to Israel
and that Americans will be involved
in the Saudi operations "well intothe
19905."
Four of the 24 AWACS aircraft
within the U.S. inventory already are
operating with American crews in
Saudi Arabia to guard against pos
sible air attack by Iran or other hostile
powers. Under provisions of the pro
posed sale, the Saudis would receive
five AWACS in 1985, but they would

be models without advanced fea
tures such as jam-resistant com
munications devices.
Reagan, seeking to allay fears that a
Saudi Arabia armed with AW ACS will
tip the balance in the Middle East
against Israel, wrote in his letter that
conditions had imposed to assure
that would not be the case.
The president pledged that U.S.
personnel will be able to monitor
both air and ground security ar
rangements to protect secrecy of the
high-technology planes. And he said
Saudi cooperation in Mideast peace
progress will be a condition of the
sale.
If the Saudis violate any of those
agreements, Reagan told the Senate,
"the sale will be cancelled and no
equipment or services will be de
livered."
