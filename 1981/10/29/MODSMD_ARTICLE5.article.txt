# 1540 cast fee bal lots
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Today is the "key day" for the fee
assessment election, according to the
ASSU's election commissioner, Brian
Mariscal. And today's weather is the
key worry for Mariscal.
Mariscal said last night that 1540
students had voted yesterday at the
polls, not including the late evening
voting at Meyer Library. "We need to
have about the same turnout (to
day)," he said. "If it is raining, it will
hurt voter turnout a lot."
Mariscal said that the 1540 figure
was approximately 12 percent of the
student body population. Student
groups need to have 20 percent of
the registered students vote on their
fee assessment request and a majori

ty vote in favor for it to be approved.
Since there are 12,400 registered stu
dents at the University, 2480 students
are needed to vote on each issue.
"I must stress that everyone is not
voting on each issue so that (1540) fig
ure is a little high for each group," he
explained. "The number that is im
portant to each group is the number
which voted on each group."
Yesterday's turnout at the polls was
"about what you would have to ex
pect," Mariscal said. He explained
that the voting turnout was better
than the election last spring when
many groups whose fee assessments
were approved by a majority failed
because they did not have enough
students vote on their assessments.
