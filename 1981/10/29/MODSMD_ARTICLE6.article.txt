# New federal laws could decrease gift giving, student loans
## Tax laws could encourage more gifts of small amounts

Although University adminis
trators said they are uncertain about
the effect of President Ronald Rea
gan's new tax laws on annual gift giv
ing, many said they feel there may be
an increase in small donations.
The new laws, according to many
colleges and universities, have the
potential to encourage smaller gifts,
but may reduce the incentive to give
large gifts.
The new tax laws work something
like this:
— Generally, people with large in
comes itemize deductions given to
charity, and those with smaller in
comes take the standard deduction.
In 1982 and 1983, however, those
who do not itemize other deductions
will be able to deduct from their tax
able income one-fouth of charitable
contributions, up to $25. Thus, gifts to
the University nf $100 will only cost

the donor $75, whereas previously
there was no deduction.
— The after-tax cost of big gifts will
rise as the tax rate declines. The main
reason is that the new tax laws do
away with the 70 percent income tax
bracket. Thus, someone in this high
bracket could previously contribute
$1 million to the University and ac
tually be paying only $300,000, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher
Education. Now in the 50 percent tax
bracket, the real cost of the $1 million
gift is $500,000.
"Nobody knows what the real ef
fect will be,"said David Fulton,direc
tor of communications in the Office
of Development. "We won't know
until we see how the gift giving will
be affected."
1 he majority of gifts to the Univer
sity are gifts of $100 or less. Out of
37,000 donors to the University in fis
cal year 1980-81, 23,000 were gifts of
