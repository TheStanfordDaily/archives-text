# New federal laws could decrease gift giving, student loans
## Tax laws could encourage more gifts of small amounts 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Although University adminis
trators said they are uncertain about
the effect of President Ronald Rea
gan's new tax laws on annual gift giv
ing, many said they feel there may be
an increase in small donations.
The new laws, according to many
colleges and universities, have the
potential to encourage smaller gifts,
but may reduce the incentive to give
large gifts.
The new tax laws work something
like this:
— Generally, people with large in
comes itemize deductions given to
charity, and those with smaller in
comes take the standard deduction.
In 1982 and 1983, however, those
who do not itemize other deductions
will be able to deduct from their tax
able income one-fouth of charitable
contributions, up to $25. Thus, gifts to
the University nf $100 will only cost

the donor $75, whereas previously
there was no deduction.
— The after-tax cost of big gifts will
rise as the tax rate declines. The main
reason is that the new tax laws do
away with the 70 percent income tax
bracket. Thus, someone in this high
bracket could previously contribute
$1 million to the University and ac
tually be paying only $300,000, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher
Education. Now in the 50 percent tax
bracket, the real cost of the $1 million
gift is $500,000.
"Nobody knows what the real ef
fect will be,"said David Fulton,direc
tor of communications in the Office
of Development. "We won't know
until we see how the gift giving will
be affected."
1 he majority of gifts to the Univer
sity are gifts of $100 or less. Out of
37,000 donors to the University in fis
cal year 1980-81, 23,000 were gifts of

Opportunity Grants (BEOG) program
(now called Pell Grants) which does
not provide loans but rather annual
awardsto notably needy students will
Idp off more than 700,000 college stu
dents from its eligibility list. Oppo
nents of further cuts suggest that
Congress may put a halt to Reagan's
proposals since his overall plan af
fects close to four million students.
Meanwhile, students here can ex
pect considerably less funds to be
available for the National Direct Stu
dent Loan (NDSL). Director of Finan
cial Aids Robert Huff projects that
the NDSL award will be one-third less
than last year. The current NDSL con
tribution nationwide of $286 million
is slated to be trimmed by $100 mil
lion. Stanford received $800,000 in
new money last year and will likely be
awarded $550,000 for the coming
school year. As for GSL's, Huff said
(hat it is not known how deep the
cuts will be for Stanford students.
Some observers have speculated
that a high delinquency rate on re

payment of loans motivated the Rea
gan administration to make especial
ly sharp cutbacks in the federal loan
program. However, both Huff and
Stanford Bursar Joseph jedd agreed
that the cuts were probably
prompted more by the need to bal
ance the budget than by efforts to
crackdown on delinquencies. Stan
ford has not shared in the national
trend of rising student loan defaults.
The University's loan delinquency
rate rose from 6.2 percent to 7.7 per
cent on all loans handled between
1973-1976, while the figures on NDSL
loans during that period soared from
6.2 to 10.9 pecent. But today the
NDSL delinquency rate at Stanford
stands at 4.0 percent, the second low
est rate among eleven universities in
cluding the nine Ivy League schools
and the University of Rochester.
The default rate on the NDSL
naionwide is currently a whopping
16.19 percent, according to Bonnie
Gold, Education Specialist at the De
partment of Education's San Francis

co office. The NDSL rate compares
unfavorably with the national default
rate on GSL which hovers around 6
percent. Analysts attribute the dis
parity to the fact that universities,
which are not as well equipped to be
lenders, administer the NDSL where
as banks handle the GSL.
The University loaned $2.4 million
under NDSL for fiscal 1980-81. Since
its inception in 1959, NDSL has
loaned $28,800,000 to 12,500 Stanford
borrowers. There have been 212 loan
defaults representing a loss of
$459,521 in principle plus interest.
Stanford officials said they found it
surprising that many universities to
lerated such high default rates on
NDSL since the money lost on de
faults ultimately results in less federal
money.
NDSL obtains its loan money from
three sources: money returned from
previous loans, new federal money
added yearly, and University
matching funds equal to 10 percent

of the federal funds. The main cause
for defaults continues to be post
graduation unemployment which
can leave some people helplessly
saddled with $100 to $200 a month
loan payment obligations. Liberal
arts majors have a particularly dif
ficult time finding jobs with incomes
able to meet large debt loads. Jedd
pointed out that deferments can be
obtained if a student is unemployed,
but many sudents neglect to fill out
the required forms.
Reagan's changes in the GSL
should cut down certain loan abuses.
Under the previous set-up, the
wealthy could take out a GSL at 9 per
cent interest and reinvest it at a con
siderably higher rate. Jedd said that
while the GSL should be based on
need, the government must be
careful when establishing a ceiling.
The $30,000 guideline used by the
Reagan administration might "not be
enough to afford an expensive
school like Stanford." He suggested
that the figure be set at $40-50,000.

Opportunity Grants (BEOG) program

Congress may put a halt to Reagan's

Meanwhile, students here can ex
pect considerably less funds to be
available for the National Direct Stu
dent Loan (NDSL). Director of Finan
cial Aids Robert Huff projects that
the NDSL award will be one-third less
than last year. The current NDSL con
tribution nationwide of $286 million
is slated to be trimmed by $100 mil
lion. Stanford received $800,000 in
new money last year and will likely be
awarded $550,000 for the coming
school year. As for GSL's, Huff said
(hat it is not known how deep the
cuts will be for Stanford students.
Some observers have speculated
that a high delinquency rate on re

payment of loans motivated the Rea
gan administration to make especial
ly sharp cutbacks in the federal loan
program. However, both Huff and
Stanford Bursar Joseph jedd agreed
that the cuts were probably
prompted more by the need to bal
ance the budget than by efforts to
crackdown on delinquencies. Stan
ford has not shared in the national
trend of rising student loan defaults.
The University's loan delinquency
rate rose from 6.2 percent to 7.7 per
cent on all loans handled between
1973-1976, while the figures on NDSL
loans during that period soared from
6.2 to 10.9 pecent. But today the
NDSL delinquency rate at Stanford
stands at 4.0 percent, the second low
est rate among eleven universities in
cluding the nine Ivy League schools
and the University of Rochester.
The default rate on the NDSL
naionwide is currently a whopping
16.19 percent, according to Bonnie
Gold, Education Specialist at the De
partment of Education's San Francis

co office. The NDSL rate compares
unfavorably with the national default
rate on GSL which hovers around 6
percent. Analysts attribute the dis
parity to the fact that universities,
which are not as well equipped to be
lenders, administer the NDSL where
as banks handle the GSL.
The University loaned $2.4 million
under NDSL for fiscal 1980-81. Since
its inception in 1959, NDSL has
loaned $28,800,000 to 12,500 Stanford
borrowers. There have been 212 loan
defaults representing a loss of
$459,521 in principle plus interest.
Stanford officials said they found it
surprising that many universities to
lerated such high default rates on
NDSL since the money lost on de
faults ultimately results in less federal
money.
NDSL obtains its loan money from
three sources: money returned from
previous loans, new federal money
added yearly, and University
matching funds equal to 10 percent

of the federal funds. The main cause
for defaults continues to be post
graduation unemployment which
can leave some people helplessly
saddled with $100 to $200 a month
loan payment obligations. Liberal
arts majors have a particularly dif
ficult time finding jobs with incomes
able to meet large debt loads. Jedd
pointed out that deferments can be
obtained if a student is unemployed,
but many sudents neglect to fill out
the required forms.
Reagan's changes in the GSL
should cut down certain loan abuses.
Under the previous set-up, the
wealthy could take out a GSL at 9 per
cent interest and reinvest it at a con
siderably higher rate. Jedd said that
while the GSL should be based on
need, the government must be
careful when establishing a ceiling.
The $30,000 guideline used by the
Reagan administration might "not be
enough to afford an expensive
school like Stanford." He suggested
that the figure be set at $40-50,000.
Although University adminis
trators said they are uncertain about
the effect of President Ronald Rea
gan's new tax laws on annual gift giv
ing, many said they feel there may be
an increase in small donations.
The new laws, according to many
colleges and universities, have the
potential to encourage smaller gifts,
but may reduce the incentive to give
large gifts.
The new tax laws work something
like this:
— Generally, people with large in
comes itemize deductions given to
charity, and those with smaller in
comes take the standard deduction.
In 1982 and 1983, however, those
who do not itemize other deductions
will be able to deduct from their tax
able income one-fouth of charitable
contributions, up to $25. Thus, gifts to
the University nf $100 will only cost

the donor $75, whereas previously
there was no deduction.
— The after-tax cost of big gifts will
rise as the tax rate declines. The main
reason is that the new tax laws do
away with the 70 percent income tax
bracket. Thus, someone in this high
bracket could previously contribute
$1 million to the University and ac
tually be paying only $300,000, ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher
Education. Now in the 50 percent tax
bracket, the real cost of the $1 million
gift is $500,000.
"Nobody knows what the real ef
fect will be,"said David Fulton,direc

of Development. "We won't know
