# Federal loan cuts may make University less affordable
## 
### Wendy Prentice 
The Reagan administration's goal
of limiting federal financial aid to stu
dents comes at a time when univer
sities are raising tuition by record
amounts.
In 1978, Congress responded to the
more than two-fold leap in na
tionwide college tuition during the
past decade by making the Guaran
teed Student Loan (GSL) available to
all applicants, regardless of family in
come. The cost of the student pro
gram skyrocketed from $331 million
in fiscal 1977 to the current year'ss2.2
billion.
After stating that draconian meas
ures may be necessary to stem the
tide of further growth, the Reagan
administration announced a new
policy: "Families and students — not
the federal government — should be
the first source of funds for educa
tion expenses."
On Aug. 13, President Ronald Rea

gan signed into law the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act, which
subjects GSL borrowers with family
incomes exceeding $30,000 to a
"needs test" devised by the Secretary
of Education. Students in the
$30,000+ income bracket who were
previously eligible for up to $2500 in
GSL money would now have the
amount determined by a formula
consisting of the cost of university
tuition less the total expected family
and student contribution.
Although Reagan's intention is to
help the private sector by cutting
"big government", some observers
believe the loan cutbacks are likely to
make private universities less af
fordable and thus compel more stu
dents to attend cheaper state-run in
stitutions. On Oct. 23, Secretary of
Education Terrence Bell announced
another round of cuts in student fi
nancial aid. The Basic Educational
$100 or less. Yet in terms of real
amounts of money, these 23,000
donors gave only $1.1 million, or 1.25
percent of the total amount of gifts
collected. The total value of gifts to
the University last year was $79.5 mil
lion.
"When you talk in terms of the
number of donors, the perspective
gets skewed," said Dick Bennett, ad
ministrative director of the Office of
Development. "When a few individ
uals give gifts of over $1000, it weights
the other side of the scale. The ma
jority of the donors represent a
smaller amount of the total."
Although Bennett said he believed
the new tax laws may encourage gifts
from alumni who give smaller dona
tions, he maintained that most gifts to
the University are not given for tax
purposes.
"What we find is that the decision
to give is not tax-related," he said.
"Most donors are inspired by a love
of the University, or a committment
to a specific sort of research, or the
desire to let someone else at Stanford
enjoy the opportunity they them
selves experienced."
"The only real place the tax aspect
comes in is with some donors in how
much they actually give," Bennett
said.
Wendy Gibson, student develop
ment director in the Office of De
velopment, echoed this statement.
"People give because they feel
strongly, and that will probably con
tinue despite any legislation," she
said.
Gibson is in charge of the Senior
Pledge program, which coordinates
three-vear donation committments

from graduating seniors. She said
that since the average amount of
money pledged by seniors is $74, the
new law may encourage more sen
iors to pledge.
"I would guess, overall, that peo
ple in that age range are not itemiz
ing yet, and thus the law may help at
tract a few people," she said.
Bennett said he felt the new laws
would not adversely affect the giving
of large gifts, despite the increase in
the real cost of the gift.
"The cost of giving the large gift
will go up, but actually total taxes will
have gone down, so the donors will
have more money to give overall,"
he explained. "I'm not expecting a
decrease in larger gifts."
Carol Swenson, associate legal
counsel in the Office of Develop
ment, also said she didn't feel the
University would lose many large
donations.
"A few years ago, the tax laws were
changed to do away with the highest
tax bracket at that time, the 91 per
cent bracket. According to a number
of charities, this didn't really affect
the amount of donations," she said.
One other aspect of the new tax
laws which may affect donations to
Stanford is the new incentive given to
businesses to give universities up-to
date research equipment.
"Companies are beginning to no
tice this, and I think we may be able
to expect more direct donations of
equipment," said Bennet adding that
it is still too early to know positively.
Fulton and others said that the Uni
versity was not involved at all in lob
bying for the new tax legislation.
"We are not involved in that sort of
activity," he said.
