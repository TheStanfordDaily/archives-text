# Federal loan cuts may make University less affordable

The Reagan administration's goal
of limiting federal financial aid to stu
dents comes at a time when univer
sities are raising tuition by record
amounts.
In 1978, Congress responded to the
more than two-fold leap in na
tionwide college tuition during the
past decade by making the Guaran
teed Student Loan (GSL) available to
all applicants, regardless of family in
come. The cost of the student pro
gram skyrocketed from $331 million
in fiscal 1977 to the current year'ss2.2
billion.
After stating that draconian meas
ures may be necessary to stem the
tide of further growth, the Reagan
administration announced a new
policy: "Families and students — not
the federal government — should be
the first source of funds for educa
tion expenses."
On Aug. 13, President Ronald Rea

gan signed into law the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act, which
subjects GSL borrowers with family
incomes exceeding $30,000 to a
"needs test" devised by the Secretary
of Education. Students in the
$30,000+ income bracket who were
previously eligible for up to $2500 in
GSL money would now have the
amount determined by a formula
consisting of the cost of university
tuition less the total expected family
and student contribution.
Although Reagan's intention is to
help the private sector by cutting
"big government", some observers
believe the loan cutbacks are likely to
make private universities less af
fordable and thus compel more stu
dents to attend cheaper state-run in
stitutions. On Oct. 23, Secretary of
Education Terrence Bell announced
another round of cuts in student fi
nancial aid. The Basic Educational
