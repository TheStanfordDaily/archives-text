## India's consumers struggle for health 
### Los Angeles Times 
Ahmedabad, India — In any
contest to determine the
world's most exploited con
sumers, India's 700 million, if
not outright collective win
ners, would certainly deserve
honorable mention.
With no effective means of
protest or redress, they are at
the mercy of the country's
dubious assortment of sup
pliers.
Inefficient government
monopolies serve up inflated
bills for inadequate basic ser
vices. Private sector businesses
large and small operate with
near impunity, squeezing out
the last drops of profit by offer
ing substandard, falsely ad
vertised products.
Milk is cut with starch. Peb
bles are mixed with beans and
other edible seeds to add
weight to a sale. Sand, chalk,
and iron filings are added to
sugar. Some of these
adulterants are merely un
pleasant, others can be lethal.
Carcinogen used in ice cream
An ice cream vendor in New
Delhi was recently convicted of
using coal tar dye (metanil yel
low), a known carcinogen, to
color his products, while other
traders have been known to
mix used motor oil with edible
fats in order to boost profits.
After bootleg liquor killed
more than 300 people in the
southern city of Bangalore last
July, authorities found that
bootleggers routinely laced
their brew with ammonium
chloride and copper suffate,
then added dry battery cells
and rotten eggs to speed
fermentation.
A recent government spot
check of food on sale in New
Delhi indicated that one-third
of the 60-odd samples
gathered were contaminated
in some way, a figure that con
sumer groups say is represent
ative of India as a whole.
A key factor in the large
number of building collapses
that claim hundreds of livesan
nually is adulterated cement,
cut with flout or other cheap
powdery substances.
Weak consumer groups
Tentative grass-roots con

sumer movements, usually in
urban areas, have occasionally
challenged that exploitation,
but in the most cases without
success.
Efforts to generate a broad
based consumer awareness
were simply overwhelmed by
the enormity of the problem as
well as the size and diversity of
India's consuming public.
"There was no logical aim for
results," said Manubhai Shah,
50, a textile executive who be
came a consumer rights evan
gelist. "Theirs was an intellec
tual exercise."
Shah and the fledgling Con
sumer Education and Research
Center that he helped launch
three and a half years ago here
have become the leading edge
of a small but growing con
sumer protection movement in
a country that desperately
needs one.
Shah stumbled on con
sumerism as a cause while ex
ploring new outlets for his ag
gressive temperament.
But instead of attempting to
launch a mass movement, the
bespectacled business veteran
decided that the law was his
best weapon. Only by focusing
his limited resources on a
handful of well-defined targets
could he succeed, Shah be
lieved.
Case of bus fare hike
After gaining limited finan
cial backing from business con
nections, Shah searched for
quick, easy and highly visible
success to establish his creden
tials. In January 1978, as the Gu
jarat state government pre
pared to increase fares on pub
lic buses, he struck.
Along with three other well
prepared experts, Shah con
tended that the increase vio
lated numerous laws, including
India's constitution, which
guarantees equal protection
under the law.
The state, as owner-operator
of the bus company, was acting
as judge in its own case, he
argued. Working through the
state's law minister, he let it be
known that if the fare increase
went through, those and many
other embarrassing points
would come out in court.

Weak consumer groups
Tentative grass-roots con

sumer movements, usually in
urban areas, have occasionally
challenged that exploitation,
but in the most cases without
success.
Efforts to generate a broad
based consumer awareness
were simply overwhelmed by
the enormity of the problem as

India's consuming public.
"There was no logical aim for
results," said Manubhai Shah,
50, a textile executive who be
came a consumer rights evan

Shah and the fledgling Con
sumer Education and Research
Center that he helped launch
three and a half years ago here
have become the leading edge
of a small but growing con

Shah stumbled on con
sumerism as a cause while ex

But instead of attempting to
launch a mass movement, the
bespectacled business veteran
decided that the law was his
best weapon. Only by focusing
his limited resources on a
handful of well-defined targets
could he succeed, Shah be

Case of bus fare hike
After gaining limited finan

success to establish his creden

Along with three other well
prepared experts, Shah con

India's constitution, which
guarantees equal protection
under the law.
The state, as owner-operator
of the bus company, was acting

would come out in court.
Ahmedabad, India — In any
contest to determine the
world's most exploited con
sumers, India's 700 million, if
not outright collective win
ners, would certainly deserve
honorable mention.
With no effective means of
protest or redress, they are at
the mercy of the country's
dubious assortment of sup
pliers.
Inefficient government
monopolies serve up inflated
bills for inadequate basic ser
vices. Private sector businesses
large and small operate with
near impunity, squeezing out
the last drops of profit by offer
ing substandard, falsely ad
vertised products.
Milk is cut with starch. Peb
bles are mixed with beans and
other edible seeds to add
weight to a sale. Sand, chalk,
and iron filings are added to
sugar. Some of these
adulterants are merely un
pleasant, others can be lethal.
Carcinogen used in ice cream
An ice cream vendor in New

using coal tar dye (metanil yel
