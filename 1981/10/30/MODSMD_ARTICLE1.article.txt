# Zeta Psi fraternity suspended, loses house
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
The Zeta Psi (Zete) fraternity was sus
pended for three years by the University yes
terday, causing the house at 353 Campus
Drive to become part of the regular housing
draw this winter quarter. All 50 membersand
pledges must move out by Dec. 19.
For the duration of the suspension, the
fraternity is no longer recognized by the
University, and therefore cannot hold any
sort of meeting or activity on campus (in
cluding rush activities). No more than two
Zetes will be allowed to live together in any
one residence on campus. Also, all Zetes
must sign individual housing agreements
and deposit $50 with the University by next
Wednesday if they wish to remain in the
house until the end of the quarter.
The suspension is the culmination of sev
eral years of disciplinary action, and directly
resulted from the tossing of a Mills College
student intoa pond at the houseduring a so
cial exchange Oct. 8.
The decision was made by Dean of Resi
dential Education Norman Robinson, who
said he had acted on the recommendation of
a five-member, faculty-student ad hoc com
mittee set up to review past Zete actions and
to interview Zete and Inter-Fraternity Coun

cil (IFC) members. The committee, estab
lished after the pond incident, determined
from the fact-finding reports and statements
from various members of the fraternity that
"student residences can and must be put to
better use," and unanimously suggested the
three-year suspension.
Committee members included Dayna
Goldfine, former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents; Kennell Jackson, as
sociate professor of history, head of the sub
committee on residential education and ad
vising and resident fellow at Branner Hall;
Diane Middlebrook, acting dean of under
graduate studies; Orrin Robinson, associate
professor of German, member of the sub
committee on residences and resident fel
low at Lagunita Court; and Michael Scott, a
third-year law student, resident assistant and
alumnus of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
"I found their judgment persuasive," said
Robinson. "Our limit had been reached.
Changes in the house were not sufficient in
either magnitude or quantity " to warrant
"giving them another chance.
"This was the beginning of the second
year of an arrangement that should have
lasted only one year," he said, referring to
the fact that Zeta Psi has been in receivership
by the IFC for the past year. Receivership

means that the IFC is responsible for over
seeing the actions of the fraternity.
Robinson said "the IFC deserves a lot of
credit for taking on a difficult task."
In a letter to Zete President Michael
Zboralske, Robinson stated, "Perhaps what
is most distressing in all of this is its repetitive
nature," referring to two other incidents in
the last year which upset University officials.
The first was in November 1980, when two
Zete pledges "sandwiched" and "hugged" a
woman jogger near the house around Lake
Lagunita. The other reference was to the fact
that "little, if any, attempt had been made to
clean the Zete house when fraternity mem
bers left last June."
Zete members, however, maintained that
the action was rather severe and some men
tioned that the house plans to appeal the ac
tion.
"Our history killed us,"said Thomas Allen,
vice president of the fraternity We feel we
got a raw deal. We basically got kicked off
because of our past. The University couldn't
admit that we had changed some. They
basically said 'we don't think you're serious.'
"It really hit us hard," he said
"I can see that the University had to take
some action, but I feel that the action they
took is severe," said Brian Bentrott, house

manager for the Zetes. "For instance, they
could have suspended us just for winter and
spring."
Allen emphasized that he felt the attitude
at the fraternity had changed.
"I'm a senior, and I can remember what it
used to be. The main traditions the Univer
sity used to get on us for have been gotten
rid of or destroyed," he said. "Now people
frown on people punching holes in the
walls."
Allen said he felt that "this is the first time
we've taken control.
"Anytime you change an attitude, there's
going to be a few who change more slowly,"
he said, referring to the pond incident.
Bentrott also said there is now an
"enormous difference in our consideration
for others, even though the incident doesn't
bear me out."
Allen said the house had not really made
any long-tange plans. "We're basically just
assimilating. We'll wait until Sunday, collect
our thoughts, and see what alternatives are
open to us. We have to see if there is any way
to appeal the decision/' he said.
Robinson said the only person the Zetes
could appeal to is Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons. But Lyons said, "Based on ev
erything I've read and seen, (the suspension)

was a sound decision. There was no other al
ternative."
Under the current recommendation, the
fraternity may petition for University recog
nition in January 1983, but will not become
eligible for residential status until the fall of
1984.
One of the fundamental explanations giv
en by the ad hoc committe for recommend
ing suspension was what it saw as the Zete's
"inability to generalize about what con
stitutes responsible behavior."
In its report to Robinson, the committee
wrote, "Members of Zeta Psi show a disturb
ing proclivity to focus on particular events
which have gotten them into trouble,
without any apparent understanding of the
nature of the wrongdoing within those
events. The connection between what house
members did to a woman jogger in Novem
ber 1980 and the Mills student this month
seems to be vague, at best, in their minds."
"They seem to have the attitude of 'we'll
submit a list and you tell us what not to do,' "
said Robinson. "That is not how we run resi
dences here."
Furthermore, Robinson said, what is signif
icant about the Mills incident is how it was
handled afterwards. "There was no demon-
stration of caring or respect. For in
stance, instead of maybe handing her
a towel, they argued that she was
dripping on the rug."
Lyons said the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office has decided
to press charges against the two or
three individuals who actually threw
the Mills student into the pool.
"The DA is prosecuting from the
police report â€” in California, the re
port routinely goes to the DA, who
can then file charges on behalf of the
people of California," he said. Lyons
said the charges were filed early this
week.
Lyons stressed that University ac

tion was completely independent of
the DA charges.
Robinson said the house will be
come part of the regular draw this
winter, and students who are cur
rently on wait lists will be able to list
this house as a choice. "It will be a
normal house, similar to 558 (May
field) or Grove Mayfield, complete
with food service and custodial ser
vices," he said.
Zeta Psi was placed on probation
by the University in 1957. It was sus
pended from campus for three years
in 1964. The Delta Tau Delta fraternity
was also suspended for three years in
1976, but that was shortened to one
year, according to Robinson.
