## Mark Swanson Democrats must regroup, find leaders 
### 
Submerged in the tidal waveof Re
publican rhetoric and regality — as
well as favorable Gallup ratings for
Ronald Reagan — Democrats have al
lowed themselves to suffer from a
dangerous and debilitating delusion.
Contrary to media indicators, Ameri
ca is not entering a period of Re
publican "ascendancy" in national
politics. It is unnecessary for Demo
crats to don cloaks of economic con
servatism and communist paranoia in
order to escape defeat at the polls in
next year's congressional elections.
Rather, were the Democrats to pro
test against Republican policies that
will in the long run alienate their
traditional constituencies, the in
tellectual ferment and discussion
that would result could spark the
grass-roots rebuilding of the Demo
cratic party.
But these constituencies are slip
ping away. America has been shifting
away from New Deal/New Fron
tier/Great Society liberalism and in
ternationalism in foreign policy for
more than a decade. The nation is
now witnessing not the kick-off of an
era of conservatism, but the climax of
a trend that began with the election
of Richard Nixon in 1968. Only
Carter's exhortations of economic
frugality ("balance the budget by
1980") and moral integrity ("I will
never lie to you") were persuasive
enough to convince a people tired of
Watergate, Vietnam and "spend
thrift" governments that their coun
try might be better off with a Demo
crat in control of the White House.
The Democratic party's traditional
power base has been shrinking for
years. The size of the agricultural, ur
ban and trade-union sectors — long
strongholds of Democratic support
— has been declining relative to the
rest of the population. Furthermore,
Democratic welfare policy originally
aimed at increasing opportunity for
all income groups (i.e. Roosevelt's
Social Security and unemployment
compensation programs, and Ken
nedy's 1962 tax cut) was drastically re
directed under Lyndon Johnson to
target transfer payments funded by
general revenues for the poor.
As Lester Thurow at MIT would
argue, the siphoning off of earnings
from income groups to raise the wel
fare of the impoverished might be
appealing in an "equity" sense, but it
still generates political opposition
from those who resent their "hard
earned" paychecks being eaten away

by increased taxes. Thus middle-class
frustration at being the victims of a
tax system they perceived as "unfair"
and which deprived them of wealth
in order to assist the "lazy" poor has
further eroded the Democratic
power base. This effect was magni
fied in America's "zero-sum society"
by the appearance of rampant infla
tion during the 19705, which by re
ducing real incomes even further, in
tensified the pains of paying these
taxes.
Finally, the Democratic party dur
ing the 1970s had been de-emphasiz
ing centralized aims and broader par
ty goals while allowing itself to be
torn apart at the seams by the cen
trifugal forces of multitudinous in
terest groups. Democratic leaders
such as Robert Byrd and Tip O'Neill
unfortunately were characterized
less by their largesse of political sav
vy, articulateness and magnetism,
than by their adeptness at the ins
and-outs of parliamentary pro
cedure. limmy Carter was unable to
unify the party because he abhorred
the backslapping and horsetrading
that typified Capitol Hill politics, and
because he both was philosophically
committed to and owed his political
success to the anti-establish
mentarian beliefs he had pro
pounded during the 1976 election.
Byrd's and O'Neill's inability, even in
thefaceof Reagan'sattemptstodom
inate Congress, to organize the party
into a cohesive force of resistance il
lustrates that even had Carter been
more willing to curry favor, con
gressional Democrats might not have
been willing to follow.
But, as George Will noted in a
Newsweek column last January, "the
Democratic party is not only the
world's oldest, it is, because of its
shaping role in the greatest nation of
the modern age, the world's greatest
party." The Democrats cannot now
turn their backs on the heritage they
have left America: Wilson's commit
ment to idealism in foreign affairs;
Roosevelt's commitment not to allow
the "ill housed, ill clad, ill nourished"
suffer from the inadequate provision
of essential material needs; Ken
nedy's commitment to the task of
vigorous technological progress and
charismatic leadership; lohnson's
commitment to civil rights and cocial
equality; and Carter's commitment
to the environment, energy and hon
esty and integrity in government.
The Federalists lost the election to
Jefferson in 1800 not due to John

Adams' obnoxiousness, but because
they had been in power since 1776,
had profited from George Washing
ton's hero status and legitimacy, and
had grown complacent. Growing
complacent, the Federalists had lost
touch with their times. Nevertheless,
Federalist achievements such as the
National Bank remained vital forces
in the national economy.
The experience of the modern
Democratic party is not dissimilar.
Our vital programs, such as af
firmative action, CETA, environmen
tal controls, national energy policies,
etc., even if plagued by inefficiencies
needed to be retained as purposeful
starting points for addressing crucial
national concerns. Programs can
always be redefined, reshaped, and
revised. Waste in government spend
ing can be eliminated without cut
ting back on essential services that
raise the standard of living for the
most oppressed individuals in our so
ciety. As Stuart Eizenstadt noted re
cently,''. . . We must convince Amer
icans that a compassionate govern
ment can also be an efficient one."
Now is the time for Democrats to
regroup, draw out new leaders, and
work to find solutions for problems
that the Reagan administration will
only exacerbate. Sixteen percent of
blacks are unemployed — the
highest percentage reported since
the Bureau of Labor Statistics began
collecting records. Women still earn
only about half of what men make —
partly due to discrimination, partly
due to the fact that they are pushed
into lower-paying jobs. Twenty per
cent of the population holds more
than 80 percent of the nation's
wealth. With rising government defi
cits, interest rates will skyrocket, and
investment will drop drastically.
Democrats can emphasize solu
tions to problems Jimmy Carter spot
lighted in his "farewell address":
dwindling supplies of energy, and
the need to develop alternative
sources; the need to eliminate nucle
ar arms; the need to stand up for hu
man rights: the need to rescue the
environment from the threat of per
manent contamination and destruc
tion. If the Democratic party could
overcome its shortsightedness and
ignore the fact that it was Jimmy
Carter who first alerted the nation to
the urgency of these pressing prob
lems, it might find its agenda waiting.

into a cohesive force of resistance il
lustrates that even had Carter been
more willing to curry favor, con
gressional Democrats might not have
been willing to follow.
But, as George Will noted in a
Newsweek column last January, "the
Democratic party is not only the
world's oldest, it is, because of its
shaping role in the greatest nation of
the modern age, the world's greatest
party." The Democrats cannot now
turn their backs on the heritage they
have left America: Wilson's commit
ment to idealism in foreign affairs;
Roosevelt's commitment not to allow
the "ill housed, ill clad, ill nourished"
suffer from the inadequate provision
of essential material needs; Ken
nedy's commitment to the task of
vigorous technological progress and
charismatic leadership; lohnson's
commitment to civil rights and cocial
equality; and Carter's commitment
to the environment, energy and hon
esty and integrity in government.
The Federalists lost the election to
Jefferson in 1800 not due to John

Adams' obnoxiousness, but because
they had been in power since 1776,
had profited from George Washing
ton's hero status and legitimacy, and
had grown complacent. Growing
complacent, the Federalists had lost
touch with their times. Nevertheless,
Federalist achievements such as the
National Bank remained vital forces
in the national economy.
The experience of the modern
Democratic party is not dissimilar.
Our vital programs, such as af
firmative action, CETA, environmen
tal controls, national energy policies,
etc., even if plagued by inefficiencies
needed to be retained as purposeful
starting points for addressing crucial
national concerns. Programs can
always be redefined, reshaped, and
revised. Waste in government spend
ing can be eliminated without cut
ting back on essential services that
raise the standard of living for the
most oppressed individuals in our so
ciety. As Stuart Eizenstadt noted re
cently,''. . . We must convince Amer
icans that a compassionate govern
ment can also be an efficient one."
Now is the time for Democrats to
regroup, draw out new leaders, and
work to find solutions for problems
that the Reagan administration will
only exacerbate. Sixteen percent of
blacks are unemployed — the
highest percentage reported since
the Bureau of Labor Statistics began
collecting records. Women still earn
only about half of what men make —
partly due to discrimination, partly
due to the fact that they are pushed
into lower-paying jobs. Twenty per
cent of the population holds more
than 80 percent of the nation's
wealth. With rising government defi
cits, interest rates will skyrocket, and
investment will drop drastically.
Democrats can emphasize solu
tions to problems Jimmy Carter spot
lighted in his "farewell address":
dwindling supplies of energy, and
the need to develop alternative
sources; the need to eliminate nucle
ar arms; the need to stand up for hu
man rights: the need to rescue the
environment from the threat of per
manent contamination and destruc
tion. If the Democratic party could
overcome its shortsightedness and
ignore the fact that it was Jimmy
Carter who first alerted the nation to
the urgency of these pressing prob
lems, it might find its agenda waiting.

Submerged in the tidal waveof Re
publican rhetoric and regality — as
well as favorable Gallup ratings for
Ronald Reagan — Democrats have al
lowed themselves to suffer from a
dangerous and debilitating delusion.
Contrary to media indicators, Ameri
ca is not entering a period of Re
publican "ascendancy" in national
politics. It is unnecessary for Demo
crats to don cloaks of economic con
servatism and communist paranoia in
order to escape defeat at the polls in
next year's congressional elections.
Rather, were the Democrats to pro
test against Republican policies that
will in the long run alienate their
traditional constituencies, the in
tellectual ferment and discussion
that would result could spark the
grass-roots rebuilding of the Demo
cratic party.
But these constituencies are slip
ping away. America has been shifting
away from New Deal/New Fron
tier/Great Society liberalism and in
ternationalism in foreign policy for
more than a decade. The nation is
now witnessing not the kick-off of an
era of conservatism, but the climax of
a trend that began with the election
of Richard Nixon in 1968. Only
Carter's exhortations of economic
frugality ("balance the budget by
1980") and moral integrity ("I will
never lie to you") were persuasive
enough to convince a people tired of
Watergate, Vietnam and "spend
thrift" governments that their coun
try might be better off with a Demo
crat in control of the White House.
The Democratic party's traditional
power base has been shrinking for
years. The size of the agricultural, ur
ban and trade-union sectors — long
strongholds of Democratic support
— has been declining relative to the
rest of the population. Furthermore,
Democratic welfare policy originally
aimed at increasing opportunity for
all income groups (i.e. Roosevelt's
Social Security and unemployment
compensation programs, and Ken
nedy's 1962 tax cut) was drastically re
directed under Lyndon Johnson to
target transfer payments funded by
general revenues for the poor.
As Lester Thurow at MIT would
argue, the siphoning off of earnings
from income groups to raise the wel
fare of the impoverished might be
appealing in an "equity" sense, but it
still generates political opposition
from those who resent their "hard
earned" paychecks being eaten away

by increased taxes. Thus middle-class
frustration at being the victims of a
tax system they perceived as "unfair"
and which deprived them of wealth
in order to assist the "lazy" poor has
further eroded the Democratic
power base. This effect was magni
fied in America's "zero-sum society"
by the appearance of rampant infla
tion during the 19705, which by re
ducing real incomes even further, in
tensified the pains of paying these
taxes.
Finally, the Democratic party dur
ing the 1970s had been de-emphasiz
ing centralized aims and broader par
ty goals while allowing itself to be
torn apart at the seams by the cen
trifugal forces of multitudinous in
terest groups. Democratic leaders
such as Robert Byrd and Tip O'Neill
unfortunately were characterized
less by their largesse of political sav
vy, articulateness and magnetism,
than by their adeptness at the ins
and-outs of parliamentary pro
cedure. limmy Carter was unable to
unify the party because he abhorred
the backslapping and horsetrading
that typified Capitol Hill politics, and
because he both was philosophically
committed to and owed his political
success to the anti-establish
mentarian beliefs he had pro
pounded during the 1976 election.

next year's congressional elections.
Rather, were the Democrats to pro
test against Republican policies that
will in the long run alienate their
traditional constituencies, the in
tellectual ferment and discussion
that would result could spark the
grass-roots rebuilding of the Demo
cratic party.
But these constituencies are slip
ping away. America has been shifting
away from New Deal/New Fron
tier/Great Society liberalism and in
ternationalism in foreign policy for
more than a decade. The nation is
now witnessing not the kick-off of an
era of conservatism, but the climax of
a trend that began with the election
of Richard Nixon in 1968. Only
Carter's exhortations of economic
frugality ("balance the budget by
1980") and moral integrity ("I will
never lie to you") were persuasive
enough to convince a people tired of
Watergate, Vietnam and "spend
thrift" governments that their coun
try might be better off with a Demo
crat in control of the White House.
The Democratic party's traditional
power base has been shrinking for
years. The size of the agricultural, ur
ban and trade-union sectors — long
strongholds of Democratic support
— has been declining relative to the
rest of the population. Furthermore,
Democratic welfare policy originally
aimed at increasing opportunity for
all income groups (i.e. Roosevelt's
Social Security and unemployment
compensation programs, and Ken
nedy's 1962 tax cut) was drastically re
directed under Lyndon Johnson to
target transfer payments funded by
general revenues for the poor.
As Lester Thurow at MIT would
argue, the siphoning off of earnings
from income groups to raise the wel
fare of the impoverished might be
appealing in an "equity" sense, but it
still generates political opposition
from those who resent their "hard
earned" paychecks being eaten away

by increased taxes. Thus middle-class
frustration at being the victims of a
tax system they perceived as "unfair"
and which deprived them of wealth
in order to assist the "lazy" poor has
further eroded the Democratic
power base. This effect was magni
fied in America's "zero-sum society"
by the appearance of rampant infla
tion during the 19705, which by re
ducing real incomes even further, in
tensified the pains of paying these
taxes.
Finally, the Democratic party dur
ing the 1970s had been de-emphasiz
ing centralized aims and broader par
ty goals while allowing itself to be
torn apart at the seams by the cen
trifugal forces of multitudinous in
terest groups. Democratic leaders
such as Robert Byrd and Tip O'Neill
unfortunately were characterized
less by their largesse of political sav
vy, articulateness and magnetism,
than by their adeptness at the ins
and-outs of parliamentary pro
cedure. limmy Carter was unable to
unify the party because he abhorred
the backslapping and horsetrading
that typified Capitol Hill politics, and
because he both was philosophically
committed to and owed his political
success to the anti-establish
mentarian beliefs he had pro
pounded during the 1976 election.
Byrd's and O'Neill's inability, even in
thefaceof Reagan'sattemptstodom
inate Congress, to organize the party
into a cohesive force of resistance il
lustrates that even had Carter been
more willing to curry favor, con
gressional Democrats might not have
been willing to follow.
But, as George Will noted in a
Newsweek column last January, "the
Democratic party is not only the
world's oldest, it is, because of its
shaping role in the greatest nation of
the modern age, the world's greatest
party." The Democrats cannot now
turn their backs on the heritage they
have left America: Wilson's commit
ment to idealism in foreign affairs;
Roosevelt's commitment not to allow
the "ill housed, ill clad, ill nourished"
suffer from the inadequate provision
of essential material needs; Ken
nedy's commitment to the task of
vigorous technological progress and
charismatic leadership; lohnson's
commitment to civil rights and cocial
equality; and Carter's commitment
to the environment, energy and hon
esty and integrity in government.
The Federalists lost the election to
Jefferson in 1800 not due to John

Adams' obnoxiousness, but because
they had been in power since 1776,
had profited from George Washing
ton's hero status and legitimacy, and
had grown complacent. Growing
complacent, the Federalists had lost
touch with their times. Nevertheless,
Federalist achievements such as the
National Bank remained vital forces
in the national economy.
The experience of the modern
Democratic party is not dissimilar.
Our vital programs, such as af
firmative action, CETA, environmen
tal controls, national energy policies,
etc., even if plagued by inefficiencies
needed to be retained as purposeful
starting points for addressing crucial
national concerns. Programs can
always be redefined, reshaped, and
revised. Waste in government spend
ing can be eliminated without cut
ting back on essential services that
raise the standard of living for the
most oppressed individuals in our so
ciety. As Stuart Eizenstadt noted re
cently,''. . . We must convince Amer
icans that a compassionate govern
ment can also be an efficient one."
Now is the time for Democrats to
regroup, draw out new leaders, and
work to find solutions for problems
that the Reagan administration will
only exacerbate. Sixteen percent of
blacks are unemployed — the
highest percentage reported since
the Bureau of Labor Statistics began
collecting records. Women still earn
only about half of what men make —
partly due to discrimination, partly
due to the fact that they are pushed
into lower-paying jobs. Twenty per
cent of the population holds more
than 80 percent of the nation's
wealth. With rising government defi
cits, interest rates will skyrocket, and
investment will drop drastically.
Democrats can emphasize solu
tions to problems Jimmy Carter spot
lighted in his "farewell address":
dwindling supplies of energy, and
the need to develop alternative
sources; the need to eliminate nucle
ar arms; the need to stand up for hu
man rights: the need to rescue the
environment from the threat of per
manent contamination and destruc
tion. If the Democratic party could
overcome its shortsightedness and
ignore the fact that it was Jimmy
Carter who first alerted the nation to
the urgency of these pressing prob
lems, it might find its agenda waiting.
