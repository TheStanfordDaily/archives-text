## Cliveden program viable 
### 
Daily columnist Joe Rodota's column (Daily, Oct. 13)
clashes factually and philosophically with our per
spectives of the Cliveden experience. As current partici
pants in the Stanford-in-Britain program, we would like
to offer our opinions.
A copy of the Oxford City Architect and Planning Of
ficer's Notice of Refusal shows that none of the four rea
sons for refusal refer to "Stanford's poor relationship
with the local British population and the academic com
munity at large." Mr. George Docker, director of the
Stanford-in-Britain program, denies that Stanford's ap
plication was refused because of a "marked decline in
the quality of the Cliveden program and the students it
attracts." Anyone reading the Notice of Refusal will re
alize that Stanford was turned down because of logistical
difficulties within the city of Oxford, not because of in
sufficiencies in our program.
Rodota mentions that "the Stanford Program in Britain
lacks any device by which it may exclude undesirable ap
plicants." We would like to know just what Rodota
means by "undesirable applicants." We are all Stanford
students. If we were good enough for Dean Fred we are
good enough for Cliveden. Most people view the ac
cessibility of Stanford Overseas Programs as a strength
rather than a weakness. Mr. Rodota's ensuing comments
about "the perfect buzz" and traveling to the Virgin Is
lands are too ridiculous to merit response.
As concerns Rodota's comments about cost-efficien
cy, Docker assures us that our rent payments are easily
met. His only concern about costs at Cliveden are the
ever-increasing heating bills, but these concerns have
not yet prompted a campaign to junk the Astor Mansion.
For Rodota's information, "The Feathers" is not and

never was off limits to Cliveden students. There have
been incidents of rowdiness at local pubs, but there have
also been incidents at the "O," the Goose and several
fraternities. The 5000 miles between Stanford and
Cliveden magnify the importance of such incidents.
Likewise, we have no problem with the Maidenhead or
Oxford libraries. There have been some problems with
the University of Reading library, but they have been
cleared up. It is true we have no access to the London
School of Economics library, but then again no outside
student has access to that library.
Finally, Rodota suggests that the pace at Cliveden is
"killingly slow." He cites a lack of challenging classes. He
has a right to his opinion, but we feel it should be ac
knowledged that the British system of education in gen
eral involves less class hours and more outside work than
the American school system. Isolation and free time are
what you make of it. As Docker said, "You cannot com
pare this place or Florence with the home campus. If you
are going to come this far, you are not going to sit in
Cliveden."
Rodota's expressed view of education seems a bit nar
row to us. He sounds disappointed that Cliveden was not
a Meyer Library-in-Britain. We acknowledge that
Cliveden has its weaknesses, but we are also quite proud
of its strengths. We offer a vote of full confidence to the
Stanford Overseas Program, the Stanford faculty in
volved in such programs, and especially to the Cliveden
faculty and staff.

School of Economics library, but then again no outside
student has access to that library.
Finally, Rodota suggests that the pace at Cliveden is
"killingly slow." He cites a lack of challenging classes. He
has a right to his opinion, but we feel it should be ac
knowledged that the British system of education in gen
eral involves less class hours and more outside work than
the American school system. Isolation and free time are
what you make of it. As Docker said, "You cannot com
pare this place or Florence with the home campus. If you
are going to come this far, you are not going to sit in
Cliveden."
Rodota's expressed view of education seems a bit nar
row to us. He sounds disappointed that Cliveden was not
a Meyer Library-in-Britain. We acknowledge that
Cliveden has its weaknesses, but we are also quite proud
of its strengths. We offer a vote of full confidence to the
Stanford Overseas Program, the Stanford faculty in
volved in such programs, and especially to the Cliveden
faculty and staff.
