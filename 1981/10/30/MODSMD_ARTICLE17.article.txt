## Majority should have the right to legislate moral structure 
### 
I write in response to Peter
Spivack's column (Daily, Oct. 27) in
which he accuses the National Con
servative Political Action Committee
of trying to legislate morality. He
cites a proposed constitutional
amendment that would ban abortion
as an example of what NCPAC
shouldn't do.
People legislate morality all the
time. In the 1960s opponentsof many
civil rights laws said the proponents

were trying to legislate morality. It
depends on your definition of moral
ity; one might be "fundamental
fairness." It simply is not fair to dis
criminate against someone because
of his religion, etc., but people do.
People are welcome to be preju
diced in their choice of friends, but
Congress decided to draw the line at
employment, public accommoda
tions and so forth. That means I can't
refuse to sell my house to someone

because he is a druid, which is unfair
to me. It's my house and I should be
able to do what I want with it. But the
proscribed discrimination is more
unfair to druids who want to move
into my neighborhood.
Many other laws also legislate mo
rality. How many does Spivack object
to? I think murder is immoral, and
I'm glad there are laws against it.
Seducing children, stealing from
poorboxes and mistreating animals
are also immoral. Simply because a
law can be characterized as further
ing someone's conception of morali
ty is no reason to oppose it.
The abortion issue itself is a mess, if
only because there is reasonableness
on both sides at varying points in the
argument. At eight months, most
people would be upset at an abor

tion, a de facto admission that the
fetus is a human being. If it isn't,
what's the problem? Since the fetus,
if delivered early, would probably
live and would obviously then be a
person, then it must also be a person
when still in the womb at the same
age. So at some point the fetus is a
human being, and it's murder to kill
it.
So at what age would we draw the
iine before which abortion is accep
table, and after which murder? Ac
cording to some, viability denotes
humanity. But this doesn't work.
Viability currently seems to arise at
about 24 weeks. Medicine will only
push this line back. The only logical
place to stop is at conception. After
two weeks, the fetus is a small lump
of cells, but that's what a human

being looks like two weeks after
fertilization. So I agree with the pro
lifers that all abortion is murder. I'm
forced to agree because I can't
logically draw the line anywhere ex
cept at conception. But aborting
small lumps doesn't bother me great
ly, even though I think that's murder
and so probably should be upset.
Hence the reasonableness on both
sides. Late abortions bother a lot of
people, early ones many fewer.
So abortion is an issue where rea
sonable people may differ, and the
legislature is an appropriate place to
settle the dispute. If a majority thinks
abortion is murder, then they should
certainly be able to pass a law against
it. I am opposed to banning all abor
tions. An abortion is justifiable if the
mother's life is in danger. It's fair,

though harsh, to kill in self-defense.
But other situations, from the wom
an's convenience to her mental
health to rape to incest, do not justify
killing a human being.
A final note: In closing his column,
Spivack, an undeclared sophomore,
by his own admission bases much of
his argument on the quotation "of
the people, for the people, and by
the people," which he attributes to
the Declaration of Independence.
That's a tactical error, because "of
. . ~ by . . ~ and for the people shall
not perish from the earth" appears in
the Gettysburg Address. I hope
Spivack doesn't major in history.

it. I am opposed to banning all abor
tions. An abortion is justifiable if the
mother's life is in danger. It's fair,

though harsh, to kill in self-defense.
But other situations, from the wom
an's convenience to her mental
health to rape to incest, do not justify
killing a human being.
A final note: In closing his column,
Spivack, an undeclared sophomore,
by his own admission bases much of
his argument on the quotation "of
the people, for the people, and by
the people," which he attributes to
the Declaration of Independence.
That's a tactical error, because "of
. . ~ by . . ~ and for the people shall
not perish from the earth" appears in
the Gettysburg Address. I hope
Spivack doesn't major in history.

I write in response to Peter
Spivack's column (Daily, Oct. 27) in
which he accuses the National Con
servative Political Action Committee
of trying to legislate morality. He
cites a proposed constitutional
amendment that would ban abortion
as an example of what NCPAC
shouldn't do.
People legislate morality all the
time. In the 1960s opponentsof many
civil rights laws said the proponents

were trying to legislate morality. It
depends on your definition of moral
ity; one might be "fundamental
fairness." It simply is not fair to dis
criminate against someone because
of his religion, etc., but people do.
People are welcome to be preju
diced in their choice of friends, but
Congress decided to draw the line at
employment, public accommoda
tions and so forth. That means I can't
refuse to sell my house to someone

because he is a druid, which is unfair
to me. It's my house and I should be
able to do what I want with it. But the
proscribed discrimination is more
unfair to druids who want to move
into my neighborhood.
Many other laws also legislate mo
rality. How many does Spivack object
to? I think murder is immoral, and
I'm glad there are laws against it.
Seducing children, stealing from
poorboxes and mistreating animals
are also immoral. Simply because a
law can be characterized as further
ing someone's conception of morali
ty is no reason to oppose it.
The abortion issue itself is a mess, if
only because there is reasonableness
on both sides at varying points in the
argument. At eight months, most
people would be upset at an abor

tion, a de facto admission that the
fetus is a human being. If it isn't,
what's the problem? Since the fetus,
if delivered early, would probably
live and would obviously then be a
person, then it must also be a person
when still in the womb at the same
age. So at some point the fetus is a
human being, and it's murder to kill
it.
So at what age would we draw the
iine before which abortion is accep
table, and after which murder? Ac
cording to some, viability denotes
humanity. But this doesn't work.
Viability currently seems to arise at
about 24 weeks. Medicine will only
push this line back. The only logical
place to stop is at conception. After
two weeks, the fetus is a small lump
of cells, but that's what a human

being looks like two weeks after
fertilization. So I agree with the pro
lifers that all abortion is murder. I'm
forced to agree because I can't
logically draw the line anywhere ex
cept at conception. But aborting
small lumps doesn't bother me great
ly, even though I think that's murder
and so probably should be upset.
Hence the reasonableness on both
sides. Late abortions bother a lot of
people, early ones many fewer.
So abortion is an issue where rea
sonable people may differ, and the
legislature is an appropriate place to
settle the dispute. If a majority thinks
abortion is murder, then they should
certainly be able to pass a law against
it. I am opposed to banning all abor
tions. An abortion is justifiable if the
mother's life is in danger. It's fair,

though harsh, to kill in self-defense.
But other situations, from the wom
an's convenience to her mental
health to rape to incest, do not justify
