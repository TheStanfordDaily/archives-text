## 'Petty' debate teaches important lesson 
### 
Peter Johnson's letter (Daily, Oct.
23) chastizes the Daily for publishing
"so many articles of such limited, pa
rochial interest." As an example of
such an article, hecitesextensive Dai
ly coverage of the Phi Delt Calendar
controversy: "very few people . . .
can be seriously interested in wheth
er or not Phi Delta Theta publishes a
calendar, or in what the calendar
contains." Though Johnson's inten
tion, to weed out articles of petty so
cial interest, may have been a good
one, his criticism is fundamentally
misguided.
Granted, the outcome of the
"calendar crisis" does not have far
reaching social implictions. In fact, I
doubt whether this issue has any con
crete implications beyond those felt
on this campus. But the outcome in
this case is not necessarily what we
should be concerned with The real
importance lies in the philosophical
basis underlying the positions of
both the Women's Center and the
Phi Delts. These positions have been
exposed to 20,000 Daily readers; the
campus has since lit up with dis
cussion of these positions. Opinions
have been exchanged and, in the
process, questioned. This is an in
tensely educational and invaluable
process.

This process is what going to a uni
versity is all about. We go through
rigorous mental calisthenics that
push us to explore questions in a way
we normally wouldn't; we must, be
cause our opinions receive the acid
test of intellectual debate. The rela
tive unimportance of the issue is ir
relevant, by virtue of the value of this
process.
I am not arguing that we give up
debate of world affairs; nothing
could be farther from my opinion.
But we must remember that we are
college students, and our influence
over the happenings of the world is
limited. By seeking solutions to prob
lems such as the "calendar crisis,"
petty as it may seem, we learn impor
tant lessons. These lessons we shall
carry with us, hopefully to the day
when the decisions we make really
do have far-reaching social implica
tions.

Bomb hazardous
In direct contrast to Edward Teller
(Daily, Oct. 12) many of us are certain
that the neutron bomb is a hazard to
world peace and that ending the
arms race is an urgent priority for na

tional defense. Physicians for Social
Responsibility (PSR), with 3000 mem
bers, asserts that tactical nuclear
weapons like the neutron bomb
make a full-scale nuclear war more
likely, not less. Herbert Scoville Jr.,
former Deputy Director for Research
at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agen
cy notes that, "The 35-year-old fire
break between conventional and nu
clear weapons is being eroded.
There's talk of flexing under nuclear
muscle and of preparing for limited
nuclear war, although we have no
way to keep such a conflict from esca
lating." Earl Mountbatten, Admiral
of the British Fleet, stated in 1979, "I
cannot imagine a situation in which
nuclear weapons would be used as
battlefield weapons without the con
flagration spreading." The Feder
ation of American Scientists (FAS),
composed of 5000 scientists and en
gineers, published a warning this
year that "the entire industrialized
world could be destroyed in 24 hours
through nuclear war." FAS declares
that nuclear war is national suicide
and they propose immediate detente
and arms control.
I think it's fair to say that in his arti
cle Teller assumes the position of a
dispassionate scientist explaining the
benefits of technology to a public
paralyzed by "prejudice, fear, ig
norance and ... propoganda" (his

words). I would like to suggest that
fear is a healthy human emotion. To
call it a bedfellow of ignorance and
prejudice is to do it a grave injustice.
Recently over 250,000 people
marched in West Germany to protest
the East-West arms race. They are
afraid. They are afraid that the United
States, NATO and Russia might va
porize the battleground (Europe) in a
frenzy of nuclear self-righteousness.
Teller's suggestion that NATO dis
claim any first-use intentions in
naive.
George Kennan, former U.S. am
bassador to the Soviet Union and ad
visor to many presidents, received
the Albert Einstein Peace Prize this
spring and gave a very moving accep
tance speech. I quote one passage: "
... the danger lies not in the possi
bility that someone else might have
more missiles and warheads than we
do but in the very existence of these
unconscionable quantities of highly
poisonous explosives, and their ex
istence, above all, in hands as weak
and shaky and undependable as
those of ourselves or our adversaries
or any other human beings." In the
context of nuclear weapons, fear is
not the bedfellow of ignorance, but
of knowledge.
