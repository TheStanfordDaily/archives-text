# All assessments passed in record election turnout

Students flocked to the Dolls and
forked over more than $200,000
worth of funding in the ASSU special
fall election as they approved all 15
fee assessments on the ballot, said
election commissioner Brian
Mariscal.
Mariscal said that more than 3.3
percent of the registered students
turned out at the polls Wednesday
and yesterday. All but overseas stu
dents' votes have been counted, he
said. Mariscal estimated that the ov
erseas votes would number about
100.
"People realized the importance
of voting and that's, wb.it rhe
difference in the turnout," Mariscal
said.
Groups sought support
One reason behind the high voter
turnout may be the plethora of
posters, flyers, and advertisements
which groups distributed all over
campus. Some, like the Stanford
Band, relied on unorthodox methods
of advertising. The Band rallied about
campus Wednesday night in their ef
fort to round up votes. The ASSU and
other groups even chipped in to hire
an airplane to fiy over the Stanford-
Arizona State game last Saturday with
a banner that read "Vote in the ASSU
fee assessment election Oct. 28-29."
This election saw less-publicized,
behind-the-scene organizations
such as the Academic Organizations
Board and Program fee advertising
for "yes" votes. "Students made an
effort to vote and people knew about
the election this time," Mariscal said.
Fears Irom spring
The reason so many groups publi
cized their need for a fee assessment
most likely stems from the fact that
they did not want to see a repeat of
last spring's fee assessment election.
In that election two groups — Aca
demic Organizations Board and Stan
ford Progressive Alliance — failed
because a majority of voters decided
against them. Seven other groups —
the Boathouse, Graduate Student As
sociation, Program fee, Publications
Board, Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education (SCOPE), Student-
Alumni Network, and Volunteers in
Asia — failed because 20 percent of
the student population did not vote
on their fee assessment.
Since 2349 students (the 20 percent
required in the spring) did not vote
on most of the assessments, the ASSU
scheduled the special fall election.
Record ballots rast
Mariscal said that 4151 ballots were
cast in the election, the highest

number cast since 1972. "My ultimate
goal was to get 20 percent to vote on
each assessment, but I later saw that
we might be able to do better."
ASSU Legal Counseling led all oth
er groups in the number of "yes"
votes with 3090. The group had
threatened to close its doors at the
end of this quarter if its fee
assessment was not approved.
In addition to Legal Counseling
three other groups reached the 20
percent mark (2480 total votes) with
just their "yes" votes, Mariscal said.
These included the Academic Or
ganizations Board, the Bridge, and
the Graduate Students Association.

The groups involved in the closest
votes were the Boathouse and the
Student-Alumni Network (STAN).
The Boathouse had 1818 "yes" votes
and 1320 "no" votes. STAN received
1703 "yes" votes and 1395 "no" votes.
Gwil Evans, Boathouse manager,
said the ASSU-run Boathouse should
now be able to provide more effi
cient lifeguarding of Lake Lagunita.
In addition he said that the ASSU
hopes to put in a public bathroom fa

cility, make repairs to the building
and reshape the beach. "Most of the
money will go towards (paying)
guards," he said.
ASSU officials expressed satisfac
tion with the voting turnout and
termed the effort of minority and
graduate students as "significant" in
the election.
COP give praise
Following the announcement of
the special election results last night,
the ASSU Council of Presidents re
leased a statement commending the
election effort. "We have witnessed a
record turnout at the polls surpassing
even our rnosf optimistic Hopes. The
energy that the various organizations
and the ASSU have poured into get
ting these initiatives to pass has been
staggering.
"While we are not claiming any
mandate, we do claim that we have a
less than apathetic student body.
These students are sending a clear
signal to the University that they are
supportive and concerned about se
rious issues that affect them."
