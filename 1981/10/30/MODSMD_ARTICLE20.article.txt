# Reagan gets lower marks
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Ameri
cans are more pessimistic
about the economy than at
any time since Ronald Rea
gan became president, ac
cording to the latest As
sociated Press-NBC News
poll.
But while Reagan got his
lowest marks for handling
the economy and there was
less optimism about the
economy in general than in
any previous poll in 1981,
the poll reported no change
in how respondents foresee
their family finances over
the next year.
The poll, of 1,598 adults
telephoned Sunday and
Monday in a scientific ran
dom sampling, said 23 per
cent think the economy will
get better during the next

year, while 41 percent said it
will get worse. The rest said
it will either stay the same or
were not sure.
The five previous times
this year when the AP-NBC
News poll asked about the
future of the economy, the
average response was 38
percent better and 22 per
cent worse.
But while respondents in
the latest poll were more
pessimistic about the overall
economy, they remained
consistent with polls earlier
this year in regard to the
future of their family fi
nances during the next
year: 20 percent said their
families will be better off, 26
percent said worse off, 52
percent said about the same
and 2 percent were not sure.

The most recent poll said
more people may be think
ing 1981 has been a better fi
nancial year for their fami
lies than 1980 was: 25 per
cent said their families are
better off financially now
than a year ago, while only
19 percent said they were
better off last january than
they were in January, 1979.
And while respondents in
the August and September
polls singled out inflation as
a more important economic
problem for the govern
ment to help control than
inflation or interest rates,
the latest poll showed the
gap narrowing so that re
spondents thought high un
employment, high inflation
and high interest rates are
about equally important.
