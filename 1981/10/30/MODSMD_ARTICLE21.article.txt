# Further cuts, new taxes warned
## Deficit, work rates drop 
### 
— The government reported Wednesday that
the federal deficit fell in the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, but the Reagan administration warned
that it could climb again unless Congress voted
an increase in taxes and spending was cut.
The U.S. Treasury Department reported that
the government spent $57.9 billion more than it
took in during the last fiscal year, down $1.6
billion from the deficit the previous fiscal year.
Despite the decline, the shortfall was still $3
billion more than had been forecast earlier by
President Ronald Reagan.
The Treasury also announced it would raise
$8.75 billion through the sale of government
bonds and notes next week as it continues to fi
nance the federal debt.
There was also further evidence Wednesday
that the weakening economy is taking a bigger
toll on the nation's job market.
The Treasury estimated it needed to borrow
$35.75 billion for new cash in the final three
months of the year and said it expects to borrow
between $29 billion and $32 billion in new cash
during the first three months of next year.
The financial community is concerned that
continued heavy federal borrowing in the na
tion's money markets to keep interest rates high.
At the same time, a weakening economy would
reduce corporate credit demand, easing pres
sure on interest rates.
The president, who has repeatedly said he ex
pects to balance the budget in the 1984 fiscal
year, hab forecast further deficits in the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, and for the 1983 fiscal
year. - *

Budget Director David Stockman said the def
icit could swell to $100 billion in 1984 unless
Congress either raises taxes or makes further
cuts in federal spending.
Interest on the national debt reached a record
$95.6 billion in the 1981 fiscal year, making it the
third highest category of federal spending after
the Department of Health and Human Services
and the Defense Department.
Meanwhile, a measure of the volume of help
wanted advertising in large newspapers slipped
to its lowest level in September since May 1980,
when the nation was in a steep but short re
cession, the Conference Board said in a feport
released yesterday.
