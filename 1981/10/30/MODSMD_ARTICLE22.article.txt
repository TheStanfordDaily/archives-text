## 'Born-again' banking a future power? 
### Los Angeles Times 
Portland, Oregon — Every
Tuesday an hour before open
ing, the staff of the Stwardship
Bank of Oregon has its weekly
prayer meeting.
Bank President Richard
Wells leads the eight other em
ployees in prayers for the cus
tomers, stockholders, directors
and staff.
"We ask God to help and
guide us in handling our day
to-day financial transactions,"
Wells said.
A prayer meeting is some
thing one would expect at
Stewardship, America's first
born-again Christian bank.
When the bank was or
ganized, the first $10 share of
stock was set aside in the name
of Jesus Christ. The bank, fed
erally chartered and a member
of the Federal Deposit Insur
ance Corp., opened March 13
with a capitalization of $1.6 mil
lion.
The officers of the Stew
ardship Bank are so convinced
that theirs is the right approach
to banking that they are prose
lytizing elsewhere — with
some success, they say.
As Bob Laughlin, one of the
bank's founders, travels across
the nation for his food-process

ing company, he spends his
free time spreading the gospel
of Portland's born-again Chris
tian bank.
"There is a groundswell all
across America for similar
banks," Laughlin said. "This
could become the wave of the
future in banking."
All 350 of the Stewardship
Bank's stockholders signed a
covenant attesting that they are
born-again Christians and
pledging to tithe at least 10 per
cent of their dividends to
Christian education institu
tions.
This is a bank in which tellers
pass out religious tracts to cus
tomers who sometimes con
fide personal problems while
making deposits or withdraw
als.
Stewardship is a regular, full
service bank in a new $450,000
building with drive-in service
and a 24-hour automatic teller,
It has9oo accounts, $2.2 million
in deposits and $2.3 million in
loans.
You don't have to be a born
again Christian to bank here.
"We would like to convert
those who are not, but we
don't put our customers on the
hot seat," Wells said, laughing.
What if a massage parlor op

erator or someone involved in
publishing pornographic ma
terial tried to open an account?
"Legally, we could not turn
them down if they wanted to
open a checking or savings ac
count, but obviously we would
discourage them from doing
so," Wells said.
It was Joe Lester, 65, an engi
neer for Laughlin's food-proc
essing company, who came up
with the idea for the bank
when one major Portland bank
"did not treat my company in
an honest and forthright
manner."
"At lunch with the company
president, Bob Laughlin, I
made an offhand remark that it
was too bad we didn't have a
bank operating on Christian
principles," Lester said.
Laughlin liked the idea. He
shared it with friends. Conser
vative Christian colleges in the
area, like religious schools
elsewhere in the country, had
fallen on hard times. It was de
cided to form a "Christian"
bank and share the profits with
Christian schools.
"There is a lot of dishonesty
and greed "among some mem
bers of the banking business,
Laughlin said. "There are banks
that lend money 4 percent and

5 percent below announced
prime rates to favored cus
tomers. Small businesses are
often given the short shrift,
with favoritism shown to the
large corporations.
"There are banks in Oregon
that red-line evangelicals. They
are not willing to provide fi
nancing to them. Some banks
refuse to make loans to
churches. 'Hey, who wants to
repossess a church?' they say."
Dick Krueger, vice-president
and cashier, says"the purpose
here is different. I look upon
working at this bank as a min
istry based on Biblical prin
ciples. People coming here
knowing we believe in Jesus
Christ feel safer than they do in
other banks."
Wells said that his customers,
knowing all the stockholders
and members of the board of
directors are born-again Chris
tians, realize this bank will be
an honest bank.
Marilyn Lee, 42, a teller at the
bank, worked at other banks
before coming to Stewardship.
"We have a much closer rela
tionship with our customers
here," she said. "There is an
opportunity to share the Lord
with them when they come up
to the window."

"There are banks in Oregon
that red-line evangelicals. They
are not willing to provide fi
nancing to them. Some banks
refuse to make loans to
churches. 'Hey, who wants to
repossess a church?' they say."
Dick Krueger, vice-president
and cashier, says"the purpose
here is different. I look upon
working at this bank as a min
istry based on Biblical prin
ciples. People coming here
knowing we believe in Jesus
Christ feel safer than they do in
other banks."
Wells said that his customers,
knowing all the stockholders
and members of the board of
directors are born-again Chris
tians, realize this bank will be
an honest bank.
Marilyn Lee, 42, a teller at the
bank, worked at other banks
before coming to Stewardship.
"We have a much closer rela
tionship with our customers
here," she said. "There is an
opportunity to share the Lord
with them when they come up
to the window."
Portland, Oregon — Every
Tuesday an hour before open
ing, the staff of the Stwardship
Bank of Oregon has its weekly
prayer meeting.
Bank President Richard
Wells leads the eight other em
ployees in prayers for the cus
tomers, stockholders, directors
and staff.
"We ask God to help and
guide us in handling our day
to-day financial transactions,"
Wells said.
A prayer meeting is some
thing one would expect at
Stewardship, America's first
born-again Christian bank.
When the bank was or
ganized, the first $10 share of
stock was set aside in the name
of Jesus Christ. The bank, fed
erally chartered and a member
of the Federal Deposit Insur
ance Corp., opened March 13
with a capitalization of $1.6 mil
lion.
The officers of the Stew
ardship Bank are so convinced
that theirs is the right approach
to banking that they are prose
lytizing elsewhere — with
some success, they say.
As Bob Laughlin, one of the
bank's founders, travels across
the nation for his food-process

ing company, he spends his
free time spreading the gospel
of Portland's born-again Chris
tian bank.
"There is a groundswell all
across America for similar
banks," Laughlin said. "This
could become the wave of the
future in banking."
All 350 of the Stewardship
Bank's stockholders signed a
covenant attesting that they are
born-again Christians and
pledging to tithe at least 10 per
cent of their dividends to
Christian education institu
tions.
This is a bank in which tellers
pass out religious tracts to cus
tomers who sometimes con
fide personal problems while
making deposits or withdraw
als.
Stewardship is a regular, full
service bank in a new $450,000
building with drive-in service
and a 24-hour automatic teller,
It has9oo accounts, $2.2 million
in deposits and $2.3 million in
loans.
You don't have to be a born
again Christian to bank here.
"We would like to convert
those who are not, but we
don't put our customers on the
hot seat," Wells said, laughing.
What if a massage parlor op

erator or someone involved in
publishing pornographic ma
terial tried to open an account?
"Legally, we could not turn
them down if they wanted to
open a checking or savings ac
count, but obviously we would
discourage them from doing
so," Wells said.
It was Joe Lester, 65, an engi
neer for Laughlin's food-proc
essing company, who came up
with the idea for the bank
when one major Portland bank
"did not treat my company in
an honest and forthright
manner."
"At lunch with the company
president, Bob Laughlin, I
made an offhand remark that it
was too bad we didn't have a
bank operating on Christian
principles," Lester said.
Laughlin liked the idea. He
shared it with friends. Conser
vative Christian colleges in the
area, like religious schools
elsewhere in the country, had
fallen on hard times. It was de
cided to form a "Christian"
bank and share the profits with
Christian schools.
"There is a lot of dishonesty
and greed "among some mem
bers of the banking business,
Laughlin said. "There are banks
that lend money 4 percent and

5 percent below announced
prime rates to favored cus
tomers. Small businesses are
often given the short shrift,
with favoritism shown to the
large corporations.
