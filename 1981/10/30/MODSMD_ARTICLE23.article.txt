# Rudeness draws a slander ruling
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Donald Brown, an at
torney from suburban Torrance, was angry
enough when a supermarket checker was
rude and suspicious over his $25 check, but
he became really furious when his com
plaint to the store chain brought a re
sponse he calls "insulting and humil
iating."
Brown filed a $150,000 suit against the
Alpha Beta market and the checker on
charges of slander and intentional inflic
tion of emotional distress. He contended it
was time someone stood up for courtesy
and good manners.
Superior Court Judge Thomas Freder
icks agreed with him and, after a brief non
jury trial, ruled in his favor. Brown was
awarded a judgment of $500, plus court
costs.
The incident occurred at an Alpha Beta
store in nearby Hermosa Beach, when

Brown wanted to buy three items worth a
total of $13, but then realized he had no
cash.
He got the manager's approval to cash a
personal check for $25, then returned to
the checker, Cheryl Aguallo, 20, who
wanted to know whether the check bore
his home address.
Brown told her the check already had
the blessing of the store manager, that it
carried his office address and that he was a
Torrance lawyer.
Her reply to that, Brown complained,
was "You're not a very good lawyer, are
you ?"
So he got the manager, whoordered her
to cash the check and then walked Brown
to the exit, apologizing. Before he got out
the door, Brown recalled, the young wom
an called out, "There's something funny
about that rh«ck, too. I know it's no
good."
"The whole store heard it," Brown said.

"I've never written a bad check in my life."
He noted that several customers even fol
lowed him into the parking lot to discuss
whether he or the checker was right.
Brown said he did not file the suit until
after Alpha Beta reacted to his complaint
with a letter "filled with untruths" and
contending that he had brought the inci
dent upon himself.
"Instead of apologizing, or knowing any
of the facts, they sent me a letter saying it
was all my fault. Everybody's had these ex
periences," the 56-year-old Brown said
Wednesday. "Most of the time you just sit
there and seethe, but she just went too
damned far."
He added, "I'm sick and tired of people
having to withstand nastiness in the mar
ketplace. There's no incentive for sales
people to be nice unless employers force
them to be nice because the days of the
mom-and-pop store are gone."
