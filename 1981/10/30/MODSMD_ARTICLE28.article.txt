## How 'bout them Dawgs? 1-6 Cardinals meet UW 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford football team, what should be a
weary and war-torn group, travels to Seattle
tomorrow to face the University of Washington
Huskies, usually referred to as the Dogs.
The Dogs come off a sloppy 14-7 win over the
Texas Tech Red Raiders, while the Cardsstumble
out of a 62-36 loss to ASU.
The loss guaranteed beleaguered head coach
Paul Wiggin a losing season — the first in 18
years, the last a 3-7 record in 1963 — and
Stanford fans are wondering what the Cardinals
could have stolen to be treated so badly by the
Big Fella in the sky.
It's not hard to imagine the kind of recrimina
tions that might take place at team meetings:
"Jesus Elway, I told you to leave the hubcaps."
Or, "Morze, I catch you with one more hot
porsche and I'm telling Wiggin."
Instead, the Cardinals appear to be finally
coming together as a team. They go into Husky
Stadium slightly healthier than they were last
week — receivers Mike Tolliver and Don Lons
inger are back, as is linebacker Dave Morze —
and with an offense that finally appears to have
found itself. Stanford racked up 36 points and
693 total yards last week against the No.l defense
in the Pacific-10 even though quarterback John
Elway sat out two and half quarters with a con
cussion.
Under the tutelage of head coach Don
James, the Huskies once again have a slow-mov
ing but deceptively good squad. Masquerading
as journeymen, they still average 306 yards and
25 points per game offensively.
But the real key to Washington's 6-1 record is
the defense. The Huskies are 3-1 in the Pacif
ic-10, good enough forthird place behind Wash
ington State (3-0-1) and Arizona State (4-1). Sev
en starters returned this season from last year's
Rose Bowl squad, which lost 23-6 to Michigan.
"Although they've had some highly produc
tive offensive games, basically the Huskies have

won on defense," said Wiggin. "They are a well
coached team that seems to always find a way to
win."
Leading the effort is linebacker Mark Jerue
with 79 tackles. The 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior
was switched from nose guard to inside line
backer at the start of the season after racking up
124 tackles at the former position last year.
Following Jerue is outside linebacker Mark
Stewart with 66 tackles on the season, but he is
listed as uncertain for tomorrow after spraining
his ankle in action last weekend.
Safeties Robert Leaphart and Chris O'Conner
anchor the secondary with 23 and 37 tackles re
spectively, and two interceptions. Strong saftey
O'Connor, 6-0, 187-pounds, also specializes in
blocked punts, and made 66 tackles last year
even though he spent the majority of the season
in a reserve role. Leaphart, a 6-1 194-pound
sophomore, is in his first year as a Husky starter.
There is one potential area of weakness in the
defense, however. The Dogs will start their
fourth nose guard in as many weeks, due to a
string of injuries that rivals Stanford in the un
lucky category. Third-stringer Dean Browning
suffered a sprained ankle last weekend, and
joined his teammates Brian Stone and Scott
Garnet on the sidelines. Tackle Lynn Madsen, a
sophomore playing behind potential All-Ameri
ca Fletcher Jenkins, has been moved over to fill
the spot.
Offensively, sophomore Steve Pelluer earned
the starting honors at quarterback replacing
Tom Flick, but he was cold last week against the
Red Raiders, going only 6-21 for 46 yards and two
interceptions. On the season, he has 805 yards in
the air for 7 touchdowns and 5 interceptions.
At tailback, Ron "Cookie" Jackson has done a
respectable job thus far, grinding out 424 yards
on 102 carries for 2 TD's. Alternating with
"Cookie" is Dennis Brown, a stocky junior who
has racked up 317 yards on 64 carries for 3 scores.


JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS — In addition to getting
mauled, the Cards also got beat 62-36 last week by the
ASU Sun Devils. This week Stanford hunts for some re
venge and a badly needed win against the Washington

Debbie Zeitman/Dail
Huskies at Dog stadium in Seattle. It will be the the fifth
conference game for the cellar-dwelling Cards, who are
1-3 in the Pacific-10.
