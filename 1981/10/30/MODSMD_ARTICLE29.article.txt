# Card poloists travel to Long Beach for PCAA-Pac-10's
## 
### Chris Addington 
The Long Beach Belmont
Plaza's 50-meter indoor
pool is often the site of ma
jor aquatic events, and this
weekend's PCAA-Pacific-10
water polo tournament is no
exception.
This is the Stanford water
polo team's last pilgrimage
down South before the
NCAA National tournament
in late November, and it is
going to be a tough one.
Stanford will play four teams
from the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association, and three
of them are in the top five in
national rankings. The
Cardinals will go against
UC-lrvine and Long Beach
State tonight, and Pep
perdine and UC-Santa
Barbara tomorrow.
Stanford's toughest com
petition will undoubtedly
be the Long Beach State

49ers. The 49ers have suf
fered only four losses this
year, and they are fresh off a
victory over UC-lrvine by a
score of 8-6. It should be
noted that Stanford won its
last game against Irvine by
the same goal margin with a
score oi 9-7.
Long Beach has good size
and an excellent set of
shooting arms. The 49ers
also have some of the best
talent in college water polo
with many of their starters
coming off of an AAU
championship summer pro
gram. Stanford met Long
Beach once before earlier
this season, the Cardinals
prevailing 8-4.
Stanford's other three op
ponents have also been vic
tims of the Cardinal scourge
this year. The UC-lrvine
Anteaters utilize the fast
break and quick drives that

are characteristic of the
Cardinals' own offense.
Besides the 9-7 victory, Stan
ford also defeated the Ant
eaters earlier this year in an
Irvine tournament.
UC-Santa Barbara has also
fallen to Stanford twice this
year, once in the Irvine
tournament, and once in
the Cardinals' own NorCal
tourney by a score of 12-3.
The 1979 NCAA champions
have lost much of their
former power, but are still a
team to be reckoned with.
Led by Lawrence
Mouchawar, the younger
brother of Stanford's Alan
Mouchawar, the Gauchos
are ranked N0.5 five in the
nation.
The Cardinals' last oppo
nent this weekend will be
Pepperdine University. The
Waves have fallen off
drastically since their 4th
place showing in last year's
NCAA's. They graduated
their entire starting line, in
cluding Olympian and All-
World Terry Schroeder. The
young and inexperienced
Waves are curently ranked
No. 9 in the national
coaches poll.
Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti had a few
words to say about the tour
ney.
"This tournament will be
the toughest one we play all

year, harder even than the
Nationals," he said. "We
have to play three of the top
five teams in the nation at
this tourney, and only two at
the Nationals."
Stanford could possibly
be hampered by a few
health problems suffered
last week. Starters Jamie
Bergeson and Jody
Campbell have both been
fighting cases of the flu,
while the all-important left
hander John Tanner sat out
workouts this week as a re
sult of shoulder problems.

eaters earlier this year in an
Irvine tournament.
UC-Santa Barbara has also
fallen to Stanford twice this
year, once in the Irvine
tournament, and once in
the Cardinals' own NorCal
tourney by a score of 12-3.
The 1979 NCAA champions
have lost much of their
former power, but are still a
team to be reckoned with.
Led by Lawrence
Mouchawar, the younger
brother of Stanford's Alan
Mouchawar, the Gauchos
are ranked N0.5 five in the
nation.
The Cardinals' last oppo
nent this weekend will be
Pepperdine University. The
Waves have fallen off
drastically since their 4th
place showing in last year's
NCAA's. They graduated
their entire starting line, in
cluding Olympian and All-
World Terry Schroeder. The
young and inexperienced
Waves are curently ranked
No. 9 in the national
coaches poll.
Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti had a few
words to say about the tour
ney.
"This tournament will be
the toughest one we play all

year, harder even than the
Nationals," he said. "We
have to play three of the top
five teams in the nation at
this tourney, and only two at
the Nationals."
Stanford could possibly
be hampered by a few
health problems suffered
last week. Starters Jamie
Bergeson and Jody
Campbell have both been
fighting cases of the flu,
while the all-important left
hander John Tanner sat out
workouts this week as a re
sult of shoulder problems.
