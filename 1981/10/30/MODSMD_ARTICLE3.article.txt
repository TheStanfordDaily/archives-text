# Hastorf asks for cutbacks
## 
### Barry Lurie 
Provost Albert Hastorf suggested
yesterday at the Faculty Senate meet
ing that University deans find places
in their budgets for 2 percent cut
backs in order to make up for deficit
spending. Hastorf said that although
the University operating budget of
$142 million appears to be in balance,
there is still an "intolerable" deficit
of $2.8 million. Hastorf's comments
were greeted by mixed reaction from
the senate.
Some faculty members argued that
these cutbacks would hamper much
work on the graduate level and
would hurt all departments. English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz argued that if
the financing for the Western Cul
ture program was cut back, "maybe

we should scrap it altogether."
Rebholz said cutbacks in the pro
gram would be unfair because of the
large time and financial commitment
involved in its development as a re
quirement.
During the two-hour meeting held
in the Law School, Hastorf said if Rea
gan's new economic program "goes
bad," then the same will happen
here.
He said that there must be a tighter
control of the University's internal
economy and that there was too
much spending. President Donald
Kennedy said, "We are not recover
ing fully all the costs."
It was argued that student aid cut
backs for both graduates and under
graduates, which would be necessary

for controlled spending, could not
be done without long-term plan
ning. Hastorf said that there are cer
tain aspects of the University which
must receive constant financial atten
tion. He said the campus buildings,
especially those in the Quad, cannot
be ignored. Ventures for more stu
dent housing are similarly necessary,
according to Hastorf.
During the meeting, the senate ap
proved a steering committee recom
mendation for the formation of a
senate ad hoc committee to review
the questions relating to the adjunct
professoriate, the academic staff (re
search), the academic staff (teaching)
and the status of principal in
vestigators
