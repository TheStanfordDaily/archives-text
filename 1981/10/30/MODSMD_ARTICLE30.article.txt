# Booters sneak by Cal-Poly Mustangs 2-1

### Adam Berns 
Sometimes you take a win
any way you can get it. Al
though it wasn't the best game
of the season, the Stanford soc
cer team managed to squeak a
2-1 victory over the Cal-Poly
SLO Mustangs Wednesday af
ternoon.
The game started off slowly,
particularly from Stanford's
point of view. Although the
Cardinals immediately took
control of the midfield, they
didn't seem to want to do any

thing with the ball. It seemed as
if Stanford wasn't really trying
because they knew that they
were the better team. Al
though Stanford often pene
trated into Mustang territory,
they lacked the midfield sup
port which was so important to
their attack last Saturday.
Cal-Poly finally scored their
first and only goal when mid
way through the half Cardinal
freshman midfielder Tom
McGannon had the ball deep
in Stanford territory and

slipped on the wet field. Senior
Mustang forward Rodd Trevor
quickly took advantage of the
mishap, taking the ball with no
one in front of him and scoring.
Throughout the rest of the
half, Stanford couldn't seem to
put any offense together,
showing a tendency to bunch
up in the middle of the field.
In the second half, the
Mustangs gave Stanford a cou
ple of quick scares early in the
period. At one point, they took
as many as three to four shots at

the Cardinal goal within a peri
od of only a couple of minutes.
However, after this initial scare,
Stanford re-established its mid
field dominance.
At this point it became quite
clear that the Mustangs were
content to sit on their lead.
With strong defense and ex
cellent work by their goalie,
they continued to frustrate the
Cardinal offense.
With about fifteen minutes
left in the game, Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge decided

to put added pressure on Cal-
Poly by playing with an added
forward. This strategy seemed
to work as Stanford found a
couple of close opportunities
to score. Then with only ten
minutes left to play, senior
striker Willie Guicci was fouled
in the penalty area. He made
the penalty kick, thereby tying
the game at 1-1.
This goal changed the whole
complexion of the game. Not
only did the Cardinals now
have the momentum, but it
also forced the Muj.ungs 10
come out of their totally de
fensive setup.
A couple of minutes later,
senior midfielder Jack McGan
non drove down the right side
of the field eventually center
ing the ball to Guicci on an ex
cellent pass. Guicci then
booted the ball past the
Mustang goalkeeper for Stan
ford's second and winning
goal.
After the game, Guicci ad
mitted that Stanford didn't take
Cal- Poly as seriously as it
should have. "We were over
confident and weren't concen
trating," he explained.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge echoed these same sen
timents. "Our game is going
out and wanting the ball. Dur

ing the first half we just sat b.K k
and let Cal-Poly play their
game."
After a thoroughly frustrat
ing first half, Lodge said that he
gathered the team around him
during the break and told the
players to go out and play their
type of game. He emphasized
that they were more than
capable of combatting the
mental letdowns which have
plagued them in many of their
less important games.
One of the bright spots in
this less than spectacular effort
was the fired up play of senior
defender Neil Tennyson who
played superbly coming off the
Stanford bench. "Neil helped
turn the game around for us,"
Lodge said. "He's improving
every game and has been
playing inspired ball."
Another person deserving of

special notice is Guicci, who is
now leading the league in scor
ing with 19 goals, including ten
in the last three games.
Tomorrow Stanford will take
on UC-Berkeley. The game is
scheduled for 1 p.m. here at
Harry Maloney field.
Cal has an excellent team
and is noted for an especially
good defense. The Bears cur
rently have a record of 8-5-1,
which includes a 0-0 tie with
UCLA and close 1-0 and 2-1
losses to Connecticut and the
University of San Francisco.
"Berkeley is 300 percent im
proved over last year," Lodge
says. "They don't score a lot of
goals, but with their excellent
defense, they don't have to.
What they lack in offensive
style they more than make up
for with tenacity and speed."
