# LA 						euphoric as Yanks hold court

New York (AP) — The Los
Angeles Dodgers returned
home to a heroes' welcome
yesterday, while New York
Yankees owner George Stein
brenner considered a World
Series he couldn't afford to
forget.
About 10,000 exuberant fans
greeted the Dodgers at Los An
geles International Airport yes
terday. The Dodgers had
beaten the Yankees 9-2
Wednesday night to claim their
first World Series title since
1965, four games to two.
Several hours afterward and
some 3000 miles to the east,
Steinbrenner held court in his
office at Yankee Stadium. His
purpose was to make clear that
he, alone, took responsibility
for the Yankees defeat, and he
apologized.
"The only way failure can be
acceptable is if you learn from
it. You can sit and say, 'We'll get
them next time,' but that's not
good enough,"theownersaid.
"You have to replace words
with deeds."

The Dodgers won the Series
after losing the first two games
at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday
and Wednesday of last week by
scores of 5-3 and 3-0. Los An
geles won the next three at
home — 5-4, 8-7 and 2-1 — and
the Dodgers trounced the Yan
kees Wednesday behind the
hitting of Pedro Guerrero, who
had five RBI with a homer, tri
ple and a single.
Afterward, Steinbrenner is
sued a public apology that
read, in part: "I want to sincer
ely apologize to the people of
New York and to fans of the
New York Yankees everywhere
for the performance of the
Yankee team in the World
Series. I also want to assure you
that we will be at work im
mediately to prepare for 1982."
When he heard about the
printed statement, Yankee
slugger Reggie Jackson re
sponded angrily: "I apologize,
I apologize, I apologize. Well, I
don't apologize for anything.
I'm sorry we didn't win, but we
tried our best."

Steinbrenner took excep
tion.
"I made the apology to the
fans, that I was genuinely sorry
we didn't do better in the
World Series," Steinbrenner
said. "I don't care if Reggie
wants to make light of it. I don't
want to take anything away
from Los Angeles, but if there's
any player that can stand up
and say he acquitted himself as
a Yankee should, he doesn't
belong in the uniform."
Jackson could become a free
agent this year, and Steinbren
ner said he hadn't talked to him
yet about the chances of him
returning to pinstripes in 1982.
The 35-year-old Jackson is
one of several older Yankees
players who could move on
next year when Steinbrenner
begins remodeling his club.
Steinbrenner said Thursday
that changes might also in
clude the team's philosophy as
well as personnel.
There was nothing unique,
however, about Steinbrenner's
position. The Dodgers find
themselves in a similar situ
ation. In fact, while the starting
lineup of the Yankees Wednes
day night included only three
men under 30, the Dodgers' in
cluded just one, Guerrero, 25.
The Dodgers infield — Steve
Garvey, 32, at first base; Davey
Lopes, 35, at second; Bill Rus
sell, 33, at shortstop, and Ron
Cey, 33, at third — has been to
gether for a decade.
Lopes set a record for second
basemen by committing six er
rors in the Series, and he may
be gone to make way for Steve
Sax, who played much of the
second half of the season.
"They can break us up, they
can tear us apart, but they can

never take away that ring,"
Lopes said after the Dodgers'
Game 6 victory. "All those er
rors don't mean a thing now,
do they?"
Garvey, who hit .417 in the
Series without an RBI, and Cey,
.350 with six RBI, probably are
the only two untouchable
members of the Dodgers in
field. Garvey called the World
Series victory the "end of a very
sentimental journey."
"This infield might not be to
gether next year, and we've
worked together so hard for so
long," Garvey said. "What bet
ter way to win a cham
pionship?"
The Dodgers overcame set
backs at nearly every turn to
win the Series. They lost in 1977
and '78 to the Yankees, each
time in six games. They had not
won a Series since 1965, beat
ing the Minnesota Twins in sev
en. Of the 10 previous World
Series meetings between the
Yankees and Dodgers, the
Dodgers had won only twice,
the first time in 1955 and again
in 1963.
"There will never be another
moment like this because it's
the first for us," Garvey said.
"For 25 years, I've sweated and
toiled, both physically and
mentally, for this moment.
"The ultimate goal is the
world championship."
Guerrero, Garvey and
Yeager were voted co-Most
Valuable Players of the Series.
The 32-year-old Yeager, who
started only 22 games during
the season while playing
backup to young Mike
Scioscia, might have summed it
up for the Dodgers.
"This is the best moment of
my life," Yeagersaid.
