## Last minute miscellany 
### 
I was sitting at home last night, eating a delicious
spaghetti dinner and listening to the stereo, when the
phone rang. Well, as was my wont, 1 picked it up. At first the
stereo was too loud to hear, so I had to go turn it down.
When I got back to the phone, I was told that the Daily was
in desperate need of a column. You know — filler.
Well hey, I'm a student. I had things to do last night, too.
So I tell the guy on the other end (who happened to be
Mike Oneal, the sportseditor here) that there's noway I can
doit. Know what he says? "Buy ya'aMichelob Light. . ."
Now, would a guy really write a column, just for a light
beer? See for yourself.
NEEDED: In light of the football team's, well, let's not
sugar-coat it, pathetic luck so far thisyear, I think we need
some good Stanford Football Jokes. Now I'm notsayingwe
should make fun of the football team — after all, Doug
Rogers never bothers you when your LOTS program
doesn't work (English majors read: "when youressay
stinks"; Engineers read: "when your buildingcollapses";
,premeds read: very little). I imagine, however, that the guys
need to loosen up a little bit. Maybe a few jokes would help.
So here's the deal: I've thought up questions for a few
potentially hilarious jokes. Now I need the punchlines.
How many Stanford football teams does it take to screw in
a light bulb?
(fill in punchline here)
Why did the Stanford football team cross the road?
(fill in punchline here)
What do you get when you cross the Stanford football
team with a crazed weasel?
(punch in fill line here)
Where does the Stanford football team sleep?
("Anywhere it wants" or "at Rickeys"are not acceptable.
If you answered with either, give yourself a record of 1-6, go
directly to spring practice and do not collect scholarship.)
Why does Paul Wiggin wear red suspenders?
("to keep his job" is not very funny, but certainly
acceptable.)
RIDICULOUSNESS: As I read theSan lose Mercury in my
usual desperate rush yesterday morning, I noticed a story by
Dan Hruby, one of the paper's sports columnists. Hruby, it
seems, decided to grade the local college coaches on their
performances thusfar this season. Paul Wiggin, thosewho
don't subscribe to the Mercury might be interested to
know, was given a D+.
Interesting. But I don't believe Mr. Hruby did his
homework before writing the column. Nobody at Stanford
takes a D + , Dan. Wiggin would've taken, ahem, a pass. For
football coaches here, you see, it's either pass, or. . .no
credit.
WORLD DREARIES: The Funniest Sight of the Series
Award has got to go to Steve Garvey, who, when accepting
his co-MVP award, looked more like Howdy-Doodey than
any living person. Where does heget thatsmile? Why
doesn't someone get rid of it??
Another funny thing about the Series was George
Steinbrenner, who's really almost always good for a laugh. I
liked the way they kept flashing up to the box where
Curious George was taking "notes" every time the Dodgers
did anything right. Notes. Sure. . .a shopping list, you mean.

So I tell the guy on the other end (who happened to be
Mike Oneal, the sportseditor here) that there's noway I can
doit. Know what he says? "Buy ya'aMichelob Light. . ."
Now, would a guy really write a column, just for a light
beer? See for yourself.
NEEDED: In light of the football team's, well, let's not
sugar-coat it, pathetic luck so far thisyear, I think we need
some good Stanford Football Jokes. Now I'm notsayingwe
should make fun of the football team — after all, Doug
Rogers never bothers you when your LOTS program
doesn't work (English majors read: "when youressay
stinks"; Engineers read: "when your buildingcollapses";
,premeds read: very little). I imagine, however, that the guys
need to loosen up a little bit. Maybe a few jokes would help.
So here's the deal: I've thought up questions for a few
potentially hilarious jokes. Now I need the punchlines.
How many Stanford football teams does it take to screw in
a light bulb?
(fill in punchline here)
Why did the Stanford football team cross the road?
(fill in punchline here)
What do you get when you cross the Stanford football
team with a crazed weasel?
(punch in fill line here)
Where does the Stanford football team sleep?
("Anywhere it wants" or "at Rickeys"are not acceptable.
If you answered with either, give yourself a record of 1-6, go
directly to spring practice and do not collect scholarship.)
Why does Paul Wiggin wear red suspenders?
("to keep his job" is not very funny, but certainly
acceptable.)
RIDICULOUSNESS: As I read theSan lose Mercury in my
usual desperate rush yesterday morning, I noticed a story by
Dan Hruby, one of the paper's sports columnists. Hruby, it
seems, decided to grade the local college coaches on their
performances thusfar this season. Paul Wiggin, thosewho
don't subscribe to the Mercury might be interested to
know, was given a D+.
Interesting. But I don't believe Mr. Hruby did his
homework before writing the column. Nobody at Stanford
takes a D + , Dan. Wiggin would've taken, ahem, a pass. For
football coaches here, you see, it's either pass, or. . .no
credit.
WORLD DREARIES: The Funniest Sight of the Series
Award has got to go to Steve Garvey, who, when accepting
his co-MVP award, looked more like Howdy-Doodey than
any living person. Where does heget thatsmile? Why
doesn't someone get rid of it??
Another funny thing about the Series was George
Steinbrenner, who's really almost always good for a laugh. I
liked the way they kept flashing up to the box where
Curious George was taking "notes" every time the Dodgers
did anything right. Notes. Sure. . .a shopping list, you mean.
