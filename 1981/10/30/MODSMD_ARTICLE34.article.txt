# From Candlestick to Stanford Med
## 49er Milt McColl: has scalpel, will tackle 
### Nick Gault 
Milt McColl may be the model Stan
ford athlete. In his four years on the
Farm he combined a football career as
one of the most esteemed linebackers
in the Pacific-10 Conference with a
noteably successful academic per
formance.
This year he has made the grade with
the suddenly great San Francisco 49ers
of the National Football League and, at
the same time, is a student at the Stan
ford Medical School.
You can't help but think McColl is in
some way superhuman — he seems to
have no problem fitting two full time
occupations into his life and, moreover,
excelling at them.
But McColl shrugs off the suggestion
he's doing anything really ex
traordinary.
"I didn't find playing football at Stan

ford an obstacle to my doing well aca
demically at all," McColl says. "In fact, I
think it helped. Doing something physi
cally enjoyable puts you in a great state
of mind for studying afterwards."
Talking to McColl however, you un
derstand very quickly there's more to
his success than his ability to blend, or
complement, athletics with academics:
Milt McColl is as highly motivated a
person as you will ever find. Football
and medicine both are things he wants
very badly to do well at and he is willing
to invest however much work is re
quired.
McColl made the 49ers this summer
as a free agent and has performed most
ly on special teams to this date. That
may seem like enough to please most
any rookie in the National Football
League, but not Milt.
"You've got to want to play in this
league," he says."I can't sit back and

expect to be successful. I want very bad
ly to get a starting position at line
backer."
The obvious question concerning
Milt McColl, as that rare individual who
possesses both great brain and great
brawn, is which does he value more, a
career as a pro football player or a prac
tice in medicine? Not surprisingly,
McColl has a well-thought out position
on this matter.
"The main reason I chose Stanford
four years ago was the academic op
portunities it presented, and today I'm
most thankful for that," h« says."I nev
er thought about pro football back then
because it was too far away and there
was no guarantee I would make it."
Today, McColl is as aware as he ever
was of what the realities and potential
hazards of football are.
"I know that even having made the

49ers, pro football is still a very uncer
tain, insecure proposition," he says.
"It's an exciting thing to be involved in
and I hope to stay involved for a few
years. But I know there will be a time
when I can't play. Injuries and aging are
unavoidable.
"Football is my number one thing
right now. I have an obligation to the
49ers to do what they ask of me. But
there will come a time to take up medi
cine."
This year, you can find the tall figure
of McColl walking up and down the
Stanford sideline at Cardinal home
games. As part of a Stanford football
tradition — Milt was the third McColl to
play football here — he has a special
feeling for the team.
"I still feel a real closeness to the
team. It makes me feel good to walk the
sidelines and offer some help if I can."

as a free agent and has performed most
ly on special teams to this date. That
may seem like enough to please most
any rookie in the National Football
League, but not Milt.
"You've got to want to play in this
league," he says."I can't sit back and

expect to be successful. I want very bad
ly to get a starting position at line
backer."
The obvious question concerning
Milt McColl, as that rare individual who
possesses both great brain and great
brawn, is which does he value more, a
career as a pro football player or a prac
tice in medicine? Not surprisingly,
McColl has a well-thought out position
on this matter.
"The main reason I chose Stanford
four years ago was the academic op
portunities it presented, and today I'm
most thankful for that," h« says."I nev
er thought about pro football back then
because it was too far away and there
was no guarantee I would make it."
Today, McColl is as aware as he ever
was of what the realities and potential
hazards of football are.
"I know that even having made the

49ers, pro football is still a very uncer
tain, insecure proposition," he says.
"It's an exciting thing to be involved in
and I hope to stay involved for a few
years. But I know there will be a time
when I can't play. Injuries and aging are
unavoidable.
"Football is my number one thing
right now. I have an obligation to the
49ers to do what they ask of me. But
there will come a time to take up medi
cine."
This year, you can find the tall figure
of McColl walking up and down the
Stanford sideline at Cardinal home
games. As part of a Stanford football
tradition — Milt was the third McColl to
play football here — he has a special
feeling for the team.
"I still feel a real closeness to the
team. It makes me feel good to walk the
sidelines and offer some help if I can."
