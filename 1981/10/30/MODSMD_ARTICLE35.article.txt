# NBA—on the heels of the Series
## 
### Associated Press 
Two weeks later than usual,
the National Basketball As
sociation season gets under
way tonight, with the Boston
Celtics opening defense of
their championship at home
against the revamped Wash
ington Bullets.
Boston is trying to become
the first NBA team to defend its
title since the Celtics of 1968-69
won their 11th championship
in 13 years. A sellout crowd is
expected at Boston Garden to
greet the Celtics for the first
time since they beat the Hous
ton Rockets for the 1981 title in
six games last spring.
The NBA pushed back the
start of the season to avoid con
flict with the World Series. The
strategy backfired somewhat
with baseball adding another
playoff round due to a mid
season strike, moving the end
ing of the Series to this week.
The NBA's late start, however,
means the playoffs won't end
until the middle of June.
Twenty of the league's 23
teams are in action tonight,
with only Seattle, San Diego
and Denver idle.
In addition to the Washing
ton-Boston game, the rest of
the schedule includes: The
New York Knicks at the New
Jersey Nets in the first regular
season game to be played in
the Meadowlands Arena; the
Cleveland Cavaliers at the Phil
adelphia 76ers; the Milwaukee
Bucks at the Detroit Pistons;
the Chicago Bulls at the Indi
ana Pacers; the San Antonio
Spurs at the Kansas City Kings;
the Golden State Warriors at
the Denver Nuggets; the Dallas
Mavericks at the Utah Jazz; the
Phoenix Suns at the Portland
Trail Blazers, and in a game to
be nationally televised (CBS,
11:30 EST), the Los Angeles
Lakers entertain the Houston
Rockets.
The Celtics' route to another
championship is expected to
be strongly challenged by the

76ers, Lakers, Sorties, Suns and
Bucks. Still, the Celtics have a
good chance of repeating. Its
frontcourt of Larry Bird, Cedric
Maxwell, Robert Parish, Kevin
McHale and Rick Robey is
among the best in the league.
Elsewhere in the Atlantic
Division, Philadelphia returns
11 veterans, including NBA
Most Valuable Player Julius Erv
ing, and has No.l pick Franklin
Edwards, a guard from Cleve
land State. Most of the 23 teams
took advantage of the new
league rule allowing 12 players
on the roster.
The Knicks appear to have
strengthened themselves with
the addition of veterans
Maurice Lucas, Mike Newi/n
and Randy Smith. The Nets,
with over 11,000 season tickets
sold in their new arena, have a
new coach, Larry Brown, new
players, Otis Birdsong, Buck
Williams, Ray Tolbert, Albert
King and Ray Williams, and an
old problem, the lack of a
bonafide center. The Bullets'
days of Wes Unseld, Elvin
Hayes, Mitch Kupchak and
Bobby Dandridge are over.
Washington has signed veter
ans Spencer Haywood and
John Lucas and acquired Jim

Chones and Brad Holland in
trades.
The Central Division could
be a tossup among the Atlanta
Hawks, Milwaukee Bucks and
Chicago Bulls, providing they
all have their full teams. Due to
a string of injuries, the Hawks,
under new Coach Kevin
Loughery, will begin the sea
son without starters Wes Mat
thews, Eddie Johnson and John
Drew and a top reserve, Al
Wood.
The Pistons have new life
with rookies Isiah Thomas and
Kelly Tripucka. The Pacers have
benched George McGinnis in
favor of Louis Orr, and the
Cavaliers hope free agents
James Edwards, Bobby
Wilkerson and Scott Wedman
turn around the struggling
franchise.
In the Midwest Division, the
Kansas City Kings have a new
look. Gone are free agents
Birdsong and Wedman. The
new Kings include Steve John
son, Cliff Robinson, Eddie
Johnson and Kevin Loder.
Denver, with its run and gun
style under Doug Moe, have
much improved forward Kiki
Vandeweghe to start the sea
son. Utah, led by NBA scoring

champion Adrian Dantley and
1981 Rookie of the Year Darrell
Griffith, is hoping that No.l
draft pick Danny Schayes can
get some rebounds, and the
Mavericks, with rookies Mark
Aguirre, Rolando Blackman
and Jay Vincent, should do bet
ter than the 15 victories they
had last season.
In the Western Divison, the
Lakers' starting five of Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Kupchak,
Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson
and Norm Nixon is among the
best in the league. The Seattle
SuperSonics, with Gus Williams
back and Lonnie Shelton
healthy, are a different team
than the one that won only 34
games last season.
The Suns will have a tough
time replacing All-Star guard
Walter Davis, out at least six
weeks with a fractured elbow.
The Blazers have lots of talent
with Mychal Thompson, Kelvin
Ransey, Jim Paxson and Billy
Ray Bates. The Warriors will
rely on high scorers Bernard
King and Lloyd Free but will
miss rebounder Larry Smith, a
holdout, and the San Diego
Clippers are building around
young forwards Michael
Brooks and Tom Chambers.

new Kings include Steve John
son, Cliff Robinson, Eddie
Johnson and Kevin Loder.
Denver, with its run and gun
style under Doug Moe, have
much improved forward Kiki
Vandeweghe to start the sea
son. Utah, led by NBA scoring

champion Adrian Dantley and
1981 Rookie of the Year Darrell
Griffith, is hoping that No.l
draft pick Danny Schayes can
get some rebounds, and the
Mavericks, with rookies Mark
Aguirre, Rolando Blackman
and Jay Vincent, should do bet
ter than the 15 victories they
had last season.
In the Western Divison, the
Lakers' starting five of Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Kupchak,
Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson
and Norm Nixon is among the
best in the league. The Seattle
SuperSonics, with Gus Williams
back and Lonnie Shelton
healthy, are a different team
than the one that won only 34
games last season.
The Suns will have a tough
time replacing All-Star guard
Walter Davis, out at least six
weeks with a fractured elbow.
The Blazers have lots of talent
with Mychal Thompson, Kelvin
Ransey, Jim Paxson and Billy
Ray Bates. The Warriors will
rely on high scorers Bernard
King and Lloyd Free but will
miss rebounder Larry Smith, a
holdout, and the San Diego
Clippers are building around
young forwards Michael
Brooks and Tom Chambers.


CARD BUCK STANCS — The Stanford soccer team edged
a tough Cal-Polv SLO Wednesday 2-1. It was a sluggish
game for the Cards and they have yet to show that they

Scott Chdn 'Ddily
can play consistent, inspired soccer game to game. Stan
lord plays the Golden Bears of Berkeley tomorrow.
Two weeks later than usual,
the National Basketball As
sociation season gets under
way tonight, with the Boston
Celtics opening defense of
their championship at home
against the revamped Wash
ington Bullets.
Boston is trying to become
the first NBA team to defend its
title since the Celtics of 1968-69
won their 11th championship
in 13 years. A sellout crowd is
expected at Boston Garden to
greet the Celtics for the first
time since they beat the Hous
ton Rockets for the 1981 title in
six games last spring.
The NBA pushed back the
start of the season to avoid con
flict with the World Series. The
strategy backfired somewhat
with baseball adding another
playoff round due to a mid
season strike, moving the end
ing of the Series to this week.
The NBA's late start, however,
means the playoffs won't end
until the middle of June.
Twenty of the league's 23
teams are in action tonight,
with only Seattle, San Diego
and Denver idle.
In addition to the Washing
ton-Boston game, the rest of
the schedule includes: The
New York Knicks at the New
Jersey Nets in the first regular
season game to be played in
the Meadowlands Arena; the
Cleveland Cavaliers at the Phil
adelphia 76ers; the Milwaukee
Bucks at the Detroit Pistons;
the Chicago Bulls at the Indi
ana Pacers; the San Antonio
Spurs at the Kansas City Kings;
the Golden State Warriors at
the Denver Nuggets; the Dallas
Mavericks at the Utah Jazz; the
Phoenix Suns at the Portland
Trail Blazers, and in a game to
be nationally televised (CBS,
11:30 EST), the Los Angeles
Lakers entertain the Houston
Rockets.
The Celtics' route to another
championship is expected to
be strongly challenged by the

76ers, Lakers, Sorties, Suns and
Bucks. Still, the Celtics have a
good chance of repeating. Its
frontcourt of Larry Bird, Cedric
Maxwell, Robert Parish, Kevin
McHale and Rick Robey is
among the best in the league.
Elsewhere in the Atlantic
Division, Philadelphia returns
11 veterans, including NBA
Most Valuable Player Julius Erv
ing, and has No.l pick Franklin
Edwards, a guard from Cleve
land State. Most of the 23 teams
took advantage of the new
league rule allowing 12 players
on the roster.
The Knicks appear to have
strengthened themselves with
the addition of veterans
Maurice Lucas, Mike Newi/n
and Randy Smith. The Nets,
with over 11,000 season tickets
sold in their new arena, have a
new coach, Larry Brown, new
players, Otis Birdsong, Buck
Williams, Ray Tolbert, Albert
King and Ray Williams, and an
old problem, the lack of a
bonafide center. The Bullets'
days of Wes Unseld, Elvin
Hayes, Mitch Kupchak and
Bobby Dandridge are over.
Washington has signed veter
ans Spencer Haywood and
John Lucas and acquired Jim

Chones and Brad Holland in
trades.
The Central Division could
be a tossup among the Atlanta
Hawks, Milwaukee Bucks and
Chicago Bulls, providing they
all have their full teams. Due to
a string of injuries, the Hawks,
under new Coach Kevin
Loughery, will begin the sea
son without starters Wes Mat
thews, Eddie Johnson and John
Drew and a top reserve, Al
Wood.
The Pistons have new life
with rookies Isiah Thomas and
Kelly Tripucka. The Pacers have
benched George McGinnis in
favor of Louis Orr, and the
Cavaliers hope free agents
James Edwards, Bobby
Wilkerson and Scott Wedman
turn around the struggling
franchise.
In the Midwest Division, the
Kansas City Kings have a new
look. Gone are free agents
Birdsong and Wedman. The
new Kings include Steve John
son, Cliff Robinson, Eddie
Johnson and Kevin Loder.
Denver, with its run and gun
