### 
Philadelphia (AP) — The
Carpenter family, which
bought the Philadelphia
Phillies 31 years ago for approx
imately $500,000, sold the team
yesterday to a group headed by
Bill Giles, the club's executive
vice president, for a major
league baseball purchase rec
ord price of $30,175 million.
"I have loved baseball, espe
cially the bats and balls, but I
have not particularly enjoyed
what I've seen happening in
this grand old game over the
past five or six years," said
Carpenter.
"That's primarily the reason
I'm selling," added the 41-

year-old, who succeeded his
father, Bob, as president of the
Phillies in 1972.
"I made my statement in
March that the reason the
Carpenters were selling was
because of our philosophical
differences with some of the
other owners as to how this
game should be operated. I still
feel the same way."
Those differences centered
around Carpenter's dislikes of
;he free agent draft and its re
sultant escalating salaries, and
the constant battles with the
Major League Players Associa
tion.

"I am tickled to death that
Bill's group has bought the
Phillies. I'm sure that Bill will
emphasize the importance of
scouting and player develop
ment," said Carpenter, who re
portedly will stay in the or
ganization in that area asan un
paid adviser.
Giles will be the general
partner of the purchasing
group and maintain complete
authority over the operation of
the club. The others are limited
partners, featuring Taft Broad
casting Co. of Cincinnati,
which put up most of the mon
ey.
