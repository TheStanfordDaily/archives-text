## Irving's 'Hotel' relegated to a circus 
### John Irving E.P. Dutton $15.50, 401pp 
Ipie Hotel New Harrip
whire

I cannot deny that The Hotel
s/ew Hampshire reads much
ike its renowned predecessor,
r he World According to Carp,
n one or two engrossing ses
ions. While this is not the nov
;|'s only or greatest merit
though Carp cultists may find
t sufficient) Irving seems to
lave nearly exhausted his rep
ertoire of bizarre themes and
jnlikely characters over the
duration of 400 pages.
Irving's heroes are members
of the unlikely Berry family,
jheaded by Win, an idealist
Harvard graduate with an ob
session for establishing hotels
and living with bears. John
Berry, the middle son among
five children, leads us from the
first "real" Hotel New Hamp
shire, in Dairy, New Hamp
shire, to a second in Vienna
and tothe final Hotel in Maine.
The latter two 'Hotels' actually

function as a house of prosti
tution and a rape-crisis center
respectively.
Lest the potential reader be
come somewhat confused, no
mention will yet be made of
bears (genuine bearsand of the
human lesbian type), barbells,
stuffed and seeing-eye dogs,

Survival, not complete or without
sacrifice but the unknown source of
energy which enables us to face
successive days, is Irving's best theme. It
is one he might have further explored in

midgets or attempts to bomb
the Viennese Opera - all of
which are incorporated by Irv
ing into the novel.
The nararator tells us in the
first chapter that it is up to him,
as the least opinionated, to "set
the record straight." I do not
envy him this responsibility. I
am not sure even after finishing
the novel that he was able to
coherently organize Irving's
tale. The author is a master at
weaving together a tightlv knit

pattern of diverse events; yet
Hotel New Hampshire tries to
introduce a few too many
strange happenings. The Berrys
are not the typical American
family. How many families, for
example, include a barbell-lift
ing, slightly moronic grand
father, one daughter who re-

fuses to grow, and a homosex
ual son who turns out to be a
center of stability for the fami
ly? Their odyssey cannot easily
be "set straight" and one re
grets the fact that several in
telligent ideas are never quite
able to emerge feom Irving's
confusion.
In his treatemnt of the prob
lem of rape and its potential for
debilitating its victims, Irving is
most comfortableand convinc

ing. Franny Berry's rape on Hal
loween night in 1956 haunts
the entire novel. Its effects on
her later sexual relationships
and family interactions confirm
her brother's statement that it
is "the most brutalizing ex
perience that can be survived."
Irving's focus of attention in
The Hotel New Hampshire
does center on sexuality and
particularly its more diverse
forms, another characteristic
reminiscent of Carp.
Irving makes other
philosophical hypotheses
about the pathology of middle
class America. The successive
'Hotels' that the Berrys strive to
establish are symbolic of a
search for a real home and a
"normal" family. Irving com
pares the American family to
the Viennese Opera; they are
both national institutions
which are worshipped to dis
gusting extremes.
Through all their ex
periences Irving and his char
acters remain quasi-optimists.
Survival, not complete or
without sacrifice but the
source of energy which

enables us to face successive
days, is Irving's best theme. It is
one he might have further ex
plored in The Hotel New
Hampshire.
Win Berry says that "Human
beings are remarkable — at
what we can learn to live with."
This is what makes the uncon
ventional Berry family strong
and what can motivate all of us
to adapt, to grow and to accept.
I have left the significance of
bears in Irving's most recent
work to the final analysis. Irv
ing's long obsession with bears
in his writing attempts to do
more than make us laugh at
their pantomimes in the hu
man world. He comes to the
conclusion that everyone
needs a "good smart bear" to
balance his dreams. Our bear
can be an intelligent mind, a
close friend, or even the power
of our own illusions.
I have to admit that despite
shades of wisdom in The Hotel
New Hampshire, the only true
bears which surface from Irv
ing's latest comedy are strictly
of the circus variety.

ing. Franny Berry's rape on Hal
loween night in 1956 haunts
the entire novel. Its effects on
her later sexual relationships
and family interactions confirm
her brother's statement that it
is "the most brutalizing ex
perience that can be survived."
Irving's focus of attention in
The Hotel New Hampshire
does center on sexuality and
particularly its more diverse
forms, another characteristic
reminiscent of Carp.
Irving makes other
philosophical hypotheses
about the pathology of middle
class America. The successive
'Hotels' that the Berrys strive to
establish are symbolic of a
search for a real home and a
"normal" family. Irving com
pares the American family to
the Viennese Opera; they are
both national institutions
which are worshipped to dis
gusting extremes.
Through all their ex
periences Irving and his char
acters remain quasi-optimists.
Survival, not complete or
without sacrifice but the
source of energy which

enables us to face successive
days, is Irving's best theme. It is
one he might have further ex
plored in The Hotel New
Hampshire.
Win Berry says that "Human
beings are remarkable — at
what we can learn to live with."
This is what makes the uncon
ventional Berry family strong
and what can motivate all of us
to adapt, to grow and to accept.
I have left the significance of
bears in Irving's most recent
work to the final analysis. Irv
ing's long obsession with bears
in his writing attempts to do
more than make us laugh at
their pantomimes in the hu
man world. He comes to the
conclusion that everyone
needs a "good smart bear" to
balance his dreams. Our bear
can be an intelligent mind, a
close friend, or even the power
of our own illusions.
I have to admit that despite
shades of wisdom in The Hotel
New Hampshire, the only true
bears which surface from Irv
ing's latest comedy are strictly
of the circus variety.

John Irving was horn in New Hampshire in 1942. He is
the author of Sotting Free the Bears, The Water-Meth
od iVlan, The 158-Pound Marriage, and the recent best
seller, The World According to Carp.
Ipie Hotel New Harrip
whire

I cannot deny that The Hotel
s/ew Hampshire reads much
ike its renowned predecessor,
r he World According to Carp,
n one or two engrossing ses
ions. While this is not the nov
;|'s only or greatest merit
though Carp cultists may find
t sufficient) Irving seems to
lave nearly exhausted his rep
ertoire of bizarre themes and
jnlikely characters over the
duration of 400 pages.
Irving's heroes are members
of the unlikely Berry family,
jheaded by Win, an idealist
Harvard graduate with an ob
session for establishing hotels
and living with bears. John
Berry, the middle son among
five children, leads us from the
first "real" Hotel New Hamp
shire, in Dairy, New Hamp
shire, to a second in Vienna
and tothe final Hotel in Maine.
The latter two 'Hotels' actually

function as a house of prosti
tution and a rape-crisis center
respectively.
Lest the potential reader be
come somewhat confused, no
mention will yet be made of
bears (genuine bearsand of the
human lesbian type), barbells,
stuffed and seeing-eye dogs,

Survival, not complete or without
sacrifice but the unknown source of
energy which enables us to face
successive days, is Irving's best theme. It
is one he might have further explored in

midgets or attempts to bomb
the Viennese Opera - all of
which are incorporated by Irv
ing into the novel.
The nararator tells us in the
first chapter that it is up to him,
as the least opinionated, to "set
the record straight." I do not
envy him this responsibility. I
am not sure even after finishing
the novel that he was able to
coherently organize Irving's
tale. The author is a master at
weaving together a tightlv knit

pattern of diverse events; yet
Hotel New Hampshire tries to
introduce a few too many
strange happenings. The Berrys
are not the typical American
family. How many families, for
example, include a barbell-lift
ing, slightly moronic grand
father, one daughter who re-

fuses to grow, and a homosex
ual son who turns out to be a
center of stability for the fami
ly? Their odyssey cannot easily
be "set straight" and one re
grets the fact that several in
telligent ideas are never quite
able to emerge feom Irving's
confusion.

lem of rape and its potential for
debilitating its victims, Irving is
