# Students vote to accept Cardinal

### Adam Goodman 
The Stanford Cardinal, garnering
970 votes in the mascot referendum,
will be the ASSU's recommendation
to the University's mascot commit
tee, according to Mariann
Byerwalter, Council of Presidents
(COP) representative to the commit
tee.
The second choice of voters was
the tree, with 826 votes, and third
choice was the gryphon, with 655
votes. The leading write-in was the
robber baron with 310 votes. Next
was the Indian with 82 votes.
"The results show that, though
there may not be an overwhelming
mandate in support of a particular
mascot, at least (the vote is) not
fragmented," Byerwalter said. "It
shows there is some solid consensus
behind Cardinal."
In the election, 1763 of 3481 voters
said that they would be satisfied with
Cardinal as mascot if there was no
clear consensus.
Byerwalter said that the commit
tee, appointed by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and headed

by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, will meet late next week to de
cide on a mascot to recommmend to
Kennedy.
"We'll take care of this as quickly
and neatly as possible," Byerwalter
said. She also said action would be
taken soon, possibly before the first
football game following the meeting.
She noted that Kennedy must make
the final decision on the issue.
Byerwalter said she believed that it
would take time for people to get
used to the color Cardinal (as op
posed to the bird) as a mascot. "It's
hard to rally around something that is
not tangible."
Mark Epstein, sponsor of the
mascot referendum, said that he was
relieved that the vote was over. "I
was really pleased to see students so
solidly behind Cardinal as indicated
by its victory on both questions," he
said. "With any luck this issue will be
closed."
The search for a mascot began in
1972 when then - President Richard
Lyman officially abolished the Indian
as the University's mascot after
Native American students com
plained.
A mascot committee chose "Thun
derchicken" as the new mascot, but
the choice was quickly renounced.
Lyman instated Cardinal, Stanford's
color, as the University symbol.
Various referendums have sur
faced over the years and each has had
a different winner. Groups have
pushed for their own favorites â€” the
band has supported the tree, athletes
have sought the gryphon and alumni
have foughtto bring back Indians.
Some interesting mascot choices
of this election were the medflies,
the red Kennedies, rhino of Vegas
showgirl, tentacle man, the shopping
centers, no mascots, and the lem
mings.
