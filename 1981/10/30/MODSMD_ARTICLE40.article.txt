I just as surely as October is associated with cooler
shorter days, falling leaves and pumpkins, it is also the
time of year when author Stephen King revels in the
glory of having another book hit the top of the bestseller
lists. Previous Octobers have seen the likes of Salem's
Lot, The Dead Zone, The Shining and Firestarter bobbing
around the number 1 position with no signs of ever com
ing down. Add to the list Cujo; King's latest knee
knocker, heart-thumper, and, dare one say, spine
tingler.
Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon once said,
"Ninety percent of everything is crud." The booming
horror-supernatural genre is a prime example of the
j truth of this law. In this case, to be completely accurate,
' the figure should be closer to 99 percent. A cursory
I glance at a drugstore, grocery store, gas station or even
bookstore shelf reveals row upon row of the latest
chillers, each immaculate in a flashy cover featuring a
veritable orgy of full moons, blood-stained teeth, knives,
claws and evil, demonic eyes. These and other nasty sym
bols are all painted to the most demanding standards of
accuracy. Unfortunately, surface appearances do noth
ing to set apart the novels of Stephen King, horror liter
ature's sterling 1 percent, from the other 99 percent.
Once past the ornate cover paintings, however, all
similarities between King and other horror writers van
ish. King is a superb storyteller for whom sending shivers
down the human spinal column is child's play. At his
peak, King succeeds in turning the average spine into a
quivering mass of flavorless Jello.
In order that a story be scary, there must be a conflict
between what is considered to be the real world and
some para-normal aberration that can take the form of
an evil spirit, the Devil, incurable plague, vampires or
what-have-you. In the handsof a poortoaverageauthor,
the standard horror story degenerates into a vivid ac
count of the eating habits of the story's evil element as it
meticulously decapitates, impales, stabs or otherwise
kills off the cast of stereotypical characters. Nothing
frightening there, and the reader flips pages simply out
of a morbid curiosity to find out who gets it next and
how.
Such is not the case with Stephen King. His secret to
success lies in his ability to create and describe a very be
lievable story setting, be it a small town in Maine, a Ne
braska cornfield, or New York City itself, and then peo

ple it with similarly fully realized characters.
The next step, the addition of the story's evil compo
nent, is where the majority of authors fall short but
where King shines. Most writers tend to introduce their
horrific element with bombastic fanfare. An entire state
is swallowed by a monster, 13,000 people die in an atomic
bomb blast, the Devil possesses an entire kindergarten,
and so on. Wow. How scary, until the initial shock wears
off five pages later.
King, on the other hand, allows his stories' nasty ele
ment to seep in slowly, like a cut on a finger gradually
turning gangrenous. The result is slowly building, para
noid terror which, at the climatic moment, lets loose like
the inner-wound core of a golf ball removed from its
tough outer covering. The reader feels himself fraying at
the edges — paper cuts and calls to dinner are ignored,

and those "few minutes of reading" stretch into all
nighters.
As has been mentioned, Cujo is definitely capable of
causing its share of shattered nerves, cold sweats and
Jello spines. Cujo, a 200-pound-plus St. Bernard, is ev
eryone's favorite huggable, loving, living toy. While gen
erally given to lying in the sun in pursuit of a perfect state
of enthalpy, Cujo is not above giving a rabbit a run for its
money now and then.
It is during one of these infrequent rabbit chases that
Cujo gets stuck, head first, in a hole that turns out to be
the opening to a small cave. Excited by Cujo's boisterous

efforts to extricate himself, the resident bats nip him
once or twice on the nose, and once he does free
himself, Cujo soon forgets the whole episode in the
hole, and his master never notices the bat bites.
Naturally Cujo is not innoculated against rabies, the
very thing the bats had an abundance of. Rabies, which
attacks the central nervous system, induces disorienta
tion and violent insanity in its latter stages, and Cujo, an
extremely large and powerful dog, is pre-rabid. To give
away any more of the plot would be unfair, and in
terested persons should read the book.
While Cujo is an above-average, effective horror story,
it is still a major disappointment, as one expects more
from Stephen King. Upon comparison with King's mas
terful Salem's Lot, The Shining, or The Stand, it is evident
where the problem with Cujo lies. In the preceeding
novels, evil was embodied in totally implausible forms
that were made all too believable by King's storytelling
abilities, thus enhancing and heightening the readers'
fear.
But what is Cujo? He is simply a very sick dog. Everyone
has heard of rabid dogs before, and while they are not
part of most peoples' day-to-day lives, they don't carry
the same type of unknown, frightening qualities that
King's vampires, or evil spirits do. No oaken stakes, silver

bullets, garlic or crosses would be needed to kill Cujo,
and the story suffers for it. Cujo is not a had book, it is just
that King's other books are so much better.
Stephen King is not, and never will be, another Stein
beck or Hemingway. One reads King because he is a very

Cujo is definitely capable of causing
its share of shattered nerves, cold
sweats, andlello spines. While Cujo
is an above-average effective horror
story, it is still a major
disappointment, as one expects
more from Stephen King. While
Cujo is not a bad book, it is just that
King's other bonks are so much
better.

entertaining, fun writer and nothing more. He has only
one purpose in mind when he writes and he fulfills it
magnificently. He scares you
