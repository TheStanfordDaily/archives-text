jtormy Weather ★★★★
*Jcw Varsity, Palo Alto
In the '40s, Hollywood put out
i string of black "entertainer"
ilms, which managed to avoid
,ome of the more offensive stere
otyping of black actors by placing
:hem in an insular movie world
/vhere no whites were present.
Sturmy Weather, with Cabin in
he Sky (with which it's double
billed at he New Varsity is the best
of these showcase musicals be
cause of the talent of its per
formers. The cast includes Bill
"Bojangles" Robinson, Lena
Home, Fats Waller (who sings his
"Ain't Misbehavin" with Ada
Brown), Cab Calloway, and the
Nicholas brothers. The highlights
in a movie that has virtually no
low spots include Home singing
"Stormy Weather" (even if
you've Heard it a hundred times
before, hers is the version you'll
remember), and the numbers of
the Nicholas brothers, who carry
their blend of dance and
acrobatics to exhilarating
heights.
Andrew Stone directed. Plays
Monday only.

Tonight, Kresgt*
Jane Fonda won an Oscar for
her portrayal of the intelligent,
cynical prostitute Bree Daniels.
Her performance (her first real
one after having spent a decade
mijred in sex-kitten/girl-next
door parts) is wonderful: by turns
brittle and tender, lightning
quick and langurous. Donald
Sutherland is her co-star, and the
director, Alan Pakula, has made
the most of his self-possessed
softness. Sutherland's best mo
ments come when he's listening,
or observing something passive
ly; we can see what he's thinking,
and it his help shape the flow of
the narrative. The story, a tale of
pre-Watergate corruption, is
consistently fascinating and
sometimes terrifying.

Lounge
Some of the imagiify in Ingmar
Bergman's celebrated film stays
with one for years/"**'even the
pirated sequences {the night
mare at the beginning is out of
Vampyr and Dead -of Night) —
and so does the performance of
Victor Sjostrom (the first great
Swedish directed
Lillian Gish in The Scarlet Letter
and The Wind. The rest of the
movie is rather stitfand self con
scious, despite the cast (Gunnar

Superman II **
Mountain View Theater
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the ori
ginal; it will usually delight those
who found the original's smart
alecky second half more appeal
ing. Richard Lester (A Hard Day's
Night, The Three Musketeers)
directed, and he's lent the movie
a comic-book punch that moves
it along as speedily as a morning
spent with the funnies. Christ
opher Reeve repeats his role as
the man of steel; Margot Kidder
is,, once again, a sassy, sexy Lois
Lane.
Double billed with Wcfory.

The General ****
Monday, Kresge
Buster Keaton's silent films are
masterpieces of comic timing.
The General is a clockwork par
able of the civil war. Keaton, a
railroad engineer, saves his hon
or through a stunningly or
chestrated series of calamities.
Keaton's world balances be
tween the happy accident and to
tal disaster—and it's not unusual
for the two to turn out to be the
same thing.
Keaton's gift is for making the
fantastic seem ordinary. By com
parison, the ordinary seems
hilariously out of place.

Priest of Love **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
In striving to avoid the traps of
biographical movies, this film
about D.H. Lawrence and his
wife, Frieda Van Richthofen,
bungles the material in surprising
ways: it is a bewilderingly struc
tured set of flashbacks that inter
rupt an endless travelogue. The
Lawrences take in New Mexico,
old Mexico, France and Italy, but
we keep losing track of where
they are and who they're talking
to. Lan McKellen, ideally cast as
Lawrence, has some strong mo
ments, but it's just a sketch; Janet
Suzman, as! Frieda, comes off
much better.

The Four Seasons *
Menlo, Menlo Park
A tiresome movie about seven
tiresome people who become
more tiresome as the movie
progresses. Alan Alda wrote and
directed this gimmicky com
edy/drama about middle-aged
angst; his performance is nice,
but the movie just doesn't hold
together. The "revelations" he
gives us about his characters
played, for the most part nicely,
by a cast that includes Carol
Burnett, Rita Moreno, and Sandy
Dennis — seem tired. You'd seem
tired too ii you'd been around as
long as some of the bargain-base
ment insights Alda offer*.

Arthur ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, ptays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and )ohn Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.
— J.M.

Star Trek *
Fox, Redwood Cilv
Empty, apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed — Paramount Pictures. De- >1
spite the seeming grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew
members saves the universe by
gleefully agreeing to some cos
mic sex — is unintentionally
hilarious. Shatner, Nimoy and the
rest were better on TV; on the
large screen they're almost un
believably wooden.
Plays Saturday with War o/the
Worlds.
— Ron Lillejord.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman *★*
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a vic»
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bff chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction desigri/ Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Frands. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

The Magic Flute **#*
Fox, Redwood Cilv
Ingmar Bergman, in a sum
mertime mood, directed this
brilliant film versiort/ t .t>£ the
Mozart opera. His Magic Flute is
unabashedly stagey — we see the
curtain go up at the beginning
and down at the end, and the ac
tion takes place arnid cardboard
scenery — but this movie conveys
all of the fantasy the titlesuggests.
This film could be USea as a
model for intelligently trans
ferring stage works to the screen.
Mozart seems to have been in
a summertime mood, too, and I'd
hazard a guess that some of the
film's success is his doinjj£;N& mu
sic is sung in Swedish, with sub
titles added for those who don't
speak it.
Plays Sunday and Mori&ty with
From Mao to Mozart. '~;0

Gallipoli
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

For Your Eyes Only **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie— which doesn't
mean, of cwpK that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tifed of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the plan to re
place him with a younger model
soon). He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — for a
terrific, clfcHe-reversing car
chase where Bond is forced to ex
change his Lotus for a Citroen. If
the moviemajtefs had been as
playful with the Bond formula
through the rest of the film, For
Your Eyes sfijpy might have
passed for entertainment instead
of an exercisjje in cinematic stasis.
Tonight and tomorrow with
John Houston's victory.

True Confessions ***
Mill, Mounlainview
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots In the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessjy
plotted, the wrap-up js disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (acop and
a priest,) is neveT moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
allthe performances — especially
those pf Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durmns;
are so good th.it the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.

Rich and Famous ***
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
ready like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars/but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
; niis gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Geralci Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
iffHf — it's a write-by-numbers
Script, with the plot and dialogue
fOUghed in but nevef really
blended. Our disbelief is Sus-
S ended by the director's trust in
is material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
madt' with a little kindness.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts

of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg Oaws) directed,
George Lucas (Sfar Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body SnaHhers) wrote the script.
If has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it R.ilders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Night of the Living Dead *
Saturday, CuhhtfrffV
Living Dead opened to poor
business when it was released in
the late '60s, and it achieved its
present notoriety only after Rex
Reed and Reader's Digest ran
columns whicjj» accused it of
damaging children's minds. I
haven't encountered any Living
Dead-induced psychotics, but
that still doesn't make this a good
movie.
I guess I have trouble with any
film for which the director of spe
cial effects was a butcher. I'm
sure that raw meat, in its place,
has legitimate artistic value, but
even top sirloin couldn't redeem
Living Dead's fatal confusion be
tween explicitnessand terror.

Southern Comfort ★★★*
Old Mill, Mountain View
A National Guard unit has
been sent into the Louisiana
swamps on war games; they steal
some canoes, shoot a volley of
blanks at a couple of Cajuns as a
joke, and real violence erupts.
Walter Hill's exciting movie
about the causes and conse
quences of violence has a
broader focus thanone mightex
pect, and a consistently am
bivalent point of view of the Ca
juns who entrap the guardsmen;
it's a movie that expands in ret
rospect. Keith Carradine, T.K.
Carter, Lewis Smith and Les Lan
nom contribute interesting per
formances.
