Strikes shake Poland as Pact meets
Poland — Poland's strike wave spread to a major
port and the universities yesterday, swelling the ranks
of protesters to about 400,000 across the nation.
Meanwhile, the military council of the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact began meeting in Hungary.
Solidarity union officials said 40,000 construction
workers struck 68 factories for two hours in the Baltic
port of Szczecin, on the East German border, and
threatened a wider strike to get more building sup
plies.
In Budapest, the Warsaw Pact's military council
opened a "regular session" attended by defense min
isters or their assistants from the seven Eastern bloc
member nations, the Hungarian news agency said
It was not known if Poland's premier, party chief
and defense minister, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, was
attending or what was on the agenda, but it was pre
sumed Poland's unrest would be a major topic.
Students and professors at Radom's higher engi
neering school occupied classrooms demanding dis
missal of the rector. They got support from students at
Warsaw University who staged a four-hour protest.
They also received pledges of support from other col
leges and universities across Poland.
Protests also erupted in Skarzysko Kamienna, after
the local Solidarity office was smashed up. Workers
there declared they were ready to strike, claiming the
incident was an attack on the union.
Although some progress was reported in settling
long-standing strikes in Zyrardow, 20 miles west of
Warsaw, and far-western Zielona Gora, the govern
ment was adamant in refusing to grant strike pay, stall
ing anv kind of immediate settlement.
Some 12,000 workers remained off the job in
Zyrardow, 150,000 in Zielona Gora, and 120,000 in
southern Tarnobrzeg. Transport workers joined the
Zyrardow protest, while power station and construc
tion workers joined the striking workers in
Tarnobrzeg.
Poland's Parliament was to meet today and discuss a
resolution calling for a ban on strikes. But a leading
legislator who requested anonymity said the outcome
of the session was still unclear.
AWACS sale vote worries Israelis
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin said
yesterday that Israel faces new and serious danger as a
result of U.S. Senate approval of the $8.5 billion arms
sale to Saudi Arabia and pledged that the Israeli gov
ernment will take steps to "overcome" the threat
posed by the sale.
Begin did not spell out in the official Cabinet
statement what Israel will do to counteract what it
sees as the new threat but he pointedly noted that
President Runald Reagan had reassured him that the
United States will help Israel retain its "military and
technological advantages."

Cabinet sources said some ministers at yesterday's
session complained that the statement, drafted by Be
gin, was not strong enough.
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, who did not attend
the Cabinet meeting, later issued a toughly worded
statement saying the Senate action is "unusually seri
ous" and will reduce Israel's strategic advantage over
the Saudis and other Arab countries as well.
Sharon said it is "well known" that Saudi Arabia
transfers arms purchases to other countries and he re
peated his charge that Saudi-bound arms from the
United States are being transferred to Iraq.
Begin's oblique reference to counteracting the sale
to Saudi Arabia of sophisticated radar surveillance air
craft and range-extending equipment for F-15 war
planes suggested the likelihood of new Israeli re
quests for U.S. military assistance.
Following an emergency meeting of his Cabinet,
Begin said the Israeli government "expresses its re
gret" over the Senate vote allowing Reagan to sell the
planes and arms to Saudi Arabia which. Begin said, "is
in a state of war with Israel, rejects the Camp David
accords and finances terror in the region."
OPEC agrees on oil price range
Geneva — The Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries fixed its prices in a range of $34 to $38 a
barrel yesterday, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa Al-
Sabah said. Analysts said this could cost Americans
about two to four cents more a gallon for gasoline and
heating oil.
But Al-Sabah said OPEC also froze prices at the new
levels through the end of 1982. The oil cartel min
isters, in a rare one-day session, thus established a uni
fied price structure for the first time in more than two
years.
There was no immediate announcement from the
OPEC secretariat or Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest pro
ducer and America's biggest supplier of imported oil.
Prices among OPEC's 13 members had varied from
Saudi Arabia's low of $32 for a42-gallon barrel to near
ly $40 charged by Algeria. The oil ministers discussed
the $34 price proposed by Saudi Arabia during meet
ings in May and August, but Venezuela and others re
fused to agree. So Saudi Arabia had kept its price at
$32.
Although OPEC set a base price of $36 a barrel in
December 1980, prices charged by individual mem
bers have varied ever since according to the market
and other considerations. The average price is now
about $35.
Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamai has
been seeking to unify OPEC prices since February
1979, when some members began raising prices on
their own.
Prospects for an agreement were good because a
glut on theworld market hasforced most OPEC mem
bers to cut prices or production.

President to control oil allocation
Washington — The Senate yester~ u y votpd over
whelmingly to give the president powers he says he
doesn't want — to allocate oil supplies and impose
price controls in the event of another embargo.
The Senate voted 85-7 in favor of the bill, which
would replace emergency powers that expired Sept.
30. The bill now goes to the House.
The bill pre-empts state allocation formulas, but
does allow the states limited authority to impose con
servation programs, such as odd-even gasoline sale
schemes or car pooling requirements.
The bill specifically forbids rationing of gasoline
and diesel fuel supplies for consumers. Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) attempted to insert gas rationing
authority, but was defeated 73-22.
President Ronald Reagan has consistently opposed
the legislation, arguing that thefree market — includ
ing higher prices — can best allocate scarce supplies
in times of emergencies.
But senators, led by the committee's chairman, Sen.
James McClure (R-ldaho) disagreed. They said stand
by emergency powers should at least be available to
the president in case the free market fails.
Economy expected to sink deeper
Washington — An "especially steep plunge" in a
key government index foretells a national economy
already in a mild recession sinking even deeper in the
next few months, a top Commerce Department of
ficial said yesterday.
"The only real question is how far it is going to
drop," said Assistant Secretary Robert Dederick.
But Dederick and other analysts inside and outside
the government say they don't foresee a downturn as
sharp as last year's recession.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that the
government's Index of Leading Indicators fell 2.7 per
cent in September, the biggest drop since April 1980.
Since April 1981, the index has fallen 5.5 percent.
Dederick said the new decline "an especially steep
plunge" in the index, which is designed to forecast
future trends of the economy.
"The report strongly suggests that industrial pro
duction will be sliding into the autumn and that real
gross national product will be down for the third suc
cessive quarter. Any upturn is unlikely before early
1982.
"The iffy question," he said, "is whether it is going
to turn around in the first quarter or the second" of
next year.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that
over-all business productivity fell at an annual rate of
1.9 percent in the third quarter, the biggest decline
since the first quarter of 1978.
And, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker
told senators on Capitol Hill that it is "quite possible"

the economy was in a recession. But he declined to
make any flat declaration, saying a recession is "some
thing you pronounce after the event when you can
see what's happening."
A poor fourth quarter this year would enhance the
administration's ability to achieve a projected growth
of 5.2 percent in 1982 as measured from fourth quar
ter to fourth quarter.
But Dederick agreed with his boss, Commerce Sec
retary Malcolm Baldrige, that the Reagan adminis
tration's forecasts of a 3.4 percent average growth
throughout 1982 may be too optimistic.
Daylight savings period extended
Washington — The House of Representatives on
Wednesday voted to extend daylight savings time
from six to eight months a year over objections that
the time change would jeopardize the safety of tens
of thousands of school children.
The 243-165 vote came as supporters said the
change, adding March and April to the daylight sav
ings time months, would save energy because there
would be more daylight during the time people are
awake and need it.
Critics, especially rural congressmen, challenged
more, not less, energy would be used. That, plus the
fear that school children would be forced to go to
school in the dark could force many rural states to
drop daylight savings time altogether, they argued.
Under the plan, daylight savings time would be in
itiated on the first weekend in March rather than the
last weekend in April. At that time clocks would be
moved ahead one hour, meaning more daylight in
the evening and less in the morning. Clocks would be
turned back an hour on the last weekend of October,
the same time they are adjusted under the current
law.
Stocks fall to more recession signs
New York — A new recession signal dealt the stock
market a moderate setback in a quiet session yester
day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
4.66 to 832.95.
As the market opened, the government reported a
2.7 percent drop in the index of leading economic in
dicators for September. That showing by the index,
which is designed to function as a kind of economic
crystal ball, was widely interpreted as a signal that the
recession was deepening.
