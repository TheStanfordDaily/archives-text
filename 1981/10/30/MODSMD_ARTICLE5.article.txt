# Trudeau designs poster for handgun control campaign
## Bookstore bans Doonesbury gun control poster 
### Katherine Brown 
The Stanford Bookstore has refused to
buy a poster drawn by Doonesbury artist
Gary Trudeau promoting gun control, ac
cording to bookstore buyer Susan Kee.
She said carrying the poster, which shows
the Doonesbury comic strip character
Duke, a former journalist and sometime
ambassador, aiming a handgun enclosed by
the international interdiction symbol,
would be "politically inappropriate."
The National Coalition to Ban Handguns
(NCBH) has stepped up its campaign in the
wake of recent assassination attempts. This

particular poster, designed by Trudeau for
the NCBH, is selling in college bookstores
all over the country. The University book
store, however, is not the only one that re
fused to carry it. According to the NCBH,
UC-Santa Cruz, UC-Davis, Cornell Univer
sity and Oberlin College were among those
refusing to carry the poster.
Bookstore Manager Eldon Speed said the
buying policy here is two-fold. "The item
must have the potential to sell and be in
good taste," he said.
Sam Fields, legal adviser for the NCBH,

said he interpreted the "good taste"
criterion as a smokescreen for censorship.
"No other bookstore even remotely sug
gested that political content is reason
enough to censor it," said Fields.
Speed said, "Most posters with political
content don't sell well. They only benefit
the proponents of one side of an issue. I'm
sure Ms. Kee was acting in accordance with
our tests of good taste and profitability
when she made the decision."
Kee emphasized that the bookstore is not
in the business of endorsing political issues

and carries no political posters. The book
store does carry other Trudeau cartoon an
thologies which sell faster than the book
store can stock them, as well as other items
of significant political content, however.
The question of endorsement is a grey
area. Speed said the "good taste" criterion
is tested on a case by case basis.
In this particular case, the poster overtly
takes a stand on gun control. Some news
papers have started printing the
Doonesbury comic strip on the editorial
page in deference to politically sensitive
readers.
