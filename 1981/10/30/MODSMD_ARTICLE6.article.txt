# Chinese fear 'Polish-style' labor trouble
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Peking — The "Polish lesson" has
made a deep impression on China's
leadership, but the ruling Communist
Party is still trying to find the right solu
tion for potentially explosive labor un
rest.
In scattered but recurrent
slowdowns, demonstrations and
strikes, industrial workers are protest
ing low pay, poor working conditions
and recent layoffs. Dissident journals
report continuing efforts to form inde
pendent trade unions to voice these
and other worker complaints.
The Communist Party, which main
tains a monopoly on real political
power in China, has conceded the need
to give workers a greater voice in run
ning the country's industries, but it has
sought over the past year to balance
that with the needs of a centrally run
economy. So far, the party has been un
able to resolve the resulting contradic
tion.
Worker control dropped
Plans to put Chinese workers directly
in charge of their enterprises — de
termining production levels, allocating
profits and hiring and firing managers
— were quietly dropped, and workers'
congresses, which were to have had
these broad powers at each plant, be
came little more than advisory bodies.
Only 30 percent of China's 400,000 in
dustrial enterprises, generally the larg
est, actually established workers' con
gresses, leaving "nearly two-thirds of
our workers disenfranchised...," a
union report said.
The trade unions, now under party
instructions to represent the workers
mote effectively, complain that they are
frequently frustrated by government
officials who side with enterprise man
agers. "The production-at-any-cost

mentality still blinds many leading
cadres to the real dangers in worker re
sentment," a trade union leader told a
Peking conference on the problem.
Growing unrest
The result is a continuing level of un
rest just beneath the surface in many
Chinese industries concerning com
plaints, including inflation-eroded pay,
changes in the bonus system, unsafe
working conditions and a lack of hous
ing and other facilities that enterprises
here usually provide.
"No one expects a worker revolt like
that in Poland. But workers in many en
terprises, whole industries in fact, have
serious complaints they want heard and
resolved," said a Chinese journalist
who covers labor.
Chinese officials appear to have dealt
successfully with most of the past year's
protests through conciliation. These in
volved coal miners, tool-and-die
makers and chemical-industry workers
who have demanded unions independ
ent of the party and government.
Actions included a two-day strike at
the large Anshan steel works in north
east China over a variety of grievances,
a two-day strike at a Shanghai glass
works, and half-a-dozen other re
ported protests over layoffs when old
plants were shut down.
Strike against favors
The latest reported strike was by
workers of an electrical transformer
plant in the southwestern Chinese city
of Kunming to protest the plant man
agement's allocation of new apart
ments to the director, party secretary,
trade union leader and their friends, in
stead of the workers for whom they
were built.
Workers' complaints will probably
increase in the next few years, Chinese
officials believe, as the country's "eco

nomic readjustment" leads to further
plant closings, with as many as 10 mil
lion workers a year, nearly a tenth of the
urban labor force, assigned to new jobs.
Workers' congresses, which are quar
terly assemblies of the elected repre
sentatives of an enterprise's employees,
were established to deal with such
problems. The idea was that the con
gresses at first would simply ease dis
content and try to settle worker griev
ances.
Later, they were to have involved
workers in management and eventually
to have taken over actual direction of
the enterprise under a planned eco
nomic decentralization.
Central control
But the decentralization, involving
broad self-management rights for en
terprises and reliance on market forces
rather than central direction and plan
ning, was shelved late last year when it
seemed to be creating more problems
than it was solving.
The party leadership's search for a
compromise concerning workers' con
gresses led to a top-level review during
the summer and the issuance of new
regulations governing the congresses.
These regulations, which have the force
of law, require all enterprises to estab
lish workers' congresses, but with the
stipulation that they be put "under the
leadership of party committees" with
all disputes between management and
labor to be submitted to "superior or
gans" for resolution.
The Coal Ministry, meanwhile, has
taken a different approach to put its of
ficials back in touch with increasingly
disgruntled miners. Every official from
minister down to local mine managers
and party secretaries under the age of
50 has been ordered into the pits to
work for up to five weeks a year.
