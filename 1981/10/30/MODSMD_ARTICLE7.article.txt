# Iranian guerilla predicts Khomeini end

Auvers-sur-Oise, France
(AP) — As Iran's Moslem fun
damentalist regime executes
hundreds of his followers, a
softspoken 34-year-old guer
rilla leader plots its overthrow
from exile in France.
"A week, month — it doesn't
matter how long it takes," Mu
jahedeen Khalq leader
Massoud Rajavi told The As
sociated Piess in thb Paris sub
urb. "Khomeini is finished and
we are the only ones with an al
ternative."
Imprisoned, tortured and
sentenced to death by the late
Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, driven underground

and forced to flee Iran by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Rajavi now sits in a closely
guarded compound along with
another casualty of the Islamic
revolution — former Iranian
President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr.
Communism and Islam
The Mujahedeen Khalq,
whose name means "people's
crusaders," reportedly has
about 10,000 members. They
believe Communist politics
and Islam are compatible — a
combination abhorrent to
Khomeini.
Bani-Sadr opposed the out

lawed Mujahedeen before his
ouster June 22 as Iran's only
secular president since the
1979 revolution.
Now, the two men who fled
to France last July in a stolen
Iranian air force plane have
formed an official aliiance and
outlined a provisional govern
ment they think should replace
the Moslem clergy ruling Iran.
Persecution in Iran
Khomeini's regime estimates
Mujahedeen guerrillas have
killed about 1000 government
and religious officials in Iran
since Bani-Sadr's ouster.
Iran's official media has re
ported more than 1400 execu

tions during the same period,
and said most of the victims
were Mujahedeen.
"People think Khomeini has
this great religious charisma,
this hold over the people. That
is false," Rajavi said. "He rules
through fear — by the club, by
the bullet, by torture. If he had
the support of the people he
would not need all these ex
ecutions. The social-political
isolation of this regime is even
more than in the days of the
Shah."
"Khomeini is finished. Sev
enty percent of his own leaders
have been killed. He is the last
card, and he will fall soon."
