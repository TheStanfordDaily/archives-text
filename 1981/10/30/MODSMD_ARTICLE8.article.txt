## Italian government endures troubled economy, coalition 
### Los Angeles Times 
Rome — Italy's three-month-old government
appears to have survived its first crisis, a struggle
over the ailing economy, but it is paying a stag
gering price in terms of a record public-sector
deficit and continuing inflation.
For Americans, it is a demonstration of the in
effectiveness of coalition governments in con
trast to the two-party system. President Ronald
Reagan's budget problems are nothing com
pared to those of Prime Minister Giovanni
Spadolini.
Austerity and belt-tightening are the words
being used by political leaders and some press
commentators to describe the latest economic
package put together by the government.
"I really don't see any austerity in the pack
age," one non-Italian expert commented. He is
not alone among Western critics who think the
government stopped far short of the cuts
needed to control inflation, which is still run
ning at twice the average of other industrialized
nations.
Large deficit in budget
Spadolini came close to losing his respected
minister of the treasury, Benjamino Andreatta, a
scrupulous, professional advocate of fiscal dis
cipline, during the struggle. Andreatta finally
swallowed his pride in the name of "discipline
and loyalty" and went along with a program that
will produce a deficit next year of $43 billion and
perhaps more. That is close to the projected
American deficit and close to 10 percent of the
Italian gross national product.
The deficit for next year is 13 percent above
this year's. There remains the hope that inflation
nevertheless can be brought down from its pres
ent level of about 20 percent to around 16 per
cent.
Most experts here, however, believe that will
be possible only if labor accepts new restraints.
Many of the major three-year national labor
contracts expire at the end of this year or early
next year. The renegotiations will be a tough test
of labor's intentions.
There has been speculation that Spadolini's
five-party coalition would collapse, leaving Italy
to look in frustration for its forty-second postwar
government. Now the best guess is that that dan
ger has passed, for the moment. But the possi
bility of national elections in the spring, two
years before they are due, remains.
Intercoaliton political concerns
The government will survive, most commen
tators argue, because Spadolini is still useful to
the larger parties that support him.

As the first non-Christian Democratic pre
mier, his only assured support comes from his
own Republican Party, which polled only 3 per
cent of the vote in the last election.
The giant of the coalition, the Christian Dem
ocratic Party, seems to have no interest in run
ning Italy at this time. Rather, it appears preoc
cupied with cleaning its own house.
The other major party of the coalition, the So
cialists, seems to be awaiting a more propitious
time for an election, its strategy seemingly dic
tated by the ambitions of the Socialist leader,
Bettino Craxi, to be where Spadolini is.
And the other two members of the coalition,
the small Liberal and Social Democratic parties,
have nowhere else to go.
"Each year looks worse and worse," one ana
lyst said, reviewing Italian efforts to control the
public-sector deficit.
"It is completely out of hand," another ob
server said.
Cuts of $8 billion were made in the draft
budget, half of them in health services, but that
still has left the record deficit.
Andreatta wanted smaller deficit
Treasury minister Andreatta wanted much
deeper cuts. When he hinted about the need for
tax increases to raise an additional $1.9 billion
before the end of the calendar year, there were
howls of dismay from other members of the
coalition. Now the possibility of further budget
cuts or tax increases seems remote.
Parliament is now wrestling with the details of
implementing the economic package adopted
by the cabinet last week and the strains within
the coalition are quite evident.
Much of the talk about inflation still focuses
on the "scala mobile" — escalator — an auto
matic wage indexing law that appears to increase
wages in a way that fuels inflation beyond its
avowed purpose of keeping wages apace with
the rising cost of living.
Even the unions are now having second
thoughts on the scala mobile, although no
agreement has emerged. As one American ex
pert noted, the wage indexing has served over
the years to level wages. The differential be
tween skilled and unskilled wages is now half
what it was a decade ago and that has stirred re
sentment among Italy's most productive work
ers.
The economic package — even if not as tough
as critics feel it should be — will pinch the
poorest Italians, especially those on fixed in
comes and pensions.

appears to have survived its first crisis, a struggle
over the ailing economy, but it is paying a stag
gering price in terms of a record public-sector
deficit and continuing inflation.
For Americans, it is a demonstration of the in
effectiveness of coalition governments in con
trast to the two-party system. President Ronald
Reagan's budget problems are nothing com
pared to those of Prime Minister Giovanni
Spadolini.
Austerity and belt-tightening are the words
being used by political leaders and some press
commentators to describe the latest economic
package put together by the government.
"I really don't see any austerity in the pack
age," one non-Italian expert commented. He is
not alone among Western critics who think the
government stopped far short of the cuts
needed to control inflation, which is still run
ning at twice the average of other industrialized
nations.
Large deficit in budget
Spadolini came close to losing his respected
minister of the treasury, Benjamino Andreatta, a
scrupulous, professional advocate of fiscal dis
cipline, during the struggle. Andreatta finally
swallowed his pride in the name of "discipline
and loyalty" and went along with a program that
will produce a deficit next year of $43 billion and
perhaps more. That is close to the projected
American deficit and close to 10 percent of the
Italian gross national product.
The deficit for next year is 13 percent above
this year's. There remains the hope that inflation
nevertheless can be brought down from its pres
ent level of about 20 percent to around 16 per
cent.
Most experts here, however, believe that will
be possible only if labor accepts new restraints.
Many of the major three-year national labor
contracts expire at the end of this year or early
next year. The renegotiations will be a tough test
of labor's intentions.
There has been speculation that Spadolini's
five-party coalition would collapse, leaving Italy
to look in frustration for its forty-second postwar
government. Now the best guess is that that dan
ger has passed, for the moment. But the possi
bility of national elections in the spring, two
years before they are due, remains.
Intercoaliton political concerns
The government will survive, most commen
tators argue, because Spadolini is still useful to
the larger parties that support him.

As the first non-Christian Democratic pre
mier, his only assured support comes from his
own Republican Party, which polled only 3 per
cent of the vote in the last election.
The giant of the coalition, the Christian Dem
ocratic Party, seems to have no interest in run
ning Italy at this time. Rather, it appears preoc
cupied with cleaning its own house.
The other major party of the coalition, the So
cialists, seems to be awaiting a more propitious
time for an election, its strategy seemingly dic
tated by the ambitions of the Socialist leader,
Bettino Craxi, to be where Spadolini is.
And the other two members of the coalition,
the small Liberal and Social Democratic parties,
have nowhere else to go.
"Each year looks worse and worse," one ana
lyst said, reviewing Italian efforts to control the
public-sector deficit.
"It is completely out of hand," another ob
server said.
Cuts of $8 billion were made in the draft
budget, half of them in health services, but that
still has left the record deficit.
Andreatta wanted smaller deficit
Treasury minister Andreatta wanted much
deeper cuts. When he hinted about the need for
tax increases to raise an additional $1.9 billion
before the end of the calendar year, there were
howls of dismay from other members of the
coalition. Now the possibility of further budget
cuts or tax increases seems remote.
Parliament is now wrestling with the details of
implementing the economic package adopted
by the cabinet last week and the strains within
the coalition are quite evident.
Much of the talk about inflation still focuses
on the "scala mobile" — escalator — an auto
matic wage indexing law that appears to increase
wages in a way that fuels inflation beyond its
avowed purpose of keeping wages apace with
the rising cost of living.
Even the unions are now having second
thoughts on the scala mobile, although no
agreement has emerged. As one American ex
pert noted, the wage indexing has served over
the years to level wages. The differential be
tween skilled and unskilled wages is now half
what it was a decade ago and that has stirred re
sentment among Italy's most productive work
ers.
The economic package — even if not as tough
as critics feel it should be — will pinch the
poorest Italians, especially those on fixed in
comes and pensions.
