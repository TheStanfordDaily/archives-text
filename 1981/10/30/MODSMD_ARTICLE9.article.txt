Stockholm, Sweden (AP) —
Swedish salvage vessels pre
pared yesterday to refloat a
grounded Soviet submarine af
ter helicopters with depth
charges chased away an un
identified submarine and a So
viet tug cruising in the restrict
ed Swedish waters, authorities
said.
They said Moscow had
agreed to let Swedish ships
refloat and dock the diesel
powered submarine that ran
aground in Swedish waters
Tuesday night off the southeast
coast near the Karlskrona naval
base. Sweden has protested the
Soviet submarine's incursion.
Swedish Prime Minister
Thorbjorn Falldin made clear
that the sub would be returned
to the Soviet Union, but said,
"How and when will depend
on the outcome of an in
vestigation we have ordered
conducted by the commander
in chief." He said that any ef
fort by the submarine to escape
would be forcibly stopped.
Ward off Soviets
The Soviet salvage tug was
warded off by Swedish naval
vessels after it briefly violated
Sweden's territorial waters, the
officials said.
Swedish navy spokesman
Bertil Lagerwall said it was one
of 10 Warsaw Pact salvage
vessels, led by two Soviet de
stroyers, deployed near the
territorial limit.
Cmdr. Lennart Forsman,
commander of the Karlskrona
naval base, said salvage opera
tions will not begin until au
thorities have finished inter
rogating the submarine's cap
tain, identified as 35-year-old

Pyotr Gushin, and his esti
mated 56-man crew.
He said they would be ques
tioned by a special naval team
aboard the slightly damaged
submarine.
Soviets blame instruments
Capt. Kar Gunnar Andersson
boarded the vessel Wednesday
night and was later quoted by
the newspaper Svenska
Dagbladet that the Soviet cap
tain claimed the submarine ran
aground because of "naviga
tional error due to a faulty gyro

compass and bad weather."
A spokesman for the Swe
dish naval staff, Jan-Ake Berg,
said, that kind of error was im
possible. "To get that far inside
the archipelago requires very
careful navigation," he said.
The tough Swedish stance,
including barring Soviet Em
bassy personnel from the area,
forced the Soviets to back off
from their earlier requests that
Soviet vessels assist the trapped
submarine.
