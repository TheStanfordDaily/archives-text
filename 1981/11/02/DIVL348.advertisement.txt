Taking a cue from Alice, who in Wonderland had fun
reading a looking-glass book, Scott Kim, a Stanford
graduate student in computer science, has
collected thousands of letters and words in
hundreds of typefaces and calligraphic forms and
played around with them inventively, sometimes
mischievously. The result is this album, 122 pages of
designs sure to dazzle and delight anyone to whom

formulator theory of relativity and transformed it
into a global shape.(McGraw-Hill/Byte, $8.95.)
