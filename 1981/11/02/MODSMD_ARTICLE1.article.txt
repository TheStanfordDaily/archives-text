# Vandals ransack Residential Education offices
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
"Somebody had a real party here,
and we only get to see the after
math," Norm Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, said
Friday, referring to a Thursday night
break-in of his offices which, he said,
resulted in "thousands of dollars"
worth of damage.
Vandals entered the third floor of
fices in Old Union by smashing in a
plate-glass window next to the door.
Coffee and a milk-like substance
were poured over calculators, type
writers and desks, and papers from
filing cabinets were strewn around
the office, Robinson said.
"Nothing is gone as far as we can
tell," said Robinson. "But it's a ter
rible mess and it's going to take a
while to get everything sorted out."
"Somebody just trashed our of
fice," said one staff member. "I've
spent the morning trying to undo the
glue in my appointment book."
Although Robinson said he wasn't
sure who had committed the van
dalism, a University press release
quoted him as saying, "It certainly is
hard to believe this wasn't connected
with the Zeta Psi (Zete) suspension."
No formal charges have been filed,
however.
Last Thursday Robinson an
nounced that, as a result of an inci
dent in which a Mills College woman
was dunked in the house pond, the
Zetes were suspended from campus
for three years. This means that the
fraternity is no longer officially rec
ognized by the University, cannot
hold fraternity events on campus,
and that all Zetes must move out of
the house at 353 Campus drive by De

cember 19.
Sergeant Phillip Love of the Stan
ford branch of the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriff's department said that al
though there are no known suspects,
"it's an odd coincidence that at noon
Thursday, Robinson had a meeting
with members of the Zeta Psi fraterni
ty, at 7 p.m. there was a house meet
ing, and that after that the incident
occurred."
Robinson said he had a meeting
with Thomas Allen, vice president of
the Zetes, on Friday morning.
"He promised me that if someone
in the house were responsible, he
would find out who and bring them
in," Robinson said.
Yesterday Allen said that "nobody
who lives in the house had done it."
"There is still a possibility that
someone we know is involved," he
said. "There are people who are away
at the game still, and other Zetes who
live off campus who I haven't in
terviewed yet. I can't say flatly that
those involved were not Zetes."
Allen said that if they found it was a
member of the fraternity who had
broken into the Old Union offices,
"we will expel them from the house
and turn them in to the authorities."
"The vandalism is probably not the
act of a group, but more likely indi
viduals within a group," said Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Love said that the amount of dam
age to the Residential Education of
fices was "substantial."
"Between the costs of repair for
machines and the cost of employee
wages cleaning up the place, the
damage was well over a thousand
dollars," he said. Love explained that
any vandalism more than that
amount is considered a felony. He
said that the District Attorney's office
would probably prosecute for felony
vandalism and breaking and enter
ing.
In addition, if the vandals are
found to be students, they may have
to face a Stanford judicial review for
possible violation of the University's
Honor Code.
"There was no evidence of forced
entry on the outside ot the building,"
said Love.
Exterior doors to Old Union are
locked at 5 p.m. daily, but many peo
ple who work there have keys to the
building. A stairwell door was found
open Friday morning.

broken into the Old Union offices,
"we will expel them from the house
and turn them in to the authorities."
"The vandalism is probably not the
act of a group, but more likely indi
viduals within a group," said Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Love said that the amount of dam
age to the Residential Education of
fices was "substantial."
"Between the costs of repair for
machines and the cost of employee
wages cleaning up the place, the
damage was well over a thousand
dollars," he said. Love explained that
any vandalism more than that
amount is considered a felony. He
said that the District Attorney's office
would probably prosecute for felony
vandalism and breaking and enter
ing.
In addition, if the vandals are
found to be students, they may have
to face a Stanford judicial review for
possible violation of the University's
Honor Code.
"There was no evidence of forced
entry on the outside ot the building,"
said Love.
Exterior doors to Old Union are
locked at 5 p.m. daily, but many peo
ple who work there have keys to the
building. A stairwell door was found
open Friday morning.

OFFICE MESS — The contents of files and desks strewn over the
floor greeted workers at the Office of Residential Education as they
arrived tor work Friday morning.
"Somebody had a real party here,
and we only get to see the after
math," Norm Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, said
Friday, referring to a Thursday night
break-in of his offices which, he said,
resulted in "thousands of dollars"
worth of damage.
Vandals entered the third floor of
fices in Old Union by smashing in a
plate-glass window next to the door.
Coffee and a milk-like substance
were poured over calculators, type
writers and desks, and papers from
filing cabinets were strewn around
the office, Robinson said.
"Nothing is gone as far as we can
tell," said Robinson. "But it's a ter
rible mess and it's going to take a
while to get everything sorted out."
"Somebody just trashed our of
fice," said one staff member. "I've
spent the morning trying to undo the
glue in my appointment book."
Although Robinson said he wasn't
sure who had committed the van
dalism, a University press release
quoted him as saying, "It certainly is
hard to believe this wasn't connected
with the Zeta Psi (Zete) suspension."
No formal charges have been filed,
however.
Last Thursday Robinson an
nounced that, as a result of an inci
dent in which a Mills College woman
was dunked in the house pond, the
Zetes were suspended from campus
for three years. This means that the
fraternity is no longer officially rec
ognized by the University, cannot
hold fraternity events on campus,
and that all Zetes must move out of
the house at 353 Campus drive by De

cember 19.
Sergeant Phillip Love of the Stan
ford branch of the Santa Clara Coun
ty Sheriff's department said that al
though there are no known suspects,
"it's an odd coincidence that at noon
Thursday, Robinson had a meeting
with members of the Zeta Psi fraterni
ty, at 7 p.m. there was a house meet
ing, and that after that the incident
occurred."
Robinson said he had a meeting
with Thomas Allen, vice president of
the Zetes, on Friday morning.
"He promised me that if someone
in the house were responsible, he
would find out who and bring them
in," Robinson said.
Yesterday Allen said that "nobody
who lives in the house had done it."
"There is still a possibility that
someone we know is involved," he
said. "There are people who are away
at the game still, and other Zetes who
live off campus who I haven't in
terviewed yet. I can't say flatly that
those involved were not Zetes."
Allen said that if they found it was a
member of the fraternity who had
broken into the Old Union offices,
"we will expel them from the house
and turn them in to the authorities."
"The vandalism is probably not the
act of a group, but more likely indi
viduals within a group," said Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Love said that the amount of dam
age to the Residential Education of
