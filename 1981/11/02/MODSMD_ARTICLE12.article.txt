## Women and the Visual Arts 
### Michael Weiss 
This quarter, the Jing Lyman Lecture series,
"Women and the Visual Arts," is striving to bring
attention to the work of women artists. The 10-
lecture series, which began on October 14, is
being sponsored by The Center for Research on
Women (CROW).
Originally titled the Crow Lecture Series, the
Jing Lyman Lecture Series took on its new name
last May as a tribute to the financial endowments
made last year on behalf of jing Lyman, wife of
former Stanford president Richard Lyman.
The series has previously covered such topics
as "Women and Political Process," "Gender and
the Writer," "Women and Health Care," as well
as several others.
According to Margo Davis, assistant director
of CROW, the organizationfelt it appropriate to
begin the Jing Lyman Series with "Women and
the Visual Arts," as Lyman continually supported
the visual arts during her and President Lyman's
stay at Stanford.
Bringing to the forefront women artists who
have not received adequate notice is the goal of
the series according to Davis. "There has not
been enough attention given to the work of
women artists."
Davis and Wanda Corn, associate professor of
art here, selected the lecturers. "We spent a lot
of time this summer finding a group of artists
which would appeal both to the undergraduates
and to the faculty," said Corn.
Corn was pleased with the wide variety of art
forms covered in the series. "By including topics
like film and photography, the series is able to
expand boundaries rather than constrict them,"
she said.
The five lectures which have already been giv
en demonstrate this variety. The series opened
with a lecture entitled, "Portrait of the Lady as an
Artist, 1890-1920," given by Corn.
Next was a panel discussion, "Women Collec
tors," featuring four women, each of whom was
a specialist in a different field of art collection.
The series then presented "Recollection: Ten
women of Photography," with photographer
and writer Margaretta Mitchell, who discussed
her recently published book on 10 women pho-

tographers and their work.
Women in cinema, the next topic, presented
"The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter," a
documentary film describing the experiences of
women workers during World War 11. Connie
Fields, the film's producer and director, at
tended the screening and answered audience
questions.
A presentation of the work of nationally ac
claimed artist Katherine Porter followed. Porter
is currently the Pamela Djerassi visiting artist at
Stanford — the Djerassi program is for women
artists who have demonstrated exceptional abili
ty.
Porter showed a slide presentation of her
work, while concurrently explaining the effects
of both geographical and political environment.
She explained that while working in New Mexi
co, her paintings emphasized the sun; in con
trast, the snowy landscapes of New England are
present in works done while she was in Boston
one winter.
"It (the series) was very well-planned, and I am
very pleased to be a part of it. . .it's important
that people become more exposed to women's
work," said Porter.
According to Corn, two of the program's high
lights are still to come: a lecture by Linda
Nochlin, critic of both 19th century and contem
porary art on Nov. 6 and a lecture by art critic
Lucy Lippard, on Nov. 20. Extra funds from the
jing Lyman emdowment and other donations
enable CROW to lure people from outside the
immediate area to the University — both women
will be coming from New York.
Links between the newly formed Feminist
Studies Program and the lecture series are fore
seeable in the future, said English Prof. Anne
Mellor, chairman of the new Feminist Studies
Program. According to Mellor, students en
rolled in "Women's Situation," a class offered
through the program this spring, will be re
quired to attend the Spring Lecture Series, "Sex,
Race and Class."
"We hope that the Jing Lyman endowed Lec
ture Series will be ever more closely related to
courses being offered by the Feminist Studies
Program," she said.

According to Corn, two of the program's high
lights are still to come: a lecture by Linda
Nochlin, critic of both 19th century and contem
porary art on Nov. 6 and a lecture by art critic
Lucy Lippard, on Nov. 20. Extra funds from the
jing Lyman emdowment and other donations
enable CROW to lure people from outside the
immediate area to the University — both women
will be coming from New York.
Links between the newly formed Feminist
Studies Program and the lecture series are fore
seeable in the future, said English Prof. Anne
Mellor, chairman of the new Feminist Studies
Program. According to Mellor, students en
rolled in "Women's Situation," a class offered
through the program this spring, will be re
quired to attend the Spring Lecture Series, "Sex,
Race and Class."
"We hope that the Jing Lyman endowed Lec
ture Series will be ever more closely related to
courses being offered by the Feminist Studies
Program," she said.


"PORTRAIT OF CARRIF," — by Marj»o Davis, assistant director of the Center tor Re
search on Women. The center sponsors the Jing Lyman Lectures this quarter.
This quarter, the Jing Lyman Lecture series,
"Women and the Visual Arts," is striving to bring
attention to the work of women artists. The 10-
lecture series, which began on October 14, is
being sponsored by The Center for Research on
Women (CROW).
Originally titled the Crow Lecture Series, the
Jing Lyman Lecture Series took on its new name
last May as a tribute to the financial endowments
made last year on behalf of jing Lyman, wife of
former Stanford president Richard Lyman.
The series has previously covered such topics
as "Women and Political Process," "Gender and
the Writer," "Women and Health Care," as well
as several others.
According to Margo Davis, assistant director
of CROW, the organizationfelt it appropriate to
begin the Jing Lyman Series with "Women and
the Visual Arts," as Lyman continually supported
the visual arts during her and President Lyman's
stay at Stanford.
Bringing to the forefront women artists who
have not received adequate notice is the goal of
the series according to Davis. "There has not
been enough attention given to the work of
women artists."
Davis and Wanda Corn, associate professor of
art here, selected the lecturers. "We spent a lot
of time this summer finding a group of artists
which would appeal both to the undergraduates
and to the faculty," said Corn.
Corn was pleased with the wide variety of art
forms covered in the series. "By including topics
like film and photography, the series is able to
expand boundaries rather than constrict them,"
she said.
The five lectures which have already been giv
en demonstrate this variety. The series opened
with a lecture entitled, "Portrait of the Lady as an
Artist, 1890-1920," given by Corn.
Next was a panel discussion, "Women Collec
tors," featuring four women, each of whom was
a specialist in a different field of art collection.
The series then presented "Recollection: Ten
women of Photography," with photographer
and writer Margaretta Mitchell, who discussed
her recently published book on 10 women pho-

tographers and their work.
Women in cinema, the next topic, presented
"The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter," a
documentary film describing the experiences of
women workers during World War 11. Connie
Fields, the film's producer and director, at
tended the screening and answered audience
questions.
A presentation of the work of nationally ac
claimed artist Katherine Porter followed. Porter
is currently the Pamela Djerassi visiting artist at
Stanford — the Djerassi program is for women
artists who have demonstrated exceptional abili
ty.
Porter showed a slide presentation of her
work, while concurrently explaining the effects
of both geographical and political environment.
She explained that while working in New Mexi
co, her paintings emphasized the sun; in con
trast, the snowy landscapes of New England are
present in works done while she was in Boston
one winter.
"It (the series) was very well-planned, and I am
very pleased to be a part of it. . .it's important
that people become more exposed to women's
work," said Porter.
According to Corn, two of the program's high
lights are still to come: a lecture by Linda
Nochlin, critic of both 19th century and contem
porary art on Nov. 6 and a lecture by art critic
Lucy Lippard, on Nov. 20. Extra funds from the
jing Lyman emdowment and other donations
enable CROW to lure people from outside the
immediate area to the University — both women
will be coming from New York.
