## Editorial Zete sanction merited 
### 
The suspension of Zeta Psi fraternity last week
was an unpleasant but necessary sanction. The
Zetes are Stanford's oldest fraternity, and have
had a chapter on campus since the University's
founding. They also have a history of
"behavioral problems," culminating in last
month's dunking of a Mills College woman into
the house pond, that indicates either an
unwillingness or an inability to keep their
actions within acceptable bounds. While the
sanctions imposed are harsh, they are justifiable
The record of theft, vandalism and
humiliation of various pledgesand women
compiled by the Zetes over the past six years is
staggering. Last spring, a University factfinding
committee reported a dozen instances of
criminal, destructive or abusive behavior,
including the famed bamboo stealing,
significant damage to the Zete House, the theft
of a wheelchair from Cowell, and the directing
of pledges to accost and harass passing female
joggers. Cleanup costs at the Zete house for the
last three years have been enough to pay a
student's tuition here.
Out of charity, gullibility in the face of
repeated assurances by chapter officials that
they were "working their buttsoff" to improve
the Zete's attitude, or pure ignorance,
University officials in spring 1980 decided
against imposing a recommended three-year
suspension. The Mills dunking incident sparked
a new round of investigations, culminating in a
unanimous recommendation of the same
penalty by an ad hoc faculty-student committee.
Norman Robinson, associatedean of student
affairs for residential education, who had
declined to impose the penalty last spring,
announced the suspension to Zeta Psi and
Interfraternity Council (IFC) officers last
Thursday amidst disbelief by Zete members and
considerable media attention. In addition to

losing their residence, Zeta Psi will be barred
from holding any meetings or activities —
including Rush — on campus for the next three
years.
While this is especially unfair to pledges who
have only lived in the house for only five weeks
and to members who do not actively participate
in the activities that have earned the Zetes their
notoriety, the University has exhausted itsother
means of controlling the behavior of the
organization. Individual members who have
committed particularly outrageous acts will also
be called to task — the Zetes responsible for the
dunking have been charged with assault and
battery. But all members must recognize that
the unraveling of their organization ispartofthe
collective responsibility they assumed when
they joined Zeta Psi in the first place, knowing of
its history, its reputation,and the inclinations of
some or all of its members.
Still, the University should minimize harm to
innocent individuals. While weapproveof the
disbanding of the organization and the dispersal
of its members throughout the housing system,
restricting residence to two Zetes per dorm may
force some individual Zetes to move off campus.
This is an unnecessarily harsh infliction of
punishment on random individuals. The
administration should clarify this proposal, and
amend it if necessary to allow Zetes with
guaranteed housing to live on campus if they so
desire.
With that caveat, the University's actions are
to becommended.The violence, insensitivity
and offensivenessof the Zetes has tarnished the
image of every other fraternity on campus. The
passing of Zeta Psi closes a chapter in Stanford
history, but we are glad to see the climate of
violence associated with fraternal organizations
on campus dissipated.
