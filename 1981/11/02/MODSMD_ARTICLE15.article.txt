## Quality of teaching should be included in tenure decisions 
### 
The University, for me at least, is a
bipolar place. At one pole bustles the
student world: classes and frat
parties, shows and athletic contests,
LSATs and MCATs and dissertations
that lurk in the night. At the other
pole, a more quiet pole, sits the sys
tem tV-\at tends oui reveVs and level
ations. The system, housed in squat
offices marked "Development" and
in the corridors of Encina Hall, cul
tivates the endowment, administers
the budget, decides who stands be
hind the lectern and who sits in front
of it.
Most students rarely notice the
maze of regulations and offices that
administer Stanford until something
stains efficiency's immaculate face.
Often University administrative er
rors are simply isolated procedural
stumbles; other times, they reflect a
substantive flaw in policy.
One such flaw surfaced last year,
when I took a class from a superb
professor who had been denied
tenure. Ombudsman John Goheen
among others, explained to me that
the question of fairness in tenure de
cisions has created problems before:
it is more than an isolated and occa
sional stumble.

Stanford, like most American uni
versities, professes two purposes: to
teach and to research. In theory, the
two can coexist peacefully and even
enhance each other. Many of us
came to Stanford hoping to study
with outstanding scholars in our
chosen fie\<A. We a\*o came lo receive
outstanding classroom teaching. In
principle, teaching ability and re
search ability weigh equally; still,
when the billet is on the line, re
search prowess and reputation seem
of prime importance.
Emphasizing research makes some
sense. In the politics of academia, a
Nobel Prize or National Book Award
is worth hundreds of slam-bang lec
tures on Kierkegaard and keeps Stan
ford high on the prestige pile. Per
haps more important than prestige,
research opens the corporate and
governmental monetary floodgate. It
also gives students the chance to
know men and women who not only
teach a subject, but change it with
their scholarship.
Despite these obvious advantages,
putting research above teaching en
dangers instructional quality.
Teaching ability and research ex
cellence, though never mutually ex

elusive, rarely occupy the same per
son equally. In this day of consulting
professors, academic competition,
and gene splices, the temptation to
overemphasize research in tenure
matters is enormous.
Tenure decisions are made, ac
cotding to ihc Faculty Handbook , U%-
ing student evaluations, colleague
evaluations, biographical data and
outside evaluations of teaching and
published work. The structure in
cludes a rigorous and fundamentally
fair grievance procedure. Obviously,
a person might be denied tenure be
cause of financial dictates or because
a department already overflows with
tenured fat uity; however, thesystem
cannot always prevent political
wrangling over an appointment.
Specifically, the observed tenden
cy in weak University departments is
to seek established superstars rather
than potential superstars or, more ac
curately, a young professor whose
publication is relatively unacclaimed
but whose teaching has been ex
cellent. The department might ul
timately reject the young professor
and offer the position to a published
professor from outside the Univer
sity: the result is instant prestige but

not necessarily instant instructional
quality.
More improprieties can result
from the solicitation of outside eval
uations of published work. They help
avoid faculty nepotism which in
evitably weakens a university; they
can also sabotage legitimate academ
ic efforts and condemn adventurous
thinking.
The problem of tenure ultimately

reduces to one of practical priority:
can Stanford, in a research-crazed
time, promote fine teaching? At
present, the scale tips toward re
search. The University, given a
choice between an outstanding
scholar and good teacher or an out
standing teacher and good scholar,
will usually choose the former.
That can change. Although publi
cation is extremely important, any

evaluation, either internal or ex
ternal, must employ some rough and
ready standard of excellence. To
label any work good or bad one or
two years after publication is pure
pomposity. In most cases, the Uni
versity probably takes evaluations
witH a grain of salt. But the tempta
tion to live by external opinion, to
feast on prestige, can taint a tenure
decision.

Expansion of the present Adjunct
Professor position might finally
eliminate the inequity. An Adjunct
Professor, as defined by the Faculty
Handbook, is a professor, ". . .
judged by the normal tenure stan
dards with respect either to teaching
and practice or research and scholar
ship but not both," (p. 20). Adjunct
Professors ". . . normally hold conti
nuing terms of appointment which

may be terminated when satisfactory
performance or programmatic need
ceases."
In thesamespirit, a certain number
of posts in each department could be
designated teaching posts, a certain
number research posts, with some
staying general. Flexible responsi
bilities would allow for teaching by
research professors and research by
teachers. The emphasis placed on
teaching or research in a tenure de
cision should be dictated by the
purpose of the vacant post. With this
structure, only truly unqualified can
didates would be eliminated from
the faculty pool.
This might all ring of useless ab
straction, but several students, myself
included, witnessed a tenure denial
permeated by academic politicism.
Stanford's other side naturally affects
the students; in this case, it fired one
of the first professors to make me ap
plaud and see potentially dry subject
matter as vibrant and important. The
teacher, regardless of research abili
ty, is lost to future Stanford students.
Such a loss, more than a simple
stumble, shows a flaw in the system.

can Stanford, in a research-crazed
time, promote fine teaching? At
present, the scale tips toward re
search. The University, given a
choice between an outstanding
scholar and good teacher or an out
standing teacher and good scholar,
will usually choose the former.
That can change. Although publi
cation is extremely important, any

evaluation, either internal or ex
ternal, must employ some rough and
ready standard of excellence. To
label any work good or bad one or
two years after publication is pure
pomposity. In most cases, the Uni
versity probably takes evaluations
witH a grain of salt. But the tempta
tion to live by external opinion, to
feast on prestige, can taint a tenure
decision.

Expansion of the present Adjunct
Professor position might finally
eliminate the inequity. An Adjunct
Professor, as defined by the Faculty
Handbook, is a professor, ". . .
judged by the normal tenure stan
dards with respect either to teaching
and practice or research and scholar
ship but not both," (p. 20). Adjunct
Professors ". . . normally hold conti
nuing terms of appointment which

may be terminated when satisfactory
performance or programmatic need
ceases."
In thesamespirit, a certain number
of posts in each department could be
designated teaching posts, a certain
number research posts, with some
staying general. Flexible responsi
bilities would allow for teaching by
research professors and research by
teachers. The emphasis placed on
teaching or research in a tenure de
cision should be dictated by the
purpose of the vacant post. With this
structure, only truly unqualified can
didates would be eliminated from
the faculty pool.
This might all ring of useless ab
straction, but several students, myself
included, witnessed a tenure denial
permeated by academic politicism.
Stanford's other side naturally affects
the students; in this case, it fired one
of the first professors to make me ap
plaud and see potentially dry subject
matter as vibrant and important. The
teacher, regardless of research abili
ty, is lost to future Stanford students.
Such a loss, more than a simple
stumble, shows a flaw in the system.
(jerry Wertheim, a regular columnist,
is a sophomore majoring in English.)

The University, for me at least, is a
bipolar place. At one pole bustles the
student world: classes and frat
parties, shows and athletic contests,
LSATs and MCATs and dissertations
that lurk in the night. At the other
pole, a more quiet pole, sits the sys
tem tV-\at tends oui reveVs and level
ations. The system, housed in squat
offices marked "Development" and
in the corridors of Encina Hall, cul
tivates the endowment, administers
the budget, decides who stands be
hind the lectern and who sits in front
of it.
Most students rarely notice the
maze of regulations and offices that
administer Stanford until something
stains efficiency's immaculate face.
Often University administrative er
rors are simply isolated procedural
stumbles; other times, they reflect a
substantive flaw in policy.
One such flaw surfaced last year,
when I took a class from a superb
professor who had been denied
tenure. Ombudsman John Goheen
among others, explained to me that
the question of fairness in tenure de
cisions has created problems before:
it is more than an isolated and occa
sional stumble.

Stanford, like most American uni
versities, professes two purposes: to
teach and to research. In theory, the
two can coexist peacefully and even
enhance each other. Many of us
came to Stanford hoping to study
with outstanding scholars in our
chosen fie\<A. We a\*o came lo receive
outstanding classroom teaching. In
principle, teaching ability and re
search ability weigh equally; still,
when the billet is on the line, re
search prowess and reputation seem
of prime importance.
Emphasizing research makes some
sense. In the politics of academia, a
Nobel Prize or National Book Award
is worth hundreds of slam-bang lec
tures on Kierkegaard and keeps Stan
ford high on the prestige pile. Per
haps more important than prestige,
research opens the corporate and
governmental monetary floodgate. It
also gives students the chance to
know men and women who not only
teach a subject, but change it with
their scholarship.
Despite these obvious advantages,
putting research above teaching en
dangers instructional quality.
Teaching ability and research ex
cellence, though never mutually ex

elusive, rarely occupy the same per
