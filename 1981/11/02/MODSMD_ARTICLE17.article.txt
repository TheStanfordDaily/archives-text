## Block grant plan induces own collapse 
### 
"New Federalism" was dealt a death blow over
the summer by the Administration and Congress.
By the time these two institutions were through
with the cornerstone of the so-called "quiet feder
alist revolution" — the block grant scheme — they
had transformed the idea far beyond original ex
pectations and had established built-in mecha
nisms which all but guarantee the concept's even
tual collapse.
Block grants have been around for years as part
of the Federal system for providing grants-in-aid to
states and municipalities; in fiscal 1981 this system
was a mix of five block grants, approximately 500
categorical grants, and one general revenue shar
ing grant.
Categorical grants are individually funded by
Congress for a specific purpose and are generally
known for the mountain of administrative paper
work which they generate. Block grantsare usually
the consolidation of categorical grants within a
broad functional area. The recipient (state govern
ment) may dispense funds within that area largely
at its discretion; however, block grants may re
quire the submission of a disbursement plan and
general accountability to a Federal department.
President Ronald Reagan's original plan was to
give states largely unlimited discretion to disburse
funds within a single functional area, holding them
accountable only to their local constituencies.
Governors were confident that they could absorb
cutbacks of up to 10 percent without trimming
programs, in exchange for greater flexibility in the
use of Federal funds.
The plan seemed a sure-fire winner. It would
achieve necessary budget cuts, reduce excessive
regulation, further states' rights and eliminate cost
ly parallel administrative structures — and it would
do so without a loss of essential services.
Reagan set the tenor of the ensuing Con
gressional block grant debate by all-too-carefully
selecting categorical programs for consolidation
and not including for consolidation all grants
within a single functional area. He then requested

cutbacks of 25 percent — well above what the
states said they could afford.
Georgia's Governor George Busbee declared
Reagan's Federalism to be merely "picking out the
most expensive, difficult-to-manage and political
ly controversial Federal programs and handing
them over to the states with a heartfelt sigh of re
lief." Reagan's plan backfired; instead of battling
each other for control of these reduced funds,
state and local jurisdictions began abandoning old
grudges to unite against Washington.
Congress cast itself in the role of Supreme Pro
tectress of Those Who Would Be Consolidated, at
tacked with the Senate Labor and Human Re
sources Committee and House Education and La
bor Committee, and delighted in newspaper head
lines of "Reagan Didn't Get All He Wanted."
The end result was a program far less sweeping
than the President had requested. 57 programs
were consolidated into nine block grants, their
funds cut by 25 percent after adjustment for infla
tion.
Of the nine block grants, only three - Maternal
and Child Health, Preventive Health and Health
Services, Education — are "new" to any significant
degree. Yet even these are not really block grants;
Congress balked at giving the states necessary flex
ibility and established restrictions designed to
force states to spend the money for the same pro
grams and purposes as in the past. States thus re
ceived funding cuts without a parallel grant of
wider discretionary powers.
-State efforts to meet the block grant challenge
were also hamstrung by the fact that key programs
within functional areas were not consolidated. The
33 education programs, when consolidated, form
only a small part of the total Federal education pro
gram. Why? Many political reputations depended
upon the protection of "pet" programs from block
grant consolidation and anonymity. The retention
of the categorical structure has also been in
terpreted as the triumph of the bureau
crat/specialist over the legislator/generalist. To

Congress' own interpretation — that they "saved"
programs from almost certain destruction at the
hands of state governments — I would ask: Could
this be a reflection upon the merits of these pro
grams?
The parting shot was contained in the overall
directives for states' use of block grant funds. The
requirement of public hearings, though intended
to ensure that rural or politically-disadvantaged in
terests are treated fairly by state governments, can
instead be expected to become forums for com
plaints against the Reagan administration by those
who stand to lose funds under the new scheme
and Democrats who stand to gain political points
from anti-administration rabble.
Immediate changes need to be made in order to
save block grants and "New Federalism."
The administration should seek smaller reduc
tions in more programs next year. A cut of 10 per
cent in a wider range of programs will achieve
greater cost savings and fewer dissatisfied parties
than will cuts of 25 percent in a narrower set of pro
grams. Earlystepsshould betaken to make federal
ism a two-way-street, perhaps by beginning a trade
of all education programs for Medicaid.
Congress should lift cumbersome restrictions
and allow "favored children" — categorical pro
grams created by incumbents — to join those who
have been consolidated before them.
The optimum mix of block grant and revenue
sharing theory — consolidation of all programs
within broad functional areas, holding states ac
countable to their public and not to a Federal ad
ministrator, minimum restrictions on use of funds
within each area — should be aspired to by all
parties involved in order to achieve genuine
budget savings, rather than merely shifting ex
penses from the Federal government to the states.
The current system is a half-way effort destined to
become a political liability in the coming elections.

parties involved in order to achieve genuine

"New Federalism" was dealt a death blow over
the summer by the Administration and Congress.
By the time these two institutions were through
with the cornerstone of the so-called "quiet feder
alist revolution" — the block grant scheme — they
had transformed the idea far beyond original ex
pectations and had established built-in mecha
nisms which all but guarantee the concept's even
tual collapse.
Block grants have been around for years as part
of the Federal system for providing grants-in-aid to
states and municipalities; in fiscal 1981 this system
was a mix of five block grants, approximately 500
categorical grants, and one general revenue shar
ing grant.
Categorical grants are individually funded by
Congress for a specific purpose and are generally
known for the mountain of administrative paper
work which they generate. Block grantsare usually
the consolidation of categorical grants within a
broad functional area. The recipient (state govern
ment) may dispense funds within that area largely
at its discretion; however, block grants may re
quire the submission of a disbursement plan and
general accountability to a Federal department.
President Ronald Reagan's original plan was to
give states largely unlimited discretion to disburse
funds within a single functional area, holding them
accountable only to their local constituencies.
Governors were confident that they could absorb
cutbacks of up to 10 percent without trimming
programs, in exchange for greater flexibility in the
use of Federal funds.
The plan seemed a sure-fire winner. It would
achieve necessary budget cuts, reduce excessive
regulation, further states' rights and eliminate cost
ly parallel administrative structures — and it would
do so without a loss of essential services.
Reagan set the tenor of the ensuing Con
gressional block grant debate by all-too-carefully
selecting categorical programs for consolidation
and not including for consolidation all grants
within a single functional area. He then requested

cutbacks of 25 percent — well above what the
states said they could afford.
Georgia's Governor George Busbee declared
Reagan's Federalism to be merely "picking out the
most expensive, difficult-to-manage and political
ly controversial Federal programs and handing
them over to the states with a heartfelt sigh of re
lief." Reagan's plan backfired; instead of battling
each other for control of these reduced funds,
state and local jurisdictions began abandoning old
grudges to unite against Washington.
Congress cast itself in the role of Supreme Pro
tectress of Those Who Would Be Consolidated, at
tacked with the Senate Labor and Human Re
sources Committee and House Education and La
bor Committee, and delighted in newspaper head
lines of "Reagan Didn't Get All He Wanted."
The end result was a program far less sweeping
than the President had requested. 57 programs
were consolidated into nine block grants, their
funds cut by 25 percent after adjustment for infla
tion.
Of the nine block grants, only three - Maternal
and Child Health, Preventive Health and Health
Services, Education — are "new" to any significant
degree. Yet even these are not really block grants;
Congress balked at giving the states necessary flex
ibility and established restrictions designed to
force states to spend the money for the same pro
grams and purposes as in the past. States thus re
ceived funding cuts without a parallel grant of
wider discretionary powers.
-State efforts to meet the block grant challenge
were also hamstrung by the fact that key programs
within functional areas were not consolidated. The
33 education programs, when consolidated, form
only a small part of the total Federal education pro
gram. Why? Many political reputations depended
upon the protection of "pet" programs from block
grant consolidation and anonymity. The retention
of the categorical structure has also been in
terpreted as the triumph of the bureau
crat/specialist over the legislator/generalist. To

Congress' own interpretation — that they "saved"
programs from almost certain destruction at the
hands of state governments — I would ask: Could
this be a reflection upon the merits of these pro
grams?
The parting shot was contained in the overall
directives for states' use of block grant funds. The
requirement of public hearings, though intended
to ensure that rural or politically-disadvantaged in
terests are treated fairly by state governments, can
instead be expected to become forums for com
plaints against the Reagan administration by those
who stand to lose funds under the new scheme
and Democrats who stand to gain political points
from anti-administration rabble.
Immediate changes need to be made in order to
save block grants and "New Federalism."
The administration should seek smaller reduc
tions in more programs next year. A cut of 10 per
cent in a wider range of programs will achieve
greater cost savings and fewer dissatisfied parties
than will cuts of 25 percent in a narrower set of pro
grams. Earlystepsshould betaken to make federal
ism a two-way-street, perhaps by beginning a trade
of all education programs for Medicaid.
