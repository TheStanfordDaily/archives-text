## Bergstrom and Cole Presidential trio plans a coup 
### 
Less than a month a go a historic oc
casion took place following the tragic
assassination of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat: the three living former
Presidents travelled together to
Cairo for the funeral aboard Air
force One. fournalists around the
world speculated on the content of
the Presidents' conversations, al
though no official record of them
was kept. Fortunately, Richard Nixon
was among those present, and two
enterprising young Stanford Daily re
porters, Luke Woodward and Tod
Bernstein, have obtained a copy of
secretly recorded tapes of the trip
from a source known only as "Misty
Beethoven."
Although (he original source of the
tapes is unconfirmed, Nixon's per
sonal secretary Rosemary Woods was
reportedly seen following the three
former Presidents around the plane
with a potted plant. With the excep
tion of an 18 minute gap, the follow
ing represents a key conversation be
tween the three:
Nixon: Jerry, Jimmy — I don't
know about the two of you, but since
I left the White House I've been
doing quite a bit of reading, and
there's one book that has particularly
caught my attention. It's called Coup
d'ltat . . . it's a brilliant guide to tak
ing over a nation — it has illustra
tions, timetables and even diagrams.
Carter: Dick, are you suggesting
that you plan to take over the gov
ernment?
Nixon: Not just me, Jimmy, the
three of us. It would be great to work
together for once — And three's
even historical precedent, the an

cient Roman triumvirate between
Octavius, Aemilius Lepidus, and
Mark Antony.
Ford: Wasn't it M-A-R-C Antony?
Nixon: Shut up Jerry.
Ford: What about Ronald Reagan?
He's not going to go along with this
Carter: Come on, Jerry, we all
know Ron's not going to last the four
years anyway ... if old age doesn't
get him, organized labor will.
Nixon: I've been spending a lot of
time getting the old gang together —
the ones that are out of jail, that is.
Ehrlichman and Haldeman have
been working for Jerry Falwell lately,
but they're ready whenever we are.
And I've even rounded up G.
Gordon Liddy off the lecture circuit
— he told me that he didn't ap
preciate any trouble getting some
foreign-nationalists after the exodus
from Cuba last year.
Carter: I thought I saw G. Gordon
back there . . . holding his hand over
a lighted candle . . .
Ford: When's dinner?
Nixon: Shut up, Jerry.
Carter: Dick, just how do you plan
on pulling this off?
Nixon: It'll work like this:
(At this point in the tape there is an
unexplained IBV2 minute gap. When
the tape continues, there is a large
commotion. Apparently former Pres
ident Ford had gotten the tablecloth
caught in the fly of his pants and then
stood up.)
Nixon: Jerry, you (expletive de
leted)! You dunderhead!
Carter: I should have expected this

from the same man who with a single
sentence freed Poland from Russian
hegemony.
ford: Oh shoot! I spilled my milk
all over my Sports Illustrated.
Nixon: Shut up, Jerry.
Carter: Dick, do you really believe
it's possible to pull the wool over the
eyes of the American public like this?
Nixon: Oh sure Jimmy, it's easy. I
was elected to my second term by the
largest margin in history. And now
we have men in all the right places.
Carter : Well, of course it's true that
Alexander Haig does have an impor
tant position in the present adminis
tration, but do you really think that
he'll be able to take command like
you're planning?
Nixon: Of course, he's been prac
ticing.
Carter: And what about George
Bush?
Nixon: He can be bought off with a
lifetime supply of penny-loafers and
Izod shirts. The man's a chameleon.
Ford: Have either of you seen my
donut?... I lost mydonut. . .
Nixon and Carter: Shut up, Jerry.
Carter: You know, I think this plan
is feasible . . . and I think Miss Lillian
will go along with it.
Nixon: We can sure show our fel
low Americans who's boss . . .
Carter: This will certainly bring us
back out of oblivion . . .
l ord: Can I sit by the window now?
