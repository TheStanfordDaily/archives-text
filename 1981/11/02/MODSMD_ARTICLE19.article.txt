## Is criticizing frats the new fall fad? 
### 
"Oh, I see we have some guys from
the fraternities here. You two must
have some kind of party announce
ment, huh?," the Wilbur R.A.
snapped as he looked over his flock
of freshmen like a protective
shepherd.
"No, actually we're here from the
Senate. We're your dorm's Senate
representatives tHis year," I replied.
"We'd just like a few minutes to let
the freshmen know about Senate in
ternships."
"Oh, of course. Uh, sorry. Go
ahead."
I could not believe it. Why did we
have to defend our presence at a
house meeting? Actually, I should
have believed it — this may be Cali
fornia, but this is also Stanford, and
this school has a strange system of
prioritizing issues. Recently, the Dai
ly gave the Phi Delt calendar and the
Zete dunking front-page priority
over the proposed sale of AWACS to
Saudi Arabia. It seems that Stanford
has made criticism of fraternities the
new fall fad.
Wait, you may say, I thought the
(ondemnation of fraternities was not
supposed to start until spring rush?
Oh, haven't you noticed? This year
something new is being tried — the
Stanford community is bringing this
fashion out a little early so that the
appeal to the masses can be tested.
So far it has been a hit: the Women's
Center is secretly taping phone con
versations with Phi Delts; R.A.s
around campus are writing letters to
women on the Phi Delt calendar ask
ing how they could let themselves be
"used;" and the Zetes were just
kicked off campus.
Somehow, I get this sense that
fraternities are not too popular
around here.
Maybe it is that people do not like
us because all of us are rich, elitist
snobs who steal freshmen women
from their dorms, drink too much,
save the best seats at the football
games, have sorority exchanges,
wear Polo shirts, and drive BMWs.
Maybe they are right. But then again

maybe everybody in the Italian
House is Italian and all Californians
surf.
It may not be realized, but the
Greek system at Stanford is unique. If
you have ever been to Cal or Indiana
University you would see over thirty
fraternities, possibly twenty sorority
houses, and a campus social life built
around the Greek system. It does not
dominate this campus' social life, and
I think most people would agree that
we are better for it.
Let us also give the students in the
fraternities a little credit. Once upon
a time, when we were freshmen, we
all lived as one in the dorms, and we
all joined together against those
lousy frat upperclassmen who stole
our girls for their "Freshmen Fire
sides." We all trusted that Dean
Hargadon had accepted us because
we were quality people with high
standards for academic and extracur
ricular achievement. We could not
understand how those frat guys got
in.
Then came sophomore year. At
that time, we were given the option
of living with people with similar in
terests. All of those special people we
had known as freshmen went their
own ways. Some even decided to be
come "one of them" and so joined
the detested fraternities.
Students in fraternities here,
though, are Stanford students first
and fraternity members second. Just
as Stanford football players are not
typical dumb jocks, neither are Stan
ford fraternity members merely
fraternity members. Where else but
in Stanford fraternities would actives
find out their pledges' midterm
schedules before they rolled them
out at 3 a.m.? At Stanford, fraternities
are more than just a living option, but
compared to other schools, the Stan
ford Greek system can only be called
meek. Not that we mind —
fraternities here are only a small
aspect of a diverse place.
It is because I can foresee a de
terioration of this diversity of the
Stanford community that I am upset.

I will be the first to admit that a lot of
fraternity activities are very "frat
like." Sure the Phi Delt calendar is
controversial, but then so is the Equal
Rights Amendment.
Is the fact that fifteen Stanford girls
are going to pose fully-clothed in
scenic spots around campus re
alistically going to put women back
fifty years? Why did sixty girts show
up for the Phi Delts' initial photo ses
sion? Why have the girls picked for
the calendar chosen to ignore the
pleading of those R.A.s who think the
whole thing is a crime against wom
en? And why every spring are there
hundreds of freshmen going through
and joining the fraternities around
campus? Is it not apparent to those
complaining that there is a large
group of Stanford students who en
joy fraternity activities?
What would it really be like around
here if there were no fraternities to
kick around? Sure there would not
be any more of those crowded frat
parties where you never can get any
beer, but would their absence really
be a positive change? If people are so
down on fraternities, why are those
parties that you hate so crowded? It is
because the fraternities at Stanford
are an integral part of this campus,
and there are a lot of people who ac
cept them for what they are —
whether it be good or bad.
I do not condemn the recent
criticism of the negative aspects of
fraternity life. A diversity of thinking
will keep this campus on its toes. The
problem arises when this thinking is
converted into actions that decrease
the diversity of Stanford. The
elimination of fraternities and their
activities — whether it is done slowly
or all at once — would be one way to
do it.
Fraternity activities are definitely
not Stanford's whole life, but they are
and should continue to be part of it.
Come on Stanford, loosen up.

we are better for it.
Let us also give the students in the
fraternities a little credit. Once upon
a time, when we were freshmen, we
all lived as one in the dorms, and we
all joined together against those
lousy frat upperclassmen who stole
our girls for their "Freshmen Fire
sides." We all trusted that Dean
Hargadon had accepted us because
we were quality people with high
standards for academic and extracur
ricular achievement. We could not
understand how those frat guys got
in.
Then came sophomore year. At
that time, we were given the option
of living with people with similar in
terests. All of those special people we
had known as freshmen went their
own ways. Some even decided to be
come "one of them" and so joined
the detested fraternities.
Students in fraternities here,
though, are Stanford students first
and fraternity members second. Just
as Stanford football players are not
typical dumb jocks, neither are Stan
ford fraternity members merely
fraternity members. Where else but
in Stanford fraternities would actives
find out their pledges' midterm
schedules before they rolled them
out at 3 a.m.? At Stanford, fraternities
are more than just a living option, but
compared to other schools, the Stan
ford Greek system can only be called
meek. Not that we mind —
fraternities here are only a small
aspect of a diverse place.
It is because I can foresee a de
terioration of this diversity of the
Stanford community that I am upset.

I will be the first to admit that a lot of
fraternity activities are very "frat
like." Sure the Phi Delt calendar is
controversial, but then so is the Equal
Rights Amendment.
Is the fact that fifteen Stanford girls
are going to pose fully-clothed in
scenic spots around campus re
alistically going to put women back
fifty years? Why did sixty girts show
up for the Phi Delts' initial photo ses
sion? Why have the girls picked for
the calendar chosen to ignore the
pleading of those R.A.s who think the
whole thing is a crime against wom
en? And why every spring are there
hundreds of freshmen going through
and joining the fraternities around
campus? Is it not apparent to those
complaining that there is a large
group of Stanford students who en
joy fraternity activities?
What would it really be like around
here if there were no fraternities to
kick around? Sure there would not
be any more of those crowded frat
parties where you never can get any
beer, but would their absence really
be a positive change? If people are so
down on fraternities, why are those
parties that you hate so crowded? It is
because the fraternities at Stanford
are an integral part of this campus,
and there are a lot of people who ac
cept them for what they are —
whether it be good or bad.
I do not condemn the recent
criticism of the negative aspects of
fraternity life. A diversity of thinking
will keep this campus on its toes. The
problem arises when this thinking is
converted into actions that decrease
the diversity of Stanford. The
elimination of fraternities and their
activities — whether it is done slowly
or all at once — would be one way to
do it.
Fraternity activities are definitely
not Stanford's whole life, but they are
and should continue to be part of it.
Come on Stanford, loosen up.

"Oh, I see we have some guys from
the fraternities here. You two must
have some kind of party announce
ment, huh?," the Wilbur R.A.
snapped as he looked over his flock
of freshmen like a protective
shepherd.
"No, actually we're here from the
Senate. We're your dorm's Senate
representatives tHis year," I replied.
"We'd just like a few minutes to let
the freshmen know about Senate in
ternships."
"Oh, of course. Uh, sorry. Go
ahead."
I could not believe it. Why did we
have to defend our presence at a
house meeting? Actually, I should
have believed it — this may be Cali
fornia, but this is also Stanford, and
this school has a strange system of
prioritizing issues. Recently, the Dai
ly gave the Phi Delt calendar and the
Zete dunking front-page priority
over the proposed sale of AWACS to
Saudi Arabia. It seems that Stanford
has made criticism of fraternities the
new fall fad.
Wait, you may say, I thought the
(ondemnation of fraternities was not
supposed to start until spring rush?
Oh, haven't you noticed? This year
something new is being tried — the
Stanford community is bringing this
fashion out a little early so that the
appeal to the masses can be tested.
So far it has been a hit: the Women's
Center is secretly taping phone con
versations with Phi Delts; R.A.s
around campus are writing letters to
women on the Phi Delt calendar ask
ing how they could let themselves be
"used;" and the Zetes were just
kicked off campus.
Somehow, I get this sense that
fraternities are not too popular
around here.
Maybe it is that people do not like
us because all of us are rich, elitist
snobs who steal freshmen women
from their dorms, drink too much,
save the best seats at the football
games, have sorority exchanges,
wear Polo shirts, and drive BMWs.
Maybe they are right. But then again

maybe everybody in the Italian
House is Italian and all Californians
surf.
It may not be realized, but the
Greek system at Stanford is unique. If
you have ever been to Cal or Indiana
University you would see over thirty
fraternities, possibly twenty sorority
houses, and a campus social life built
around the Greek system. It does not
dominate this campus' social life, and
I think most people would agree that
we are better for it.
