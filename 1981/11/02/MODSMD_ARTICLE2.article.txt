Two members of the Zeta Psi
fraternity were arrested Friday in
connection with the dunking of a 20-
year-old Mills College student in the
house pond during a social exchange
oÂ«i, a.. -
Sophomores Mark Pearson and
Thomas Dickson were charged with
battery and released after posting
$500 bail each, according to Sheriff's
Detective Katherine Miller. They are
to appear at a pre-trial hearing later
this month.

The warrant for their arrest was is
sued on the request of the District At
torney's office. The D.A. routinely re
ceives police reports and can file
charges on behalf of the people of
California. The victim in the incident,
Michelle Smith, did not file the
charges, according to Miller.
The Zeta Psi fraternity was sus
pended from campus for three years
last Thursday after an ad-hoc Univer
sity committee reviewed the dunking
incident and recommended such ac

tion to Norman Robinson, associate
dean of residential education.
Also last Thursday night various
members of the Zeta Psi fraternity,
while at a Senior Pub Night at the
Golden SpiWo restaurant, "damaned
carpets and broke beer glasses," ac
cording to management sources.
Sources said, however, that fraternity
representatives "came back and
made restitution" for the damage.A
fraternity source confirmed this in
formation.
