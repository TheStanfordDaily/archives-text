## Corporate lifestyle lures law grads 
### 
Washington — Tom always
dreamed of saving the world. Top in
his class at Yale Law School, "Mr.
Altruism" had planned to use his le
gal education and a superior inteller t
to "reduce human suffering."
Like so many of America's sharpest
law graduates, however, Tom isn't
forcing chemical companies to clean
up their toxic-waste sites. Instead,
he's earning $44,000 per year as a
first-year associate at one of New
York's leading corporate law firms.
Our earnest friend is only the latest
in a string of pals who've succumbed
to extravagant recruiting campaigns
by corporate law firms. Given peer
pressures and financial inducements,
it's easy to see why.
This month, America's major law
firms are busy recruiting students, es
pecially those from the top 15
schools. They're armed with goodies
that would curry the envy of the
sleaziest college football recruiter.
The con game begins at the start of
a student's second year.
In a recent survey of summer in
terns at prominent law firms, The
American Lawyer magazine reported
that, in addition to $800-per-week
salaries, many second-year \aw stu
dents have enjoyed the following:
Offers by one New York firm to
pick up the tab for five "fantasy
nights" on the town.
Summer-rental subsidies of up to
75 percent from another New York
firm.
If the attractions of a summer in

ternship don't clinch an associate's
loyalty, some firms let yacht privi
leges, steak tartar lunches and other
pleasantries do the talking.
"I just couldn't turn it down," poor
Tom told us recently. "I know what
you guys think. I had to pay off my
law school bills. And there was in
tense competition to land a job in
New York City. F.ven my dean said I
shouldn't reject an opportunity like
this."
Meanwhile, Tom's counterparts at
Stanford and Harvard are receiving
placement counselors' advice to
forego public interest law.
Last month, a Harvard placement
adviser told students with an eye on
public interest law to interview with
corporate firms as a safety valve. With
the federal government's Legal Ser
vices Corporation out of business
and a freeze on government hiring,
looking for a public service job might
be worth neither the hassle nor the
money, he said.
Of course, though junior as
sociates may work long, stressful
hours at major firms, the amenities of
first-class travel, lobster dinners and
deluxe hotels can be irresistible.
Other who've been sm\\\en
by big-time corporate law readily ad
mit it's a difficult lifestyle to reject.
But should our pal Tom follow the
example of other attorney friends,
he'll soon be taking more pride in his
possessions than in his achievements.
Before long he'll be driving a $24,000
turbocharged Porsche on the road to

happiness.
While corporate America may
need a good defense, it's a pity the
private sector has a monopoly on the
nation's sharpest young minds.
Where are our potential leaders you
may ask?
They're out eating lobster — and
all at the expense of the taxpayer.
To bust this brainpower trust, law
schools should consider requiring
students to spend their third year
working with trial lawyers in local
courts as part of their degree pro
gram. Those students who do work
part time do so usually on their own
initiative. Besides gaining courtroom
experience, future lawyers could soil
their hands on something other than
realty agreements and cracked crab.
It's true that most private firms
wholeheartedly work to obtain jus
tice for all individuals and organiza
tions. You need not work for Com
mon Cause to defend the public
trust.
By the time senior partners enter
public life in their late 40s and 50s,
however, most have lost their zeal
and idealism for healthy change.
We can't condemn our friends for
falling into the lobster trap. For them,
it's the only game in town. But we
wish they wouldn't sacrifice their
youthful perspective for pricey
prawns so soon.
