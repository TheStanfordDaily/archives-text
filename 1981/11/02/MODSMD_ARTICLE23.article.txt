## In Romania, the rocks remain 
### 
The room w,is small, the light was dim, books were
piled in a corner and the thick smoke of cigarettes lent an
eerie quality to our meeting. We were five people sitting
on the narrow bed, on two chairs and on the floor, four
young Romanians and myself, who could easily have
been their grandfather.
There was an uneasy silence at the beginning, which I
tried to dispel with a joke, which was not funny; the
boys, who were all in their twenties, looked first uneasily
at me, then grinned rather sheepishly.
"We do not mean to be rude, Sir," ventured the
oldest, "but we do not know you but by hearsay, and we
are so accustomed to be on our guard, that even here in
West Germany, which is a free country, we are in
stinctively on our defensive . . ."
"No apologies are needed," I replied evenly, "you
were all born and raised in a Communist country — yes, I
know what that means . . ." The one who seemed the
youngest looked sharply at me. "Do you, Sir, do you real
ly know what it means to be always regimented, fed with
lies, not allowed to do this, to say that, not to read what
you want, to tell on other people, not to be allowed to
talk to foreigners unless you repeat to the police what
they have told you . . . oh, my list could be endless, and
you would not understand . . ."
"No, I believe this man will really understand, other
wise why would he wish to talk to us?" interrupted the
young man sitting on the floor.
I looked around the room, saying "Having been
brainwashed all your life, I was afraid you would have
lost all sense of reality."
"Not so," replied the elder, "for did we not escape
from Romania? Don't you realize that more than 90 per
cent of our young people have only one thought in their
minds: to run away, to escape, to seek freedom, to build
a new life for themselves, not to be slaves any longer. . .
Here, look: Luca and Andrei jumped into the Danube
and swam all the way to Yugoslavia . . . lon and Dan
crossed the frontier into Hungary — just how, don't ask
me . .
There was a long silence, then I ventured a few ques
tions:
"Weren't you also influenc ed by current events in Po
land, didn't that encourage you?"
"Romanians are inadequately informed and what we
do read in our papers, or hear over the radio, is only
propaganda — as usual." Actually, they admitted, peo
ple are so worried by the hardships of their everyday
lives, that there is not much time left to bother about
their neighbors. "The economic situation is now the
worst in many years. It has reached a point, Sir, that meat,
fish, butter, sugar — even bread, are not to be found.
People have to spend several hours daily to line up for
everything "
"The reason for this catastrophic state of affairs," the
young man called Luca said, pounding the table, "is that
instead of developing our agriculture — for did you not
know that private farmers prodmed 25 percent of our
harvest, on only one tenth of the farmland? — they have
insanely industrialized the country The government

can't pay now for the machinery, hence we have to ex
port more and more to earn badly needed hard curren
cy, or go bankrupt. . . in spite ot the fact that over 50 per
cent of Romania's foreign trade is with Western coun
tries, compared to 35 percent with Communist coun
tries. Of course they tell us," he added, "that Romania
will reach economic and national sovereignty by 1990,
but no one believes them."
"Isn't this disproportion in investment policy going to
lead people eventually to revolt?" I asked him.
"Sure it does," he answered vehemently, "haven't you
heard that all this food shortage has set off loud workers'
protestations, the miners of the Jiu valley, for instance?"
"Indeed . .
"Well, they were imprisoned, beaten, their families
rlispersed . . . You do not know the power of Ceausescu's
secret police!"
"Talking of him," I ventured, "is it really true that his
personality cult has reached a degree which makes him
the most highly praised dictator in Eastern Europe?"
"You just wouldn't believe it," they roared with
laughter, "it borders on the absurd, like lonescu's
plays!"
"Seriously," Dan spoke up, "he may be a paranoic, but
he somehow put Romania back on the map with his trav
elling mania, which has brought him all over the world;
and we are sending hundreds of our experts to help un
derdeveloped countries, but all this charade doesn't
make our people happier, nor does it feed them."
"Do you really believe that Romania has a so-called in
dependent foreign policy?" was my next question.
The young men thought for a while, then one of them
answered: "Really independent, of course not, for how
would Moscow allow it? But," he added, "the Russians
have used us as middle men in a number of international
negotiations — in China, the United States, in Israel, for
instance — and Ceausescu has certainly allowed himself
a certain degree of independence in foreign affairs, just
so long as it does not interfere with the official Soviet
line."
They agreed with me that Ceausescu tried to imitate
Tito, whom he greatly admired, to make himself useful
economically and politically in the Third World. Mean
while, internally, they added, the Marxist-Leninist line is
harshly followed to counterbalance a certain independ
ence abroad. "Of course," lon cried out disgustedly,
"security has seldom been as tight as today, our country
is nothing but a vast prison of 22 million people, don't
ever forget it!"
"There is so much to talk about and only such a little
time left. . the oldest sighed, "for three of us have to
catch the last underground to our lodgings."
"Could we meet again?" I ventured, getting up. "Per
haps . . ." "Don't be so pessimistic ..." I smiled opening
the door.
Andrei jumped up: "Never!" he shouted "Just re
member our old peasant saying: 'The waves rush by, but
the rocks remain'!"

lies, not allowed to do this, to say that, not to read what
you want, to tell on other people, not to be allowed to
talk to foreigners unless you repeat to the police what
they have told you . . . oh, my list could be endless, and
you would not understand . . ."
"No, I believe this man will really understand, other
wise why would he wish to talk to us?" interrupted the
young man sitting on the floor.
I looked around the room, saying "Having been
brainwashed all your life, I was afraid you would have
lost all sense of reality."
"Not so," replied the elder, "for did we not escape
from Romania? Don't you realize that more than 90 per
cent of our young people have only one thought in their
minds: to run away, to escape, to seek freedom, to build
a new life for themselves, not to be slaves any longer. . .
Here, look: Luca and Andrei jumped into the Danube
and swam all the way to Yugoslavia . . . lon and Dan
crossed the frontier into Hungary — just how, don't ask
me . .
There was a long silence, then I ventured a few ques
tions:
"Weren't you also influenc ed by current events in Po
land, didn't that encourage you?"
"Romanians are inadequately informed and what we
do read in our papers, or hear over the radio, is only
propaganda — as usual." Actually, they admitted, peo
ple are so worried by the hardships of their everyday
lives, that there is not much time left to bother about
their neighbors. "The economic situation is now the
worst in many years. It has reached a point, Sir, that meat,
fish, butter, sugar — even bread, are not to be found.
People have to spend several hours daily to line up for
everything "
"The reason for this catastrophic state of affairs," the
young man called Luca said, pounding the table, "is that
instead of developing our agriculture — for did you not
know that private farmers prodmed 25 percent of our
harvest, on only one tenth of the farmland? — they have
insanely industrialized the country The government

can't pay now for the machinery, hence we have to ex
port more and more to earn badly needed hard curren
cy, or go bankrupt. . . in spite ot the fact that over 50 per
cent of Romania's foreign trade is with Western coun
tries, compared to 35 percent with Communist coun
tries. Of course they tell us," he added, "that Romania
will reach economic and national sovereignty by 1990,
but no one believes them."
"Isn't this disproportion in investment policy going to
lead people eventually to revolt?" I asked him.
"Sure it does," he answered vehemently, "haven't you
heard that all this food shortage has set off loud workers'
protestations, the miners of the Jiu valley, for instance?"
"Indeed . .
"Well, they were imprisoned, beaten, their families
rlispersed . . . You do not know the power of Ceausescu's
secret police!"
"Talking of him," I ventured, "is it really true that his
personality cult has reached a degree which makes him
the most highly praised dictator in Eastern Europe?"
"You just wouldn't believe it," they roared with
laughter, "it borders on the absurd, like lonescu's
plays!"
"Seriously," Dan spoke up, "he may be a paranoic, but
he somehow put Romania back on the map with his trav
elling mania, which has brought him all over the world;
and we are sending hundreds of our experts to help un
derdeveloped countries, but all this charade doesn't
make our people happier, nor does it feed them."
"Do you really believe that Romania has a so-called in
dependent foreign policy?" was my next question.
The young men thought for a while, then one of them
answered: "Really independent, of course not, for how
would Moscow allow it? But," he added, "the Russians
have used us as middle men in a number of international
negotiations — in China, the United States, in Israel, for
instance — and Ceausescu has certainly allowed himself
a certain degree of independence in foreign affairs, just
so long as it does not interfere with the official Soviet
line."
They agreed with me that Ceausescu tried to imitate
Tito, whom he greatly admired, to make himself useful
economically and politically in the Third World. Mean
while, internally, they added, the Marxist-Leninist line is
harshly followed to counterbalance a certain independ
ence abroad. "Of course," lon cried out disgustedly,
"security has seldom been as tight as today, our country
is nothing but a vast prison of 22 million people, don't
ever forget it!"
"There is so much to talk about and only such a little
time left. . the oldest sighed, "for three of us have to
catch the last underground to our lodgings."
"Could we meet again?" I ventured, getting up. "Per
haps . . ." "Don't be so pessimistic ..." I smiled opening
the door.
Andrei jumped up: "Never!" he shouted "Just re
member our old peasant saying: 'The waves rush by, but
the rocks remain'!"
(George Duca is a researcher at the Hoover Institution.)
The room w,is small, the light was dim, books were
piled in a corner and the thick smoke of cigarettes lent an
eerie quality to our meeting. We were five people sitting
on the narrow bed, on two chairs and on the floor, four
young Romanians and myself, who could easily have
been their grandfather.
There was an uneasy silence at the beginning, which I
tried to dispel with a joke, which was not funny; the
boys, who were all in their twenties, looked first uneasily
at me, then grinned rather sheepishly.
"We do not mean to be rude, Sir," ventured the
oldest, "but we do not know you but by hearsay, and we
are so accustomed to be on our guard, that even here in
West Germany, which is a free country, we are in
stinctively on our defensive . . ."
"No apologies are needed," I replied evenly, "you
were all born and raised in a Communist country — yes, I
know what that means . . ." The one who seemed the
youngest looked sharply at me. "Do you, Sir, do you real
ly know what it means to be always regimented, fed with
lies, not allowed to do this, to say that, not to read what
you want, to tell on other people, not to be allowed to
talk to foreigners unless you repeat to the police what
