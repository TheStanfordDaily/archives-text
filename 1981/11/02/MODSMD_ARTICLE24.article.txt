Hope on the road again
Comedian Bobe Hope gives a playtul squeeze of thanks to Alex Spanos after arriving
at Boeing Field for a six night stand at the Paramount Theatre. Hope, who trailed his
golf cluhs off the plane, also scheduled a series of benefit area appearances for the
Bob Hope International Heart Research Institute. Hope praised Seattle's clean air,
saying "I'm from L.A., where vou don't trust air you can't see."
