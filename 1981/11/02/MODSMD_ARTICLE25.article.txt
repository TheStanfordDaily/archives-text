# Apathy, helplessness mar races
## 
### Washington Post 
Detroit â€” Mayor Coleman Vrtung, who is up
for re-election tomorrow, came face to face with
his opponent for the first time in the campaign
last Thursday on the steps of a local library.
"Are you ready to debate?" asked Perry
Koslowski.
"I haven't got time for this," Young snorted.
"Get yourself a platform."
In Minneapolis Mayor Don Fraser has been
debating his four opponents regularly this fall,
but they haven't found much on the voters'
minds.
"The issues have not grabbed people," Fraser
said as he knocked on doors on a recent snowy
Saturday morning.
His 90-minute tour through one neighbor
hood bore out his comment. The longest dis
cussion he had that morning was about hard
ening of the arteries. "Our biggest opponent is
apathy," the mayor said.
Apathy is also an issue in Cleveland, where
Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican in a city
that is 6-to-1 Democratic, is trying to pretend he
is in a serious re-election contest tomorrow.
"As long as there are ballots to be counted, it's
a race," he dead-panned the other day in his
cavernous city hall office.
When the votes were counted in the non
partisan primary in September, Voinovich led
his Democratic opponent with 60 percent of the
vote.
In what may be the most stressful period in lo
cal government in decades, the elections in
these three cities reflect a puzzling public mood.
At a time when city services are being cut be
cause of federal and state budget reductions,
when recession has crippled local economies,
and when the Midwest continues to lose popu
lation to the Southwest and West, there is no de
bate going on over the future of these cities.
The incumbents, who ordinarily might be
considered vulnerable because of their consti
tuents' woes, are frontrunners and not just fron
trunners-they are lengths ahead and enormous
ly popular.
Voters in these cities not only appear satisfied
with the leadership they are getting, but also do

not hold their mayors responsible for what prob
lems exist. "If an individual is doing a halfway
decent job, he's a shoo-in," said Bob Hughes,
the Republican county chairman in Cleveland.
"I think people recognize how difficult it is to be
mayor of a large city."
Arthur Naftalin, the former mayor of Minne
apolis, put it somewhat differently. "People
don't think that any bold new change is going to
make a lot of difference," he said. "Challengers
are having trouble getting visibility. It's a time of
great confusion and perplexity for everyone."
There may be another reason for the lack of
interest in the elections this fall. So far, the feder
al and state budget cuts have been felt only by
city officials, who are struggling to make ends
meet. The people have yet to feel the pain.
As one person said in Minneapolis, "The ice
rinks haven't been flooded yet, so people don't
know which ones won't be flooded this year."
These cities all have serious problems. Cleve
land has struggled out of bankruptcy but faces
continued population loss and deteriorating
services. Detroit, with 14.1 percent of its work
force unemployed and the automobile industry
still in a recession, is struggling to keep its
budget in balance, even though a sharp tax in
crease was approved by voters last June. Minne
apolis, the healthiest ot the three cities, faces a
reduction in services because of a state budg
etary crisis and further cuts in the federal
budget.
Minnesota faces a new deficit that could go as
high as $1 billion. Michigan's three-week-old
budget just underwent a $270 million cut be
cause of the recession in the automobile in
dustry. Ohio is operating on an interim budget
and expects to spend 10 percent less than last
year.
Fraser told a neighborhood group last Mon
day that the city "would be devastated" by the
state's newest fiscal crisis.
Young said in an interview Thursday that De
troit has few options left for handling its financial
problems. "At some point you run out of fat, and
you're dealing with muscle and gristle and final
ly bone," he said. "And we're down there."
