## Controller training lessened 
### Los Angeles Times 
Oklahoma City, Okla. —
Radar instruction has been
dropped from the basic train
ing of air traffic controllers at
the Federal Aviation Adminis
tration academy here. Extra in
structors have been hired to
handle a huge influx of new
students.
Classes run from 7 a.m. to
midnight so that the flow of
new controllers to under
staffed control towers and traf
fir centers around the country
can be speeded up.
Time is the biggest obstacle
for the Reagan administration's
plan to hire and train 6000 new
controllers a year as permanent
replacements for fired Pro
fessional Air Traffic Controllers
Organization strikers. The
strikers account for 65 percent
of the journeymen in the pre
strike controller force.
Training newcomers as fully
certified controllers takes two
to five year:. under the best cir
cumstances, according to FAA
figures, and the sense of urgen
cy is apparent everywhere at
the FAA academy because of
the administration's an
nounced strategy to restore
normal air service by the sum
mer of 1983. In some quarters,
that time table is regarded with
skepticism.
A staff report issued by the
Flouse Post Office and Civil
Service Committee after hear
ings this month concluded that
the new controllers will not
have the experience required
to meet the administration's
goal without rehiring "a sub
stantial number" of the 11,500
fired strikers — an alternative

deemed unacceptable by ev
eryone in the chain of com
mand, from President Ronald
Reagan to FAA chief Lynn
Helms.
In testimony before Con
gress, Helms also pledged that
the training of new controllers
will not be hurried or curtailed
to help the administration
meet the goal. Instead, the
academy has been mobilized
to handle an influx of new stu
dents.
Since August, enrollment
has swelled from 93 trainees to
1208, including a class of 288
that began training Monday.
!3y mid-December, 1700 new
controllers are expected to be
on hand.
Recently retired controllers
have been asked back and
trained as temporary instruc
tors, while work crews are busy
building more classrooms and
training labs.
Controllers complete the
academy course in 12 or 15
weeks, depending on their
eventual assignments, but are
barely qualified on graduation.
Their experience here is lim
ited to mastering theory and
training in simulators. The ex
perience they will need to be
certified as full-fledged con
trollers is picked up in on-the
job training where they learn
to handle live traffic.
The heart of the academy
course is a battery of simulator
exercises, on which a passing
grade is 70 percent. The tests
are designed to screen out
trainees who lack the critical
talent for "seeing traffic," the
FAA term for the ability to sit in
a closed room and visualize,

then manipulate, a large cube
of sky filled with imaginary air
lanes and speeding planes.
Some students master the
procedures and rules but can
not mentally juggle altitude,
distance, time and aircraft
speeds well enough to direct
an orderly flow of traffic and
avoid accidents. Academy Su
perintendent Edwin Harris,
who is not a controller, com
pares it to knowing how to play
golf but not actually being able
to put the golf ball in the hole.
Weeding out those without
the knack is probably the
academy's biggest job. Vir
tually all of the fledgling con
trollers breeze through the
theory and written part of the
course — covering weather,
aviation science, FAA rules,
and the idiosyncrasies of vari
ous aircraft — but 25 percent,
on the average, flunk out in the
simulations. In some classes,
the washout rate is 40 percent,
and the FAA says the average
for students with no previous
controller experience is about
35 percent.
Simulations are conducted
in labs equipped with tape rec
orders that record each stu
dent's instructions on radio
hookups to other students pos
ing as pilots, and maps of a fic
tional chunk of air. Six graded
exercises determine if a trainee
passes.
Controllers who will be as
signed to one of the 22 FAA
traffic centers, which control
aircraft over large regions and
were hardest hit by the strike,
must show that they can keep
planes from violating legal sep
aration limits. Planes generally

fly 20 miles apart with 10
minutes flight time separating
them from other traffic ahead
or behind them at the same
altitude.
The controllers destined for
airport control towers spend
three weeks longer at the
academy and must demon
strate the ability to work under
conditions that simulate a
moderately busy tower.
No sudden emergencies or
near misses are written into the
simulator scripts to complicate
the situations or to test the con
trollers' instincts in a crisis.
The course is designed as a
crash program, with eight
hour days and a tightly regu-.
lated schedule to weed out
slow learners. A student gets
one try and if he fails, he loses
his job.
Six weeks of radar training
that used to complete the
course were dropped from the
curriculum this month so that
graduating controllers can be
assigned to field jobs sooner.
But academy officials say the
change will not seriously affect
skills and does not violate
Helms' promise to leave the
training cycle intact.
The academy's graduates
spend two years in on-the-job
training before they begin
working on radar scopes even
as trainees, and they will be
sent back to the academy for
the six weeks of radar training
then, said Larry Ruby, chief of
the radar section.

radar training was in the wrong

job training where they learn
to handle live traffic.
The heart of the academy
course is a battery of simulator
exercises, on which a passing
grade is 70 percent. The tests
are designed to screen out
trainees who lack the critical
talent for "seeing traffic," the
FAA term for the ability to sit in
a closed room and visualize,

then manipulate, a large cube
of sky filled with imaginary air
lanes and speeding planes.
Some students master the
procedures and rules but can
not mentally juggle altitude,
distance, time and aircraft
speeds well enough to direct
an orderly flow of traffic and
avoid accidents. Academy Su
perintendent Edwin Harris,
who is not a controller, com
pares it to knowing how to play
golf but not actually being able
to put the golf ball in the hole.
Weeding out those without
the knack is probably the
academy's biggest job. Vir
tually all of the fledgling con
trollers breeze through the
theory and written part of the
course — covering weather,
aviation science, FAA rules,
and the idiosyncrasies of vari
ous aircraft — but 25 percent,
on the average, flunk out in the
simulations. In some classes,
the washout rate is 40 percent,
and the FAA says the average
for students with no previous
controller experience is about
35 percent.
Simulations are conducted
in labs equipped with tape rec
orders that record each stu
dent's instructions on radio
hookups to other students pos
ing as pilots, and maps of a fic
tional chunk of air. Six graded
exercises determine if a trainee
passes.
Controllers who will be as
signed to one of the 22 FAA
traffic centers, which control
aircraft over large regions and
were hardest hit by the strike,
must show that they can keep
planes from violating legal sep
aration limits. Planes generally

fly 20 miles apart with 10
minutes flight time separating
them from other traffic ahead
or behind them at the same
altitude.
The controllers destined for
airport control towers spend
three weeks longer at the
academy and must demon
strate the ability to work under
conditions that simulate a
moderately busy tower.
No sudden emergencies or
near misses are written into the
simulator scripts to complicate
the situations or to test the con
trollers' instincts in a crisis.
The course is designed as a
crash program, with eight
hour days and a tightly regu-.
lated schedule to weed out
slow learners. A student gets
one try and if he fails, he loses
his job.
Six weeks of radar training
that used to complete the
course were dropped from the
curriculum this month so that
graduating controllers can be
assigned to field jobs sooner.
But academy officials say the
change will not seriously affect
skills and does not violate
Helms' promise to leave the
training cycle intact.
The academy's graduates
spend two years in on-the-job
training before they begin
working on radar scopes even
as trainees, and they will be
sent back to the academy for
the six weeks of radar training
then, said Larry Ruby, chief of
the radar section.
"We always kind of felt the
radar training was in the wrong
place in the program," Ruby
said.
Oklahoma City, Okla. —
Radar instruction has been
dropped from the basic train
ing of air traffic controllers at
the Federal Aviation Adminis
tration academy here. Extra in
structors have been hired to
handle a huge influx of new
students.
Classes run from 7 a.m. to
midnight so that the flow of
new controllers to under
staffed control towers and traf
fir centers around the country
can be speeded up.
Time is the biggest obstacle
for the Reagan administration's
plan to hire and train 6000 new
controllers a year as permanent
replacements for fired Pro
fessional Air Traffic Controllers
Organization strikers. The
strikers account for 65 percent
of the journeymen in the pre
strike controller force.
Training newcomers as fully
certified controllers takes two
to five year:. under the best cir
cumstances, according to FAA
figures, and the sense of urgen
cy is apparent everywhere at
the FAA academy because of
the administration's an
nounced strategy to restore
normal air service by the sum
mer of 1983. In some quarters,
that time table is regarded with
skepticism.
A staff report issued by the
Flouse Post Office and Civil
Service Committee after hear
ings this month concluded that
the new controllers will not
have the experience required
to meet the administration's
goal without rehiring "a sub
stantial number" of the 11,500
fired strikers — an alternative

deemed unacceptable by ev
eryone in the chain of com
mand, from President Ronald
Reagan to FAA chief Lynn
Helms.
In testimony before Con
gress, Helms also pledged that
the training of new controllers
will not be hurried or curtailed
to help the administration
meet the goal. Instead, the
academy has been mobilized
to handle an influx of new stu
dents.
Since August, enrollment
has swelled from 93 trainees to
1208, including a class of 288
that began training Monday.
!3y mid-December, 1700 new
controllers are expected to be
on hand.
Recently retired controllers
have been asked back and
trained as temporary instruc
tors, while work crews are busy
building more classrooms and
training labs.
Controllers complete the
academy course in 12 or 15
weeks, depending on their
eventual assignments, but are
barely qualified on graduation.
Their experience here is lim
ited to mastering theory and
training in simulators. The ex
perience they will need to be
certified as full-fledged con
trollers is picked up in on-the
job training where they learn
to handle live traffic.
