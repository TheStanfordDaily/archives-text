# Methodists taking a liberal track
## 
### los Angeles Times 
The National Council of Churches nor
mally takes care to pass the mantle of lead
ership around to men and women, clergy
and laity, and otherwise reflect its ethnic,
geographical and religious diversity.
Nevertheless, its next top twoelectedof
ficials will coincidentally be male Method
ist bishops who were fellow pastors in Indi
anapolis during the issue-oriented 19605.
Nominated as president — and ex
pected to be elected along with the rest of
the Council's nominating committee slate
next Wednesday in Cleveland — is Bishop
James Armstrong, of the United Methodist
Church's Indiana area.
Expected to be elected first vice presi
dent is Bishop James Cummings, now the
Los Angeles-based bishop for the Christian
Methodist Episcopal Church's Ninth Dis
trict.
True, Armstrong is a white bishop of the
largely white United Methodists, the larg
est Council member at 9.6 million mem
bers. And Cummings is a black bishop in
the black CME, as the 870,000-member de
nomination is commonly referred to.
The formative.pastoral roots and current

concerns of Armstrong and Cummings
may signal the approach the National
Council of Churches will take by necessity
to try to regain some influence in the 1980s
for a relatively liberal Christian outlook.
Armstrong denounced the Rev. Jerry
Falwell and his Moral Majority in a letter
last month to 1500 United Methodist min
isters in Indiana. Armstrong termed the
movement a return to a "tired and dis
credited 'America Firsv' ideolo^'y-"
Regarding Fallwell's allegedly milita
ristic stance, the bishop asked in remarks
reported in religious circles: "Who ex
punged Isaiah 9 and the Sermon on the
Mount from Jerry Falwell's Bible?" the
bishop asked. "Where is the Prince of
Peace in his thought? And the bit about
loving your enemies and overcoming evil
with good?"
In a recent interview, Cummings similar
ly contrasted the "prophetic" stances of
the National Council with the Moral Ma
jority's claims to speak for historic Judeo-
Christian principles in America.
"None of the Old Testament prophets
were in the majority," Cummings said.
The Moral Majority, Cummings

charged, is not going to speak out against
the squandering of natural resources, the
activities of the Ku Klux Klan or nuclear
arms proliferation.
"They're not concerned with what hap
pens to our cities because for the most part
they live in rural and suburban parts of the
land," Cummings said.
"I'm with them on abortion but any in
telligent black American views with alarm
iV-ie pro-U(e e((ott to amend ihe Constilu
tion," he said, referring to fears that estab
lished constitutional rights enjoyed by mi
norities might be seen as ripe for elimina
tion.
Some analysts of the contemporary re
ligious scene have suggested that the
mainline churches may be able to redefine
who they are better in the 198CK by point
ing to what they are not — the widely dis
cussed new Christian Right.
Armstrong, as president of the Council
for the next three years, would command
more attention than Cummings because of
the latter's role as first vice president. But
Cummings said he hopes to be active —
"because of my relationship to the (Coun
cil) president. We think very much alike."
