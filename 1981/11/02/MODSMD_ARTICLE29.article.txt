## Stanford slides to 1-7 Cardinals downed by Washington Huskies 42-31 
### Steve Odell 
Seattle — It was a grand day for football
at Husky Stadium. The sky was clear, the
temperature was in the 60s, and it was
Homecoming to boot.
But, as Stanford found out Saturday, it
doesn't rain in Seattle, it pours. And it was
the Huskies who were doing the pouring it
on as they defeated the Cardinals, 42-31.
Overshadowing a brilliant four-touch
down performance by Darrin Nelson, the
Huskies supplied their own lightning,
breaking open a tight 14-7 game with 28
points in a span of 3:09 during the third
quarter.
"I think the whole game was decided in
those three minutes," said Stanford quar
terback John Elway. "It gives us a feeling
like we gave it away."
There was good reason for his senti
ment.
Stanford was only too glad to provide
the thunder, making a number of key mis
takes during the agonizing span of an egg
timer. When the eggs were done, so were
the Cards, and Washington was well on the
way to its seventh win in eight games.
The breakdown was somewhat typical of
the entire Stanford season. The Cards, now
1-7, have yet to put together four solid
quarters of football. Saturday, it was the
special teams leading the self-destruction.
Specifically, the Halloween nightmare
went something like thic: the Huskies
blocked a Greg Topp punt and took over at
the Stanford 20, marking the third straight
week Washington has done so. Four plays
later, tailback Ron Jackson took a pitch
from UW quarterback Steve Pelleur and
ran four yards for the score with 5:40 re
maining in the third quarter. 21-7, Huskies.
After the ensuing kick-off, Vincent
White fumbled on first down, and the
Huskies recovered at the Stanford 15. This
time it took the Washington offense just
three plays to get in the end zone, Sterling
Hinds breaking free from the three-yard
line. 28-7, Huskies.
Again on first down after the transition, a
poorly-thrown John Elway pass intended
for Nelson ended up in the hands of inside
linebacker Mark Jerue. Elway tackled him
on the four after a 23-yard return, and
Pelleur promptly threw a touchdown pass
to tight-end Willie Rosborough on the
next play from scrimmage. 35-7, Huskies.
Stanford got a first down on the next
posession before being forced to punt.

Topp got the ball off without a hitch this
time, but tailback Anthony Allen returned
it 71 yards for yet another Washington
score. 42-7, Huskies, with 2:34 left in the
third quarter. The giant motorized helmet
with the "W" on it which takes a lap
around the stadium for every Husky score
was overheating. The gulls were flocking
in from the bay like vultures searching for
remains. And the Cards were sufficiently
devastated.
"I couldn't believe it was really happen
ing," said Nelson, who showed why he is
considered an astroturf runner, running
for 154 yards and catching passes for 136
more. "It really gets tiresome to keep put
ting ourselves in the situation where we
always have to come back."
It looked for awhile, however, that the
Cards were going to get to look back rath
er than have to try and come back, scoring
on their very first possession for the sec
ond week in a row. After the Huskies' first
drive stalled, Washington kicker Jeff
Partridge dropped the punt snap and got
off only a nine-yarder.
Pressured by safety Vaughn Williams
and defensive back Mike Taylor, Partridge
had to kick the ball on the run with his left
foot and the Cardinals assumed posession
at midfield.
Elway and Nelson took over at that
point, supplying most of the impetus for
the scoring drive which took just 2:46 and
eight plays. Nelson broke through a hole
off left guard and gained 16 yards on a sec
ond down. Elway bootlegged for 7 yards
and Nelson 8 more on a sweep right to
keep the drive alive.
Then, after an incomplete pass in the
end zone, Elway threw a swing pass to
Nelson in the left flat and the fleet-footed
halfback sprinted down the sidelines for 19
yards. One play later, Nelson scored the
first of his four touchdowns on the day,
going over from the one to give Stanford a
quick 7-0 lead. Little did he, or the rest of
his teammates know, it would be 42 points
before they scored again.
But there were a few bright spots in be
tween. Stanford put on a spirited goal line
stand, the first in recent memory, stopping
the Huskies four straight plays at the one
yardline after an 80-vard drive by Washing
ton.
Such an effort might have inspired the
Cards onto similar achievements. Wash

ington however, as well as Stanford, made
sure they would be few and far between.
After the superb defensive stand Nelson
scampered 24 yards to get the Cards out of
the hole on third and 10 at the three. But
White fumbled after a shot from line
backer Ken Driscoll one play later, and the
Huskies' Chris O'Connor fell on the ball at
the visitors' 40.
The defense held steadfast allowing only
seven yards on three plays, but then UW
picked up 32 yards on a fake field goal try.
Husky place kicker Chuck Nelson came on
presumably to attempt a 50-yarder. But af
ter a Washington time-out, the snap went
directly to Nelson instead of holder
Pelleur, and the former high school quar
terback took it through a gaping hole on
the left side of an overshifted Stanford de
fense. The next play, fullback Chris James
went over the top for a touchdown to tie
the score at7-7withl2:lB remaining in the
first half.
Washington put together another
touchdown drive, its only one without
considerable help from Stanford, moving
70 yards in 5:01. James consummated the
drive with another one-yard plunge to
give the Huskies a 14-7 lead at halftime.
After the game had for all intents and
purposes been decided, Stanford rallied
for 24 points in the fourth period to make
the final score respectable. Nelson was pri
marily responsible as he continued in an
excellent performance, scoring on runs of
two and 22-yards, as well as on a 19-yard TD
pass-reception from Elway.
It might have made a difference had it
not been for a Husky cloudburst on a
cloudless day.
NOTES The Stanford players wore a
small black cross on the back of their
helmets just above the numbers in memo
ry of teammate Kevin MacMillan, who was
killed in a tragic car crash early Friday
morning. The players learned of the death
shortly before they left for Seattle Friday
. . . The statistics favored Stanford con
siderably, as they outgained the Huskies by
nearly 200 yards, but a lot of it was picked
up against a prevent defense in the fourth
quarter. And the four turnovers didn't
help either . . . Gary Wimmer had an out
standing game at the inside linebacker
position, taking over for an injured Dave
Morze. Wimmer made 25 tackles, 16 in the
first half alone.
