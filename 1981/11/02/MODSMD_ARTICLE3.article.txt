# Pregnancy reports double over 5 years

The number of unplanned
pregnancies reported each year to
Cowell Student Health Center
almost doubled, from 63 to 119,
between 1975 and 1980. Counsel
ors at the health center say they
are alarmed by the increase and
that they may have to find new
ways to educate students about
the availably and use of con
traceptives.
The problem appears to be re
lated to changing patterns in con
traception use. Recent media cov
erage concerning possible haz
ards of such birth control methods
as the Pill and the lUD (In
trauterine Device) have dis
couraged their use, according to a
study by Dr. John Dorman of
Cowell.
Instead, women are turning to
the diaphragm in greater and
greater numbers.
"Use of the diaphragm con
tinues to rise and is paralleled by
an increase in unplanned preg
nancies," Dorman's report states.
But the report also cites a study in
which the diaphragm had a use
effectiveness of 98.1 percent.

One Cowell contraceptive
counselor attrributed the Univer
sity's high rateof unplanned preg
nancies to lack of knowledge on
proper diaphragm use. As a result,
Cowell will now issue
diaphragams only to those wom
en who attend one of two Thurs
day classes on diaphragm use.
Cowell is taking other steps to
combat the rise of unplanned
pregnancies. The contraceptive
counselors, who represent a vol
unteer group of 10 active staff
members and five outreach mem
bers, meet with students seeking
advice on a confidential basis
Mondays through Fridays. They
also staff a phone line. Currently,
the counselors are visiting campus
dormitories in art effort to
heighten awareness.
"We're especially trying to
reach freshmen, because we're
trying to educate people as soon
as possible," said one counselor.
But if dorm visits and phone
counseling don't help curb un
planned pregnancies, the coun
selors have suggested instituting
one of three plans: a fee
