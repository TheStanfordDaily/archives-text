# Poloists triumph at Long Beach tourney
## 
### Chris Addington 
"This tournament is typical of the entire year,"
or so commented Stanford water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti about this weekend's PCAA Pa
cific-10 tournament held at the Belmont Plaza in
Long Beach, California.
However, what is typical for the Stanford polo
team would be considered an unreachable goal by
almost any other team in the country. Stanford
stretched its record to 24-0, defeating three of the
top five teams in the country in the process.
"The players just did what they had to do,"
added Dettamanti, and when the Cardinal
aquamen have something to do, they do it with
quickness, skill, speed and machine-like precision.
Stanford started out playing No. 3 UC Irvine Fri
day morning, and the Cardinals dealt with the Ant
eaters in a much different fashion than the last time
the two teams met, a narrow Stanford victory. The
Cards jumped to a 7-1 lead early in the match and
then coasted to a 10-7 victory.
Stanford's most feared opponent for the tour

nament was No. 2 Long Beach State, but that after
noon's match against the 49ers was almost an ins
tant replay of the Irvine game. The Cardinals
blasted to an early lead before the 49ers made it a
respectable final score of 10-8.
Saturday's games were even easier than those of
the day before. Stanford chose a different game
plan against the definitely deficient Pepperdine
Waves. Everyone played, with the substitutes com
ing in as early as the first quarter. The final score
against the Waves found Stanford on top 12-8.
The 1979 NCAA Championship Gauchos of San
ta Barbara gave a good account of themselves, but
they too suffered the similar of the rest of the
PCAA. Stanford led by five goals early in the game
and maintained that margin for a final score of
14-9.
Stanford was the only undefeated team in the
cross-conference tourney. Long Beach State was
second, followed by a tie tor third between Irvine
and Santa Barbara. Rounding out the field was
UCLA, Berkeley, USC,and Pepperdine.

Coach Dettamanti was, for the most part,
pleased with the play of his squad. "We had really
good first half play, but from that point we had
trouble maintaining the intensity," he said. "We
have to learn to put teams away and not let them
creep back into the game during the last quarter.
We should hold every team in the country to un
der six goals," he added.
But then again, everyone knows it'sa coach's job
to critique, and it appears Dettamanti is genuinely
pleased with his team's play. Who wouldn't be
with a team that's only been behind twice in 24
games, and then only by one goal.
Stanford prides itself on a diversified offense
with everyone being able to score, but two players
shined above the group this weekend.
Junior James Bergeson, with his lightning shots
from the drive and the 6-on-5, appears to be emer
ging as the offensive leader. He was Stanford's
leading scorer in the tourney with 14 goals, and is
also Stanford's leading overall scorer with 56.
