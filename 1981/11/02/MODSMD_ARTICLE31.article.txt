# 49ers slip by Steelers, Raiders over Pats
## 
### 
Pittsburgh (AP) — Quarter
back Joe Montana of the San
Francisco 49ers survived two
costly interceptions, while his
defensive teammates forced six
turnovers against the Pit
tsburgh Steelers to register a
17-14 victory yesterday.
Montana rallied the 49ers to
their sixth straight National
Football League win, engineer
ing a 43-yard drive capped by
Walt Easley's one-yard touch
down run with 5:35 to play.
"He's a tremendously re
sourceful quarterback. When
he makes a mistake, he doesn't
get too upset. He played
brilliantly," said 49er Coach Bill
Walsh.
Cornerback Mel Blount re
turned Montana's first in
terception 50 yards for a score,
and linebacker Jack Lambert
picked off another pass one
series later to set up Pit
tsburgh's second touchdown.
But Montana, who had a team
record 122 passing attempts
without throwing an intercep
tion, brought the 49ers back.
"That shows the maturity of
thisteam. It's a young team, but
nobody let down," said Mon
tana. "We were moving the
ball. I think we just felt that
sooner or later we were going
to get it in the end zone."
Meanwhile, turnovers
plagued Pittsburgh.
"We just killed ourselves
with the turnovers," said
Coach Chuck Noll.
"Mistakes, mistakes, mis

takes," moaned quarterback
Terry Bradshaw after he threw
three interceptions.
"You just want to take a ham
mer and pound your head in.
It's just so frustrating. You'd
like to go someplace and hide,
but there's no place to go," he
added.
Pittsburgh mounted one
final drive, which came down
to a third-and-one play at the
San Francisco 34-yard line with
two minutes to go.
But a 49er blitz forced a two
yard loss on a pass completion,
and Bradshaw's fourth-down
pass was incomplete.
"We knew it was on us. The
offense was having problems,"
said rookie defensive back
Carlton Williamson, who re
covered a fumble and in
tercepted the pass that set up
San Francisco's game-winning
drive.
San Francisco, atop the Na
tional Conference West with a
7-2 record, converted two
Steeler turnovers into 10 points
within a 29-second span late in
the first half.
The 49ers overcame a hold
ing penalty during their win
ning drive, which began after
Bradshaw's fourth intercep
tion. Montana, who played his
high school football 30 miles
south of Pittsburgh before star
ring at Notre Dame, completed
a 23-yard pass to Freddie
Solomon and later scrambled
eight yards to pick a key first
down that kept the drive going.

Pittsburgh had two first-half
drives stalled by mistakes.
Franco Harris, who gained
104 yards on 17 carries and
topped the 100-yard mark for
the 38th game in his career,
fumbled at the San Francisco 21
in the first quarter. Wright re
covered for the 49ers.
In the second period,
Dwight Hicks picked off a
Bradshaw pass at the San Fran
cisco 9-yard line.
Trailing 10-0, the Pittsburgh
defense came to life. With de
fensive lineman Tom Beasley
applying pressure, Montana
hurried a sideline throw.
Blount stepped in front of
Dwight Clark and had a clear
path to the end zone with his
49th career interception.
On San Francisco's next
possession. Lambert picked off
a pass intended for running
back Paul Hofer to set up Brad
shaw's touchdown pass.
The 49ers came back with a
69-yard drive that stalled on the
Steeler 20-yard line. But
Beasley blocked Wersching's
32-yard field goal attempt to
end the threat.
Oakland (A P) — Marc
Wilson and Cliff Branch, who
had an 80-yard touchdown
nullified by a penalty on the
first play of the game, com
bined on a 14-yard scoring pass
in the final period, propelling
the Oakland Raiders to a 27-17
National Football League vic
tory over the New England Pa

triots.
Branch's touchdown catch,
in the left corner of the end
zone with eight minutes re
maining, gave the Raiders their
first second-half touchdown in
six weeks and wiped out a 17-13
New England lead.
With 1:22 left, Cedrick Hard
man sacked Patriots quarter
back Steve Grogan, forcing a
fumble. Defensive end Willie

Jones grabbed the loose ball
and ran nine yards for a touch
down that clinched the victory,
one which gave the Raiders a
4-5 record.
New England, 2-7, trailed
13-10 at halftime but drove 75
yards to open the second half
and went ahead on Sam Cun
ningham's one-yard touch
down run. Grogan completed
a 44-yard pass on the drive and
also turned receiver himself,
gaining 11 yards on flea-flicker
play pass from Andy Johnson.
Chris Bahr kicked field goals
of 51 and 26 yards for Oakland
in the first half and Mark van
Eeghen, seeing his first ball
carrying duties in six weeks,
had a three-yard touchdown
run.
Grogan threw a 19-yard
touchdown pass to Don
Hasselbeck and John Smith
kicked a 38-yard field goal for
the Patriots.
Grogan was sacked five
times, with the last one, by
Hardman, proving to be the
most important for Oakland.
• But early in the second half,
when Wilson was intercepted

for the only time of the day, a
sack by Raiders defensive end
Dave Browning helped push
New England out of field goal
range. Roland James' intercep
tion gave the Patriots
possession at the Raiders' 29-
yard line.
Wilson, making his third start
as successor to benched Super
Bowl hero Jim Plunkett, had
been intercepted a total of sev
en times in the two previous
weeks. He hit on 22 of 36 passes
for 283 yards against New Eng
land.
The Raiders drove 54 yards
for their go-ahead touchdown
in the fourth quarter. Van
Eeghen ran 11 yards on the first
play of the drive and Wilson
followed with three straight
pass completions.

The touchdown pass was on
a second-and-nine play, with
Branch getting far behind de
fender James.
Kenny King had the Raiders'
first 100-yard rushing day of the
season, totaing 102 yards on 17
carries.

Pittsburgh (AP) — Quarter
back Joe Montana of the San
Francisco 49ers survived two
costly interceptions, while his
defensive teammates forced six
turnovers against the Pit
tsburgh Steelers to register a
17-14 victory yesterday.
Montana rallied the 49ers to
their sixth straight National
Football League win, engineer
ing a 43-yard drive capped by
Walt Easley's one-yard touch
down run with 5:35 to play.
"He's a tremendously re
sourceful quarterback. When
he makes a mistake, he doesn't
get too upset. He played
brilliantly," said 49er Coach Bill
Walsh.
Cornerback Mel Blount re
turned Montana's first in
terception 50 yards for a score,
and linebacker Jack Lambert
picked off another pass one
series later to set up Pit
tsburgh's second touchdown.
But Montana, who had a team
record 122 passing attempts
without throwing an intercep
tion, brought the 49ers back.
"That shows the maturity of
thisteam. It's a young team, but
nobody let down," said Mon
tana. "We were moving the
ball. I think we just felt that
sooner or later we were going
to get it in the end zone."
Meanwhile, turnovers
plagued Pittsburgh.
"We just killed ourselves
with the turnovers," said
Coach Chuck Noll.
"Mistakes, mistakes, mis

takes," moaned quarterback
Terry Bradshaw after he threw
three interceptions.
"You just want to take a ham
mer and pound your head in.
It's just so frustrating. You'd
like to go someplace and hide,
but there's no place to go," he
added.
Pittsburgh mounted one
final drive, which came down
to a third-and-one play at the
San Francisco 34-yard line with
two minutes to go.
But a 49er blitz forced a two

and Bradshaw's fourth-down
pass was incomplete.
"We knew it was on us. The

tercepted the pass that set up
San Francisco's game-winning
drive.
San Francisco, atop the Na

Steeler turnovers into 10 points
within a 29-second span late in

ning drive, which began after
Bradshaw's fourth intercep

high school football 30 miles
south of Pittsburgh before star
ring at Notre Dame, completed
a 23-yard pass to Freddie
Solomon and later scrambled
eight yards to pick a key first
down that kept the drive going.

Pittsburgh had two first-half
drives stalled by mistakes.
Franco Harris, who gained
104 yards on 17 carries and
topped the 100-yard mark for
the 38th game in his career,

In the second period,
Dwight Hicks picked off a
Bradshaw pass at the San Fran
