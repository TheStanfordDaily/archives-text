# Come off win over SJS
## Spikers face USF 
### Lisa Stern 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team will set into action
tomorrow night on the road as
they travel to the city to take on
conference rival University of
San Francisco at 7:30 p.m.
The Cards, who are coming
off a decisive 15-9, 15-7, and
15-8 victory over the San Jose
State Spartans last Thursday
night on their home court in
Maples Pavilion, will be look
ing for their fifth straight win.
The spikers last met USF at
home on Oct. 8 as Stanford
prevailed in three straight
games.
The Cardinals, who have
won six of their last seven
matches, are now 21-9 on the
season and 5-1 in NorCal Con
ference play.
Their opponents in tomor
row night's game are currently
in the league cellar, failing to
win a single match against any
conference teams. The USF
squad is 10-12 on the year thus
far.
Stanford head coach Fred
Sturm, pleased with his squad's
consistency against San Jose
State last week, rested the team
this past weekend. At practice
sessions this week he plans to

emphasize the recognition of
developing situations in prepa
ration for USF.
"We are starting to make the
most of situations where our
opponent's performance is up
and down," he explained. "I
can see, as a coach, the im
provement we've made, even
though this consistency is not
really reflected in our match
scores."
Sturm said that he believes
that his team should do well
against USF. He noted that the
San Francisco record reflects
their need to develop further
cohesiveness in the volleyball
program at the university.
"USF's (program) is about
three or four years behind that
of most conference teams.
While they are making some
progress, they lack both the re
cruiting and the athletic de
partment support needed to
build a competitive team,"
Sturm stated.
The Cardinals will rely on the
leadership of senior jan Linden
and the developing talent of
sophomore middle blocker
Bobbi Broer in tomorrow
night's match-up. Both players
have come on as strong con
tributors for Stanford in its past
four matches.
Sturm hopes to gain momen
tum in the USF match as the
Card spikers return home for a
Wednesday night meeting with
the University of California's

Berkeley Bears at 7:30 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. The squad
then leaves for Los Angeles
Thursday for the UCLA Invita
tional volleyball tournament.
The weekend event will fea
ture competition between 19
of the nation's 20 top-rated

teams. Stanford will probably
face league rival University of
the Pacific, now 6-0 in NorCal
play.
"We're making good
progress at learning how to
play well against opponents
who score well and play good

defense," Sturm concluded.
"And we hope to generate
enough momentum in the USF
match to carry us through this
busy and important week."
