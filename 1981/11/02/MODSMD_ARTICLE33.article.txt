# Cal Bears frustrate booters 2-1

### Adam Berns 
Frustration. There is no other word to
adequately describe Saturday's soccer
game against UC-Berkeley. Before a large
crowd at Harry Maloney Field, the
Cardinals lost to the Bears by a score of 2-1.
From start to finish it was a game totally
dominated by Stanfoid. In the entire first
half, Stanford had nine shots on goal as
compared to one for Cal. The Card domi
nance in the second half was even more
impressive, for the Bears rarely got into
Stanford territory.
The game started out with Berkeley con
trolling the ball for the first few minutes,
but after that, it was all Stanford. In the first
half, the Cardinals had nine corner kicks
and numerous other scoring op
portunities. Unfortunately, they weren't
able to convert their deep penetration into
any points, and the half ended with neither
team able to score.
The Cardinals scored first in the second
half when senior striker Ted Rafalovich
made a nice pass from the left sideline to
the middle of the field. Striker Willie Guic
ci took the pass near the Bear goal and

booted it past the chaiging Bear goalie.
Unfortunately, later in the half, Cal got a
penalty kick when a Bear was pushed near
the Stanford goal. Sophmore Cal goalie
Henry Foulk came up to take th â–  kick
which he easily made, tying the score at
one.
With time running out, Stanford made a
late rally, really applying pressure but fail
ing to score. A questionable call by the ref
eree occurred when with time running
out, freshman midfielder Angel Vasquez
broke free near the Cal goal only to be
tripped in the penalty area. Cardinal fans
assumed he would get a penalty shot but
instead the referee called obstruction,
which only amounted to an indirect kick.
The Cardinals failed to convert and the
game went into overtime.
Stanford once again came close on nu
merous occassions, but the period ended
scoreless, and the game went into a double
overtime.
In the second overtime period, the
Cardinals again pressured Cal and were
clearly dominating the action. However a
very physical Bear defense stiffened up ev

ery time Stanford got near the goal. What
made it even more frustrating for the
Cardinals was that the referee consistently
ignored fouls that his linesmen were call
ing. Eventually, the refereedid call a penal
ty, only this time it was on a Cardinal de
fender in the penalty area. Foulk again
came up to make the penalty kick to give
Cal a 2-1 victory.
After the game it was obvious that Lodge
and the rest of the players were extremely
disappointed in their performance.
Sophmore striker Jorge Titinger ex
pressed his frustration. "Offensively they
couldn't hold us. Unfortunately we
weren't able to score as many points as we
should have. Also, although it's obviously
no excuse for losing, the referee today
seemed awfully biased."
Although head coach Nelson Lodge was
also unhappy with the officiating, he re
fused to offer it as an excuse for losing.
"We overplayed Cal today," he said. "We
were trying to be too tricky when we
should have been shooting more. For
some reason we didn't play with intensity.
Cal was a hard playing, hustling team."
