# Men runners fall at Pac-10's women take top Norcal spots
## 
### Dick Hodge 
The Stanford men's cross
country team placed fourth at
the Pacific-10 Southern
division Championships in Los
Angeles, and the women's
team won the NorCal Cham
pionships at Stanford this
weekend.
The men placed behind
strong teams from UCLA, the
University of Arizona and UC-
Berkeley, but the results are
somewhat misleading. Rod
Berry, usually the Cards No.l
runner, placed far back in the
pack due to the after effects of
the flu. Men's coach Mike
Tomasello claimed that Stan
ford could have placed as high
as second had Berry been
healthy.
"It was a bad reak to lose
Rod," agonized Tomasello. "It
cost our team sorely. He's been
running top notch all year, but
I could see he was dead after a a
mile. People beat him who had
no business beating him. In a
small field like that, the loss of
one runner really costs the
team. That's the breaks."
Senior Jim Smith was the first
finisher for Stanford, clocking
31:04 over the 10,000-meter
course for seventh place. Jun
ior Bill Graham followed close
ly in 10th at 31:16, sophomore

Mike Sokolewicz finished 12th
in 31:37, and junior Brian Pet
tingill took 20th with 32:19.
Senior Tom O'Neil rounded
out the scoring in 23rd place,
clocking in at 32:21.
Tomasello said that, despite
the setback, his team is running
well and should give a strong
performance at the NCAA Re
gional Championships Nov. 14
at Stanford.
"It's still wide open," he said.
"Jim Smith and Mike
Sokolewicz are performing
very consistently, and Bill
Graham ran a good race. We're
looking forward to running on
our home course. Also, the
complexion of a meet can
change drastically with teams
like Washington State and Ore
gon competing. It's going to be
a real dogfight. We're confi
dent though. We're on an up
swing now, but we have by no
means peaked."
The women's team had no
problem, as usual. They cap
tured the top five places for a
perfect score (the second time
this year for the team), thereby
destroying all competition at
the NorCals.
Freshman star Ceci Hopp
continued to run extremely
well as she won the 5000-meter
race in the second fastest time

ever on the Stanford course,
16:48 4. Sloan Burton, also a
freshman, placed second in
17:03, sophomore Patti Sue
Plummer was third with a
17:11, and junior Kim
Schnurpfeil took fifth with
17:13.
The victory signals a change
from the past few years, when
Cal would win regularly. Stan
ford head coach Brooks John
son downplayed the signifi
cance of the victory, describing
the meet as a tune-up for Re
gional Championships Nov. 9.
"We ran pretty well," he
said. "It gets us on the com
petitive road again after a three
week layoff."
The Cards, ranked N0.2 na
tionally, will see top competi
tion at the Regionals, where
they will battle strong squads
from the University of Oregon,
Arizona, San Diego State, and
the University of Washington.
"We haven't run against Ari
zona or San Diego yet, so we
don't know what to expect.
Anybody could blow us out,"
said Johnson. "We depend on
very young people to win, so
we're vulnerable. But we aren't
changing anything too much;
we're just going to do what got
us here."

Tomasello claimed that Stan
ford could have placed as high
as second had Berry been
healthy.
"It was a bad reak to lose
Rod," agonized Tomasello. "It
cost our team sorely. He's been
running top notch all year, but
I could see he was dead after a a
mile. People beat him who had
no business beating him. In a
small field like that, the loss of
one runner really costs the
team. That's the breaks."
Senior Jim Smith was the first
finisher for Stanford, clocking
31:04 over the 10,000-meter
course for seventh place. Jun
ior Bill Graham followed close
ly in 10th at 31:16, sophomore

Mike Sokolewicz finished 12th
in 31:37, and junior Brian Pet
tingill took 20th with 32:19.
Senior Tom O'Neil rounded
out the scoring in 23rd place,
clocking in at 32:21.
Tomasello said that, despite
the setback, his team is running
well and should give a strong
performance at the NCAA Re
gional Championships Nov. 14
at Stanford.
"It's still wide open," he said.
"Jim Smith and Mike
Sokolewicz are performing
very consistently, and Bill
Graham ran a good race. We're
looking forward to running on
our home course. Also, the
complexion of a meet can
change drastically with teams
like Washington State and Ore
gon competing. It's going to be
a real dogfight. We're confi
dent though. We're on an up
swing now, but we have by no
means peaked."
The women's team had no
problem, as usual. They cap
tured the top five places for a
perfect score (the second time
this year for the team), thereby
destroying all competition at
the NorCals.
Freshman star Ceci Hopp
continued to run extremely
well as she won the 5000-meter
race in the second fastest time

ever on the Stanford course,
16:48 4. Sloan Burton, also a
freshman, placed second in
17:03, sophomore Patti Sue
Plummer was third with a
17:11, and junior Kim
Schnurpfeil took fifth with
17:13.
The victory signals a change
from the past few years, when
Cal would win regularly. Stan
ford head coach Brooks John
son downplayed the signifi
cance of the victory, describing
the meet as a tune-up for Re
gional Championships Nov. 9.
"We ran pretty well," he
said. "It gets us on the com
petitive road again after a three
week layoff."
The Cards, ranked N0.2 na
tionally, will see top competi
tion at the Regionals, where
they will battle strong squads
from the University of Oregon,
Arizona, San Diego State, and
the University of Washington.
"We haven't run against Ari
zona or San Diego yet, so we
don't know what to expect.
Anybody could blow us out,"
said Johnson. "We depend on
very young people to win, so
we're vulnerable. But we aren't
changing anything too much;
we're just going to do what got
us here."
