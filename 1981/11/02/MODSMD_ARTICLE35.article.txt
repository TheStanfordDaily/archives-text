# No. 1 Penn State upset by Miami
## 
### Associated Press 
For the fifth time this season, the No.
1-ranked college football team has be
come a memory.
Surely you remember Michigan,
Notre Dame, Southern California and
Texas, all of whom were at the top of
The Associated Press ratings earlier this
year. And now Penn State is a member
of the "We Were No. 1" club thanks to
Saturday's 17-14 loss to unranked Mi
ami of Florida.
"Halloween," said Monte Kiffin.
"Yes, that's what it was."
Kiffin, the North Carolina State
coach, was referring to his team's nine
fumbles and four interceptions in a
20-12 loss to South Carolina. But he
could have been talking the upset jinx
that has plagued the No. 1-ranked team
all season. Or he could have meant the
latest in a series of upset-filled Satur
days which also claimed 11th-ranked
lowa State, a 10-7 loser to Kansas State,
and No. 16 lowa, which lost to Illinois
24-7.
In addition, No. 14 Washington State
was beaten by fourth-ranked Southern
Cal 41-17, while eighth-ranked Ala
bama nipped No. 7 Mississippi State
13-10.
With Penn State becoming the
newest victim of the No. 1 disease, the
way was cleared for Pitt and Clemson,
last week's 2-3 teams, to move up. Pitt
built a 29-10 led over Boston College as
Dan Marino threw his 20th and 21st
touchdown passes of the season and
then hung on for a 29-24 victory. Mean
while, Clemson set an Atlantic Coast

Conference scoring record in crushing
Wake Forest 82-24.
Elsewhere in the Top Ten, fifth
ranked Georgia flattened Temple 49-3,
No. 6 Texas recorded 15 quarterbacks
sacks in stopping Texas Tech 26-9 and
ninth-ranked North Carolina downed
Maryland 17-10. Arizona State, the No.
10 team, was idle.
In the Second Ten, No. 12 Nebraska
downed Kansas 31-15; No. 13 Southern
Methodist trounced Texas A&M 27-7;
No. 15 Michigan whipped Minnesota
34-13; No. 17 Florida State buried
Western Carolina 56-31 as Greg Allen
rushed for 322 yards, most ever by a
freshman; No. 18 Washington outlasted
Stanford 42-31; No. 19 Oklahoma cele
brated the anniversary of its 82-point
output against Colorado a year by rout
ing the Buffs 49-0; and No. 20 Arkansas
swamped Rice 41-7.
The list of unbeaten-untied teams
was reduced from six to four when
Penn State and Drake fell, the latter los
ing to Tulsa 59-6. Besides Pitt and
Clemson, Hawaii buried Nevada-Las
Vegas 57-21 and Yale trimmed
Dartmouth 24-3.
An 80-yard pass play from Jim Kelly to
Larry Brodsky and three field goals by
Danny Miller helped Miami open a 17-0
lead over Penn State. The losers' Todd
Blackledge, who passed for 358 yards,
threw for a pair of touchdowns in the
final period but the Nittany Lions com
mitted two costly turnovers in the final
seven minutes â€” a fumble at the Miami
25 and an interception at the 10.
Southern Cal's Marvelous Marcus Al

len rushed for 289 yards and scored
three times, once on a pass from John
Mazur, as the Trojans handed Washing
ton State its first defeat to go along with
a tie. Allen has 1725 yards in 279 carries
this season, with three games left. The
single-season record is 1948 by Pitt's
Tony Dorsett in 1976.
Georgia's Herschel Walker, battling
the flu bug, played less than half the
game but rushed for 112 yards and four
touchdowns as the Bulldogs drubbed
Temple.
While the Texas defense was harass
ing Texas Tech quarterbacks Ron
Reeves (13 sacks) and Richy Etheridge
(2), the Longhorns got touchdown runs
of 52 yards from Rodney Tate and 20
from Herkie Walls, plus four Raul Al
legre field goals.
Alabama overcame a record-tying
seven lost fumbles and downed Missis
sippi State on freshman Terry Sanders'
29-yard field goal early in the final peri
od for Bear Bryant's 313 th coaching
triumph. Bryant thus tied Pop Warner
for second place on the all-time list, one
behind Amos Alonzo Stagg.
A 20-yard pass from Scott Stankavage
to Tyrone Anthony with 1:30 remaining
enabled North Carolina to beat Mary
land. Ethan Morton, like Stankavage
making his fist 1981 start, ran one yard
for the Tar Heels' first TD.
Lowly Kansas State held lowa State's
Dwayne Crutchfield to 46 yards, the
lowest total of his career, and upset the
Cyclones. Crutchfield brought a 139.9
average into the contest.
