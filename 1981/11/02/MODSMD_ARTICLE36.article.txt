Submarine refuses to surrender
Stockholm — Swedish military observers said here yester
day they believed the reason why the captain of a grounded
Soviet submarine, Piotr Gushin was not yet prepared to be
interrogated by the Swedish navy was that he was answering
by radio questions put to him by his Soviet superiors.
The submarine has been grounded off the south Swedish
coast near Karlskrona for five days. Its captain refused to
leave the vessel to face Swedish authorities.
Two Soviet embassy officials who have been in Karlskrona
since Friday said in newspaper inteviews published in Swe
den yesterday that they wanted to be present when the
Swedes interrogate Gushin.
Swedish military leaders have rejected their request and
insist that Gushin leave the submarine to answer their ques
tions.
Both Sweden and the Soviet Union appear to be waiting
for the other side to give in. Sven Carlsson, a high Swedish
naval officer has been quoted as saying, "Our patience is in
exhaustible."
Experts estimate that the submarine crew has enough food
stored to last about two weeks.
The Swedish navy has made preparations to take the sub
marine into tow. An interpreter previously got from a crew
member the information that the vessel had run aground be
cause its gyro compass did not function.
However, a former Swedish submarine captain, Dag
Lundman, said he did not believe the compass was out of or
der. Submarines carry reserve compasses and other naviga
tional instruments, he said.
According to Lundman, the submarine was grounded be
cause it had to accelerate its speed while trying to change
course in the narrow channels between the many islands off
the Swedish coast.
Meanwhile, about 200 soldiers from a special army unit —
paratroopers and artillery coastguardsmen — have been sta
tioned on the islands off the port of Karlskrona.
Solidarity plans more Polish strikes
Warsaw — Challenging the Polish Parliament and national
union leaders, local Solidarity unionists planned new strikes
and vowed yesterday to continue wildcat protests now idling
about 250,000 workers across the country.
Walkouts are scheduled by Solidarity chapters in at least
six cities this week, but officials could not immediately be
reached to say if they planned to cancel the protests in light
of Parliament's appeal Saturday to end them.
The Solidarity National Commission is to meet tomorrow
in Gdansk to discuss the protest wave, and may take
diciplinary measures against its own members for the first
time in its 15-month history.
Meanwhile, the worst spate of wildcat walkouts since the
independent labor federation was spawned in August 1980
showed little sign of abating yesterday.
Strikes — some of them up to 3 weeks old — continued in
Zyrardow, Tarnobrzeg, Zielona Gora and Sosnowiec over
food shortages and other issues.
Many local leaders remained adamant that strikes would
continue until the labor disputes were resolved.
"The strike committee considers all important mattersand
it will have to consider both the Solidarity leadership and
Sejm (Parliament) resolutions," said a spokesman forstriking
unionists in Tarnobrzeg.
"But the itviWe will certainly continue today and under the
current circumstances, there is almost no chance that the
strike committee will decide to stop in the next day,"he
added.
The union official cited the "stubborness" of government
negotiators who demanded the protest be suspended
before talks commence.
The Sejm said in its resolution Saturday that such protests
endangered Poland's existence — an apparent reference to
continuing economic decline. Poland has an estimated $27
billion foreign debt to the West and its lack of hard currency
has exacerbated the strike effects by curtailing Poland's abili
ty to import raw materials needed for its manufacturing base.
Begin denounces Saudi peace plan
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin has sent
President Ronald Reagan a strongly worded and detailed

condemnation of a Saudi Arabian peace plan for the Middle
East and warned that U.S. expressions of interest in it could
impede the Camp David process.
Begin briefed the Israeli Cabinet yesterday on the letter, in
which the prime minister complained that the United States
is endangering the prospects of Middle East peace by en
couraging a Saudi role.
The letter, reportedly written Friday and sent to the White
House over the weekend, represents an intensification by Is
rael of pressure on the Reagan administration to distance
itself from the eight-point peace plan proposed by Saudi
Crown Prince Fahd in August. A separate protest was made
to Secretary of State Alexander Haig on Friday by Ephraim
Evron, Israel's ambassador to the United States.
The plan has drawn support in Europe and Reagan and
Haig spoke warmly of some of its provisions last Thursday but
said there were problems with other aspects of it.
Begin, interviewed from here for the ABC program "Issues
and Answers," said Sunday the Saudi plan is an example of
"how to liquidate Israel in stages." He said Israel felt threat
ened by what seems to be increasing support in the United
States and Europe for elements of the plan.
He is expected to turn again to the subject today in what is
being billed as a major political speech to the opening of the
winter session of the Israeli parliament.
Meanwhile, in what some observers saw as a related move,
Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon reportedly has in
formed the Reagan administration that he is postponing a
visit to Washington scheduled for later this month in which
he was to have discussed strategic cooperation between the
United States and Israel. The reason reportedly given was
Sharon's heavy schedule.
The contents of Begin's letter to Reagan were not dis
closed, but a Begin aide said it "deals in detail with the prime
minister's point of view on the entire Saudi Arabia subject.
He tells the president what he thinks about the Saudis, about
the so-called peace plan and the United States reaction to
it."
NATO announces removal of nukes
Bonn — The North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided
last spring to withdraw the most widely deployed nuclear
system in Western Europe — the 20-year-old, Nike Hercules
antiaircraft launchers and their atomic warheads, according
to government officials here, in Rome and in The Hague.
More than 200 Nike Hercules launchers, with accompany
ing nuclear warheads, are spread in a belt that runs from the
north to the south of West Germany, making them among
the most visible nuclear weapon systems in that country.
Word of the still-secret Nike Hercules decision was passed
by NATO government officials who believe public dis
closure of the move now could be a way to counter giowing
opposition to deployment here and in other NATO coun
tries of new U.S. long-range Pershing and cruise theater mis
siles.
But most NATO officials disagree with this approach, re
fusing to discuss the matter on the ground that it is "secret."
Their reasons for keeping it secret vary, however.
When the decision to retire the Nike Hercules was made
last April, most NATO member countries, including the
United States, wanted to delay its announcement so that re
tirement of its nuclear warheads could be linked to introduc
tion in 1983 of new U.S. long-range Pershing and cruise thea
ter missiles.
Under terms of the December 1979, NATO decision, the
deployment of up to 572 of these highly controversial missile
systems was to be accompanied by removal of a similar
number of warheads already in Europe.
There was also some hope, voiced by several NATO of
ficials, that the Nike Hercules warheads could somehow be
worked in as bargaining chips in the upcoming theater arms
control negotiations with the Soviet Union.
Finally, some NATO military men also wanted to hold off
removing the old system until its replacement, the conven
tionally armed Patriot air defense system, was ready.
Congress can't find funding for B-1
Washington — Congress, not in a mood to raise taxes in
1982, will have to come up with a massive new tax in 1983-84
or perhaps delay the B-1 bomber or MX missile, Senate Fi

nance Committee Chairman Robert Dole said yesterday.
"We're going to have to have some massive (spending)
cuts or some massive (tax) increases" to fulfill President
Ronald Reagan's promise of a balanced federal budget in
1984, Dole (R-Kan.) said on NBC's "Meet the Press" program.
Domestic programs such as food stamps and school
lunches cannot absorb much more in cuts, Dole said. In re
sponse to a question, he said putting off the B-1 bomber and
MX missile — the backbone of Reagan's defense buildup —
is "a possibility, particularly on the B-1."
Dole said he is becoming more convinced that there will
not be any tax increase in the 1982 fiscal year which began
Oct. 1.
"I haven't ruled out any tax increase in 1982, but the pros
pects are rather dim," he said. "It's more and more difficult
to get any consensus on increasing taxes, starting with the
president, I might add, on down."
Congressional budget writers begin drafting a binding
spending outline this week while still awaiting word from the
White House on what specific course of action it wants. Dole
said he expects a decision from Reagan within the next 10
days.
"Until we get the direction or some agreement from the
president, we're sort of floundering around," he said. "The
sooner we get on with it, the better."
A draft report prepared for the House Budget Committee
estimates, that without further spending cuts or tax in
creases, the federal deficits could reach $89 billion in 1982,
$120.7 billion in 1983 and $133.2 billion in 1984.
But, even if Reagan's newest round of budget cuts and
"revenue enhancements" are enacted, the report estimates
that the government would still have deficits of $73 billion in
1982, $80.7 billion in 1983 and $74.4 billion in 1984.
Key Senate Republicans are circulating a plan that re
portedly calls for tax increases of between $50 billion and $70
billion over the next three years, with most of the increase
coming in the 1983 and 1984 fiscal years.
japan may lift Soviet trade embargo
Tokyo — The loss of several billion dollars in potential sales
of industrial plants to the Soviet Union has touched off a feud
in government and business circles here over the wisdom of
maintaining Japan's official sanctions against Moscow.
Japan imposed restrictions on trade and diplomatic con
tacts between the two countries following the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. Since then, the
government has come under mounting pressure to lift these
restraints from Japan's powerful big business establishment,
whose leaders want to see chilly relations with Moscow put
back on a more friendly — and profitable — basis.
Senior Japanese diplomats have flatly rejected such a
move out of concern that it might strain relations with Rea
gan administration officials commited to tough dealing with
the Soviets.
They suggested, however, that sticking to the hard line
may become increasingly difficult in the face of political
forces favoring improved Soviet ties.
The chill between the two countries set in early last year
when, following the Carter administration's lead, Japan put
tight limits on the exchange of visits by high-level govern
ment officials and on low-interest, government-sponsored
credits used by Japanese exporters to finance trade deals
with the Soviets. Tokyo further angered the Soviets by
boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.
Since then, Japanese traders have lost sizable Soviet orders
on at least 10 major long-term plant projects, each worth
more than $100 million, according to industry analysts here.
Many of the contracts, they said, have gone to competitors
in Western Europe, particularly France and West Germany.
The shift is widely interpreted in Japan as a sign of Moscow's
retaliation for Tokyo's close alignment with Washington on
the sanctions issue.
