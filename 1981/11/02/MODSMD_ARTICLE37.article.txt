VDT training
Today at 1:30 at The Doily you, too,
can meet the beast. Join Silicon Val
ley's latest fad and learn something
about computers (without losing
your ability to communicate in Eng
lish). )ust think where you can learn
to direct all eight (or is it seven?) of
the critter's hands; the possibilities
are endless.
Football
Tomorrow at 3:30 Daily staffers
meet to follow the Gipper's example
by training the best damn touch foot
ball team this side of er . . . Terman
Auditorium. Rated as 331 to 1 under
dogs by James the WASP, the valiant
yet-to-be-named squad will
play the ASSU Clones (unfortunately,
6 foot three, 180-pound clones) this
Sat. at 11:00. Practice will be held at
some appropriate place â€” perhaps a
local bar.
