Two Stanford students died and
one was injured in a car accident at
the intersection of Campus and
Lomita drives near the Medical Cen
ter very early Friday morning. The car
was headed north at an "excessive
rate" of speed when it hit an oak tree
head on, according to a spokesman
for the California Highway Patrol
(CHP).
The driver, who was injured, has
been charged with "felony drunken
driving," the CHP spokesman said.
Kevin MacMillan, 21, of Portland,
Ore., and Michael Becker, 20, of Pit
tsburg, Calif., were both dead at 1:15
a.m., when the paramedic arrived at
the scene of the accident, according
to Richard Miller of the Santa Clara
County coroner's office.
The driver, Robert John Simon, 21,
of Calgary, Alberta, was conscious
and in stable condition after suffer
ing arm fractures and a head injury,
said Sharon Bird, a representative
from Stanford University Hospital,
where Simon is being cared for. Ac
cording to Bird, he is "apparently
feeling physically OK."
The accident occured just north of
Palm Drive, when Simon, who was
driving a Datsun 280ZX, "failed to ne
gotiate a curve" and rammed into an
oak tree at the side of the road, said a
spokesman from the CHP.

The students were reportedly re
turning from a "Senior Pub Night"
gathering at the Golden Spike Res
taurant on Welch Road.
The charge of "felony drunken
driving" was made shortly after the
accident. The exact nature of the
charges will not be available until the
CHP files its complete report early
this week, the spokesman said. Felo
ny drunken driving is divided into
two types: vehicular manslaughter
and vehicular homicide.
A fourth student, Garrett Shumway
from La Jolla, Calif., had been in the
vehicle but got out shortly before the

accident. Simon stopped the car on
Palm Drive to let Shumway out.
Shumway only learned of the acci
dent later Friday morning.
Both Becker and MacMillan were
athletes here. MacMillan was a de
fensive back on the football team for
three years. He was forced to quit on
Oct. 20 because of a chronic hip
problem. Becker was a pole vaulter
on the track team.
All three students were members
of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity.
Services are being held today in
Pittsburg for Becker. Services for
MacMillan will be tomorrow morn

ing in Portland. Memorial services,
open to the public, are being held for
both of them Wed. afternoon in Me
morial Church.
Jon Hongladarom, president of
Theta Delta Chi, said, "everyone's
just trying to deal with the loss. Ev
erybody was pretty close to them."
He said the members of the house
met Friday morning with James
Lyons, dean of student affairs,
Michael Jackson, assistant director of
Row housing, and a psychiatrist from
the area.
Hongladarom said the psychiatrist
spoke to them about how to make Si
mon feel accepted into the fraternity
again when he is released from the
hospital. "We're going to treat him as
always," said Hongladarom. "He's
everybody's friend. We're going to
do what we can for him."
There are conflicting reports about
where the students had been Thurs
day night before the accident.
Shumway has so far been unavailable
for comment.
Kahlil Jenab, the resident assistant
(R.A.) at the fraternity, said he had
seen them around the house until a
little after 10 p.m.. According to Jenab
they went straight to The Golden
Spike.
Other sources confirm having seen
the students at the Golden Spike that
night.
