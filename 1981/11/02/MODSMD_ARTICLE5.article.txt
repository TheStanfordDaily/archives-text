# Publicity efforts brought record assessment vote turnout
## 
### Adam Goodman 
It pays to advertise. At least that is what the
ASSU and most other groups discovered in
last week's special fee assessment election.
In the well-publicized election a record
number of students turned out to approve
all 15 fee assessments and more than $200,000
of funding.
Over the weekend, members of the stu
dent groups involved in the election were
able to celebrate and perhaps even give a
sigh of relief that their intense campaigns for
funding had been fruitful. The scene was
quite different from that following the
spring fee assessment election last year.
In last spring's election nine student
groups failed to win approval of their fee
assessments. Two of these groups — Aca
demic Organizations Board (AOB) and Stan
ford Progressive Alliance (SPA) — were de
feated because they received more "no"

votes than "yes" votes. The other seven —
Boathouse, Graduate Student Association
(GSA), program fee, Publications Board,
Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPF), Student-Alumni Network (STAN),
and Volunteers in Asia (VIA) — failed be
cause 20 percent of the student population
did not vote on their assessments.

News analysis

After last spring's election the ASSU
scheduled the special fall election to give
groups a second chance. Groups whose fee
assessments failed were worried, and some,
such as ASSU Legal Counseling, threatened
to close down if they did not receive
assessment funds in the fall.
According to Glen Schofield, supervising
attorney with Legal Counseling, his group

tried to generate a sense of urgency — that
this was a last-chance effort to keep the of
fice open after fall quarter. Legal Counseling
sent outletters asking for support from peo
ple who had used the office in the past, en
listed law school students to persuade grad
uate students to vote for the assessment, and
distributed flyers around campus.
Another group, GSA, had a much more
publicized campaign for the special election
than it did last spring. Eric Berg, member of
GSA, said the group was "fairly dis
organized" last spring and was not "able to
do an extensive publicity campaign."
GSA used an extensive advertising cam
paign, most visibly featuring a poster joking
ly entitled "New Graduate Student Hous
ing" showing a graduate student camped
out in a tent in the middle of the Quad. The
group also sent out leaflets to graduate stu
dents and went door-to-door in under

graduate residences to advertise the merits
of the GSA.
Flyers and posters may be fine for some
groups, but for the Stanford Band nothing
less than an all-campus rally could advertise
their need for a fee assessment. Last
Wednesday night the band trekked all over
campus publicizing their fee assessment.
Their efforts paid off as their assessment
passed by 751 votes, but band manager "Dis
co" Ray Gruenewald said he was still "some
what disappointed."
Gruenewald thought students may not
been clear on how band money is used
and emphasized that the band does not use
fee assessment money to purchase beer.
"The band does a lot of things that students
don't see" he said. "We earn our own beer."
Gruenewald said funds from their two
quarter fee assessment would be used for
the band's 1981 road trip, physical repairs and

capital improvements to the Band Shak, of
fice equipment, uniforms, and band instru
ments.
The advertising campaigns of two groups
winning fee assessments, the AOB and pro
gram fee, drew the interest of many smaller
organizations who are dependent on them
for funds.
According to ASSU Senate Chair Dave
Phelps, AOB is responsible for the funding of
more than 30 groups and program fee for
more than 20.
Phelps said students last spring "did not
realize the importance of the Board" be
cause "fit the time the Board was in a transi
tion state." He also said the program fee, in
addition to providing money for those or
ganizations already under program fee's re
sponsibility, would create a discretionary
fund for the finance committee to provide
money fer new groups.
One group which changed its cam
paign strategy in this election was
SPA. According to Jim Steyer of SPA,
the group reduced its advertising in
the special election and tried to make
their effort "low-key." "We had to
re-evaluate our strategy because we
were afraid of creating a backlash,"
he said.
Last spring, Steyer said, another
group of students distributed a flyer
against the SPA fee assessment which
gave the impression that "we were a
bunch of lefties." Steyer said his
group limited their advertising to
flyers with GSA, Women's Center,
Program fee, and Stanford for En
vironmental Education and tried to
"show a broad perspective." SPA also
concentrated its efforts on graduate
students.
