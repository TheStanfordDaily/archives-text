## Aussies feud over new diamond wealth 
### Washington Post 
Sydnev — Already blessed with some of
the earth's richest mineral resources, Aus
tralians are being dazzled with a fabulous
new find: the world's biggest diamond
mine.
But all the glitter, discovered in an an
cient volcanic range in remote north
western Australia, has caused nettlesome
political and commercial problems.
The assessments are optimistic — eval
uating the find at up to $17 billion with a
capacity to yield an annual production
equal in carats to the entire world's current
output — but run into the view here that
South Africa, which dominates the in
ternational diamond industry, is de
termined to control the production and
marketing.
This effort would be critical for South
Africa because its diamond empire, a
mainstay of the economy, already faces se
rious difficulties.
Foreign ownership
South African businesses indirectly own
stakes in two of the three companies in the
Ashton joint Venture that is developing
the site just west of Lake Argyle in the Kim
berley region of the state of West Australia.
Moreover, South African interests control
the Central Selling Organization, the in
ternational syndicate that markets 80 per
cent of the Western world's gem-quality
rough diamonds.
The South African involvement stems
from the international network of the De

Beers company run by the family of Harry
Oppenheimer, who has been dubbed
here the "Goldfinger" of the international
diamond trade. De Beers and the Op
penheimers work closely with the South
African government.
Domestically, the issue of major South
African influence has entailed an apparent
disagreement at the top of Australia's gov
erning coalition, a rift between the federal
and state governments and friction among
the Ashton Joint Venture partners, who
are developing the site.
Controversies about a rival company's
claim to the leases and protests by
aboriginal groups that the mining violates
a "sacred site" known as the Dreaming
Place of Barramundi Gap cap the disputes.
State action
The South African issue came to the fore
recently when Australia's Liberal prime
minister, Malcolm Fraser,suggestedin Par
liament that the federal government might
intervene to make sure Australian
diamonds are marketed independently of
the South African syndicate.
In reply to a question from an opposi
tion spokesman, Fraser said, "I can see no
advantage to Australia or to Australian in
dustry in having arrangements in which
Australian diamond discoveries only serve
tostrengthen a South African monopoly in
these areas."
The questioner, Labor Party minerals
and energy spokesman Paul Keating, said
Fraser's statement marked "thefirst indica

tion from the government that it would
not be prepared to see Ashton fall easy
prey to the South African diamond syndi
cate."
Keating said two other major diamond
producers, Zaire and the Soviet Union,
"have already left the Central Selling Or
ganization and are marketing independ
ently. Australia can do the same thing."
Political implications
The South African issue is particularly
sensitive because of Fraser's efforts to
strengthen ties with black Africa and other
nations vociferously opposed to the Pre
toria government's apartheid policy of ra
cial separation. His Third World alignment,
particularly on demands for the independ
ence of South African-run Namibia, has
drawn fire from some supporters of his
conservative coalition with the National
Country Party.
Fraser's remarks in Parliament appeared
to conflict with the stated views of the
leader of his coalition partner, Deputy
Prime Minister Douglas Anthony. An
thony, who is also minister for trade and
resources, had told Parliament that there
was "no need at this stage" for govern
ment export controls on diamonds.
Labor's Keating charged that whereas
Fraser "has at least indicated some con
cern for the national interest," Anthony
and his department (fid not mind seeing
the South Africans "raping our fledgling
diamond industry."

output — but run into the view here that
South Africa, which dominates the in
ternational diamond industry, is de
termined to control the production and
marketing.
This effort would be critical for South
Africa because its diamond empire, a
mainstay of the economy, already faces se
rious difficulties.
Foreign ownership
South African businesses indirectly own
stakes in two of the three companies in the
Ashton joint Venture that is developing
the site just west of Lake Argyle in the Kim
berley region of the state of West Australia.
Moreover, South African interests control
the Central Selling Organization, the in
ternational syndicate that markets 80 per
cent of the Western world's gem-quality
rough diamonds.
The South African involvement stems
from the international network of the De

Beers company run by the family of Harry
Oppenheimer, who has been dubbed
here the "Goldfinger" of the international
diamond trade. De Beers and the Op
penheimers work closely with the South
African government.
Domestically, the issue of major South
African influence has entailed an apparent
disagreement at the top of Australia's gov
erning coalition, a rift between the federal
and state governments and friction among
the Ashton Joint Venture partners, who
are developing the site.
Controversies about a rival company's
claim to the leases and protests by
aboriginal groups that the mining violates
a "sacred site" known as the Dreaming
Place of Barramundi Gap cap the disputes.
State action
The South African issue came to the fore
recently when Australia's Liberal prime
minister, Malcolm Fraser,suggestedin Par
liament that the federal government might
intervene to make sure Australian
diamonds are marketed independently of
the South African syndicate.
In reply to a question from an opposi
tion spokesman, Fraser said, "I can see no
advantage to Australia or to Australian in
dustry in having arrangements in which
Australian diamond discoveries only serve
tostrengthen a South African monopoly in
these areas."
The questioner, Labor Party minerals
and energy spokesman Paul Keating, said
Fraser's statement marked "thefirst indica

tion from the government that it would
not be prepared to see Ashton fall easy
prey to the South African diamond syndi
cate."
Keating said two other major diamond
producers, Zaire and the Soviet Union,
"have already left the Central Selling Or
ganization and are marketing independ
ently. Australia can do the same thing."
Political implications
The South African issue is particularly
sensitive because of Fraser's efforts to
strengthen ties with black Africa and other
nations vociferously opposed to the Pre
toria government's apartheid policy of ra
cial separation. His Third World alignment,
particularly on demands for the independ
ence of South African-run Namibia, has
drawn fire from some supporters of his
conservative coalition with the National
Country Party.
Fraser's remarks in Parliament appeared
to conflict with the stated views of the
leader of his coalition partner, Deputy
Prime Minister Douglas Anthony. An
thony, who is also minister for trade and
resources, had told Parliament that there
was "no need at this stage" for govern
ment export controls on diamonds.
Labor's Keating charged that whereas
Fraser "has at least indicated some con
cern for the national interest," Anthony
and his department (fid not mind seeing
the South Africans "raping our fledgling
diamond industry."
