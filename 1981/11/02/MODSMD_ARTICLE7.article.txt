# Canada discusses constitutional option
## 
### Associated Press 
Canada's long-running
constitutional crisis comes
down to what may be a final
round of bargaining today
among the divided coun
try's top political leaders.
Prime Minister Pierre El
liott Trudeau and the pre
miers of the 10 Canadian
provinces, sitting down to
gether for the first time in
more than a year, will try to
find some ground for com
promiseon thefutureshape
of a Canadian constitution.
Eight of the 10 provincial
leaders have opposed
Trudeau's sweeping con
stitutional reform pro
posals, describing them as a

bid to centralize power in
the now relatively decen
tralized Canadian con
federation. But both the
prime minister and some
provincial premiers are
showing signs of new flex
ibility.
Trudeau optimistic
Trudeau, who wants a
new constitution to cap his
13-year career as prime min
ister, took an optimistic
stance at a news conference
Friday, refusing to comment
on what he would do if this
week's open-ended nego
tiations fail.
"I just think we're close
enough to an agreement
that I'm not looking beyond

that," he said.
But his chief aide on con
stitutional matters, Justice
Minister Jean Chretien, has
been more blunt, declaring,
"We intend to finish the
job" whether or not the
provinces reach agreement
with the federal govern
ment.
Parliament vote
"Finishing the job" means
pushing the Trudeau pack
age through the Canadian
Parliament in the coming
days and sending it to the
British Parliament for ac
tion.
Most Canadians want to
end theiranachronisticcon

stitutional ties to Britain, but
they disagree on how to do
it.
When the British sought
to discontinue the North
America Act of 1867 and
turn over full constitutional
responsibility to Canada in
1931, the Canadians could
not agree among them
selves or) a method for mak
ing future amendments.
Final responsibility re
mained with the London
Parliament, although prac
tice developed whereby
constitutional amendments
would be adopted by the
British once all Canadian
provinces agreed to them.
