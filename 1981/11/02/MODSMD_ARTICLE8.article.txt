Bonn, West Germany (AP) — Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev was quoted Saturday as saying
that if nuclear war broke out, it would inevitably
have "a worldwide character."
In remarks apparently directed at recent
statements on limited nuclear war made by Pres
ident Ronald Reagan, Brezhnev told West Ger
many's Der Spiegel magazine that "even though
there are some who hope that a nuclear war
could be contained on European territory ... a
limited nuclear war is not possible."
Any nuclear war, in Europe or elsewhere,
"would inevitably and inescapably take on a
worldwide character," the Soviet Communist
Parly leader was quoted as saying.
T he interview, which was to appear in Mon
day's issue of the magazine, is Brezhnev's first
with Western journalists since 1979. Der Spiegel
released the text to other news media Saturday.
Reagan inflamed the debate on bringing new
NATO nuclear weapons to Western Europe with

an Oct. 16 statement widely interpreted as
meaning a nuclear war could be limited to Eu
rope.

Any nuclear war, in Europe
or elsewhere,'would
inevitably and inescapably
take on a worldwide
character
— Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev

When a«-ked by a group of editors whether he
thought a nuclear exchange could be limited,
Reagan said, "I could see where you could have
an exchange of tactical nuclear weapons against
troops in the field without it bringing one of the
major powers to pushing the button."
