A shoe conceived by Karl Birkenstock of the 'M
||| 200 year old Birkenstock Shoe Company in g||
Bad Honnef, Germany, has only comfort in |i||
ijf. mind, and more and more people in the Palo fm
Wsk Alto area are finding it the ultimate in :|
footwear.

||| The sandal was designed for orthopedic pur
ill poses. Feet that have been cramped over the |§|
Wm years by shoes that are designed for the eye in- , v
stead of the foot can finally spread to their f||
||| natural position. When the toes arc allowed to ;f||
spread, the body is more properly aligned.
; Posture and circulation are improved for a |||
jam healthier, more natural and graceful walk. The
||p cork and rubber footbed conforms after a few i:§
wearings to each individual foot for total sup-
port. Simple leather straps hold the foot in
£# place. Along with diminishing fatigue, when
?■ you wear Birkenstocks, you will have the satis
|i fying feeling that you are doing yourself a |-
favor.
