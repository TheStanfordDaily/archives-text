# Kabul appears quiet, but only from heavy Soviet occupation

Kabul, Afghanistan — T here is no tangible evi
dence here of rebel ac tivity, and hardly a Soviet
army face to be seen walking in the streets —
proof, says the Afghan government, that its
armed forces are in control of the country.
The Soviet presence is discreetly hidden. The
only Soviet troops to be seen in the market and
downtown areas are military police, making sure
their countrymen stationed on the outskirts of
the c ity keep out of it.
But journalists, invited by the government to
see for themselves that Kabul is calm and not a
bloodbath, cannot help notice that this is not a
c ity at peace. I here are too many Afghan troops.
Patrols and sentries
Crossroads, public buildings and hotels are
guarded by sentries. There are patrols mingling
in the crowds, and young men in civilian clothes
are caught in spot checks on their call-up status.
Afghan and Soviet military convoys some
times including tanks add to downtown traffic
jams and the military feel of the citv.
At 10 p.m. the curfew starts. By that time ev
eryone not knowing the military password must
be at home. Not even guests at diplomatic func
tions or patrons of the current Soviet film festival
are exempt.
Officials claim there are no incidents at night,
but residents and taxi drivers say they hear ex
plosions several nights a week.
Several witnesses reported hearing the sounds
of combat one night last week coming from the
Bala Isasar area southeast of Kabul, where Soviet
troops are quartered.
Explosions heard
Even in the northern areas of the city one
could hear an early-morning series of explosions
from the Logar Province area in the south.
Diplomats also claim that Afghan forces are

taking control of Kabul at night as well as by day.
The diplomats say armed clashes between
Mjuahedeen rebels and government forces in
the city's industrial zone are becoming more
rare, as is the sight of heavy Soviet tanks rumbl
ing through the streets at night.
Government guides admitted, however, that
"an attack by a small rebel commando is always
possible even on roads close to the capital, de
spite armed garrisons and village military."
Every dawn brings the hum of aircraft activity
centered on Kabul Airport. As the dawn mist
lifts,one can often count more than 15 heli
copters taking off in groups of up to six for the
eastern Jalalabad region and the Paghman area
just north of the city.
City a fortress
Journalists who this week went on a specially
authorized visit to Paghman, formerly the sum
mer resort of Afghan royalty, were stopped six
miles out of Kabul because, they were told, their
safety could not be fully assured.
But no sign of combat could be seen from the
Karga Darn overlooking the Paghman Valley, the
scene of fighting several times in recent months.
T he dam, dominating a bay area often used by
Kabul diplomats, was heavily guarded, and no
strangers were allowed to cross the Karga Lake
to the north.
Diplomats confirmed, however, being able to
travel about 60 miles into Logar Province in the
opposite direction without incident.
But security precautions are heavy ev
erywhere. Bagrami, for instance, is guarded by a
sizable military post.
A small nearby village with a population of
about 5000 was guarded by government militia.
The guides who accompanied journalists on a
tour through the village needed to carry no
arms, however.
