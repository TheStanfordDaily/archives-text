## An inside look at wine-tasting— the cellars of Santa Clara Valley 
### David Jalajas 
There are 64 wineries in
the Santa Clara Valley with
new wineries opening each
year, according to Marilyn
Ley, public relations
director for the Santa Clara
Valley wine Growers
Association. And with many
of the wineries providing
tasting rooms for free
samplingof their wares, it is
not difficult to spend an
entire day appreciating
what Ley describes as the
greatest attraction for
tourism in the South Bay.
Before going out for a day
in the cellars, one should
become familiar with wine
society vernacular. One of
the most basic concepts to
know is the difference
between dry and sweet
wines. In a tasting room, the
white wines are usually
tasted first, followed by
roses, reds, and dessert
wines. Within each type the
order runs from driest to
sweetest — a remark on the
dryness of the first white
wine sampled, or the
sweetness of the last red,
can easily make a novice
sound like a connoisseur.
Also important are the

clarity, body, bouquet and
aroma of the wines. Most of
the hosts are eager to
provide the visitor with in
depth knowledge of their
wines. Taking notesalso
helps as one may carry new
found savoir faire to the
next winery.
The largest winery visited
was the Paul Masson Cellars
at 13150 Saratoga Avenue in
Saratoga. This winery gave
an extensive tour of their
facilities before displaying
an equally extensive
assortment of wines for
tasting. Of particular merit
were their dessert wines and
champagnes.
Another tasting room
close to campus is the
Orchard Valley Tasting
Room located in the
Orchard Valley
Marketplace in Cupertino.
Although the room itself is
very small, the wines —
particularly the
Chardonnays — are quite
good.
They also have the
distinction of being the only
winery around where one
can purchase a case of wine
with personalized labels.
The Mirassou Vineyards,

whose tasting room is
located at 3000 Aborn Road
in San Jose, recently held a
sit-down tasting at the
Holiday Inn in Palo Alto.
The "Harvest Selection"
wines at Mirassou proved to
be excellent and after
sampling Mirassou's 1978
Brut Champagne, no longer
will a case of $2 Cold Duck
suffice on New Year's Eve.
The above mentioned
wines and wineriesare just a
small fraction of the South
Bay Area wineries.
According to Ley, The Santa
Clara Valley is thelargest
premium wine producing
area in America, with 2600
acres worth of vineyards
producing 74 million
gallonsof wine.
Almaden and Paul
Masson are the two largest
South Bay wineries,
according to Paul Gillette,
syndicated wine colunmnist
and author. These two
wineriesaccount f0r45.6
million gallons of wine each
year.
One reason for the large
number of wineries in the
area is the good weather.
The cooler temperature of
the area produces a drier

wine than would a warmer
region, said Liz Maragliano,
publicity director at
Mirassou Vineyards.
Maragliano has detected
a big increase in the
consumption of white wines
in the last five years. Gillette
explained that white wines
are "more accessible to new
palates," in thattheyare
easiertoappreciatethan the
reds. Discrimination
between red wines takes a
more experienced palate,
he said.
However, Gillette sees
white wine's share of the
wine market as having
reached its peak. For the
first half of 1981, white wine
had 59.1 percent of the
market share, compared
with 19 percent for red
wines and 21.9 percent for
rose wines. In the past this
situation was reversed with
red wines dominating the
market.
The newest trend in
wines, according to Gillette,
will be in the so-called light
wines. These wines have an
alcohol content of about
seven percent and have
fewer calories than regular
wine. Four wineriesare
currently producing light
winev. Los Hermanos,
Sebastiani, Paul Masson,
and Taylor.
Gillette called these wines
"sensational" and predicted
their sales to go "absolutely
through the roof." He based
this statement on the notion
that most wine drinkers
consume the beverage for
its flavor - not to get drunk.
Because of the lower
alcohol content of these
new wines, more wine can
be consumed before a
person reaches an
intoxicated state.
Fortunately, one can
experience the many wines
available in the Santa Clara
County simply by visiting
the local tasting rooms. The
price is right, sampling is
fun, and the knowledge
obtained can make anyone
sound like a regular wine
connaisseur-

and author. These two
wineriesaccount f0r45.6
million gallons of wine each
year.
One reason for the large
number of wineries in the
area is the good weather.
The cooler temperature of
the area produces a drier

wine than would a warmer
region, said Liz Maragliano,
publicity director at
Mirassou Vineyards.
Maragliano has detected
a big increase in the
consumption of white wines
in the last five years. Gillette
explained that white wines
are "more accessible to new
palates," in thattheyare
easiertoappreciatethan the
reds. Discrimination
between red wines takes a
more experienced palate,
he said.
However, Gillette sees
white wine's share of the
wine market as having
reached its peak. For the
first half of 1981, white wine
had 59.1 percent of the
market share, compared
with 19 percent for red
wines and 21.9 percent for
rose wines. In the past this
situation was reversed with
red wines dominating the
market.
The newest trend in
wines, according to Gillette,
will be in the so-called light
wines. These wines have an
alcohol content of about
seven percent and have
fewer calories than regular
wine. Four wineriesare
currently producing light
winev. Los Hermanos,
Sebastiani, Paul Masson,
and Taylor.
Gillette called these wines
"sensational" and predicted
their sales to go "absolutely
through the roof." He based
this statement on the notion
that most wine drinkers
consume the beverage for
its flavor - not to get drunk.
Because of the lower
alcohol content of these
new wines, more wine can
be consumed before a
person reaches an
intoxicated state.
Fortunately, one can
experience the many wines
available in the Santa Clara
County simply by visiting
the local tasting rooms. The
price is right, sampling is
fun, and the knowledge
obtained can make anyone
sound like a regular wine
connaisseur-

There are 64 wineries in
the Santa Clara Valley with
new wineries opening each
year, according to Marilyn
Ley, public relations
director for the Santa Clara
Valley wine Growers
Association. And with many
of the wineries providing
tasting rooms for free
samplingof their wares, it is
not difficult to spend an
entire day appreciating
what Ley describes as the
greatest attraction for
tourism in the South Bay.
Before going out for a day
in the cellars, one should
become familiar with wine
society vernacular. One of
the most basic concepts to
know is the difference
between dry and sweet
wines. In a tasting room, the
white wines are usually
tasted first, followed by
roses, reds, and dessert
wines. Within each type the
order runs from driest to
sweetest — a remark on the
dryness of the first white
wine sampled, or the
sweetness of the last red,
can easily make a novice
sound like a connoisseur.
Also important are the

clarity, body, bouquet and
aroma of the wines. Most of
the hosts are eager to
provide the visitor with in
depth knowledge of their
wines. Taking notesalso
helps as one may carry new
found savoir faire to the
next winery.
The largest winery visited
was the Paul Masson Cellars
at 13150 Saratoga Avenue in
Saratoga. This winery gave
an extensive tour of their
facilities before displaying
an equally extensive
assortment of wines for
tasting. Of particular merit
were their dessert wines and
champagnes.
Another tasting room
close to campus is the
Orchard Valley Tasting
Room located in the
Orchard Valley
Marketplace in Cupertino.
Although the room itself is
very small, the wines —
particularly the
Chardonnays — are quite
good.
They also have the
distinction of being the only
winery around where one
can purchase a case of wine
with personalized labels.
The Mirassou Vineyards,

whose tasting room is
located at 3000 Aborn Road
in San Jose, recently held a
sit-down tasting at the
Holiday Inn in Palo Alto.
The "Harvest Selection"
wines at Mirassou proved to
be excellent and after
sampling Mirassou's 1978
Brut Champagne, no longer
will a case of $2 Cold Duck
suffice on New Year's Eve.
The above mentioned
wines and wineriesare just a
small fraction of the South
Bay Area wineries.
According to Ley, The Santa
Clara Valley is thelargest
premium wine producing
area in America, with 2600
acres worth of vineyards
producing 74 million
gallonsof wine.
Almaden and Paul
Masson are the two largest
South Bay wineries,
according to Paul Gillette,
syndicated wine colunmnist
and author. These two
wineriesaccount f0r45.6
million gallons of wine each
