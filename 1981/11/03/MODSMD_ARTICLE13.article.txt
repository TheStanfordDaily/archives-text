It was an unusual assignment when students from Mechanical Engineering 101, "Visual
Thinking," gathered around Terman Engineering Center yesterday afternoon to construct
croup structures that would span the width of the Terman pool. All groups were given iden
tical materials to build the structures which were then judged on time, strength, size and
aesthetics, with a special prize going to the most spectacular failure.
