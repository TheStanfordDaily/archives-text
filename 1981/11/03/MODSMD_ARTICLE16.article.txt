## BEYOND OUR CONTROL/Editor's Viewpoint Events,emotions interwoven 
### 
Some things happened here on campus late
last week, and people have spent a lot of time
since then talking about them.
These events were the news. That part is pretty
clear. The things that get in the way are not at all
clear, however. Sticky, non-objective things —
like emotions. They don't get in the way of the
actual facts; they won't change what's already
happened. But I think they do have a profound
effect on how each of us reacted to the news
that two students here died tragically Friday.
For no matter how much something along
these lines happens elsewhere, it always seems
different when it happens in yourown back
yard. The significance and, in the case of the
deaths, the tragedy, are of course intensified;
but so also are our own personal reactions. What
happened here Friday morning on Campus
Drivestruck all too close to home, both literally
and figuratively. The same could have
happened to the too many of us who have
engaged in reckless practices in the past.
On another note, the context in which the
accident occurred can hardly be ignored. For
many in the Stanford community, Friday was
simply a crazy day. It's hard to tell, in retrospect,
how the reactions to death may have been
different had the news come on a day when not
so many other things happened as well. For what
happened here was crazy enough, even sad

enough, without the auto accident having
occurred.
First, the oldest fraternity on campus was
temporarily kicked off — no matter how solid
the justification for such a decision may have
been, it isstill an event which we have to note
with some sadness. Next, a University office was
vandalized, and significant damage was
inflicted; the campus still lives in uncertainty as
to who is responsible, and charges and denials
have been flying.
And then, death for fellow students. The rest
of the events shouldn't fit together with that
tragedy, but somehow they do. They are what
happened at Stanford University on a certain
day, and it will be hard for many of us to separate
them out when we think back on that day.
Finally, the events seem to have taught their
own ironic lessons. Not all is perfect and proper
here at a supposedly refined institution.
Violence and destruction can and do happen:
witness the Residential Education break-in.
Moreover, violence of an even worse kind can
and does happen: witness the car accident. As
useless and senseless as these events were, they
may not have been in total vain if their
occurrence prevents similar events from
happening here in the future.
