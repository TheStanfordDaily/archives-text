## Arms buildup crucial to U.S. 
### 
The United States faces two major
foreign policy issues in the 1980s:
how to contain Soviet expansion and
how to fulfill expectations of under
developed nations — the Third
World — where continuing instabili
ty appears inevitable, especially in
the Middle East. The Persian Gulf, be
cause of its instability, volatility and
its oil, is a prime target for Soviet
takeover.
When it comes to Soviet policy, the
United States has to concern itself
with three major elements: the
buildup in strategic nuclear arms, the
size of Soviet conventional forces fac
ing NATO forces in Europe, and Sovi
et intervention in the Third World.
The Soviets attained nuclear parity
in the early 19705, yet their military
buildup has continued. They will
have the advantage in the strategic
balance for at least five years — even
with the United States' expansion in
defense spending.
Because we have failed to take ad
vantage of our economic and techni
cal superiority, the Russians have
moved ahead of us in the number
and power of their rockets, and in the
number of their nuclear submarines.
We ignore chemical and biological
warfare. The Soviets do not. They
have an active civil defense program.
We do not.
The United States should push
ahead rapidly on producing the neu
tron bomb and the cruise missile and
spend more on civil defense.
Americans lead in laser beam re
search and electronics, and we
should exploit these areas. In such
important fields as antisatellite tech
nology, the Soviets are well ahead of
the United States. This threatens our
entire intelligence and communica

tions network, for the Soviets can
shoot down or "blind" our satellites.
If we do not appear well armed,
the Soviets could be tempted to
launch conventional military assaults
as they have in Afghanistan, or even
launch a first-strike nuclear attack on
the United States that would leave
Washington unable or unwilling to
retaliate or resist further Soviet mis
sile strikes.
The period from 1980 to 1985 will
be a time of great danger for the
United States. We need interim solu
tions to protect ourselves until our
longer range programs of MX, Tri
dent submarines, cruise missiles and
B-1 bombers can become opera
tional. We need to better protect our
Minuteman 111 missiles. We must dis
perse some of our strategic bombers
to non-SAC bases and we must speed
up production of ground-launched
cruise missiles and submarine
launched cruise missiles. We should
develop a plane to carry air-launched
cruise missiles, and add several hun
dred more bombers and at least 150
submarines to our forces.
Soviet military doctrine preaches
that nuclear war is not catastrophic.
The Soviets believe they can fight,
survive and win such a war — and
they are preparing to do just that.
Richard Pipes, Harvard's leading So
vietologist, terms it the Soviet "war
fighting and war-winning nuclear
strategy."
The Soviets are protecting their
missile sites with ABM systems, train
ing their population in civil defense,
and announcing that they could
withstand heavy casualties and sur
vive.
In the 1980s, therefore, we must
spend more on arms to face the

growing Soviet threat, repair and im
prove our alliances, restore our rights
to military bases in strategic areas
(Morocco, Turkey, Egypt and Japan)
and stockpile nuclear weapons in
Japan.
We will face our greatest dangers
in Africa and the Middle East. These
areas are unstable and volatile, and
thus easy prey to radical movements
and Soviet pressure. The global
strategy of the Soviet Union aims at
seizing control of such strategic areas
as the Horn of Africa, the Strait of
Hormuz, seaports in Angola and the
port of Cam Ram Bay in Vietnam, in
order to shut off the West's access to
oil and minerals. In this way they can
force concessions from Western Eu
ropean states. The Soviets can prom
ise them oil in return for leaving
NATO. Or West European states
could be pressured into accepting
Soviet military preeminence while
remaining in NATO.
They would have to accept, how
ever, whatever the Soviets did with
the Third World. Western Europe
would have to give more loans, cred
its and technology to Eastern Europe.
And, finally, the Europeans would be
required not to oppose any Soviet
domestic or foreign policy initiatives.
The United States must make it
clear to the Soviet Union that we will
not tolerate interruption of oil sup
plies from the Persian Gulf or Saudi
Arabia, and that we will not allow
them or their clients to deny us ac
cess to Africa's mineral supplies or to
such strategic chokepoints as the
Strait of Hormuz or the entrance to
the Red Sea. Unless we do this — and
rearm to make our threats credible —
the Soviets may be tempted to take
over the gulf states or Saudi Arabia
when their own oil needs outgrow
their production.

develop a plane to carry air-launched
cruise missiles, and add several hun
dred more bombers and at least 150
submarines to our forces.
Soviet military doctrine preaches
that nuclear war is not catastrophic.
The Soviets believe they can fight,
survive and win such a war — and
they are preparing to do just that.
Richard Pipes, Harvard's leading So
vietologist, terms it the Soviet "war
fighting and war-winning nuclear
strategy."
The Soviets are protecting their
missile sites with ABM systems, train
ing their population in civil defense,
and announcing that they could
withstand heavy casualties and sur
vive.
In the 1980s, therefore, we must
spend more on arms to face the

growing Soviet threat, repair and im
prove our alliances, restore our rights
to military bases in strategic areas
(Morocco, Turkey, Egypt and Japan)
and stockpile nuclear weapons in
Japan.
We will face our greatest dangers
in Africa and the Middle East. These
areas are unstable and volatile, and
thus easy prey to radical movements
and Soviet pressure. The global
strategy of the Soviet Union aims at
seizing control of such strategic areas
as the Horn of Africa, the Strait of
Hormuz, seaports in Angola and the
port of Cam Ram Bay in Vietnam, in
order to shut off the West's access to
oil and minerals. In this way they can
force concessions from Western Eu
ropean states. The Soviets can prom
ise them oil in return for leaving
NATO. Or West European states
could be pressured into accepting
Soviet military preeminence while
remaining in NATO.
They would have to accept, how
ever, whatever the Soviets did with
the Third World. Western Europe
would have to give more loans, cred
its and technology to Eastern Europe.
And, finally, the Europeans would be
required not to oppose any Soviet
domestic or foreign policy initiatives.
The United States must make it
clear to the Soviet Union that we will
not tolerate interruption of oil sup
plies from the Persian Gulf or Saudi
Arabia, and that we will not allow
them or their clients to deny us ac
cess to Africa's mineral supplies or to
such strategic chokepoints as the
Strait of Hormuz or the entrance to
the Red Sea. Unless we do this — and
rearm to make our threats credible —
the Soviets may be tempted to take
over the gulf states or Saudi Arabia
when their own oil needs outgrow
their production.

The United States faces two major
foreign policy issues in the 1980s:
how to contain Soviet expansion and
how to fulfill expectations of under
developed nations — the Third
World — where continuing instabili
ty appears inevitable, especially in
the Middle East. The Persian Gulf, be
cause of its instability, volatility and
its oil, is a prime target for Soviet
takeover.
When it comes to Soviet policy, the
United States has to concern itself
with three major elements: the
buildup in strategic nuclear arms, the
size of Soviet conventional forces fac
ing NATO forces in Europe, and Sovi
et intervention in the Third World.
The Soviets attained nuclear parity
in the early 19705, yet their military
buildup has continued. They will
have the advantage in the strategic
balance for at least five years — even
with the United States' expansion in
defense spending.
Because we have failed to take ad
vantage of our economic and techni
cal superiority, the Russians have
moved ahead of us in the number
and power of their rockets, and in the
number of their nuclear submarines.
We ignore chemical and biological
warfare. The Soviets do not. They
have an active civil defense program.
We do not.
The United States should push
ahead rapidly on producing the neu
tron bomb and the cruise missile and
spend more on civil defense.
Americans lead in laser beam re
search and electronics, and we
should exploit these areas. In such
important fields as antisatellite tech
nology, the Soviets are well ahead of
the United States. This threatens our
entire intelligence and communica

tions network, for the Soviets can
shoot down or "blind" our satellites.
If we do not appear well armed,
the Soviets could be tempted to
launch conventional military assaults
as they have in Afghanistan, or even
launch a first-strike nuclear attack on
the United States that would leave
Washington unable or unwilling to
retaliate or resist further Soviet mis
sile strikes.
The period from 1980 to 1985 will
be a time of great danger for the
United States. We need interim solu
tions to protect ourselves until our
longer range programs of MX, Tri
dent submarines, cruise missiles and
B-1 bombers can become opera
tional. We need to better protect our
Minuteman 111 missiles. We must dis
perse some of our strategic bombers
to non-SAC bases and we must speed
up production of ground-launched
cruise missiles and submarine
launched cruise missiles. We should
develop a plane to carry air-launched
cruise missiles, and add several hun
dred more bombers and at least 150
submarines to our forces.
