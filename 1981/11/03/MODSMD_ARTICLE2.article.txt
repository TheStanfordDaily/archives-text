### 
Responding to reports by local me
dia that the accident which took the
lives of two Stanford students early
last Friday morning occurred im
mediately following a senior pub
night at the newly opened Golden
Spik.° Restaurant, owner Steve
Schwartz told the Daily yesterday
that the students left his restaurant at
around midnight — an hour and fif
teen minutes before theircarstruck a
tree.
"I have been disturbed by the
comments in the press regarding the
Golden Spike and what my staff are
trying to accomplish," Schwartz said,
explaining that the restauraunt is not
a "beer and burger joint."
"I can only personally report that
they left around midnight, at the
same time we were handling the
Zetes who were disrupting our busi
ness," he said.

"The accident occured at 1:15.
And if you see where the accident
occurred, you wouldn't conclude
that they were leaving the Golden
Spike."
The Golden Spike is located on
Welch Rodd in the Stanford Born
shopping complex.
The driver of the vehicle, Robert
Simon, 21, has been charged with
suspicion of felony drunk driving, ac
cording to the California Highway
Patrol, after the Datsun 280Z he was
driving crashed into a tree at the in
tersection of Campus Drive and
Lomita Drive. Students Michael
Becker, 20, and Kevin MacMillan,
also 20 (not 21, as reported in yester
day's Daily) died in the crash.
Charles Newman, the investigating
officer who was on duty at the county

coroner's office the night of the acci
dent, said that Becker's hands were
quite lacerated and no stamp mark
was visible. He said MacMillan's
hands were clear, but showed no
stamp mark. Regarding the alcohol
level in their blood, he said it cculd
take up to six weeks before a report
would be available.
The policy of the Golden Spike is to
allow persons over 18 years of age
into the restaurant in the evening, al
though only customers over 21 may
drink alcohol. Standard procedure is
to stamp the hands of those provid
ing identification at the door. Bar
tenders are required to ask for proof
of legal drinking age for any patron
who does not have a stamp on his or
her hand.
Schwartz had no comment regard
ing whether MacMillan, Becker or Si
mon were drinking in the restaurant.
