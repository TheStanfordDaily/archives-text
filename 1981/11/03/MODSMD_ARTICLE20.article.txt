## Europeans talk red, white and blue 
### 
It's tough being a political science
major. Most of us enjoy discussing
politics on occasion, it's true. How
ever, I am not one of those who will
talk until red, white and blue in the
face, and will rarely bring up the sub
ject myself. I find it especially dis
tressing when people automatically
assume that we poli sci's are fully in
formed and knowledgeable about
every political situation in the world
and are ready, willing and able to
argue about it. This struck me even
more forcefully when I was overseas
last year.
In French and Spanish, the
equivalent words for "major" are
"specialite" and "especialidad," re
spectively, making me a political sci
ence "specialist" in their eyes and
thus provoking immediate criticisms
of the American government and its
foreign policies. What surprised me,
however, was the defensiveness I felt
in such situations.
Here on our native soil, sur
rounded by fellow citizens, it is
almost chic to berate our govern
ment for everything from the
clothing of the First Lady to the presi
dent's Mideast policy. Every good in
tellectual knows that not to do so and
to accept the rhetoric of politicians is
to be seen either as naive, ignorant or
too idealistic. This attitude is un
related to the liberal/conservative
aspect of the issue in question, and I
find myself as susceptible to the
trend as anyone else. I will readily
criticize a political action with which
I disagree; I am much more hesitant
to come to the defense of one being
denounced, for fear of being
thought of as too uncritical and ac
cepting.
Notwithstanding this disposition,
my immediate reaction was quite dif
ferent when the criticism came from
an "outsider." When the lone Ameri
can participating in political dis
cussions in Europe, I was often per
sonally held accountable for every
aspect of American foreign policy.
Though I accept fully my "American
ism"and love this country, I naturally
do not by any means agree with every

action of our government. Yet I have
a strange habit: I tend to stand up for
myself when attacked, and thus
found myself fending off assaults on
policies which I normally would de
nounce.
In part, I believe this was due to the
nature of the arguments presented.
On one hand, I encountered those
who blamed America not only for the
entire nuclear arms race, but also for
every aspect of their country's in
ternal economic woes. Their own un
employment, inflation and high in-

terest rates were all due to the per
vasive effects of our own.
Furthermore, I was told that Europe
an rulers cannot be blamed, for they
are all at America's beck and call.
The CIA infiltrates all foreign or
ganizations, and Washington will not
allow the rise of unacceptable gov
ernments. (When I brought up
Ayatollah Khomeini or French Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand, they were
dismissed as flukes who will not last
long.) I was shocked to hear myself
coming to the defense of the CI A. Yet
if I suggested that though powerful, it
was not quite so all-pervasive as they
claimed, I was dismissed as naive.
The most frustrating assertions,
though, were that absolutely no one
in Europe wants or benefits from the
American presence there. We im
pose ourselves on them with no en
couragement and Europeans are
powerless to resist. Isolationist that I
am, I found myself pointing out the
virtues of interventionism and
(Heaven forbid!) even imperialism.

In contrast, there were those who
love America, American culture and
American protection from the com
munist threat. Though I reject any all
benevolent view of the American
government and the paternalism
thus implied, it is hard to reject praise
when it is forthcoming. Along those
lines, I was even rebuked for Ameri
can weakness and lack of in
terference.
Afghanistan was entirely our fault,
for if we had shown greater strength,
the Soviets would not have invaded.

We alone hold the responsibility to
protect the free world, including
such democratically elected govern
ments as El Salvador, where the right,
the military or any anti-Soviet forces
are in control.
Obviously, most of the views I have
presented above are extremes,
though I came across them more
often than one might think. What
struck me especially, however, was
the tendency to see America as the
other extreme and to either deny or
dismiss the opposing factions in Eu
rope itself. Admittedly, our country is
such a giant that nearly every action
we take is going to have some effect
abroad, which will be applauded by
some and condemned by others.
Our influence is much too great
for our own or anyone else's good.
Thus, we are damned if we do and
damned if we don't â€” the irony
being that in either case we probably
deserve the damnation.

more forcefully when I was overseas
last year.
In French and Spanish, the
equivalent words for "major" are
"specialite" and "especialidad," re
spectively, making me a political sci
ence "specialist" in their eyes and
thus provoking immediate criticisms
of the American government and its
foreign policies. What surprised me,
however, was the defensiveness I felt
in such situations.
Here on our native soil, sur
rounded by fellow citizens, it is
almost chic to berate our govern
ment for everything from the
clothing of the First Lady to the presi
dent's Mideast policy. Every good in
tellectual knows that not to do so and
to accept the rhetoric of politicians is
to be seen either as naive, ignorant or
too idealistic. This attitude is un
related to the liberal/conservative
aspect of the issue in question, and I
find myself as susceptible to the
trend as anyone else. I will readily
criticize a political action with which
I disagree; I am much more hesitant
to come to the defense of one being
denounced, for fear of being
thought of as too uncritical and ac
cepting.
Notwithstanding this disposition,
my immediate reaction was quite dif
ferent when the criticism came from
an "outsider." When the lone Ameri
can participating in political dis
cussions in Europe, I was often per
sonally held accountable for every
aspect of American foreign policy.
Though I accept fully my "American
ism"and love this country, I naturally
do not by any means agree with every

action of our government. Yet I have
a strange habit: I tend to stand up for
myself when attacked, and thus
found myself fending off assaults on
policies which I normally would de
nounce.
In part, I believe this was due to the
nature of the arguments presented.
On one hand, I encountered those
who blamed America not only for the
entire nuclear arms race, but also for
every aspect of their country's in
ternal economic woes. Their own un

terest rates were all due to the per
vasive effects of our own.
Furthermore, I was told that Europe
an rulers cannot be blamed, for they
are all at America's beck and call.
The CIA infiltrates all foreign or
ganizations, and Washington will not
allow the rise of unacceptable gov
ernments. (When I brought up
Ayatollah Khomeini or French Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand, they were
dismissed as flukes who will not last
long.) I was shocked to hear myself
coming to the defense of the CI A. Yet
if I suggested that though powerful, it
was not quite so all-pervasive as they
claimed, I was dismissed as naive.
The most frustrating assertions,
though, were that absolutely no one
in Europe wants or benefits from the
American presence there. We im
pose ourselves on them with no en
couragement and Europeans are
powerless to resist. Isolationist that I
am, I found myself pointing out the
virtues of interventionism and
(Heaven forbid!) even imperialism.

In contrast, there were those who
love America, American culture and
American protection from the com
munist threat. Though I reject any all
benevolent view of the American
government and the paternalism
thus implied, it is hard to reject praise
when it is forthcoming. Along those
lines, I was even rebuked for Ameri
can weakness and lack of in
terference.
Afghanistan was entirely our fault,
for if we had shown greater strength,
the Soviets would not have invaded.

We alone hold the responsibility to
protect the free world, including
such democratically elected govern
ments as El Salvador, where the right,
the military or any anti-Soviet forces
are in control.
Obviously, most of the views I have
presented above are extremes,
though I came across them more
often than one might think. What
struck me especially, however, was
the tendency to see America as the
other extreme and to either deny or
dismiss the opposing factions in Eu
rope itself. Admittedly, our country is
such a giant that nearly every action
we take is going to have some effect
abroad, which will be applauded by
some and condemned by others.
Our influence is much too great
for our own or anyone else's good.
Thus, we are damned if we do and
damned if we don't â€” the irony
being that in either case we probably
deserve the damnation.

It's tough being a political science
major. Most of us enjoy discussing
politics on occasion, it's true. How
ever, I am not one of those who will
talk until red, white and blue in the
face, and will rarely bring up the sub
ject myself. I find it especially dis
tressing when people automatically
assume that we poli sci's are fully in
formed and knowledgeable about
every political situation in the world
and are ready, willing and able to
argue about it. This struck me even
