## Leave Crothers open during Christmas break 
### 
Director of Housing and Food Ser
vices Ed Scoles and Norman Rob
inson, associate dean of student af
fairs for residential education, have
tentatively decided to close Crothers
Hall between Dec. 19 and Jan. 3, ef
fective this year.
The reason that Crothers should be
closed, they say, is because "most law>
students vacate the campus during
this period." It therefore seems rea
sonable to them to save heating ex
penses by closing Crothers.
There are at least three reasons,
however, why Crothers Hall should
remain open during the Christmas

break.
First, the "Christmas break" is not a
break for the law students at all. Final
examinations for law students take
place in January. As a result, Christ
mas is not a time to go home and re
lax but rather a time to study for ex
ams. Since Crothers has its own li
brary, which does not close at 5 p.m.
during holidays, itoffersa quiet place
to prepare for examinations. Com
pare that atmosphere to Christmas
time feasts and family reunions and it
becomes clear why many law stu
dents prefer to spend some or all of
their reading period here.

Second, some students simply can
not afford to fly home for the vaca
tion. Keeping students out of the res
idence halls is a poor Choice of meth
od to reduce the University's Decem
ber budget.
Third, the University has not de
cided to close any of the other gradu
ate dorms during the Christmas
break. This puts the decision to close
Crothers in a different light: true,
many students vacate the campus
over the holidays, but why single out
the one dorm where students need
to remain in order to study for Janu

ary finals?
It is my hope that the University
will reconsider its preliminary de
cision to close Crothers during the
Law School's two-week reading peri
od. The closure would force students
to pay hundreds of dollars on plane
fares so that they can go home and
uncomfortably explain to their fami
lies that they need some peace and
quiet instead of relatives and football
games.
