## Non-racists accord contributions equal weight 
### 
I take exception to a couple of
points in Roger Lang's article (Daily,
Oct. 23) on "Proud White America
. . He writes, . . (whites have
been) as large a detriment to world
well-being as everything else com
bined." How blatantly racist a
statement this is, will be recognized if
one examines its converse â€” namely
that whites have contributed more to
human progress than all other peo
ples combined. I do not wish to
belabor this too much further, but
the non-racist attitude would be that
no one ethnic group has a monopo'y
over either positive or negative con
tributions to humankind.
Lang also writes that racism is re
sponsible for the tragic murders of 26

black youths in Atlanta. However, ev
idence so far points toward Wayne
Williams, a black man, as the per
petrator of most of these heinous
crimes.
The rest of the article is mostly a
string of pious platitudes and I have
no quarrel with it.

Zetes no longer 'wild'
I want to thank Norm Robinson
and his anti-fraternity five-member
committee for ruining my college life
and exterminating the 90-year-old
Zete tradition. In particular, the 24

new members of the House, who will
be deprived of three years of in
valuable memories with the friends
they chose to live with, and the eight
House members overseas, want to
express their gratitude.
You can be sure that all members
of the house will leave Stanford with
a bitter feeling toward the University
now. The gross, propagandistic exag
gerations of minor incidents, and the
deliberate neglect of the facts that
the Zete House is no longer a "wild
frat" and that it enriches the social
life of the campus, can lead only to
enmity and disgust.

Boring Band
Having closely followed Stanford
football for over 30 years, I would like
to make two observations.
First, the student cheering section
is as enthusiastic as ever, but would
be ever so much more effective with
some coordination.
The Stanford band no longer pro
vides real entertainment for anyone
except themselves. I can't believe
that the majority of their members
condone their tastelessness. Cute
ness, as a goal in itself, ain't cute!
Has the Stanford Band burned the
school song music, too?
