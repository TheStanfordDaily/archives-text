I San Franciscans have long seen themselves as fostering
I cultural oasis in the midst of the philistine West. Opera,
Ballet and literature have taken root by the Golden Gate
I) a way not found in, say, the City of Angels, where the
lovie industry has usurped most of the cultural re
sources.
I To the long list of San Francisco's artistic achievements
ope must now add the San Francisco jazz Festival (of
ficially known as — pause for a breath — "the San Fran
ftco International KJAZ festival") which has given the
lo; al jazz scene a well-deserved shot in the arm.
■On consecutive days, jazz fans were able to see Dave
Blubeck, Chick Corea, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Cecil
Taylor, Mel Torme, Gary Burton, and Art Pepper, as well
as a host of local talents such as Jessica Williams, James
and Larry Vuckovich.
In conjunction with the festival, workshops were held
at the Keystone Korner, jam sessions took place at the

Fairmont, and classic jazz films were shown at Berkeley's
Pacific Film Archive. In short, jazz took over the City for a
few days, and even Mayor Feinstein recognized the oc
casion by declaring a jazz awareness week.
Thursday's opening performance was jazz's
equivalent of the baseball old-timers' game. Dave
Brubeck and the Modern Jazz Quartet, two of the most
famous jazz acts of the fifties, graced the stage of Davies
Symphony Hall.
Brubeck was once a smiling fatherly type, whose pian
istic limitations were compensated for by a rare brand of
musical integrity and brilliant side musicians. Brubeck is
now a smiling grandfatherly type, without the brilliant
sidemen, but still offering fans a happily idiosyncratic ap
proach to the piano.
At home I have a stack of Brubeck albums on the shelf
which I listen to almost exclusively for the stunning
playing of alto saxophonist Paul Desmond. Desmond, a
witty intellectual (almost as rare in jazz as in roller derby
or TV wrestling), composed Brubeck's hit single "Take
Five" and aided the Brubeck quartet with some of the
most melodic solos of the modern jazz era.
But since Desmond's passing, the fan of Dave Brubeck
must pay more attention to the leader's piano playing —
playing which has never won the praise of jazz critics. In
many ways Brubeck has been unfairly chastised by critics
who have resented his commercial success; Brubeck is a
creative improviser. He avoids the musical cliches that
color the playing of many of his contemporaries. On
Thursday night his reading of the Disney movie tune
"Someday My Prince Will Come" bubbled over with
clever twists and turns, as Brubeck provided ingenious
harmonic substitutions and rhythmic displacements, and
at one point even managed to make the droll waltz
sound like Fats Waller stride.
But the highs in a Brubeck performance are always
matched by equally distinctive lows. Dave Brubeck plays
a dense, full-bodied style of jazz piano — in layman's
terms, he uses all ten fingers simultaneously — to get a
thick sound from his instrument. At the same time his
playing is percussive — he attacks the piano with sharp,
biting chords. The combination of these two elements, at
their best, leads to a strong, probing style of jazz; but at
their worst one gets the impression that Brubeck is just
pounding away at the keyboard.
Brubeck opened on Thursday with a version of "Take

Five", and his playing had all of the mechanical as
surance one would expect from a man who had played
that same song thousands of times. One got the feeling
that it was programmed first in order to get it out of the
way. Bui the creative intensity picked up as the program
progressed. Brubeck was reunited with his original trio,
with Cal Tjader on drums, and Ron McCrotty on bass;
this group, which first recorded for Fantasy Records in
1949, ran through a rendition of "Blue Moon", a number
which was featured on that first album. Afterwards
Tjader moved to vibes, and worked his way through two
magical Duke Ellington pieces.
The Brubeck group was followed by the Modern Jazz
Quartet, and here the festival really came alive. The MJQ
has been in retirement for a number of years; their last
appearance in the Bay Area was at Oakland's Paramount
Theater in 1976. Yet Thursday night's performance was so
polished and professional, one had the suspicion that
the Quartet has spent the last five years practicing to
gether in secret.
In part this can be explained by the fact the group has
just returned from a reunion tour of Japan, but it is large
ly due to the consummate musicianship which has
always been a trademark of the group. In particular,
bassist Percy Heath and drummer Connie Kay work
towards a truly group sound, eschewing the egocentric
flamboyance of many modern rhythm sections.
About the other two members of the group, pianist
John Lewis and vibraphonist Milt Jackson, one can only
say what has been said many times before — Lewis is an
amazingly talented composer who provides the MJQ
with challenging material, and Jackson is one of the
greatest performers of modern jazz.
The MJQ.worked its way through a handful of Lewis
compositions, and performed a concert hall rarity —
they electrified theaudiencewith understatement. After
one slow and melodic extract from a John Lewis film
score, the audience rose spontaneously for a standing
ovation. The concert was far from over, and the musi
cians themselves seemed stunned but pleasantly sur
prised by the response, but music of this nature —
strong, provocative, warm, intoxicating — warrants just
such an enthusiastic reception.
Friday night's tribute to Chick Corea featured an all
star cast of contemporary musicians but largely failed to
recapture the magic of the night before. Technical prob

lems hindered what was otherwise a well-run festival.
The sound mix was poor — Corea's piano was under
miked, while saxophonist ]oe Henderson was so
drowned out, that one rather imagined what he was
playing rather than actually heard it.
The winner of the sound battle went to drummer Roy
Haynes, a lauded bebop veteran who has played with ev
erybody from Charlie Parker to John Coltrane. Haynes
has always played agressively and loudly, but in this con
text he drowned out his cohorts.
But the duets between Chick and vibist Gary Burton
were well-presented. Burton did not seem intimidated
by the previous evening's display of two of the finest
vibes players, jackson and Tjader, and in fact seemed to
relish the competition. Burton is the most technically ac
complished of the three, and the things he does with
four mallets are staggering.
Early in his career Jackson modelled his sound on the
melodic sax players of his day, and thus deviated from
the more percussive stylings of previous vibists typified
by Lionel Hampton. The younger Burton offers a much
different keyboard oriented style of playing, seemingly
influenced by pianist Bill Evans.
Chick's playing was outshone by the beauty of
Burton's improvisations; it was not until the last duet, "La
Fiesta" that Corea showed the depth of his own con
siderable talent.
The quartet, asalready mentioned, suffered from poor
sound, but managed to tone down the proceedings for a
scintillating version of Monk's "Round Midnight" and a
rambunctious reading of the same composer's "Trinkle
Tinkle".
Burton rejoined the group for a closing rendition of
the old Corea song "Matrix." Once again Burton, a diffi
dent man with the demeanor of an accountant rather
than a musician, stole the show with a confidently per
formed technical etude of a solo which must have scared
any vibes player* who happened to be in the audience.
Thus the San Francisco Festival — excuse me, the San
Francisco International KJAZ Festival — proved with two
sellout crowds that jazz can not only survive, but flourish
in the city by the Bay. Yet if San Francisco assists jazz, the
festival tried to show that things can work the other way
too — all of the proceeds from the show go to the Com
mittee to Save the Cable Cars.


ohn Lewis jazzing it up ,it the KJAZ Festival.
