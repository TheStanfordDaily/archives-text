# Knack, Knack. Who's there? A return of puppy lust

The Knack
The Keystone/Palo Alto
27 October 1981
v How far can you go with pre
pubescent sex? The Knack
seem intent on making a career
out of extolling the wonders,
the thrills, and the disappoint
ments of puppy lust. Yheir
show at the Keystone Palo Alto
Nast Tuesday was full of im
probable pop mockery set
against the familiar Knack
backdrop of sex in parking lots
and heartbreak at junior high
mixers. If there were laws
against aural kiddie porn, the
wack would be behind bars
instead of making records.

You don't have to be a
pederast to enjoy their songs,
though, and the enthusiastic
over-18 crowd at the Keystone
contained plenty of people
who appeared to have suc
cessfully resolved the conflicts
of adolescence. The Knack de
livered old songs, new songs,
and unexpected directions
with all the charm, poise, and
exuberance of a schoolboy's
first kiss. The performance was,
if not as memorable, at least as
enjoyable.
When they aren't clinging to
the image of nasty young boys,
the Knack are capable of dis
playing an amazing amount of
versatility and talent. This is for
tunate; the songs that sounded
like warmed-over versions of

earlier songs were not very
good (with the notable excep
tion of "She's Got the Beat"),
but most of the songs which
showed the Knack exploring
new ground were excellent.
"Open the Door," for in
stance, is a choice jazz-rock
number that KPEN could play
without raising any eyebrows
in its already highbrow au
dience. Berton Averre runs
through riffs that would make
any fusion guitarist proud, and
the song displays a sophisti
cation of balance and theme
that belies the Knack's more
successful ventures in the pop
jungle.
Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said for the Knack's
new single, "Pay the Devil." A

Grateful Dead libretto theme
and a Spinners tune do not a lis
tenable song make. The new
musical ground the Knack are
exploring in this song is the
stuff that makes Casey Casern
so popular among fourteen
year olds on Sunday mornings
— prettily harmonized "oooh
baby"sand an instrumental
track that could be performed
by a monkey with a Wurlitzer.
It is different from the Knack's
earlier material, but even pre
adolescents grasp that not all
change is for the better. You
can hardly say you've arrived
when you manage to out-Toto
Toto.
The Knack may be branching
out in response to the poor
commercial and artistic show

ing of their second album,
. . . but the little girls under
stand. Interestingly, the selec
tion of new songs reflects
strong influences from various
sources in their native Califor
nia, where the band has been
touring frequently. The soft
jazz songs evoke images of Col
trane, Klemmer, Michael
Franks — hardly names one
would normally associate with
the Knack.
And the one cover they per
formed was of a song by a band
that's currently the hottest act
from California. The Knack not
only had the audacity to play
the Doors' "Break On
Through," but the ability and
enthusiasm to play it well. As
well as the Doors? Certainly
better than the Doors could
have played "My Sharona,"
and as well as the Knack played
that song and their other early
hits. Is it any special mystery
that Rolling Stone contained
articles on Jim Morrison and
Doug Fieger, the Knack's lead
singer/writer/Svengali, in suc
cessive months?
What sounds well packaged
on vinyl often comes out ex
cessively choreographed on
stage, and the Knack's frequent
exhortations forcrowd partici
pation were too practiced to be
real. The pre-FHalloween cos
tume crowd — my favorites
were the woman with glowing
electric earrings and the short
man who looked like Hitler
wearing prisoner's stripes —
needed no added inducement
when the Knack kicked into
old favorites like "My
Sharona," "Selfish," "Good
Girls Don't," and "Frustrated.
As long as blurring the line be
tween tasty and tasteful leads

to commercial success, these
guys have got it made.
The Knack's appearance was
made all the more welcome by
the metallic droning of the
warmup entertainment. Push,
a band that sounds like the
Knack trying to do Beatles
songs, was able to rise out of
the genre into some interesting
power pop. The enthusiasm
they were able to generate was
wasted when the second act

look the stage. I'm not sure ex
actly what the name of this
band was- "Laser" something
but they sounded enough like
a garage band enamored with
Styx and Journey that I'll avoid
all bands with "Laser" in their
names for a good long time.
The diffident law student who
accompanied me was equally
unimpressed, and she's from
Modesto, where they like this
kind of stuff.
