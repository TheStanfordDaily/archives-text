No one's ever been able to c laim that
I they love the Knack, because the band
wouldn't allow it — thegroupsetthem
selves up to be hated. They unashamed
ly marketed themselves as the new
I Beatles, right down to the old Capitol
label on their first album, Cef the Knack,
which was a replica of the label on the
Meet the Beatles!. They were pointedly
rude to the press; they only booked
I themselves in small halls so as to keep a
constant demand for their tickets; they
heckled their concert crowds; they re
leased twelve innuendo-filled songs
about sex (definitely not about love),
and they put two of the most obnoxious
leers since the Watergate days on their
album cover.
These guys transcended simple ar
rogance, but they got what they wanted
— a popularity so big that people
bought concert tickets just to hang
"Knuke the Knack" signs over
balconies. This furor lasted about an
hour and a half. Then everyone simulta
neously realized how inconsequential
the Knack were and went back to their
Perry ,Como records.
The group released a follow-up
album which hit the discount racks
seemingly before they had left the stu
dio, and then "retired' for a couple of

years. With Round Trip the Knack subt
ly announce that they're back.
One can really feel for them here be
cause they try so doggone hard to be in
teresting again. They use a dirty word
and act real belligerent in an attack on
modern artists; they release a single
about the need to respect the devil;
they steal songs from the later Beatles
(as well as grabbing styles from other
groups, like the Doors), and they sur-

One can really feel for
them here because they
try to doggone hard to be
interesting again.

prise you with some cute liner notes.
But they also prove that you can't go
home again, because now they're
something they never were before:
boring.
Both before and now they relied on
pounding drum beats in their music,
but they used to enhance this by doing
little creative things like adding in other
instruments. No more. After the first

two songs the suspicion is that those
other three guys on the cover are just
props and the Knack is only one man.
Once they start playing actual music
(midway through side one or so), they
hit upon an occasional catchy tune like
"Just Wait and See," "Boys Go Crazy,"
or "Pay the Devil". But neither the mu
sic nor the lyrics are ever more than
nondescript and, unlike on Get the
Knack, the songs aren't a whole lot of
fun to listen to. Maybe the problem is
that they put on a lyric sheet with this
one and they didn't want to risk being
wild when they could be understood.
But even so, a song with a title like "An
other Lousy Day in Paradise" has no
right to be bland.
Even their single attempt at con
troversy is misguided. Musically "Art
Wars" is a washout, but the lyrics are so
angry that the group must have in
tended the song to stand out. Why? So
they're the voice of "the people who
work for a living" against Andy Warhol
and Salvador Dali. Do these people real
ly need a voice against Andy Warhol
and Salvador Dali? And are the mem
bers of the Knack really people who
work for a living?
Anyway, the Knack is back. Com
mence the dancing in the streets. But
those looking for someone to hate are
going to have to stick with the Yankees
or the Ayatollah because it's impossible
to feel that strongly about something,
this uninteresting.
