# Mock' Trials' of a tame Wilde
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Since The Trials of Oscar
Wilde is enjoying a pre
miere engagement in San
Francisco, having been
banned in thiscountry upon
its initial release twenty-one
years ago, it would be nice
to be able to report that the
film is a neglected master
piece. Unfortunately, how
ever, it's not a very good
movie.
Oscar Wilde was a flam
boyant wit whose public
lack of restraint shocked
London; his adoration for
the young Lord Alfred
Douglas, whom he called
"Bosie", so enraged
Douglas' celebrated father,
the Marquis of
Queensbury, that- Wilde
found himself labeled a
sodomite (which was proba
bly untrue: the passion ap
pears to have remained un
consummated), sued
Queensbury for libel, and
upon losing the case, was
sentenced to prison for
homosexuality. The refusal
of Victorian society to ex
cuse Wilde in public for
doing (or wishing to do)

what many men certainly
did in private — the double
standard embodied in men
like the brutal Queensbury,
who drove his wife out of
the house and brought his
mistress to live with him —
would make a great movie,
but this isn't it.
Perhaps I seem harsh in
damning the movie for not
being so ambitious as to em
brace a subject so large, but
what other reason could
one have for filming this
part of Wilde's life? The re
fusal of Ken Hughes, who
wrote and directed the pic
ture, to investigate the im
plications of the story seems
a bit coy — especially con
sidering that he assumes
that Wilde and Bosie didn't
have a real affair.
On its own modest terms,
though, The Trials of Oscar
Wilde engages us — mostly
because ot the talents of the
three leading performers.
Peter Finch is less my idea of
Oscar Wilde than Robert
Morley (who has also played
him on screen, in Oscar
Wilde, also in 1960), but he
gives the role the solid, un

assuming, impeccably in
telligent Peter Finch treat
ment.
During his lifetime, Finch
did not receive the credit he
deserved for his work in
movies like The Pumpkin
Eater and Sunday, Bloody
Sunday; Americans re
member him mostly for his
slightly hysterical portrayal
of the TV cult figure in
Network because he died
shortly after its release and
then won an Oscar for the
picture. It's worthwhile to
take a look at a movie in
which he made less noise
but did more real acting.
James Mason matches
Finch in the role of the pros
ecutor, and Yvonne
Mitchell, an English actress
too little known here
(Woman in a Dressing
Cown, in which she plays a
neurotic trying to hold a
family together, merits the
attention of revival houses),
plays Constance, Wilde's
wife. It's not much of a part
— the woman is all baffled
patience — but Mitchell
gives us a hint of an authen
tic character underneath.
