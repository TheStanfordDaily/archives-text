# Palo Alto businesses report varied patronage from Stanford students
## 
### George Fujii 
When it comes to shopping, the University may be
more self-contained than one might imagine, consider
ing the number and variety of stores close to campus.
For although there are more than 10,000 students on or
near campus, they make up less than 30 percent of the
total business of most stores in the area, according to an
informal Daily survey.
The survey assumed the three major shopping areas of
the average Stanford student to be: Stanford Shopping
Center, Town and Country Village, and the University
Avenue area. These were chosen for their proximity to
the University. Through phone calls and personal in
terviews, shopkeepers were asked what amount of their
total business they attributed to University students. Al
though some shopowners said it was extremely difficult
to give any type of estimate at all, most came up with a
rough percentage after a little thought.
Clothing stores highest
After randomly selecting a variety of stores, the Daily
determined that clothing store employees attributed the
highest figures to Stanford students. Topps and Trowsers
Assistant Manager D.J. Walker estimated one-half of the
store's total business comes from Stanford.
Walker commented that his shop caters mainly to
younger men, which would account for its high per
centage of student customers. Susan Chin, assistant man
ager of the Gap, a clothing store, had the next highest
estimate with 30 percent, followed by Peck and Peck Co.
with 25 percent, and the Clothes Barn and Grodins with
20 percent. Orpheus International Inc. and L'Uomo,
shops specializing in fine men's clothing, reported the
lowest estimates, with only 10 and 5 percent respectively.
Stanford Shopping Center gift and curio shops re
ported similar percentages of business from students. L.
Fedelchak, the manager of Sweet Dreams, a candy and
gift shop, approximated 45 percent of her business
comes from University students. Lisa Johnson, manager
of Taylor and Ng, estimated 30 percent, while Kitty
Pavlath, day manager of Down Home Craft Shop, at
tributed 20 percent of her business to Stanford students.
Games and Things checked in with 20 percent also.
Student clientele
Other businesses which considered Stanford students
to be a major portion of their clientele were the eateries,
with La Baguette (a fine pastry shop) and Yogurt Village
both estimating 50 percent. McDonald's Manager Louis
Cernada said, "I can't even guess at it because I can't tell
who's a student and who's not."
The highest estimate was reported by I. Natural, a cos

metic shop, which credited Stanford students with pro
viding 60 percent of its total business. On the whole, the
average estimate of the shopowners at Stanford Shop
ping Center was 23 percent. Shops which reported very
low percentages of students in their business were:
Jewel Tree, 10 percent; Thinker Toys, 10 percent;
Snowden-Mize, 5 percent; Cupola, 3 percent; and Ed
ward's luggage, 2 percent.
E. Reininger of Edward's Luggage said that while the
number of students is low, the average sale is quite high,
compared to stores which specialize in other items.
Town and Country Village
Another major shopping area near campus is Town
and Country Village. Eight shops were randomly chosen
for the survey. The highest figure was reported by Town
and Country Pharmacy, with 20 percent. The other stores
estimates were: On Line Microcenter, 15 percent;
Sportique Finale, 10 percent; Something to Crow About,
10-percent; and the Featherbed Comforter Shop, 5 per
cent. The Cover Girl reported a fewstudents in its gener
al business, while Edy's Candy and Ice Cream and Patrick
James Men's Shop checked in with no opinion. Overall,
only 10 percent of the stores' clientele was approximated
to be Stanford students.
The University Avenue area is the third closest shop
ping area to campus. The overall percentage of the 13
randomly chosen shops was approximately 20 percent.
Bike shops reported large percentages of business from
Stanford students. Don Mc√üride of Palo Alto Bike esti
mates 40 percent and said at the beginning of the school
year it is as high as 75 percent. Rhea's Schwinn and Stan
ford Bike Exchange both reported that a substantial por
tion of their business comes from Stanford students.
Steve Kelley at Stanford Bike Exchange noted that busi
ness has increased substantially over the past year.
Also at 40 percent was the University Art Center, and
City Feet, a shoe store. Harold Clark, of Sound Systems,
attributed 25 percent of his business to the University.
Clark observed, however, that there has been less foot
traffic in the store by students this year and said he won
dered if it had anything to do with a reluctance to spend.
Luper's Shoe Company had an estimate of 15 percent;
Kitty O'Hara (a women's clothing store), The Minimal
Space (furniture store), Round Table Pizza, and
Plowshare Books all estimated 10 percent.
Of the other stores, University Stationers had the low
est estimate with 2 percent. Jeff Weaver of University Sta
tioners pointed out that its location (at the end of Uni
versity Avenue) does not help business.
