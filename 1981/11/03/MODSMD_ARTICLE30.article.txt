# Ombudsman's report tor 1980-81
## Growing pressures in academic life reflected in concerns for Honor Code 
### 
"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests und
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses uf discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay und complication in administration of
university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the in
dividual's experience with university activities. The Om
budsman exists to receive, examine und channel the
complaints and grievances of members of the Stanford
community, and to secure expeditious and imfiartial
redress." (From the Churge to the Ombudsman. August
19731
The Activities of this Office
The problems brought to the Ombudman's office have
steadily increased over the past several years. This is
reflected in the number of "cases" (a "case" may represent
one person or a group): 494 in 1978-79. 543 in 1979-80, 677
in 1980-81.
These numbers cover problems of minimal difficulty to
resolve as well as those that are difficult or even impossible
to resolve. However, the latter are few. and most problems
are satisfactorily resolved.
All constituencies of the university community are
reflected in these figures, but it is especially significant that
considerably more than half were student problems
covering almost all aspects of student life.
The increase in student complaints may be due in part to
the publicity the Ombudsman's office has received over
recent years. A more probable cause seems to be the
present uncertainty about future career possibilities. When
this is coupled with intense competition for grades an at
mosphere of stress and anxiety results, loading in some
instances to Honor Code violations. In these circumstances

many relatively minor matters take on an exaggerated
importance. Worst of all, the relationships of students
among themselves and their relationships with instructors
are also adversely effected.
The observations of this office concerning student
competition and its consequences in the lives of students
have been confirmed by a detailed survey conducted by Dr.
Saul Rosenherg concerning Stanford Premeds. In a
preliminary report he writes:
"Competition for admission to medical school and to a
lesser extent, premed course requirements, are seen as the
main causes of these problems by all groups, but premeds
also feel that student attitudes contribute to their
problems."
(Dr. Rosenberg's final report will give a full justification
for these preliminary conclusions.)
Although academic problems constitute the major area
of complaint, there has been an increase of 50% over last
year in problems concerning financial aid. The Office of
Financial Aid is clearly under heavy pressure and. no
doubt, will continue to be. Students are easily upset by
delays in aid applications, for example and. rightly or
wrongly, attribute them to inefficiency and to insensitivity
to their problems. Despite the increase in aid problems,
responses to enquiries from this office have been positive.
The pressures so clearly reflected in student life are
matched by different pressures in other constituencies of
the university. The most pervasive problem appears to be a
failure of communication in the various hierarchical
organizations that compose the university's total structure.
The failure of communication it- from "top" to "bottom" and
vice versa. This mav be indigenous to all hierarchical

organizations, but it can varv in degree and can be
mitigated by various means.
The most pervasive effect of breakdown in com
munication is discontent and low morale. It appears to this
office that many personnel and academic staff problems
result from this common institutional failure. This became
evident in some of the claims on which the recent effort to
organize nonacademic personnel were based. In response,
the President's Administrative Council has asked John
Schwartz, University Counsel, and Rob Parker, director of
personnel, to establish a task force to look into university
personnel policies and practices.
Among the most difficult problems this office has to face
are cases of sexual harassment. These increased over
previous years, which may be due to the general public
attention to the matter and. more particularly, to the new
university policy issued last January.
The expression, "sexual harassment," is broadly
defined in the policy as follows: . . it may be described as
repeated and unwanted sexual behavior, such as physical
contact and verbal comments or suggestions, which ad
versely affect the working or learning environment." The
Ombudsman is required to respond to and to resolve in
formally, insofar as this is possible, any charge of sexual
harassment. This particular provision may account for the
increased involvement of this office in these unpleasant and
often delicate problems.
Some problems brought to the Ombudsman's office are
recognized by the complainant to be unlikely of resolution.
This reflects rather a desire to express a concern in con
fidence and independent of the situation to which the
matter refers. More importantly, positive suggestions, and
not simply complaints, are often offered in these interviews,
and these suggestions can be referred to appropriate
persons without the complainant being involved. The
Ombudsman's office should be and is much more than a
bureau of complaints.
Honor Code Problems
Both faculty and students bring to this office questions
about the Honor Code, its interpretation, and procedures in
cases of suspected violations. Although this information is
available in various university publications, these enquiries
often reflect a need to discuss a troublesome situation with
someone entirely apart from the issue concerned.
This is especially true of students who have observed or
know of a violation: the "third-party responsibility"
requirement immediately arises. The Code requires, if
informal procedures fail, that students initiate "formal
procedures." Faculty who detect or suspect a violation has
occurred must report the incident to the office of the
University Counsel. John Schwartz, for his decision to press
charges or not. This is presumably the pattern to be
followed by students who know of or suspect an Honor Code
violation. There is serious need for an interpretation of this
requirement other than the one implied.
For many students this procedure is very difficult if not
impossible to follow. If the requirement were interpreted to
mean that students should report a violation to the in
structor or other appropriate person for discussion and
appraisal, the "third-party 'â€¢esponsibilty" should then be
considered fulfilled. It would be up to the instructor or
appropriate person to initiate the formal procedures as
described above if that were called for.
If this interpretation were made explicit, it would
recognize what is sometimes the practice and what is much
more practicable as an interpretation of student respon
sibility under the Code. It is recommended that the
President's Honor Code Commission examine this
possibility.
It is also important to examine the responsibility that
Resident Assistants have with regard to enforcing the Code.
Resident Assistants are usually registered studdents and. at
the same time, members of the Student Affairs staff. This
dual status confuses the basis of their responsibility, and it
may be desirable to make it clear that their primary
responsibilities are derivative from their status as students

bound by the Fundamental Standard and the Honor Code.
Conflict of interest can arise if Resident Assistants are
asked to perform functions for which regular staff are
responsible. Discussion is now underway to clarify this
issue.
Academic Staff
It is especially gratifying to this office that a Committee
on Academic Staff Affairs, recommended by the Committee
on Committees of the Faculty Senate, is being established by
the President. The charge to this committee covers many of
the problems that concern librarians and lecturers. These
two groups carry on very valuable functions in the
University, but individuals from both groups have ex
pressed dissatisfaction with regard to their status, staff
benefits and, especially, the failure of supervisory per
sonnel to appreciate their contribution to the development
of the library and to teaching.
From the perspective of this office, the problems often
arise, as suggested above, from a failure of communication
between some of the academic staff and their supervisors.
The result is poor morale and discouragement. With regard
to the library situation, it is encouraging that a serious
survey of the library organization is now underway. It is,
however, discouraging to note at this writing that the low
morale and frustration of lecturers in the Department of
French and Italian, although acknowledged by the chair
man, remains unchanged even after some efforts to improve
the situation.
Staffing of the Ombudsman's Office
As a result of a study commenced two years ago con
cerning the status of medical students and house staff in the
School of Medicine, it was recommended that an Associate
Ombudsman be appointed to attend to the special problems
of medical students and house staff.
As discussions of the proposals progressed, it was
decided to include in the responsibility of the new office
postdoctoral fellows and university employees of the
Medical Center. Faculty and academic staff will be served
by either the University Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for
the Medical Center as seems most appropriate. In order to
carry out these functions Vice-President Crowley agreed
that an Associate Ombudsman for the Medical Center
should be appointed.
Following the recommendation of a search committee.
Dr. Crowley nominated to President Kennedy Dr. Allen
Barbour for the position. Dr. Barbour was subsequently
appointed by the President to take office on September 1,
1981. This is a very desirable development: the appointment
of Dr. Barbour brings a new and valuable resource to the
University.
Mrs. Leah Kaplan, as special assistant to the Om
budsman, and Mrs. Sara Stephenson, as administrative
assistant have given strong support to the office and will
continue to do so next year. In addition, a number of student
volunteers served as student assistants to the Ombudsman.
They were sources of information for other students about
the Ombudsman's function as well as sensitive sources of
information concerning student attitudes and problems.
This remarkably able and interested group deserve special
acknowledgement. It is hoped that students will volunteer
again next year.
Despite the annoyances the office of Ombudsman may
cause by enquiries and occasional criticism of a procedure
or situation, responses throughout the University to
requests for information or justification concerning some
practice are readily forthcoming. It is especially important
that administrative officers respond, as they do, to
enquiries from this office. Without cooperation from all
quarters the office of Ombudsman could not be effective. It
is, therefore, gratifying to report that this cooperation
exists, and is appreciated.
