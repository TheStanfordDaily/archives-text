### David Schmelzer 
[at Benatar
)akland Auditorium
7 October 1981

I It was a miserable night in a miserable
Irea in a miserable auditorium with a mi
serable sound system and a miserable
Bpening act. You talk about having your
l-ork cut out for you â€” Pat Benatar's was
|ut, bronzed, and stuck on a wall some
where.
[She tried, she really did, but she never
hreatened to make the concert a memo
able one. One would guess that Benatar
vould be great in a concert movie. She'd
tome out and stop the show with a slam-
Lang "you-done-me-wrong-but-l-can
lake-it" number and then fade away to
[booming cheers. But her act didn't hold up
[over a full concert because she showed
[herself as strictly one-dimensional. After a
[while it got difficult to distinguish "You
[Better Run"from "Hit Me With Your Best
|Shot," or to separate either from "Heart
breaker" or "Tough Life" There were no
ballads, no upbeat rockers, no blues, just
one driving "tough broad" song after an
other.
Benatar's sound system did its best to
eradicate even the little variety she did
have in her music. Of course, any system
would sound terrible in the Oakland
Auditorium. The place should stick to
holding pig-judging contests, rodeos, ice
skating competitions, Austrian drinking
challenge matches, or whatever the heck it
was built for, because it's no place for a
concert. Any sound from the stage causes a
vibration loud enough to obscure the
sound itself. When the band started crank
ing up the pedal-steel guitars, one felt it
was just a matter of time before the roof
went.
Perhaps the only logical way for Benatar
and her band to combat this was to drop
the volume on their instruments and let
her voice carry the show. She's a talented
singer anyway, and that at least would have
made for an interesting evening. But pre
dictably, what they did was turn up the in
struments and drown out anything that
might have been music under better cir
cumstances. But then again, it was a distor
tion fan's dream. Pat's boyfriend/lead
guitarist, Neil Geraldo, played in
terminable solos ad nauseum, although
they had an element of comedy to them
because in each case it was impossible to
distinguish one note from the next. The
funniest bit of the night, however, was
when Benatar announced to an excited

crowd that the concert was being rec
orded for an upcoming live album. Un
doubtedly it'll be railed Noise.
She does have a feel for theatrics,
though, and she moves well on stage, man
aging to look windblown and breathless
every time she goes back to the micro
phone. True, she has only a very limited
repertoire of moves and once she arrived
at the microphone, all the sound system
would usually let the listener hear was
some unintelligible belting, but why quib
ble? She has a good stage presence.
Last Tuesday she also had an audience
that had been through a lot. First, most
were soaked through to their shorts after
having been caught in the season's first big
downpour. A lot of people were undoub
tedly wondering about their safety after
having seen, among other things, four
guys out front (one with a bat) chasing af
ter an old man, and after having ques
tioned just how good the security was in
side where men were wandering up to
people offering 'shrooms and hashish
even though arena personnel had put ev
eryone entering through a body search
and a metal detector. Most of the crowd
was probably put off by Geraldo's amazing
lack of sense as he said "How about those
Raiders?" (who had lost 4 of 5) and "How
about those Yankees?" (who had just
beaten the A's). But, more than anything
else, the audience seemed to be sick of
David Johansen.
They had every right to be. Frorn what he
showed in Oakland, Johansen, the open
ing act, has neither talent nor modesty. He
and his band would trudge through
pointless, over-amplified rock, and then
he'd speak to the audience in a tone sug
gesting how damn lucky they were to be
seeing someone that good. Most ev
erything he said.was a plug for an album,
and he never showed any sign that he was
enjoying himself at all onstage. By the end
of his last song, about half of the people on
the arena floor were holding up their arms
and flipping him off. He stuck to his act,
though, shouting "Thank you" to an au
dience that was almost unanimously
booing him. Benatar had the crowd sit
through a forty minute break between
acts, probably just to let them cool down.
Once she did come out, she did what
she could to give the people a decent
show, but everybody still would have been
better off bringing along headphones and
some tapes of her music to play as she
moved on stage. They might have lost
some of the energy, but at least they would
have heard the songs.
