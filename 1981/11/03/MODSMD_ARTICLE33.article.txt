# Albie Sachs: eye of the storm

The Eureka Theatre Company, which was
scheduled to open its latest production on
October 16, used to be located in the base
ment of 1 rinity Methodist Church on Market
Street. On October 11, their theatre was com
pletely destroyed by a four-alarm fire. Since
then, many other Bay Area theatre com
panies have come to their aid by holding ben
efit performances. The Eureka has still not
found a newspace, but the Magic Theatre has
donated one of its stages for the current play:
The jail Diary uf Albie Sachs by David Edgar.
David Edgar has become well-known re
cently as the adaptor of Nicholas Nickleby,
the BVi-hour extravaganza on tour from the
Royal Shakespeare Company. Heisalsofamil-

iar to local audiences as the author of Mary
Barnes, which the Eureka Theatre presented
in the spring.
The fail Diary of Albie Sachs, adapted from
the book of the same title, is set in South
Africa in 1963. A true story, it is about Albert
Louis Sachs, a white Jewish lawyer in the anti
apartheid movement, who was placed in
solitary confinement under the 90-Day law.
Under this law, any person could be im
prisoned for 90 days without being charged
or brought to trial. Although the sentence
was technically limited, a person could be im
mediately re-arrested, so that in effect it was
possible to detain dissidents indefinitely.
Sachs, although hardly carved from the
Charlton Heston mold, became a folk hero by
surviving nearly six months in solitary con
finement without giving in to his inter
rogatois. He was soft-spoken and person
able, but he stubbornly refused to answer any
questions, even about his age or where he
went to school. However, he was able to
make friends with his jailers by telling jokes
and listening to their stories, and this helped
to ease his isolation and boredom.
The play follows Sachs' book closely, but is
necessarily condensed. This improves the
story. The play emphasizes the images of

solitary confinement, allowing our imagina
tions to fill in many details, whereas the book
is often over-written. It is still quite long —
about three hours — but now the minor char
acters become more important.
I his is significant, since the minor charac
ters are much more interesting than Albie
Sachs. The quality that helped Sachs to sur
vive in prison — his overall niceness — is not
the sort of quality that excites an audience.
The interrogators and guards — with their
bigotry, stupidity, cruelty, and their clumsy
sociability — give much more life to the play.
Albie Sachs is played by Richard Seyd. Dur
ing the play, he alternates between solilo
quies, dialogues, and addresses to the au
dience. He is impressive when with other

characters: he blends into the scenes and
does not attempt to upstage the other actors.
When alone on stage, he is not so effective.
Seyd is then portentious, trying to make lines
like "It is 8 a.m." sound monumental.
The best performance is by Drew Eshelman
as Warrant Officer Snyman. Snyman is an
Afrikaaner and a former Nazi who becomes
Albie's closest friend in prison. Snyman talks
to him endlessly about the Bible, and about
how it supports apartheid. He tries to appear
knowledgable and confident, but is actually
very confused. Eshelman's performance con
veys the bravado and insecurity which are
ever-present in this character.
In a couple of smaller roles, Jack Shearer is
able to establish character quickly. As
Rossouw, one of the friendlier interrogators,
his somewhat menacing appearance con
trasts nicely with his behavior. Thanks should
also go to Terry Hunter for the sound design
which includes some fascinating pieces of
African music. The direction is by Oskar Eustis
and Anthony Taccone.
(The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs plays Thurs
day-Sunday through December 6 at The Mag
ic Theatre, Building D, Fort Mason, San Fran
cisco. Call 441-8822 for reservations.)

Albie's closest friend in prison. Snyman talks
to him endlessly about the Bible, and about
how it supports apartheid. He tries to appear
knowledgable and confident, but is actually
very confused. Eshelman's performance con
veys the bravado and insecurity which are
ever-present in this character.
In a couple of smaller roles, Jack Shearer is
able to establish character quickly. As
Rossouw, one of the friendlier interrogators,
his somewhat menacing appearance con
trasts nicely with his behavior. Thanks should
also go to Terry Hunter for the sound design
which includes some fascinating pieces of
African music. The direction is by Oskar Eustis
and Anthony Taccone.

Sachs.
The Eureka Theatre Company, which was
scheduled to open its latest production on
October 16, used to be located in the base
ment of 1 rinity Methodist Church on Market
Street. On October 11, their theatre was com
pletely destroyed by a four-alarm fire. Since
then, many other Bay Area theatre com
panies have come to their aid by holding ben
efit performances. The Eureka has still not
found a newspace, but the Magic Theatre has
donated one of its stages for the current play:
The jail Diary uf Albie Sachs by David Edgar.
David Edgar has become well-known re
cently as the adaptor of Nicholas Nickleby,
the BVi-hour extravaganza on tour from the
Royal Shakespeare Company. Heisalsofamil-

iar to local audiences as the author of Mary
Barnes, which the Eureka Theatre presented
in the spring.
The fail Diary of Albie Sachs, adapted from
the book of the same title, is set in South
Africa in 1963. A true story, it is about Albert
Louis Sachs, a white Jewish lawyer in the anti
apartheid movement, who was placed in
solitary confinement under the 90-Day law.
Under this law, any person could be im
prisoned for 90 days without being charged
or brought to trial. Although the sentence
was technically limited, a person could be im
mediately re-arrested, so that in effect it was
possible to detain dissidents indefinitely.
Sachs, although hardly carved from the
Charlton Heston mold, became a folk hero by
surviving nearly six months in solitary con
finement without giving in to his inter
rogatois. He was soft-spoken and person
able, but he stubbornly refused to answer any
questions, even about his age or where he
went to school. However, he was able to
make friends with his jailers by telling jokes
and listening to their stories, and this helped
to ease his isolation and boredom.
The play follows Sachs' book closely, but is
necessarily condensed. This improves the
story. The play emphasizes the images of

solitary confinement, allowing our imagina
tions to fill in many details, whereas the book
is often over-written. It is still quite long —
about three hours — but now the minor char
acters become more important.
I his is significant, since the minor charac
ters are much more interesting than Albie
Sachs. The quality that helped Sachs to sur
vive in prison — his overall niceness — is not
the sort of quality that excites an audience.
The interrogators and guards — with their
bigotry, stupidity, cruelty, and their clumsy
sociability — give much more life to the play.
Albie Sachs is played by Richard Seyd. Dur
ing the play, he alternates between solilo
quies, dialogues, and addresses to the au
dience. He is impressive when with other

characters: he blends into the scenes and
does not attempt to upstage the other actors.
When alone on stage, he is not so effective.
Seyd is then portentious, trying to make lines
like "It is 8 a.m." sound monumental.
The best performance is by Drew Eshelman
as Warrant Officer Snyman. Snyman is an
Afrikaaner and a former Nazi who becomes
Albie's closest friend in prison. Snyman talks
to him endlessly about the Bible, and about
how it supports apartheid. He tries to appear
knowledgable and confident, but is actually
very confused. Eshelman's performance con
veys the bravado and insecurity which are
ever-present in this character.
In a couple of smaller roles, Jack Shearer is
able to establish character quickly. As
Rossouw, one of the friendlier interrogators,
his somewhat menacing appearance con
trasts nicely with his behavior. Thanks should
also go to Terry Hunter for the sound design
which includes some fascinating pieces of
African music. The direction is by Oskar Eustis
and Anthony Taccone.
