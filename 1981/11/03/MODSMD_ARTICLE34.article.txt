Saudis push peace plan
Jidda, Saudi Arabia — Crown Prince Fahd said yes
terday the Camp David peace process has reached a
"dead end" and urged the United States to support an
independent Palestinian state governed by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
"There is no peace without the Palestinian people
and there is no Palestinian state without the PLO," he
said in a statement clarifying the eight-point Mideast
peace plan he announced Aug. 7.
Fahd's latest remarks, carried by the official Saudi
Press Agency and the state-run radio, also left the
door open for Soviet participation in the peace proc
ess he proposes.
Fahd called his plan a "balanced, reasonable alter
native" to the Camp David formula which produced
the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel but has so
far failed to achieve agreement on self-rule for
Palestinians living in Israeli-occupied territory.
President Ronald Reagan, in an interview in the
current Time magazine, reaffirmed his adminis
tration's commitment to the Camp David accords but
suggested the framework include other Arab states
besides Egypt.
Reagan told reporters in Washington last week that
"the most significant part (of the Saudi blueprint) is
the fact that they recognize Israel as a nation to be ne
gotiated with."
Fahd's statements suggested that Saudi Arabia was
filling out the peace plan to allay PLO fears and si
lence criticism by pro-Soviet leftist Arab states before
the Arab summit Nov. 25 in Fez, Morocco.
The original plan did not refer to Yasser Arafat's
PLO. This apparently accounted for reservations
voiced by some of Arafat's senior aides and denuncia
tions by radical guerrilla factions.
Fahd said his hope for a favorable U.S. response
does not mean he takes lightly the role of the Soviet
Union in Middle Eastern affairs.
He said the points in his plan not covered by the
Camp David process include Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza strip and
Syria's Golan Heights.
As in his original outline of the plan, Fahd made no
direct reference to Israel's right to live in peace. In the
clarification, however, Fahd referred to "all the
states" in the area instead of merely "the states" as he
had said previously. Observers said the inclusion
might have some significance.
Begin denounces Saudi proposal
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin
asked his political opposition yesterday to join him in
fighting Saudi Arabia's Mideast peace plan, which he
called a prescription for Israel's liquidation.
Speaking in Parliament, Begin rejected "from start
to finish" the eight-point plan proposed by Saudi
Crown Prince Fahd, and admonished the United
States and Europe not to consider it as a basis for ne
gotiation.
Begin blasted Saudi Arabia as "the petrodollar
state, where the darkness of the Middle Ages reigns,
with the cutting off of hands and heads, with corrup
tion that cries out to high heaven."
"Those eight points cannot serve as any basis for
any discussion whatsoever. They are rejected from
start to finish. There is no party in the world with
whom we will be ready to conduct discussions on a
plan designed for Israel's liquidation."
Officials said the Israeli embassy in Washington has
printed up thousands of copies of a position paper on
the plan. Begin's aides leaked the contents of a letter
the pritne minister wrote to President Ronald Reagan
on Friday, and the prime minister appeared on a U.S.
television interview program Sunday to explain the Is
raeli position.
Begin said clauses in the Fahd plan calling on Israel
to evacuate territory captured in 1967 and advocating

a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital were
aimed at strangling Israel.
He rejected American assertions that a clause af
firming "the right of states in the region to live in
peace" implies recognition of Israel because it does
not mention the Jewish state by name.
Draft refusal rate new record
Washington — Almost one-fourth of the nation's
18-year-old men required to register for the draft this
year have failed to do so, Selective Service Director
Thomas Turnage said yesterday.
Turnage, a retired general, said he is "guardedly
optimistic" that the 300,000 violators will register
before the year ends.
Barry Lynn, former leader of a coalition of national
organizations fighting draft registration and currently
president of an anti-draft information group, Draft
Action, asserted yesterday that the figures confirm re
sistance is deepening.
"People who are supposed to register are uncon
vinced that it's an important obligation of
citizenship," Lynn said. They believe, he said, that
President Ronald Reagan "is serious about getting rid
of registration, so why bother to register?"
Reagan said during his campaign that he was op
posed to compulsory registration and the draft. But
he has stuck with the registration requirement im
posed by former President Jimmy Carter.
The failure of thousands to register is increasing
pressure on Reagan to make a definitive statement on
the issue. Selective Service officials believe that such a
statement may come next month after the president
has reviewed a report from his Task Force on Military
Manpower.
The Selective Service said its latest figures show that
1,336,000 men born in 1963 were supposed to register
as of Sept. 1 and that 1,029,000, or 77 percent, did so.
Turnage confirmed that as the largest number of vio
lators in one year since Selective Service began keep
ing detailed records.
Including the 307,000 men born in 1963 who have
failed to register, refusals among those born from
1960-62 have brought the total of violators to 800,000,
officials said.
Swedes interrogate sub captain
Stockholm — The Soviet Union allowed the com
mander of a submarine stranded deep inside Swedish
waters to be questioned yesterday and Swedish
tugboats refloated the sub to prevent bad weather
from battering the vessel apart.
Sweden at first insisted that a satisfactory explana
tion for the sub's presence in restricted Swedish wa
ters would be required before it could be taken off
the rocks close to the Karlskrona naval base where it
ran aground last Tuesday. The Swedes said the sub
was equipped as a spy ship.
Soviet Ambassador Mikhail Vakovlev earlier in the
day informed the Foreign Ministry that his govern
ment had approved interrogation of the skipper, pav
ing the way for a solution to the nearly week-long im
passe.
But while the sub's skipper was being questioned
aboard a Swedish naval vessel, its assistant com
mander sent distress signals to naval headquarters at
Karlskrona.
Winds as high as 80 mph were recorded in the area.
Two tugboats completed the salvage operation in
less than an hour, and the submarine was anchored
about 10 miles from the naval base. Naval staff officer
Borje Johansson said the submarine's seaworthiness
had yet to be determined.
Swedish authorities, saying the sub was specially
modified for intelligence missions and skilled maneu
vering was required for it to get into the off-limits
zone, had stated that an apology alone would not be
sufficient.

The skipper, Lt. Crndr. Pyotr Gushin, had said he
could not leave the submarine or hand over log docu
ments until he received permission from his superiors
at Kalingrad naval base.
The interrogation took place aboard a Swedish
naval ship, with a second session scheduled aboard
the submarine. Two Soviet diplomats were allowed to
attend.
At a news conference, Sweden's commander-in
chief Lennart Liung said the Soviets had agreed to an
inspection of the sub's navigational equipment, nau
tical charts and duty lists.
The Soviets agreed last week not to refloat the sub
themselves, and on Saturday the Foreign Ministry an
nounced it had received the Soviet ambassador's for
mal regrets that the submarine "had entered Swedish
territorial waters and a military restricted zone."
Astronauts arrive at Cape
Cape Canaveral — Joe Engle and Richard Truly ar
rived at the Cape yesterday, eager and ebullient, and
said they are "more than ready" for mid-week launch
of the space shuttle Columbia. The ship, on Launch
Pad 39A, was pronounced as tit as the crew.
If the countdown continues well and the weather
cooperates, the shuttle will blastoff at 7:30 a.m. EST
tomorrow and become the first ship returning to
space a second time.
Before leaving Houston, the astronauts passed a
half-hour physical examination yesterday at Johnson
Space Center. Things were going so well for Colum
bia on the launch site that some tasks were moved
ahead in the schedule to get them out of the way.
Columbia will carry Air Force Col. Engle and Navy
Capt. Truly high above Earth at 17,000 mph for five
days and 83 orbits.
The astronauts were smiling, relaxed and obviously
in a happy frame of mind.
The launch day weather forecast was in the accep
table range, with scattered clouds, winds of 12 mph
and visibility at 7 miles. Rainfall and high crosswinds
were the biggest worries.
If it rains tomorrow, after super-cold fuels have
been loaded into Columbia's huge external fuel tank,
the flight would have to be delayed at least two days.
The moisture could freeze on the outside of the tank
and chunks of ice could vibrate off at blastoff to dam
age the vehicle.
The astronauts' schedule today called for a 5:30
a.m. breakfast, a sunrise visit to the launch pad, and a
few hours doing emergency landing practice in a
plane that handles like the Columbia. They'll go to
bed early and will be awakened at 2:40 a.m. on launch
morning.
The Columbia is scheduled to land next Monday at
Edwards Air Force Base in California.
The 49-year-old Engle and the 43-year-old Truly are
rookies to space, although together they count 31
years as astronauts. But they have experience in the
space shuttle, twice landing the unpowered En
terprise after it was launched from atop a 747 trans
port.
Walesa appeal ends wildcat strikes
Warsaw — The country's stubborn wave of strikes
appeared to ease yesterday, although three of the
longest-running disputes continued and a new con
flict emerged over disputed remarks ettributed to a
Solidariy free trade union leader.
The biggest breakthrough came in Tarnobrzeg, an
industrial province insouthern Poland, where 120,000
workers who had been on strike since Oct. 23 agreed
to go back to work after a personal appeal by Solidar
ity leader Lech Walesa.
That cut by nearly one half the number of Polish
workers involved in wildcat strikes, which have been
condemned both by Solidarity and the government.
Over the weekend, the Polish parliament demanded

that strikes end and threatened to pass emergency
legislation to force the end of the walkouts if workers
ignored the warning.
The Tarnobrzeg strike was perhaps the most sensi
tive of all the wildcat walkouts, since it involved sulfur
mines and what the government had termed defense
production. The sulfur is used in fertilizer, among
other products, and Poland exports fertilizer to the
Soviet Union.
The workers left their jobs over poor food supplies
and the alleged incompetence of local authorities.
Provincial Solidarity leaders stressed yesterday that
the protest was being suspended pending nego
tiations between the union's national leaders and the
government.
Walese visited Tarnobrzeg yesterday for talks with
local union leaders and a rally. The Solidarity leader
had previously visited two other strike centers —
Zyrardow, a textile center near Warsaw, and Zielona
Gora in southwest Poland.
Those two areas, as well as a coal mine in
Sosnowiec, remained on strike yesterday. The
Sosnowiec walkout involves a mysterious incident in
which unidentified persons threw vials of a toxic
chemical into a crowd of people near the mine gate
several days ago, injuring dozens. Both local author
it es and Solidarity have charged the attack was a prov
ocation by the other side.
Union chapters in a number of other towns, includ
ing Szczecin, Koszalin and Opole, meanwhile, called
off scheduled strikes this week in response to Solidar
ity's call for an end to such protests.
Market continues strong rally
New York — The stock market kept its pre-Hallow
een rally rolling at full speed yesterday, rising sharply
in the heaviest trading in more than seven months.
Energy stocks paced the advance for the second
straight session following Mobil Corporation's bid for
Marathon Oil on Friday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
14.27 to 866.82 on top of Friday's 19.60-point gain.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached 65.10
million shares, up from 58.56 million Friday and the
heaviest total since a 66.40 million-share day on
March 24.
Numerous large banks across the country reduced
their prime lending rates Monday from 18 to 17V2 per
cent, amid forecasts of more cuts soon in the basic
charge on blue-chip loans.
Today's Weather
Fair and mild, chance of local fog around sunrise.
Lows in the upper 40s and 50s. Highs in the 70s to low
80s. Light winds.
