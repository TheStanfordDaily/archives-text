# Next conference to be held here
## Affirmative action programs reviewed 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Top affirmative action officers here
met recently with officials from the
Ivy League at Princeton University to
discuss affirmative action policies
and strategies. At that time it was de
cided that Stanford will host the next
Ivy League Conference on Af
firmative Action in January.
"It seemed to me that affirmative
action is much more of an in
ternalized value here than it is at oth
er institutions," said Cecilia Burciaga,
assistant provost, who works with the
Albert Hastorf, vice president and
provost, on faculty affirmative action
matters here.
"I don't by any means want to
sound like 'we've done it,' but I did
feel more positive about coming
back here," Burciaga said. "We are
not so much concerned with the fed
eral government, but with our own
diversity," she said.
"Because we assume that educa
tional excellence in part stems from
diversity, we say we value diversity
for its own sake," said Santiago
Rodriguez, the University's af
firmative action officer. Rodriguez is
responsible for implementation of
Equal Employment Opportunity
Guidelines and for the development
and implementation of "a mean
ingful affirmative action program"
here. His office handles staff and
management directly, but is only in
directly responsible for faculty af
firmative action, which is under
Hastorf's jurisdiction.
The term "affirmative action"
means different things to different

people, according to Rodriguez. He
said it is important to distinguish be
tween the federal employment
guidelines of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC),
which he characterized as a "passive
policy of non-discrimination," and
affirmative action, which he called an
"aggressive progratn that has to be
temporary."
"In the public's mind these two
concepts have been blended,"
Rodriguez said. He also said af
firmative action is "race and sex con
scious, not race and sex neutral, as
opposed to EEO."
Rodriguez explained that it is the
task of his office to determine when
EEO should be used and when af
firmative action is to be used and to
make the two "dove-tail."
The University employs an af
firmative, aggressive approach to the
recruitment* of women and minor
ities, but uses strictly objective
criteria when making hiring de
cisions, said Rodriguez.
"By concentrating on particular
groups you run the risk of stere
otyping. You also have the problem
of conflict between the rights of
groups and the rights of individuals,"
said Rodriguez, pointing out some of
the concerns of his office. "You make
people more aware of ethnocentrici
ty," he said.
Rodriguez also noted that job
criteria are often based on tradition,
habit and convenience, although
they may be intended to be objec
tive. "Subjective notions impede the
process," he said, but added that
criteria are more objective than ever
before.
"The federal government has said
'this is the ill, you figure out the rem
edies,' " Burciaga said, referring to
the federal government's position on
unequal employment of minorities
and women. "Some people believe
that the federal government has got
ten too far into the remedy stage. I
happen to think it hasn't gone far
enough," Burciaga said.
Referring to the conference at
Princeton, she said, "There was the

general feeling that the federal gov
ernment is not doing its job well re
garding follow-up."
Although several top adminis
trators agreed that there is a sincere
desire to expand the representation
of women and minorities on the fac
ulty, they pointed out that the
statistics regarding promotion and
appointment to tenure do not reflect
a successful program, especially in
regard to women.
In 1980, only 4.93 percent of
tenured professors were women.
This figure is up from 4.45 percent the
previous year and 3.55 percent in
1970. In 1980, 6.09 percent of the
tenured faculty were minorities,
down from 6.64 percent the previous
year and up from 3 percent in 1970.
Promotion to tenure decisions are
made on an individual basis. Each
promotion must be approved by the
department, the dean's office, the
provost's office and the Board of
Trustees. At each of the levels, except
at the trustee level, the individual's
career history is examined and reex
amined.
When an individual is hired to
teach here, the person may be hired
into a tenure or a non-tenure track. If
the individual is hired into a tenure
track, the University must decide
within seven years if it will offer the
individual tenure. The individual
must be notified 14 months before
any decision to terminate takes ef
fect.
"If affirmative action doesn't filter
down to the departments then it
doesn't matter what you're saying at
the top," said Burciaga.
"In a closed room, when people
are voting on these issues, one hopes
they'll vote responsibly and sensibly,
" said Norman Wessels, dean of hu
manities and sciences. "It's a human
institution. We all bring our past his
tories to a situation like this," he said.
"I really haven't detected any foot
dragging or lack of sympathy,"
Wessels said. "By and large, I think
the University can be in a position of
leadership and we can set standards
for private business," he said.

"There's an ever-present tension
here between the goals of affirmative
action and what the actual accounts
are," said Fernando de Necochea, as
sistant provost and adviser to Presi
dent Donald Kennedy on Chicanoaf
fairs. Although de Necochea pointed
to a few recent advances, he said, "It
is still a fact that there is a small per
cent of Chicano faculty and adminis
trative staff at Stanford."
"Among the staff, the recruitment,
retention, and promotion are widely
considered as problems," said de
Necochea.
"Affirmative action should be part
of the expected role of a manager. I
don't think qualifications are the
only thing you should look for," said
Jose Becerra, employment repre
sentative of staff personnel.
"The thing that will really crack the
whole thing open is the women's
movement. Minorities don't have
the clout. If they (women) don't
make it, no one will," Becerra said.
"I think the effort to find women
faculty members is being conducted
in an authentic way, but the fact is
that we just don't have that many,"
Diane Middlebrook, acting dean of
undergraduate studies said. "Af
firmative action is really in some pro
found way about social change,"
Middlebrook said.
"The structure is suited to monitor
ing, not to changing things she
said.
Middlebrook pointed to new
fields of scholarship, such as gender
studies, which, she said, stimulate
criticism and, consequently, change.
"If you affirm the importance of
criticism, you open the way toward
legal processes of social change," she
said.
"I think that the best indicator of
change is not that we've added more
women to the faculty, because we
haven't, but that many women and
some men on the faculty have come
to understand that thinking about
gender is central to thinking about
society. And I would calf that a smaff
revolution," Middlebrook said.

firmative action is to be used and to
make the two "dove-tail."
The University employs an af
firmative, aggressive approach to the
recruitment* of women and minor
ities, but uses strictly objective
criteria when making hiring de
cisions, said Rodriguez.
"By concentrating on particular
groups you run the risk of stere
otyping. You also have the problem
of conflict between the rights of
groups and the rights of individuals,"
said Rodriguez, pointing out some of
the concerns of his office. "You make
people more aware of ethnocentrici
ty," he said.
Rodriguez also noted that job
criteria are often based on tradition,
habit and convenience, although
they may be intended to be objec
tive. "Subjective notions impede the
process," he said, but added that
criteria are more objective than ever
before.
"The federal government has said
'this is the ill, you figure out the rem
edies,' " Burciaga said, referring to
the federal government's position on
unequal employment of minorities
and women. "Some people believe
that the federal government has got
ten too far into the remedy stage. I
happen to think it hasn't gone far
enough," Burciaga said.
Referring to the conference at
Princeton, she said, "There was the

general feeling that the federal gov
ernment is not doing its job well re
garding follow-up."
Although several top adminis
trators agreed that there is a sincere
desire to expand the representation
of women and minorities on the fac
ulty, they pointed out that the
statistics regarding promotion and
appointment to tenure do not reflect
a successful program, especially in
regard to women.
In 1980, only 4.93 percent of
tenured professors were women.
This figure is up from 4.45 percent the
previous year and 3.55 percent in
1970. In 1980, 6.09 percent of the
tenured faculty were minorities,
down from 6.64 percent the previous
year and up from 3 percent in 1970.
Promotion to tenure decisions are
made on an individual basis. Each
promotion must be approved by the
department, the dean's office, the
provost's office and the Board of
Trustees. At each of the levels, except
at the trustee level, the individual's
career history is examined and reex
amined.
When an individual is hired to
teach here, the person may be hired
into a tenure or a non-tenure track. If
the individual is hired into a tenure
track, the University must decide
within seven years if it will offer the
individual tenure. The individual
must be notified 14 months before
any decision to terminate takes ef
fect.
"If affirmative action doesn't filter
down to the departments then it
doesn't matter what you're saying at
the top," said Burciaga.
"In a closed room, when people
are voting on these issues, one hopes
they'll vote responsibly and sensibly,
" said Norman Wessels, dean of hu
manities and sciences. "It's a human
institution. We all bring our past his
tories to a situation like this," he said.
"I really haven't detected any foot
dragging or lack of sympathy,"
Wessels said. "By and large, I think
the University can be in a position of
leadership and we can set standards
for private business," he said.

"There's an ever-present tension
here between the goals of affirmative
action and what the actual accounts
are," said Fernando de Necochea, as
sistant provost and adviser to Presi
dent Donald Kennedy on Chicanoaf
fairs. Although de Necochea pointed
to a few recent advances, he said, "It
is still a fact that there is a small per
cent of Chicano faculty and adminis
trative staff at Stanford."
"Among the staff, the recruitment,
retention, and promotion are widely
considered as problems," said de
Necochea.
"Affirmative action should be part
of the expected role of a manager. I
don't think qualifications are the
only thing you should look for," said
Jose Becerra, employment repre
sentative of staff personnel.
"The thing that will really crack the
whole thing open is the women's
movement. Minorities don't have
the clout. If they (women) don't
make it, no one will," Becerra said.
"I think the effort to find women
faculty members is being conducted
in an authentic way, but the fact is
that we just don't have that many,"
Diane Middlebrook, acting dean of
undergraduate studies said. "Af
firmative action is really in some pro
found way about social change,"
Middlebrook said.
"The structure is suited to monitor
ing, not to changing things she
said.
Middlebrook pointed to new
fields of scholarship, such as gender
studies, which, she said, stimulate
criticism and, consequently, change.
"If you affirm the importance of
criticism, you open the way toward
legal processes of social change," she
said.
"I think that the best indicator of
change is not that we've added more
women to the faculty, because we
haven't, but that many women and
some men on the faculty have come
to understand that thinking about
gender is central to thinking about
society. And I would calf that a smaff
revolution," Middlebrook said.
Top affirmative action officers here
met recently with officials from the
Ivy League at Princeton University to
discuss affirmative action policies
and strategies. At that time it was de
cided that Stanford will host the next
Ivy League Conference on Af
firmative Action in January.
"It seemed to me that affirmative
action is much more of an in
ternalized value here than it is at oth
er institutions," said Cecilia Burciaga,
assistant provost, who works with the
Albert Hastorf, vice president and
provost, on faculty affirmative action
matters here.
"I don't by any means want to
sound like 'we've done it,' but I did
feel more positive about coming
back here," Burciaga said. "We are
not so much concerned with the fed
eral government, but with our own
diversity," she said.
"Because we assume that educa
tional excellence in part stems from
diversity, we say we value diversity
for its own sake," said Santiago
Rodriguez, the University's af
firmative action officer. Rodriguez is
responsible for implementation of
Equal Employment Opportunity
Guidelines and for the development
and implementation of "a mean
ingful affirmative action program"
here. His office handles staff and
management directly, but is only in
directly responsible for faculty af
firmative action, which is under
Hastorf's jurisdiction.
The term "affirmative action"
means different things to different

people, according to Rodriguez. He
said it is important to distinguish be
tween the federal employment
guidelines of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC),
which he characterized as a "passive
policy of non-discrimination," and
affirmative action, which he called an
"aggressive progratn that has to be
temporary."
"In the public's mind these two
concepts have been blended,"
Rodriguez said. He also said af
firmative action is "race and sex con
scious, not race and sex neutral, as
opposed to EEO."
Rodriguez explained that it is the
task of his office to determine when
EEO should be used and when af
firmative action is to be used and to
make the two "dove-tail."

year and up from 3 percent in 1970.
Promotion to tenure decisions are
made on an individual basis. Each
promotion must be approved by the
department, the dean's office, the
provost's office and the Board of
Trustees. At each of the levels, except
at the trustee level, the individual's
career history is examined and reex
amined.
When an individual is hired to
teach here, the person may be hired
into a tenure or a non-tenure track. If
the individual is hired into a tenure
track, the University must decide
within seven years if it will offer the
individual tenure. The individual
must be notified 14 months before
any decision to terminate takes ef
fect.
"If affirmative action doesn't filter
down to the departments then it
doesn't matter what you're saying at
the top," said Burciaga.
"In a closed room, when people
are voting on these issues, one hopes
they'll vote responsibly and sensibly,
" said Norman Wessels, dean of hu
manities and sciences. "It's a human
institution. We all bring our past his
tories to a situation like this," he said.
"I really haven't detected any foot
dragging or lack of sympathy,"
Wessels said. "By and large, I think
the University can be in a position of
leadership and we can set standards
for private business," he said.

"There's an ever-present tension
here between the goals of affirmative
action and what the actual accounts
are," said Fernando de Necochea, as
sistant provost and adviser to Presi
dent Donald Kennedy on Chicanoaf
fairs. Although de Necochea pointed
to a few recent advances, he said, "It
is still a fact that there is a small per
cent of Chicano faculty and adminis
trative staff at Stanford."
"Among the staff, the recruitment,
retention, and promotion are widely
considered as problems," said de
Necochea.
"Affirmative action should be part
of the expected role of a manager. I
don't think qualifications are the
only thing you should look for," said
Jose Becerra, employment repre
sentative of staff personnel.
"The thing that will really crack the
whole thing open is the women's
movement. Minorities don't have
the clout. If they (women) don't
make it, no one will," Becerra said.
"I think the effort to find women
faculty members is being conducted
in an authentic way, but the fact is
that we just don't have that many,"
Diane Middlebrook, acting dean of
undergraduate studies said. "Af
firmative action is really in some pro
found way about social change,"
Middlebrook said.
"The structure is suited to monitor
ing, not to changing things she
said.
Middlebrook pointed to new
fields of scholarship, such as gender
studies, which, she said, stimulate
criticism and, consequently, change.
"If you affirm the importance of
criticism, you open the way toward
legal processes of social change," she
said.
"I think that the best indicator of
change is not that we've added more
women to the faculty, because we
haven't, but that many women and
some men on the faculty have come
to understand that thinking about
gender is central to thinking about
society. And I would calf that a smaff
revolution," Middlebrook said.
