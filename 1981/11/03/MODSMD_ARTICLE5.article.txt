# Dinners in dorms to acquaint professors with students
## 
### Adam Goodman 
More than 125 faculty members
will dine in 34 student residences
tomorrow night as part of the Faculty
Day activities planned by the ASSU
and the Office of Residential Educa
tion.
The ASSU organized the event to
"provide students with the op
portunity to sit down in an out of
class context with professors," ac
cording to Rod Beckstrom, ASSU
senator and coordinator of Faculty
Day. Beckstrom said that almost 300
faculty members had been invited to
dinner by ASSU members.
"A typical complaint here is that
students go through Stanford
without ever getting to know faculty
members," he said. "I hope this
event will give students an op

portunity to get to know some more
faculty members and to talk to
them."
Resident fellows of student resi
dences provided a list of faculty
members they wished to invite for
dinner, and the ASSU then matched
up residences and guests "on a first
ask, first serve basis."
Alice Supton, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs for residential education,
said she "encouraged staff (resident
fellows) to prepare students to take
advantage of the faculty present at
their residences." One way most stu
dent residences will accomplish this
is through receptions for the faculty
members before or after dinner.
Beckstrom said about two-thirds of
the residences will have some type of
reception, such as a sherry hour or a

discussion in a student's room. He
emphasized the need for students to
"be interested in the professors."
"It would be really important for
students to try to eat their dinner at
the time when the professors are
coming," he said.
Beckstrom said Faculty Day ori
ginated from the idea to acquire Uni
versity Food Service meal passes for
faculty members in order to promote
faculty-student interaction. He said
that after Food Service personnel re
fused his request he came up with
the Faculty Day concept.
Beckstrom said the dinners, which
cost $5.85 each, will be paid for by the
ASSU and the offices of Residential
Education and Undergraduate Stud
ies.
