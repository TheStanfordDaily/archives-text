# Corruption troubles Chinese economy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — As China's min
ister of commerce, Wang Lei
felt that fie was entitled to en
tertain his friends to a good
meal every so often at Peking's
renowned Fengze Garden Res
tauiant, and the manager,
acutely conscious that Wang
was his boss, charged only a
fraction of the meal's cost.
But to Chen Aivvu, a young
cook at the restaurant, this was
simply corruption.
Chen complained to the
Communist Party's Discipline
Inspection Commission, and
Wang eventually wrote a pub
lic self-criticism and paid his
ha< k restaurant bills.
Anli-vite campaign
This small scandal, nearly a
year ago, made the sensitive
subject of official corruption a
major issue here, and a na
tional campaign against it is
now exposing bribery on a
grand scale, wholesale abuse of
privilege by officials of all ranks
and hundreds of millions of
dollars in embezzled or misap
propriated public funds.
In eastern China's Shandong
province, the Jinan
Petrochemical Works was
found recently to have di
verted nearly $3 million in
company funds to un
authorized expenditures over

the past three years, largely to
improve the living conditions
of its top officials and staff.
In the southern province of
Guangdong, auditors dis
covered that a total of $13.8 mil
lion had been paid out in
bribes or "gifts" by 2300 dif
ferent enterprises and offices
in the first half of the year to get
raw materials for production,
to make sales, to avoid taxes or
simply to curry favor with high
ly placed officials.
Each day, the official Chinese
press details newly uncovered
cases of corruption throughout
the government, party, in
dustry and commerce, along
with assurances that action is
being taken.
Most cases are on a relatively
small scale but some reflect
abuses that seem to be re
peated again and again across
the country.
In Shanghai, the country's
largest industrial and com
mercial center, an estimated 40
percent of enterprises are
evading state and municipal
taxes, according to the local
newspaper, Wen Hui Bao.
Education officials in six
provinces have been found
helping sons of senior cadres
cheat on the highly com
petitive college entrance ex
aminations, and others have

confessed to taking bribes of
more than a year's salaiy to let
students into top institutes de
spite poor exam marks.
Embezzlement on a large
scale has been repotted in
many industries. A cashier in a
Canton fish products en
terprise was found last month
to have stolen $142,000, rough
ly four lifetime salaries here.
So commonplace is corrup
tion now — "plucking a feather
from a passing goose" or "slick
ing things with grease," as it is
described in Chinese.
Corruption seems to run
equally through the fabric of
everyday life, according to or
dinary Chinese citizens who
complain at length about the
need for "presents" and "con
nections" simply to survive in a
major city here.
When vegetables are in short
supply, usually any time after
October in northern China,
groceiy clerks frequently de
mand and get two or three
cigarettes for setting aside car
rots or potatoes.
Payoffs required
On the other hand, grocers
are victimized by everyone:
health inspectors demanding a
side of pork to certify sanitary
conditions, electricians getting
canned goods and wine for re
pairing meat sliceis and refrig

erators, doctors asking for four
legs of pork to X-ray a worker's
broken arm, leading officials
arranging deliveries of scarce
items and then taking half the
shipment for themselves.
The allocation of housing is
rife with corruption and favor
itism because of the acute
shortage, and "those in charge
live like princess," the Com
munist Party newspaper Peo
ples Daily reported from one
provincial city.
Now, with city residents
buying motorbikes in large
numbers, Beijing officials have
discovered that only eight per
cent of the motorbikes here
are being run on fuel ac quired
legitimately.
"We are learning what the
people had found out long ago
— that over its three cJec ades in
power, the Communist Party
has become corrupt and cor
rupt almost to its core," an ad
viser to the party's Discipline
Inspection Commission said.
"We are also discovering
that uprooting this corruption
is extraordinarily difficult. It
seems to he present ev
erywhere, to have affected ev
erything. Sometimes I think it is
actually stronger than the gov
ernment and the party because
it is so pervasive."
Party officials condemn the
corruption as a political, eco
nomic and social cancer eating
away at the country and call for
a return to the moral rectitude
the communists had when they
c ame to power in 1949.
Hu Yaobang, the new party
chairman and a close associate
of Deng Xiaoping, the patty's
powerful vice chairman, has
made corruption a high-priori
ty target since taking over the
chairmanship in June.
Like most Chinese officials,
he sees it as a throwback to
China's long period of
feudalism when, as one
middle-level official remarked,
"You used your power to ben
efit yourself, your family and
your friends."

c ame to power in 1949.
Hu Yaobang, the new party
chairman and a close associate
of Deng Xiaoping, the patty's
powerful vice chairman, has
made corruption a high-priori
ty target since taking over the
chairmanship in June.
Like most Chinese officials,
he sees it as a throwback to
China's long period of
feudalism when, as one
middle-level official remarked,
"You used your power to ben
efit yourself, your family and
your friends."
Beijing — As China's min
ister of commerce, Wang Lei
felt that fie was entitled to en
tertain his friends to a good
meal every so often at Peking's
renowned Fengze Garden Res
tauiant, and the manager,
acutely conscious that Wang
was his boss, charged only a
fraction of the meal's cost.
But to Chen Aivvu, a young
cook at the restaurant, this was
simply corruption.
Chen complained to the
Communist Party's Discipline
Inspection Commission, and
Wang eventually wrote a pub
lic self-criticism and paid his
ha< k restaurant bills.
Anli-vite campaign
This small scandal, nearly a
year ago, made the sensitive
subject of official corruption a
major issue here, and a na
tional campaign against it is
now exposing bribery on a
grand scale, wholesale abuse of
privilege by officials of all ranks
and hundreds of millions of
dollars in embezzled or misap
propriated public funds.
In eastern China's Shandong
province, the Jinan
Petrochemical Works was
found recently to have di
verted nearly $3 million in
company funds to un
authorized expenditures over

the past three years, largely to
improve the living conditions
of its top officials and staff.
In the southern province of
Guangdong, auditors dis
covered that a total of $13.8 mil
lion had been paid out in
bribes or "gifts" by 2300 dif
ferent enterprises and offices
in the first half of the year to get
raw materials for production,
to make sales, to avoid taxes or
simply to curry favor with high
ly placed officials.
Each day, the official Chinese
press details newly uncovered
cases of corruption throughout
the government, party, in
dustry and commerce, along
with assurances that action is
being taken.
Most cases are on a relatively
small scale but some reflect
abuses that seem to be re
peated again and again across
the country.
In Shanghai, the country's
largest industrial and com
mercial center, an estimated 40
percent of enterprises are
evading state and municipal
taxes, according to the local
newspaper, Wen Hui Bao.
Education officials in six
provinces have been found
helping sons of senior cadres
cheat on the highly com
petitive college entrance ex
aminations, and others have

confessed to taking bribes of
more than a year's salaiy to let
students into top institutes de
spite poor exam marks.
Embezzlement on a large
scale has been repotted in
many industries. A cashier in a
Canton fish products en
terprise was found last month
to have stolen $142,000, rough
ly four lifetime salaries here.
So commonplace is corrup
tion now — "plucking a feather
from a passing goose" or "slick
ing things with grease," as it is
described in Chinese.
Corruption seems to run
equally through the fabric of
everyday life, according to or
dinary Chinese citizens who
complain at length about the
need for "presents" and "con
nections" simply to survive in a
major city here.
When vegetables are in short
supply, usually any time after
October in northern China,
groceiy clerks frequently de
mand and get two or three
cigarettes for setting aside car
rots or potatoes.
Payoffs required
On the other hand, grocers
are victimized by everyone:
health inspectors demanding a
side of pork to certify sanitary
conditions, electricians getting
canned goods and wine for re
pairing meat sliceis and refrig

erators, doctors asking for four
legs of pork to X-ray a worker's
broken arm, leading officials
arranging deliveries of scarce
items and then taking half the
shipment for themselves.
The allocation of housing is
rife with corruption and favor
itism because of the acute
shortage, and "those in charge
live like princess," the Com
munist Party newspaper Peo
ples Daily reported from one
provincial city.
Now, with city residents
buying motorbikes in large
numbers, Beijing officials have
discovered that only eight per
cent of the motorbikes here
are being run on fuel ac quired
legitimately.
"We are learning what the
people had found out long ago
— that over its three cJec ades in
power, the Communist Party
has become corrupt and cor
rupt almost to its core," an ad
viser to the party's Discipline
Inspection Commission said.
"We are also discovering
that uprooting this corruption
is extraordinarily difficult. It
seems to he present ev
erywhere, to have affected ev
erything. Sometimes I think it is
actually stronger than the gov
ernment and the party because
it is so pervasive."
Party officials condemn the
corruption as a political, eco
nomic and social cancer eating
away at the country and call for
a return to the moral rectitude
the communists had when they
c ame to power in 1949.
