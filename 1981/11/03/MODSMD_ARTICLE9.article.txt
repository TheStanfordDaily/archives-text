## Japan rethinks foreign policy on trade limits against USSR 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — The loss of several billion dollars in
potential sales of industrial plants to the Soviet
Union has touched off a feud in government and
business circles here over the wisdom of main
taining Japan's official sanctions against Mos
cow.
Japan imposed restrictions on trade and diplo
matic contacts between the two countries fol
lowing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in De
cember 1979. Since then, the government has
come under mounting pressure to lift these re
straints from Japan's powerful big business es
tablishment, whose leaders want to see chilly re
lations with Moscow put back on a more friendly
— and profitable — basis.
Senior Japanese diplomats have flatly rejected
such a move out of concern that it might strain
relations with Reagan administration officials
commited to tough dealing with the Soviets.

The fapanese chafe over what
they view as European nations'
open disregard of Western
guidelines on trade with the
Soviets, which they claim has
helped fuel a boom in
business with the Eastern Bloc.

They suggested, however, that sticking to the
haid line may become increasingly difficult in
the face of political forces favoring improved So
viet ties.

ficials and on low-interest, government-spon
soied credits used by Japanese exporters to fi
nance trade deals with the Soviets. Tokyo further
angered the Soviets by boycotting the 1980 Sum
mer Olympics in Moscow.
Since then, Japanese traders have lost sizable
Soviet orders on at least 10 major long-tern)
plant projects, each worth more than $100 mil
lion, according to industry analysts here.

Many of the contracts, they said, have gone to
competitors in Western Europe, particularly
France and West Germany. The shift is widely in
terpreted in Japan as a sign of Moscow's retalia
tion for Tokyo's close alignment with Washing
ton on the sanctions issue.
Two weeks ago, Moscow turned down
japanese bids for $1.7 billion worth of gas
pipeline compressor stations in favor of West
German, French and Italian firms, according to
Japanese press reports.
The pipeline project is designed to link the
Urengoy natural gas field in Western Siberia
with the Soviet-Czechoslovak border.
Beneiits for Europe
Diplomatic analysts in Tokyo pointed out that
Japan's Western European rivals had been fa
vored in the bidding because they will also ul
timately figure as major purchasers of the
pipeline's output.
But they said that the Soviets, in apparently
cutting the Japanese out of the deal entirely,
took the opportunity to underscore their dis
satisfaction with Tokyo's policy sanctions.
The Japanese chafe over what they view as Eu
ropean nations' open disregard of Western
guidelines on trade with the Soviets, which they
claim has helped fuel a boom in business with
the Eastern Bloc. According to Japanese
statistics, two-way trade with the Soviet Union in
1980 grew 58 percent in France, 32 percent in Ita
ly and 11 percent in West Germany; the figure
for Japan was six percent.
Hirohide Ishida, who heads the Japan-Soviet
Parliamentary Friendship Association, a group of
conservative members, said, "This is absolute
nonsense." The United States, he said, "is selling
wheat to the Soviets ... . It's clear that the sanc
tions are not effective to settle the Afghan is
sue."
Such sentiments have been bolstered by the
strong support of Japan's Ministry of Interna
tional Trade and Industry.
Ihe bid to improve relations with Moscow,
however, suffered a setback last week when So
viet Education Minister Mikhail Prokofyev
abiuptly canceled a scheduled visit at the invita
tion of Ishida's parliamentary group.
Prokofyev refused to come when Foreign
Ministry officials denied him a regular diplomat
ic visa, offering what amounts to a special tourist
visa instead.

lations with Moscow put back on a more friendly
— and profitable — basis.
Senior Japanese diplomats have flatly rejected
such a move out of concern that it might strain
relations with Reagan administration officials
commited to tough dealing with the Soviets.

The fapanese chafe over what
they view as European nations'
open disregard of Western
guidelines on trade with the
Soviets, which they claim has
helped fuel a boom in
business with the Eastern Bloc.

They suggested, however, that sticking to the
haid line may become increasingly difficult in
the face of political forces favoring improved So
viet ties.
lapanese sane tions
1 he chill between the two countries set in ear
ly last year when, following the Carter adminis
tration's lead, Japan put tight limits on the ex
change of visits by high-level government of
ficials and on low-interest, government-spon
soied credits used by Japanese exporters to fi
nance trade deals with the Soviets. Tokyo further
angered the Soviets by boycotting the 1980 Sum
mer Olympics in Moscow.
Since then, Japanese traders have lost sizable
Soviet orders on at least 10 major long-tern)
plant projects, each worth more than $100 mil
lion, according to industry analysts here.

Many of the contracts, they said, have gone to
competitors in Western Europe, particularly
France and West Germany. The shift is widely in
terpreted in Japan as a sign of Moscow's retalia
tion for Tokyo's close alignment with Washing
ton on the sanctions issue.
Two weeks ago, Moscow turned down
japanese bids for $1.7 billion worth of gas
pipeline compressor stations in favor of West
German, French and Italian firms, according to
Japanese press reports.
The pipeline project is designed to link the
Urengoy natural gas field in Western Siberia
with the Soviet-Czechoslovak border.
Beneiits for Europe
Diplomatic analysts in Tokyo pointed out that
Japan's Western European rivals had been fa
vored in the bidding because they will also ul
timately figure as major purchasers of the
pipeline's output.
But they said that the Soviets, in apparently
cutting the Japanese out of the deal entirely,
took the opportunity to underscore their dis
satisfaction with Tokyo's policy sanctions.
The Japanese chafe over what they view as Eu
ropean nations' open disregard of Western
guidelines on trade with the Soviets, which they
claim has helped fuel a boom in business with
the Eastern Bloc. According to Japanese
statistics, two-way trade with the Soviet Union in
1980 grew 58 percent in France, 32 percent in Ita
ly and 11 percent in West Germany; the figure
for Japan was six percent.
Hirohide Ishida, who heads the Japan-Soviet
Parliamentary Friendship Association, a group of
conservative members, said, "This is absolute
nonsense." The United States, he said, "is selling
wheat to the Soviets ... . It's clear that the sanc
tions are not effective to settle the Afghan is
sue."
Such sentiments have been bolstered by the
strong support of Japan's Ministry of Interna
tional Trade and Industry.
Ihe bid to improve relations with Moscow,
however, suffered a setback last week when So
viet Education Minister Mikhail Prokofyev
abiuptly canceled a scheduled visit at the invita
tion of Ishida's parliamentary group.
Prokofyev refused to come when Foreign
Ministry officials denied him a regular diplomat
ic visa, offering what amounts to a special tourist
visa instead.
