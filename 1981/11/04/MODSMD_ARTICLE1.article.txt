## Senators urge due process for Zetes 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU Senate last night ap
proved a resolution declaring that
the process by which sanctions were
imposed against the Zeta Psi fraterni
ty violated the student rights of indi
vidual members.
Though the senate moved to con
demn the procedures used by the
Office of Residential Education's ad
hoc committee on Zeta Psi fraternity,
which had recommended the sanc
tions, it made no comment on the
merits of the decision to suspend the
fraternity.
According to Dave Phelps, senate
chair, "the senate agrees that the ad
hoc committee did violate certain
procedures as are stipulated in the
(ASSU) constitution." However,
Phelps said "the resolution does not
condone the action of the Zeta Psi
fraternity nor does it comment upon
the decision that was handed down
from the Office of Residential Educa
tion and the . . . committee."
What the resolution does do,
Phelps said, "is to request that the
University adhere to the due judicial
process as it is outlined in the con
stitution of the association, a process
that was neglected by the ad hoc
committee and that requests that a
meeting of the Student Conduct Leg
islative Council be called to address
the policies and procedures by which
student groups are tried and . . . held
responsible, a policy that to this point
doesn't exist."
In its call for protection of student
rights, the ASSU resolution states that
"any process used by the Office of
Residential Education to determine
the sanctions against the Zeta Psi
fraternity be in accordance with the
(ASSU) Constitution and the by-laws
of the Association, and be in the spirit
of the of the
University."
The resolution, drafted by four

senators, also requested that the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
convene and determine guidelines
involving the conduct of student
groups on campus and their rela
tionship with the University.
Tom Allen and Mike Zboralske of
Zeta Psi spoke in the opening
minutes of the senate meeting and
asked the ASSU to see that Zeta Psi's
rights "are ensured." The two Zetes,
along with ASSU Senator Mark Eps
tein, are scheduled this morning to
discuss the Zeta Psi suspension with
University Ombudsman John
Goheen.
On Oct. 30, Zeta Psi was suspended
for three years by the University and
was told that all house members must
move out by Dec. 19. The suspension
followed several years of disciplinary
action and was triggered by the toss
ing of a Mills College student into a
pond at the house Oct. 8.
The suspension decision was made
by Norm Robinson, associate dean of
residential education, who acted on
the recommendations of a five
member, faculty-student committee
which reviewed the Zeta Psi fraterni
ty's conduct.
The senate action follows a letter
written by Zeta Psi members that
charges the Office of Residential
Education and Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons with "violations of
our rights as students at Stanford."
The letter lists violations in the pro
cedures used by the ad hoc Commit
tee on Zeta Psi Fraternity, questions
the judicial authority of the dean of
student affairs as well as the action of
the Office of Residential Education,
petitions the ombudsman to ex
amine the process, and asks for a new
hearing.
"We are basically trying to find out
if we have any method of appeal,"
said Zboralske, Zeta Psi president.
"We want to see if the process is val
id, and if all our rights were looked at
in complete order."
Zboralske said he believes the Uni
versity characterized the Mills Col
lege incident as "an attitude which
occurred within the whole house'
rather than an incident involving
"just two or three guys."
Specifically, the Zeta Psi letter al
leges that the group was not able "to
hear all evidence on which charges
are based, and to answer this evi
dence through rebuttal, to request
that any member of the judicial body
be disqualified because of prejudice,
and to be informed of the above
rights by proper summons.
Lyons said last night that the Fun
damental Standard of the University
applies only to individuals and not to
groups. Contrary to Phelps' assertion
that a University policy regarding
groups "doesn't exist," Lyons said
the University does indeed have such
a policy. Lyons described the policy
of a fraternity such as Zeta Psi as
being "contractual" to the entire
group because "the group is as
signed to the house ratherthan an in
dividual assigned to the house.
"We're not talking about individ
ual conduct but conduct as a group.
It's an administrative decision,"
Lyons said. "In this case we are talk
ing about a privilege and the subse
quent denial of that privilege. The
personal status as a student (as in the
Fundamental Standard) has in no way
been tampered with."
Lyons also described the ad hoc
committee as an advisory committee
and not a judicial body. He Robinson
had the power to make the decision
alone and the committee "was prob
ably unnecessary."
Senate discussion on the matter
was cut short as members agreed to a
vote by roll call. The resolution
passed 11-3 with one abstention.
In other senate action, the senate
approved the appointments of seven
senate associates and five committee
staff assistants.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy and English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger have agreed to be ex
officio faculty members of the sen
ate, Phelps said.
Also at the senate meeting Phelps
extended the ASSU's condolences to
the friends and families of Michael
Becker and Kevin MacMillan, who
were killed in an auto accident on
campus last Friday.
