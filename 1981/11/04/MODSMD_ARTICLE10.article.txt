# GPU provides social support network for community gays
## 
### Jane McConnell 
The Gay People's Union (GPU) is the base for social,
informational and political activities for the Stanford gay
corn m unity. According to GPU member Ray Koskovich,
the organization has three goals: "to provide a social
support network for the gay men and women at Stan
ford; to act as an awareness-raising service for gays; and
to attempt to educate the non-gay community at Stan
ford."
"The social aspect is of the utmost importance," said
Rtiio Hiersch of the GPU. "All other social activities on
campus are directed at straight people. This is the only
place you can go without feeling like you're breaking
down some major social barrier by being gay."
Included within the GPU are both a men's and wom
en's collective, and a faculty and staff group for non-stu
dent gays. The women's collective is associated with the
Stanford Women's Center and the women's movement
on campus.
Also connected with the GPU are the Gay Business and
Gay Law Students associations.
The group is headed by a steering committee, consist
ing of male and female students and faculty. Member
ship is based on attendance at meetings, which are open
to the entire community. Interest, not gender or sexual
orientation, is the only requirement for participation, ac
cording to members.
Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the GPU,
making it the oldest gay organization on the Peninsula,
according to Koskovich. "We're the only completely
public gay organization on the Peninsula, and the largest
gay student organization from San Francisco to San Jose
State," he said.
The group will hold in May its annual Gay Awareness
Week, which Koskovich described as "an aesthetic and
social movement — something of a gay renaissance."
Hiersch added, "We want to remind our straight
friends out there that there are a lot of gay people at
Stanford. Vou can't ignore us."
Almost 1200 students at Stanford are gay, estimated
Hiersch. "About 250 people are involved in the GPU in a

single year," he said. Thirty to 40 of these are regulars, he
said.
The Women's Collective will also hold a Lesbian
Awareness Week this spring, according to steering com
mittee member Sharon Silverstein, an undergraduate
major in feminist studies.
The GPU also hosts speakers and films on topics such
as careers for open gays. Said Hiersch, "We try to get
people who've combined a lifestyle as an open gay with a
career."
Advancement of gay rights
In addition to providing a tension-free social at
mosphere for the gay population at Stanford, GPU also
works to advance gay rights. "We're a single-issue group,
which means we don't support any particular party or
candidate. Instead we take appropriate stands on specif
ic issues," said Koskovich.
Both Koskovich and Hiersch feel that there has been
significant progress made in the area of gay rights in the
almost 10 years of the GPU's existence. "Several of the
University's hiring policies have changed, so that there is
no longer discrimination on the basis of sexual orien
tation," said Koskovich.
However, both Koskovich and Hiersch would like to
see the University adopt a non-discriminatory policy in
admissions. "The University refuses to state publicly that
it will not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation
in admissions, because they say it will harm minority stu
dents," claimed Koskovich.
Along with the GPU there are several other gay sup
port organizations on campus. The Gay Men's Dis
cussion Group is for those new to the gay community.
There are currently 11 members, who meet weekly to
discuss such concerns as dealing with friends and pa
rents, relating to stereotypes, and living in a dorm. There
is also a Gay Men's Support Group.
Other campus organizations
Another campus organization which provides support
for gays is the Gay Counseling Group, based at the
Bridge. Here a staff of students and alumni offers phone

and drop-in counseling for gay students and community
members.
Although the counseling group involves many of the
same people as GPU, the two organizations are separate.
Said Stewart Regis, staffer of the counseling group,
"Many people choose to come here rather than to the
GPU because it's more anonymous here."
Not everyone who uses the service is gay, however.
Said Regis, "We also get a lot of friends and families of
gay people, and we help them to deal with the situ
ation."
In counseling sessions, the staffers try to help the
counselee work with his or her own problem. "We don't
try to convert them. We don't even use the word gay if
they don't," said Regis. "We mostly try to be supportive
and help them deal with their anxiety and sexual de
sires."
Regis continued, "The degree of counseling depends
upon the counselee's needs. If someone is unsure of
their sexuality, it's appropriate to share experiences, and
tell them how we felt when we were coming out."
The counseling group also provides information for
the gay community about parties and places to meet gay
people. "Those just coming out need lots of information,
because they have no idea where to go or what to do,"
said Regis.
Most counselees are of college and high school age,
according to Regis. Of those whousethecounselingser
vice, about 60 percent are students and 40 percent are
community members. About 25 percent of these are
women.
The group employs eight to 15 volunteer staffers.
There is currently only one female staffer.
Volunteers are trained in the Bridge Peer Counseling
class, an intensive 10-week course. They are then eval
uated, first by the Bridge and then by the Gay Counseling
Group. Once evaluated, they work with a costaffer for
awhile before taking their own shift. Most volunteers
work a 1 Vi-hour shift once a week.
The Gay Counseling Group also administers the Gay
Speaker's Bureau, which gives presentations in the

dorms on life as a gay. Panels of two men and two women
distribute a questionnaire before the talks, and then give
the results of the questionnaire, followed by a question
and answer session.
Another gay awareness-raising effort is being made by
Ray Baxter, a broadcasting and film major, who is work
ing on a videotape on gay life at Stanford, to be shown in
the residences this spring. The film will contain in
terviews with gay students about the situations they face
and will describe the resources available to gay students.
Both the Cay Counseling Group and the GPU are
funded entirely by the program fee, which has generally
been approved by the student body in fee assessment
elections. All of CPU's social functions are self-support
ing, through donations.
Student reactions
The fact that the student body has shown general sup
port for GPU's program fee seems to exhibit tolerance, if
not support, for the organization, and on the whole, the
members seem to feel that they are well accepted by oth
er students. "There is very little negative reaction to
GPU," said Koskovich.
"The students here are good bourgeois liberals — they
like to think that they should put up with us," added
Hiersch.
However, Silverstein said, "Some students are really
frightened, especially about having a gay roommate.
There's a lot of ignorance and some hostility."
Because of this, many gay students maintain a low pro
file. Said Koskovich, "A lot of students, especially those
going into, say, med school, are afraid to openly admit to
the fact that they are gay, because they think it will dam
age their chances for success."
However, Koskovich's own experience has been very
positive. "All my colleagues and professors are very sup
portive," he said. "But I remember once, as a freshman,
having to write a story about my first date . . . so I did! The
teacher was shocked."
Silverstein added, "You have to have a lot of self-con
fidence to speak up in class. I try to take classes where I
can write papers from a lesbian perspective."
