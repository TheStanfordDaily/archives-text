## Bill Peatman Shared moral precepts work 
### 
In his recent column (Daily, Oct.
30), Marc Rosaaen raises the often
asked question of whether we should
try to legislate morality. This question
seems a little misguided, for every
law passed legislates morality in that
every law is a formalization of a hu
man's moral responsibility. What a
law does is warn us that some actions
are right and good, and that other ac
tions are wrong and punishable. The
question of whether we have the
right to legislate morality, though, is a
far more intriguing issue, and one
that Rosaaen does not, finally, quite
come to terms with.
In speaking of the right to legislate
morality, one must first ask if there is
any morality to be legislated. If mo
rality exists independently of human
ity — if there is an objective moral
code inscribed in the universe —
then our lawmaking efforts should
be designed to cooperate with this
code. Thus our legislation will be le
gitimate, as it will be based in the na
ture of the world.
On the other hand, if we maintain
that there is no such basis for a moral
structure inherent in the world, then
the door swings open to an entirely
subjective legal system. With no ob
jective moral code, and thus with no
standard by which we can make ethi
cal decisions, it would be silly to call
any sort of behavior good or bad, ex
cept by using criteria, which we
ourselves create.
Rosaaen seems to be arguing for
such a self-made morality when he
says that abortions may be outlawed
only "if a majority thinks that abor
tion is murder." In such a case, the
majority dictates what will be de
emed good, and what will be de
emed evil. So our ethics will be
balloted for us that we may vote on
what should be called right and
wrong — a sort of morality by majori
ty rule.
If this is what we mean by morality,

then I do not think that a government
has the right to legislate it. If I was in
the minority, I would resent a law for
bidding me to do what I desire, for
such a law could not possibly objec
tively rule my desire as being right or
wrong. The law would rather be
based only on the will of the majori
ty; a will that is predominantly self
serving.
Why should 51 people be allowed
to exercise their will, and 49 people
by denied their wishes, only because
the ideas of one group outvote those
of the smaller one? In such a case, I
would feel free to rebel, since I
would not be rebelling against any
objective moral order, but only
against someone else's idea.
As you may have guessed by now,
it is my opinion that there is an objec
tive moral law at work in the world. I
believe that it is only because of this
sort of code that we can expect peo
ple to obey the laws that we make,
and punish people who refuse to
obey these laws.
It has been said that a moral code is
only a system that men conjure up to
protect society. If this were the case,
when the 49 person minority asks (as
it should) "Why shouldn't we please
ourselves instead of making sacrifices
for society?", what can a lawmaker
tell a minority?
The legislators can only tell the mi
nority that "it is best to be unselfish,"
thus appealing to an objective stan
dard of behavior. If people simply
"ought" to be unselfish, this kind of
statement is another fundamental
moral precept that exists independ
ently of the laws that we make.
Rosaaen repeatedly assumes this
kind of moral standard. In his col
umn, Rosaaen consistently judges
certain actions using terms like "rea
sonable," "fair, though harsh," and
"simply not fair." He even makes
technical moral distinctions between
one type of discrimination as "more
unfair" than another; and between

"murder" and "killing" as respec
tively unacceptable and acceptable
modes of taking another person's
life.
Statements like Rosaaen's imply
that we all assume the moral values
that he does — that certain actions
are fair, that fairness is good, etc. Ev
eryone does take such value posi
tions — everyone affirms some ac
tions and objects so good, and some
as bad. If only by participating in life,
we affirm human existence as good.
Such statements are platitudes.
We learn of morality through vari
ous stages of education, just as we
learn the multiplication table and the
laws of physics through education.
That a moral law is learned does not
make it any less real. If we did not
learn physics, gravity would certainly
still exist and apply to us.
To return to the question of
whether we have the right to legislate
morality, I maintain that we do, but
only if we acknowledge a moral stan
dard intrinsic to the world and if we
strive to live in accordance with this
standard. This would give legislators
the right to legislate, as well as held
them responsible to form laws based
not on expediency, but based on an
objective right and wrong.
If there is a moral law, then there
certainly will be consequences suf
fered if we reject it. Why else would
such a law exist? Hence a legislature
can help us to set up a legal code
grounded in the world's moral code.
I do not think that anyone has the
right to legislate morality if it means
the more imposition of popular
ideas. People need not be coerced to
change if their behavior is simply un
fashionable. We have the right to
coerce people to change only if they
aredeemed fundamentally wrong. In
order to know what is fundamentally
wrong, we must know what is fun
damentally right.
