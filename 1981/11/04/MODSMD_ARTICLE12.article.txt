## Vestiges of Weathermen are surfacing

Washington"I —"I think that what
we've seen in Nyack, N.Y., is the tip of
the iceberg. The plans go much
deeper than that. The plans are for
terrorists to upset the government of
the United States."
That was the warning we received
last week in an interview with former
FBI official W. Mark Felt following
the tragic murder of two policemen
and an armed guard during a $1.6 mil
lion bank robbery involving fugitive
members of the radical Weather Un
derground organization.
"I believe the Weather Under
ground has ties with other terrorist
organizations," declared the former
acting associate director of the FBI,
who was found guilty last year of con
spiring to violate the constititutional
rights of Weather Underground
members and their relatives during
the early 1970'5. He was later par
doned by President Ronald Reagan.
While our own anxieties about
American-bred terrorism have been
heightened by the appalling
homicide in Rockland County, N.Y.,
we're watching the official reaction
to the incident with interest. Federal
investigators have already pounced
on evidence of possible links be
tween Weather Underground mem

bers, the Black Liberation Army,
FALN (Puerto Rican nationalists) and
the Irish Republican Army.
Sometime soon, the Reagan ad
minstration and certain members of
Congress are likely to use the Nyack
massacre in arguments for bringing
the CIA back into the surveillance of
domestic radical organizations. Un
der a proposed executive order, the
White House would allow the CIA to
exchange information with the fed
eral, state and local agencies.
Yet, before reopening the door to
domestic spying, both the White
House and Congress should place
the Nyack revelations in an historical
context.
In 1968, the 100-plus member
Weatherman organization was born
on the narrowly held conviction that
only violent acts against the Ameri
can establishment could stop the
Vietnam War. The ensuing campaign
to "Bring the War Home" rsulted in
bombing attacks on bank buildings
and other public places. Although
American citizens were allegedly not
targets, the violence inevitably in
jured innocent people.
Former Weatherman Bo Burl
ingham explained the fringe nature
of the group in the book, "The Six
ties":

We felt like miners trapped in a ter
rible poisonous shaft with no light to
guide us out. We resolved to destroy
the tunnel even if we risked destroy
ing ourselves in the process."
Before long, Burlingham and a ma
jority of his comrades realized that,
whatever their despair over the war,
perpetrating violence at home was
no way to bring about positive
change. They dropped out. But a
small faction would continue their
self-destructive ways under a new
name, the Weather Underground,
and be linked to bombings as late as
1975 (including an explosion in a
bathroom in the U.S. Capitol).
While anti-war leaders took pains
to distance their efforts from those of
the Weather Underground, they had
trouble convincing federal author
ities of the distinction. Intelligence
agents used the pretext of anti-ter
rorism and suspected foreign spon
sorship to investigate large numbers
of Americans who disagreed with the
government's Vietnam policy. As
most everyone should remember,
this far-reaching campaign involved
infiltration of domestic dissident
groups, illegal wiretapping and in
terference with the U.S. mails.

Try as they may, U.S. intelligence
agencies could find no hard links be
tween the anti-war movement and
unfriendly foreign powers. Yet, they
sacrificed the rights of a few in the
name of safeguarding the interests of
the nation.
The reappearance of the Weather
Underground on the front page is
likely to spark claims among CIA and
FBI backers of "I told you so" and re
sult in a return to the intelligence
gathering attitudes of old.
Of course, anyone familiar with
the anti-war movement and current
dissident groups knows that the
Weather Underground is at most a
lunatic cell group that has nosupport
on the left or anywhere else. No one
we know condones the actions of
these homicidal maniacs.
But we should avoid buckling un
der the grisly shock of terrorist
linked murders in Rockland County
and carefully evaluate pending na
tional security plans. After all, the
combined efforts of state and federal
lawmen landed a bounty of sus
pected terrorists without the help of
proposed changes in current federal
law.
