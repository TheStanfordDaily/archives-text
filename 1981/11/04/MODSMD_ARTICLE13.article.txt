## Israelis, Palestinians, must cooperate 
### 
I wholeheartedly agree with
Radwan Shaban (Daily, Oct. 27) when
he says that the Palestinian question
is central to a lasting Middle Fast
peace. At the same time, however, I
feel that he places too much of the
blame for the current stalemate at
the feet of Israel and the United
States.
He points out that the PLO has of
fered several solutions which prom
ise "peace and coexistence" be
tween Arabs and Israelis. But how
can Israel be expected to seriously
entertain such proposals from an or
ganization whose prime objective as
stated in its covenant is the destruc
tion of the State of Israel?
Israel's desire to develop "Palesti
nian self-rule" in the territories, rath
er than a euphemism for "legit
imitized Israeli rule," is an attempt to
initiate more moderate represent
atives for the Palestinians; spokes
people who truly reflect the desires
of the West Bank populace.
Shaban also accused the Zionist
movement of using British colonial
power in the first half of this century
to further their nationalistic goals. If
he would read his history books,
however, he would note that the Brit
ish refused entry to thousands of
jews and harrassed them in every way
possible. It was the Zionist move
ment, as much as anything, which

urged the British to turn the problem
over to the United Nations for a just
solution.
Israel must recognize the Palesti
nian right to self-determination, but
at the same time, the current leader
ship of the Palestinians must recog
nize Israel's right to exist. Only then
can negotiations, based on a clear
understanding of the facts behind
the present situation, begin.

Frats bring out worst
I applaud the decision to suspend
the Zeta Psi fraternity.
Fraternities provide an at
mosphere in which members goad
each other on, leading to behavior
which is offensive, destructive and
occasionally dangerous and criminal.
Social consciousness is lost. Intersex
ual relationships are distorted, and
excessive drinking is encouraged.
Fraternities bring out the worst in
people.
What qualifies me to make this
judgement? I once belonged to a
(service) fraternity, until I saw how
ordinary people were magically tran
formed into jerks, and once lived in a
frat house while looking for another
place to live, one of the most sick
ening experiences in my life. My ex

periences at Stanford have been no
better — last week property stolen
from friends of mine was recovered
by the police, damaged, from a frat
member.
A fraternity should not have to go
to the lengths the Zetes did to be sus
pended; they should be judged by
the same standards as other houses.
They should be under the same pres
sure theme houses are to make a
positive contribution to the Stanford
community or be replaced by anoth
er group.
Prospective pledges should think
carefully about what they are doing.

No foreign spies here
According to Glen and Shearer's
viewpoint (Daily, Oct. 28), there are
threats of surveillance and coercion
hanging over foreign students from
some overseas countries. They
named some of those countries,
which included South Korea, and
maintained that the foreign govern
ments are spying on their students
here in the United States and that lim
iting foreign assistance is one pos
sible answer.
I really doubt the truth of their
arguments, because as far as Korean
students are concerned, we have

never heard about such things. I
know that there are about 100 Kore
an students here at Stanford and
many others elsewhere in the United
States. I feel very free to talk about
political problems with my Korean
friends and they are, too. In my ex
perience, I do not know of any peo
ple who report their friends' behav
ior to authorities back home, nor
have I heard from relatives at home
that they will suffer for our actions.
It is true that this might occur in a
few cases; still, the column made the
important mistake of hasty general
ization.
Generally, I feel that critics in "ad
vanced" countries are very generous
when discussing their own problems,
but very cynical about those of the
"developing" countries. They always
talk about human rights for others,
but they seem to fail tro see their own
domestic problems. Needless to say,
every country has its own problems,
problems which should not define its
image because they are overem
phasized.
In any case, I don't believethat lim
iting foreign assistance can be a solu
tion.

political problems with my Korean
friends and they are, too. In my ex
perience, I do not know of any peo
ple who report their friends' behav
ior to authorities back home, nor
have I heard from relatives at home
that they will suffer for our actions.
It is true that this might occur in a
few cases; still, the column made the
important mistake of hasty general
ization.
Generally, I feel that critics in "ad
vanced" countries are very generous
when discussing their own problems,
but very cynical about those of the
"developing" countries. They always
talk about human rights for others,
but they seem to fail tro see their own
domestic problems. Needless to say,
every country has its own problems,
problems which should not define its
image because they are overem
phasized.
In any case, I don't believethat lim
iting foreign assistance can be a solu
tion.

I wholeheartedly agree with
Radwan Shaban (Daily, Oct. 27) when
he says that the Palestinian question
is central to a lasting Middle Fast
peace. At the same time, however, I
feel that he places too much of the
blame for the current stalemate at
the feet of Israel and the United
States.
He points out that the PLO has of
fered several solutions which prom
ise "peace and coexistence" be
tween Arabs and Israelis. But how
can Israel be expected to seriously
entertain such proposals from an or
ganization whose prime objective as
stated in its covenant is the destruc
tion of the State of Israel?
Israel's desire to develop "Palesti
nian self-rule" in the territories, rath
er than a euphemism for "legit
imitized Israeli rule," is an attempt to
initiate more moderate represent
atives for the Palestinians; spokes
people who truly reflect the desires
of the West Bank populace.
Shaban also accused the Zionist
movement of using British colonial
power in the first half of this century
to further their nationalistic goals. If
he would read his history books,
however, he would note that the Brit
ish refused entry to thousands of
jews and harrassed them in every way
possible. It was the Zionist move
ment, as much as anything, which

urged the British to turn the problem
over to the United Nations for a just
solution.
Israel must recognize the Palesti
nian right to self-determination, but
at the same time, the current leader
ship of the Palestinians must recog
nize Israel's right to exist. Only then
can negotiations, based on a clear
understanding of the facts behind
the present situation, begin.

Frats bring out worst
I applaud the decision to suspend
the Zeta Psi fraternity.
Fraternities provide an at
mosphere in which members goad
each other on, leading to behavior
which is offensive, destructive and
occasionally dangerous and criminal.
Social consciousness is lost. Intersex
ual relationships are distorted, and
excessive drinking is encouraged.
Fraternities bring out the worst in
people.
What qualifies me to make this
judgement? I once belonged to a
(service) fraternity, until I saw how
ordinary people were magically tran
formed into jerks, and once lived in a
frat house while looking for another
place to live, one of the most sick
ening experiences in my life. My ex

periences at Stanford have been no
better — last week property stolen
from friends of mine was recovered
by the police, damaged, from a frat
member.
A fraternity should not have to go
to the lengths the Zetes did to be sus
pended; they should be judged by
the same standards as other houses.
They should be under the same pres
sure theme houses are to make a
positive contribution to the Stanford
community or be replaced by anoth
er group.
Prospective pledges should think
carefully about what they are doing.

No foreign spies here
According to Glen and Shearer's
viewpoint (Daily, Oct. 28), there are
threats of surveillance and coercion
hanging over foreign students from
some overseas countries. They
named some of those countries,
which included South Korea, and
maintained that the foreign govern
ments are spying on their students
here in the United States and that lim
iting foreign assistance is one pos
sible answer.
I really doubt the truth of their
arguments, because as far as Korean
students are concerned, we have

never heard about such things. I
know that there are about 100 Kore
an students here at Stanford and
many others elsewhere in the United
States. I feel very free to talk about
political problems with my Korean
friends and they are, too. In my ex
perience, I do not know of any peo
ple who report their friends' behav
ior to authorities back home, nor
have I heard from relatives at home
