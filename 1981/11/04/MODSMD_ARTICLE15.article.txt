## Dean ignored Zete revamp 
### 
The recent trashing of the Residen
tial Education office was a most un
fortunate event, one which the Zete
House neither knew about nor con
dones. As a house, we all realized af
ter reading the decision of Norm
Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs for residential education, that
all avenues of appeal were not yet
closed to Zeta Psi regarding its three
year suspension.
This vandalism, which might in
dicate that the Zetes were respon
sible, is abhorrent to our own sense
of pride and dignity; if in fact the in
dividuals responsible for this ir
responsible act are found to be af
filiated with this fraternity in any way,
their membership will be terminated
and they will be turned over to the
University and prosecuted accord

ingly.
When Zeta Psi was placed on IFC
receivership more than a year ago,
this house realized the definite need
for a change in attitude within this
fraternity. The University, in light of
tremendous house damages and

improvements in the Zete House which were

latest incident.

debt, community harassment, and at
titudes that were being reinforced
through house traditions, could have
thrown us off campus at the time; in
stead, the receivership plan set up by
the University allowed us to change
and develop accordingly.
We were able to climb — and stay
— out of debt; damages, when and if
they did occur, were fixed at one's
own expense, and in many cases
members were fined for their ac
tions. This house, contrary to pub
lished reports from Robinson's of
fice, and as Row Office inspection re
ports will verify, became one of the
two or three cleanest fraternities on
campus.
In short, there have been dramatic
improvements in the Zete House
which were ignored by a supposedly
"ad hoc" committee set up by Rob
inson to study the "facts" of the latest
incident in what is, admittedly, a long
history of incidents. This "ad hoc"
committee consisted of five hand
picked friends and/or acquaintances
of Robinson.
We are not trying to cry wolf and
infer that Robinson was simply out to
get the Zetes; however, it is impor
tant to note that Robinson is on rec
ord as being dgainst the fraternity sys
tem in general. His committee's re
port found our efforts to apologize to
the Mills College woman to be
harassment; our offer to pay for any

and all damage to clothing, etc., be
came an attempt to alleviate the
problem through financial con
siderations in this committee's eyes.
When our vice president left for
the summer at the end of last year,
the house was undamaged and spot-

less. A group of completely ir
responsible graduating seniors re
mained in the house after the Uni
versity was to have locked it up, and
did literally thousands of dollars
damage to the house itself, and
ireparable damage to our own
credibility with the University and
Robinson in particular. The condi
tion of the house at the end of the
year was found by Robinson and this
committee to be indicative of the i
year as a whole; Row office records
simply do not substantiate this find
ing.
It is our opinion that the commit
tee set up by Robinson merely served
to reinforce a decision which he had,
for all intents and purposes, already
made. When the Mills incident first
occurred, Robinson said that a de
cision would be made "within a few
days." Not until three weeks laterVvas
the recommendation, made by a I
committee which did not enter into '
its discussions with an open mind,
and which ignored dramatic im
provements within the Zete House,
accepted by Robinson. The penalty
imposed on the Zetes was based on
past history and completely ignorant
of more than a year of dramatic im
provements. This does not represent
administrative justice as it should be
at Stanford.
