# Frosh encounters judicial system in election dispute
## 
### Curtis Gruenler 
Nearly every Stanford stu
dent has sat through a course
or two on the American gov
ernment. Indeed, most have
had some contact with a gov
ernmental representative such
as a law enforcement officer or
a polling booth. Some have
probably even had a memo
rable experience in a
courtroom. But few can tell of
having pursued a dispute all
the way up to the doorstep of
California Governor Jerry
Brown, as can freshman Scott
Ahlberg.
It all began when Ahlberg,
who was attending Cal State-
Stanislaus part-time on an ad
vanced placement program,
agreed to manage his friend
Bob Bakus's campaign for stu
dent financial officer last
spring. Bakus won narrowly,
but his opponent, Dale
Carlson, persuaded the stu
dent court to order a repeat
election because of election vi
olations on the part of the elec
tion commission. The second
time around, Carlson won.
Ahlberg and Bakus, how
ever, held that the violations
cited by the court were not sig
nificant enough to warrant a
second election. They sub
mitted a request to the student
court for a hearing, which took
a month and a half to reject.
During that time, Ahlberg and
Bakus investigated the court
and found that it had violated
its own procedural rules in
handling the entire case.
These findings encouraged
them to appeal to the campus
administration, which sup
ported the student court. From
there they moved up to the
president of the college, who
backed the administration and
the court, and finally to the
chancellor of the state univer
sity and college system, who
stood behind the campus pres
ident.
Still feeling that they hadn't

received the fair hearing they
deserved, Ahlberg and Bakus
consulted a lawyer and de
cided that the only avenues left
to pursue were a civil suit and a
conversation with Brown, who
is an ex-officio trustee of the
state university and collegesys
tem. They have filed asuitseek-

. . . a little farther has taken them
through the offices of a number of
lawyers, journalists and political
officials, such as the local mayor and
state assemblyman. Said Ahlberg, 'We
learned a lot about how to get things
done' through the judicial process.

ing recompense for Bakus's
loss of the 51620 stipend that
goes with the position of finan
cial officer as well as campaign
expendituresand lawyer's fees.
They have until early january
to decide whether or not to go
through with the case, but
Ahlberg said he doubts that
they will because of the ex
pense involved. This leaves
waiting for the appointment
they have requested with
Brown — which may never
come.
The burning question is, why
go through it all? "I've asked
myself that a number of times,"
said Ahlberg. "Bob and I have

kept telling ourselves, 'We've
fought this for so long now,
maybe just a little farther and
we'll be able to quit.'
Fortunately, a little farther
has taken them through the of
fices of a number of lawyers,
journalists and political of-

ficials, such as the local mayor
and state assemblyman. Said
Ahlberg, "We learned a lot
about how to get things done"
through the judicial process.
"It sounds like such a cliche,
but there is a principle in
volved," continued Ahlberg.
He and Bakus were accused of
being obsessed with the whole
issue, and Bakus responded,
"Maybe it is an obsession, but
it's an obsession to achieve jus
tice."
Ahlberg added, "I know that
sounds kind of idealistic and
maybe even pretentious, but I
don't think I could express it
any better."

Still feeling that they hadn't

received the fair hearing they
deserved, Ahlberg and Bakus
