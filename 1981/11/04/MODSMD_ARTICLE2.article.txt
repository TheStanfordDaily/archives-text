# Res Ed vandals sought
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office yesterday began an investiga
tion of last Thursday's vandalism at
the office of Residential Education.
According to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, his office has been "del
uged with calls" regarding the inci
dent. He said he has received some
good leads, but refused to comment
as to their nature.
"We'll be talking to a number of
people whose names have come
up," he said. He admitted that most
of the names belong to members of
the Zeta Psi (Zete) fraternity here.
"I have no specific ideas on who
might have done the vandalism, but
we'll start by interviewing the Zetes,"
Niemeyer said.
Members of the fraternity said they
have conducted their own interviews
and have determined that "the Zete
house neither knew about nor con
doned the action," and "no one who
lives in the house was involved."
Thomas Allen, vice president of
the fraternity, said that if the individ
uals found responsible for the van
dalism are in any way connected with

the Zetes, "their membership will be
terminated and they will be turned
over to the proper authorities."
Niemeyer said he thought more
than one individual is involved.
"If there are a number of people
involved, then there's a better
chance that someone will slip up and
make a mistake," he said, which
would speed up the investigation.
Sergeant Phillip Love said last Fri
day that no fingerprints were taken at
the Residential Education office. "It's
a public office, and a lot of people
come in and out. There is no way to
tell if the prints belonged to the van
dals or not. It would take too long to
sort through all the different possi
bilites."
Neimeyer said he has no idea how
long the investigation will take. "If
we're successful with the interviews,
it may wind up quickly. However,
there are a lot of interviews to con
duct, and it could take a while," he
said.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for residential educa
tion, said he has no new information.
"I consider this a police matter," he
said.
