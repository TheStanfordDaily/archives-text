## GM buyers spurn cars in house deals 
### Los Angeles Times 
Detroit â€” A trifle red-faced,
but declaring $4.1 million
worth of success, General Mo
tors Corp. gave up on a unique
"buy a house, get a car" sales
promotion.
CM managed to unload 46
executive houses in five weeks
by offering to throw in a new
car as part of the deal. The trou
ble was, not one buyer took a
car.
Instead, every buyer elected
to deduct the value of the cars
from the asking prices on the
$57,000-to-$205,000 Detroit
area homes.
GM, reacting quickly to the
inevitable suggestion that it
can't even give cars away these
days, said the point was to sell

houses, not unload cars.
"In that respect, it was a tre
mendous success," GM
spokesman Don Postma said.
"But we were a little surprised
that nobody took a car."
The company apparently
hasn't decided whether the
embarrassment of having its
cars spurned is worth the trou
ble. CM will decide in a few
days whether to drop the pro
gram, try it nationwide or
select another city in which to
experiment further.
The auto company launched
the program in late September
to attack an increasingly costly
problem: a backlog of about
500 homes it had bought from
transferred executives but had
been unable to resell because
of the slumping housing mar

ket.
The sales scheme was tried in
only the Detroit area, where
GM's real estate group was sad
dled with 112 homes.
The company held open
houses and parked shiny new
GM cars in the driveways. The
car sticker prices averaged 8
percent to 10 percent of the
prices on the homes. The pro
gram was promoted heavily by
GM and it was covered widely
in newspapers and on tele
vision.
There was some grumbling
among local realtors, because
GM kept most of the com
issions to cover the cost of the
project, but it clearly pumped a
little excitement into Detroit's
real estate market. GM says the

46 home sales in five weeks,
which cleared the decks of $4.1
million worth of housing, in
creased by fivefold the area's
housing sales total for the pre
ceding five-week period.
"There were a lot of ques
tions about the cars, but when
they got to the bottom line, the
people wanted to reduce the
amount of their mortgages.
Anybody the least bit knowl
edgeable about the housing
market would understand
what was happening. What
would you do?"
One man, Postma says, did
'come close to taking a car. "We
had one guy who had just or
dered a Cadillac the week
before. The man said if he
hadn't, he would have taken a
car with the house."
