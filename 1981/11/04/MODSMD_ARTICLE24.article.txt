# Reagan 'downsizing'as economy slumps
## Reagan to cut bureaucracies 
### 
New York (AP) — Houses, cars, government
bureaucracies, corporate staffs, incomes and fi
nancial goals all share a word these days that you
won't even find in the dictionary. They are being
"downsized."
The word seems to be a euphemism for being
forced to do with less, a grudging concession to
economic reality, an attempt to make the best of
a world which no longer indulges its people in
easy luxuries.
If you have to accept less, then make it the
fashion, make it the "in" thing. Pity the boor
who lives in the old Victorian house with massive
rooms, or the wastrel who rides around on eight
big cylinders.
The trend probably began with the automo
bile or the chocolate candy bar, but now "down
sizing" has been embraced by so much of socie
ty that it might eventually be used to describe
the decade of the '80s.
President Ronald Reagan is a downsizer, and
the federal bureaucracy is his patient. He has
plans to eliminate two departments, energy and
education. He hopes to cut the budget. He plans
to curtail regulation.
In Reagan's view, the bureaucracy grew too
fast, from 1.1 million civilian federal workers in

1940 to nearly triple that in 1980, accompanied
by a rise in payrolls from less than $2.2 billion to
more than $50 billion a year. Downsizing that is a
keystone of his program.
So also are cuts in services he feels should be
assumed by the private sector, either directly by
individuals or indirectly through their institu
tions. Downsizing to the president is equated
with efficiency.
It is in state governments and in private en
terprise also. These are days in which hardnosed
efficiency experts thrive and sinecured employ
ees suddenly have to prove their worth.
But not all that goes is waste. As downsizing
becomes the vogue you can be certain there will
be excesses. The good may go with the bad. Val
uable progams and people will be sacrificed.
Short-run efficiencies may be at the expense of
potential long term gains.
Still, downsizing has strong appeal today for
state governments whose budgets are over
loaded and private sector companies whose ex
ecutives staffs have developed a bulge just
below the top level, a result in part of having
stockpiled talent for the big boom that didn't
come.
Accompanying these obvious examples of
downsizing is the feeling that human aspirations
and goals also have been lowered. It cannot easi
ly be demonstrated, but every now and then a
survey suggests it is extensive.
