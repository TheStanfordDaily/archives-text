# Production off, job rate to slip
## 
### Associated Press 
Orders for new manufac
tured goods fell sharply in Sep
tember, while manufacturers'
inventories rose, the govern
ment reported. Economists
viewed the reports as harb
ingers of lower production
levels and more unemploy
ment.
In a separate report, the gov
ernment said the value of new
construction in September de
clined percent, hitting the
lowest level since October
1980.
Those reports pointed to a
weakening economy that has
undermined corporate profits.
But businesses received some
relief from high borrowing
costs Monday when major
banks lowered their prime len
ding rates to 17.5 percent.
David Jones, an economist at

the Wall Street firm of Aubrey
Lanston & Co., said he ex
pected banks to further reduce
their basic loan rates to com
mercial borrowers. Jones said
the prime rate may dip to 16
percent by year's end.
Spurred in part by talk of
lower interest rates, the stock
market rose sharply. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks advanced 14.27 points to
866.82, giving the blue-chip in
dex a gain of nearly 34 points in
the last two sessions.
The gloomy economic re
ports from Washington ap
parently bolstered optimism
that interest rates would fall as
the recession cuts businesses'
demand for borrowed funds.
Rates in the nation's credit
markets were slightly lower, al
though sharp declines early in
the day were wiped out in the
afternoon.
The Commerce Department
reported that orders for new
manufactured goods fell 0.9
percent in September.
