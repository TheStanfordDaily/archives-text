## Fingers wins A.L. Cy Young hands down 
### 
New York (AP) — Rollie Fin
gers, rubber-armed relief ace
of the Milwaukee Brewers, was
named winner of the American
League Cy Young Award for
1981 by the Baseball Writers As
sociation of America yesterday.
Fingers won six games and
saved 28 others with a 1.04
earned run average in 47 ap
pearances for the Brewers, sec
ond half winners of the Ameri
can League's East Division.
Fingers beat Oakland right
hander Steve McCatty, receiv
ing 22 of the 28 first place
ballots from the BBWAA com
mittee composed of two writ
ers from each of the league's 14

franchise cities. He finished
with 126 points and was the
only pitcher named on every
ballot.
McCatty had the other six
first place votes and finished
with 84Vi points, well ahead of
Jack Morris of Detroit, who was
third with 21.
Fingers, 35, had a hand in 34
of the Brewers' 62 victories last
season and became only the
second relief pitcher to win the
AL Cy Young award, following
Sparky Lyle of the New York
Yankees, who captured it in
1977.
Acquired from St. Louis just
two days after the Cardinals

had obtained him from San Di
ego during the winter meet
ings at Dallas last December,
Fingers pitched 78 innings for
the Brewers, striking out 61 bat
ters and walking only 13.
A rangy right-hander with a
waxed handlebar mustache,
Fingers has started only four
games in his major league ca
reer and none since 1971.
He broke in with the Oak
land A's in 1969 and was a key
member of three world cham
pionship teams with that club.
He was named the most valu
able player in the 1974 World
Series when he won one game

and saved two others with a
1.93 £RA against the Los Angel
es Dodgers. He holds career
World Series records for relief
appearances with 16 and career
saves with six. Both marks were
set during Oakland's reign in
the early 70s.
He left the A's in the first free
agent re-entry draft in 1976,
signing with San Diego and
pitching four seasons for the
Padres. He won the Fireman of
the Year award three times, in
1977, 1978 and 1980. He re
peated that award last season,
becoming the first man to win
it in both leagues.
In his first two years with the

Padres, he set National League
records with 35 saves in 1977
and 37 saves the next season.
For his career, Fingers has 272
saves, another bullpen record.
Fingers was en route to Las
Vegas for a vacation and was
not immediately available for
comment on the award.
Behind Fingers, McCatty and
Morris in the balloting came
Milwaukee's Pete Vuckovich,
fourth with BV2 points, fol
lowed by Baltimore's Dennis
Martinez with 3 1 /2. Then came
New York Yankee teammates
Goose Gossage with three
points and Ron Guidry with
2V2, followed by Britt Burns of
Chicago with two and Larry
Gura of Kansas City with one
point.
