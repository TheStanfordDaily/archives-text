# Series MVP Yeager hopes to stay in L.A.

### 
New York (AP) — If they're
going to break up the Los An
geles Dodgers, then catcher
Steve Yeager hopes he's not in
cluded in the dispersal plan.
"I don't want to be traded,"
he said Monday after accepting
his one-third of the World
Series Most Valuable Player
Award. "I just want more
playing time."
Ron Cey and Pedro Guer
rero, who shared the Series

MVP honor with Yeager, were
unable to attend the awards
ceremony sponsored by major
league baseball and Sport
Magazine.
The word at the Series was
that this would be the last time
around for these Dodgers.
Ironically, only days after shar
ing the MVP award, Guerrero
was rumored heading for San
Diego in a trade for shortstop
Ozzie Smith. But the Padres re

jected that deal.
If management is de
termined to clean house, then
Yeager is glad the Dodgers
ended their run with a world
championship.
"This was our fourth time (in
the Series)," he said. "It was
very gratifying to finally win it,
especially if they are about to
break up the team."
Yeager thought there were
some lessons to be learned by

Series observers. The first is
that he can produce more than
his 86 regular season at bats al
lowed and the other is that the
Dodger veterans are still quali
ty players.
"This might have been our
last chance to do it collectively
and we did," said Yeager.
"Basically, it was done by the
veterans. We showed we can
still play."
And the veteran catcher
hoped he showed he can play
more than he did before the
playoffs.
Under Manager Tommy
Lasorda's platoon system,
righty-swinging Yeager was to
be used against left-handed
pitchers and Mike Scioscia,
who swings from the left side,
was the man against right
handers.
Somehow it seemed that, un

til the Series against the lefty
laden New York Yankees, the
Dodgers never faced many
southpaws. So, Yeager sat. He
wasn't thrilled with that role.
"I have a lot of nervous
energy," he said. "I want to
play, to do something. I didn't
have that opportunity too
much. I don't want to leave the
Dodger organization. I've
been in it for 15 years and it's a
great one. I only want to play."
Yeager and the other
Dodgers were annoyed at the
notion that they had not won
the Series as much as the Yan
kees had lost it.
"We share the feeling that
you go out and win," he said.
"Nothing is ever given to you.
They were trying as hard as
they could. The difference was
we got some breaks and took
advantage of them. But the
Dodgers feel we beat a good
ball club, a ball club that bat
tled us to the last out. They nev
er gave upforoneinstant.They
were as tough to get out from
the first pitch to the last one."
The Dodgers, said Yeager,
had something to prove in the
postseason. "We all felt, going
in, that we had been counted
out," he said. "That made us
pull together much more."
The effort resulted in a world
championship and, Yeager
hopes, a new lease on life for
the veteran team and its pla
toon catcher.
