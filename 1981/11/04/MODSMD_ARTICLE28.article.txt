New York (AP) â€” If they're
going to break up the Los An
geles Dodgers, then catcher
Steve Yeager hopes he's not in
cluded in the dispersal plan.
"I don't want to be traded,"
he said Monday after accepting
his one-third of the World
Series Most Valuable Player
Award. "I just want more
playing time."
Ron Cey and Pedro Guer
rero, who shared the Series

MVP honor with Yeager, were
unable to attend the awards
ceremony sponsored by major
league baseball and Sport
Magazine.
The word at the Series was
that this would be the last time
around for these Dodgers.
Ironically, only days after shar
ing the MVP award, Guerrero
was rumored heading for San
Diego in a trade for shortstop
Ozzie Smith. But the Padres re

jected that deal.
If management is de
termined to clean house, then
Yeager is glad the Dodgers
ended their run with a world
championship.
"This was our fourth time (in
the Series)," he said. "It was
very gratifying to finally win it,
especially if they are about to
break up the team."
Yeager thought there were
some lessons to be learned by

Series observers. The first is
that he can produce more than
his 86 regular season at bats al
lowed and the other is that the
Dodger veterans are still quali
ty players.
"This might have been our
last chance to do it collectively
and we did," said Yeager.
"Basically, it was done by the
veterans. We showed we can
still play."
