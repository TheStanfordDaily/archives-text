# An overtime thriller
## Booters beat St. Mary's 
### Adam Berns 
After last Saturday's disappointing loss to Cal
Berkeley, a major concern for Stanford soccer
coach Nelson Lodge had to be findings way to
motivate his players.
Yesterday, the Cardinals showed that they had
put the Cal game behind them in a 2-1 overtime
win vs. St. Mary's. Most impressive thing about
the victory was Stanford's intensity in the over
time period.
The Cardinals came into the game knowing
that St. Mary's would be sitting back and playing
defense. Earlier in the season the Gaels had lost
close 2-0 and 1-0 matches to USF and Fresno
State. At times during previous matches, St.
Mary's had dropped as many as nine players
back on defense.
In yesterday's contest, St. Mary's used similar
strategy. Throughout the game they were drop
ping most of their players back and did a lot of
funneling, which means that there were always
four to five backs around the goal area.
For the most part, Stanford dominated regu
lation play, controlling the midfield throughout
the game and taking many shots on the Gael's
goal. The first half ended with the score tied at
0-0.
The Cardinals scored first in the second half,
on a well executed offsides trap. As a defender
for St. Mary's came up to catch Stanford offsides,
senior defender Doug Clark released a pass to
sophmore striker Jorge Titinger who booted the
ball past the Gael goalie for Stanford's first score.

Later in the halt, the Gaels struck back on a
quick break downfield. The goal by St. Mary's
tied the game at 1-1 and sent it into overtime.
In the first half of the overtime period, the
Cardinals scored their second and winning goal.
Senior striker Willie Guicci headed in a ball with
a double assist from senior striker Ted Rafalovich
and Jorge Titinger. It was Guicci's twenty-first
goal of the season.
After the game, Lodge said he thought it was
going to be close. "St Mary's is a vastly improved
team from last year," Lodge said. "Throughout
the year they've played many good teams ex
tremely well."
Although St. Mary's is not one of the best
teams that Stanford has played this year, Lodge
found some very positive factors in yesterday's
victory. "I think the biggest difference from our
standpoint," he said, "is that we played with de
termination today. We went out there in the ov
ertime period and looked like we wanted to
win."
One of the key strategic moves in the game in
volved Rafolovich. Because he is still suffering
from an injury, Lodge chose not to play him in
regulation time yesterday, preferring to save
him for Saturday's contest with Fresno State.
However, Rafalovich was inserted during the ov
ertime period and was instrumental in the Stan
ford victory, taking part in the double assist
which lead to the Cardinal's final score.
One of the other keys yesterday was the im
proved play of the defense, especially Clark.
The win boosts Stanford's record to 11-5-2.
