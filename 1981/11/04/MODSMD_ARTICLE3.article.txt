# China program chief leaves for new job
## 
### Juliet Johnson 
Douglas Murray, director of the University's
U.S.-China relations program, leaves this week for
a new position as vice president of the East-West
Center in Hawaii.
The East-West Center was created and funded
by Congress in 1960, at the same time the Peace
Corps was formed. Although it was formed by the
government, the founding act of Congress stipu
lated that its board of directors be independent.
Murray, who was also a lecturer in the School of
Education here, made many trips to China as direc
tor of the U.S.-China relations program to research
Chinese methods of education. Although he em
phasized that his new job is "concerned with cul
tural and technological exchange with all of Asia,
and not with China alone," he said China will be an

important object of his concern.
There are now about 7000 Chinese students in
the United States, but the number of American
students in China is considerably smaller. Murray
said he sees no hope of changing this imbalance.
"There is no chance that U.S. students to China will
ever approximate this number, but you must re
member that American students are in China for a
shorter time," said Murray. "A fresh lot go in as
soon as the old ones come out, so the flow of bod
ies is higher."
At present, opportunities for rural fieldwork by
Americans in China are subject to a time limit of
three weeks. Some observers attribute this limit in
part to the conduct of Steven Mosher, a doctoral
student in anthropology here, who recently an
gered Chinese authorities by publishing an il

lustrated article on methods of forced abortions in
the People's Republic of China.
Although no official complaints about Mosher's
activities were lodged, John Jamieson and Jack Pot
ter of the University of California at Berkeley have
severely criticized Mosher's methods of research.
Murray, however, reserved judgment on
Mosher's alleged behavior. "Mosher went
through a national and not a Stanford program,"
said Murray. "I have no way of knowing what he
did or didn't do." But he said he agrees the Mosher
controversy "will make it more difficult for certain
kinds of research tu be done."
Originally placed under the administrative con
trol of the University of Hawaii, the East-West Cen
ter was completely separated from that university
in 1975.
