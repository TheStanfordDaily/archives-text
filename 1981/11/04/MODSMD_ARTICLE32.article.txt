## What happened around here? 
### 
\\ hat the hell can you say anymore about this football
season?
Theuhole thing hasturned incredibly sour — it seems
like nobody really knows what to do anymore.
A group of men have gone out to play football on the last
two Saturdaysand come back demoralized and beaten
despite giving two of the most explosive performances this
year. The team seems confused, almost bewildered and that
feeling was compounded Friday by the enormously tragic
death of Kevin MacMillan.
Though there iscertainly nocorrelation between
MacMillan's death and this football season or the Zete
suspension or the destruction of the housingoffice, it
simply felt this weekend like there was something rotten on
the Farm — like all this funk must somehow be related.
MacMillan was a football player and a fraternity member
which helped convene in one's mind the actually disparate
things that went wrong last week.
Just as quickly as all those points rattled off on the
scoreboards in Stanford and Huskie Stadiums, things
around here got progressively worse; Maybe it just seemed
that way, though, because there was that one truly awful
event that hovered above the rest making one stop
dumbfoundedly to say, "What the hell is going on around
here?"
You couldn't tell. That was what made it so confusing.
All these things seemed to happen at once until it just felt
weird and awful at the same time. We can certainly all
rationalize a poor football season and a fraternity closure is
a mild milestone for most at Stanford. But the vandalism in
the housing office seemed a little more out of the ordinary
and somehow base. The death of two students, though
barely tangential to these things, brought a week of bazzar
events to an horrendous climax. The feeling was subtle but
incredibly pervasive.
I only knew Kevin as I knowa numberof football players
— through covering the team for the Daily. But I saw him on
campus and at practice and knew him well enough to get
that terrible pang you get when you realize someone who
was truly alive in this world has died. It's a feeling so rare at
Stanford it quite literally shocked me. Emotion around here
never gets so intense.
And that's because nothing at Stanford is so final — no
matter what happens, this life istransient.
We study, play, party and know each other in a fantasy
world. This is the Stanford Country Club in environment
and in state of mind. We live in an Eden 99 percent of the
world will never know and we bask in it, secretly fearing
what's out there and openly protecting ourselves against it.
When three of our peers ran up against the ultimate
reality our campus was shocked. Stanford students don't die
— particularly students as rich in talent and vigor as the two
that were killed. Students here drink beer and take drugs
and defy everythingthatcould possibly tiethemdown.
White punks on dope.
If anything can be said for a shock liketheonethis
campus experienced last Friday morning, it is this: it pulled
us out to see for awhile something more important than
getting A's, getting high nr having a winning football team.
It put those things in perspective and there are few places in
this country where a heavy, if harsh, dose of reality could be
better utilized.
