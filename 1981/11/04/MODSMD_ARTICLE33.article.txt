# 'The statistics speak for themselves'
## Injuries running rampant on the gridiron 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The statistics
speak for themselves:
— Of the approximately 1
million youngsters who play
football in the United States
each year, 200,000 will suffer an
injury of the knee, shoulder or
ankle. Fifty thousand non
professional football players
will undergo knee surgery, ac
cording to Dr. William W.
Southmayd, a Boston sports
medicine specialist.
— On an average college
team of 90 to 95 players, ap
proximately 24 each year will
suffer injuries serious enough
to keep them out of games and
practices for at least a week, ac
cording to studies by Penn
State University's National Ath
letic Injury-Illness Reporting
System.
— In the National Football
League, there is a 50 percent
chance of one running back on
each team being hurt badly
enough to need surgery, ac
cording to a joint study by the
League and the NFL Players As
sociation.
— During the first six weeks
of the season in Fairfax County
high schools, Va., 42 percent of
the participants in varsity, jun
ior varsity and 9th grade foot
ball suffered injuries of some
sort, ranging from cuts and
bruises to bone fractures and
major sprains and ligament
damage.
As in any contact sport, the
risk of serious injury has always
been an integral part of foot
ball. But some think that risk
has increased.
"In 30 years of coaching, this
is probably the worst for in

juries I've ever experienced,"
said Dick Bestwick, coach at
the University of Virginia.
At Redskin Park, Bubba Tyer,
head trainer for the Washing
ton Redskins, is also experienc
ing his worst year for injuries.
"I've been here 11 years, and
this is the worst I can re
member," said Tyer. "Joe
Kuczo's (assistant trainer) been
here 28 years, and he can't re
member anything this bad. You
try to analyze why each injury
happens, but there isn't any
single reason you can pinpoint.
If you could, maybe you could
do something about it."
Through Oct. 25, the Na
tional Football League had 255
players placed on injured re
serve so far this year. At the
same point in the season a year
ago, the figure was 228
Elsewhere, Kelvin Bryant, the
University of North Carolina's
junior tailback who had scored
15 touchdowns in the first
three games of the season, was
injured in an Oct. 3 game
against Georgia Tech and will
probably not play again this
year. Bryant, who had been
considered a contender for the
Heisman trophy, underwent
knee surgery to repair two seri
ously sprained ligaments after
being tackled by Georgia Tech
defensive back Mike Nied
banck.
Bestwick suggested one rea
son for the apparent increase
in injuries.
"The game's much faster and
more physical now than it's
ever been,"he said. "And it's
played by guys who have been
training with weights and are
bigger and stronger. Just the

velocity of people moving
opens people up to injuries.
Anybody who tells you it's the
same as it was in the good old
days is crazy."
Sports medicine specialists
generally agree that with each
ascending level of competition
(high school to college, college
to professional) the rate of in
jury also increases. But the
most serious of injuries can oc
cur even at the youngest levels.
In Northern Virginia, Jon
Walsh, 16, an offensive lineman
at Fairfax County's Robinson
High School, collapsed and
died while running on the
track on the first day of prac
tice.
On Sept. 16, Terrence Rob
inson, 14, playing on a parish
team for St. Bridget's Roman
Catholic Church in Richmond,
VA., suffered head and spinal
injuries while making a tackle
in a controlled scrimmage. He
died three days later.
In a message to the Catholic
schools and parishes of the
Richmond diocese a week lat
er, Bishop Walter F. Sullivan
called for a ban on football.
"It is not uncommon to hear

young players wanting to 'kill
the opposition' or put the op
ponent out of commission.'
Youngsters do not learn to en
joy football but to knock heads
... The constant threat of seri
ous injury and even death far
outweighs any justification for
such games ... " the bishop
said.
It is unlikely the bishop's ad
monition will meet with wide
spread popular support. It is
also unlikely that there will be
significantly fewer injuries in
the immediate future.
"In my opinion, there is no
guaranteed way to prevent in
jury," said Southmayd, the Bos
ton-based sports medicine
specialist, in a recently pub
lished book called "Sports
Health," which he coauthored
with Marshall Hoffman.
Only within the last five to 10
years has the sports medicine
profession attempted any sys
tematic examination of sports
related injuries, so trends over
a longer period are generally
undocumented. Probably the
most sophisticated such study
is Penn State's National Athlet
ic Injury Illness Reporting Sur

vey. Since 1974, the survey has
compiled injury-related data
on thousands of college ath
letes in 30 different sports, ac
cording to Dr. John Powell,
special projects director for the
program.
"Our system has generated a
fairly consistent pattern of risk
and injury. I would not say that
injuries are rising or falling,"
said Powell.
Over the long term, how
ever, the injury rate has at least
given the appearance of in
crease.
Dr. Robert Nirschl, chairman
of thesports medicine commit
tee for the Virginia Medical As
sociation and an associate pro
fessor of orthopedics at
Georgetown University Hospi
tal, says football-related knee
and ankle injuries appear to
have increased.
"But maybe those of us who
are involved in the treatment
and diagnosis of those injuries
are better at it than we were 10
or 15 years ago," he said. "We
recognize that injuries we used
to think were relatively minor
are major injuries."

ankle. Fifty thousand non
professional football players
will undergo knee surgery, ac
cording to Dr. William W.
Southmayd, a Boston sports
medicine specialist.
— On an average college
team of 90 to 95 players, ap
proximately 24 each year will
suffer injuries serious enough
to keep them out of games and
practices for at least a week, ac
cording to studies by Penn
State University's National Ath
letic Injury-Illness Reporting
System.
— In the National Football
League, there is a 50 percent
chance of one running back on
each team being hurt badly
enough to need surgery, ac
cording to a joint study by the
League and the NFL Players As
sociation.
— During the first six weeks
of the season in Fairfax County
high schools, Va., 42 percent of
the participants in varsity, jun
ior varsity and 9th grade foot
ball suffered injuries of some
sort, ranging from cuts and
bruises to bone fractures and
major sprains and ligament
damage.
As in any contact sport, the
risk of serious injury has always
been an integral part of foot
ball. But some think that risk
has increased.
"In 30 years of coaching, this
is probably the worst for in

juries I've ever experienced,"
said Dick Bestwick, coach at
the University of Virginia.
At Redskin Park, Bubba Tyer,
head trainer for the Washing
ton Redskins, is also experienc
ing his worst year for injuries.
"I've been here 11 years, and
this is the worst I can re
member," said Tyer. "Joe
Kuczo's (assistant trainer) been
here 28 years, and he can't re
member anything this bad. You
try to analyze why each injury
happens, but there isn't any
single reason you can pinpoint.
If you could, maybe you could
do something about it."
Through Oct. 25, the Na
tional Football League had 255
players placed on injured re
serve so far this year. At the
same point in the season a year
ago, the figure was 228
Elsewhere, Kelvin Bryant, the
University of North Carolina's
junior tailback who had scored
15 touchdowns in the first
three games of the season, was
injured in an Oct. 3 game
against Georgia Tech and will
probably not play again this
year. Bryant, who had been
considered a contender for the
Heisman trophy, underwent
knee surgery to repair two seri
ously sprained ligaments after
being tackled by Georgia Tech
defensive back Mike Nied
banck.
Bestwick suggested one rea
son for the apparent increase
in injuries.
"The game's much faster and
more physical now than it's
ever been,"he said. "And it's
played by guys who have been
training with weights and are
bigger and stronger. Just the

velocity of people moving
opens people up to injuries.
Anybody who tells you it's the
same as it was in the good old
days is crazy."
Sports medicine specialists
generally agree that with each
ascending level of competition
(high school to college, college
to professional) the rate of in
jury also increases. But the
most serious of injuries can oc
cur even at the youngest levels.
In Northern Virginia, Jon
Walsh, 16, an offensive lineman
at Fairfax County's Robinson
High School, collapsed and
died while running on the
track on the first day of prac
tice.
On Sept. 16, Terrence Rob
inson, 14, playing on a parish
team for St. Bridget's Roman
Catholic Church in Richmond,
VA., suffered head and spinal
injuries while making a tackle
in a controlled scrimmage. He
died three days later.
In a message to the Catholic
schools and parishes of the
Richmond diocese a week lat
er, Bishop Walter F. Sullivan
called for a ban on football.
"It is not uncommon to hear

young players wanting to 'kill
the opposition' or put the op
ponent out of commission.'
Youngsters do not learn to en
joy football but to knock heads
... The constant threat of seri
ous injury and even death far
outweighs any justification for
such games ... " the bishop
said.
It is unlikely the bishop's ad
monition will meet with wide
spread popular support. It is
also unlikely that there will be
significantly fewer injuries in
the immediate future.
"In my opinion, there is no
guaranteed way to prevent in
jury," said Southmayd, the Bos
ton-based sports medicine
specialist, in a recently pub
lished book called "Sports
Health," which he coauthored
with Marshall Hoffman.
Only within the last five to 10
years has the sports medicine
profession attempted any sys
tematic examination of sports
related injuries, so trends over
a longer period are generally
undocumented. Probably the
most sophisticated such study
is Penn State's National Athlet
ic Injury Illness Reporting Sur

vey. Since 1974, the survey has
compiled injury-related data
on thousands of college ath
letes in 30 different sports, ac
cording to Dr. John Powell,
special projects director for the
program.
"Our system has generated a
fairly consistent pattern of risk
and injury. I would not say that
injuries are rising or falling,"
said Powell.
Over the long term, how
ever, the injury rate has at least
given the appearance of in
crease.
Dr. Robert Nirschl, chairman
of thesports medicine commit
tee for the Virginia Medical As
sociation and an associate pro
fessor of orthopedics at
Georgetown University Hospi
tal, says football-related knee
and ankle injuries appear to
have increased.
"But maybe those of us who
are involved in the treatment
and diagnosis of those injuries
are better at it than we were 10
or 15 years ago," he said. "We
recognize that injuries we used
to think were relatively minor
are major injuries."
