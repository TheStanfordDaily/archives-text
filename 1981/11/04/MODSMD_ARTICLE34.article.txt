Cards whip Lady Dons
The Stanford women's volleyball team took USF downtown last night in three games.
The Cards swept the match 15-8,15-8,15-3 to noone's surprise — the Dons are now
0-7 in NorCal Conference play. Stanford is now 22-9 overall, 6-1 in conference
games, and is ranked ninth nationally. But that record will tested tonight against a
tough UC-Berkeley team in Maples Pavillion at 7:30 p.m.
