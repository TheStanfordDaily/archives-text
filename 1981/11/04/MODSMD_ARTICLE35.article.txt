Robb governor of Virginia
Democrat Charles Robb was elected governor of Virginia
yesterday while the Republican gubernatorial candidate in
New Jersey clung to a razor-thin margin in a race watched as
a ballot-box barometer of how Americans feel about Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's economic program.
The Virginia race was a battle of conservatives that pro
vided no clear choice on the Reagan program.
Campaigning for Republican Marshall Coleman, Reagan
had appealed to Virginia voters: "Don't let me down.'
In New Jersey, Republican Thomas Kean held a narrow
lead over Democratic Rep. James Florio, who had called on
voters to "send the nation a message" expressing their dis
satisfaction with the Reagan economic program.
The White House and the two national party organizations
had large investments in money and prestige in the two
races. But as the campaigns ended, the outcomes appeared
as dependent on local issues as on voter feelings about the
Reagan presidency.
With 4664 of New Jersey's 5647 precincts reporting, Kean
had 936,964 votes and Florio 926,382 — a virtual 50-50 split.
Robb, son-in-law of the late Lyndon Johnson, beat Re
publican Attorney General Marshall Coleman to end more
than a decade of GOP rule in Virginia.
With 1296 of the state's 1909 precincts reporting, the unof
ficial vote was Robb 484,408 or 53.8 percent and Coleman
414,609 or 46.1 percent.
Mayor Edward Koch of New York, enjoying both the Dem
ocratic and Republican nominations, won a second four
year term. Republican Mayor George Voinovich coasted to
re-election in Cleveland with 75 percent of the vote.
Weinberger testifies on war
p
Washington — The Soviet Union apparently thinks it could
win a nuclear war with the United States, Secretary of De
fense Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
As a result, Weinberger told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, the United States must prepare for the possi
bility of being hit by more than a single nuclear strike.
Weinberger testified at a hearing on the Reagan adminis
tration's $180 billion, six-year strategic arms package, which
includes the B-1 bomber and the MX missile.
He was asked by Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the
senior Democrat on the committee, whether the Soviet
Union or the United States regards a nuclear war as win
nable.
"I have seen nothing that indicates the Soviet Union does
• not believe it could win," Weinberger said. "When you look
at the arsenal they have amassed over more than 21 years, I
have to conclude that that is the assumption which underlies
all of their thinking."
As to the U.S. view of a nuclear war, Weinberger said, "We
view it as something that we should make every effort to de
ter."
Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) asked Weinberger if he
thought it was realistic to think of a nuclear war "that would
involve strikes beyond several days."
"I don't know if it is realistic," he replied. "But if this situ
ation is what we are faced with, you cannot hope to meet it or
to deter attack unless you have the kind of capability that will
enable you to respond."
"It appears that they (the Soviets) are at least planning on
more than one strike," he said.
California turnout light
California gained a new city yesterday as the Alameda
County town of Dublin voted to incorporate.
Elsewhere in Northern California, with generally light vot
er turnout, San Francisco voters approved allowing higher
cable car fares, San Rafael rejected rent control and Chico
opposed the Peripheral Canal.
With all of the 724 precincts in San Francisco unofficially
counted, a measure to let the city's Public Utilities Com
mission set cable car fares above those for buses led 56,505 to
34,573.
Currently, all Municipal Railway fares are 50 cents, but
backers of Proposition B, including Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
argued that passage would enable the city to "protect the
future" of the tourist attraction.
The cable cars are scheduled to be shut down in October
for a $60 million overhaul. The U.S. Department of Transpor
tation has pledged $50 million for the job, and the city is
trying to raise the rest through fund drives.
Chico voters thunderously opposed the proposed Per
ipheral Canal, voting 6,685 to 464 against it in a non-binding
referendum.
Submarine affair appears over
Stockholm —The week-long crisis over the grounding of a
Soviet submarine in Swedish waters appeared yesterday to
be ending after the Soviet Union met Sweden's demands and
Swedish tugs towed the sub to safety.

After a go-ahead from Moscow, the sub's captain, Lt.
Cmdr. Pyotr Gushin, and his navigation officer were ques
tioned for six hours Monday aboard a Swedish navy ship
about the grounding of the sub last Tuesday night in a re
stricted military area off the southeast coast near the
Karlskrona naval base.
The commander-in-chief of Sweden's armed forces, Gen.
Lennart Ljung, told a news conference the Soviet govern
ment also agreed to an inspection of the sub's navigational
equipment, charts and duty lists. Swedish officials claimed
that the aged, Whiskey-class sub had been fitted with special
intelligence-gathering gear.
The Swedish government, after barring Soviet salvage
ships from rescuing the sub, had said Swedish tugs would not
refloat it until the government received a satisfactory ex
planation of the grounding. But a storm blew up while
Gushin was being interrogated.
Gushin claimed last week that the sub got into the restrict
ed area by mistake, because some of its navigational equip
ment failed. But Swedish officials said skilled maneuvering
was necessary to penetrate the area, in which there are nu
merous small islands, and it was obvious the sub was there
intentionally.
Jordan cooperation pledged
Washington — President Ronald Reagan and King Hussein
of Jordan ended two days of talks yesterday, with the two
leaders agreed on the need for continued close security co
operation but divided about the best way to pursue resolu
tion of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
After their final White House meeting, they indicated that,
despite the possibility of Jordan buying weapons from the
Soviet Union, Hussein does not intend to change his tradi
tional orientation toward the West or abandon his reliance
on the United States as Jordan's principal arms supplier.
"The security and well-being of the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan is a matter of historic and enduring concern for the
United States," Reagan said. He did not elaborate, but U.S.
sources said the president and Hussein had agreed on in
creased military cooperation that is expected to result in new
supplies of American weaponry to bolster Jordan's air de
fenses against threats from Syria.
The two were even less specific in their public comments
about the best road to follow in seeking Middle East peace.
As expected, Hussein made clear that he is not ready to join
or endorse the U.S.-sponsored Camp David process, and
Reagan, who last week triggered a major new controversy
with Israel through his comments on a Saudi Arabian peace
plan, was especially circumspect in his remarks.
Haig, Allen dispute
Washington — The long-simmering feud between Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig and national security adviser
Richard Allen boiled up anew yesterday, with one senior
administration officials predicting that Allen's days are num
bered.
The official, a close friend and long-time associate of the
president who refused to be identified, told the Los Angeles
Times that, while a specific timetable for Allen's removal has
not been set, "everyone's agreed that it's going to happen.
The president isn't going to allow this internecine stuff to
keep going on."
A White House spokesman denied yeterday that Reagan
plans to replace Allen. And Allen told the Times that Haig
had personally assured him he does not regard Allen as the
source of the latest flap.
The current flare-up began when Haig, after reading an
advance copy of a newspaper column, called Reagan over
the weekend to complain angrily that a senior White House
aide was leading a "guerilla campaign" to discredit him.
Haig's complaint centered on a column written by Jack
Anderson that cited incidents that allegedly had caused the
president to lose confidence in his secretary of state.
At Haig's urging, Reagan telephoned Anderson and de
nied the accuracy of the column, which Anderson withdrew
from scheduled publication. In its place, Anderson
circulated a substitute column for yesterday that recounted
his conversations with both Reagan, who expressed con
fidence in his secretary of state, and with Haig, who spoke
bitterly of a campaign to discredit him.
The latest flap caused lengthy high-level meetings at both
the White House and the State Department, with spokesmen
at both places confirming that Haig had complained about
such a campaign.
New tax plan pushed
Washington — Acting despite President Ronald Reagan's
opposition to massive tax increases to balance the budget,
key Senate Republicans approved a plan yesterday to raise
taxes by $75 billion to $80 billion over the next three years to
help eliminate the federal deficit.

The plan, adopted in principle by 11 of the 12 Republicans
on the powerful Senate Budget Committee, also would cut
federal programs by about $100 billion between now and
1984 to achieve a balanced budget.
The GOP caucus, however, did not pinpoint what taxes it
favored increasing as it readied its version of how to halt red
ink spending, leaving that thorny political problem to the
Senate Finance Committee.
Word of the closed-door decision came as President Rea
gan was described by a White House spokesman as against
raising taxes more than $22 billion over the next three years
in the wake of Reagan's advocacy of the largest tax cut in his
tory.
In the House, a source close to the Republican leadership
said the plan for raising taxes by up to $80 billion over the
next three years would be shot down in the Democratic-con
trolled chamber.
Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), how
ever, has said that he fears deficits ranging as high as $240
billion over the next three years unless there are major tax
increases. The arrival of a recession, along with adminis
tration forecasts that it may last until next April, has made the
potential deficits loom even larger in the current fiscal year
and beyond.
More studies for Diablo Canyon
Washington — The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff
yesterday ordered three more independent studies of the
Diablo Canyon atomic power plant before the California fa
cility can be licensed to generate electricity.
Harold Denton, NRC director of nuclear reactor regu
lation, issued the order after a 4V2-hour meeting at which
operators of the plant outlined steps they've taken since a
design error was discovered in September after the plant was
already licensed to test its reactor.
The plant has aroused considerable controversy since an
earthquake fault was discovered nearby in 1977 during its
construction, and the recent design troubles trace to
changes made then to strengthen the facility against possible
earthquake damage.
"Our confidence in their design verification process is not
what it should be," Denton said after hearing officials of Pa
cific Gas & Electric Co., the plant's owner, explain some of
the steps they were taking to track down procedural errors
made prior to the 1977 design changes.
"I find the lack of engineering controls bothersome,"
Denton said.
He said he hopes the new analyses would "put to bed oth
er questions that may arise" in addition to those discovered
in the past two months, all of which trace to incorrect in
formation given a consultant prior to the 1977 design
changes.
Donald Brand, a PG&E vice president, said that in its recent
re-examination of the plant, the company found five new
technical errors that were unrelated to the design problems,
but he characterized these as minor.
Khadafy withdraws from Chad
Paris — Bowing to heavy pressure from African states
strongly backed by the French, Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy abrubtly ordered an immediate withdrawal of his
troops from Chad, it was reported here yesterday.
The withdrawal order was reported from the Chadian cap
ital of Ndjamena by Agence France-Press, the French news
agency. It quoted the local Libyan commander, Col.
Radouane Salah, as saying that he had received a telephone
call from Khadafy in Tripoli, Libya, to move his troops out
"immediately — within two to three days."
AFP reported that the Libyans were loading military equip
ment at Ndjamena airport, but that Col. Salah refused to say
whether the withdrawal involved only his troops in the capi
tal, or all 10,000 Libyan forces in the country.
A formal request for withdrawal of all Libyan forces by the
end of this year was sent to Khadafy Thursday by Chadian
President Goukouni Queddei. He had invited the Libyans
into his country last December to help him win a civil war
and consolidate his power.
Market advances slightly
New York — The stock market posted a slight but broad
advance yesterday and analysts were encouraged because
the market stood its ground after rallies in the previous two
sessions.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose nearly
34 points in the previous two sessions, edged up another 1.90
points to 868.72. The Dow Jones utilities and transportation
measures also were up slightly.
Today's Weather
