# Palo Alto denies gay rights bill
## 
### Dan McMillan 
What many called the most boring
Palo Alto election in recent years
wound down to a finish early this
morning with one major surprise:
the resounding defeat of the gay
rights ordinance, Measure B.
Partial returns also showed the
four incumbents up for reelection to
the nine-member Palo Alto City
Council to have won easily.
With the absentee ballots and 10 of
the 42 precincts counted, Measure B
was losing 60.1 percent to 39.8 per
cent.
Measure B would have prohibited
discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. The measure applied to
hiring, union membership and real
estate transactions, although it would
have excepted other areas such as
occupational qualifications; dress
and conduct regulations which are
job related; seniority; domestic ser
vices and child care in the employer's
home; rental of owner-occupied
space; or religious organizations that
provide services not subsidized by
the city.
The measure has attracted con
siderable attention nationwide, with
many viewing the Palo Alto vote as a
test case in the gay rights battle.
Palo Alto Mayor Alan Henderson
said he was surprised by the meas
ure's defeat: "I thought it was going
to win. I think the (Peninsula) Times
Tribune editorial against it made the
difference." Many of those waiting
for results last night in the city coun
cil chambers agreed with Henderson
that the Times Tribune editorial ex
plained Measure B's defeat; most

were surprised that the measure
failed by such a large margin.
Defeated city council candidate
Doug Winslow offered a different
perspective: "I think Measure B
brought out the conservative vote. A
big reason that I lost was that I am a
more liberal candidate and have
strongly supported Measure B."
The contest for five seats on the
Palo Alto City Council proved less
surprising, The unofficial results
show the four incumbents — Betsy
Bechtel, Lawrence Klein, Ellen
Fletcher and Gary Fazzino — easily
winning. Gail Woolley and Michael
Cobb appeared to have the best
chance for the fifth seat, but no clear
result was available at the Daily's
press time.
Of the votes counted, Bechtel led
with 15.4 percent of the votes
counted, followed by Fazzino with
14.8 percent, Klein with 13.3, and
Fletcher with 13.2. Cobb had 11.4
percent to Woolley's 10.4. Voter
turnout was light, as only 25.6 per
cent of the registered voters turned
out compared with an expected 33 to
35 percent.
"There were no major issues on
which the challengers could criticize
the incumbents," said Henderson.
"This clearly worked to the incum
bents' advantage." Henderson's
comments reflected what has been in
the eyes of most the main character
istic of this election campaign: its
almost complete lack of controversy.
In keeping with the quiet nature of
the campaign, the scene at thecoun
cil chambers, where the results are
posted, was very subdued.
