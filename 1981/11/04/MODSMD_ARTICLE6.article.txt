Was Stanford's founder
a victim of poison plot?

(First of three parts)
(Material for this article was gathered from Univer
sity archives, and newspapers dating from the early
part of this century.)
Just before midnight in a dimly lit room of the
Moana Hotel in Waikiki, a dying woman screamed
out in despair, "Doctor, I have been poisoned!" The
date was Feb. 28,1905, and the woman was Mrs. Jane
Stanford, co-founder of Stanford University.
Was the 77-year-old multi-millionaire murdered, as
later concluded by the doctors who witnessed her
death and by the coroner in Honolulu, or did she die
from natural causes, as David Starr Jordan, then-presi
dent of the University, insisted?
The latter theory was perhaps least supported by
the evidence and the surrounding circumstances, yet
it is the one which triumphed when police closed the
case 76 years ago.
The mystery really began more than a month
before her death in the Stanford's San Francisco man
sion. On Jan. 14,1905, Mrs. Stanford detected a bitter
taste in her Poland mineral water and became slightly
ill. Twoservants, Evelyn Richmond and Bertha Berner,
also sipped the water and agreed that it tasted pecul
iar.
Deadly poison found
The following day, Richmond took the remaining
Poland water to a chemist for analysis. In the bottle,
the chemist found enough strychnine, a chemical
commonly used as rat poison, to kill three people.
Fearing for her life and terrified that someone was
trying to kill her, Mrs. Stanford hired detectives from
the Morse detective agency to follow her servants and
investigate the purported poisoning attempt. She
fired Richmond soon after.
The poisoning incident was not made public until
three weeks later, by which time Mrs. Stanford had
recovered fully from from her illness. But she was liv
ing in constant fear that her assassin would strike
again, so she planned a trip to the Orient to get as far
from San Francisco as possible.
On Feb. 6, Mrs. Stanford purchased a bottle of
bicarbonate of soda from a Palo Alto drug store. A

March 11 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle re
ported that she did so at the suggestion of Berner, her
secretary and long-time companion. One of the ser
vants transferred a portion of that soda into a wide
mouthed jar so that a spoon could be inserted. The jar
was packed on Feb. 14.
One day later, Mrs. Stanford left port, taking with
her only two servants, Berner, and her newly hired
maid, Mae Hunt. The ship was bound for Honolulu,
from where it would continue to the Orient.
Trip raises spirits
Berner later revealed in a letter to her mother that
on board, Mrs. Stanford was still in low spirits and up
set about the alleged poisoning. But aside from some
rough seas, the trip was uneventful.
Upon arriving in Honolulu, the party checked into
the Moana Hotel and spent the next several days
sightseeing in the Islands.
On Feb. 28, Mrs. Stanford awoke to clear skies, her
mind free of the troubles and fears which she had left
far behind in San Francisco. According to those
around her, she was in uncommonly good spirits,
feeling by far the best that she had since the alleged
attempt on her life one month before.
At 10 a.m., she, Berner and Hunt rented a carriage
and set out for a picnic. Mrs. Stanford's only com
plaint was that a loaf of gingerbread which she had or
dered for the picnic the night before had not risen
well. The elderly woman was infuriated by this, but
took the loaf along anyway.
Mrs. Stanford ate voraciously that afternoon, con
suming piece after piece of gingerbread followed by
several ice cream chocolates.
"I was really uneasy for as a rule she ate very careful
ly, scarcely ever much that was sweet as the doctor
had forbidden it," writes Berner in her book, Mrs.
Stanford: An Intimate Account.
After lunch, the three companions admired the
view of Hawaii for a few minutes and then Mrs. Stan
ford, who was unusually spry for her 77 years, found
she was very stiff and needed help getting back to the
carriage.
Mrs. Stanford took a nap later that afternoon

before dinner but ate nothing at the meal because she
said she had eaten heartily at lunch and was not hun
gry. Later in the evening she shared a bowl of soup
with Berner after which the two of them took a short
walk. Berner writes in her book that her mistress ad
mitted to having overeaten grossly that afternoon but
declared it was worth it because she had had such a
wonderful day.
Final hours spent in agony
Mrs. Stanford retired at 9 p.m. aftertaking her usual
cascaret laxative capsule and a teaspoon of
bicarbonate of soda. At this time she had less than
three hours to live.
A Mr. Heunisch, who was a guest in the room next
door, was the first to hear her cries. He reported two
days later in the Chronicle that he was awakened at 11
p.m. by groans from the elderly woman's room. Upon
investigation, he found Mrs. Stanford standing in the
doorway. "She threw up her arms in pain and cried,
'Oh, I am so ill. Get me a doctor!' " he said. Heunisch
then called the hotel doctor, Dr. I.H. Humphris.
Berner was the next to arrive on the scene after she
also heard the cries. She later testified that she had to
massage the dying woman's jaws before she could
give her a warm water emetic because Mrs. Stanford's
jaws had stiffened so.
At 11:20 p.m. Dr. Humphris rushed in and tem
porarily relieved Mrs. Stanford's convulsions by
massaging her and administering hypodermic injec
tions. To him she exclaimed, "Doctor, I have been
poisoned and this is the second time they have tried
to do it." Humphris sent for a stomach pump.
A few minutes later a second, more intense, attack
seized her tormented body at which time Dr. V.H.
Murray, a guest in the hotel, came into the room. But
he was too late to help. With one final convulsion, the
dying woman cried out, "Oh God, forgive me my
sins! This is a horrible death to die!" These words
were her last.
At 11:40 p.m., Mrs. Stanford collapsed, dead, in her
secretary's arms. One minute later, Dr. F.R. Day clam
rnered in with the stomach pump.
