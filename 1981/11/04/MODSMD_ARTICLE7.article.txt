## Medical Center trains its personnel to cope with patient aggression 
### Larry Shubert 
Though hospitals may ap
pear to be serene places, the
high tension in the emergency
room and other areas can lead
to violent outbreaks by pa
tients that pose major prob
lems to staff members. To rem
edy this problem the Medical
Center here has recently in
itiated a new program focusing
on aggression management.
In early September, the Facil
ities Protection Department
sponsored a one day workshop
entitled Understanding, Man
aging and Controlling Ag
gression in the Health Care Set
ting involving 20 key personel
from the emergency room, in
patient psychiatric unit, and
the Facilities Protection De
partment.
Dr. Alan Wickersty began
this program several years ago
in Washington D.C. Since then
he has conducted similar work
shops with hospital Security
and Emergency Department
staffs across the country. In a
pamphlet describing the
course Wickersty said, "The
primary theme is that verbal in
terventions can and will be ef
fective in de-escalating the ma
jority of aggressive incidents."
However, for situations
where violent behavior is un
avoidable or in progress, Wick
ersty also taught physical in

tervention techniques to re
gain control. "Our goal and
professional responsibility is to
control aggression without in
jury of any kind," he said.
Mr. Hilary Ryniewicz, Direc
tor of Safety/Security agreed
with this philosophy. All secur
ity personel are unarmed and
only cany handcuffs as restrain
devices. "We ate a service ori
ented crime deterant, not a po
lice force. Our primary goal is
to protect patients, staff and
the facility," said Ryniewicz.
The course is an intense one
day workshop including lec
ture, discussion, films and sim
ulated training. At the end of
the program, role playing
methods were used to em
phasize and practice tech
niques taught in the course.
Ryniewicz, program coordi
nator, described the workshop
as "fulfilling and all encom
passing." He said that the
course satisfied his primary ob
jective to formulate a team
concept in crisis intervention.
Participants in general
agreed that the most beneficial
and revealing' aspect of the
course was the role playing. In
dividuals involved were able to
view situations from each de
paitments perspective and
learn how each department
approaches and deal with vari
ous problems.
Mr. Wayne Beban, safety se

curity supervisor, commented
that previous to the program
the participating departments
interacted in a negative con
text after the problem had
arisen. The program enabled
staff to discuss and evaluate a
variety of situations which
greatly improved communica
tions and cooperation among
the departments involved.
The need for such a program
is evident in the emergency
room which is a high stress en
vironment. Barbera Behrens,
clinical nursing coordinator,
recalled one incident where a
man came in complaining of a
toothache, and after waiting
for 10 minutes became so im
patient he hurled a table
through a plate glass window in
the waiting room, and had to
be restrained before causing
any further damage.
Greg Homer of the Emer
gency Department said, "The
occasion arises rarely when we
have to resort to physical in
tervention." However, he said
he feels more confident in
dealing with physical situations
because of the techniques
taught in the workshop.
Overall, Ryniewicz was
pleased with the course and
the feedback from partici
pating staff. He said he hopes
to continue this program,ex
panding it to other depart
ments of the hospital as well.
