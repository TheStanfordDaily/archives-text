# Stanford Antarctic research base reopened this week

Most students are familiar with Stan
ford's overseas programs at Cliveden,
Florence and Tours, but few know that
the University will have three scientists
in the Antarctic this year.
This week Stanford reopened Siple,
its Antarctic research station, which had
been inoperative since last year due to
monetary problems.
Stanford first became involved with
Antarctica in 1957 when Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Robert Helliwell, now the
project director, was "invited down to
discover if there was anything we could
do." Since then, the University has also
established a station there, now run by
private contractors in McMurdo
Sound, to carry out biological research.
Stanford's primary emphasis in the
Antarctic has not been on biology, but
rather on the study of radio signals that
are bounced off of the Earth's upper at
mosphere, according to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. John Katsufrakis. Initially,
the scientists recorded radio signals
produced by lightning in Northern
Canada.
These signals followed a curved path,
bouncing off of higher atmospheric
density layers, which act essentially like
"optical fibers," Katsufrakis said. Most
of the sounds that were received re
sembled a whistle, hence the name
"whistlers."
Certain distortions were also picked
up that suggested the interaction be
tween the radio waves and particles in
the outer atmosphere, he said.
Siple was first opened in 1973, with a
new transmitter that allowed scientists
to artificially create whistlers and the
distortions that had been observed
earlier. A 22-kilometer long antenna
was later built at a cost of $80,000. It
would have cost $120 million to get the
same results elsewhere.
The station that was opened in 1973
has since been abandoned because it is
covered by 55 feet of snow. The five to
six feet of snowfall per year will make
the station that was built in 1978 un
inhabitable by 1986. The snowfall also
requires that the 22-kilometer antenna

be raised higher on poles every four
years.
Siple was selected because it is the
only spot on Earth that met all the re
quirements for their research,
Katsufrakis said. Siple is on an ice sheet
that is two kilometers thick, providing a
high base for the horizontal antenna.
Also, it is an especially good spot for ra
dio wave transmission, because its
"conjugating point," where radio
waves focus, is far away from in
terference-causing electrical cables.
Until February 1983, Mike
Dermedziew and Tom Wolf will be the
University's scientists at Siple, and
Pawel Anaszkiewicz will represent Stan
ford at Palmer Station, a support station
that will assist in the research. All three
left yesterday â€” Dermedziew and Wolf
for the staging point of Christchurch,
New Zealand and Anaszkiewicz for
Ushuaia, Argentina.
Dermedziew, who was at Siple in

1979, described the station as "a large
barn," two stories high. The station is
divided into living modules, two
separate labs with individual space for
each ot the three scientists who will be
there, a radio room, and supply rooms.
In the winter, temperatures drop to
minus 40 degrees. This is mild com
pared to the minus 118 degree tem
perature that commonly occurs at the
South Pole. "That's getting down to
where the carbon dioxide in the air is
thinking of freezing up some,"
Dermedziew said. Because of Siple's
better weather and also its larger facil
ities, the researchers can exercise and
stay healthier. While Katsufrakis said
that some of those who return from the
South Pole look like "derelicts from the
canyons of big cities," he hasn't used
that description for anyone coming
back from Siple.
Of the eight people that will "winter
over" (winter in the Antarctic lasts from
February to October, and during that
time there is no access to the outside
world except by radio), the scientists
will climb the ladders to the surface the
least, the five support personnel doing
most of the work that is necessar/ above
ground. According to Permedziew, the
isolation makes "one very sensitive to
the phenomenon one is oberving."
Surprisingly, "colds" are rare at Siple,
because the extremely dry climate
(about two percent humidity) is very
hostile to bacteria and viruses.
Siple also has a lighter side, such as
the Siple vs. Russian research station
chess game of a few years ago. The big
gest celebration occurs on "half-way
there" day in midwinter, on June 21.
Also, around the week to week-and-a
half period in which there are both
nights and days (the rest of the year
being all night or all day) the twilights
"are very spectacular."
Anaszkiewicz became interested in
Antarctic research after hearing "im
pressive stories" from other scientists
about the 'last continent." There is
much left to be discovered from Ant
arctica, and perhaps these scientists will
have some stories of their own to re
ward them for their months of isolation.
