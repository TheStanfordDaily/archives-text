## Engineering students try "team rainbow building" 
### Laurence Brothers 
Engineers often speak of
"gremlins" — mythical
creatures who wreak havoc
in their carefully designed
plans. At Terman Pool
Monday afternoon, the
operative term might better
have been "leprechauns."
The students of Mechanical
Engineering 101 ("Visual
Thinking") labored for four
hours on Design Project #1,
otherwise known as "Team
Rainbow Building."
Every year, the first design
project of ME 101 is set up as
a contest, with prizes
awarded according to
various criteria. Last year,
students had to build a cage
around themselves well
enough to keep out a
hypothetical bumblebee
one foot in diameter.
This year the assignment

read: "Work in teams of five
todesign and build a
structure to span Terman
Pool." Each team was timed
for the event beginning at
the "staging area" (next to
the ramp above Terman
Pool). They were required
to carry five separate
subassemblies, assemble
them to span from "side 1"
to "side 2" of the pool,
release them for 20 seconds,
then dissemble the
structure and return all
materials to the staging area.
The structures were built
from 1 1 /2 40-inch by 60-inch
sheets of foam core (a
plastic structural material)
and hot-melt glue. At the
time of the contest, no glue
could be used in attaching
the five sub-assemblies, and
only tools made from the
original materials were

allowed in the final
construction. The
"rainbows" were then
judged on time, size,
strength and aesthetics,
with a special prize for the
most spectacular t.iilure.
Prof. Bill Verplankof the
Engineering Department
explained how he and Prof.
Dennis Boylearrived at the
idea of rainbow building.
"For years we've been
trying to think of something
to do out here in the pool."
Prof. Verplank described
Visual Thinking as". . . a first
course in design. One of the
aims is to develop fluidity
and flexibility in ideation;
being able to get ideas and
put them on paper quickly."
He said the first project was
designed to givestudentsan
awareness of the design
process.

Prof. Boyle commented
that the rainbow project was
"to get people very
enthusiastic about being
able to use their
imagination." He said that
the course "stresses the
lightside of engineering,"
and added that more than
100 students were turned
away at registration.
ME 101 is primarily for
design and mechanical
engineers, but about 10 to
15outside majorsare
permitted to take the
course. Prof. Boyle said he
would like to see the course
expanded, as ME 101 hasthe
largest attendance of any
engineering class. "It's nice
to have a really mixed
group,"said Verplank.
Boyle added, "Some of the
best people (rainbow
constructors), were from

outside the Engineering
Department."
Student response to ME
101 has been
overwhelmingly favorable.
"We learned a lot. . . how
an engineering group
functions," said one
student. "It's very time
consuming — probably the
first time you have a
drawing class since grade
school," said another.
While several groups
(including the prize-winner
for overall size) built
structures based on a foam
core ribbon, the
constructions and
techniques used were many
and varied. For example, the
winners of the strength
category built their project
using two pole-like lengths
joined to form an arch. On
one length was written

"look ma, no hands!" and
featured a foam-corecutou
of a circus highwire
bicyclist.
One group set up what
would have been a graceful
parabolic arch — but at the
last minute the structure
collapsed — no doubt due
to leprechauns.
Other prizes were given
for speed, for the most
elegant and rainbow-like
structure, and tothe
parabolic arch group for
"the most spectacular
failure." The awards
consisted of yellow tinsel
wrapped chocolate coins,
or as Verplank said, "the
prize at the end of the
rainbow — a pot of gold."
The contest attracted a
crowd of spectators, many
of whom had their own

comments. Freshman Sylvia
Scanlon said, "It's fun to
watch and see how far they
can make it. . . (then) watch
it fall. They get real
embarrassed."
"I think it's very clever,
especially this restriction on
materials — build a bridge
from almost nothing," said
Michael Taksar, a member
of the Operations Research
faculty.
Joyce Chen, a senior in
mechanical engineering
who took the course two
years ago, said, "We had to
make a spider out of foam
core that could pull a five
pound fly into your web. . .
i loved it. It was one of the
things that got me into
design. You learn to be
creative. You learn a new
way of thinking."

"look ma, no hands!" and
featured a foam-corecutou
of a circus highwire
bicyclist.
One group set up what
would have been a graceful
parabolic arch — but at the
last minute the structure
collapsed — no doubt due
to leprechauns.
Other prizes were given
for speed, for the most
elegant and rainbow-like
structure, and tothe
parabolic arch group for
"the most spectacular
failure." The awards
consisted of yellow tinsel
wrapped chocolate coins,
or as Verplank said, "the
prize at the end of the
rainbow — a pot of gold."
The contest attracted a
crowd of spectators, many
of whom had their own

comments. Freshman Sylvia
Scanlon said, "It's fun to
watch and see how far they
can make it. . . (then) watch
it fall. They get real
embarrassed."
"I think it's very clever,
especially this restriction on
materials — build a bridge
from almost nothing," said
Michael Taksar, a member
of the Operations Research
faculty.
Joyce Chen, a senior in
mechanical engineering
who took the course two
years ago, said, "We had to
make a spider out of foam
core that could pull a five
pound fly into your web. . .
i loved it. It was one of the
things that got me into

SOMEWHERE, OVER THE
RAINBOW. . . — As their
first design project, stu
dents in M.E. 101 trans
formed toam core sheets
into airy bridges called
"rainbows" that spanned
the Terman pool on Mon
day afternoon. No pots of
gold w 're reported, how
ever.

Engineers often speak of
"gremlins" — mythical
creatures who wreak havoc
in their carefully designed
plans. At Terman Pool
Monday afternoon, the
operative term might better
have been "leprechauns."
The students of Mechanical
Engineering 101 ("Visual
Thinking") labored for four
hours on Design Project #1,
otherwise known as "Team
Rainbow Building."
Every year, the first design
project of ME 101 is set up as
a contest, with prizes
awarded according to
various criteria. Last year,
students had to build a cage
around themselves well
enough to keep out a
hypothetical bumblebee
one foot in diameter.
This year the assignment

read: "Work in teams of five
todesign and build a
structure to span Terman
Pool." Each team was timed
for the event beginning at
the "staging area" (next to
the ramp above Terman
Pool). They were required
to carry five separate
subassemblies, assemble
them to span from "side 1"
to "side 2" of the pool,
release them for 20 seconds,
then dissemble the
structure and return all
materials to the staging area.
The structures were built
from 1 1 /2 40-inch by 60-inch
sheets of foam core (a
plastic structural material)
and hot-melt glue. At the
time of the contest, no glue
could be used in attaching
the five sub-assemblies, and
only tools made from the
original materials were

allowed in the final
construction. The
"rainbows" were then
judged on time, size,
strength and aesthetics,
with a special prize for the
most spectacular t.iilure.
Prof. Bill Verplankof the
Engineering Department
explained how he and Prof.
Dennis Boylearrived at the
idea of rainbow building.
"For years we've been
trying to think of something
to do out here in the pool."
Prof. Verplank described
Visual Thinking as". . . a first
course in design. One of the
aims is to develop fluidity
and flexibility in ideation;
being able to get ideas and
put them on paper quickly."
He said the first project was
designed to givestudentsan
awareness of the design
process.

Prof. Boyle commented
that the rainbow project was
"to get people very
enthusiastic about being
able to use their
imagination." He said that
the course "stresses the
lightside of engineering,"
and added that more than
100 students were turned
away at registration.
ME 101 is primarily for
design and mechanical
engineers, but about 10 to
15outside majorsare
permitted to take the
course. Prof. Boyle said he
would like to see the course
expanded, as ME 101 hasthe
largest attendance of any
engineering class. "It's nice
to have a really mixed
group,"said Verplank.
Boyle added, "Some of the
best people (rainbow
constructors), were from

outside the Engineering
Department."
Student response to ME
101 has been
overwhelmingly favorable.
"We learned a lot. . . how
an engineering group
functions," said one
student. "It's very time
consuming — probably the
first time you have a
drawing class since grade
school," said another.
While several groups
(including the prize-winner
for overall size) built
structures based on a foam
core ribbon, the
constructions and
techniques used were many
and varied. For example, the
winners of the strength
category built their project
using two pole-like lengths
joined to form an arch. On
one length was written

"look ma, no hands!" and
featured a foam-corecutou
of a circus highwire
bicyclist.
