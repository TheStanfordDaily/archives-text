# China berates Euro-pacifism
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Peking — China is increasingly concerned by
Western Europe's growing pacifist movement,
which it sees as possibly delivering a key ally to
the Soviet Union.
In Peking's view, even if the recent anti-nucle
ar demonstrations in Britain, France, Italy,
Belgium and West Germany were not organized
by Soviet agents, they are nonetheless aiding
Moscow's efforts to divide the West.
Chinese officials have strongly warned West
European visitors and diplomats that the
strategic East-West balance of power, in which
Peking has a vital interest, may be jeopardized
by the new movement, according to diplomats
here.
"The Chinese see the anti-nuclear movement,
the peace movement if you wish, as an extreme
ly dangerous opening for the Soviet Union," a
ranking West European military officer said after
talks with Chinese leaders. "They put it in terms
of a mutual threat and spoke as one ally caution
ing another."

'Chinese foreign policy has assumed a continuing alliance of
interests among japan, the United States, Western Europe and
itself as far as containing the Soviet Union. And this is what
appears to be threatened/
— a Western diplomat

Another visiting West European official said
after his delegation met with Deng Xiaoping, the
Communist Party vice chairman, Premier Zhao
Ziyang and other top Chinese leaders:
"Naive, simple-minded, foolish were the
words they used for these people, assuming the
whole movement is actually not a Soviet front.
They wonder how we can be so blind to what
they perceive as a growing danger and do not
understand why these people oppose prepar
tions to face that danger."
That has become a recurrent theme in the

talks with most visiting West European officials,
including West German Foreign Minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher, Danish Prime Minister
Anker Jorgensen, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden,
Gen. Edmin Bramall, the British chief of staff, and
several parliamentary delegations.
"Chinese foreign policy has assumed a conti
nuing alliance of interests among Japan, the
United States, Western Europe and itself as far as
containing the Soviet Union. And this is what ap
pears to be threatened by European pacificism,"
one West European ambassador said. "They are
not in a panic, but they are concerned, seriously
so, as they believe this is a rather crucial time."
Reject negotiations
Peking radio commentary said about the
pacifist movement's rapid growth in West Ger
many and other countries, "They believe that
the aggressive Soviet plan for armed expansion
can only be thwarted through negotiations."
The commentary accused Moscow of building
up fears of war with a threatening foreign policy
and massive armaments program and then
"carefully using the people's fear of war in

Western Europe to launch one 'peace offensive'
after another."
Peking has expressed particular concern
about the anti-nuclear movement in West Ger
many and the increased anti-Americanism
there.
Although the movement has spread through
most of Western Europe and generated some of
the largest political rallies of the last 35 years, Pe
king says it does not have — at least not yet —
sufficient strength to alter Western policy, but
Peking says that remains a real possibility.
