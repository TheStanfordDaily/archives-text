# Coup jitters worry Thais
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bangkok, Thailand — This
capital city of more than five
million people is currently ex
periencing a periodic ailment
— coup jitters.
News of a possible coup at
tempt has dominated the front
pages of Bangkok newspapers
for four days, prompting Prime
Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to
complain that everybody
would be better off if reporters
found something else to write
about.
The English-language Bang
kok Post urged visiting Ameri
can travel writers not to be
alarmed by press reports of mil
itary activities in Bangkok, not
ing that "such actions have be
come more or less a common
occurrence," especially during
October and early November.
A former Thai ambassador to
Vietnam appealed for national
unity.
The government ordered a
special alert last week after
bombs exploded in the men's
rooms of two government
buildings. Nobody was hurt. At
the same time the rumors
began to circulate that half a
dozen disgruntled former
army colonels were planning
another attempt at overthrow
ing the Prem government.
"Although it has to be ad
mitted" that a number of peo
ple have been killed in Thai po
litical upheavals, the Post re
ported, casualties were in
variably exaggerated and any
way these incidents happen
"very infrequently."
Col. Prachak Sawangchit,
one of the "young turks" who
led an abortive coup against
the Prem government last April
Fool's Day, said he will demand
that parliament ask the govern
ment to explain why he and his
colleagues' homes were sur
rounded and searched last
week.
"He slapped our faces, hit
our heads and then said there
was nothing wrong" Prachak
said, referring to Gen. Arthit
Kamlang-Ek, deputy army
commander and in charge of
the Bangkok peace-keeping
force, whose has risen rapidly
in government circles since he
put down the April 1 coup.
Arthit said he ordered troops
to guard key government in
stallations as a precautionary
measure. Surrounding and
searching the houses of the
"young turks" was to let them
know the government was
aware of their activities, Arthit
said.
All the "Young Turks" were
forgiven and allowed to go free
after the failure of their coup,
which reportedly was the most
throughly botched in the his
tory of Thai coups.
They also were allowed to re
ceive their pensions and other
benefits. Not content with that,
however, the former colonels
are seeking reinstatement.
