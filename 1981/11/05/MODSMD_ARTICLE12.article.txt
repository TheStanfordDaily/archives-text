## Foreign grad students deal with extra housing difficulties 
### Chitra Subramaniam 
You could easily find your
self living off campus, in a room
without a view, over a garage,
with only train tracks and loud
music for company.
This often happens to the
many graduate students at
Stanford who are forced to live
off campus because of an on
canrspus housing shortage.
For one of the many
challenges a graduate student
faces here is finding a place to
live. This is especially true for
foreign students. "Students
who come from Africa assume
that the University will provide
housing," said Namkari
M'Sangi, a neighborhood co
ordinator in Escondido Village.
Not all graduate students ap
ply for on-campus housing and
among those that do, very few
get in. On an average, two out

of every nine graduate stu
dents get assigned space on
campus. There are 1800 spaces
for graduate students and close
to 6000 enroll annually, accord
ing to Jacqueline Parr, assign
ment coordinator for graduate
student housing.
Foreign students usually app
ly for on-campus housing, ac
cording to Jan Marx, director
of Escondido Village and assis
tant dean of student affairs.
Almost half the population in
Escondido is comprised of for
eign students.
"We are really concerned
about the plight of the foreign
students, especially those who
are married and have children
because they have greater
need for housing stability,"
said Marx.
"I think single graduate stu
dents have greater problems

because they have a lof of ad
justing to do," said Roger
Whitney, director of the Uni
versity's housing center and as
sistant dean of student affairs.
In a move to temporarily
ease the problem, the housing
policy has recently been re
vised. According to the new
policy, a housing assignment to
a single graduate student or
married student without chil
dren is limited to an academic
year (or any balance of the year
upon assignment).
Approximately 30 percent of
available spaces will be re
served for continuing students
who may apply if they wish to
be housed on campus during
the next academicyear. If there
are more continuing students
than there are spaces reserved
for them (as will probably be
the case), random numbers will

be given out. The remaining 70
percent of the spaces will be as
signed to new incoming gradu
ate students, said Whitney.
Assignment to students with
children is limited to four
years. Given the off-campus
bias against children and this
group's need for housing sta
bility, they have a different set
of rules. Families assigned fall
and winter quarters and those
already living in the Village are
ineligible for on-campus hous
ing after Aug. 31,1985.
Most graduate students are
not happy about the way the
policy was implemented.
While many were aware such a
move was in the offering, they
had expected public hearings
and discussionson it. "This pol
icy does not solve the prob
lem," said Eric Berg of the
Graduate Student Association

(GSA).
Both Marx and Whitney
agree that the problem re
mains unsolved. "What it does,
though, is give more students
the opportunity to live on cam
pus, especially during their ori
entation period when they will
benefit most from their ex
perience," said Whitney.
"Many foreign students, es
pecially those from Africa, are
under a lot of financial con
straints," said Parr. "Some
countries do not allow money
to be taken out easily and that
makes it difficult for the stu
dents."
For many foreign students, it
is very difficult to have any con
cept of what is reasonable and
what is expensive. For exam
ple, one student from Latin
America with a $200 budget for
housing discovered that he
would probably never firtd a
place.
Though Escondido rates are
cheaper than those outside,
they underwent a 15 percent
increase during 1981-82 and
are expected to go up between
15 to 18 percent next year.
There have been instances in
Escondido when occupants
have not paid their rent be
cause they are unable to cope
with the expenses. "We under
stand that, especially when a
student has to decide between
eating a meal and paying rent,"
said Marx.
So, what do new students
who cannot live on campus
wind up doing?
Many foreign students arrive
at the Bechtel International
Center, often confused, tired

and ready togive up. "They just
collapse, emotionally ex
hausted — that is why we have
cookies in our office to pep
them up," said Roka Haswell,

'Man y foreign
students, especially
those from Africa,

financial
constraints. Some

chairman of the housing com
mittee at the l-Center this year.
As part of the Community
Committee for International
Students (CCIS), the housing
committee operates August
through September, helping
students find places to live.
During this year, about 352
graduate students used the
CCIS to find accomodations,
said Haswell.
Some students find excellent
deals off campus, but such in

stances are very few. "Most
students who come here have
to make compromises and that
can be very hard on them,"
said Lee Zeigler, director of the
l-Center. According to Zeigler,
discrimination can appear
when renters suddenly tell stu
dents the place is taken when
clearly it is not. "African stu
dents have a terrible time,"
said Zeigler.
Many graduate students feel
that the University seems to
focus only on undergraduate
housing, and that most gradu
ates are left fending for them
selves. Last year only 23.3 per
cent of all single graduate stu
dents were housed on campus
as compared to 80 percent of
all single undergraduates who
lived on campus. For freshmen,
the figure was 100 percent on
campus housing.
"It might have been true in
the past that the University was
concerned about under
graduates, but certainly one of
the major projects for the hous
ing office now is to take a look
at the graduate housing prob
lem," said Whitney. A commit
tee has already been set up to
study the matter.
But many graduate students
are skeptical, feeling that the
problem will get bogged down
in bureaucracy. "The Univer
sity ought to get on the ball and
start working," said John Siegel
of the GSA.
In the interim, rents con
tinue to rise without respite,
and graduate students con
tinue to gripe, having been
told at the very outset that it
pays to persevere.

stand that, especially when a

eating a meal and paying rent,"
said Marx.
So, what do new students
who cannot live on campus
wind up doing?
Many foreign students arrive
at the Bechtel International
Center, often confused, tired

and ready togive up. "They just
collapse, emotionally ex

housing

chairman of the housing com
mittee at the l-Center this year.
As part of the Community
Committee for International
Students (CCIS), the housing
committee operates August
through September, helping
students find places to live.
During this year, about 352
graduate students used the
CCIS to find accomodations,
said Haswell.
Some students find excellent
deals off campus, but such in

stances are very few. "Most
students who come here have
to make compromises and that
can be very hard on them,"
said Lee Zeigler, director of the
l-Center. According to Zeigler,
discrimination can appear
when renters suddenly tell stu
dents the place is taken when
clearly it is not. "African stu
dents have a terrible time,"
said Zeigler.
Many graduate students feel
that the University seems to
focus only on undergraduate
housing, and that most gradu
ates are left fending for them
selves. Last year only 23.3 per
cent of all single graduate stu
dents were housed on campus
as compared to 80 percent of
all single undergraduates who
lived on campus. For freshmen,
the figure was 100 percent on
campus housing.
"It might have been true in
the past that the University was
concerned about under
graduates, but certainly one of
the major projects for the hous
ing office now is to take a look
at the graduate housing prob
lem," said Whitney. A commit
tee has already been set up to
study the matter.
But many graduate students
are skeptical, feeling that the
problem will get bogged down
in bureaucracy. "The Univer
sity ought to get on the ball and
start working," said John Siegel
of the GSA.
In the interim, rents con
tinue to rise without respite,
and graduate students con
tinue to gripe, having been
told at the very outset that it
pays to persevere.
You could easily find your
self living off campus, in a room
without a view, over a garage,
with only train tracks and loud
music for company.
This often happens to the
many graduate students at
Stanford who are forced to live
off campus because of an on
canrspus housing shortage.
For one of the many
challenges a graduate student
faces here is finding a place to
live. This is especially true for
foreign students. "Students
who come from Africa assume
that the University will provide
housing," said Namkari
M'Sangi, a neighborhood co
ordinator in Escondido Village.
Not all graduate students ap
ply for on-campus housing and
among those that do, very few
get in. On an average, two out

of every nine graduate stu
dents get assigned space on
campus. There are 1800 spaces
for graduate students and close
to 6000 enroll annually, accord
ing to Jacqueline Parr, assign
ment coordinator for graduate
student housing.
Foreign students usually app
ly for on-campus housing, ac
cording to Jan Marx, director
of Escondido Village and assis
tant dean of student affairs.
Almost half the population in
Escondido is comprised of for
eign students.
"We are really concerned
about the plight of the foreign
students, especially those who
are married and have children
because they have greater
need for housing stability,"
said Marx.
"I think single graduate stu
dents have greater problems

because they have a lof of ad
justing to do," said Roger
Whitney, director of the Uni
versity's housing center and as
sistant dean of student affairs.
In a move to temporarily
ease the problem, the housing
policy has recently been re
vised. According to the new
policy, a housing assignment to
a single graduate student or
married student without chil
dren is limited to an academic
year (or any balance of the year
upon assignment).
Approximately 30 percent of
available spaces will be re
served for continuing students
who may apply if they wish to
be housed on campus during
the next academicyear. If there
are more continuing students
than there are spaces reserved
for them (as will probably be
the case), random numbers will

be given out. The remaining 70
percent of the spaces will be as
signed to new incoming gradu
ate students, said Whitney.
Assignment to students with
children is limited to four
years. Given the off-campus
bias against children and this
group's need for housing sta
bility, they have a different set
of rules. Families assigned fall
and winter quarters and those
already living in the Village are
ineligible for on-campus hous
ing after Aug. 31,1985.
Most graduate students are
not happy about the way the
policy was implemented.
While many were aware such a
move was in the offering, they
had expected public hearings
and discussionson it. "This pol
icy does not solve the prob
lem," said Eric Berg of the
Graduate Student Association

(GSA).
Both Marx and Whitney
agree that the problem re
mains unsolved. "What it does,
though, is give more students
the opportunity to live on cam
pus, especially during their ori
entation period when they will
benefit most from their ex
perience," said Whitney.
"Many foreign students, es
pecially those from Africa, are
under a lot of financial con
straints," said Parr. "Some
countries do not allow money
to be taken out easily and that
makes it difficult for the stu
dents."
For many foreign students, it
is very difficult to have any con
cept of what is reasonable and
what is expensive. For exam
ple, one student from Latin
America with a $200 budget for
housing discovered that he
would probably never firtd a
place.
Though Escondido rates are
cheaper than those outside,
they underwent a 15 percent
increase during 1981-82 and
are expected to go up between
15 to 18 percent next year.
