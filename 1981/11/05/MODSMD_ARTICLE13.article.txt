# Football practice: what goes on between Saturdays

They come in dozens of different sizes,
but almost all of them are big. Every fall
quarter, members of the Stanford football
team hurl themselves into the melee of
college football. They must put up with the
rigors of constant training and the threat of
splintered bones and pulled tendons. They
are pounded, battered, abused and even
verbally criticized constantly. Yet, many of
them think it is all worthwhile.
Attending one of their practices helps
show why. The practice field is a blur of
motion, red and white jerseys charging this
way and that, blocking, catching, hitting.
The players split themselves into a dozen
groups, each with its own coach and its
own drills. The sounds of colliding helmets
and bodies fillsthe late-afternoon air.
When the practice is nearly over, most
players gather around the sidelines waiting
for the final conference with the head
coach.
Two pairs of flailing legs on the ground
indicate that a couple of the players are
wrestling. One is rolled over showing for
the first time the shining white "7"
emblazoned on the back of his jersey.
"That's it, turn 'im over. Heowesus
money," said one.
"Elway's always gettin' into trouble,"
another added. The two finally rise, the
match being roughly a draw.
Craig Awbrey, a second-string nose <

guard, stands along behind the others. "It
can really wear on you after practicing for
two and a half hours a day,"he said. "It's
nothing too serious though . .. they've cut
down a little this week. It was a lot more
intense in high school."
Every Saturday, thefootball teams
becomes the focal point of thousands of
people. The knowledge that such an
awesome mass of potential critics is up
there waiting to cheer or condemn one's
every act would seem to be overwhelming,
but Aubrey said this is not the case.
"You don't really notice the people. If
you're going to concentrate on the people
while you're playing, you're out there for
the wrong reasons," hesaid.
Since there are more than 90 players on
the Stanford team, many spend most of the
game cheering rather than on the field.
Jack Gilmete, a freshman linebacker,
seems to take it admirably. "I don't mind
waiting on the sidelines so much. I
understand what's going on. I only hope
that by the time I'm a senior I'll be out
there."
Billy Reed, a senior, isn't quiteso
understanding. "Of course it's frustrating.
It's frustrating every game when you suit
up and go out there, and you don't play. I
don't know what's worse —watching the
team lose or watching the team win."
John Barns is a freshman Cardinal who
has been out all season because of an
injury. "It happened in the last hard

practice before the Purdue game," he
explained. Blocking against a defensive
player, he had his right knee "caved in" to
the left, shattering the hone. Asa result, he
has been wearingan enormouscast
covering most of his leg for the past six
weeks.
Barns is far from the only Stanford
football player who is out because of
serious injuries. He says that five or six
others are out for the season as well, and
that number will most likely increase
before the end of the season.
"Sure it's frustrating for awhile; you end
up working really hard, and then
something happens and you're out. But it's
just something you have to face. Getting
hurt is part of the game," Barns said.
The practice is over. The last coach has
spoken, and the players head for the
weight room.
They shed their pads, jerseysand
helmets, leaving them scattered outside
like legless bodies on a grassy battlefield.
Inside, an array of potential torture
instruments awaits them — pulleys and
benches, bicycle chains and metal bars.
At one side of the room, a man is
attached to one of the more complex
weight machines. His face is contorted
with strain, his cheeks bright red. He seems
to epitomize the enormity of effort that
human beings are willing to put out for the
sake of a sport.

John Barns is a freshman Cardinal who
has been out all season because of an
injury. "It happened in the last hard

practice before the Purdue game," he
explained. Blocking against a defensive
player, he had his right knee "caved in" to
the left, shattering the hone. Asa result, he
has been wearingan enormouscast
covering most of his leg for the past six
weeks.
Barns is far from the only Stanford
football player who is out because of
serious injuries. He says that five or six
others are out for the season as well, and
that number will most likely increase
before the end of the season.
"Sure it's frustrating for awhile; you end
up working really hard, and then
something happens and you're out. But it's
just something you have to face. Getting
hurt is part of the game," Barns said.
The practice is over. The last coach has
spoken, and the players head for the
weight room.
They shed their pads, jerseysand
helmets, leaving them scattered outside
like legless bodies on a grassy battlefield.
Inside, an array of potential torture
instruments awaits them — pulleys and
benches, bicycle chains and metal bars.
At one side of the room, a man is
attached to one of the more complex
weight machines. His face is contorted
with strain, his cheeks bright red. He seems
to epitomize the enormity of effort that
human beings are willing to put out for the
sake of a sport.
They come in dozens of different sizes,
but almost all of them are big. Every fall
quarter, members of the Stanford football
team hurl themselves into the melee of
college football. They must put up with the
rigors of constant training and the threat of
splintered bones and pulled tendons. They
are pounded, battered, abused and even
verbally criticized constantly. Yet, many of
them think it is all worthwhile.
Attending one of their practices helps
show why. The practice field is a blur of
motion, red and white jerseys charging this
way and that, blocking, catching, hitting.
The players split themselves into a dozen
groups, each with its own coach and its
own drills. The sounds of colliding helmets
and bodies fillsthe late-afternoon air.
When the practice is nearly over, most
players gather around the sidelines waiting
for the final conference with the head
coach.
Two pairs of flailing legs on the ground
indicate that a couple of the players are
wrestling. One is rolled over showing for
the first time the shining white "7"
emblazoned on the back of his jersey.
"That's it, turn 'im over. Heowesus
money," said one.
"Elway's always gettin' into trouble,"
another added. The two finally rise, the
match being roughly a draw.
Craig Awbrey, a second-string nose <

guard, stands along behind the others. "It
can really wear on you after practicing for
two and a half hours a day,"he said. "It's
nothing too serious though . .. they've cut
down a little this week. It was a lot more
intense in high school."
Every Saturday, thefootball teams
becomes the focal point of thousands of
people. The knowledge that such an
awesome mass of potential critics is up
there waiting to cheer or condemn one's
every act would seem to be overwhelming,
but Aubrey said this is not the case.
"You don't really notice the people. If
you're going to concentrate on the people
while you're playing, you're out there for
the wrong reasons," hesaid.
Since there are more than 90 players on
the Stanford team, many spend most of the
game cheering rather than on the field.
Jack Gilmete, a freshman linebacker,
seems to take it admirably. "I don't mind
waiting on the sidelines so much. I
understand what's going on. I only hope
that by the time I'm a senior I'll be out
there."
Billy Reed, a senior, isn't quiteso
understanding. "Of course it's frustrating.
It's frustrating every game when you suit
up and go out there, and you don't play. I
don't know what's worse —watching the
team lose or watching the team win."
