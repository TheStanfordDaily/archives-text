The office of Norman Wessells, dean of hu
manities and sciences, recently announced
that four professors — James Collman, David
Danelski, John Rick and Paul Seaver — have
been given the 1980-81 dean's award for su
perior teaching.
The honorees were selected by Wessells
and an ad hoc committee of faculty members,
who considered peer evaluation of each pro
fessor's teaching, his course planning, or
ganization and development; student reac
tions to each professor's teaching; outside
teaching activities; and effectiveness in direc
ting special academic projects.
Chemistry Prof. Collman has been an in
structor here since 1967, primarily teaching
classes in inorganic and organic chemistry.
In his classes, he believes that formal lec
tures and class recitation sections are com
plementary, and he uses the text as a supple
ment to the lectures. He also tries "to bring
out issues that are related to things in the real
world."
Collman received his higher education
from the University of Nebraska and the Uni
versity of North Carolina. He isalsoa member
of the National Academy of Sciences, Phi Beta
Kappa and Sigma Xi, and has been previously
honored with the National Award in In
organic Chemistry.
Political Science Prof. Danelski teaches
three types of courses: an introductory politi
cal science course, an upper-division course
on civil liberties, and a graduate seminar on
the Supreme Court.
He believes that teaching and research
should not conflict but should reinforce each
other. Being a member of the bar has allowed
him to bring this practical knowledge to all of
his courses on American government, he
said.
Presently a Danforth Associate, he works
with a group of faculty members from across
the nation to improve the relations between
undergraduates and teachers.
Danelski received his law degree from De
Paul University in 1953 and a Ph.D. in 1961
from the University of Chicago. He has been a
partner in two law firms, and he has previous
ly taught at the University of Washington,
Vale and Cornell. He has taught at Stanford
since 1979.
Anthropology Assistant Prof. Rick is prima
rily an undergraduate archaeology instruc
tor. He is particularly interested in the under

graduate archaeology program, which at
tempts to make archaeology an identifiable
area or course of study at Stanford.
Effective teaching is "a two-sided ex
perience" for both students and teachers,
said Rick. In discussion sections he thinks that
students should not be questioned; insead,
questions should be brought out by the dis
cussion itself.
One of Rick's primary teaching tools is the
"hands-on" approach, in which he attempts
to get students and materials together. Thus,
his classes go on field trips to local
archaeological sites and try to carry this ex
perience through to the cultures they are
dealing with.
Professor Rick has been awarded a grant by
the National Science Foundation for field
work in Peru, where, in previous summers, he
has taken a group of six students to explore
archaeological sites. He has been teaching at
Stanford since 1978.
Prof. Seaver, an associate professor of his
tory, believes that effective teaching consists
of lectures which convey a mutual interest in
the subject. However, he also does group
teaching, as well as lectures, for both under
graduates and graduates.
This year, he is teaching a Great Works
course, a course on Tudor and Stuart history,
and a colloquium on the social history in early
modern England.
He believes that both undergraduate and
graduate education are equally important,
but notes that learning on the undergraduate
level is not as professionally oriented as that
on the graduate level.
He received his B.A. from Haverford Col
lege and did his graduate work at Harvard. Af
ter that he taught at Reed College for two
years before coming to Stanford in 1964.
Reactions to the award varied among the
professors; Collman said that he "was more
pleased by that (the award) than I have been
from my scientific awards," while Seaver's in
itial reaction was a milder, "Oh, that's nice."
Danelski believed that the award meant
"that the students are responding positively
to what I do in the classroom," while Rick
commented, "If they think my teaching is
good, why don't they have more teaching
space for archaeology?"
The winners of this year's award will re
ceive a $750 salary increase. Since the first
awards were given in 1975-76, there have
been 53 faculty members of the school so
honored.

that four professors — James Collman, David
Danelski, John Rick and Paul Seaver — have
been given the 1980-81 dean's award for su
perior teaching.
The honorees were selected by Wessells
and an ad hoc committee of faculty members,
who considered peer evaluation of each pro
fessor's teaching, his course planning, or
ganization and development; student reac
tions to each professor's teaching; outside
teaching activities; and effectiveness in direc
ting special academic projects.
Chemistry Prof. Collman has been an in
structor here since 1967, primarily teaching
classes in inorganic and organic chemistry.
In his classes, he believes that formal lec
tures and class recitation sections are com
plementary, and he uses the text as a supple
ment to the lectures. He also tries "to bring
out issues that are related to things in the real
world."
Collman received his higher education
from the University of Nebraska and the Uni
versity of North Carolina. He isalsoa member
of the National Academy of Sciences, Phi Beta
Kappa and Sigma Xi, and has been previously
honored with the National Award in In
organic Chemistry.
Political Science Prof. Danelski teaches
three types of courses: an introductory politi
cal science course, an upper-division course
on civil liberties, and a graduate seminar on
the Supreme Court.
He believes that teaching and research
should not conflict but should reinforce each
other. Being a member of the bar has allowed
him to bring this practical knowledge to all of
his courses on American government, he
said.
Presently a Danforth Associate, he works
with a group of faculty members from across
the nation to improve the relations between
undergraduates and teachers.
Danelski received his law degree from De
Paul University in 1953 and a Ph.D. in 1961
from the University of Chicago. He has been a
partner in two law firms, and he has previous
ly taught at the University of Washington,
Vale and Cornell. He has taught at Stanford
since 1979.
Anthropology Assistant Prof. Rick is prima
rily an undergraduate archaeology instruc
tor. He is particularly interested in the under

graduate archaeology program, which at
tempts to make archaeology an identifiable
area or course of study at Stanford.
Effective teaching is "a two-sided ex
perience" for both students and teachers,
said Rick. In discussion sections he thinks that
students should not be questioned; insead,
questions should be brought out by the dis
cussion itself.
One of Rick's primary teaching tools is the
"hands-on" approach, in which he attempts
to get students and materials together. Thus,
his classes go on field trips to local
archaeological sites and try to carry this ex
perience through to the cultures they are
dealing with.
Professor Rick has been awarded a grant by
the National Science Foundation for field
work in Peru, where, in previous summers, he
has taken a group of six students to explore
archaeological sites. He has been teaching at
Stanford since 1978.
Prof. Seaver, an associate professor of his
tory, believes that effective teaching consists
of lectures which convey a mutual interest in
the subject. However, he also does group
teaching, as well as lectures, for both under
graduates and graduates.
This year, he is teaching a Great Works
course, a course on Tudor and Stuart history,
and a colloquium on the social history in early
modern England.
He believes that both undergraduate and
graduate education are equally important,
but notes that learning on the undergraduate
level is not as professionally oriented as that
on the graduate level.
He received his B.A. from Haverford Col
lege and did his graduate work at Harvard. Af
ter that he taught at Reed College for two
years before coming to Stanford in 1964.
Reactions to the award varied among the
professors; Collman said that he "was more
pleased by that (the award) than I have been
from my scientific awards," while Seaver's in
itial reaction was a milder, "Oh, that's nice."
Danelski believed that the award meant
"that the students are responding positively
to what I do in the classroom," while Rick
commented, "If they think my teaching is
good, why don't they have more teaching
space for archaeology?"
The winners of this year's award will re
ceive a $750 salary increase. Since the first
awards were given in 1975-76, there have
been 53 faculty members of the school so
honored.
The office of Norman Wessells, dean of hu
manities and sciences, recently announced
