## Alec Rawls Thoughts on AWACS, justice and legislation of morality 
### 
I have a few different things to say
today. First, cheers for the AWACS
vote. As military strategy it is stupid,
but that pales besideihe political sig
nificance. The vote could be a sign
that Israeli desires will no longer be
considered sacrosanct in U.S. foreign
policy. If so it should be read as a con
sequence of U.S. exasperation with
Israeli intransigence and foot drag
ging on peace processes. It would be
the first time Israeli policies have
brought down any negative conse
quences from Israel's powerful spon
sor. It's about time.
I think that Israeli intransigence
and foot dragging has been aimed

I don't doubt that, if they could, the Begin
government, and probably the majority of
Israelis, would wish the Palestinians out of
ever having existed. But this is not an attitude
that the United States can sponsor.,

largely at consolidating their land
grabbing on the West Bank. The plea
is that the West Bank must be secured
for its strategic vantagepoint, and
that the Palestinians must remain
subjugated, presumably because
they don't want to live in peace. But
land grabbing and subjugation are
not the way to security for Israel. The
Jews have also been a displaced peo
ple, and should understand better.
The Palestinians will fight so long as
they are displaced and so long as they
are subjugated. Begin calls the
Palestinians an "implacable foe," and
points to the PLO charter (on Issues
and Answers). But how long ago was
Egypt an "implacable foe?"
I don't doubt that, if they could,
the Begin government, and probably
the majority of Israelis, would wish
the Palestinians out of ever having ex
isted. But this is not an attitude that
the United States can sponsor. Nor
will we sponsor it, as I hope we can,
and Begin will, read into the AWACS
vote.
Second item: is anybody miffed,
like I am, by the way the president
gets away with choosing which laws
the Justice Dept. will prosecute, i.e.
enforce? It's this guy Baxter that Rea
gan appointed to quash anti-trust ac
tions that gets me. Another anti-trust

suit was being dropped last week.
The problem is that the Justice
Dept. has scarce resources and must
make choices as to which cases to
» prosecute. Presidents take advantage
of this to prosecute the laws they fa
vor and ignore those they don't. Rea
gan has, of course, taken advantage
masterfully. Washington law firms
are inundated with businessmen ask
ing for the inside word on how far
they can now break the law with im
punity.
It seems to me that there is a per
fectly viable objective grounds for
choosing which cases to prosecute.
When an economist (which I find

myself blossoming into these days) is
faced with the problem of allocating
the Justice Dept.'s scarce resources,
he immediately says "ah ha!" Al
locate the Dept.'s resources to those
cases which will yield the greatest im
pact per amount of resources spent
on them. If that impact turns out to
be a big mistake, then it is up to the
Congress to redress that by changing
the law. Legislation is the job of the
Congress, not the President.
It might be desirable to delegate
sc me legislative power to the presi
dent in this area, but such delegation
should undergo the same intensive
scrutinization for constitutionality
that all other forms of delegated leg
islative power undergo.
This criteria might also be imposed
on the Supreme Court in its selection
of cases. Then the Supreme Court
could not, for instance, have avoided
ruling on the constitutionality of the
Vietnam war. As it was, Congress
never even debated the war, the big
gest issue over a fifteen year period.
A Supreme court ruling could have
forced the Congress to consider the
war explicitly. It is a detriment to our
system whenever an important legal
issue is hopscotched.
Time for some sport. Marc
Rosaaen wrote his opinion last Friday

that simple moral feeling — attrac
tion or revulsion — is sufficient
grounds for legislating, in particular,
for outlawing abortion, by constitu
tional amendment if necessary. But
the touchstone of a society that at
tempts to secure broad liberties is a
consensus that, just because you
don't like what someone else is
doing, that is not sufficient grounds
for forcing them not to do it.
Legislating on the grounds
Rosaaen urges, voting to outlaw any
behavior that repels you, forcing oth
ers not to behave that way (if the ma
jority feels and votes the same way),
would trash liberalism. Our present
constitution, embodying many of the
principles of classical liberalism, can,
of course, be trashed. The question
is, is it O.K. to do that? Is it O.K. to
trash liberalism? De Tocqueville
warned, with his "tyranny of the ma
jority," that not all courses a de
mocracy can follow are equally
cheerful.
Neither has "moral" legislation
always been the rule, as Rosaaen
claims. While the legislation of the
60's can be viewed as moral legisla
tion, as Rosaaen indicates that any
legislation can be viewed as moral, it
is not appropriately viewed that way.
Civil rights legislation of the 60's can
easily be recognized as pursuant to
the requirements of classical liber
alism. Also, the social programs,
however inept they might be, can be
seen as recognizing that basic liber
ties can be impaired by a dearth of
opportunities and control over re
sources. (No less a scholar than
Milton Friedman screwed this up in
his claim that modern political liber
alism is contrary to classical liber
alism.)
Liberalism provides a framework
for legislating that is the antithesis of
the "moral" grounds — of attraction
or revulsion — that Rosaaen seems to
think is sufficient for telling others
what to do. What if the majority of
people felt that gays should be
forced to wear their pants
backwards? The thought of tamper
ing with the constitution in as ig
norant and stupid an age as our own
definitely bothers me.

ever having existed. But this is not an attitude
that the United States can sponsor.,

largely at consolidating their land
grabbing on the West Bank. The plea
is that the West Bank must be secured
for its strategic vantagepoint, and
that the Palestinians must remain
subjugated, presumably because
they don't want to live in peace. But
land grabbing and subjugation are
not the way to security for Israel. The
Jews have also been a displaced peo
ple, and should understand better.
The Palestinians will fight so long as
they are displaced and so long as they
are subjugated. Begin calls the
Palestinians an "implacable foe," and
points to the PLO charter (on Issues
and Answers). But how long ago was
Egypt an "implacable foe?"
I don't doubt that, if they could,
the Begin government, and probably
the majority of Israelis, would wish
the Palestinians out of ever having ex
isted. But this is not an attitude that
the United States can sponsor. Nor
will we sponsor it, as I hope we can,
and Begin will, read into the AWACS
vote.
Second item: is anybody miffed,
like I am, by the way the president
gets away with choosing which laws
the Justice Dept. will prosecute, i.e.
enforce? It's this guy Baxter that Rea
gan appointed to quash anti-trust ac
tions that gets me. Another anti-trust

suit was being dropped last week.
The problem is that the Justice
Dept. has scarce resources and must
make choices as to which cases to
» prosecute. Presidents take advantage
of this to prosecute the laws they fa
vor and ignore those they don't. Rea
gan has, of course, taken advantage
masterfully. Washington law firms
are inundated with businessmen ask
ing for the inside word on how far
they can now break the law with im
punity.
It seems to me that there is a per
fectly viable objective grounds for
choosing which cases to prosecute.
When an economist (which I find

myself blossoming into these days) is
faced with the problem of allocating
the Justice Dept.'s scarce resources,
he immediately says "ah ha!" Al
locate the Dept.'s resources to those
cases which will yield the greatest im
pact per amount of resources spent
on them. If that impact turns out to
be a big mistake, then it is up to the
Congress to redress that by changing
the law. Legislation is the job of the
Congress, not the President.
It might be desirable to delegate
sc me legislative power to the presi
dent in this area, but such delegation
should undergo the same intensive
scrutinization for constitutionality
that all other forms of delegated leg
islative power undergo.
This criteria might also be imposed
on the Supreme Court in its selection
of cases. Then the Supreme Court
could not, for instance, have avoided
ruling on the constitutionality of the
Vietnam war. As it was, Congress
never even debated the war, the big
gest issue over a fifteen year period.
A Supreme court ruling could have
forced the Congress to consider the
war explicitly. It is a detriment to our
system whenever an important legal
issue is hopscotched.
Time for some sport. Marc
Rosaaen wrote his opinion last Friday

that simple moral feeling — attrac
tion or revulsion — is sufficient
grounds for legislating, in particular,
for outlawing abortion, by constitu
tional amendment if necessary. But
the touchstone of a society that at
tempts to secure broad liberties is a
consensus that, just because you
don't like what someone else is
doing, that is not sufficient grounds
for forcing them not to do it.
Legislating on the grounds
Rosaaen urges, voting to outlaw any
behavior that repels you, forcing oth
ers not to behave that way (if the ma
jority feels and votes the same way),
would trash liberalism. Our present
constitution, embodying many of the
principles of classical liberalism, can,
of course, be trashed. The question
is, is it O.K. to do that? Is it O.K. to
trash liberalism? De Tocqueville
warned, with his "tyranny of the ma
jority," that not all courses a de
mocracy can follow are equally
cheerful.
Neither has "moral" legislation
always been the rule, as Rosaaen
claims. While the legislation of the
60's can be viewed as moral legisla
tion, as Rosaaen indicates that any
legislation can be viewed as moral, it
is not appropriately viewed that way.
Civil rights legislation of the 60's can
easily be recognized as pursuant to
the requirements of classical liber
alism. Also, the social programs,
however inept they might be, can be
seen as recognizing that basic liber
ties can be impaired by a dearth of
opportunities and control over re
sources. (No less a scholar than
Milton Friedman screwed this up in
his claim that modern political liber
alism is contrary to classical liber
alism.)
Liberalism provides a framework
for legislating that is the antithesis of
the "moral" grounds — of attraction
or revulsion — that Rosaaen seems to
think is sufficient for telling others
what to do. What if the majority of
people felt that gays should be
forced to wear their pants
backwards? The thought of tamper
ing with the constitution in as ig
norant and stupid an age as our own
definitely bothers me.

I have a few different things to say
today. First, cheers for the AWACS
vote. As military strategy it is stupid,
but that pales besideihe political sig
nificance. The vote could be a sign
that Israeli desires will no longer be
considered sacrosanct in U.S. foreign
policy. If so it should be read as a con
sequence of U.S. exasperation with
Israeli intransigence and foot drag
ging on peace processes. It would be
the first time Israeli policies have
brought down any negative conse
quences from Israel's powerful spon
sor. It's about time.
