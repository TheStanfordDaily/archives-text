## Oxford offers opportunities 
### 
I was very pleased to read the
O'Reilly, et al, article (Daily Oct. 30),
in response to Joe Rodota's column
concerning the Cliveden campus. I
too feel a need to respond to Mr.
Rodota's column, because he was
not only shallow in his approach — a
point well made in the O'Reilly, et al,
article — but also he missed the point
entirely regarding the reasons for
moving the Stanford-in-Britain pro
gram from Cliveden to Oxford.
Rodota's column, from the head
line, implies that Stanford's efforts to
move Oxford are only motivated by a
desire to escape the Clivedon facility
and the supposedly angered British
people in the surrounding area. I am
convinced by both recent conversa
tions with Mark Mancall, Director of
Overseas Studies, and my ex
periencesasan undergraduateatOx
ford that this is patently untrue.
Oxford, as a university and a city,
offers a conglomeration of op
portunities to Stanford students,
which cannot be found anywhere
else in Great Britain. Academically, it
offers students access to unparalleled
faculty and library resources. The im
portance of this cannot be over
estimated, because the Oxford sys
tem of tutorials compels direct stu
dent contact with their professors
and extensive use of the library facil

ities. Clearly, an institution of thesize
and reputation of Oxford can pro
vide students far more than can the
Cliveden campus.
Of perhaps even greater influence
on Stanford's decision to try to locate
in Oxford is the city's cultural and po
litical attributes. Oxford lies in the
center of Southern England and in
the heart of the Cotswolds. It is well
linked by train and bus to London,
Cambridge, Stratford, and other ma
jor cities. Moving to Oxford would
solve one of many Cliveden students'
most vehement complaints: isola
tion.
Further, by being in a city as op
posed to a secluded estate, and as
sociated with a British university rath
er than just an American one, Stan
ford students would be immersed in
a different lifestyle, exposed to wide
ly varying experiences and people,
and given an opportunity to learn in
ways in addition to reading books
and attending lectures.
Contrary to Rodota's views, I be
lieve that Stanford students are
capable of civil interaction with the
British: the facts show that they have
demonstrated the necessary respon
sibility at Oxford each year. If it is not
for the opportunity to really live in a
different culture and interact with

other people, then why do students
go to an overseas campus?
Rodota unfortunately missed the
point when he tried to construe Stan
ford's efforts to move from Cliveden
to Oxford as abandoning a sinking
ship and fleeing from maltreated
natives. This is not the case. The move
would be only to provide Stanford
students with the greater academic,
cultural, and political benefits avail
able at Oxford.
