# Psych. graduates urged elsewhere

Stanford undergraduates majoring
in psychology who plan to earn an
advanced degree in that field are en
couraged by the department to do so
— as long as they choose a graduate
school other than Stanford.
Unlike many departments, psy
chology actively discourages under
graduates from continuing their psy
chology studies here. The depart
ment takes the view that it is in a Stan
ford student's best interest to under
take research at more than one in
stitution. This, in turn, enables the
department to acquire "new blood,"
that is, students who spent their un
dergraduate years at other institu
tions.
Although therearesomeextenuat
ing circumstances in which under
graduates are permitted to pursue an
advanced degree here, Psychology
Prof. Lee Ross, director of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education,
cited three reasons that the depart
ment discourages this practice.
The first reason, said Ross is that
"the best students will have (already)
gotten the major benefits" out of the
program, and the marginal returns of
further work here would be

diminishing. Ross added that while it
may Be Comfortable for under
graduates to remain here "it is not
good for them."
Second, the program is only as di
verse as its students, according to
Ross. Thus, the greater the student
turnover, the greater the number of
new ideas the department can adopt.
Third, Stanford undergraduates
majoring in psychology would have
an unfair advantage in the admissions
process since their strengths and
weaknesses are much more familiar
to the department than those of out
siders.
"The philosophy in experimental
psychology programs is that it is wiser
for students to learn from other
teachers, thereby broadening their
horizons," said Linda Heider, an ad
ministrative assistant in the depart
ment.
All undergraduates do research,
said Heider, and there is more in
teraction and exchange between fac
ulty and students when learning is
not confined to a single university.
. he research knowledge students ac
quire here "more or less enlightens
people at new institutions," she said.
