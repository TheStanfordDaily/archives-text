## Latin America: relations confusing 
### 
How the United States is to relate
to military authoritarian govern
ments of Latin America is the biggest
— and possibly most unsolvable —
problem of U.S. foreign policy in this
hemisphere.
There are various species of gov
ernments in Latin America, and prob
lems of dealing with each are dif
ferent. Of these, the United States
has best relations with the de
mocracies. This country finds mod
erate democracies congenial, and
there is little friction with them.
Moreover, in these pluralistic socie
ties, there are innumerable channels
of interchange; commercial, cultural
and so forth. On the other hand, seri
ous problems arise in treating dic
tatorships, such as Haiti, or strongly
oligarchic regimes, such as
Guatemala. These regimes credit
themselves with being anti-com
munist, and are applauded for it.
Closeness to them has serious disad
vantages, however. They are corrupt
and abusive of their people. Conse
quently, for the United States to as
sociate itself with them is a discredit
in the eyes of people in the United
States and around the world.
The temptation is strong, however,
to side with the regime in power.
There are advantages to working
with strong governments. They are
able to act freely and respond quickly
without troubling with constitutional
processes or public opinion; they
can reassure American diplomats of
their friendship and of their firm op
position to communism; they stand
for law and order, and it may seem
forgivable if they overdo this in the
name of combatting subversion.
They favor private ownership in the
ory and in the practice of their clique,
whose members may become large
scale entrepreneurs, and they are
probably prepared to make mutually

advantageous arrangements with
foreign corporations.
Most important to consider is the
policy toward the modern and so
phisticated corporate military re
gimes of the larger and wealthier
countries of South America, especial
ly Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and
Chile. These regimes avoid a major
weakness of the traditional dic
tatorship in that they are not tied to a
single individual. Moreover, they are
more orderly, less exploitative, and
better organized than personal dic-

tatorships. They are ideologically
anti-communist, and theoretically
and practically favorable to market
economies and free enterprise. They
allow freedom of religion, and the
press is censored only negatively, to
exclude criticism. They also promise
being rather distant in Argentina and
Chile, but much nearer in Brazil.
For such reasons, there are pow
erful temptations to cultivate good
relations with these militarily-gov
erned countries. They are economi
cally and politically important, and it
would be quite undesirable to have
their emnity. They are effectively
anti-communist and corresponding
ly congenial to anti-communist lead
ers in Washington. It may seem that
there is much to gain in cultivating
their friendships.
This lineof reasoning mightappear
to answer rather simply the question
of how to deal with such regimes. Re
ality is more challenging. Military
governments are definitely' il
legitimate, so far as their claim to
government rests simply on their
having turned the arms entrusted to
them for the defense of the state
against the civilian government.
Their rule is arbitrary in theory and
practice, and the victims of arbitrary
police or security forces cannot be
ignored in a world where they be
come known and publicized.
The United States cannot smile on
the political theory or the ethics of
government by force. To do so
weakens the prestige and example of
the United States throughout the
world and discourages the democrat

ic movements that lie in the Ameri
can interest to encourage.
A military government may have
adopted market economy policies in
reaction to populist interventionism,
and it may possess the self-discipline
and prudence to allow fairly free pro
duction, but it likely that the op
portunities for squeezing private
wealth or making jobs for worthy of
ficers will prevail in the long run.
Only under a legalistic constitutional
order can privateenterprisefeel real
ly safe.
It must be concluded that the mili
tary government is perhaps conve
nient, but not really a reliable parter
for the United States, and there is lit
tle we can do about it. There is simply
not much leverage to be exercised
over such large countries as Brazil
and Argentina, and any policy seen as
markedly hostile would be coun
terproductive.
The United States would like to as
sist military regimes toward mod
erate democratic systems like the
United States and the Western in
dustrial nations in general.
For this purpose, the first principle
might be to maximize mutually ad
vantageous relations. The second
principle would be to avoid offend
offending or causing distrust in the
Latin nation. An example would be
the application of special duties, usu
ally slight, but nonetheless noxious,
on their manufactured exports. Such
trade barriers, of no economic utility
to the United States cause dispropor
tionate resentment in countries that
believe the United States could assist,
not hinder, their industrialization.
Third, in many small ways, the Unit,ed
States can encourage democratic
forces without greatly irritating the
military power-holders, as, for exam
ple, in relations with many nonof
ficial organizations.
Few Latin American nations found
a way to offer political rights to all
without opening the door to ex
tremism: Mexico, thanks*to oil mon
ey; Costa Rica, thanks to a relatively
well-structured society. If military
governments can work out their own
ways of coping with the dilemma of
need for democracy versus troubles
of populism, if will auger very well for
the future of Latin America — and
the world. If they cannot, we are sure
to see more swings of the pendulum
and further problems for American
foreign policy.
