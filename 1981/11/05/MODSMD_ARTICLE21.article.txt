## Blaming Golden Spike groundless and unfair 
### 
It is my opinion that remarks at
tributed to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons placing blame on the
Golden Spike restaurant for the re
cent tragic accident are thoughtless,
unfair, and without merit.
Most bars have a nightly "ad
vertised special," usually in the form
of a "happy hour." His conclusion
that this legitimate practice is wrong
because it represents a "craving for
profit" and unfocused observation
that "there is something unnecessary
about it" defy any test of reason
ableness. He seems to imply that the
proximity of the university warrants a
strict regulation of local businesses,
even to the point of denying them
rights they enjoy elsewhere.
Liquor flows freely on campus, and
its presence is frequently advertised
on White Plaza signs. Just the other

night Peninsula Times Tribune pub
lished a photo of one of the
fraternities with beer cans afloat in its
pond and littering the yard. Perhaps
other living groups are more dis
creet, but it would be disingenuous
to deny that the same beer sold by
the restaurant is also available in our
own backyard. This fact alone makes
his attack on the restaurant unfair.
Drinking drivers are a difficult so
cial problem, but their behavior will
not be controlled by regulating the
advertising of alcohol any more than
Prohibition stopped them. Tough
new drinking driver laws taking ef
fect in a few weeks are a step in the
right direction. But placing blame on
the restaurant only directed atten
tion away from more likely causes.
