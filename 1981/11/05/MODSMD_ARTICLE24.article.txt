# Nurses burn out under stress

from the Daily wires
Pamela Patrick entered intensive-care nursing
because it promised the excitement and
challenge of helping people through dramatic,
life-and-death situations.
She quit for the same reasons.
"Granted, nursing is a stressful job. You're
dealing with people in crisis . . . you see peak
emotions — high and low — and it can get very
intense. That's one reason people are attracted
to the field."
But in addition to the unavoidable stresses in
herent in the work, nurses — and other health
care professionals — are subjected to numerous
"avoidable" stresses, says Patrick, that make
things worse.
"It's common for nurses to work rotating shifts
(switching frequently from day to night) and
double shifts (16 hours straight), so you're con
stantly fatigued and your body clock is always
mixed up. Usually, nurses get no say in their own
scheduling.
"There often aren't enough nurses, so you
have more patients than you can reasonably
handle. And you wind up running errands,
doing paperwork, being pulled away from pa
tient care. Sometimes it seems like you're doing
everything but nursing,"
Coupled with low pay — "street cleaners earn
more than starting nurses" — and "lack of pro-,
fessional respect," these stresses are prompting
thousands of nurses to turn in their caps.
"Nurses," says Patrick, "are burning out and
dropping out in epidemic proportions."
But unlike other victims of "nurse burnout,"
Patrick didn't leave the health-care field when
she quit clinical nursing 10 years ago. She went
on to earn a doctorate in psychology and estab
lish "a burnout prevention and treatment" pro
gram for staffers at a Midwestern hospital.
She now presents workshops on "health-care
worker burnout" throughout the country and

has completed a book on the subject for Blue
Cross and Blue Shield Associations. The insur
ance company's interest in the problem stems,
she says, from the "billions of dollars'' associa
tion officials claim it costs the health care in
dustry.
While burnout affects other professions —
from teachers to business executives — Patrick
says it's particularly severe among health-care
workers in general and nurses in particular.
"A hospital is a highly stressful environment.
It's like a self-contained city that's working 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. You're constantly
dealing with people in crisis... a patient in pain,
a family member in emotional distress.
"Nurses tend to start out very idealistic. They
tend to work through breaks, stay overtime,
even cancel vacations, because patients who
need them seem much more important than
their own tired feet."
Patrick, 35, says her own experience was typi
cal. "In my first week as a critical-care nurse, I
was responsible for three patients in a unit
where I should have had one, or at most two.
"Patients would come in directly from surgery
or an accident and need constant monitoring.
On a routine case you'd have to take critical
measurements every five minutes, in between
which you'd dress wounds, give medication,
stop a bleed. Caring for one patient can be ex
hausting . . . three is next to impossible."
Then there were the long hours. "It's common
to work 12 days in a row, get one day off, then
start an evening shift. It messes up your sleep
pattern and your family life. You're chronically
fatigued, emotionally drained."
And nurses are still fighting "the old, tradi
tional battles with doctors and administrators,"
she says. "There's a lot of lip service paid to the
idea that you're an important member of the
health-care team, but nurses get little pro
fessional respect."
