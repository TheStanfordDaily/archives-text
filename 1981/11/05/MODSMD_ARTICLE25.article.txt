## Movies/Steve Vineberg Two failed social statements 
### 
In the first scene of Prin/ce of the City, Treat
Williams lies in bed with Lindsay Crouse,
looking as tormented as a junkie in a TV crime
show who hasn't had a fix in 24 hours; there is
a persistent pounding on the soundtrack that
he says is someone knocking on the door, but
it sounds to us like the theme music from an
occult horror picture. I didn't dislike this
movie; I detested it. Prince of the City runs
for two hours and 47 minutes, and almost all
of it is unbearable.
Uneven as his career has been, Sidney
Lumet is a director whose movies are general
ly worth seeing; he's sloppily efficient (pro
ducers love him because he always makes
deadlines), but he brings a raucous urban
energy to his work, and his track record with
actors is, impressive. Since he demonstrated
early, in Long Day's Journey into Night, that
he is capable of first-rate craftsmanship, pre
sumably he makes movies of no visual distinc
tion by choice, i.e. he is more interested in
character and pace and dialogue than he is in
framing a sequence in an interesting, memo
rable way. (When I was an undergraduate in
the early '70s, my friends and I used to joke
that Lumet's.movies always looked like they'd
been shot through a mud filter.) In his best
pictures, like the classic Dog Day Afternoon,
what used to be called "production values"
don't matter, because the acting is enthrall
ing; Lumet's gift for solid American natural
ism wins through. (That's why he was such an
inappropriate director for Equus, and the re
sults were predictable: he tried to turn a
stylized stage piece into a naturalistic film,
with Richard Burton reciting Dysart's mono
logues at the dinner table.)
Prince of the City is a story about New York
City cops, based on fact (Special Investigator
Danny Ciello's agreement to turn over his
colleagues to a commission on police corrup
tion), but it's n.ot much like Dog Day After
noon or Lumet's earlier pop drama Serpico.
Lumet has taken great care with the look of
this movie: moist and shiny, it suggests that
he conceived the entire picture as transpiring
in a steam room. It's wilfully ugly. And in
short, deliberate takes, the cast performs as
though they'd spent days in that goddamned
room — we don't get any rest from their bug
eyed, overheated actorishness. Every scene
begins at its climax, so that we never under
stand what drove these people to such ex
treme states of hysteria. Ciello and his friends
and the endless series of attorneys and feder
al agents all seem to have stepped out of a bad
old Playhouse 90 teleplay.
The worst offender is Treat Williams, who,
as Danny Ciello, remains on screen for prac
tically all of the three hours. I thought Wil
liams charming as Berger, the hippie chief in
Hair: when he lifted his foot onto the ban
quet table at the debutante party in the"I Got
Life" number, I felt the same mixture of hor
ror and delight Michel Simon inspired in Re
noir's Boudu Saved from Drowning when he
wiped his filthy shoes on his hostess's
bedspread. But in a non-musical setting, Wil
liams needs toning down, and Lumet revs him
up. He's on fire throughout Prince of the City
— except for one small, gratifying, unstressed
conversation with a gangster cousin on a ferry
— and it's such an assaulting, unvaried con
flagration that you want to seek refuge under
your seat. Why does he arrive at the home of
the D.A. in charge of the investigation (Nor
man Parker) in the middle of the night, al
ready close to tears? Why does he tell anec
dotes about his experiences on the force as
though they were Lenny Bruce routines? He's
like an alarm clock that won't turn off. When
some performers give tour de force star turns
— like Bette Midler in The Rose and Divine
Madness, or Richard Pryor in his concert
movie — you wonder where they draw all
that adrenalin from; when you watch Wil
liams, you wonder why someone on the set
didn't just hand him a couple of Demerols.
In contrast to Treat Williams —and Richard
Foronjy, Don Billett, Carmine Coridi, Kenny
Marino, Tony Page, and the others who re
flect Lumet's distorted acting class approach
— Jerry Orbach, whose background in big
Broadway musicals like Promises, Promises
and Chicago and 42nd Street might lead one
to expect just the sort of camera-eating ev
eryone else does in this movie, is a wonderful
surprise. As Gus Levy, the only one of Ciello's
fellow cops who refuses to buckle under to
the pressure of the commission, Orbach gives
a subtle, intricately worked out performance.
He's so assured that he doesn't need to slam,
and his understatement is so genuine in the
midst of all the fraudulent hyperactivity that
we're riveted to him. Everyone in Prince of
the City gets a big explosion scene, but Levy's
is the only one that makes sense, because it
emerges from an established character — so
of course it is the only one with real power.
And since Orbach mostly appears in the last
hour, he supplies our reward for having en
dured the rest.
Prince of the City is Sidney Lumet's Big
One; it smacks of significance. Lumet and his
co-screenwriter Jay Presson Allen seem to
think they have something so important to
say in this movie that they don't have to both
er structuring it or modulating the tone or es
tablishing motivation for the characters. (We
never find out why Danny tells on his friends
or why they allow themselves to be destroyed
by him.) But what is the movie saying, any
way? Everyone in it editorializes, but since all
the speeches are given equal weight, we
don't know which ones we're intended to
discount. Ciello tells us, "I remembered why I
wanted to be a cop — to be a good guy rather
than a bad guy," and later, "I wanted absolu
tion," and still later, "I don't know what the
truth is anymore." We're also told by various
characters (whose faces we can no longer dis
tinguish by the end of the first hour),
"They're cops. In their hearts they all want to
admit their guilt," and"He (Ciello) was never
made to understand how inexorable the

forces against him were," and "For most cops
corruption creeps up, slowly and impercep
tibly — but to get back, they've got to do it in
one dangerous leap." Is that the existential
leap of faith to embrace Catholicism? Be
cause the world is corrupt and truth has been
obscured and each man has to discover his
true nature? What do Lumet and Allen think
they're talking about? Prince of the City is a
high-toned fiasco.

I didn't seeZoot Suit on stage, but I can eas
ily understand the West Coast popularity of
the first mainstream play to deal with the po
litical experience of Chicanos in this country.
Luis Valciez chose as his subject the treatment
of "zoot suiters" — youths from the barrios of
L.A. — by the police and thecourts in theear
ly '40s, when reports of street violence vied
with war news on the front pages of L.A.
newspapers, and his play is full of pachuco
slang and jokes (which the non-Chicanos in
the audience aren't likely to get). Zoot Suit
proved so successful at Los Angeles's Mark
Taper Forum that it travelled to Broadway,
where it was a resounding flop — and seeing
the movie Valdez has made of it, I'm afraid I
must side with New York.
The hero of the play — for it is a filmed play,
and except for some cheating (the old spin
ning newspaper trick from movies of the '30s,
a shot of a car superimposed on the water)
Valdez makes no bones about it, even provid
ing glimpses of the audience watching the ac
tors on the stage — is Henry Reyna (Daniel
Valdez), one of four young men unjustly
thrown in prison for murder until the com
bined efforts of two whites, a "people's law
yer" (Charles Aidman) and a C.1.0. organizer
(Tyne Daly), obtain a reversal of the verdict.
But the star is Edward James Olmos, a
moustachioed singer with a permanent sneer
who plays El Pachuco — a theatrical device
standing in for not only the protagonist's alter
ego but also the playwright's technique for
controlling the action. El Pachuco introduces
flashbacks, comments on the situation —
often in song — and even steps into the plot:
it is he who commits the crime for which Rey
na and his friends are sent up, a conceit that
sits very poorly with those of us who still insist
on dramatic consistency and logic.
To bring off a character from whom so
many threads of a play are spun would be dif
ficult even for a tremendously gifted writer,
and Valdez, judging from Zoot Suit, is really
rather second-rate. He puts lines like,
"You're a marijuana dreamer, floating in the
endless night of your unfulfilled fantasies" in
El Pachuco's mouth, and he makes him a par
ticularly unattractive representative of the
Chicano spirit — physically (Olmos looks like
he stepped out of a Sergio Leone western)
and ideologically. Valdez indicates that El
Pachuco is a mixed blessing for Reyna — his
best and his worst self — but though he drew
cheers from some of the people around me, I
found his brutality offensive. (I suspect that
women who see the picture will greet him —
and it — with less enthusiasm than the pre
dominantly male audience I saw it with.)
I don't mind watching a filmed play if it's a
play worth filming, but this one isn't. Despite
the ad campaign that proclaims it "an Ameri
can original," I thought I saw its antecedents
in another pretentious, pseudo-serious musi
cal play — West Side Story. The overheated
guys in their outlandish zoot suits — high
waisted pants and huge-angled sports jackets
that swing down their legs — spend a lot of
time frozen in Jerome Robbins poses (though
Patricia Birch's overkill choreography is
closer to Grease,) and their shrill consorts
always seem on the verge of bursting into a
chorus of "I like the shores of America." Rose
Portillo, playing Reyna's earnest, virginal girl
friend Delia, doubles as this show's Maria,
professing undying love for her Tony, and its
Doc, reciting homilies.
The cast of Zoot Suit is still playing to the
back of the house — especially Tyne Daly,
whose inspiration for her portrayal of Alice,
the woman from the C.1.0., must have been
Anne Meara in Fame. (Her taste in models —
like Valdez's — is questionable.) The most
embarrassing scenes are between Alice and
Reyna, who is initially suspicious of her in
terest in him and then translates it intosexual
terms. It's impossible to believe his change of
heart, because Alice is one of those creations
that cannot be conceived of as existing out
side a musical comedy plot; when Reyna
kisses her, he might be making love to Judy
Holliday in Bells Are Ringing. I have a great
deal of trouble taking anything in Zoot Suit
seriously — but maybe you shouldn't listen to
me. After all, Evita makes me giggle uncon
trollably.
