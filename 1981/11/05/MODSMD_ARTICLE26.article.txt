# Reggae reigns in Berkeley Greek
## 
### John Nordell 
Max Romeo, a veteran reggae vocalist,
once explained, "Reggae music is unique.
It's political, it's religious, and you can
dance to it." The religion associated with
reggae is Rastafari. Rastafarians believe
that the late king of Ethiopia, originally
called Ras Tafari, Haile Selassie I, is the re
turned Messiah. Rastas believe that the
power of Jah (Haile Selassie) will bring
them back to their homeland in Africa, and
they will find their redemption there in
Zion. Reggae political trends vary from de
nunciation of the corrupt system (Babylon)
to spreading the word of peace between
man and beast (a vegetarian lifestyle). The
Rasta colors, red, green, and gold, repre
sent their philosophy. Red is for the blood
that will be shed for freedom, green for the
land, and gold for the golden sunshine.
The First Annual Berkeley Reggae Sun
blast celebrated the meeting of these Ja
maican Rasta ideals with an American au
dience. The Sunblast is an offshoot of the
annual three-day festival held in Jamaica
called the Reggae Sunsplash, an interna
tionally-known festival of the finest in reg
gae music. Some Sunsplash performers ap
peared at the Sunblast, attracting a diverse
audience of reggae lovers.
Ras Kiddus and his band, the Root Con
nection, opened. Many of Kiddus's lyrics
deal with the Rastafarian religion. In one of
his songs, Kiddus implores, "Stand up firm
in Babylon if you want to go to Zion." Kid
dus did some fine stutter step dancing and
got the crowd on its feet with a version of
Bob Marley's "Lively Up Yourself."
Nineteen-year-old vocalist Hugh Mun

dell came on stage next, backed by the
Roots Connection Band. Nattily attired in
brand new fatigues, argyle socks, and a
leather cap bulging with his dreadlocks,
Mundell had a very cool stage manner. His
songs speak of revolution and freedom. In
one, "Let's All Unite," he calls for blacks
and whites to unite. In another, "Africa
Must Be Free By 1983," he broke his cool
stance to extend the word "free," shaking
his fist for emphasis. During his set, two
women dressed in the style of Jamaican
country women came on stage with
baskets of fruit balanced on their heads.
They shared the fruit with the crowd.
The Wailing Souls, a four-piece vocal
outfit, hit the stage next, backed by Joe
Higgs's band Unity. They wore matching
sweat suits, with red, green, and gold trim,
and head bands. They had never per
formed outside of Jamaica before, and
they unleashed their roots on the crowd.
They danced continually, skanking, and
singing in rich harmonies. Their show was
joyous and strong, as they concluded with
"Firehouse Rock": "We want to unite,
they call us ignorant."
A strong influence in the early stages of
the career of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and
the Wailing Souls, Joe Higgs sang political
ly-oriented songs. Ffe called on the crowd
to think of their brothers in South Africa
and sang out about "too much money for
pollution and space instead of the human
race." His band Unity provided fine
rhythms driven by the power of the young,
enthusiastic drummer. Displaying fine tal
ent, Higgs traded scat phrases with thesax
aphonist.

The final set featured The Waiters, along
with Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths,
two of the l-Threes, who did back-up vo
cals for Marley. They sang some of their
solo hits, which had feminist leanings. )udy
Mowatt dedicated "Slave Queen" to all
the women: "Slave Queen, remove the
shackles from your mind." Heavy-set and
graceful in flowing red, green, and gold
robes, Griffiths and Mowatt stepped to
gether singing "Stepping Out of Babylon."
Then the spotlight was on The Wailers
Band. They are one of the finest groups of
reggae musicians, lead by their rhythm
section, Aston "Family Man" Barrett and
his brother Carleton on drums.
Guitarist Junior Marvin proclaimed:
"It's an honor to sing Bob Marley's songs.
It would be very difficult to recreate
Marley's intensity." They set the positive
vibrations going, and gave the audience a
bit of Marley's spirit by singing a series of
old and new hits. 1 he whole audience was
moved hearing "Zion Train," and "We'll
Be Forever Loving Jah" (which was sung by
a special guest, premier reggae organist
Earl "Wire" Undo), and the inspirational
"One Drop" with the refrain, "they made
their world so hard, every day we got to
keep on fighting." The final song was "Ex
odus," which got the audience chanting
"set the captives free." With 14 musicians
on stage, and a Greek Theatre full of chant
ing people, the togetherness set ev
erybody free. The First Annual Berkeley
Reggae Sunblast was an unprecedented
gathering of 42 Jamaican musicians in
America. It was a great achievement.

and whites to unite. In another, "Africa
Must Be Free By 1983," he broke his cool
stance to extend the word "free," shaking
his fist for emphasis. During his set, two
women dressed in the style of Jamaican
country women came on stage with
baskets of fruit balanced on their heads.
They shared the fruit with the crowd.
The Wailing Souls, a four-piece vocal
outfit, hit the stage next, backed by Joe
Higgs's band Unity. They wore matching
sweat suits, with red, green, and gold trim,
and head bands. They had never per
formed outside of Jamaica before, and
they unleashed their roots on the crowd.
They danced continually, skanking, and
singing in rich harmonies. Their show was
joyous and strong, as they concluded with
"Firehouse Rock": "We want to unite,
they call us ignorant."
A strong influence in the early stages of
the career of Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and
the Wailing Souls, Joe Higgs sang political
ly-oriented songs. Ffe called on the crowd
to think of their brothers in South Africa
and sang out about "too much money for
pollution and space instead of the human
race." His band Unity provided fine
rhythms driven by the power of the young,
enthusiastic drummer. Displaying fine tal
ent, Higgs traded scat phrases with thesax
aphonist.

The final set featured The Waiters, along
with Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths,
two of the l-Threes, who did back-up vo
cals for Marley. They sang some of their
solo hits, which had feminist leanings. )udy
Mowatt dedicated "Slave Queen" to all
the women: "Slave Queen, remove the
shackles from your mind." Heavy-set and
graceful in flowing red, green, and gold
robes, Griffiths and Mowatt stepped to
gether singing "Stepping Out of Babylon."
Then the spotlight was on The Wailers
Band. They are one of the finest groups of
reggae musicians, lead by their rhythm
section, Aston "Family Man" Barrett and
his brother Carleton on drums.
Guitarist Junior Marvin proclaimed:
"It's an honor to sing Bob Marley's songs.
It would be very difficult to recreate
Marley's intensity." They set the positive
vibrations going, and gave the audience a
bit of Marley's spirit by singing a series of
old and new hits. 1 he whole audience was
moved hearing "Zion Train," and "We'll
Be Forever Loving Jah" (which was sung by
a special guest, premier reggae organist
Earl "Wire" Undo), and the inspirational
"One Drop" with the refrain, "they made
their world so hard, every day we got to
keep on fighting." The final song was "Ex
odus," which got the audience chanting
"set the captives free." With 14 musicians
on stage, and a Greek Theatre full of chant
ing people, the togetherness set ev
erybody free. The First Annual Berkeley
Reggae Sunblast was an unprecedented
gathering of 42 Jamaican musicians in
America. It was a great achievement.
Max Romeo, a veteran reggae vocalist,
once explained, "Reggae music is unique.
It's political, it's religious, and you can
dance to it." The religion associated with
reggae is Rastafari. Rastafarians believe
that the late king of Ethiopia, originally
called Ras Tafari, Haile Selassie I, is the re
turned Messiah. Rastas believe that the
power of Jah (Haile Selassie) will bring
them back to their homeland in Africa, and
they will find their redemption there in
Zion. Reggae political trends vary from de
nunciation of the corrupt system (Babylon)
to spreading the word of peace between
man and beast (a vegetarian lifestyle). The
Rasta colors, red, green, and gold, repre
sent their philosophy. Red is for the blood
that will be shed for freedom, green for the
land, and gold for the golden sunshine.
The First Annual Berkeley Reggae Sun
blast celebrated the meeting of these Ja
maican Rasta ideals with an American au
dience. The Sunblast is an offshoot of the
annual three-day festival held in Jamaica
called the Reggae Sunsplash, an interna
tionally-known festival of the finest in reg
gae music. Some Sunsplash performers ap
peared at the Sunblast, attracting a diverse
audience of reggae lovers.
Ras Kiddus and his band, the Root Con
nection, opened. Many of Kiddus's lyrics
deal with the Rastafarian religion. In one of
his songs, Kiddus implores, "Stand up firm
in Babylon if you want to go to Zion." Kid
dus did some fine stutter step dancing and
got the crowd on its feet with a version of
Bob Marley's "Lively Up Yourself."
Nineteen-year-old vocalist Hugh Mun

dell came on stage next, backed by the
Roots Connection Band. Nattily attired in
brand new fatigues, argyle socks, and a
leather cap bulging with his dreadlocks,
Mundell had a very cool stage manner. His
songs speak of revolution and freedom. In
one, "Let's All Unite," he calls for blacks
and whites to unite. In another, "Africa
Must Be Free By 1983," he broke his cool
