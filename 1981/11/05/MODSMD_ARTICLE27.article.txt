# Around the world in two hours with Firkusny: East meets West
## 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
Stamping his feet and rising from his seat
upon hitting a fortechord, Rudolf Firkusny
demonstrated to Sunday's audience at
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall that the
piano is not played with the fingers alone
and that an East European can play classics
of the Western European musical liter
ature with sensitivity and understanding.
The Czech-born Firkusny, widely ac
claimed as the foremost advocate and in
terpreter of the piano music of his own
country, presented a diverse program con
sisting mainly of works by Western Eu
ropean composers. The program began
with Franz Schubert's A minor Sonata,
D.845, a grand work only discovered in this
century. Like the sonatas of Beethoven,
this piece reaches to the full dynamic
range of the instrument, but unlike
Beethoven even in his later years, Schubert
experiments more with tonal and modal
technique than with temporal melodic var
iation.
The four movements, Moderato, An
dante, Scherzo, and Rondo, are extremely
diffuse, and besides their common key,
bear little resemblance to each other. The
Andante is a standard classical theme and
variations, and the Scherzo is a lively dance
drawing on themes in the German and in
the Slavic styles. This last may suggest part
of the piece's appeal to Firkusny.
The Rondo also jumps fromthe genre of
the Slavic dance to that of the Viennese
waltz, which modulation Firkusny carried
off with a sort of humorous emotionalism,
sometimes emphasizing, and sometimes
seeming to ignore the radical cultural
leaps. The piece was a marvelous opener,
as it demonstrated Firkusny's uncanny abil
ity to catch a phrase, to twist it just a bit
with his Czech understanding of rhythm,
and to send it in a form that only seems to
be the same as the interpretation of every
other pianist, but touches a totally new
sense in the mind of the listener.
Firkusny's second work further de

veloped the feeling that one was listening
to a different kind of performance, one
that made sense in its own way. Robert
Schumann created a fantasy world within
his head and wrote through three of its
characters in the composition of Die
Davidsbundler, Opus 6.
Firkusny delved into the innermost
private thoughts of those characters, iden
tified by Schumann as Florestan (not the
toothpaste ingredient), Eusebius, and Dr.
Raro. The work consists of eighteen short
pieces titled simply with the feeling they
are supposed to portray, varying from "In
ward" to "Impatiently" to "Tender and
singing." The work was the most eclectic
of the evening, drawing melodies and
styles from the Opera, the Court, the
Country, and the Dance Hall.
Performing this work, Firkusny obvious
ly felt that Schumann's own filtering proc
ess made most interpretation superfluous,
and one felt that one was hearing the cries
and laughter of the composer in the rapid
shifts of tempo and dynamics which
Firkusny played as a Medium for the ghost
of that genius.
The second half of the program began
with Claude Debussy's Estampes, an im
pressionist work in three parts created like
paintings or prints. The first, Pagodes,
draws, as the name sugests, on the pen
tatonic scale so characteristic of Oriental
music. It might have been titled A Javanese
in Paris, as it weaves a color study from the
two distinctive styles of Sgutheast Asia and
the impressionism of France.
At times, the two follow one another, at
times, they overlap, and at times they meld
into a beautiful blue-green river of sound,
flowing, rolling, and crashing against the
back wall of the hall. Firkusny became the
painter, painting a pagoda by the Loire.
The second part, La soiree dans Grenade
(subtitled Mouvement de Habanera,) very
closely resembles Ravel's earlier, and
much more popular, Rapsodie espagnole.
Debussy constructs a totally fanciful work
that suggests a trip through Spain stopping

at tavernas, at bull-fights, beginning and
ending with the simply joyful melodies of
the folklore of the peasantry from the sur
rounding countryside.
In the final section, Debussy looks at
France through the eyes of a foreigner,
seeing all the romance and the beauty that
greets the visitor on his first trip to that ex
otic place. The movement is dramatic,
sounding more like works by Gabriel
Faure, and Firkusny, the was in a
perfect postion to present the work as it
was intended, an outsider's view. He
proved that he could feel the exotic, slow
moving rhythms of Paris as well as he feels
the Slavic dances of Prague.
The final scheduled work on the pro
gram was the Fantasy and Toccata by
Bohuslav Martinu, a much-neglected
Czech composer who escaped to this
country just ahead of the German invasion
of Paris in 1940. He wrote this work for
Firkusny, who first performed it in 1943.
The Fantsy is a study in contrast in tempo,
as Martinu explores the influence of the
German classicists on such Czech com
posers as Dvorak, Srnetana, and Janacek.
Firkusny played this piece as if he lived it,
driving through the fierce Toccata with its
Gershwin-like jazzy statements and
Moussorgsky-like force like a bobsled on a
track. The audience realized that this was
his home, this was his music, and this was
his piece. He manipulated one's emotions
like a lover, first hot, then cold, and hurled
the dissonance and the concordance into
the hall with no concern but for the music.
After two encores, I felt as though I had
been flown around the world in two hours,
and I applauded even more vigorously the
smiling man with gray hair who had led me
on that trip.
He is a startling performer, and this con
cert proved that his distinctive style is just
as appropriate for the music of the West as
is thdt of Rubinstein, Schnabel, or Serkin,
and that his interpretation of the Slavic idi
om may just be the best there is. Bravo.
