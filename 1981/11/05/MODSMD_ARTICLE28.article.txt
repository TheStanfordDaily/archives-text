# Cleve's band still getting better

The all-Russian program fea
tured by the San Jose Sym
phony began with the prelude
to Mussorgsky's opera
Khovantchina, a pretty little
piece which, while featuring
fine solo performances from
the french horn and woodwind
principals, was not played well
by the orchestra as a whole,
and seemed to end just as it was
getting under way.
The next selection, Pro
kofiev's Violin Concerto No. 2
in G minor, featured the young
Russian violinist Boris Belkin.
Belkin has discovered a clever
solution to the problem of au
diences that don't quiet down
soon enough to suit the
soloist's liking. That's right,
Belkin began to play (the con
certo begins with a violin solo)
without allowing the audience
to settle down. Most un
fortunate.
Belkin's tone was well-suited
to the performance of Pro
kofiev, capturing the often me
chanically inhuman mood of
the music, then yielding to a
much fuller tone to express the
release of emotion. Yet the first
movement was not character
ized by a great deal of unity
among the strings, and the celli
were often clumsily loud.
There were also several missed
opportunities to heighten
dynamic climaxes. Indeed,

throughout the first two pieces
the orchestra seemed to be se
verely limiting its dynamic
range.
In between the first and sec
ond movements, a sad suspi
cion was confirmed. Belkin's
violin was flat â€” a problem
which was corrected in a
lengthy and most agonizing
manner.
Maestro George Cleve man
aged totighten upthestringsin
the second movement, which,
while better than the first, was
still not very inspiring.
The third movement was the
most rhythmically interesting,
contrasting well with the sec
ond by placing the soloist and
orchestra at odds with one an
other in a contest that finally
managed to inspire both of
them. The audience was drawn
into the music, teased with
melodic material that is not de
veloped until midway into the
movement, after which it de
velops to a dramatic, if abrupt,
climax. But here too the au
dience's powers of attention
were tested by Belkin, whose
frequent smug glances at the
audience seemed to say, "You
are liking this, da?"
Unfortunately, the first half
of the program didn't motivate
some of the audience to return
for Shostakovich's Tenth Sym
phony. Now the audience


George Cleve
found out what the orchestra and conductor
had apparently been saving themselves for.
This is a huge work, both in duration and
scope, and brought out the best in the or
chestra and Cleve.
The first movement began with an eerie
figure in the celli and basses, and grew in in
tensity as more and more of the orchestra
was brought in, and harmonic tensions are
created and released. The true quality of the
orchestra that Cleve has been developing for
so long finally became apparent as the music
swelled from subdued to intense, then re
turning to restrained and quiet, each transi
tion being handled beautifully by the or
chestra. The forte passages were presented
in excellent contrast to the quieter mo
ments, and were heightened by effective use
of percussion, including a gong, which em
phasized the music's intensity while still
sounding like an integrated part of the or
chestra.
The quiet ending of the first movement

was shattered by the fury and blistering pace
of the second, which, according to
Shostakovich, is a rough musical portrait of
Stalin. The whole orchestra played the short,
four-minute movement brilliantly, even the
brass, which has greatly improved in the last
few years.
The truly shocking effect of the second
movement was nicely contrasted by the third
movement, an alegretto which began quiet
ly and built nicely, reasserting the individ
ualistic emotional character of the first
movement. The unusual string dynamics
here were most interesting.
The fourth movement developed slowly, a
feeling of uncertainty and sadness suddenly
being forced out, giving way to sweeping ex
pressions of anger and rage which were in
turn replaced by a more confident and self
satisfied feeling. This assertive mood built to
a brilliant and triumphant climax, which was
met by enthusiastic applause from the now
appreciative audience.
