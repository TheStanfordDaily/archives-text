# Cleve's band still getting better

The all-Russian program fea
tured by the San Jose Sym
phony began with the prelude
to Mussorgsky's opera
Khovantchina, a pretty little
piece which, while featuring
fine solo performances from
the french horn and woodwind
principals, was not played well
by the orchestra as a whole,
and seemed to end just as it was
getting under way.
The next selection, Pro
kofiev's Violin Concerto No. 2
in G minor, featured the young
Russian violinist Boris Belkin.
Belkin has discovered a clever
solution to the problem of au
diences that don't quiet down
soon enough to suit the
soloist's liking. That's right,
Belkin began to play (the con
certo begins with a violin solo)
without allowing the audience
to settle down. Most un
fortunate.
Belkin's tone was well-suited
to the performance of Pro
kofiev, capturing the often me
chanically inhuman mood of
the music, then yielding to a
much fuller tone to express the
release of emotion. Yet the first
movement was not character
ized by a great deal of unity
among the strings, and the celli
were often clumsily loud.
There were also several missed
opportunities to heighten
dynamic climaxes. Indeed,

throughout the first two pieces
the orchestra seemed to be se
verely limiting its dynamic
range.
In between the first and sec
ond movements, a sad suspi
cion was confirmed. Belkin's
violin was flat â€” a problem
which was corrected in a
lengthy and most agonizing
manner.
Maestro George Cleve man
aged totighten upthestringsin
the second movement, which,
while better than the first, was
still not very inspiring.
The third movement was the
most rhythmically interesting,
contrasting well with the sec
ond by placing the soloist and
orchestra at odds with one an
other in a contest that finally
managed to inspire both of
them. The audience was drawn
into the music, teased with
melodic material that is not de
veloped until midway into the
movement, after which it de
velops to a dramatic, if abrupt,
climax. But here too the au
dience's powers of attention
were tested by Belkin, whose
frequent smug glances at the
audience seemed to say, "You
are liking this, da?"
Unfortunately, the first half
of the program didn't motivate
some of the audience to return
for Shostakovich's Tenth Sym
phony. Now the audience
