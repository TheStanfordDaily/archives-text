# Reeves brings British touch to Drama Dept.
## 
### 
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to
