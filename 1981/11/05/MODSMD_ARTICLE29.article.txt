# Reeves brings British touch to Drama Dept.
## 
### 
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to


Geoffrey Reeves Dlil,/Michde ' Oo, " ite


Daily/Michael Gonzales
bring it down from 1600 to 1100 seats. It is
beautiful, the front of house is beautiful, the
seats are beautiful, the dressing rooms are
the best in the country. . .Now, everyone
wants to play Nottingham because it's such
a good date, and because you can fill an
1100-seater. So you've got the existence
started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some
operetta, some variety, the National Theatre
and the Royal Shakespeare Company on
tour, some potboilers with television stars.
They will be able to see a full range. Royal
Shakespeare, for the last few years, has been
going to Newcastle for six weeks every year,
they take the entire company and they take
four or five mainstage shows, four or five
small shows, and they all live up there for six
weeks, and they're absolutely packed out.
And people know now that once a year,
they're going to go have a feast, a festi
val.
Now I think that's a .good thing, because I
think what you've got to get theater away
from is this "tonight at 8:00," the commodity
feeling, that it's there. Nicholas Nickleby had
an enormous influence, and thp main reason
is because it's out of the ordinary, special.
People made enormous efforts — they
didn't have to make so much of an effort on
the money, it didn't cost $100 to see in Lon
don — but they did have to get out of work,
and know that they were in the theater for
BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something
special, in order to compete with the fact
that we are all now programmed to be able
to pick up things when we want them in
video cassettes.. . >.
Daily: You obviously think there's some
thing better about the experience of seeing a
play in the live theater. . .
Reeves: No I don't. I think it's different. I
don't personally want to see television plays
on the stage. I don't actually hold any brief
for realism, or the followers of naturalism, at'
all. My interests in the theater are for big
epics, Brecht, Arden, Shakespeare, plays
which subconciously say to the audience all
the time, "these are actors on a stage."
You're not eavesdropping, I don't like fourth
wall stuff at all. And I like musicals, big musi
cals. These are things I find don't go well at
home; they go well in the cinema, in a cer
tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
other hand, there are some films which are
almost square — there's a film by Goretta
called La Deritelliere, The Lacemaker, about
a girl gone mad. Beautiful film, now my
agent has a tape of that and we watch it every
three months on a television set. I saw it first
in the cinema, and I find I have the same re
sponse to it, watching it in a sitting room.
Reeves was asked whether he would like
to work in the cinema. He replied that the
working conditions would not suit him,
since he was used to working with actors
over a period of time and being able to make

changes at the last minute. . .
Which I suppose is a way of saying that I am
very actor-orientated, that that is what has
kept me in the theater for 15 years, that I en
joyed working with actors. Unless you're re
ally interested in working with actors, I don't
think you should be a director, I don't think
you should be in there. I think you're there
to get the smell of watching these curious
creatures — actors are very strange people
— actually create things out of themselves.
And what's good about it is watching it hap
pen. ..
I like the cinema, I spend more time in the
cinema than I do in the theater. I find the
cinema, the American cinema, very good. I
don't go to the theater very much because I
find it boring. I've had so many boring eve
nings in the theater, I have to be really
twisted. Someone must come in and say,
"Listen, it's really fantastic," and I have to
trust them and know that they might really
be reporting accurately, for me to go to the
theater now. I don't get bored in the cinema.
I don't suppose I see very many bad films,
there are so many good ones.
Daily: Have you been to any plays in this
area?
Reeves: Yes, I saw the first act of the Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre's production of
Richard 11. That's all I've seen since I've been
here.
Daily: And you didn't like that.
Reeves: It was vintage. Vintage. Vintage
Old Vic, 1950. It was — I mean, if I talk about
it, you won't be able to print it, but it really
was just appalling.
Daily: How do you go about teaching
directing?
Reeves: You can't.
Daily: What do you do in your directing
class?
Reeves: I have six students, and they are at

the moment all preparing to do their own
shows. That's all. No one taught me direct
ing; you cannot learn something which you
can only find out. It is like swimming, you
can do it on the table but it is different when
you're in the water. You have to go in at the
deep end, you have to, at some stage, sit
there in front of actors, with a script, and say,
"Right fellows, let's get on with it." You can
spend months, years, watching somebody
else do it, and it doesn't help. And you can
make it work, not having watched anyone
else do it. It has to come from you, it has to
come from relationships with the people
you're working with. . .
Now, getting people working is a human
thing. It helps to have ideas in your head, it
does help to be able to read intelligently, to
think, etc., but that's not all that it is about,
and the only way you find out is doing it. So
these six graduates were told that there
wouldn't be any formal classes in the after
noon with me directing and them watching,
but that they can get on with it. So I spent the
last three weeks reading all the plays they
want to do, and all I've done is suggest that
they might get a better performance out of
this play than out of that play, because this
play has got two girls age 22 in it, which we've
got here in abundance and they're very
good, and this play's got four men of 44 and
we haven't got any of those, so it's not going
to be so good. I mean really practical sugges
tions about how you can get the best per
formances. They're not coming to me saying,
"Well, I'm going to do this play by Sartre, be
cause I've always wanted to do this play by
Sartre, and that's what I'm going to do," wil
ly-nilly; performances are about actually
working with people who have the capabili
ty to create, do something, at this time.
I've been steering them into the fact that
the auditions for The Recruiting Officer

were overwhelming in producing a number
of extremely good girls, and slightly less in
producing men, particularly older ones. So
they're now engaged in doing their plays,
and I shall appear at rehearsals from time to
time,
Daily: Did you choose The Recruiting Of
ficer yourself?
Reeves: I was offered She Stoops to Con
quer, which I said is a play without balls and I
don't want to do it, because the 18th century
emasculated the theater, it got more and
more bourgeois. So in the Restoration peri
od you had plays in which things happened
on stage; at the beginning of the 18th cen
tury, you had plays in which things were hap
pening offstage but were still talked about;
and by the end of the 18th century, nothing
happens at all, onstage or off. She Stoops to
Conquer belongs to the latter. I gave them a
list of six or seven plays, of which The Re
cruiting Officer was one, and they chose
that.
Daily: Are you doing it "straight"?
Reeves: Oh, absolutely straight!
Daily: Do you find that the student actors
are able to put themselves into that. ..
Reeves: Very well, very well. I'm much
happier at the moment facing student actors
in The Recruiting Officer at Stanford that I
would be with an equivalent group of actors
at Nottingham, professional actors in Eng
land, because I'd still have to be explaining
to some of these actors in Nottingham what
the text meant. The advantage here is that
with a play that is not written in grunt/groan
and modern English, they still understand
the text. And it's not an easy text, maybe it's
not quite as difficult as Shakespeare, but it's
not everyday speech and the speech
rhythms are difficult and it takes a lot of work
saying it. The problem with the English actor
is actually understanding that.

started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some
operetta, some variety, the National Theatre
and the Royal Shakespeare Company on
tour, some potboilers with television stars.
They will be able to see a full range. Royal
Shakespeare, for the last few years, has been
going to Newcastle for six weeks every year,
they take the entire company and they take
four or five mainstage shows, four or five
small shows, and they all live up there for six
weeks, and they're absolutely packed out.
And people know now that once a year,
they're going to go have a feast, a festi
val.
Now I think that's a .good thing, because I
think what you've got to get theater away
from is this "tonight at 8:00," the commodity
feeling, that it's there. Nicholas Nickleby had
an enormous influence, and thp main reason
is because it's out of the ordinary, special.
People made enormous efforts — they
didn't have to make so much of an effort on
the money, it didn't cost $100 to see in Lon
don — but they did have to get out of work,
and know that they were in the theater for
BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something
special, in order to compete with the fact
that we are all now programmed to be able
to pick up things when we want them in
video cassettes.. . >.
Daily: You obviously think there's some
thing better about the experience of seeing a
play in the live theater. . .
Reeves: No I don't. I think it's different. I
don't personally want to see television plays
on the stage. I don't actually hold any brief
for realism, or the followers of naturalism, at'
all. My interests in the theater are for big
epics, Brecht, Arden, Shakespeare, plays
which subconciously say to the audience all
the time, "these are actors on a stage."
You're not eavesdropping, I don't like fourth
wall stuff at all. And I like musicals, big musi
cals. These are things I find don't go well at
home; they go well in the cinema, in a cer
tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
other hand, there are some films which are
almost square — there's a film by Goretta
called La Deritelliere, The Lacemaker, about
a girl gone mad. Beautiful film, now my
agent has a tape of that and we watch it every
three months on a television set. I saw it first
in the cinema, and I find I have the same re
sponse to it, watching it in a sitting room.
Reeves was asked whether he would like
to work in the cinema. He replied that the
working conditions would not suit him,
since he was used to working with actors
over a period of time and being able to make

changes at the last minute. . .
Which I suppose is a way of saying that I am
very actor-orientated, that that is what has
kept me in the theater for 15 years, that I en
joyed working with actors. Unless you're re
ally interested in working with actors, I don't
think you should be a director, I don't think
you should be in there. I think you're there
to get the smell of watching these curious
creatures — actors are very strange people
— actually create things out of themselves.
And what's good about it is watching it hap
pen. ..
I like the cinema, I spend more time in the
cinema than I do in the theater. I find the
cinema, the American cinema, very good. I
don't go to the theater very much because I
find it boring. I've had so many boring eve
nings in the theater, I have to be really
twisted. Someone must come in and say,
"Listen, it's really fantastic," and I have to
trust them and know that they might really
be reporting accurately, for me to go to the
theater now. I don't get bored in the cinema.
I don't suppose I see very many bad films,
there are so many good ones.
Daily: Have you been to any plays in this
area?
Reeves: Yes, I saw the first act of the Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre's production of
Richard 11. That's all I've seen since I've been
here.
Daily: And you didn't like that.
Reeves: It was vintage. Vintage. Vintage
Old Vic, 1950. It was — I mean, if I talk about
it, you won't be able to print it, but it really
was just appalling.
Daily: How do you go about teaching
directing?
Reeves: You can't.
Daily: What do you do in your directing
class?
Reeves: I have six students, and they are at

the moment all preparing to do their own
shows. That's all. No one taught me direct
ing; you cannot learn something which you
can only find out. It is like swimming, you
can do it on the table but it is different when
you're in the water. You have to go in at the
deep end, you have to, at some stage, sit
there in front of actors, with a script, and say,
"Right fellows, let's get on with it." You can
spend months, years, watching somebody
else do it, and it doesn't help. And you can
make it work, not having watched anyone
else do it. It has to come from you, it has to
come from relationships with the people
you're working with. . .
Now, getting people working is a human
thing. It helps to have ideas in your head, it
does help to be able to read intelligently, to
think, etc., but that's not all that it is about,
and the only way you find out is doing it. So
these six graduates were told that there
wouldn't be any formal classes in the after
noon with me directing and them watching,
but that they can get on with it. So I spent the
last three weeks reading all the plays they
want to do, and all I've done is suggest that
they might get a better performance out of
this play than out of that play, because this
play has got two girls age 22 in it, which we've
got here in abundance and they're very
good, and this play's got four men of 44 and
we haven't got any of those, so it's not going
to be so good. I mean really practical sugges
tions about how you can get the best per
formances. They're not coming to me saying,
"Well, I'm going to do this play by Sartre, be
cause I've always wanted to do this play by
Sartre, and that's what I'm going to do," wil
ly-nilly; performances are about actually
working with people who have the capabili
ty to create, do something, at this time.
I've been steering them into the fact that
the auditions for The Recruiting Officer

were overwhelming in producing a number
of extremely good girls, and slightly less in
producing men, particularly older ones. So
they're now engaged in doing their plays,
and I shall appear at rehearsals from time to
time,
Daily: Did you choose The Recruiting Of
ficer yourself?
Reeves: I was offered She Stoops to Con
quer, which I said is a play without balls and I
don't want to do it, because the 18th century
emasculated the theater, it got more and
more bourgeois. So in the Restoration peri
od you had plays in which things happened
on stage; at the beginning of the 18th cen
tury, you had plays in which things were hap
pening offstage but were still talked about;
and by the end of the 18th century, nothing
happens at all, onstage or off. She Stoops to
Conquer belongs to the latter. I gave them a
list of six or seven plays, of which The Re
cruiting Officer was one, and they chose
that.
Daily: Are you doing it "straight"?
Reeves: Oh, absolutely straight!
Daily: Do you find that the student actors
are able to put themselves into that. ..
Reeves: Very well, very well. I'm much
happier at the moment facing student actors
in The Recruiting Officer at Stanford that I
would be with an equivalent group of actors
at Nottingham, professional actors in Eng
land, because I'd still have to be explaining
to some of these actors in Nottingham what
the text meant. The advantage here is that
with a play that is not written in grunt/groan
and modern English, they still understand
the text. And it's not an easy text, maybe it's
not quite as difficult as Shakespeare, but it's
not everyday speech and the speech
rhythms are difficult and it takes a lot of work
saying it. The problem with the English actor
is actually understanding that.
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to


Geoffrey Reeves Dlil,/Michde ' Oo, " ite


Daily/Michael Gonzales
bring it down from 1600 to 1100 seats. It is
beautiful, the front of house is beautiful, the
seats are beautiful, the dressing rooms are
the best in the country. . .Now, everyone
wants to play Nottingham because it's such
a good date, and because you can fill an
1100-seater. So you've got the existence
started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some

signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to


Geoffrey Reeves Dlil,/Michde ' Oo, " ite


Daily/Michael Gonzales
bring it down from 1600 to 1100 seats. It is
beautiful, the front of house is beautiful, the
seats are beautiful, the dressing rooms are
the best in the country. . .Now, everyone
wants to play Nottingham because it's such
a good date, and because you can fill an
1100-seater. So you've got the existence
started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some
operetta, some variety, the National Theatre
and the Royal Shakespeare Company on
tour, some potboilers with television stars.
They will be able to see a full range. Royal
Shakespeare, for the last few years, has been
going to Newcastle for six weeks every year,
they take the entire company and they take
four or five mainstage shows, four or five
small shows, and they all live up there for six
weeks, and they're absolutely packed out.
And people know now that once a year,
they're going to go have a feast, a festi
val.
Now I think that's a .good thing, because I
think what you've got to get theater away
from is this "tonight at 8:00," the commodity
feeling, that it's there. Nicholas Nickleby had
an enormous influence, and thp main reason
is because it's out of the ordinary, special.
People made enormous efforts — they
didn't have to make so much of an effort on
the money, it didn't cost $100 to see in Lon
don — but they did have to get out of work,
and know that they were in the theater for
BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something
special, in order to compete with the fact
that we are all now programmed to be able
to pick up things when we want them in
video cassettes.. . >.
Daily: You obviously think there's some
thing better about the experience of seeing a
play in the live theater. . .
Reeves: No I don't. I think it's different. I
don't personally want to see television plays
on the stage. I don't actually hold any brief
for realism, or the followers of naturalism, at'
all. My interests in the theater are for big
epics, Brecht, Arden, Shakespeare, plays
which subconciously say to the audience all
the time, "these are actors on a stage."
You're not eavesdropping, I don't like fourth
wall stuff at all. And I like musicals, big musi
cals. These are things I find don't go well at
home; they go well in the cinema, in a cer
tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
other hand, there are some films which are
almost square — there's a film by Goretta
called La Deritelliere, The Lacemaker, about
a girl gone mad. Beautiful film, now my
agent has a tape of that and we watch it every
three months on a television set. I saw it first
in the cinema, and I find I have the same re
sponse to it, watching it in a sitting room.
Reeves was asked whether he would like
to work in the cinema. He replied that the
working conditions would not suit him,
since he was used to working with actors
over a period of time and being able to make

changes at the last minute. . .
Which I suppose is a way of saying that I am
very actor-orientated, that that is what has
kept me in the theater for 15 years, that I en
joyed working with actors. Unless you're re
ally interested in working with actors, I don't
think you should be a director, I don't think
you should be in there. I think you're there
to get the smell of watching these curious
creatures — actors are very strange people
— actually create things out of themselves.
And what's good about it is watching it hap
pen. ..
I like the cinema, I spend more time in the
cinema than I do in the theater. I find the
cinema, the American cinema, very good. I
don't go to the theater very much because I
find it boring. I've had so many boring eve
nings in the theater, I have to be really
twisted. Someone must come in and say,
"Listen, it's really fantastic," and I have to
trust them and know that they might really
be reporting accurately, for me to go to the
theater now. I don't get bored in the cinema.
I don't suppose I see very many bad films,
there are so many good ones.
Daily: Have you been to any plays in this
area?
Reeves: Yes, I saw the first act of the Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre's production of
Richard 11. That's all I've seen since I've been
here.
Daily: And you didn't like that.
Reeves: It was vintage. Vintage. Vintage
Old Vic, 1950. It was — I mean, if I talk about
it, you won't be able to print it, but it really
was just appalling.
Daily: How do you go about teaching
directing?
Reeves: You can't.
Daily: What do you do in your directing
class?
Reeves: I have six students, and they are at

the moment all preparing to do their own
shows. That's all. No one taught me direct
ing; you cannot learn something which you
can only find out. It is like swimming, you
can do it on the table but it is different when
you're in the water. You have to go in at the
deep end, you have to, at some stage, sit
there in front of actors, with a script, and say,
"Right fellows, let's get on with it." You can
spend months, years, watching somebody
else do it, and it doesn't help. And you can
make it work, not having watched anyone
else do it. It has to come from you, it has to
come from relationships with the people
you're working with. . .
Now, getting people working is a human
thing. It helps to have ideas in your head, it
does help to be able to read intelligently, to
think, etc., but that's not all that it is about,
and the only way you find out is doing it. So
these six graduates were told that there
wouldn't be any formal classes in the after
noon with me directing and them watching,
but that they can get on with it. So I spent the
last three weeks reading all the plays they
want to do, and all I've done is suggest that
they might get a better performance out of
this play than out of that play, because this
play has got two girls age 22 in it, which we've
got here in abundance and they're very
good, and this play's got four men of 44 and
we haven't got any of those, so it's not going
to be so good. I mean really practical sugges
tions about how you can get the best per
formances. They're not coming to me saying,
"Well, I'm going to do this play by Sartre, be
cause I've always wanted to do this play by
Sartre, and that's what I'm going to do," wil
ly-nilly; performances are about actually
working with people who have the capabili
ty to create, do something, at this time.
I've been steering them into the fact that
the auditions for The Recruiting Officer

were overwhelming in producing a number
of extremely good girls, and slightly less in
producing men, particularly older ones. So
they're now engaged in doing their plays,
and I shall appear at rehearsals from time to
time,
Daily: Did you choose The Recruiting Of
ficer yourself?
Reeves: I was offered She Stoops to Con
quer, which I said is a play without balls and I
don't want to do it, because the 18th century
emasculated the theater, it got more and
more bourgeois. So in the Restoration peri
od you had plays in which things happened
on stage; at the beginning of the 18th cen
tury, you had plays in which things were hap
pening offstage but were still talked about;
and by the end of the 18th century, nothing
happens at all, onstage or off. She Stoops to
Conquer belongs to the latter. I gave them a
list of six or seven plays, of which The Re
cruiting Officer was one, and they chose
that.
Daily: Are you doing it "straight"?
Reeves: Oh, absolutely straight!
Daily: Do you find that the student actors
are able to put themselves into that. ..
Reeves: Very well, very well. I'm much
happier at the moment facing student actors
in The Recruiting Officer at Stanford that I
would be with an equivalent group of actors
at Nottingham, professional actors in Eng
land, because I'd still have to be explaining
to some of these actors in Nottingham what
the text meant. The advantage here is that
with a play that is not written in grunt/groan
and modern English, they still understand
the text. And it's not an easy text, maybe it's
not quite as difficult as Shakespeare, but it's
not everyday speech and the speech
rhythms are difficult and it takes a lot of work
saying it. The problem with the English actor
is actually understanding that.
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of

BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something
special, in order to compete with the fact
that we are all now programmed to be able
to pick up things when we want them in
video cassettes.. . >.
Daily: You obviously think there's some
thing better about the experience of seeing a
play in the live theater. . .
Reeves: No I don't. I think it's different. I
don't personally want to see television plays
on the stage. I don't actually hold any brief
for realism, or the followers of naturalism, at'
all. My interests in the theater are for big
epics, Brecht, Arden, Shakespeare, plays
which subconciously say to the audience all
the time, "these are actors on a stage."
You're not eavesdropping, I don't like fourth
wall stuff at all. And I like musicals, big musi
cals. These are things I find don't go well at
home; they go well in the cinema, in a cer
tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
other hand, there are some films which are
almost square — there's a film by Goretta
called La Deritelliere, The Lacemaker, about
a girl gone mad. Beautiful film, now my
agent has a tape of that and we watch it every
three months on a television set. I saw it first
in the cinema, and I find I have the same re
sponse to it, watching it in a sitting room.
Reeves was asked whether he would like
to work in the cinema. He replied that the
working conditions would not suit him,
since he was used to working with actors
over a period of time and being able to make

changes at the last minute. . .
Which I suppose is a way of saying that I am
very actor-orientated, that that is what has
kept me in the theater for 15 years, that I en
joyed working with actors. Unless you're re
ally interested in working with actors, I don't
think you should be a director, I don't think
you should be in there. I think you're there
to get the smell of watching these curious
creatures — actors are very strange people
— actually create things out of themselves.
And what's good about it is watching it hap
pen. ..
I like the cinema, I spend more time in the
cinema than I do in the theater. I find the
cinema, the American cinema, very good. I
don't go to the theater very much because I
find it boring. I've had so many boring eve
nings in the theater, I have to be really
twisted. Someone must come in and say,
"Listen, it's really fantastic," and I have to
trust them and know that they might really
be reporting accurately, for me to go to the
theater now. I don't get bored in the cinema.
I don't suppose I see very many bad films,
there are so many good ones.
Daily: Have you been to any plays in this
area?
Reeves: Yes, I saw the first act of the Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre's production of
Richard 11. That's all I've seen since I've been
here.
Daily: And you didn't like that.
Reeves: It was vintage. Vintage. Vintage
Old Vic, 1950. It was — I mean, if I talk about
it, you won't be able to print it, but it really
was just appalling.
Daily: How do you go about teaching
directing?
Reeves: You can't.
Daily: What do you do in your directing
class?
Reeves: I have six students, and they are at

the moment all preparing to do their own
shows. That's all. No one taught me direct
ing; you cannot learn something which you
can only find out. It is like swimming, you
can do it on the table but it is different when
you're in the water. You have to go in at the
deep end, you have to, at some stage, sit
there in front of actors, with a script, and say,
"Right fellows, let's get on with it." You can
spend months, years, watching somebody
else do it, and it doesn't help. And you can
make it work, not having watched anyone
else do it. It has to come from you, it has to
come from relationships with the people
you're working with. . .
Now, getting people working is a human
thing. It helps to have ideas in your head, it
does help to be able to read intelligently, to
think, etc., but that's not all that it is about,
and the only way you find out is doing it. So
these six graduates were told that there
wouldn't be any formal classes in the after
noon with me directing and them watching,
but that they can get on with it. So I spent the
last three weeks reading all the plays they
want to do, and all I've done is suggest that
they might get a better performance out of
this play than out of that play, because this
play has got two girls age 22 in it, which we've
got here in abundance and they're very
good, and this play's got four men of 44 and
we haven't got any of those, so it's not going
to be so good. I mean really practical sugges
tions about how you can get the best per
formances. They're not coming to me saying,
"Well, I'm going to do this play by Sartre, be
cause I've always wanted to do this play by
Sartre, and that's what I'm going to do," wil
ly-nilly; performances are about actually
working with people who have the capabili
ty to create, do something, at this time.
I've been steering them into the fact that
the auditions for The Recruiting Officer

were overwhelming in producing a number
of extremely good girls, and slightly less in
producing men, particularly older ones. So
they're now engaged in doing their plays,
and I shall appear at rehearsals from time to
time,
Daily: Did you choose The Recruiting Of
ficer yourself?
Reeves: I was offered She Stoops to Con
quer, which I said is a play without balls and I
don't want to do it, because the 18th century
emasculated the theater, it got more and
more bourgeois. So in the Restoration peri
od you had plays in which things happened
on stage; at the beginning of the 18th cen
tury, you had plays in which things were hap
pening offstage but were still talked about;
and by the end of the 18th century, nothing
happens at all, onstage or off. She Stoops to
Conquer belongs to the latter. I gave them a
list of six or seven plays, of which The Re
cruiting Officer was one, and they chose
that.
Daily: Are you doing it "straight"?
Reeves: Oh, absolutely straight!
Daily: Do you find that the student actors
are able to put themselves into that. ..
Reeves: Very well, very well. I'm much
happier at the moment facing student actors
in The Recruiting Officer at Stanford that I
would be with an equivalent group of actors
at Nottingham, professional actors in Eng
land, because I'd still have to be explaining
to some of these actors in Nottingham what
the text meant. The advantage here is that
with a play that is not written in grunt/groan
and modern English, they still understand
the text. And it's not an easy text, maybe it's
not quite as difficult as Shakespeare, but it's
not everyday speech and the speech
rhythms are difficult and it takes a lot of work
saying it. The problem with the English actor
is actually understanding that.
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to


Geoffrey Reeves Dlil,/Michde ' Oo, " ite


Daily/Michael Gonzales
bring it down from 1600 to 1100 seats. It is
beautiful, the front of house is beautiful, the
seats are beautiful, the dressing rooms are
the best in the country. . .Now, everyone
wants to play Nottingham because it's such
a good date, and because you can fill an
1100-seater. So you've got the existence
started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some
operetta, some variety, the National Theatre
and the Royal Shakespeare Company on
tour, some potboilers with television stars.
They will be able to see a full range. Royal
Shakespeare, for the last few years, has been
going to Newcastle for six weeks every year,
they take the entire company and they take
four or five mainstage shows, four or five
small shows, and they all live up there for six
weeks, and they're absolutely packed out.
And people know now that once a year,
they're going to go have a feast, a festi
val.
Now I think that's a .good thing, because I
think what you've got to get theater away
from is this "tonight at 8:00," the commodity
feeling, that it's there. Nicholas Nickleby had
an enormous influence, and thp main reason
is because it's out of the ordinary, special.
People made enormous efforts — they
didn't have to make so much of an effort on
the money, it didn't cost $100 to see in Lon
don — but they did have to get out of work,
and know that they were in the theater for
BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to


Geoffrey Reeves Dlil,/Michde ' Oo, " ite


Daily/Michael Gonzales
bring it down from 1600 to 1100 seats. It is
beautiful, the front of house is beautiful, the
seats are beautiful, the dressing rooms are
the best in the country. . .Now, everyone
wants to play Nottingham because it's such
a good date, and because you can fill an
1100-seater. So you've got the existence
started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some
operetta, some variety, the National Theatre
and the Royal Shakespeare Company on
tour, some potboilers with television stars.
They will be able to see a full range. Royal
Shakespeare, for the last few years, has been
going to Newcastle for six weeks every year,
they take the entire company and they take
four or five mainstage shows, four or five
small shows, and they all live up there for six
weeks, and they're absolutely packed out.
And people know now that once a year,
they're going to go have a feast, a festi
val.
Now I think that's a .good thing, because I
think what you've got to get theater away
from is this "tonight at 8:00," the commodity
feeling, that it's there. Nicholas Nickleby had
an enormous influence, and thp main reason
is because it's out of the ordinary, special.
People made enormous efforts — they
didn't have to make so much of an effort on
the money, it didn't cost $100 to see in Lon
don — but they did have to get out of work,
and know that they were in the theater for
BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something
special, in order to compete with the fact
that we are all now programmed to be able
to pick up things when we want them in
video cassettes.. . >.
Daily: You obviously think there's some
thing better about the experience of seeing a
play in the live theater. . .
Reeves: No I don't. I think it's different. I
don't personally want to see television plays
on the stage. I don't actually hold any brief
for realism, or the followers of naturalism, at'
all. My interests in the theater are for big
epics, Brecht, Arden, Shakespeare, plays
which subconciously say to the audience all
the time, "these are actors on a stage."
You're not eavesdropping, I don't like fourth
wall stuff at all. And I like musicals, big musi
cals. These are things I find don't go well at
home; they go well in the cinema, in a cer
tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
other hand, there are some films which are
almost square — there's a film by Goretta
called La Deritelliere, The Lacemaker, about
a girl gone mad. Beautiful film, now my
agent has a tape of that and we watch it every
three months on a television set. I saw it first
in the cinema, and I find I have the same re
sponse to it, watching it in a sitting room.
Reeves was asked whether he would like
to work in the cinema. He replied that the
working conditions would not suit him,
since he was used to working with actors
over a period of time and being able to make

changes at the last minute. . .
Which I suppose is a way of saying that I am
very actor-orientated, that that is what has
kept me in the theater for 15 years, that I en
joyed working with actors. Unless you're re
ally interested in working with actors, I don't
think you should be a director, I don't think
you should be in there. I think you're there
to get the smell of watching these curious
creatures — actors are very strange people
— actually create things out of themselves.
And what's good about it is watching it hap
pen. ..
I like the cinema, I spend more time in the
cinema than I do in the theater. I find the
cinema, the American cinema, very good. I
don't go to the theater very much because I
find it boring. I've had so many boring eve
nings in the theater, I have to be really
twisted. Someone must come in and say,
"Listen, it's really fantastic," and I have to
trust them and know that they might really
be reporting accurately, for me to go to the
theater now. I don't get bored in the cinema.
I don't suppose I see very many bad films,
there are so many good ones.
Daily: Have you been to any plays in this
area?
Reeves: Yes, I saw the first act of the Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre's production of
Richard 11. That's all I've seen since I've been
here.
Daily: And you didn't like that.
Reeves: It was vintage. Vintage. Vintage
Old Vic, 1950. It was — I mean, if I talk about
it, you won't be able to print it, but it really
was just appalling.
Daily: How do you go about teaching
directing?
Reeves: You can't.
Daily: What do you do in your directing
class?
Reeves: I have six students, and they are at

the moment all preparing to do their own
shows. That's all. No one taught me direct
ing; you cannot learn something which you
can only find out. It is like swimming, you
can do it on the table but it is different when
you're in the water. You have to go in at the
deep end, you have to, at some stage, sit
there in front of actors, with a script, and say,
"Right fellows, let's get on with it." You can
spend months, years, watching somebody
else do it, and it doesn't help. And you can
make it work, not having watched anyone
else do it. It has to come from you, it has to
come from relationships with the people
you're working with. . .
Now, getting people working is a human
thing. It helps to have ideas in your head, it
does help to be able to read intelligently, to
think, etc., but that's not all that it is about,
and the only way you find out is doing it. So
these six graduates were told that there
wouldn't be any formal classes in the after
noon with me directing and them watching,
but that they can get on with it. So I spent the
last three weeks reading all the plays they
want to do, and all I've done is suggest that
they might get a better performance out of
this play than out of that play, because this
play has got two girls age 22 in it, which we've
got here in abundance and they're very
good, and this play's got four men of 44 and
we haven't got any of those, so it's not going
to be so good. I mean really practical sugges
tions about how you can get the best per
formances. They're not coming to me saying,
"Well, I'm going to do this play by Sartre, be
cause I've always wanted to do this play by
Sartre, and that's what I'm going to do," wil
ly-nilly; performances are about actually
working with people who have the capabili
ty to create, do something, at this time.
I've been steering them into the fact that
the auditions for The Recruiting Officer

were overwhelming in producing a number
of extremely good girls, and slightly less in
producing men, particularly older ones. So
they're now engaged in doing their plays,
and I shall appear at rehearsals from time to
time,
Daily: Did you choose The Recruiting Of
ficer yourself?
Reeves: I was offered She Stoops to Con
quer, which I said is a play without balls and I
don't want to do it, because the 18th century
emasculated the theater, it got more and
more bourgeois. So in the Restoration peri
od you had plays in which things happened
on stage; at the beginning of the 18th cen
tury, you had plays in which things were hap
pening offstage but were still talked about;
and by the end of the 18th century, nothing
happens at all, onstage or off. She Stoops to
Conquer belongs to the latter. I gave them a
list of six or seven plays, of which The Re
cruiting Officer was one, and they chose
that.
Daily: Are you doing it "straight"?
Reeves: Oh, absolutely straight!
Daily: Do you find that the student actors
are able to put themselves into that. ..
Reeves: Very well, very well. I'm much
happier at the moment facing student actors
in The Recruiting Officer at Stanford that I
would be with an equivalent group of actors
at Nottingham, professional actors in Eng
land, because I'd still have to be explaining
to some of these actors in Nottingham what
the text meant. The advantage here is that
with a play that is not written in grunt/groan
and modern English, they still understand
the text. And it's not an easy text, maybe it's
not quite as difficult as Shakespeare, but it's
not everyday speech and the speech
rhythms are difficult and it takes a lot of work
saying it. The problem with the English actor
is actually understanding that.
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be

tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
other hand, there are some films which are
almost square — there's a film by Goretta
called La Deritelliere, The Lacemaker, about
a girl gone mad. Beautiful film, now my
agent has a tape of that and we watch it every
three months on a television set. I saw it first
in the cinema, and I find I have the same re
sponse to it, watching it in a sitting room.
Reeves was asked whether he would like
to work in the cinema. He replied that the
working conditions would not suit him,
since he was used to working with actors
over a period of time and being able to make

changes at the last minute. . .
Which I suppose is a way of saying that I am
very actor-orientated, that that is what has
kept me in the theater for 15 years, that I en
joyed working with actors. Unless you're re
ally interested in working with actors, I don't
think you should be a director, I don't think
you should be in there. I think you're there
to get the smell of watching these curious
creatures — actors are very strange people
— actually create things out of themselves.
And what's good about it is watching it hap
pen. ..
I like the cinema, I spend more time in the
cinema than I do in the theater. I find the
cinema, the American cinema, very good. I
don't go to the theater very much because I
find it boring. I've had so many boring eve
nings in the theater, I have to be really
twisted. Someone must come in and say,
"Listen, it's really fantastic," and I have to
trust them and know that they might really
be reporting accurately, for me to go to the
theater now. I don't get bored in the cinema.
I don't suppose I see very many bad films,
there are so many good ones.
Daily: Have you been to any plays in this
area?
Reeves: Yes, I saw the first act of the Amer
ican Conservatory Theatre's production of
Richard 11. That's all I've seen since I've been
here.
Daily: And you didn't like that.
Reeves: It was vintage. Vintage. Vintage
Old Vic, 1950. It was — I mean, if I talk about
it, you won't be able to print it, but it really
was just appalling.
Daily: How do you go about teaching
directing?
Reeves: You can't.
Daily: What do you do in your directing
class?
Reeves: I have six students, and they are at

the moment all preparing to do their own
shows. That's all. No one taught me direct
ing; you cannot learn something which you
can only find out. It is like swimming, you
can do it on the table but it is different when
you're in the water. You have to go in at the
deep end, you have to, at some stage, sit
there in front of actors, with a script, and say,
"Right fellows, let's get on with it." You can
spend months, years, watching somebody
else do it, and it doesn't help. And you can
make it work, not having watched anyone
else do it. It has to come from you, it has to
come from relationships with the people
you're working with. . .
Now, getting people working is a human
thing. It helps to have ideas in your head, it
does help to be able to read intelligently, to
think, etc., but that's not all that it is about,
and the only way you find out is doing it. So
these six graduates were told that there
wouldn't be any formal classes in the after
noon with me directing and them watching,
but that they can get on with it. So I spent the
last three weeks reading all the plays they
want to do, and all I've done is suggest that
they might get a better performance out of
this play than out of that play, because this
play has got two girls age 22 in it, which we've
got here in abundance and they're very
good, and this play's got four men of 44 and
we haven't got any of those, so it's not going
to be so good. I mean really practical sugges
tions about how you can get the best per
formances. They're not coming to me saying,
"Well, I'm going to do this play by Sartre, be
cause I've always wanted to do this play by
Sartre, and that's what I'm going to do," wil
ly-nilly; performances are about actually
working with people who have the capabili
ty to create, do something, at this time.
I've been steering them into the fact that
the auditions for The Recruiting Officer

were overwhelming in producing a number
of extremely good girls, and slightly less in
producing men, particularly older ones. So
they're now engaged in doing their plays,
and I shall appear at rehearsals from time to
time,
Daily: Did you choose The Recruiting Of
ficer yourself?
Reeves: I was offered She Stoops to Con
quer, which I said is a play without balls and I
don't want to do it, because the 18th century
emasculated the theater, it got more and
more bourgeois. So in the Restoration peri
od you had plays in which things happened
on stage; at the beginning of the 18th cen
tury, you had plays in which things were hap
pening offstage but were still talked about;
and by the end of the 18th century, nothing
happens at all, onstage or off. She Stoops to
Conquer belongs to the latter. I gave them a
list of six or seven plays, of which The Re
cruiting Officer was one, and they chose
that.
Daily: Are you doing it "straight"?
Reeves: Oh, absolutely straight!
Daily: Do you find that the student actors
are able to put themselves into that. ..
Reeves: Very well, very well. I'm much
happier at the moment facing student actors
in The Recruiting Officer at Stanford that I
would be with an equivalent group of actors
at Nottingham, professional actors in Eng
land, because I'd still have to be explaining
to some of these actors in Nottingham what
the text meant. The advantage here is that
with a play that is not written in grunt/groan
and modern English, they still understand
the text. And it's not an easy text, maybe it's
not quite as difficult as Shakespeare, but it's
not everyday speech and the speech
rhythms are difficult and it takes a lot of work
saying it. The problem with the English actor
is actually understanding that.
Geoffrey Reeves, a visiting professor in the
drama department this fall and spring,
comes to Stanford at the midpoint of a career
that has included work with Peter Brook and
the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as
independent work with Brook), the British
National Theatre, the Nottingham Play
house, and with groups in Denmark, Japan,
Israel, and Germany. While here, Reeves is
teaching the department's directing class
and directing the fall production, The Re
cruiting Officer. What follows are excerpts
from an interview conducted last week in
Reeves office.
Daily interview hv Mike Hale
Daily: What brings you to Stanford?
Reeves: A contract.
Daily: And before that?
Reeves: I'm particularly here because of
Martin Esslin, who I have known since I was
at University, 20 years ago. My own position

is that since I went through three univer
sities, and then went into the professional
theater as a director and basically spent 15
years — the last 15 years — directing plays in
the theater, with occasional bits of teaching
in between. The first half of that time I was
free-lancing, and the second half I was run
ning two theaters. One of those that I ran for
four years was on a campus, and I was in the
drama department, so while I was there I was
doing some teaching.
Daily: Where was that?
Reeves: This was Exeter University. At Not
tingham I had no teaching at all. I then re
signed from Nottingham, in the summer of
last year, partly because of the current state
of the theater in England, partly because I
had been doing that job for seven years and
my head was getting very filled with millions
of dollars as opposed to plays to produce,
and because of that I felt my own work was
going down. ..
I knew I wasn't going to go back to run
ning a building. I could go back to being a

free-lance director. I had accepted a com
mission from Cambridge University Press to
write a book on Peter Brook, and I was in
terested in working in television. It was sort
of premature menopause, or something. But
if you do something non-stop for 15 years —
I always was in work, I was never out of work,
I always knew where I was going next and I
was usually doing two things at once — and
so I got to that stage. Out of the blue came
this letter from Martin. Well, it was basically
irresistible. . .
Daily: You mentioned the "current state
of the theater in Britain" as a reason for your
leaving. What is that current state?
Reeves: When I came out of my third uni
versity, in Birmingham, in the middle of the
'60s, there really was only one place to work
if you wanted to do dramatic work, and that
was the theater. The British cinema has
always been an appendage of the American;

it has always been good on technicians, good
on throwing up actors, very short on direc
tors; and even when, after the sort of brave
new world of the end of the '50s and the be
ginning of the '60s, when American com
panies were making $5,000,000 movies like
there was no tomorrow (and most of them
ended up on the shelf and not shown), even
then it didn't produce any kind of serious,
consistent place to work. . .Television in the
mid-60s was still embryonic; the second
channel of the BBC had only just started, the
commercial had been going less than ten
years.
The theater, on the other hand, had a kind
of renaissance in the middle of the '50s,
when it managed to escape from its ex
clusively middle class image of doing plays
by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.
For the first time an actor like Albert Finney,
with a voice which clearly was not the
Queen's English — you did not hear the
news read in that voice — and came from the
north of England, was allowed to play major

Shakespearean parts. And a lot of play
wrights were writing plays about the world
we lived in, and they were getting them on,
and they were getting audiences. The Na
tional Theatre was just starting, the Royal
Shakespeare was just starting; it was a brave
new world. . .The point is that the difference
between the climate in the middle of the '60s
and now is enormous.
Daily: Going backward, you mean?
Reeves: No, it's going forward. I believe in
things changing, and certainly that's the
great thing about the theater, is that it
changes, it must change. It's simply that the
economic climate has not progressed
enough to make the switch between a cattle
market economy and a subsidized economy,
which is part of the thing. There werealways
serious plays presented in the West End in
London before the National Theatre got
there. They were presented by one or two
managements; there were good serious
plays, and they were presented well. Now it's
very difficult to get a serious play like that, in
any shape or form, into London, because the
Royal Shakespeare Company is there and
the National is there. So if you don't get your
work in there, you don't get it in anywhere,
and of course they have house styles and
house ideas.
The amount of work of an interesting na
ture has quadrupled in London over the last
15 years. In the '60s, the National was still
playing at the Old Vic and the Royal
Shakespeare just had the Aldwich. Now, the
Royal Shakespeare has two theaters, the Na
tional has three theaters, the Old Vic is still
there, the Young Vic has two theaters, the
Royal Court has two theaters, there's a resi
due of three or four of the fringe theaters
which were started ten years ago which are
still there and producing interesting work.
But of course what's happened is that the au
dience has not quadrupled. The audience is
totally decimated, so that you can go
through a summer at the National Theatre
with only one show, The Crucible in the
small theater, actually filling. That's where
you've got to. You can't manufacture thea
ter, like you can make cars, and then give it
to a salesman and say, "Sell it."
The upsurge which came from all the
things which were going on in the '60s, in no
sense really took root in organized thinking
of the society. You can't get a society which
has not subsidized the arts for 300 years over
night to suddenly become a liberal society.
So what happens is that people talk about
sponsorship and throw you back onto
private entrepreneurs, which means that
music goes very well, because people are
always terribly happy to put money into mu
sic because it's not dangerous, it's not about
ideas, it's not about four-letter words, it's not
about things which would get in the way. So
Covent Garden has no problems, because
Covent Garden, which makes by far the most
money of any artistic organization in Great
Britain, has a board of directors made up of
the major industrialists in the country, and
they can easily find a quarter of a million
dollars tosubsidizea new production of Ver
di's Macbeth. But the theater is not so
lucky. . .
The theater will stay the way it is, at least

until 1984, until Thatcher goes, there's no
doubt about that It'll stay like it because of
the way things are going — theater doesn't
initiate revolutions, theater can only mirror
the state of society, it can't do any more than
that. If it's on the ball, it can keep up with it,
and it can sometime> throw one or two
things up, but it can never basically be ahead
of it, or it becomes self-congratulatory, it be
comes inward-looking.
Daily: Do you think the change will have
to come from the government, in the form
of more subsidization, or will it have to come
in a change in attitude by the audience?
Reeves: I think the attitude very slowly
does change. The local governments are
used now, because they've been doing it for
so long, to give money to football pitches,
and swimming pools, and libraries, and
whenever there's a new government cut,
they don't suggest closing the libraries —
they'll close the Saturday afternoons, or
they'll take one off the staff, or something,
but they don't actually say, "close it."
Whereas they are still saying, "close the thea
ter." They still don't mind withdrawing their
subsidy and watching that go.
That is also to do with the way the society
culturally is operated. Thirty years ago in
England, you had a large number of small
theaters outside London, which all had a
very regular following — maybe a thousand
people, in some cases maybe only 500. And
these theaters always worked on the sup
position that if they filled the house on' Fr
iday and Saturday night, they would be sol
vent. For some of them, Noel Coward was
the high spot of the year, and the rest of it
was rubbish. But the people came, they
could come every week or every fortnight to
see a group of actors who they had a rela
tionship with.
This audience very rarely went to the
cinema — you know in 1950 everyone in Eng
land went to the cinema, they were selling
18,000,000 tickets a week in a country of

50,000,000; and that was the place, that was
the high spot of cinema going. The au
diences that go to the theater now still don't
go to the cinema, but the difference is, that
instead of going home to read books, play
games, or whatever else they did in the '50s,
they go home to watch television, and on tel
evision they see the best actors in the coun
try, night after night, playing good plays,and
everything from Shakespeare and Turgenev
and Chekhov to all the new stuff. Even if it's
conservative in form, they can get it there.
Which means that when they go back to the
theater, they don't have the same expecta
tions. , .
What you have outside London is dwindl
ing audiences, for the sort of things that are
being done everywhere else — they'd rather
wait, and instead of seeing Ayckbourn done
badly, or indifferently, down the road at the
theater, they wait for it to come on tele
vision, or they wait for the first-class tour to
come. There is a move now for some of the
bigger theaters in the provinces to get re
furbished, usually at local government cost.
It's happened in Nottingham, where they
spent $8,000,000 to make a theater smaller, to


Geoffrey Reeves Dlil,/Michde ' Oo, " ite


Daily/Michael Gonzales
bring it down from 1600 to 1100 seats. It is
beautiful, the front of house is beautiful, the
seats are beautiful, the dressing rooms are
the best in the country. . .Now, everyone
wants to play Nottingham because it's such
a good date, and because you can fill an
1100-seater. So you've got the existence
started of a sort of super circuit, which means
that Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham, Man
chester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, all will
be able, every year, to see four or five weeks
of opera, four or five weeks of ballet, some
operetta, some variety, the National Theatre
and the Royal Shakespeare Company on
tour, some potboilers with television stars.
They will be able to see a full range. Royal
Shakespeare, for the last few years, has been
going to Newcastle for six weeks every year,
they take the entire company and they take
four or five mainstage shows, four or five
small shows, and they all live up there for six
weeks, and they're absolutely packed out.
And people know now that once a year,
they're going to go have a feast, a festi
val.
Now I think that's a .good thing, because I
think what you've got to get theater away
from is this "tonight at 8:00," the commodity
feeling, that it's there. Nicholas Nickleby had
an enormous influence, and thp main reason
is because it's out of the ordinary, special.
People made enormous efforts — they
didn't have to make so much of an effort on
the money, it didn't cost $100 to see in Lon
don — but they did have to get out of work,
and know that they were in the theater for
BV2 hours, and take their sandwiches; it was
an event, it was a special event. And so peo
ple who would normally be looking at their
watches if the show goes beyond 10:00 and
thinking of the last train home, and wonder
ing if they can afford to sleep in the first act

because they're so tired — all of that goes by
the board, they gear themselves up for
something special. And I think the live thea
ter has to get back to that, it being something
special, in order to compete with the fact
that we are all now programmed to be able
to pick up things when we want them in
video cassettes.. . >.
Daily: You obviously think there's some
thing better about the experience of seeing a
play in the live theater. . .
Reeves: No I don't. I think it's different. I
don't personally want to see television plays
on the stage. I don't actually hold any brief
for realism, or the followers of naturalism, at'
all. My interests in the theater are for big
epics, Brecht, Arden, Shakespeare, plays
which subconciously say to the audience all
the time, "these are actors on a stage."
You're not eavesdropping, I don't like fourth
wall stuff at all. And I like musicals, big musi
cals. These are things I find don't go well at
home; they go well in the cinema, in a cer
tain way. I would personally prefer to see
Close Encounters in a cinema with eight
track Dolby than I would in a cinema
without, or at home; it is a physical ex
perience, seeing Close Encounters, and
therefore it benefits from first-class
projection and wrap-around sound. On the
