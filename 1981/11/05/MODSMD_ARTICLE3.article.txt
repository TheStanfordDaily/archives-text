# Fear of 'other guy' promotes arms race
## 
### Cici Oremland 
Difficulties in perception of what
"the other guy" is doing promotes
escalation of the nuclear arms race by
the United States and the Soviet
Union, Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky, Di
rector of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, said last night
before a general meeting of Physi
cians for Social Responsibility at the
Medical Center.
"Rather than strive for parity or
equivalence (in armament reserves)
both sides feel geniunely threatened.
Both sides say that the other has
something new and is striving for su
periority. It is hard to identify the
good guy from the bad guy," he said
before a packed crowd of 200.
Panofsky said control of nuclear
armaments should be of the highest
priority to both the United States and
the Soviet Union. Ideally, he said,
arms control should provide greater
national security with less danger and
lower costs than at present.
"The overriding interest of both
nations is in staying alive," he said.
"But the problem of arms control is
rarely as simple as an action/reaction
system." He said it is a myth that arms
control creates mutual trust among
nations. Arms control should not be
based on either nation's subjective

judgment of an opponents "good"
behavior. "It's an agreement among
adversaries," he said.
But he said control and reduction
of arms, itself, causes some further
escalation. Each nation tries to
bargain from strength, he said, citing
what he called a standard refrain,
"We can't disarm until we arm
more." Each side wants to go to the
bargaining table with something to
bargain away, he said.
He gave as example the United
States' development of the anti
ballistic missiles in the 1970s that were
not bargained away at the SALT talks.
Seven million dollars later, the pro
gram was canceled because the mis
siles were found ineffective relative
to their cost.
Panofsky discussed the pattern of
the arms race between the two na
tions. "The United States paced the
race in almost all cases, with the Sovi
et Union following four or five years
later in greater numbers (of arms) but
perhaps with less efficiency," he said.
At the present time, the global sup
ply of nuclear warheads is greater
than 50,000 and over one half of these
belong to the United States, he said.
Soviet growth has been a steady 3
percent programmed growth, he
said.

Panofsky outlined many reasons
for the continued escalation of nu
clear armaments by both sides. In
stitutional pressures by both govern
ments regardless of either nation's
political ideologies were cited.
"If you asked a Russian why does
the United States continue the arms
race, he would probably say it is be
cause he is a capitalist. The situation
would be vice-versa if you asked an
American why the Soviets continue
the race," he said.

Panofsky said each side continues
escalation because of the notion of
"mirror imaging", to counter the
other side's build up. "Nuclear
weapons have become symbols of
prestige, strength and power," he
said.
Panofsky said both sides suffer
from lack of communication. This
is especially true of the Soviet Union
due to the nature of its closed socie
ty. Each nation must rely on in
telligence projections by the respec
tive agencies of the CI A and the KGB.
But, he said the development of
satellites has improved the sur
veillance situation. "Satellite de
velopment has been the only techno
logical damper on the arms race."
Panofsky said remedies for the
arms race can only come through
policy changes by both nations. Ht?
said the nations should practice some
unilateral restraints by limiting pro
duction of fissile material, and
deployment of some of the redun
dant stockpile of arms. He also said
groups need to disseminate informa
tion on the effects of nuclear weap
ons or "they will become treated the
same as conventional weapons
without the degree of awe which
they deserve."

"the other guy" is doing promotes
escalation of the nuclear arms race by
the United States and the Soviet
Union, Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky, Di
rector of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, said last night
before a general meeting of Physi
cians for Social Responsibility at the
Medical Center.
"Rather than strive for parity or
equivalence (in armament reserves)
both sides feel geniunely threatened.
Both sides say that the other has
something new and is striving for su
periority. It is hard to identify the
good guy from the bad guy," he said
before a packed crowd of 200.
Panofsky said control of nuclear
armaments should be of the highest
priority to both the United States and
the Soviet Union. Ideally, he said,
arms control should provide greater
national security with less danger and
lower costs than at present.
"The overriding interest of both
nations is in staying alive," he said.
"But the problem of arms control is
rarely as simple as an action/reaction
system." He said it is a myth that arms
control creates mutual trust among
nations. Arms control should not be
based on either nation's subjective

judgment of an opponents "good"
behavior. "It's an agreement among
adversaries," he said.
But he said control and reduction
of arms, itself, causes some further
escalation. Each nation tries to
bargain from strength, he said, citing
what he called a standard refrain,
"We can't disarm until we arm
more." Each side wants to go to the
bargaining table with something to
bargain away, he said.
He gave as example the United
States' development of the anti
ballistic missiles in the 1970s that were
not bargained away at the SALT talks.
Seven million dollars later, the pro
gram was canceled because the mis
siles were found ineffective relative
to their cost.
Panofsky discussed the pattern of
the arms race between the two na
tions. "The United States paced the
race in almost all cases, with the Sovi
et Union following four or five years
later in greater numbers (of arms) but
perhaps with less efficiency," he said.
At the present time, the global sup
ply of nuclear warheads is greater
than 50,000 and over one half of these
belong to the United States, he said.
Soviet growth has been a steady 3
percent programmed growth, he
said.

Panofsky outlined many reasons
for the continued escalation of nu
clear armaments by both sides. In
stitutional pressures by both govern
ments regardless of either nation's
political ideologies were cited.
"If you asked a Russian why does
the United States continue the arms
race, he would probably say it is be
cause he is a capitalist. The situation
would be vice-versa if you asked an
American why the Soviets continue
the race," he said.

Panofsky said each side continues
escalation because of the notion of
"mirror imaging", to counter the
other side's build up. "Nuclear
weapons have become symbols of
prestige, strength and power," he
said.
Panofsky said both sides suffer
from lack of communication. This
is especially true of the Soviet Union
due to the nature of its closed socie
ty. Each nation must rely on in
telligence projections by the respec
tive agencies of the CI A and the KGB.
But, he said the development of
satellites has improved the sur
veillance situation. "Satellite de
velopment has been the only techno
logical damper on the arms race."
Panofsky said remedies for the
arms race can only come through
policy changes by both nations. Ht?
said the nations should practice some
unilateral restraints by limiting pro
duction of fissile material, and
deployment of some of the redun
dant stockpile of arms. He also said
groups need to disseminate informa
tion on the effects of nuclear weap
ons or "they will become treated the
same as conventional weapons
without the degree of awe which
they deserve."
