# Three Sisters' good for the uninitiated
## 
### Kevin Reidy 
I Anton Chekov's 7/ie Three Sisters, a
fcopular hit from last season, rejoined the
■American Conservatory Theatre's reperto
ry last Tuesday. The production was quite
gapnjoyable despite a few problems in cast
ing.
I The story revolves around the Prozorov
iiamily: Olga, the oldest sister and family
Supervisor, plagued with headaches;
I'Masha, the middle sister, an exceptional,
■Intelligent, passionate woman; Irina, the
■beautiful youth, full of hope and happi
■ness; and their brother Andrei, the sensi
tive, sweet, though ordinary man with
■much musical talent. The family is a patr
iarchy that has lost its father. With paternal
■guidance gone, they now have a little free
idom of speech and action, but in this ter
irible freedom the vacancy of adults who
B governed them has to be filled — by them
-1 selves. Theirs was a paradise in which they
Bonly had to follow rules. Now they must
I make the rules, and they long to be in an
I earlier existence. Along with their ser
if vants, Chebutkin, the longtime family
I friend, and the young officers who knew
I of the family, they form a cultivated, highly
I organized cell inside a crude, provincial
I city. Moscow is their past, but just as defi
| nitely it is their future. The family is surviv
| ing happy/unhappy in the midst of their
1 barren environment when Andrei marries
| the crass Natasha, a powerful represent-
I ative of the country society, who destroys
1 the family society of The Three Sisters and,
| in turn, shatters their dreams of returning
I to Moscow.
In The Three Sisters Chekhov gives us a
montage of values — happiness, marriage,
£ work, duty, beauty, cultivation,'the past,
? the present, the future, and shows us how
112 these are meaningful or meaningless to
people. Values are presented to us
through opposed opinions, opposed lives,
at different ages in life, with different emo
jj tions, and finally in different levels.
Many difficulties arise in staging The

Three Sisters, as it is filled with numerous
symbols and leitmotifs, thus preventing
the most important of them from being
too differentiated from the rest of the sur
face. Chekhov heightens the difficulty by
walking the fine line between sentimental
tragedy and paltry comedy.
In directing this production, Thomas
Moore successfuly achieves the necessary
balance between frivolity and despair.
Moreover, the performances in general
are rich enough to make the show's three
hour playing time seem much less.
Elizabeth Huddle delivers the best per
formance among the three sisters in the
role of Masha. It is the best-written role in
the show, and the most difficult, because
Masha is frustrated and difficult — she is
the sister who is willing to accept no sub
stitutes. Huddle relates well to the au
dience as she allows us to release our own
anger and frustration where the Pro
zorov's and Natasha are concerned. Her
performance is only overshadowed by that
of Peter Donat.
The role of Vershinin is double cast be
tween Peter Donat and Lawerence Hecht.
The opening night audience had the pleas
ure of seeing Donat, the ACT's finest actor,
take command of the show, as he master
fully portrayed a philosophizing, unhappy,
frustrated character who attempts to jus
tify his existence. Donat's timing is impec
cable; every subtlety of characterization is
both tragic and comic, enhancing his per
formance.
DeAnn Mears conquersthe unfortunate
task of playing Olga, to whom Chekhov al
locates numerous narrative passages and
little emotion, save migraines.
Unfortunately Stacy Ray, in the role of
Irina, is unable to induce empathy in the
audience, as she attempts to "play"
Chekhov. Her stage directions repeatedly
tell her to sob and cry, which in her inept
hands bring giggles or yawns from the au
dience.
Raye Birk, in the role of Tuzenbach, on

the other hand, demands much emotion
from the viewers as he arrur.itfh rev r.iK
the character's moral superiority along
with his delicacy, tenderness, and expec
tancy about life. His devotion to Irina is
pathetic.

Work such as this should be done in the
studio, not on the stage, because the
audience has paid to see the final product,
not the process.

Ray Reinhardt is equally strong and
touching in his performance as Chebutkin.
He reveals the comic worthlessness of the
character. His is a moving portrait of a man
completely devoid of values, a study in
apathy.
Dakin Matthews delivers an accurate yet
uneven performance of Andrei, drifting in
and out of character as the play progresses.
In conclusion, if one has never been to
an ACT production, this will be an im
mensely enjoyable show. However, after a
few ACT shows, one catches on to their
style and rhythm; thus direction becomes
contrived and ultimately, routine. This
troupe does produce tightly knit produc
tions — unfortunately, they are becoming
very indulgent, which tends to make the
performances stale. It bores me to tears to
see an actor come on stage at the start of an
act, arrange flowers, dust furniture, or
carry out other everyday activities in order
to get into character. Work such as this
should be done in the studio, not on the
stage, because the audience has paid to
see the final product, not the process.

audience has paid to see the final product,
not the process.

Ray Reinhardt is equally strong and
touching in his performance as Chebutkin.
He reveals the comic worthlessness of the
character. His is a moving portrait of a man
completely devoid of values, a study in
apathy.
Dakin Matthews delivers an accurate yet
uneven performance of Andrei, drifting in
and out of character as the play progresses.
In conclusion, if one has never been to
an ACT production, this will be an im
mensely enjoyable show. However, after a
few ACT shows, one catches on to their
style and rhythm; thus direction becomes
contrived and ultimately, routine. This
troupe does produce tightly knit produc
tions — unfortunately, they are becoming
very indulgent, which tends to make the
performances stale. It bores me to tears to
see an actor come on stage at the start of an
act, arrange flowers, dust furniture, or
carry out other everyday activities in order
to get into character. Work such as this

(Top to bottom) DeAnn Mears, Elizabeth Muddle, and Stacy Ray are the three sisters in
the ACT production of the Chekhov play.
I Anton Chekov's 7/ie Three Sisters, a
fcopular hit from last season, rejoined the
■American Conservatory Theatre's reperto
ry last Tuesday. The production was quite
gapnjoyable despite a few problems in cast
ing.
I The story revolves around the Prozorov
iiamily: Olga, the oldest sister and family
Supervisor, plagued with headaches;
I'Masha, the middle sister, an exceptional,
■Intelligent, passionate woman; Irina, the
■beautiful youth, full of hope and happi
■ness; and their brother Andrei, the sensi
tive, sweet, though ordinary man with
■much musical talent. The family is a patr
iarchy that has lost its father. With paternal
■guidance gone, they now have a little free
idom of speech and action, but in this ter
irible freedom the vacancy of adults who
B governed them has to be filled — by them
-1 selves. Theirs was a paradise in which they
Bonly had to follow rules. Now they must
I make the rules, and they long to be in an
I earlier existence. Along with their ser
if vants, Chebutkin, the longtime family
I friend, and the young officers who knew
I of the family, they form a cultivated, highly
I organized cell inside a crude, provincial
I city. Moscow is their past, but just as defi
| nitely it is their future. The family is surviv
| ing happy/unhappy in the midst of their
1 barren environment when Andrei marries
| the crass Natasha, a powerful represent-
I ative of the country society, who destroys
1 the family society of The Three Sisters and,
| in turn, shatters their dreams of returning
I to Moscow.
In The Three Sisters Chekhov gives us a
montage of values — happiness, marriage,
£ work, duty, beauty, cultivation,'the past,
? the present, the future, and shows us how
112 these are meaningful or meaningless to
people. Values are presented to us
through opposed opinions, opposed lives,
at different ages in life, with different emo
jj tions, and finally in different levels.
Many difficulties arise in staging The

Three Sisters, as it is filled with numerous
symbols and leitmotifs, thus preventing
the most important of them from being
too differentiated from the rest of the sur
face. Chekhov heightens the difficulty by
walking the fine line between sentimental
tragedy and paltry comedy.
In directing this production, Thomas
Moore successfuly achieves the necessary
balance between frivolity and despair.
Moreover, the performances in general
are rich enough to make the show's three
hour playing time seem much less.
Elizabeth Huddle delivers the best per
formance among the three sisters in the
role of Masha. It is the best-written role in
the show, and the most difficult, because
Masha is frustrated and difficult — she is
the sister who is willing to accept no sub
stitutes. Huddle relates well to the au
dience as she allows us to release our own
anger and frustration where the Pro
zorov's and Natasha are concerned. Her
performance is only overshadowed by that
of Peter Donat.
The role of Vershinin is double cast be
tween Peter Donat and Lawerence Hecht.
The opening night audience had the pleas
ure of seeing Donat, the ACT's finest actor,
take command of the show, as he master
fully portrayed a philosophizing, unhappy,
frustrated character who attempts to jus
tify his existence. Donat's timing is impec
cable; every subtlety of characterization is
both tragic and comic, enhancing his per
formance.
DeAnn Mears conquersthe unfortunate
task of playing Olga, to whom Chekhov al
locates numerous narrative passages and
little emotion, save migraines.
Unfortunately Stacy Ray, in the role of
Irina, is unable to induce empathy in the
audience, as she attempts to "play"
Chekhov. Her stage directions repeatedly
tell her to sob and cry, which in her inept
hands bring giggles or yawns from the au
dience.
Raye Birk, in the role of Tuzenbach, on

the other hand, demands much emotion
from the viewers as he arrur.itfh rev r.iK
the character's moral superiority along
with his delicacy, tenderness, and expec
tancy about life. His devotion to Irina is
pathetic.
