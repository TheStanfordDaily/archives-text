Haig says MX and B-1 are needed
Washington— Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. told
Congress yesterday that its support for MX missiles and B-1
bombers "will make or break" efforts to negotiate a new
strategic arms treaty with the Soviets next year.
At the same time, Haig disclosed there is a NATO cont
ingency plan to fire a nuclear weapon "for demonstration
purposes" should conventional war erupt in Europe.
Haig told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that
U.S.-Soviet talks for a new SALT treaty "can begin as early as
next spring."
And he said Reagan's decision to deploy MX missiles and
resurrect the B-1 bomber may worry the Soviets enough to
make them willing for the first time to negotiate reduction of
their arsenal of nuclear strike missiles.
"B-1 and MX — and the degree of Congress' support for
them — will make or break our attempt to negotiate a rea
sonable arms control agreement," Haig testified.
But he said the new Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty talks
can begin next spring only if the Soviets do not invade Po
land or otherwise worsen relations between the two super
powers.
"We should not delude ourselves that such a cataclysmic
event would not affect the arms control process," he said.
In other testimony, Haig said that there is a NATO cont
ingency plan "to fire a nuclear weapon for demonstration
purposes" should conventional warfare break out in Europe.
The object, he said, would be to forestall escalation to a full
scale nuclear exchange.
Haig said President Reagan was "precisely right" recently
in saying use of nuclear weapons might be limited to Europe.
Haig said the option of firing a demonstration weapon is an
example.
He did not elaborate, except to add that the NATO goal
has always been to "maintain violence at the lowest level."
Social Security cut plan killed
Washington— Under pressure from Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill Jr.(D-Mass.) the Democratic-dominated
House Ways and Means Committee yesterday killed a pro
posal for major long-range cuts in Social Security benefits.
These included raising the basic Social Security retirement
age from 65 to 67, reducing benefits for future retirees about
6 percent below the levels called for in current law, and cut
ting future cost of living increases.
The cuts proposal, put forward by Social Security subcom
mittee chairman J. J. Pickle i.)-Texas) and senior Republican
Barber Conable (R-N.Y.) a> a way to assure the system's
future solvency, was shot down on a largely party-line vote of
18-14.
The committee then voted to go to conference with the
Senate on a lesser bill to restore the minimum Social Security
benefit Congress killed earlier this year and to reallocate So
cial Security funds internally to tide the system over in the
short run.
Yesterday's vote on the Pickle proposal means that action
on Social Security's long-range financing problems will likely
be delayed at least until next year while a blue-ribbon presi
dential commission seeks a bipartisan solution.
Reagan reviews budget plans
Washington— With the goal of a 1984 balanced budget
fading, President Ronald Reagan is reviewing a "full menu"
of alternatives to the $115 billion in budget savings he pro
posed in September, his spokesman says.
Chief White House spokesman David Gergen told re
porters Tuesday that Reagan has been meeting with advisers
this week and "is in the process of reviewing where we
stand" in Congress regarding those proposals and how they
will be affected by forecasts that budget deficits will exceed
the administration's projections.
Although the White House review is continuing, con
gressional budget writers are starting to draft binding spend
ing outlines that likely will call for more than the $114.8
billion in budget savings over three years that Reagan had
said would be necessary to get his economic program back
on track toward a balanced budget in 1984.

The House Budget Committee was beginning work today
on the spending outlines and the Senate Budget Committee
was set to begin today.
Republican sources said the Senate panel's chairman, Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) is proposing to balance the budget by
1984 through a three-year combination of about $184 billion
in spending cuts and tax increases.
These sources, who asked not to be identified, said
Domenici's proposal anticipated about $80 billion in tax in
creases over the next three years, with the bulk of the in
creases coming in 1983 and 1984. The president has proposed
only $22 billion in higher taxes over the next three years.
Domenici's plan also would cut about $30 billion from the
Reagan administration's proposed defense buildup and
about $45 billion from benefit programs, apparently exclud
ing Social Security.
Fleet commander found on sub
Karlskrona, Sweden — Swedish military authorities yester
day confirmed the presence of a Soviet fleet commander
aboard a Soviet submarine that ran aground near a top-se
curity naval base here last week.
The fact raised speculation that the Whiskey-class sub was
on a special mission, involving several submarines, when it
ran aground. Two reported sitings of an "unidentified" sub
in the area after the grounding gave credence to this theory.
Observers noted, too, that the fleet commander's pres
ence would explain the reluctance of the sub's commander,
Capt. Piotr Guzhin, to cooperate with the Swedish investiga
tion without a green light from Moscow.
Swedish authorities said they noticed the fleet com
mander when they refloated the sub on Monday, but de
layed theofficial announcement pending verification during
an on-board inspection of the sub by a Swedish commission
of inquiry.
The fleet commander's presence will have no bearing on
the Swedish investigation of the sub's intrusion in restricted
waters, authorities said, adding that the captain alone is re
sponsible for the ship, irrespective of the presence of a
higher-ranking officer.
Swedish Commander Carl Anderson held "technical dis
cussions" with Capt. Guzhin aboard the sub yesterday and
examined the equipment that the Soviet officer said broke
down before the vessel ran aground.
Yesterday's meeting followed six hours of questioning
Monday aboard a Swedish destroyer. There was no word on
when a new hearing would be held. The sub's commander
has now refused to leave his ship again.
The Swedish government has said the sub and its crew of
about 56 men would not be released until it received a satis
factory explanation for the violation of Swedish waters. Swe
dish officials contend that the ship was fitted with in
telligence-gathering equipment for spy missions and that it
could have made its way through the islands to the area
where it ran aground only by skilled maneuvering.
Poland's leaders hold summit
Warsaw, Poland— Poland's three most powerful leaders
met for more than two hours yesterday in a session that
paved the way for new joint talks that could lead to a greater
role for the church and Solidarity in solving the nation's
crises, the state news agency said.
Gen. Wojciech who is Poland's Communist Par
ty chief, prime minister and defense minister, Lech Walesa,
head of the independent union Solidarity, and Archbishop
Jozef Glemp, Poland's Roman Catholic primate, met at a
government guest house within sight of the Soviet Embassy.
The Polish news agency PAP said the three leaders dis
cussed Poland's current crisis situation and the "possibilities
of creating a front of national understanding, a permanent
platform of dialogue and consultation of political and social
forces on the ground of constitutional principles."
The agency said the meeting was "considered to be useful
and at the same time preparatory for further essential con
sultations."
Before the meeting the Communist Party lashed out at
what it called "suicide" strikes leading the nation to "eco

nomic collapse, and Walesa warned that the Poles would
govern themselves if their demands were ignored.
Reagan denies internal problems
Washington— President Ronald Reagan says reports of
dissension within his foreign policy team are totally un
founded even though Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr.
insists a White House-based campaign to discredit him has
been under way since January.
Reagan, reacting sharply to rumors of "backbiting" among
his top aides, told reporters Tuesday, "They're very destruc
tive to our dealings worldwide," adding that foreign govern
ments are being led "to believe that there's some disarray
here."
State Department spokesman Dean Fischer took the un
usual step Tuesday of confirming a published report that
Haig believes a top White House aide is waging a "guerrilla
campaign" against him.
Informed officials, who declined to be identified, said
Haig believes Richard Allen, Reagan's national security ad
viser, is tryingto discredit him.
But Allen called a reporter late Tuesday to say Haig had tel
ephoned him earlier in the day to absolve him of responsi
bility.
"I know it is not I, and Haig knows it is not I," said Allen.
"It's wrong and it's damaging." Asked if he knew who was
trying to undercut Haig, Allen replied, "If I knew, I would be
doing something" about it.
But White House spokesman David Gergen said Reagan
does not plan to try to find out who, if anybody, is respon
sible. "He has put the matter to rest," Gergen said.
Compromise reached in Canada
Ottawa — Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said yesterday
that he and the premier of Quebec province had reached a
compromise agreement on a Canadian charter of rights, sig
naling a possible breakthrough in a year-old impasse over
constitutional reform in Canada.
Trudeau spoke with reporters during a break in the third
day of a historic conference aimed at resolving the disputes
between the national government and eight provincial pre
miers who have opposed Trudeau's plan for revamping the
constitution.
The prime minister declared he had "great news," that
"there is an alliance developing between Quebec and Cana
da."
Although Quebec Premier Rene Levesque has been one
of the staunchest opponents of the Trudeauproposals, it was
not immediately clear whether his new accord with the
prime minister meant that all the other dissident premiers
would also fall into line.
The premiers have objected to Trudeau's proposed c hart
er of rights as a diminution of the powers of Canada's 10 pro
vincial governments.
Trudeau said that under the compromise, the Canadian
people would vote on the charter of rights in a referendum if
the provinces and national government could not them
selves reach agreement on putting it into the constitution
within two years.
Stock market rally ends
New York — The stock market finished mixed yesterday as
the rally of the past three sessions faded.
Takeover issues, actual and rumored, dominated activity.
Some high-technology and hospital-management issues,
meanwhile, lost ground.
The uninspired showing of stock prices contrasted with
the bond and money markets, which had another good day
as interest rates declined.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up almost 36
points in the past three trading days, retreated 1.90 to 866.82.
Today's weather
High clouds today. Fair tonight and tomorrow. Continued
hazy. Lows in the 40s to low 50s. Highs in the mid 60s to mid
70s. Light winds.
