# Abuse of credentials causes problems

Persons falsely claiming Stanford
credentials can pose problems. Ac
cording to University officials, at
tempts are made to exploit every ser
vice available, from libraries or em
ployment and graduate school ad
missions processes.
But since Stanford is privately
owned, the University tightly restricts
the use of its resources to students,
faculty, staff and guests. Outsiders
are welcomed to public events such
as football games and concerts, but
are discouraged from using student
oriented resources such as the librar
ies and the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
To get around this policy, persons
who want to use facilities often take
advantage of students, said Gloria
Stockton, Chief of the Department of
Central Circulation in Green Library.
Often a person desiring access to
Green will claim to have lost his or
her I.D. and ask for the use of a
nearby student's I.D.
"Nine times out of ten the student
will concur," according to Stockton.
"The students think that no one will
take advantage of them, and that's
just not true. Most of these people
have no good in mind."
She said the person will enter the
library and use the card catalogue or
even check out books, and then "we
never see him again".
She explained that "the student is
generally held responsible unless he
reported his I.D. lost. If he lent it to
somebody, then he's responsible be
cause the library can do nothing
about it."
Stockton emphasized the im
portance of students notifying the
Green privileges desk if they lose
I.D.s so proper authorities can be

notified. "A problem that concerns
us on an everyday basis is the gullible
student who loses his I.D. and
doesn't realize its value to someone
else," Stockton said.
Persons with false credentials may
go further than just using the libraries
and actually apply for admission to
graduate school, but they "are not
too numerous," according to Pro
fessor Jack H. Friedenthal, Chairman
of the Admissions Committee at the
Law School. He pointed out that the
Law School's official information on
transcripts and test scores comes
from the Law School Data Assembly
Service, the same company that han
dles SAT scores, so "the information
is hard to falsify."
He noted that recommendation
letters, which might be easier to
modify, are also more likely to be re
viewed and confirmed. If the records
are falsified the applicant is auto
matically denied admission.
Friedenthal also said there are oth
er ways to catch falsifiers: 1) input
from other schools, and 2) the Bar
certifications. Friedenthal told of a
case in which an applicant failed to
mention that he had attended anoth
er law school, but the school notified
Stanford, and his admission was re
voked. He also pointed out that the
records are verified before a law
graduate is certified to practice by
the Bar. In short, Friedenthal
summed: "It doesn't pay (to
cheat)...We have our checks, and
eventually these guys get caught."
Melinda Kaewert, Supervisor of
Recruitment at the CPPC, confirmed
Stanford's "innocent until proven
otherwise" policy regarding resumes
and employment applications. "We
don't verify the information listed on
the student's resume. We expect stu

dents to honestly convey their back
ground and qualifications."
Rick Reis, CPPC Director of Sci
ence and Engineering Place
ment,confirmed that the policy
works well. He said that in four years
of counseling over 3000 people, "I've
never seen a case where a company
or employer has questioned the va
lidity or accuracy of material in a re
sume."
He explained that only a list of
courses is placed in student files at

the CPPC because "it is much more
effective (than a transcript) in telling
what the student has done and will
do, although "all companies ul
timately want a transcript."
Company interviewers at the CPPC
echoed Reis' comments, saying that
generally an official transcript is ob
tained from the school after the pros
pective employee has signed a re
lease. One interviewer said "a very
small percentage" of applicants "will
