# Clogged APU filter grounds shuttle

### Associated Press with staff reports 
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — A clogged
filter, never refurbished after Colum
bia's first mission in spring, shattered
a near-flawless countdown yester
day, grounding the space shuttle.
"We're looking at something like
Friday. Or Saturday, or Sunday or
Monday," said flight director Neil
Hutchinson-. Bill Jones, the
astronaut's trainer, said the delay
may be long enough that Joe Engle
and Richard Truly would return for
rest at home base in Houston.
A NASA spokesperson from Ames
Research Center in Sunnyvale said
"the flight will be delayed at least a
week."
The decision toscrubcamewith lif
toff 31 seconds away.
Eager to make their first tour of
space, Engle and Truly climbed in
stead from the cockpit, stiff from
nearly five hours strapped knees-up

in their flight couches. They man
aged a wry smile.
The technical problem was with
two Auxiliary Power Units — devices
that are crucial to Columbia's gui
dance. Clogged APU filters had been
untouched since the shuttle landed
after its debut flight in April. NASA's
experts thought they didn't need
maintanance.
The scrub sequence was almost the
same as April's first launch attempt.
Then the countdown clock stood at 9
minutes when a computer anomaly
caused a scrub. The shuttle lifted off
two days later for the first flight of the
world's only reusable spaceship.
Another attempt at Launch II for
Columbia cannot be made until Fri
day since it takes at least 48 hours to
unload and reload the ship's half mil
lion gallons of liquid oxygen and liq
uid hydrogen.
"We still have a need to under-
stand the problem," said NASA
spokesman Hugh Harris. "At the
present time, there has been no de
termination made as to how long it
might take to fix."
Experts said hydrazine fuel leaked
into the APU gear boxes and mixed
with a lubricant, creating extra-high
pressure and forced the scrub.
In essence, technicians will do
what motorists have to have done to
keep the>ir cars going. They'll change
the oil and filter, and if necessary
flush out the system. The APUs even
resemble a power steering pump.
The turbine-driven units generate
the mechanical power to a pump that
produces pressure for the hydraulic
system which provides the muscle to
swivel the main engines on liftoff and
move the wing surfaces for landing.
"It's going to take time to get the
filters out of the APU's and purge
them and clean them and bring them
back on line," Hutchinson said in
Houston mission control. He said he
guessed all would have gone OK if
technicians hadn't seen the pressure
and launched anyway.
