# Seventy-six year-old mystery unfolds

### Helen Casabona (Second of three parts) 
(In yesterday's story, Mrs. Stanford uttered
her final words — "Oh Cod, forgive me my sins!
This is a horrible death to die!"— and collapsed
into her secretary's arms.
(Considerable controversy surrounded, and
still surrounds, Mrs. Stanford's painful Waikiki
death. There is a great possibility that the co
founder of Stanford University was poisoned.
Someone had attempted to poison her earlier
by lacing her Poland water with a heavy dose of
strychnine.
(With good reason, Mrs. Stanford suspected
more foul play when she began to feel painfully
ill just before her death. "Doctor, I have been
poisoned. . ./'she said.)
On March 1, 1905, they day after her death,
Drs. I.H. Humphris, V.H. Murray and F.R. Day
performed an autopsy and found no evidence
that Mrs. Stanford had died from natural causes.
They reported unofficially to High Sheriff Wil
liam Henry of Honolulu that there was
strychnine poison in a bottle of bicarbonate of
soda drunk by Mrs. Stanford at approximately 9
p.m. on the night of her death.
A cablegram dated March 2, from Henry to
John Spillane, Chief of Police in San Francisco,
stated:
"The Stanford bottle of bicarbonate of soda
contained 43 drams, in which there were 662
grains of strychnine. Examination of organs un
derway."
Newspapers across the country eagerly con
sumed the story and broadcast to the nation
that Mrs. Leland Stanford, wife of the late Gov
ernor Stanford and heiress to the Stanford for

tune had been poisoned . . . murdered in Hon
olulu.
Who could think otherwise? The victim died
screaming murder, the doctors who watched
her die said she expressed all the symptoms of
strychnine poisoning, a similar attempt had
been made once before, and most convincing
ly, doctors found traces of poison in the very
same bottle from which she had taken her med
icine less than three hours before she died.
Surprisingly, within four days Honolulu pa
pers began to tell a different story. High Sheriff
Henry suddenly refused to make any further
comments about the results of the chemical or
medical examinations. He instead reported that
after 72 hours of work, two doctors from the
Board of Health and the United States Agricul
tural Station, Drs. Robert Duncan and Edmund
Shorley, had found no traces of strychnine
either in Mrs. Stanford's stomach or in her med
icines. A special cable to the San Francisco
Chronicle from Honolulu said Henry had re
fused to divulge any more information about
the case at the request of a group of Stanford
University representatives, led by President Jor
dan, which was then en route to Honolulu.
Then, on March 5, the Chronicle reported
that Henry denied ever sending the cable which
stated the chemical contents of the soda bottle
to Spillane. Henry went further to insist that he
"does not know the results of the chemist's
analysis and does not want to know until it is
forthcoming in a written report." But he had
just admitted the day before that Drs. Duncan
and Shorley had told him that the results of the
tests were negative!
The same Chronicle article reported that the

two doctors were at the police station that night
looking for Henry, and that Henry said he
planned to meet with them in the later hours.
Yet if Henry did not want to know the results of
their tests until the written report was finished,
why did he plan to meet with them on the eve of
the inquest and again on the day that the doc
tors were to submit their official report?
Furthermore, if Henry did not send the cable
to San Francisco, detailing the specific contents
of the soda bottle, who did and why? And we
cannot help but wonder what happened in that
late night meeting at the police station and how
it might have affected the report which the doc
tors were to type up the next day.
The inquest was held in the dining room of
the Moana Hotel. A gelid Berner detailed the
activities leading up to her mistress's death and
other witnesses related the final moments in
much the same way.
Several respected doctors, including Dr.
Humphris, testified that the case was typically
symptomatic of strychnine poisoning, confirm
ing that a small amount of the poison had been
found in the bottle of bicarbonate of soda.
One doctor, however, raised a few question
ing eyebrows when he pointed out that the
cascaret laxative capsule which Mrs. Stanford
took with the soda also contained a small
amount of strychnine; not enough to cause
death, but enough to cause the discoloration in
the body which was the main piece of remain
ing physical evidence that supported the
poison theory.


University News and Publications
ONLY HFR HAIRDRESSER KNOWS — Although this statue was
erected to mourn the departing of her son, Leland, the death of
lane Stanford, too, was to come sooner than expected — some
say as the result of loul play. Check tomorrow's Daily for our last
attempt at unfolding this 76 year-old mystery.
In answer to this, some phy
sicians declared that the
cascaret capsule taken in con
junction with the small amount
of strychnine in the soda would
have been sufficient to kill the
77 year old woman. Yet the
murderer presumably would
have had to know something of
the uses and effects of
strychnine and it seemed un
likely that an ordinary servant
could have devised such a plot.
But when the murderer al
legedly struck for the first time,
he or she devised no elaborate
scheme to avoid detection, in
stead putting far too much
strychnine in plain mineral wa
ter, where its well-known
acerbity would be readily
tasted.
Learning from this initial ig
norance, the murderer may
have studied up on the matter,
planned a more foolproof at
tack and struck again. This
time, he or she used a sufficient
but nearly imperceptable
amount of poison, and put it in
bicarbonate of soda where it
was much less noticeable.
In any case, the doctors' tes
timonies for strychnine poison
ing were overwhelming and
the coroner's jury decided in
less than two minutes that Mrs.
Stanford had died, "from
strychnine poisoning in
troduced into a bottle of
bicarbonate of soda with felo
nious intent. . . ."
Jordan and the Stanford de
tectives and lawyers had not
yet arrived in Honolulu. When
they did arrive, Jordan, a medi
cal doctor himself, maintained
that Mrs. Stanford had died of
natural causes. He carried her
vital organs back to the Stan
ford Medical School and per
formed a second autopsy.
Jordan concluded that she
had died of angira pectoris or
acute indigestion. "The calami
ty was hastened by unwanted
exposure and a hearty lunch
eon on thepicnictrip/'hesaid.
Mrs. Stanford had suffered
from chronic myocarditis, and
a form of heart trouble, for
many years, he explained.
Jordan also claimed Mrs.
Stanford displayed no symp
toms of strychnine poisoning
when she died. Humphris,
Murray and Day emphatically
vitiated Jordan's assertion and

detailed in scientific terms why
he was wrong.
It is interesting that all the
doctors involved in the case
agreed there was a small
amount of strychnine in both
the bottle of soda and the
corpse; all doctors, that is, ex
cept Drs. Duncan and Shorley,
the doctors from the govern
ment who arrived after the fact,
and were in clear contact with
Henry, who was in turn re
puted to be sitting in the same
cheering section as Jordan and
the University representatives.
How could the doctors who
watched the victim die, and
who performed the autopsy,
have made a diagnosis as ex
plicit as strychnine poisoning if
the cause was truly heart fail
ure? Instead, their testimonies
would be more credible than
those of the University affiliates
who had denied the possibility
of foul play from the very start.
Also, although Berner was
questioned rigorously for sev
eral days about the details of
Mrs. Stanford's activities in Ha
waii, the examinations were
not led by the High Sheriff or
the Deputy Sheriff of Hon
olulu, but "by Judge Stanley,
retained by Stanford interests,"
reported the Chronicle on
March 6.
Mrs. Stanford had just pulled
the University out of financial
ruin after combatting the fed
eral government over a tax suit,
and winning. But the school
was still standing on shaky
foundations and Jordan under
standably feared that scandal
ous repercussions from the
murder of the University's
owner might devastate its
future.
So if it is true that the natural
causes verdict was merely a
ploy to save the University, we
are left with a murder, and a list
of suspects headed by the
maid, the butler, the house
keeper and the secretary.
Any one of them could have
done it. The bicarbonate of
soda was packed in Palo Alto
and anyone familiar with Mrs.
Stanford's habits would have
known to put the strychnine
there. According to Berner's
testimony at the inquest, the fa
tal bottle of soda stood out in
an open room for several days
prior to its owner's departure.
Henry said, "If poison was

administered to Mrs. Stanford,
the plan was perfected and
poison mixed in San Francis
co."
But the police could find no
motive.
There were no apparent
motives of greed; Mrs. Stan
ford did make several changes
in her will throughout her final
years, but the final product
generally fulfilled the expecta
tions of those awaiting its pro
mulgation.
The contents of the will val
ued nearly $6 million;
$3,125,000 went to relatives,
charities and members of the
Stanford household, and re
mainder was left to the school.
Only servants of long stand
ing received any part of the
will.
Richmond, the maid who
took the sample of Poland wa
ter to the chemist for analysis,
was subsequently fired by her
mistress in a moment of fear
and paranoia. Detectives fol
lowed the former maid for sev
eral weeks and interrogated
her on several occasions, but
they finally absolved her of all
suspicion. For if Richmond had
been the murderer, she pre
sumedly could have taken pure
water to the chemist instead of
the contaminated water, and
thus prevent any thought of a
plot to poison Mrs. Stanford.
Richmond was not men-'
tioned in the will.
Could it have been Ah Wing,
the aged Chinese cook and
housekeeper? Wing's cousin,
Ah Young, was the houseboy
who served the Poland water to
Mrs. Stanford and Wing could
have easily slipped the poison
into the mineral water or the
bottle of soda. But although he
had fought with Berner earlier
in January, and continued to
hold her in low esteem, he
bore no grudge against Mrs.
Stanford. Wing received $1000
in the will.
Albert Beverly, the butler
was a slightly more suspicious
character even though he had
left the Stanford household
nine months before Mrs. Stan
ford's violent end. Beverly left
because he wanted a vacation,
he explained to the Chronicle.
But although he quit his job, he
still retained personal relations
with Berner, which led police
to inspect him more closely.

Reported the Chronicle,
"There were persistent rumors
that relations between Beverly
and Berner were extremely
close. It has been stated that
these relations were of a nature
which would not bear publica
tion."
Beverly held no job after re
signing from Mrs. Stanford's
service, and yet at the time, he
was supporting a wife and two
children. He never received
wages high enough to sustain
himself while in idleness, but
he explained to the Chronicle
that he had "grafted about
$2100 in commissions from
Mrs. Stanford," off of which he
was living. He split this sum
roughly in half with Berner, he
said.
To further complicate this
saga, Richmond had moved in
with Beverly after leaving her
job and was therefore living
with him, under unknown cir
cumstances, when her former
mistress died.

One popular theory that
emerged while the police
scrounged for motives was that
the poison was not intended to
kill Mrs. Stanford, but to kill, or
cast suspicion upon, one of the
servants.
"The Stanford household
was largely a household of
'knockers,' each employee
having a grievance against any
other to whom Mrs. Stanford
showed favoritism," wrote the
Chronicle. Berner by far re
ceived the most benefits from
her mistress, which, coupled
with her notoriously con
tumelious attitude towards the
other servants made her quite
unpopular with her peers and
therefore the most likely target
for any sort of frame-up.
The household was filled
with jealous servants who
openly competed for their mis
tress's favor. The former butler
was living with the former
maid, but was rumored to be
having an affair with the secre

tary. Even the housekeeper
had racial and personality dif
ferences with the secretary. So
we know that the servants did
not like each other, but the
question still remains, who
wanted to kill Mrs. Stanford?
The first and most obvious
suspect was Berner. She had
been with Mrs. Stanford both
in San Francisco and in Hon
olulu and had the best op
portunity to administer the
poison on both occasions.
Berner was detained by the
Honolulu police and ques
tioned extensively about every
detail of the circumstances sur
rounding the tragedy, but they
readily released her because of
her close relationship with
Mrs. Stanford, and her ap
parent lack of motive.
Although Berner received
$15,000 from the will, and was
aware that she would probably
receive such a sum, she was
hardly in financial need. She
received a salary of $200 a

month, and "she traveled all
over the world in luxurious
style at the expense of her ben
efactoress and received many
valuable gifts," reported the
Chronicle.
On March 2, two days after
the tragedy, Berner told the po
lice that when preparing to
leave for Hawaii, "I packed the
bottle of soda along with other
medicine Mrs. Stanford was in
the habit of taking."
However, on March 11, after
Stanford officials had managed
to bend public opinion
towards the "death by natural
causes" theory, and after
Berner herself had been held
as a suspect, she claimed that
Hunt, the new maid, had
packed the vial containing the
soda.
Did Berner honestly confuse
the facts or was she trying to
ward off suspicion from herself
when she made the latter
claim. . ? More details in part
three.
