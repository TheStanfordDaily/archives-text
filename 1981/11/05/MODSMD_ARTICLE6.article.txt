# Seventy-six year-old mystery unfolds

### Helen Casabona (Second of three parts) 
(In yesterday's story, Mrs. Stanford uttered
her final words — "Oh Cod, forgive me my sins!
This is a horrible death to die!"— and collapsed
into her secretary's arms.
(Considerable controversy surrounded, and
still surrounds, Mrs. Stanford's painful Waikiki
death. There is a great possibility that the co
founder of Stanford University was poisoned.
Someone had attempted to poison her earlier
by lacing her Poland water with a heavy dose of
strychnine.
(With good reason, Mrs. Stanford suspected
more foul play when she began to feel painfully
ill just before her death. "Doctor, I have been
poisoned. . ./'she said.)
On March 1, 1905, they day after her death,
Drs. I.H. Humphris, V.H. Murray and F.R. Day
performed an autopsy and found no evidence
that Mrs. Stanford had died from natural causes.
They reported unofficially to High Sheriff Wil
liam Henry of Honolulu that there was
strychnine poison in a bottle of bicarbonate of
soda drunk by Mrs. Stanford at approximately 9
p.m. on the night of her death.
A cablegram dated March 2, from Henry to
John Spillane, Chief of Police in San Francisco,
stated:
"The Stanford bottle of bicarbonate of soda
contained 43 drams, in which there were 662
grains of strychnine. Examination of organs un
derway."
Newspapers across the country eagerly con
sumed the story and broadcast to the nation
that Mrs. Leland Stanford, wife of the late Gov
ernor Stanford and heiress to the Stanford for

tune had been poisoned . . . murdered in Hon
olulu.
Who could think otherwise? The victim died
screaming murder, the doctors who watched
her die said she expressed all the symptoms of
strychnine poisoning, a similar attempt had
been made once before, and most convincing
ly, doctors found traces of poison in the very
same bottle from which she had taken her med
icine less than three hours before she died.
Surprisingly, within four days Honolulu pa
pers began to tell a different story. High Sheriff
Henry suddenly refused to make any further
comments about the results of the chemical or
medical examinations. He instead reported that
after 72 hours of work, two doctors from the
Board of Health and the United States Agricul
tural Station, Drs. Robert Duncan and Edmund
Shorley, had found no traces of strychnine
either in Mrs. Stanford's stomach or in her med
icines. A special cable to the San Francisco
Chronicle from Honolulu said Henry had re
fused to divulge any more information about
the case at the request of a group of Stanford
University representatives, led by President Jor
dan, which was then en route to Honolulu.
Then, on March 5, the Chronicle reported
that Henry denied ever sending the cable which
stated the chemical contents of the soda bottle
to Spillane. Henry went further to insist that he
"does not know the results of the chemist's
analysis and does not want to know until it is
forthcoming in a written report." But he had
just admitted the day before that Drs. Duncan
and Shorley had told him that the results of the
tests were negative!
The same Chronicle article reported that the

two doctors were at the police station that night
looking for Henry, and that Henry said he
planned to meet with them in the later hours.
Yet if Henry did not want to know the results of
their tests until the written report was finished,
why did he plan to meet with them on the eve of
the inquest and again on the day that the doc
tors were to submit their official report?
Furthermore, if Henry did not send the cable
to San Francisco, detailing the specific contents
of the soda bottle, who did and why? And we
cannot help but wonder what happened in that
late night meeting at the police station and how
it might have affected the report which the doc
tors were to type up the next day.
The inquest was held in the dining room of
the Moana Hotel. A gelid Berner detailed the
activities leading up to her mistress's death and
other witnesses related the final moments in
much the same way.
Several respected doctors, including Dr.
Humphris, testified that the case was typically
symptomatic of strychnine poisoning, confirm
ing that a small amount of the poison had been
found in the bottle of bicarbonate of soda.
One doctor, however, raised a few question
ing eyebrows when he pointed out that the
cascaret laxative capsule which Mrs. Stanford
took with the soda also contained a small
amount of strychnine; not enough to cause
death, but enough to cause the discoloration in
the body which was the main piece of remain
ing physical evidence that supported the
poison theory.

ONLY HFR HAIRDRESSER KNOWS — Although this statue was
erected to mourn the departing of her son, Leland, the death of
lane Stanford, too, was to come sooner than expected — some
say as the result of loul play. Check tomorrow's Daily for our last
