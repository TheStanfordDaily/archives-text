## Many Catholics practicing in Lithuania, despite Soviet rule 
### Los Angeles Times 
Vilnius, Lithuania — "The
faith is alive in Lithuania," the
young Catholic priest said with
soft-spoken assurance. And in
deed, despite 41 years of effort
by the Soviet state to restrict
and disparage the church, Ca
tholicism shows every sign of
remaining a potent social force
in this Baltic corner of the Sovi
et Union.
Unofficial church sources
say that between 30 percent
and 40 percent of Lithuania's
non-Russian population, or
roughly a million people, at
tend Mass regularly. As many
as 80 percent are said to con
sider themselves Catholic.
On a recent Sunday in the
Lithuanian capital, evidence of
the church's vitality was ev
erywhere. Overflow crowds
were the rule at the eight func
tioning Catholic churches in
this city of 481,000, and at two
others outside the city. The
larger churches offered con
tinuous Masses in Lithuanian
and Polish.
Attracts young
Unlike the mostly elderly
congregations often seen in
Russian Orthodox churches in
Soviet cities, children and
young adults were plentiful
here and took an active part in
the services.
Outside the gilt and frescoed
church, near the arch of the old
city's 16th-century Medininkai
Gate, small girls scurried about
in lacy white Communion
dresses and men and women
knelt in the street by a historic
shrine.
The only sign of the com
munist government was a red
and white political banner
stretched across the street
beyond the old city gate. The
banner saluted the 41st an
niversary of the advent of Sovi
et power in Lithuania.
Like Poland, to which it has
strong ethnic and cultural ties,
Lithuania has a place in history

as a collision ground between
two of the world's more
durable forces, Roman Cathol
icism and Russian imperialism.
In both countries, the church
has long been a pillar of na
tional identify and a refuge for
nationalist sentiment.
History ot tension
Tensions between the
Lithuanian church and the
dominant Russian or Soviet
state have been a permament
condition in the country — ex
cept during Lithuania's in
terlude of independence be
tween the two world wars —
ever since Catherine the Great
seized Lithuania in 1795 while
she was dividing Poland with
Austria and Prussia.
The czars, being of Russian
Orthodox faith, restricted
Catholic baptisms and con
fessions, applied — but did not
strictly enforce — censorship
in preaching, supervised ap
pointment of parish priests and
began closing monasteries. By
the time World War I began
and czarist power crumbled,
only half a dozen monasteries
remained in Lithuania.
Independence lasted from
the Bolshevik Revolution in
1917 to 1940, when Soviet
forces returned to stay. After
World War 11, the Kremlin
closed the remaining
monasteries and convents, im
posed high taxes and strict
censorship on the church and
sharply cut the flow of young
men into the priesthood.
Soviet crackdown
The Soviets also reduced the
size of the priesthood, deport
ing a third along with an esti
mated 350,000 other Lithua
nians to remote settlements
and labor camps in Soviet Cen
tral Asia, the Far East and
Siberia as partisan resistance
flared in the Ireland-sized
country, then died away.
"Russians brought the doc
trine of atheism when they
came with their tanks," one

Lithuanian priest.
However, the present Soviet
leadership shows few signs of
trying to exterminate the
church. Rather, the state's ob
jective appears to be to ensure
a docile clergy while restricting
the church's activities and
growth in hopes that it will
eventually wither away. So far,
it has not.
Vatican Radio's shortwave
broadcasts are said to be espe
cially popular among young
people. And Pope John Paul
It's Polish origins have given
many Lithuanian Catholics,
young and old, a new sense of
identity with the church.
Polish pope important
"The fact that the pope is
from a socialist country has tre
mendous meaning," one priest
emphasized in a conversation.
"He said that one half his heart
is in Lithuania."
Otfical interference with re
ligious practices is limited pri
marily to petty harrassment.
The KGB security police,
which has the main responsi
bility among government
agencies for monitoring the
church, seems to focus its
energies on the training and
conduct of priests.
Lithuania now has more than
700 Catholic priests, a little
more than half of the pre-
World War II number of 1300.
The government screens all
candidates for admission to the
seminary closely, and rejects
about half of them, according
to unofficial church sources.
Few with a university educa
tion are admitted, apparently
in an effort to hold down the
intellectual level of the
priesthood. One priest said
that the KGB tries to recruit
almost all as informers.
Some priests believe author
ities are less likely to take re
pressive measures against the
church because of events re
cently in Poland.
