# India, Pakistan feud at border
## 
### Washington Post 
Islamabad, Pakistan — The
number of shooting incidents
between Pakistani and Indian
troops along the disputed
Kashmir border has more than
doubled over the past year to a
seven-year high, reliable Paki
stani and diplomatic sources
reported here Tuesday.
While the U.N. observer
force that oversees the cease
fire line refused to detail the
exact number of violations,
they confirmed that new highs
for the year had been reached
in July, August and October.
Authoritative Pakistani
sources have cited more than
30 such incidents along the
cease-fire line last month.
16-hour battle
According to reports
circulating here, one of the ex
changes was a 16-hour en
counter that ranged along a

seven-mile stretch of the front
near the town of Kotli in the
central portion of the cease
fire line.
There have been no reports
of either Indian or Pakistani
soldiers being killed or
wounded in the latest flare
ups, though the Indian press
said an army captain died in a
firing incident in July.
All the shooting incidents
are reported by Pakistan since
India has refused since 1971 to
make any complaints to the
U.N. observers.
Nonetheless, diplomats here
and in New Delhi believe the
increase is real and reflects
worsening tensions on a
border along which squabbles
break out over the most minor
incidents.
Fxchanpes common
Pakistan's president,

Mohammad Zia ul-Haq has dis
missed the cross-border firings
as "routine" events when op
posing forces face each other
"eyeball to eyeball" across a
contested line.
The director general of the
Institute of Strategic Studies
here, Noor Ahmed Husain,
however, called the increase in
shooting incidents, which he
blamed on India, part of "a war
of nerves against Pakistan by
India and the Soviet Union."
Currently, the two neighbor
ing nations that have fought
three wars — two over control
of Kashmir — sincethey gained
independence 34 years ago are
conducting a diplomatic waltz
over Zia's surprising offer in
September of a nonaggression
pact between India and Paki
stan.
