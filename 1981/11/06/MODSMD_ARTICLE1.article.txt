# Runner raped near Stanford stadium
## 
### 
A female runner was raped yester
day morning between 10:30 and 11
near the athletic fields close to Stan
ford Stadium, according to Campus
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The student, who declined to be
identified, was grabbed from behind
and pulled into nearby bushes. After
the rape, she sought medical help,
and, at her request, medical officers
alerted the police.
Herrington said the rape occurred
"near Angell Field and the Sunken
Diamond" but that officers could find
no trace of the rapist because they re
ceived the report an hour after the at
tack.
Stanford Police Officer Tony
Navarra said this was the first re
ported rape of a jogger during day
light hours in several years.
Police are searching for a black
male, 18 to 20 years old. He is approx
imately 5 feet 10 with a "short afro"
and a museular build. The rapist was
wearing light blue runhing shorts
itnd tee shirt. There is no composite
drawing or further description of the
rapist available now.
Herrington said there was little the
police could do to prevent rapes in
areas with so many bushes and trees,

but that the police "will try to put a
patrol car around there (the Stadium
area) . . . although there are areas
there we can't even get to. There's
nothing magic about that area; there
are similar areas all over campus."
He said campus police have at most
four cars on patrol at any given time,
but that the effectiveness of patrol
cars is limited because "this place is
huge."
Herrington urged women "not to
run alone not only there (the rape
site) but everywhere" and, if they
run alone, to stay within sight of oth
er runners. Navarra said women
should be sure "not to get too far into
a secluded area."
Both officers asked women to re
port rapes, attempted rapes, and any
other sexual harassment. "If we get
that information, we can help," said
Herrington.
The last reported campus rape oc
curred in the faculty housing area in
September, and an attempted rape
occurred on Sept. 28 between Tres
idder Union and Old Union. Despite
these incidents, Navarra said, "I
haven't noticed any trend of rape in
creasing."
