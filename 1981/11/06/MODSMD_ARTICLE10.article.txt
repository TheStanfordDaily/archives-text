# Costa Rica has bleak economy, US aid
## 
### Washington Post 
San lose, Costa Rica —
Five months after Costa Rica
negotiated a three-year,
$330 million bail-out from
the International Monetary
Fund, its economy has slid
to the point where interna
tional commercial banks
have suspended all lending
and the government has
ceased paying all but partial
interest on its $2.7 billion
debt.
In recent weeks the gov
ernment of Central Ameri
ca's only civilian democracy
has retained three Ameri
can consulting firms to be
gin negotiations on debt
rescheduling with the com
mercial banks. Additionally,
since Costa Rica is what
Washington says it would
like the rest of Central
America to be politically, it
believes the United States
will pay almost any price to
help it stay afloat.
The 2.2 million people of
this proud, self-consciously
democratic country con
tinue to maintain their
equanimity about the
future, and confidence in
Costa Rica's pluralistic tradi
tion.
Bad manafioment
But a combination of fac
tors on the international ec
onomic scene and the ill
fated melding of good in
tentions with bad man
agement domestically have
made Costa Rica's economy
one of the weakest in a re
gion where strong econo
mies have ceased to exist,
and moved it ever more

rapidly toward total col
lapse.
For the first time in 30
years Costa Rica's economy
is shrinking instead of grow
ing. Official estimates place
the drop in gross national
product at between one and
two percent. Other analysts
estimate it will be more than
5 percent.
With the recession comes
more than 8 percent visible
unemployment, and if one
counts underemployment
the figure is perhaps twice
that.
Meanwhile, inflation is
running at between 40 and
60 percent. The national
currency, the colon, has
plummeted against the
dollar.
Maintain subsidies
Yet the government con
tinues to maintain subsidies
on public transportation
and basic foodstuffs. A bus
ride costs less than three
cents. Costa Rica imports
beans from Chile at 20 co
lons a kilo (2.2 pounds) and
sells them here for six co
lons a kilo.
After Costa Rican refusal
to meet the IMF's politically
difficult economic
guidelines, the United
States lobbied hard with the
fund to reach a new agree
ment.
Months of haggling led
finally to an agreement in
June for the IMF to grant a
three-year, $330 million ex
tended fund facility. The
first scheduled disburse
ment should have come in
August, but Costa Rica's

government did not even
ask for it, knowing that it al
ready is in noncompliance
with some parts of the
agreement and is seeking to
renegotiate terms with the
fund once again.
International commercial
banks have stopped lending
to Costa Rica, and the gov
ernment here is hard
pressed just to meet the in
terest payments on its cur
rent debt.
Inflation foreseen
To work its way out of this
economic morass Costa
Rica has retained Kuhn,
Loeb Lehman Brothers In
ternational and two other
American financial consult
ing firms to spearhead ne
gotiations. Domestic credit
to private business has dried
up meanwhile, so the gov
ernment is about to renew it
by, in effect, printing more
money. That almost certain
ly will result in more infla
tion.
Yet despite the bleak eco
nomic picture, San Jose
bears few evidences of eco
nomic disorder or decay.
Strikes remain few and
brief. Few people march in
the streets and when they
do they are peaceful. An
outbreak of terrorism in the
spring and early summer ap
pears to have been crushed
by rapid investigation, ar
rests and luck — at least for
the moment — and three
months later the whole af
fair seems to many Costa Ri
cans like little more than a
bad dream.

The general election
scheduled for February is
the basic reason for the rela
tive complacency in a re
gion where similar econom
ic problems have helped
precipitate vicious cycles of
revolution and repression.
For 30 years Costa Ricans
have been building a
unique democratic tradi
tion in Latin America,
without an army and with
the highest standard of liv
ing in the area.
On Feb. 7 Costa Ricans
will choose a new president
and in May he will take of
fice.
The main focus of U.S.
policy here until then is to
keep a lid on the economic
crisis and avoid its spilling
over into violence, accord
ing to concerned officials.
More U.S. aid
To keep that from hap
pening, more economic aid
will be forthcoming from
Washington, including
Food for Peace loans, prob
ably of about $30 million,
designed to relieve some of
Costa Rica's balance of
payments problems and
help generate funds for self
help projects, according to
authoritative sources.
Virtually everyone here
expects that the winner of
February's election will be
Luis Monge, the National
Liberation Party candidate,
who plans fiscal con
servatism.
Much of the present crisis
is blamed on the leadership
of President Rodrigo
Carazo.
