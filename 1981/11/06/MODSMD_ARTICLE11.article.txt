## The 						Great Run: a race for fun and charity 
### Madeline Kirbach 
Stanford will witness its fourth annual Great Run
tomorrow. Sponsored by the Delta Upsilon (DU) and
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternities, the pro
ceeds of the 10 kilometer race around campus will be
used for sending needy children to summertamp,
The Great Run was initiated here four years ago at
the suggestion of Son Spradlin, a member of the San
Francisco Guardsmen. The Guardsmen, a philan
thropic organization of businessmen in the Bay Area,
annually raises money to send about 4000 young chil
dren to summer camp. Each fall, Spradlin helps the
fraternities organize and administer the run.
There should be few changes in the format of this
year's rare. According to DU Dave Migdley, the event

"should go exactly like last year â€” at least we hope
so." One minor change from the years past will be the
elimination of the shorter 2-mile run for non-athletes
and younger children.
Registration for The Great Run will begin at 10 a.m.
on Angel Field. The registration fee, which will be
donated to charity by the fraternities, will be S3 for
students with an ID card, $5 for those without. After
registering, each participant will be placed into cate
gories according to age and sex.
The race will begin at noon on McDonald Road,
near Angell Field.
The DlJ's, under the direction of Midgley and
Hansen, will be in charge of setting up and chalking
the course, and doing "splits" at each mile mark. A

DU will ride a bicycle ahead of the frontrunners to
keep them on the right track.
As the participants cross the finish line at Angell
Field, they will be greeted by the Stanford Band, the
Dollies, and free Geyser Spring Sparkling Water.
The SAE's will take down the runners' finishing
times and the results for all age and sex categories will
then be tabulated by computer. Eight special plaques
will be awarded to the top finishers in the open men
and women, boys and girls, and student men and
women divisions. The two runners-up in each catego
ry will receive certificates.
"It's especially important that the students under
stand that the purpose of the run is forcharity," men
tioned Spradlin, "and of course, for fun!"
