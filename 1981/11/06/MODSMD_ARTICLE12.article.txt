# Energy awareness â€” a burning issue
## 
### Dan Turner 
In this community of peo
ple with loud stereos, small
refrigerators and extra room
lights, energy conservation
is an important necessity.
"The programs we've
been doing have been very
successful, said Energy Con
servation Center Director
John Eaton. "In the dorms
we've reduced energy con
sumption in the order of 20
percent, and in the Row
houses and frat houses con
sumption has gone down
from 10 to 15 percent."
The ECC is working to im
prove this record. Cutting
down on dorm lighting is
not the only way to save
energy, said Eaton."l think
one of the key things that
would make the campus
more energy-efficient is im
proving the utility systems -
some of the heating sysrems
just don't work the way they
should."
In order to accomplish
this, the ECC has been
granted a federal loan of
$1.2 million by the Depart
ment of Education, which
will go towards an improve
ment and update of the
campus heating systems, a
modification of campus
lighting - changing incan
descent lights to flourescent
- and insulating a number of
dorms, with concentration
on Escondido Village.
The center began as the
pilot-project of a class at the
Institute of Energy Studies
called "Energy Alternatives
for Stanford" four years ago.
Originated by Karl Johnson,
the project was intended to
reduce energy consump

tion at Lagunita Court.
Eaton replaced John
son as director last year.
From February to April
1977, the project cut back
Lagunita's kilowatt energy
hours from the previous
year by 36 percent.
For the last two years,
each dorm has appointed an
energy representative to
make students more aware
of how mi h energy their
dorm is using, how much
this energy is costing, and
how to cut down on this
amount.
"I think the energy reps
are a key to the success of
the center," said Eaton. "It
works out well having
someone in the dorm who
sees things like lights and
stereos left on, and can talk
to the people inside the
dorm to try and change
things."
The dorm reps have only a
limited connection with the
ECC. They are an invaluable
source of publicity for the
center in that they are re
sponsible for presenting
ECC information at dorm
meetings, yet there are no
regular meetings of these
representatives, and they
are not supervised by the
ECC staff.
Bari Weick, a junior at Ar
royo, has been a dorm rep
for two years. He explains
his own methods of initiat
ing support and keeping
consumption at Arroyo
down to a minimum.
"I try to make myself real
ly visible. When I walk down
the hall and see somebody's
lights on when they're not
around, I turn them off."

According to Weick, it isn't
always easy to convince stu
dents about the importance of
energy conservation."Some
people are a bit defensive
about it,"says Weick. "They
think it's an invasion of their
privacy. Others don't see that
they as individuals will make
much difference. Most are re
ally good about it, though."
Alice Wells, dorm rep at
Larkin, is somewhat skeptical
about the effects that the sys
tem have had so far.
"If we didn't have the five

people at the center in charge,
I don't think anything would
happen at all. Everyone talks,
but nobody does anything
about it . . . most people still
take conservation as a joke."
According to Wells, the cen
ter's efforts should become
more successful as time goes
by. "At Larkin, people have
grown much more conscious
now than they were at the be
ginning of the year. When we
started out, bathroom lights
would be left on all night. Now
we take showers in the dark,
because it's a 'sensual ex
perience.' "
