What else can go wrong at Diablo
Canyon? It seems as if new "mis
takes" incurred during the construc
tion of the controversial nuclear
power plant are being disclosed on
an almost weekly basis. With each
new disclosure Pacific Gas and Elec
tric's credibility has sunk lower and
lower. At this point, if I were to wake
up tomorrow to the news that, due to
a map reading error, the plant was ac
tually built in Nevada, I wouldn't be
all that surprised. I would probably
just think to myself, "so that's why
Reagan decided not to put the MX in
Nevada," yawn, and hit the snooze
button.
While the events at Diablo Canyon
admittedly are of special interest to
West Coast residents, the situation
could also be directly significant to
the rest of the country. If the Reagan
administration follows the precedent
it is now setting in dealing with the
lingering aftermath of Three Mile Is
land, federal funds could be used to
pay for these mistakes. Thus, the cost
of PG&E's incompetency may even
tually be shared by every taxpayer in
the country.
The "events" which occured at the
Three Mile Island power plant in
March 1979 left more than a legacy of
fear and uncertainty. Hundreds of
thousands of gallons of radiation
contaminated water, miscellaneous
nuclear waste products, and the
highly radioactive damaged fuel core
itself await attention. It is estimated
that the clean-up of Three Mile Is
land could take from six to nine
years. The final cost could be $1
billion or more. Furthermore, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) staff has warned that if the

plant is not cleaned up quickly, an
equipment failure could permit a
chain reaction to accidently start
again. There is also a fear that the
contaminated water could seep into
the water table under the plant. Al
ready, radioactive rat droppings have
been found in buildings on the site.
The Reagan administration has
asked Congress for $123 million over
(he next three years as a first install
ment to help pay for the Three Mile
Island clean-up. This amounts to a
direct government subsidy for the
troubled nuclear power industry,
sheer hypocrisy in light of the admin
istration's heavy emphasis on shifting
the federal role in industry over to
the private sector. Indeed, in order to
reduce federal involvement in the
development of alternative energy
sources, the administration has al
ready ordered sharp cuts in spending
for solar and conservation programs.
There is an argument against nu
clear power which has often been
obscured by other, more immediate
concerns, such as health and human
safety. This argument is one of eco
nomics. Without federal subsidies,
the nuclear power industry would
soon be bankrupt in more than just a
moral sense. In asking for,and receiv
ing, federal clean-up funds, the
plant's owner, General Public Utili
ties, has sought for the government
to assume what should be a legit
imate cost of their doing business. If
the company did not have sufficient
capital or insurance funds to pay for
this clean-up, it had no business in
operating the plant in the first place.
As history has shown time after
time, man is not perfect. Therefore
there is a certain fallacy to expecting

any man-made system to operate
flawlessly for prolonged periods of
time, no matter how many back-up
systems it has. Vet in operating plants
like Three Mile Island without suffi
cient funds to cover any foreseeable
catastrophe, the utilities have made
exactly this assumption. If the plants
are as safe as they claim, they should
be able to buy adequate insurance. If
the plants are unsafe, why are they
operating?
It is irresponsible for the nuclear
industry to operate in an under
insured state. It is doubly ir
responsible for the government to
bail them out whenever this policy
gets the industry into trouble. And
for the Reagan administration, which
has made a sideshow of its de
termination to reduce government
intrusion into private enterprise,
continued nuclear industry subsidies
are also hypocritical.
Ultimately, the consumer will pay
for the Diablo Canyon debacle. If the
federal government steps in with
bail-out funding, as at Three Mile Is
land, the cost will be distributed over
the population of the entire country.
If PG&E simply raises its rates, the cost
will be more locally concentrated.
The plant already is licensed for low
level testing, and barring a total
catastrophe, the NRC isn't about to
scrap the $2.3 billion plant over a mi
nor issue like earthquake survivabili
ty. Any day now I expect to wake up
to the news that the plant is already
operating; having been accidently
turned on by a janitor looking for the
control room's light switch.
