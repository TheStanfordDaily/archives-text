## Gay groups have rights too 
### 
Washington — Earlier this month, prime-time tele
vision debuted its first homosexual hero, Sydney Shorr.
To our surprise, the nation didn't freak out.
Actor Tony Randall's portrayal of a lonely, sometimes
selfish middle-aged man, in fact, will become a regular
Wednesday night feature.
Though the word "homosexual" will never be men
tioned during the series, it's generally agreed that Syd
ney is different from other male leads.
While America took Sydney's "coming out" in stride,
it may not mean times have changed. Too many politi
cians can still,make a living baiting homosexuals.
In Florida, for example, the state legislature recently
enacted a law that all but eliminated student groups
which officially aid, counsel, organize or welcome
homosexuals. The law's co-author told our associate,
Michael Duffy, that the bill was designed to keep gays off
college campuses.
Trask teamed up with another legislator after a student
at Polk County Community College decided to organize
a homosexual support group on campus. When the
school refused to recognize the group, the student ap
pealed to the state and won. But then the legislators
stepped in. ,
Waving course catalogues from Florida State Univer
sity, Trask told his colleagues that such non-credit uni
versity courses as "Gay Rap Sessions" and "Lesbian Rap
Sessions" weren't in the state's interest.
Trask pushed through an amendment to the annual
budget prohibiting state aid to colleges or universities
which fund, recognize or give meeting space to any stu
dent group which advocates "sexual relations between
persons not married to each other."
The law is so broad that it threatens to put most sexual
information centers, women's groups and student coun
seling and (eferral organizations out of business on col
lege campuses.

Indeed, the law sufficiently upset the University of
South Florida's student government that its delegates of
ficially "endorsed" sexual intercourse in an effort to pro
voke an aid cutoff.
At Florida State in Tallahassee, the chief homosexual
organization, "Gay Peer Volunteers," also contests the
new law. This group recruits volunteers to counsel stu
dents op sexuality and provides physician referrals. It re
ceives $382 a year in student activity funds.
Like the thousands of women's health centers which
have proliferated on college campuses during the last 10
years, homosexual rights groups are nothing intolerable.
Nearly 30 percent of private colleges and 80 percent of
public universities recognize such groups. Meanwhile,
only 2.7 percent prohibit them.
Strong opposition, however, may not reverse the Flor
ida legislators' wisdom. Gov. Bob Graham confesses he
only signed the bill because a veto would have killed the
entire bifdget. And it's never easy to vote against bills
which prohibit sex between unmarried people.
Of course, one wonders why the Florida moralists
don't tire of hassling homosexuals. At the very least, the
lawmakers could have looked into the activities of cam
pus gfoups before enacting their prohibition.
Groups that counsel young people about sexuality and
sexual responsibilities simply fill a void in their upbring
ing. That's why students founded these groups in the first
place. What the opponents overlooked is that these or
ganizations frequently contribute in the development,
safety and well-being of students.
But regardless of their effectiveness, student groups of
all kinds should be allowed to flourish in the collegiate
environment. Such freedom is a trademark of the Ameri
can university.
