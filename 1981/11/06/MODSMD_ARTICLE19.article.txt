## Women's Center structure misrepresented 
### 
We write to correct recent pieces
in the Daily which we feel mis
represent the Stanford Women's
Center Collective's response to the
Phi Delta Theta calendar project. Asa
collective, we represent a wide spec
trum of opinions. Despite a Daily arti
cle to the contrary, the Center has
not taken a position on the calendar,
though many individual collective
members have worked against it. We
are not a group of fanatics who de
nounce dissenters, instead we re
sponsibly incorporate their view
points into our decisions. This
statement, for example, reflects a
position arrived at collectively after
long thoughtful discussion. Our di
versity is reflected in the range of
projects our members take on: we do
much more delightful and interest
ing work than reacting to the Phi
Delts.
It is ironic that collective members
are being attacked for having strong
feelings about the calendar, since the
Phi Delts called us and solicited our
reactions. We did not descend un
asked upon hapless fraternity men
engaged in a community benefit
project. Though collective member
Sharon Silverstein returned the ori
ginal call four days after the first con
tact was made (not two weeks, as has
been claimed), this was before many
of us returned from summer vaca
tion, and no position could be taken
Silverstein brought their lequest to
our first collective meeting. At that
point it seemed clear that the Phi
Delts did not really want constructive
criticism, since they rejected sugges
tions, including Silverstein s offer to
talk to women being photographed

in order to present an alternative
viewpoint.
Although we appreciate a chance
to raise important issues on the pages
of the Daily, we are also heavily in
volved in other types of community
education. We welcome women and
men, feminist or not, to participate in
our discussions, lectures, film series
and other projects. In the past we
have brought a variety of speakers on
political and social issues to campus,
sponsored film series, parties, cof
feehouses, and workshops on ev
erything from journal-writing to bike
repair. We share office space and
moral support with the YWCA, Pro-
Choice Alliance, Aurora and the
Rape Education project. This year we
will do dorm outreaches, a Women's
Week, and we will continue to give
financial support to projects like
Rape Awareness Week, Third World
Week, and Semana de la Raza. Our
feminist library and information
and-referrals service are open for the
students, staff, and faculty. In short,
we exist to enrich women and to en
hance the Stanford community. We
are proud to be such a strong,
positive force on campus.

Stop stealing flags
Haus Mitteleuropa has recently
come to realize that the latest pas
time on the Row is stealing our flags.
We have had flags (of Austria and
West Germany) taken from our living
room, and flags (German, Austrian

and Swiss) have been torn, with their
hooks, out of window sills on the
front of the house.
In certain circumstances, this is an
amusing prank to pull, the humor of
which we are fully aware. However,
when flags are taken with no inten
tion of returning them, and when ac
tual damage to them and the house
occurs, we can no longer be so toler
ant.
Haus Mitt has done nothing to de
serve such activities as retribution.
On the contrary, we feel that we are
vulnerable victims solely because we
are the only Row house to have flags
in such a visible pl^ce.
Each of our flags is worth approx
imately $60, which makes it difficult
for the house to replace them. On
the other hand, if we are unable to
hang our flags either indoors or out
doors, we might just as well not have
the flags at all.

We're the imperialists
George Duca's Commentary (Dai
ly, Nov. 2) may serve as a model for a
trite morality play on the evils of to
talitarianism, but provided precious
little insight into the problems faced
by either Romanians or other Eastern
Europeans.
One traditional message of propa
gandists everywhere is: See how
much better off we are than the "oth
er side." Duca has certainly fash
ioned his comments in accord with
this homily. We read of censorship,
regimentation, food shortages, eco
nomic disruption and domination by
the USSR. Furthermore, Duca uses

those convenient little buzz words
guaranteed to start the true-blue
American frothing at the mouth:
"communist" and Marxist-Leninist."
By now, we ought to be convinced
that communists ea' babies and en
gage in every vile practice im
aginable . . . don't they?
The same charges leveled against
the Romanian regime apply just as
accurately to El Salvador and a host of
other dictatorships; just alter the
name of the dominating country to
"United States."' Imperialism was
hardly invented by the communists.

Solve parking problem
When are we going to be provided
with adequate parking, for which we
are charged, but which we don't get?
For those of us who work in the
central part of campus, the position
has become ridiculous and very
time-wasting.
For example, the parking lot on
Panama Street inevitably is full every
morning by 9 o'clock. After this,
there is a constant procession of cars
playing musical chairs, driving round
and round in search of a space.
Some have raised the possibility of
a class action suit againsttheadminis
tration, to force them to provide as
many parking spaces as they sell per
mits.
Surely it need not come to a class
action suit. Surely common sense can
be found somewhere?
