# More complaints to Ombudsman reported

The number of rases reported to
Ombudsman John Goheen has in
creased over the past few years, ac
cording to Goheen's annual report
published earlier this week. The in
crease may be due to heightened
publicity of the ombudsman's office,
he said. Goheen also suggested that
"uncertainty about future career
possibilities" could cause greater
competition and perhaps Honor
Code violations or other stress-re
lated occurrences.

This hypothesis is further ex
emplified in a study on premeds here
by Dr. Saul Rosenberg. It was con
cluded that "competition for ad
mission to Medical School and, to a
lesser extent, premed course re
quirements, are seen as the main
causes of these problems by all
groups, but premeds also feel that
student attitudes contribute to their
problems."
Procedures for handling Honor
Code problems can be found in nu
previous non-U.S. schooling is proc
essed and sent to the appropriate de
partments which make the selection.
Foreign students applying for un
dergraduate admission here must
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) as well as the TOEFL if, neces
sary, said Bunnell. "The same criteria
exists for foreign students as for U.S.
c itizens applying," he said.
Although diversity is desired
among Stanford's freshman classes, it
is only one factor in the selection
process and does not guarantee a
foreign student's admission, said
Bunnell.
Of the countries represented by
Stanford's foreign student popu
lation, Japan and Canada have con
sistently contributed large numbers
of students, said to Mary Clark, assis
tant director of the Bechtel Center.
The strengthening of diplomatic

relations with the People's Republic
pf China has led to sharp rises in the
migration of Chinese students to U.S.
schools, said Ziegler. Twice as many
Chinese students enrolled here this
fall compared to 1980
From Europe, England and France
have continually led in number of
students admitted, said Clark. Be
cause of their regional and
linguistical ties, the 172 students from
( anada outnumber those from any
other foreign country, said Ziegler.
The number of students arriving
here from the Middle East has risen
153 percent since 1971, with Iran and
Israel contributing the highest per
centage of students from that region,
said Clark. Many of the Iranian stu
dents currently enrolled were ad
mitted during the rule of the Shah,
vshile recently the number of ap
plications from that country have de
creased slightly, said Ziegler.
