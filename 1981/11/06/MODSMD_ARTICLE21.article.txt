## Va. Republicans affix blame after loss 
### Washington Post 
Richmond, Va. â€” Virginia
Republicans, stunned by their
first major statewide defeat in
16 years, turned on their fallen
gubernatorial candidate and
on each other as they groped
for an explanation for Tues
day's Democratic sweep.
Marshall Coleman, whose
brash, self-confident style had
grated on many GOP elders,
was roundly criticized for run
ning a campaign for governor
that relied too heavily on Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's coattails
and too little on the advice of
fellow state Republicans. Many
argued that the GOP campaign
wrote off large chunks of the
electorate, including thestate's
black voters, without galvaniz
ing conservatives in the tradi
tionally Republican suburbs.
Even Gov. John Dalton,
Coleman's most ardent sup
porter during the campaign,
sniped at his political protege
at a press conference Wednes
day, calling Coleman's pledge

to veto any tax increase "a mis
take ... I felt the tax issue would
come home to haunt him."
Others insisted it wasn't so
much Coleman but his party,
overconfident after more than
a decade of electoral victories,
that was to blame. "The Re
publicans finally got so cocky
and arrogant that they brought
the Democrats back together,"
said one GOP operative. He
derided efforts by the Re
publican National Committee
to salvage Coleman in the cam
paign's final weeks as "that su
per-jock Republican stuff" that
turned off Virginia voters.
Robb overwhelmed Cole
man by 54 to 46 percent, ac
cumulating a 105,000 vote
margin and winning nine of the
state's 10 congressional dis
tricts thanks in large part to an
unexpectedly high voter turn
out of more than 65 percent.
Democrats and Republicans
alike credited Robb with forg
ing a remarkable coalition of
old-line conservatives and

traditional Democrats such as
blacks and liberals.
Both sides cited a number of
factors in the heavy turnout, in
cluding warm, sunny weather
and the most elaborate Demo
cratic get-out-the-vote effort
in recent years. But the key ele
ment, both sides agreed, was
Coleman's constant emphasis
on the Reagan connection, a
strategy even the Republicans
admitted had backfired.
Republican state Sen. Wiley
Mitchell of Alexandria said the
vote in his Northern Virginia
district was close to 20 percent
higher than he expected in a
gubernatorial year. Mitchell
said blacks, lower-income and
elderly voters came to the polls

to send a message to the White
House. "They were not particu
larly interested in candidates,
issues or experience; they
were interested in sending a
message across the Potomac
River."
There were widespread
complaints about Coleman's
media campaign, which party
regulars criticized as too
negative, and field organiza
tion. All of that was dismissed
by Coleman supporters as sec
ond-guessing. "If we had won,
the party people not in love
with Marshall would have been
standing in line for their in
augural tickets," said Matt
Wirgau, who headed Cole
man's field operation.
