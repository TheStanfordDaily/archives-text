# Business merger waters seem shark-filled
## 
### 
New York (AP) — It's true what they say about the
world of business today, that it's a place wherein the
bigger fish swallows the smaller one — and then
sleeps with one eye open lest it be swallowed too.
A survey confirms it. More than one-third of re
spondents, all chief financial officers, told the Na
tional Association of Accountants that their firms
were actively seeking to merge with or acquire oth
ers.
Forty-nine percent of the respondents then replied
that theirown companies, though often actively seek
ing to buy up or take over other companies, were
themselves vulnerable to a takeover effort.
About 50 percent boasted that they weren't vulner
able - 1 - and then 38 percent of them conceded that
they had developed formal plans aimed at thwarting
any attempt by another company to seek control of

them.
That picture of a shark-infested corporate ocean
was developed from inquiries to the 1500 biggest in
dustrial companies. Thirty-two percent, or 480 com
panies, responded to the September-October survey.
The results drew the comment from Robert Shultis,
chief executive of the NAA, the nation's largest as
sociation of management accountants, that ex
ecutives "must be sleeping with one eye open."
When one-third of the biggest companies are look
ing for someone to take over, said Shultis, it con
stitutes a fever, "and it looks like the fever is going to
continue unabated for the foreseeable future."
The response of one chief financial executive, who
declined to have his named used, offers an insight
into one possible reason for the rash of mergers and
takeovers, some by companies whose earnings are

poor.
The increase, said the executive, "is a symptom of
fewer growth opportunities, a maturation of industry,
a lack of vigor in American business." The preoccupa
tion, he added, "distracts larger companies from de
votion to new businesses and to developing new
technology."
In defending the bigness that follows mergers, one
executive observed that "you must not forget the in
ternational competition for world markets." Another
reminded critics that some mergers lead to lower
costs and greater productivity.
But another area of criticism concerned the
amounts of credit required for mergers. Said
one:"The huge lines of credit being maintained by
major corporations must be having an elevating effect
on interest rates in general. This is obviously harmful
to the general economy."

New York (AP) — It's true what they say about the
world of business today, that it's a place wherein the
bigger fish swallows the smaller one — and then
sleeps with one eye open lest it be swallowed too.
A survey confirms it. More than one-third of re
spondents, all chief financial officers, told the Na
tional Association of Accountants that their firms
were actively seeking to merge with or acquire oth
ers.
Forty-nine percent of the respondents then replied
that theirown companies, though often actively seek
ing to buy up or take over other companies, were
themselves vulnerable to a takeover effort.
About 50 percent boasted that they weren't vulner
able - 1 - and then 38 percent of them conceded that
they had developed formal plans aimed at thwarting
any attempt by another company to seek control of

them.
That picture of a shark-infested corporate ocean
was developed from inquiries to the 1500 biggest in
dustrial companies. Thirty-two percent, or 480 com
panies, responded to the September-October survey.
The results drew the comment from Robert Shultis,
chief executive of the NAA, the nation's largest as
sociation of management accountants, that ex
ecutives "must be sleeping with one eye open."
When one-third of the biggest companies are look
ing for someone to take over, said Shultis, it con
stitutes a fever, "and it looks like the fever is going to
continue unabated for the foreseeable future."
The response of one chief financial executive, who
declined to have his named used, offers an insight
into one possible reason for the rash of mergers and
takeovers, some by companies whose earnings are

poor.
The increase, said the executive, "is a symptom of
fewer growth opportunities, a maturation of industry,
a lack of vigor in American business." The preoccupa
tion, he added, "distracts larger companies from de
votion to new businesses and to developing new
technology."
In defending the bigness that follows mergers, one
executive observed that "you must not forget the in
ternational competition for world markets." Another
reminded critics that some mergers lead to lower
costs and greater productivity.
But another area of criticism concerned the
amounts of credit required for mergers. Said
one:"The huge lines of credit being maintained by
major corporations must be having an elevating effect
on interest rates in general. This is obviously harmful
to the general economy."

New York (AP) — It's true what they say about the
world of business today, that it's a place wherein the
bigger fish swallows the smaller one — and then
sleeps with one eye open lest it be swallowed too.
A survey confirms it. More than one-third of re
spondents, all chief financial officers, told the Na
tional Association of Accountants that their firms
were actively seeking to merge with or acquire oth
ers.
Forty-nine percent of the respondents then replied
that theirown companies, though often actively seek
ing to buy up or take over other companies, were
themselves vulnerable to a takeover effort.
About 50 percent boasted that they weren't vulner
able - 1 - and then 38 percent of them conceded that
they had developed formal plans aimed at thwarting
any attempt by another company to seek control of

them.
That picture of a shark-infested corporate ocean
was developed from inquiries to the 1500 biggest in
dustrial companies. Thirty-two percent, or 480 com
panies, responded to the September-October survey.
The results drew the comment from Robert Shultis,
chief executive of the NAA, the nation's largest as
sociation of management accountants, that ex
ecutives "must be sleeping with one eye open."
When one-third of the biggest companies are look
ing for someone to take over, said Shultis, it con
stitutes a fever, "and it looks like the fever is going to
continue unabated for the foreseeable future."
The response of one chief financial executive, who
declined to have his named used, offers an insight
into one possible reason for the rash of mergers and
takeovers, some by companies whose earnings are

poor.
The increase, said the executive, "is a symptom of
fewer growth opportunities, a maturation of industry,
a lack of vigor in American business." The preoccupa
tion, he added, "distracts larger companies from de
votion to new businesses and to developing new
technology."
In defending the bigness that follows mergers, one
executive observed that "you must not forget the in
ternational competition for world markets." Another
reminded critics that some mergers lead to lower
costs and greater productivity.
But another area of criticism concerned the
amounts of credit required for mergers. Said
one:"The huge lines of credit being maintained by
major corporations must be having an elevating effect
on interest rates in general. This is obviously harmful
to the general economy."

New York (AP) — It's true what they say about the
world of business today, that it's a place wherein the
bigger fish swallows the smaller one — and then
sleeps with one eye open lest it be swallowed too.
A survey confirms it. More than one-third of re
spondents, all chief financial officers, told the Na
tional Association of Accountants that their firms
were actively seeking to merge with or acquire oth
ers.
Forty-nine percent of the respondents then replied
that theirown companies, though often actively seek
ing to buy up or take over other companies, were
themselves vulnerable to a takeover effort.
About 50 percent boasted that they weren't vulner
able - 1 - and then 38 percent of them conceded that
they had developed formal plans aimed at thwarting
any attempt by another company to seek control of

them.
That picture of a shark-infested corporate ocean
was developed from inquiries to the 1500 biggest in
dustrial companies. Thirty-two percent, or 480 com
panies, responded to the September-October survey.
The results drew the comment from Robert Shultis,
chief executive of the NAA, the nation's largest as
sociation of management accountants, that ex
ecutives "must be sleeping with one eye open."
When one-third of the biggest companies are look
ing for someone to take over, said Shultis, it con
stitutes a fever, "and it looks like the fever is going to
continue unabated for the foreseeable future."
The response of one chief financial executive, who
declined to have his named used, offers an insight
into one possible reason for the rash of mergers and
takeovers, some by companies whose earnings are

poor.
The increase, said the executive, "is a symptom of
fewer growth opportunities, a maturation of industry,
a lack of vigor in American business." The preoccupa
tion, he added, "distracts larger companies from de
votion to new businesses and to developing new
technology."
In defending the bigness that follows mergers, one
executive observed that "you must not forget the in
ternational competition for world markets." Another
reminded critics that some mergers lead to lower
costs and greater productivity.
But another area of criticism concerned the
amounts of credit required for mergers. Said
one:"The huge lines of credit being maintained by
major corporations must be having an elevating effect
on interest rates in general. This is obviously harmful
to the general economy."
