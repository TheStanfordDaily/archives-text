## Floating in 1-7 doldrums Cards look for win in Beaverland 
### Sally Jenkins 
Call it true confessions, candor, an effort
at preserving some semblance of dignity in
the midst of broken hopes, broken bones
and broken plays.
The Stanford football team headed by
coach Paul Wiggin, injury-ridden, stagger
ing beneath the weight of a 1-7 record and
an eighth place standing in the Pacific-10
conference, steadfastly maintains that it is
fumbling for answers.
Tomorrow the Cards take on the Ore
gon State Beavers in Corvallis, Ore., a team
with an equally bad record at 1-7 overall,
and at the cellar of the Pac-10 with an 0-4
mark in conference play.
The Beavers are coming off a humiliating
45-3 thrashing at the hands of 2-6 (2-3 in
the Pac-10) UC-Berkeley last week, while
the Cardinals salvaged respectability in the
fourth quarter against the University of
Washington, losing 42-31 after a 42-7 third
quarter deficit.
"This has been a frustrating season for all
of us," said Wiggin/'We continually place
ourselves in large-deficit situations,early in
games, and then fall short with spirited
comebacks. As a coaching staff, we're still
searching for answers. I hope we can find

some this weekend in Oregon."
But these days the Cardinals resemble
Johnny Carson's Great Carnac. They have
the answers on their fingertips, as their first
and fourth quarter scoring bursts of late in
dicate. But they don't seem to know the
questions — questions for offensive coor
dinator Jim Fassel like, "Have we been sac
rificing one of the most effective scoring
weapons in the country for the sake of
some vague idea of consistency?"
Stuck in the quagmire of an identity
crisis, when the Cardinals finally decided
to open the gates in the first half against Ar
izona State two weeks ago, everything but
the hounds of hell came flying out. It ap
peared that the ruby slippers had been
there all along in the extraordinary talents
of quarterback John Elway and halfback
Darrin Nelson, but they had chosen to go
to go, of all places, to Kansas.
The Beaver matchup is the last turning
point for the Cards, and Fassel finally has a
clearcut question to work with. OSU is the
first of three losing teams the Cards will
face in their last three games, and in order
to salvage respectability for the season as a
whole, all must be wins. So does Fassel go
to Kansas, or knuckle under and try to re

find the divine decadence of the Instant
Offense?
The Beavers have lost 21 of their last 22
games, a losing streak that goes back to
1979. The nearly non-existent defense has
sprung for 39 points and 460 yards-per
game this season. The Beaver offense has
been good for only six points in the last
two weeks, the last TD coming in a 56-17
loss to Washington.
Their offensive problems may be due in
part to a leadership problem. Freshman
quarterback James Burton started against
Cal, replacing junior Ed Singler. Burton
completed only one pass of seven for 14
yards, but racked up 89 yards rushing
against the Bears.
Don't be deceived; Stanford will need
every bit of generosity the OSU defense
can muster, because the Beavers have a
tendency to toughen up against the Cards.
Their last Pac-10 victory was, in fact, over
Stanford, a 33-31 thriller in 1979 capped by
a fluke when Cardinal Rick Cervais started
to return a kickoff from his own two-yard
line but inadvertently retreated to the
endzone for a safety, giving the Beavers
the victory.

and at the cellar of the Pac-10 with an 0-4
mark in conference play.
The Beavers are coming off a humiliating
45-3 thrashing at the hands of 2-6 (2-3 in
the Pac-10) UC-Berkeley last week, while
the Cardinals salvaged respectability in the
fourth quarter against the University of
Washington, losing 42-31 after a 42-7 third
quarter deficit.
"This has been a frustrating season for all
of us," said Wiggin/'We continually place
ourselves in large-deficit situations,early in
games, and then fall short with spirited
comebacks. As a coaching staff, we're still
searching for answers. I hope we can find

some this weekend in Oregon."
But these days the Cardinals resemble
Johnny Carson's Great Carnac. They have
the answers on their fingertips, as their first
and fourth quarter scoring bursts of late in
dicate. But they don't seem to know the
questions — questions for offensive coor
dinator Jim Fassel like, "Have we been sac
rificing one of the most effective scoring
weapons in the country for the sake of
some vague idea of consistency?"
Stuck in the quagmire of an identity
crisis, when the Cardinals finally decided
to open the gates in the first half against Ar
izona State two weeks ago, everything but
the hounds of hell came flying out. It ap
peared that the ruby slippers had been
there all along in the extraordinary talents
of quarterback John Elway and halfback
Darrin Nelson, but they had chosen to go
to go, of all places, to Kansas.
The Beaver matchup is the last turning
point for the Cards, and Fassel finally has a
clearcut question to work with. OSU is the
first of three losing teams the Cards will
face in their last three games, and in order
to salvage respectability for the season as a
whole, all must be wins. So does Fassel go
to Kansas, or knuckle under and try to re

find the divine decadence of the Instant
Offense?
The Beavers have lost 21 of their last 22
games, a losing streak that goes back to
1979. The nearly non-existent defense has
sprung for 39 points and 460 yards-per
game this season. The Beaver offense has
been good for only six points in the last
two weeks, the last TD coming in a 56-17
loss to Washington.
Their offensive problems may be due in
part to a leadership problem. Freshman
quarterback James Burton started against
Cal, replacing junior Ed Singler. Burton
completed only one pass of seven for 14
yards, but racked up 89 yards rushing
against the Bears.
Don't be deceived; Stanford will need
every bit of generosity the OSU defense
can muster, because the Beavers have a
tendency to toughen up against the Cards.
Their last Pac-10 victory was, in fact, over
Stanford, a 33-31 thriller in 1979 capped by
a fluke when Cardinal Rick Cervais started
to return a kickoff from his own two-yard
line but inadvertently retreated to the
endzone for a safety, giving the Beavers
the victory.
