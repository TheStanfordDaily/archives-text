# Poloists face Trojans, 49ers
## 
### Chris Addington 
"Long Beach will probably
be the team we will be playing
in the NCAA finals. Now is the
time to make them realize we
are definitely the superior
team," said Stanford water
polo coach Dante Dettamanti
about tomorrow's match
against the Long Beach State
49ers.
Stanford will warm up this af
ternoon against USC and after
the last escapade with the Tro
jans, Stanford is psyched for a
little revenge. Remember that
the last time Stanford played
USC, the Trojans shorted their
pool and showed up for the
game 20 minutes late. In the
words of Dettamanti "We have
a little extra incentive to beat
USC after all the garbage they
pulled down South."
The Long Beach State 49ers
are ranked N0.2 in the nation
having lost only five games this

year, two of those to Stanford,
and are the biggest threat to
Stanford's perfect 24-0 record.
They have excellent talent, fine
shooting arms and a good
blend of experience. The Cards
defeated Long Beach by a score
of only 10-8 when the two
teams last met at the Pac -10 â€”
PC A A tourney last weekend.
USC is paced by top
freshman recruit Mike Spicer.
The Trojans are young and in
experienced, but are capable
of pulling a few surprises. They
have upset such highly re
garded powers as UCLA and
Santa Barbara. When Stanford
played USC in Watts, the
Cardinals triumphed 13-5.
Stanford intends to utilize its
typical game plan for both
matches. As always, that in
cludes lightning fast breaks,
quick outlet passes and
tenacious defense, thrown in
with a little spice and razzle

dazzle which makes for a thor
oughly exciting match.
The Cardinals are lead this
season by junior James
Bergeson with 56goals and sen
ior Jody Campbell with 51.
While outscoring their oppo
nents more than three to one,
the Cardinals also appear to be
be headed toward their first
undefeated season in 13 years.
T he Long Beach State contest
will be Stanford's last home
game before they face
Berkeley the morning of the
Big Game. This will also be the
next-to-last home appearance
of such Stanford greats as
Campbell, Alan Mouchawar,
Chris Kelsey, Bill Taylor, and
Vince Vanelli.
Today's game against USC
will sprint off at 3:00 and
tomorrow's match against the
49ers will start at 11:00. Ad
mission will be free.
