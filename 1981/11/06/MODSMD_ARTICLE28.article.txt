ond to Stanford this season,
drops their record to 5-4 in
NorCal play. In the previous
meeting between the two
teams, Stanford handed Cal
a 3-1 setback on its own
court.
This week the Cardinals
needed only three games to

put Berkeley away. In the
first game, Cal jumped off to
an early 6-5 lead before sen
ior Jan Linden served for
eight points to give Stanford
control at 13-6. The spikers
went on to pick up an addi
tional two points as the
squad took the first game
15-6.
In the second game of the
contest, strong serving by
Cal senior Debbie An
derson enabled the Bears to
jump out to an early 6-0 ad
vantage. The Cardinals
evened up the contest at 6-6
before pulling ahead 8-7.
Senior Chris Anderson
served for the final four
points, and Stanford pulled
ahead 2-0 in the match.

fans to exciting volleyball in
the third game of the out

fight back early in the con
test to erase the quick Cal
lead of 4-0 and tie the score
at 4-4. Berkeley pulled
ahead again by three points
before Stanford evened up
at 7-7.
The teams then scored in
frequently, siding-out on
most points played, until the

Head coach Fred Sturm,
however, said that he be
lieves much of his .quad's
success can be attributed to
the additional coaching

lead of 4-0 and tie the score
at 4-4. Berkeley pulled
ahead again by three points
before Stanford evened up
at 7-7.

spikers went on to take the
next point, the game and
the match.
Sophomore Bobbi Broer
and freshman Brandace

looked impressive in the
backcourt for the Cards.
Seniors Linden and An

stamina to Stanford's attack.

Head coach Fred Sturm,
however, said that he be
lieves much of his .quad's
success can be attributed to
the additional coaching
ability of his assistant, Don
Shaw.
"Don is such an integral
part of this team," Sturm
said, "and he often does not
get the credit that is ctae
him. But the skill and knowl
edge that he has brought to
the squad is invaluable."
