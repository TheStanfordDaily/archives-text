"lt was one of our better
efforts, this year and we're
really pleased with the
team," emphasized assistant
coach Don Shaw in analyz
ing the Stanford volleyball
squad's performance.
Indeed, the Cards over
powered their rivals from
across the bay, U C-
Berkeley, in three straight
games, 15-6, 15-7 and 16-14
Wednesday' night at home
in Maples Pavillion.
The victory, which was
Stanford's sixth in a row,
came back to back with
Tuesday night's win over the
University of San Francisco.
The spikers upped their sea
son record to 23-9 overall
and are holding onto sec
ond place in the Northern
California Athletic Con
ference with a 7-1 mark be
hind undefeated University
of Pacific.
The Bears' loss, their sec
ond to Stanford this season,
drops their record to 5-4 in
NorCal play. In the previous
meeting between the two
teams, Stanford handed Cal
a 3-1 setback on its own
court.
This week the Cardinals
needed only three games to

put Berkeley away. In the
first game, Cal jumped off to
an early 6-5 lead before sen
ior Jan Linden served for
eight points to give Stanford
control at 13-6. The spikers
went on to pick up an addi
tional two points as the
squad took the first game
15-6.
In the second game of the
contest, strong serving by
Cal senior Debbie An
derson enabled the Bears to
jump out to an early 6-0 ad
vantage. The Cardinals
evened up the contest at 6-6
before pulling ahead 8-7.
Senior Chris Anderson
served for the final four
points, and Stanford pulled
ahead 2-0 in the match.
Both teams treated the
fans to exciting volleyball in
the third game of the out
ing. The Cards again had to
fight back early in the con
test to erase the quick Cal
lead of 4-0 and tie the score
at 4-4. Berkeley pulled
ahead again by three points
before Stanford evened up
at 7-7.
The teams then scored in
frequently, siding-out on
most points played, until the
Bears took a 14-11 advan-
