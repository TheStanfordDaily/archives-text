# Physicians urge end to arms race

A nuclear warhead explodes over
an American city. The blast kills ev
eryone within a six-mile radius.
Within 10 miles, blast waves, 180 mile
per hour winds and firestorms would
kill 50 percent of the population. An
other 40 percent would be injured.
These grim estimates are published
by Physicians for Social Responsi
bility (PSR), a national non-profit or
ganization of doctors and scientists
advocating a halt to the nuclear arms
race.

PSR started in Boston in the early
19605, but died after the Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty was signed in 1963. In the
last two years, however, Harvard Uni
versity medical personnel and others
in the Boston area have resurrected
the group in the wake of the failure
of the Strategic Arms Limitation
(SALT) II talks.
The national organization includes
chapters at Stanford and the Mid-
Peninsula, San Francisco, Marin and
other areas of California, according
to Stanford member Scott EI rod.
Chapter coordinator Kevin Lemley
said the PSR organizes symposiums in
major cities around the country ev
ery few weeks. Attendance averages
between 1000 and 2000 people, al
though Lemley said a recent sym
posium in Los Angeles drew 3000
people.
The symposiums feature promi
nent speakers such as former Secre
tary of State Cyrus Vance, and former
presidential advisors, according to a
PSR newsletter.

Lemley said physicians attending
receive credit for continuing medical
education necessary to maintain
their certification.
As a non-profit organization, PSR
seeks to make the public aware of the
consequences of nuclear war. The
group has shown a videotape, "The
Last Epidemic," in the Palo Alto area
several times, and plans to show it
again Nov. 10.
"The Last Epidemic" depicts the
consequences of one 20 megaton
nuclear bomb exploding over San
Francisco.
