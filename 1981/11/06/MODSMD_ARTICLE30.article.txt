# Booters look to bite Fresno Dogs
## 
### Adam Berns 
Although the Stanford soccer team has
no chance to make the regional playoffs,
it's still playing for pride.
With only three games remaining, Stan
ford's 11-5-2 record will be severely tested
tommorrow against the Fresno State Bull
dogs.
Fresno State is an excellent soccer team
that only recently has started to reach its
full potential. The Bulldogs boast a 12-5-2
record which includes recent 3-0 and 3-2
wins over Santa Clara and San Jose State.
Currently, they are tied for second in the
Pacific Coast Soccer standings.
"Fresno State is an unbelievably upstart
team," Stanford coach Nelson Lodge said.
"They are a team which is peaking rather
late which is not too good for us."
One of the keys to Bulldog success this
season has been their incredibly solid de
fense, especially the play of senior Kirk
Shermer, who Lodge called the best goal
keeper in California. Shermer is6-2and in
credibly quick. So far this year, he has six
shutouts to his credit.
Besides its excellent defence, Fresno

State has some scoring threats as well.
Strikers Brett Stoner and Tony Brown lead
the Fresno State attack with six and five
goals respectively.
"The Bulldogs have two seasoned
strikers," Lodge said. "Tony Brown from
England is the person that most concerns
us, although they have an incredibly well
rounded attack."
Defense will probably plav a major part
in how well Stanford does tommorrow. \l
though the defense played well last Tues
day, it has probably been the weakest part
of Stanford's game.
Fresno State should provide the
Cardinals with a real test. The Bulldogs are
primarily a teamwhich plays solid defense
and scores just enough goals to win. They
play a total team game and Stanford can
not afford to make any errors if it wants a
shot at winning tommorrow's game.
Last year, Stanford lost to Fresno State in
a tough 2-1 overtime match. Lodge felt that
the memory of that game should help to
provide motivation for his team. He also
added that in order to win tomorrow, it's
going to take a total team effort.

"My concern is not necessarily for cer
tain individuals, but for the entire team to
play well." he said. "Everybody must play
their best game. I think one advantage we
have this year is the way they beat us in ov
ertme last vear. That should help motivate
us because none of us want that to happen
again."
The Cardinals should be aided tomor
row by the return of senior striker Ted
Ratalovich who is recovering from an in
jury. Rafalovich played a key part in Stan
ford's overtime win last Tuesdav, and is the
leading assister on the team.
In Stanford's three remaining games,
motivation will probably be the Cardinal's
major foe, but Lodge and assistant coach
Tony Igwe felt that their players will be
able to handle it. "Right now we're taking
the games oneatatime," Lodge said. "We
have to finish the season strong, and its
our job as coaches to make sure that we
do."
Looking ahead to tomorrow's game, the
Cardinals cannot make the kind of mis
takes that have plagued them throughout
the season.
