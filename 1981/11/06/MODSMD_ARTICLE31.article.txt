# Rams to go with Pastorini
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Anaheim â€” Los Angeles
Rams Coach Ray Malavasi
made the expected move
Wednesday, saying that Dan
Pastorini would replace Pat
Haden at quarterback starting
with Sunday's game against
New Orleans here.
The change vyas made, in all
probability, bemuse the 5-4
Rams trail San Francisco by two
games in the NFC West; be
cause their big-play offense
from last year, when Vince Fer
ragamo was quarterback, has
gone bust; because Haden is
rated 24th among the NFL's 28
starting quarterbacks, while
the Rams' passing game ranks
25th and the club clearly thinks
Pastorini can bring back the
long ball, and finally, because
the timing seems right.
In making the announce
ment before practice, Malavasi
didn't offer specific reasons.
He did say:
"We're looking for more
perfect execution than we're
getting. If we can get that, fine.
If not, Pat can get his job back,
easy."

But probably not that easily,
because Malavasi also has said
he doesn't want to play musical
quarterbacks.
Except for a fourth-quarter
relief stint last Sunday, when
H;iden was benched and Jeff
Rutledge dislocated a thumb
during the Rams' 20-13 win
over Detroit, Pastorini hasn't
played in a year. So he may re
quire patience, too, or at least
as much as a team struggling
for a playoff spot can afford.
The last time Pastorini
started, in the Oakland Raid

ers' fourth league game last
year, he broke a leg. Jim
Plunkett did his Cinderella Su
per Bowl number and
Pastorini, who had come West
in a celebrated straight-playe<
trade for Ken Stabler, didn't get
his job back. A reported fall
ing-out with Al Davis didn't
help, either. The Raiders
brought Pastorini to training
camp this past summer, then
cut him Sept. 1. The $1.05 mil
lion they are said to owe him,
from a guaranteed contract, is
being negotiated.
