Although the Guarneri String Quartet on Wednesday
aroused the audience to a pitch where an encore became
necessary, their playing was somewhat uneven in quality.
Curiously, the more modern and the more technically de
manding the music, the better the performance; the best
came last.
Given the very high reputation enjoyed by the Guarneri
the MozaTt quarter in F with which the concert opened
was disappointing. The brisk tempos which were a cons
tant feature of the evening made for moments of uncer
tainty in the work. The first violin seemed rushed into little
inaccuracies in the minuet, and all four instruments
sounded very flat at times, a difficulty of which the per
formers were clearly aware as they turned up for some
while between movements.
The unconventional Bartok quartet which completed
the first half of the program was technically highly compe
tent. The energy and briskness of playing was far better at
the height of the Ist World War, than it had been to the
sweetness of the Mozart. Bartok is not to everyone's taste,
but the Guarneri quartet made it intelligible, if not attrac
tive, to a majority of the audience.
The climax of the concert was undoubtedly the early
Rabel quartet which alone comprised the second half of
the evening. Early performances of the work, which con
tains traces of influence both of Debussy and of Ravel's
teacher, Faure, went far to establish the young Ravel's rep
utation while he was still studying at the Paris Con
servatoire. The Guarneri did full justice to its great beauty
and rich dynamics and it was this final quartet which above
all aroused the enthusiasm of the packed house.
The program was well-chosen, and overall formed a
highly enjoyable evening. It would be most interesting,
however, to know whether the personal preference> of
the Guarneri lie in the more modern direction that their
playing seemed to indicate on Wednesday night.
