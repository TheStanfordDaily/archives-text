## Beto's:More than strictly gringo stuff

I divide Mexican restaurants into two categories,
depending upon the sort of chile relleno the place
happens to serve. At the first kind, the chile rellenos
still have their stems, and are coated with a crisp but
light breading. One hears more Spanish than English
spoken by the customers at these places, whose
names one tries to keep out of newspapers. The ma
jority of Mexican restaurants, however, serve up a
hideous mass of egg batter filled with melted cheese
in which one has problems finding even a strip of
chile, let alone a whole one with a stem.
And yet my test isn't exactly foolproof, because
once in a great while, a restaurant of the second type
does manage to offer something interesting to eat.
Beto's, in Olive Tree Square on the El Camino Real,
strikes me as such a place. Most of the food is strictly
gringo stuff, something indicated by the sign advertis
ing "lonch" and "deener." Their chile rellenos aren't
even good examples of the gooey-batter variety.
The burrito on the combination plate ($5.50 to $7.50
depending on the number of items ordered) contains
a lumpish mass of ground beef and leaden refried
beans, with the same beans also forming the bottom
layer of a sodden tostada and of course filling a large
section of the plate as well. Spanish rice? Well, sort of.
And all of it is so bland that if I didn't like water so
much I wouldn't have even bothered to ask for a glass
of it.
But Beto's offers enough food of real interest to tell
me that with a little effort spent expanding its clien
tele's tastes rather than exploiting already existing

ones, it could be quite a good restaurant. Take the hot
sauce served with the de rigeur basket of chips at the
start of the meal. The chips are so forgettable they
make Doritos a cherished memory, but the salsa
cruda accompaying them — a mix of coarsely
chopped green chile, onion, tomato and cilantro —
v

made my mouth tingle with a taste dominated but not
drowned by the hot pepper. That balance is tough to
strike; I commend owner Robert Quintana and his
staff for doing so.
As for entrees, my experience at Beto's suggests
that one is far better off ordering something other
than a combination plate, however attractive the
prospect of chopped lettuce and sour cream en masse
may be. My guest and I tried came adobada ($6.95),
strips of pork that Quintana immerses in a spicy
marinade for several days before cooking them. The
result is piquant, aromatic and suffused with the de
licious smoky flavor of a charcoal grill. The restaurant
also prepares chicken in a similar manner ($5.95), and
offers a variety of other entrees, including chicken
mole and carnitas (both at $6.95), any of which should
make a pleasant dinner.
Vou can enhance your meal by knocking back
some of the restaurant's special sangria ($6.95 per
pitcher, or $1.75 per glass), a drink that is very far from
the sickening commercial product one usually finds
in restaurants. Quintana's mother comes in every
morning to make a mixture full of (he Mediterranean
sun, working from a recipe handed down from her
mother. And when the time comes, she will pass it
down to Quintana. "I don't know how to make it yet,"
he admits. "The recipe is in her will." This sangria is a
family tradition that will never outlive its usefulness —
enjoy.
Beto's has been open four months in its present lo
cation, after operating for many years a mile further
south on El Camino under the name Casa Blanca. En
tered through a rather nice Mexican boutique owned
by Quintana'swife, Beto's is open six days a week for
"breakfast, lonch and deener too." — Michael Gorra
