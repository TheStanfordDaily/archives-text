# Not a culinary peak for San Mateo

LA SUMMIT
2121 El Camino Real
San Mateo
345-1696
The United States, over the
years, has created a hybrid in
the gastronomic field, the Con
tinental restaurant. Neither
French nW Italian, nor any oth
er recognizable European
Cuisine, this invention seems
to be a novel way of disguising
the plain American restaurant.
The offerings seem to vary little
from the standard meat, soup
and salad, with the exception
of the occasional sauce to add a
touch of class to the menu.
Some restaurants, such as Mad
dalena's, manage to escape
and create a genre of their
own; others like La Summit
struggle to hold their own, and
rarely escape the mediocrity of
their aspirations.
After a long ride to San
Mateo, one's hopes are built
up by La Summit's most im
pressive exterior. The interior,
at first, also seems quite allur
ing. It is only after having been
seated and allowed to absorb
the surroundings that one no
tices that the carpeting is rather
plain, the plush on the seats is
starting to wear, and that the

whole decor, which is striving
for the elegant, somehow falls
short.
The clientele — the aging
polyester set — seems to be
having a ball, but this does little
to increase one's confidence.
The menu is fairly standard for
Bay Area continental, and con
tains nothing to arouse excite
ment. The expected Escargots
Bourguignonne, Cuisses de
Grenoui lies, Canard ' a
I'Orange, Veal Picatta, and Veal
Cordon Bleu are all present,
along with one or two slightly
more unusual dishes such as
Lapin aux Olives and Steak
Diane.
We started off with the Esca
rgots and the Cuisses de
Grenouilles. The snails were
very palatable, sufficiently
chewy and oozing with butter
and garlic. The consistency of
the frogs' legs was also ex
cellent, but like much of the
rest of the meal, the flavor was
very watered down.
Deciding to be extravagant,
we decided to share a bowl of
Onion Soup. This was a most
novel experience. Most classi
cal onion soups are prepared
by simmering the onions in a
stock, and then baking the re
sult , with a generous coating of

cheese, in an oven. La Summit's
tastes more like a cheese soup
with a liberal dose of onions
thrown in. The taste is not un
pleasant, in fact it is quite
savory, but beware, it is a sur
prise! One of our entres came
complete with soup of the day,
which happened to be Cream
of Turkey. Suffice it tosay that it
was better than Campbell's,
but not much.
Next emerged the cooker for
my Steak Diane, filet mignon
sauteed with shallots, mustard
and flambeed with Cognac. As
always a slight twinge of excite
ment ran through me as the
dish was energetically being
prepared in front of me. As the
flames died down, the steak
was rushed to my plate, and I
eagerly set at it. The steak was
tender, and the sauce tasty, yet
it lacked the panache which
the Maitre D' had shown dur
ing its preparation. The
mustard was underplayed, the
Cognac not evident and both

Worcestershire sauce and pep
per practically undetectable.
My companion's Canard a
I'Orange also lacked any great
distinction. As with the steak,
the quality of the meat was ex
cellent, but once again the
sauce lacked zest. It was not
cloying, as are so many orange
glazes, but at the same time
there was none of the complex
ity of a well seasoned French
creation. The predominant
flavor was of the thickener, and
no satisfying after-taste re
mained to savor while awaiting
the desserts.
Before I forget, the entrees
were served with three vegeta
bles, broccoli, carrots and
potatoes, but as none of them
had any taste whatsoever they
made no impact on the meal.
Desserts were Mousse au
Chocolat and Cheesecake, and
yet again the only thing I found
remarkable about them was
their mediocrity. They both
lacked flavor, and along with

exceptionally weak coffee pro
vided a very unsatisfying end
ing to an unmemorable meal.
I must say that there were
some very positive points. The
service was friendly, the wine
list good (we had a wonderful
Beau lieu Cabernet Sauvignon),
and the prices surprisingly rea
sonable. Complete dinners
range from $7.50 for Truite aux
Amandes to $9.95 for a New
York Steak, with a la carte
meals a few dollars more. If you
dine early, Sunset Dinners are
available form 5:30 to 7 and are
even less expensive.
If this restaurant had billed
itself as a good-value-for-your
money American restaurant I
couldn't imagine anyone walk
ing away dissatisfied. As it is, La
Summit claims to be among the
finest continental restaurants
on the Pen n insula; un
fortunately this representation
is sadly overstated.

dalena's, manage to escape
and create a genre of their
own; others like La Summit
struggle to hold their own, and
rarely escape the mediocrity of
their aspirations.
After a long ride to San
Mateo, one's hopes are built
up by La Summit's most im
pressive exterior. The interior,
at first, also seems quite allur
ing. It is only after having been
seated and allowed to absorb
the surroundings that one no
tices that the carpeting is rather
plain, the plush on the seats is
starting to wear, and that the

whole decor, which is striving
for the elegant, somehow falls
short.
The clientele — the aging
polyester set — seems to be
having a ball, but this does little
to increase one's confidence.
The menu is fairly standard for
Bay Area continental, and con
tains nothing to arouse excite
ment. The expected Escargots
Bourguignonne, Cuisses de
Grenoui lies, Canard ' a
I'Orange, Veal Picatta, and Veal
Cordon Bleu are all present,
along with one or two slightly
more unusual dishes such as
Lapin aux Olives and Steak
Diane.
We started off with the Esca
rgots and the Cuisses de
Grenouilles. The snails were
very palatable, sufficiently
chewy and oozing with butter
and garlic. The consistency of
the frogs' legs was also ex
cellent, but like much of the
rest of the meal, the flavor was
very watered down.
Deciding to be extravagant,
we decided to share a bowl of
Onion Soup. This was a most
novel experience. Most classi
cal onion soups are prepared
by simmering the onions in a
stock, and then baking the re
sult , with a generous coating of

cheese, in an oven. La Summit's
tastes more like a cheese soup
with a liberal dose of onions
thrown in. The taste is not un
pleasant, in fact it is quite
savory, but beware, it is a sur
prise! One of our entres came
complete with soup of the day,
which happened to be Cream
of Turkey. Suffice it tosay that it
was better than Campbell's,
but not much.
Next emerged the cooker for
my Steak Diane, filet mignon
sauteed with shallots, mustard
and flambeed with Cognac. As
always a slight twinge of excite
ment ran through me as the
dish was energetically being
prepared in front of me. As the
flames died down, the steak
was rushed to my plate, and I
eagerly set at it. The steak was
tender, and the sauce tasty, yet
it lacked the panache which
the Maitre D' had shown dur
ing its preparation. The
mustard was underplayed, the
Cognac not evident and both

Worcestershire sauce and pep
per practically undetectable.
My companion's Canard a
I'Orange also lacked any great
distinction. As with the steak,
the quality of the meat was ex
cellent, but once again the
sauce lacked zest. It was not
cloying, as are so many orange
glazes, but at the same time
there was none of the complex
ity of a well seasoned French
creation. The predominant
flavor was of the thickener, and
no satisfying after-taste re
mained to savor while awaiting
the desserts.
Before I forget, the entrees
were served with three vegeta
bles, broccoli, carrots and
potatoes, but as none of them
had any taste whatsoever they
made no impact on the meal.
Desserts were Mousse au
Chocolat and Cheesecake, and
yet again the only thing I found
remarkable about them was
their mediocrity. They both
lacked flavor, and along with

exceptionally weak coffee pro
vided a very unsatisfying end
ing to an unmemorable meal.
I must say that there were
some very positive points. The
service was friendly, the wine
list good (we had a wonderful
Beau lieu Cabernet Sauvignon),
and the prices surprisingly rea
sonable. Complete dinners
range from $7.50 for Truite aux
Amandes to $9.95 for a New
York Steak, with a la carte
meals a few dollars more. If you
dine early, Sunset Dinners are
available form 5:30 to 7 and are
even less expensive.
If this restaurant had billed
itself as a good-value-for-your
money American restaurant I
couldn't imagine anyone walk
ing away dissatisfied. As it is, La
Summit claims to be among the
finest continental restaurants
on the Pen n insula; un
fortunately this representation
is sadly overstated.

The United States, over the
years, has created a hybrid in
the gastronomic field, the Con
tinental restaurant. Neither
French nW Italian, nor any oth
er recognizable European
Cuisine, this invention seems
to be a novel way of disguising
the plain American restaurant.
The offerings seem to vary little
from the standard meat, soup
and salad, with the exception
of the occasional sauce to add a
touch of class to the menu.
