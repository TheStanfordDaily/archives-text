■ Berkeley has a repertoire
of eateries to make any
gourmet's head spin, from
stand-up pizza bars to
falafel joints to fine French
fcuisine. Restaurant Nadlne
stands as a fine example of
"the latter category and is
Lell worth visiting for a rea
sonably priced, exquisitely
prepared meal.
I Keeping in mind the old
Inaxim that you can't judge
ft restaurant by its exterior,
llon't be surprised to find
Nadine's located on an un
impressive lot in a relatively
Leserted neighborhood —
riothing very eye-catching
Wo say the least. Never
theless, the interior offers a
"clean, well-lighted place"
'with simple, tasteful decor:
a few carefully placed plants
and art prints, creating an
almost gallery-like effect.
Our table was located in
the center of one of the two
dining rooms, set directly
beneath a large dome
shaped skylight; we
couldn't see the stars, but
there was a nice feeling of
added air and space.
In keeping with the sim
plistic interior design, the
menu was typed on a single
sheet of plain white paper
with brief descriptions of
each item. Choices were
few, but it was clear that
each dish was prepared with
extreme care; owner and
head chef Jan John un
hesitatingly describes his
delicacies on the menu, e.g.
Chicken in Lime Sauce:
Breast of chicken sauteed in
butter served with sauce of
stock, lime, wine and
Madeira wine. Served with
braised Europian cucum
bers, ($10.00).
We began with a couple
of appetizers: a rabbit pate
(fresh rabbit, pork, rabbit
livers, cream vegetables,
herbs and spices) and
cabichou grille avec creme
Aigre (grilled goat cheese
with a creamy sauce). Both
($3.50 each) were served in
tiny portions with an artisti
cally placed sprig of parsley,
accompanied by a basket of
very fresh french bread. The
goat cheese was especially
good, with an exquisite,
subtle flavor and pungent
aroma.
The soup of the day,

cauliflower cheese ($2.25),
was a thick pureespiced del
icately enough to enhance
rather than mask the flavor
of the main ingredient — a
rich, tasty treat.
Our party of four sampled
three of the four entrees
available: Lamb St. John (for
two — $13.50 per person),
loin of lamb tenderly
sauteed in an excellent dark
wine sauce, served with very
fresh spinach as a suitable
complement; Pepper steak
($l2), amply peppered and
covered with a delicious
cream sauce, accompanied
by rice and zucchini; and
Poached Salmon (the fish of
the day, $12.50), an excep
tionally fresh piece of fish
covered with a delicate
hollandaise and served with
rice and sugar peas.
To accompany our meal,
we selected a Montevino
White Zinfandel ($7.50)
which we found very pleas
ant, and also tried Mon
tevi no's Cabernet
Sauvignon, a tasty and sur
prisingly light-bodied wine.
In true European fashion,
salad was served after the
main course; we each re
ceived a plate of romaine
lettuce lightly coated with a
delicious oil and vinegar
dressing.
Having already glimpsed
the dessert trays as they
were proffered to other cus
tomers, we eagerly awaited
our selections. "Cathy's
desserts" ($2 - $3 each) were
many: apple cheese cake,
rasberry tart, walnut tart,
two flavors of homemade
ice cream, or chocolate
mousse. After much de
liberation, we chose the
cheese cake (twice), a fresh
rasberry tart and a dish of
date/chocolate chip ice
cream (although the
amaretto/sour cream flavor
did receive high praise from
a neighboring table). None
of us was disappointed in
the least: the cheese cake
was wonderfully light and
smooth, the tart was sweet,
flaky and flavorful, and the
ice cream was deliciously
rich and creamy.
Even without my trench
coat and dark glasses, I was
equally taken with Restau
rant Nadine, and highly rec
ommend it as a place to go
for an elegant evening of
outstanding food, good ser
vice and relaxed at
mosphere — all for a rea
sonable price — 117 Rosner
