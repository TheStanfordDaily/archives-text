The Bandwagon
Monday, Kresge
David Thompson has written
that musicals have always been
critically suspect because they
ran offer more pure pleasure
than any other film genre. The
bandwagon fits his description
perfectly: it offers pure pleasure,
beginning to end. Fred Astaire
stars as a hoofer who returns to
New York to star in a play after his
Hollywood career falters. The
play looks great, until the direc
tor (played splendidly by the Brit
ish musical star Jack Buchanan)
dec ides to turn it into a modern
day version of Faust, complete
with damnation scene. Cyd Char
isse (a dancer whose legs must be
eight feet long: they steal every
scene) co-stars as a ballet dancer
who learns the joy of hoofing
from Astaire. The songs include
"That's Entertainment," "Danc
ing in the Dark," "I Guess I'll
Have to Change My Plan" and
"Triplets." Vincente Minnelli
directed in technicolor for
MGM.

Woman of the Year ***
leslival ( inema, Palo Alto
This 1941 film was the first in
which Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy worked together;
while there may not be the elec
tricity of Bogart and Baca 11 in To
Have and Have Not, their more
refined horseplay is just as much
of a joy to watch. Tracy, especial
ly, is at his prime — there is no
tunnier scene on film than Tracy,
as a rough-edged sportswriter,
trying to convince Hepburn's
prissy male secretary that he can
read a Chinese newspaper. Un
fortunately, the movie is
burdened with a pedestrian
screenplay — Hepburn was past
Donald Ogden Stewart and
hadn't begun her collaboration
with Garson Kanin and Ruth
Gordon — and ends up being,
despite its title, an anti-feminist
tract.
Double hilled through
Wednesday with My Favorite
Wife, starring Cary Grant and
Irene Dunne.

Gallipoli **'/2
Fine Arts, Palo Alio
For the first hourand a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
c,L>//i, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Bovd,
the it's a bloodless
movie.
— Steve Vineberg
Priest of Love **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
In striving to avoid the traps of
biographical movies, this film
about D.H. Lawrence and his
wife, Frieda Van Richthofen,
bungles the material in surprising
ways: it is ,i bewilderingly struc
tured set of flashbacks that inter
rupt an endless travelogue. The
Lawrences lake in New Mexico,
old Mexico, France and Italy, but
we keep losing track of where
they are and who they're talking
to. Lan McKellen, ideally cast as
Lawrence, has some strong mo
ments, but it's just a sketch; Janet
Suzman, as Frieda, comes off
much better.

The Stunt Man ★***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the old theme of reality
versus illusion, but in an
astonishingly witty new setting.
The director, Richard Rush, re
verses every audience expecta
tion in this audacious, kinetic
comedy about making movies.
Peter O'Toole gives an im
aginative, self delighted per
formance as Eli Cross, a film
maker who revels in risks, and
Steve R.'ilsback plays the stunt
man. The cast also includes Allen
Goorwitz (who used to be called
Allen Garfield) and Barbara
Hershey (who used to be called
Barbara Hershey Seagull).
Starts next Thursday with All

Picnic at Hanging Rock
Fox, Redwood Citv
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on an
Australian field trip. The date is
Valentine's Day, 1900, and
change is in the air; the girls are
entering adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to enter the
less genteel world of the 20th
century. Weir offers no solution
to his puzzle — it's a chronicle of
a rite of passage that obscures its
voyagers,
Plays Sunday and Monday with

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alio Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood; Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion ot the
tiody Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its enter. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.
— S.V.
Life of Brian **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sort of like Codspell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it'sall funny,
but it goes on for much too long.
The Monty Python troupe takes
aim at Biblical epics, terrorist
logistics, and the PLO; while they
don't always score, in this form
even a string of bullseyes would
be boring. A Python movie needs
a better plot than the Bible can
provide.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with Bedaz/lcd, which features
Dudley Moore and Racquel
Welch as Lust.

All That Jazz ★**
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled ex
amination of his own life and
near-death is the kind of self-in
dulgent mistake that seems
doomed to fail. But Fosse's too
damned talented for that result;
frustratingly, the movie fluc
tuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant. It's hard to think of
something more self-conscious
than a huge dance number about
your own open-heart surgery,
and the show-bi/ schmaltziness
that Fosse stuffs the sequence
with borders on self-parody.
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the
start with this movie — but he
took it to the limit anyway.
Roy Scheider stars. Starts next
Thursday.
— Ron Lillejord
Tess *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Ash'eton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens c haracter.
— S.V.

Rich and Famous
Hijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

Take the Money and Run
Saturday Cuhherlev
Woody Allen directed, sloppi
ly, this ill-mannered, insecure, lit
tle runt of a movie. It's all about
how tough life can be for an ill
mannered, insecure, little bank
robber who gets caught because
the tellers can't decipher his
handwriting. The movie's a mess,
but style doesn't seem to be what
Allen was after at this point in his
career. It's also a very funny mess,
which goes a long way toward re
deeming its weaknesses. Allen's
then wife, Louise Lasser, co-stars.

Southern Comfort ****
Old Mill, Mountain View
A National Guard unit has
been sent into the Louisiana
swamps on war games; they steal
some canoes, shoot a volley of
blanks at a couple of Cajuns as a
joke, and real violence erupts.
Walter Hill's exciting movie
about the causes and conse
quences of violence has a
broader focus than one might ex
pect, and a consistently am
bivalent point of view of the Ca
juns who entrap the guardsmen;
it's a movie that expands in ret
rospect. Keith Carradine, I K.
Carter, Lewis Smith and Les Lan
nom contribute interesting per
formances.

Arthur
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies thut were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who fails in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an ac tress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Breathless ****
Tuesday, Bishop Auditorium
In the early '60s, the films of
the French New Wave shattered
every rule ot classical filmmaking.
Ironically most New Wave films
now seem friendly and familiar —
audiences have become as ac
customed to the new rules as they
were to the old. But Breathless,
directed by the New Wave's en
fant terrible, Jean-Luc Godard, is
still electrifying. It is a story of a
French gangster (played by Jean-
Pdul Belmondo) who worships
Bogart; his moll is played by lean
Seaberg. The film's technique,
with itsoutrageousjumpcutsand
jagged editing patterns, is dazzl
ing.

Gallipoli **'/2
Fine Arts, Palo Alio
For the first hourand a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
c,L>//i, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Bovd,
the it's a bloodless
movie.

Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on an
Australian field trip. The date is
Valentine's Day, 1900, and
change is in the air; the girls are
entering adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to enter the
less genteel world of the 20th

a rite of passage that obscures its

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alio Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood; Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion ot the
tiody Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its enter. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

All That Jazz ★**
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled ex
amination of his own life and
near-death is the kind of self-in
dulgent mistake that seems
doomed to fail. But Fosse's too
damned talented for that result;
frustratingly, the movie fluc
tuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant. It's hard to think of
something more self-conscious
than a huge dance number about
your own open-heart surgery,
and the show-bi/ schmaltziness
that Fosse stuffs the sequence
with borders on self-parody.
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the
start with this movie — but he
took it to the limit anyway.
Roy Scheider stars. Starts next
Thursday.

Tess *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Ash'eton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa

Rich and Famous
Hijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

how tough life can be for an ill

robber who gets caught because
the tellers can't decipher his
handwriting. The movie's a mess,
but style doesn't seem to be what
Allen was after at this point in his
career. It's also a very funny mess,
which goes a long way toward re

then wife, Louise Lasser, co-stars.

Not a great movie, but often

the title role, plays a wealthy alco

Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an ac tress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and

Peter O'Toole gives an im

Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four

change is in the air; the girls are
entering adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to enter the

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alio Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood; Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion ot the
tiody Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its enter. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

All That Jazz ★**
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled ex
amination of his own life and
near-death is the kind of self-in
dulgent mistake that seems
doomed to fail. But Fosse's too
damned talented for that result;
frustratingly, the movie fluc
tuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant. It's hard to think of
something more self-conscious
than a huge dance number about
your own open-heart surgery,
and the show-bi/ schmaltziness
that Fosse stuffs the sequence
with borders on self-parody.
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the
start with this movie — but he
took it to the limit anyway.
Roy Scheider stars. Starts next
Thursday.

Tess *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Ash'eton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa

employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a

Rich and Famous
Hijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

Woody Allen directed, sloppi

how tough life can be for an ill
mannered, insecure, little bank
robber who gets caught because
the tellers can't decipher his
handwriting. The movie's a mess,
but style doesn't seem to be what
Allen was after at this point in his
career. It's also a very funny mess,
which goes a long way toward re
deeming its weaknesses. Allen's
then wife, Louise Lasser, co-stars.

A National Guard unit has
been sent into the Louisiana

Walter Hill's exciting movie
about the causes and conse

Arthur
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies thut were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who fails in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an ac tress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

In the early '60s, the films of
the French New Wave shattered

Ironically most New Wave films
now seem friendly and familiar —
audiences have become as ac
customed to the new rules as they
were to the old. But Breathless,
directed by the New Wave's en
fant terrible, Jean-Luc Godard, is
still electrifying. It is a story of a
French gangster (played by Jean-

Bogart; his moll is played by lean
Seaberg. The film's technique,

David Thompson has written
that musicals have always been

bandwagon fits his description
perfectly: it offers pure pleasure,

stars as a hoofer who returns to

play looks great, until the direc
tor (played splendidly by the Brit

dec ides to turn it into a modern

while there may not be the elec

refined horseplay is just as much

tunnier scene on film than Tracy,
as a rough-edged sportswriter,
trying to convince Hepburn's
prissy male secretary that he can
read a Chinese newspaper. Un
fortunately, the movie is
burdened with a pedestrian

Fine Arts, Palo Alio
For the first hourand a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
c,L>//i, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled ex
amination of his own life and
near-death is the kind of self-in
dulgent mistake that seems
doomed to fail. But Fosse's too
damned talented for that result;
frustratingly, the movie fluc
tuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant. It's hard to think of
something more self-conscious
than a huge dance number about
your own open-heart surgery,
and the show-bi/ schmaltziness
that Fosse stuffs the sequence
with borders on self-parody.
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the
start with this movie — but he
took it to the limit anyway.
Roy Scheider stars. Starts next
Thursday.

Tess *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Ash'eton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens c haracter.

Rich and Famous
Hijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

Woody Allen directed, sloppi

how tough life can be for an ill

robber who gets caught because
the tellers can't decipher his
handwriting. The movie's a mess,
but style doesn't seem to be what
Allen was after at this point in his

which goes a long way toward re

then wife, Louise Lasser, co-stars.

A National Guard unit has

Walter Hill's exciting movie

Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies thut were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who fails in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an ac tress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Breathless ****
Tuesday, Bishop Auditorium
In the early '60s, the films of
the French New Wave shattered
every rule ot classical filmmaking.
Ironically most New Wave films
now seem friendly and familiar —
audiences have become as ac
customed to the new rules as they
were to the old. But Breathless,
directed by the New Wave's en
fant terrible, Jean-Luc Godard, is
still electrifying. It is a story of a
French gangster (played by Jean-
Pdul Belmondo) who worships
Bogart; his moll is played by lean
Seaberg. The film's technique,

David Thompson has written
that musicals have always been
critically suspect because they

than any other film genre. The
bandwagon fits his description
perfectly: it offers pure pleasure,
beginning to end. Fred Astaire
stars as a hoofer who returns to
New York to star in a play after his
Hollywood career falters. The
play looks great, until the direc
tor (played splendidly by the Brit

dec ides to turn it into a modern

with damnation scene. Cyd Char

This 1941 film was the first in
which Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy worked together;
while there may not be the elec
tricity of Bogart and Baca 11 in To
Have and Have Not, their more
refined horseplay is just as much
of a joy to watch. Tracy, especial
ly, is at his prime — there is no
tunnier scene on film than Tracy,
as a rough-edged sportswriter,
trying to convince Hepburn's
prissy male secretary that he can
read a Chinese newspaper. Un
fortunately, the movie is
burdened with a pedestrian
screenplay — Hepburn was past
Donald Ogden Stewart and

For the first hourand a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
c,L>//i, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex

took it to the limit anyway.
Roy Scheider stars. Starts next

Tess *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less the
same, but the soul of the work is
gone. The ultimate responsibility
for this film's failure rests with di
rector Roman Polanski. Unable
to render any real, cinematic in
terpretation of the novel, he con
tents himself with dramatizing its
"big moments." What he forgot
to do, or what he was afraid to at
tempt, was to offer any reason
(Geoffrey Unsworth's polished
"epic" photography isn't
enough) for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and re
reading the book.
Tess' centerpiece is Natassia
Kinski. Looking at her, one can
almost believe that she could,
without in the least intending to,
drive men to do terrible deeds.
But her performance is weak and
shapeless, and, underneath her
much-touted Cornish accent, lies
another one that sounds as if it
drifted in off the banks of the
Rhine.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Ash'eton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens c haracter.

Rich and Famous
Hijou, Palo Alto
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
always beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

Take the Money and Run
Saturday Cuhherlev
Woody Allen directed, sloppi
ly, this ill-mannered, insecure, lit
tle runt of a movie. It's all about
how tough life can be for an ill
mannered, insecure, little bank
robber who gets caught because
the tellers can't decipher his
handwriting. The movie's a mess,
but style doesn't seem to be what
Allen was after at this point in his
career. It's also a very funny mess,
which goes a long way toward re
deeming its weaknesses. Allen's
then wife, Louise Lasser, co-stars.

Southern Comfort ****
Old Mill, Mountain View
A National Guard unit has
been sent into the Louisiana
swamps on war games; they steal
some canoes, shoot a volley of
blanks at a couple of Cajuns as a
joke, and real violence erupts.
Walter Hill's exciting movie
about the causes and conse
quences of violence has a
broader focus than one might ex
pect, and a consistently am
bivalent point of view of the Ca
juns who entrap the guardsmen;
it's a movie that expands in ret
rospect. Keith Carradine, I K.
Carter, Lewis Smith and Les Lan
nom contribute interesting per
formances.

Arthur
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies thut were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who fails in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an ac tress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Breathless ****
Tuesday, Bishop Auditorium
In the early '60s, the films of
the French New Wave shattered
every rule ot classical filmmaking.
Ironically most New Wave films
now seem friendly and familiar —
audiences have become as ac
customed to the new rules as they
were to the old. But Breathless,
directed by the New Wave's en
fant terrible, Jean-Luc Godard, is
still electrifying. It is a story of a
French gangster (played by Jean-
Pdul Belmondo) who worships
Bogart; his moll is played by lean
Seaberg. The film's technique,
with itsoutrageousjumpcutsand
jagged editing patterns, is dazzl
ing.

The Sting *
I onight, C uhberley
When Paul Newman arid Rob
ert Redford first teamed, in Butch
Cjnidy jnd the Sundance Kid,
they didn't exactly create fire
works — except at the box office,
so four years later they repeated
their buddy-buddy schtick in this
slick, visually claustrophobic
Academy Award winner,
directed by George Roy Hill. The
gimmicky script is by David S.
Ward and the photography is by
Seal—a—Meal.
