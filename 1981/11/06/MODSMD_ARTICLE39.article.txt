USSR sub weapons claimed
Stockholm — A Soviet submarine that ran
aground 10 days ago in a restricted military zone
on the southern coast of Sweden is carrying nu
clear weapons, the Swedish government
charged yesterday.
In a strongly worded protest note handed to
the Soviet ambassador here, the government
said that after an investigation, it had concluded
"with dismay and indignation" that the sub
marine "probably has one or more nuclear
weapons aboard."
The submarine's captain refused to allow
Swedish military investigators to inspect its tor
pedo bays. But Swedish officials said evidence,
including radiation scans of the submarine's ex
posed hull while it was stranded on submerged
rocks, unmistakably indicated the presence of
nuclear weapons.
Dismissing Soviet claims that "faulty naviga
tion" caused the submarine to stray into a nar
row, rocky channel of shallow water among off
shore islands near several sensitive Swedish mil
itary installations, the Swedish government said
it also had concluded that "the Soviet sub
marine intentionally violated Swedish territory
for the purpose of carrying on illegal activities."
Haig-Allen dispute cools
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
summoned Secretary of State Alexander Haig
and national security adviser Richard Allen to
the Oval Office yesterday in his most direct per
sonal effort to end the feuding between Haig
and senior White House advisers.
The three men spent an hour discussing the
bickering and tensions that hit a new level
earlier this week when Haig publicly declared
that an unnamed White House adviser was run
ning a "guerrilla campaign" to undermine him.
Reagan made clear his displeasure over the
discord, which he has said is destructive to his
foreign policy, but he also gave Haig and Allen
new words of support. "The president also reaf
firmed his strong confidence in them and in his
entire foreign policy team," according to a
White House-approved account of the meeting
made public.
"The president told them that he wanted to
ensure that the matter of the past two days is
closed. He also discussed with them ways to
make the foreign policy apparatus of the gov
ernment work better and ways to stop any in
ternal criticisms," according to the official ac
count.
Nuclear warning considered
Washington — The Reagan administration
said late yesterday that a possible nuclear warn
ing shot in the event of war in Europe has been

consideredasa NATOoption — but always with
"significant doubts" that it ever would be done.
With that statement, prepared at the Pen
tagon and issued simultaneously at the White
House and State Department, the adminis
tration attempted to resolve a contradiction in
congressional testimony by Secretary of State
Alexander Haig and Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger.
Haig said Wednesday that "demonstrative
use" of a nuclear weapon was a NATO cont
ingency plan should conventional war break
out in Europe. But Weinberger testified yester
day that he knew of "absolutely nothing in any
plan that even remotely resembles that."
The administration's statement pronounced
both men correct. But it also changed the word
ing of what each had said on Capitol Hill.
Haig told the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee Wednesday that N ATO had such a "con
tingency plan," but Weinberger told the Senate
Armed Services Committee that such a plan
didn't exist, even though such a "suggestion"
was made "in the 605."
New shuttle delay possible
Cape Canaveral, Florida — The oft-delayed
second flight of the spaceshuttle Columbia.may
have to be put off for two weeks instead of one,
which will force fresh delays on its third test
flight next year.
Technicians at the Kennedy Space Center
yesterday afternoon were due to start the labo
rious'process of removing the three auxiliary
power units that drive Columbia's hydraulic
lines, two of which have clogged oil filters that
forced postponement of Wednesday's flight of
astronauts Joe Henry and Richard Truly. De
pending on what engineers find when the
power units are removed, the flight will be
rescheduled for the middle of next week or the
week after.
"If we have to replace the power units with
fresh ones we're not talking next week, we're
talking the following week," Shuttle Opera
tions Director George Page said today at the
Kennedy Space Center.
Postponed twice from its original launch date
of Sept. 30, the second flight of Columbia was
called off Wednesday morning when two filters
feeding lubricating oil to the power units for
the shuttle's hydraulics jammed in the final mo
ments of the countdown
Human rights policy extended
Washington — The State Department has
adopted a new policy on human rights abroad
that emphasizes opposition to abuses in the So
viet bloc but does not ignore abuses by friendly
nations, official sources said yesterday.

The policy, set out in a memorandum Oct. 27
by Deputy Secretary of State William Clark and
Undersecretary of State Richard Kennedy, rec
ognizes that a viable effort "means trouble" be
cause it requires "hard choices which may ad
versely affect certain bilateral relations."
The memorandum, published yesterday in
The New York Times, said: "... At the very
least, we will have to speak honestly about our
friends' human rights violations and justify any
decision wherein other considerations (eco
nomic, military, etc.) are determinative. There is
no escaping this without destroying the
credibility of our policy, for otherwise we
would be simply coddling friends and criticiz
ing foes."
Poles optimistic about future
Warsaw, Poland — The leader of Poland's in
dependent Solidarity trade union, Lech Walesa,
voiced guarded optimism yesterday about the
outcome of planned negotiations with the
communist authorities.
The Solidarity chairman was reporting to the
union's national executive council in Gdansk
on the results of his summit Wednesday with
the Communist Party leader, General Wojciech
Jaruzelski, and the Roman Catholic primate of
Poland, Archbishop jozef Glemp. The three
men discussed the possibility of forming a new
consultative body to help overcome Poland's
economic and political problems.
A similar expression of optimism about Po
land's future came from Archbishop Glemp on
his arrival in Rome, where he is expected to
have talks with the Polish-born pontiff, John
Paul 11. He told newsmen at Rome Airport that,
as a result of Wednesday's meeting, he was now
more hopeful of finding a peaceful solution to
the crisis.
