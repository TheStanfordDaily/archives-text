Happy times . . .
As part of a continuing series of ther
apeutic services, The Daily offers its
staffers yet another opportunity to
put a pleasant glow on the end of the
week and more alcohol than can be
consumed at one time. Writers, pho
tographers, production staff, ad peo
ple and even editors â€” take this as a
challenge. Party. 4:30 today.

Football
Take that hangover garnered from
the above happy hour and any other
Friday activities onto Roble Field by
11:00 tomorrow to play football
against the ASSU. This may be your
only chance to perpetrate minor acts
of violence legitimately against your
favorite senator(s). Arrive early to
learn the rules of the game .
