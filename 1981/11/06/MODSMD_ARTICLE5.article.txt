# Foreign undergraduate enrollment up
## 
### Todd Pickett 
An unprecedented increase in the number of
foreign students here this year has boosted the to
tal number to 1967, the highest since foreign stu
dents began attending the University 40 years ago,
according to an annual report by the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
While the percentage increase in graduate stu
dents admitted was somewhat higher than past
years, the admission of undergraduates jumped 40
percent from last year's total, according to the re
port.
Of the overall number, 256 foreign students are
undergraduates while graduate students number
1483, more than 26 percent of Stanford's graduate
population.
The sharp increase in foreign undergraduates
admitted corresponds directly to a similar increase
in the number of applications received from over
seas, said acting Dean of Admissions John Bunnell.
In addition, seven percent more of the applicants

than last year accepted their admission to Stanford,
said Bunnell.
More than half of the foreign students enroll in
the School of Engineering, while the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, the Business School and the
School of Education, attract most of the remaining
graduate students.
Prof. Sullivan Marsden of the department of pe
troleum engineering, which boasts a high per
centage of foreign students, attributed the ever
growing number of foreign students in the field to
a worldwide need for petroleum engineers.
In addition, until recently, only U.S. universities
had the necessary knowledge and facilities to
educate the world's petroleum engineers, said
Marsden. In the past few years the department has
received a steady flow of applications from Saudi
Arabia, he added.
The department of aeronautics and astronautics
here attracts a consistent flow of foreign graduate
students probably due to the mounting interest in

the field from nations all over the world, said one
source in the department. Although U.S. financial
grants to study aeronautics are rarely awarded to
foreign students, many countries such as France,
Israel and Japan send students to obtain advanced
degrees.
Of the engineering departments, electrical en
gineering contains the most foreign students, 209.
The pioneering of management skills by the
United States has drawn a steady number of for
eigners, in particular students from the United
Kingdom, to the Business School, said Lee Ziegler,
director of the Bechtel Center.
Before applying to Stanford's graduate depart
ments, foreign students must complete the Gradu
ate Record Examinations as well as the Test of Eng
lish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) if English is not
their primary language, said Ann Fletcher of grad
uate admissions. The results of these tests along
with an evaluation of the students' scores in their
111 a a _ l l
merous University publications, and
Goheen believes that complaints to
his office "often reflect the need to
discuss a troublesome situation with
someone entirely apart from the is
sue concerned."
If suspicions of a violation arise,
faculty or students should contact
the University Counsel, John
Schwartz, Goheen said. Schwartz will
then decide whether or not to press
charges.
This is a difficult task, and if a stu
dent merely reported the issue to the
instructor, the "third-party responsi
bility" would be fulfilled, according
to Goheen. In his report, Goheen
suggests that the President Donald
Kennedy's Honor Code Commission
look into the differences between
expected and actual behavior regard

ing student responsibility in thiscase.
Further complaints received by
Goheen stemmed from financial aid
related problems, which showed a 50
percent increase in cases over last
year. The main problems were delays
in aid applications and insensitivity to
problems. These have all been re
solved, he said.
Poor communication within the
hierarchy of the University has been
a big complaint of personnel and ac
ademic staff. As a reply to discontent
and low morale, a task force has been
organized to look into personnel pol
icies and procedures. Furthermore, a
committee on Academic Staff Affairs
is being established by Kennedy to
cover the morale problems among li
brarians and lecturers.
One of the most difficult problems
faced by the ombudsman, however,

is sexual harassment. According to
Goheen, the number of cases re
ported increased to 17 last year and
"may be due to the general public at
tention to the matter and to the new
University policy issued last January.
That was its intent."
Said Goheen, "Sexual harassment
is a very general term" and is defined
in the new policy as: "repeated and
unwanted sexual behavior, such as
physical contact and verbal com
ments or suggestions, which adverse
ly affect the working or learning en
vironment."
The ombudsman must respond to
any complaints and must try to re
solve them using either an informal
procedure or one of the University's
Formal Grievance procedures, de
pending on the case.

According to Goheen, the hardest
thing about dealing with sexual
harassment is that careers can be at
stake. As a result, each case must be
scrutinized as to its validity, and the
student must agree to be identified
to the accused.
The Office of the Ombudsman is
not just a complaint department. Dis
cussions are often based on sugges
tions rather than problems. These
suggestions are then referred to the
related people without involving the
complainant. In order to get any
thing accomplished, however, a rap
port must exist between members of
the university community and
Goheen. The ombudsman said he is
happy that such a necessary coopera
tion exists: "There is a sense of in
terest of this office in making the
place better, if we can."

any complaints and must try to re
solve them using either an informal
procedure or one of the University's
Formal Grievance procedures, de
pending on the case.

According to Goheen, the hardest
thing about dealing with sexual
harassment is that careers can be at
stake. As a result, each case must be
scrutinized as to its validity, and the
student must agree to be identified
to the accused.
The Office of the Ombudsman is
not just a complaint department. Dis
cussions are often based on sugges
tions rather than problems. These
suggestions are then referred to the
related people without involving the
complainant. In order to get any
thing accomplished, however, a rap
port must exist between members of
the university community and
Goheen. The ombudsman said he is
happy that such a necessary coopera
tion exists: "There is a sense of in
terest of this office in making the
place better, if we can."
An unprecedented increase in the number of
foreign students here this year has boosted the to
tal number to 1967, the highest since foreign stu
dents began attending the University 40 years ago,
according to an annual report by the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
While the percentage increase in graduate stu
dents admitted was somewhat higher than past
years, the admission of undergraduates jumped 40
percent from last year's total, according to the re
port.
Of the overall number, 256 foreign students are
undergraduates while graduate students number
1483, more than 26 percent of Stanford's graduate
population.
The sharp increase in foreign undergraduates
admitted corresponds directly to a similar increase
in the number of applications received from over
seas, said acting Dean of Admissions John Bunnell.
In addition, seven percent more of the applicants

than last year accepted their admission to Stanford,
said Bunnell.
More than half of the foreign students enroll in
the School of Engineering, while the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, the Business School and the
School of Education, attract most of the remaining
graduate students.
Prof. Sullivan Marsden of the department of pe
troleum engineering, which boasts a high per
centage of foreign students, attributed the ever
growing number of foreign students in the field to
a worldwide need for petroleum engineers.
In addition, until recently, only U.S. universities
had the necessary knowledge and facilities to
educate the world's petroleum engineers, said
Marsden. In the past few years the department has
received a steady flow of applications from Saudi
Arabia, he added.
The department of aeronautics and astronautics
here attracts a consistent flow of foreign graduate
students probably due to the mounting interest in

the field from nations all over the world, said one
source in the department. Although U.S. financial
grants to study aeronautics are rarely awarded to
foreign students, many countries such as France,
Israel and Japan send students to obtain advanced
degrees.
Of the engineering departments, electrical en
gineering contains the most foreign students, 209.
The pioneering of management skills by the
United States has drawn a steady number of for
eigners, in particular students from the United
Kingdom, to the Business School, said Lee Ziegler,
director of the Bechtel Center.
Before applying to Stanford's graduate depart
ments, foreign students must complete the Gradu
ate Record Examinations as well as the Test of Eng
lish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) if English is not
their primary language, said Ann Fletcher of grad
uate admissions. The results of these tests along
with an evaluation of the students' scores in their
111 a a _ l l
merous University publications, and
Goheen believes that complaints to
his office "often reflect the need to
discuss a troublesome situation with
someone entirely apart from the is
sue concerned."
If suspicions of a violation arise,
faculty or students should contact
the University Counsel, John
Schwartz, Goheen said. Schwartz will
then decide whether or not to press
charges.
This is a difficult task, and if a stu
dent merely reported the issue to the
instructor, the "third-party responsi
bility" would be fulfilled, according
to Goheen. In his report, Goheen
suggests that the President Donald
Kennedy's Honor Code Commission
look into the differences between
expected and actual behavior regard

ing student responsibility in thiscase.
Further complaints received by
Goheen stemmed from financial aid
related problems, which showed a 50
percent increase in cases over last
year. The main problems were delays
in aid applications and insensitivity to
problems. These have all been re
solved, he said.
Poor communication within the
hierarchy of the University has been
a big complaint of personnel and ac
ademic staff. As a reply to discontent
and low morale, a task force has been
organized to look into personnel pol
icies and procedures. Furthermore, a
committee on Academic Staff Affairs
is being established by Kennedy to
cover the morale problems among li
brarians and lecturers.
One of the most difficult problems
faced by the ombudsman, however,

is sexual harassment. According to
Goheen, the number of cases re
ported increased to 17 last year and
"may be due to the general public at
tention to the matter and to the new
University policy issued last January.
That was its intent."
Said Goheen, "Sexual harassment
is a very general term" and is defined
in the new policy as: "repeated and
unwanted sexual behavior, such as
physical contact and verbal com
ments or suggestions, which adverse
ly affect the working or learning en
vironment."
The ombudsman must respond to

solve them using either an informal
procedure or one of the University's
Formal Grievance procedures, de
