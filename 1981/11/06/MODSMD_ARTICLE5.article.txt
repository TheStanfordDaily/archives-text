# Foreign undergraduate enrollment up
## 
### Todd Pickett 
An unprecedented increase in the number of
foreign students here this year has boosted the to
tal number to 1967, the highest since foreign stu
dents began attending the University 40 years ago,
according to an annual report by the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
While the percentage increase in graduate stu
dents admitted was somewhat higher than past
years, the admission of undergraduates jumped 40
percent from last year's total, according to the re
port.
Of the overall number, 256 foreign students are
undergraduates while graduate students number
1483, more than 26 percent of Stanford's graduate
population.
The sharp increase in foreign undergraduates
admitted corresponds directly to a similar increase
in the number of applications received from over
seas, said acting Dean of Admissions John Bunnell.
In addition, seven percent more of the applicants

than last year accepted their admission to Stanford,
said Bunnell.
More than half of the foreign students enroll in
the School of Engineering, while the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, the Business School and the
School of Education, attract most of the remaining
graduate students.
Prof. Sullivan Marsden of the department of pe
troleum engineering, which boasts a high per
centage of foreign students, attributed the ever
growing number of foreign students in the field to
a worldwide need for petroleum engineers.
In addition, until recently, only U.S. universities
had the necessary knowledge and facilities to
educate the world's petroleum engineers, said
Marsden. In the past few years the department has
received a steady flow of applications from Saudi
Arabia, he added.
The department of aeronautics and astronautics
here attracts a consistent flow of foreign graduate
students probably due to the mounting interest in

the field from nations all over the world, said one
source in the department. Although U.S. financial
grants to study aeronautics are rarely awarded to
foreign students, many countries such as France,
Israel and Japan send students to obtain advanced
degrees.
Of the engineering departments, electrical en
gineering contains the most foreign students, 209.
The pioneering of management skills by the
United States has drawn a steady number of for
eigners, in particular students from the United
Kingdom, to the Business School, said Lee Ziegler,
director of the Bechtel Center.
Before applying to Stanford's graduate depart
ments, foreign students must complete the Gradu
ate Record Examinations as well as the Test of Eng
lish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) if English is not
their primary language, said Ann Fletcher of grad
uate admissions. The results of these tests along
with an evaluation of the students' scores in their
