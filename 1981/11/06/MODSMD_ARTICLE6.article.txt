# Professors deem Cancun meeting successful
## 
### Gordon Hecker 
Two weeks ago, 22 world leaders
met in Cancun, Mexico to discuss the
general topic of aid to the Third
World. When President Ronald Rea
gan returned from the conference,
he optimistically declared that the
Cancun meeting had been "extreme
ly constructive and positive."
Whether the leaders of the other
13 industrialized and eight develop
ing nations share Reagan's optimism
is still unclear.
Stanford political science Prof.
Robert Packenham and international
relations Prof. David Abernathy
agree that since world leaders and
analysts alike had few expectations
for tangible results, the conference
must be termed a success.
"It was just significant that they
even met together," said Pack
enham.
Prof. Stephen Krasner of the politi
cal science department differed with
his colleagues on the worth of the
conference. "Cancun was the last

gasp of the major universal nego
tiating process/' he declared. "It
showed no underlying consensus,
only underlying disagreement."
World leaders were equally at odds
regarding success of the conference.
French President Francois Mitterand
said, "I personally consider that we
have moved forward," while Pierre
Elliot Trudeau, prime minister of
Canada explained, "I would not say
this is a solid step forward." Trudeau
also declared, "We failed to get
agreement on exactly what the next
step would be."
The issue of what should be the
next step in the bargaining process is
perhaps the most contentious point
of all. Trudeau was rebuffed in his
proposal to convene global talks by
year's end.
Thus, no official follow-up meet
ings have been set. The general con
sensus, however, appears to be that
U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim will organize and convene
such talks in the coming months.

Since all decision- making power is
still held by the existing institutions
and not by the U.N., no solid
progress can be expected in the near
future.
Krasner said such negotiations will
take place, but will inevitably stall.
The solution to this stalemate will be
gin to surface once the North-South
rhetoriccoolsand both sidescometo
realistic terms with the true global sit
uation, he said.
The United States and the South,
he said, are presently finding com
munication difficult because the
United States is too concerned with
its image as a declining world power
and the South is too preoccupied
with the immediate acquisition of
money and power. Krasner ex
plained this communication gap with
the following analogy: "The North
wants to teach the South how to play
a better game of bridge, but the
South wants to play poker."
Abernathy agreed that further
progress will be hindered until cer

tain conditions are met. First, he said,
"any talk of income redistribution is
unlikely at a time of stagnating world
economies." As well as this basic eco
nomic argument, Abernathy con
tended that ideologically "the simple
North-South term is no longer valid."
The term South is a catch-all cate
gory which includes the oil rich
OPEC nations, the developing coun
tries such as Brazil and the so-called
"fourth world" low income coun
tries, he said. Reagan's policy of
"trade not aid" does not take these
divisions into account and would
serve to increase the economic gap
between the Third World and
"fourth world" countries.
As a possible solution, Abernathy
recommended the recycling of
OPEC oil profits into the "fourth
world" and, more importantly in the
long run, the development of an "in
ternational social coniract."
Under the terms of such a contract,
both the North and South would of
ti r concessions. The North could
perhaps offer to slow down its mili
tary expenditures while promising to
import more Third World goods. The
South, in turn, could begin to work
towards increased self-reliance in the
food sector and try to bring about a
more equitable distribution of
wealth within individual countries.
Such a social contract would repre
sent significant progress, but, warned
Abernathy, "don't expect it."
"The North-South ideology is due
for an overhaul" concured Prof.
Clark Reynolds of the Food Research
Institute. "With the industrialization
of the commodity and the labor mar
kets, there has become an organic in
terdependence" between the in
dustrialized and developing nations,
he said. To view today's world in a bi
polar manner would be an
anachronism. The North can no
longer afford to treat Third World
countries as simply a nuisance, oi to
treat them as pawns as was done dur
ing the cold war period.
The United States of today must
play the role which Virginia played

over 200 years ago, said Reynolds. If
"we pay conscious attention to the
basic values and self-evident truths
today, just like we did when we
founded this country" then perhaps,
the foundation will have been laid
for a truly significant North-South
dialogue, he said.
Before Reagan's departure for
Cancun, he spoke of "the goal that
motivates our effort â€” the en
hancement of human freedom and
economic opportunity." Following
his three days of talks in Cancun,
Reagan declared, "I return home re
minded of the importance of Ameri
can leadership in the world."
That the United States is playing a
leadership role in North-South rela
tions is not under contention. In the
wake of the Cancun conference the
central issues still under contention
arc: what the next step will bring,
how to redefine the ideological
terms North and South, and how to
deal with the impact of the increas
ingly diverse economic and social
c haracter of the South
How the American leaders plan to
cope with these issues remains to be
seen.

recommended the recycling of
OPEC oil profits into the "fourth
world" and, more importantly in the
long run, the development of an "in
ternational social coniract."
Under the terms of such a contract,
both the North and South would of
ti r concessions. The North could
perhaps offer to slow down its mili
tary expenditures while promising to
import more Third World goods. The
South, in turn, could begin to work
towards increased self-reliance in the
food sector and try to bring about a
more equitable distribution of
wealth within individual countries.
Such a social contract would repre
sent significant progress, but, warned
Abernathy, "don't expect it."
"The North-South ideology is due
for an overhaul" concured Prof.
Clark Reynolds of the Food Research
Institute. "With the industrialization
of the commodity and the labor mar
kets, there has become an organic in
terdependence" between the in
dustrialized and developing nations,
he said. To view today's world in a bi
polar manner would be an
anachronism. The North can no
longer afford to treat Third World
countries as simply a nuisance, oi to
treat them as pawns as was done dur
ing the cold war period.
The United States of today must
play the role which Virginia played

over 200 years ago, said Reynolds. If
"we pay conscious attention to the
basic values and self-evident truths
today, just like we did when we
founded this country" then perhaps,
the foundation will have been laid
for a truly significant North-South
dialogue, he said.
Before Reagan's departure for
Cancun, he spoke of "the goal that
motivates our effort â€” the en
hancement of human freedom and
economic opportunity." Following
his three days of talks in Cancun,
Reagan declared, "I return home re
minded of the importance of Ameri
can leadership in the world."
That the United States is playing a
leadership role in North-South rela
tions is not under contention. In the
wake of the Cancun conference the
central issues still under contention
arc: what the next step will bring,
how to redefine the ideological
terms North and South, and how to
deal with the impact of the increas
ingly diverse economic and social
c haracter of the South
How the American leaders plan to
cope with these issues remains to be
seen.
Two weeks ago, 22 world leaders
met in Cancun, Mexico to discuss the
general topic of aid to the Third
World. When President Ronald Rea
gan returned from the conference,
he optimistically declared that the
Cancun meeting had been "extreme
ly constructive and positive."
Whether the leaders of the other
13 industrialized and eight develop
ing nations share Reagan's optimism
is still unclear.
Stanford political science Prof.
Robert Packenham and international
relations Prof. David Abernathy
agree that since world leaders and
analysts alike had few expectations
for tangible results, the conference
must be termed a success.
"It was just significant that they
even met together," said Pack
enham.
Prof. Stephen Krasner of the politi
cal science department differed with
his colleagues on the worth of the
conference. "Cancun was the last

gasp of the major universal nego
tiating process/' he declared. "It
showed no underlying consensus,
only underlying disagreement."
World leaders were equally at odds
regarding success of the conference.
French President Francois Mitterand
said, "I personally consider that we
have moved forward," while Pierre
Elliot Trudeau, prime minister of
Canada explained, "I would not say
this is a solid step forward." Trudeau
also declared, "We failed to get
agreement on exactly what the next
step would be."
The issue of what should be the
next step in the bargaining process is
perhaps the most contentious point
of all. Trudeau was rebuffed in his
proposal to convene global talks by
year's end.
Thus, no official follow-up meet
ings have been set. The general con
sensus, however, appears to be that
U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim will organize and convene
such talks in the coming months.

Since all decision- making power is
still held by the existing institutions
and not by the U.N., no solid
progress can be expected in the near
future.
Krasner said such negotiations will
take place, but will inevitably stall.
The solution to this stalemate will be
gin to surface once the North-South
rhetoriccoolsand both sidescometo
realistic terms with the true global sit
uation, he said.
The United States and the South,
he said, are presently finding com
munication difficult because the
United States is too concerned with
its image as a declining world power
and the South is too preoccupied
with the immediate acquisition of
money and power. Krasner ex
plained this communication gap with
the following analogy: "The North
wants to teach the South how to play
a better game of bridge, but the
South wants to play poker."
Abernathy agreed that further
progress will be hindered until cer

tain conditions are met. First, he said,
"any talk of income redistribution is
unlikely at a time of stagnating world
economies." As well as this basic eco
nomic argument, Abernathy con
tended that ideologically "the simple
North-South term is no longer valid."
The term South is a catch-all cate
gory which includes the oil rich
OPEC nations, the developing coun
tries such as Brazil and the so-called
"fourth world" low income coun
tries, he said. Reagan's policy of
"trade not aid" does not take these
divisions into account and would
serve to increase the economic gap
between the Third World and
"fourth world" countries.
