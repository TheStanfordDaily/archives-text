# Jane's frightful finish — was it suicide?

(Third of three parts)
(In part two of our saga, the questionable nature
of Mrs. Jane Stanford's untimely death, which
seemed to be an obvious case of murder, was ex
amined. It was deduced that Bertha Berner, a long
time personal servant of Mrs. Stanford, was the top
suspect in the possible murder. Today: We take a
final look at Berner and . . . one final possibility.)
Bertha Berner was Mrs. Stanford's secretary for
21 years, during which time the two women be
came close. But Mrs. Stanford became increasingly
senile during her last three or four years, develop
ing whims and idiosyncracies which made her
more difficult to live with.
"Mrs. Stanford aged rapidly and became more
and more exacting," said the San Francisco
'Chronicle.
During these years, Berner tried to leave the old
woman's service several times, succeeding once or
twice. But Charles Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's
brother, added to Berner's salary behind hissister's
back, and so persuaded the secretary to stay.
Did Berner, several years her mistress's junior,
resent having to live with an "exacting" old wom
an? Perhaps she escaped herobligations by hasten
ing her mistress's already impending death.
If it wasn't murder, then perhaps the poisoning
was an accident. The druggist who filled Mrs. Stan
ford's bottle of bicarbonate of soda might have
made a mistake and sold her a bottle of strychnine
instead.
But as he told the papers, "There is no possibility
of a mistake. I sold Mrs. Stanford bicarbonate of
soda and not strychnine, which it resembles.
Strychnine is kept in small bottles, properly
labeled, on the prescription shelf."
Mrs. Stanford kept no poison in her house, but
the Stanford stable stocked large amounts of com

mercial strychnine for killing rodents. The
strychnine found in the bottle in Honolulu was of a
commercial variety and not like the type sold in
drug stores, elaborated the druggist.
Another prevalent solution amidst the
gallimaufry of theories which vollied back and
forth in the papers was that Mrs. Stanford
poisoned herself.
The famous philanthropist had always been
strictly religious and in her later years she leaned
towards spiritualism. She was devoted entirely to
the memory of her son and husband and often
talked of joining them in the next life.
According to a writer for the New York Ameri
can magazine, Mrs. Stanford said she never sat
down to a meal without setting places for her boy
and his father because she knew that they were
there with her.
Within several days of her departure for Hawaii,
Mrs. Stanford wrote letters to her close friends
thanking them for various favors they had done
both for her and for the University.
Several hours before departing for Hawaii, she
wrote to her close friend May Hopkins, "I have
wanted to see you since my illness but I could not
bring my mind to let you come. I have had more
than a sickness — a troubled heart. I cannot tell
you what you will know when a few more weeks
have passed."
On the same day, she wrote to George Crothers,
"You know that I am going away under peculiar
circumstances, and I am not quite so sure of health
and life as heretofore. Death in a natural way
would not be a calamity for I have much and dearly
loved ones waiting for my advent there, but I am
startled and even horrified that any human beings
feel that they have been injured (totheextent that)
they desire to revenge themselves in a way so hero
ic as has happened."

Mrs. Stanford was exceedingly depressed during
the months before her death and she was
possessed with the memory of her family. Yet ac
cording to friends, she was in good spirits the day
she died. Perhaps her good spirits stemmed from a
knowledge that she was soon to be released from
her life of torment and sent to the land beyond.
Could this woman who rose from a nondescript
childhood to become one of the most wealthy and
powerful people of her time, and whose obdurate
stand against the government saved her school
from financial disaster, have gone to the stables
and put rat poisoning in her own bottle of soda?
Unfortunately, this complex mystery seems des
tined to remain unsolvable. Mrs. Stanford might
have died at the hand of a rapacious servant or by
her own hand. Berner might have performed a sort
of euthenasia to relieve both her mistress and
herself of the former's never-ending spiritual grief.
However, what stands out as clear amidst all this
speculation is that Jordan's successful efforts to
cover up any sensational notions of poisoning or
suicide were just that; efforts to cover up the glar
ing and more substantiated truth that Mrs. Stan
ford's abrupt end came about by unnatural means.
In light of the evidence presented above, this
writer, for one, does not believe Mrs. Stanford
died from munching on too much gingerbread
and chocolate, which some suggested was the case
after it was discovered that the woman did indeed
overeat on the afternoon of her death.
The catch to this whole story is that we may nev
er know what happened in room 120 of the Moana
Hotel in Waikiki. Just months after her death in
1906, the San Francisco earthquake and fire de
stroyed all records in the pharmacy where the
medicine was purchased, those kept by the Morse
detective agency, and any which the San Francisco
police had gathered.

ford's abrupt end came about by unnatural means.
In light of the evidence presented above, this
writer, for one, does not believe Mrs. Stanford
died from munching on too much gingerbread
and chocolate, which some suggested was the case
after it was discovered that the woman did indeed
overeat on the afternoon of her death.
The catch to this whole story is that we may nev
er know what happened in room 120 of the Moana
Hotel in Waikiki. Just months after her death in
1906, the San Francisco earthquake and fire de

medicine was purchased, those kept by the Morse
detective agency, and any which the San Francisco
police had gathered.


WHO DUNNIT? — |ane Stanford, posed here with little
Leland, could not forsee her painful death-or could she?
Yesterday we examined the evidence pointing to murder;
today we consider the possibility that her death was her
own decision.
(Third of three parts)
(In part two of our saga, the questionable nature
of Mrs. Jane Stanford's untimely death, which
seemed to be an obvious case of murder, was ex
amined. It was deduced that Bertha Berner, a long
time personal servant of Mrs. Stanford, was the top
suspect in the possible murder. Today: We take a
final look at Berner and . . . one final possibility.)
Bertha Berner was Mrs. Stanford's secretary for
21 years, during which time the two women be
came close. But Mrs. Stanford became increasingly
senile during her last three or four years, develop
ing whims and idiosyncracies which made her
more difficult to live with.
"Mrs. Stanford aged rapidly and became more
and more exacting," said the San Francisco
'Chronicle.
During these years, Berner tried to leave the old
woman's service several times, succeeding once or
twice. But Charles Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's
brother, added to Berner's salary behind hissister's
back, and so persuaded the secretary to stay.
Did Berner, several years her mistress's junior,
resent having to live with an "exacting" old wom
an? Perhaps she escaped herobligations by hasten
ing her mistress's already impending death.
If it wasn't murder, then perhaps the poisoning
was an accident. The druggist who filled Mrs. Stan
ford's bottle of bicarbonate of soda might have
made a mistake and sold her a bottle of strychnine
instead.
But as he told the papers, "There is no possibility
of a mistake. I sold Mrs. Stanford bicarbonate of
soda and not strychnine, which it resembles.
Strychnine is kept in small bottles, properly
labeled, on the prescription shelf."
Mrs. Stanford kept no poison in her house, but
the Stanford stable stocked large amounts of com

mercial strychnine for killing rodents. The
strychnine found in the bottle in Honolulu was of a
commercial variety and not like the type sold in
drug stores, elaborated the druggist.
Another prevalent solution amidst the
gallimaufry of theories which vollied back and
forth in the papers was that Mrs. Stanford
poisoned herself.
The famous philanthropist had always been
strictly religious and in her later years she leaned
towards spiritualism. She was devoted entirely to
the memory of her son and husband and often
talked of joining them in the next life.
According to a writer for the New York Ameri
can magazine, Mrs. Stanford said she never sat
down to a meal without setting places for her boy
and his father because she knew that they were
there with her.
Within several days of her departure for Hawaii,
Mrs. Stanford wrote letters to her close friends
thanking them for various favors they had done
both for her and for the University.
Several hours before departing for Hawaii, she
wrote to her close friend May Hopkins, "I have
wanted to see you since my illness but I could not
bring my mind to let you come. I have had more
than a sickness — a troubled heart. I cannot tell
you what you will know when a few more weeks
have passed."
On the same day, she wrote to George Crothers,
"You know that I am going away under peculiar
circumstances, and I am not quite so sure of health
and life as heretofore. Death in a natural way
would not be a calamity for I have much and dearly
loved ones waiting for my advent there, but I am
startled and even horrified that any human beings
feel that they have been injured (totheextent that)
they desire to revenge themselves in a way so hero
ic as has happened."

Mrs. Stanford was exceedingly depressed during
the months before her death and she was
possessed with the memory of her family. Yet ac
cording to friends, she was in good spirits the day
she died. Perhaps her good spirits stemmed from a
knowledge that she was soon to be released from
her life of torment and sent to the land beyond.
Could this woman who rose from a nondescript
childhood to become one of the most wealthy and
powerful people of her time, and whose obdurate
stand against the government saved her school
from financial disaster, have gone to the stables
and put rat poisoning in her own bottle of soda?
Unfortunately, this complex mystery seems des
tined to remain unsolvable. Mrs. Stanford might
have died at the hand of a rapacious servant or by
her own hand. Berner might have performed a sort
of euthenasia to relieve both her mistress and
herself of the former's never-ending spiritual grief.
However, what stands out as clear amidst all this
speculation is that Jordan's successful efforts to
cover up any sensational notions of poisoning or
suicide were just that; efforts to cover up the glar
ing and more substantiated truth that Mrs. Stan
ford's abrupt end came about by unnatural means.
