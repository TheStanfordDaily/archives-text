## 'Queen's Speech' in Britain calls for labor, wage controls 
### Los Angeles Times 
London — In her annual ad
dress to Parliament on
Wednesday, Queen Elizabeth
II outlined the Conservative
government's" legislative pro
gram, which includes a
crackdown on labor unions
and tight-fisted wage settle
ments.
Although it is called the
"Queen's Speech," and tradi
tionally opens a new session of
Parliament, the address was
written by members of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Cabinet.
The most important legisla
tive proposal is expected to be
a reform of the trade union
laws, and this could provoke
the most bitter battle of the ses
sion. However, the queen said
only that a bill "will be in
troduced on employment and
labor relations."
The final shape of the bill is
not expected to be worked out
for months, and only after con
sultations with the major
unions. But the general thrust
of the legislation, according to
government insiders, will be to
remove trade union im
munities from being sued for
the actions of individual mem
bers.
Union liability
The government also intends
to make unions and employers
alike liable for substantial civil
damages to people who can
prove that they have been un
fairly dismissed because of a
closed union shop.
Another change under con
sideration would allow em
ployers to fire strikers in some
instances without the risk of le
gal action.
The queen, reaffirming a
keystone of the Thatcher gov
ernment's policy, indicated

that there was no intention ot
changing course on economic
matters.
She said the government at
tached "the utmost im
portance to maintaining
progress in reducing inflation
by the pursuit of firm monetary
and fiscal policies, to further
improving the efficiency of the
economy, and to strengthen
ing industry, so as to reassert
competitiveness abroad and
prosperity at home."
The government, she said,
hoped "to see this assisted by
further reductions in the level
of wage settlements."
In the aftermath of the auto
workers' decision to call off
their strike at British Levland

The government attaches 'utmost
importance to maintaining
progress in reducing inflation by
the pursuit ot firm monetary and
fiscal policies. . . and to
strengthening industry so as to
reassert competitiveness abroad
and stability at home/

and return to work Wednes
day, the Cabinet is said to be re
inforced in its belief that there
is a growing sense of public re
alism that higher pay increases
can only mean fewer jobs.
The queen also said the gov
ernment will introduce legisla
tion to curb municipal spend
ing throughout Britain by in
sisting that taxes above a cer
tain level be approved not by

city councils alone but by the
people in referendum. This is
believed to be aimed at city
halls controlled by the Labor
Party.
The queen also announced
the government's intention to
seek legislation that would shift
more nationalized industries to
the private sector.
Such legislation is expected
to include provisions for addi
tional private investment in
North Sea oil production, now
conducted by the nationalized
British National Oil Corp.
On the Irish question, the
government said it would seek,
in the queen's words, "accep
table ways of enabling the peo
ple of Northern Ireland to play

a fuller part in its adminis
tration," and that it would also
work for "improvements in the
security system."
The speech suggested that
the money squeeze in Britain
will continue and that there
could well be higher taxes next
year, a year that will determine
whether the conservative gov
ernment can survive the next
election.

tionally opens a new session of
Parliament, the address was
written by members of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Cabinet.
The most important legisla
tive proposal is expected to be
a reform of the trade union
laws, and this could provoke
the most bitter battle of the ses
sion. However, the queen said
only that a bill "will be in
troduced on employment and
labor relations."
The final shape of the bill is
not expected to be worked out
for months, and only after con
sultations with the major
unions. But the general thrust
of the legislation, according to
government insiders, will be to
remove trade union im
munities from being sued for
the actions of individual mem
bers.
Union liability
The government also intends
to make unions and employers
alike liable for substantial civil
damages to people who can
prove that they have been un
fairly dismissed because of a
closed union shop.
Another change under con
sideration would allow em
ployers to fire strikers in some
instances without the risk of le
gal action.
The queen, reaffirming a
keystone of the Thatcher gov
ernment's policy, indicated

that there was no intention ot
changing course on economic
matters.
She said the government at
tached "the utmost im
portance to maintaining
progress in reducing inflation
by the pursuit of firm monetary
and fiscal policies, to further
improving the efficiency of the
economy, and to strengthen
ing industry, so as to reassert
competitiveness abroad and
prosperity at home."
The government, she said,
hoped "to see this assisted by
further reductions in the level
of wage settlements."
In the aftermath of the auto
workers' decision to call off
their strike at British Levland

The government attaches 'utmost
importance to maintaining
progress in reducing inflation by
the pursuit ot firm monetary and
fiscal policies. . . and to
strengthening industry so as to
reassert competitiveness abroad
and stability at home/

and return to work Wednes
day, the Cabinet is said to be re
inforced in its belief that there
is a growing sense of public re
alism that higher pay increases
can only mean fewer jobs.
The queen also said the gov
ernment will introduce legisla
tion to curb municipal spend
ing throughout Britain by in
sisting that taxes above a cer
tain level be approved not by

city councils alone but by the
people in referendum. This is
believed to be aimed at city
halls controlled by the Labor
Party.
The queen also announced
the government's intention to
seek legislation that would shift
more nationalized industries to
the private sector.
Such legislation is expected
to include provisions for addi
tional private investment in
North Sea oil production, now
conducted by the nationalized
British National Oil Corp.
On the Irish question, the
government said it would seek,
in the queen's words, "accep
table ways of enabling the peo
ple of Northern Ireland to play

a fuller part in its adminis
tration," and that it would also
work for "improvements in the
security system."
The speech suggested that
the money squeeze in Britain
will continue and that there
could well be higher taxes next
year, a year that will determine
whether the conservative gov
ernment can survive the next
election.
