# Brezhnev interview wins European favor
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev appears to have seized diplomat
ic initiative in Europe through an interview
with a West German magazine last week
that, judging by Soviet commentaries, has
been greeted by praise not only here but
throughout Western Europe.
On one level, the interview with Der
Spiegel was an olive branch to Western Eu
rope. The Soviet leader for the first time
publicly talked about details of Soviet arms
strength, including the numbers of medi
um-range nuclear rockets aimed at the re
gion.
But in doing so, he presented his view of
East-West relations in a coherent and con
ciliatory form. He spoke almost sadly
about Washington's defense policies as
being responsible for the current tensions
and renewed Soviet offers to negotiate.
On a different level, however, Brezhnev
restated Soviet strategic doctrine in a way
apparently designed to disarm his critics,
not only in Western Europe but in the
United States.
Printed in USSR
The fact that the full text of his interview
was published in full in Pravda and all oth
er newspapers — and given the most
prominent front-page display — makes his
statements the most authoritative ex
pression of Soviet thinking on the eve of

the scheduled U.S.-Soviet arms limitation
talks later this month.
The focus of his interest was clearly
Western Europe, where he will travel in
two weeks for an official visit to Bonn.
The main issue worrying the Soviets is
the scheduled deployment in 1983 of 572
U.S. medium-range nuclear rockets in
Western Europe. Although it was West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt who
first proposed the deployment of such
weapons to counterbalance Sdviet forces,
the matter has since turned into a divisive
political dispute, particuarly in The Neth
erlands, Belgium and West Germany.
President Ronald Reagan's recent re
marks about the possibility of a limited nu
clear exchange have only increased Eu
ropean anxieties. The Soviets, in turn, have
sought to foster the notion that Europe
might become an unwilling victim of a nu
clear exchange.
Brezhnev skillfully sought to exploit
U.S.-European differences, apparently
trying to convince the Europeans that the
NATO deployment would not give them
any military gains but would increase mili
tary and political risks.
Against new weapons
The main thrust of his argument was that
the new mobile SS-20 Soviet missile is in
deed an advanced weapon but does not

represent a new threat. In contrast, the
proposed deployment of the U.S. missiles
represents an entirely new threat to the
Soviet Union, he argued. *'
At the moment, he insisted, theie exists
a "rough balance" between the Soviet
Union and the United States and other
NATO countries in medium-range weap
ons.
The Soviet Union, he continued, has 975
such weapons, compared to NATO's 986.
Britain has 64 missiles capable of reaching
targets in the Soviet Union and 55 medi
um-range bombers, France 144 such units
and the United States has more than 700,
including F-111, Fb-111, and F-4 aircraft
and submarine-based launchers.
Brezhnev argued that the "service life"
of Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 missiles has "ex
pired" and that "when deploying one new
SS-20 missile we replace one or two old
missiles and scrap the latter together with
launchers."
Denies Soviet edge
He rejected as "farfetched" charges
about Soviet superiority and said that if
U.S. medium-range rockets were
deployed in Western Europe NATO would
gain a "50 percent advantage" in the
number of nuclear launchers'and "almost
a 100 percent advantage" in nuclear
charges.
