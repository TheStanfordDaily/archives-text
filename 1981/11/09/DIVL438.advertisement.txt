WE GROW OUR OWN
MANAGERS
Our practice is to recruit the best people we can find, and provide
continual training on the job to prepare them for broader respon
sibilities. Treating each individual with consideration and respect,
and recognizing personal achievements, are the cornerstones of
our employee philosophy. It is this philosophy that has helped us
fuel our growth for the past 40 years.
From a small business founded in 1939, we've grown to a company of
65,000 people internationally. During the last decade, we grew at a
compounded annual rate of more than 21 %, with 1980 sales of $3.1
billion. During the next decade, we plan to hire about 18,000
graduating students. Large size and steady growth, though, have
not impeded HP's tradition of respect for its employees.
If you have abilities in any of the following fields, we currently have
hundreds of positions waiting for you!
electrical, mechanical, chemical, industrial, software de
velopment and computer engineering
integrated circuit technology
physics, chemistry, material science
electronic technology
mathematics, business administration, accounting and in
dustrial relations
We're excited about our future JOIN US!
