## Smuggled art recovered 
### Kathy Olmsted 
Two stolen art prints, valued at ap
proximately $15,000 were recovered
last Thursday — less than 24 hours af
ter they were taken from the Stan
ford Art Museum, Stanford police
have reported.
A Whistler etching and a Gaugin
woodcut were removed from their
frames and smuggled out of the
museum during regular visiting
hours last Wednesday afternoon, ac
cording to Raoul Niemeyer of the
Stanford police, who cited the quick
action of a San Francisco art dealer
for the rapid recovery of the prints.
Repeated attempts to contact Art
Museum Director Lorenz Eitnerand
obtain more details from the police
proved unsuccessful this weekend,
with nearly all museum personnel
uncooperative in releasing informa
tion on the theft.
However, Niemeyer told the Uni
versity News and Publications Service
on Friday that Ellis Franklin Jones, 33,
of Woodside, had been arrested in
connection with the thefts of
Whistler's "Billingsgate" (1859) and
Gaugin's "Human Misery" (1895).
San Francisco art dealer Alan
Wofsy provided a phone number to
Neimeyer and Santa Clara County
Sargeant Robert Pulling, which led to
Jones' arrest.
Wofsy reported that Jones con
tacted him on Tuesday and told him
that he could obtain a Whistler paint

ing titled "Street Scene in Chelsea."
Wofsy consulted a reference book
and fc nd that the painting was lo
cated at Stanford.
The art dealer then called
Niemeyer Thursday morning to ask if
the painting was still at the museum.
He was told that the painting was still
on the wall, but was not informed
about the missing prints.
Wofsy bought the prints from
Jones Thursday for $100 cash and a
$400 check. Wofsy was still suspicious
on Friday and called Stanford police
to ask if any art was missing. He was
told that the two prints were stolen;
he then gave police the phone
number that led to Jones' arrest.
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement here, said that the
museum's security system relies on
burglar alarms which are not ac
tivated during visiting hours. "Walk
ers" are charged with mingling
among the museum's visitors and
guarding against theft.
Beth said that the theft "raises
questions about whether more walk
ers are needed, or if the walkers need
more training."
Betsy Fryberger, curator of prints
and drawings, refused to comment
both on the security set-up at the
museum and on the theft itself.
Meanwhile at the museum yester
day, the volunteer docent on duty,
Grace Hesse, refused to show the
Daily from where the prints had been
taken, explaining that she had been

told not to release any information.
She would not reveal on whose or
ders she was acting.
Sgt. Philip Love of the Stanford Po
lice also refused to comment on the
nature of the museum's security. "It's
a security system, and to discuss it re
ally defeats the purpose of having it,"
he said.
Beth said that the museum has not
had any thefts for "at least five years."
The University is self-insured up to a
million dollars, so the theft raises no
insurance rate problems.
Wofsy criticized Stanford to the lo
cal press this weekend for not having
identifying marks on the prints. Stan
ford officials responded that marks
are not used because part of the col
lection is on loan.
Jones was apprehended at the San
Francisco home of Wendy Norrins,
34, who along with Patricia Anne Sul
livan, 23, was arrested on drug-re
lated charges.
According to Niemeyer, the two
women arrested along with Jones
had been seen acting suspiciously at
the museum last week. Possible links
between the theft at Stanford and
other art thefts in the San Francisco
area are being investigated, he said.
Jones apparently cut his finger
while slashing the prints out of their
frames. A small blood spot was found
on the Gaugin and a bloody exacto
knife was discovered in Jones' stolen
rental car, according to the police.

among the museum's visitors and
guarding against theft.
Beth said that the theft "raises
questions about whether more walk
ers are needed, or if the walkers need
more training."
Betsy Fryberger, curator of prints
and drawings, refused to comment
both on the security set-up at the
museum and on the theft itself.
Meanwhile at the museum yester
day, the volunteer docent on duty,
Grace Hesse, refused to show the
Daily from where the prints had been
taken, explaining that she had been

told not to release any information.
She would not reveal on whose or
ders she was acting.
Sgt. Philip Love of the Stanford Po
lice also refused to comment on the
nature of the museum's security. "It's
a security system, and to discuss it re
ally defeats the purpose of having it,"
he said.
Beth said that the museum has not
had any thefts for "at least five years."
The University is self-insured up to a
million dollars, so the theft raises no
insurance rate problems.
Wofsy criticized Stanford to the lo
cal press this weekend for not having
identifying marks on the prints. Stan
ford officials responded that marks
are not used because part of the col
lection is on loan.
Jones was apprehended at the San
Francisco home of Wendy Norrins,
34, who along with Patricia Anne Sul
livan, 23, was arrested on drug-re
lated charges.
According to Niemeyer, the two
women arrested along with Jones
had been seen acting suspiciously at
the museum last week. Possible links
between the theft at Stanford and
other art thefts in the San Francisco
area are being investigated, he said.
Jones apparently cut his finger
while slashing the prints out of their
frames. A small blood spot was found
on the Gaugin and a bloody exacto
knife was discovered in Jones' stolen
rental car, according to the police.

MISSING PAINTING — Stanford Art Gallery officials refused this weekend to disclose which of the
blank spots on the gallerv walls correspond to the stolen art works.
Two stolen art prints, valued at ap
proximately $15,000 were recovered
last Thursday — less than 24 hours af
ter they were taken from the Stan
ford Art Museum, Stanford police
have reported.
A Whistler etching and a Gaugin
woodcut were removed from their
frames and smuggled out of the
museum during regular visiting
hours last Wednesday afternoon, ac
cording to Raoul Niemeyer of the
Stanford police, who cited the quick
action of a San Francisco art dealer
for the rapid recovery of the prints.
Repeated attempts to contact Art
Museum Director Lorenz Eitnerand
obtain more details from the police
proved unsuccessful this weekend,
with nearly all museum personnel
uncooperative in releasing informa
tion on the theft.
However, Niemeyer told the Uni
versity News and Publications Service
on Friday that Ellis Franklin Jones, 33,
of Woodside, had been arrested in
connection with the thefts of
Whistler's "Billingsgate" (1859) and
Gaugin's "Human Misery" (1895).
San Francisco art dealer Alan
Wofsy provided a phone number to
Neimeyer and Santa Clara County
Sargeant Robert Pulling, which led to
Jones' arrest.
Wofsy reported that Jones con
tacted him on Tuesday and told him
that he could obtain a Whistler paint

ing titled "Street Scene in Chelsea."
Wofsy consulted a reference book
and fc nd that the painting was lo
cated at Stanford.
The art dealer then called
Niemeyer Thursday morning to ask if
the painting was still at the museum.
He was told that the painting was still
on the wall, but was not informed
about the missing prints.
Wofsy bought the prints from
Jones Thursday for $100 cash and a
$400 check. Wofsy was still suspicious
on Friday and called Stanford police
to ask if any art was missing. He was
told that the two prints were stolen;
he then gave police the phone
number that led to Jones' arrest.
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement here, said that the
museum's security system relies on
burglar alarms which are not ac
tivated during visiting hours. "Walk
ers" are charged with mingling
among the museum's visitors and
guarding against theft.
Beth said that the theft "raises
questions about whether more walk
ers are needed, or if the walkers need
more training."
Betsy Fryberger, curator of prints
and drawings, refused to comment
both on the security set-up at the
museum and on the theft itself.
