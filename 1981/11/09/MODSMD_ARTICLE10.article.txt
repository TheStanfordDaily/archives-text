# Swedes protest Soviet policy at embassy, irate at sub visit
## 
### 
Stockholm, Sweden (AP) — Four hundred
demonstrators, some carrying a cardboard sub
marine and posters mocking Kremlin proposals
for a nuclear-free Nordic zone, converged on
the Soviet Embassy in Stockholm on Saturday.
There was no response from embassy staffers
who were trying to celebrate the anniversary of
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
The embassy festivities were low-key, ap
parently because of embarrassment over the re
cent violation of neutral Sweden's territorial wa
ters by a Soviet submarine believed armed with
nuclear-tipped torpedoes.
There was a heavy snowfall and temperatures
dipped near freezing during the rally organized
by the East European Solidarity Committee and
several Baltic organizations, mostly made up of
anti-Moscow exiles from the Soviet bloc, and
the Swedish Liberal Party's youth wing.
Anti-nuclear weapons
Signs such as: "Keep on Sleeping, Europe, So
viet Missiles Will Wake Vou Up" and "No Soviet
Nuclear Subs in the Baltic" referred to the 10-
day stalemate which ended Friday when the So
viet sub that ran aground off the Karlskrona
naval base Oct. 27 was released.
Sweden said there was evidence the sub
marine's torpedoes were armed with nuclear
warheads and called the incident the worst vio
lation of its sovereignty since the end of World
War 11. Swedes said it raised new questions about
Soviet sincerity in proposing a nuclear-free zone

of the Nordic area and a public opinion survey
showed over a third of Swedes who responded
believe Sweden's defenses need to be
bolstered; but 49 percent believed they are still
adequate.
The conservative Svenska Dagbladet news
paper said: "For everyone with common sense
and elementary knowledge of military ami polit
ical realities in our part of the world it has long
been clear that sweeping communist talk about
the Baltic as the 'Sea of Peace' is nothing but
propaganda."
Douht Soviet talk
The liberal Expressed said: "... Our concep
tion about Sweden, Scandinavia and Europe
cannot remain what it used to be.... T lie Soviets'
activities force us to ask ourselves if the Soviet
Union really respects Swedish neutrality. For
Swedish opinion neutrality is something that ap
plies in any situation. Now the Soviet Union be
haves like it was a question of neutrality for the
time being, to be respected as long as it fits them
A poll by the Institute of Market Research
published in the liberal Dagens Nyheter on Sat
urday showed 37 percent of the respondents
saying Sweden needs a stronger defense, 49 per
cent saying present military capabilities aiu ade
quate, 7 percent supporting a reduction and 7
percent undecided. There was no immediate
comparison with public opinion on the subject
before the incident.
