## SAIO helps build sense of community for native Americans 
### Heather Millar 
Although the number of undergraduate
native Americans at Stanford has decreased
over the last decade, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) is nonetheless
expanding its social activities to include
educational projects as well.
Though the organization coordinates cul
tural exchanges in Roble Hall, the native
American priority house, SAIO is consider
ing establishing a small theme house. A
priority house provides cultural programs,
but does not emphasize these programs as
strongly as an independent theme house.
"There's a great sense of community this
year," said Angel Belindo, an assistant in the
native American program at Roble. "Last
year, the SAIO was pretty broken apart."
Belindo attributed last year's problem to a
lack of native Americans enrolled in the Uni

versity. In 1975, there were 75 native Ameri
can undergraduates enrolled at Stanford.
Today there are 36. "Our main priority is re
cruitment because there are so few native
American students here and there are many
more that are qualified to come," said Pat
Gomez, a member of SAIO's steering com
mittee.
According to Belindo, Stanford's failure to
offer programs focusing on native American
students contributes to the problem of re
duced native American enrollment. "There
is no Indian program here, no Indian faculty,
no Indian classes," said Tony Kahn, a mem
ber of the SAIO steering committee. Kahn is
presently teaching a course in Navajo lan
guage, through the University's Linguistics
Department, in an effort to rectify the situ
ation.
The SAIO is organizing an Indian Law class

to be offered winter quarter, which will cov
er early American relations with Indian na
tions.
George Clever, assistant dean of student
affairs and Mark Mancall, director of the ov
erseas studies program at Stanford are pres
ently trying to establish support for a "Stan
ford-on-the-Reservation" program, which
would establish a Stanford campus on an In
dian reservation. Clever said he hopes to see
a pilot program by the summer of 1982.
"The few students that have heard about
this (Stanford-in-the-Reservation) are hesi
tant," said Gomez, adding that the adminis
tration hasn't consulted students about the
program. He said he felt the program would
alienate the reservations by treating them as
foreign nations rather than as a part of Amer
ica as a whole.
The native American students at Stanford
come from all over the country, and though

many were raised in urban areas, most con
sider their home a tribal village or reserva
tion. "Even when we were back east, home
was always my dad's pueblo in New Mexi
co," said Julie Ortiz, a program assistant in
Roble.
"I wasn't brought up in a traditional life
style or even a village lifestyle, but I still
wanted to learn about my heritage," said
Julie Pierro, whose Eskimo mother died
when she was three.
The sense of community among American
Indians is very strong, Belindo said. But this
communal feeling does not always blend
well with the competitive environment that
Stanford imposes on students, she said.
"I did experience culture shock," said one
Apache student who grew up on the Jicarilla
Apache reservation in New Mexico. "My
problems deal; with a feeling of alienation —
the differences (between reservation and

University life) were so marked. Stanford did
virtually nothing to alleviate that. The sup
port services here (the Bridge, Cowell) are
not directed at native Americans."
For this reason, the SAIO does provide*,
peer counseling services in Roble to help the
students cope with adjusting to University
life.
Native American students may also ap
proach academics differently, according to
Clever, a former mathematics professor.
While most students approach math with a
linear mind-set, native American students'
spacial sense is more acute, he said.
"Being Indian is a way of life," said Kahn.
"It's a way of believing, of respecting the
earth. I guess anyone could be an Indian,
you just have to think like one."
"I feel different and I am different because
I think Indian," explained Belindo.

not directed at native Americans."
For this reason, the SAIO does provide*,
peer counseling services in Roble to help the
students cope with adjusting to University
life.
Native American students may also ap
proach academics differently, according to
Clever, a former mathematics professor.
While most students approach math with a
linear mind-set, native American students'
spacial sense is more acute, he said.
"Being Indian is a way of life," said Kahn.
"It's a way of believing, of respecting the
earth. I guess anyone could be an Indian,
you just have to think like one."
"I feel different and I am different because
I think Indian," explained Belindo.
Although the number of undergraduate
native Americans at Stanford has decreased
over the last decade, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) is nonetheless
expanding its social activities to include
educational projects as well.
Though the organization coordinates cul
tural exchanges in Roble Hall, the native
American priority house, SAIO is consider
ing establishing a small theme house. A
priority house provides cultural programs,
but does not emphasize these programs as
strongly as an independent theme house.
"There's a great sense of community this
year," said Angel Belindo, an assistant in the
native American program at Roble. "Last
year, the SAIO was pretty broken apart."
Belindo attributed last year's problem to a
lack of native Americans enrolled in the Uni

versity. In 1975, there were 75 native Ameri
can undergraduates enrolled at Stanford.
Today there are 36. "Our main priority is re
cruitment because there are so few native
American students here and there are many
more that are qualified to come," said Pat
Gomez, a member of SAIO's steering com
mittee.
According to Belindo, Stanford's failure to
offer programs focusing on native American
students contributes to the problem of re
duced native American enrollment. "There
is no Indian program here, no Indian faculty,
no Indian classes," said Tony Kahn, a mem
ber of the SAIO steering committee. Kahn is
presently teaching a course in Navajo lan
guage, through the University's Linguistics
Department, in an effort to rectify the situ
ation.
The SAIO is organizing an Indian Law class

to be offered winter quarter, which will cov
er early American relations with Indian na
tions.
George Clever, assistant dean of student
affairs and Mark Mancall, director of the ov
erseas studies program at Stanford are pres
ently trying to establish support for a "Stan
ford-on-the-Reservation" program, which
would establish a Stanford campus on an In
dian reservation. Clever said he hopes to see
a pilot program by the summer of 1982.
"The few students that have heard about
this (Stanford-in-the-Reservation) are hesi
tant," said Gomez, adding that the adminis
tration hasn't consulted students about the
program. He said he felt the program would
alienate the reservations by treating them as
foreign nations rather than as a part of Amer
ica as a whole.
The native American students at Stanford
come from all over the country, and though

many were raised in urban areas, most con
sider their home a tribal village or reserva
tion. "Even when we were back east, home
was always my dad's pueblo in New Mexi
co," said Julie Ortiz, a program assistant in
Roble.
"I wasn't brought up in a traditional life
style or even a village lifestyle, but I still
wanted to learn about my heritage," said
Julie Pierro, whose Eskimo mother died
when she was three.
The sense of community among American
Indians is very strong, Belindo said. But this
communal feeling does not always blend
well with the competitive environment that
Stanford imposes on students, she said.
"I did experience culture shock," said one
Apache student who grew up on the Jicarilla
Apache reservation in New Mexico. "My
problems deal; with a feeling of alienation —
the differences (between reservation and

University life) were so marked. Stanford did
virtually nothing to alleviate that. The sup
port services here (the Bridge, Cowell) are
not directed at native Americans."
For this reason, the SAIO does provide*,
peer counseling services in Roble to help the
students cope with adjusting to University
life.

proach academics differently, according to
