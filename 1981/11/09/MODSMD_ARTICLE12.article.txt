The Stanford community "needs to be
come more aware of issues relating to dis
abled persons," said Bill Seidman, special
ist on programs for the disabled. Those of
us who are "temporarily able-bodied"
may be just an accident away from being
disabled, he said.
The United Nations has designated 1981
as the International Year of Disabled Per
sons (IYDP). In celebration of the U.N. des
ignation, and to increase public awareness
of the issues surrounding disabled per
sons, the Stanford University IYDP Com
mittee is sponsoring a two-week program
focusing on the physically limited.
A series of free public lectures, which
began last week, treats the subject from
both a medical and human point of view.
An exhibition of wheelchair basketball will
also be held this week.
A panel discussion on "The Experience
of Disabled Persons," conducted by Dr.
David Kaplan, director of Stanford's Help
Center, kicked off the program last Mon
day. After a short, lively film, A Different
Approach, which humorously encouraged
employers to hire the disabled, the panel
of three discussed their experiences of
being disabled with the small but attentive
audience.
"In a lot of ways it's been a real positive
influence on my life," said panel member
Debbie Kaplan. "It's forced me to take my
self and my life a little bit more seriously."

Her diving accident increased her
awareness of her inner strength and adap
tability, Kaplan said. She is now a disability
rights lawyer and serves as vice-chair of the
state council on developmental dis
abilities.
As Stanford's accessibility consultant,
Nick Zirpolo has been a driving force be
hind the upgrading of the campus's physi
cal accessibility for the physically limited,
such as the addition of ramps and wide
doorways. He estimates that Stanford is
about 97 percent accessible, but that con
siderably less progress has been made in
the areas of student admissions and em
ployment.
"There were changes, but they weren't
as significant as I expected them to be,"
said Ralph Hotchkiss, who was disabled by
a motorcycle accident. Because he had al
ready been working in rehabilitation engi
neering, his job was not affected. He has
been working as a wheelchair design con
sultant for the past 15 years.
"Stress-Related Disabilities" was the
topic for the second lecture last week, pre
sented by Dr. Stewart Agras, professor of
psychiatry. Job-related stress such as hy
pertension is considered a disability. The
lecture included up-to-date research on
stress in the workforce and other environ
ments and some suggestions for combat
ting stress.
Joe Hennessey, director of Western
Blind Rehabilitation Center, gave

Wednesday's lecture on "Disabling Visual
Impairments." Hennessey demonstrated
the technology for the visually handi
capped currently available and being re
searched for future use.
A lecture tomorrow night will focus on
"Spinal Cord Injury — What Can Be Done
and What You Can Do." Speakers will be
Dr. Inder Perkash, chief of staff of the
Spinal Cord Injuries unit at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center, and
Michael Dunn, clinical psychologist at the
V.A. Center.
"Speech and Hearing Related Dis
orders" will be the topic for Wednesday's
lecture. Holly Hosford-Dunn, director of
the Stanford Audiology Clinic, members
of the audiology staff and Kathryn Beadle,
director of the Mid-Peninsula Speech and
Language Clinic, will present a joint pro
gram addressing hearing and speech dis
abilities and how to cope with them.
"The Alcohol Related Disability" will be
discussed Thursday by Stephanie Brown,
director of Stanford Alcohol Clinic. She
will speak along with a recovering alcohol
ic and spouse and an employee assistance
counselor.
The Santa Cruz Rollercoasters, members
of a Bay Area league of wheelchair basket
ball players, will exhibit their skills in
Maples Pavilion on Thursday, preceding
the men's intra-varsity game. Proceeds will
go toward buying an aqua-lift for de-
Guerre pool to aid the physically limited.

The Santa Cruz Rollercoasters, members
of a Bay Area league of wheelchair basket
ball players, will exhibit their skills in
Maples Pavilion on Thursday, preceding
the men's intra-varsity game. Proceeds will
go toward buying an aqua-lift for de-
Guerre pool to aid the physically limited.
The Stanford community "needs to be
come more aware of issues relating to dis
abled persons," said Bill Seidman, special
ist on programs for the disabled. Those of
us who are "temporarily able-bodied"
may be just an accident away from being
disabled, he said.
The United Nations has designated 1981
as the International Year of Disabled Per
sons (IYDP). In celebration of the U.N. des
ignation, and to increase public awareness
of the issues surrounding disabled per
sons, the Stanford University IYDP Com
mittee is sponsoring a two-week program
focusing on the physically limited.
A series of free public lectures, which
began last week, treats the subject from
both a medical and human point of view.
An exhibition of wheelchair basketball will
also be held this week.
A panel discussion on "The Experience
of Disabled Persons," conducted by Dr.
David Kaplan, director of Stanford's Help
Center, kicked off the program last Mon
day. After a short, lively film, A Different
Approach, which humorously encouraged
employers to hire the disabled, the panel
of three discussed their experiences of
being disabled with the small but attentive
audience.
"In a lot of ways it's been a real positive
influence on my life," said panel member
Debbie Kaplan. "It's forced me to take my
self and my life a little bit more seriously."

Her diving accident increased her
awareness of her inner strength and adap
tability, Kaplan said. She is now a disability
rights lawyer and serves as vice-chair of the
state council on developmental dis
abilities.
As Stanford's accessibility consultant,
Nick Zirpolo has been a driving force be
hind the upgrading of the campus's physi
cal accessibility for the physically limited,
such as the addition of ramps and wide
doorways. He estimates that Stanford is
about 97 percent accessible, but that con
siderably less progress has been made in
the areas of student admissions and em
ployment.
"There were changes, but they weren't
as significant as I expected them to be,"
said Ralph Hotchkiss, who was disabled by
a motorcycle accident. Because he had al
ready been working in rehabilitation engi
neering, his job was not affected. He has
been working as a wheelchair design con
sultant for the past 15 years.
"Stress-Related Disabilities" was the
topic for the second lecture last week, pre
sented by Dr. Stewart Agras, professor of
psychiatry. Job-related stress such as hy
pertension is considered a disability. The
lecture included up-to-date research on
stress in the workforce and other environ
ments and some suggestions for combat
ting stress.
Joe Hennessey, director of Western
Blind Rehabilitation Center, gave

Wednesday's lecture on "Disabling Visual
Impairments." Hennessey demonstrated
the technology for the visually handi
capped currently available and being re
searched for future use.
A lecture tomorrow night will focus on
"Spinal Cord Injury — What Can Be Done
and What You Can Do." Speakers will be
Dr. Inder Perkash, chief of staff of the
Spinal Cord Injuries unit at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center, and
Michael Dunn, clinical psychologist at the
V.A. Center.
"Speech and Hearing Related Dis
orders" will be the topic for Wednesday's
lecture. Holly Hosford-Dunn, director of
the Stanford Audiology Clinic, members
of the audiology staff and Kathryn Beadle,
director of the Mid-Peninsula Speech and
Language Clinic, will present a joint pro
gram addressing hearing and speech dis
abilities and how to cope with them.
"The Alcohol Related Disability" will be
discussed Thursday by Stephanie Brown,
director of Stanford Alcohol Clinic. She
will speak along with a recovering alcohol
ic and spouse and an employee assistance
counselor.
The Santa Cruz Rollercoasters, members
of a Bay Area league of wheelchair basket
ball players, will exhibit their skills in
Maples Pavilion on Thursday, preceding
the men's intra-varsity game. Proceeds will
go toward buying an aqua-lift for de-
Guerre pool to aid the physically limited.
