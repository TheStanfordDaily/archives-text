## Editorial Security combats rape 
### 
People who say Stanford is simply "not the
real world" are obviously not thinking in terms
of violent criminal acts, such as the one which
occurred on campus last Thursday morning.
Rape is a constant reality which concerns our
whole community every day. The"it won't
happen to me" attitude is no longer an
acceptable approach to the problem. The fact is
that no one is immune to the danger of rape; it
could happen to you or someone you love.
At the University, much has been doneand
continues to to be done to deal with rape and
the fear of rape.
•Several weeks ago, more than 35 University
departments and organizations sponsored
"Rape Awareness Week," during which
seminars and workshops dealt with the
problems of "increasing freedom and
decreasing fear." More than 100 people were
directly involved with the week's activities.
•OUTREACH, sponsored by the Stanford
Police Department in conjunction with the
Office of Residential Education, is the name of a
program begun last year in which a groupof
students disseminate safety information
through pamphlets and meetings in on-campus
houses and dorms.
•The University Planning Office has
recognized and acted upon the need for more
campus lighting, and the Students United for
Rape Elimination (SURE) escort service has
continued to expand and develop its services.
•Patricia Brandt, working through the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs, has been able to
obtain University funds for an ongoing rape
education project and is working to obtain a
permanent budget for this purpose.
In addition to these positive steps toward
prevention, there are a number of available
hotlines and centers (including Counseling and
Psychological Servicesat Cowell and the Mid-
Peninsula Rape Crisis Center) which have
trained counselors who offer services to rape
victims.
While these organizations and programs are
important and serve a vital function, they will
still not eliminate the crime even if we all take
advantage of them. We can talk about the long
term need to change societal attitudes toward
women and sex roles, but those things, while
valid goals, won't stop the rapist here and now.
The police say they will try to put a patrol car

around the site of Thursday's rape (near the
Stanford Stadium). They also say that there is
little they can do to prevent rapes in areas with
so many bushes ana trees.
But, what about the area near Tresidder,
which was the site of an attempted rape earlier
this year? Or the Quad, where a rape took place
last fall?
According to the police, there are only four
cars on patrol at any given time, and their
effectiveness is limited because"this place is
huge." Stanford's size alone, though, does not
provide an acceptable excuse for not
preventing crime. And we don't think that cars
alone will eliminate the problem. What we do
think is that the University needs to continue to
reassess its priorities to take into account this
growing concern.
Programs are great — we're not trying to
downplay their importance. However, when a
woman can't even go for a morning jog without
rape or the fear of rape, the University nas a
moral and financial responsibility to recognize
and to try to deal with tne problem practically.
The bottom line is a need for more security and
the right kind of security. We need more tnan
four cars and a few parking ticket attendants on
campus.
The University needs to find a way to better
patrol areas of campus which can't be seen or
reached by cars. Assigning several officers to
foot patrol or bike patrol or mounted patrol
would increase coverage; placing police call
boxes at certain strategic locations on campus
might also be effective. And we need this kind of
security 24 hours a day.
Thiscampus/s big, and it has many beautiful
areas. If we aren't safe or don't feel safe to enjoy
them, however, what'sthe point? After women
learn about rape and take all precautions short
of living in a glass bubble, there is still something
that can be done about the ever-present danger
and fear of rape. If Stanford is enough a part of
the"real world" to have "real world" problems,
then ideologies must be combined with
practicalities in order to implement "real
world" solutions.
We hope the University will provide the
security necessary for the physical and
emotional well-being of all of the members of
the University community.
