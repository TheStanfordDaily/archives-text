## Value sporting successes 
### 
This might not necessarily be the best of times
to be talking about sports, caught as we are in
the midst of a disappointing football season.
Many at this University tend to value success
in its athletic endeavors, as that success is touted
among the reasons for Stanford's overall
prominence. But the Saturday Armageddons
have come and gone this fall, and most of the
time we've fallen up short. So we look
elsewhere for comfort, and savor triumphs in
the lessapocalypticsports — water polo,soccer,
field hockey, even intramural frisbee ....
At the same time, those of us who care — and
there are many — have still allowed themselves
to dream of football years past and future.
Someday out at Stanford Stadium, things will be
all right again; for now, we wait (with a little
difficulty) for glory to be ours again.
Why bother?
That's a question that has never ceased to
fascinate me. I may as well be honest from the
start, and confess that sports do make a
difference to me. I remember wins and losses,
whether I played the game or, along with 70,000
others, merely watched it. I remember goals
scored in the 6th grade and strikeouts suffered
in Little League, and I canstil) feel swimming
races lost by inches (some by yards) and tennis
victories snatched from certain defeat.
We may also be honest, and openly admit that
none of it really makesa difference. Nothing
could be more inconsequential, on the face of
it, than whether one bunch of men can succeed

in pushing a ball past a goal line more often than
another bunch of men. Or, in the span of human
history, how could anyone possibly be
concerned about who wins the World Series?
That kind of question, though, just doesn't
seem to matter when the pressure is on or time is
running out on the clock. And it's probably
there that sports can best be explained, because
for those who care, whether participants or
spectators, sports take on a distinct importance
all their own.
The best explanation I've ever heard is that
sport gives man the illusion of significance. For
that period of time that we immerse ourselves in
the drama of competition, everything else
generally gets blocked out. At Stanford Stadium
on a fall afternoon, we manage to convince
ourselves, however briefly, that nothingelse
matters but whether we hold the line or win on a
final field goal.
Similarly, a solitary run up a long hill yields
many the same oblivion; all that really counts,
for that brief span, is whet her you make it, and
how you're going to do so.
Inevitably, and usually too soon, the world
again becomes a complex place where the
.consequences of thingsare hardly ever all good
or all bad, and where the true aim of human
effort usually seems a bit more ambiguous. The
world of course would not be as fascinating a
place if it were otherwise; still, we can and
should bask in those pure emotions that sports
draw out in us.
