## Aid to repressive regimes harms U.S. 
### 
It is regrettable, from the point of view of King
George 111, that the Reagan administration was not
around during the American Revolution. If one
were to imagine that the Reagan administration
had in fact existed, the following turn of events
sounds plausible: first, Reagan would denounce
the American revolutionaries as "communist
guerillas," or perhaps "radical left-wing ter
rorists." These guerillas, Reagan would explain,
were receiving extensive military aid from a com
munist/revolutionary government (that's France),
and it is thus necessary to come to the aid of a
"moderately repressive right-wing regime" (that's
England). Accordingly, Reagan would send
George 111 several helicopters, armored personnel
carriers and military advisors, not to mention plen
ty of small weapons and ammunition, allowing
George to execute all of the "communist
guerillas" who signed the Declaration of Inde
pendence and to successfully quell the revolution.
This analysis is impossible for two reasons. First,
the Reagan administration could not have existed
at the time. Second, it is unlikely that George 111
would have been classified as"moderately repres
sive," for this label is reserved for those who com
monly use murder and torture to silence their op
position. George and his nasty taxes hardly qualify.
One need look no farther than Central America
to confirm this diagnosis. The Reagan adminis
tration is currently actively supporting mod

erately repressive" regimes in Guatemala, Hon
duras and El Salvador. In El Salvador alone, Amnes
ty International and the Catholic church have at
tributed more than 20,000 violent deaths to the na
tional guard and to right-wing extremist groups.
The possibility that a revolution might develop
without instigation from outside forces in a coun
try where two percent of the population owns 57
percent of the land seems to have escaped the at
tention of the Reagan administration.
The Reagan administration is by no means the
first to interfere in the rights of Central American
countries to self-determination. America has a
long and bloody history of quelling popular revo
lutions with marines and military aid — from El
Salvador to Nicaragua to the Dominican Republic.
Indeed, now that Nicaragua has finally thrown off
over 30 years of authoritarian rule, the U.S. has
threatened to cut off aid and left the under
standably alienated Nicaraguans with virtually no
choice but to look to the Soviets for arms and aid.
Underlying this long and violent history of in
tervention is the assumption that U.S. national se
curity interests are incompatible with human
rights, an assumption which is usually expressed by
U.S. support for repressive but anti-Communist re
gimes. This is a glaring contradiction in terms: the
U.S. is supposedly stopping Communism, which is
equated with repression, by supporting repres
sion. It is actually antithetical to long-term U.S. se

curity interests.
The U.S. has a legitimate interest in encouraging
stable, friendly, non-militaristic governments; an
interest which is prevented by support of un
popular, unstable, military governments, regard
less of their friendliness towards the U.S. Our in
terest does not lie in stopping Communism per se,
but in stopping repressive governments or Com
munist governments tied to the Soviet Union.
U.S. efforts to curb Cuban and Soviet arms are
limited by heavy U.S. military aid to Guatemala,
Honduras and El Salvador but it is hardly consistent
to protest Soviet tanks in Nicaragua while U.S. heli
copters and fighter planes are being sent to Cen
tral America. A legitimate interest in arms control
is thus limited by an illegitimate interest in arms
sales.
Unfortunately, in this way and in others, current
U.S. policy in Central America runs counter to U.S.
national security interests. Even more importantly,
current policy runs counter to human interests.
Until the U.S. adopts a policy which recognizes hu
man rights and the rights of nations, our national
security will be in jeopardy, and our actions in
Central America will stand as a mockery of the
principles upon which our own nation was
founded.

It is regrettable, from the point of view of King
George 111, that the Reagan administration was not
around during the American Revolution. If one
were to imagine that the Reagan administration
had in fact existed, the following turn of events
sounds plausible: first, Reagan would denounce
the American revolutionaries as "communist
guerillas," or perhaps "radical left-wing ter
rorists." These guerillas, Reagan would explain,
were receiving extensive military aid from a com
munist/revolutionary government (that's France),
and it is thus necessary to come to the aid of a
"moderately repressive right-wing regime" (that's
England). Accordingly, Reagan would send
George 111 several helicopters, armored personnel
carriers and military advisors, not to mention plen
ty of small weapons and ammunition, allowing
George to execute all of the "communist
guerillas" who signed the Declaration of Inde
pendence and to successfully quell the revolution.
This analysis is impossible for two reasons. First,
the Reagan administration could not have existed
at the time. Second, it is unlikely that George 111
would have been classified as"moderately repres
sive," for this label is reserved for those who com
monly use murder and torture to silence their op
position. George and his nasty taxes hardly qualify.
One need look no farther than Central America
to confirm this diagnosis. The Reagan adminis
tration is currently actively supporting mod

erately repressive" regimes in Guatemala, Hon
duras and El Salvador. In El Salvador alone, Amnes
ty International and the Catholic church have at
tributed more than 20,000 violent deaths to the na
tional guard and to right-wing extremist groups.
The possibility that a revolution might develop
without instigation from outside forces in a coun
try where two percent of the population owns 57
percent of the land seems to have escaped the at
tention of the Reagan administration.
The Reagan administration is by no means the
first to interfere in the rights of Central American
countries to self-determination. America has a
long and bloody history of quelling popular revo
lutions with marines and military aid — from El
Salvador to Nicaragua to the Dominican Republic.
Indeed, now that Nicaragua has finally thrown off
over 30 years of authoritarian rule, the U.S. has
threatened to cut off aid and left the under
standably alienated Nicaraguans with virtually no
choice but to look to the Soviets for arms and aid.
Underlying this long and violent history of in
tervention is the assumption that U.S. national se
curity interests are incompatible with human
rights, an assumption which is usually expressed by
U.S. support for repressive but anti-Communist re
gimes. This is a glaring contradiction in terms: the
U.S. is supposedly stopping Communism, which is
equated with repression, by supporting repres
sion. It is actually antithetical to long-term U.S. se

curity interests.
The U.S. has a legitimate interest in encouraging
stable, friendly, non-militaristic governments; an
interest which is prevented by support of un
popular, unstable, military governments, regard
less of their friendliness towards the U.S. Our in
terest does not lie in stopping Communism per se,
but in stopping repressive governments or Com
munist governments tied to the Soviet Union.
U.S. efforts to curb Cuban and Soviet arms are
limited by heavy U.S. military aid to Guatemala,
Honduras and El Salvador but it is hardly consistent
to protest Soviet tanks in Nicaragua while U.S. heli
copters and fighter planes are being sent to Cen
tral America. A legitimate interest in arms control
is thus limited by an illegitimate interest in arms
sales.
Unfortunately, in this way and in others, current
U.S. policy in Central America runs counter to U.S.
national security interests. Even more importantly,
current policy runs counter to human interests.
Until the U.S. adopts a policy which recognizes hu
man rights and the rights of nations, our national
security will be in jeopardy, and our actions in
Central America will stand as a mockery of the
principles upon which our own nation was
founded.
