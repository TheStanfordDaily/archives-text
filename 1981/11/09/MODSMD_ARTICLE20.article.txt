## Kenya faces tough challenge 
### 
It seems that the West is finally
awakening to the fact that the Third
World is in serious trouble. However,
a more disturbing realization is yet to
come; the situation will get much
worse before it gets better. In the not
so distant future, problems relating
to population growth, education and
agricultural development may over
whelm many Asian, African and
South American countries.
In light of the complex web of in
ternational dependence, it appears
that widespread collapse in these
areas could well result in disaster for
the West as well. No one knows ex
actly what actions must be taken to
avoid catastrophe. The issues at hand
are extremely complicated and con
troversial.
Still, the first step toward any solu
tion is understanding, so let us take
that first step as we examine the situ
ation in Kenya, an east African nation
of 16.5 million people.
Mitesh Shah is a freshman at Stan
ford. He is also a Kenyan. In a recent
discussion about his country, some
interesting facts were brought out:
"Our population will double in 20
years. That's very significant. With a
population growth rate of nearly four
percent per year, development is not
keeping pace." Current per capita
income in Kenya stands at about $220
per year. It won't be easy to raise that
level with conditions as they are.
"More roads, water systems and
health care facilities must be de
veloped," adds Mitesh, "but if most
of your resources go to feeding the
needy, this can't happen."
The population problem is even
more complex than it seems at first
glance. Over 60 percent of all Ken
yans are under the age of 18. That
means that the working part of the
population is very small and heavily
burdened. All of these children have
to be fed, clothed and educated.
Mitesh continued, "In the rural
areas, where 90 percent of the peo
ple live, jobs are not paid well so
many leave for the cities where con
ditions can actually be worse for un
skilled workers." Apparently, this is
leading to a revolution in the social
structure. The extended family, once
an important source of support for
the individual, is breaking up.
One of the reasons for the high
rate of population growth is that pa
rents often consider large families to
be an advantage. In many cases, chil
dren add to the income of the family.
Parents are also concerned about
their future; they want enough chil

dren to look after them in their old
age.
"I think the parents have to start
thinking ahead," Mitesh explains. "A
large part of the population does not
realize the problems created by large
families. The government operates a
family planning program but it could
be pushed further. They should go to
the people more often and talk to
them. Very few understand that
they're the ones who should be tak
ing steps to control population.
Wishful thinking won't do any good
at all."
Education is a very high priority in
Kenya. The government has set a goal
of 100 percent literacy by 1983 and
they-seem to be taking their efforts
seriously; one third of all govern
ment spending goes to education.
Still, it's very difficult to keep up the
pace. The major challenge, though, is

keeping the rapidly growing popu
lation fed.
"Only about 20 percent of our land
is arable and some of this is being de
stroyed by poor farming techniques
and over-grazing. Maisai tribesman
add to the problem by maximizing
the number of cattle on the ranges,
placing little emphasis on the
animals' condition," Mitesh shook
his head. For the Maisai, only the
number of cattle owned is indicative
of social position.
Meeting this challenge might not
be easy, but I believe that Kenya will
rise to meet it as well as others."
Mitesh smiled earnestly. From the
confident look on his face, one might
have guessed that he was already
looking upon the future.
