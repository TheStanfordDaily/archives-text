## Allegations Inaccurate; addendum inadequate 
### 
The Daily's preposterously false al
legations about me {Daily, Oct. 27)
and the "addendum" that followed (
Daily, Oct. 28) represent a classic ex
ample of the kind of arrogant jour
nalism so characteristic of contem
porary print media.
Without ever having the common
sense to check its accuracy with me,
its defamation appeared in the lead
story on Page 1. The "addendum,"
which mentioned my "exoneration
of all allegations" merited only a sin
gle sentence in the last column on
the back page. Is it any wonder how
the media generally, and theDa//y, in
particular, earned its reputation for
inaccurate reporting and consum
mate unfairness?

The Daily stands by the story on
conflict of interest which referred to
former Prof. Hayflick. The report that
he was cited for a conflict of interest
in 1976, and that he resigned in the
midst of these investigations, is cor
rect. The Daily regrets that the fact he
was exonerated from the allegations
did not appear within the context of
the story; however, once that in
formation was brought to our atten
tion, it was printed in the newspaper
in the same way that addenda and
corrections are normally printed.
