## Commentary/Jonathan Cohen It's awesome to be wonderful 
### 
Everything is "wonderful" these
days. At least that's the impression
you get from talk overheard in pub
lic. "We saw the most wonderful
French film and then we went out
with Regis and Reba — they're the
most wonderful couple — and we ate
these wonderful avocado sand
wiches."
People with graduate degrees are
surrendering to the word "wonder
ful," signaling the final victory of a
movement toward meaningless ex
clamation and away from qualified
praise. "Wonderful," "awesome,"
"lovely," "intense," and a dozen
other potentially valuable words
have become mouthfuls of com
pliant noise, indices of the stupe
faction and helplessness that give the
Reagan era its character.
These empty exclamations predate
our apathetic times; even in more
hopeful times there have been un
fortunate people grinning and assen
ting among us. "Fabulous" and
"marvelous" have long belonged to
the pathologically delicate. "Fan
tastic," all through the '50s and '60s,
has been the calling card of the just
plain dumb.
There have always been and per
haps will always be "neat-swell" peo
ple who settle on tidy bathrooms and
kitchens as the greatest blessings life
can offer. People consigned to the
most demeaning dirty work have
been known to say, "Vessir!" and
"Very good, Sir!" as they feign en
thusiasm in front of their bosses.
In our own age of diminishing ex
pectations, however, the style of dis
course once associated with brown
nosers, broom pushers and bath
room attendants has risen to social
respectability. Today's "wonderful"
wine and cheese parties and
"awesome" undergraduate beer
blasts issue from a fashionable new
stupidity, a more pervasive resigna
tion. Nothing characterizes Ameri
can culture in the 1980s so much as
the nervous effort to make stupidity
into a value.

"Wonderful" is often uttered
these days in a mood of anxious self
consciousness. The wondering indi
vidual (who may also often be
amazed, astounded, delighted,
wiped-out, bowled over, and blown
away by events) knows that he
doesn't know what he's talking
about. Somewhere, back in his child
hood, he is taught to feel guilty about
knowing nothing; someone im
presses him, very early in his life, with
the importance of knowing right
from wrong and sugar from shinola.
He is on his way to becoming a per
son with values and beliefs until he
reaches age four; then his moral de
velopment is handed to television,
the top 40, and, worst of all, public
education. He listens to the instruc-

'Wonderful/'awesome/'lovely/'intense/
and a dozen other potentially valuable words

indices of the stupefaction and helplessness
thai give the Reagan era its character.

tions of his teachers in school and in
the media and devotes himself
dutifully to the pursuit of those pleas
ures money can buy, but his retarded
conscience lingers, distressingly, as a
nameless discontent.
The pseudo-self-conscious ex
clamations of California psycho-bab
ble ("Wow!" "Okay!" "I've got it!"
etc.) issue from this same puzzled un
happiness. The questing sucker pays
for a language that celebrates ev
erything and nothing, his sorry, un
formed self included. In EST, at
Esalen, in all kinds of "born again"
bargains and quick therapies he
avoids the difficulty of feeling, think
ing or doing anything in particular.
He is no less helpless, but suddenly
"saved," "transformed," "magnif
icent," and "more fully human."
Whatever he suffers is "being here
now," part of his "selfhood" and the

fluxed-up currents of Jesus or the
Buddha or the original big bang.
The undergraduate "awesome"
may also signify guilt and terror, but it
is perhaps best grouped with even
less self-conscious celebrations of
stupidity like "far-out," "groovy,"
and "intense." These words, when
used in their pure non-sense, show
the effort to make a value out of stu
pidity taken to a logical extreme.
The adolescent who values
"awesome" rock concerts, drug ex
periences, junk food binges and Pen
thouse pets (preferably all in com
bination) isn't nervously hemming
around the limits of his conscious
ness. Nor has he adopted a religion
that celebrates his lonely, nameless
pain. He wants, instead, to obliterate

himself altogether, for as many hours
as he can possibly afford to be absent,
nowhere, blown away.
Vanishing in all these different at
tempts at the celebration of nothing
is the conviction that meaning and
pleasure dwell in concerned and co
operative action. "Wonderful,"
"awesome," and "intense" ex
periences are purchased, passive,
packaged. Love is giving way to
mutual exploitation; and our demo
cratic institutions, our president tells
us, serve us best by dismantling
themselves, leaving us in the charge
of the pushers, the packagers, the
people who see others as prey.
(Jonathan Cohen teaches at the Uni
versity of Santa Clara, where he
grades fifty awesome freshman pa
pers each week. Last year, he was an
intense Wallace Steugner fellow in
creative writing.)

Everything is "wonderful" these
days. At least that's the impression
you get from talk overheard in pub
lic. "We saw the most wonderful
French film and then we went out
with Regis and Reba — they're the
most wonderful couple — and we ate
these wonderful avocado sand
wiches."
People with graduate degrees are
surrendering to the word "wonder
ful," signaling the final victory of a
movement toward meaningless ex
clamation and away from qualified
praise. "Wonderful," "awesome,"
"lovely," "intense," and a dozen
other potentially valuable words
have become mouthfuls of com
pliant noise, indices of the stupe
faction and helplessness that give the
Reagan era its character.
These empty exclamations predate
our apathetic times; even in more
hopeful times there have been un
fortunate people grinning and assen
ting among us. "Fabulous" and
"marvelous" have long belonged to
the pathologically delicate. "Fan
tastic," all through the '50s and '60s,
has been the calling card of the just
plain dumb.
There have always been and per
haps will always be "neat-swell" peo
ple who settle on tidy bathrooms and
kitchens as the greatest blessings life
can offer. People consigned to the
most demeaning dirty work have
been known to say, "Vessir!" and
"Very good, Sir!" as they feign en
thusiasm in front of their bosses.
In our own age of diminishing ex
pectations, however, the style of dis
course once associated with brown
nosers, broom pushers and bath
room attendants has risen to social
respectability. Today's "wonderful"
wine and cheese parties and
"awesome" undergraduate beer
blasts issue from a fashionable new
stupidity, a more pervasive resigna
tion. Nothing characterizes Ameri
can culture in the 1980s so much as
the nervous effort to make stupidity
into a value.

"Wonderful" is often uttered
these days in a mood of anxious self
consciousness. The wondering indi
vidual (who may also often be
amazed, astounded, delighted,
wiped-out, bowled over, and blown
away by events) knows that he
doesn't know what he's talking
about. Somewhere, back in his child
hood, he is taught to feel guilty about
knowing nothing; someone im
presses him, very early in his life, with
the importance of knowing right
from wrong and sugar from shinola.
He is on his way to becoming a per
son with values and beliefs until he
reaches age four; then his moral de
velopment is handed to television,
the top 40, and, worst of all, public
education. He listens to the instruc-

'Wonderful/'awesome/'lovely/'intense/
and a dozen other potentially valuable words

indices of the stupefaction and helplessness
thai give the Reagan era its character.

tions of his teachers in school and in
the media and devotes himself
dutifully to the pursuit of those pleas
ures money can buy, but his retarded
conscience lingers, distressingly, as a
nameless discontent.
The pseudo-self-conscious ex
clamations of California psycho-bab
ble ("Wow!" "Okay!" "I've got it!"
etc.) issue from this same puzzled un
happiness. The questing sucker pays
for a language that celebrates ev
erything and nothing, his sorry, un
formed self included. In EST, at
Esalen, in all kinds of "born again"
bargains and quick therapies he
avoids the difficulty of feeling, think
ing or doing anything in particular.
He is no less helpless, but suddenly
"saved," "transformed," "magnif
icent," and "more fully human."
Whatever he suffers is "being here
now," part of his "selfhood" and the

fluxed-up currents of Jesus or the
Buddha or the original big bang.
The undergraduate "awesome"
may also signify guilt and terror, but it
is perhaps best grouped with even
less self-conscious celebrations of
stupidity like "far-out," "groovy,"
and "intense." These words, when
used in their pure non-sense, show
the effort to make a value out of stu
pidity taken to a logical extreme.
The adolescent who values
"awesome" rock concerts, drug ex
periences, junk food binges and Pen
thouse pets (preferably all in com
bination) isn't nervously hemming
around the limits of his conscious
ness. Nor has he adopted a religion
that celebrates his lonely, nameless
pain. He wants, instead, to obliterate

himself altogether, for as many hours
as he can possibly afford to be absent,
nowhere, blown away.
Vanishing in all these different at
tempts at the celebration of nothing
is the conviction that meaning and
pleasure dwell in concerned and co
operative action. "Wonderful,"
"awesome," and "intense" ex
periences are purchased, passive,
packaged. Love is giving way to
mutual exploitation; and our demo
cratic institutions, our president tells
us, serve us best by dismantling
themselves, leaving us in the charge
of the pushers, the packagers, the
people who see others as prey.
