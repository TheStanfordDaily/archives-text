## Eradicating entomological enemy vital

. . . Whocka Whocka Whocka . . .
The pilot swung his chopper
around for another pass, screaming
above the strains of Wagner, "I love
the smell of malathion in the morn
ing! It smells like Victory!"
Examining the carnage around me,
I balked at the bumblebees and but
terflies that lay belly up among the
twisted, bent branches. We had to
destroy the orchard to save it. The
sickly sweet stench of rotting fruit

penetrated the darkest corners of my
mind. Was it just another bad dream,
or were these three months living in
Corridor 6 beginning to wear thin?
No . . , I must remember my mission
I received my order from the big
White House. (It was utterly white —
no minorities.) My contact was
Medwin Meese, a man of miniscule
maneuverability of mind. Medwin's
personal interrogation of two fertile

medflies had revealed that Ho Chi
Med was establishing guerilla strong
holds deep in the rugged Santa Cruz
Mountains. My mission was to
eradicate the enemy before it in
filtrated further. The reasoning was
pure domino theory; if the Santa
Clara Valley fell, the San Joaquin
would go next, leaving the Imperial
Valley ripe for subversion. There was
no choice but to terminate Ho Chi
Med's command. In short, render
Med dead.
Armed with a can of Raid and a
shoebox full of sterile flies, I trudged
deeper and deeper into the Santa
Clara Valley, advancing on Ho Chi
Med's trail. I held the shoebox with
suspicion; I couldn't help but think
of the Peruvian squadron that had
defected last spring. These thoughts
mercilessly muddled my mind as I
methodically made my way towards
the mysterious mountains.
Cautiously, I entered the DMZ
(Demediterized Zone). For three
months this had been the scene of in
tensive search-and-destroy mission,
what had yielded a gruesome body
count for two fertile adults and seven
maggots. Scouting reports from my
sterile flies revealed a postive popu
lation count — he was near. His pres
ence was everywhere.
I radioed the big White House for
further instructions from the top. The
president wa* napping; Medwin
took mycall. He suggested saturation
spraying if Med's command was not
terminated within 24 hours.

Time was running short. 23 hours
of fruitless searching and still no sign
of Ho Chi Med. Suddenly — a peach
fell from a nearby tree! A menagerie
of maniacal medfly maggots
emerged, marching maliciously in a
movement of menacing magnitude.
My steriles were impotent against the
advancing onslaught. I reached for
my can of Raid . . . Whocka Whocka
Whocka .. . Aarrrggghhh!!!. . .

"Jerry, Jerry! Wake up! You were
having a nightmare.''
"Oh, Linda! The horror! The hor
ror!"
