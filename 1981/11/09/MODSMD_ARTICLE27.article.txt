## Khadafy: menacing charmer 
### 
Washington — Moammar Khadafy
isn't the sort of guy you'd bring home
for dinner.
Yes, he's better looking than PLO
leader Yasir Arafat, and yes, he has
that charming Pepsodent smile.
But the numerous spellings of his
name are enough to arouse any hos
tess' anxiety. Is it Khadafy, Gaddafi,
Quatafi or Qaddafi? And where do
you seat a man who is always seen
raising a clenched fist on the dinner
time news? There's something sus
picious about this Libyan whom Pres
ident Jimmy Carter calls "sub
human" and President Gerald Ford
says is a bully.
In recent months, Khadafy hasn't
done much to allay his menacing
reputation. In Chad, a country his
army still largely occupies, he's
massed troops on the border with the
Sudan, which may be the next nation

spellings of his name
are enough to arouse
any hostess' anxiety. Is

on his hit list. He also praised his air
force after its duel with U.S. Navy pi
lots and cheered at the grisly death of
Egypt's Anwar Sadat.
Indeed, no foreign leader sends
more chills through Americans than
the 40-year-old colonel from Tripoli.
He's frightening and enigmatic.
Fierrnan F. Eilts, former U.S. am
bassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
admits, however, to being charmed
when he first met Khadafy:
"Fle's got this peculiar quality of
being able to say, with an almost
boyish smile, that he's about to un
dertake some assassination plot,"

said Eilts. "There's not a bit of grim
ness in his method of saying it."
Not surprisingly, most Americans
would go along with Reagan admin
istration plans to undermine
Khadafy, even if that required anoth
er brutal Middle East shoot-out. And
they'd probably approve a U.S. trade
boycott with oil-rich but unprin
cipled Libya, though such an effort
would require worldwide coopera
tion to be successful.
Yet some Mideast experts agree we
can't safely bring the Libyan wildman
to his knees by simply calling him
names — which seems to be current
U.S. policy.
Khadafy, who took power in a 1969
military coup, has cultivated relative
ly strong support among Libya's two
million citizens through socialism
and increased petrol wealth.
Landlords have surrendered hous
ing ownership to tenants and con
sumer goods have flowed to those
who once could not afford them.
While wiping out free enterprise and
placing restrictions on life and liber
ty, devoutly Moslem Khadafy has
brought about vastly improved living
conditions for most of his society.
As long as his oil holds out,
Khadafy probably can maintain his
backing among the average Libyan
against both internal and external ef
forts to undermine his regime, sever
al scholars told us.
But, for several reasons, Khadafy
isn't as secure as he appears. For one,
economic expectations among the
masses may not be met. Income from
Libyan oil is expected to drop by half
this year over 1980 totals (approx
imately $16 billion to $7 billion).
Meanwhile, Khadafy has overcom
mitted himself to large arms
purchases and construction projects
which could lead the economy into a
cash crunch.
Moreover, Khadafy's military de
signs in Northern Africa are said to be
sapping the enthusiasm of educated
young conscripts, who may love their
country but fear wasting their years
of schooling in dubious battle on
some obscure part of the Sahara
Desert.
And then there is the matter of
Khadafy's subordinates in the mili
tary and civilian leadership. Like most
military dictators, he plays cat and
mouse with these groups, keeping
both guessing through shakeups and
demotions. Not surprisingly, the
coup-conscious colonel employs nu

merous family members as personal
aides.
It's no wonder that the smiling
Khadafy is paranoid. He's escaped
two assassination conspiracies in the
last two years and believes his
Western-backed opponents over
seas are still gunning for him.
What worries Khadafy's neighbor
ing enemies most, however, is not
necessarily his 89,000-man army. It's
that the petulant leader possessesad
vanced weapons, including 450 com
bat aircraft and a variety of airborne
missiles — and the will to deploy
them. With Tripoli 1500 miles away
from Egypt and the Sudan, the mis
siles are a dangerous threat.
As long as Khadafy has the weap
ons and ego to play hardball, we
won't secure the world's safety sim
ply by calling him names. He proves
that he thrives on that. Such attacks
may only enhance his position at
home and give him the fire to flex his
muscles.

As any mother can tell
you, the best way to
deal with a bully is to
ignore him. So far,
we've only given
Khadafy the notoriety
he craves.

Some analysts contend that the
U.S. should be on a more productive
course. "We're only acting as we did
with North Vietnam," said William
Zartman of the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies.
"We frequently express feelings
about somebody but don't make it
clear what he should do."
As any mother can tell you, the
best way to deal with a bully is to ig

embargo on Libyan oil, the colonel
might just be pushed back into the
darkness.

on his hit list. He also praised his air
force after its duel with U.S. Navy pi
lots and cheered at the grisly death of
Egypt's Anwar Sadat.
Indeed, no foreign leader sends
more chills through Americans than
the 40-year-old colonel from Tripoli.
He's frightening and enigmatic.
Fierrnan F. Eilts, former U.S. am
bassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
admits, however, to being charmed
when he first met Khadafy:
"Fle's got this peculiar quality of
being able to say, with an almost
boyish smile, that he's about to un
dertake some assassination plot,"

said Eilts. "There's not a bit of grim
ness in his method of saying it."
Not surprisingly, most Americans
would go along with Reagan admin
istration plans to undermine
Khadafy, even if that required anoth
er brutal Middle East shoot-out. And
they'd probably approve a U.S. trade
boycott with oil-rich but unprin
cipled Libya, though such an effort
would require worldwide coopera
tion to be successful.
Yet some Mideast experts agree we
can't safely bring the Libyan wildman
to his knees by simply calling him
names — which seems to be current
U.S. policy.
Khadafy, who took power in a 1969
military coup, has cultivated relative
ly strong support among Libya's two
million citizens through socialism
and increased petrol wealth.
Landlords have surrendered hous
ing ownership to tenants and con
sumer goods have flowed to those
who once could not afford them.
While wiping out free enterprise and
placing restrictions on life and liber
ty, devoutly Moslem Khadafy has
brought about vastly improved living
conditions for most of his society.
As long as his oil holds out,
Khadafy probably can maintain his
backing among the average Libyan
against both internal and external ef
forts to undermine his regime, sever
al scholars told us.
But, for several reasons, Khadafy
isn't as secure as he appears. For one,
economic expectations among the
masses may not be met. Income from
Libyan oil is expected to drop by half
this year over 1980 totals (approx
imately $16 billion to $7 billion).
Meanwhile, Khadafy has overcom
mitted himself to large arms
purchases and construction projects
which could lead the economy into a
cash crunch.
Moreover, Khadafy's military de
signs in Northern Africa are said to be
sapping the enthusiasm of educated
young conscripts, who may love their
country but fear wasting their years
of schooling in dubious battle on
some obscure part of the Sahara
Desert.
And then there is the matter of
Khadafy's subordinates in the mili
tary and civilian leadership. Like most
military dictators, he plays cat and
mouse with these groups, keeping
both guessing through shakeups and
demotions. Not surprisingly, the
coup-conscious colonel employs nu

merous family members as personal
aides.
It's no wonder that the smiling
Khadafy is paranoid. He's escaped
two assassination conspiracies in the
last two years and believes his
Western-backed opponents over
seas are still gunning for him.
What worries Khadafy's neighbor
ing enemies most, however, is not
necessarily his 89,000-man army. It's
that the petulant leader possessesad
vanced weapons, including 450 com
bat aircraft and a variety of airborne
missiles — and the will to deploy
them. With Tripoli 1500 miles away
from Egypt and the Sudan, the mis
siles are a dangerous threat.
As long as Khadafy has the weap
ons and ego to play hardball, we
won't secure the world's safety sim
ply by calling him names. He proves
that he thrives on that. Such attacks
may only enhance his position at
home and give him the fire to flex his
muscles.

As any mother can tell
you, the best way to
deal with a bully is to
ignore him. So far,
we've only given
Khadafy the notoriety
he craves.

Some analysts contend that the
U.S. should be on a more productive
course. "We're only acting as we did
with North Vietnam," said William
Zartman of the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies.
"We frequently express feelings
about somebody but don't make it
clear what he should do."

embargo on Libyan oil, the colonel
might just be pushed back into the
