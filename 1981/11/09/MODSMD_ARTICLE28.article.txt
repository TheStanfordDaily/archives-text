# Letter
## Frats drink tequila and destroy dogs at lunch 
### 
The morning of the first Wednes
day in November was a very disturb
ing one for me. It was in between two
differential equations that I read Tim
Hesterberg's letter (Daily Nov. 4) ex
plaining the fraternity system's in
evitable transformation of "ordinary
people" into "jerks." It was person
ally a great shoe k — you see, I am one
of those famed fraternity members.
Perhaps I, and many other actives
and pledges, are not yet beyond loss.
I found Hesterberg's letter highly en
lightening and am beginning to rec
ognize the error of my ways. This re
alization was initially traumatic, but
after some psychological counseling
I came to grips with myself and am
now determined to spread the word.
Our fraternity definitely brings out
the worst in people. Where else do
you have to use tequila with your
cereal instead of milk? It gives you a
headache all day. Every noon we kid
nap a dog and torture it to death, dis
posing of the bloody remains in a vat
of acid we have stored next to the
whips and chains we use for gang rap
ing. I never did things when I
was a freshman. At least we don't
commit vandalism that much —

arson is more traditional in the Greek
system.
Perhaps the most dangerous facet
of fraternal organizations at Stanford
is how sneaky they are. Of the 90
people in my freshman dorm, 13
were arrested, but in the two years
since then no one in bur fraternity
has ever gotten more than a speeding
ticket. Thus if fraternities and dorms
were judged by the same standard,
too many dorms would be thrown off
campus and all that would remain
would be those awful dens of sex, al
coholic abuse and mass murder. No,
we should definitely retain the exist
ing policy of nailing fraternities for
every little thing they do. How better
and quicker can we get rid of them?
Finally, I sympathize with
Hesterburg for the tormented period
he spent living in a fraternity house
while desperately seeking another
place to live. As he put it, living with
fraternity guys was one of the most
sickening experiences in his life. I
guess you're just a better human
being than we are.
