# ASSU contests Zete decision
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Members of the ASSU and other student groups have
contested the decision to suspend the Zeta Psi fraternity
here because they claim the University has penalized in
dividual students for belonging to a group and also be
cause the University circumvented previous agreements
with the student body in reaching its decision.
In a letter to University President Donald Kennedy,
Chris Greene, a member of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents said, "I am concerned with the process by which
the decisions were made...(Assoc. Dean for Residsntial
Education) Norm Robinson accepted reports of an ad
hoc committee that was not constituted in accordance
with University procedures long since agreed upon by
the Associated Students and the administration."
ASSU Senator Mark Epstein said, "Robinson refers to
the committee as an ad hoc committee in letters and oth
er material, so it is not an administrative panel." Epstein
said that according to Article 2, Section 9a of the ASSU
Constitution, student members to any ad hoc University
committee must be appointed by the ASSU Nominations
Committee. Epstein said this formality was not followed
by Robinson when he appointed Dayna Goldfine and
Michael Scott to the ad hoc advisory committee he estab
lished.
"The issue has far ranging implications, for by ignoring
mutual agreements, a precedent could be set that would
allow individual administrators to appoint committees to
justify any predetermined conclusions by carefully selec
ting committee members who appear to represent con
stituencies they clearly do not," Greene continued in the
letter.
Most of the controversy arises from the fact that the
University has no set policy for dealing with due process
of student groups, such as the Zeta Psi fraternity, accord
ing to Senate Chair David Phelps. The fraternity was sus
pended from the campus by Robinson, who followed
the recommendations of an ad hoc committee.

The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC),
comprised of five students and six faculty members, will
meet tomorrow afternoon to try to establish such a poli
cy for University action in regard to student groups. The
question of whether individuals give up personal rights
when they join a group has not been addressed, Phelps
said.
But according to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
any policy established by the SCLC will be for future situ
ations only, and will not apply to past actions, including
the Zeta Psi suspension.
The one remaining recourse for Zeta Psi, according to
Thomas Allen, vice president of the fraternity, is to ap
peal the decision "on the basis of individual rights."
"We are questioning whether it is fair to penalize indi
viduals for belonging to a group," said Allen, referring to
part of the suspension stating that no more than two Zeta
Psi members will be allowed to live in any one residence
on campus.
Lyons said that the number of two students "was pure
ly an arbitrary example, a statement by the housing office
that they would not tolerate clustering of the fraternity.
It is by no means an absolute rule, and there might be
more than two fraternity members assigned ro any one
house," he said.
The fraternitv has taken this question to University
Ombudsman John Goheen. Goheen said Friday that he
has not come to any conclusions on the issue.
"I haven't formulated any opinions yet," he said. "This
is a difficult issue and may take a little time."
Goheen said that his fundamental concern is that "a
lot of individuals are punished for the actions of a few."
"What is the basis for punishing a group?," he asked.
This question has also been asked by members of the
ASSU and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
According to Epstein, however, if the SCLC does come
to a decision about handling problems with student
groups, "maybe, in the interest of fair
play, the Zetes will be allowed an op
portunity to be reexamined through
that new process." He said that the
SCLC charter does not specifically
state whether its decisions are retro
active.
The administration, however, has
said that the decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity was purely admin
istrative, and thus it was not a judicial
question which would have involved
student peer juries.
"The Zete action was adminis

trative," said Lyons. "What is being
withdrawn is not a right, but a privi
lege — the privilege of a student
group to have exclusive use of a Uni
versity house."
Lyons said that because of a con
tract between the fraternity and the
University, the University has the
right to revoke this privilege. "Norm
Robinson decided that the Zetes
could not have the house, and that
the individual students would have
to go elsewhere," said Lyons. "No
student rights were violated; no stu
dents were denied housing."

er material, so it is not an administrative panel." Epstein
said that according to Article 2, Section 9a of the ASSU
Constitution, student members to any ad hoc University
committee must be appointed by the ASSU Nominations
Committee. Epstein said this formality was not followed
by Robinson when he appointed Dayna Goldfine and
Michael Scott to the ad hoc advisory committee he estab
lished.
"The issue has far ranging implications, for by ignoring
mutual agreements, a precedent could be set that would
allow individual administrators to appoint committees to
justify any predetermined conclusions by carefully selec
ting committee members who appear to represent con
stituencies they clearly do not," Greene continued in the
letter.
Most of the controversy arises from the fact that the
University has no set policy for dealing with due process
of student groups, such as the Zeta Psi fraternity, accord
ing to Senate Chair David Phelps. The fraternity was sus
pended from the campus by Robinson, who followed
the recommendations of an ad hoc committee.

The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC),
comprised of five students and six faculty members, will
meet tomorrow afternoon to try to establish such a poli
cy for University action in regard to student groups. The
question of whether individuals give up personal rights
when they join a group has not been addressed, Phelps
said.
But according to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
any policy established by the SCLC will be for future situ
ations only, and will not apply to past actions, including
the Zeta Psi suspension.
The one remaining recourse for Zeta Psi, according to
Thomas Allen, vice president of the fraternity, is to ap
peal the decision "on the basis of individual rights."
"We are questioning whether it is fair to penalize indi
viduals for belonging to a group," said Allen, referring to
part of the suspension stating that no more than two Zeta
Psi members will be allowed to live in any one residence
on campus.
Lyons said that the number of two students "was pure
ly an arbitrary example, a statement by the housing office
that they would not tolerate clustering of the fraternity.
It is by no means an absolute rule, and there might be
more than two fraternity members assigned ro any one
house," he said.
The fraternitv has taken this question to University
Ombudsman John Goheen. Goheen said Friday that he
has not come to any conclusions on the issue.
"I haven't formulated any opinions yet," he said. "This
is a difficult issue and may take a little time."
Goheen said that his fundamental concern is that "a
lot of individuals are punished for the actions of a few."
"What is the basis for punishing a group?," he asked.
This question has also been asked by members of the
ASSU and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
According to Epstein, however, if the SCLC does come
to a decision about handling problems with student
groups, "maybe, in the interest of fair
play, the Zetes will be allowed an op
portunity to be reexamined through
that new process." He said that the
SCLC charter does not specifically
state whether its decisions are retro
active.
The administration, however, has
said that the decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity was purely admin
istrative, and thus it was not a judicial
question which would have involved
student peer juries.
"The Zete action was adminis

trative," said Lyons. "What is being
withdrawn is not a right, but a privi
lege — the privilege of a student
group to have exclusive use of a Uni
versity house."
Lyons said that because of a con
tract between the fraternity and the
University, the University has the
right to revoke this privilege. "Norm
Robinson decided that the Zetes
could not have the house, and that
the individual students would have
to go elsewhere," said Lyons. "No
student rights were violated; no stu
dents were denied housing."
Members of the ASSU and other student groups have
contested the decision to suspend the Zeta Psi fraternity
here because they claim the University has penalized in
dividual students for belonging to a group and also be
cause the University circumvented previous agreements
with the student body in reaching its decision.
In a letter to University President Donald Kennedy,
Chris Greene, a member of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents said, "I am concerned with the process by which
the decisions were made...(Assoc. Dean for Residsntial
Education) Norm Robinson accepted reports of an ad
hoc committee that was not constituted in accordance
with University procedures long since agreed upon by
the Associated Students and the administration."
ASSU Senator Mark Epstein said, "Robinson refers to
the committee as an ad hoc committee in letters and oth
er material, so it is not an administrative panel." Epstein
said that according to Article 2, Section 9a of the ASSU
Constitution, student members to any ad hoc University
committee must be appointed by the ASSU Nominations
